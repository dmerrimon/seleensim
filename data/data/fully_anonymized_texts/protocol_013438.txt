maximum observe d concentration (Cmax)after first dose
Primary Estimand:
The primary  estimand assesses clinicall y meaningful differences in effectiveness in patients with 
PMO, based on surrogate measures, focusing on the causal effects attributable to the I MP.
The primary  estimand is the difference in mean percent change in lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] -bone mineral 
density  (LS-BMD) from baseline at week [ADDRESS_10761] -baseline assessment 
of LS-BMD. For the submission in the US, this estimand is regarded as primary  and for the 
submission in the European Union (EU), this estimand is regarde d as co -primary .
The co -primary  estimand for the EU filing is the difference in mean percent change in serum C 
telopeptide cross link of ty pe 1 collagen (sCTX -1) from baseline at week 26, between TVB -009P 
and PROLIA UStreatment arms, regardless of intercu rrent events in the target population of 
patients with PMO. The same anal ysis set will be used for both estimands and therefore patients 
who terminate before week 26 will not be included in the sCTX -1 anal ysis. For the EU 
submission, this estimand is regar ded as co -primary . For the US submission, this estimand is 
regarded as secondary .
General Study Design: This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double -blind study  to 
demonstrate similar efficacy  and safet y of TVB -009P compared to PROLIA US over 7 8 weeks 
administered sc at doses of 60 mg every  26weeks (3 injections) in patients with PMO.

281. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION
1.1. Introduction
1.1.1. TVB -009
TVB -009 is a fully  human immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2)/kappa monoclonal antibody  (mAb) 
directed against receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa -Β ligand (RANKL), which is being 
developed b y Teva as a biosimilar candidate to PROLIA2and XGEVA3with the active 
substance denosumab. Denosumab is currently  licensed a s PROLIA and XGEVA, both being 
first approved in the US in 2010, and in the EU in 2010 (PROLIA) and 2011 (XGEVA). 
TVB -009 has been engineered by  [CONTACT_11325] (DNA) vectors 
encoding a protein that is 100% identical to the amino a cid sequence of denosumab heav y and 
light chains.
Biosimilarity  assessment results, from functional assay s of both the antigen -binding fragment 
(Fab) and cry stallizable fragment (Fc) domain -related activity , demonstrate that TVB -[ADDRESS_10777] parameters related to the denosumab mechanism of action. Minor differences were 
observed in the disulfide isoform distribution, and complement dependent cy totoxicity  (CDC) 
activity  but these differences were not considered to be clinically  meaningful. Analy tical 
(structural and functional) evaluation demonstrates TVB -009 similarit y to PROLIA based on 
substantial data, risk assessment and totality  of evidence approach.
Several molecular signals are involved in regulating bone resorption b y osteoclasts and bone 
formation by  [CONTACT_11326]. In particular, RANKL is 
a key  activator of osteoclasts. Binding to its receptor, receptor acti vator of nuclear factor 
kappa -B (RANK), on osteoclast precursors and mature osteoclasts promotes the terminal 
differentiation, activation, and survival of osteoclasts, which in turn stimulate bone resorption. 
Denosumab targets the process of bone resorptio n by [CONTACT_11327] a high degree of specificity  
and affinit y to RANKL, preventing the activation of RANK and thus, the stimulation of 
osteoclasts ( Sohn et al 2014 ). Due to its key  role in osteoclast activation, RANKL is instrum ental 
in facilitating osteoclast -induced bone resorption across a range of bone diseases.
1.1.2. TVB -009 and Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by  [CONTACT_11328]. Osteoporosis causes more than 8.9 million fractures annually  
worldwide, of which more than 4.5 million occur in the Americas and Europe ( World Health 
Organization [ WHO] 2004 ). According to the WHO diagnostic classification, os teoporosis is 
defined b y bone mineral density (BMD) at the hip or lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_11285]

Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_10778] deviations (SD)s below the mean BMD of a young -adult reference population 
(Cosman et al 2014 ).
Osteoporo sis in postmenopausal women and elderly  men has been linked to estrogen deficiency  
(Riggs 2000 ). Estrogen is critical for skeletal homeostasis and regulation of bone remodeling, in 
part, by  [CONTACT_11329]  (Streicher et al 2017 ). Current Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) -approved pharmacologic options for osteoporosis are bisphosphonates, 
calcitonin, estrogen agonist/antagonist, estrogens and/or hormone therap y, tissue -selective
estrogen complex, parathyroid hormone 1 -34, and RANK ligand inhibitor (denosumab) ( Cosman 
et al 2014 ).
TVB -009 is intended in the US for the same indications as PROLIA US and TVB -009 is 
intended in Europe for the same indicat ions as PROLIA EU. PROLIA is currentl y approved for 
treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture; treatment to 
increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis; treatment of glucocorticoid -induced osteoporosis; 
treatment of bone loss in men receiving androgen -deprivation therap y for prostate cancer; 
treatment of bone loss in women receiving adjuvant -aromatase -inhibitor therap y for breast 
cancer (US onl y) (PROLIA [LOCATION_002] Prescribing Information [USPI ] 2020 ; PROLIA 
Summary  of Product Characteristics [SPC] 2020 ).
1.1.3. Purpose of the Study
TVB -009 is a biosimilar candidate for PROLIA. The purpose of the study  is to compare the 
efficacy , safet y, and immunogenicity  of TVB -009P and PROLIA US in patients with 
postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO).
1.2. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies
1.2.1. Nonclinical Studies
Teva has addressed the nonclinical requirements in the development of TVB -009 as a biosimilar 
candidate to PROLIA in a sin gle-dose comparative study  with a 43 -day follow -up period in 
cynomolgus monkey s, under Good Laboratory  Practice (GL P). Results indicate similar safet y 
characteristics, pharmacody namics in terms of bone turnover biochemical markers, and exposure 
of the inve stigational medicinal products (IMP)s and support the safet y of the planned clinical 
trials.
Further information can be found in the current version of the TVB -009 Investigator’s Brochure 
(IB).
1.2.2. Clinical Studies
Clinical data for TVB -009P are available from a single study  (Study  TVB009 -BE-[ZIP_CODE]). This 
first-in-human study  was a randomized, double -blind, single -dose, parallel -group, 3 -arm stud y to 
investigate the pharmacokinetic, pharmacod ynamic, and safet y similarity of 60 mg TVB -009P 
versus 60 mg denosumab (PROLIA US and PROLIA EU) in healthy  subjects.
A total of 345 health y subjects were enrolled into the study  and randoml y assigned to receive a 
single subcutaneous ( sc) injection of
60 mg TVB -009P (115 subjects), or
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study TVB009 -IMB-[ZIP_CODE]
31A total of 106 subjects (31%) reported at least [ADDRESS_10779] 1 adverse event was slightly  lower in the TVB -009P 
group (27%) than in the PROLIA US (33%) and PROLIA EU (32%) groups.
There were no clinicall y meaningful differences observed between the treatment groups for 
adverse events, laboratory  tests, vital signs, e lectrocardiograms, and ph ysical examination 
findings. 
Most subjects (>95%) did not report an y injection site findings. The onl y finding reported for 
more than [ADDRESS_10780] was mild ery thema (surface diameter of 5 mm to ≤50 mm) at [ADDRESS_10781]-dose (12 sub jects [3%], 3 -5 subjects at each treatment group) and [ADDRESS_10782] -dose (3 
subjects [<1%]). No induration, warmth, swelling, or injection site pain was reported. 
A total of 3 subjects (<1%) had detectable antidrug antibodies (ADA) against denosumab. Two 
ofthese subjects (one in the PROLIA EU group, the other in the PROLIA US group) were ADA 
positive before and after study  drug administration. Their ADA titers were low and did not 
increase after study  drug administration. One subject in the PROLIA US group had an ADA 
response after stud y drug administration with a very low ADA titer at 2 time points (log 10titers 
of 1.6 and 1.5 for Day  15 and Day  29, respectivel y; the subject discontinued from the study after 
day 29).
Overall, the safet y profile of TVB -009P was similar to the safety  profiles of PROLIA US and 
PROLIA EU in the stud y. The safet y profile after administration of a single dose of TVB -009P 
in healthy  subjects was as expected based on the known safet y profile of PROLIA.
Further information can be fou nd in the current version of the TVB -[ADDRESS_10783](s)
TVB -009 is being developed as a biosimilar candidate to PROLIA and XGEVA . The safet y 
profile of TVB -009 is expected to be similar to that of PROLIA (see Section 1.3.2 ).
To date, no new identified or potential risks were observed in TVB -[ADDRESS_10784]
The identified and potential risks of PROLIA include: hy pocalcemia, osteonecrosis of the jaw, 
hypersensitivity  reactions, aty pi[INVESTIGATOR_11286], fracture 
healing complicati ons, serious infections, dermatologic adverse reactions, musculoskeletal pain, 
multiple vertebral fractures following discontinuation of treatment, suppression of bone turnover 
and reproductive toxicity  (PROLIA USPI  2020 ).
Additional information regarding benefits and risks to patients may  be found in the PROLIA EU 
SPC (2020).
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_10785] shown similarity  between the products.
In Stud y TVB009 -BE-[ZIP_CODE], TVB -009P  
 showed similar pharmacokinetics and similar pharmacod ynamic effects on bone 
metabolism compared to bot h PROLIA sourced from the US and PROLIA sourced from the EU 
(see Section 1.2.2 for details). Comparison of the safety and immunogenicity  between 
TVB -009P and PROLIA (US and EU) did not show any  clinicall y relevant differences.
In patients with PMO the risk of fracture is high, and the patients are likel y to derive significant 
benefit from a bone forming agent in clinical practice.
All patients in the study  will receive active osteoporosis treatment for 18 months, either PROLIA 
US or TVB -009P or both, which is expected to show no relevant clinical difference in efficacy  
and safet y compared to PROLIA.
The TVB -009P and PROLIA dosing schedule, ie, 60 mg ad ministered as a single sc injection 
once every  6 months, reflects the recommendation for PROLIA to treat postmenopausal women 
with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. Patients will be adequatel y supplemented with 
calcium and vitamin D.
The risks of tre atment with TVB -009P are expected to be similar to the known risks of treatment 
with denosumab. Patients will be undergo safety  monitoring and evaluation throughout the study  
as detailed in Section 7.

Primary Estimand: The primary  estimand assesses clinically  meaningful differences in 
effectiveness in patients with PMO, based on surrogate measures, focusing on the causal effects 
attributable to the IMP.
The primary  estimand is the difference in mean percent change in lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] -bone mineral 
density  (LS-BMD) from baseline at week [ADDRESS_10787] -baseline assessment of 
LS-BMD. For the submission in the US, this estimand is regarded as primary and for the 
submission in the European Union (EU), this estimand is regarded as co -primary .
The co -primary  estimand for the EU filing is the difference in mean percent change in sCTX -1 
from baseline at week 26, between TVB -009P and PROLIA UStreatment arms, regardless of 
intercurrent events in the target population of patients with PMO. The same anal ysis set will be 
used for both estimands and therefore patients who terminate before week 26 will not be 
included in the sCTX -1analy sis. For the EU submission, this estimand is regarded as 
co-primary . For the US submission, this estimand is regarded as secondary .

352.1.1. Justification of Primary Endpoint
The primary  endpoint of the study  is the percent change in L S-BMD from baseline to w eek 52. 
This primary  endpoint was agreed with FDA and European Medicines Agency  (EMA) as being 
sensitive enough to confirm that there is no relevant clinical difference in efficacy  between 
TVB -009P and PROLIA US. LS-BMD is a reliable, well -established, and reproducible measure 
of bone quality  and fracture resistance, and is reasonably  likel y to predict beneficial response to 
treatment with anti -osteoporosis drugs. The treatment duration of 52 weeks for the evaluation of 
LS-BMD is expected to be long enough to be able to evaluate comparability  of the 2 stud y 
medications.
The percent change from baseline in the biomarker sCTX -1 at week 26 is a co -primary  endpoint 
for EU submission. I n several clinical studies with denosumab it was demonstrated that sCTX -1 
suppression is an indicator of denosumab effectiveness, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_11330] ( Wang et al 2009 ). Week [ADDRESS_10788] evident at 6 months after start of treatment.

363. STUDY  DESIGN
3.1. General Study Design and Study Schematic Diagram
This is a randomized, double -blind, multinational, multic enter study  to demonstrate similar 
efficacy  and safet y of TVB -009P compared to PROLIA USadministered in 3 sc doses of 60 mg 
every  26weeks (3 injections) in patients with PMO. This study  will consist of a screening period 
(up to 4 weeks) and a [ADDRESS_10789] dose. After informed consent is 
obtained, eligibility  criteria will be reviewed and screening evaluations will be performed.
At baseline, patients will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_10790] 2 doses of TVB -009P or 
PROLIA US (“main treatment period"). The first dose of TVB -009P or PROLIA US will be 
administered following randomization. The second dose will be administered [ADDRESS_10791] dose.
At week 52 ([ADDRESS_10792] dose), patients in 
the PROLIA US arm will be re -randomized 1:[ADDRESS_10793] dose of study  drug.
Final procedures and assessments will be perf ormed at the end of stud y (EOS) visit at the end of 
the [ADDRESS_10794] early  termination (ET) procedures and assessments performed at their 
final visit. A pati ent who is randomized but does not complete all treatment periods will not be 
replaced . In case the assessment of L S-BMD is missing or not evaluable from more than 10% of 
the patients at the week [ADDRESS_10795] patient of the transition period.
Details of study  management during a COVID -19 outbreak are given in Appendix M.
The assessments and procedures performed during each stud y visit are detailed in Table 1
andAppendix B.
The study  schematic diagram is presented in Figure 1.
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_10796] of the study , serious adverse 
events will be reviewed (Section 7.1.5 )as they  are reported from the investigational centers to 
identify  safet y concerns.
The study  may  be terminated by  [CONTACT_11331]. For example, the 
sponsor should terminate the study  in the event of:
new toxicological or pharmacological findings or safet y issues that invalidate the 
earlier positive benefit -risk assessment
discontinuation of the development of the IMP
If the whole stud y or arms of the study  will be stopped, the patients who are terminat ed earl y will 
be followed according to Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures for the Patient (Section 4.3).
3.5. Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments
Study  procedures and assessments with their time points are presented in Table 1. Detailed 
descriptions of each method of procedures and assessments are provided in Section 6(efficacy  
and pharmacod yamics assessments), Section 7(safety  assessments), and Section 8

42pVital signs includes pulse rate, blood pressure (systolic/diastolic), and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. Before blood pressure and puls e are measured, the patient must rest in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_11287] 5 minutes. The same position and arm should be used each time vital signs are measured for a given patient. Forany abnormal vital signs value, the 
measurement should be repe ated as soon as possible. In the event of suspected severe hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis), vital signs, including o xygen saturation and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], will be measured.
qIn case of early termination, LS -BMD DXA, total hip and femoral neck BMD DXA, and lateral spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] X -ray will be assessed only in patients who terminate the study between 
the week 26 and week 52 visits. The minimum time between two DXA scans should be 3 months. These as sessments will not be performed for patients who terminate the study 
earlier than week 26 or during the transition period.
rThese scans will be unilateral only. For each patient, the same hip sh ould be scanned throughout the study.
sBlood sampling for sCTX -1 and P1NP assessment should be taken in the morning hours after overnight fasting. Samples should be collected consistently at the same time of the 
day for an individual patient at all visits. Vigorous exercise should be avoided the day prior to sampling.

Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_10800] be withdrawn from the stud y if any of the following events occur:
1.Patient withdraws con sent or requests withdrawal from the study  for any  reason.
2.Patient is noncompliant with the study  procedures and assessments in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070].
3.The sponsor requests withdrawal of the patient.
4.Patient experiences an adverse event or other m edical condition which indicates to the 
investigator that continued participation is not in the best interest of the patient, for 
example, but not limited to osteonecrosis of the jaw, aty pi[INVESTIGATOR_11289], serious infec tions, severe dermatologic adverse reactions or 
severe musculoskeletal pain.
Patients should be treated with standard of care and should be transitioned to another 
antiresorptive agent after withdrawal from or termination of the study  as appropriate.
Inves tigators should attempt to obtain information on patients in the case of withdrawal from the 
study . Results of an y evaluations and observations, together with a narrative describing the 
reason(s) for withdrawal from the study , must be recorded in the sourc e documents. The case 
report form (CRF) must document the primary  reason for withdrawal from the study .
If a patient experiences a BMD reduction of more than 7% from baseline at any time during the 
study , the investigator needs to discuss with the patient the implications for her fracture risk, 
alternative treatment options and the option for continuing in the study  and to document that 
discussion and the decision made. If alternative treatment is recommended further study  drug 
administration should be disc ontinued and every  effort should be taken to complete remaining 
study  visits in the main treatment period, regardless of the ty pe of alternative treatment chosen 
by [CONTACT_423].
If a patient exhibits clinical sy mptoms that may  indicate COVID -[ADDRESS_10801] of missing data.
If the reason for withdrawal from the stud y is an adverse event and/or clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory  test result (with clinical significance meaning an y variation in assessment 
results that has medical relevance and may result in an alteration in medical care [eg, active 
observation, diagnostic or therapeutic measures]), monitoring will be continued as applicable 
(eg, until the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health 
care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the test IMP/device or study  
procedure is made). The specific event or test result (including repeated test results, as 
applicable) must be recorded both on the source documentation and in t he CRF; both the adverse 
events page and the relevant page of the CRF will be completed at that time .
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study TVB009 -IMB-[ZIP_CODE]
47The patient will be monitored as applicable (eg, until the event has resolved or stabilized, until 
the patient is referred to the care of a health care pr ofessional, or until a determination of a cause 
unrelated to the test IMP/device or stud y procedure is made). The investigator must inform the 
sponsor’s medical expert [INVESTIGATOR_11407] e events. Additional reports must be provided when requested.
If a patient is withdrawn from the study  for multiple reasons that include also adverse events, the 
relevant page of the CRF should indicate that the withdrawal was related to an adverse event. An 
exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_11290] a 
prohibited medication, thereb y requiring discontinuation of t he patient. In such a case, the reason 
for discontinuation would be “need to take a prohibited medication”, not the adverse event.
In the case of patients lost to follow -up, attempts to contact [CONTACT_11333]’s medic al records and transcribed to the CRF.
4.4. Replacement of Patients
A patient who is randomized but does not complete all treatment periods will not be replaced. In 
case the assessment of LS -BMD is missing or not evaluable from more than 10% of the patients 
at the week 26 visit, the sponsor might decide to continue the recruitment of patients in order to 
increase the number of evaluable patients. 
4.5. Rescreening
A patient with a screening serum 25 hy droxy  (OH) vitamin D level ≤20ng/mL  may  be 
rescreened once to re -evaluate vitamin D level post repletion. Patients with albumin -adjusted 
serum calcium outside the normal range, as assessed by  [CONTACT_2237] , may  be rescreened 
once to re -evaluate calcium levels. I nformed consent obtained at the beginning of the s creening 
period also covers the partial rescreening for low vitamin D or for calcium; therefore 
reconsenting is not required.
4.6. Screening Failure
Screening failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study  but 
are not subs equently  randomized in the study .
Selected information about patients who fail screening will be collected to comply  with reporting 
and publishing requirements. This information may  include, but is not limited to, demography , 
screening failure details, eli gibility  criteria, and any  serious adverse events.

5.1.3. Non-Investigational Medicinal Product Supplementation Treatment
Patients will be instructed to take [ADDRESS_10803] 400 IU vitamin D daily  
from screening to week 78 (EOS). Calcium and vitamin D will be provided from local sources. 
If hypocalcemia is detected, and th ere is no additional underl ying reason, this should be further 
monitored and the below can be used for the corrective treatment: 
Mild to moderate hy pocalcemia ( ≥7.5 mg/dL , <8.4 mg/dL adjusted calcium): 
calcium, up to 3000 mg/day  (oral) at the discretion of the investigator 
Symptomatic hy pocalcemia or severe as ymptomatic hy pocalcemia (< 7.5 mg/dL 
adjusted calcium): intravenous calcium followed by  [CONTACT_11334]. 
In case of continuous s ymptomatic or severe as ymptomatic hypocalcemia the investigator should 
consider to postpone study drug administration by  a maximum of 2 months and should discuss 
the situation with the medical monitor.
If hypercalcaemia is detected, supplementation with calcium and vitamin D should be int errupted 
and calcium levels should be further monitored; severe h ypercalcaemia might be treated (eg, 
calcitonin or calcimimetics) at the discretion of the investigator. Patients will be allowed to 
continue treatment with study  drug.

Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study TVB009 -IMB-[ZIP_CODE]
505.1.4. Medical Devices
The med ical device for TVB -009P, manufactured by  [CONTACT_11335]:
PFS with an automatically activated needle safet y guard for single -use administration
This automatically  activated needle safet y guard requires no additional actions by  [CONTACT_11336], and thus reduces the potential for accidental needle stick injuries.
The medical device for PROLIA US, manufactured by  [CONTACT_11337], Inc. and provided for use in this 
study  is:
PFS with manually  activated needle safety  guar d for single -use administration
This manually  activated needle safet y guard requires the user to shield the needle after use.
Instructions for use of both devices are provided in the pharmacy manual.
All device -related adverse events, malfunctions etc. wil l be recorded; their impact relative to the 
safet y and tolerability of the I MP will be evaluated (see Section 7.2and Appendix H).
5.2. Preparation, Handling, Labeling, Storage, and Accountability for 
Investigational Medicinal Products
5.2.1. Storage and Security
The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained for all IMPs received and an y discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of 
the IMPs.
The IMPs (T VB-009P and PROLIA US) must be stored at a controlled temperature (2°C to 8°C 
[36°F to 46°F]) in a secure area (eg, locked refrigerator). The site should have a process for 
monitoring the storage temperature of unused IMP.
5.2.2. Labeling
Supplies of I MPs will be labeled according to the current ICH guidelines on GCP and Good 
Manufacturing Practice and will include any  locally  required statements. If necessary , labels will 
be translated into the local language.
5.2.3. Accountability
Each IMP shipment will include a packi ng slip listing the contents of the shipment, return 
instructions, and any  applicable forms.
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of IMPs and other study  materials 
from the sponsor are correctly  received, recorded, handled, and stor ed safely  and properl y in 
accordance with the CFR or national and local regulations, and used in accordance with this 
protocol.
Only  patients screened and subsequently  enrolled in the study  may  receive I MP/non -IMP and 
only authorized staff at the investiga tional center may  suppl y IMP/non -IMP or administer I MP. 
The pharmacist, designee or study  drug administrator is responsible for IMP /non-IMP
accountability , reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final 
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study TVB009 -IMB-[ZIP_CODE]
51disposition records) . At the end of the stud y, a declaration will be signed stating that no 
unblinding of blinded study  personnel occurred. 
A record of IMP /non-IMPaccountability  (ie, IMP, vitamin D and calcium supplements, and 
other study  materials received, used, retained, returned, or destro yed) must be prepared and 
signed b y the pharmacist, designee or stud y drug administrator, with an account given for an y 
discrepancies. Empty , partially  used, and unused IMP/ non-IMP will be disposed of or returned to 
Teva or its designee.
Further guidance and information are provided in the pharmacy  manual.
5.3. Justification for Investigational Medicinal Products
5.3.1. Justification for D ose of Test Investigational Medicinal Product
The dose of IMP to be evaluated in this double -blind study  (ie, 60 mg) was selected to match the 
approved dose for PROLIA.
5.3.2. Justification for Use of Reference Investigational Medicinal Product
TVB -009P is being developed as a potential biosimilar to the reference IMP, PROLIA. PROLIA 
US and PROLIA EU have been shown to be biosimilar in a previous 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacody namic similarity  study  (see Section 1.2.2 )–PROLIA US was 
selected as the reference IMP for this stud y.
5.4. Treatment After the End of the Study
After stud y end, no IMP will be provided as PROLIA is commercially available. Patients shou ld 
be further treated with denosumab or should be transitioned to another antiresorptive agent as 
appropriate.
5.5. Restrictions
Patients will be required to comply  with the following restrictions:
Patients must remain seated, semi -recumbent, or supi[INVESTIGATOR_11291] d for assessments or 
other procedures, including dosing.
Patients will fast overnight prior to the morning of blood sampling for sCTX -1 and 
P1NP assessment. Vigorous exercise should be avoided the day  prior to sampling.
Patients will fast overnight prior t o the morning of blood sampling for lipid profiling.
There are no other restrictions in this study .
5.6. Prior and Concomitant Medication or Therapy
See Section 4.1for patient inclusion and Section 4.2patient exclusion criteria.
Any prior or concomitant therapy , medication (including prior osteoporosis medication), or 
procedure a patient has had from 4 weeks before screening through the end of the study  will be 
recorded in the source documentation and in the CRF. Trade name [CONTACT_11413] (INN) (if available), indication, dose, an d start and end dates of the 
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study TVB009 -IMB-[ZIP_CODE]
52administered medication or treatment will be recorded. The sponsor will encode all therap y and 
medication according to the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary  (WHODrug Global ).
Prohibited and restricted medications are listed in Appendix F.
At each visit at the investigational center after the screening visit the investigator will ask 
patients whether they  have taken any  medications, including over -the-counter medications, 
vitamins, or herbal or nutritional supplements, since the previous visit.
Concomitant medication and treatment will be recorded until the ET/EOS visit.
5.7. Procedures for Monitoring Patient Compliance
The investigator will be responsible for monitoring patient compliance with this protocol from 
the start of the screening period through the transition period. If the investigator or the sponsor 
determines that the patient is not in compliance with the study  protocol, the investigator and the 
sponsor should determine whether the patient should be withdrawn from the study . The 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (I RB) should be notified if 
required b y local regulation.
5.8. Randomization and Blinding
This is a randomized, double -blind study . Patients and investigators will remain blinded to I MP 
assignment during the study .
At baseline, patients will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_10804] 2 doses o f TVB -009P or 
PROLIA US (“main treatment period”). The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_11338] (US/non -
US) and an y use of previous bisphosphonates (yes/no). At week 52, prior to receiving their third 
dose of study  medication, patients in the PROLIA US t reatment group will be re -randomized in a 
1:[ADDRESS_10805] dose of PROLIA US or switch to TVB -009P (“transition period”) to 
receive a single dose of TVB -009P. The re -randomization will be stratified by  [CONTACT_11338] (US/non -
US) and an y use of previous bisphosphonates (y es/no). All patients in the TVB -009P group will 
receive a third dose of TVB -009P at week 52.
During the main treatment period, the sponsor, investigators (and other site staff involved in 
study  assessments) and patients will be blinded t o the treatment assignment of all patients. To 
maintain blinding of the patients and investigators (and other site staff involved in study  
assessments) to the treatment assignment of all patients during the entire study , and maintain 
blinding of the sponso r until the main treatment period is unblinded, the re -randomization 
process will be performed for all patients, including the patients in the TVB -009P group 
(although onl y patients in the PROLIA US group will actually  be re -randomized while patients 
in the TVB -009P group will continue to receive TVB -009P in the transition period). The 
randomization will be implemented using Randomization and Trial Supply  Management 
(RTSM).
At the investigational center, only  the pharmacist or designee who will dispense the study  drug 
and the study  drug administrator will be unblinded. These staff will not participate in any  
efficacy , pharmacokinetic, pharmacody namic, immunogenicit y, and safet y assessments.
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_10806] Operating Procedure (SOP).
5.9.2. Blinding and Unblinding
The study  drug will be prepared in a separate room by  [CONTACT_11339] -blinded pharmacist or designee. 
The pharmacist or designee will place the respective original box into a neutral container that is 
suitable to maintain the blind. The original stud y drug box and s yringe will not be visible when 
the patient or an y other blinded study  team member enters the room since s tudy drug packaging 
and the s yringes differ among products. In order to ensure additional patient blinding, a blindfold 
with an additional pi[INVESTIGATOR_11292] (or similar device) will be used during the stud y drug 
injection to shield the study  drug from the patient. The investigator doing the safet y assessment 
will remain blinded to treatment assignment.
Staff responsible for pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity  bioanal ysis, population 
pharmacokinetics, and/or pharmacokinetics/pharmacody namics model will no t have access to the 
patient treatment randomization prior to unblinding the stud y.
During the transition period, the sponsor, investigators (and other site staff involved in study  
assessments) and patients will be blinded to the randomized treatment of pa tients who received 
PROLIA USin the main treatment period and are re -randomized for the transition period.
Before database lock (DBL), staff responsible for efficacy  and safet y analysis, pharmacokinetic 
and immunogenicit y bioanalysis, population pharmacok inetic anal ysis, and/or 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacody namic analy sis will not have access to the patient treatment 
randomization. After last patient last visit and DBL of the main treatment period, the sponsor 
will unblind the treatments for the anal ysis of th e main treatment period (up to and including 
week 52; not including third I MP dose and assessments following the third dose). A full CSR 
will be prepared with all data related to the first and second doses up to the week 52 end of main 
treatment phase proc edures. 
Only  after completion of the study  (after week 78) and DBL will the transition period be full y 
unblinded and anal yzed. The results will be reported separatel y in a CSR addendum, including 
any updates to the safet y analysis of the main treatment pe riod.
In case of an emergency , serious adverse event (see Section 7.1.5 ),or in cases when knowledge 
of the IMP assignment is needed to make treatment decisions, the investigator may  unblind the 
patient’s IMP assignment as deemed necessary , mainly  in emergency  situations. Individual 
randomization codes, indicating the IMP assig nment for each randomized patient, will be 
available to the investigator(s) or pharmacist(s) at the investigational center via the RTSM, both 
via telephone and internet. Breaking of the treatment code can alway s be performed by  [CONTACT_11340] b y the sponsor; however, the sponsor should be notified 
following the breaking of the treatment code. The patient's assignment should not be revealed to 
the sponsor.
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study TVB009 -IMB-[ZIP_CODE]
54When a blind is broken for safet y reasons, the patient will be withdrawn from the study  and the 
event will be recorded on the CRF. The circumstances leading to the breaking of the code should 
be fully  documented in the investigator’s study  files and in the patient’s source documentation. 
Assignment of IMP should not be recorded in a ny study  documents or source document.
In blinded studies, for an adverse event defined as a suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) (ie, reasonable possibility ; see Section 7.1.4 ), Global Patient Safety  and 
Pharmacovigilance (GPSP) may  independentl y request that the blind code be broken (on a 
case-by-case basis) to comply  with regulatory  requirements. The report will be provided in an 
unblinded manner for regulatory  submission. If this occurs, blinding will be maintained for the 
investigator and for other personnel involved in the conduct of the stud y, and anal ysis and 
reporting of the data.
5.9.3. Data Monitoring Committee

Patients will und ergo a lateral spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] X -ray for assessment of vertebral fractures by  [CONTACT_11344]. Nominally , vertebral fracture will be assessed in all vertebrae from the fourth 
thoracic vertebra (T4) to the fourth lumbar vertebra (L4). Any new fracture shou ld be reported as 
an adverse event (Section 7.1.2 ).
6.1.4. Assessment of Nonvertebral Fractures
Information about an y nonvertebral fractures and level of trauma causing the fracture during the 
study  will be recorded in the CRF. A cop y of radiograph s or other diagnostic confirming the 
fracture and/or a cop y of the report should be included in the patient’s study records. 
Additionally , any new fracture should be reported as an adverse event (Section 7.1.2 ).
6.2. Pharmacodynamics Assessment
Blood samples (4 mL) for assessment of sCTX -[ADDRESS_10808] IMP dose at the time 
points detailed in Table 1. Blood sampling for sCTX -1 and P1NP assessment should be taken in 
the morning hours after overnight fasting. Samples should be collected consistently  at the same 
time of the day  for an individual patient at all visits (see Appendix I). Vigorous exerc ise should 
be avoided the day  prior to sampling.
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_10809] results, vital sign 
measurements, ECG findings, ph ysical examination, and use of concomitant medication . Refer 
to Table 1for the timing of assessments and procedures.
All assessments scheduled for baseline (day  1), week 26 and week 52 visits, with the exception 
of local tolerability , will be completed before IMP administration on those days.
Adverse events are categorized by  [CONTACT_11345] (I SO) standard 
[ZIP_CODE]:2011(E).
Device deficiencies that are not associated with an a dverse event as well as those that have the 
potential to cause a serious adverse event are covered in Appendix H.
7.1. Adverse Events
7.1.1. Definition of an Adver se Event
An adverse event is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily  have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.
In this stud y, an y adve rse event occurring after the patient has signed the ICF through the end of 
the study  should be recorded and reported as an adverse event.
An adverse event can, therefore, be an y unfavorable and unintended ph ysical sign, s ymptom, or 
laboratory  parameter th at develops or worsens in severit y during the course of this study . 
Development of a new condition or the worsening of a pre -existing condition will be considered 
an adverse event, whether or not considered related to TVB -009P. Stable chronic conditions 
(such as arthritis) that are present before stud y entry and do not worsen during this study will not 
be considered adverse events.
Accordingl y, an adverse event can include an y of the following:
intercurrent illnesses
physical injuries
events possibly  relate d to concomitant medication (including study  provided 
medications)
significant worsening (change in nature, severit y, or frequency) of pre -existing 
conditions
(Note: A condition recorded as pre -existing that is intermittently  symptomatic [eg, 
headache] and that occurs during thisstudy  should be recorded as an adverse event)
drug interactions
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study TVB009 -IMB-[ZIP_CODE]
58events occurring during diagnostic procedures or during an y washout phase of this
study
laboratory  or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient 
from the study , are associated with clinical signs and sy mptoms or a serious adverse 
event, require medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up, or are considered b y 
the investigator to be clinically  significant. Note: Abnormal laboratory  test results at 
the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study  or receiving study  
treatment are not considered adverse events.
7.1.2. Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
For recording of adverse events, the study  period is defined for ea ch patient as the time period 
from signature [CONTACT_11414] y. The period for reporting treatment -emergent 
adverse events is defined as the period after the first dose of IMP is administered until the end of 
the study .
All adverse events that occur during the defined study  period must be recorded both on the 
source documentation and the CRF, regardless of the severit y of the event or judged relationship 
to the I MP. For serious adverse events, the serious adverse event form must be complete d and 
the serious adverse event should be reported within 24 hours of when the investigator becomes 
aware of the serious adverse event (Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 ).The investigator does not need to activel y 
monitor patients for adverse events after the stud y period defined above.
At each contact [CONTACT_10970], the investigator or designee must question the patient about 
adverse events b y asking an open -ended question such as “Have y ou had any  unusual sy mptoms 
or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe.” A precise diagnosis should be 
recorded whenever possible. When such a diagnosis is made, all related signs, s ymptoms, and 
any test findings will be recorded collectivel y as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a 
serious adverse event, on the serious adverse event form. Reported or observed signs and 
symptoms that are not manifestations of a known diagnosis should be reported i ndividually .
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until resolved, 
stabilized, or returned to baseline; or until the patient is referred for continued care to a health 
care professional; or until determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study  procedure is 
made.
The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action 
taken regarding IMP, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be 
recorded b oth on the source documentation and the CRF.
The relationship of each adverse event to the IMP, and the severity  and seriousness of each 
adverse event, as judged by  [CONTACT_093], must be recorded as described below.
7.1.3. Severity of an Adverse Event
The sev erity of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the following:
Mild: No limitation of usual activities
Moderate: Some limitation of usual activities
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study TVB009 -IMB-[ZIP_CODE]
59Severe: Inability  to carry  out usual activities
7.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Investigationa l Medicinal Product
The relationship of an adverse event to the IMP will be made according to the criteria in Table 3.
Table 3: The Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Investigational Medicinal 
Product
Term Definition Clarification
No reasonable 
possibility
(not related)This category applies to adverse 
events that, after careful 
consideration, are clearly due to 
extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc) or to adverse 
events that, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are 
evaluated, are judged to be unrelated 
to the IMP.The relationship of an adverse event may b e considered 
“no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly due to 
extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply:
It does not follow  a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the administration of the IMP.
It could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_11346]’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy administered to the patient.
It does not follow  a known pattern of response to the 
IMP.
It does not reappear or w orsen when the IMP is 
re-administered.
Reasonable 
possibility
(related)This category applies to adverse 
events for which, after careful 
medical consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, a connection with 
the administration of IMP cannot be 
ruled out with certainty.The relationship of an adverse event may be co nsidered 
“reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following 
apply:
It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the IMP.
It cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11347]’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the patient.
It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in 
dose. There are important exceptions when an 
adverse event does not disappear after 
discontinuation of the IMP, yet an IMP rela tionship 
clearly exists.
It follows a known pattern of response to the IMP.
IMP=investigational medicinal product.
7.1.5. Serious Adverse Events
For recording of serious adverse events, the stud y period is defined for each patient as the time 
period from signatu re of the I CF to the end of the study . Serious adverse events occurring in a 
patient after the end of the study  should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes 
aware of them, following the procedures described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 .
Further details are given in the Safety  Monitoring Plan.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at an y dose that results in any  of the 
following outcomes or actions:
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study TVB009 -IMB-[ZIP_CODE]
60results in death
is life -threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event); it does not refer to an event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], which 
means that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11294], or that they  occurred as a consequence of the event
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11295], unless there was worsening of the preexisting condition 
during the patient’s participation in this study .
Likewise, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11296] a social reason onl y (eg, the subject lives far away  and 
is allowed therefore to stay  in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11297]) will not be considered a serious 
adverse event.
results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (refers to a substantial 
disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions)
is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
an important medical event that may  not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may  jeopardize the patient and may  require medical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298]; or the 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse. Note: Any  suspected transmission of 
an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important medical event .
All occurrences of possible drug -induced liver injury  that meet Hy ’s law criteria, 
defined as allof the below, must be reported b y the investigator to the sponsor as a 
serious adverse event:
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increase of 
>3×the upper limit of normal (ULN)
total bilirubin incr ease of >2 ×ULN
absence of initial findings of cholestasis (ie, no substantial increase of alkaline 
phosphatase [AL P])
An adverse event that does not meet an y of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be 
regarded as a nonserious adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Expectedness
In this stud y, the reference safet y information (RSI) for TVB -009P for determination of a 
suspected serious adverse reaction is included in the IB. A serious adverse event that is not 
included in the relevant RSI  by [CONTACT_11348] y, severity, out come, or frequency  is considered an 
unexpected adverse event.
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study TVB009 -IMB-[ZIP_CODE]
61The RSI  of PROLIA US in this study  is the PROLIA USPI .
The sponsor’s GPSP will determine the expectedness for all serious adverse events.
For the purpose of S[LOCATION_003]R r eporting: if the patient is receiving TVB -009P, the version of the IB 
at the time of occurrence of the S[LOCATION_003]R will apply. If the patient is receiving PROLIA US, the 
PROLIA USPI [INVESTIGATOR_11299].
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Investigator Responsibility
To satisfy  regulatory  requirements, all serious adverse events that occur during the study , 
regardless of judged relationship to administration of the IMP, must be reported to the sponsor 
by [CONTACT_093]. The event must be reported within [ADDRESS_10810] not be delay ed, 
even if not all the information is available. The inves tigator does not need to activel y monitor 
patients for adverse events once this study  has ended.
Serious adverse events occurring to the patient after the end of the study  (or earl y termination, 
whichever applies) for that patient should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes 
aware of them .
The serious adverse event form should be sent to the local safet y officer (LSO) or designee (a 
Contract Research Organization [CRO] in a country  without a sponsor LSO) (contact
[CONTACT_11349]); the L SO will 
forward the report to the sponsor’s GPSP.
In addition to the serious adverse event term, the following information should be provided to 
record the event accurately  and completel y:
study  number
investigator and investigational center identification
patient number
onset date and detailed description of adverse event
investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the IMP (no 
reasonable possibility , reasonable possibility , asdescribed in Table 3)
Additional information includes:
age and sex of patient
date of first dose of IMP
date and amount of last administered dose of IMP
action taken
outcome, if known
severit y
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study TVB009 -IMB-[ZIP_CODE]
62explanation of assessment of relatedness
concomitant medication (including study  provided medications; dates, doses, routes 
of administration, doses and dosing regimens)
treatment for the event (in the narrative sect ion)
pertinent laboratory  or other diagnostic test data
medical history
results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if known
for an adverse event resulting in death
cause of death (whether or not the death was related to I MP)
autopsy  findings (if available)
Each report of a serious adverse event will be reviewed and evaluated by  [CONTACT_11350] I MP.
In addition, the investigator will assess whether the etiology  of the event is associated with the 
patient's primary  condition, concomitant study  medications (including study  provided 
medications), study  procedures, or underl ying disease or an y other condition.
Additional information (follow -up) about an y serious adverse event un available at the initial 
reporting should be forwarded b y the investigator within 24 hours of when it becomes known to 
the same address as the initial report.
For all countries, the sponsor’s GPSP will distribute the Council for International Organizations
of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) form/Extensible Markup Language (XML) file or MedWatch of 
serious adverse events to the L SO/CRO for submission to the competent authorities, I EC/IRBs, 
and investigators, according to local regulations. The investigator must ens ure that the IEC/IRB 
is also informed of the event, in accordance with national and local regulations.
The sponsor’s GPSP will submit the XML  of S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the EMA in an unblinded manner, 
when applicable and according to local regulations. Submission of SUS ARs to the FDA using 
MedWatch forms is done in an unblinded manner by  [CONTACT_11351] L SO.
For S[LOCATION_003]Rs occurring during the treatment period, only  the LSO/unblinded personnel from the 
CRO will receive the unblinded re port for regulatory  submission; the others will receive a 
blinded report. If S[LOCATION_003]Rs occur after the treatment period, the sponsor will also receive an 
unblinded copy  of the report.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Sponsor Responsibility
If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the IMP or study  procedures, 
the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify  all investigators participating in sponsored 
clinical studies of TVB -009P and the appropriate competent authorities (and I EC/IRB, as 
appropriate).
In addition to notify ing the investigators and competent authorities (and IEC/IRB, as 
appropriate), other action may  be required, including the following:

modify ing the existing co nsent form and informing all stud y participants of new 
findings
modify ing listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newl y identified as 
related to TVB -009P
7.1.6. Protocol -Defined Adverse Events of Special Interest
No protocol -defined adverse even ts of special interest are identified for this study .
7.1.7. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency , deviations from the protocol 
may be allowed on a case -by-case basis. To ensure patient safety , after the event has stabilized or 
treatmen t has been administered (or both), the investigator or other phy sician in attendance must 
contact [CONTACT_11353]. The investigator, in 
consultation with the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in 
the study .
7.2. Adverse Device Effects
An adverse device effect is an adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical 
device or a combination product. This includes a dverse events resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deplo yment, implantation, installation, operation, or an y 
malfunction of the investigational medical device, including an y event resulting from user error 
or from intentional mis use of the investigational medical device.
7.2.1. Adverse Device Effect Reporting
Adverse device effects ( Figure 2)must be recorded both on the source documentation and the 
CRF .
All adverse device effects shall be reviewed b y the investigator, the medical monitor, and the 
sponsor. The investigator and sponsor will record all relevant information regarding every  
adverse device effect/serious adverse devic e effect and will categorize each as guided in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
The investigator should make an initial determination if the adverse event may  be relat ed to a 
device deficiency . 
Adverse device effects and device deficiencies will be listed in the CSR.
7.2.2. Serious Adverse Device Effects
A serious adverse device effect is an adverse device effect that has resulted in any  of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).

At screening, women will have a serum FSH assessment, as applicable, to confirm 
postmenopausal status.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Estradiol
At screening, women will have a serum E2 assessment, as applicable, to confirm postmenopausal 
status.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urine Pregnancy Test
At day  1 (prior to randomization), a pregnancy  test (urine dipstick) will be done to confirm that 
women are not pregnant.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Vitamin D
At screening, and at visits 6, 7, 9, 12, and EOS women will have a serum 25 (OH) vitamin D 
assessment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Coronavirus Disease 2019 Testing
COVID -19 testing will be performed at screening. I n addition, if a patient exhibits clinical 
symptoms after entering the study  that may  indicate infection, the patient should be tested for 
COVID -19.
COVID -19 testing will be performed locall y (if available), or centrall y (if not available locall y) 
and reported in the CRF.
7.4. Physical Examinations
Physical examinations (will include, as a minimum, height in centimeters and weight in 
kilograms, and examination of head, ey es, ears, nose, and throat [HEENT], oral cavit y, chest, 
cardiovascular s ystem, abdomen, and skin ) will be performed at the time points detailed in
Table 1. Oral examination will be performed to exclude risks for osteonecrosis of the jaw. If 
required b y local authorities, a mandible radiograph may  be carried out at screening.
Any physical examination finding that is judged by  [CONTACT_11357] 
(except at the initial screening visit, which will be captured as medical history ) will be 
considered an adverse event, recorded on the CRF, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2 .
7.5. Vital Signs
Vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure [sy stolic/diastolic], and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842]) will be measured 
at the time points detailed in Table 1. All vital sign results outside of the reference ranges will be 
judged b y the investigator as belonging to one of the following categories:
abnormal and not clinically  significant
abnormal and clinic ally significant
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_10811] 5 minutes. The same position and arm should be used each time vital signs are 
measured for a given patient. Forany abnormal vi tal signs value, the measurement should be 
repeated as soon as possible. Any  vital signs value that is judged by  [CONTACT_11358] y 
significant will be recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF as an adverse event, 
and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2 .
7.6. Electrocardiography
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at the time points detailed in Table 1.
The ECG will be interpreted locally  by [CONTACT_458] (or qualified phy sician). All 
ECG results will be judged by  [CONTACT_093] (or qualified phy sician) as belonging to one of the 
following categories:
abnormal and not clinically  signi ficant
abnormal and clinically  significant
Any ECG finding that is judged by  [CONTACT_093] (or qualified ph ysician) as clinically  
significant (except at the screening visit) will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the 
source documentation and i n the CRF, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2 .
7.7. Assessment of Local Tolerability and Pain
Local tolerability  at the injection site ( erythema, ecchy mosis, induration, tenderness, warmth, 
and swelling, and pain) will be assessed, using standardized scales. Patient reported pain at the 
injection site will be reported using a standardized 11 -point pain intensity  numerical response 
scale (N RS-11) where 0 is “No pain” and 10 is “Worst possible pain”, and patients will be asked 
to respond to the following question: “How much pain do y ou feel at the drug injection site?”.
The assessments will be performed 1hour±10 minutes after IMP administrat ion (Table 1).
Severity  of local tolerability  symptoms should be assessed as described in Table 5. Ery thema, 
ecchymosis, and induration will be considered only  if they  reach a diameter of at least 5 mm. 
The surface diameter in millimeters should be recorded and ery thema, induration, and 
ecchymosis at the i njection site will be graded according to the diameter measurements: Absent, 
5mm to ≤50mm (mild), >50 to ≤100 mm (moderate), and >100 mm (severe). Induration must 
be assessed b y careful superficial palpation avoiding pressuring or squeezing the injection site.
In the case that sy mptoms do not resolve, assessments will proceed as long as the patient remains 
at the study  center, and thereafter at each ambulatory  visit. Appropriate treatment may  be 
provided if necessary , in which case it must be recorded as concomitant medication.

Injection site findings will not be captured as adverse events unless they  fulfill characteristics 
that are bey ond those in the specified forms/scales (eg, necrosis, abscess, etc) or fulfill 
seriousness criteria and then they  must be recorded and reported as specified in Section 7.1.2 .
7.8. Pregnancy
This study  is conducted in postmenopausal women. However, any  female patient becoming 
pregnant during the study  will discontinue IMP and will be discontinued from the study . The 
process for reporting a pregnancy  is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event but 
using the pregnancy  form. Pregnant patients will be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy  
(including spontaneous, electiv e, or voluntary  abortion). If the pregnancy  continues to term, the 
outcome (health of the infant up to 8 weeks of age), including details of birth and presence or 
absence of an y birth defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications,
will be reported to the sponsor. Any  complication of pregnancy  will be reported as an adverse 
event or serious adverse event, as appropriate.
7.9. Medication Error and Special Situations Related to the 
Investigational Medicinal Products
Any administration of I MP that is not in accordance with the study  protocol should be reported 
as a protocol deviation and in the patients’ source documents, regardless of whether or not an 
adverse event occurs as a result.
The following are t ypes of medication errors and specia l situations:

708. ASSESSMENT OF PHARMACOKINETICS AND 
IMMUNOGENICITY
8.1. Pharmacok inetic Assessment
Blood samples (4 mL) will be collected via venipuncture or indwelling catheter before and up to 
78 weeks after TVB -009P or PROLIA US administration at the time points detailed in Table 1
for measurements of serum concentration of TVB -009P and PROLIA US. The dates and times of 
IMP administration and the date and time point (24 -hour clock time) of each pharmacokinetic 
sample will be recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF. 
Samples will be analy zed for concentration of TVB -009P and PROLIA US using an appropriate 
validated method. Incurred sample reanal ysis may  be performed (see Appendix I).
Details on sample handling, storage, shipment, and anal ysis are given in the pharmacy  manual.
8.2. Immunogenicity Testing
Blood samples (5 mL) for assessment of ADA response will be collected via venipuncture or 
indwelling catheter bef ore and up to [ADDRESS_10812] ADA samples when a severe h ypersensitivity  
reaction (eg, anaph ylaxis) is suspected, serious adverse event, or immunogenicity -related adverse 
event is observed as close to onset of the event as possible, resolution of event, and 30 days 
following th e event onset, if possible.
When a number of assessments are to be conducted at the same time point, the immunogenicit y 
blood sample should be taken after other assessments but before IMP administration. The dates 
and times of IMP administration and the da te and time point of each immunogenicity  sample will 
be recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF.
The detection and characterization of antibodies to TVB -009P and PROLIA US will be 
performed using validated methods by  [CONTACT_11360] ( Appendix A). Immunogenicit y 
assessment by  [CONTACT_11361] , employ ing a 3 -tiered approach. Briefl y, all samples will be screened for ADA 
using bridging enzy me-linked immunosorbent assay  (ELISA) with labeled TVB -009P, the 
screening positive samples will be anal yzed in a confirmatory  assay , and the confirmed ADA 
positive samples will be tested for antibod y titer determination. The characterization of 
confirmed ADA positive samples will include analysis for neutralization potential.
Samples may  be stored if permitted by  [CONTACT_11362]’s last 
visit for the study  to enable potential reanaly sis of immune responses to TVB -009P 
(see Appendix J).

739.3. Data Handling Conventions
For all descriptive statistics, only  the observed data from the patients will be used.
9.3.1. Handling Withdrawals and Missing Data
Miss ing L S-BMD or sCTX -1 assessments (either due to withdrawal from the study  or for other 
reasons) are assumed to be missing at random (MAR) in this efficacy  and safet y biosimilar study 
in PMO.
The mITT analy sis set will be used for the primary anal ysis. This analysis set includes only  
patients that had at least [ADDRESS_10815]- baseline evaluation of L S-BMD (see Section 9.2.2 ), ie, reached 
week 26; the drop -out rate prior to week 26 is assumed to be low,  Underly ing assumptions 
are that the drop -out rate prior to week 26 will be similar in both treatment groups, and that 
drop-outs are not related to efficacy . As both treatment groups are active, and improvemen t in 
the underl ying disease is not expected to be felt by [CONTACT_102], these assumptions are considered 
reasonable. The assumption that drop -out rates are comparable between the treatment groups will 
be assessed using descriptive statistics (see Section 9.4.1 ).
In the primary  anal ysis, missing L S-BMD at week [ADDRESS_10816]- baseline 
assessments using multiple imputation under the MAR assumption (see Section 9.5.4 ); this is a 
conservative approach for similarity  testing, as missing data will be imputed within each 
treatment group s eparately .
Since the mITT anal ysis set includes only  patients that reached at least week 26, missing sCTX-1 
at week 26 is expected to be negligible and will not be imputed. 
Sensitivity  and supplementary  anal yses for missing data in the primary  analy sis ar e presented in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
9.3.2. Handling Below the Limit of Quantitation
sCTX -1 and P1NP v alues below limit of quantitation ( BLQ) will be imputed by  [CONTACT_11363] (LLOQ); 0.033 ng/mL for sCTX -1 and 1.0 ng/mL for P1NP ). 
Sensitivity  analy sis for BLQ imputation in the analy sis of sCTX -1 percent change from baseline 
at week 26 is presented in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
9.4. Study Population
The ITT anal ysis set (Section 9.2) will be used for all study  population summaries unless 
otherwise specified. Summaries will be presented by  [CONTACT_11364].
9.4.1. Patient Disposition
The number of patients screened, patients screened but not randomized, and patients in the main 
treatment period and the transition period will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
For the main treatment period, the summary will include : patients randomized (I TT anal ysis set), 
patients in the mI TT, safety , and PP analy sis sets, patients that withdraw up to week 26, patients 
that withdraw after week 26, and patients that complete the main treatment period.

If more than 10% of the patients withdraw from the study  before the end of the main treatment 
period, the number of day s until study  disco ntinuation will be anal yzed using Kaplan -Meier 
methodology . In case of imbalance in withdrawal rates between treatment groups, further 
analysis to explore if the imbalance can be attributed to differences in baseline characteristics 
may be conducted as deemed necessary . 
9.4.2. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Patient demographic and baseline characteristics, including but not limited to, medical history , 
prior medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and ECG findings, will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics.
9.5. Efficacy and Pharmacodynamic Analysis
The m ITT analysis set will be used as the primary anal ysis set for efficacy  and 
pharmacod ynamics anal ysis in the main treatment period. T he ITT and PP analy sis sets will be 
used for supplementary  analy ses.
The TmITT analy sis set will be used as the primary  anal ysis set for efficacy  and 
pharmacod ynamics in the transition period.

BLQ will be imputed as the LLOQ. Sensitivity  analy ses for this imputation will be performed as 
follows:
two-dimensional tippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] -point: f or the anal ysis of sC TX-1 percent change from 
baseline at week 26, sensitivity  anal ysis for the BLQ imputation will be conducted by  
[CONTACT_11366] -009P 
group and the PROLIA US group, in the range of 0 to LLOQ (0.03 3 ng/mL).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supplementary Analysis for the Primary Analysis
Supplementary  anal yses to evaluate effect of assumptions on missing data on the results:
two-dimensional tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300] (missing not at random [MNAR]): in order to assess 
the sensitivity  of the prima ry anal ysis to the MAR assumption on missing data for 
patients that have at least [ADDRESS_10817] -baseline value, supplementary  analy sis for the 
primary  anal ysis will be conducted using multiple imputation under MNAR 
assumption. I n this anal ysis, missing L S-BMD per cent change from baseline at 
week 52 will be imputed using the same predictive mean matching multiple 
imputation method as in the primary  anal ysis, adjusted under MNAR assumption: 
the percent change from baseline in L S-BMD at week [ADDRESS_10818] no missing 
value (where δ 1= 0 to 2% or estimated treatment effect the TVB -009P group, 
whichever is higher);
the percent change from baseline in L S-BMD at week [ADDRESS_10819] no missing 
value (where δ 2= 0 to 2% or e stimated treatment effect the PROLIA US group, 
whichever is higher);
The resulting complete, imputed datasets will each be anal yzed using the same model 
as the primary  anal ysis model, and the resulting statistics combined using 
methodology  provided by  [CONTACT_11367] n(1987 )and L ittle and Rubin (2002 ).

77to further alleviate the concern on the uncertainty  introduced by  [CONTACT_11368], the 
following 2 separate 1 -sided tests of alpha=0.05 with missing data imputed under the 
corresponding null using a multiple imputation method will be conducted:
in the first test, missing values for the TVB -009P group will be imputed under the 
non-inferiorit y null (the lower boundary  of the equivalence margin, -1.45%) for 
testing w hether it is non -inferior to PROLIA US; 
in the second test, missing values for the TVB -009P group will be imputed under 
the non -superiorit y null (+1.45%) for testing whether it is non -superior to 
PROLIA US. 
The resulting complete, imputed datasets will e ach be anal yzed using the same model 
as the primary  anal ysis model, and the resulting statistics combined using 
methodology  provided by  [CONTACT_11369] (1987 )and L ittle and Rubin (2002 ).

789.6. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity
Formal statistical anal ysis of similarity  will be performed onl y on the following endpoints: 
(1)percent change from baseline to week 52 in LS -BMD
(2)percent change from baseline in sCTX -1 at week 26
For the U S filing, percent change from baseline to week 52 in LS -BMD is the primary  endpoint. 
Percent change from baseline in sCTX -1 at week 26 is a secondary  endpoint. For this 
submission, the percent change from baseline in sCTX -1 at week 26 will be tested only  if the 
primary  endpoint was found to be statistically  similar (ie, met the similarity criteria).
For the EU submission, percent change from baseline in L S-BMD at week 52 and percent 
change from baseline in sCTX -1 at week 26 are co -primary  endpoints. For thi s submission, 
success will be declared if similarity  is demonstrated for both co -primary  endpoints.
The anal ysis of all other endpoints will be descriptive, therefore no control for multiplicity  is 
needed.

105APPENDIX C.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations
Protocol Amendments
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a written amendment by  [CONTACT_11390] 
(IEC)/ Institutional Review Board (IRB) and national and local competent authorities, as 
applicable , except when necessary  to address immediate safety  concerns to the pati ents or when 
the change involves onl y logistics or administration. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11308], the coordinating investigator (if applicable), and the sponsor will sign the 
protocol amendment.
Important Protocol Deviations
Any deviation from the protocol that affects, to a significant degree, (a) the safet y, ph ysical, or 
mental integrit y of the patients in the study  and/or (b) the scientific value of the study  will be 
considered an important protocol deviation . Important pro tocol deviations may include 
non-adherence on the part of the patient, the investigator, or the sponsor to protocol -specific 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, primary  objective variable criteria, or good clinical practice 
(GCP) guidelines; noncompliance to investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration; use 
of prohibited medications. I mportant protocol deviations will be identified and recorded by  
[CONTACT_11391]. All important protocol deviations will be reported to the 
responsible IEC/I RB, as required.
When an important protocol deviation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to 
withdraw the patient from the study  or permit the patient to continue in the study , with 
documented approval from the medical expert. The decisio n will be based on ensuring the safety  
of the patient and preserving the integrit y of the study.
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency , deviations from the protocol 
may be allowed on a case -by-case basis. To ensure patient safety , after the event has stabilized or 
treatment has been administered (or both), the investigator or other ph ysician in attendance must 
contact [CONTACT_11392]. The investigator, in consultation with 
the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in the study .
Changes in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the protocol are notprospectivel y granted b y 
the sponsor. If investigational center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol 
inclusion and exclusion criteria was entered in a study , they  must immediately  inform the 
sponsor of the important protocol deviation. If such patient has alr eady  completed the study  or 
has withdrawn earl y, no action will be taken but the deviation will be recorded.
Information to Study Personnel
The investigator is responsible for giving information about the study  to all personnel members 
involved in the stud y or in any element of patient management, both before starting the stud y and 
during the course of the study  (eg, when new personnel become involved). The investigator must 
ensure that all stud y personnel are qualified b y education, experience, and trainin g to perform 
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_10839] be listed on the investigational center 
authorization form, which includes a clear description of each personnel member’s 
responsibilities. This list must be updated throughout the study ,as necessary .
The study  monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study  personnel, including the 
investigator, and for ensuring they  comply  with the protocol.
Study Monitoring
To ensure compliance with GCP guidelines, the study  monitor or representative is responsible 
for ensuring that patients have signed the informed consent form (I CF) and the study  is 
conducted according to applicable SOPs, the protocol, and other written instructions and 
regulatory  guidelines.
The study  monitor is the p rimary  association between the sponsor and the investigator. The main 
responsibilities of the study  monitor are to visit the investigator before, during, and after the 
study  to ensure adherence to the protocol, that all data are correctl y and completely  recorded and 
reported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before they  
participate in the stud y and when changes to the consent form are warranted, in accordance with 
IEC/IRB approvals.
The study  monitor will contact [CONTACT_11393]. The study  monitor will be permitted to review and verify  the various 
records (case report forms [CRF]s and other pertinent source data records, including specific 
electronic sou rce document relating to the study ) to verify  adherence to the protocol and to 
ensure the completeness, consistency , and accuracy  of the data being recorded.
As part of the supervision of study  progress, other sponsor personnel may , on request, 
accompan y the study  monitor on visits to the investigational center. The investigator and 
assisting personnel must agree to cooperate with the study  monitor to resolve any  problems, 
errors, or possible misunderstandings concerning the findings detected during the cou rse of these 
monitoring visits or provided in follow -up written communication.
For COVID -[ADDRESS_10840] operating procedures (SOP)s, GCP guidelines, and applicable regulatory  
requirements. The sponsor’s Global Clinical Quality  Assurance, independent of Global Specialty  
Development, is responsible for determining the need for (and timing of) an investigational 
center audit.
The investigator must accept that competent authorities and sponsor representatives may  conduct 
inspections and audits to verify  comp liance with GCP guidelines.

110APPENDIX G.CLINICAL CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSING 
ANAPHYLAXIS
As detailed b y Sampson et al 2006 , anaph ylaxis is broadly  defined as, “a serious allergic reaction 
that is rapid in onset and may  cause death.” Diagnostic criteria defined by  [CONTACT_11396]/Food Allergy  and Anaphy laxis Network during the second 
symposium on the definition and management of anaphy laxis, modified from Sampson et al 
2006 , are as follows:
Anaph ylaxis is highly  likely  when any  1 of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled:
1.Acute ons et of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue, 
uvula) and at least 1 of the following:
respi[INVESTIGATOR_11310] (eg, dy spnea, wheeze -broncho spasm, stridor, reduced 
peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_11311] [PEF], hy poxemia)
reduced blood pressure or associated s ymptoms of end -organ d ysfunction (eg, 
hypotonia [collapse], sy ncope, incontinence)
2.Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_11312] a likelyallergen for 
that patient (minutes to several hours):
involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen 
lips-tongue -uvula)
respi[INVESTIGATOR_11310] (eg, dy spnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced 
PEF, hy poxemia)
reduce d blood pressure (BP) or associated s ymptoms (eg, h ypotonia [collapse], 
syncope, incontinence)
persistent gastrointestinal sy mptoms (eg, crampy  abdominal pain, vomiting)
3.Reduced BP after exposure to a known allergen for that patient (minutes to several 
hours):
adults: sy stolic BP of <90 mmHg or >30% decrease from that person’s baseline
In the event of suspected severe h ypersensitivity  (including anaphy laxis), vital signs, including 
oxygen saturation and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], will be measured. Other assessments will be performed at 
the discretion of the investigator.
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_10843] Complaints/Device Deficiency
A clinical product complaint is defined as a problem or potential problem with the phy sical 
quality  or characteristics of clinical in vestigational medicinal product (IMP) supplies or clinical 
device supplies used in a clinical research stud y sponsored b y Teva. Examples of a product 
complaint include but are not limited to:
suspected contamination
questionable stability  (eg, color change , flaking, crumbling, etc.)
defective components
missing or extra units (eg, primary  container is received at the investigational center 
with more or less than the designated number of units inside)
incorrect packaging, or incorrect or missing labeling/lab els
device not working correctly  or appears defective in some manner
Each investigational center will be responsible for reporting a possible clinical product 
complaint/device deficiency  by [CONTACT_11397] g it to [EMAIL_204] within [ADDRESS_10844] (CP) or other retrievable item, it is 
required that the device/CP (or item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing 
whenever possible. For complaints involving an IMP, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of 
the patient’s IMP supply ) should be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever 
possible.
Product Complaint Information Needed from the Investigational Center
In the event that the product complaint form cannot be completed, the investigator will provide 
the following information, as available:
investigational center number and principal investigator [CONTACT_2300]
name, phone number, and address of the source of the complaint
clinical protocol number
patient identifier (patient study  number) and corresponding visit numbers, if 
applicable
patient number for double -blind studies
product available for return: Yes/No
product was ta ken or used according to protocol: Yes/No
description or nature of complaint
associated serious adverse event or serious adverse device event: Yes/No
Efficacy /Safet y Study –Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study TVB009 -IMB-[ZIP_CODE]
112device deficiency  that could lead to a serious adverse event: Yes/No
clinical supplies unblinded (for blin ded studies): Yes/No
date and name [CONTACT_11415]: Reporting a product complaint/device deficiency  must not be delay ed even if not all the 
required information can be obtained immediatel y. Known information must be reported 
immediat ely. The sponsor will collaborate with the investigator to obtain any  outstanding 
information.
Handling of Investigational Medicinal Product(s) and Devices at the Investigational 
Center(s)
The investigator is responsible for retaining the product or device in question in a location 
separate from the investigator’s clinical stud y supplies. The sponsor may  request that the 
investigator return the product for further evaluation and/or anal ysis. If this is necessary , the 
clinical study  monitor or designee will provide the information needed for returning the 
IMP/device.
If it is determined that the investigational center must return all I MP/devices, the sponsor will 
provide the information needed to handle the return.
The integrity  of the randomization code and corresponding blinded clinical supplies will be 
maintained whenever possible. A serious adverse event or the potential for a product quality  
problem existing bey ond the scope of the complaint may  be a reason to unblind the clinical 
supplies for an affected patient.
Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint
If there is an adverse event or serious adverse event due to product complaint, the protocol 
should be followed for recording and reporting (Section 7.1.2 and Section [IP_ADDRESS] , respectivel y).
Documenting a Product Complaint
The investigator will record in the source documentation a description of the product complaint, 
the initial determination if the deficiency  could have led to a serious adverse event, and any  
actions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safet y of the patient. Once the 
complaint has been investigated b y the sponsor and the investigator, if necessary , an event 
closure letter may  be sent to the investigational center where the complaint originated or to all 
investigational centers using the product or device.
Medical device incidents, including those resulting from malfunctions of the device, must be 
detected, documented, and reported b y the investigator throughout the study.
1.Assessment of Device Performance 
Device performance will be a ssessed b y device deficiencies and product complaints.
A device deficiency  is any  inadequacy  of an investigational medical device with respect to its 
identity , quality , durability , reliability , safet y, or performance that has not led to an adverse event 
(Figure 3). This definition includes malfunctions, use errors, inadequate labeling 
(eg,unintelligible label, incorrect expi[INVESTIGATOR_11313]).

120APPENDIX M.MANAGEMENT OF STUDY ACTIVITIES DURING 
COVID -19 OUTBREAKS
This appendix is to address the modifications to the protocol that will be effective during 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) outbreaks that affect the con duct of the study . When the 
situation at specific sites/countries allows the return to regular stud y activities, this appendix will 
be void for those sites/countries.
Section 3.1.General Study Design and Study Schematic Diagram; Section 3.5. Schedule of 
Study Procedures and Assessments
In the event of an emergency  situation (eg, COVID -19 outbreaks), in case a patient cannot return 
to the clinic for t he scheduled visits (eg, due to quarantine, isolation, patient’s concern, active 
COVID -19 infection, or closure of the site clinic) remote assessment of safety  via telephone 
and/or videoconference (VC), with VC being the preferred method, may  be allowed. 
Modifications to other procedures and assessments, electrocardiogram (ECG), laboratory  sample 
collection (including pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity , and pharmacodynamics, etc.) might be 
performed per implemented contingency  measures according to sponsor i nstructions and the 
corresponding manual. For example, if central laboratory  samples cannot be collected for safet y 
assessments, sites may  have patients visit a local reference laboratory  or dispatch a home health 
nurse to perform the assessments, but only after consultation with the sponsor, see Sections [ADDRESS_10849] these blood samples, but only  after co nsultation with the 
sponsor, see Sections 7 and Sections 7.4 -7.8 below for details. The sa me collection process and 
equipment will be used in these circumstances. 
For dual -energy  X-ray absorptiometry  (DXA) and X -ray procedures, see Section [ADDRESS_10850] (IMP) may  be administered according to the 
schedule outlined in the protocol by  [CONTACT_11405], or home care service providers 
trained according to study specifications, via visits to the patient's plac e of residence. The 
patient's consent to the home visit will be collected in advance. The IMP will be transported, 
prepared, and administered in a blinded fashion per the conditions specified in the pharmacy  
manual and the injection instructions.
If the pa tient does not continue in the study  due to site closure, the patient status should be NOT 
COMPL ETED DUE TO: Other COVID -19 logistical reasons prevented patient's continuation in 
the study .
These measures will be implemented on a case -by-case basis, and on ly when and where they  are 
warranted due to the emergency  situation. Preferably , the original protocol instructions will be 
followed whenever the new instructions are not required.
Section 4.3.Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures for the Patient
If a patient exhibits clinical sy mptoms that may  indicate COVID -19 infection after entering the 
study , the patient should be tested for active COVID -19. If the patient tests positive for active

121COVID -19, she may  continue for scheduled visits when recovered (ie, tests negative for active 
COVID -19).
Section 6. Assessment of Efficacy
In the event of an emergency  situation (eg, COVID -19 outbreaks ), in case a patient cannot return 
to the clinic/site for the scheduled visits (eg, due to quarantine, isolation, patient’s concern, 
active COVID -19 infection, or closure of the site clinic), DXA and X -ray procedures should be 
performed if the responsible location is not affected by  [CONTACT_11406]. If the responsible 
location used for DXA and X -ray cannot be visited due to special circumstances it should be 
evaluated if another location might be used after consultation and approval by  [CONTACT_456].
These measures will be implemented on a case -by-case basis, and onl y when and where they are 
warranted due to the emergency  situation. Preferably , the full protocol in structions will be 
followed whenever the modified instructions are not required.
Section 7. Assessment of Safety
In the event of an emergency  situation (eg, COVID -19 outbreaks), in case a patient cannot return 
to the clinic for the scheduled visits (eg, due to quarantine, isolation, patient’s concern, active 
COVID -19 infection, or closure of the site clinic), remote assessment of safety  (as well as 
inqui ries regarding adverse events and use of concomitant medication) via telephone call and/or 
VC, with VC being the preferred method, may  be allowed. The results will be directl y entered 
into the case report form (CRF) per the usual process.
Modifications to other procedures and assessments (ECG, laboratory  sample collection, etc.) 
might be performed per implemented contingency measures according to sponsor instructions. 
For example, if central laboratory  samples cannot be collected for safet y assessments, sit es may  
have patients visit a local reference laboratory  or dispatch a home health nurse to perform the 
assessments, but only  after consultation with the sponsor.
These measures will be implemented on a case -by-case basis, and onl y when and where they are 
warranted due to the emergency  situation. These measures will not be implemented for patients 
known to be COVID -[ADDRESS_10851] ion of reference ranges from 
that laboratory . 
Section 7.4. Physical Examinations; Section 7.5. Vital Signs; Section 7.6. 
Electrocardiography; Section 7.7. Assessment of Local Tolerability and Pain
At-home health visits may  be used to perform safety  assessments such as phy sical examinations, 
vital signs, ECG, and local tolerability  to dete rmine an y new adverse events.

122Section 8. Assessments of Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity; Section 6.2. 
Pharmacodynamics Assessment 
If pharmacokinetic, pharmacod ynamic, and immunogenicity samples cannot be collected due to 
limitations in ability  to carry  out the procedure or limitations in stora ge and shipments, the 
samples will not be collected for those respective visits. Study  samples collected from confirmed 
COVID -19 positive patients during the study , with confirmation either before or after the sample 
collection, will be kept at the central laboratory  and will not be shipped to Teva bioanal ytical 
laboratories nor anal yzed. Teva bioanal ytical laboratories will be informed within approximately  
1week of an y COVID -19 positive patients confirmed after samples being collected.
Section 10. Quality Control and Quality Assurance; Appendix C.Quality Control and 
Quality Assurance
Deviations from the study  conduct due to emergency  situations (eg, COVID -19 outbreaks), 
including implemented contingency  measures and their impact (eg, patient discontinuation from 
the study , alternative procedures u sed to collect critical safet y and/or efficacy data, etc.), will be 
described in the appropriate sections of the clinical study  report (CSR).

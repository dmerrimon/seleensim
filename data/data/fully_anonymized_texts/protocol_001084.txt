Specific Aim  
To evaluate 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 and 68Ga-PSMA R2 PET/MRI for detection of recurrent 
prostate cancer after initial therapy in patients  meeting the criterion of biochemical 
recurrence. 
2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 Preliminary information 
Data from the American Cancer Society suggests that prostate cancer (PC) will continue to 
be the leading non-cutaneous cancer diagnosis in males in [ADDRESS_902069] mortality with 26,120 estimated deaths (1).  Subsequent treatment is multifaceted and may involve observation, surgery 
(prostatectomy), radiation therapy (external beam or brachytherapy), hormonal therapy, 
chemotherapy, or a combination of these (2-4 ).  
Up to 40% of the patients with prostate cancer develop biochemical recurrence within 10 
years after initial treatment (5).  Usua lly an increase of the PSA -level precedes a clinically 
detectable recurrence by [CONTACT_667808] (6 ).  However, it cannot differentiate between 
local, regional or systemic disease with the necessary precision that is essential for fur ther 
disease management (7 ).  
Morphological imaging methods exhibit considerable limitations: sensitivity ranges between 
25% and 54% for the detection of local recurrence by [CONTACT_590174] (TRUS) or 
contrast-enh anced CT and is moderately improved by [CONTACT_667809] (7-9 ).  
The sensitivity for detection of lymph node metastases of CT or MRI is reported to be 
30-80% (10).  Ultra -small particles of iron oxides (USPI[INVESTIGATOR_580185]) proved to be very effective, but 
are yet to be approved by [CONTACT_12721] (11).  Bone metastases presenting as osteoblastic lesions can be effectively detected by [CONTACT_667810], PET, CT and MRI 
(12,13). 
Various targets have been addressed by [CONTACT_667811].  PET tracers such as 
18F- or 11C-labeled choline and 11C-acetate 
have been investigated for the diagnosis of recurrent ( 14-16) prostate cancer .  Their 
feasibility in primary diagnosis is limited because of uptake in benign tissue such as benign 
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or inflammatory lymph nodes (17,18).  In addition, fluorinated 
versions are not available in the [LOCATION_002], while 11C-labeled tracers cannot be widely 
used due to the requirement for an on-site cyclotron due to the short half -life.  18F-FACBC, a 
new synthetic amino acid, might be superior when compared to 11C-choline PET/CT (19).  
However , recent wor k indicates that 18F-FACBC uptake in prostate cancer is similar to that 
in BPH nodules  (20).  Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) continues to elicit high 
interest.  This cell surface protein is significantly overexpressed in prostate cancer cells 
when compared to other PSMA -expressing tissues such as kidney, proximal small intes tine 
or salivary glands .  It therefore provides a promising target for prostate c ancer- specific 
imaging.  
Recently methods have been developed to label PSMA ligands wi th 68Ga and 18F.  Initial 
experience suggests that these novel tracers can detect prostate cancer relapses and 
SRC Version #2, [ADDRESS_902070] by [CONTACT_667812], followed by 
[CONTACT_667813] (21,22).  However, these promising agents do not detect all recurrences.  
Consequently, improved imaging of biochemically recurrent prostate cancer continues to be 
an area of unmet clinical need.  
Gastrin-releasing peptide receptors ( GRP R) are  highly overexpressed in several human 
tumors, including PC (23).  GRP receptor was detected in 63-100 % of human prostate 
cancer tissue (24, 25).  Moreover, because of their low expression in BPH and inflammatory 
prostatic tissues (25), imaging of GRP R has potential advantages over current choline- and 
acetate-based radiotracers. 
Maina and colleagues evaluated 68Ga-SB3 in [ADDRESS_902071] cancer and 9 patients 
with prostate cancer.  All patients had disseminated disease and had received previous 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (26).  68Ga-SB3 did not produce adverse effects and identified cancer les ions in 4 
out of 8 (50 %) with breast cancer  and 5 out of 9 (55 %) with PC.  An improved version of 
this radiopharmaceutical, 68Ga-NeoBOMB1, is showing promising results in pr eliminary 
studies (27,28).  68Ga-NeoBOMB1 has undergone extensive pre-clinical testing confirming 
specific and high affinity GRPR targeting (IC50: 1-2 nM), both in vitro and in vivo , as well as 
an appropriate pharmacokinetic profile compatible with a diagnostic use and a favorable 
safety profile.  68Ga-NeoBOMB1 specifically and strongly bound on the cell -membrane of 
PC-[ADDRESS_902072] imaging (29). 
A phase 1-2 c linical study (MITIGATE trial) aimed to evaluate 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 safety, 
tolerability,  biodistribution, dosimetry and preliminary diagnostic performance is ongoing in 
GIST  patients at Innsbruck University.  The safety assessment on the first [ADDRESS_902073] with good visibility of the metastasis already at 1h after adminis tration, associated with 
rapid renal and blood clearance (30). 
PET/MRI is an advanced multimodality technology that can provide both biological and 
morphological  information of various biological processes.  Compared to PET/CT, 
simultaneous PET/MRI has advantages resulting from reduction in the radiation exposure and improvements in diagnostic ability due to better soft tissue contrast (31 ).

2.4 Rationale In this study, we propose to use a well -established PET isotope, Gallium-68 (
68Ga), bound to 
a bombesin receptor antagonist, NeoBOMB1 , which has high affinity for ga strin- releasing 
peptide receptors  (GRPR), and  to PSMA R2 which has high affinity for prostate specific 

SRC Version #2, 18 Mar 2020  Page 10 of 26 CONFIDENTIAL  membrane antigen (PSMA).  GRPR  proteins are highly overexpressed in several human 
tumors, including prostate cancer (23) a nd its overexpression has been demonstrated in 
patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer  (32, 33).  Therefore, imaging GRPR  
has the potential to improve the lesion detection in pr ostate cancer.  
68Ga and 18F labeled PSMA ligands can detect prostate cancer relapses and metastas es 
with high contrast by [CONTACT_667814], followed by [CONTACT_667813] 
(21,22).  
Therefore, we propose the following aim: 
• To evaluate 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 and 68Ga-PSMA R2 PET/MRI for detection of recurrent 
prostate cancer after initial therapy in patients with biochemical recurrence. 
Imaging gastrin releasing peptide receptors using 68Ga-NeoBOMB1  
 
Figure 1.  Chemical structure of 68Ga-NeoBOMB1  
Four prostate cancer patients were imaged with 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 PET/CT by [CONTACT_667815] 
(28).  The tracer was well -tolerated by [CONTACT_667816] s ide-effect was registered from 
the administration of 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 .  Successful visualization of prostate cancer lesions 
in man was described by [CONTACT_667817] 68Ga-NeoBOMB1PET/CT. 
 
Figure 2:  65-year-old man with pT3b (G3) pN1c M0, Gleason score 7 prostate cancer .  Multiple 
mediastinal, para -oesophageal, abdominal and pelvic lymph node metastases are strongly positive 
for 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 uptake.  
SRC Version #2, 18 Mar 2020  Page 11 of 26 CONFIDENTIAL  Preliminary res ults from MITIGATE trial after completion of phase-I part of the study (6 
patients included) showed that 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 presents a favorable safety and tolerability 
profile, with no adverse events (AEs) related with the compound.  Overall, two subjects 
experienced adverse events, none of which were causally linked to the study  drug.  Uptake 
in tumor was fast with good imaging performance already at 1h after  administration, 
associated with rapid renal and blood clearance (30). 
Im
aging prostate specific membrane antigen using 68Ga-PSMA R2  
Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II integral membrane glycoprotein 
identified on human prostatic carcinoma cell lines.  The PSMA protein has a unique 3-part 
structure consisting in a 19-amino- acid internal portion, a 24-amino-acid transmembrane 
portion, and a 707-amino -acid external portion.  The PSMA  gene is located on the short arm 
of chromosome 11 in a region that is not commonly deleted in prostate cancer.  PSMA 
triggers a signal that allows internalization of the protein on the cell surface into an endosomal compartment.  This characteristic seems  to be useful for diagnostic and 
therapeutic (theragnostic) approach in which PSMA could be used as an antigenic target or 
as a specific docking-station for tailored small molecules (34). 
Increased PSMA expression has been detected most notably in prostate cancer; though, it 
was also detected in the peritumoral and endotumoral capi[INVESTIGATOR_667801] a variety of 
malignancies including renal cell carcinomas, transitional cell carcinomas, and colon carcinomas (35).  Nearly all adenocarcinomas of the prostate demonstrate PSMA 
expression in most primary and metastatic lesions (36).  Immuno-histochemical studies have shown that PSMA expression increases in cases of de-differentiated, metastatic, or hormone-refractory disease (37) and its expression level is a significant prognosticator for 
disease outcome (38).  
Several urea-based PSMA ligands have already been successfully tested in prostate cancer patients confirming good imaging performance and favorable safety profile.  In line with 
existing guidelines, the diagnostic doses of the 
68Ga-PSMA ligands range 120-200 
MBq/patient (approximately 2 to 3 M Bq/kg).  Considering the half-life of 68Ga, as well as the 
foreseen imaging and blood sampling schedule in early phase trials (up to ¾ h for imaging 
acquisition or 6h for PK sampling), a dose of 3 MBq/kg, but not less than [ADDRESS_902076] tested dose (in single dose studies: 8000 (rats) and 3500 (mini -pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]) times the 
maximum foreseen human dose; in repeated dose studies:  2600 (rats) and 1150 (mini -pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]) 
times the maximum foreseen human dose).  Similarly, no adverse effects have been 
observed in the safety pharmacology studies performed in rats and mini -pi[INVESTIGATOR_667802] 4000 (studies on effects on CNS and respi[INVESTIGATOR_46611]) 
or 1150 times higher (study on effects on cardiovascular function in mini -pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]) than the dose 
foreseen in human for the imaging drug product.

SRC Version #2, [ADDRESS_902082] unit doses from a commercial radiopharmacy (Sofie 
Biosciences, previously dba Zevacor).  No m anufacturing will take place at Stanford 
University.  
The administered dosage of 68Ga-NeoBOMB1  is 150 to 250 MBq IV.  The in vivo  distribution 
of 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 was studied by [CONTACT_667818] c nu/nu mice bearing the PC -3 
tumor-xenograft, injected with ~13 MBq/250  pmol 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 (specific activity 
~ 50 MBq/nmol) (41).  At 6  time-points (15 min;  30 min;  60 min;  2 h;  4 h ;  and 6 h) 
post-injection (p.i.), tumor and organ uptake was determined using a gamma counter.  To 
assess receptor -specificity additional groups of animals were co-injected with an excess of 
unlabelled NeoBOMB1 (40 nmol).  Results of the biodistribution studies  were also used to 
determine pharmacokinetics parameters and to perform dosimetry  calculations .  The highest 
tumor uptake of 12.4 ± 2.3 %ID/g tissue was measured at 2 h p.i.  At that time point, the 
uptake in the pancreas was 22.7 ± 3 .3 %ID/g tissue.  Uptake values in kidney and liver were 
5.7 ± 2.4 and 8.3 ± 1.8 % ID/g tissue, respectively, indicating renal and hepatobiliary 
excretion.  When receptors were blocked by [CONTACT_3252]-injection  with an excess of unlabelled 
NeoBOMB1, uptake in GRPR -expressing tissues  decreased, as observed in tumor and 
pancreas, where relative uptake reached 1.0 ± 0.1 and 0.7 ± 0.1 %ID/g tissue, respectively .  
Pharmacokinetic calculations resulted in a tumor clearance half-life of 6.9 ± 2.8 h and a  
pancreas clearance half -life of 12.9 ± 4.0 h.  Clearance from  blood proceeded according to a 
bi-phasic pattern: 66 ± 9 % with half- life of 8±5 min and 34% with half-life of 50 ± 15 min. 
Using the OLINDA/EXM for 68Ga and assuming equal uptake per organ in human and mice, 
extrapolation to humans was performed obtaining an effective dose of 0.039 mSv/MBq.  
Estimated absorbed doses extrapolated from animal  study showed that the critical organ is 
the pancreas (0.341 mGy/MBq).  However, it is important to note that the contribution to the 
effective dose (calculated using the ICRP -60 weighting factors) for this organ is  0.002 
mSv/MBq .  Therefore, with an administered dose of 250 MBq (max dose), the resulting 
expected dose in the pancreas will be 0.43 mSv (50 mSv  is the organ radiation dose limit for 
adults receiving a single administration, as per the Guidance for Industry and Researchers; 
“The Radioactive Drug Research Committee: Human Research Without an Investigational 
New Drug Application”, August 2010). 
The estimated effective dose for total human body, for an injected dose of 150 to 250 MBq 
is between 5.85 to 9.75 m Sv, which is below the FDA limit of 30 mSv for adult research 
subjects receiving a single dose (Guidance for Industry and  Researchers; “The Radioactive 
Drug Research Committee: Human Research Without an Investigational New Drug 
Application”, August 2010).

5. IMAG ING SPECIFICS  
5.1 Modality or Modalities to be used 
PET/MRI 5.2 Details of Imaging (ie, dynamic, static, number of scans, etc.)  
A localizer MRI scan will be performed at 45 minutes after injection of 150 to 250 MBq of 
68Ga-NeoBOMB1 (or 68Ga-PSMA R2, depending on randomization)  to define the table 
positions .  After correct positioning of the spatial acquisition windows is ensured, the 
combined PET/MRI acquisition will be initiated with 3– 5 table positions at a 4-min acquisition 
time per table position.  A v olumetric T1 acquisition with fat-water separation and motion 
correction to enable free-b reathing will be obtained at each table position and used for the 
gener ation of attenuation maps and for anatomic allocation of the PET results .  
Simultaneously with the start of the T1 MRI sequence, the PET acquisition will start at the 
same table position, thus ensuring optimal temporal and regional correspondence between MRI and PET data.  The PET acquisition time will be 4 min per table position, taking delayed 
acquisition times and radioactive decay into account.  As the T1 will take less than 
4\ minutes, a rapid diffusion weighted MRI will also be performed.  After completion of the 
PET acquisition, the table will be moved to the next table position and the procedure will be 
repeated.  Upon completion of the PET acquisition for all stations, volumetric  post- contrast 
T1- and T2-weighted MR images may be obtained at multiple stations as needed.  
A localizer MRI scan will be performed at 45 minutes after injection of 150 – 250 MBq of 
68Ga-PSMA R2  (or 68Ga-NeoBOMB1, depending on randomization)  to define the table 
positions .  After correct positioning of the spatial acquisition windows is ensured, the 
combined PET/MRI acquisition will be initiated with 3– 5 table positions at a 4-min acquisition 
time per table position.  -----Only MR sequences required for attenuation correction of PET 
data will be acquired.  
SRC Version #2, [ADDRESS_902086] followed by 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 within 2 weeks (50/50 
chance for each schedule) .

8. ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES  
8.1 Potential Adverse Events 
The administration of the radioactive substanc e will feel like a slight pi[INVESTIGATOR_667803].  Patients who are claustrophobic may feel some anxiety while positioned in the 
scanner.  Also, some patients find it uncomfortable to hold one position for more than a few 
minutes .  Because the radioactivity is very short-lived, the expected radiation exposure of 
the whole body and critic al organs is low .  The substance amount (PSMA R2 and 
NeoBOMB1) is so small that it does not affect the physiological processes of the body.  
This research study  involves exposure to radiation from one 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 PET/MRI .  
There is no radiation exposure from MRI .  The estimated effective dose for total human 
body, for an injected dose of 150 to 250 MBq is between 5.85 to 9.75 mSv, approximately 
equal to 11.7 to 19.5% of the limit that radiation workers (for example, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] X-ray 
technician) can receiv e in one year.  
This research study also involves exposure to radiation from one 68Ga-PSMA- R2 PET/MRI.  
There is no radiation exposure from MRI.  The effective dose from 68Ga-PSMA -R2 PET is 
similar to 68Ga-PSMA -11 or 68Ga-PSMA-617.  The estimated effective  dose for total human 
body, for an injected dose of 150 to 250 MBq, is between 3.15 to 5.25 mSv, approximately 
equal to 6.3-10.5% of the limit that radiation workers (for example, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] X-ray 
technician) can receive in one year.  
SRC Version #2, [ADDRESS_902091] radiopharmaceutical dose 
and route of administration (i e, each dose will be double checked for dosimetry and quality 
by a researcher and technologist) .  The study Principal Investigator (PI) or his designee will 
report unexpected AEs related to the Stanford CCTO Safety Coordinator within 10 working 
days of becoming aware of the event (5 days if the event is life-threatening or resulted in death) using the Adverse Events Communication Form .  If the principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_667804], the study will be terminated as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_902092].  
9. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Institutional Review of Protocol 
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related 
to the study (eg, advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and approved 
by [CONTACT_55790].  Any changes made to the protocol will be submitted as a modification 
and will be approved by [CONTACT_98900].  The Protocol Director will 
disseminate the protocol amendment information to all participating investigators.  
9.[ADDRESS_902093] Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will audit 
study related activities to determine  whether the study has been conducted in accordance 
with the protocol, local standard operating procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  This may include review of regulatory binders, case report forms, eligibility 
checklists, and source documents.  In addition, the DSMC will regularly review serious 
adverse events and protocol deviations associated with the research to ensure the 
protection of human subjects.  Results of DSMC audits will be communicated to the IRB and the appropriate regulatory authorities at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited 
fashion, as needed. 
10. MEASUREMENTS  
10.1 Primary o utcome measure 
The principal goal of this study is to compare the diagnostic performance of 
68Ga-NeoBOMB1 PET/MRI and 68Ga-PSMA R2 PET/MRI to that of MR alone i n clinically 
(PSA) recurrent but CT- negativ e prostate cancer patients.  The gold standard will be based 
on either biopsy or one-year follow -up with imaging. 
SRC Version #2, 18 Mar 2020  Page 21 of 26 CONFIDENTIAL  Specifically, it is expected that: 
1.  At least 30% of these patients will have one or more lesions detected on 68Ga- 
NeoBOMB1 PET/MRI or 68Ga-PSMA R2 PET/MRI. 
2.  The proportion of patients with detected lesions will be higher for 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 
PET/MRI or 68Ga-PSMA R2 PET/MRI than for MR alone. 
• Primary Outcome measure: Number of lesions detected by [CONTACT_667822] 
• Timeframe: Withi n 30 days  
• Description: The number of lesions detected on 68Ga- NeoBOMB1 PET/MRI, 
68Ga-PSMA R2 PET/MRI , and conventional MR will be compared.  Outcome will be 
reported as number of lesions detected per patient for each imaging method. 
10.2 Measurement Methods 
PET images will be interpreted using the AW software (GE Healthcare)  and the location of 
uptake will be recorded for each patient, blinded to the results of other studies .  MR images  
will be evaluated for detection of areas of abnormal signal or anatomical structures, blinded 
to the results of PET or other studies. 
10.3 Measurement Time Points 
Uptake will be evaluated after the scan completion.  
10.4  Secondary Outcome Measure 
• Secondary Outcome measure: Predictive value of malignancy  
• Timeframe: After 1 year clinical follow -up 
• Description: The predictive value of 68Ga- NeoBOMB1 PET/MRI and 68Ga-PSMA  R2 
PET/MRI imaging will be evaluated based on biopsy and/or imaging results during [ADDRESS_902094] clinical follow -up.  Outcome will be reported as - percentage of 
detected lesions that were confirmed to be malignant for each imaging method. 
11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1  Statistical Design 
Prospective single center, single-arm study.  Patients will be scanned with 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 
PET/MRI and 68Ga-PSMA R2 PET/M RI.  MRI and PET/MRI scans will each be evaluated 
separately by [CONTACT_340688]. 
11.2  Randomization  
Patients will be randomized equally between having the 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 PET/MRI scan 
done first or the 68Ga-PSMA R2 PET/MRI.  
11.[ADDRESS_902095] the same findings as 
what was noted with Ga68 PSM A-11 and Ga68 RM2 (bombesin), i e, about 2/3 same 
findings, while 1/[ADDRESS_902096] the same findings or if one 
SRC Version #2, 18 Mar 2020  Page 22 of 26 CONFIDENTIAL  radiopharmaceutical will outperform the other (no additional lesions found by [CONTACT_667823]), the study will be disc ontinued.  
11.[ADDRESS_902097]: disease status of a l esion will be defined by [CONTACT_667824][INVESTIGATOR_397272], when clinically feasible.  12-months clinical  follow -up with imaging will be gold 
standard if biopsy cannot be done.  
Test to be ev aluated: 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 and 68Ga-PSMA R2 positivity will be determined by 
[CONTACT_667825] (malignant)  or less (benign) .  
Visual  conspi[INVESTIGATOR_667805] T1w and T2w images are the criteria for 
detecting a lesion on MRI. 
11.4.1 Analysis Population 
All lesions identified by 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 PET/MRI and 68Ga-PSMA R2  PET/MRI.  
11.4.2  Analysis Plan 
• Sensitivity, specificity , and positive and negative predictive value of imaging modalities 
will be estimated. 
• Sensitivity and specificity of PET/MRI and MR alone will be compared by [CONTACT_667826].  
• The number and type of discrepancies between 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 and 68Ga-PSMA R2  
will be tabulated. 
• We will explore hypotheses about the reasons for such discrepancies, such as PSA 
level/velocity, Gleason score, and location.  
11.[ADDRESS_902098] approximately 70% of 
patients (~35) to have one or more PET-positive findings and approximately 1/3 to be 
biopsied.  Our existing data for 68Ga PSMA -11 and 68Ga-RM2 (please see attached 
publications) indicate no false positive findings based on biopsy.  We cannot predict an 
average number of lesions per patient given small data available to date, but if only half of 
the positive patients have more than one lesion, thi s will easily yield [ADDRESS_902099] the sensitivity of MR alone to be roughly  40%, while that of PET to be roughly 60% or 
more .  A sample size of 50 patients will provide 90% power at one-sided 5% error to detect 
such a difference.  Participants who complete only one PET/MRI scan (either due to 
withdrawal of consent or loss to foll ow-up) will not be replaced with additional subjects. 
11.[ADDRESS_902100] the accrual of 50 patients over 24 months .  There are approximately 10 prostate 
cancer patients scanned each week in Nuclear Medicine to evaluate for metastatic disease .  
We plan to enroll 50 p articipants over 24 months  and this is achievable given our experience 
with other protocols and the expected support from the referring phys icians, Drs Hancock, 
Sonn, and Srinivas .

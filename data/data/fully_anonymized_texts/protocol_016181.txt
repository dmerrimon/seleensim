Title of the Study:   Operative and Non- operative treatment of Traumatic 
Arthrotomies: A Prospective Observational Study

Version:  [ADDRESS_185750] of treatment as well as 
incidence of adverse events, such as the development of septic arthritis, in patients undergoing operative and non- operative treatment of traumatic arthrotomies.    
 
Background and Rationale 
 Soft tissue wounds around joints are common injuries that are carefully 
evaluated to identify intra -articular extension.  Wound exploration, imaging, and 
intra- articular saline load injections are commonly utilized to diagnose the presence 
of a traumatic arthrotomy.   The reason for such diligence is that the treatment is dramatically different for a wound that violates the joint compared to one that does 
not.  As opposed to local wound care for simple soft tissue wounds, traumatic 
arthrotomies are thought to require formal irrigation and debridement in the 
operating room to minimize the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_160002].  
 
Septic Joints  
An injury that penetrates the joint capsule and synovium violates the body’s 
natural barriers that protect the joint from external pathogens.   Microorganisms 
from the environment may enter the joint by [CONTACT_160015].  By [CONTACT_160016], orthopaedic surgeons are theoretically 
attempting to minimize the burden of contamination and repair the body’s natural barriers to reduce the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_160003]- articular infection.  Septic arthritis 
is an orthopaedic emergency that can result in severe cartilage damage causing long -term joint pain, stiffness, and potentially auto -fusion (Chander  S, Curr Infect Dis 
Rep, 2011).  If not dealt with in a timely manner, intra- articular infections can result 
in significant long -term disability, and in extreme cases, can result in overwhelming 
sepsis and death (Chander S, Curr Infect Dis Rep, 2011).  
 
Orthopaedic Dogma  
Clearly, minimizing the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_160004].   Over sixty years ago, Hampton published his 
observation of a high rate of septic complications in combat injuries that violated 
the joint (Hampton OP, JBJS , 1946).  Since then, orthopaedic dogma has dictated that 
all injuries that violate the joint necessitate formal irrigation and debridement in order to minimize the risk of infectious complications.   The literature on the topic is 
spars e and stems primarily from wartime observations in which the injuries 
sustained were commonly associated with high levels of contamination, intra-articular fractures, retained foreign bodies, and delayed treatment (Marvel JE, CORR , 
1977).  The characteristics of these injuries may limit the generalizability of these observations to the civilian population, especially for small, mildly contaminated 
arthrotomies without associated fracture or retained foreign body.  
To date, no studies have prospectively evaluated the benefits of operative 
irrigation and debridement of traumatic arthrotomies compared to non- operative 
observation with antibiotics.  A single study published in 1975 by [CONTACT_160017] 2.1%, a value significantly lower 
than was previously observed in the non- operative cohort of combat injuries 
(Patzakis MJ, JBJS, 1975)  (Hampton OP, JBJS , 1946)  (Marvel JE, CORR , 1977).  There 
is little question that large and heavily contaminated arthrotomies benefit from formal irrigation and debridement, but it is unclear if this benefit can extrapolated 
to smaller, less contaminated injuries.  Nevertheless, orthopaedic surgeons continue 
to debride and irrigate open joints regardless of the burden of contamination or size 
of arthrotomy.  
 Small Arthrotomies are Commonly Missed Injuries  
In an effort to identify and treat as many traumatic arthrotomies as possible, 
orthopaedic surgeons began looking for additional techniques to aid in their 
diagnosis.  After it’s introduction in 1975, saline arthrograms quickly became the 
gold standard for the diagnosis of small traumatic arthrotomies (Patzakis and Voit).   
This doctrine was called into question by [CONTACT_160018], as they were commonly performed, had a sensitivity of 
only 43% (Tornetta P 3
rd, CORR, 2008).   Two years later, Nord and others 
recommended using 155 -ml of saline to diagnose 95% of arthrotomies, a volume 
more than double what was previous used in clinical practice and not easily 
tolerated by [CONTACT_72023] (Nord RM, JBJS, 2009).  Most recently, Metzger et. al. 
demonstrated a false- negative rate of 67% when using 180 -mL of saline for their 
arthrograms, a volume far beyond what would be tolerated in a conscious patient 
(Metzger P, JOT , Epub).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_160005] [ADDRESS_185751] to the 
patient.   
 Costs of Arthrotomy  
  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_160006], significant healthcare expenditures 
and additional risks of general anesthesia are undertaken to address this problem.  
Although the administration of general anesthesia has become extremely safe, it still 
carries the risk of serious consequences such as heart attack, stroke, and even death 
(Lanier WL, Am Surg, 2006)(Botney R, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys, 2008).  Patients 
with  multiple medical comorbidities are at an even greater risk of a serious 
perioperative complication (Wolters U, Br J Anaesth, 1996).  
In addition to the risks of undergoing anesthesia, there are significant costs 
associated with any operation.  A patient diagnosed with an isolated traumatic knee arthrotomy can expect to leave the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4791] a bill of at least $15,000 based on 
conservative estimates provided by [CONTACT_160019].   In an era where healthcare costs are spi[INVESTIGATOR_160007], determining which interventions are efficacious will be paramount in 
shapi[INVESTIGATOR_160008] -term sustainability.  
 Conclusion   
To our knowledge, there is no evidence to support the practice of 
prophylactic irrigation and debridement of traumatic arthrotomies that would 
otherwise be amenable to treatment in the emergency department. It is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_160009], who are both experienced orthopaedic 
trauma tologists at high -volume level 1 trauma centers, that small, mildly 
contaminated traumatic arthrotomies could be treated with antibiotics and close follow -up alone, if they are amenable to closure in the emergency department.   
Instead of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_160010], these patients could be safely discharged from the emergency department with local wound care and 
antibiotics alone resulting in significant healthcare savings and minimizing the risks 
of undergoing general anesthesia and a sur gical procedure.  
 
Research Plan  
 Specific Aim 1:  To compare the cost of medical care in patients with traumatic 
arthrotomies treated with surgical irrigation and debridement versus non- operative 
treatment with local wound care.  
 
Hypothesis 1:  Patients with traumatic arthrotomies will have an average hospi[INVESTIGATOR_160011] $15,000 less than those treated with surgery.  
 Specific Aim 2: To determine the incidence of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a septic arthritis in 
patients with a non- operatively treated traumatic arthrotomy.  
 
Hypothesis 2 :  Non -operative treatment of small traumatic arthrotomies will 
have an extremely low rate (<1 0%) of subs equent septic arthritis over a 3 -
month period.  
 
Specific Aim 3:  To determine the incidence of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a septic arthritis in 
patients with operative treatment of a traumatic arthrotomy.  
 
Hypothesis 3:   Operative treatment of traumatic arthrotomies will have an 
extremely low rate (<5%) of subsequent septic arthritis over a 3 -month 
period.  
 Specific Aim 4 : To determine the need fo r additional surgery (ex: foreign body 
removal) in patients with a non- operatively treated traumatic arthrotomy.  
 
Hypothesis 4:  Non -operative treatment of small traumatic arthrotomies will 
have an extremely low rate subsequent surgery over a 6 -month perio d. 
 Specific Aim 5 : To provide a description of traumatic arthrotomies successfully 
treated non -operatively.  
 
Hypothesis 5:  Arthrotomies will be less than 1 cm with a soft tissue injury amenable to closure in the ED.   Arthrotomies will be more likely to be due to 
GSW’s and scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_160012].

Potential Confounders 
As a prospective observational study, the patient’s treatment will not be 
altered by [CONTACT_160022].   No guidelines will be  provided to influence 
the treating surgeons’ decision making .  All surgeons will have treated patients 
based on their own expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_160014], which will undoubtedly differ 
between surgeons.   The purpose of the study is to show that some traumatic 
arthrotomies can be treated non- operatively based on surgeon discretion, and 
having a variety of different arthrotomies will add to the descriptive nature of the study.   
The observational nature of this study will introduce a selection bias based 
on the surgeon’s comfort level of treating traumatic arthrotomies non- operatively.  
Larger and more heavily contaminated arthrotomies will be far more likely to be 
treated operatively compared to smaller, less contaminated arthrotomies.  Any 
comparisons made between operative and non- operative treatment will have to be 
made between a matched cohort of arthrotomies of similar severity.  
Although the treatment of patients should not be altered by [CONTACT_160023], the possibility of a Hawthorne (observer) effect bias exists.  The treating surgeon’s decision making may potentially be altered by [CONTACT_50568].  
   Patient Safety 
 Patients involved in the study will not have their medical care altered in any 
way by [CONTACT_160024].  A data safety monitor will be appointed to periodicall y 
assess for adverse events.   .   
  
Methods  
Patient Iden tification  and Enrollment  
Patients will be identified at the time of the initial consultation or first clinic 
follow -up visit based on the presence of a traumatic arthrotomy, of any  major  joint, 
based on the criteria outlined above.  Patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be deemed eligible for the study.   Eligible  patients will be approached 
by a member of the treatment team to further discuss the study.  If the patient agrees, a member of the research staff will discuss the study in greater detail and 
obtain informed consent.   
 
Intervention 
There will be no alterations in patient care by [CONTACT_160022].   
The attending surgeon will determine the treatment plan, follow -up frequency, and 
follow -up duration.  The need for additional surgery will also be determined by [CONTACT_160025].   The development of septic arthritis or need to proceed to the 
operating room for foreign body removal will be deemed as adverse events and will be reported to the data safety m onitor as they occur.  
 
Data Collection  
At the initial consultation, patient demographic information, arthrotomy 
characteristics, treatment variables, and additional injuries will be obtained. At each follow -up appointments, pain level will be assessed by a  member of the treatment 
team and recorded . Patient will complete the VR -[ADDRESS_185752] poorer outcomes.  A p- value 
of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

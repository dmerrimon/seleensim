Study Schema 
 
 

10/19/[ADDRESS_894981] cancer (BC), who comprise the largest group of cancer survivors in the [LOCATION_002].  The incidence of depression and anxiety is approximately 3-5 times higher 
among BC patients than healthy women in the general population (20-30% versus 6%, respectively), 
[ADDRESS_894982] for years following treatment3,4 and 
is associated with reduced survival following treatment.5-8 Therefore, alleviating anxiety and 
depression among BC survivors is important for quality of life (QOL) as well as long -term health 
outcomes.  
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_663018], very little is 
known about the etiology of affective disorders that develop during adjuvant chemotherapy. 
Current strategies for BC patients include anti -depressants and counseling. Compliance with anti -
depressants is poor, discontinuations are frequent during the first month of therapy and approximately 25% of patients do not inform their physician about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_663019].
9,[ADDRESS_894983] cancer patients following 
chemotherapy  [2].  Perceived and real cognitive deficits have broad implications for quality of life 
(QOL) among survivors18; women report that post -chemotherapy cognitive deficits are frustrating 
and detrimental to their self-confidence, social relationships, and their ability to perform as effectively at work as before treatment. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_663020] -
related cognitive deficits and concerns raised by [CONTACT_663040], the etiology remains unknown. Likewise, there are no known preventative 
or therapeutic treatments for chemotherapy’s cognitive effects.  
Inflammation and Affective Disorders 
 
Causal links between inflammatory mediators and the development of a constellation of behaviors referred to as “sickness behaviors” have been established in animal models. 
21 Sickness 
behaviors include depressive-like behavior, anorexia, allodynia and lethargy. Based on these observations, elevated concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are hypothesized to underlie the development of depression and anxiety among cancer patients.
22,23 
Indeed, doxorubicin (DOX) + cyclophosphamide chemotherapy is among the most commonly 
used and most effective regimens for treating BC. However, it appears to be more pro-inflammatory than some other regimens, which could lead to increased incidence of “sickness behaviors.” Specifically, DOX + cyclophosphamide has been shown to cause an increase in interleukin-6 (IL -6), IL- 8, monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP -1), tumor necrosis factor 
10/19/2021       OSU [ZIP_CODE] V.7 
5 
 alpha(TNF-α) and its related receptors in women and mice, and IL-1β, and granulocyte colony 
stimulating factor in mice.24-[ADDRESS_894984] proposed that elevated concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines 
and chemokines underlie the development of the cognitive and affective side -effects of 
chemotherapy .
22,23,33 Indeed, DOX + cyclophosphamide chemotherapy is among the most 
commonly used and most effective regimens for treating breast cancer, however, it appears to be more pro-inflammatory than some other regimens, which could increase the incidence of “sickness behaviors”, including cognitive deficits; specifically Dox + cyclophosphamide increases 
interleukin-6 (IL -6) , IL -8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP -1), tumor necrosis factor 
alpha(TNF-α) and its related r eceptors in women and mice, and IL-1β, and granulocyte col ony 
stimulating factor in mice.
25,[ADDRESS_894985] assessed whether a causal relationship exists between proinflammatory cytokines and cognitive deficits following chemotherapy; the best clinical evidence to date is correlative.  
In addition to DOX, we know clinically that other types of chemotherapy including all agents 
received in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings are also associated with affective and cognitive 
changes. Since this is a preliminary feasibility study, it will be important to include all utilized agents in order for the study results to have broader applicability. 
 
Minocycline Mechanism of Action  
Minocycline, a member of second generation tetracycline analogs, is a highly lipophilic oral antibiotic, and currently approved by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) for the treatment of susceptible bacterial infections caused by [CONTACT_152926] -negative, gram-positive organism 
and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_663021]. This drug is well -tolerated for long term use for up to [ADDRESS_894986] of care for treatment of 
10/19/[ADDRESS_894987] cancer patients.  
 3.0 Objectives 
 
The objectives of this study are to: 
 Objective [ADDRESS_894988] cancer  randomized to receive 
either minocycline or placebo.  
  
4.0 Study Design 
 
This is a double blinded randomized study of minocycline (100 mg BID) vs placebo BID women 
with BC receiving DOX -based chemotherapy  or other chemotherapy for breast cancer . Eligible  
participants will be women with BC who will be undergoing treatment at the Stefanie Spi[INVESTIGATOR_663022] . Informed consent will be obtained from those who meet the study 
criteria (see inclusion/exclusion criteria) and are interested in participating. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], women 
begin chemotherapy within [ADDRESS_894989] the dose or the timing of subsequent 
chemotherapy treatments. Consented participants will be randomized to either oral administration 
of minocycline or a placebo with matched appearance for up to a 1 week loading period plus 
chemotherapy treatment period and an optional subsequent two week period.  
10/19/[ADDRESS_894990] cancer with self-reporting chemotherapy brain symptoms  while 
on chemotherapy or  within 18 months of completing the chemotherapy. These patients will then 
be assigned minocycline (100 mg BID) for 6 months. At baseline, 3 month and 6 month intervals 
they will undergo questionnaires and imaging.  
 
5.0 Eligibility Criteria

appropriate supplement can be dispensed.  Size of the randomized block will be known only by [CONTACT_663041].  Subjects of additional cohort, who have given informed consent, will be registered by [CONTACT_663042] a study number.  Each subject will receive minocycline capsules.

7.0 Minocycline and Placebo Pharmaceutical Information 
 
The same dose of minocycline that we propose to use is the FDA approved human dose and has been shown to reduce microglial activation in the brain in individuals with movement disorders
39. 
Participants will be prescribed oral minocycline twice daily (100 mg BID) or the placebo (one 
capsule  BID) beginning up to 7 days  prior to chemotherapy, through four cycles of chemotherapy  
and optionally  continuing through two weeks after their fourth cycle of chemotherapy treatment. 
Drug  can be started on same day as chemotherapy start. The matched placebo is being 
specifically manufactured and will be indistinguishable from the active capsule  (SBH Medical, 
Worthington, Ohio) . No known interactions exist between minocycline and chemotherapy/pre-
medications used. Also there are no data to suggest that minocycline is antagonistic with the anti -
tumor effects of chemotherapy and it is currently in use with patients undergoing chemotherapy 
who need minocycline for other indications.40 Compliance will be monitored by [CONTACT_663043][INVESTIGATOR_663023]. Absorption of minocycline is potentially impaired by [CONTACT_663044], calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing  preparations, so 
patients will be instructed to avoid products that contain these ingredients  for 2 hours before and 
2 hours after minocycline ingestion. Study drug will be initiated up to one week prior to cycle 1 of 
chemotherapy and continue for  up to two weeks after their fourth cycle of chemotherapy , 
optionally continuing through two weeks after their fourth cycle. All of the measures assessed by 
[CONTACT_663045]’s treatment assignment. Active drug and placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_403200] a staff pharmacist who will be blinded to patient’s  randomized status.
 Only the pharmaceutical compounding company 
(SBH Medical, Worthington, Ohio) will be aware of the study group assignment.   Unblinding will 
take place only in the event of concerns regarding toxicity or an adverse event.   During the study, patients are allowed to follow standard of care recommendations for NSAIDs and steroids as needed for management of chemotherapy induced nausea and pain syndromes from chemotherapy and pegfilgrastrim. The study coordinator will make notes  of the use and 
amounts used of these drugs during each visit. If antibiotics are needed during treatment for treatment of infection, study drug will be held during antibiotic therapy. Patients with > 14 day delay in restart of study drug will be taken off study.  
 8.0 Evaluation of Affective Symptoms During Chemotherapy  
 
Primary endpoints are changes in Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_67905] (CES -D) 
and State Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) from baseline to end of study after minocycline vs. placebo 
intervention (Aim 1). The CES-D and STAI will be administrated serially every cycle start on 
protocol  during clinic visits (Patients will self-administer forms given out by [CONTACT_164254]) . 
These instruments have been reliably used with BC patients/survivors and are well -characterized.  
The internal consistency for the STAI is .95; higher scores indicate greater anxiety.
[ADDRESS_894994]. Cheavens (Co-I, Clinical Psychologist) and/or social work  will be available 
to evaluate the patient’s  assessments if suicidal ideation is reported at baseline.  The subject will 
be withdrawn from the study and treatment referrals will be provided. During the trial, an increase on the CES-D above a score of 20, will trigger a risk assessment. [CONTACT_663054] and/or social work will be available to help manage patients’ symptoms.   In the case of significant depressive

9.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
9.1 Overview  
 
After obtaining informed written consent, participants will be randomized to either the intervention 
of minocycline or placebo.   One pi[INVESTIGATOR_663024] a day with or without food. No 
premedication is required.  
 
The study will require visits concurrent with chemotherapy visits  during study intervention.  At 
each visit, self-report diaries (adverse events, record of study drug doses taken/missed) will be collected, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_180234]. Medications and supplements  will be reviewed with participants and a history and physical examination will be 
performed at each visit.  Study drugs will be dispensed once at the initiation  of study protocol  with 
enough pi[INVESTIGATOR_663025], throughout four cycles of 
chemotherapy  and continuing optionally for an additional two weeks after their fourth cycle. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_663026].

10 
 If the patient’s chemotherapy is held, the patients  should continue taking study medication. During 
this hold, the patient will dose from the optional supply  provided to them .  
 
In the additional cohort, after obtaining informed written consent, participants will be assigned minocycline (100 mg BID) for 6 months. Questionnaires and imaging will be assessed at baseline, 
3 month and 6 month intervals of minocycline treatment.    
 
9.2 Correlative/special studies  
 
Inflammatory biomarker analysis:  
 
Correlative blood levels for cortisol, high sensitivity c -reactive protein (hs -CRP), inflammatory 
factors including but not limited to IL- 6, TNF-α, IL -1β, and MCP-1  IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and MCP -
1 will be obtained every cycle  during study period(Aim 2).  Cytokine single nucleotide 
polymorphisms will be checked within the same blood specimens. The primary comparison will 
be in changes from baseline to the end of treatment. The blood samples (10 ml collected in a  
plain red top tube with no gel separator) collected will be centrifuged to obtain serum, and then aliquoted and stored at -80
oC (completed at SSCBC; see appendix page 25). These aliquots  will 
then be batch analyzed in DeVries’ (PI) laboratory for cortisol, high sensitivity c -reactive 
protein(hs -CRP), IL -6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and MCP -1 using ELISA; cortisol will be measured because 
it is a hormone often used as an index of stress and high levels are associated with depression.
50,[ADDRESS_894998] appointment of the day to ensure that the blood samples are all collected within a 2 hour  window. 
 
Neuro/PET imaging:    
 
Each enrolled patient will have the opportunity to undergo an optional neuro PET imaging to 
evaluate CNS levels of inflammation. (PET will mandatory for patients in the additional cohort, 
who are already experiencing chemotherapy brain symptoms). In addition to F
18FDG PET , when 
available, we will utilize PK11195 labeled with 11C for PET imaging studies. Labeling and imaging 
will take place under the direction of Dr . Michael Knopp (Co-I), Director of the OSU Wright Center 
for Imaging (see letter of support).  PK11195 ligand targets the translocator protein-18 kDa 
(TSPO) located on the outer mitochondrial membrane of microglia. TSPO expression is increased 
in neuroinflammation, and has been used as an index of microglial activation in several neuroinflammatory disease states.
52,53  
 
Neuro MRI imaging : 
 
 
In addition to neuro PET imaging, patients will also have the option to undergo a neuro MRI 
imaging. To investigate cognitive changes associated with our intervention, we will use a multi -
modal imaging protocol at 7 Tesla. Functional MRI (fMRI; scan time 6 min) will assess group 
differences in cortical activation during the N -back test. Resting State Functional MRI (rs-fMRI; 
scan time 7 min), will explore the brain networks.  Structural MRI (total scan time 24 min): a) T1 
weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo 3D image will be acquired with a voxel resolution of 1mm x 1mm 0.5 x 0.5 x 2 mm3, TR/TE 23/12 ms; this approach allows registration 
to a standard brain atlas and measurement of white and gray matter volume and percent brain volume change. b) T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery image will also be acquired. c) Diffusion 
10/19/[ADDRESS_894999] coupled with the increase in 
image resolution significantly improves the functional sensitivity compared to lower magnetic field 
imaging.54 Importantly, the regions of the brain we are examining are minimally affected by 7 T 
image distortion artifacts. ( 2 (3) Co-registration of PET and MRI: Images from all modalities will 
be co-registered to the high resolution T1 weighted MR image for each subject. Also, the T1 images will be co-registered to the MNI template [76] using FSL12 [77] and AFNI tools.  fMRI images will be corrected for distortion and then statistical parametric maps will be created. For 
each task based fMRI, group analysis will be performed to find spatial brain activation differences 
between the treated and placebo groups where the z -scores are greater than 2.3. For the rs -fMRI 
studies, group level independent component analysis will be implemented to identify 100 comp onents. Then, functional parcellation of the cortical and subcortical components will be 
created. For the patient group, functional correlation between different neural networks will 
examined chronically and compared with that of the placebo group. The total maximum whole 
body exposure for all three scan time points is 2111 mrem, which is within the acceptable range by [CONTACT_663046].  
  9.3 Clinical assessments  
 
Clinic visits  
 
Participants will be evaluated during routine clinic/chemotherapy encounters approximately every 
2-3 weeks  (with each cycle of chemotherapy) . Blood draws and study questionnaires will be 
obtained at the same time. Participants will be requested to keep a diary to record of their intake of 
study pi[INVESTIGATOR_663027].  The 
diaries will be collected and reviewed during the clinic visits.  
 
 9.4 Adherence  
 
Participant adherence with the study intervention will be encouraged and m onitored in several 
ways.  Subjects will maintain a daily diary in which to check off the dose s of study drug/placebo 
when taken. At study visits, participants will return their pi[INVESTIGATOR_663028], who 
will count and record leftover pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] .  
 
9.[ADDRESS_895000] (EPIC).   
 
9.6 Safety monitoring  
 
Adverse events will be monitored by [CONTACT_6270]- reporting of signs and symptoms.  Patients will maintain a 
daily diary of time of drug/placebo intake and any possible ill effects, with instructions to contact [CONTACT_1600] [INVESTIGATOR_663029].  
 
9.7 Accountability 
 
10/19/2021       OSU [ZIP_CODE] V.7 
12 
 Study drugs (both minocycline and placebo) will be provided at no cost to the patient.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_663030], with the start date and number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_180244].  The drugs will be 
provided in sufficient supply for  one optional week prior to chemotherapy, four cycles of 
chemotherapy  and +/- two optional additional weeks after chemotherapy .  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_663031]’s  follow -up visits, and any unused capsules will be documented and  
counted to ensure proper adherence. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_180246]. Additionally, there will be no charge for research 
related blood work and imaging.  
 
 
10.[ADDRESS_895001] Center.  There will be monetary compensation for completion of various 
study precedures to account for patient’s time. The person obtaining informed consent will tell the 
patient that 1) participation is voluntary, 2) participation or non-participation will not affect their usual 
care and management, and 3) patient confidentiality will be maintained in the event that the results of the study are published.  The potential toxicities associated with minocycline will be explained 
fully to the patient.  Patients will be informed of the need for, blood tests, physical 
examinations,questionnaires prior to entry into the study  and at several specified intervals during 
study period. Patients will be provided with a consent form to review, and all questions answered.  
 After signed informed consent has been obtained, a study identification number will be assigned to the patient for use on all data collection forms and samples.  A request for randomization will 
be given to the SBH Compounding Pharmacy who will enter study number into a randomization spreadsheet designed by [CONTACT_663047]. By [CONTACT_663048], the randomization assignment will be given to the staff at SBJ who will then dispense the drug which will be shipped to OSU to be given to the patient by [CONTACT_663049]. Only SBH will have access to randomized assignments until study closure or if there is a serious adverse event necessitating unblinding of study investigators or if patient withdraws from study. 
 
 
11.0 POTENTIAL TOX ICITY, DOSE MODIFICATIONS, AND MANAGEMENT  
 
The severity of adverse reactions is categorized as grade 1 to grade 5 in increasing severity.  These 
will be attributed separately to both chemotherapy and study drugs.  
 
 General descriptors for the toxicity grades range from none to fatal:   
Grade 1 – Mild (The adverse reaction does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject’s 
normal functioning level.  It may be an annoyance.)  
Grade 2 – Moderate (The adverse r eaction produces some impairment of functioning but is not 
hazardous to health.  It is uncomfortable and/or an embarrassment)  
Grade 3 – Severe (The adverse reaction produces significant impairment of funcitoning or 
incapacitation and is a definite hazard to the subject’s health)  
Grade 4 – Adverse reactions that include or lead to either a) a life- threatening event, though acute 
and without permanent effect,  b) prolonged inability to resume usual life pattern, or c) impairment 
of ability to adequately deal with future medical problems  
10/19/2021       OSU [ZIP_CODE] V.7 
13 
 Grade 5 – Death related to AE  
 
Toxicity will be monitored during study visits and telephone calls using the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE) of the National Cancer Institute will be used (http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.02_2998- 09-
15_QuickReference_5x7.pdf).  Grade 3, 4 and 5 toxicities will be reported as adverse events.   
 Patients with Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions that are related to the study will be removed from the 
study.  No dose modifications are permitted for study drug.  
 Listed below are specific categories for potential adverse effects associated minocycline. No dose modifications will be made. Patients with grade 3 or 4 adverse  events attributed to minocyc line will 
be removed from the study.  
Due to oral minocycline’s virtually complete absorption, side effects to the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines.  
Body as a Whole: Fever, and discoloration of secretions. 
Gastrointestinal : Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, stomatitis, glossitis, 
dysphagia, enamel hypoplasia, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitis, pancreatitis, 
inflammatory lesions  (with monilial overgrowth) in the oral and anogenital regions. Instances of 
esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients taking the tetracycline-class antibiotics in capsule and tablet form. Most of these patients took the medication immediately before going to bed  
Genitourinary : Vulvovaginitis.  
Hepatic Toxicity : Hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic cholestasis, increases in liver enzymes, fatal 
hepatic failure, and jaundice. Hepatitis, including autoimmune hepatitis, and liver failure hav e 
been reported. Skin: Alopecia, erythema nodosum, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_447137], pruritus, toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_7387], and vasculitis. Maculopapular and erythematous rashes. Exfoliative dermatitis has 
been reported. Fixed drug eruptions have been reported. Lesions occurring on the glans penis 
have caused balanitis. Erythema multiforme and Stevens -Johnson syndrome have been 
reported. Photosensitivity. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_663032]. 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] : Cough, dyspnea, bronchospasm, exacerbation of asthma, and pneumonitis.  
Renal Toxicity : Interstitial nephritis. Elevations in BUN have been reported and are apparently 
dose relatated. Reversible acute renal failure has been reported.  
Musculoskeletal : Arthralgia, arthritis, bone discoloration, myalgia, joint stiffness, and joint 
swelling.  
Hypersensitivity Reactions : Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, polyarthralgia, 
anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction (including shock and fatalities), anaphylactoid purpura, 
myocarditis, pericarditis, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus and pulmonary 
infiltrates with eosinophilia have been reported. A transient lupus -like syndrome and serum 
sickness-like reactions also have been reported. 
Blood: Agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, 
pancytopenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. 
10/19/2021       OSU [ZIP_CODE] V.7 
14 
 Central Nervous System : Convulsions, dizziness, hypesthesia, paresthesia, sedation, and 
vertigo. Bulging fontanels in infants and benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri ) 
in adults have been reported. Headache has also been reported. 
Other: Thyroid cancer has been reported in the post-marketing setting in association with 
minocycline products. When minocycline therapy is given over prolonged periods, monitoring for signs of thyroid cancer should be considered. When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines 
have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid gland. Cases of abnormal thyroid function have been reported. 
Tooth discoloration in children less than 8 years of age and also, in adults has been reported. 
Oral cavity discoloration (including tongue, lip, and gum) have been reported. 
Tinnitus and decreased hearing have been reported in patients on minocycline hydrochloride.  
The following syndromes have been reported. In some cases involving these syndromes, death 
has been reported. As with other serious adverse reactions, if any of these syndromes are 
recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately: 
Hypersensitivity syndrome consisting of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative 
dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. 
Lupus -like syndrome consisti ng of positive antinuclear antibody; arthralgia, arthritis, joint 
stiffness, or joint swelling; and one or more of the following: fever, myalgia, hepatitis, rash, and 
vasculitis.  
Serum sickness -like syndrome consisting of fever; urticaria or rash; and arthralgia, arthritis, joint 
stiffness, or joint swelling. Eosinophilia may be present.  
Contraindications  
This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the 
tetracyclines  or to any of the components of the product formulation.  
 
Warnings  
Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal 
harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if 
the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the 
potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth 
development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause 
permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow -gray -brown).  
This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short -term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetrac ycline 
drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated.  
All tetracyclines  form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the 
fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in 
doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was 
discontinued. 
10/19/[ADDRESS_895002] toxic effects on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103] (often related to retardation of 
skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in 
pregnancy. 
Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been 
reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately.  
The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a 
problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of 
the drug and possible liver toxicity.  
Photosensitivity manifested by [CONTACT_214623]. This has been reported with minocycline. 
Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been 
reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be 
cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. 
These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapi[INVESTIGATOR_663033]. 
Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all 
antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild 
diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon 
leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . 
 
12.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
12.1 Definition 
 
Adverse event :  Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure; also an “unanticipat ed problem” of any nature (e.g., psychological or social harm) 
 (designated as unrelated, definitely related, probably related, or possibly related; see below)  
 Serious adverse event :  Any adverse event that is fatal or life threatening, is permanently 
disabling, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908], or results in a congenital 
anomaly or birth defect.  
Life-threatening event :  Any adverse event in which the subject is at immediate risk of death 
from the reaction as it occurs; does not include a reaction that, if it were to occur in a more serious 
form, might cause death . 
 Unexpected event :  Any adverse event that is not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in 
the investigator brochure, study protocol, consent form, or IND application; or the event was more 
serious than anticipated.  
10/19/2021       OSU [ZIP_CODE] V.7 
16 
  
Association: 
 
 Definitely Related :  An adverse event that has a timely relationship to the administration of the 
investigational drug/study procedure and follows a known pattern of response for wh ich no 
alternative cause is present.  
 
 Probably Related : An adverse event that has a timely relationship to the administration of the 
investigational drug/study procedure and follows a known pattern of response, but for which a 
potential alternative cause may be present. 
 
 Possibly Related : An adverse event that has a timely relationship to the administration of the 
investigational drug/study procedure, follows no known pattern of response, but a potential 
alternative cause does not exist. 
 
 Unrelated :  An adverse event for which there is evidence that it is definitely related to a cause 
other than the investigational drug/agent; in general, no timely relationship to the administration of the drug/procedure exists, or if so, the event does not follow a pattern of response and an 
alternative cause is present . 
 The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE) of the National Cancer Institute will be used. The severity of adverse reactions is categorized as grade 1 to grade 5 in increasing severity. Grade 3, 4 and 5 toxicities will be reported as adverse events. General 
descriptors for the toxicity grades range from mild to fatal:   
 Grade 1 – Mild (The adverse reaction does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject’s 
normal functioning level.  It may be an annoyance.)  
Grade 2  – Moderate (The adverse reaction produces some impairment of functioning but is not 
hazardous to health.  It is uncomfortable and/or an embarrassment)  
Grade 3 – Severe (The adverse reaction produces significant impairment of functioning or 
incapacitation and is a definite hazard to the subject’s health)  
Grade 4 – Adverse reactions that include or lead to either a) a life- threatening event, though acute 
and without permanent effect,  b) prolonged inability to resume usual life pattern, or c) impairment 
of ability to adequately deal with future medical problems  
Grade 5 – Fatal  
 
12.[ADDRESS_895003]. The patient will be observed and monitored carefully until the condition resolves, stabilizes, or its cause is identified.  
All adverse events, including laboratory abnormalities, will be followed up according to good medical 
practices.  Information to be recorded includes the following:  
a. Specific type of reaction. 
b. Duration of reaction.  
c. Severity/grade of reaction according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE).  
d. Suspected cause of the reaction (i.e. possibly or probably related to one of the following: study treatment, progression of disease, concurrent medications, concurrent illness, or 
other factors). 
e. Changes made in the administration of the study drugs and other actions taken to alleviate the clinical event. 
10/19/2021       OSU [ZIP_CODE] V.7 
17 
 f. Patient’s response to medical interventions.  
 
12.3 Reporting  
 According to FDA regulations (21 CFR 312.32), IND safety reports shall address “any adverse experience associated with the use of a drug that is both serious and unexpected.”  The IRB will be notified of any adverse event fulfilling the following criteria:  
1. The adverse event is SERIOUS (as defined above),  
or 
2. The adverse event is not serious, but is UNEXPECTED  and its association with the 
study drug, device, or research-related procedure is either DEFINITELY , 
PROBABLY , or POSSIBLY RELATED, or UNKNOWN (as defined above).  
 
Federal policy [45 CFR 46.116(b)(5)] also requires that investigators inform subjects of any important new information that might affect their willingness to continue participating in the research. When an adverse event necessitates changes to the consent/assent form(s) and/or protocol, or that notification is given to currently or previously enrolled subjects, an amendment 
request will be submitted in conjunction with the adverse event report. The IRB will make a 
determination whether any new findings, new knowledge, or adverse effects should be 
communicated to subjects.  In accordance with IRB guidelines, serious adverse events will be reported within 10 days 
of the investigator’s or research staff members’ learning of the event to The Ohio State University Institutional Review Board.  OSU IRB Event Reports should be submitted through BuckIRB at: 
http:/orrp.osu.edu/irb/buck -IRB/. Events resulting in temporary or permanent interruption of study 
activities by [CONTACT_663050] m to subjects should be reported 
within 48 hours whenever possible.  
All events that may represent unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others 
will be promptly reported (as described above), regardless of whether they occur during or after 
the study, or involve a subject who has withdrawn from or completed study participation. If 
changes to the research or consent process are proposed as a result of the event, or if additional information will be provided to current and/or past participants, an amendment request will also be submitted for IRB review.  
Related events involving risk but not meeting the prompt reporting requirements will be 
reported to the IRB in summary form at the time of continuing review.  
 
13.0 CRITERIA FOR RESPONSE ASSESSMENT  
 
All randomized patients will be considered evaluable. Participants with only baseline measures will be considered as drop-outs.

 about a month; if their visits are more than a month apart, a check in the appropriate amount will 
be mailed to them  within 2-4 weeks of each phase of study completion.  By [CONTACT_2371], payments to 
subjects are considered taxable income.  
 
 17.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Data Analy sis Plan. Patient demographics information will be summarized for each treatment 
group. Drug compliance will be evaluated using pi[INVESTIGATOR_663035]. Adverse events will also be tabulated for each treatment group. Primary analysis for efficacy will be conducted based on intention-to -treat (ITT) principle and sensitivity analysis will be conducted for those patients who 
received the treatment (per -protocol patients, or PP)). We will use mixed model for repeated 
measures to account for the association of these weekly measures from the same individual, and 
to estimate the effect size of the treatment group and test the differences between two groups in 
terms of the changes of CES-D and STAI scores  after 8 weeks. The advantage of using mixed 
model include that it can handle potential missing data (with missing at random assumption), and 
use it to study the pattern of weekly changes overtime for each group (include linear change overtime).  All patients will be used as ITT for safety and compliance measures analysis.  
  
Prim
ary Outco mes. For ea ch primary out come  measure ( CES-D and STAI scores), we will 
evaluate ( 1) the change over time from ba seline to the end of stud y for the two groups, and ( 2) 
the differen ces of the changes betwee n the two group s after four cycles of chemotherapy . Mix ed 
models f or repeated mea sures  will be used to account f or the associati on of the mea sures 
over time from the same patients. The 95% confide nce i ntervals of the change in t he prim ary 
outcome measures from ba seline to the en d of study an d the differences betwee n the treatment 
and pl acebo groups will be estim ated ba sed on the models . The influenc es of covariat es, s uch 
as di sease stage and baseline measures, w ill be consider ed in the mix ed models as explorat ory 
analy ses. 
 
 Secondary an d cor relative outco mes. The same  meth od will also be  used to evaluate t he 
changes of the se secondary and correlative out comes (inflammatory blood biomarkers and t he 
PET/MRI measures) . We w ill use scatter pl ots to explore t he pair-wi se cor relation  amon g  the  
changes  of  CES- D  and  STA I  scores ,  bloo d  biomarkers  changes,  and  PET/MR measures . 
We w ill use linear regression to explore whether t he blo od ba sed bi omarkers a nd PET/ MRI 
measures  can be used to pre dict the changes in CES-D and STAI sc ores, whi ch then could 
be used as  potenti al surrogate markers i n future stu dies.  
 
The s
econdary goal of this study is to collect data of the cognitive function changes in breast 
cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and gather evidence of the effect of minocycline in this patient population. All variables will be plotted over time (pre vs post-chemotherapy) and 
summarized for the minocycline treatment group and the placebo group. The changes of the 
variables for each group and the difference between two groups will be estimated based on a mixed model for repeated measures to account for the association of measurements from the same patient over time. The influence of the biomarkers on the cognitive function changes will also be evaluated visually using pair -wise scatter -plots. The associations among the changes of 
cognitive function measures, depression score and biomarkers will also be explored.

 Inflammatory Biomarkers Specimen Processing, Storage & Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_663037]: To ensure the correct analysis of “Inflammatory Biomarkers” in clinical specimens, these 
procedures must be followed carefully. Specimens should be ideally centrifuged immediately following clot formation but no longer than 90 minutes after specimen collection.  Specific 
instructions for collecting, processing, storing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_663038]:  
1. Venous whole blood ( approximately 10 mL) should be drawn into a 10-mL plain red top 
tube with no gel separator.  
2. Make sure that the ACTUAL clock time that the specimen was drawn (not the expected or 
targeted time) is recorded on the “Clinical Trials Flow Sheet:” (or other appropriate source document) and on the specimen collection tube label. 
3. Mix the vacutainer by [CONTACT_5237] 5 times 
4. Allow the specimen to clot for 30-60 minutes at room temperature.  
5. SERUM  should be separated from whole blood, by [CONTACT_128934] 1200 G (RCF) for 
10 minutes in a non-refriger ated or refrigerated centrifuge (4 °C).  .  
6. Immediately after centrifugation, using a disposable pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462], carefully transfer approximately 
the top two-thirds of the upper serum layer and place 0.5 mL (500 microliters) serum 
into eight (8) cryovials . 
7.  Pour-o ff tube labels should include the following information: 
• Protocol Number – OSU [ZIP_CODE]  
• Subject Number (ID Number)  
• Reference time point relative to protocol (i.e., nominal collection time)  
• Date of actual specimen collection  
• Actual time specimen was collected (military time)  
• Type of Specimen (Inflammatory Biomarkers)  
• Nominal Time Point (Baseline, 3 Months, 6 Months)  
8. Immediately place the cryovials containing serum into a storage box and place in a  
-70°C freezer.   
9. Specimens should be batched and stored at -70°C until the time of transport and analysis.  
10. Specimens should be sent to the OSU CRC Core Lab at 6-month intervals.  
 
11. Specimens will be sent via Best Courier to the CRC Core Lab and a completed “specimen 
log” should accompany each set of samples. Specimens should only be sent on 
Monday -Wednesday . 
 
12. Samples are to be packed in dry ice in styrofoam shippers with enough dry ice to ensure 
that the samples will not thaw during transport.  
 Dry ice should be placed along the bottom of the styrofoam container.  Each set of 
10/19/[ADDRESS_895027].  
A paper towel should be wrapped around the samples.  Each plastic bag for each patient 
should be identified with the following information:  protocol number, institution name, 
patient.  Before plastic bags are placed into the styrofoam box a layer of paper towels should be placed on top of the dry ice.  The plastic bag should then be placed into the box, and additional dry ice should be placed along its sides.  A completed specimen log listing all specimens should be included in a plastic resealable bag along with the samples shipped.  The styrofoam container should be sealed with strappi[INVESTIGATOR_663039] a 
sturdy cardboard mailing box.  The box should subsequently be sealed.  Samples should 
be transported to:

Biomedical Research Tower, Suite [ADDRESS_895028] name, phone number and email address, so that receipt of samples 
can be acknowledged. 
 
Please send Courtney DeVries an email ([EMAIL_12591]) the day before 
the specimens are to be shipped to acknowledge that a shipment will be made.

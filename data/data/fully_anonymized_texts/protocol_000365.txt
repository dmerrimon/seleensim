chlorhexidine, for daily foot cleaning  on reducing new foot complications including chronic foot 
ulcer or wound, foot infection, or foot amputation in Veterans at high risk for a foot ulcer. 
 
Keywords: Foot ulcer, diabetes, topi[INVESTIGATOR_669762], prevention, clinical trial 
Preventing Diabetic Foot Ulcers through Cleaner Feet 
 
  81 Background Information and Rationale  
1.1 Background and Rationale  
Between 10 and 25% of people with diabetes will develop a foot ulcer during their 
lifetime. Foot ulcers are a leading cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_669763]-traumatic amputation. About 40% of people with diabetes with a recently 
resolved foot ulcer will have a recurrence within one year despi[INVESTIGATOR_669764]. 
Thus the development of new interventions to decrease the risk of foot ulcers in high risk people 
is urgently needed. The prevalence of diabetes in the Veterans Health Administration’s patient 
population is about 24% making this a priority clinical issue for veterans’ care. 
 
A foot ulcer typi[INVESTIGATOR_669765] a patient with diabetic 
neuropathy. The minor skin trauma fails to heal resulting in a skin ulcer. The ulcer leads to 
infection, particularly due to Staphylococcus aureus , and often to gangrene resulting in an 
amputation. The role of the skin microbiota in the development of foot ulcers is unknown. 
Multiple skin disorders and infections are hypothesized to result from imbalance in the 
microbiota and the host inflammatory and immune responses. Impaired wound healing is 
hypothesized to result in part from dysregulated inflammation and microbial colonization 
suggesting a possible mechanism by [CONTACT_669779] a minor trauma leading to a foot ulcer. 
 
Prior work has shown that the feet of diabetic veterans have an increased S. aureus  load 
compared with non-diabetic veterans. Our preliminary data suggest that there is an increased S. 
aureus and total bacterial load on the feet of diabetic veterans at high risk for future foot ulcer 
compared to diabetic veterans at low risk of a future foot ulcer. We also found a higher relative 
abundance of staphylococci in the skin microbiota on the heels of people with diabetes at high 
risk for foot ulcers compared to those at low risk. Thus our data suggest that there are absolute 
differences in bacterial load and perhaps relative differences in abundance of bacterial taxa on 
the feet which could be part of the causal pathway for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a foot ulcer. If so, altering the 
skin microbiota of the feet could reduce the risk of foot ulcers. 
 
Chlorhexidine is a potential intervention to decrease the risk of diabetic foot ulcer through 
reducing the bacterial and fungal load including skin pathogens such as S. aureus . It is a broad-
spectrum antiseptic agent with an excellent safety profile. It prevents healthcare associated 
infections, such as surgical site infection, after iatrogenic skin breakdown through reducing the 
microbial load on the skin which has similarities to the pathogenesis of diabetic foot ulcers. To 
explore the effect of chlorhexidine on the skin microbiota of the foot, we had Veterans with 
diabetes at high risk for foot ulcer use chlorhexidine on their feet. We found an absolute decrease 
in S. aureus  and overall bacterial load and a decrease in the relative abundance of staphylococci 
among the foot microbiota. Thus we propose the following study to test the effect of 
chlorhexidine reduces new diabetic foot ulcers.  
 
1.2 Risk/Benefits 
The risks of the proposed study are minimal. There are possible risks and discomforts 
from this study for participants. 
 
Preventing Diabetic Foot Ulcers through Cleaner Feet 
 
  9SAGE® 2% CHLORHEXIDINE GLUCONATE* CLOTH is an FDA- approved 
formulation and application for topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 2% chlorhexidine, an antiseptic solution which is 
available without a prescription. It is widely used for pre-operative skin cleansing and extremely 
well tolerated. Mild skin irritation can occur; this stops after chlorhexidine is stopped. A 
systemic allergic reaction including low blood pressure can occur; this is very rare. 
 
SAGE® COMFORT BATH CLOTHS is a cloth soaked in mild, rinse-free cleansers and 
skin-protecting moisturizers like aloe and vitamin E, which is available without a prescription. It 
is widely used for bathing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_669766]. An allergic reaction 
could occur; this is very rare. 
 
The sampling methods for the anterior nares and skin sites is physically non-invasive, but 
there could be some discomfort during the procedure. The potential discomfort from obtaining 
the specimens does not place any participant at physical risk. A trained research coordinator will 
use very gentle pressure while obtaining the specimen to minimize these risks. 
 
There is a risk that health information could be in accidentally disclosed to others outside 
the study. There is a potential for breach of privacy.  Privacy and Confidentiality will be 
protected to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_2371]. 
 
There may be adverse events that are not yet known.  
 
There is no alternative treatment or procedure to participating in this study, but 
individuals have the right to decline participation in this research without any prejudice to their 
care or benefits. 
 
There are potential direct benefits to study participants. Participants will receive 
education on foot self-care. Participants receiving either regimen will have cleaner feet. This 
study will provide knowledge to determine whether topi[INVESTIGATOR_669767].

5.[ADDRESS_904439] missed two 
consecutive study visits will no longer be contact[CONTACT_669780] (wipes and swabs).  Study participants whose 
study visits are re-scheduled as part of the safety concerns related to COVID-[ADDRESS_904440] 
study staff and return for a visit #7 (outlined below) at any point prior to 1-year post 
randomization. This visit #[ADDRESS_904441] of potential 
participants to determine initial eligibility. Study staff will review and document the 
administrative data and then medical records of potential participants to determine if they meet 
eligibility criteria.  Accessing this information from administrative data and the participant’s 
medical record reduces the burden on the participant with regard to time and research 
procedures, increases the feasibility of the study, and confers no more than minimal, additional 
risk. 
 
Preventing Diabetic Foot Ulcers through Cleaner Feet 
 
  12All study participants will be recruited from the VA Maryland Health Care System. They 
will be identified by [CONTACT_669781] (PAVE) initiative or by [CONTACT_669782] 
(VINCI).  PAVE is a VA directive which requires VA medical centers to track Veterans by [CONTACT_669783]. VINCI can provide lists of veterans that meet 
eligibility criteria using data from the electronic medical record. We will use the PAVE 
administrative codes and data from VINCI to identify potential participants.  We will use multiple 
recruitment modalities including, but not limited to, recruitment through providers in Podiatry 
clinics, individual letters, posters in key clinics, electronic bulletin boards and My HealtheVet. 
We will track how participants heard about the study at enrollment in order to focus on the most 
successful recruitment modalities. 
6.1.1 Distribution of IRB approved informational flyer 
Study staff will distribute an IRB approved informational flyer/letter about the study to 
eligible potential participants and provide a phone number for follow-up. Study staff will 
approach eligible participants about participation using the following script. 
 
Hello, my name [CONTACT_669799].  I am a researcher with the Baltimore VA MC.  I am 
part of a research team conducting a study on how to prevent foot ulcers in people with diabetes.  
You may be eligible to participate in the study.  Would you like to hear more about it? 
 
If NO, say the following: 
Thank you for your time. 
 
If YES, say the following: 
The study is about how to prevent foot ulcers in people with diabetes through using a special 
wipe to clean your feet each day. You would have seven study visits over a little more than 1 year 
in which we will gently brush your feet with a swab like a Q-tip. This study will tell us whether 
using study cloth wipes prevents foot ulcers. 
 
Are you interested in hearing more about the study? 
 
If NO, say the following: 
OK.  Thank you for your time. 
 
If YES: 
Take the participant to a private space where no one can easily hear the conversation. Assess 
eligibility criteria and if eligible begin the informed consent process . If the participant is eligible 
and interested, but wants to take the consent home to review, make plans to follow-up with the 
potential participant. 
 
 Study staff will distribute an IRB approved informational flyer/letter about the study to 
VA providers.  This flyer can be used to remind providers who may be eligible and how to refer 
potentially interested patients to us. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_904442], study staff will verbally review 
the information on the IRB approved informational flyer. If the participant is interested, the study 
staff will schedule an in-person consent or a remote consent date.  For in-person consent, the 
combined written informed consent/ HIPAA form will be discussed with the potential participant 
in a private area. For both in-person consent and remote consenting the potential participant will 
be asked if he/she wishes for study staff to read the consent form verbatim or to summarize it as 
he/she follows along. Potential participants will be asked a series of questions about the study to 
assess whether they understand what is involved in being in the study. Participants must answer 
all questions correctly in order to consent. Participants being consented remotely will be 
provided with [ADDRESS_904443] mail one of the consents to us via the US postal service. The 
current approved messaging programs for transmitting documents with PHI/PII securely are 
Azure RMS or My HealtheVet Secure Messaging program. For participants being consented 
remotely, the enrollment visit may be split into 2.  During the first part, the participant will be 
consented. The second part, remaining research procedures, will occur soon after the signed 
consent is received by [CONTACT_5051]. 
7 Study Intervention 
Study participants will be assigned to our two experimental groups (chlorhexidine and 
placebo) using a blocked randomization with a 1:1 allocation ratio and variable block size at the 
time the participant returns for Visit #2 and agrees to continue participating in the study. The 
blocking will help assure that our study is balanced over time on the number of chlorhexidine 
and placebo participants. Participants randomized to the intervention will wash their feet using 
SAGE 2% CHLORHEXIDINE GLUCONATE CLOTHS to wipe down their feet each day and 
then apply supplied chlorhexidine-compatible over-the-counter moisturizer. The use of 
moisturizer is part of standard foot care for diabetes. Participants randomized to the control 
group will do the same except they will use SAGE COMFORT BATH CLOTHS which are the 
same cloths but do not contain chlorhexidine. The cloths will be matched in packaging, feel and 
smell to ensure a double blind.  
 
The intervention will be stopped if the participant is felt to have a safety concern (e.g. 
allergy to study product). Because neither chlorhexidine nor mild soap will worsen wounds with 
inadvertent contact, the intervention can be used on existing wounds and ulcers.  While unlikely, 
it is conceivable that a participant will need to be unblinded during the study.  See the SOP for 
Unblinding a Participant for additional information. 
7.[ADDRESS_904444] Description 
7.1.1 Acquisition 
SAGE 2% CHLORHEXIDINE GLUCONATE CLOTHS, SAGE COMFORT BATH 
CLOTHS and a chlorhexidine-compatible over-the-counter moisturizer will be shipped to the 
research offices of the principal investigator.

  147.1.2 Formulation, Packaging, and Labeling 
SAGE 2% CHLORHEXIDINE GLUCONATE CLOTHS is an FDA-approved medication 
packaged and labeled by [CONTACT_669784].  SAGE 2% CHLORHEXIDINE GLUCONATE 
CLOTHS is packaged with two 7.5in x 7.5in cloths to a package (3 sets of 2 cloth packages 
come bundled together). The product will be repackaged and labeled in a blinded fashion with 
seven cloths per package by [CONTACT_129179] a process that has been approved by [CONTACT_669785]. 
SAGE COMFORT BATH CLOTHS contains eight 7.5in x 7.5in cloths soaked in mild, 
rinse-free cleansers and skin-protecting moisturizers like aloe and vitamin E per package. The 
product will be repackaged and labeled in a blinded fashion with seven cloths per package by 
[CONTACT_129179] a process that has been approved by [CONTACT_669786]. 
The chlorhexidine-compatible over-the-counter moisturizer will be in its original 
packaging. 
7.1.[ADDRESS_904445] Storage and Stability 
SAGE 2% CHLORHEXIDINE GLUCONATE CLOTHS and SAGE COMFORT BATH 
CLOTHS will be stored between 20-25 C (68-77F), as directed by [CONTACT_87079]. The 
chlorhexidine-compatible over-the-counter moisturizer will be stored with the cloths.  The study 
products (cloths and moisturizer) will be stored in a locked room in either a research office of the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_669770] a manner approved by [CONTACT_669787]. 
7.2 Dosage, Preparation and Administration of Study Intervention 
The cloths and moisturizer will be applied by [CONTACT_669788].  
7.3 Modification of Study Intervention 
If a participant develops signs of intolerance to either cloth or chlorhexidine-compatible 
over-the-counter moisturizer, they will be stopped, and the reaction evaluated. Signs of 
intolerance include generalized redness, persistent itching, or swelling of the feet in the absence 
of other identifiable causes. The VAMHCS will provide treatment as appropriate and the 
participant will return for evaluation. If clinically appropriate and the participant is willing, we 
will start a lower dose (e.g., wipe every other day) and reevaluate. If problem recurs, discontinue 
use of wipes. If problem does not recur increase to full dose. If problem recurs on full dose, 
repeat and keep on reduced dose. 
7.[ADDRESS_904446] is dispensed only at an official study site by [CONTACT_557228].  
SAGE 2% CHLORHEXIDINE GLUCONATE CLOTHS/ SAGE COMFORT BATH 
CLOTHS and chlorhexidine-compatible over-the-counter moisturizer will be distributed to 
participants by [CONTACT_273683].  Documentation of all products received, distributed 
and destroyed will be kept by [CONTACT_200252].  
7.5 Assessment of Participant Compliance with Study Intervention 
Instructions regarding dosing, missed doses and possible side effects will be provided. 
Adherence with cloths will be measured by 1) using chlorhexidine measurement of the skin from 
Preventing Diabetic Foot Ulcers through Cleaner Feet 
 
  15non-invasive swabs of foot skin during each study visit, 2) counting remaining wipes in returned 
cloth wrappers and 3) having participants check off use on a monthly calendar. All will be 
returned to the study team during the in-person study visits. Participants doing remote study 
visits will report their number of remaining wipes over the phone, return their completed 
monthly calendars , and one additional bag of wipes will be prepared for each shipment to test 
confirmation of cloth type (chlorhexidine vs. placebo)

8.1 Study Visits 
 
Study visit windows are as follows: 
 Study visit #2 will occur 1 week after enrollment with a window of 3 to 28 days.  
 Study visit #3 will occur 12 weeks after study visit #2 with a window of 5 to 18 weeks. 
 Study visit #4 will occur 25 weeks after study visit #2 with a window of 19 to 31 weeks. 
 Study visit #5 will occur 38 weeks after study visit #2 with a window of 32 to 44 weeks. 
 Study visit #6 will occur 51 weeks after study visit #2 with a window of 45 to 53 weeks. 
 Study visit #[ADDRESS_904448] 2 weeks after visit #6 or after they stop using study 
wipes. For participants who were randomized and self-withdraw or are randomized and 
are withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_464], visit #[ADDRESS_904449] 2 weeks after they 
stop using study wipes. 
 
The participant interview portion of the study visit will be conducted by [CONTACT_669789]. Participants that wish to do visits 
remotely will be asked to swab their feet and mail it to the lab. They will also be asked to take  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_669771]. 
 
Missed visits will not be reported as deviations. 
 
Participants will either be texted or called weekly, depending on the participant’s preference as a 
reminder to use study medication.  Participants who prefer to receive weekly reminder texts will 
have the option to receive them from the Annie App. The Annie App is a new VA approved 
texting program that provides a full audit trail of all text communications with participating 
veterans. We will also call participants monthly to assess foot health. Participants will also be 
encouraged to call if they have foot related issues.  In the event there is a foot related issue, we 
will facilitate a visit to podiatry at the VAMHCS. 
Preventing Diabetic Foot Ulcers through Cleaner Feet 
 
  178.2 Laboratory Evaluations 
During each study visit a specimen is obtained by [CONTACT_669790]: anterior nares, and up to eight more swab areas on the feet.  If a participant 
has an existing full thickness area of skin breakdown on one of the foot skin sites, research 
personnel will not obtain a specimen from that site. These specimens are tested for S. aureus  and 
microbial burden using microbiological and PCR based methods and are also analyzed for the 
presence of all bacteria using metagenomics techniques.  The swabs from visit # 2, #3, and #7 
will be cultured for specific pathogens ( E. spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, 
Acinetobacter baumannii , Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecium  and diabetic 
foot infection pathogens) as well as E. coli, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus faecalis . Minimum 
inhibitory concentrations to chlorhexidine and to key antibiotics. 
8.[ADDRESS_904450] all of the information required to follow those reporting requirements. Reportable 
New Information2 will be reported to the IRB within 5 business days. 
10 Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_669772]-approved protocol, all applicable federal and state regulations, VHA Handbook 
1200.05 Requirements for the Protection of Human Subjects in Research and the International 
Conference on Harmonization, E6 Good Clinical Practice by [CONTACT_669791], documenting and reporting complete and accurate data.  A separate Data Quality 
Assurance Plan will be developed for this protocol to describe the frequency of review of study 
related data and the roles and responsibilities for activities related to Quality Control.   
11 Statistical Plan 
11.1 Analysis Plan 
Primary objective : We hypothesize that the chlorhexidine group will have longer times to new 
foot complication event (chronic foot ulcer, foot infection, or foot amputation) than the placebo 
group. We will non-parametrically describe the distribution of “survival” times, from 
randomization until foot complication, in each group with a Kaplan-Meier curve as well as 
calculate the 75th percentile and median survival time, if possible. The log-rank test will test the 
null hypothesis of no difference in the distribution of times to foot complication between the two 
arms.  In primary analyses, death will generally be treated as a non-informative censoring 
mechanism.  Secondary analyses using more sophisticated models (e.g. Cox regression, partial 
competing risks model) will be utilized if there are significant prognosticator imbalances, death 
rates, or interval censoring Adherence with treatment will be examined as a potential moderator 
using Cox regression. A participant’s medical chart will continue to be monitored for trial 
outcomes even if the patient stops participating in treatment (chlorhexidine or placebo) unless

Preventing Diabetic Foot Ulcers through Cleaner Feet 
 
  18the patient withdraws consent for the study to continue to review their medical chart.  Hence, 
generally the primary analysis will be intent-to-treat.   For planning a larger clinical trial, we will 
also estimate the hazard ratio of new foot complications for chlorhexidine versus placebo with a 
95% confidence interval.   
Secondary objective : We hypothesize that a) the chlorhexidine group will not be colonized with 
Enterobacter spp., S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa and E. faecium  
(ESKAPE) and diabetic foot infection pathogens with a higher minimum inhibitory 
concentration (MIC) to chlorhexidine than the placebo group. All study participants colonized 
with pathogens at the V7 time point will be included in the primary analysis. The null hypothesis 
of no difference in MIC distribution will be tested with the nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum 
test due to the range-limited, discrete distributions of MICs. Effect sizes will be expressed in 
terms of means on a log(2) scale because the mean as an effect size metric will be more sensitive 
to group differences than the median. In addition, we will compute 95% confidence intervals 
around effect size estimates to quantify the precision of estimates. 
Exploratory objective : This objective is not hypothesis driven. We will explore the impact of 
chlorhexidine on the diversity of the skin microbiota of the feet and the impact of the diversity of 
the skin microbiota on the development of new foot complications. 
11.1 Sample Size Calculation 
How many participants (or specimens, or charts) will be used in this study? 
Local: 200    Worldwide: [ADDRESS_904451] (two-tailed, 5% significance level).  We 
assume that 10% of participants will die prior to one year of follow-up. We used the Freedman 
method for sample size calculation reported in Machin et al. (1997) using NCSS PASS software 
(2011).  Prior data suggest that the annual proportion of individuals with new foot complications 
among controls will be about 0.4. If the true proportion for experimental participants is 0.[ADDRESS_904452] the difference if 100 
patients are randomize to each study arm (i.e. total N=200).  
12 Ethical Considerations 
This study will be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical 
Practice (FDA regulations 21 CFR 312 for IND studies and FDA guidance E6) for all studies.  
Applicable government regulations, VHA Handbook 1200.[ADDRESS_904453] be signed by [CONTACT_2299], and the investigator-designated research professional obtaining 
the consent.  
13 Data Collection, Handling and Storage 
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_307589], completeness, legibility, 
and timeliness of the data reported.  Data collection is the responsibility of the study staff. All 
Preventing Diabetic Foot Ulcers through Cleaner Feet 
 
  19study personnel will be current in Information Security Training (VHA Privacy and Information 
Security and Rules of Behavior Training). 
Paper records or case report forms will be filled out at the participating clinical sites or in 
the research team offices. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_669773].  All source 
documents will be completed in a legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.  When 
making changes or corrections, the original entry will be crossed out with a single line, and the 
change initialed and dated.  Erasing, overwriting, or use of correction fluid or tape will not be 
done. 
All source documents and laboratory reports will be reviewed by [CONTACT_307607], who will ensure that they are accurate and complete.  AEs must be graded, assessed 
for severity and causality, and reviewed by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_1461].  
Confidentiality will be maintained to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_2371]. Research records 
generated in this study will be transported from clinical protocol study site to data entry site by 
[CONTACT_3462], accompanied by [CONTACT_669792]. Data will be maintained on a secure electronic 
central database on a VA research server (OITBALFPCRSCH01). Identifiable electronic study 
data will never be removed from behind the VA firewall. Analysis of identifiable study data will 
be performed only behind the VA firewall. Data will be backed up according to the VA network 
back up schedule.  Paper records will be stored in locked filing cabinets behind a locked door in 
office space at the University of Maryland Baltimore that is accessible to the study PI. 
Identifiable records at UMB will only be accessible by [CONTACT_669793]. Study 
personnel who leave the research team will have their access to study data removed immediately. 
If data is lost/stolen, the VAMHCS, ISO/PO/PI [INVESTIGATOR_669774]. 
A unique identifier or code will be assigned to each participant. Bacterial isolates and culture 
specimens and datasets used for analysis will be labeled with this code instead of the subject 
name [CONTACT_23148]. There will be no identifiable data on any of the samples or data sent to the UMB 
microbiology lab. Only the study personnel who directly interact with subject or manage the 
subject’s clinical protocol data will have access to participant identifying information, which will 
be kept behind the VA firewall on the OITBALFPCRSCH01.VA05.med.va.gov server, in the 
folder \\\roghmann_share\Diabetic Foot Clinical Trial_HP79894\Databases\Main Study 
Database. Culture data will be entered directly into the relational database; however, 
microbiology laboratory personnel will not have access to participant identifiers in the database. 
Microbiological samples will be transferred to [CONTACT_307616]’s VA lab (Baltimore VA Medical 
Center, Microbiology Research Lab, 3C-112) on an ongoing, regular basis (approximately 
quarterly). The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_669775] 10-1. As soon as permitted and when data collection is complete - 
source documents will be shredded and identifying information (names/SSN) will be removed 
from the database. There will be a single data table which maintains the link between the unique 
code and patient identifiers. This table will be maintained on a VA server. As soon as permitted 
and when data collection is complete, the link between code and identifying information will be 
deleted on the server and in any backups. If any paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_307584], they 
will be shredded. 
 
14 VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) 
The VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) is a major informatics initiative of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that provides a secure, central analytic platform for 
Preventing Diabetic Foot Ulcers through Cleaner Feet 
 
  20performing research and supporting clinical operations activities. It is a partnership between the 
VA Office of Information Technology (OI&T) and the Veterans Health Administration Office of 
Research and Development (VHA ORD). VINCI includes a cluster of servers for securely 
hosting suites of databases integrated from select national VA data sources. VINCI servers for 
data, applications and virtual sessions are physically located at the VA Austin Information 
Technology Center (AITC), located in Austin, [LOCATION_007]. This secure enclave with 105 high-
performance servers and 1.5 petaby[CONTACT_92525]-speed data storage has multiple layers of security 
and disaster recovery to prevent data loss. 
 
To ensure the protection of Veteran data, VINCI maintains compliance with the guidelines set 
forth by [CONTACT_92526] (VHA) Handbook 1200.12, Use of Data and Data 
Repositories in VHA Research, and all other applicable VA and VHA policies and regulations. 
In addition, VINCI has undergone all security certification activities in support of obtaining an 
Authorization to Operate (ATO). Access to VINCI resources are approved in accordance with 
the requirements of National Data Systems (NDS), VHA Handbook 1200.12, Use of Data and 
Data Repositories in VHA Research, and all other applicable VA and VHA policies and 
regulations. All data transferred from VINCI is subject to audit for compliance. 
 
VA-credentialed research or operations staff are granted access to study-specific data along with 
tools for analysis and reporting in the secure, virtual working environment through a certified 
VHA network computer within the VA.  If not working within a VA or VHA hosted office 
environment containing VA network access, researchers may apply for and then access VINCI 
through an approved Virtual Private Network (VPN) and Remote Desktop application. The 
remote computing environment enables data analysis to be performed directly on VINCI servers, 
offering a number of advantages: uniform security standards for access; a common point of entry 
for all investigators who use the data; tools for analysis and reporting; tighter and more 
consistent control of data quality; and the ability to standardize and update terminology and 
format as technology and methodology improve.  
 
Data Collection 
VA provides care to Veterans at over 1,[ADDRESS_904454] system known as the 
Veterans Information System Technology Architecture (VistA). VistA provides a longitudinal 
view for patients receiving care nationwide including diagnoses, procedures, medications, labs, 
physiologic measurements, and text notes and reports. VA uses [ADDRESS_904455] over 20 million Veterans 
historically. The aggregate content of these 130 VistA systems includes 2.3 billion documents 
(e.g., Progress Notes, Discharge Summaries, Reports) accumulating at a rate of 696,000 each 
day; 6.2 billion lab values (+1.5 million each day), 3.4 billion orders (+845,000 each day), and 
1.7 billion medication administrations and prescription fills (+390,000 each day). 
 
Data are aggregated from individual VistA systems to the VA Corporate Data Warehouse where 
it is modeled and prepared for use. Data published by [CONTACT_92527] (DSS), 
Inpatient and Outpatient Medical SAS (MedSAS), VA Health Economics Resource Center 
(HERC) cost data, Vital Status and VA-CMS linked data files maintained by [CONTACT_669794] (VIReC), CDC National Death Index VA-linked data, and several other 
specialty data sets can be requested through VINCI. VA National Data Services and other data 
stewards regulate the right to use the data, but VINCI facilitates the process. When study 
Preventing Diabetic Foot Ulcers through Cleaner Feet 
 
  21requests are approved, project-specific data are extracted from source databases and placed in 
SQL tables accessible only to the research team and VINCI data managers. 
 
Storage of Study Data 
Study data will be kept in accordance with the Department of Veterans Affairs Record Control 
Schedule 10-1 (RCS 10-1). Storage and transfer of any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) 
or Protected Health Information (PHI) must be done in accordance with applicable VA and VHA 
policies and directives, state and federal regulations, and applicable statutes including the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability ACT (HIPAA). Unless explicitly requested and 
approved by [CONTACT_669795], all sensitive patient data must remain on VINCI project servers and 
only aggregate data without PII / PHI may be transferred from VINCI. Any desired change in 
data storage location or transfer requires amending the original data request with an updated of 
disposition of study data. The amendment must be approved by [CONTACT_669796].  
 
Violations of data policy or approved use of data will be subject to full penalty of law, which 
may include suspension of access privileges, reprimand, suspension from work, demotion, 
removal, and criminal and civil penalties. 
 
Upon completion of the research project, the study principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_669776] (ISO), and in accordance with VA policy, will ensure that, 
study data containing sensitive, confidential information will be returned to the VA, sanitized 
and removed from all servers, desktops, removable storage devices, etc. 
 
Data Access 
Only study team personnel explicitly authorized by [CONTACT_459330]. The study principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_92483]. VINCI data 
managers and VA OI&T personnel not under the purview of the study principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_92484], network, processors, firewall and software in the VINCI environment, 
including access rights granted to study personnel. 
 
When study personnel are no longer part of the research team, the study principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_459292]’s access to all study data and notify 
the VA Information Security Officer of such action. No sensitive patient data may be shared with 
anyone who does not have a VA appointment. All study team personnel with access to sensitive 
patient data must stay current on required VA information security and privacy policy trainings. 
 
Data Storage Location 
Study data stored on VINCI servers is located at the Austin Information Technology Center, 
[ADDRESS_904456]., Austin, TX [ZIP_CODE]. The specific server where the data are stored 
within the VINCI environment will be chosen by [CONTACT_92531]. The server name [CONTACT_459350]. 
 
Specialized Software 
All software used to access sensitive patient data, whether provided by [CONTACT_92532], or developed by 
[CONTACT_3476], will run in virtual desktop sessions on VINCI servers within the Austin 
Information Technology Center. 
 
Preventing Diabetic Foot Ulcers through Cleaner Feet 
 
  2215 Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients (CRISP) 
CRISP is a regional health information exchange serving Maryland and the District of Columbia. 
The CRISP Portal is a free tool available to clinical staff. As clinical information is created and 
shared with CRISP, it is made accessible in real time to participating health providers through 
the CRISP Portal.  The portal gives providers the ability to securely look up patient information 
though the internet.  CRISP allows physicians and other authorized people to see healthcare 
activity at other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. For this study, if an enrolled veteran seeks healthcare outside of the 
VA, researchers will be able to review the records in CRISP for that care to determine the study 
outcome.  Identifying information for study participants will be securely transmitted between 
study personnel and CRISP using FIPS 140-2 validated encryption during transmission.

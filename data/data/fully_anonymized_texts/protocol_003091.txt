 Protocol synopsis  
Title of study : A prospective, randomized, single center pi[INVESTIGATOR_536773], adverse events and tolerability of Zortress® (everolimus) versus Rapamune® (sirolimus) in 
combination with low dose Neoral® (cyclosporine) dosed by C2 monitoring, in deceased and living 
donor renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_536772] a Thymoglobulin® (antithymocyte globulin) and rapid steroid 
induction protoco l. 
Purpose  and rationale : Our center’s renal transplant immunosuppression protocol has consisted of 
Thymoglobulin and steroid induction for 5 doses only, with early initiation of Rapamune® (sirolimus) 
and then Neoral for nearly a decade now.  We do observe  a significant amount of adverse events in 
our patient population, with many of these potentially related to the sirolimus.  The combination of 
“half-dose” cyclosporine (early C2 levels around 800 to 1000 ng/ml) allows us to minimize calcineurin 
inhibitor toxicity and its combination with the mTOR drug sirolimus provides excellent protection 
against acute rejection in our renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Our earlier experience with everolimus and 
the recent publications describing renal recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ outcomes wi th this drug, suggest to us that our 
patients may do better on everolimus than sirolimus.  For our center, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_536774]®, our current standard of care, or Zortress®, the study drug.  
Objectives : The primary objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_536775]® as 
compared to Rapamune® when used in our de novo immunosuppression re gimen following renal 
transplantation. The primary endpoint will be a composite endpoint  of graft survival (non -death 
censored) and biopsy proven acute rejection at 1 year. The primary outcome of immunosuppressive 
protection would be studied in our Thymogl obulin and rapid steroid discontinuation protocol, with “half -
dose” Neoral as described above.  
Secondary outcomes would include factors involved with adverse events and tolerability and would 
include: renal graft survival (non -death censored) and biopsy pr oven acute rejection at [ADDRESS_698998] -transplant 
to look for histologica l evidence of graft injury, early and late wound complications, infections including 
CMV, EBV and BK infections as monitored by [CONTACT_536797], lipid panel testing, particularly 
triglycerides, cardiac events such as acute myocardial infarctions or Conge stive Heart Failure 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], and tolerability of the Neoral and mTOR combination as determined by [CONTACT_536798], with attempt to document why 
the patient did not tolerate the drug comb ination.   
Exploratory objectives would include molecular markers indicative of kidney and vascular endothelial 
function.  
Population : The patient population will be all adults (18 -75 years of age ) who receive a living donor or 
deceased donor renal transpl ant as a first or subsequent renal transplant procedure only (no extra -
renal organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]).  We will invite any patient who would normally be considered for our 
current Sirolimus®/ Neoral® protocol with Thymoglobulin® and steroid induction t o consent for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_536776] -operatively if the transplant surgeon anticipates normal 
early graft function.  We would propose to enroll a total of 60 patients.  
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria :  
 Inclusion Criteria  
 Primary renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_536777] 18 and 75 years of age.  
 Females capable of becoming pregnant must have a negative pregnancy test prior to 
transplantation and practice an effective form of birth control for the duration of the study.  
 
7 
  Exclusion Cr iteria  
 Total cholesterol > 300 mg/dl or triglycerides > 400 mg/dl despi[INVESTIGATOR_536778]  
 Pre-existing bone marrow suppression (WBC < 3000, platelets < 100,000)  
 Positive crossmatch or ABO incompatible  
 Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pr egnancy is defined as the state of a female 
after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive serum human 
chorionic gonadotrophin laboratory test (>5 mIU/mL)  
 Women of child -bearing potential, defined as all women physiologica lly capable of becoming 
pregnant, including women whose career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation precludes intercourse 
with a male partner and women whose partners have been sterilized by [CONTACT_536799], UNLESS they are using two birth control me thods. The two methods can be a double 
barrier method or a barrier method plus a hormonal method.  
 Adequate barrier methods of contraception include: diaphragm, condom (by [CONTACT_47446]), intrauterine device (copper or hormonal), sponge or spermicide. Hormona l 
contraceptives include any marketed contraceptive agent that includes an estrogen 
and/or a progestational agent.  
 Reliable contraception should be maintained throughout the study and for 12 weeks  
after study drug discontinuation.  
 Women are considered post -menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they 
have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical 
profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of 
spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels > 40 mIU/mL and estradiol 
< 20 pg/mL] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without 
hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when 
the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_6492] u p hormone level 
assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

adjusted for white blood count and platelet count, as well as appropriate levels of the two maintenance 
immunosuppressive agents, and steroids gi ven as methylprednisone IV for two doses, then oral 
prednisone at: 500 mg, 200 mg, 125 mg, 50 mg, and 25 mg.   
Study design : Randomized, single center parallel -group, open -label study . 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_536779].  
Eligibility:  All primary or r etransplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_536780] . 
Treatment scheme is as described above, with Sol umedrol 500 mg IV in OR as induction, then 5 
doses of Thymoglobulin starting morning of POD 1 at 1.25 mg/dose (rounded to nearest 25 mg) with 
8 
 rapid steroid taper over five doses.  The mTOR inhibitor drug will be started on POD 0 and Neoral 
introduced as re nal function recovers, usually starting on POD 2.  
Measurement/Assessments: as described above, graft and patient survival per standard definitions, 
clinically indicated biopsies for determination of acute cellular or antibody mediated rejection, renal 
function as estimated from serum Cr based on MDRD, clinic visits for wound assessment, standard of 
care labs for renal function, bone marrow function (WBC and platelet count), liver function, lipid panel, 
donor specific antibody determination during any signif icant increase in serum Cr, drug levels routinely 
monitored for need of number of dose adjustments and compliance, Emergency Room and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], as well as unscheduled clinic and other physician visits.  For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we would 
perform schedul ed CMV, EBV and serum BK PCRs monthly for the first year, then quarterly or with 
any viral symptoms.  
Potential study participants will be approached for consent immediately prior to transplantation by [CONTACT_536803] . If the transplant candidate agrees to participate he/she will be categorized 
as a living or deceased donor kidney recipi[INVESTIGATOR_536781]. The candidate will then be randomized, in a 2:1 fashion, to either the Zortress or 
Rapamune study arm. Following transplantation all recipi[INVESTIGATOR_536782] 
1.25 mg/kg starting on POD #1 for 4 to 5 doses adjus ted for white  blood count and platelet count.  All 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_536783], then oral prednisone at: 
500 mg, 200 mg, 125 mg, 50 mg, and 25 mg  and will receive delayed  Neoral® on POD #2 -3 dosed to

Rapamune® study arm recipi[INVESTIGATOR_536784], dosed to achieve target  levels of 
10 to 18 ng/ml by [CONTACT_536801],  or 8 to 12 by [CONTACT_29864] -MS methodology.  Neoral and Rapamune/Zortress 
levels will be monitored twice weekly for the first [ADDRESS_699007] patient visit, then several 
months for completion of paper work.  This will be about 4.5 to 5 years.  
Efficacy assessments :  
 Incidence of graft loss in the first po st-transplant year  
 Incidence of patient death in the first post -transplant year  
 Incidence of acute rejection at [ADDRESS_699008] -transplant  
 
Other assessments :  
 Incidence of non -death censored graft loss at 6 months, 2 and 3 years after transplantation  
 Number a nd grade of acute rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_10092] 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years after 
transplantation  
 Tolerability of Zortress at [ADDRESS_699009] -transplant  
 Estimated GFR at 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years after transplantation  
 Incidence of CMV, EBV and BK infections  1 year a fter transplantation  
 Results of 12 month surveillance biopsies  
 Lipid panels and use of lipid lowering medications at 1 year after transplant  
 Incidence of MI and CHF at 1 and 3 years after transplant

  Incidence of wound infection at 1 year after transplanta tion 
 Incidence of lymphocele at 1 year after transplantation  
 Plasma concentrations of S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) and S -adenosyl methionine 
(SAM) Plasma concentrations of endothelial dysfunction markers (symmetric and asymmetric 
dimethyl arginine (SDMA, A DMA), L -arginine, L -citrulline, L -ornithine cysteine, and 
homocysteine over the observation period  
 Plasma concentrations of bioactive lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (HODEs, HEPEs, HETEs, and prostaglandins) over the 
observation period  
 Plasma protein patterns  
Data analysis : The in cidence of graft loss, patient death, and acute rejection will be compared by [CONTACT_536805]. Patient and graft Kaplan -Meier survival curves will be compared by [CONTACT_279813].  
We hypothesize there will be no statistically significant difference betwe en the treatment arms. As this 
is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], it was not statistically powered to detect subtle differences in outcome. All continuous 
variables such as serum creatinine, cGFR, serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], WBC, platelets, etcetera will be compared by 
[CONTACT_32206]’s t test.  Any other dichotomous variables will be compared by [CONTACT_536806].

 1 Background  
Two prospective randomized trials (A2306 and A2307) have demonstrated that everolimus 
combined with steroids and low dose Neoral with (A2307) or without (A2306) basilixim ab 
induction result in  excellent 1 year outcomes (1). In [ADDRESS_699010] -transplant has been between 7% and  10% for any given calendar year. However, 
many patients need to have their Rapamune discontinued due to drug related side effects or 
compliance difficulties related to the noon dosing (when most  other medications are taken at 8 
am and 4 pm). We feel strongly that use of an alternative drug to Rapamune in such cases is 
necessary . Use of Zortress in this setting would be ideal, however, no data currently exists 
concerning the use of Zortress with N eoral in a steroid free maintenance immunosuppression 
regimen following Thymoglobulin  induction. Thus we propose this pi[INVESTIGATOR_536785]. Secondarily we 
are interested in chara cterizing the Zortress drug related side effect profile to enable us in the 
future to exploit any favorable differences between Zortress and Rapamune.  
2 Purpose and rationale  
Our center’s renal transplant immunosuppression protocol has consisted of Thymoglob ulin 
and steroid induction for 5 doses only, with early initiation of Rapamune® (Sirolimus) and 
then Neoral for nearly a decade now.  We do observe a significant amount of adverse events 
in our patient population, with many of th ese potentially related to the S irolimus.  The 
combination of “half -dose” cyclosporine (early C2 levels around 800 to 1000 ng/ml) allows us 
to minimize calcineurin inhibitor toxicity and its combination with the mTOR drug Sirolimus 
provides excellent protection against acute rejecti on in our renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] .  Our 
earlier experience with E verolimus and the recent publications describing renal recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ 
outcomes with this drug, suggest to us that  our patients may do better on Everolimus than 
Sirolimus  (1,2) .  For our cent er, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_536786]®, our current standard of care, or Zortress®, the study drug.  
3 Objectives  
3.1 Primar y objectives  
The primary objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_536775]® as 
compared to Rapamune® when used in our de novo immunosuppression regimen following 
renal transplantation. The primary endpoint will be a composite endpo int of graft survival 
(non-death censored) and biopsy proven acute rejection at 1 year. The primary outcome of 
immunosuppressive protection would be studied in our Thymoglobulin and rapid steroid 
discontinuation protocol, with “half -dose” Neoral as describ ed above.  
11 
 3.2 Secondary objectives  
Secondary outcomes would include factors involved with adverse events and tolerability and 
would include: renal graft survival (non -death censored) and biopsy proven acute rejection at 
[ADDRESS_699011] -transplant to look for histological evidence of graft injury, early and late 
wound complications, infections including CMV, EBV and BK infections as monitored by 
[CONTACT_536797], lipid panel testing, particularly triglycerides, cardiac events such as acute 
myocardial infarctions or Congestive Heart Failure epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], and tolerability of the Neoral 
and mTOR combination as determined by [CONTACT_536807], with attempt to document why the patient did not 
tolerate the drug combination.  All objectives are exploratory in nature as this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
3.3 Exploratory objectives  
4  To explore the kidney and vascular endothelial function 
assessed by a panel of molecular markers over the 
observation period. Study design  
Randomized, single center parallel -group, open -label study.  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_536787].  
Eligibility:  All primary or retransplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_536788]. 
Treatment scheme is as described above, with Solumedrol 500 mg IV in OR as induction, then 
5 doses of Thymoglobulin starting morning of POD 1 at 1.25 mg/dose (rounded to nearest 25 
mg) with rapid steroid taper over five doses.  The mTOR inhibitor drug w ill be started on 
POD 0 and Neoral introduced as renal function recovers, usually starting on POD 2.  
Measurement/Assessments: as described above, graft and patient survival per standard 
definitions, clinically indicated biopsies for determination of acute cellular or antibody 
mediated rejection, renal function as estimated from serum Cr based on MDRD, clinic visits 
for wound assessment, standard of care labs for renal function, bone marrow function (WBC

any significant increase in serum Cr, drug levels routinely monitored for need of number of 
dose adjustments and compliance, Emergency Room and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], as well as 
unscheduled clinic and other physician vis its.  For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we would perform 
scheduled CMV, EBV and serum BK PCRs monthly for the first year, then quarterly or with 
any viral symptoms.  
A subset of patients will have coded plasma samples sent to clinical research and development 
at the Uni versity of Colorado. These biomarker samples will be used to assess vascular 
endothelial dysfunction and inflammation markers as well as kidney dysfunction markers.  
[ADDRESS_699012] of care.   
5 Population  
The patient population will be all adults (18 -75 years of age ) who receive a living donor or 
deceased donor renal transplant as a first or subsequent renal transplant procedure only (no 
extra -renal organ  transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]).  We will invite any patient who would normally be 
considered for our current Sirolimus®/ Neoral® protocol with Thymoglobulin® and steroid 
induction to consent for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_536789] -operatively if 
the transplant surgeon anticipates normal early graft function.  If there were significant 
concerns for prolonged graft dysfunction, then the patients will not be invited into the pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480].  Invited patients would include anyone currently not on steroid s prior to transplantation, 
and those with no known intolerance to any of the drugs mentioned.  Patients must also be 
willing to perform the expectations of the study protocol reliably.  
This will be a single center pi[INVESTIGATOR_536790] U niversity

patients per year qualify for the study, then a conservative esti mate of 75 enrolled patients a 
year is possible.  We would propose to enroll a total of 60 patients over 12 months, and then 
follow these patients for a complete 3 years.  We will randomize 2:[ADDRESS_699014] to fulfill all of the following criteri a at the 
time of enrollment : 
1. Patients must give written informed consent before any assessment is performed.  
2. Primary renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_536791] a ges [ADDRESS_699015] prior to 
transplantation and practice an effective form of birth control for the duration of the 
study  and 12 weeks after discontinuation of the study drug  if applicable .

malignancy for at least 2 years prior to the transplant  
 Allergy or intolerance to sirolimus, everolimus, cyclosporine, or ATG  
6 Treatment  
6.1 Investigational and control drugs  
Zortress will be started on P OD #0 and initially dosed at 0.75  mg BID (12 hours apart) dosed 
simultaneously with Neoral and the dose adjusted thereafter to achieve a target trough serum 
level between 3 ng/ml and 8 ng/ml. Sirolimus will be dosed per our sta ndard approach, 
specifically started on POD #0 at 5  mg/d , decreasing to 3 mg/d on POD #2,  and adjusted 
thereafter at achieve a target trough serum level of 10 to 18 ng/ml by [CONTACT_536801], or  8 to 12 by 
[CONTACT_29864]-MS methodology.  
14 
 6.2 Treatment arms  
Patients will be assigned to one of the following “n” treatment arms in a ratio of 2:1; Zortress 
or Sirolimus  started on POD 0 , with Solumedrol 500 mg IV in OR as induction, then 5 doses 
of Thymoglobulin starting morning of POD 1 at 1.25 mg/dose (rounded to nearest 25 mg) 
with rapid steroid taper over five doses.  Neoral  will be introduced as renal function recovers, 
usually starting on POD 2.  We will enroll a total of 60 patients.  
 Zortress and Neoral, with Thymoglobulin induction and perioperative steroids  
 Rapamycin and Ne oral, with Thymoglobulin induction and perioperative steroids  
6.3 Treatment assignment  
Randomization will be stratified by  [CONTACT_536809] (living or deceased donor 
kidney) and primary versus retransplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  Randomization will be performe d using a 
random number generator.  
6.[ADDRESS_699016] operating procedures.  
6.5.3  Study drug supply, storage and tracking  
As this is an open -label study utilizing currently commercially available drugs, special 
arrangements for study drug supply, storage and tracki ng will not be necessary.  
6.5.4  Permitted study drug dose adjustments and interruptions  
Zortress and Sirolimus dose adjustments and interruptions will be allowed and will be made at 
the discretion of the treating physician. All drug adjustments and interruptions  will be 
recorded and monitored for this study, which requires little additional effort as this is already 
our current practice.  
15 
 6.5.5  Study drug discontinuation and premature patient withdrawal  
As we currently do for Sirolimus, Zortress dosing will be decreased  or discontinued  when the 
transplant physician deems appropriate due to deleterious side effects or the presence of 
infection or malignancy where a reduction in overall immunosuppression in desirable.  
 
6.5.6  Early study termination   
Early study termination will be considered if there is a statistically significant difference in 
primary outcome between the 2 study arms and it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_536793]

3: Cyclosporine and Zortress  levels are monitored twice weekly for [ADDRESS_699017] -transplant.  
4: Plasma for biomarkers will be  assessed at the University of Colorado in a subset of patients using 
existing plasma samples.  
 
Patients will be followed as per the standard of care at this transplant center (The Ohio State 
University Medical Center, Division of Transplantation).  Addit ional study procedures include a protocol 
biopsy at month 12 and some additional laboratory work at screening/baseline and at months 6, 12, 
24, and 36.  
7.2 Information to be collected on screening failures  
No information will be collected on patients failing t he screening process.  
 
7.3 Patient demographics/other baseline characteristics  
Patient demographics are routinely captured within our transplant database and as such will be 
available for anal ysis. Demographic data collection   includes, but is not limited to, name, age, 
gender, race, cause of renal failure, years on dialysis, sensitization status (PRA),  
7.[ADDRESS_699018] 3 months after 
transplant, once weekly between mont hs 3 and 6, every other week between months 6 and 12, 
and monthly thereafter. Compliance with Zortress can be determined based on serum trough 
levels.

 8 Safety monitoring  
8.1 Adverse events  
Adverse events t hat the investigators consider to be clinically significant and associated with the use of 
Zortress® or Rapamune® will be recorded at each study visit.  Serious adverse events will be reported 
to [COMPANY_001] w ithin 24 hours of discovery or notification.  An a dverse event will be considered serious if 
it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Results in death,  
 Is life threatening (an adverse event is considered “life -threatening: if, in the view of  
the investigator , its occurrence places the subject at imme diate risk of  
death. It does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form,  
might have caused death),  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or substantial disruption of the  
ability to conduct normal life func tions,  
 Results in congenital anomaly, or birth defect,  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28939]  
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2476]/observation/examination caused by [CONTACT_536810]).  
 Other medically impor tant events  
Follow -up information for serious adverse events will be collected, recorded, and reported to [COMPANY_001] .   
Adverse events that meet IRB reporting requirements will be submitted to the IRB for review.  
8.2 Serious adverse event reporting  
To ensure pat ient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring after the 
patient has provided informed consent and until 30 days after the patient has stopped study 
participation (defined as time of last dose of study drug taken or last visit whichev er is later) . 
Any SAEs experienced after this [ADDRESS_699022] be r eported to 
[COMPANY_001]  within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up 
to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, 
and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or materna l and/or 
newborn complications.

 9 Data review and database management  
9.1 Data collection  
Patient data will be collected/retained within our transplant patient database as per our normal 
operating procedure and thus immediately available  and retrievable for subsequent analyses. 
The data is housed within the Ohio State University Medical Centers Transplant server 
located in a locked, secure facility.  
9.[ADDRESS_699023] for all patients treated by [CONTACT_536811].  
10 Data analysis  (Any or all sections may be included based on 
type of study)  
10.1 Analysis of the primary objective(s)  
10.1.[ADDRESS_699024] -transplant. These events  will be directly measured and not calculated.  
10.1.2  Statistical hypothesis, model, and method of analysis  
The primary endpoint will be a composite endpoint of  graft survival (non -death censored) and 
biopsy proven acute rejection at 1 year.  
Secondary endpoints a t 6 months, 1, 2 and 3 years will include: graft survival and patient 
survival/death at [ADDRESS_699025], lipid control as determined by [CONTACT_536812] -lipid medications and average 
levels with and without medications, ability to maintain initial immunosuppressive 
medications and reason for switch if required, wound complications as determined by [CONTACT_536813], infection treatment with antibiotics, presence of hernia on exam and 
requirement for hernia repair, as well as presence of symptomatic lymphocele, and New Onset 
Diabetes After Transplant as determined by [CONTACT_536814].  
Statistical analysis will  be performed on SPSS or STATA software with dichotomous 
variables evaluated by [CONTACT_177610] -Squared analysis, continuous variables by [CONTACT_15914]’s T -Test, non -
parametric outcomes will be assessed by [CONTACT_536815]  (Mann -Whitney U test).  
Kaplan -Meier survival curves with log rank tests will be used to determine a difference in 
graft and patient survival over time.  
Safety data will include patient and graft survival, biopsy proven acute rejection, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_536794].  
 
21 
 10.1.3  Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations  
Patients lost to follow -up or discontinued from the study will be censored from further 
analysis at the time of their withdrawal from the study.  
10.2 Analysis of secondary objectives  
10.2.1  Efficacy (seconda ry) 
Secondary endpoints at 6 months, 1, 2 and 3 years will include: graft survival and patient 
survival/death at [ADDRESS_699026], lipid control as determined by [CONTACT_536812] -lipid medications and average 
levels with and without medications, ability to maintain initial immunosuppressive 
medications and reason for switch if required, wound complica tions as determined by [CONTACT_536816], infection treatment with antibiotics, presence of hernia on exam and 
requirement for hernia repair, as well as presence of symptomatic lymphocele, and New Onset 
Diabetes After Transplant as determined by [CONTACT_536817].  
Statistical analysis will be performed on SPSS or STATA software with dichotomous 
variables evaluated by [CONTACT_177610] -Squared analysis, continuous variables by [CONTACT_15914]’s T -Test, non -
parametric outcomes will be assessed by [CONTACT_536815] (Mann -Whitney U test).  
Kaplan -Meier survival curves with log rank tests will be used to determine a difference in 
graft and patient survival over time.  
 
10.2.2  Safety  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_536818][INVESTIGATOR_536795] d patient survival on a 
monthly basis as we currently do for our center’s quality assurance reviews.  Any apparent 
differences in outcome showing a disadvantage to the patient’s in the Zortress group will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_536819].  
10.[ADDRESS_699027] to demonstrate non -inferiority of the primary endpoint for patients in the Zortress 
study arm.  
11 Ethical considerations  
11.1 Regulatory and ethical compliance  
This clinical study was designed and shall be implemented and reported in accordance with 
the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with applicable local 
regulations (including European Directive 2001/20/EC, US Code of Federal Regul ations Title 
21, and Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare), and with the ethical principles laid 
down in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
11.2 Informed consent procedures  
Eligible patients may only be included in the study after providing written (witnes sed, where 
required by [CONTACT_6617]), IRB/IEC/REB -approved informed consent, or, if incapable of 
doing so, after such consent has been provided by a legally acceptable representative of the 
patient.  In cases where the patient’s representative gives co nsent, the patient should be 
informed about the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding.  If the patient is 
capable of doing so, he/she should indicate assent by [CONTACT_348455] a separ ate assent form.  Informed consent must be obtained 
before conducting any study -specific procedures ( i.e. all of the procedures described in the 
protocol). The process of obtaining informed consent should be documented in the patient 
source documents.   
Wome n of child bearing potential should be informed that taking the study medication may 
involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that 
in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception re quirement for the 
duration of the study.  If there is any question that the patient will not reliably comply, they 
should not be entered in the study.  
11.3 Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB/IEC/REB  
The protocol and the proposed informed consent form m ust be reviewed and approved by a 
properly constituted Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee/Research 
Ethics Board (IRB/IEC/REB) before study start.  A signed and dated statement that the 
protocol and informed consent have been approved by  [CONTACT_1201]/IEC/REB must be given to 
[COMPANY_001] before study initiation.  
11.[ADDRESS_699028] be approved by [CONTACT_5343] , Health Authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC/REB. 
Only amendments that are required for patient safety may be implemented pri or to 
IRB/IEC/REB approval. Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol 
amendments, the investigator is expected to take any immediate action required for the safety 
of any patient included in this study, even if this action represents a devia tion from the 
protocol.

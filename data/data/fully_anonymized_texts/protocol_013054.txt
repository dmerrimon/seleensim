1. Introduction  
Public Health  Impact of Venous Thromboembolism  
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprised of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or 
pulmonary embolism (PE), affects 350,[ADDRESS_787215] shown that VTE prophylaxis is vastly underutilized in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]3, 4 and the  Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has listed 
strategies to improve VTE prevention on its top ten list for patient safety practices.5-[ADDRESS_787216] been implemented to improve prescription 
of VTE prophylaxis8-11 with the implicit assumption that m edications prescribed for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_596232].  
Deficits in Knowledge about Venous Thromboembolism  
In an attempt to improve venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis adherence we 
carried out qualitative studies to obtain patients' viewpoints on how nurses should be 
educated about VTE prevention and to assess nurses' beliefs and perceptions about 
pharmaco logic VTE prophylaxis. We observed deficiencies in nurses' knowledge and 
misconceptions about VTE prophylaxis that likely lowers adherence to administration of 
prescribed VTE prophylaxis doses.  
Rationale for Education Trial  
As a part of our original Patie nt-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) 
proposal, we planned to educate nurses to address the observed deficiencies and 
misconceptions and improve their ability to communicate effectively with patients . 
Historically, nurse education has been done v ia a linear, PowerPoint -based platform 
with voice -over but with no interactive component (Static). A newer platform for nurse 
education became available for use and includes scenario -based teaching, ongoing 
assessment, and immediate remediation. Most impor tantly, it is a highly interactive 
product (Dynamic).  
Study Objectives and Hypotheses  
The Objective of this study is to improve knowledge about the benefits and importance 
of VTE prophylaxis and harms associated with VTE with the goal of decreasing non -
administration of prescribed VTE prophylaxis.  
 Primary Hypothesis: Nurse participants  who receive either of these interventions will 
improve administration of prescribed VTE prophylaxis evidenced by a decrease in 
frequency of non -administered doses of VTE prophylaxis, compared with their 
frequency at baseline.  
 Secondary Hypothesis: Nurse p articipants who receive the Dynamic education format 
will have a larger decrease in frequency of missed doses of VTE prophylaxis compared 
with those who participate in the Static education format.  
2. Study Design  
A. Study Design  
a. Cluster randomized trial  
B. Study setting: Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Baltimore MD  
C. Eligibility Criteria  
a. All nurses  permanently assigned to one of the 21 included study floors  
D. Interventions  
a. Education A: An interactive dynamic learner -centric scenario -based  
education module with ongoing asses sment, and immediate remediation 
(Dynamic).  
b. Education B: A  linear  static  PowerPoint -based platform with voice -over but 
with no interactive component (Static).  
Participants will be assigned  one of two education modules based on their permanent 
floor assign ment.  T he same education type  will be assigned to all nurses on a single 
floor to mitigate issues related to contamination if nurses discuss the education with 
their colleagues . 
E. Enrollment  
a. Nurses will be identified using our centralized education directory that 
associates nurses with their designated departments and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_596233]. 
All nurses permanently assigned to one of the 21 included study floors will 
be included in this study.  Nurses who are not permanently associated with 
one of the 21 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_596233] (e.g. traveling nurse, float nurse) will be 
excluded from this study.  
F. Randomization  
a. Nurses will be identified using our centralized education directory that 
associates nurses with their designated departments and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_596233]. 
Nurses will be cluster randomized by [CONTACT_596237]. Because of known differences between 
medical and surgical floors in VTE prophylaxis administration practice  and 
culture, floors were stratified by [CONTACT_596238] (i.e. medicine and surgery) for 
randomization. Within strata, we will use a coin toss to randomize floors 
into study arms.  
G. Duration of Study  
a. Nurses will be given three months to complete the assigned educa tion 
module. Data will be collected for one full year to include medication 
administration practice at baseline, during the education trial, and after the 
education trial.  
 
H. Outcomes  
a. Primary Outcome measure: Proportion of non -administered doses of 
pharmacol ogical VTE prophylaxis (dose level)  
b. Secondary Outcome Measures:  
i. Nurse -reported relevance of and satisfaction with the education 
modules  
ii. Proportion of doses documented as missed due to patient refusal 
(dose level)  
iii. Proportion of patients with any VTE (patient level)  
1. VTE are defined by [CONTACT_596239] -12 diagnosis codes  
iv. Proportion of patients with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) (patient 
level)  
v. Proportion of patients with Pulmonary Embolism (PE) (patient level)  
 
Patient demographic data will be extracted from the Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_596234]. Pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis medication administration 
data will be extracted directly from electronic medication administration record in our 
computerized provider order entry system.  Immediately following completion of the 
assigned education module, nurses will be asked to complete a voluntary 5 -question 
survey to assess the relevance of and satisfaction with the education module.  
 
3. Analytic methods  
A. Baseline Characteristics  
a. Comparison of both arms to ensure  similarity at baseline  
b. Descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics i.e. simple counts and 
proportions by [CONTACT_159344]  
 
B. Multi -level mixed effects linear regression  
Due to the complexity of the multilevel structure of the data (i.e. multiple doses per 
patient across various hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], nurses and floors), multiple outputation19 will be 
used to reduce the levels of hierarchical structure to the floor level and nurse level by 
[CONTACT_596240]. By [CONTACT_596241] 1000 times, we 
will estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals condi tional on the floor 
and nurse.  
a. Primary analyses: Intent -to-Treat  
b. Secondary analyses  
i. Per protocol: Nurses who complete the education where the date of 
completion serves as an individual inflection point for pre -post 
education  
ii. Nurse -reported relevance of and  satisfaction with the education 
modules will be analyzed using a two -sided Chi -squared test

 3. SYNOPSIS  
Title:  A Multicenter, Open Label Crossover Study to Assess the 
Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Diazepam Buccal Soluble Film ( DBSF) 
in Pediatr ic Subjects with Epi[INVESTIGATOR_80289]:  The primary objective is to assess the pharmacokinetics of Diazepam 
Buccal Film ( DBF ) in pediatric subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (A) in the interictal 
state, and (B) in the ictal/peri -ictal state.  
 
(A) Subjects are considered to be in an interictal state if a n interval of at 
least 3 hours has elapsed since any clinical observable postictal signs 
or symptoms (from the last observed seizure) and the subject has 
been seizure free over this period. Subjects on  electroenc ephalogram 
(EEG ) monitoring can be considered to be in an interictal state if an 
interval of at least 3  hours has elapsed since any postictal electrical 
findings on EEG . 
(B) For the purposes of this study, the ictal state is defined as an ongoing 
clinically ob servable seizure or seizure activity as verified via EEG. 
The peri -ictal state is defined as the subject’s immediate postictal 
state following a generalized tonic -clonic (GTC) seizure or focal 
seizure with impaired awareness, and within  [ADDRESS_87688] 
clonic jerk. For subjects on EEG monitoring , the peri -ictal state may 
be defined as less than 5 minutes after cessation of seizure  activity  
(GTC or focal seizure with impaired awareness) as verified via EEG.  
Secondary objectives:  
• Evaluate the safety/tolerability of DBF  in pediatric subjects with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]  
• Evaluate the usability of DBF   
Experimental 
Design and Study 
Population:  Multicenter,  open -label crossover  study in pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_80290] 
(Treatment Period A) and during the ictal/peri -ictal state (Treatment 
Period B).  
 Male or female pediatric subjects with a clinical diagnosis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_80291] ( EMU) or a General Clinical 
Research Center (GCRC) or similar facility for evaluation of seizures. 
Subjects will be 2 to 1 6 years of age, inclusive, with a bod y weight of

 ≥6 kg and 111 kg . NOTE: Subjects with body weight in the range 112 
to 134 kg (247 to 295 pounds) may participate in the study at the 
discretion of the Investigator.  
Subjects aged 2 to 5 years will undergo Treatment B only and will not 
undergo Treatment A . Subjects aged 6 to 16 years will undergo both 
Treatment A and Treatment B.  
Number of 
Subjects:  To provide adequate pharmacokinetic, safety, and usability assessment of 
DBF  in the pediatric population, 16 to 18 subjects should complete the 
study, distributed across three age ranges as follows: 6 subjects aged 2 to 
5 years, 6 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 4 to 6 subjects aged 12 to 16 
years. To ensure an adequate number of  completed subjects  by [CONTACT_80343] , 
efforts will be made to enroll approximately 8 subjects in each range , for 
a total of 24 enrolled subjects.  
Enrollment End -
Date:  Enrollment end -date is 0 5 March 2020.  
Phase:  [ADDRESS_87689] Drugs:  Diazepam Buccal  Film 5 mg ( Aquestive Therapeutics ) 
Diazepam Buccal  Film 7.5 mg ( Aquestive Therapeutics ) 
Diazepam Buccal  Film 10 mg ( Aquestive Therapeutics ) 
Diazepam Buccal  Film 12.5 mg ( Aquestive Therapeutics ) 
Diazepam Buccal  Film 15 mg (Aquestive Therapeutics)  
Diazepam Buccal  Film  17.5 mg (Aquestive Therapeutics)  
Treatments:  In each of the two treatment period s, subject s will receive a single dose 
of DBF . DBF  is provided in a range of doses from 5 to 17.5 mg. The 
appropriate dose of DBF  will be assigned on the basis of age and weight 
using an interactive web response system (IWRS) during check -in for the 
subject’s first treatment period. The dose for the second treatment period 
will be the same as that for the first treatment period.  
Duration of 
Treatment Periods:  Each treatment period will last f rom admission to the EMU/GCRC until 4 
hours after DBF  administration.

 Study Duration:  • The minimum study duration will be approximately 30 days for 
subjects aged 6 to 16 years  (inclusive) *and 1 5 days for subjects aged 
2 to 5 years (inclusive) **, with a maximum of approximately 58 days, 
consisting of  Screening Period: 0 to 28 days prior to Day 1.  
* Age range 6 to 16 years (inclusive): beginning at the year 6 birthday 
until the year 17 birthday.  
**Age range 2 to 5 years (inclusive): beginning at the year 2 birthday 
until the year 6 birthday.  
• Treatment Period A (interictal , subjects aged 6 to 16 years ): 1 day 
(from admission to the EMU/GCRC until 4 hours after DBF  
administration).  
• Minimum washout period of 14 days between DBF  treatment periods  
• Treatment Period B * (ictal/peri -ictal, all subjects ): 1 day (from 
admission to the EMU/GCRC until 4 hours after DBF  administration) . 
* Period A and Period B may occur in either order, depending on 
seizure occurrence (i.e., if subject experiences a seizure during the 
first visit to the EMU or GCRC, the Investigator may regard that 
period as Treatment Period B).  
• Follow -up Visit: A follow -up visit will be scheduled to obtain safety 
data 14 days (±2 days) after the second treatment period.  
Dosing Time:  The treatment periods will begin  at a time of day consistent with usual 
EMU/GCRC protocol. In Treatment Period A, DBF  will be administered 
as soon as check -in procedures have been completed. In Treatment 
Period B, the subject will be monitored for seizure activity, and DBF  will 
be admini stered as soon as possible after detection of seizure activity, 
within [ADDRESS_87690] clonic jerk or within 5 minutes of cessation 
of the seizure as verified via EEG . 
Safety Monitoring 
and Endpoints:  Clinical seizure monitoring (both treatment periods) will start prior to 
DBF  treatment and will continue for 4 hours after dosing , or longer at the 
discretion of the EMU or GCRC Investigator. Continuous video EEG 
monitoring for seizure detection will be pe rformed as indicated by [CONTACT_80344]. Sites will maintain the EEG recordings with the study 
documents, but d ata from the EEG recordings will not be collected for 
the study dataset.  
The following safety assessments will be performed during the stud y:

 6. BACKGROUND AND PHARM ACOKINETICS  
Diazepam Buccal Film ( DBF ), formerly referred to as Diazepam Buccal Soluble Film 
(DBSF),  is being developed as an alternative dosage form to Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal 
gel, a gel formulation of diazepam. The proposed indication is identical to that of 
Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel: the treatment and management of selected, refractory 
patients wi th epi[INVESTIGATOR_80295] (AEDs) and who 
require intermittent use of diazepam to control bouts of increased seizure activity 
(Diastat ® AcuDial™ rectal gel prescribing information ). Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel 
has been marketed in the [LOCATION_002] since 1997 and currently is the only F ood and 
Drug Administration (F DA) approved drug in the US for this indication.  
6.1. Treatment a nd Management of Refractory Patients with 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_80296], including breakthrough seizures, repetitive seizures, and seizure 
clusters occur in a significant number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_80297].  These types of seizures have distinguishable characteristics 
that are usually recognized by [CONTACT_1962], caregivers, and physicians.  
Although patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_80298], these seizures can last from 
minutes to hours (Cereghino , 2007 ). When these seizures occur outside a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the 
patient is often transported to an acute care facility for treatment to prevent prolonged 
seizures (Lowenstein and Alldredge, 1998 ). If treatment is not prompt and effective there 
is a risk that seizure activity will continue, and may become life threatening, including 
the risk of status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (Bergen , 2006 ; Matheson et al, 2000 ; Sankar and Rho, 
2007 ).  
In these cases, the primary goals of the treatment are seizure cessation and prevention of 
seizure recurrence (Cereghino , 2007 ). Usually, acute benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_80299]. Nevertheless, 
many treatment options rely on appropriate intervention by [CONTACT_80348], and 
treatment may be delayed while the pa tient is transported to a medical facility (Glauser , 
2007 ).  
Outpatient treatment for these types of seizures may reduce emergency medical 
intervention, decrease seizure duration, prevent general deterioration due to the rep eated 
seizures and improve the quality of life of these patients. While rectal diazepam gel is 
currently available in the [LOCATION_002], a portion of the population does not benefit from

 this treatment , partly because the rectal route of administration is inappropriate or 
unacceptable (Fisgin  et al,  2002 ). Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for an 
effective treatment with a rapid onset of action that is easily administered in the 
outpatient setting.  
6.2. Diazepam  
Diaz epam is a long -acting “classical” benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_80300] γ-Aminobutyric acid type A ( GABA -A) receptor and demonstrates anticonvulsant 
properties. It is commonly used to treat a range of conditions including seizures, anxiety,  
alcohol withdrawal syndrome, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_80301], muscle spasms, 
trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and restless legs syndrome (Calcaterra  and Barrow,  2014 ). It can be 
taken by [CONTACT_1966], inserted into the rectum, injected into muscle, or injected intravenously. 
When given intravenously, effects begin in 1 to 5 minutes. When diazepam is taken 
orally, effects may be delayed as long as 40 minutes (Riss et al,  2008 ). 
Intravenous diazepam is a first -line treatment for status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (Riss et al,  2008 ). 
Diazepam rectal gel has been demonstrated superior to placebo gel in reducing the risk of 
contin uing seizures. Diazepam is rarely used for the long -term treatment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_80302] (Riss et al, 2008 ). However, diazepam is effective  when used intermittently for 
the prevention of repeated seizures. Like other benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], diazepam administration 
may cause sedation, anxiolysis, and amnesia (Riss et al, 2008 ). 
6.2.1.  Mechanism of Action  
Although the preci se mechanism by [CONTACT_80349] -seizure effects is 
unknown, animal and in vitro studies suggest that diazepam acts to suppress seizures 
through an interaction with γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors of the A -type 
(GABA A). GABA, the major i nhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, 
acts at this receptor to open the membrane channel allowing chloride ions to flow into 
neurons (Tan et al, 2011 ). Entry of chloride ions causes an inhibitory potenti al that 
reduces the ability of neurons to depolarize to the threshold potential necessary to 
produce action potentials. Excessive depolarization of neurons is implicated in the 
generation and spread of seizures. It is believed that diazepam enhances the ac tions of 
GABA by [CONTACT_80350] A receptor.

Page 24 
 6.2.2.  Metabolism and Elimination  
Diazepam is extensively metabolized to one major active metabolite 
(desmethyldiazepam) and two minor active metabolites, 3 -hydroxydiazepam 
(temazepam) and  3-hydroxy -N-diazepam (oxazepam) (Diastat ® AcuDial™ rectal gel 
prescribing information ). With steady state dosing, desmethyldiazepam is found in 
plasma at concentrations equivalent to those of diazepam while oxazepam and 
temazepam are not usually detectable. The metabolism of diaz epam is primarily hepatic 
and involves demethylation (involving primarily CYP2C19 and CYP3A4) and 
3-hydroxylation (involving primarily CYP3A4), followed by [CONTACT_12075]. The 
marked inter - individual variability in the clearance of diazepam reported in t he literature 
is probably attributable to variability of CYP2C19 (which is known to exhibit genetic 
polymorphism; about 3 -5% of Caucasians have little or no CYP2C19 activity and are 
“poor metabolizers”) and CYP3A4. No inhibition was demonstrated in the pre sence of 
inhibitors selective for CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP1A2, indicating 
that these enzymes are not significantly involved in metabolism of diazepam  
(Dean , 2016 ).  
6.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics  
Per the prescribing informatio n, rectal administration of a 15 mg dose of Diastat® 
AcuDial™ rectal gel produces peak plasma concentrations in 1.5 hours, with absolute 
bioavailability of 90% relative to Valium® injectable. The volume of distribution of 
diazepam rectal gel is calculated to be approximately 1 L/kg. The mean elimination half -
life of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam following administration of a 15 mg dose of 
diazepam rectal gel was found to be about 46 hours ( coefficient of variation  [CV] = 43%) 
and 71 hours (C oefficient of Variation [CV]  = 37%), respectively. Both diazepam and its 
major active metabolite desmethyldiazepam bind extensively to plasma proteins (95 -
98%).  
6.3. Diastat® AcuDial™ Rectal Gel in the Treatment of Seizures  
Although the Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel formulatio n is considered generally safe and 
effective, the route of administration is less than ideal. The mechanics of administering a 
rectal gel can be a difficult, time -consuming, and embarrassing experience for both 
patient and care -givers alike. For example, t he patient or care -giver must first remove 
articles of clothing and then place the patient in an appropriate position. The Diastat® 
AcuDial™ rectal gel syringe tip is inserted into the rectum to a specific depth and the gel 
expressed into the rectal vault.  However, improper technique can lead to patient injury 
[ADDRESS_87703] 
compliance to treatment (Tatum , 2002 ). Each of these factors has a potential influence on 
patient morbidity. Persistent seizure activity is associated with worse outcomes across a 
spectrum of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_80303] (Haut , 2006 ; Waterhouse  et al,  1999 ). Further, it has 
been demonstrated that if seizures are not terminated quickly, escalating doses of 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_80304] (Kapur and Macdonald, 1997 ). 
6.4. Diazepam Buccal Film  
The new route of diazepam administration is via buccal film. Aquestive Therapeutics  
initiated development of DBF , specifically intended for buccal delivery for patients who 
require control of intermittent bouts of seizure activity. DBF  contains the FDA  approved 
active ingredient diazepam, a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], as a treatment for the management of 
selected, refractory patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], on stable regimens of antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_80305]. The 
DBF  products, with a planned dose range of 5 mg to 15 mg, are expected to achieve peak 
plasma concentrations of diazepam equivalent to the reference therapy, Di astat® 
AcuDial™ rectal gel. The DBF  product is intended for submission as a 505(b)(2) NDA 
using Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel as the reference therapy.  
Buccal diazepam may be particularly well -suited for administration in outpatient settings. 
The DBF  is administered by [CONTACT_80351], where 
it adheres, dissolves, and releases the drug onto the buccal mucosa. Although buccal 
absorption is expected to be the primary route of absorption of the drug, some absorption 
throu gh the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may be possible due to swallowing of the saliva. It 
is expected that use of the buccal film will be similar to the use of Diastat® AcuDial™ 
rectal gel, i.e., the film would be administered during or immediately after a se izure with 
characteristics for which the Diastat rectal gel would be indicated, and the goal of 
treatment would be the same as that of the rectal gel —to reduce the overall frequency of 
acute repetitive seizures.  
There is no need to disrobe the patient  during administration . Additionally, there is less 
potential for delay in treatment, and greater patient and caregiver acceptance with 
improved compliance may be expected. For patients with bouts of increased seizure 
activity, the development of a DBF  will me et the treatment need for a form of diazepam 
that is effective, safe, allows reliable dose administration, and is easier to administer than 
[ADDRESS_87704] focused on assessing its bioavailability relative 
to the reference therapy, Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel , assessment of dose 
proportionality, and assessment of food effect . Overall safety and tolerability have been  
assessed in all clinical trials con ducted with DBF . The results of Phase 1 studies to date 
are summarized in this section.  
6.4.1.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4287] 1899 and 1900  
The two pi[INVESTIGATOR_80306], open label, single -dose, fasting condition, 
crossover studies in healthy male and female volunteers t o assess the bioavailability of 
DBF  in comparison to the same nominal dose of Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel. Study 
1899 compared DBF  5 mg to Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel 5 mg, with 11 subjects 
completing both treatments. Study 1900 compared DBF  20 mg to Dia stat® AcuDial™ 
rectal gel 20 mg, with 10 subjects completing both treatments.  
Study 1899 compared DBF  5 mg to Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel 5 mg. Among the 11 
subjects who completed both treatments, DBF  5 mg was bioequivalent to Diastat® 
AcuDial™ rectal ge l [ADDRESS_87705] sampling time t (AUC t) and AUC from time 0 
extrapolated to infinity ( AUC inf), i.e., the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of 
geometric means  was within the acceptable range of 80 -125%. For the observed peak 
drug concentration ( Cmax), the ratio of geometric means was 1.07 with the 90% CI 
87.1 131.5%. The median  observed time to reach maximum drug concentration ( Tmax) 
was 0.67 hours for the DBF  (range 0.33 -1.50 hours) and 0.25 hours for the Diastat® 
AcuDial™ rectal gel (range 0.15 -1.00 hours). The difference in T max values was not 
statistically significant.  
Study 1900 compared DBF  20 mg to Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel 20 mg. Evaluable 
data from 1 0 subjects who completed both treatments showed that the extent of the 
absorption of DBF  20 mg was comparable to Diastat® 20 mg rectal gel, with the ratio of 
geometric means for AUC t and AUC inf within the acceptable range of 80 -125%. For C max, 
the ratio of  geometric means was 158.72% with 90% CI 122.81 -205.14. The median T max 
was 1.25 hours for the DBF  (range 0.36 -2.05 hours) and 1.00 hours for the Diastat® 
AcuDial™ rectal gel (range 0.25 -2.00 hours). The difference in T max values was not 
statistically significant. Examination of the mean plasma curves for DSBF and Diastat® 
showed that although the C max was higher for the DSBF relative to Diastat®, the

 pharm acokinetics were comparable in terms of rapid rate of absorption, duration of 
plateau, and the rate of elimination.  
Figure 1 shows the C max values for DBF vs. Diastat® at nominal doses of [ADDRESS_87706] ed that DBF  5 mg was nearly 
bioequivalent to Diastat® [ADDRESS_87707], because the C max after administration of 
Diastat® 20 mg is lower than the C max after DBF  20 mg, DBF  20 mg is not bioequivalent 
to Diastat® [ADDRESS_87708] ed that for DBF , 
both C max and AUC are dose -proportional over the 5 mg to 20 mg dose range, whereas, 
for Diastat®, although AUC is dose -proportional (data not shown) , Cmax is less than dose -
proportional. In light of this observation, at doses above 5 mg, the nominal dose of 
diazepa m administered as DBF  was expected to be lower than the therapeutically 
equivalent nominal dose of Diastat®.

 Data are C max values (geometric means) from  pi[INVESTIGATOR_4287] 1899 (N=11) and Study 1900 (N=10). As 
shown in the figure, C max values for DBF  were approximately dose -proportional while C max values for 
Diastat® were less than dose -proportional. (AUC (0-t) and AUC (0-inf) were approximately dose -proportional 
for both DBF  and Diastat® – data not shown.) Analysis of the individual data by [CONTACT_80353] C max values for DBF  were consistent with a direct linear relationship between 
Cmax and nominal dos e, while the observed C max values for Diastat® appeared to be linearly related to dose 
to the 2/3 power.

mg. A total of 30 subjects were randomized and dose d in the study.  Analysis of the 
pharmacokinetic data confirmed that DBF  is dose -proportional over the dose range 5 mg 
to 15 mg ( Table 1). The criteria for dose proportionality were met for diazepam since for 
both comparisons (A/B: DBF  5 mg/ DBF  10 mg and C/B: DBF  15 mg/ DBF  10 mg), the

absorption of DBF . The firs t peak (mean concentration curves) for both high fat and 
moderate fat meals is observe d at 45 minutes (mean of 199.04 ng/mL and 222.37 ng/mL, 
respectively) and the second peak of the mean concentration curves is observed at 3 hours 
(mean of 196.22 ng/mL and 261.79 ng/mL, respectively).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Study 162022  
Study 162022 was a single -dose, open -label, two -period, randomized two-sequence 
crossover  study with DBF  15 mg administered under fasted conditions  and within 30 
minutes following a high -fat meal . The washout period between doses was 28 days. The 
study was conducted with 18 healthy male and femal e subjects aged 18 to 62 years, 
inclusive.  AUC 0-t and AUC 0-inf were not affected by [CONTACT_8208]; however, C max after a high fat 
meal was approximately 55% of the fasting value, 90% CI 48.6% – 62.7%  (ratio of 
geometric means). Median T max fasting was approximately  0.75 hour with range of 
0.25 hour to 2 hours whereas median T max after a high fat meal was 3.0 hours with range 
0.5 hour to 6.0 hours, p = 0.0008.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Study 172018  
Study 172018 was a four -period, randomized four -sequence crossover study in 24 male 
and female adults with four treatments: (A) DBF  15 mg fasted, administered upright; 
(B) DBF  15 mg fasted, administered reclining; DBF  15 mg within 30 minutes following a 
standardized high -fat meal, administered reclining; and DBF  [ADDRESS_87713] reclining on his/her side (application site downward) for 15 minutes after 
application. This was based on aligning treatment administration with the typi[INVESTIGATOR_80308] a postictal state and the Sponsor’s interest in investigating 
whether position affected diazepam PK following administration of DBF .

 Analysis comprised pairwise comparisons of Treatment C (high -fat meal, reclining) and 
Treatment D (moderate -fat mea l, reclining) with Treatment B (fasting, reclining) as well 
as a comparison between Treatment B (fasting, reclining) with Treatment A (fasting, 
upright).  
Overall, AUC 0-t and AUC 0-inf were not affected by [CONTACT_80354]. C max after the 
high fat mea l (reclining) was approximately 53% of the fasting value (reclining), 
90% CI: 41.1% - 59.5% (ratio of geometric means). C max after the moderate fat meal 
(reclining) was approximately 67% of the fasting value (reclining), 90% CI 59.8% -74.6% 
(ratio of geomet ric means). Comparison of Treatment B with Treatment A demonstrated 
that position in the fasting condition (reclining versus upright) had no meaningful effect 
on either C max or AUC. Diazepam profiles (reclining versus upright) met bioequivalence 
criteria f or the upright and fasting condition. There was no difference in T max, p = 0.4979.  
Median T max fasting, upright was 1.00 hour with range 0.28 hour to 2.03 hours. Median 
Tmax fasting, reclining was 0.80 hour with range 0.50 hour to 2.03 hours whereas median  
Tmax after a high fat meal, reclining was 2.01 hours with range 0.50 hour to 4.06 hours 
(p = 0.0147 versus fasting, reclining). and median Tmax  after a moderate fat meal, 
reclining was 3.00 hours with range 0.50 hour to 4.02 hours (p = 0.[ADDRESS_87714] ing, 
reclining).  
6.5. Rationale for the Dose Regimen  of Diazepam Buccal Film  
As described above, the data from Study 162013 and Study 162021 demonstrate that 
DBF  is dose -proportional over the studied dose -range, while Diastat® is less than dose -
proportional with respect to C max. Also, as described above , the data from Study 162022 
and Study 172018 demonstrate that food taken within 30 minutes prior to dosing affects 
the rate (but not the extent) of absorption of diazepam admini stered as DBF . 
Accordingly, Aquestive used population PK modeling to select a dosing regimen to 
compensate for the differences in PK between DBF  and Diastat®.  
Using data from Study 162013, Study 162021, and Study 172018, population PK 
modeling was used to  model the PK profiles for DBF  and Diastat® under fasted and fed 
conditions ( DBF ). In brief, the recommended DBF  dose for each weight class as defined 
in the Diastat® label was selected (1) to provide a dose sufficiently high to ensure that 
the predicted m edian of the resulting diazepam C max following a moderate fat meal was 
similar to the median C max following the labeled dose of Diastat® , and (2) to provide a 
dose for which the predicted median of the resulting diazepam C max under fasting 
conditions woul d not exceed the median C max values observed and demonstrated as safe 
in Phase 1 studies with DBF . It was demonstrated that the predicted median diazepam

 Cmax values with the proposed regimen administered under fasting conditions did not 
meaningfully excee d the median C max values observed in the 115 healthy volunteers 
(adult men and women) who received DBF  15 or 20 mg under fasting conditions in Phase 
1 studies conducted Aquestive. The median C max among these 115 healthy subjects (138 
DBF  administrations) w as 486 ng/mL. Under conditions of a moderate fat meal, t he 
proposed DBF  dosing regimen produces a C max similar to the C max expected following the 
labeled dose of Diastat®.  
For the current pediatric study, the DBF  dose will be determined according to age an d 
weight category in a manner analogous to the Diastat® label (Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal 
gel prescribing information December 2016)  (Table 3). The proposed dosing regimen is 
predicted to produce a C max under fasting conditions that is approximately 150% of the 
Cmax expected following the labeled dose of Diastat®.

 6.6. Safety  
It is anticipated that the adverse event ( AE) profile from systemic exposure observed with 
DBF  will resemble the already well -known profile for diazepam in general and the 
reference therapy, Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel, in particular.  
6.6.1.  Diastat® AcuDial™ Rectal Gel  
Diazepam rectal gel was administere d to 573 patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_80309]® 
clinical trials, only some of which were placebo -controlled  (Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal 
gel prescribing information December 2016 ). The controlled trials of Diast at® AcuDial™ 
rectal gel included children [ADDRESS_87715] frequent 
AE reported with diazepam rectal gel in the two double -blind, placebo -controlled studies 
was somnolence (23%). Less frequent AE were headache (≤5%), diarrhea (≤4%), ataxia 
(≤3%), dizziness (≤3%), euphoria (≤3%), incoordinat ion (≤3%), rash (≤3%), 
vasodilatation (≤2%), and asthma (≤2%).  
Table 4 below lists treatment -emergent adverse events  (TEAEs) that occurred in >1% of 
patients enrolled in parallel -group, placebo -controlled trials and that were numerically 
more common in the diazepam rectal gel group.

 7. STUDY OBJECTIVE S  
The primary objective is to assess the pharmacokinetics of DBF in pediatric subjects with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_58824] (A) the interictal state and (B)  the ictal/peri -ictal state.  
(A) Subjects are considered to be in an interictal state if an interval of at least 3 hours 
has elapsed since any clinical observable postictal signs or sym ptoms (from the 
last observed seizure) and the subject has been seizure free over this period. 
Subjects on electroencephalogram (EEG)  monitoring can be considered to be in 
an interictal state if an interval of at least [ADDRESS_87719] al 
electrical findings on EEG.  
(B) For the purposes of this study, the ictal state is defined as an ongoing clinically 
observable seizure or seizure activity as verified via EEG. The peri -ictal state is 
defined clinically as the subject’s immediate postictal s tate following a 
generalized tonic -clonic (GTC) seizure or focal seizure with impaired awareness , 
and within [ADDRESS_87720] clonic jerk . For subjects on EEG 
monitoring, the peri -ictal state may be defined as less than 5 minutes after 
cessation of seizure activity as verified via EEG.  
Secondary objectives:  
• Evaluate the safety/tolerability of DBF  in pediatric subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]  
• Evaluate the usability of DBF   
Data from this study are intended to support a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application for the 
test product.

 8. STUDY DESIGN  
8.1. Discussion of Study Design  
8.1.1.  Study Design  
This study uses a multicenter, open -label, crossover design with the fo llowing periods: 
Screening  Visit , Treatment Period A (interictal DBF  dosing and pharmacokinetic 
evaluation , subjects aged 6-16 years ), minimum washout period of 14 days  between DBF  
treatment periods , Treatment Period B (ictal/peri -ictal DBF  dosing and phar macokinetic 
evaluation , all subjects ), and Follow -up 14 (±2) days after treatment . Definitions of the 
interictal and ictal/peri -ictal states are given in  Section  7. If the subject must remain in the 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_80315] (EMU) or General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) for 
medical reasons after the end of Treatment Period A or B, this time will be designated as 
Post-treatment . The treatment periods may occur in either order depending on occurrence 
of seizures .  
Male or female pediatric subjects (age 2 -16 years) who are scheduled to enter the EMU 
or GCRC for evaluation and treatment of their epi[INVESTIGATOR_80316].  Subjects aged 2 to 5 years will 
undergo Treatment B only. Subjects aged 6 to 16 years will undergo both Treatment A 
and Treatment B.  
8.1.2.  Screening Period  
The Screening Period  (Section  9.1) will occur [ADDRESS_87721]’s legally authorized representative must provide written 
informed consent  prior to t he initiation of any screening procedures , and subjects must 
provide oral and/or written assent as required by [CONTACT_4707] ( IRB). 
During the Screening Period , the subject will be evaluated for study participation as 
described in Section  9.1 and Section  9.2.  
8.1.3.  Treatment Periods  
The treatment periods (Section  11.2) will begin  at a time of day cons istent with usual 
EMU/GCRC protocol. Subjects will arrive at the EMU, GCRC, or similar facility  on their 
scheduled day and time. Subjects are to continue taking their regular AEDs  prior to and 
throughout each Treatment Period  (in accordance with EMU or GCRC protocol ).

 Check -in Procedures:  Subjects will undergo standard admission procedures, including 
the placement of an indwelling cannula for intravenous access, assessment of medical 
history, medications, vital signs  (oxygen saturation [SaO 2) via pulse oximetry, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862] [RR], heart rate [HR], blood pressure [BP], temperature) , 12-lead electrocardiogram  
(ECG ), and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating scale ( C-SSRS) as age -appropriate. At 
the Investigator’s discretion, urine drug tests and a breath alcohol test will be performed 
on all subjects. Urine pregnancy tests will also be performed for women of childbearing  
potential.  
The Investigator or medical staff will review results from the Screening Period and, if 
applicab le, results from the previous treatment period, including vital signs ( SaO 2 via 
pulse oximetry , RR, HR, BP, temperature), [ADDRESS_87722]’s informed consent  and/or assent as applicable , medical history, 
medicati ons, use of restricted substances, and results from the current visit assessments 
will be reviewed for eligibility and safety. If this is a first treatment visit, subjects who do 
not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will not be enrolled. Subjects who meet 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled.  
• Enrollment end -date is [ADDRESS_87723] completed a previous treatment visit no longer meet 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, they will be discontinued from the study .  
A study drug kit will be assigned by [CONTACT_80356] (IWRS). 
Appropriately delegated clinical staff at each clinical site will use the IWRS to assign a 
kit of the appropriate dose (from the available 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5 , 15, and 17.5  mg DBF  
doses) based on the subject’s weight and age.  
Clinical monitoring will be initiated. Continuous video EEG monitoring for seizure 
detection will also be initiated as indicated by [CONTACT_80357], but  data from the EEG 
recordings will not be collected for the study dataset.  
Treatment Period A  (Subjects aged 6-16 years ): Subjects will enter Treatment Period 
A as scheduled if at least a 3 -hour interval has elapsed since any clinical postictal signs or 
symptoms (from the last observed sei zure) have been observed and the subject has been 
seizure free over this period. If clinical assessment ( and EEG monitoring , if applicable)  
show no seizure activity, the subject will receive a single dose of [ADDRESS_87724]’s weight and age ( Table 9) (see 
placement diagram in Appendix A ). Safety and PK assessments will be performed as

 described below. Clinical monitoring will continue until the end of the treatment period 
(4 hours), and video EEG monitoring will continue as speci fied by [CONTACT_80358].  
If the subject experiences a seizure before dosing during Treatment Period A, and if it has 
been determined that the subject meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the 
Investigator may regard this visit as Treatment Peri od B, and Treatment A will be 
rescheduled. If no seizure occurs and Treatment Period A is completed, the subject will 
be scheduled for Treatment Period B.  
Treatment Period B  (All Subjects) : Monitoring for the occurrence of seizures as per 
EMU or GCRC proto col will continue until the subject experiences a qualifying (GTC 
seizure or focal seizure with impaired awareness). If the subject’s AEDs are to be tapered 
(e.g., if per EMU or GCRC protocol ), the Investigator will determine and record the time 
to begin t apering the AEDs, including the doses administered or prescribed, percent dose 
reduction , and tapering rate.  
Seizure management and the required intervention will be determined by [CONTACT_737]. 
Subjects with a GTC seizure or focal seizure with impaire d awareness who are 
determined to be medically appropriate to receive study drug ( DBF ) will receive a single 
dose of [ADDRESS_87725]’s weight 
and age ( Table 9)  
• during the seizure, OR  
• within [ADDRESS_87726] clonic jerk, AND/OR  
• within [ADDRESS_87727]’s seizure persists after the single dose of DBF , an alternative anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58777] (AED)  (rescue medication) may be administered as medically required according to 
the st andard -of-care EMU or GCRC treatment protocol . Any alternative AED 
medications will be recorded in the study CRF. The physician in charge will be 
encouraged but not required to use intravenous lorazepam for rescue in preference to 
intravenous diazepam. The  Investigator  is permitted  to discontinue the subject from the 
study protocol at any time throughout the study protocol. At the end of the treatment 
period, clinical seizure assessment, AEDs and concomitant medication s, and AEs will be 
reviewed. If AEDs we re tapered previously, the Investigator will determine and record 
the time to restart the subject’s AED medications, including the doses administered or 
prescribed and the schedule for percent dose increase.  
[ADDRESS_87728] will be discharged when medically stable.  
8.1.5.  Follow -up Visit  
Safety data ( including concomitant medication s, vital signs  including SaO [ADDRESS_87729] in females of 
childbearing potential , AEs, physical and neurological examinations, C -SSRS, and 
inspection of oral mucosa) will be obtained at a follow -up visit in an outpatient setting (to 
be determined by [CONTACT_80359]) at 14 ± [ADDRESS_87730] treatment period (A or 
B). 
8.1.6.  Pharmacokinetic and Safety Assessments  
The following assessments will be performed (see Section  11.4 for details):  
Diazepam PK  (Section  11.4.1 ). In the two pi[INVESTIGATOR_80317] , the m edian T max 
for DBF  was 0.67 hours (range 0.33 -1.50 hours) in Study 1899 and 1.5 hours (range 0.36 -
2.05 hours) in Study 1900. Therefore, in both treatment periods in the present study, 
plasma samples for diazepam and the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam PK will be 
obtained before DBF  administration and post dose a t the following time points (±5 
minutes): 0.25 hours (15 minutes), 0.5 hours (30 minutes), 1 hour (60 minutes), 1.5 hours 
(90 minutes), 2 hours (120 minutes), and 4 hours (240 minutes). Collection of plasma 
samples will continue regardless of whether anoth er AED is administered for rescue.  
Vital Signs.  The subject’s SaO 2, BP, HR, RR, and temperature will be recorded at 
Screening , at check -in predose, during the treatment visits and post dose , and at Follow -
up as described in Section  11.6. 
Oral Mucosal Inspection.  As described in Section  11.9, to check for any mucosal 
irritation, a n illumination -assisted visual inspection of the DBF  application site will be 
performed at Screening; at each treatment visit prior to study drug administration and 
approximately 0.25 hours (15 minutes), 0.5 hour s (30 min utes), and 1  hour (60 minutes) 
after application of the film (±5 minutes for all time points); and at Follow -up.

 Usability.  The usability of DBF  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_80360], 
retention, and placement after each administration durin g the treatment periods  as 
described in Section  11.10 .  
Laboratory Safety.  Blood samples will be collected for laboratory safety  at Screening 
and at Follow -up or upon early termination (Section  11.4.2 ).  
ECG. A 12 -lead ECG will be obtained at Screening and at each treatment period, both 
predose and 4 hours after dosing  (Section  11.7). 
8.2. Study Duration and Washout  
The study includes the Screening Period 0-28 days before Day  1; Treatment Period A 
(interictal , for subjects aged 6 to 16 years (inclusive ) 1 day; a minimum washout period 
of 14 days  between DBF  treatment periods ; Treatment Period B (ictal/peri -ictal, for all 
subjects ) 1 day; and Follow -up 14 days (±2 days) after the second treatment period. Thus, 
the minimum study duration will be approximately 30 days for subjects aged 6 to 16 
years (inclusive) and 15 days for subjects aged 2 to 5 years (inclusive) . The maximum 
study  duration (including screening) will be approximately 58 days  for subjects aged 6 to 
16 years and 43 days for subjects aged 2 to 5 years . 
8.3. Randomization and Blinding  
This is an open -label  study. Neither subjects nor clinic staff will be blinded.  The 
treatme nt order (order of Treatment Period A and Treatment Period B) will not be 
randomized.

development of the DBF  and other film products produced by [CONTACT_80369]  
(ZUPLENZ® 4 and 8 mg and SUBOXONE® 2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1 mg, 8 mg/2 mg, and 12  
mg/3mg Sublingual Films).  The DBF  produ ct is a green rectangular film.  
The primary package used for DBF  is a polyester/foil laminate provided by [CONTACT_80370] (Madison, WI). The material (product code RFE -013) is a multi -layer 
composite consisting of (1) a 12.2 -micron layer of polyethylene p hthalate, (2) a 
25.4-micron layer of low -density polyethylene, (3) an 8.9 -micron layer of aluminum foil, 
and (4) a 38.1 -micron layer of low -density polyethylene,  and is heat sealed at the edges . 
Each pouch contains one DBF . 
10.2. Labeling, Maintenance, and Retention of Study Drugs  
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to ensure that all drug supplies provided for the 
study are manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices and are suitable for 
human use. The Sponsor will supply an  authorized clinical supplies vendor with a 
sufficient quantity of the study formulation(s) to allow completion of this study, 
including some spares for replacement drugs. The clinical supply vendor will ship the 
packaged and labeled study drugs for each p articipating investigator to the Pharmacy or 
Investigator at the address specified on the DEA Controlled Substance certificate.  
The study drugs will be sent to the Site Pharmacy already packed in individual unit -dose 
packages. Each unit -dose package will be labeled in English containing at a minimum the 
Protocol Number, Drug Name, Strength , Kit Identification Number, Route of 
Administration, and a statement “For clinical trial use only.”  
Upon receipt of the study drugs, the Investigator, Pharmacist, or des ignee will inspect the 
shipment to ensure study drugs are received in good condition. Study drug receipt and 
condition will be promptly registered in the IWRS. The Investigator, Pharmacist, or

Page 57 
 g. Physical/neurological examination will be performed at Screening and at Foll ow-up or at an early 
discontinuation visit . 
h. A [ADDRESS_87749] will be performed for females of childbearing potential at Screening; a 
urine pregnancy test will be performed at each treatment period Check -in and at Follow -up. 
j. Screening : Receiving  any dosage form of diazepam  or other benzodiazepi [INVESTIGATOR_80328] 2 weeks 
before screening is not a reason to postpone  screening .  
Treatment periods : If the subject or parent(s) or legal ly authorized representative reports that the 
subject received any dosage form of diazepam (all other benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_80329]) within [ADDRESS_87750] or parent(s) or legal ly authorized representative reports that the subject has taken no 
diazepam  in the previous [ADDRESS_87751]’s drug history and evaluate whether the drug history is 
consistent with the positive urine result. Considering both the drug history and the urine test 
positive for benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], the Investigator may choose to reschedule the clinical admission, b ut 
the protocol does not require the Investigator to reschedule . Subjects who test positive for THC at 
screening may participate if the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_80330] a 
medical marijuana product is part of the subject’s  treatment plan as recommended by a physician 
for treatment of a medical condition.  In such case, the medical marijuana product will be recorded 
as a concomitant medication.  
k. The Investigator will make an illumination -assisted visual inspection of the oral mucosa during 
Screening and during each treatment period prior to study drug administration and at 
approximately 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes after  film placement . A further inspection 
of oral mucosa will be made at Follow -up. 
l. If indicated by [CONTACT_80372], continuous video EEG monitoring for seizure detection 
will be performed throughout each treatment period (4 hours). Sites will maintain the EEG 
recordings with the study documents, but data from the EEG recordings will not be collected f or 
the study dataset.  
m. For both treatment periods, p lasma samples for determination of diazepam and 
desmethyldiazepam PK  samples  are to be obtained at predose and post dose at the following time 
points ( ±5 minutes): 0.25 hours (15 minutes), 0.5 hours (30 minutes), 1 hour (60 minutes), 1.5 
hours (90 minutes), 2 hours (120 minutes), and 4 hours (240 minutes) after dosing. Collection of 
plasma samples will continue even if the administration of another AED is  needed for rescue.  
n. The study staff will evaluate the insertion process to determine usability of the film as described in 
Section  11.[ADDRESS_87752] admission procedures as 
described below, including the placement of an indwelling cannula for  intravenous 
access, assessment of medical history, medications, date/time of the subject’s last meal 
before the DBF  dose, vital signs, urine pregnancy  test in females of childbearing 
potential,  urine drug screen, breath alcohol test , 12-lead ECG, and the Columbia Suicide 
Severity Rating scale (C -SSRS), as age appropriate.  
Subjects and their parent(s) or legally authorized representatives will be questioned about 
whether they have complied with the study restrictions. If a restricted drug or non -drug 
therapy specified in the protocol was used, a decision to continue or discontinue the 
subject’s participation will be made by [CONTACT_80373]/or by [CONTACT_1034].   
If the subject or subjects’ parent (s) or legally authorized representative reports that the 
subject received any dosage form of diazepam  (all other benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_80329])  
within the [ADDRESS_87753] , parent(s) or legal 
representative reports that the subject has taken no diazepam and the urine test is positive 
for benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], then the Investiga tor may choose to postpone the clinic admission 
after considering both the subject’s drug history and the urine test positive for 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] . 
At each period check -in, the Investigator will review results from the Screening Period 
and, if applicable, r esults from the previous treatment period, including vital signs ( SaO 2, 
BP, HR, RR, temperature), [ADDRESS_87754] 
completed a previous treatment visit no longer meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, they 
will be discontinued from the study.  
A study drug kit will be a ssigned by [CONTACT_80356] (IWRS). 
Appropriately delegated clinical staff at each clinical site will use the IWRS to assign a 
kit of the appropriate dose (from the available 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5 , 15, and 17.5  mg DBF  
doses) based on the subj ect’s weight and age.

 Clinical monitoring will be initiated. Continuous video EEG monitoring for seizure 
detection will be initiated as indicated by [CONTACT_80374]. Sites will maintain 
the EEG recordings with the study documents, but d ata from the E EG recordings will not 
be collected for the study dataset.  
11.2.2.  Treatment Period A  (Subjects Age 6 -16 Years)  
Subjects will enter Treatment Period A as scheduled if at least a 3 -hour interval has 
elapsed since any clinical postictal signs or symptoms (from the last observed seizure) 
have been observed and the subject has been seizure free over this period. If clinical 
and/or EEG monitoring show no seizure activity, the subject will receive a single dose of 
DBF  as assigned by [CONTACT_8784] (see placement diagram in  Appendix A ). Safety and PK 
assessments will be performed as described below. Clinical monitoring will continue 
until the end of the treatment period (4 hours pos t dose), and video EEG monitoring will 
continue as specified by [CONTACT_80374].  
If the subject experiences a seizure before dosing during Treatment Period A, and if 
feasible after IWRS registration, dose determination, and review of inclusion/exclus ion 
criteria, the Investigator may regard this visit as Treatment Period B, and Treatment A 
will be rescheduled. If no seizure occurs and Treatment Period A is completed, the 
subject will be scheduled for Treatment Period B.   
11.2.3.  Treatment Period B  (All Subjec ts)  
During Treatment Period B, the subject will be monitored until a GTC or focal seizure 
with impaired awareness is detected or the Investigator terminates the monitoring period. 
If the subject’s AEDs are to be tapered as per EMU or GCRC protocol, and th e 
Investigator will determine and record the time to begin tapering the AEDs, including the 
percent dose reduction and tapering rate.  
Seizure management and the required intervention will be determined by [CONTACT_737]. 
Subjects with a GTC seizure or f ocal seizure with impaired awareness who are 
determined to be medically appropriate to receive study drug ( DBF ) will receive a single -
dose of DBF  (dose level determined via the IWRS) during the seizure or within [ADDRESS_87755]’s seizure persists after the single dose of DBF , an alternative AED 
medication (rescue medication) can be administered as medically required and according 
to the standard -of-care EMU or GCRC treatment protocol and recorded in the study CRF. 
[ADDRESS_87756] from the study protocol at any time throughout the study.  
11.2.4.  Dosing  
DBF  is provided in a range of doses from 5 to 1 7.5 mg to facilitate optimal dosing  (see 
Section 6.5). The recommended dose of DBF  is dependent on the subject’s age and 
weight. The Investigator or attending EMU or GCRC medical staff will use the IWRS 
(based on Table 9) to choose ap propriate doses for pediatric subjects.

[ADDRESS_87757] of the following steps:  
• When opening the foil pouch containing the study drug, staff are to use scissors to 
carefully cut along the wide edge of the pouch and use gloves when handling and 
administering the study drug to the subject.  
• Subjects will be instructed to swallow saliva and then open their mouth.  
• If the predose oral safety assessment reveals evidence of mucosal injury or 
irritation (e.g., a cheek bite resulting from a seizure), care should be taken to 
avoid placement of DBF  in that area.  
• Staff will place the film on the tip of a finger and then use the finger to insert the 
film into the subject’s mouth.  
• The film is to be centered against the inner aspect of the right or left cheek, so that 
it adheres to the buccal mucosa (refer to Appendix A  for a diagram of film 
placement).  The film may be placed without regard to the location of the parotid 
duct.  
• Subjects should be placed in a comfortable position.  
• The subject will be instructed t o close his/her mouth in a natural way, without 
swallowing, chewing, biting, or breaking the DBF . 
• Staff will observe the patient during this [ADDRESS_87758] spi[INVESTIGATOR_80331], 
Staff should try to reinsert the film, if possible. No second film should be applied.  
• Dosing time will b e set to the time the film is placed on the buccal mucosa. At [ADDRESS_87759]’s hands will be inspected to check whether the 
subject had removed the film (or  a part of the film) from the mouth.  
• The study staff will evaluate the insertion process to determine usability of the 
film as described in  Section  11.[ADDRESS_87760] will be discharged when medically stable.  
11.3. Follow -up  
Safety data including concomitant medication, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests 
(hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis , including urine pregnancy test , as described in 
Section  11.4.2 ), AEs, physical and neurolo gical examinations, C -SSRS, inspection of oral 
mucosa) , and review of personal seizure diary records will be obtained at a follow -up visit 
in an outpatient setting (to be determined by [CONTACT_80375]) at 14 ± [ADDRESS_87761] treatment period ( A or B), or after withdrawal/  discontinuation of a subject from the 
study (where possible ). 
11.4. Blood Sampling Schedule, Sample Collection, Processing, and 
Storage  
Blood will be obtained by [CONTACT_80376], or via an indwelling cannula. 
Subjects  may use up to a total of [ADDRESS_87762] 
indwelling cannula may only be used upon authorization by [CONTACT_80377]. If the cannula fails to work (i.e., it becomes clogged), the remaining samples 
will be taken by [CONTACT_37277].  
Blood sample collection times will be recorded on the appropriate source documents and 
reported for each subject.  
11.4.1.  Pharmacokinetic  Assessments  
During both treatment periods, plasma samples for determination of diazepam and the 
active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam PK will be obtained at predose (0 hours), and at 
the following time points ( ±5 minutes): 0.25 hours (15 minutes), 0.5 hours (30 minutes), 
1 hour (60 minutes), 1.5 hours (90 minutes), 2 hours (120 minute s), and 4 hours (240 
minutes) after dosing. Collection of plasma samples will continue even if the 
administration of another AED is needed for rescue.

 Subjects wi th Type 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific 
plan) or Type 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) suicidal ideation 
are exclusionary for enrollment and, if found during the study , the subject will be 
discontinued from the study and referred to a mental health professional.  
11.6. Vital Signs  
The subject’s vital signs ( oxygen saturation [SaO 2] measured via pulse oximetry, BP, 
HR, RR, and temperature) will be recorded at Screening and during both treatment 
period s, and at the Follow -up Visit.  
Vital signs (BP, HR, RR, and temperature) will be recorded at Screening and (Treatment 
Periods A and B) prior to DBF  administration. BP, HR, and RR will be recorded post 
dose at 0.25 hours (15 minutes), 0.5 hours (30 minutes ), 1 hour (60 minutes), 1.5 hours 
(90 minutes), 2 hours (120 minutes), 3 hours (180 minutes), and 4 hours (240 minutes)  
and at the follow -up visit . The subject’s position may be seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_80327].  
SaO 2 measured via pulse oximetry, will be recorded Screening and (Treatment Periods A 
and B) prior to DBF  administration and at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, [ADDRESS_87768] dose and 
thereafter at each time vital signs are recorded: 1 hour (60 minutes), 1.5 hours (90 
minutes), 2 hours (120 minutes), 3 hours (180 minutes), and 4 hours (240 minutes)  and at 
the follow -up visit . 
For subjects with pre - or post -dose vital signs outside of the acceptable range for systolic 
blood pressure ( 90-140 mmHg, inclusive), diastolic blood pressure ( 50-90 mmH g, 
inclusive), or heart rate (50-100 bpm, inclusive), the measurement will be repeated up to 
two times (at rest, after 5 minutes in a sitting position). If vital signs are still outside of 
the acceptable range, the Investigator will determine the appropria te course of action.  
Methods for the administration of oxygen should be readily available for saturation 
droppi[INVESTIGATOR_61217] 90%. The Investigator will determine management of hypoxemia until 
recovery.  
Additional measurements of vital signs will be made if dee med necessary by [CONTACT_3786]. Should a timing conflict arise, blood draws will take precedence over vital 
sign measurements and other scheduled activities, unless deemed otherwise by [CONTACT_3786].

 11.7. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be ob tained at Screening and at the beginning and end of each 
treatment period.  
11.8. Physical/Neurological Examination  
A physical and neurological examination will be performed at Screening and at Follow -
up or prior to early termination . 
11.9. Oral Safety Assessments  
The Investigator will make an illumination -assisted visual inspection of the oral mucosa, 
including the DBF  application site, at the following times:  
• At Screening;  
• During Treatment Periods A and B prior to dosing and at approximately 0.25 
hours (15 minutes), 0.5 hours (30 minutes), and 1 hour (60 minutes) after 
application of the film (±5  minutes for all time points); and  
• At Follow -up.  
Mucosal irritation and any in juries to the oral cavity (e.g., tongue or mucosa laceration, 
broken tooth, bleeding) will be recorded using criteria specified in a checklist in the CRF. 
Any de novo post dose mucosal irritation or other abnormalities will be reported as AEs 
and followed as described in Section  12.1.3 . 
11.10.  Usability  
To assess usability of DBF , oral cavity insertion, retention, and placement will also be 
evaluated for each administration. The following usability endpoints will be reported:  
• Whether successful placement was achieved (Placement is judged to be successful 
when the film adheres to the center of the buccal mucosa of either the right or the 
left cheek, as shown in Appendix A ). 
• Location of film placement (right or left)  
• Time of successful film placement.  
• Number of attempts needed to successfully insert the  film (An attempt is defined 
as inserting the finger with the film into the subject’s mouth.)

 • Whether any remnant of the film remained 15 minutes after placement.  
(If yes, the subject should be instructed to swallow the remaining film and 15 
minutes will be the time of complete film disintegration/dissolution that is 
reported in the CRF.)  
• Whether the subject spit or blew the film out of their mouth. If yes, whether an 
attempt was made to reinsert it.  
• Whether any saliva exited the subject’s mouth. If yes, t ime of exit and estimated 
total amount (in mL).  
• Whether a check of the subject’s hands at 15 minutes after film placement 
revealed that the film (or a part of the film) was removed by [CONTACT_1130].  
Where applicable, categorical explanations of the circumstanc es will be given (e.g., 
uncooperative or confused patient in a peri -ictal state).  
11.11.  Food and Fluid Intake  
The date/time of the patient’s last meal before DBF  dose (both treatment periods) will be 
recorded. Food and water intake will be restricted for [ADDRESS_87769] operating procedures (SOPs) in 
conformity with regulatory requirements to ensure the timely, accurate, and complete 
reporting of safety information.  
12.1. Adverse Event Recording and Follow -up 
Subjects will be instructed to inform clinic personnel of any u ntoward medical symptoms 
and/or events that may arise during the course of the study.   
At the treatment and follow -up visits, subjects will be questioned concerning symptoms 
that may have occurred after administration of the study drug. The incidence, seri ousness, 
severity, duration , and relationship to study drug of all AEs will be recorded.  
12.1.1.  Seizures  
Subjects should record all seizures from the time of consent through the Follow -up Visit 
in their personal seizure diary records, and/or in seizure diaries dispensed at Screening  
and verified prior to Treatment Period A or Trea tment Period B and at the Fol low-up 
Visit . 
Seizures will be re ported as AEs using the AE  electronic Case Report Form  (eCRF ) 
pages if they occur during the period from clinic admission for Treatment A or Treatment 
B up to  [ADDRESS_87770]’s normal seizure activity .  
12.1.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as 
it occurred; this does not include an even t that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death)  
• Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions

Page 71 
 • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed 
to the study drug)  
An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] m ay be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Medical and 
scientific judgment should be  exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in such situations.  
If the subject has a planned or elective  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80334] a pre -existing condition, this 
will not result in a reportable SAE as defined in the criteria listed above.  
12.1.3.  Evaluation of Severity of AEs  
Severity of AEs will be evaluated as follows:  
Mild  Adverse event resulting in discomfort, but not sufficient t o cause 
interference in normal daily activities.  
Moderate  Adverse event resulting in discomfort that is sufficient to cause 
interference in daily activities.  
Severe  Adverse event resulting in discomfort causing an inability to carry out 
normal daily activities.  
12.1.4.  Assessing Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investi gator will assess the relationship of all AEs to the drug, using the following 
scale:  
[ADDRESS_87771] abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration which makes a caus al relationship 
improbable, and which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanation.  
Unrelated  This category is applicable to AEs which are judged to be clearly and 
incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (diseases, environm ent, etc.) 
and do not meet the criteria for drug relationship listed for the above -
mentioned conditions.  
 
All AEs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_737], who must approve the subject for 
subsequent dosing.  
12.1.5.  Investigator Presence  
The Investigator or physicia n designee will be present approximately [ADDRESS_87772]’s treatment 
visit. The Investiga tor will be responsible for ensuring that a study subject is sufficiently 
medically stable to be safely discharged from the clinical unit (EMU or GCRC) regardless of 
whether the subject has received study drug.  
12.1.6.  Follow -up of AEs  
All AEs, whether serious or non -serious, will be monitored throughout the study and 
followed to resolution or for up to [ADDRESS_87773] s will be instructed to inform clinic personnel of any AEs that may arise during 
the study. Treatment of AEs will be administered under the direction of the Investigator.  
All symptoms will be recorded by [CONTACT_80379] r 
prior to any subsequent dosing .  
When appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to document 
resolution of the event(s).  
Adverse events will be coded into the Preferred Term (PT), classified according to 
Version 20.0 of the Medical Dic tionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) with 
System Organ Classification (SOC) and reported with severity, duration, onset time and 
relationship to study drug and action taken.  
Female subjects of child -bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy te st before 
study drug administration at each Treatment Visit. Any cases of pregnancy in female 
subjects  or in female sexual partners of male subjects  that become known after 
administration of study drug will be reported immediately by [CONTACT_80380]/em ailing a completed Pregnancy Report to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 
hours of knowledge of the event. The pregnancy will not be processed as a n SAE; 
however, the Investigator will follow the subject until completion of the pregnancy and 
must assess t he outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than 30  days after 
completion of the pregnancy. The Investigator should notify the Sponsor (or designee) of 
the pregnancy outcome by [CONTACT_17258] a follow -up Pregnancy Report. If the outcome of 
the pregna ncy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE (e.g., 
spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus 
is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator 
will re port the event by [CONTACT_80381] a completed SAE form to the Sponsor (or 
designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  
All SAEs, whether or not the event is deemed drug -related, will be reported on the SAE 
Report Form by [CONTACT_80382], Syneos 
Health, within 24 hours of the Investigator or site staff becoming aware of the SAE.  
The safety address where SAE report forms and other SAE related documents should be 
sent is:

 14. PHARMACOKINETIC AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
14.1. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Data Set  
The data from the following subjects will be included in the final PK and statistical 
analysis:  
• Subjects who com plete at least one treatment period.  
• Subjects who have missed samples but for whom it has been predicted prior to the 
start of bioanalytical analysis that reliable estimates of the PK parameters should 
be possible.  
Data from subjects who were dismissed/wit hdrawn (for any reason other than non -
compliance) or who withdrew will be evaluated by a Syneos  Health PK specialist and/or 
the Sponsor for inclusion in the PK and statistical analysis. If reliable estimation of PK 
parameters is judged possible, the data w ill be included in the analysis. If removed from 
the analysis, the data will be presented separately.  
Any decision for excluding data from the final data set will be provided with a detailed 
explanation and will be properly recorded and dated.  
The final data set will be defined prior to sample analysis.  
14.2. Data Analyzed  
Pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_80383]/third party 
as determined by [CONTACT_1034].  
Pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis will be performed on all data from all subjects in 
the final data set (Intent -to-Treat population). The actual time of blood samples collection 
will be used for PK and statistical analysis.  
The PK and/or statistical analyses outlined in this protocol may be altered with 
appropriat e justification.  
A final Statistical Analysis Plan will be issued prior to database lock.  
14.2.1.  Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The following PK parameters will be estimated (where possible) for diazepam  and 
included in the PK and statistical analysis for the subjects in the final data set:

 Cmax The maximal observed plasma concentration  
Tmax Time when the maximal plasma concentration is observed  
For PK and statistical analyses, drug concentrations below the lower limit of quantitation 
(BLQ) of an assay will be considered as zero except when they occur between two non -
BLQ concentrations where they will be considered as missing during PK calculations and 
estimations.  
Missed samples and non -reportable concentrations (e.g., quantity not sufficient) from the 
analytic al laboratory will be treated as missing in the PK analysis.  
14.2.2.  Statistical Analysis  
Summary statistics will be reported for pharmacokinetic, safety, and usability endpoints. 
No formal statistical tests will be performed to compare Period A vs. Period B on 
pharmacokinetic, safety, or usability endpoints. All analyses will be descriptive and 
exploratory.  
Summary statistics of pharmacokinetic data  will include intra -subject comparisons of 
Cmax and T max for diazepam.  
Summary statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_80384], and data will 
be explored for the potential influence of concomitant medications. No efficacy analysis 
will be performed.  
The following age categories will be used for analysis: ages 2 to 5 years, ages 6 to 11 
years, and ages 12 to 16 years.  
14.2.3.  Safety Endpoints  
Frequency of the following safety endpoints  will be reported:  
• Type, incidence, and severity of AEs  
• TEAEs related to study drug  
• TEAEs leading to discontinuation  
• SAEs  
• Columbia Suicide Severity Rating scale (age-appropriate versions)

For purposes of the analysis, it is intended that seizures reported as AEs as described in 
Section  12.1.1  will be handled as unrelated to the study drug.  
14.2.4.  Usability Endpoints  
Frequency of the following usability endpoints  will be reported for each treatment 
period:  
• Oral cavity placement assessment  
- Whether placement was successfully achieved  
- Time of successful film placement.  
- Placement location (right or left side)  
• Oral cavity insertion and retention assessment  
- Number of attempts needed to achieve successful placement  
▪ An attempt is defined as inser ting the finger with the film into the 
subject’s mouth. Placement is judged to be successful when the film 
adheres to the center of the buccal mucosa of either the right or the left 
cheek, as shown in Appendix A .) 
▪ Categorical explanations will be captured for attempt failures  
- Whether any remnant of the film remained [ADDRESS_87774] 
after adherence to the buccal mucosa  
▪ Categorical explanations will be provided for each occurrence  
▪ Whether film was reinserted  
- Number of occurrences of saliva exiting the subject’s mouth  
▪ Recorded time and estimated amount of saliva (in mL)  
▪ Categorical explanations will be recorded for each occurrence  
- Whether subject had removed film or parts of film from the subject’s mouth 
(as revealed by [CONTACT_80385]’s hands).

Placement Diagram for Aquestive Therapeutics  
Diazepam  Buccal Film  (DBF ) 
Test Drug: Placement against the  buccal mucosa (either side can be against mucosa):  
The DBF  film is to be centered against the inner aspect of the right or left cheek, as 
illustrated by [CONTACT_80387].  Film may be placed without regard to the location of 
the parotid duct.  
Ensure film is completely adhered to the mucosal surface.  
Note:  Figure is for illustrative purposes and not drawn to scale.  
 
Figure: Test Drug: Placement of Aquestive Therapeutics  Buccal Film against the 
buccal mucosa of the mouth.  
Subject s are not required to lie on their side after administration; AE reports in  PK 
studies in  healthy adults indicate an increased incidence of somnolence when the subject 
lies on their side.

IRB#: [ZIP_CODE] [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] Date 03/23/[ADDRESS_1175037]-anesthesia care unit PO By [CONTACT_1966]  1.0 Background & Rationale  A multimodal analgesic approach is the mainstay of controlling postoperative pain and reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_845546] (ERAS) protocols [ACOG 2018]. This includes scheduled acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, in addition to neuromodulators such as gabapentin. Perioperative gabapentin has been proven to reduce inpatient opi[INVESTIGATOR_845547]. This is desirable given the ongoing opi[INVESTIGATOR_845548], including opi[INVESTIGATOR_74433], dependence, constipation, and dizziness. However, the ideal dose and timing of administration of gabapentin has not been defined. This is reflected by [CONTACT_845572], ERAS Society guidelines for gynecologic/oncology, and the Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (AAGL).  The ACOG practice bulletin on ERAS protocols recommends consideration of gabapentin 600 mg preoperatively and scheduled gabapentin postoperatively [ACOG 2018]. ERAS Society guidelines for perioperative care in gynecologic/oncology surgery recommend but do not specify the dose or timing of routine preoperative administration of gabapentin in addition to consideration for postoperative use [Nelson 2019]. In contrast, AAGL released a task force in August [ADDRESS_1175038] the use of gabapentin in ERAS protocols, citing the FDA safety concerns [Stone 2021]. The FDA safety communication published December 2019 warned that serious breathing difficulties may occur in patients using gabapentin concurrently with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2454] [FDA 2019].  However, as stated above, use of perioperative gabapentin decreases inpatient opi[INVESTIGATOR_845549]. While efforts to reduce use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_845550], judicious use of gabapentin is warranted given changes in its safety profile. Determining if preoperative gabapentin use alone is noninferior to preoperative and postoperative gabapentin in reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_845551].  The purpose of this study is to determine if preoperative gabapentin is noninferior to preoperative and postoperative gabapentin for pain control in patients undergoing surgery for pelvic organ prolapse.   2.0 Objective(s) 2.1 Primary Objective 
IRB#: [ZIP_CODE] [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] Date 03/23/[ADDRESS_1175039] rates of nausea and sedation associated with gabapentin usage.   3.0 Outcome Measures/Endpoints 3.1 Primary Outcome Measures The primary outcome that will be measured is the percentage of patients requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_845552] [Margolis 2020]. If patient received less than [ADDRESS_1175040] a new opi[INVESTIGATOR_16447] (if they were discharged without a prescription) or to request an opi[INVESTIGATOR_380502] (if they were discharged with a prescription) within the 6-week postoperative time period.  Pain scores in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_845553] a numeric rating scale (0-10) with [ADDRESS_1175041] of nursing care for assessing patient pain. Nursing staff assesses pain via numeric rating scale every 4 hours on arrival to the floor.  Total morphine milligram equivalents used will be calculated by [CONTACT_845573][INVESTIGATOR_845554].  Length of stay will be measured in hours by [CONTACT_845574][INVESTIGATOR_307].  Nausea will be measured by [CONTACT_256193] “as needed” antiemetics the patient received postoperatively.  Sedation will be measured by [CONTACT_7242][INVESTIGATOR_7110]. This is a self-administered scale that the patient will complete at 10AM on postoperative day 1.  3.3 Tertiary/Exploratory/Correlative Outcome Measures

  Page 5 of 13  The following demographic data will be extracted from the initial history and physical note, as these are standardly collected:  age (year), race (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Other), BMI, tobacco use (current, former, never), menopause status (premenopausal, postmenopausal), Charlson Comorbidity Index (a calculation using patient’s comorbidities to predict estimated 10-year survival), number of prior abdominal/pelvic surgeries, and stage of prolapse.  The following intraoperative data will be collected from the immediate postoperative note written by [CONTACT_11065]:  estimated blood loss and type of surgery (native tissue laparoscopic, native tissue vaginal, mesh-augmented laparoscopic, obliterative).  Duration of surgery (from skin incision to closure) and ASA physical status class will be collected from the IntraOp nursing record.   4.0 Eligibility Criteria 4.1 Inclusion Criteria • Women > 18 years old • English-speaking • Stage > 2 pelvic organ prolapse • Undergoing pelvic organ prolapse procedure (including native tissue vaginal procedure, native tissue laparoscopic procedure, mesh-augmented laparoscopic procedure, obliterative procedure) • Planning overnight stay  4.2 Exclusion Criteria • Renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <60 mL/min) • Allergy to acetaminophen and ibuprofen • Allergy to gabapentin • Patients on a Controlled Substance Agreement or Opi[INVESTIGATOR_845555].

If they are not excluded from study participation, they will be counseled on potential risks, benefits, and alternatives to study participation. Any questions potential subjects have regarding the study will be answered in a language understandable to them at the conclusion of the visit. Study personnel will counsel potential subjects that they will be randomized to receive either the current standard of postoperative care (scheduled acetaminophen every 6 hours, scheduled ibuprofen every 6 hours, and scheduled gabapentin twice daily with oxycodone “PRN” or “as needed”) or the current standard of care without gabapentin. Patients who are willing to participate in the study will be asked to sign informed consent/HIPAA Authorization form establishing the privacy and confidentiality standards for the study. Study subjects will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_845559].   An online random number generator (www.randomizer.org) will be used to create the random number set. This set will be used by [CONTACT_845575]:  the preoperative gabapentin/postoperative placebo (which will receive gabapentin preoperatively and placebo postoperatively) or the preoperative/postoperative gabapentin group (which will receive gabapentin preoperatively and postoperatively). The patient and the surgical team will be blinded to group randomization.  Case report forms will be used to collect demographic data and outcome measures at the 6-week postoperative visit.

After confirming stabilization in the PACU (usually 1-2 hours), patients will be moved to the medical floor for standard postoperative care. Patients in the preoperative/postoperative gabapentin group will receive the standard postoperative pain regimen:  acetaminophen 1,000 mg every 6 hours, ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours, and gabapentin 300 mg every 12 hours. Patients in the preoperative gabapentin/postoperative placebo group will receive acetaminophen 1,[ADDRESS_1175048] oxycodone 5 mg PO every 4 hours available for “PRN” or “as needed” for pain control.

The preoperative gabapentin/postoperative placebo group will receive placebo rather than gabapentin postoperatively. As such, anticipated risks of study participation include risk of inadequate postoperative pain control, though this is unlikely as patients will also have access to oxycodone on an as-needed basis. As such, a foreseeable risk to the study will be risk of receiving more “as needed” oxycodone to achieve pain control for patients in this group. Oxycodone [ADDRESS_1175053] initial dosage and frequency of administration recommended for oxycodone [FDA oxycodone]. This dosage and frequency is already part of standard of care for our postoperative patients. This essentially negates the risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_845562].   Should an unexpected adverse event, protocol deviation, or consent violation occur, this will be reported to the IRB within 5 business days of the study personnel becoming aware, as per the IU HRPP Reportable Events section 2.1. Collection of adverse events will begin at time of consent at the preoperative consultation visit.  10.0 Data Safety Monitoring

Differential opi[INVESTIGATOR_845563]. A physician is reachable at any time via DiagNotes, a real-time messaging system, should any concerns arise. Unexpected adverse events will be reported to the IRB within 5 business days by [CONTACT_458].  11.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  Study participants have the right to withdraw from this study at any time and for any reason, or no reason at all. There are no legal requirements for study participants to communicate their withdrawal in writing. In fact, they have the right to just stop coming to visits allowing the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_845564]. Withdrawal from study participation will not affect their postoperative care.   12.0 Statistical Considerations  Assuming a 15% or less dropout rate, 130 patients will need to be recruited to reach a sample size of 110 patients. Sample size was calculated for a noninferiority trial. Assuming 23.1% of patients who receive preoperative and postoperative gabapentin in addition to scheduled acetaminophen and ibuprofen require an opi[INVESTIGATOR_845565] a 20% non-inferiority margin, 55 patients per arm are required to achieve a power of 80% with a significance level of 0.05 [Margolis 2020].  Two group comparisons of normally distributed study variables will be compared using the Student’s T-test. Two group comparisons of nonnormally distributed study variables will be 
IRB#: [ZIP_CODE] [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] Date 03/23/[ADDRESS_1175055] is the percentage of study subjects receiving an opi[INVESTIGATOR_608004]. Given the noninferiority study design, the null hypothesis is that the difference in the percentage of subjects who receive an opi[INVESTIGATOR_845566]/postoperative placebo group will exceed 20% compared to the preoperative/postoperative gabapentin group. The alternative hypothesis is that the difference in the percentage of subjects who receive an opi[INVESTIGATOR_845566]/postoperative placebo group will be less than 20% compared to the preoperative/postoperative gabapentin group.  Chi-square test for association with relative risk estimates will be calculated to compare the percentage of study subjects receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_845567]. We will accept our preoperative gabapentin/postoperative placebo group as noninferior to our preoperative/postoperative gabapentin group if the difference in percentage of subjects receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_845568] 20% between the two groups (alternative hypothesis).  13.0 Statistical Data Management  Data will be collected via paper case report forms which will be stored in a locked filing cabinet accessible only to the primary investigatory. Data will then be entered into REDCap and stored electronically prior to export into SPSS for data analysis.  14.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  With exception of the Stanford Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110], data is stored in the electronic medical record as part of standard clinical care. Study personnel are also the patients’ surgeons, and as such have legitimate justification to having access to the study participants’ protected health information (PHI). All PHI collected will be de-identified using the Safe Harbor Method outlined in the IU HRPP Policy Statement for Use of Protected Health Information section 2.3. Study participants will be assigned a study number at enrollment. The study log will be secured in a locked filing cabinet to which only the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16884] a key. The de-identified database created from case report forms will also be stored in the locked filing cabinet. Only the pharmacy will have knowledge of group randomization. Group randomization assignments will not be accessed until all case report forms have been filled out, at which point each subject will be linked to their group and data will be analyzed. None of the personal health information, case report forms, or Stanford Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_845569].   15.[ADDRESS_1175056], shall be retained for a period of three years from the date

 6 2 STUDY DESCRIPTION  
2.1 Study Design  
This is a multi -center, randomized, cross -over, placebo and active-controlled, double -blind, 
study of continuous 5 -hour intravenous (IV) infusions of BMS -986231 in patients with heart 
failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The trial is designed to evaluate the effects of 
BMS-986231 on systolic and diastolic  parameters measured by [CONTACT_51541].  
A cross-over design will be implemented in this trial; every subject will be exposed to each of 
the 3 interventions (BMS-986231, Nitroglycerin (NTG) and placebo) in [ADDRESS_510171] 7 days, but no more than 4 weeks.  
42 study participants will be randomized to receive BMS -986231, NTG, and placebo, in one of 
the 6 possible sequences.  
NTG, BM S-986231 and placebo will be administered as a 5 -hours infusion according to an 
uptitration schedule, which is achieved by [CONTACT_404607]. All three 
interventions (NTG, BMS -986231 and placebo) will have the same flow rate: 5 mL/H for  10 
min, followed by 10 mL/H for 10 minutes then 20 mL/H for the rest of the infusion.  
The corresponding doses of the active study medications will be:  
 NTG: 20 μg/min for 10 min, followed by 40 μg/min for 10 min, followed by 80 μg/min for 
the rest of the 5 -hour infusion;  
 BMS-986231: 3 μg/kg/min for 10 min, followed by 6 μg/kg/min for 10 min, followed by 12 
μg/kg/min for the rest of the 5 -hour infusion.  
In case of a decrease in systolic blood pressure, an algorithm will be used to down -titrate 
/interrupt or discontinue the study drug infusion  (see protocol Section 7.4 ). 
The study design schematic is presented in  Figure 2.1-1.

day. Screening will assess the eligibility criteria including assessment of ejection fraction, 
suitability of echocardiography windows and image quality. After screening, study participants 
will be enrolled in the study according to their eligibility as per the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, and will be randomized to 1 of the 6 sequences that will be conducted in parallel.  
Treatment day (Day 1 of each period)  
Study participants will be admitted to the study facility on the treatment day, which will be Day 
1 of each of the three periods. Assessment of vital signs and laboratory tests will be performed 
pre-dose. In each treatment day, blood pressure and heart rate should be within the inclusion / 
exclusion criteria limits, and no atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter should be present in order to 
start the study treatment. The study drug infusion could start without waiting for the results of 
the laboratory assessments done in the morning of the tre atment day at the study facility if the 
following criteria are met:  
 The results of the laboratory assessment at screening / previous period are within ranges 
compatible with inclusion/exclusion criteria,  
 The study participant was medically stable without c hange in medication since the screening 
visit / previous period.  
If the laboratory tests (e.g. electrolytes, serum creatinine, eGFR, hemoglobin, transaminases) in 
the morning prior to the infusion are not within inclusion and exclusion criteria limits, the  study 
drug will be discontinued after consultation with the medical monitor. The abnormalities should 
be corrected before the next treatment period.  
Physical examinations, vital sign measurements, 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECG), 
echocardiography, whole body bioimpedance and pulse wave analysis (non -invasive central 
aortic blood pressure) will be performed at selected times throughout the dosing interval. 
Participants will be closely monitored for adverse events throughout the study. Blood samples 
will also be collected at selected intervals after start of study drug administration for 
pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis.  
Discharge  
Study participants will remain in the study facility for approximately 3.[ADDRESS_510173] -dose and 
discharged on the same day, unless the investigator and the study team consider that an overnight 
stay is warranted. Same -day discharge is allowed if the following conditions are met:  
 in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_404605],  
 there is no hypotension after mobili zation and  
 none of the following events occurred during the study drug infusion: prolonged 
hypotension, symptoms of hypotension, new onset of sustained arrhythmia requiring 
pharmacologic or other interventions, any other events of concern e.g. chest pain s uggestive 
of ischemia.

 9 2.2 Treatment Assignment  
This study will use Interactive Response Technology (IRT): All participants will be centrally 
randomized using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Subjects will be randomized using 
IRT in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 rat io to one of six sequences, as shown in Figure 2.1-1, with block size of 
six, to ensure the number of subjects randomized to each sequence remains balanced. 
Study treatment will be dispensed at the study visits as listed in Schedule of Activities (Protocol 
Section 2 ). 
Enrolled participants, including those not dosed, will be assigned sequential participant numbers 
starting with [ZIP_CODE], (e.g., [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE], 0000 3.... [ZIP_CODE]). Those enrolled participants meeting 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible to be randomized. Randomization ID numbers 
will be assigned prior to dosing. Subjects who are re -enrolled (Protocol Section 6.4 ) will be 
assigned a new part icipant number.  An estimated [ADDRESS_510174] is critical to the participant's management, the blin d for that 
participant may be broken by [CONTACT_093]. The participant ’s safety takes priority over any 
other considerations in determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded.  
Before breaking the blind of an individual participant's treatment , the investigator should 
determine that the unblinded information is necessary, i.e., that it will alter the participant's 
immediate management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not related to 
the investigational product, the prob lem may be properly managed by [CONTACT_404608]. It is highly desirable that the decision to unblind treatment 
assignment be discussed with the Medical Monitor, but the investigator always has ultimate 
authority for  the decision to unblind. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_404606].  
For this study, the method of unblinding for emergency purposes is via the Interactive Respon se 
Technology (IRT) system. For information on how to unblind in an emergency, consult the IRT 
manual. 
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact [CONTACT_180807].  
Any request to unblind a participa nt for non -emergency purposes should be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor.  
The Bioanalytical Sciences section or its designate may be unblinded to the randomized 
treatment assignments, in order to minimize unnecessary assays of samples from subject during  
Statistical Analysis Plan  CV013020  
BMS-[ADDRESS_510175] or designate(s) in Clinical Pharmacology and 
Pharmacometrics , biostatistician(s) and programmer(s) at BMS, or designee, may be unblinded 
in order to prepare preliminary summaries of PK and safety data, as needed. These summaries 
will not reveal individual subjects’ treatment sequence assignments.  
 
2.4 Protocol Amendmen ts 
This statistical analysis plan (SAP) is based on the revised protocol version 0 2, which 
incorporates Amendment 0 2, dated 01-Sep-2017. 
2.5 Data Monitoring Committee and Other External Committees  
There is no Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) planned for this study. The occurrence of 
significant safety events will be submitted for review to the independent DMC that monitors the 
ongoing phase 2b study  CV013011 , evaluating the safety, tolerability and e ffectiveness of BMS -
986231 in a population of acute decompensated heart failure patients ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
The executive committee will be a small body comprised of academic leaders. The executive 
committee will provide advice on overall design, study endpoin ts and recommendations for 
study sites, and will review results from final analyses with Sponsor.

4.4 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints 
 Pharmacokinetic endpoints include the Plasma concentrations of BMS -986231 and its 
metabolites  
5 SAMPLE SIZE AND POWE R 
In a review of stroke volumes and SVIs from the literature , baseline SVI generally ranged from 
30-40 mL/m ², with inter -individual standard deviation ( SD) of approximately 25 – 35% of the 
mean. Likewise, SV values generally ranged from 50 -70 mL, with inter -individual SD of 
approximately 25 – 35% of the mean. Results from these studies also suggest intra -individual 
correlations in the range of 0.6 – 0.8. 
Sample size calculations  assume baseline SVI of approximately 30 mL/m ², with placebo values 
consistent with baseline, an increase of 15% from baseline, relative to placebo, as meaningful 
(e.g. 4.5 mL/m ²), an inter -individual SD of 10 mL/m ², and intra -individual correlations for t he 
difference between placebo and HNO of 0.7. Using these assumptions, approximately 36 
subjects with data from treatment periods being compared will be required to achieve a power of 
90%, with a type I error probability of 0.05 (2 -sided). In order to addr ess the potential for 
missing data arising from dropout, an allowance of 15% subjects will be included, with a 
resulting target sample size of [ADDRESS_510177] baseline values, adjusting for the differences in the 
baseline value.  The blinded SVI data will be reviewed after 50% of the planned treated subjects 
have completed treatment . BMS will consider re -estimating the sample size based on the 
observed SD. The review of SVI data will be repeated if necessary.

presentati ons. S-Plus® may be also used for graphical presentations.  
7.1 General Methods  
Descriptive summaries will be presented for continuous variables using number of subjects (N), 
mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum.  
Descriptive summaries for  categorical variables will utilize counts and percentages. Several 
analyses noted in subsequent sections will present 95% confidence intervals (CIs), but no pre -
specified significance testing will be included . 
In general, continuous variables will be anal yzed using a mixed -effect model with sequence, 
treatment period, and treatment, and the difference in the treatment period baselines as a 
covariate. From the statistical modeling, the means, standard errors, and 2 -sided 95% confidence 
intervals for the dif ference between BMS-986231 and the other treatment group will be 
presented. The analyses for efficacy and exploratory  endpoints will use a nominal level of

 16 1.1.2 Demographic s and Baseline  Characteristics  
Frequency distributions and summary statistics for demographic and baseline variables will be 
presented for all enrolled subjects. Demographic variables to be s ummarized include: age, 
gender, race, ethnicity, and region . 
Baseline variables to be summarized include the following:  
 Physical measurements (height, body weight, body mass index)  
 Vital signs ( body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], systolic and diastolic blood pressure  and heart 
rate) 
1.1.[ADDRESS_510183] be 
discontinued if an adverse event or any other safety issue su ggests it is not in the patient ’s best 
interest to continue to receive study drug.  
The investigator has the option to adjust the study drug dosage level downward by 50%, 
interrupt, or discontinue the study drug infusion in patients that develop hypotension, or if the 
patient experiences symptomatic hypotension that is not easily tolerated, as follows  
 Study drug reduction : Study drug is decreased by 50% if SBP decreases to levels <90  mmHg 
but ≥80 mmHg. The dose cannot be subsequently increased.  
 Study drug interruption : Study drug is interrupted for 1 hour if SBP decreases to <[ADDRESS_510184] 4 hours of infusion. If the SBP is 
105 mmHg  after one hour interruption, the study drug could be resumed at 50 % of the 
dose to complete 5 -hours of effective study drug infusion.  
 Study drug discontinuation : Study drug will be permanently discontinued if SBP remains < 
105 mmHg after 1 hour interrupt ion or if SBP decreases to levels <[ADDRESS_510185] (LVOT VTI) at 
the end of the [ADDRESS_510186] squares (OLS) 
model for difference of treatment effects, under the assumption of unstructured covariance 
structure. The Kenward -Roger approximation for the degrees of freedom will be specified for the 
model. 
Estimation of the variance covariance will  be based on unstructured (UN) R matrix assuming no 
common variances or covariances.

All reported seri ous adverse events (SAEs) will be listed by [CONTACT_1196] (SOCs) and 
Preferred Terms (PTs) for all safety population  subjects. SAEs must be collected from the date of 
informed consent and will be assessed up to [ADDRESS_510191] period.  
7.6.3 Adverse Events  
All AEs will be coded and grouped into PT by [CONTACT_2946], using current version of Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All recorded AEs will be summarized and listed by [CONTACT_404613],  
PTs and treatment group . 
Non-serious AEs  with onset time from  the start of study drug infusion, until [ADDRESS_510192] identifier, age, g ender, current treatment, the date 
and time of onset, the date and time of resolution, day of onset relative to the start of treatment, 
action taken, investigator’s assessment of severity and relationship to study drug. Additional 
listings will be provided  for adverse events leading to discontinuation and adverse events without 
recorded resolution. Summaries of adverse events will include adverse events, adverse events by 
[CONTACT_404614].   
Where a subject has the same adverse e vent, based on preferred terminology, reported multiple 
times in a single analysis period, the subject will only be counted once at the preferred 
terminology level in adverse event frequency tables.  
Where a subject has multiple adverse events within the sa me system organ class in a single 
analysis period, the subject will only be counted once at the system organ class level in adverse 
event frequency tables.  
When a subject has the same adverse event, based on preferred terminology, reported multiple 
times in a single analysis period, the following criteria, in order of precedence, will be used to 
select the event to be included in summary tables:  
 Relationship to study medication  
 Intensity of event  
 Onset date and time  
When reporting adverse events by [CONTACT_2236], in addition to providing a summary table based on 
the event selection criteria detailed above, summary tables will also be provided based on the 
most intense event  during the analysis period - independent of relationship to study medication. 
For these tables, the following criteria, in order of precedence, will be used to select the event to 
be included in summary  tables: 
 Intensity of event

7.6.5 ECG 
All recorded ECGs (heart rate (HR), QT (QT, Bazett’s corrected QT [QTcB], Fridericia's 
corrected QT [QTcF]), PR and QRS intervals) will be listed.  
Summaries of ECG parameters (heart rate (HR), QT (QT, QTcF), PR and QRS intervals) will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_247072]. Summaries of ECG parameters will include change from 
baseline at  list of time points.  
If QTcF is not available in the database, QTcF will be calculated using the reported uncorrected 
QT Interval and Heart Rate, and the following formula:  
 3 / 160 RATEHEARTQTQTcF
 
 
Subjects with ECG intervals outside of a pre -specified range will also be listed.  
The following criteria will be used to determine ECG results that are outside of a pre -specified 
range: 
PR (msec):  Value > 200  
QRS (msec):  Value > 120  
QT (msec):  Value > 500 or change from baseline > 30  
QTcF (msec):  Value > 45 0 or change from baseline > [ADDRESS_510194] when the dose is lowered 
due to a safety event and also at time of early discontinuation of study drug.  Pharmacokinetic 
parameters for BMS -986231 and BMT-284730 and other metabolites ( e.g., BMT-279554 and 
CAR-000463) will be estimated  as appropriate . The plasma concentration data may also be used 
to conduct population pharmacokinetic analysis and exposure -response analysis with select 
efficacy and safety endpoints.  Results of the population pharmacokinetic and e xposure-response 
analysis will be reported in a separate report.  
The PK population will be used for all listings. The Evaluable PK population will be used  for 
summaries and statistical analyses.  Geometric mean and coefficient of variation (%CV) will also 

Statistical Analysis Plan  CV013020  
BMS-[ADDRESS_510195] plasma concentration -time profiles will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_404616]. Plots of mean (+SD) plasma concentration profiles 
versus time will be presented for each analyte, and all treatments will be superimposed on the 
same plot.  Concentration at the  end of infusion will also be summarized by t reatment, which is 
the concentration at hour 5 for subjects completing 5 hours infusion and the concentration 
collected at early discontinuation for subjects not completing 5 hours infusion . The PK sample s 
collected when the dose is  lowered due to a safety  event will be listed. 
 
8 CONVENTIONS  
8.1 Safety Data Conventions  
Except as noted in Section 7.6, safety data will be handled according to the BMS safety data 
conventions4. This document includes descriptions on how to analyze AE data as well as how to 
handle partial dates, missing dates, and unknown end dates when analyzing safety data.  If onset 
time of AEs is missing or incomplete, the onset date of AEs will be used to determine if the AEs 
will be included in the AE summary tables as follows. 
 Non-serious AEs will be included in summary tables if the onset date /time is on or after the 
start of the study drug infusion until 24 hours after endo f infusion in each treatment period 
of dosing.  
 Serious AEs will be included in summary tables if the onset date /time is on or after the start 
date of study drug infusion until [ADDRESS_510196] to 
the target day for that nominal visit will be used; in the case of a tie, the measurement obtained 
on the earlier day will be used in the analyses.  
Statistical Analysis Plan  CV013020  
BMS-986231 pro-drug of HNO  
 26 For tabulations of incidence of marked abnormalities (e.g. ALT > 3xULN), if m ultiple laboratory 
measurements are obtained within the same nominal visit, then the worst measurement within the 
nominal visit window nominal visit will be used.  
Vital Signs and ECGs  
If multiple vital sign or ECG measurements are obtained within the same nominal visit,  then the 
measurement obtained on the day closest to the target day for that nominal visit  will be used; in 
the case of a tie, the measurement obtained on the earlier day will be used  in the analyses.  
8.4 Pharmacokinetic Summaries  
In-text Tables  
For in-text pharmacokinetic tables, coefficient of variation (%CV) will be reported as integers. 
For other statistics except for standard deviations, values of 100 or higher will be presented as 
integers, values of 10 - <[ADDRESS_510197], and values of 1 - < [ADDRESS_510198] more than the mean.  
Handling of Non -Quantifiable Concentrations  
For the summaries of  plasma concentration -time data, concentrations that are less than the lower 
limit of quantification (LLOQ) should be displayed as “< LLOQ” in the listings and be tre ated as 
missing in summary tables and plots.   
All available plasma concentration -time data will be included in the PK data set and listed 
accordingly.  
Treatment of Outliers  
Individual  plasma concentrations, if deemed to be anomalous, may be excluded from the analysis 
following a review of available documentation (e.g., bioanalytical report, clinical data). Any 
such exclusion will be clearly listed in the study report along with justification for exclusion.  
Entire plasma concentration -time profiles for a su bject may be excluded following review of 
available documentation (e.g., bioanalytical report, clinical data). However, results of analysis 
with and without the excluded profiles may be presented in the study report. Any such exclusion 
will be clearly list ed in the study report along with justification for exclusion.  
PK Exclusions5 
PK Analysis, Reporting, and Exclusion criteria should follow the BMS PK Harmonization 
document Version 3.0.  
9 CONTENT OF REPORTS  
Statistical components for the clinical study report will be based on the content of this statistical 
analysis plan (SAP). Details of the tables, listings, and figures to be prepared for interim analyses 
and the final CSR will be included in a study -specific Data Presentation Plan (DPP).

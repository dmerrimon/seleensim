Detailed Title A phase IIIA, randomised, observer -blind, multi -centre study  
to evaluate the clinical consistency  of three production lots of 
the Porcine circovirus (PCV) -free liquid formulation of 
GlaxoSmithKline ([COMPANY_004]) Biologicals’ oral live attenuated 
human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine and to evaluate the PCV -free 
liquid formul ation of [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ HRV vaccine as 
compared to the currently licensed ly ophilised formulation of

Rationale for the 
study and study 
designRationale for the stud y
Using advanced technology  in 2010, researchers from the 
University  of [LOCATION_004], San Francisco identified 
Deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments of Porcine 
circovirus type 1 (PCV -1) in Rotarix . Further investigations 
conducted by [CONTACT_35316] ([COMPANY_004]) and the [LOCATION_002] 
(US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed the 
presence of PCV -[ADDRESS_793870] es of 4 infants from the HRV 
group (at Day  [ADDRESS_793871] Dose 1). The detection of 
PCV -[ADDRESS_793872] -vaccination 
was consistent with transient passage of DNA through the 
infants’ digestive tracts without replication. Lack of PCV-[ADDRESS_793873] occurrence 
of PCV -1 infection in infants who received Rotarix in clinical 
trials [Dubin, 2013]. These results are consistent with 
published litera ture which indicates that PCV -1 is not capable 
of causing infection in humans [Hattermann, 2004a; 
Hattermann, 2004b].
[COMPANY_004] is in the process of replacing the cell bank and virus 
seeds used as base production material for its HRV vaccine. In

approved production and quality  standards to meet public 
health needs worldwide.
Rationale for the stud y design
In order to support licensure of the PCV -free liquid HRV 
vaccine, [COMPANY_004] Biologicals proposes to conduct a clinical study  
to demonstrate the lot- to-lot consistency  of the PCV -free 
liquid HRV vaccine in terms of anti- RV Immunoglobulin A 
(IgA)antibody  geometric mean antibody  concentrations 
(GMCs), 1 -2 mon ths after Dose 2 and the non -inferiority  of 
the PCV -free liquid HRV vaccine to [COMPANY_004] Biologica ls’ 
currentl y licensed lyophilis ed HRV vaccine in terms of anti -
rotavirus IgA seroconversion rates an d GMCs 1- 2 months 
after Dose 2.
This study  is planned to be con ducted in 1600 ch ildren aged 
6-12 weeks, randomis ed (1:1:1:1) between groups receiving 
[COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ currently  licensed ly ophilised HRV vaccine 
and three different lots of PCV -free liquid HRV vaccine.
The current ly ophilised PCV -containing vaccine will be used 
as control, since the study is planned to be conducted in US 
and non- US sites and the liquid formulation of Rotarix is not 
licensed in the US.
Two oral doses of the study  vaccines will be administered at 
an approximate [ADDRESS_793874] Dose 2.
An Independen t Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC)will 
review the safet y data of the first 5%, 10% and 50% of the 
subjects enrolled to evaluate if there is an y safety concern 
with the PCV -free liquid HRV vaccine. Enrolment will be 
pause d when first 10% of study  sets are enrolled, for the 
purpose of the IDMC review of the safet y data up to [ADDRESS_793875] dose 2 (Day  0-Day 7)and will only  resume if the 
outcome of the IDMC review is positive.
Objectives Co-Primary
To demonstrate the lot- to-lot consistency  of the PCV -free 
liquid HRV vaccine in terms of immunogenicit y as 
measured b y serum anti -RV IgA antibody  concentrations 
1-2 months after Dose 2.

09-MAR -2017 10Consistency will be demonstrated if, for all pairs of lots, the 
two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratio of 
anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs 1 -2 months after Dose 2 are 
within the [0.5; 2 ] clinical limit interval.
To demonstrate the immunological non -inferiority  of 
PCV -free liquid HRV vaccine as compared to the 
currentl y licensed lyophilised HRV vaccine in terms of 
seroconversion rates 1 -2 months after Dose 2.
Non-inferiority will be demonstrated if the lower limit of the 
two-sided asymptotic standardized 95% CI for the difference 
in seroconversion rate between the PCV- free liquid HRV 
vaccine (pooled HRV liquid groups) and licensed lyophilised 
HRV vaccine is greater than or equal to -10%.
To demonstrate the non -inferiorit y of the PCV -free liquid 
HRV vaccine to that of the currently  licensed l yophilised 
HRV vac cine in terms of serum anti -RV IgA antibody  
concentrations 1-2 months after Dose 2.
Non-inferiority will be demonstrated if the lower limit of the 
two-sided 95% CI for the ratio of anti -RV IgA antibody GMCs 
1-2 months after Dose 2 between the PCV- free l iquid HRV 
vaccine (pooled HRV liquid groups) and the lyophilised HRV 
vaccine is greater than or equal to 0.67.
Secondary
Reactogenicity and safety
To evaluate the reactogenicity of the liquid HRV vaccine 
and currently  licensed l yophilised HRV vaccine in terms 
of solicited AEs during the 8days (Day  0-Day 7) follow -
up period after each vaccination.
To assess the safet y of the study vaccines in terms o f 
unsolicited AEs during the 31 days(Day  0-Day 30) 
follow -up period after each vaccination and Serious 
Adverse Events (SAEs) during the entire stud y period.
Immunogenicity
To assess the immunogenicity  of the PCV -free liquid 
HRV vaccine and the currently licensed l yophilised HRV 
vaccine, in terms of percentage of subjects with anti- RV 
IgA antibod y concentrations ≥ 90 U/mL  1-2 months after 
Dose 2.

Adverse event: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related 
to the medicinal product. 
An Adverse E vent (AE) can therefore be an y 
unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or 
exacerbated) temporall y associated with the use of a 
medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this 
also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i. e.,
lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse.
Blinding: A procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are 
kept unaware of the treatment assignment in order to 
reduce the risk of biased study outcomes. The level of 
blinding is maintained throughout the conduct of the trial, 
and only  when the data are cle aned to an acceptable level 
of quality  will appropriate personnel be unblinded or 
when required in case of a serious adverse event. In an 
observer -blind study , the subject and the site and sponsor 
personnel involved in the clinical evaluation of the 
subjec ts are blinded while other study  personnel may  be 
aware of the treatment assignment (see Section 5.3for 
details on observer -blinded studies). In a double blind 
study , the subject, the investigator and sponsor staff who 
are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of the 
subjects and the review or anal ysis of data are all unaware 
of the treatment assignment.
Child in care: A child who has bee n placed under the control or 
protection of an agency , organisation, institution or entity  
by [CONTACT_285135], the government or a government body , 
acting in accordance with powers conferred on them by  
[CONTACT_6617]. The definition of a child in care can 
include a child cared for by  [CONTACT_301930] a 
care home or institution, provided that the arrangement 
falls within the definition above. The definition of a child 
in care does not include a child who is adopted or has an 
appointed legal guardian .
Diarrhoea: Passage of three or more looser than normal stools within 
a day .
Eligible: Qualified for enrolment into the study  based upon strict 
adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria.

09-MAR -2017 28End of Study 
(Synonym of End of 
Trial):For studies without coll ection of human biologicals 
samples or imaging data EoS is the Last Subject Last 
Visit (L SLV). 
For studies with collection of Human Biologicals 
Samples or imaging data, EoS is defined as the date of 
the last testing/reading released of the Human Biologica l 
Samples or imaging data, related to primary  and 
secondary  endpoints. EoS must be achieved no later than 
8 months after L SLV.
Epoch: An epoch is a self -contained set of consecutive time
points or a single time point from a single protocol. Self -
contained means that data collected for all subjects at all 
time points within that epoch allows to draw a complete 
conclusion to define or precise the targeted label of the 
product. Ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_599644], boosters, yearl y immunogenici ty follow -
ups, and surveillance periods for efficacy  or safet y.
eTrack: [COMPANY_004]’s tracking tool for clinical trials.
Evaluable: Meeting all eligibility  criteria, compl ying with the 
procedures defined in the protocol, and, therefore, 
included in the Per-Protocol Set (PPS)analy sis (see 
Sections 6.7.2 and 10.4 for details on criteria for 
evaluability ).
Gastroenteritis: Diarrhoea with or without vomiting.
Immunological correlate 
of protection:The defined immune response above which there is a high 
likelihood of protection in the absence of an y host factors 
that might increase susceptibility  to the infectious agent.
Investigational vaccine:
(Synonym of 
Investigational Medicinal 
Product)A pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo 
being tested or used as a reference in a clini cal trial, 
including a product with a marketing authorisation when 
used in a way  different from the approved form, or when 
used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain 
further information about an approved use.

09-MAR -2017 321. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background
Rotavirus (RV) infection is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (GE) and severe 
diarrhoea in infants and young children <5 years of age [ Atherl y, 2009]. I t has been 
estimated that in 2008, approximately  453,000 (420,000- 494,000) deaths were caused 
due to RV. Approximately 85% of this burden was in low -income countries globall y 
[WHO position paper , 2013].
Although RV disease only  rarel y causes death in Europe, North America and Australia, it 
has severe effects in countries of southeast Asia (India, Pakistan) and sub -Saharan Africa 
(DR Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria) [ Desselberger ,2012 ]. In developed countries, RV 
infection remains the most common cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599647] m edical and societal costs . During the past y ears, vaccines have been developed 
that could prevent the enormous morbidity  and mortality from RV. Two live oral RV
vaccines have been licensed in many  countries; one is derived from an attenuated human 
strain of RV and the other combines fi vebovine -human reassortant strains [Glass , 2006]. 
Each of these vaccine shas proven highl y effectiv e in preventing severe RV diarrhoea b y
substantially  reducing number and associated costs of child hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599648]. Moreover, these vaccines could reduce deaths from 
diarrhoea and improve child survival through programmes such as childhood 
immunisations and diarrhoeal disease control in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696]. The World He alth 
Organis ation (WHO) recognises RV vaccination as an effective measure to prevent RV 
infection and to reduce disease burden, and recommends its inclusion into all national 
infant immunisation progra ms [WHO position paper , 2013].
GlaxoSmithKl ine ([COMPANY_004]) Biologicals’ RV vaccine (Rotarix™) is a vaccine for oral use, 
containing the live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) RIX4414 strain. Infants aged 
younger than 3 months who received the vaccine did not develop diarrhoea, vomiting or 
fever [ Vesikari , 2004(a) ]. The initial trials that [COMPANY_004] conducted in Finland showed safety , 
immunogenicit y and efficacy of the Rotarix vaccine [ Vesikari ,2004(b)]. InLatin 
American and European studies, vaccine efficacy  of oral live attenuated HRV vaccine 
Rotarix (RIX4414) was high, ranging from 80.5% to 90.4% against severe Rotavirus 
Gastro enteritis (RVGE), and 83.0% to 96.0% against hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599649] y ears of life [Vesikari , 2007; Linhares , 2008]. Furthermore , results from a 
phase III clinical stud y undertaken in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan showed that 
during the first two y ears of life, two doses of R IX4414 vaccine provided a high level of 
protection against severe RVGE (vaccine efficacy : 96.1%), and had a safet y profile 
similar to placebo [Phua , 2012]. Such safety  and efficacy  studies in Europe, L atin 
America and Asia have confirmed that the vaccine is safe, well -tolerated and efficacious 
(range: 80- 96%) in preventing severe RVGE in the first two y ears of life [ Cunliffe , 
2014].
Rotarix is registered in at least 130 countries and about 280million doses of the v accine 
(lyophilised and liquid formulations) are estimated to have been distributed worldwide 
since its launch until July  2015.

1.2. Rationale for the study  and study  design
1.2.1. Rationale f or the study
Using advanced technology  in 2010, researchers from the University  of [LOCATION_004], San 
Francisco identified Deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments of Porcine circovirus type 
1 (PCV -1) in Rotarix . Further investigation s conducted by  [CONTACT_599668] 
(US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed the presence of PCV -1 DNA 
fragments in Rotarix and its starting materials as well as low levels of PCV -1 viral 
particles during production process and in the final container . The evidence from 
retrospective laboratory  investigations conducted by  [CONTACT_599669] 40 HRV vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_599650] -1 while the PCV -1 from the vaccine was identified in the stool 
samples of 4 infants from the HRV group (at Day  [ADDRESS_793896] Dose 1). The 
detection of PCV -[ADDRESS_793897] -vaccination was consistent 
with transient passage of DNA through the infants’ digestive tracts without replication. 
Lack of PCV -[ADDRESS_793898] occurrenc e of PCV-1 
infection in infants who received Rotarix in clinical trials [Dubin, 2013]. These results 
are consistent with published literature which indicates that PCV -1 is n ot capable of 
causing infection in humans [ Hattermann, 2004a; Hattermann, 2004b].
[COMPANY_004] is in theprocess of replacing the cell bank and virus seeds used as base production 
material for its HRV vaccine. In the meantime, and in accordance with the regulators, the 
compan y continues to manufacture Rotarix to the existing approved production and 
quality  standards to meet public health needs worldwide.
1.2.2. Rationale for the study  design
In order to support licensure of the PCV -free liquid HRV vaccine, [COMPANY_004] Biologicals 
proposes to conduct a clinical study to demonstrate the lot -to-lot cons istency of the PCV -
free liquid HRV vaccine in terms of anti -RV Immunoglobulin A (IgA)antibody  
geometric mean antibody concentrations (GMCs) , 1-2 months after Dose 2 and the non -
inferiority  of the PCV -free liquid HRV vaccine to [COMPANY_004] Biologica ls’ currently  licensed 
lyophilised HRV vaccine in terms of anti -rotavirus IgA seroconversion rates and GMCs 
1-2 months after Dose 2. 
This study  is planned to be conducted in 1600 ch ildren aged 6 -12 weeks, randomis ed 
(1:1:1:1) between groups receiving [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ currently  licensed l yophilis ed HRV 
vaccine and three different lots of PCV -free liquid HRV vaccine.

the ICH GCP and [COMPANY_004] Biologicals requi red elements. While it is strongly  recommended 
that this model I CF is to be followed as closely  as possible, the informed consent 
requirements given in this document are not intended to pre- empt an y local regulations 
which require additional information to be disclosed for informed consent to be legall y 
effective. Clinical judgement, local regulations and requirements should guide the final 
structure and content of the local version of the ICF .
5.2. Subject identification and randomisation of treatment
5.2.1. Subject i dentification
Subject identification numbers will be assigned sequentially  to the subjects who se 
parent(s)/LAR(s) have consented to their participation in the study , according to the 
range of subject identification numbers allocated to each stud y centre.
5.2.2. Randomisation of treatment
[IP_ADDRESS]. Randomisation of supplies
The numbering of supplies will be performed at [COMPANY_004] Biologicals, using a block scheme 
randomisation in MATerial EXcellence (MATEX), a program developed for use in 
Statistical Analy sis Sy stem (SAS®) (Cary , NC, [LOCATION_003] ) by [CONTACT_43055] . Entire blocks 
will be shipped to the study  centres /warehouse(s).
To allow [COMPANY_004] Biologicals to take advantage of greater rates of recruitment than 
anticipated at individual centres in this multi-centre study  and to thus reduce the overall 
study  recruitment period, an over- randomisatio n of supplies will be prepared.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment allocation to the su bject
The treatment numbers will be allocated b y dose.
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Study group and treatment number allocation
The target will be to enrol 1600 eligible subjects who will be randomly  assigned to four 
study  groups in a 1:1: 1: 1 ratio (approximately  400 subjects in ea ch group).
Allocation of the subject to a study  group at the investigator s ite will be performed using 
SBIR. The randomisation algorithm will use a minimisation procedure accounting for

5.3. Method of blinding 
This study  is observer -blind ( double blind for the three lots of PCV -free HRV liquid 
vaccine and observer -blind for the liquid formulation versus the ly ophilised formulation ).
Data will be collected in an obse rver-blind manner. By  [CONTACT_43049]-blind, it is meant that 
during the course of the study , the vaccines recipi[INVESTIGATOR_42973] y stud y endpoint (e.g. , safet y and reactogenicity) will all be unaware of 
which vaccine was administered. To do so, vaccine preparation and administration will 
be done b y authorised medical personnel who will not participate in an y of the study 
clinical evaluation assay s.
The laboratory  in charge of the laboratory  testing will be blinded to the t reatment, and 
codes will be used to link the subject and stud y (without any link to the treatment 
attributed to the subject) to each sample.
5.4. General study  aspects
Supplementary  study  conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is 
provided in the accompany ing SPM. The SPM provides the investigator and the site

Samples will not be labelled with information that directly  identifies the subject but will 
be coded with the identification number for the subject (subject number).
Collected samples will be used for protocol mandated research and purposes related 
to the improvement, development and quality  assurance of the laboratory  tests 
described in this pro tocol. This may  include the management of the quality  of these 
tests, the maintenance or improvement of these tests, the development of new test 
methods, as well as making sure that new tests are comparable to previous methods 
and work reliably .
It is also possible that future findings may  make it desirable to use the samples 
acquired in this study  for future research, not described in this protocol. Therefore, 
all subjects/subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) in countries where this is allowed will be 
asked to give specific consent to allow [COMPANY_004] or a contracted partner to use the 
samples for future research. Future research will be subject to the laws and 
regulations in the respective countries andwill only  be performed once an 
independent Ethics Committee or Review Board has approved this research.
Information on further investigations and their rationale can be obtained from [COMPANY_004] 
Biologicals. 
Any sample testing will be done in line with the consent of the individual 
subject/subject’s parent(s)/L AR(s).
Refer also to the Investigator Agreement , where it is noted that the investigator cannot 
perform an y other biological assay s except th ose described in the protocol or its 
amendment(s). 
Collected samples will be stored for a maximum of 20 y ears (counting from when the last 
subject performed the last study  visit), unless local rules, regulations or guidelines require 
different timeframes or different procedures, which will then be in line with the subject 
consent. These extra requirements need to be communicated formall y to and discussed

When materials are provided by [CONTACT_43055], it is MANDATORY that all clinical 
samples (including serum samples) be collected and stored exclusively  using those 
materials in the appropriate manner. The use of other materials could result in the 
exclusion of the subject from the PPS analy sis (See Section 10.4 for the definition of sets
to be anal ysed). The investigator must ensure that his/her personnel and the 
laboratory (ies) under his/her supervision compl y with this requirement. However, when 
[COMPANY_004] Biologicals does not provide material for collecting and storing clinical samples, 
appropriate materials from the investigator’s site must be used. Refer to the Module on

In order to allow the swallowing of the entire volum e of the single oral dose (of liquid or 
lyophilised formulation) , the administration should occur in a quiet environment. The 
child should be seated in a reclining position. Administer orally  (i.e., into the child’s 
mouth towards the inner cheek) the entire content of oral applicator. Sufficient time 
should be allowed for the baby [CONTACT_599682], to avoid regurgitation or 
vomiting. Should however the subject regurgitate or vomit after stud y vaccine 
administration, no new study  vacc ine dose should be administered. This information 
should be recorded in the eCRF. The subject may  continue to participate in the study .

6.4. Replacement of unusable vaccine doses
In addition to the vaccine doses provided for the planned number of subjects (including 
over-randomisation when applicable), at least 30% additional vaccine doses will be 
supplied to replace those that are unusable. 
The investigator will use SBI R to obtain the replacement treatment number. The 
replacement numbers will be allocated b y dose. The sy stem will ensure, in a blinded 
manner, that the replacement applicator matches the formulation the subject was assigned 
to by  [CONTACT_17975].
6.5. Contraindications to subsequent vaccination
The following events constitute absolute contraindications to further administration of 
Rotarix vaccine . If any of these events occur during the stud y, the subject must not 
receive additional doses of vaccines but may  continue other study  procedures at the 
discretion of the investigator (see Section 8.5). 
Anaph ylaxis following the administration of vaccines
Hypersensitivity  reaction following the administration of the HRV vaccine.
Any uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract (such as 
Meckel’s diverticulum ) that would predispose for IS.
Any history  of IS.
SCID.
The following events constitute contraindications to administration of Rotarix vaccine at 
that point in time; if any  of these events occur at the time scheduled for vaccination, the 
subject may  be vaccinated at a later date, within the time window specified in the 
protocol (see Section 5.5), or withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator (see Section 
8.5).

Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_130229]) without fever may  be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator .
GE within 7 day s preceding the study  vaccine administration.
6.6. Warnings and precautions
The HRV vaccine should under no circumstances be injected.
There are no data on the safet y and efficacy of Rotarix in infants with gastrointestinal 
illnesses. Administration of Rotarix may be considered with caution in such infants when, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_156700], withholding the vaccine entails a greater ri sk.
The risk of IShas been evaluated in a large safet y trial (including 63,225 infants) 
conducted in Latin America and Finland. No increased risk of ISwas observed in this 
clinical trial following administration of Rotarix when compared with placebo.
However, post -marketing safet y data indicate a transient increased risk of ISafter 
vaccination, mostly  within 8days following the administration of the first dose of Rotarix
and, to a lesser extent, the second dose. The overall incidence of IS remains ra re. 
Whether Rotarix affects the overall risk of IShas not been established.
Therefore, parent (s)/LAR(s)should be advised to promptly  report an y symptoms 
indicative of IS(severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bloody  stools, abdominal 
bloating and/or high fever).
Excretion of the vaccine virus in the stools is known to occur after vaccination and lasts 
for [ADDRESS_793920] been 
observed without causing any  clinical s ymptoms. Rotarix should be administered with 
caution to individuals with immunodeficient close contacts, such as individuals with 
malignancies, or who are otherwise immunocompromi sed or receiving 
immunosuppressive therapy. Contacts of recent vaccine es should be advised to observe 
careful hy giene ( including wash ingtheir hands) when changing child ren’s diaper s.
The tip caps of the prefilled oral applicators of diluent may  contain natural rubber latex 
which may  cause allergic reactions in individuals who are sensitive to latex .

An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease ( new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with 
the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. ,lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse. 
Examples of an AE include:
Significant or un expected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication 
under study .
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed a fter stud y vaccines administration even 
though they  may  have been present prior to the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
vaccines or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an 
AE/SAE).
Signs, sy mptoms temporally  associated with study  vaccines administration.
Significant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action. 
Pre-or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol- mandated procedures 
(i.e.,invasive procedures, modification of subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).
AEs to be recorded as endpoints (solicited AEs) are described in Section 8.1.3 . All other 
AEs will be recorded as UNSOLI CITED AEs.
Examples of an AE DO NOT include:
Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. ,endoscop y, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. ,social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], admission for routine examination).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.

8.1.2. Definition of a serious adverse event 
A SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that:
a.Results in death,
b.Is life -threatening,
Note: The term ‘life- threate ning’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, had it been more severe.
c.Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574],
Note: I n general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599657]/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or in a n out -patient setting. Complications 
that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_301877]. If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599658], the event will also be considered 
serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]’ occurred or was necessary , the 
AE should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31782] a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is 
NOT considered an AE .
d.Results in disability /incapacity , OR
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g. ,sprained 
ankle) which may  interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.
Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599659]. These should also be considered serious. 
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for aller gic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956].

09-MAR -2017 67The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the stud y. The assessment 
will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgement.
The intensity  should be assigned to one of the following categories:
1 (mild) =An AE which is easil y tolerated b y the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities.
2 (moderate) =An AE which is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with 
normal every day activities.
3 (severe) =An AE which prevents normal, every day activities 
(in a y oung child, such an AE would, for example, prevent 
attendance at day -care centre and would cause the 
parent(s)/LAR(s) to seek medical advice.)
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category  used for rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it mee ts one of the pre -
defined outcomes as described in Section 8.1.2.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Assessment of causality
The definitions for ‘NO’ and ‘YES’ have been written in s uch a way  that all events that 
have been attributed a ‘NO’ can be pooled with events which in the primary vaccination 
study  were determined to be ‘not related’ or ‘unlikely  to be related’ to vaccination. Those 
events that are attributed a ‘YES’ can be pooled with those events that in the past were 
determined to have a ‘suspected’ or ‘probable’ relationship to vaccination in the primary  
vaccination stud y.
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational vaccine 
and the occurre nce of each AE/SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgement to 
determine the relationship. Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history  of the 
underly ing diseases, concomitant therapy , other risk factors, and the temporal 
relationship of the event to the investigational vaccine will be considered and 
investigated. The investigator will also consult the IB and/or Prescribing Information for 
marketed products to determine his/her assessment.
There may  be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals. However, it is very  
important that the investigator alway s makes an assessment of causality  for every  event 
prior to submission of the Expedited Adverse Events Report to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals. The 
investigator may  change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_19954] -up information and 
update the SAE information accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the crite ria 
used when determining regulatory  reporting requirements

09-MAR -2017 68In case of concomitant administration of multiple vaccines/products, it may not be 
possible to determine the causal relationship of general AEs to the individual vaccine 
administered. The investig ator should, therefore, assess whether the AE could be causall y 
related to vaccination rather than to the individual vaccines.
All solicited local (injection site) reactions will be considered causall y related to 
vaccination. Causalit y of all other AEs sho uld be assessed by  [CONTACT_159290]:
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_106365]?
YES :There is a reasonable possibility  that the vaccines contributed to the 
AE. 
NO :There is no r easonable possibility  that the AE is causally  related to 
the administration of the study  vaccines. There are other, more 
likely  causes and administration of the study  vaccines is not 
suspected to have contributed to the AE.
If an event meets the criteria to be determined as ‘serious’ (see Section 8.1.2 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed b y the investigat or in order to determine ALL 
possible contributing factors for each SAE.
Possible contributing factors include:
Medical history .
Other medication.
Protocol required procedure.
Other procedure not required by  [CONTACT_760].
Lack of efficacy  of the vaccines, if applicable.
Erroneous administration.
Other cause (specify ).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of outcomes
The investigator will assess the outcome of all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) 
recorded during the study  as:
Recovered/resolved.
Recovering/resolving.
Not recovered/no t resolved.
Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae.
Fatal (SAEs onl y).

[COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ policy  (which incorporates ICH E2A guidance, EU Clinical Trial 
Directive and US Federal Regulations) is to unblind the report of an y SAE which is 
unexpected and at tributable/suspected to be attributable to the investigational vaccines, 
prior to regulatory  reporting. The [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ Central Safet y Physician is 
responsible for unblinding the treatment assignment in accordance with the specified 
timeframes for exp edited reporting of SAEs (refer to Section 8.4.1).
8.8. Emergency  unblinding (Amended: 06 September 2016)
Unblinding of a subject’s individual treatment code should occur onl y in the case of a 
medical emergency , or in the event of a serious medical condition, when knowledge of 
the treatment is essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject, as judged 
by[CONTACT_093].
The emergency  unblinding process consists of the automated sy stem SBIR that allows the 
investigator to have unrestricted, immediate and direct access to the subject’s individual 
study  treatment.
The investigator has the option of contact [CONTACT_30697] a [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ On -call Central Safet y 
Physician (or Backup) if he/she needs medical advice or needs the support of [COMPANY_004] to 
perform the unblinding (i.e., he/she cannot access the automated Internet- based s ystem).
Any emergency  unblinding must be full y documented by [CONTACT_43086], which must be appropriatel y completed by  [CONTACT_489755] 24 hours to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals.

From an anal ysis perspective, a ‘withdrawal’ from the study  refers to any  subject who 
was not available for the concludin g contact [CONTACT_91313]. 
All data collected until the date of withdrawal/last contact [CONTACT_43092].
A subject is considered a ‘withdrawal’ from the study  when no study  procedure has 
occurred, no follow -up has bee n performed and no further information has been collected 
for this subject from the date of withdrawal/last contact.
Investigators will make an attempt to contact [CONTACT_348614] -up. 
Information relative to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator 
will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the stud y was made b y 
the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s), or b y the investigator, as well as which of the following 
possible reasons w as responsible for withdrawal:
Serious adverse event.
Non-serious adverse event.
Protocol violation (specify ).
Consent withdrawal, not due to an adverse event*.
Moved from the stud y area.
Lost to follow -up.
Other (specify ).
*In case a subject is withdrawn from the study  because the subject’s parent(s)/L AR(s) 
has withdrawn consent, the investigator will document the reason for withdrawal of 
consent, if specified b y the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s), in the eCRF .
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study  because of SAEs/AEs must be clearl y 
distinguished from subjects who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will 
follow subjects who are withdrawn from the study  as result of a SAE/AE until resolution 
of the event (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).

NI on Seroconversion rate: Ty pe II error was obtained using PASS [ADDRESS_793933] for 2 proportions, under the alternative of equal proportions
(Miettinen and Nurminen’s L ikelihood Score Test of the Difference) .
NI on GMC: Ty pe II error wa s obtained using PASS 2005, one -sided non- inferiorit y

The exact CI s for a proportion within a group will be calculated using SAS [ Clopper , 
1934].
The standardized as ymptotic CI  for the group difference in proportion will be 
calculated using SAS. T he method used within [COMPANY_004] Biologicals is Method 6
[Newcombe , 1998].
The CI for GMCs will be obtained within each group separately . The CI for the 
mean of log -transformed concentration will be first obtained assuming that log -
transformed values were normally  distributed with unknown variance. The CI  for the 
GMCs will then be obtained by  [CONTACT_159306] -transformation of the CI for the mean of 
log-transformed concentration.
The GMC group ratio will be obtained using an ANOVA model on the logarithm -
transformed concentrations. The ANOVA model will include the vaccine group and 
the country  as fixed effects. The GMC ratio and their 95% CI will be derived by  
[CONTACT_159306] -transformation of the corresponding group contrast in the model.

An unap proved medical device incident is any malfunction or deterioration in the 
characteristics and/or performance of a device as well as any inadequacy in the 
instructions for use ,which, directly or indirectly, may lead to or might have led to 
the death of a participant/user/other person or to a serious deterioration in his/her 
state of health.
Not all incidents lead to death or serious deterioration in health. The non -
occurrence of such a result may be due to other fortunate circumstances or due to 
the interve ntion of health care personnel. 
It is sufficient that:
An incident associated wi th an unapproved device happens and the incident is 
such that, if it occurs again, may lead to death or a serious deterioration in health.
A serious deterioration in state of health can include any of the following:
life-threatening illness ;
permanent impairment of body function or permanent damage to body structure ;
condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
above ;
foetal distress, foetal death, or any congenital abnormality or birth defects .
Examples of incidents are:
A participant, user, caregiver, or healthcare professional is injured as a result of 
an unapproved medical device failure or its misuse.
A participant’s study treatment is i nterrupted or compromised by [CONTACT_599689]. 
A misdiagnosis due to unapproved medical device failure leads to inappropriate 
treatment. 
A participant’s health deteriorates due to unapproved medical device failure.

Serum Analysis
The anti -rotavirus antibody  concentrations are determined by  a validated anti -rotavirus 
IgA ELISA. Microtitre plates (96- well) are coated with an a nti-rotavirus monoclonal 
antibody . The wells are washed and incubated with (positive well s) or without (negative 
wells) r otavirus. Following incubation, the plates are washed and serum, standard and 
control dilutions are incubated in both ty pes of wells (positive and negative). Bound 
anti-rotavirus IgA in the well are detected b y incubation with peroxidase conjugated 
anti-human IgA pol yclonal antibodies. Colo ur development proportional to the quantity 
of bound anti -rotavirus IgA occurs in the presence of a chromogen, TMB 
(TetraMethy lBenzidine), and measured spectrophotometrically. Specific optical densities
are calculated for each sample/ control /standard dilut ion by  [CONTACT_599693], the use of negati ve wells allowing to assess 
non-specific IgA binding. The c oncentrations of the samples expressed in units per 
millilitre are calculated relative to the four -parameter lo gistic function generated from the 
standard curve.
Antigen Detection in Stool Samples
The r otavirus antigen in stool samples collected during GEepi[INVESTIGATOR_599662] b y 
ELISA at Central Lab ([COMPANY_004] or designated laboratory ).
RV strain genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_599663]. In order 
to determine the rotavirus P and G ty pe, VP4 and VP7 genes will be then amplified by  
[CONTACT_599694] (RT -PCR) using two separate primer sets. 
VP4 and VP7 amplimers will be further anal ysed by  [CONTACT_362236]. The sequences 
will be interpreted using BLAST database searches in Genbank and ph ylogenetic 
analysis.

The burden of the study for the subject will be minimised as much as possible. For 
taking blood samples, three attempts at most should be performed. If the physician is not successful after the third attempt, he/she will make no further attempts. A local numbing cream or patch will also be offered at the discretion of the investigator prior to blood sampling, in order to minimise pain when blood samples are drawn.

Section 10.10.1 Sequence of analyses has been modified as shown below:
Safety  data that is as clean as possible will be analy sed for IDMC review. Detail sof the 
review will be described in an IDM C charter.
An anal ysis will be conducted once all the study  data up to Visit [ADDRESS_793949] -dose 2 has been fully  completed.
The Clinical Study  Report ( CSR) with data up to Visit 3 will be used for the registration 
of PCV -free liquid vaccine in European Union ( EU)and ‘rest of world’ countries. This 
CSR will be submitted as soon as it is availab le (without waiting for the safety  follow -
up data) since safet y follow -up is not requested in EU and ‘rest of world’ countries, in 
order to accelerate the launch of PCV -free vaccine.
In addition, a n integrated clinical study  report containing all data will be written and 
made available to the investigators and submitted to regulatory  authorities as 
appropriate, e.g., for licensure of PCV -free liquid vaccine in US . This report will 
include the following:
An anal ysis of the s erum anti -RV IgA antibod y concentrations , 1-2 months after
Dose 2 in the ly ophilised and pooled liq uid groups .
The reactogenicit y and safety analysis of SAEs and AEs leading to drop out 
reported after Visit [ADDRESS_793950].
The final analy ses of all data conducted after conclusion of the safet y follow -up 
phase.
This report will also summarize all the SAEs reported from Visit [ADDRESS_793951] to account for the SAEs not reported in the earlier study  repor t due to 
late reporting of SAEs.
The safet y follow -up data will be needed for licensure in US and thus the integrated 
clinical study  report will be submitted in US.

An unapproved medical device incident is any malfunction or deterioration in 
the characteristics and/or performance of a device as well as any inadequacy in 
the instructions for use, which, directly or indirectly, may lead to or might have 
led to the death of a participant/user/other person or to a serious deterior ation in 
his/her state of health.
Not all incidents lead to death or serious deterioration in health. The non -
occurrence of such a result may be due to other fortunate circumstances or due 
to the intervention of health care personnel.
It is sufficient that:
An incident associated with an unapproved device happens and the incident is 
such that, if it occurs again, may lead to death or a serious deterioration in 
health.
A serious deterioration in state of health can include any of the following:
life-threate ning illness;
permanent impairment of body function or permanent damage to body 
structure;
condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
above;
foetal distress, foetal death, or any congenital abnormality or birth defects.
Examples of incidents are:
A participant, user, caregiver, or healthcare professional is injured as a result of 
an unapproved medical device failure or its misuse.
A participant’s study treatment is interrupted or compromised by [CONTACT_599696]. 
A misdiagnosis due to unapproved medical device failure leads to inappropriate 
treatment. 
A participant’s health deteriorates due to unapproved medical device failure.

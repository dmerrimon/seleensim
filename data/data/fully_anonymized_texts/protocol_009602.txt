[INVESTIGATOR_23207] s: Multi -centre trial planned to be conducted in multiple countries
Clinical phase: III
Objective s: The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of once daily oral doses of empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg 
in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM )as adjunctive to insulin therapy
Methodology: Randomised, double- blind, placebo -controlled parallel group comparison of 2 oral 
once daily doses (10 mg and 25 mg) of empagliflozin to placebo.  Randomisation 
will be stratified by :
pre-existing insulin therapy ( multiple daily injections [MDI ]vs continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII ])
Visit 5 estimated Glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR )as calculated by [CONTACT_285088][INVESTIGATOR_10444] (CKD -EPI) formula (< 
60 mL/min/1.73 m2vs ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2)

Endpoints Primary endpoint is the change from baseline in HbA 1cafter 26 w eeks
Key secondary endpoints are:
incidence rate of symptomatic hypoglycaemi c AEs with confirmed plasma 
glucose < 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 mmol/L) and /orsevere hypoglycaemi c AEs per 
patient -year from week 5 to week 26  
osevere hypo glycaemic AEs are defined as event srequiring the 
assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate,

may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery 
follow ing the return of plasma glucose to normal is considered 
sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma 
glucose concentration

Statistical m ethods: For the primary endpoint, change from baseline in HbA 1cafter [ADDRESS_417620] model for repeated measures
(MMRM) analysis will be used to obtain adjusted means for the treatment effects.  
This model w ill include treatment, w eek and pre -existing i nsulin therapy as discrete 
fixed effects, baseline eGFR ( CKD -EPI) and baseline HbA 1cas continuous fixed 
effects, as well as the interaction betw een week and treatment and theinteraction 
betw een week and baseline HbA 1c.  The primary treatment comparisons will be the 
Bonferroni adjusted contrast betw een each dose of empagliflozin and placebo at 
week 26.   The doses of empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg will therefore be tested at the 
level of α=0.025 (tw o-sided).
The primary analysis will be an efficacy analysis, including on -treatment data only. 
Follow ing the efficacy analysis, an effectiveness analysis (on -and off- treatment 
data) w ill be performed in a hierarchical manner. If the null hypothesis is rejected 
forboth the efficacy and effectiveness analysis then the key secondary endpoints 
will be tested in a confirmatory way using a gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_120229], w ith unequal 
splitting of the alpha, and sequential testing. 
The key secondary endpoint sof change from base line in body weight after 26 
weeks and change from baseline in TDID will be analysed using a similar model to 
the analysis of the primary endpoint, w ith the addition of baseline and interaction 
betw een baseline and week for the respective endpoint .
The ke y secondary endpoint sof change from baseline in the percentage of time 
spent in target glucose range of >70to ≤180 mg/dL ( >3.9to ≤10.0 mmol/L) as 
determined by [CONTACT_337991] 23 to 26 and change from baseline in IQR as 
determined by [CONTACT_337991] 23 to 26will be analysed using analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA), with terms for treatment, pre -existing insulin therapy, 
continuous baseline HbA 1c, continuous baseline eGFR and continuous baseline of 
the respective CGM endpoint .
The key secondary endpoint of incidence rate of symptomatic hypoglycaemi c AEs
with confirmed plasma glucose < 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 mmol/L) and/orsevere 
hypoglycaemi c AEs from week 5 toweek 26 will be analysed using a negative 
binomial model.  The model will include treatment and pre -existi ng insulin therapy

as discrete fixed effects, baseline rate ,baseline HbA 1cand baseline eGFR as 
continuous fixed effects and log arithm of days of exposure as an offset.  The 
primary treatment comparisons will be the rate ratios comparing the incidence rates 
per-patient year from week 5 to week 26 on each dose of empagliflozin to placebo.
The same analysis strategy will be applied for the key secondary endpoint of 
incidence rate of symptomatic hypoglycaemi c AEs with confirmed plasma glucose 
< 54 mg/dL ( < 3.0 mmol/L) and/orsevere hypoglycaemi c AEs from Week 1 to
Week 26.
The key secondary endpoints of change from baseline in SBP and DBP after 26 
weeks will be analysed using a similar model to the analysis of the primary 
endpoint, with the addition of terms for baseline and interaction betw een baseline 
and weekforthe respective endpoint.

supply of medication until the next visit.  For further details see Section 6.1
B The patient’s therapy for T1DM (e.g. ability to review blood glucose values, skills for carbohydrate estimation and insulin adjustment) should be optimised from Visit 2 for 
a period of 6weeks (i.e. until the patient reaches Visit 5 and the placebo run -in period) to achieve the best standard of care in accordance with local guideli nes.  This 
optimal therapy should then be continued from Visit 5for eligible patients.  For further details see Section 4.2.1
C During the T1DM therapy optimisation period, and daily for 5 days following clinic Visit 6, data fro m the electronic (e)-diary should be reviewed remotely by [CONTACT_116008], paying particular attention to adjustments in the insulin regimen, glucose values and, if available, ketone m easurements.  In addition, the patient should be 
contact[CONTACT_5143] ( e.g. weekly during the T1DM therapy optimisation period) if e -diary data, including glucose data, is not available and/or if the data suggests closer 
monitoring of the patient is required.  Additional clinic visits can also be arranged if necess ary.  For further details see Sections 5.2.3 and 6.2.1
D Visit 4T is a telephone visit .  Visit 3 can be a telephone visit (3T),if deemed sufficient based on Investigator judgement ,or a clinic visit; i fperformed as a telephone visit, 
assessments in brackets in the Flow Chart do not have to be performed
E  
F Following randomisation and prior to the initiation of study medication, Investigators are advised to reduce the patient’s total insulin dose based on need/ by10% to avoid 
hypoglycaemia; thereafter further insulin adjustments may be implemented as necessar y.  For further details see Section 4.2.1
G An early End of Treatment (eEOT) Visit, as well as a Follow -up Visit 1 7, should be performed for any patient who discontinues study medication prematurely; the eEOT 
Visit should be completed as soon as possible after study medication is stopped.  PK sampling can be omitted if the eEOT Visit is not performed w ithin [ADDRESS_417626] 
dose of study medication; the 8-point plasma glucose profile should only be performed if it is feasible for it to be done over a 24 hour period before the eEOT V isit when 
study medication is still being taken; otherwise it can be omitted.  Visit 1 7 should be performed 3 weeks after the eEOT visit, and where possible, patients should then be 
followed up accor ding to the visit schedule.  For further details see Section 6.2.3
H NF: non -fasting; F: fasting
J Following the termination of trial medication, and if deemed necessary based on Investigator’s judgement, additional support (e.g. telephone interaction) can be given to 
the patient during the adjustment of T1DM therapy in the Follow -up period  
K Safety laboratory includes calculation of the eGFR.  Following a positive urine dipstick result (at the site) for leukocyte e sterase (for WBC) or nitrite, a midstream urine 
sample for urine culture is triggered.  For further details see Section 5.3.3
L For female patients of child -bearing potential (local urine pregnancy test)
M  
 
 
 
Q Home monitoring device: meter for monitoring of blood (plasma) glucose and ketone levels at home
R Self-Blood Glucose Monitoring (SBGM) should be performed daily from the beginning of th e T1DM therapy optimisation period to the end of the Follow-up period.  
Measurements should be taken [ADDRESS_417627], lunch, dinner and bedtime.  Additional measurements will also be warranted (e.g. 
after clinic Vi sit 6).  For further details see Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Ketone measurements should be performed by [CONTACT_337992].  Other conditions 
may also trigger the need for ketone measurement.  For further details seeFootnote AA andSection [IP_ADDRESS]
S Patients should be trained in the correct use of the CGM device, including sensor exchange, before it is dispensed for the fi rst CGM period at Visit 5.  Refresher tr aining 
should be provided at Visit s 11and15 as appropriate.  A change of CGM sensor is required every 7 days within each monitoring period.  The patient should change the 
sensor at home on days where a sensor change is due but where a clinic visit is not scheduled.  For f urther details see Sections 5.2.5 and 6.1

U For the scre ening visit (Visit 1) an abbreviated, safety laboratory and urinalysis will be performed as follows: liver transaminases, alk aline phosphatase, serum creatinine, 
TSH, and urinalysis.  For further details see Section 5.3.3
V At Vi sits 6, 12, 16, eEOT (if applicable) and 1 7 only, the safety laboratory testing will include lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].  Samples should be obtained from the patient in a fasting state.  For 
further details see Section 5.3.3
W  
Y For Visit 2, an abbreviated safety laboratory (fasting) will be performed as follows: C -peptide only.  For further details see Section 5.3.3
Z If a country is not participating in the CGM assessment, it is not necessary for their patients to attend for Visits 11 and 1 5 and these visits can be skipped.  For further 
details see Sections 5.2.5 and [IP_ADDRESS]
AA Blood ketone measurements must be performed at the site using the home monitoring device.  At visits where such measurements are reque sted and a fasted safety 
laboratory is also part of that visit (i.e. Visits 2, 6, 9, 12, 14, 16/eEOT [if applicable] and 17), the measurements should be done directly before or directly after the 
collection of laboratory samples and also in a fasted state.  At visits with a non-fasting safety laboratory or without a safety laboratory assessment (i.e. Visits 3, 5, 7, 8, 10 
and 13) measurements can be done non -fasted.   Regular (e.g. 2 - 3 times a week) measurements at home before breakfast are recommended throu ghout the trial from Visit 2.  
More frequent (e.g. once daily) measurements are recommended during the run -in period and during the first 4 weeks of the treatment period.  For further details see

MEDICAL BACKGROUND 1.1
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM )accounts for 5 to 10% of all cases of diabetes mellitus. 
This disease isa complex disorder that requires constant attention to diet, exercise, glucose 
monitoring, and insulin therap y to achieve good gly caemic control .  T1DM occurs as a 
consequence of the organ -specific immune destruction of the pancreas’ insulin -producing β -
cells in the islets of Langerhans [R10-6370, R10 -6371
].
Controlling blood glucose in T1DM leads to improved patient outcomes [ R04-2186, R12-
1489 ]. For this reason, several medical associations have given treatment rec ommendations 
for T1DM [P13-[ZIP_CODE], R12-4773] including gl ycaemic goals. Most bodies recommend that 
adult patients with T1DM should obtain gly cated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) ≤ 7.0%. However, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_337946] , such as the development of continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) systems, refinement of pharmacokinetic (PK) properties 
of rapid -and long -acting insulin analogues ,and the use of continuous glucose monitor ing 
(CGM) sy stems, current therapy  for patients with diabetes requiring insulin often does not 
lead to satisfactory  glycaemic control. In fact, only a minor portion of patients achieve 
normali sation of HbA 1cand restoration of eugl ycaemia. Most patients generall y achieve 
HbA 1clevels no lower than 8.0%. Hence, with the currently available treatment options, 
patients with T1DM often fail to maintain adequate blood glucose control. This may  not onl y 
lead to acute conditions such as h ypergl ycaemia and keto
acidosis, but may  also lead to 
debilitating secondary  complications including heart disease, blindness and kidney  failure
[R10-6369
].In addition, inadvertent excessive administration of insulin may also contribute 
to acute conditions such as severe hy poglycaemia .
Empagliflozin is a reversible, highl y potent (IC 501.3 nM) and selective competitive inhibitor 
of sodium- glucose co- transporter 2 (SGLT -2),a member of a larger group of sodium 
substrate co- transporters, the sodium -glucose co- transport 5 (SL C5) gene family  [R05-
0939]. 
Under normogl ycaemia, glucose is completel y reabsorbed b y SGLTs in the kidney, whereas 
the reuptake capacit y of the kidney  is saturated at plasma glucose concentrations hig her than 
approximately  10-11 mmol/L , resulting in glucosuria. Th is threshold concentration can be 
decreased b y SGLT -2inhibition [c01678844]; an approximately  5000- fold selectivity  over 
human SGL T-1 (IC 506278 nM ), responsible for glucose absorption in the gut, was calculated 
forempagliflozin [U06-1742].  
It was demonstrated, nearly  four decades ago, that in patients with poorly  controlled T1DM, 
the maximum tubular reabsorption capacit y for glucos e was significantly  increased, whereas 
one would in fact have suspected that during h ypergly caemia, with increased interstitial and 
intracellular glucose concentrations, the reduced glucose concentration gradient across the 
basolateral membrane of the prox imal renal epi[INVESTIGATOR_337947]
[R10-6572]. This paradoxically  increased glucose reabsorption in T1DM could be explained 
by [CONTACT_79959] -regulation of glucose transporters, including SGLT -2 which was shown in tubular 
cells cultured from patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) [R10-0703 ]. The 
phenomenon of an increased reabsorption of glucose when glucose concentration is elevated 
Boehringer Ingelheim 04 Jan 2017

Trial Protocol Version 3.0 Page 19of 144
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_417641]-03(11.0)/Saved on:24Jul2014could there fore be considered a maladapted response to glucosuria in diabetes, since it would 
rather be desirable for the kidney  to excrete the excess filtered glucose load in order to restore 
normogl ycaemia [P11-[ZIP_CODE]]. 
Based on these pathoph ysiological considerations , it follows that empagliflozin has the 
potential to provide a novel approach to the treatment of T1DM, as adjunctive therap y to 
insulin.  Empagliflozin lowers both the saturation threshold and the transport maximum of 
SGL T-2 for glucose, resulting in increased glucosuria, insulin -independent reduction of 
plasma glucose levels with potentially  low risk of hy poglycaemia, and negative energy  
balance with potential weight reduction in T1DM.  
DRUG PROFILE 1.2
Empagliflozin is a novel, orally  available , potent, and selective inhibitor of the renal SGLT -2.  
Its selective inhibition reduces renal reabsorption of glucose and promotes increased urinary 
glucose excretion (UGE) resulting in reduction of blood glucose 
levels.
Empagliflozin has been develop ed for the treatment of T2DM, and has received marketing 
approval in various regions including the European Union and the [LOCATION_003] where i t is marketed 
under the brand name [CONTACT_15648]®.  
1.2.1 Non-clinical assessment of safety
For further information regarding pre -clinical evaluation, please refer to the current version 
of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for empagliflozin [ c01678844
].
1.2.2 Clinical pharmacokinetics
Clinical pharmacokinetics – Type 2 diabetes mellitus [IP_ADDRESS]
In humans, empagliflozin predominantly showed linear PK.  Empagliflozin reaches peak 
levels at approximately  1.5 hours and showed a biphasic decline with the terminal elimination 
half-life of 12.4 hours ranging from 10 to 19 hours.
Empagliflozin exposure increases with renal or hepatic impairment; however, no dose 
adjustment is recommended as the observed changes in exposure were not clinically  
meaningful.  The observations from a Phase I study  in patients with renal impairment indicate 
a rather low gly caemic efficacy  of empagliflozin in patients with severe renal impairment and 
end-stage renal disease, while efficacy  is assumed to be unchanged with hepatic impairment.
No clinically  relevant PK interactions were observed with other oral antidiabetics, warfarin, 
verapamil, ramipril, simvastatin, digoxin, hy drochlorothiazide, torasemide, gemfibrozil, 
rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], probenecid and oral contraceptives (Microgy non®).

1.2.3 Clinical efficacy and safety
Clinical efficacy and safety  –Type 2 diabetes mellitus [IP_ADDRESS]
Empagliflozin has been studied as part of a global development program with [ADDRESS_417644], dipeptidy l 
peptidase -4 inhibitors, or insulin.
The Phase III studies in T2DM showed that treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg 
once dail y for up to 24 weeks results in a reduction of HbA 1cup to 0.85%, body  weight up to 
2.2kg and s ystolic blood p ressure (SBP) up to 4.8 mmHg compared with placebo.  This was 
consistently  observed with empagliflozin as monotherapy , add on to metformin, to metformin 
and sulphony lurea, to pi[INVESTIGATOR_23213], and to basal insulin with 
metformin and/o r sulphony lurea.  Phase III studies up to [ADDRESS_417645] of empagliflozin.  
In clinical studies, empagliflozin was well tolerated in both normal healthy  volunteers and 
patients with T2DM up to maximal treatment duration of 104 weeks in completed studies.  
The frequency  of overall Adverse Events (AEs), AEs leading to discontinuation and Serious 
AE (SAEs) were comparable to placebo.  There was no significant increase in frequency  of 
hypoglycaemia with empagliflozin compared t o placebo except when used in combination 
with a sulphony lurea or basal insulin.  I n general there was a small increase in frequency  of 
urinary  tract infection (UTI) compared to placebo.  There was an increase in frequency  of 
genital infections with the us e of empagliflozin.  There was a small increase in total 
cholesterol, low -densit y lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high -densit y lipoprotein (HDL) 
cholesterol and no significant changes in trigl ycerides.  No changes in electroly tes were 
observed with empag liflozin.  There was a reduction in eGFR which gradually  returned 
toward baseline values over the treatment period in the trials.  Furthermore, eGFR returned to 
baseline when empagliflozin was discontinued.  In a dedicated study  in patients with 
moderate r enal impairment (eGFR between 30 -60 mL /min/1.73 m2) treatment with 
empagliflozin was well tolerated and led to statistically significant reduction of HbA 1c and 
clinically  meaningful improvement in FPG (fasting plasma glucose), bod y weight and BP 
compared t o placebo at Week 24.  Similar results were sustained for up to 52 weeks

In summary , given the safety profile in the preclinical studies of empagliflozin , and the 
safet y, tolerabilit y and efficacy seen in the clinical study programs to date, the available 
clinical and non -clinical data support safe and efficacious use in humans and further 
development of empagliflozin in T1DM and T2DM.

ASSESSMENT
RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL 2.1
In an extensive Phase III program, empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg) wasshown to be safe 
and efficacious in the treatment of patients with T2DM and has received marketing approval 
in more than 30 countries including the EU and US. Due to its insulin -independent mode of 
action empagliflozin also has potential for use in the treatment of patients with T1DM.
   
 this 
Phase III trial is planned to confirm the efficacy  and safet y of empagliflozin in patients with 
T1DM and to further investigate tolerability  and PK.
TRIAL OBJECTIVES 2.2
The objective of this study  is to assess the efficacy ,safet y, tolerability and PK of once dail y 
oral doses of empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg compared to placebo in patients with T1DM as
adjunctive to insulin therapy .
BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT 2.3
A pharmacologic rationale for the use of empagliflozin in T1DM 
can be found in Section 1.1.  
The overall tolerability  and safet y profile outlined in Section 1.2,and the current IB ,supports 
chronic administration of empagl iflozin 10 mg and 25 mg in human studies.
According to the medication assignme nt planned in this trial, 66% of the patients will receive 
empagliflozin , and 33% of patients will be assigned to placebo.  For those assigned to 
empagliflozin, patients m aybenefit from positive gl ycaemic effects .  In addition to achieving 
better gly caemi c control, patients receiving empagliflozin are expected to benefit from a 
reduced number and intensity  of hy poglycaemic events due to a reduced need for 
insulin /reduced glucose excursions (since when using insulin only , its subcutaneous 
administration often leads to over- insulination u ltimately  causing hy pogly caemia ). 
Nevertheless, patients will be closely  monitored for hy poglycaemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_337948], and the frequency  of this monitoring will be adjusted in accordance with the anticipated 
risk (including night -time glucose measurements during the first day s after initiation of the 
study  medication). Patients assigned to 
both empagliflozin and placebo may alsoderive 
general medical benefit from careful and close monitoring b y medical personnel during the 
study .Placebo patients may  benefit from optimising the therapy  for T1DM as part of the 
T1DM therap y optimisation period.  
As part of the preparation for e ntry into the randomised treatment period, therapy  for T1DM 
will be optimised (e.g. review of blood glucose values, insulin dose and its adjustment for 
meals, ability  to carbohydrate count etc.) over a 6 week period (T1DM therapy  optimisation 
period) to ensure that, in the I nvestigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], a patient is achieving the best standard of 
care in accordance with local guidelines before entering the randomised treatment period of 
the trial.  This optimal therap y will then be continued, and at random isation, Investigators are

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_417649]-03(11.0)/Saved on:24Jul2014advised to reduce the patient’s total insulin dose based on need/ by 10% to minimise the risk 
for h ypoglycaemia. Since glomerular filtration is phy siologicall y decreased during epi[INVESTIGATOR_337949] h ypogl ycaemia (due to reduced renal blood flow hence leading to lowering of urine 
glucose excretion and therefore efficacy  of empagliflozin) , hypoglycaemia induced b y insulin 
is not expected to be significantly  aggravated by  [CONTACT_23342] [R12-4766 ].
Special attention will be paid to prevent T1DM -inherent DKA. Due to the mechanism of 
action, empagliflozin may  potentiall y modify the clinical presentation of DKA. Patients 
receiving empagliflozin may beat risk to underestimate their need for insulin if blood sugar 
levels are within individual target ranges or onl y slightly elevated. Insulin deficiency might 
lead to ketoacidosis which could be life -threatening if not recogni sed and appropriatel y 
treated. All patients will be made aware of this risk and be instructed no t to reduce their 
insulin dose below Investigator recommendations. In addition to blood glucose monitoring,
the frequency  of which will be increased after starting the study  medication (for further 
details see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), in the same way  as during routine clinical care, patients will be 
reminded how to determine ketone sin case of an y symptoms of DKA, e. g.nausea, vomiting ,
abdominal pain etc. They  will be instructed to do this irrespective of the glucose value in the 
event of DKA sy mptoms occurring.  More frequent ketone testing (e.g. once dail y) will be 
recommended during the run -in period and during the first 4 weeks of the treatment period; 
this will allow patients and I nvestigators to understand baseline ketosis rat es and compare 
them, as appropriate, to the incidence of ketosis following the initiation of study medication.  
A meter will be provided to the patient for this purpose ; as an additional safeguard, the meter 
will also be used to check ketone levels at most clinic visits (see Flow Chart) .  Patients will 
be reminded ofthe interpretation of ketone values measured by  [CONTACT_23271] , and on appropriate 
action to be taken in the event of increased ketone levels (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). In addition, 
patients will be reminded about insulin adjustment during “sick day s”and about the 
importance of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_337950] .
Investigators should also differentiate deteriorating ketosis/DKA from an y mild to moder ate 
increase of ketones which may  be seen due to the mechanism of action of empagliflozin, 
especiall y in the fasted state (e.g. in the morning).  See also Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Patients will be carefull y selected for the trial in line with the eligibility  criteria, to ensure, in 
the Investigator’s judgement, that they  have a good understanding of their disease and how to 
manage it .  They  should also be selected in terms of their ability  to be compliant with the 
demands of the trial .  This means, for example, that patients should be able to lead the 
optimisation of their T1DM therap y since they are judged to have sound self -management 
skills and approaches to insulin dose adjustment, and are reliable in terms of performing 
frequent h
ome testing of both glucose and ketones when required.
As with all drugs, the potential for h ypersensitivity and allergic reactions has to be taken into 
consideration when empagliflozin is administered. Other risks to the patients are the risks 
inherent to an y investigational medicinal product used in a clinical trial setting, such as 
unexpected adverse clinical or laboratory  events.

by [CONTACT_337993]. Therefore, this stud y requires timel y detection, evaluation, and 
follow -up of laboratory  alterations of selected liver laboratory  parameters to ensure patients’ 
safet y.
To continue the assessment of the long
-term safety of empagliflozin, an adjudication of 
certain hepatic events will be performed in this trial.  Furthermore, adjudication of 
cardiovascular events, severe h ypogl ycaemia and DKA will be performed.  The progress of 
the trial will also be assessed at regular intervals by  [CONTACT_105231] (DMC).  For further details please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
Based on the findings in non-clinical studies conducted to date, and in accordance with 
international regulatory  guidelines, the inclusion of women of child -bearing potential in this 
trial is justified.  To minimise the risk of unintentional exposure of an embryo or foetus to the 
investigational drug, women of child -bearing potential must agree to the requirements for 
pregnancy  testing and contrac eptive methods described in this protocol (for further details see 
Section 3.3.3).
Safety  will be carefull y assessed by [CONTACT_337994] , by [CONTACT_337995] b y blood glucose and ketone monitoring. The Investigator will have the 
discretion to remove patients from the study  should there be any  safety  conce rns or if the

in healthy  volunteers and patients with diabetes suggest that empagliflozin may  be able to 
provide a valuable be nefit to patients with T1DM. 
Given the positive risk- benefit ratio for empagliflozin to date, the careful selection of patients 
and their monitoring during the stud y, the blood glucose and ketone monitoring performed b y 
the patients at home and the opti on to adjust a patient’s insulin treatment , the S ponsor 
considers the 
benefit -risk assessment for the use of empagliflozin in T1DM patients in this 
trial to be favourable.

OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN 3.1
This multi- national, randomised, placebo -controlled, double -blind, parallel group stud y 
compares 2doses of empagliflozin (10mg and 25 mg) to placebo in patients with T1DM as 
adjunctive to insulin therapy .  In total, 720 patients with T1DM who meet the entry  criteria 
will be entered (randomi sed)in the trial. The randomised treatment will be double -
blind (i.e. 
each patient will take 2 tablets a day , receiv ingone active treatment and one placebo
matching the alternative active treatment , or two placebos).
Patients will be enrolled (screened) in the trial once they  have signed the informed consent. 
All patients who are suitable after screening will undergo a 6week T1DM therapy  
optimisation period, followed b y a2week open -label placebo run -in period before 
randomisation. Patients who successfull y complete both of th eseperiod sand who still meet 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomised into the 52 week double -blind treatment 
period in which they  will receive either oneof the 2doses of empagliflozin or placebo in 
addition to their regular insulin therapy .  
After the 52 week treatment period, all patients will enter a 3 week follow -up period during 
which they  will not be treated with study  medication. During this period all AEs need to be 
collected, documented and reported.  The patient ’sparticipation is concluded when they  have 
undergone the last planned visit (i.e. Trial Completion/Visit 1 7); last -patient -last-visit-
primary -endpoint will occur when all patients have completed 26 week s of treatment.  The 
end of the trial is defined as “last patient out” (i.e. last Visit [ADDRESS_417652] patient 
in the trial).    For further details regarding the definition of the end of the trial, please see 
Section 8.6.

Hepatic external adjudication [IP_ADDRESS]
Certain hepatic events will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_337996] y and 
causal relationship with the trial medication in a blinded fashion . The events which will be 
reviewed will be defined in 
acharter.  Events may  either be defined b y abnormal laboratory 
values and/or relevant adverse events or both .  For example, assessments will be made for 
events of hepatic injury  events, including liver enzy me elevations.
For qualify ing events, relevant source documents generated from any medical evaluations of 
these events will be requested including laboratory values, histological analy sis, results of 
ultrasound, CT, MRI , scintigraph y, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15588], and medical reports from other 
physicians.  All evaluations will be performed in a blinded fashion. The assessments will be 
analysed based on empagli flozin data combined from multiple trials (i.e. on project level ).
DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CHOICE OF 3.2
CONTROL GROUP
This trial will investigate the 
efficacy , safet y and tolerability  of empagliflozin in patients with 
T1DM, as adjunctive to insulin therapy ,and will further characterise the PK.
The trial design was chosen according to the FDA’s “Guidance for Industry , Diabetes 
Mellitus: Developi[INVESTIGATOR_337952]” [R08-
2669 ]. According to this guideline, insulin is the essential glucose -lowering therapy  for 
patients with T1DM. All experimental T1DM treatments that are not insulin analogues or

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_417655]-03(11.0)/Saved on:24Jul2014other insulin receptor ligands should be studied as add- on therapi[INVESTIGATOR_24305] i nsulin.   Consequently , 
in this trial empagliflozin and matching placebo will be administered asadd-on to an existing 
insulin therapy . Treatment with MDI  of insulin or CSII (i.e. insulin pump therap y)are held 
as the practical gold standard for the treatm ent of T1DM [ P13-[ZIP_CODE]]. 
Asixweek T1DM therapy optimisation period, followed by a two week placebo run -in 
period is deemed appropriate to screen out non- compliant patients , and to capture a “tru e” 
baseline incidence rate of hy poglycaemia, together with ba seline CGM profiles and optimal 
insulin use.
HbA 1cas t
heprimar yendpoint has b een dem onstrated to be a reflectio n oftheglycaemi c

dose.  Furthermo re, it w ill allow for the assessment of rev ersibility of unex pected long- term
side effects.
Use of a placebo group is deemed acceptable since it is expected that the insulin therapy 
requirement of patients receiving placebo will remain unchanged compared to their treatment 
before randomisation.
The rationale for dose and dose-interval selection is described in Section 4.1.[ADDRESS_417657] completed Visit 1 procedures prior to notification of the 
termination of recruitment will be allowed to continue in the study , if they  meet all entry

Removal of patients from therapy or assessments
Removal of individual patients [IP_ADDRESS]
An individual patient is to be withdrawn from trial treatment if:
The patient withdraws consent for st udy treatment or study  participation , without the need 
to justify  the decision.
The patient needs to start a restricted concomitant therap y (as listed in Section 4.2)that, in 
the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], poses a safety  risk if taken as add -on to the trial medication
The patient can no longer be treated with trial medication for other medical reasons ( such 
assurgery , AEs , other diseases, or pregnancy )
The patient experiences severe h ypogl ycaemia (for further details see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) or 
repeated h ypoglycaemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_337955],in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] ,may put the 
patient at risk with continued participation
If a patient becomes pregnant during the trial the study  medication will be stopped, the 
patient will be discontinued from the trial and the patient will be followed up until birth or 
otherwise termination of the pregnancy .
A patient can be discontinued a fter discussion between Sponsor and Investigator if eligibility  
criteria are being violated, or if the patient fails to comply  with the protocol (e.g. non-
attendance at study  assessments).
Patients who drop out during the screening , T1DM therapy  optimisation, or run -in period s
prior to randomisation will be considered screening failures. They  will be recorded as 
screening failure sin the eCRF and no further follow -up is required.  The data will be 
included in the trial database and will be report ed.
Patients who discontinue 
the trial treatment or withdraw from the study  after randomisation 
will be considered as “early  discontinuations” and the reason for this premature 
discontinuation of the trial treatment or withdrawal from the study  must be re corded in the 
eCRF. The data will be included in the trial database and will be reported.
For the anal ysis of this trial it is very  important that assessments for each planned visit are 
still performed in accordance with the Flow Chart even if patients discontinue trial treatment.  
Patients who discontinue treatment prematurel y will be followed up until the end of the 
study , unless they  withdraw their consent for this to happen.  All assessments related to the 
primary  and key secondary  endpoints still have to be performed as if the patient had remained

Discontinuation of the trial by  [CONTACT_941] S ponsor [IP_ADDRESS]
BI reserves the right to discontinue the trial overall or at a particu lar trial site at any  time for 
the following reasons:
Failure to meet expected enrolment goals overall or at a particular trial site
Emergence of an y efficacy /safet y information invalidating the earlier positive benefit -
risk-assessment that could signific antly affect the continuation of the trial
Violation of GCP, the CTP, or the contract disturbing the a ppropriate conduct of the trial
The Investigator / the trial site will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in case of 
trial termination (except in case of the third reason).

This will involve the use of IRT, which will take into consideration the relevant 
stratification factors. To facilitate the use of IRT, the Investigator will receive all necessary  
instructions and/or documents for using the IRT.
Patients will be r andomly  assigned ,in a 1:1:1 ratio ,toeither:
(i) empagliflozin 10mg
(ii) empagliflozin 25 mg 
(iii) placebo  
For further details refer to Section 7.6.
Patient assignment to the treatment groups will be determined b y a computer generated 
random sequence. Access to the randomisation code will be controlled and documented .  For 
further details please refer to Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS].
The kit (s)corresponding to the assigned medication number (s)should be give n to the patient 
and the number of the kit(s) that was /were dispensed will be entered in the eCRF. Using this 
procedure, relevant parties will be blinded to the treatment group assignment.
4.1.3 Selection of doses in the trial
The exposure response relationship between empagliflozin and UGE was evaluated for 
patients with T1DM (for further details please refer to Section 1.2.2).  R esults indicate that 
near maximal effects are achieved with empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg once daily ; these 
findings are comparable to those observed in patients with T2DM. It is conclude d that there 
are no clinically  relevant differences in PK/PD between the T1DM and T2DM populations 
and that the approved doses forT2DM 
patients are appropriate for use in studies assessing 
the safet y and efficacy of empagliflozin in adult patients with T1DM .  A detailed comparison 
of empagliflozin PK/PD in patients with T1DM versus T2DM isprovided in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
For further details with respect to T2DM PK/PD, please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] andto the

4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
The treatments to be evaluated are outlined in Table 4.1.4:1 below. Patients who qualify  will 
be randomised to one of the dosage and treatment schedules described. Except for the open -
label run-in period, trial medication will be dispensed in a double- blind manner.
All patients will be assigned placebo at the beginning of th e placebo run- in period (Visit 5) 
and dispensing will occur once within this period . Dispensing of kits for the double -blind 
treatment will begin at Visit 6. Dispensing will occur on 7 occasions as indicated in the Flow

CONCOMITANT THERAPY, RESTRICTIONS, AND RE SCUE 4.[ADDRESS_417677] information and any  changes relating to certain classes of concomitant therap y (e.g. 
anti-hypertensive concomitant therapy ). 
4.2.1 Rescue medication, emergency procedures, and additional treatments
There are no rescue medications in this trial.
All patients will be required to keep their existing insulin therapy as stable as possible from 
screening at Visit 1 until the beginning of the T1DM therap y optimisation period at Visit 2.  
From Visit 2, therap y for T1DM should be optimised (e.g. review of blood glucose values, 
insulin dose and its adjustment for meals, improve the patients’ ability  to carbohy drate count 
etc.) over a 6 week period to ensure that, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], a patient is achieving 
the best standard of care in accordance with local guidelines.  In CSII pa tients, and where 
considered appropriate, adjustments in T1DM therapy  might be supported by  [CONTACT_337999].
Optimisation of the T1DM therap y should be complete by [CONTACT_2671] 6week T1DM 
therap y optimisation period (i.e. b y Visit 5
), so that a patient’s insulin regimen is as stable as 
possible as they  enter the placebo run -in period when the first CGM period begins, and for 2 
weeks prior to randomisation at Visit 6.
During periods of stability , in case of h ypogl ycaemia (e.g. with m easured glucose 
concentration ≤ 70 mg/dL [ ≤ 3.9 mmol/L ]),patients should preferably  ingest additional 
carboh ydrates according to standard practice in the management of T1DM. However, a 
patient’s existing insulin regimen should be adjusted any  time for sa fety reasons if deemed 
necessary  by [CONTACT_737], e.g. in case of persisting hypergl ycaemia or hypogly caemia

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_417678]-03(11.0)/Saved on:24Jul2014Based on the mode of action of empagliflozin and the results of previous trials in T1DM (for 
further det ails see Section 1), atrandomisation on Day  1 (Visit 6) and the initiation of 
randomised study  medication, for patients with an HbA 1cof 7.5 to < 8% at V isit 5,
Investigators are advised to reduce the patient’s total insulin dose by 10% to avoid 
hypoglycaemia .  For patients with an HbA 1cof ≥8% at V isit 5, Investigators are advised to 
adjust the patient’s total insulin dose based on need as assessed by [CONTACT_338000]-up upon initiation of randomis ed study  medication.  In all cases, t he actual 
reduction will be dependent upon individual glucose values.  Thereafter and until the end of 
the trial (Visit 1
7), further adjustments to insulin therap y (both basal and bolus insulin ) may  
be implemented as necessary  to avoid h ypoglycaemia and also hy pergl ycaemia to ensur ethat, 
in the I nvestigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the patient is achieving the best standard of care in accordance 
with local guidelines .
Apart from the recommendation for an initial insulin reduction as mention ed above, at the 
start of the randomised treatment, there will be no protocol -defined algorithm towards insulin 
adjustment in this trial.  However, the Sponsor will provide additional support to the 
Investigator with respect to insulin adjustment via training documentation that will be 
presented at Investigator Meetings and made available in the I SF.  Throughout the trial,
adjustment needs to balance a patient’s individual risk for h ypoglycaemia on the one hand 
and the risk for h yperglycaemia and DKA on the other hand with special caution at the 
beginning of the treatment period , and in the Follow -up period, when empagliflozin treatment 
is started and stopped respectivel y. Any insulin dose change or adjustment must be based on 
laboratory  tests or SBGM .How ever, there are no blood glucose targets defined throughout 
the trial to allow Investigators to follow their local standard of care guidelines for the 
management of blood glucose.  Whenever possible, patients should keep to the same 
trademark and applicati on device for their existing insulin with no intention to change this 
during the trial; for medical/safet y reasons however (e.g. malfunction of a pump in a CSII 
patient), switches in mode of insulin delivery are permitted .  There should also be no planned 
major changes of the injection sites/areas.
In accordance with Section 3.3.2, I nvestigator’s must ensure that patients selected for the trial 
are capable of leading the management and adjustment of their insulin therapy  when at home, 
including a “sick day ” management plan, and at the same time, can be relied upon to contact 
[CONTACT_338001], as this is an outpatient trial.  
Investigator oversight will also be an important element of the insulin adjustment process.  
Special attention must be paid to the prevention of DKA. Due to the mec hanism of action, 
patients receiving empagliflozin are at risk to underestimate their need for insulin in case of 
blood sugar levels within their individual target range. Insulin deficiency  might lead to 
ketoacidosis which could be life
-threatening if not recogni sed, and appropriately  treated.  All 
patients must be made aware of this risk and be instructed not to reduce their insulin intake 
below Investigator recommendations.  For further details see Section 2.3.
In addition to pe rforming glucose monitoring , the frequency  of which will be increased after 
starting the stud y medication (for further details see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), in the same way  as

symptoms of DKA, e. g.nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain etc (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). They  
will be instructed to do this irrespective of the glucose value in the event of DKA s ymptoms 
occurring.  A meter will be provided to the patient for this purpose.  Patients will also be 
reminde d about 
the interpretation of ketone values measured via the meter , and on 
appropriate action to take in the event of increased ketone levels (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Ketones should also be determined in case of repeatedly elevated blood glucose levels (e.g. 
> 200 - 240 mg/dL (> 11.1 - 13.3 mmol/L )) which cannot be explained. Regular (e.g. 2-3 
times a week) measurements before breakfast are recommended throughout the trial from 
Visit 2.  More frequent (e.g. once dail y) measurements before breakfast are recommended 
during the run
-in period and during the first [ADDRESS_417680] (i.e. pH, 
bicarbonate ; the results will be collected on the relevant page of the eCRF) and that the 
patient is appropriatel y treated (i.e. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_337957]) 
according to local treatment guidelines .
Other concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_337958].  New anti- diabetic therap y should not be 
initiated during the randomised treatment period and the Follow -up period.
Insulin will not be provided as part of the clinical trial supplies.
There are no special emerg ency  procedures to be followed.
4.2.2 Restrictions
Restrictions regarding concomitant treatment [IP_ADDRESS]
Treatment with anti
-obesity  drugs or s ystemic cortico steroids will be prohibited due to their 
influence on glucose metabolism. There are no restrictions on t reatment with non- systemic 
corticosteroids suc h as inhaled or local corticosteroids.
For patients taking th yroid hormones, an y change in the dose should be avoided. If dose 
changes do occur, then they
 should be recorded in the source documents and in the eCRF.
Patients must not take any  paracetamol (acetaminophen) containing drugs throughout the 
CGM monitoring periods, since this may  falsel y raise CGM glucose readings.
Restrictions on diet and life sty le [IP_ADDRESS]
Throughout the trial, patients must follow a reliable approach to insulin dose adjustment for 
meals, such as c arboh ydrate counting , and based on Investigator recommendations. This 
method will be discussed with the patien t at Visit 1as part of the eligibility checks .  
Any patient who alread y uses real -time CGM as part of their therapy  for T1DM may continue 
to do so throughout the trial.  I n addition, patients must wear the(blinded) trial CGM sy stem

become unwell during the trial.  This discussion will be based on local recommendations for 
individuals with T1DM and should be evident from source documents (see Section 8.3.1)
. 
Site-specific tools may  be used where necessary . Patient s will be reminded to follow the 
recommended dietar yand physical activity  plan during the stud y.  Extreme diets (e.g. 
ketogenic diets such as the Atkins diet ) should be avoided.
Patients must not take any  other investigational drug within [ADDRESS_417682] visit (Visit

In this trial, the primary  endpoint to assess efficacy  is the change from baseline in HbA 1c(%) 
after 26 weeks.  Throughout this CTP, the term “baseline” for HbA 1crefers to the last 
observation prior to the first intake of randomised trial medication.  
5.1.2 Secondary e ndpoints
The key  secondary  endpoints to assess efficacy are as shown below.  Throughout this CTP, 
the term “baseline” refers to the 4 
week period prior to randomisation for the rate of 
symptomatic hypogly caemic AEs with confirmed plasma glucose < 54 mg/dL  (< 3.0 
mmol/L )and/or severe hy pogly caemi c AEs and the 2 week placebo run -in period for the 
mean daily insulin requirement and CGM.

osevere h ypogl ycaemia is defined as anevent requiring the assistance of another 
person to activel y administer carboh ydrate, glucagon or other correc tive actions.  
Plasma glucose concentrations may  not be available during an event, but 
neurological recovery  following the return of plasma glucose to normal is 
considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by  a low plasma glucose 
concentration (see Section [IP_ADDRESS])
oThe rate will be calculated from Day 29 (start of week 5) up to Week 26 cut -off 
date (to be defined in the Trial Statistical Analy sis Plan, TSAP)

 HbA 1cwill beanaly sed b y the central laboratory at the timepoints indicated in the 
Flow Chart .
The samples will be analysed at a central laboratory or its affi liates having a National 
Glycohemoglobin Standardisation Program (NGSP) L evel I certificate. HbA 1cresults will be 
reported in both NGSP (%) and International Federation of Clinical Chemistry , IFCC 
(mmol/mol) units.  The relationship between HbA 1cresults from the NGSP network (%
HbA 1c) and the IFCC network (mmol/mol) has been evaluated and a master equation has 
been developed (NGSP = [0.[ZIP_CODE]*I FCC] + 2.152). This relationship is continu ously  
monitored and an y changes areinvestigated. The NGSP certification process and test results 
for NGSP -certified methods do not change as a result of the IFCC standardisation of HbA 1c, 
and will continue to be directl y traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial

personnel.  
Daily  entries into the e -diary  will include at least : 
glucose values from SBGM (see Section [IP_ADDRESS])
any hypoglycaemic events that have occurred
oforcriteria for h ypogl ycaemic events, see Section [IP_ADDRESS]
insulin requirement
Any ketone measurements performed should also be entered into the e -diary  if and when any  
data becomes available (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
During the T1DM therapy  optimisation period, and daily  for 5 day s following clinic Visit 6, 
data from the e -diary  should be reviewed remotel y by [CONTACT_16795], pay ing 
particular attention to adjustments in the insulin regimen, glucose values, and if available, 
ketone measurements.  In addition, the patient should be c ontacted b y telephone ( e.g. weekl y 
during the T1DM therapy optimisation period) if e- diary  data, including glucose data, is not 
available and/or if the data suggest closer monitoring of the patient is required.  Additional 
clinic visits can also be arrange d if necessary  (for further details see Section 6.2.2) ; 
assessments at such visits would be defined according to Investigator judgement .
Throughout the trial, t he Investigator and/or designated site personnel, should review the 
patient’s glucose and e -diary results to determine if treatment adjustments need to be
implemented .  As a minimum, this review must take place at the timepoints indicated in the 
Flow Chart .
The e -diary  data will be transferre d to a vendor server for data collection and transfer to the 
Sponsor .
5.2.4 Systolic/diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate (vital signs)
SBP and DBP as well as pulse rate (elect ronically  or by  [CONTACT_23302], count for 1 minute) will be 
measured at the timepoints indicated in the Flow Chart with a calibrated electronic 
sphy gmomanomet er.  The BPmeasurement should be performed three times at each 
timepoint and the mean value of the measurements will be analysed.
Initiall y, BPshould be taken 3 times in both arms. The arm with the higher average pressure 
(systolic or – if equal –diastolic) should be used for subsequent measurements; if 
measurements for both arms are equal, the non
-dominant arm should be chosen .
BPmeasurements should alway s be performed on the same arm and, if possible, by [CONTACT_338003] . The same method must be used throughout the trial for a 
given patient i.e. if a patient receives the first BP measurement for example with an electronic 
device, the same method and device should be used throughout the study  for this patient.

5.2.5 Continuous glucose monitoring 
The CGM sy stem will be a commercially  available system with single -use disposable 
electrochemical sensing elements. It will allow glucose levels to be recorded for up to 7 day s 
at a time ,after which a sensor change is required to continue CGM. Glucose values recorded 
by [CONTACT_338004]/ designated site
-
personnel t o ensure unbiased data.   However, sites will be able to access information 
regarding the use of the system.
Prior to the first CGM period, p atients will be traine d in the correct use of the 
CGM s ystem, 
including its set -
up, sensor insertion, exchange and removal, and calibration using the SBGM 
device .  Refresher training should be provided at subsequent timepoints (as deemed 
appropriate b y the Investigator or desig
nated site- personnel).
Three periods of CGM will take place starting at the timepoints indicated in the Flow Chart .  
The first CGM period will last for 14 day s; the second and third CGM periods will have a 
duration of 28 day s.  These durations account for the natural variation due to sleep/wake, 
eating and activity  patterns.  Every  seven day s after starting each CGM period, the sensor 
must be exchanged; where a clinic visit is not scheduled for this day , the patient should 
change the sensor at home.  If all visits are conducted according to the Flow Chart , and 
without the use of the permitted visits windows, this equates to (see Figure 5.2.5: 1 below):
the patient changing the sensor at home on 7occasions
designated site -personnel inserting, or removing the sensor in the clinic on 6 occasions 
If clinic visits are scheduled making use of permitted visit windows (see Section 6.1 ), sensor 
exchange may  not match that shown in Figure 5.2.5: 1; sensor exchange must still occur 
every  7 day s after insertion.

measurement of blood glucose.  Instructions on the proper use of the SBGM equipment will 
be provided b y the site staff.  The patient will be asked to enter data from the glucose meter 
to the e- diary  on a dail y basis.  
Routinely , SBGM testing should be performed 4 times a day  as a minimum (e. g.at least 
before breakfast, lunch, dinner and at bedtime); furthermore, for 5 day s from the day  of
randomisation (i.e. Day s 1-5), SBGM testing frequency  should be increased to 8-
[ADDRESS_417698] one overnight measurement (i.e. a measurement taken at night, 
between the patient going to bed and getting up) .  On one of these 5 day s, the day time 
timepoints of the SBGM testing should mirror the timepoints for an 8 -point plasma glucose 
profile (for further details see Section 5.2.6).  Additional tests should be done as

patient is symptomatic, i.e. expe riences signs/s ymptoms of hy per-or hypogly caemia.  In 
patients prone to nocturnal hy poglycaemic events, a bedtime snack consisting of long -acting 
carboh ydrates should be considered.  Alternatively, minimum glucose levels of e.g. > 110 -
130 mg/dL (> 6.1 -7.2 mmol/L) should be targeted at bedtime to avoid nocturnal 
hypoglycaemia.  The Sponsor will also provide guidance on this topic via documentation in 
the ISF.
If, after an overnight fast, a nSBGM test result reveals blood glucose of > 200 - 240 mg/dL (> 
11.1 - 13.3 mmol/L ) or ≤70mg/dL ( ≤ 3.9 mmol/L), the patient should be asked to 
contact [CONTACT_338005] .  The Investigator should then instruct the patient on appropriate measures in 
order to adequatel y control their hypergl ycaemia or hypogl ycaemia.  All insulin treatment 
decisions should be based on blood glucose values measured using SBGM or based on 
laboratory  values obtained through the central laboratory  (or, if applicable, the local 
laboratory )
.
A comparable SBGM s ystem will be supplied to all patients and must be used by [CONTACT_338006] y.  In accordance with Section 3.3.2, I nvestigator’s should carefully  select 
patients for the stud y in terms of their abilit y to comply  with the SBGM requirements.  
Patients not adhering to the SBGM instructions given by  [CONTACT_338007] .
Ketone measurement [IP_ADDRESS]
Patients will be equipped with an electronic device to determine their ketone concentration
(i.e. a blood glucose monitoring device/meter that is also capable of measuring blood 
ketones).
Patients should be reminded to test t heir ketone sin case of any  symptoms of DKA, e.g.
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain etc., irrespective of the glucose value . Patients must be 
reminded about the signs and sy mptoms of DKA , on the interpretation of ketone values 
measured via the meter , and o n appropriate action to take in the event of increased ketone 
levels (see below) .In the same way as during routine clinical care, patients should also be 
reminded to test for ketones in case of repeatedl y elevated blood glucose levels (e.g. > 200 
-
240mg/dL [> 11.1 - 13.3 mmol/L ]) which cannot be explained. Regular (e.g. 2-3 times a 
week) measurements before breakfast are recommended throughout the trial from Visit 2.  
More frequent (e.g. once daily ) measurements before breakfast are recommended during the 
run-in period and during the first 4 weeks of the treatment period and might also be agreed 
upon with the patient afterwards if deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_737].
In the event of increased ketones, patients should either follow the rules given by  [CONTACT_16030] (e.g. increased fluid intake and/or insulin bolus ; food intake and insulin bolus in 
case of near -normal blood glucose ) or contact [CONTACT_23311]. In case of deteriorating ketosis, 
blood glucose and ketone levels should be checked ever y 1-2 hours until they areback in a 
range considered to be normal for the patient . Patients should be instructed to immediately  
refer themselves to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491]/or the Investigator, or to contact [CONTACT_338008] ,in

5.3.5 O ther safety parameters
Assessment of h ypoglycaemia rate [IP_ADDRESS]
Hypoglycaemia rates will be assessed based on AE data, which in turn rely on the criteria for 
hypoglycaemic events (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] below).  Glucose values used within the criteria 
for h ypoglycaemic events will originate in the SBGM device and from central laboratory  
measurements.  All glucose values originating in the SGBM device will subsequently  be 
entered into the e -diary  (for further details please see Section s 5.2.3 and [IP_ADDRESS] )
.
Criteria for h ypogl ycaemic events [IP_ADDRESS]
Every  epi[INVESTIGATOR_337965]/plasma glucose ≤ 70 mg/d L (≤ 3.9 mmol/ L) should be documented 
with the respective time and date of occurrence. This includes hypoglycaemia with glucose 
values < 54 mg/d L(< 3.0 mmol/ L) and all s ymptomatic and allsevere h ypogl ycaemi c events
.
For the anal ysis, all hy poglycaemias will be classified according to the following criteria:
Asymptomatic hy poglycaemia: event not accompanied by  [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_337966] a measured glucose concentration ≤ 70 mg/dL ( ≤ 3.9 mmol/L)
Documented s ymptomatic hy poglycaemia with glucose concentration ≥ 54 mg/dL and 
≤ 70 mg/dL ( ≥ 3.0 mmol/L and ≤ 3.9 mmol/L): event accom panied by  [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_337967]
Documented s ymptomatic hy poglycaemia with glucose concentration < 54 mg/dL 
(<3.0mmol/L ): event accompanied by  [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_2855] s ymptoms of hy pogly caemia but no need 
for external assistance
Severe h ypogl ycaemi a: event re quiring the assistance of another person to activel y 
administer carboh ydrates, glucagon or take other correc tive actions.  Plasma glucose 
concentrations may  not be available during an event, but neurological recovery  following 
the return of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event 
was induced b y a low plasma glucose concentration [R14-0982]
If a patient is provided with an emergency  glucagon injection device as part of their local, 
routine T1DM care, it is advisable for the patient to ca rry this throughout the trial.

5.3.6 Assessment of adverse events
Definitions of AEs [IP_ADDRESS]
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily  have 
to have a causal re lationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended si gn (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which:
results in death
is life -threatening
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_36118]
results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity
is a c ongenital anomal y/birth defect
or
is to be deemed serious for any  other reason if it is an important medical event when 
based upon appropriate medical judge ment which may  jeopardi se the patient and may  
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definitions.
Life-threatening in this context refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might ha ve caused death 
if more severe.
AEs considered “Always Serious”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency  initiative on Important Medical Events, 
BI has set up a list of AEs, which by  [CONTACT_15623], can alway s be considered to be “serious” 
even though they  may  not have met the crite ria of an SAE as given above.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_417709]-03(11.0)/Saved on:24Jul2014The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the Remote Data Capture ( RDC ) 
system . These events should alway s be reported as SAEs as described in Section 5.3.[ADDRESS_417710] (AESIs)
The t erm AESI relates to any  specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, 
e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds i n the same class.
AESI sneed to be reported to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same 
timeframe that applies to SAE, see Section 5.3.7.
Patients with AESI sneed to be followed up appropriately , regardless of the origin of the 
laboratory  data (e.g. central, local etc.) . The Investigator should consider which, if any , 
concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_148832].  Discontinued treatments can be 
reintroduced per Investigator discretion.
The foll owing are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury  is defined by  [CONTACT_338010] (Visit 6) : 
an elevation of AST and/or ALT ≥ [ADDRESS_417711] combined with an elevation of total 
bilirubin ≥ [ADDRESS_417712] measured in the same blood sample
an isolated elevation of ALTand/or AST ≥ 5fold ULN
These lab oratory findings constitute a hepatic injury
 alert and the patients showing these 
abnormalities nee d to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided via the 
RDC -system .
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab oratory
results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the Investigator should make sure these 
parameters are analy sed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet 
the criteria of hepatic injury  alert, the procedures described in the “DILI checklist ”should be 
followed.
Decreased renal function
Decreased renal function is defined by  a creatinine value show ing a ≥ [ADDRESS_417713].
For the AESI “decreased renal function” the Investigator shall collect an unscheduled 
laboratory sample for creatinine as soon as possible and initiate follow -up laboratory  testsof 
creatinine according to medical judgement .

DKA is defined b y the diagnostic criteria in Table 5. 3.6.1: 1 below, and as defined b y the 
American Diabetes Association ( ADA
) [R14-5435 ].
Investigators should note that not all criteria in the table below need to apply  for the diagnosis 
of DKA , and clinical judgement should also be taken into consideration .  Due to its
mechanism of action, empagliflozin may potentially  modify  the clinical presentation of DKA 
which 
may occur at lower plasma glucose levels than stated in Table [IP_ADDRESS]: 1 below (see

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_417715]-03(11.0)/Saved on:24Jul2014This definition includes amputation (i.e. resection of a limb through a bone), disarticulation 
(i.e. resection of a limb through a joint) and auto -amputations (i.e. spontaneous separation of 
non-viable portion of the lower limb).
Not included in this definition are debridement (removal of callus or dead tissue), pro cedures 
on a stump (like stump revision, drainage of an abscess, wound revision etc.) and other 
procedures (e.g. nail resection or removal) without a concomitant resection of a limb 
(amputation or disarticulation).
Each lower limb amputation, disarticulat ion, or auto -amputation should be reported 
separately . The SAE report should include the date of the procedure, the level of amputation 
or disarticulation, the medical condition(s) leading to the procedure and if the patient had 
some of the known risk fac tor(s) for lower limb amputation.
Intensity of AEs
The intensity  of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is/are easily  tolerated
Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities
Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judg ement should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, tempor al relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history .
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational pr oduct 
administered and the AE.
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE.
The causal relationship must be provided by  [CONTACT_338011], i.e.

After the last per protocol contact [CONTACT_338012] y monitor patients 
for AEs. However, if the I nvestigator becomes aware of SAEs or AESIs that occurred after 
the last per protocol contact, the SAEs and AESIs should be reported b y the I nvestigator to 
the Sponsor if considered relevant b y the Investigator .
AE reporting to S ponsor an d timelines
The Investigator must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form via fax immediately  (within 24 hours ) to the 
Sponsor’s unique entry  point (country  specific contact [CONTACT_21644] I SF).  
The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. O n specific occasions 
the Investigator could inform the Sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the 
requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE fo rm.
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline appl y as for initial 
information.
Information required
For each AE, the Investigator should prov

baseline conditions.
All (S)AEs, including those persisting after trial completion must be followed up until they  
have resolve d, have been sufficiently  characteri s

obtained.
Screening failures
SAEs occurring in patients after having discontinued in the trial due to screening failures, i.e. 
after the screening period and who did not receive any  trial medication, are to be reported if 
the Investigator considered the SAE related to the screening procedure. SAEs which 
occurred during the screening period are to be reported according to standard proc edures.
Pregnancy
In the rare case that a female patient participating in this clinical trial becomes pregnant after 
having taken trial medication, the I nvestigator must report immediately  (within 24 hours) the 
drug exposure during pregnancy  (DEDP) to the Sponsor’s unique entry  point (country -
specific contact [CONTACT_21644] I SF). The Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for 
Clinical Trials (Part A) should be used. 
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the DEDP must be followed up and repor ted 
to the Sponsor’s unique entry  point on the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials 
(Part B). 
As pregnancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompany ing SAE, 
only the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials and n
ot the SAE form is to be 
completed. If there is an SAE associated with the pregnancy then the SAE has to be reported 
on the SAE form in addition. 
The I SF will contain the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and B).

APPROPRIATENESS OF M EASUREMENTS 5.[ADDRESS_417725] such as empagliflozin ,and/or standard as part 
of routine care for T1DM [R08-2669, R14-0344]
.  All defined measurements will be 
performed in order to monitor safet y and tolerability  aspects and to determine efficacy and 
PK in an appropriate way.
A surrogate endpoint (i.e. the laboratory  parameter HbA 1c) is used as the primary  efficacy  
endpoint, since f or the 
purposes of drug approval and labeling, which will support an 
indication of gl ycaemic control, regulatory  authorities state that this endpoint, albeit 
surrogate, is the primary  endpoint of choice [R08-2669
].
Electronic devices have been selected as the method for PROs.  Use of a PRO instrument is 
advised when measuring a concept best known b y the patient or best measured from the 
patient perspective (e.g. sy mptoms associated with hy poglycaemia).  PRO instruments should 
be shown to measure the concept they  are intended to measure , and steps should be taken to 
ensure that patients are making entries according to the design of the trial and not, for 
example, just before a clinic visit [ R12-
5607].  Hence the selection of an electronic device 
over a paper -based alternative.

VISIT SCHEDULE 6.[ADDRESS_417727] in the morning (e.g. between 7am and 11am ).  All patients 
must adhere to the visit schedule as specified in the Flow Chart .  If permitted visit windows 
are applied to a visit involving CGM, it must be ensured that the CGM sensor is still 
exchanged within its period of stability  (i.e. 7 day ssince insertion), despi[INVESTIGATOR_337970].
If any visit has to be re -scheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original visit schedule . 
The trial medication kitswill contain sufficient medication to allow for the protocol -
permitted visit windows.
If a patient mistakenl y takes trial medication on the morning of a visit before attending the 
clinic (excluding visits prior to randomisation) or comes in non- fasted where a fasting 
condition is required, t he visit should be re -scheduled to the next day  reminding the patient 
about the expected conditions. At the relevant visits, i t must also be ensured that

DETAILS OF TRIAL PRO CEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS 6.2
At each visit, a ssessments should be performed as indicated in the Flow Chart and as detailed 
in the respective protocol sections.
6.2.1 Screening, T1DM therapy optimisation and placebo run- in period s
Screening visit (Visit 1) [IP_ADDRESS]
The screening visit does not need to be done with the patient in a fasted state (see Section 
5.3.3)
No trial procedures should be done unless the patient has consented to taking part in the 
trial. Once they  have consented, the patient is considered to be enrolled in the trial and to
have started screening. The patient should be recorded on the enrolmen t log and be 
registered in the IRT system as a screened patient 
BP should alway s be measured before an y blood samples are taken.  For details regarding 
the correct method for measuring BP, see Section 5.2.4
Patients who are not eligible to proceed to Visit 2 should be registered as a screen failure 
in the I RT s ystem and the eCRF and no further follow -up is required
T1DM therap y optimisation period (Visits 2 , 3/3Tand 4 T) [IP_ADDRESS]
Visit 2 should be done with the patient in a fasted state (i.e.
 no food or drink except water 
for 10 hours) (see Section 5.3.3)

Visit 3T, if performed as a telephone visit, does not require attendance at the clinic.  If 
performed as a clinic visit, Visit 3 does not need to be done with the patient in a fasted 
state (see Section 5.3.3 ) 
Visit 4 Tis a telephone visit and does not require attendance at the clinic
Each visit should only  be perfor med once it has been confirmed that the patient is eligible 
to progress to the next visit; ineligible patients should be registered in the IRT s ystem and 
the eCRF as a screen failure and no further follow -up is required
BP should alway s be measured before any blood samples are taken (relevant for Visit 2 
only).  For details regarding the correct method for measuring BP, see Section 5.2.4
At the end of each visit, patients should be reminded about the importance of entering 
data into their e- diary  on a daily  basis, including data from the glucose/ketone meter, so 
that optimisation of the T1DM therap y can be monitored remotel y by [CONTACT_338014] -
personnel, and an assessment made of the need for weekly telephone discussions and/or 
additional visits   
Placebo run- in period (Visit 5) [IP_ADDRESS]
Visit 5does not need to be done with the patient in a fasted state (see Section 5.3.3)
Visit 5should only  be performed once it has been confirmed that the patient is eligible to 
progress to this visit, based on an assessment of results from Visits 2 to4T
As for Visit 1, BP should alway s be measured before an y blood samples are taken.  For 
details regarding the correct method for measuring BP, see Section 5.2.4
Following completion of the Visit 5 procedures, eligible patients will be dispensed a 
placebo run -in kit for the 2 week run -in period which will be assigned via the I RT s ystem.  
Ineligible patients should be registered in the IRT system and the eCRF as a screen failure 
and no further follow -up is required
From Visit 5, eligible 
patients will also start the first CGM period (in participating 
countries) and will continue this until Visit 6. If the patient wishes to perform the first 2 
hour start up calibration of the CGM sy stem (using his/her glucose meter) whilst at the 
site, this should be taken into consideration when planning the order of assessments at 
this visit (for further details, refer to CGM s ystem user guide).  If deemed necessary  by 
[CONTACT_14523], patients can be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y phone in between these visits to ensure th e 
correct performance of the CGM device.  Patients must also be reminded to chan ge the 
CGM sensor at home, 7 day s after its insertion at Visit 5

End of treatment -early discontinuations (eEOT) and withdrawals [IP_ADDRESS]
Patients who discontinue study  medication earl y should have the assessments for eEOT 
(Earl y Discontinuations Only) performed, as indicated in the Flow Chart .  For such patients, 
the eEOT V isit should be done as soon as possible after the decision to discontinue has been 
made.  If the eEOT Visit occurs within the time window of a scheduled visit and the patient 
continues to be followed up, the eEOT Visit w ill replace that scheduled visit.  For example:
if a patient discontinues study  medication 16 weeks after randomisation (i.e. between 
Visits 9and 10), the eEOT Visit could be scheduled one week later, and it would occur 
within the time window of the next scheduled visit (i.e. Visit 10at W eek 18 ± 7 day s).  
When returning to the visit schedule, after completing the 3 week Follow -up Visit (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] below), the patient would return for Visit 11 at W eek 2 2
If apatient intends to immediately  discontinue (withdraw) from the study , an eEOT Visit 
should be performed as soon as possible after the decision to withdraw has been made.

STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL 7.1
This is a randomised, double blind, multi- centre, placebo -controlled, parallel group stud y to
assess the efficacy , safety , tolerability , and PK of once dail y oral doses of empagliflozin 10 
mg and 25 mg compared to placebo in patients with T1DM as adj unctive to insulin therapy .
This is a 52 week trial; however the efficacy  endpo ints will be assessed primarily  in a 
confirmatory  manner on [ADDRESS_417741] for the parallel testing of the 2 doses in order to maintain a ty pe I

will be provided in the TSAP.
Further sensitivity  anal yses will be based on the randomised set (RS).  The RS includes all 
randomised patients regardless of treatment with study  medication . 
All analy ses will be conducted in SAS® version 9.2 or later.
7.3.1 Primary 
endpoint analyses
Primary  anal ysis of the primary  endpoint [IP_ADDRESS]
The primary  endpoint in this trial is the change from baseline in HbA 1c(%) after 26 weeks .
The primary  efficacy  
analy sis will be performed on the FAS ; patients will be assigned to the 
treatment they  were randomised to and anal ysed according to the stratum to which they  
belong (regardless of an y mis -assignment based on identification of the wrong stratum) .  
Only  on-treatment HbA 1cvalues will be included in the primary  analy sisfor efficac y. 
M
ean changes from baseline in HbA 1cafter 2 6weeks will be anal ysed using a restricted 
maximum likelihood -based repeated measures approach (MMRM analy sis).  Anal yses will 
include the fixed categorical effects of treatment, pre- existing insulin therapy , week and 
treatment b y week interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline HbA 1c, 
baseline eGFR and baseline HbA 1cby [CONTACT_12921].  An unstructured (co)variance 
structure will be used to model the within patient measureme nts.
If this anal ysis fails to converge, the following covariance structures will be tested: 
compound sy mmetry , variance components and Toeplitz.  The (co)variance structure 
converging to the best fit, as determined b y Akaike’s information criterion, will be used as 
the primary  analy sis.
The Kenward
-Roger approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom.  
Significance tests will be based on least -squares means using a two -sided α = 0.025 (two-
sided 97.5% confidence intervals).  The re siduals are assumed to have a multivariate normal

Following the anal ysis of the efficacy estimand, an effectiveness anal ysis will be performed
on the m ITT set .  This will use the same model as described for the efficacy anal ysis, but 
include all available on -and off -treatment values.

7.3.2 Secondary endpoint analyses
Key secondary  endpoints –confirmatory  anal yses [IP_ADDRESS]
The anal ysisof change from baseline in body  weight after 26 weeks will follow the strategy  
for the primary  endpoint ,MMRM, with the addition of terms for baseline body  weight and 
baseline bod y weight b y week interaction into the model.  This analy sis will be performe d on 
the FAS, including all available on -treatment data .
The anal ysisof change from baseline in TDID after 26 weeks will follow the strategy  for the 
primary  endpoint MMRM
, with the addition of terms for baseline TDID and baseline TDID 
by [CONTACT_338019].  This anal ysis will be performed on the FAS, including 
all available on -treatment data .  The baseline TDID will be calculated based on the mean 
daily  insulin requirement during the 2 week run
-in period.  The TDID after 26 weeks will be 
calculated based on the mean dail y insulin requirement over the previous 7 days (i.e. during 
Week 26).
The change from baseline in percentage time spent in target glucose range and the change 
from baseline in IQR in Weeks 23 to 26 weeks as determined b y CGM will be anal ysed using 
an ANCOVA model.  The statistical model will be:
<CGM endpoint> change from baseline =  overall mean + treatment + pre- existing insulin 
therap y + continuous baseline HbA 1c+ continuous 
baseline eGFR + continuous baseline <respective 
CGM endpoint> + random error 
Treatment and pre -existing insulin therap y are fixed classification effects and baseline HbA 1c,
baseline eGFR and baseline <CGM endpoint> are linear covariates. The random error is 
assumed to be normall y distributed with mean 0 and unknown variance σ2. The anal ysis will 
be performed on the FAS, including all available on -treatment data . 
The anal ysisof the incidence r ate of sy mptomatic hypoglycaemic AEs with confi rmed 
plasma glucose < 54 mg/dL  (< 3.0 mmol/L )and/or severe hy poglycaemi c AEs per patient -
year from Week 5 to W eek 26 will utilise a negative binomial model, with terms for 
treatment, baseline rate, baseline HbA 1c,baseline eGFR and pre -existing insulin therapy  as 
fixed effects, and log (days of follow -
up) as an offset.  This analy sis will include patients 
from the FAS, including all available on- treatment event sfrom the start of Week 5 (Day 29)
up to Week 26 cut -
off date .  The baseline rate of symptomatic hypoglycaemic AEs with 
confirmed plasma glucose < 54 mg/dL  (< 3.0 mmol/L )and/or severe hy poglycaemi c AEs
will be calculated based on the event rate during the 4 weeks prior to randomisation.
The anal ysisof the incidence rate of s ymptomatic hypoglycaemic AEs with confirmed 
plasma glucose < 54 mg/dL  (< 3.0 mmol/L )and/orsevere h ypogl ycaemic AEs per patient -

7.3.4 Safety analyses
Safety  will be assessed for the endpoints listed in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  All treated patients willbe 
included in the safet y evaluation (i.e. in the TS).  Safet y analyses will be mostly  descriptive 
in nature and will be based on BI standards.  In addition, statistical analy sis for selected 
endpoints (to be defined in the TSAP) may be perform ed, if appropriate.  No hy pothesis 
testing is planned.
The active empagliflozin treatment grou ps will be compared with the placebo group in a 
descriptive way .  Tabulations of frequencies/proportions will be used for the evaluation of

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_417756]-03(11.0)/Saved on:24Jul2014categorical (qualitative) data, and tabulations of descriptive statistics will be used to 
summarise continuous (quan titative) data.
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Affairs
(MedDRA). The anal ysis of AEs will be based on the concept of treatment emergent adverse 
events.  That means that all AEs occurring from first study  medi cation intake until [ADDRESS_417757] study  medication intake will be assigned to ‘pre
-treatment’ and all AEs 
occurring after last study  medication intake + 7 day s will be assigned to ‘post -treatment’.  
Additional listings based on actual treatment at onset of AE will be produced for patients who 
receive inco rrect treatment at any  point during the trial.  Specific analy ses of hy poglycaemia 
will assign events onl y up to the end of the last study medication intake + 1 day to the 
randomised treatment, later h ypogl ycaemia events will be assigned to ‘post -treatment ’.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of AEs will be tabulated by  [CONTACT_36140] .
Independent of this rule, the relationship of an AE to the study  medication will be assessed by  
[CONTACT_737].  
Laboratory  data will be analy sed both quantitatively  as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory  data t o their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be highlighted in the 
listings. Treatment groups will be compared descriptively  with regard to distribution 
parameters as well as with rega rd to frequency  and percentage of patients with abnormal 
values or clinicall y relevant abnormal values. 
Vital signs, ph ysical examinations, or other safet y-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the trial and at the end -of-trial evaluation will be assessed with 
regard to possible changes compared to findings before start of treatment.

monitored by  a DMC.  For further details see Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
HANDLING OF MISSING DATA 7.[ADDRESS_417760] model 
will handle missing data based on a likelihood method under the "missing at random 
assumption".  E very randomised patient with at least baseline and one on- treatment 
measurement will be included in the anal ysis.This approach will also be used for the
confirmatory  anal ysis of the key secondary  endpoints investigating change from baseline in 
body  weight, TDID, SBP and DBP.
An anal ysis including off -treatment data and multiple imputation will be used as a sensitivity  
analysis for the primary  endpoint to handle missing data.  A detailed description of multiple 
imputation will be included in the TSAP. This approach will also be applied to the key  
secondary  endpoints of change from baseline in body  weight, TDID, % time in range as 
determined b y CGM, IQR as determined b y CGM, SBP and DBP.
For the key  secondary  endpoint of incidence 
rate of symptomatic hy poglycaemic AEs with 
confirmed plasma glucose < 54 mg/dL  (< 3.0 mmol/L )and/orsevere hy poglycaemia, 
available on -treatment data will be anal ysedand no imputation performed. A sensitivity  
analysis including post treatment events will alsobe performed.
Details regarding the imputation rule for further endpoints will be specified in the TSAP.  No 
imputation is planned for any  anal ysis of AEs, laboratory  data, and vital signs.
RANDOMISATION 7.[ADDRESS_417761] to placebo and the 2 active 
dose groups of empagliflozin.  Patients will be randomised in blocks to the 3 study  treatments 
in a 1:1:1 ratio at Visit 6.  The randomisation will be stratified b ythebaseline eGFR value as 
calculated b y the CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_14420] (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m2versus ≥ 60 mL /min/1.73 m2), 
baseline HbA 1c(< 8.5% versus ≥ 8.5%), and b y the patients’ pre -existing insulin therapy  
(MDI versus CSII).   If necessary , and depending upon global distribution, entry of patients 
into a particular HbA 1cstratummay be capped.    
The randomisation of patients to the treatment groups will be performed via I RT.  BI will 
arrange for the randomisation as well as packaging and labelling of study  medication.  The 
randomisation list will be generated using a validated sy stem, which involves a 
pseudorandom number generator and a supplied seed number so that the resulting allocation 
of medication numbers to treatmen t is both reproducible and non- predictable. The block size 
will be documented in the CTR. Access to the codes will be controlled and documented.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_417762]-03(11.0)/Saved on:24Jul2014DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE 7.7
Based on previous experience with empagliflozin in  it is 
estimated that the change in HbA 1cfrom baseline after 26 weeks of treatment is 0.3% in 
empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg) and 0% in placebo and that the standard deviation of this 
difference is 0.9%. 
As 2 dose levels of empagliflozin are being investigated , the alpha (Ty pe I error) is assumed 
to be 2.5%.  Assuming that the change from baseline in HbA 1cfollows a normal distribution 
(Student’s t-test) and that a two- sided test will be employ ed, with equal standard deviations, 
then a sample size of 225patients per arm will show superiorit y with a power of 90%.  
Software package nQuery version 7.0 was used to derive the sample size.
Given that there are 3 treatment groups, a total sample size of 720 patients (240 per group) 
will be randomised to allow for an estimated 6% of patients who do not qualify  for the FAS.

Has been changed to:
The change from baseline in percentage time spent 
in target glucose range and the change from 
baseline in IQR 
in Weeks 23 to 26 as determined 
by [CONTACT_338029].  The statistical model will be:
<CGM endpoint> change from baseline =  overall 
mean + treatment + pre -existing 
insulin therapy  + continuous baseline 
HbA 1c+ continuous baseline eGFR + 
continuous baseline <respective 
CGM endpoint> + random error 
Treatment and pre -existing insulin therap y are 
fixed classification effects and baseline HbA 1c,
baseline eGFR 
and baseline <CGM endpoint> are 
linear covariates. The random error is assumed to 
be norm ally distributed with mean 0 and unknown 
variance σ2. The anal ysis will be performed on the 
FAS, including all available on- treatment data .

Rationale for change To highlight the importance of CGM -related 
endpoints “time in range” and “IQR” as key  
secondary  endpoints given that SGL T-2 inhibitor 
treatment in Type 1 diabetes mellitus may  improve 
the burden of gl ycaemic variability  which remains 
a fundamental treatment challenge in the 
management of this disease.

Description of change “An anal ysis including off -treatment data and 
multiple imputation will be used as a sensitivity  
analysis for the primary  endpoint to handle missing 
data.  A detailed description of multiple imputation
will be included in the TSAP.  This approach will 
also be applied to the key secondary  endpoints of 
change from baseline in body  weight, TDID, % 
time in range as determined by  [CONTACT_28047], SBP and 
DBP.”

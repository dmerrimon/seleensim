Methodology:  
Study design  
 
 
Phase IIa, prospective, international, multicentre, randomised,  double -blind, placebo- contro lled, parallel group, 
dose-finding study in patients with venous leg ulcer.  
Patients suffering from chronic venous disease and having at least one active venous leg ulcer will be selected 
at the selection visit  (ASSE) . One Reference Ulcer (RU) defined as t he largest ulcer in size that is fitting the 
area selection criteria will be established. At ASSE, a first pi[INVESTIGATOR_767232] a second pi[INVESTIGATOR_767233]. The investigator will chec k 
that the selection RU area is compliant with the selection criteria. Patients  will start the selection  period and 
will be switched from their current pharmacological and/or local treatment (if any) for venous leg ulcer to local 
wound care with sterile saline solution  or sterile water , “non- active” dressings and standardized  compression  
(same strength and type of compression) . They will be administrated the placebo selection  treatment for a 
period of fourteen days . 
Three (or four ) working days before the i nclusion visit, the participants will come to the site for a RU pi[INVESTIGATOR_767234] (W000).  
At W000, the investigator will check that the inclusion RU area is compliant with the inclusion criteria . The 
relative change of Reference Ulcer area compared with the RU area measured at the selection visit must be less 
or equal to 20% in order for patients to be eligible. The investigator will also check that the particip ant is 
compliant with the selection  treatment and stockings wearing. Patients found to be eligible for randomisation 
will have a 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767235] W000, taken after randomisation and after wound bed 
preparation. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] (W000- B) will be the baseline measure for comparison with all subsequent pi[INVESTIGATOR_767236] .

All participants found to be eligible for inclusion will be randomised to one of the following six groups –  
S42909: 100, 200, 400, 800 or 1200 mg per day - or placebo, using a centralised, dynamic, bal anced with 
1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio, stratified randomisation according to the country , a combined prognosis criteria (size and age 
of ulcer) ), and diabetic status (yes/no),  by [CONTACT_53177]  (IWRS). 
The combined prognosis criteria (size and age of ulcer) for ulcer healing are:  
o A : ≤ 10 cm² and ≤ 6 months  
o B : > 10 cm² or > [ADDRESS_1052009]  (IMP) treatment period on 
top of standard of care (standardized compression and local wound care with sterile saline solution or sterile 
water  and “non- active” dressing) followed by a [ADDRESS_1052010] of care only. During this 
period the participants will return to the investigator’s site for intermediate visits after one week (W001), two 
weeks (W002) , three weeks (W003), four weeks (W004), six weeks (W006) and eight weeks (W008). 
Participants will continue receiving standardized compression therapy and local wound care (sterile saline 
solution or sterile water and “non -active” dressing) until the end of the study (W008).  
At each visit, the clinical features of the RU will be recorded and a 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767238] a 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767239] . All 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767240], measurement of ulcer area, perimeter and volume for the primary 
and secondary endpoints of the study. I ndependent expe rts from patients, CRO, and investigators, will review 
the 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767241] ( and inclusion,  if applicable)  as well as the clinical aspect of the RU and 
will confirm or not the selection (or the inclusion , if applicable) . At W000, W004 and W006, the pain level 
will be assessed before the record ing of clinical features of RU.  
The primary endpoint will be assessed at [ADDRESS_1052011] 9 PK samples collected over 12 hours at the W000 visit and 13 PK 
samples collected over 24 hours at the W004 visit .

Other measurements   
- Pharmacokinetic measurements  
The concentrations of S42909 and its metabolites (S45015, S45236 and S [ZIP_CODE]) in plasma will be assayed 
according to validated methods.   
- Genomic s assessment  (W000) (optional) : 
. To evaluate potential associations between polymorphisms in relevant genes and the 
pharmacokinetics of S42909. 
. To iden tify subgroups of participants with genetic susceptibility to develop non healing venous leg 
ulcer or to identify novel genes that may play a critical role in the treatment response.  
- N on genomic b iomarkers assessment  (optional) : 
Plasma  and serum  samples fo r assessment of non genomic biomarkers related to  venous leg ulcer healing, 
underlying chronic venous disease  and response to S42909 treatment will be collected at the W000 and W004  
visits.  
 
Statistical methods:  
Study Outcome  
Study outcome analyses will be carried out on the RS (Randomised Set).  
Main efficacy analysis:  Detection of an overall dose -response effect  
The objective of the main analysis will be to detect the existence of a dose-response relationship according to 
the ulcer area reduction expressed as the relative change from baseline to W004 (%) and using the MCP -Mod 
Method. 
Study participants (disposition, baseline characteristics and follow -up) and Safety analysis : 
The doses 0 mg (placebo), 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 800 mg and 1200 mg will be ass essed in the study and 
the following set of 7 candidate models: M = (Linear, Emax (2), Sigmoïd Emax, Logistic, Exponential (2)) 
will be considered for the main analysis.  
For each model in M, optimal contrasts will be defined in order to evaluate the global  relevance of model.  
Then, a test of contrast will be performed on each model to detect the existence of dose -response relationship 
with control of the Family Wise Error Rate. The model with the minimum p -value (the one with the strongest 
statistical test and greater than an appropriate critical value q) will be chosen as the “best” fit model.  
As secondary analysis, after reassessment of the parameters of the model selected in the main analysis and 
considering an hypothesis of clinically relevant difference  that is equal to 6.5% (as compared to placebo), a  
dose window for the Minimal Effective Dose (MED) will be estimated . 
Pharmacokinetic analysis  
A population PK analysis will be performed in order to describe the pharmacokinetics of S42909 and its 
metabolites in participants suffering from active venous leg ulcer s, to quantify and qualify the  sources of PK 
variability ( i.e., covariate analysis), and to provide individual secondary PK  parameter estimates ( e.g., 
exposure, terminal half -life).  
To further invest igate any potential PK/PD relationship, the correlation between S42909  and its metabolites 
PK and the potential biological markers and clinical outcome (mainly on improving healing of Venous Leg 
Ulcers and pain related to venous leg ulcer s) will be explore d. If relevant, population PK/PD analysis will be 
performed. In addition, the correlation between drug exposure and any evidence of safety signal will be

2. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
Venous disease is considered as extremely common and a major cause for seeking medical assistance in Western countries ( (Fowkes, 2001) ; (Beebe -Dimmer, 2005) ) costing society 
more than ten million Euros/year per million people (Carpentier , 2004) . Several studies based 
on the Clinical, Etiological, Anatomic and Physiopathologic (CEAP) classification have shown that a large portion of the general population suffers from symptoms related to venous insufficiency in the lower limbs ( (Criqui, 2003) ; (Jawien, 2003) ; (Chiesa, 2005) ). 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_767245] 15% to 20% of the general population have early symptoms, indicative of the disease onset, but without any visible or detectable sign of chronic venous disease (C0s on the CEAP classification) ( Andreozzi, 2006 ).  
A more recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_39034], the Vein Consult Program (VCP), aimed to collect global 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_767246] (CVD) based on the CEAP classification . 
The range of CVD is from no visible or palpable signs of venous disease (C0) to leg ulcers (C6). Having enrolled 91 545 patients worldwide followed by 6232 general practitioners, results showed that the CVD prevalence is high worldwide: 19,7% of C0s (patients reporting symptoms but without objective signs), 21,7% of C1, 17,9% of C2 and 24,3% from C3 to C6, with C0s to C3 stages predominant whatever the country, and confirmed that CVD affects  significant part of the populations worldwide ( Rabe, 2012). 
Patients with chronic venous insufficiency are prone to develop venous leg ulcers in the ankle and the lower leg (Valencia, 2001) . 
The annual prevalence of venous leg ulcer is estimated to be between 1.65% and 1.74% in adults aged 65 years and older (Margolis, 2002)  and this is expected to grow substantially 
during the next several decades. In Europe, the prevalence of leg ulcers varies between 0.2 to 1% of the general population ( (Ruckley, 2000) . Leg ulcer is associated with aging with peak 
prevalence between 60 and 80 years old (Brem, 2003) . In addition, recent studies have shown 
that one percent of the population developed at least one epi[INVESTIGATOR_767247] a life-time with a higher prevalence in the elderly (Ramelet, 20 08). 
Chronic wounds result in high morbidity as treatment of leg ulcers requires frequent visits to dispense topi[INVESTIGATOR_767248], debridement, compression therapy and skingraft and may needs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_767249], mostly leg infections. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_767250], this pathology represents an unresolved clinical problem as healing may be slow or never be achieved in a subset of patients. In addition, leg ulcer is characterized by a high incidence rate of recurrent ulcerations repor ted to be 37% and 48%, 3 and 5 years respectively 
after wound healing (Brem, 2004) .

S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° 4 - Final version  
Chronic venous disease is the result of a multi -factorial pathological process that finally leads 
to venous stasis and profound deterior ation of the microcirculation (Bergan, 2006) .  
Several modifications in the microcirculation are observed in patients suffering from venous 
disease. These modifications are initially characterised by a capi[INVESTIGATOR_767251]. With the evolution of the pathology, a reduced number of functional capi[INVESTIGATOR_767252]/or trappi[INVESTIGATOR_767253], and lymphatic microangiopathy that is characterised by [CONTACT_767333] (Scurr, 1994) . 
The disruption of the microcirculation induces a cascade of events which may explain ulcer forma tion: 1) development of oedema responsible for parenchymal cells ischemia by [CONTACT_767334]; 2) extravasation and degradation of red blood cells leading to hemosiderin deposition; 3) formation of pericapi[INVESTIGATOR_767254]; 4) accumulation 
and adhesion of leukocytes in the dermal matrix and release of toxic metabolites (TNF α), 
proteolytic enzymes (MMPs), and growth factors (TGF -β and its receptor endoglin, FGF -β1, 
VEGF) ((Korthuis, 2000) ; (Perrin, 2011) ; (Raffetto, 2011) ). 
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic factor, enhances 
endothelial proliferation and the vascular permeability in the same time with inducing the expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM -1, VCAM -1 and E -selectin ( (Kim, 2001) , 
(Verbeuren, 2000) ). 
The importance of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has also been discussed due to their involve ment in both inflammatory reaction and cutaneous tissue remodeling. Recent studies 
showed an increased exp ression of MMP2 in liposc lerotic  skin (Tarlton, 1999)   
Venous hypertension is responsible for the progression of the inflammatory cascade. An inflammatory process is triggered when there is an increased adhesion of circulating leukocytes to the vascular endothelium ( (Jacob, 2002) ; (Howlader, 2003) ; (Kappelmayer, 
2004) ) leading to the release of inflammatory mediators. Leukocyte involvement in the 
process of chronic venous disease (CVD) is supported by [CONTACT_767335] “leukocyte 
trappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]”. It refers to the leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and its migration through the altered endothelium of venous wall and venous valve, possibly leading to valve incompetence and reflux (Bergan, 2007) . 
Leukocyte activation is followed by [CONTACT_767336], prostaglandins, bradykinin, free oxygen radicals and cytokines. Cytokines act to regulate and perpetuate the inflammatory rea ction and thus leading to 
delayed re-epi[INVESTIGATOR_767255].  
In addition, prolonged inflammation generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 
[CONTACT_767337]. Mechanical 
stress also promotes the inflammatory response by [CONTACT_767338]-
inflammatory molecules, such as monocyte chemo -attractant protein -1 (MCP -1), endothelin-1 
and ICAM -1 and secondar ily exacerbates ischemia of the surrounding tissue.  
The com bination of all these pathophysiological factors leads to cellular and tissue 
dysfunction resulting in dermal changes such as skin fibrosis and ulceration.

S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° 4 - Final version  
S42909 is a synthetic benzo (b) pyran -4-one derivative proposed for the treatment of venous 
and mixe d leg ulcer s. 
Data available on pharmacology, safety and toxicology on S42909 are detailed in the 
brochure  for clinical investigators. Non -clinical pharmacological studies carried out with 
S42909 show that it could be a potential new medicine in the treatment of chronic venous 
disease. By [CONTACT_767339], S42909 
may represent a powerful leg ulcer treatment.  
Pharmacological properties  of S42909 may be summarised as follows: 
Mechanism of action: S42909 is an inhibitor of leukocyte adhesion to human  endothelial 
cells stimulated with TNF -α, via an inhibition of cell surface adhesion molecules (E -selectin 
and VCAM -1) expression.   
S42909 reduces the oxidative stress through the inhibition of the vascular NADPH oxidase 
activity. It also decreases the expression of the markers of endothelial cell dysfunction (PAI -
1) in HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) and MMP -2 activity in venous smooth 
muscle cells from varicose veins . S42909 shares its pharmacology properties with two of its 
glucuronides, S45015 and S45236. 
 Microcirculation:  
S42909 inhibits hyperpermeability and leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells 
induced by [CONTACT_114273]/reperfusion in the microcirculation of the hams ter cheek pouch. 
It protects the microcirculation against ischemic damage and presents an anti- oedema 
activity in mice and dogs.  
 Venous reactivity:  
In rabbits, S42909 prevents the vasodilatation in a pathological model and reinforces 
the saphenous vein constriction in response to noradrenaline.  
 Lymphatic vessels:  
In rats, S42909 reinforces the contractility of the mesenteric lymphatic vessels which 
should result in an increase in lymphatic flow. 
 Healing of ischemia -reperfusion ulceration: 
In a rat model of cutaneous ulcer, S42909 significantly reduces the intensity of 
ulceration at macro - and microscopic levels and decreases time to heal.  
Pharmacokinetics and metabolism in humans  
In clinical and non -clinical studies, the absolute bioavailability of S42909 is low after oral 
administration; however, the rate and extent of absorption was markedly improved by [CONTACT_767340]- enhancing formulations. 
After single oral administration of S42909 (Formulation R, formulation to be used in this 
study ), tmax is observed between 3.0 and 4.5 h. UGT -mediated metabolism occurs in the 
intestine and/or the liver lead ing to two mono- glucuronides (S45015, S45236) and a di -
glucuronide (S55113). The non- clinical data regarding metabolism and drug elimination was 
confirmed in the human excretion- balance study (PKH -[ZIP_CODE]- 005) in which the majority of 
the radioactivity was recovered in faeces (94% of the dose) and less than 0.1% of the radioactivity was excreted in urine. S42909 and its three metabolites suffice to ac count for the 
total radioactivity in plasma. The highest C
max and exposures are reached for S [ZIP_CODE].

S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° 4 - Final version  
Overall, after single oral administration of S42909 (in fasting conditions) in young healthy 
male volunteers, the data suggest a more than proportional increase in exposure with the dose 
for both S42909 and S45015 and less than the proportional with the dose for S45236.  
After repeated oral administration of S42909, steady -state is reached by [CONTACT_2006] 4, with no 
accumulation of the parent drug after 10 days of repeated administration of S42909 at 600, 
1200 and 1800 mg ( with standard meals) . Food intake ( High Fat High Calorie ( HFHC ) or 
standard breakfast) increases Cmax and exposure for S42909 and S45015. S45236 C max and 
exposure are decreased at [ADDRESS_1052027].  
Results of one combined study (PKH -[ZIP_CODE]- 003) investigating the S42909 drug- drug 
interactions with a CYP2C9 substrate (warfarin) and with a CYP3A4 substrate (midazolam) 
showed that S42909 at the dose of [ADDRESS_1052028] been enrolled into the S42909 clinical studies; out of these,  [ADDRESS_1052029] one administration of S42909.  
S42909 was administered in doses ranging from: 
• 105 mg to 840 mg in oral single dose administration and 210 mg to 630 mg in oral 
repeated dose administration for periods between 5 and up to 14 days, in the Gelucire® 44/14 formulation (currently discontinued), 
• 600 mg/day to 2100 mg/day in single oral dose administration and repeated dose 
administration with the newly developed formulation for [ADDRESS_1052030] of the CL1-[ZIP_CODE]- 013 dose -escalation study, diarrheic epi[INVESTIGATOR_767256] 1200 mg of S42909.

Study design and population  
This study will be a parallel group, dose -finding study. 204 participants with an active venous 
leg ulcer (CEAP C6 classification) occuring in the presence of documented pure venous 
disease in a limb with 0.8 ≤ Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) ≤ 1.3 and no other significant medical disease preventing the use of high compression therapy ( Position 
Document EWMA, 2003)  will be included.  
The participants will be randomised into one dose group or placebo group. The placebo arm 
will allow the evaluat ion of the effect of treatment in addition to the standard existing therapy.  
Participants will be treated on top of the standard of care in all t reatment arms with 
compression and local wound care. Compression therapy is the current standard treatment for venous ulcers. Compression is directed at lowering venous hyperpressure. Numerous studies have confirmed that the proportion of complete ulcer healing is improved when high 
compression is used (O'Meara, 2012) . To apply uniform standard care procedures, high 
compression stockings (approximately 45  mmHg working pressure) with individually 
adapted -sizes will be provided to all participants selected in the study.  
Justification of the treatments, doses to be administrated  
The d ose selection was based on the safety and pharmacokinetic data from Phase 1 studies. 
Considering the variability in exposure of the parent compound and its metabolites and in 
order to avoid overlap of exposure between dose groups a factor 2 between two consecutive doses has been chosen (except for the last step). Consequently the doses to be investigated in this study will be 100, 200, 400, [ADDRESS_1052031] dose of S42909 to be administrated during this study will be 1200 mg/day as this 
dose was administrated in the CL1-[ZIP_CODE]- [ADDRESS_1052032] on drug absorption (CL1-[ZIP_CODE]- 013), the IMP 
treatment will be taken at the end of the meals.  
Participants will start a 14 -days placebo selection  treatment period to check their compliance

Efficacy assessment  
The evaluation of therapeutic response in patients with venous leg ulcers is difficult due to the long time needed to observe complete wound healing. 
Whereas the complete healing remains the final goal for treating these patients (Guidance 
FDA, 2006) , it would be of a great value to clinicians as well as to patients to have a reliable 
estimate  of the  time to total healing based on early progress in a given treatment regimen. 
This is especially important for chronic leg ulcer s where the expected healing time with  
standard care may be [ADDRESS_1052034] practice for the treatment of 
chronic wounds includes monitoring of the wound size at regular intervals. 
A reliable qualification of the percentage of change in wound area over time is a significant 
prognostic measure of complete healing (Kantor , 2000) . A study using a large cohort of 
venous leg ulcer patients has demonstrated that the percentage of change in wound area after 4 weeks of treatment can be a valid surrogate marker of healing at 12 or 24 weeks of care (Gelfand, 2002) .  
Consequently, in the current study, the primary efficacy endpoint will be the relative reduction of the reference ulcer area after 4 weeks of treatment. In order to establish a dose-response relationship between S42909 and the relative reduction of ulcer area, the  “MCP -
Mod” statistical methodology (Bretz and Al, 2005)  will be applied. Based on a set of 
candidate models, the existence of an overall dose- response relationship will be assessed and, 
if observed, the best model will be used, after re-estimation of parameters and convergence, to evaluate the dose window able to produce a clinically significant effect.  
Measurements of the ulcer area will be performed using a 3D imaging device and the accomp anying software. The same equipment will be provided to all centres in order to 
standardize the ulcer measurement methodology: images will be recorded using the same type of camera with automatic adjustment of light, focus and color reproduction according to distance to the ulcer and measurements will be performed centrally on the provided images. 
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice and the 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
3. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
The p urpose of this study is to investigate if S42909 at any dose has an effect on healing of 
venous leg ulcer (proof of concept) and to explore the relationship between dose and effect of S42909 on venous leg ulcer healing on top of standardized compression and local wound 
care.  
Assessment of efficacy will be performed on the relative reduction of the reference ulcer area 
after 4 weeks of treatment as compared to baseline using a digital 3D imaging device , a

­ To assess the safety profile of each tested dose of S42909 (adverse events, laboratory 
parameters, physical examination, body weight, vital signs (blood pressure , heart rate), 6 or 
12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). and standard urinalysis). 
­ To assess the pharmacokinetics of S42909 and its metabolites in patients after repeated 
administration of S42909. 
3.3. Additional  objectives  
­ To assess any potential PK/PD relationsh ip (mainly on improving healing of venous leg 
ulcers and pain related to venous leg ulcer).  
­ Genomic assessment of S42909: 
• To evaluate potential associations between polymorphisms in relevant genes and the 
pharmacokinetics of S42909. 
• To identify subgroups of patients with genomic susceptibility to develop non healing venous leg ulcer or to identify novel genes that may play a critical role in the treatment response  
­ To collect the blood non genomic biomarkers which can be related to venous leg ulcer 
healing,  underlying chronic venous disease, response to S42909 treatment (bio- collection 
in a bio-repository).

4.2.1. Study plan  
This is a phase IIa, prospective, international, multicentre, randomised, double- blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel group, dose-finding study in patients with venous leg ulcer.  
The study will consist of 3 periods as follows: 
­ A selection  period of [ADDRESS_1052036] of care will be changed to 
standardized compr ession and local wound care with sterile saline solution  or sterile water  
and “non active” dressings. 
­ A double -blind controlled period of 42 days: 6 weeks of treatment with one dose of 
S42909 or placebo on top of standardized compression and wound local ca re. 
­ A follow -up period of [ADDRESS_1052037] dose of S42909 
(from W006 to W008). 
An Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) will be set up for participant selection/inclusion randomisation and allocations of the therapeutic units pack numbers. 
About [ADDRESS_1052038] one active 
venous ulcer matching with the selection criteria (CEAP classification C6 stage) will be 
selected at the selection visit ( ASSE ) to include [ADDRESS_1052039] to be performed during ASSE or the placebo selection  period

S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° [ADDRESS_1052040] the results before inclusion and allow verification of compliance  with the 
inclusion criteria. If data of the duplex ultrasonography report performed in the previous 6 
months doesn’t permit to fill in the e -CRF and/or to rule out an acute venous thrombosis, a 
duplex ultrasonography must be performed before inclusion. The presence of a peripheral 
arterial component of the d isease must be ruled out by [CONTACT_767343] -
brachial pressure index (ABPI) ideally by [CONTACT_767344], otherwise by [CONTACT_376510] (see Appendix 5) before applying high level compression (Mosti, 2009) .  
During the selection visit (ASSE), one Reference Ulcer (RU) defined as the largest ulcer in 
size that is fitting the area selection criteria will be established for each participant.  
At ASSE vi sit, the clinical aspect of the RU will be documented by [CONTACT_767345]. The investigator (or a designated person) will take two [ADDRESS_1052041] pi[INVESTIGATOR_767259] a second pi[INVESTIGATOR_767233]. In 
addition, only at ASSE, the investigator will take a 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767260], fully covering the gaiter area.  The 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767261] a secured website 
and recorded using a standardized procedure. From W000 to W008, 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767262]. The same procedure will be used to send the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_767263]. The investigators (or a de signated  person) will be trained 
to use the device.  
The investigator or a designee will use a transparent sheet that will be provided to trace the 
RU outlines and measure the RU area at the selection visit after clean sing and debridement . 
The investigator or designated person will record the measured RU area of this outline and 
check that the area is fitting the selection criteria. The selection will be based on the  
investigator’s RU area measurement and the compliance with the selection/non selection criteria.  
The participants successfully selected will start the selection  period and will be switched from 
their current pharmacological and/or local treatment (if any)  for venous leg ulcer to 
standardized compression stockings provided to the sites and local wound care with sterile 
saline solution  or sterile water , “non- active” dressings ( see section  4.4.1). They will be given 
the placebo se lection  treatment for a period of fourteen days. Prior to first dispensation  
supply , the participants will be trained on the use of stockings. 
The RU area will also be centrally measured by [CONTACT_767346] 3 working days following the selection visit an d the measurement will be sent back to the investigator. The p icture  
performed at selection  after cleansing and debridement will be the reference for measurement  
of changes between the selection (ASSE) and inclusion (W000) pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]. 
Following the selection , an independent expert will review centrally the clinical aspect of RU. 
The expert will give an opi[INVESTIGATOR_767264]. The review will be  based on the clinical analysis of the two 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767265] (or a designated person) at selection visit ( before and after clean sing and 
debridement). In addition, the expert will also review the 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767266], taken at the selection  visit. The expert will confirm the sele ction if RU clinical 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_767267] a venous aetiology , or give a recommendation  for study 
continuation. In case of doubt on the venous aetiology of the ulcer, the expert can send the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_767268].

S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° 4 - Final version  
If the central measurement of the RU area is not fitting the RU area selection criteria and/ or if 
the RU clinical aspect is not suitable for the study according to the independent expert, the 
participant who has been selected must be withdrawn before inclusion in the double-blind 
phase of the study. 
Three (or four)  working days before the inclusion visit (W000)  at the latest , the participants 
will come to the site for a RU pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] : after wound cleansing and debridement, the 
investigator  (or a designated person) will tak e a 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767269] 3D 
imaging device provided to the site and upload this pi[INVESTIGATOR_767270] a secured 
website for central review. As the local wound care is done at the same time , he will also 
perform RU clinical assessment, and pain  will be assessed by [CONTACT_767347] W000 visit.  
In case of persistent doubt after double review of  the pi[INVESTIGATOR_767271] , the 
independent expert will re check the features of the RU  and its venous aetiology with the help 
of the 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767272] . The result of the independent expert review 
will be given within  three working days. I f the doubt persists at the review of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_767273] , the patient will not be included .  
The CRO in charge of the central reading of pi[INVESTIGATOR_767274] W000 and send it back to the investigator within 3 working days together with the 
central RU area measured at ASSE and the change between ASSE and W000 area measurements.  
At the end of the placeb o selection  period, participants will return to the investigator site for 
inclusion visit and randomisation (W000).  
At W000, the investigator will check that the RU area measured centrally at ASSE is 
consistent with his /her measurement , that independent e xpert s validation is done, and will re 
check the selection criteria.  
­ If the central measurement of ASSE RU area is not fitting the selection criteria, the 
participant will not be included.  
­ If the central measurement of ASSE RU area confirm the RU area selection criteria, the 
investigato r will check that the participant complies with the inclusion criteria, the 
recommendations for compression (stockings wearing ≥ 80% of the time according to diary information) and is compliant with placebo selection  treatment (between 80 and 
120%). The relative change of RU area compared with the RU area measured at ASSE 
visit must be less or equal to 20% in order for the participant to be eligible for inclusion. This relative change calculated centrally will be used to check the compliance with the 
inclus ion criteria.  
­ Patients f ound to be eligible for randomisation will have a 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767275] W000, taken after randomis ation and after wound bed preparation. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] (W000-
B) will be the baseline measure for comparison with all subseq uent pi[INVESTIGATOR_767276].  
All particip ants found to be eligible for inclusion will be randomised to one of the following 
six groups - S42909 100, 200, 400, 800 or 1200 mg per day - or placebo. The randomi sation 
will be performed using a cent ralised, dynamic, balanced with 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio, stratified 
randomisation according to the country , a combined prognosis criteri on (age and size of ulcer, 
using the RU area measured centrally at W000), and diabetic status (yes/no)  by [CONTACT_8784] . 
For strati fication purposes, will be considered diabetic patients  those with an already

confirmed diagnosis of diabetes as well as previously unknown diabetic patients  with a 
fasting blood sugar ≥ 7mmol/L and/or an elevated HbA1c  value between 6.5 and 8% on pre - 
inclusion laboratory results. 
The participants will enter a [ADDRESS_1052042] of 
care (standardized compression and local wound care with sterile saline solution or sterile 
water  and “non -active” dressing) followed by a 2-weeks follow -up period with standard of 
care only. During this period the participants will return to the investigator’s site for 
intermediate visits after one week (W001), two weeks (W002), three weeks (W003), four weeks (W004), six weeks (W006) and eight weeks (W008). Participants will continue to 
receive standardized compression therapy and local wound care (sterile saline solution or 
sterile water  and “non- active” dressing) until the end of the study (W008). At W000, W004 
and W006 visits, pain assessment will be performed at the beginning of the visit using a questionnaire with VAS. At each visit, the clinical features of the RU will be recorded and a 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767277]. All 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767278], measurement of ulcer area, perimeter and volume 
for the primary and secondary endpoints of the study. 
Four PK samples will be taken at W000, W004 and W006 visits and one predose PK sample will be taken at W001 and W002 visits in all participants. The participants who agreed to 
participate in the optional  PK analysis in participating centres ( 7 patients per dose group) will 
have 9 PK samples collected over 12 hours at W000 visit and 13 PK samples collected over 
24 hours at the W004 visit instead of the 4 PK samples. 
At each visit general compliance with standardized compression will be checked and size of 
the stockings will be adjusted, if needed. The participant should be explained that the standardized compression stockings should be worn everyday and used according to the recommendations given by [CONTACT_093].  
­ If complete healing of the reference ulcer is observed during the study conduct but other 
ulcers are still open, the participant will keep the same standardized comp ression until 
complete healing of all ulcers is observed or until the end of the study and will continue to 
take IMP treatment until W006 visit.  
­ If complete healing of all ulcers (including the reference ulcer) is observed, the participant will keep the s ame standardized compression until the end of the study or be switched to a 
compression for leg ulcer recurrence prevention (> 18 mmHg) if the participant refuses (this type of compression will not be provided to the sites). The participant will continue t o 
take the study drug until W006. 
The end -of-study visit is scheduled to take place at W008 or, in case of prematurely 
withdrawn participants as soon as possible, after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_767279], or after the last IMP intake. In case of premature withdrawal, the next expected 
visit will be performed . If the next  expected visit is W003, biochemistry and haematology 
should be added to the assessments to be performed during this visit.   
An electronic case report form (e-CRF) will be used for data capture during the study. The study plan is shown in Figure  (4.2.1) 1.

For further practical details, methods of measurement are provided in sections 7, 8 and  9. 
4.3. Measures to minimise bias  
The following measures are taken to  avoid or minimise bias: 
­ This is a double-blind study. 
­ All treatments will be identical to protect the blinding for the participants and the 
investigators.  
- All tablets of S42909 or its placebo will be identical in form and appearance 
- Packaging and labellin g of all treatment groups will be identical 
- The number of tablets will be identical for all groups 
­ Participants will be distributed within each group of treatment equally by a centralised, 
dynamic, balanced with 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio, stratified randomisation according to the country , 
a combined prognosis criteria for venous ulcer healing, and diabetic status .  
­ Participants in the optional PK analysis  will be distributed across treatment arms  
The combined prognosis criteria (size and age of ulcer) are:  
A : ≤  10 cm² and ≤  6 months 
B : > 10 cm² or > 6 months  
­ At the inclusion visit, a centralized randomis ation using the IWRS  will randomly assign 
the participants to one of the six treatment groups. The randomisation algorithm will be 
built by [CONTACT_767348].  
­ The pi[INVESTIGATOR_767283] 3D imaging device in all centres. 
The investigators (or designee ) will be trained in the use of the device.  
­ The area, perimeter and volume measurements of the reference venous leg ulcer will be 
performed centrally by a CRO following the same measurement methodology for all 
patients during the entire study. CRO experts in charge of the central reading will be all 
trained on that methodology. The use of the 3D  imaging device and software standardize 
the reference ulcer measurement methodology.  
4.4. Study products and blinding systems  
4.4.1. Products administered  
­ Study drug:  
During the selection period (from ASSE to W000), the participant will receive  placebo  
selection  oral treatment.  
During the double- blind treatment period (from W000 to W006), the participant will be 
treated with one of the 5 oral doses of S42909 or placebo.  
At W006, the participants will stop the IMP treatment until the end of the follow -up period 
(W008). The standardized compression with the local wound care applied during the study 
will be continued. 
The tablets of placebo and S42909 (dosages 50 and 200 mg) will have identical appearance. The regimen will be 3 tablets twice a day taken at the end of the meals (3 tablets taken in the 
morning and 3 tablets in the evening) with a glass of water (250 ml ). 3 tablets twice a day are 
necessary to reach each of the 5 doses used in the study and keep the blind for all participants.

The labelling of packages complies with the regulatory requirements of each country involved 
in the study, as well as the recommendations in appendix 13 of the European Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice ( http://ec.europa.eu/health//sites/health/files/files/eudralex/vol-
4/2009_06_annex13.pdf) and with US recommendations  
(http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm064971.htm). 
­ Standardized compression and local wound care:  
Standardized compression (compression stockings) will be provided to all participants 
according to the leg measurement chart and will be applied throughout the study (from ASSE to W008). The participants will be trained by [CONTACT_767349]. 
The compression stocking kit  provid ed consist s of two understockings and one overstocking. 
The materials of the compression understocking are polyamide, elastane, and cotton, and the 
materials of the compression overstocking are polyamide, elastodiene, and cotton. The 
understocking is first applied on the leg up to the knee over the dressings protecting the ulcer and has to be worn 24/7.  The overstocking is then applied over the understocking during the 
day and must be removed during the night.

S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° [ADDRESS_1052047] to be worn for one day and then be washed to recover the i nitial 
compression properties. That is why two understockings and one overstocking will be 
provided to each participant. 
The cleansing of the wound should only be done with sterile saline solution or sterile water . 
No antiseptic solution (e.g. Prontosan® –betaine/polyhexanide, Chlorexidine) is allowed 
during the study conduct (from ASSE to W008). 
The debridement should only be mechanical (except wet -to-dry gauze dressings ): only Stiefel 
curette and spoon are allowed . Local anaesthetics are allowed for the d ebridement. Autolytic, 
enzymatic, absorptive dressings, surgical and shaved debridement are not allowed.  
The primary dressings usually used at the site and adequate for the ulcer will be applied 
taking into account that “active” dressings are not allowed during the study (e.g. silver dressings, NOSF -nano- OligoSaccharide Factor - dressings, ibuprofen dressings)  and that t he 
dressing to be applied are: hydrogel for dry wounds, hydrocellular foam dressing for normal 
or exudative wounds and alginate dressing for very exudative wounds, or bleeding wound or  fibrinous wound. 
4.4.2. Treatment  management 
­ IMP management : 
Manufacturing, packaging, labelling and dispatching of the IMP to the sites will be the 
responsibility of Les Laboratoires Servier Industrie - Clinical Su pply Unit (CSU) (905 Route 
de Saran, [ZIP_CODE] Gidy, [LOCATION_009]). 
The investigator and/or the person assigned by [CONTACT_767350]/or the pharmacist of the healthcare 
institution are responsible for the treatment management (receipt, storage, dispensing , 
accountability).  
IMPs will be stored at controlled temperature according to the specifications given by [CONTACT_767351] a dry and secure room with restricted access , under the 
investigator’s or designated person responsibility.  
IMP management will b e verified on a regular basis by [CONTACT_11200]. 
At reception of IMPs , the responsible person must return as soon as possible the 
acknowledgment of receipt, duly completed and signed to the address given on the document and contact [CONTACT_767352] t herapeutic units receipt as the system will ensure the 
stock accountability  and automatic restock. All defects or damaged IMP must be declared to 
IWRS by [CONTACT_767353]. 
The investigator/pharmacist is responsible for the IMP temperature monitoring  on a daily 
basis with the recording of Min- Max temperature every working day and the documentation 
in a temperature log sheet.  
In case of temperature deviation s the investigator/pharmacist should immediately:  
 Block the concerned IMPs in IWRS and place them in quarantine,  
 Alert the monitor or the local project manager if the monitor is absent, forward 
him/her all required information and follow the instructions received. 
Furthermore the investigator/pharmacist must put in place an adequate action plan once  the 
first temperature deviation occurs in order to avoid recurrence.

S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° 4 - Final version  
The IMP boxes will be allocated by [CONTACT_767354] s included in IWRS 
manual and IWRS connections will be performed at ASSE, W000, W002, W004 visits (for 
the descriptio n of dispensing methods, refer to section  6.2 ( Treatment dispensing).  
The investigator and/or the pharmacist of the healthcare institution should only use the 
treatment provided for the participants involved in the study. The participants must return all unused study drugs to the site.  
The investigator and/or the pharmacist of the medical institution and/or a designated person 
from their study team must complete in real time all documents provided by [CONTACT_767355]  
 IMP receipt, allocation and dispensing to the participants and study drugs 
returned by [CONTACT_767356] a therapeutic unit tracking form or equivalent form in the centre. Therapeutic unit tracking form  (or equivalent 
form in the centre) is the source document to be completed.  
 IMP dispensing and return will also be recorded in the e- CRF.  
The detachable portion of the label on the IMP box must be affixed on a treatment label 
collection form by [CONTACT_767357] . 
The investigator will notify the monitor of all complaints set out by a participant within 24 hours (change of taste, appearance…).  
Remaining IMPs at site will be collected by [CONTACT_767358] a storage or 
destruction site. A tracking form for the recovery and destruction of the IMPs must be 
completed and attached to the remaining IMPs sent for destruction. 
In the event of anticipated return of IMPs  to the sponsor (batch  recall), the sponsor will 
prepare an information letter intended for the investigator and/or pharmacist of the medical institution. This letter will be sent to each study centre by [CONTACT_767359]. On receipt of the letter, the investigator and/or the pharmacist will identify the participants in possession of the IMP at the moment the incident becomes known, by [CONTACT_2329], 
among other tools, the therapeutic unit tracking form, and will contact [CONTACT_384523].  
­ Standardized compress ion management 
Stockings receipt, allocation and dispensing to the participants will be managed by [CONTACT_2924] (or a delegated person) . 
4.4.3. Management of blinding systems 
The blind for any study participant should only be broken by [CONTACT_767360]. 
The circumstances under wh ich the blind may be broken are: 
 When the knowledge of the treatment allocation will influence the participant 
management. For example, after o verdose of study treatment, or 
 When the outcome of a life -threatening medical emergency depends on knowing 
which treatment the participant has received .

S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° 4 - Final version  
In the cases where the study treatment blind needs to be broken by [CONTACT_767361], a centralised decoding system integrated to IWRS is 
adopted for the study. No sealed envelopes will be used. 
The centralised decoding procedure will be performed by [CONTACT_767362]. The system will be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
The procedure to be followed is detailed in the IWRS manual. If IWRS is not available, the helpdesk of the IWRS will be contact[CONTACT_767363]. Additionally, decoding will be possible by [CONTACT_767364] ([PHONE_8487] 60 00) available [ADDRESS_1052048] the subjects at undue risk if they were to continue in the study. 
After having informed the investigator //coordinator , the sponsor or the investigator/

the double-blind period of the study and randomis ed to a treatment group. 
5.5. Additional information recorded at the selection/inclusion visit  
If not already present at the selection visit, the participant will be scheduled for a full set of 
investigations including imaging an d functional diagnostic tests to document the pre- existence 
of venous disease (duplex ultrasonography  …). The results not available at the selection visit 
need to be available and reviewed before the inclusion visit. The ethnic origin  of participants 
will also be collected to confirm that participants are Caucasian.

5.6.2. Procedure  
­ The investigator must record in the medical file and in the electronic case report form, the 
reason and the time for the premature discontinuation of treatment / for the withdrawal 
from the study, the main assessment criteria, and the medical follow -up data.  
­ If there are several reasons, the investigator must indicate the main reason. An end -of-
study visit should always be suggested to the participant and when it should be scheduled (at the same time as the date of discontinuation of treatment, at the theoretical end -of-study 
date…).  
­ In the case of premature withdrawal from the study due to an adverse event (event requiring immediate notification or not), the investigator must make every effort to collect the information related to the outcome of the event. If necessary, the information will be 
collected afterwards (see section  [IP_ADDRESS]) . This information is recorded in that part of the 
electronic case report form which concerns adverse events. If the investigator cannot collect the information from a visit, he must collect it from the physician ensuring the 
follow-up of the participant. 
­ If the study is stopped / IMP is discontinued as a res ult of an event requiring immediate 
notification, the procedure described in section [IP_ADDRESS] i s to be implemented.  
­ Treatment discontinuation or withdrawal from the study is to be documented by [CONTACT_767367] e- CRF. The investigator or a designated person 
must connect to the IWRS to perform the withdrawal visit in case of  treatment 
discontinuation or withdrawal of the participant from the study. 
The dispositions to be taken after the IMP discontinuation ar e described in  section  6.5. 
5.6.3. Lost to follow- up 
When the investigator has no news of the participant, he/she must make every effort to contact [CONTACT_12552]/her or a person around him/her (phone calls, letters including reg istered 
ones…etc.), to establish the reason for the discontinuation of the IMP and to suggest the 
participant comes to an end-of- study visit. If all these attempts to contact [CONTACT_565407],

the investigator can then declare the participant “lost to follow- up”. The investigator should 
document all these attempts in the corresponding medical file.  
6. TREATMENT OF PARTICI PANTS  
6.1. IMPs administered  
There are three periods in the study  
­ Placebo selection  period of 14 days ± 2 days: 
During this period, the partic ipants will take orally 3 placebo tablets twice a day at the end of 
the meals with a glass of water (250 ml): [ADDRESS_1052061] and 3 placebo tablets in the evening at the end of the dinner. 
In addition, all participants will be provided with standardized compression (compression 
stockings) adapted to their leg size. The adequate size of the stockings will be chosen according to leg measurements and the leg measurement chart. If applicable, the participant will dis continue his/her usual compression treatment. 
The stockings kit consists of two understockings and one overstocking. The understocking is 
applied on the leg up to the knee over the dressings protecting the ulcer. The overstocking is applied over the understocking. The participant has to wear both during the day and must remove the overstocking during the night, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_767291] 
24/[ADDRESS_1052062]  to be worn one day and then 
washed t o recover the initial compression properties. Two understockings and one 
overstocking w ith the same size will be provided to the participants. So, the participants will 
be able to wear one understocking over the night  while the used overstocking and the  other 
understocking are  washed and dried  overnight to be used the following day. The investigator  
may dispense additional compression stocking kits (of the same size) to the patients if needed to maintain daily compliance with compression therapy.  
The participant has to complete  a diary on the days he/she is wearing the compression 
stockings. 
­ Randomised double -blind active treatment period of 42 days ± 4 days, from W000 to 
W006: 
At W000, after verification of the participant’s inclusion criteria and compliance with 
selection  treatment and compression, the participant will be randomly assigned to one of the 
six treatment arms.  
During this period, the participants will take orally 3 tablets twice a day at the end of the 
meals with a glass of water (250 ml or 8 o unces ): [ADDRESS_1052063] and 3 tablets in the evening at the end of dinner of S42909 ( a total of 100, 200, 400, 
800 or 1200 mg  daily ) or placebo. Tablets of 0, 50 and 200 mg of strength of S42909 will be 
used to reach each d ose. The packaging will ensure that the 3 tablets to be taken by [CONTACT_767368]. This will be clearly explained in the 
participant’s diary.

S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° 4 - Final version  
The measurements of the leg will be done at each visit and the stockings size w ill be 
confirmed or changed according to these measurements.  
On the day of visits W000, W001, W002, W004 and W006, the participant will omit the 
morning IMP intake and will come to the study visit under fasting condition (10 hours). The participant will ta ke the assigned IMP treatment with a glass of water (250 ml or 8 ounces ) 
during the study visit after the predose PK sampling and at the end of breakfast.  
­ Follow-up period of 14 days ± 4 days, from W006 (at D0 + 42 days ± 4 days) to W008: 
On the day of the W006 visit, the participant will omit the morning IMP intake and will come 
to the study visit under fasting condition (10 hours). The participant will take the morning IMP intake during the study visit at the end of the breakfa st with a glass of water (2 50 ml  or 8 
ounces ), will the stop taking the IMP treatment and give the TU box back to the investigator.  
During this period, participants will continue with standardized compression therapy and the local wound care up to end of study visit (W008).  
After t he end -of-study visit, the investigator will decide on continuation of leg ulcer treatment 
according to the centre’s  standard of care.  
6.2. IMPs dispensing  
Therapeutic unit (TU) will be identified by a [ADDRESS_1052064]  or a designated person, 
according to the local organisation, as follows: 
- At the selection visit (ASSE): [ADDRESS_1052065] to IWRS at the selection visit to register the participa nt, create a 
participant’s number and register the selection. Then, the system will allocate a selection  kit 
number. The box corresponding to the kit number will be dispensed to the participant.  
Moreover, the participants will be provided with 1 stocking kit (containing 2 understockings and 1 overstocking)  of the adequate size. The adequate size of the stockings will be chosen 
according to leg measurements  and the leg measurement chart.  
- At the inclusion visit (W000):  
After verification of the participant’ s inclusion criteria and compliance with selection  
treatment and compression, the investigator will connect to the IWRS. The system will allocate to the participant the therapeutic unit (TU) number corresponding to the treatment group randomised (placebo or S42909 100, 200, 400, 800 or 1200 mg). The TU box corresponding to the TU number will be given to the participant and will correspond to [ADDRESS_1052066] omit the morning IMP intake before the study

­ Oral and parenteral antibiotherapy during the study, except if less than or equal to 7 days.  
­ NSAIDs on long -term chronic treatment within one month prior to the selection, except if 
taken less than one week within the last month. NSAIDs are not allowed during the study 
except if taken once and not longer than [ADDRESS_1052070] therapeutic unit intake, any treatment interruption if any, will be 
recorded in the e- CRF.  
The number of tablets  dispensed and the number of tablets returned by [CONTACT_767369] a designated person from his/her team and recorded in the electronic case report form . If the participant  does not bring back his TU box and diary, the 
number of tablets taken and number of days when stockings have been applied will be estimated by [CONTACT_767370]. If the information becomes available at a next visit, the data should be corrected.  
The compliance will be assessed at W000, W002, W004 and W006 as therapeutic unit boxes 
are allocated for 2 weeks of treatment.  
The compliance will be calculated on the basis of the ratio between the number of tablets actually taken (and number of days for stockings) and the theoretical number of tablets (or days) required by [CONTACT_767371].  
If the compliance is unsatisfactory during the study (e.g. less than 80% or higher than 120%), 
the participant should be questioned to identify the reason for this and the study objectives should be reminded. Particular importance should be given to possible occurrence of adverse event.  
The investigator should particularly assess the compliance of treatment and stockings at W000 visit to check the related non-inclusion criteria.  
The compliance of stockings should also be assessed at each visit. Each participant must record the days he/she is wearing the stockings in a diary provided by [CONTACT_767372] r ecorded in the e-CRF . If the compliance of stockings is less than 
80%, the participant must be retrained and motivated. 
6.5. Arrangements after the discontinuation of the IMP  
After the discontinuation of the IMP, the participant will have access to appropriate medical 
care by [CONTACT_542883] .  
The treatment chosen after the end of the study or study withdrawal will be prescribed by 
[CONTACT_5657]/her physician  according to the centre standard of care. The study drug is not licensed and 
will not be available outside of the scope of the study .

- Reference Ulcer area  
At the selection visit (ASSE), the eligibility will be determined on the Reference Ulcer (RU) 
area based on the measurements performed by [CONTACT_093] . This measurement will also be 
done centrally on the 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767293]  (or a delegated person) at  the 
selection  visit (ASSE) . The latest will determine the final eligibility in case of discrepancy 
between the investigator and the central measurement . 
For the inclusion visit (W000), the RU area measurement will be performed centrally on a 3D 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_747667] 3 (or 4) working days before W000 visit. Additionally, patients found to be 
eligible for randomis ation will have a 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767235] W000, after 
randomisation, for baseline measurements . 
At W001, W002, W003, W004, W006 and W008, the RU area measurement will be 
performed centrally on a 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767294] (or a 
delegated person) during the study visits.  
- Reference Ulcer perimeter  
The perimeter will be measured centrally at each study visit (ASSE, W000, W001, W002, W003, W004, W006 and W008) on the 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767295]  (or a delegated person) . The perimeter measured will be used to calculate the 
linear advance of the wound margin towards the wound centre. 
- Reference Ulcer volume  
The volume will be measured centrally at each study visit (ASSE, W000, W001, W002, W003, W004, W006 and W008) on the 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767295]  (or a delegated person) . 
- Pain assessment  
The pain related to the leg ulcer will be assessed at W00 0, W004 and W006 visits using a 
questionnaire which includes a VAS scale (See Appendix 9: Questionnaire for pain assessment ).  
- Analgesic drug consumption  
Analgesic drug consumption related to the leg ulcer will be  assessed at W000, W004 and 
W006 with the help of the concomitant treatment form. This assessment will be done in term 
of daily dose and duration. 
- Clinical assessment  
A clinical assessment of the RU will be performed at ASSE, W000, W001, W002, W003, W004, W006 and W008 visits by [CONTACT_093] (See Appendix 10 - Clinical Assessment of

Area Change W0-ASSE= │Reference Ulcer Area W000 – Reference Ulcer Area ASSE│ / RU 
Area ASSE . (Reference Ulcer Area ASSE is the one after clean sing and debridement). 
Patients f ound to be eligible for randomisation will also have a 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767303] W000 (take n after randomisation) that will be uploaded by [CONTACT_093] (or a 
delegated person) on the secured website to send these pi[INVESTIGATOR_767304] .  
At W001, W002, W003, W004, W006 and W008, the investigator (or a delegated person) will upload the 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_767305].  
In addition to the RU area measurement, the CRO in charge of the central measurement will 
perform volume and perimeter measurements at each visit on the 3D pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] . These measures 
will be used for the efficacy criteria.  
- Pain assessment  
The questionnaire with the VAS will be provided by I.R.I.S and completed at the beginning of 
W000, W004 and W006 visits, before RU clinical assessment and local care of the RU. The participant will draw a vertical line on the scale to reflect his perception on the intensity of the pain since the last visit. The investigator will measure the exact distance from 0 to the line

W006 and W008. It should be measured under the same conditions (i.e. same scale, empty bladder, before breakfast, being only lightly dressed).  
The participant’s height will be measured at the selection visit for participant’s BMI 
calculati on. 
- Vital signs  
Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured at all visits , they  should always be measured 
under the same conditions for each participant during the study (one measure after 10 minutes in the sitting position ). Body temperature will be recorded at all visits  for on -site safety . 
- Standard electrocardiogram  
A standard electrocardiogram ECG ( 6 or 12- lead) will be performed within the 5 calendar  
days prior to W000 visit, with results available at W000 visit (at the latest) before 
randomis ation , to check that there are no clinically significant abnormalities. If the 
investigator does not have the expertise to read ECG tracing s and/or in case of abnormalities , 
the ECG should be verified by a cardiologist prior to the inclusion of the participant in the

S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° [ADDRESS_1052071] with the participant in supi[INVESTIGATOR_12251]. It will be recorded at speed 50 mm/s with 2  cm/mV amplification and with at least [ADDRESS_1052072] the expertise to read ECG tracings  and/or in case of abnormalities , the ECGs should be  
verified by a cardiologist. Any clinically significant abnormality discovered must be recorded 
as an adverse event  in the e -CRF. The following parameters are to be recorded: rhythm, heart 
rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QTc duration and RR interval [ QTc calculated using 
Fridericia formula ( QTcF  = QT / ³√RR)]  
In order to avoid the possible artefacts in the ECG interpr etation (e.g. hysteresis effect in 
which an increase in HR is followed more slowly by [CONTACT_767379] -RR relationship), it is recommended to follow the 
below recommendations:  
 To allow the subject t o be reclining at rest for at least [ADDRESS_1052073] is allowed (TV, vital sign acquisition, blood sampling) as they might have an impact on heart rate. 
 To perform blood sampling a fter the ECG recording when the same time points are 
needed for blood sampling and ECG acquisition. 
- Laboratory assessments  
Local laboratories  will be responsible for analysing the biochemistry and haematology  
samples , FSH, β -HCG. The laboratory will send a  laboratory report to the investigator who 
will be responsible for the clinical assessment of the results  and data entry in the e- CRF . Any 
clinically significant abnormal laboratory value should be recorded as an adverse event in the 
e-CRF. The investigator should follow up all clinically relevant changes until recovery. 
 Biochemistry (within the [ADDRESS_1052074],  W001, W002, W004, W006 and W008 visits): AST (SGOT), 
ALT (SGPT), CPK, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, total bilirubin, total protein, 
albumin, Calcium, Urea, Creatinine, CRP, glucose, Na, K and Cl . The analyses will 
be done under fasting condition (10 hours) . Within the [ADDRESS_1052075] be done for all 
patients except known diabetics  with a result ≤  8% obtained in the 3 months before 
the selection visit.   
 Fasting Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] ( within the [ADDRESS_1052076],  W001, W002, W004, W006 and W008 visits): Triglycerides, 
HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol. The analysis will be done under fasting condition 
(10 hours). 
 Haematology ( within the [ADDRESS_1052077],  W001, W002, W004, W006 and W008 visits):  haemoglobin, 
haematocrit, red blood cells, MCV, MCH, MCHC, platelets, white blood cells, 
lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils and neutrophils (white blood cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils and neutrophils must be assay ed in 
absolute value and enter ed in the e -CRF in this unit) .  For patients under warfarin  or 
phenprocoumon, International Normalized R atio (INR) will be performed at each 
visit (including W003) or more often if judged necessary by [CONTACT_093] .

 Standard urinalysis will be performed  using a dipstick, within the [ADDRESS_1052078],  W004, W006 and W008 
visits by [CONTACT_125078] a delegated person. Urinalysis: pH, proteins, blood, 
leucocytes, bilirubin, ketones bodies, nitrites and glucose. 
 A blood sampling will be performed for β -HCG or FSH analysis ( within the [ADDRESS_1052079] ) to 
diagnose pregnancy and menopause respectively . β-HCG tests will be repeated at  
W004 and W008 visits  for women of child- bearing potential . Depending on the local 
regulation, pregnancy tests can be  additionally repeated throughout the treatment 
period (urinary tests which is not to be entered into e- CRF ). 
8.3. Adverse events  
All adverse events and other situations relevant to the safety of the participants must be 
followed up and fully and precisely documented in order to ensure that the sponsor has the necessary information to continuously assess the benefit -risk balance of the clinical trial.  
The same procedure applies whether the participant receives the test drug or a comparison product (placebo, S42909). 
8.3.1. Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse events  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occur rence in a subject participating in a 
clinical study, whether or not there is a causal relationship with the IMP and/or experimental 
procedures, occurring or detected from the date the participant signs the information and consent form, irrespective of the  period of the study (periods without administration of the 
IMP (e.g. selection  period) are also concerned). 
An adverse event can therefore be:  
- any unfavourable and unintended sign, including an abnormal finding from an additional examination (lab tests, X -rays, ECG, etc.) which is deemed clinically 
relevant by [CONTACT_093] , 
- any symptom or disease,  
- any worsening during the study of a symptom or a disease already present when the participant entered the study (increase in frequency and/or intensity), including the studied pathology, 
and detected during a study visit or at an additional examination or occurred since the previous study visit (including relevant event reported in participant’s diary or safety evaluation scale).  
Of note: 
- Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410762], educational purpose  (e.g. learning of arterial 
hypertension management by [CONTACT_2299]) or routine check -up, and the  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_767306] W004 (participants having signed the  
consent form for the optional PK ana lysis)  should not be considered as an adverse 
event and should not be reported in the e- CRF.  
- The following procedures, whether planned before the study or not, whether leading to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192612], should be reported in the specific page “Procedures  not 
subsequent to an adverse event”  of the e- CRF:  
© ILKOS THERAPEUTIC INC – 05 March  2018 – INT - Confidential    56/120  
S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° 4 - Final version  
 therapeutic procedures related to a non- aggravated medical history (e.g. cataract 
extraction not due to an aggravation of the cataract during the study, haemodialysis 
sessions related to a renal insufficiency not aggravated during the study),  
 prophylactic procedures (e.g. sterilisation, wisdom teeth removal),  
 comfort procedures (e.g. cosmetic surgery),  
 control procedures of a pre -existing condition without aggravation (e.g. colonoscopy 
to control the remission of colon cancer). 
 any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_767307] 
- In the framework of this protocol, local adverse reactions at ulcer site such as pruritus, erythema, pain, discomfort, bleeding, etc., are reactions that are expected to occur in 
normal conditions during the healing process and investigator s should use their 
clinical judgement to discern whether a specific event is falling into this category or not. Expected local adverse reactions should not be reported as advers e events.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious adverse events  
Any adverse event that at, any dose:  
­ results in death, 
­ is life -threatening
(1), 
­ requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
­ is medically significant(2), 
­ results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity(3), 
­ is a congenital anomaly/birth defect(4). 
(1) Life-threatening in this context refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might ha ve caused death if it was 
more severe.  
(2) Any event that might not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], but 
might jeopardise the participant or might require intervention to prevent one of these outcomes (for 
example: oe dema or allergic bronchospasm that required intensive treatment at home, blood dyscrasia, 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], or development of drug dependence or drug abuse). The investigator should exercise his/her scientific and medical j udgement to decide whether or not 
such an event requires expedited reporting to the sponsor. 
(3) Disability/incapacity in this context refers to any event that seriously disrupts the ability of the 
participant to lead a normal life, in other words leads to  a persistent or permanent significant change, 
deterioration, injury or perturbation of the participant's body functions or structure, physical activity and/or quality of life. 
(4) Congenital anomaly or birth defect refers to the exposure to the IMP before  conception (in men or 
women) or during pregnancy that resulted in an adverse outcome in the child.

S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° 4 - Final version  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overdose  
This refers to any intake of a quantity of IMP which is above the maximum dose 
recommended in the study protocol, independently of the occurrence of any adverse event. 
The quantity should be considered per administration or cumulatively regarding the maximum 
dose recommended in the study protocol. For instance, as the study protocol requires two daily administration s, one intake of the planned two daily intakes  at the same time should be 
considered as overdose. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Events requiring an immediate notification (ERIN)  
An event must be notified immediately  (i.e. within 24 hours ) to the sponsor if it is: 
­ a serious adverse event, 
­ an overdose of the IMP even if asymptomatic,  
­ any intake of the IMP by a person around the participant, 
­ a pregnancy.  
8.3.2. Responsibilities of the investigator 
For any adverse event and special situation mentioned above the investigator must: 
­ Note in the participant's medical file  the date on which he/she learned of the event (at a 
follow- up visit or a telephone contact [CONTACT_767380] a third person, …) and any 
other relevant information which he/she has learned of the event,  
­ Report the event to the sponsor  using the AE form (in case of ERIN, the reporting should 
be done immediately),  
­ Evaluate the seriousness, intensity and causality, 
­ Document  the event with additional useful information,  
­ Ensure the follow- up of the event,  
­ Fulfil h is/her regulatory obligations to the Competent Authorities and/or to the IRB/IEC, 
in accordance with local regulations.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Time frame for AE reporting  
Any event meeting the above mentioned definitions (see section  8.3.1
) must be reported to the 
sponsor on an adverse event form  if it occurred:  
­ before the first intake of the test drug, for event associated with any procedure/condition 
required by [CONTACT_4690] : procedure (duplex ultrasonography, ECG, etc.), chang e 
or withdrawal of previous/concomitant treatment relating to the conditions of the protocol.  
­ at any time after the first intake of the test drug  up to the participant’s last study visit for 
all events,  
­ after the participant’s last study visit: 
 up to 30 calendar days after the participant's last study visit for all ERIN, regardless of the supposed role of the research (IMP, or experimental procedure). 
 irrespective of the time of onset after the end of the study in case of serious adverse event related  to the research (IMP, or experimental procedure).

[IP_ADDRESS]. Evaluation of seriousness, intensity and causality 
It is important that the investigator gives his/her own opi[INVESTIGATOR_192614] , the 
intensity  of the event as well as the cause -effect relationship  between an adverse event and 
the IMP. This evaluation must be assessed by [CONTACT_192685]. 
The Seriousness  should be evaluated according to international guidances (see definition 
section  [IP_ADDRESS], in accordance with ICH Topic E2A  and Directive 2001/20/EC of the 
European Parliament and of The Council of 4 April  and 
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/u
cm071696.pdf). 
The Intensity  should be evaluated acco rding to the following rule: 
­ mild: signs or symptoms, easily tolerated, relieved with symptomatic treatment,  
­ moderate: enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity, only partially 
relieved with symptomatic treatment,  
­ severe: incapacity in so me regular activities, not easily relieved with symptomatic 
treatment.  
The causal relationship  to the IMP   must be assessed when reporting the AE in the AE form. 
Only cases ticked "related" by [CONTACT_384542] a reasonabl e suspected causal relationship to the test drug (AE linked to the mechanism of 
action of the test drug…) will be considered as suspected Adverse Drug Reaction. In general, the expression reasonable causal relationship means to convey that there is evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Documentation of the event 
The investigator must ensure that all events are well documented. In particular for ERIN, 
he/she should provide the sponsor, as they become available, with anonymized copi[INVESTIGATOR_767308], such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192616], reports of further consultations, laboratory test reports, reports of other examinations aiding diagnosis (where possible, the results from pre -test drug assessment s should be appended for 
comparison with the results obtained under test drug), or the autopsy report, if autopsy is performed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follow- up of adverse events  
The investigator must ensure that follow -up of the participant is appropriate to the nature of 
the event, and that it continues until resolution if deemed necessary. 
Any change in terms of diagnosis, intensity, seriousness, measures taken, causality or 
outcome regarding an adverse event already reported must be written up in a new complete evaluation of the event documented on the “Adverse event” page previously created for the event  in the  e-CRF . 
If the adverse event has not resolved at the participant's final visit in the study, the participant must be followed up suitably and any information on the outcome of the event will be noted on the « Adverse Event » page previously created for the e vent in the e- CRF . 
If the follow -up of the participant is not done by [CONTACT_192689]/herself (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], 
followed by a specialist or the participant's gen eral practitioner,  etc.), the investigator will do 
everything to establish/maintain contact [CONTACT_192690]/department in charge of follow -up of 
the participant.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Special situations (pregnancy, overdoses, intake of IMP by a person around the participant)  
Pregnancy   
If a female participant in the study becomes pregnant, the investigator must: 
­ stop immediately the IMP,  
­ report it on an « Adverse Event » page as well as on the  specific paper pregnancy form to 
be notified immediately (ERIN),  
­ contribute to the fol low-up of this pregnancy and provide the sponsor with information 
concerning this follow-up  
­ If the partner of a participant becomes pregnant during the course of the study  or within [ADDRESS_1052080] the sponsor (contact [CONTACT_767382]’s study file) who will inform him/her about the procedure to be followed. 
Overdose of IMP  
­ In case of overdose, the investigator should report it on an “Adverse Event” page to be 
notified immediately (ERIN).  
­ Overdose should be followed- up to ensure that the information is as complete as possible

Intake of IMP by a person around the participant .   
This event should not be reported in the e -CRF. The investigator should immediately contact 
[CONTACT_456] (contact [CONTACT_192691]’s study fil e) who will inform him/her 
about the procedure to be followed. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Methods in the e -CRF  
Adverse events must be documented on the « Adverse Event » page of the e- CRF.  
In case of chronic disease:  
­ if the disease is known when the participant enters in the study, only worsening (increased 
frequency and/or intensity of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]/attacks) will be documented as an adverse event,  
­ if the disease is detected during the study and if repeated epi[INVESTIGATOR_192617] a 
chronic disease, the epi[INVESTIGATOR_192618] « Adverse Event » page previously 
created for the event  which will clearly describe the diagnosis.  
In case of gastrointestinal events (such as diarrhoea, loose stools, nausea, flatulence, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, etc.): 
­ the in vestigator will specify, in the “description” area of the AE e- CRF form, the 
circumstances of occurrence, localisation, duration and frequency of the event. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Procedure for an event requiring an immediate notification  
In case of an event requiring an immedi ate notification, the investigator must:  
­ Immediately  after being informed of this event, fill in  the participant's medical file  as 
well as the « Adverse Event » page  of the e -CRF according to the general instructions 
available in the e- CRF, without waiting  for the results of the clinical outcome or of 
additional investigations. When data will be submitted into  Inform , an e- mail will be 
immediately and automatically sent to the sponsor.  
­ Provide the sponsor (person designated in the contact [CONTACT_192691]’s 
study file), as they become available, with anonymized copi[INVESTIGATOR_192619], 
­ Fulfil his/her regulatory obligations to the Competent Authorities and/or to the IRB/IEC, in accordance with lo cal regulations.  
If an adverse event initially judged as non- serious worsens and becomes serious (ERIN), this 
must be reported immediately  on an "Adverse event" page of the e- CRF.  
In case the e- CRF is unavailable when the investigator was informed of the ERIN, he/she 
should: 
­ Immediately  fill in a paper "Adverse event" page:  
- For a serious event on a paper entitled "Adverse event – Initial information" page,

­ As soon as the e -CRF becomes available, the investigator should enter these data in the 
« Adverse Event » page of the e- CRF .  
8.3.3. Responsibilities of the sponsor  
In accordance with international guidances, the assessment of the seriousness and the 
causality of adverse events are usually made by [CONTACT_192693]’s duties, who is responsible for ensuring that  all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
are reported to Competent Authorities and Ethics Committees.  
The sponsor will review the seriousness of the adverse events and the causality of the serious adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_192694]. The causality and the seriousness may be upgraded (but never downgraded). Anonymized copi[INVESTIGATOR_192620], laboratory tests reports, reports of other examination aiding diagnosis may be asked for the event assessment. If the assessments of the investigator and the sponsor are different, both will be reported in the clinical study report. 
Independently of the regulatory obligations of the investigator, the sponsor must report the 
pharmacovigilance data to the appropriate Authorities and to all the investigators involved, according to the requirements stated in ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines and local regulations.

S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° [ADDRESS_1052086] anding of the influence of genomes  between subjects’  differences in drug action has 
occurred.  
Determination of genes influencing the response to a treatment could allow the identification 
of participants having a better response to a given treatment or participants with higher susceptibility to develop adverse events related to a treatment. Identification of these genes could help provide the most suitable therapy to each participant. 
An optional genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_767310]. The objective is mostly to develop the 
knowledge of the impact of genomic  on the ADME parameters and on the pharmacodynamics 
of the test drug. 
Sequencing of the human genome, ident ification of informative genomic  biomarkers such as 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and development of new technologies such as DNA 
arrays have facilitated the study of the genome in a large scale. The use of these technologies facilitates the study of genomics  biomarkers associated with the susceptibility to have a 
disease or to respond to a t reatment and accelerates th e implementation of pharmacogenomics  
studies in drug development. On the other hand, Regulatory Agencies nowadays encourag e 
development of genomic  studies in order to advance the understanding of relationships 
between genotypes and responses to drugs. 
In order to improve the knowledge of S42909 in human (pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics), to better understand the mechanism of response to treatment and to 
determine factors related to the response, a genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_767311]: 
­ identify genes implicated in the S42909 drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and 
excretion and evaluate associations between polymorphisms of relevant genes and 
pharmacokinetics of S42909 and the response to treatment. 
­ identify g enes implicated in the pharmacological target, subgroups of participants with 
genetic susceptibility to develop non- healing venous leg ulcer or to identify novel genes 
that may play a critical role in the treatment response.  
These polymorphisms could be further used as biomarkers of the type of response to 
treatment.  
Candidate genes for gen omic  studies are those implicated in drug absorption and disposition 
(e.g. pharmacokinetics) and drug effects (e.g. pharmacodynamics, drug efficacy and adverse effects) .  
The samples will not be used for any investigations not specified in this protocol or for the elaboration of a DNA bank. 
There will be no communication of individual results neither to the investigator nor to the 
participant.

be selected.  
The “best” fit model  will be chosen by [CONTACT_767389] p -value (the one w ith the stronge st 
statistica l test and gr eater than an appropria te critical value q). 
Secondary analyses:  
- Determination of dose window for the Minimal Effe ctive Dose (MED)  
Using the selected model resulting from the main analysis, a dose window of the Minimal 
Effective Dose (MED) will be estimated, considering an hypothesis of a clinically relevant effect as compared to placebo of 6.5%. 
The parameters of the selected model in the main analysis will be re -assessed and, if the 
model converges, it will be used to estimate the MED. If the model doesn’t converge, the 
second “best” fit model will be used.

authenticity of the data collected in the e -CRF by [CONTACT_121296]/her user name [CONTACT_2383]. 
After the data base lock, the investigator will receive a CD -ROM containing participant data 
of his/her centre for the study file.  
14.2. Data management  
Data are collected via an e- CRF and stored in a secured database.  
For data collected on the e- CRF, the Data & Clinical Logistics of I.R.I.S . is responsible for 
data processing including data validation performed according to a specification manual 
describing the checks to be carried out. As a result of data validation, data may require some changes . An electronic data clarification form is sent to the investigator who is required to 
respond to the query and make any necessary changes to the data.  
For data transferred from the logistical platform, central reading centre of the RU measurements, the Data & Clinical Logistics of I.R.I.S. is responsible for data transfer: centralised laboratory, central reading centre of RU measurements provide electronic transfer of computerised data to the Clinical Data Division of I.R.I.S.

The Medical Data Department of I.R.I.S . is responsible for data coding including: 
­ medical / surgical history, adverse events and procedures using MedDRA   
­ medications using WHO- DD. 
The coding process is described in a specification manual.  
When data validation is achieved, a blind review of the data is performed according to the 
sponsor standard operating procedure. When the database has been declared to be complete 
and accurate, it will be locked  and the IMP codes will be unblinded and made available for 
data analysis.  
14.3. Archiving  
The investigator will keep all information relevant to the study for at least 15 years after the end of the study, or more if specified by [CONTACT_427].

WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI 
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects  
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by [CONTACT_941]:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_1052102], Republic of South Africa, October 1996

64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013  
Preamble  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects , including
research on identifiable human material and data.
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs
should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to
physicians. The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical researchinvolving human subjects to adopt these principles
General Principles  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “Thehealth of my patient will be my first consideration ,” and the International Code of
Medical Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest whenproviding medical care.”
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well -being and rights
of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's
knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involvinghuman subjects.
6. The primary purpose  of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the
causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proveninterventions must be  evaluated continually through research for their safety,
effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.

S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° [ADDRESS_1052103] interventions involve risks and
burdens.
Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of
the objective outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects.

consequence of participation in the research study.
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -trial
provisions.

S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° [ADDRESS_1052105] submit a final report to the committee containing a summary of the study’sfindings and conclusions.
Privacy and Confidentiality  
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and theconfidentiality of their personal information.
Informed Consent  
25. Participation by [CONTACT_767404]. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members
or community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may beenrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees.
26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, eachpotential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding,any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, theanticipated benefits and potential  risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail,
post- study provisions and any other relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject
must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to withdraw consentto participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention should be given to thespecific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methodsused to deliver the information.
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician
or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s
freely -given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed
in writing, the non-written consent must be formally documented and witnessed.
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the
general outcome and results of the study.
© ILKOS THERAPEUTIC INC – 05 March  2018 – INT - Confidential   91/120  
S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° [ADDRESS_1052106]’s dissent should be respected.
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent,for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental conditionthat prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research
group. In such circumstances the physician must seek informed consent from the legallyauthorised representative. If no such representative is available and if the researchcannot be delayed, the study  may proceed without informed consent provided that the
specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to giveinformed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has beenapproved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research must beobtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorised representative.
31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to theresearch. The refusal of  a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to

Both legs will be fully investigated (Coleridge Smith, 2006) . 
Venous Duplex ultrasonography  
Venous obstruction will be assessed using the duplex ultrasonography performed with a 
superficial probe ( 7 to 13 Megahertz  or MHz ), on a participant in supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], to explore 
the veins listed below (obstruction list). Vein compression, retrograde flow in deep and superficial veins using compression of the calf muscles, echography B mode, pulsed wave and colour Doppler will be used.  For venous valve incompetence, the participant will be examined in standing position. Reflux will be search on the veins listed below with compression of the calf or valsalva manoeuvre for veins above knee, and with compression on the foot for veins below knee. Reflux will be considered if retrograde flow lasted > 0.5 second for superficial veins, anterior and posterior tibial veins, peroneal veins, perforator veins, and if retrograde flow lasted > 1 second for common femoral vein, femoral vein, and popliteal vein.

S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° 4 - Final version  
The CEAP classification (Clinical- Etiology -Anatomy -Pathophysiology) was adopted 
Worldwide to facilitate meaningful communication about CVD and serve as a basis for more 
scientific analysis of management alternatives.  
Clinical classification  
C0: no visible or palpable signs of venous disease C1: telangiectasies or reticular veins  
C2: varicose veins C3: edema C4a: pi[INVESTIGATOR_516173]  
C4b: lipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche C5: heal ed venous ulcer 
C6: active venous ulcer 
Even if the patient will be C6, other classification from C1 to C5 will have to be defined (e.g. 
a patient  could be C1, C3 and C6). 
Each clinical class is further characterized by a subscript for the presence of symp toms ( s, 
symptomatic) or absence of symptoms (a, asymptomatic), for example, C2a or C5 s. 
Symptoms include heaviness, pain, aching, tightness, skin irritation, muscle cramps, and other complaints attributable to venous dysfunction. 
Etiologic classification  
Ec: congenital  
Ep: primary  
Es: secondary (postthrombotic) 
En: no venous cause identified (Only Ep, Es and En will have to be defined) 
Anatomic classification 
As: superficial veins

S42909  Amended Clinical study protocol n° [ADDRESS_1052109] Doppler (CWD) is used to perform the assessment of the Ankle Brachial 
Pressure Index  (ABPI) with a probe of 8 MHz  (5 MHz  for obese patient ). The main objective 
is to determine resting ankle sy stolic pressure and resting brachial  systolic pressure (as an 
approximation of central pressure). 
Systolic blood pressure will be measured after [ADDRESS_1052110] on both arms in sitting  or 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_767322] 2 locations: posterior tibial, and anterior 
tibial. Each measurement will be performed twice and tables will hav e to be completed in a 
specific form (s ee Appendix 12). 
If CWD  is not available, the following procedure will be performed with the Duplex Ultra 
Sonography with a superficial probe (7 to 13 MHz ). 
Explain the procedure and reassure the patient and ensure that he/she is lying flat and is 
comfortable, relaxed and rested with no pressure on the proximal vessels.  
1. Measure the brachial s ystolic blood pressure:  
o Place an appropriately sized cuff around the upper arm  
o Locate the brachial pulse (humeral artery) and apply ultrasound contact [INVESTIGATOR_15174]  
o Angle the Doppler probe and move the probe to obtain the best signal  
o Inflate the cuff until the s ignal is abolished then deflate the cuff slowly and 
record the pressure at which the signal returns being careful not to move the 
probe from the line of the artery (in case of duplex ultrasonography: signal returns must be associated to the systolic curve on the screen)  
o Repeat the procedure for the other arm  
o Use the highest of the two values to calculate the ABPI  
2. Measure the ankle systolic pressure:  
o Place an appropriately sized cuff around the ankle immediately above the 
malleoli having first protected a ny ulcer that may be present by [CONTACT_767408]  
o Examine the foot, locating the anterior tibial pulse  and apply contact [INVESTIGATOR_15174]

arterial signal must be present: posterior tibial, anterior tibial, if not, occlusion 
must be excluded by [CONTACT_767409]) 
o Repeat for the other leg  
o Calculate the ABPI [INVESTIGATOR_767324]:  
 
Causes of error in ABPI [INVESTIGATOR_767325]:  overestimate of the ABPI.  
Repeatedly inflating and deflating: inaccurate pressure reading.  
Inappropriate cuff position, as the pressure recorded is the pressure at the level of the cuff and 
not the pressure at the site of the Doppler probe. 
Bad probe: normally 8MHz when assessing superficial blood vessels (best combination of 
depth of tissue penetration and focus). Obese patient or oedematous legs: 5MHz probe.  
Bad position of the probe: ideally [ADDRESS_1052113] gel  in case of 
CWD.  
Participants will be eligible for the study if ABPI [INVESTIGATOR_767326] 0.8 and below or equal to 1.3

- Contamination is the presence of bacteria with no multiplication  
- Colonisation describes multiplication of bacteria with no host response 
- Infection is said to be present when there is invasion of healthy tissue with a host response 
Assessment of ulcer infection will be made by [CONTACT_767411]: redness, swelling, hyperthermia, pain and limited function. Additionally the following parameters should be also considered: 
- Increased exudate: substantial increase in the amount of exudate, possibly with 
increased viscosity, change in colour, offensive odour. 
- Friable granulation tissue 
- Slough 
- Changed odour  
- Changed pain  
- Stagnation in the healing process 
- Serological markers of systemic infection, e.g. leucocytosis, increased CRP 
For the purpose of the study, ulcer infection will be graded in 4 different grades taking into account the extent of inflammatory signs:  
Grade 1: no signs or symptoms of infection Grade 2: in subcutaneous tissue only Grade 3: extensive erythema, infection of deeper tissue Grade 4: systemic inflammatory response indicating severe infection  
Participants with infection of Grades 2-3- 4 will undergo medical management at the 
investigator ’s discretion including antibiot herapy , exc ept local antibiotherapy on the surface  
of RU . Should the antibiotics be required for more than 7 days  during the same month to 
control the infection the participant will be withdraw from the study.

The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) of the National Kidney 
Foundation (NKF) defines chronic kidney disease as eithe r kidney damage or a decreased 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 ml /min/1.73 m2 for 3 or more months. 
Whatever the underlying etiology, the destruction of renal mass with irreversible sclerosis and loss of nephrons leads to a progressive decline in GFR. The different stages of chronic kidney disease form a continuum in time.  
In 2002, K/DOQI published its classification of the stages of chronic kidney disease, as follows: 
- Stage 1: Kidney damage with  normal or increased GFR (>90 ml/min/1.73 m
2) 
- Stage 2: Mild reduction in GFR (60-89 ml/min/1.73 m2) 
- Stage 3: Mod erate reduction in GFR (30-59 ml/min/1.73 m2) 
- Stage 4: S evere reduction in GFR (15-29 ml/min/1.73 m2) 
- Stage 5: Kidney failure (GFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 or dialysis) 
Estimation of e GFR  
Estimation of e GFR will be done using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) 
formula  
For creatinine in  mg/dL:  
•Female patients
eGFR= [186 x Serum creatinine -1.154 x (Age) -0.203] x 0.742 x 0.95
•Male patients
eGFR= [186 x (Serum creatinine) -1.154 x (Age) -0.203] x 0.95
For creatinine in  µmol/L:  
•Female patients
eGFR= [186 x (Serum creatinine x 0.0113)-1.154 x (Age) -0.203] x 0.742 x 0.95
•Male patients
eGFR= [186 x (Serum creatinine x 0.0113)-1.154 x (Age) -0.203] x 0.95
The laboratory will automatically  calculate estimated eGFR according to the above formula s. 
Participants having e GFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 or participants requiring dialysis are not 
eligible  for participating in the study.

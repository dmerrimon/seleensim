4. METHODS/PROCEDURE :   
4.1. Study Hypothesis  
The primary hypothesis is that study subjects who received the FlareHawk expandable 
cage(s) through a TLIF or PLIF procedure experienced fusion by 12  months (+/ - 3 mo) 
follow -up, with improvements in clinical outcomes related to pain and/or disability 
compared to pre -operative scores. Further, the subjects are hypothesized to have not 
experienced any unforeseen device- or procedure -related adverse even ts 
4.2. Primary Outcome  
Proportion of subjects with radiographic arthrodesis at 12 months +/ - 3 months as 
determined using plain radiographic images with assessment based on the Bridwell-
Lenke grading system [Bridwell and Lenke et al, 1995].  
4.3. Secondary Outcomes  
• Change in VAS Leg from preoperative baseline to 12 months +/ - 3 months  
• Change in VAS Back from preoperative baseline to 12 months +/ - 3 months  
• Change in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) from baseline to 12 months +/ - 3 months  
• Intra -operative and po st-operative adverse events  
4.4. Study Population  
A total of at least [ADDRESS_302398] three sites will be enrolled based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Homogeneity of data collection and treatment procedures 
will be ensured prior to combining data from multiple sites. The retrospective chart review will include the full consecutive series of patients who received TLIF or PLIF 
surgery using the FlareHawk expandable interbody fusion cage between December 1, 
2017, and May 31, 2018. Subjects from that c onsecutive series will be included in the 
study based on the pre -defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. If at least 100 patients 
are not included after screening through the pre -defined inclusion / exclusion criteria, 
the date range will be extended, and the full consecutive series of patients within the new date range will be considered for inclusion. The date range will be extended, as 
necessary, until at least [ADDRESS_302399] been diagnosed 
with degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_248713]. All

5.1. Not applicable  
6. SAMPLE SIZE:   
6.1. The primary outcome of this study, radiographic arthrodesis, is commonly observed in 
approximately 80 -100% of study subjects for TLIF/PLIF surgeries [FlareHawk CER -[ZIP_CODE] 
Rev C]. With 100 subjects included, if an 88% fusion rate is observed, the 95% 
confidence interval for fusion success will be 80.2% -93.0%, placing the performance 
results within the anticipated range. Further, the inclusion of at least [ADDRESS_302401] 1.6%, assuming a power of 80% [MedDev 2.7.1, rev 4]. This detection rate is 
adequate for this device and stu dy based on the severity and frequency of anticipated 
adverse events associated with the FlareHawk device [FlareHawk CER -[ZIP_CODE] Rev C]. 
The target sample size for inclusion will be 118 patients, assuming that up to 15% will 
not have data at the [ADDRESS_302402] 100 patients with data.

9. DATA ANALYSIS:  
9.1. Primary Outcome  
The proportion of levels achieving arthrodesis at 12 months (+/ - 3 months) will be 
summarized as a percentage and 95% confidence interval, based on the Wilson score 
method for binomial confidence intervals. Integrity Implants engineering to determine if 
the criteria for success was met.  
9.2. Secondary Outcomes  
Continuous variables, such as baseline demographics and change in patient -reported 
outcomes from preoperative baseline to [ADDRESS_302405] or a non -parametric 
equivalent (if data does not satisfy assumptions of normality) will be used to determine 
if changes in VAS or ODI scores are statistically significant from preoperative baseline to 
12 months (+/ - 3 months) follow -up. Responder analyses for changes in patient-
reported outcomes at 12 months (+/ - 3 months) will be conducted using minimum 
clinically important differences (MCID). Significant clinical improvements from 
preoperative baseline to 12 months (+/ - 3 months) foll ow-up will be determined on a 
per-patient basis using the following MCID values:  
• Improvement in ODI ≥ 10 points [Ostelo et al. 2008]  
• Improvement in VAS leg pain ≥ 15 points [Ostelo et al. 2008]  
• Improvement in VAS back pain ≥ 15 points [Ostelo  et al. 2008] 
The proportion of patients with improvements exceeding the MCID values will be summarized as a percentage and 95% confidence interval.  
Sub-group analyses will be performed based on the implant version (split -shim vs. 
“Version B”), history of previous surgery at the index level, patient co -morbidities, and 
demographic variables.  
For any adverse events, the observed rate of each type of event will be summarized as 
a percentage with the 95% confidence interval and compared with rates observed in

 1.  Introduction 
1.1   Background  
Degenerative disc disease (DDD) of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_248720] (e.g. back and lower extremity pain) and radiographic findings (e.g. 
disc space collapse and stenosis). DDD is sometimes accompanied by [CONTACT_248735] (vertebral “slippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]”) of varying extent, with Grade I being the most mild. The most common therapi[INVESTIGATOR_248721] (e.g. injections, chiropractic manipulations), decompression without fusion, posterolateral fusion 
(PLF), or lumbar interbody fusion (LIF). With more than 6 months of failed conservative care, patients may be 
indicated for surgical intervention and LIF is often regarded as the mainstay  of surgical care for degenerative disc 
disease [Noshchenko et al. 2015; Yavin et al. 2017].  Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) and posterior 
lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) are two variants of LIF surgery that utilize  a posterior approach.  
More recently , expandable interbody  cages  have been introduced for use in TLIF or PLIF procedures. Expandable 
cages, in general, have the potential advantage of facilitating more minimally invasive surgery while achieving 
substantial disc height and neuroforaminal height  restoration as well as lordosis.  Designs that expand in the 
transverse plane ( medially -laterally ) may also reduce subsidence risk  due to their larger footprint . The FlareHawk 
expandable interbody fusion cage offers a simple expansion mechanism to achieve biplanar (cranial -caudal and 
medial -lateral) expansion in situ. This device is currently FDA -cleared in the [LOCATION_002] and has been adopted 
into standard clinical practice beginning in August 2016, with over 3800 devices implanted to date. This study is a 
retrospective chart review to assess the performance and safety of the FlareHawk expandable cage under its 
intended use.  
1.2   Device Description 
The Integrity Implants FlareHawk Interbody Fusion System is an expandable lumbar intervertebral body fusion device intended for use in the lumbosacral spi[INVESTIGATOR_248722] L2-S1 and is intended for intervertebral lumbar fusion. The 
FlareHawk  implant consists of a Shell and a Shim component that are offered in a range of sizes to accommodate 
variation in patient anatomy. The Shell component is a rectangular frame with struts on all four sides that allow for insertion into the intervertebral body space in a non- expanded form, and subsequent expansion following the 
insertion of the Shim component. The Shim component has a tapered front end that inserts into and expands the Shell component to the desired vertical and horizontal dimensions. When fully inserted, the Shim locks within the Shell to provide structural stability for interbody fusion. An integrated “Core” in the Shell serves to anchor the 
delivery instrument during Shim insertion. Protrusions on the superior and inferior surfaces of the implant grip the 
adjacent vertebral endplates to resist expulsion. The FlareHawk  implant is to be filled with autogenous  and/or 
allogenic  bone graft composed of cancellous and/or corticocancellous bone. Once implanted, the FlareHaw k 
Protocol date July 18, 2019  
V1 Page 7 
 implant is designed to restore intervertebral disc height, provide anterior column support and maintain structural 
stability of the motion segment to facilitate intervertebral body fusion.   
2. Purpose of the Study:  
The purpose of this study is  to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients who have undergone a TLIF or PLIF 
procedure with a FlareHawk expandable interbody fusion cage(s) to assess the device’s  performance and safety 
when used in accordance with its intended use.  
3.  Study Design 
3.1 Study Hypothesis:  
The primary hypothesis is that study subjects who received the FlareHawk  expandable cage(s) through a TLIF or 
PLIF procedure experience d fusion by 12 months  (+/- 3 mo) follow- up, with  improvements in clinical outcomes 
related to pain and/or disability  compared to pre- operative scores. Further, the subjects are hypothesized to have 
not experienced any unforeseen device- or procedure- related adverse events.  
3.2 Study Description:  
This is a retrospective clinical study  (chart review) of patients who have previously undergone TLIF or PLIF surgery 
with the FlareHawk  expandable interbody fusion cage at one or two contiguous levels .  
3.3 Primary Outcome:  
Proportion of subjects with radiographic  arthrodesis at 12 months +/- 3 months as determined using plain 
radiographic images  with assessment based on the Bridwell- Lenke grading system [Bridwell and Lenke et al, 1995] .  
3.4 Secondary Outcomes: 
• Change in VAS Leg from preoperative baseline to 12 months  +/- 3 months  
• Change in VAS Back from preoperative baseline to 12 months  +/- 3 months  
• Change in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) from baseline to 12 months  +/- 3 months  
• Intra-operative and post -operative adverse events  
3.5 Study Population:  
A total of at least [ADDRESS_302418] three sites will be enrolled based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Homogeneity of data collection and treatment procedures will be ensured prior to combining data from multiple 
sites. The retrospective chart review will include the full consecutive series of patients who received TLIF or PLIF 
surgery using the FlareHawk expandable interbody fusion cage between December 1, 2017, and May 31, 2018. 
Subjects from that consecutive series will be included in the study based on the pre- defined inclusion and exclusion 
Protocol date July 18, [ADDRESS_302419] 100 patients are not included after screening through the pre- defined inclusion / 
exclusion criteria, the date range will be extended, and the full consecutive series of patients within the new date 
range will be considered for inclusion. The date range will be extended, as necessary, until at least [ADDRESS_302420] been on the market recently. The “Split Shim” version was introduced to the 
market in January  2018. This version supersedes the previous version, “Version B”, which has been on the market 
since January 2017. These two versions of the device have subtle differences and are equivalent from the clinical, 
technical, and biological perspective, and are expected to demonstrate equivalent safety and performance. 
Therefore, data will be collected from patients treated with either version of the device. A subgroup analysis will be performed to confirm poolabilit y of th e data.  
3.6 Sample Size Justification 
The primary outcome of this study, radiographic arthrodesis, is commonly  observed in approximately 80-100% of 
study subjects for TLIF /PLIF  surgeries [ FlareHawk CER -[ZIP_CODE] Rev C]. With 100 subjects  included, if an 88%  fusion 
rate is observed, the 95% confidence interval
1 for fusion success will be 80.2% -93.0% , placing the performance 
results within the anticipated range. Further, the inclusion of at least  [ADDRESS_302421] 1.6%, assuming a power of 80%  [MedDev 2.7.1, rev 
4]. This detection rate is adequate for this device and study based on the severity and frequency  of anticipated 
adverse events associated with the FlareHawk device [FlareHawk CER- [ZIP_CODE] Rev C] . The target sample size for 
inclusion will be 118 patients, assuming that up to 15% will not have data at the [ADDRESS_302422] 100 patients with data.

there are not at least [ADDRESS_302430] 100 patients included with follow -up data at 12 (+/ - 3) months, the date range will be extended.  
4.2 Data Collection Procedure: 
All data will be collected on de-identified case report forms (CRF) located at the participating site. Each subject will 
be identified only by a number which is generated at each site. No PHI will be available or seen by [CONTACT_248736]. All printed study records at the site will be 
maintained in a secure location. The data will be maintained by [CONTACT_248737].  
Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial 
necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.

 Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, copi[INVESTIGATOR_110799], and X -rays.  
Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested on the 
CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the 
procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual 
case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such 
changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or 
uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial  and date it. The investigator will be responsible 
for maintaining adequate, accurate CRFs to guarantee the proper interpretation of the data.

4.4 Data Management Plan:  
Data processing and management will be carried out in accordance with the study -specific data processing plan. 
The data will be verified per the Monitoring Plan and CRFs will be collected by [CONTACT_70585] (CRA) 
upon completion. Data will be entered into a password protected and encrypted database by [CONTACT_248738].  
Any missing, implausible or inconsistent recordings will be referred back to the Investigator using a data query form 
and will be documented for each individual subject. Responses from the Investigator will be reviewed and updated in the Database. This process will be repeated until no further discrepancies are found. The data will be then be 
declared as clean.  
4.5 Monitoring Plan:  
This study will be monitored according to the monitoring plan.  The investigator and study staff will allocate 
adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The investigator will also ensure that the monitor or other compliance 
or quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the above noted study -related documents. A remote pre-
qualification assessment will be completed with the investigator and study staff to ensure they are experienced and 
available to conduct the study. Selected sites will participate in an initiation visit and will be trained on the study 
protocol and study related responsibilities. Interim remote or onsite monitoring visits will be conducted for cause and one on- site visit will occur once the study site has completed the CRFs , so that the CRA can verify the collected 
data to the source documents.  
5. Adverse Events:  
Per EN ISO [ZIP_CODE], an adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, 
or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or 
not related to the investigational medical device as any undesirable deviation from the subject’s baseline condition 
Protocol date July 18, [ADDRESS_302431]’s interpretation:  
None:  patient outcome is not symptomatic, or no symptoms detected and no treatment is required.  
Mild: patient outcome is symptomatic, symptoms are mild, loss of function or harm is minimal or intermediate but 
short term, and no or minimal intervention (e.g., extra observation, investigation, review or minor treatment) is 
required.  
Moderate: patient outcome is symptomatic, requiring intervention (e.g., additional operative procedure; additional 
therapeutic treatment), an increased length of stay, or causing permanent or long- term harm or loss of function.  
Severe: patie nt outcome is symptomatic, requiring life- saving intervention or major surgical/medical intervention, 
shortening life expectancy or causing major permanent or long- term harm or loss of function  
Death: on balance of probabilities, death was caused or brought forward in the short term by [CONTACT_248739].  
The relationship of the AE to the implant or surgical procedure is determined according to the following definitions:  
Device related: The AE can be reasonably associated with the presence or performance of the device and follows 
a reasonable temporal sequence to the device implant  
Procedure related: The AE has been established as a potential risk or complication associated with any type of spi[INVESTIGATOR_248731].  
Not related: The AE has no temporal sequence from the receipt of the device or it can be explained by [CONTACT_1604], including underlying disease, concomitant medication or concurrent treatment. This also includes events 
associated with general surgical procedures (e.g. anesthesia reactions).  
5.[ADDRESS_302432] Safety:  
The expandable cage used in this study is currently used in standard of care procedures for these lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_248732]. No experimental devices or products were  used in this study  and all patients were treated according to 
the standard practices of the study investigators .  
5.2 Mitigation of Risks:  
This is a retrospective chart review that does not introduce any additional risks to the patient.  
  
Protocol date July 18, 2019  
V1 Page 15  
 6. Image and Data Analysis 
6.1 Radiographic Fusion Assessment:  
Radiographs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_248740] (two primary reviewers and an adjudicator, as necessary, to 
evaluate any contradicting reviews by [CONTACT_248741]).  Reviewers will be 3rd party board- certified orthopedic 
surgeons, neurosurgeons, or radiologists.  
Fusion status will be determined according to the Bridwell -Lenke grading system [Bridwell and Lenke et al, 1995], 
with grades 1- 2 accepted as “Fused” and grades 3- 4 accepted as “Not Fused”:  
• Grade 1: Fused with remodeling and trabeculae present  
• Grade 2: Graft intact, not fully remodeled and incorporated, but no lucency present  
• Grade 3: Graft intact, potential lucency present at top and bottom of graft  
• Grade 4: Fusion absent with collapse/resorption of the graft  
6.2 Data Analysis:  
Primary outcome:   
The proportion of levels achieving arthrodesis at 12 months (+/- 3 months) will be summarized as a percentage and 
95% confidence interval, based on the Wilson score method for binomial confidence intervals .  
Secondary outcomes:   
Continuous variables, such as baseline demographics and change in patient -reported outcomes from preoperative 
baseline to [ADDRESS_302433] or a non- parametric equivalent (if data does not satisfy assumptions of normality) will be used to determine if 
changes in VAS or ODI scores are statistically significant from preoperative baseline to 12 months (+/- 3 months) 
follow- up. Responder analyses for changes in patient -reported outcomes at 12 months (+/- 3 months) will be 
conducted using minimum clinically important differences (MCID). Significant clinical improvements  from 
preoperative baseline to 12 months (+/- 3 months)  follow-up will be determined on a per -patient basis using the 
following MCID values:  
• Improvement in ODI ≥ 10 points [Ostelo et al. 2008]  
• Improvement in VAS leg pain ≥ 15 points [ Ostelo  et al. 2008] 
• Improvement in VAS back pai n ≥ 15 points  [Ostelo  et al. 2008]  
The proportion of patients with improvements exceeding the MCID values will be summarized as a percentage and 95% confidence interval . 
Protocol date July 18, 2019  
V1 Page 16  
 Sub-group analyses will be performed based on the implant version (split -shim vs. “Version B”), history o f previous 
surgery at the index level, patient co- morbidities, and demographic variables.  
For any adverse events, the observed rate of each type of event will be summarized as a percentage with the 95% 
confidence interval and compared with rates observed in the literature describing the current state of the art with 
other PLIF and TLIF interbody cages.  
7.  Ethical and Regulatory Requirements:  
7.[ADDRESS_302434]  
The Investigator will ensure that the clinical study is conducted in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) , EN 
ISO [ZIP_CODE], and all regulatory and institutional requirements, including those for subject privacy, informed consent, 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and record retention,  and the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidelines for the conduct of clinical trials . As this study is a retrospective chart 
review adding no additional risk to the subjects, a waiver of informed consent will be requested from the IEC/IRB.  
7.[ADDRESS_302435] records will be made available as required for review by [CONTACT_248742] a reviewing IEC/IRB, however to every extent possible; the subject’s identities will not be 
disclosed.  Compliance with EN ISO [ADDRESS_302436] of 1996 
(HIPAA) is required and data collection must comply with the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable 
Health Information, 45 CFR Part 160 and Part 164, as amended from time to time (the “Privacy Rule”), under 
HIPAA.  
The case report forms do not include any subject identifying information in accordance with HIPAA.  Therefore, 
once the data is entered on the CRF, a subject can no longer be identified.  It is the responsibility of the investigator 
to maintain a list of subject identification and ID numbers . 
7.3 Retention of Records by [CONTACT_248743] s will retain records for a period of 2 years following the date of the study conclusion.

 Page [ADDRESS_663085] never used Ascensia’s Contour Next ( Lightning Next) and 
Lightning PLUS (L -PLUS or Contour Plus E LITE) BGMS  previously , will be sequestered in such 
a way that they cannot observe or be influenced by [CONTACT_127002].  
They will learn to use the L- PLUS meter by [CONTACT_512472] (UG) and Quick 
Reference Guide (QRG).  Each subject will perform one fingerstick self -test using a Microlet 
NEXT or similar lancing device and the L- PLUS meter.  Immediately following the subject self -
test, a Tenderlett ™ or similar device will be used by [CONTACT_127004]’s finger 
(preferably the  same hand) to collect a capi[INVESTIGATOR_512466].   
Immediately following the Tenderlett lancing, subjects will lance their palm using the Microlet  
NEXT lancing device (with AST clear endcap) and will perform a self -test using the meter.   
Immediately following the AST test, the staff person will perform a fingerstick test on the subject  
with the M icrolet device and the L- Plus meter .  
All subject capi[INVESTIGATOR_126976]-test results and study staff fingerstick results will be compared 
to YSI results from blood obtained from the Tenderlett fingerstick.  
Hematocrit will be measured for all subjects.    
All Subjects will then complete a questionnaire (Questionnaire 1) to provide feedback on the meter system and instructions for use (UG and QRG).   
Subjects will be given a venipuncture.  The venous blood will be tested by [CONTACT_512473] L -PLUS  system  and the YSI lab analyzer.  The venipuncture may be performed any time after 
the subject is enrolled (i.e. completed informed consent and passed inclusion/exclusion criteria).  
After all self- testing  and Questionnaire 1 is completed, staff will demonstrate to the subjects 
several features of the meter system that would not necessarily be experienced during t he brief 
accuracy testing.   The subjects will be given a second questionnaire (Questionnaire 2) to provide 
feedback about the new features of the system.

 Page 17 of 34  5.12.2 Pre Study and Daily Control Tests  
These four glucose control sera will be used to verify the accuracy of each YSI analyzer before the 
study begins (Pre -study testing).  Six  (6) pre -study runs will be performed on each YSI that will 
be used in the trial : 2 runs per day  for 3 days .  The Ascensia Study Manager or designee will review 
the YSI pre -study glucose control data before the study begins.  
The daily controls  will be tested: 1 sip = [ADDRESS_663135] blood samples will be monitored by [CONTACT_127011] 4 glucose control s at the beginning of the day.  The YSI will be calibrated before each serum control 
sample is tested.   The sequence of testing will be:  
1. Calibrate the YSI 
2. Test Control 2 (1 sip) 
3. Calibrate  
4. Test C ontrol 3 (1 sip) 
5. Calibrate  
6. Test Control 4 (1 sip) 
7. Calibrate  
8. Test Control 5 (1 sip) 
Site staff will keep a maintenance log for each YSI, including daily operational checks, maintenance and membrane changes.   A full set of serum controls should also be tested after YSI 
parts are changed (such as buffers, probes, or membranes).    
5.12.[ADDRESS_663136] plasma samples (capi[INVESTIGATOR_126983]) will be tested using [ADDRESS_663137] (=2 results, 1 from white and 1 from black probe) with calibration of the YSI before the first sip.  A serum control (1 sip) will be tested after each subject plasma samp le to verify the YSI Analyzer has 
remained in control during the plasma sample test.  The control with target value close to the 
concentration of the subject plasma sample will be tested.  The average of the black and white 
probe results will be verified to be within the ranges shown in Table 5.2.  
If the control result is out of range, the YSI will be recalibrated and the control sample will be 
retested.  If the control result is now within the appropriate range (Table 5.2), the control sample 
is conf irmed as appropriate for use.  The YSI analyzer will then be re- calibrated, the plasma will 
be re -tested, and the control will be tested per the protocol’s plasma testing procedure already 
described.  
If the control result is not within the appropriate range after the plasma sample has been tested twice, the results for this subject sample will be non -evaluable.  
The sequence of testing for each subject sample will be:  
1. Calibrate the YSI 
2. Test plasma sample (1 sip)  
3. Test control (1 sip) 
4. Verify control result (mean of black and white probe results)  is within limits in Table 
5.2.  If it is, stop and record result.  
5. If not, repeat Steps 1, [ADDRESS_663138]:[ZIP_CODE] ,   Author: MT Viggiani   CONFIDENTIAL  
 Page [ADDRESS_663139] sample are non -evaluable. 
Glucose values of the YSI replicates (both controls and plasma) should be within 4 mg/dL or 4% 
of each other (i.e. 4 mg/dL for values < 100 mg/dL and 4% for values ≥ 100 mg/dL).   If they are 
not, an additional assay should be run. 
 
5.12.4 Recording YSI Results  
The YSI source documents will be labeled as follows throughout the study to facilitate matching glucose results on the source document with results recorded on the CRF:  
Sample identification will include:  
1) Ascensia serum traceability control level or  
2) Subject ID plus either ‘capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396]’ or ‘venous’ blood  
The YSI operator or designee will label all samples on YSI tape and record YSI results for all plasma and control sample runs on the appropriate source documents.  YSI source documents 
(tapes) will be photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_512468]’s study file  for  source data verification .  Site staff or designees who photocopy 
the YSI tapes will certify (with signature, date, and YSI ID) that the copy is a true and accurate representation of the original.
 
NOTE:  If glucose results are not to be used due to operator errors, insufficient sample, etc., this should be clearly marked on the YSI source document.  The YSI operator will record all non -
numeric codes - QNS (Quantity not sufficient), NO (N ot Obtainable), and error codes .
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_663140] Questionnaires  
Site staff will administer two questionnaires to each subjects corresponding to L- PLUS  meter.    
5.13.1 Questionnaire 1: Evaluation of Instructions for Use.   
Staff will administer a questionnaire to all subjects who perform fingerstick self -testing after the 
individual meter testing is completed.  The questionnaire will include statements for which a numerical score or rating will be provided by [CONTACT_1766] (1=strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree, 5=strongly agree).  These numerically scored statements will be tabulated into frequency 
distributions.  The following statements will be subject to the pass/fail criteria listed in the study 
objectives secti on:
 
• I find it easy to do a fingerstick blood test with this meter.  
• The meter display is easy to see and read.  
• It was easy to understand my test results.  
• The instructions (User Guide and Quick Reference Guide) were easy to understand. 
• The instructions clearly explain how to run a test. 
• The instructions clearly explain what to do if an error message is displayed by [CONTACT_127012].    Note: an error message will be demonstrated by [CONTACT_127013]/her testing.

questionnaire will be administered by [CONTACT_127015]’s responses.   The subject 
will be given an example questionnaire to assist with providing the responses.  
5.13.2 Questionnaire 2: BGMS Features.  
After all testing and the first questionnaire ha ve been completed, the study staff will demonstrate 
to the subjects  several features of the BGMS  that would not necessarily be experienced during the 
brief accuracy testing.  This will ensure that the subjects are able to understand the features, and 
answer questions in the questionnaire.  
There are no acceptance criteria for this questionnaire.   This questionnaire may be 1) administered 
by [CONTACT_127015]’s responses or 2) completed by [CONTACT_127016], as per site procedures.   In the first scenario, the subject will be given an example

 Page 21 of 34  7.0  Adverse Event Management and Medical Device Reporting   
The procedures to be performed under this protocol are considered to be low risk.  
7.1 Description and Classification  
7.1.1. An AE during a clinical evaluation is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended 
disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, 
users or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device.”  It is not dependent on whether the event is considered to be related to the investigational product or the study.  An AE includes events not seen at the beginning of the study, or worsened if present at the beginning.  Adverse events can be classified as presented in Table 7.1. 
7.1.2. The next classification to consider is whether or not the AE is Anticipated or Unanticipated.  
In order for an AE to be considered ‘anticipated’ it must be listed in the protocol and ICF prior to any occurrence. 
7.1.3. For studies on products that have not yet been cleared for market, it is important that all 
AEs be documented and included in the study file. 7.1.4. An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is:  Any serious adverse effect on health 
or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that 
effect, problem or death was not previously identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence in 
the investigational plan or application (includin g a supplementary plan or application), or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety or welfare of subjects [21CFR812.3(s)]. 
7.1.5. All AEs observed by [CONTACT_127018] (including all symptoms) and included in the study file.  
7.[ADDRESS_663145] has a hypoglycemic event, as determined by [CONTACT_079] 
(PI) during a study visit, the subject will be treated by [CONTACT_127019] . Appendices D and 
E note each site’s treatment plan .  
Classification of the hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic event is at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1461].  If the hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic event is considered by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_126986], it will be considered to be an anticipated AE and will be recorded on the AE Form. 
Subjects who are hypo- or hyperglycemic may continue with fingerstick testing if they so choose, 
and if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_126987].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_126988] a hypoglycemic 
or hyperglycemic state.

8.1 Criteria to Withdraw / Discontinue a Subject from Study  
Subjects who experience an AE will be withdrawn from the study.  Subjects may be withdrawn from the study at their own request for any reason, or at the discretion of the PI (or designee) for one of the following reasons: 
1) Illness of a subject  
3) Subject non- compliance with protocol requirements  
4) Other, at the discretion of the investigator 
In such cases, the subject will be withdrawn from further study participation.   Any evaluable d ata 
collected from withdrawn subjects will be analyzed and results will be retained for safety assessments.   If available, data will be retained in analyses related to the objective s of the study 
unless there is a valid reason to believe that the data may be biased, incorrect, or confounded.

 Page [ADDRESS_663153] BS EN [ZIP_CODE]:2002, “Performance evaluation of in  vitro diagnostic medical 
devices.”  
The L- Plus meters, which is the focus of this study, is an  investigational devices. For studies 
involving an investigational device, the sponsor is responsible for determining whether submission of an IDE application to FDA is required before a study may proceed. The IDE regulations (21 CFR 812) describe three ty pes of device studies: significant risk (SR), nonsignificant risk (NSR), 
and exempt studies.  
Ascensia has determined that the L -Plus study is a Non- Significant Risk (NSR) study  
which   must follow the abbreviated IDE requirements of 21 CFR 812.2(b), including informed 
consent and IRB review, and do not require submission of an IDE application to FDA. As a result 
of this conclusion, Ascensia has not had correspondence with the FDA regarding determination of 
study classification and risk level.  
Determination of the NSR classification is based on the following: 
• L-Plus  meters are not intended to be implantable devices.   
• L-Plus  meters are not purported or represented to be for use in supporting or sustaining 
human life  
• L-Plus  meters are not intended to provide substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, 
mitigating, or treating diabetes, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health. 
• L-Plus meters do  not present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of 
a subject.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_663154] (IRB) Approval  
Prior to study initiation, a n IRB must review this protocol, the ICF, and any other supporting study 
documents which impact subject safety.  The investigational site may not begin the study until the 
IRB has given its written and dated approval via a letter that identifies the version/date of the protocol and ICF.  A copy of the IRB approval letter and approved ICF must be provided to the Investigator and to Ascensia prior to the Study Initiation Visit.  
9.[ADDRESS_663155] provide informed consent before she/he can participate in the study.  The 
informed consent process fully apprises the subjects of the risks and benefits to them and to society for participating in the study.   The ICF will clearly state that designated study personnel will be 
able to view the subject’s medical records.   The ICF will also state that Ascensia representatives 
may observe some subjects as part of study staff training, study monitoring or for troubleshooting problems with the in vestigational devices.  
Clinical Trial Protocol GCA -PRO -2019- 002-[ADDRESS_663156]:[ZIP_CODE] ,   Author: MT Viggiani   CONFIDENTIAL  
 Page [ADDRESS_663157] understands and agrees to participate in the study, she/he will sign the ICF.   All 
subjects will be given a signed copy of the ICF.  If a subject has a question about his/her rights, 
he/she may contact a member of the IRB at any time during or after study participation.  
9.4 Study Documentation Procedures 
The investigator will keep study records for a minimum of three years.   Alternatively, other 
arrangements may be made with Ascensia for study document storage.  
9.5 Study Monitoring   
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_127023].   A monitoring plan will be completed 
by [CONTACT_127024]/designee prior to the study.   The Study Manager or designee will conduct a 
study initiation visit  combined with 1st monitoring visit,  up to 2 interim monitoring visits and a 
close- out visit.   Note: the latter two visits may occur within a continuous timeframe.   
Study monitoring will be performed on site as well as by [CONTACT_512477]. Per site/sponsor agreement, selected source documents will be scanned and sent to the 
sponsor for remote monitoring by [CONTACT_456]. Some of the c ritical data points  that will be 
monitored 100% include, but are not limited to :  
• Meter results 
• YSI control and subject plasma results  
• Centrifugation times 
Ascensia representatives may observe some subject visits as part of study monitoring.  This will 
be done under supervision of the investigator.  Ascensia representatives will maintain subject 
confidentiality and will not interfere with rights of human subjects, safety or bias study conduct.  
9.6 Investigator’s Report of Study Closure 
Ascensia representatives will send a letter to the site informing them that the study is closed.  The study will be considered closed when the data has been locked for data analysis.  
The Investigator or designee will submit a report summarizing subject disposition and other study 
details, as appropriate, to the Ascensia Study Manager and the reviewing IRB.  This report will be completed within 3 months of the study closure date.  
 
In addition, the Ascensia Study Manager, or designee, will report the completion of the study to the IRB within 6 months of study closure.  
 
9.7 Registration of Trial  
The clinical trial will be registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov as required.   
 
9.8 Clinical Study Report (CSR)  
One CSR will be written by [CONTACT_127026] L- PLUS: this report will evaluate data according to 
ISO [ZIP_CODE]:[ADDRESS_663158]:[ZIP_CODE] ,   Author: MT Viggiani   CONFIDENTIAL  
 Page [ADDRESS_663159] IDs, will be kept by [CONTACT_512478].  The Investigator will retain all signed IC documents.  
Clinical data will be primarily collected through an EDC system used by [CONTACT_127007].  Study data 
will be recorded on forms that will serve as source documents for the EDC system.  These original 
Forms will be retained by [CONTACT_779].  
In addition to data collection, the EDC system will be used for data cleaning as well as monitoring operations.  Site and sponsor users will be trained on the system prior to the study start, and their 
access to EDC system will be contingent upon successful completion of training requirements. Study personnel will complete and sign all appropriate source document fo rms in compliance with 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  Source documents (Forms) should be completed legibly, in black 
or blue ink.  If it is nece ssary to make corrections, a single line should be drawn through the original 
entry, the new entry written in, and the correction initialed and dated by [CONTACT_114654].  
The original forms will be retained by [CONTACT_13177] a minimum of three years.  
 
11.0 Data Analysis  
The statistical analysis plan for this study is described in document GCA -SAP-2019- 002-01. 
In general, meter results satisfying the pertinent objective criteria will be considered “successes” 
in the Bernoulli sense.  
All fingerstick and AST meter test results will be compared to the capi[INVESTIGATOR_126990].  
All venous blood meter test results will be compared to the venous blood YSI laboratory results.  
 
 11.1  Sample Size Considerations  
 Let MeterBG = meter blood glucose result;  
LabBG = laboratory method (YSI) comparator blood glucose result.  
 D = MeterBG – LabBG  
RD = 100*(MeterBG – LabBG) / LabBG  
 Assume 100 evaluable results from people with diabetes.  The ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2103 acceptance 
criterion is that 95% of those evaluable results must satisfy the accuracy criteria:  
Clinical Trial Protocol GCA -PRO -2019- 002-[ADDRESS_663160]:[ZIP_CODE] ,   Author: MT Viggiani   CONFIDENTIAL  
 Page 27 of 34   
|D| = |MeterBG – LabBG | ≤ 15 mg/dL, for LabBG < 100 mg/dL  
or  |RD| = 100*|MeterBG – LabBG| / LabBG ≤ 15%, for LabBG ≥ 100 mg/dL. 
 With n = 100, Xc = 95 results would be required to satisfy the accuracy criteria.  At P
0 = 97.35%, 
there is approximately a 95% chance of satisfying the ISO objective.  Conversely, at P a = 89.78%, 
there is approximately a 95% chance of failing to satisfy the ISO objective.  
 
11.2 Data Listing  
A listing of the data (excel sheet) is needed for the CSR.  The listing should include:  subject and 
staff fingerstick meter results, AST (palm) meter results, venous meter results, capi[INVESTIGATOR_512469], subject ID, hematocrit. 
A listing of subject comments including subject IDs from the Ease of Use Questionnaire is needed 
for the CSR.   
Note: If supplemental or unplanned analyses are requested, they will be presented in a 
supplemental report.

Capi[INVESTIGATOR_126992] 
1. The study staff will perform a deep finger puncture using a Tenderlett, or similar, lancing 
device, on the subject’s finger.  
2. The study staff will express the blood and collect approximately 200 - 300 µL in a blood 
collection tube (e.g. BD Microtainer with lithium heparin).  It is optional that a  hand warmer 
may be used to improve blood flow and facilitate sample collection.   Detailed instructions are 
as follows:  
• Typi[INVESTIGATOR_126993].  It is recommended to practice the 
finger massaging technique prior to puncture. 
• If a hand- warmer is used:, g ive subject a hand- warmer to hold for several minutes prior to 
puncture.  Note that the hand- warmer should be moved to the subject’s wrist when ready 
for puncture and kept there during the whole collection procedure. 
• Angle finger with tip slightly downward and squeeze fingertip gently prior to puncture. 
• Consider placement of finger puncture device:  Choose a puncture site that will allow you to use your dominant hand to collect the blood.  The device should be aligned so that the 
opening (where the blade comes out) is perpendicular to the grooves of the f ingerprint and 
so that the opening is placed to the side of the finger (not too close to the nail). 
• While continuing to hold the fingertip, squeeze firmly, hold device firmly against side of finger and trigger the blade.  Then turn the finger so that the nail is facing up. 
• Remove pressure from fingertip (to allow capi[INVESTIGATOR_126994]) and collect the first drop. 
• Begin massaging motion – continuous message of sides of the finger – this is critical.  
• Continue massaging finger from base to tip as you continue to collect the blood drops into the tube.  If blood flow reduces it may help to press on the nail a bit in between massaging the finger.  Having the subject stand up and drop their hand may also help. 
 
Processing of Capi[INVESTIGATOR_126995]  
1. Once collected, process the microtainer tube for laboratory glucose analysis as follows:   
• Label all tubes with the subject number and a C or a V (Capi[INVESTIGATOR_126996]) as appropriate 
using a Sharpie marker.   
• Gently invert the microtainer tube several times to mix the anticoagulant.  
• Centrifuge the whole blood immediately to separate the plasma from the red blood cells.  Centrifugation must occur within [ADDRESS_663167].  Timing of all meter testing/centrifugation will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.   
• It is recommended that after centrifugation, the plasma is transferred from the microtainer tube to a micro/dispo tube or similar container.  Ensure the container is labeled and the cap is secured.  
• The capped plasma sample may be kept at room temperature for up to [ADDRESS_663168]:[ZIP_CODE] ,   Author: MT Viggiani   CONFIDENTIAL  
 Page 31 of 34  2. If testing on the YSI Analyzer is not completed within 4 hours of sample collection, the plasma 
should be refrigerated for up to 24 hours, after which it should be frozen until the sample is 
tested.  
3. Shipment of samples to Ascensia for glucose determinations may be recommended if YSI 
Analyzers do not meet the accuracy guidelines for the Ascensia traceability control sera. 
Arrangements will be made to ship the samples with dry ice via prepaid express ma il should it 
become necessary.  
4. Glucose values of the YSI replicates (controls and plasma) should be within 4 mg/dL or 4% of 
each other; if not, an additional assay should be run.  
5. Insufficient (or suspected to be insufficient) samples, missing samples, and other sample issues 
should be recorded in the CRF and on the YSI printout as appropriate.  If a sample is 
hemolyzed, record in the CRF.

 Page 32 of 34  Appendix C -  Instructions for Hematocrit Sample Preparation & Testing  
 
Staff  performing the hematocrit will be trained in this procedure during the initiation visit by [CONTACT_127028].    
1. Two hematocrit tubes will be obtained from each subject’s blood.  One tube will be measured 
and the result recorded on the form.   The second tube will be measured only if the first tube 
was not adequate for measurement.  Note:  
• Sample that is collected from venous blood will be collected in un -treated micro -
hematocrit tubes .   
• Samples collected from capi[INVESTIGATOR_512470] -
hematocrit tubes.    
2. Place a microhematocrit tube against the surface of the blood drop.  Do not place the opening 
of the tube flush against the skin or it will be occluded. 
3. Fill the microhematocrit tube about halfway.  Do not over -fill.  Then immediately place one of 
the microhematocrit tube openings in the clay sealant.  Press into the clay 2- [ADDRESS_663170] the sealed microhematocrit tube into the micro -centrifuge.   Note: it is very important to 
place the microhematocrit tube in centrifuge rotor with clay side pointed outward.   Spin for 
approx. 2 mins.  Use dialed setting on StatSpin centrifuge.  
5. Reading of hematocrit using StatSpin Crit- reader  
• After collection and centrifugation of hematocrit, place tube rotor in StatSpin Crit- reader, 
with clay side to the right.   
• Slide the marker on the crit -reader to the exact line where the clay and red blood cells meet 
(this is the “0” line).  Press set button until “0” shows in the display.   
• Then move marker all the way over to the other end of the tube to the exact line where the plasma ends – press the set button until “100” shows in the display.   
• Now you are ready to read the hematocrit result.  Slide the marker to the exact line where the red blood cells meet the plasma.  
• The result in the display is the hematocrit percentage for that sample.

 Page 34 of 34   Attachment 1:   Proper Handling of Ascensia YSI Serum Controls  
 
 
Ascensia R&D completed characterization of six -level serum controls purchased from Bio-
Techne® (formerly Bionostics).  During the characterization, staff observed that sample 
stratification during thawing can occur if the control vials are not handled judiciously.  The 
recommended procedure is as follows.  
 
1. Thaw the frozen control amber glass vials at [ADDRESS_663173] 10 times.  
3. Prepare an aliquot of each level in capped microcentrifuge tubes.  Cap tightly.  We prefer Fisherbrand
™ Microcentrifuge 0.5mL tubes (PN 02- 681-333) with O -ring seal caps (PN 02 -
681-358).  
4. Store any remaining control in the amber glass vials at [ADDRESS_663174] all thawed control —aliquot tubes and amber 
glass vials —after two weeks.  
8. Since slow thawing for 2- 3 days is recommended, it is advisable to keep an extra thawed set 
available for testing.

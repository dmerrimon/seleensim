1. BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE   
Failure to deliver care near the end of life  (EOL)  that reflects the needs, values and preferences of 
patients with advanced cancer remains a key shortcoming of our cancer care delivery system.1, [ADDRESS_238852] called for increased attention to advance care planning (ACP) to improve patient -
centered care near EOL.1-[ADDRESS_238853] effective and efficient ACP strategy to improve treatment decisions near EOL and ensure  
patients’ wishes are honored.  Two widely -used patient -facing ACP interventions entail sizeable 
differences in costs and complexity to deploy: (1) discussions with trained facilitators5 and (2) web -
based advance care planning using interactive videos.6, [ADDRESS_238854] never been 
compared directly; it is therefore unclear whether one form of ACP is more potent —and if so, for 
whom and under what circumstances.8, 9 Understanding the relative effectiveness of facilitated 
versus web -based ACP is important because facilitated  ACP requires far more resources.  This 
proposal addresses this evidence gap, using mixed methods to compare the effectiveness of 
facilitated ACP vs web -based ACP among 400 patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers.

2. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES  
The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and implementation costs of two different 
patient -facing ACP intervent ions among patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers: (1) 
facilitated ACP using the Respecting Choices ® model versus (2) web -based ACP using the 
PREPARE online ACP tool . The study includes longitudinal outcomes that define successful 
advance care planning based on a recent international consensus pan el10 and incorporate s a 
qualitative evaluation to identify factors that influence ACP effectiveness .  
 
Aim 1  will compare the effectiveness of f acilitated ACP versus web -based  ACP on patient and family 
caregiver outcomes. Using a validated, patient -reported measure, we will compare the interventions’ 
impact on ACP engagement at 12 weeks (1° outcome), ACP discussions with caregivers and 
clinicians , advance directive (AD)  completion, and caregiver symptoms of depression and anxiety. 
For patients who die during the study period, we will use validated, caregiver -reported measures to 
compare perceived quality of EOL care, patients’ EOL goal attainment, and bereaved caregiver 
symptoms of depression, anxiety , and post -traumatic stress.  
 
Aim [ADDRESS_238855] prior studies patients and clinicians preferred to delay the introduction of ACP to later 
in the illness trajectory rather than at the time of diagnosis.13-15 The validated ‘would not be surprised’ 
question is a simple and effective method for identifying patients with cancer at high risk of dying in 
one year (hazard ratio  7.8).16, [ADDRESS_238856] 
previously completed an AD because preferences change and patients may benefit from additional 
engagement in ACP with changing health contexts.12 We exclude patients < [ADDRESS_238857] ‘would not be surprised’ if the

3.2.2  Caregiver eligibility criteria  
Inclusion Criteria  18 years of age or older  
Family member or friend of an eligible patient  
Primary person involved in patient’s care and 
best able to participate in the study, as 
assessed by [CONTACT_200236] -up interviews  
Unable to complete the baseline interview  
3.2.[ADDRESS_238858] ‘would not be 
surprised’ if the patient died within one year . These criteria are not shared with patient and caregiver 
participants. Patients who meet initial criteria will be approached in -person by a clinical member of 
their oncology team who is already involved in their clinical care and offered a study recruitment 
brochure , or securely referred to the study team remotely and then contact[CONTACT_200237] .  
For in -person recruitment, the  referring clinic ian will obtain verbal permission from the patient before 
introducing a member of the research team. The research team  will document that verbal permission 
has been obtained before approaching a patient. We will not introduce the study at the first 
 April 17th, [ADDRESS_238859] in participating . 
 
A second invitation to participate will be offered to patients who decline initial participation (for 
example, because they are feeling too overwhelmed) , but give permission to be re -contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (either 
in person or by [CONTACT_648]) at a later date. Study staff will review the tracking system weekly to maintain 
recruitment fidelity.  
 
Patients who have provided consent to participate will be asked to identify a potential caregiver 
participant , designated by [CONTACT_200238]. Patients will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_200239].  All caregiver participants will provide 
informed consent  (either written or verbal option) . Patients unable to identify a caregiver will not be 
excluded because these patients also face treatment decisions near EOL and may benefit from 
ACP.  
 
Patients participating in an in -depth interview (Aim 3) will be asked to identify the clinician most 
involved in decisions about their care. Research staff will approach clinicians to introduce the study 
and offer a study information sheet. The consent dis cussion will be done at a time that is convenient 
for the clinician. All clinicians participating in an in -depth interview (Aim 3) will provide informed 
 April 17th, [ADDRESS_238860].  
 
Patient participants  will provide written informed consent using the validated teach -back method. 
This is a modified informed consent process developed for vulnerable and low -literate populations .20 
The process involves: using a consent form written below a 6 th-grade reading level and in a 14 -point 
font; reading  highlights from  the consent form to potential subjects; allowing time for questions  and 
discussion ; allowing participants  to read the form themselves, if desired; and verifying 
comprehension through repeated and targeted education until comprehension is achieved. If 
subjects require > 3 passes through the comprehension assessment, they will be deemed ineligible. 
Only after comprehension will w e ask patient participants to sign the consent form.  Patients recruited 
in-person by [CONTACT_200240] a paper copy of the consent form. Patients 
recruited remotely will be given three options to complete written consent: 1) paper consent form 
provided via the mail, 2) electronic consent form provided via email, and 3 ) electronic consent form 
sent through DocuSign, signed via electronic signature. All recruited study patients will be provided a 
copy of the completed consent form for their  records.  
 
Caregiver participants will also provide informed consent (either written or verbal option) and may 
participate in the teach -back with the patient if they are present for this discussion.  
 
The study staff will consent clinicians verbally at a time that is convenient for them. Study staff will 
conduct a consent discussion with the clinician describing study procedures, anticipated risks and 
benefits, emphasizing the voluntary nature of partic ipation, and eliciting any questions or concerns. 
After all questions have been addressed to the clinician’s  satisfaction, study staff will request verbal 
consent. Consent will be documented in the study's secure electronic database.

3.5  Intervention Arms  
Facilitated advance care planning arm  
Participants randomized to the facilitated ACP arm will participate in Respecting Choices®, a 
facilitated ACP conversation designed for adults with chronic incurable illness. Conversations are led 
by a nurse or social worker with supportive oncology experi ence who has been trained as a 
Respecting Choices® facilitator. Each patient will participate in up to three face -to-face, video,  or 
telephonic visits, lasting [ADDRESS_238861] with a call to each 
patient to establish r apport, determine the preferred visit mode, schedule the visit, and facilitate 
overall intervention participation. Visits  will include the patient’s medical decision maker (health care 
agent) , when available, and any other members of the family and/or caregivers the patient wishes to 
include. Visits will be held in a private location (oncology clinic, patient’s home, or research office) 
and audio -recorded for fidelity monitoring. During the ACP conversation  visit, facilitators will use the 
“First Steps® ACP  Conversation Guide: Adults with Chronic Illness” structured interview tool as a 
discussion roadmap and provide guidance in choosing a medical decision maker, exploring serious 
illness understanding and experiences, identifying goals and values, and making  future treatment 
decisions. Facilitators will provide a copy of the AD used throughout UPMC, assist with c ompletion 
and uploading to the patient’s electronic medical record, when appropriate, and make 
recommendations for communicating goals and sharing wr itten preferences.  
 
 
Web-based advance care planning arm  
Participants randomized to the web -based ACP arm will use the PREPARE web -based ACP tool  
(available at https://prepareforyourcare.org ) PREPARE is literacy - and culturally -appropriate and 
HIPAA -compliant. Instructions for accessing and using a secure, PEACe -compare study version of 
the PREPARE website, as well as a copy of the AD used throughout UPMC , will be shared with 
participants upon randomization. Patients and their caregivers review the 5 steps of PREPARE 
(approximately 10 minutes per step) and create an action plan for each step. After completing the 
steps, patients have the option of printing o ut a Summary and Action Plan. The website can be 
reviewed on a home computer or on a tablet in the patient’s oncology practice. Website analytic s will 
be provided to the research staff to gauge patient participation. Patients who have not logged on to 
the website will be called by [CONTACT_200241].  During the 
check -in call, study staff will offer three options to participants in order to help them overcome any 
 April 17th, 2024  
  
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________   
 
18 
 
practical or technological barriers  preventing the patient from accessing the website: 1) to review the 
website on a study -supplied tablet during the patient’s next oncology clinical visit, 2) to help walk 
them through signing up for the website initially, and 3) setting a goal date to revie w the website. If 
patients do not choose any of these options, they will be reminded that accessing the website is part 
of their study participation, and will be called again in a few weeks if they have not logged on to the 
website.  
3.6  Randomization Procedures  
Upon completion of baseline patient and caregiver interviews, patient -caregiver pairs will be 
randomized 1:[ADDRESS_238862] been 
randomized to . 
 
The randomization sequence will be generated by [CONTACT_200242]. The statistician will use R (R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing, Vienna, Austria) to generate a randomization s equence that will be fed into the web -
based database portal, so that each patient -caregiver pair  will be randomly assigned to a group upon 
completion of their baseline interview.  
 
3.7  Blinding  
All outcome assessments will be conducted by [CONTACT_200243] -up contacts to assess intervention completion. At the start of each outcome 
assessment interview, participants are reminded not to discu ss study materials with research staff. It 
is not possible to blind patient and caregiver participants. However, they are told during the consent 
process that there is a “50/50 chance” of getting one of two different tools to help patients have a 
voice in their care, and patient/caregiver participants provide informed consent before randomization. 
 April 17th, 2024  
  
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________   
 
19 
 
We obtain clinicians’ permission to recruit their patients but do not share information on 
randomization or involve clinicians in intervention administration. However, it is possible that 
participants will discuss ACP participation with their clinicians.  
3.8  Intervention Fidelity  
Training of Respecting Choices ® ACP facilitators is overseen by [CONTACT_200244] ® 
staff members. We train nurses (RNs) or social workers (SWs) because these non -physician 
members of the clinical team are typi[INVESTIGATOR_200222], maximizing feasibility of future dissemination. We se lect facilitators who 
do not provide other clinical duties at participating sites to guard against potential contamination. 
Clinical leaders at participating sites are asked to meet with and approve ACP facilitators to ensure 
oncology -relevant experience a nd mutual trust. Selected facilitators complete on-line prerequisite 
modules and attend a competency -based , in-person  Respecting Choices ® ACP Facilitator 
Certification program. Participants demonstrate competency in ACP facilitation through role play 
demonstration in small group observation and feedback. Participants develop a plan for 
improvement of identified skill deficits as needed.  Up on completion of trainin g, facilitators will 
conduct several mock ACP sess ions using case scenarios provided by [CONTACT_200245]® while 
being observed by [CONTACT_200246].  To ensure consistent delivery of 
facilitated ACP at participating sites, identify any problems in delivery that may require immediate 
remediation or modifications in future settings, a nd reduce drift in adherence to ACP protocols over 
time, all ACP sessions conducted during the study are audio -recorded. Each month, one to two 
audio-recordings per facilitator are  reviewed and scored for fidelity to key constructs  per Respect ing 
Choices® evaluation standards . Feedback on reviewed sessions is discussed during regular 
intervention team meetings and with a consultant from Respecting Choices®.  
 
We monitor fidelity in the PREP ARE intervention arm by [CONTACT_200247] a secure, study -
specific website that allows us to track the number of log -ins and number of ACP steps completed by 
[CONTACT_20908] . Analytics data will be examined by [CONTACT_137980] -blinded research staff member . 
 
Participants in both arms will receive check -in calls between baseline and the 12 week follow -up. 
Participants in the Respecting Choices®  arm will be called to schedule the Respecting Choices®  
intervention visits with an ACP Facilitator. Participants in the PREPARE arm will be called (up to 
 April 17th, 2024  
  
 ________________________________ ________________________________ ________________________________ ________   
 
20 
 
three times ) to assess for and troubleshoot any participa tion issues if they have not logged on to the 
PREPARE website.  
 
All contacts with study participants follow standardized study scripts.  All staff members are 
rigorously trained to follow study operating procedures and are not permitted to conduct study tasks 
independently until they have been observed and demonstrated  mastery.  
 
3.9  Data Collection Methods  
We will use a secure electronic System for Data Management (eSYSDM) for all data entry and 
management. To minimize participant burden and disruption to clinical activities, baseline surveys 
may be completed either in -person, by [CONTACT_756], or by [CONTACT_2319]. Medical record reviews will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_200248]. Twelve -week and bereavement assessments will be 
conducted via telephone by [CONTACT_200249]. In the event a 
participant is unable to complete the interview by [CONTACT_200250], a 
paper copy will be mailed. All data from paper documents will be entered into the eSYSDM by 
[CONTACT_200251]. Original paper source 
documents will be filed and locked in a filing cabinet a ccessible only by [CONTACT_200252].  
 
3.10 Follow -up and Retention  
Follow -up assessments will be conducted with patients and caregivers at 12 weeks , and with 
caregivers at bereavement (12 weeks or later after patient’s death). To enhance retention, we 
distribute contact [CONTACT_200253], mail reminder cards, mail 
answer guides prior to telephone assessments, and send condolence cards to referred family 
caregivers when a p atient dies. Our data collection strategy is designed to minimize participant 
burden by [CONTACT_200254][INVESTIGATOR_2268] -tested with this population, administering 
patient and caregiver interviews by [CONTACT_200255], and providing compensation . Enrolled pa tients  and 
caregivers  will be paid $25 each upon completion of the 12 -week follow -up assessment. Enrolled 
caregivers will be paid $25 each upon completion of the bereavement assessment, if applicable.

Enrolled patients and caregivers will be paid an additional $[ADDRESS_238863] of reasons for withdrawal from previous studies (e.g., not enough time ,

burden .27 
 
4.3  Secondary Patient and Caregiver Outcomes  
We will additionally measure ACP discussions with caregivers, ACP discussions with clinicians, and 
AD completion (using both a single question and by [CONTACT_200256]).  For patients who die during the study period, w e chose caregiver -reported 
measures of goal -concordant EOL care because these validated measures capture overall receipt of 
goal-concordant care in the last month of life and incorporate the perspectives of bereaved family 
members. In contrast, measuring r eceipt of goal -concordant EOL care based on chart review does 
not account for frequently -encountered situations in which documented ADs do not reflect the 
 April 17th, [ADDRESS_238866] -traumatic stress 
symptoms because many patients cite easing the burden on families as a motivator of ACP and it is 
possible that family caregivers may experience less distress after participat ing in a  facilitated ACP 
intervention.

intervention most effective .”44 
 
Patients and caregivers will be invited to participate in in -depth interviews after completing trial 
outcome assessments (12 -week and bereavement, respectively) to avoid impacting trial integrity. 
We will recruit equal numbers of participants from each ACP  intervention arm. Within each 
intervention arm, we will include participants for whom the intervention was succesful (defined as an 
increase in ACP engagement at 12 weeks) and not successful (defined as no increase in ACP 
engagement at 12 weeks). This sam pling strategy will ensure elicitation of  a spectrum of 
experiences regarding what makes each intervention work (or not work) for changing ACP 
behaviors. We will aim for linked patient -caregiver pairs because caregivers may lend additional 
perspective on patient EOL experiences. Because ACP also involves clinicians and healthcare 
systems, we will ask patients to identify a clinician most involved in decisions about their care and 
interview these stakeholders after patient and caregiver interviews have been  completed. As 
recommended for qualitative research, the sample size is not fixed. Rather, we will conduct 
interviews until thematic saturation is reached, meaning no new themes emerge from the data. 
Based on our prior work, we anticipate that this will in volve at least  60 patients  and 60 caregivers  
and approximately 60 clinicians .45-48 
 
Interviews will be conducted using semi -structured interview guides informed by (1) a theoretical 
framework for ACP based on behavior change theory and (2) the literature on factors that may affect 
the ability of ACP interventions to improve ACP outcomes. Interview guides will be developed by a 
multidisciplinary group (including patient and caregiver representatives) and pi[INVESTIGATOR_60528] [ADDRESS_238874] basic demographic data from participants at time of enrollment, including age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, religion, social support (8 -item modified Medical Outcomes Study Social Support

5. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
5.1  Baseline Data  
We will evaluate the statistical properties of baseline and follow -up outcome measures, including 
potential outliers, normality, and missing data, using summary statistics and graphical tools. 
Participant demographics and clinical characteristics will be presented as frequency (%) for 
categorical variables and mean (standard  deviation) for continuous variables (or median and range 
for continuous variables with heavily skewed distributions). Results will be reported following the 
CONSORT guideline.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_238877] for possible clustering of patients seen by [CONTACT_200259], we will include random effects for facilitators (for patients in the facilitated ACP 
group only) and oncologists.  
 
The same analytic approach will be used for secondary outcomes: perceived quality of EOL care 
and caregiver symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD. Binary outcomes such as ACP 
discussions, AD completion, documented care goals, and receipt of goal -concord ant EOL care will 
be compared using mixed effect logistic regression with the same set of fixed effects and random 
effects as in the models for continuous outcomes. We will also compare the rates of completion of 
intervention between the two intervention g roups, using the same model as for other binary 
outcomes.  
 
Analyses of health care utilization data will use GLMM  (generalized linear mixed model) , with logit 
link (binary distribution) for dichotomous (yes/no) health care outcomes such as chemotherapy within 
last [ADDRESS_238878] and report all reasons for study drop -out using a withdrawal/termination 
form to assess the missing data mechanism (missing completely at random, missing at ran dom, or 
non-ignorable missingness, meaning the data missingness is related to the actual value). We will 
conduct sensitivity analyses for primary and secondary outcomes using several validated methods: 
(1) complete case analyses, which assumes missing comp letely at random; (2) multiple imputation 
using M=10 imputations, which assumes missing at random; and (3) assigning poor scores and 
good scores for missing values differentially by [CONTACT_1570], which aligns with non -ignorable 
missingness.  
 
5.4  Interim & Final Analyses  
We will not have any planned interim looks for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34303].  The final analyses will be 
conducted once study follow -up is complete, after all data is cleaned and the study database is 
locked.   
 
5.5  Sample Size and Power Calculations  
We selected our sample size to provide ample power to assess differences in the primary outcome —
ACP engagement —as well as secondary patient, caregiver, and healthcare utilization outcomes. All 
calculations were conducted using α=0.05, based on two -sample t -tests for continuous outcomes 
and chi -squared tests for binary outcomes. To adjust for possible clustering effect within each 
oncologist, we used the design effect (DE=1+[(1+CV²)m -1)]ρ), where CV=the coefficien t of variation 
for cluster size58 and m=the number of patients per oncologist. Conservatively estimating a 25% loss

to follow -up for patient -reported outcomes, our sample size will provide >98% power to detect a 
moderate effect size (Cohen’s d=0.5) in our primary outcome —ACP engagement.[ADDRESS_238879] 
size (0.35 on a 5 -point score, based on a SD of 0.7),[ADDRESS_238880] 
>78% power to detect a 15% difference in rates of ACP discussions with family and physicians 
between groups (assuming discussion rates of 25% in the web -based arm) and >99% power to 
detect a 20% difference in rates of AD completion (assuming an AD completion rate of 50% in the 
web-based ACP arm). Power is similarly adequate for all caregiver -reported outcomes, assuming a 
75% caregiver participation rate and 15% loss to follow -up, which results in an effective sample size 
of 254.  For caregiver -reported quality of EOL care we will have 97.6% power to detect a moderate 
effect size28, and for caregiver anxiety and depression we will have 83.2% power to detect a clinically 
meaningful difference (Cohen’s d=0.368).59 Anticipating that 90% of patients will die during the study 
period (resulting in an effective sample size of 360), we will have >73 -78%  power to detect an 8% 
absolute decrease in ICU admissions and chemotherapy use at the EOL and >80% power to detect 
a 15% decrease in no hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200225] ≤ [ADDRESS_238881] mainly of 
concerns about  invasion of privacy and perceived burden or emotional upset from completing 
questionnaires about personal physical and mental health and/or the health of a loved one.  In 
addition, there are potential risks to participants in both arms of emotional upset caused by [CONTACT_200260]. However, based 
on prior experience with bo th interventions, these potential risks are quite small.  For example, in a 
prior trial of the PREPARE web -based ACP intervention, there were no adverse events and there 
was no increase in depression or anxiety when compared to written ADs alone.6 In a prior trial of 
facilitated ACP using the Respecting Choices ® model, facilitated ACP was associated with less 
stress, anxiety and depression among bereaved family members when compared to a control 
group.[ADDRESS_238882] names and other personally identifying information only on the tracking 
forms; all other material will use uniq ue identification numbers. Identifying information and de -
identified study records will be kept in separate locked file cabinets and separate files on password 
 April 17th, [ADDRESS_238883], to address potential emotional upset from answering questions about personal physical and 
mental health and/or the health of a loved one, study staff  will remind participants of the voluntary 
nature of study participation and notify them at the start of administration of each questionnaire that 
they are free to skip or decline any questions they wish or to discontinue participation at any time, if 
desired. If a participant's emotional upset escalates while completing study procedures over the 
phone, the study coordinator/research assistant will follow a safety protocol that we have 
successfully deployed in our prior work (see Telephone Safety Protocol in Appendix ). 
 
If a participant experiences emotional upset while in the clinical setting undergoing study procedures, 
the ACP facilitator will be with participants.  These ACP facilitators are experienced nurses  who will 
receive additional training in supportive care in their role as Respecting Choices ® ACP facilitators.  
In addition, they will have a palliative care physician investigator available at all times by [CONTACT_200261]. They will therefore be capable of handling these issues appropriately.  
 
Participants will be given the option of in -person or remote (telephonic or video chat) intervention 
delivery. Remote intervention delivery will be completed utilizing secure, HIPAA -compliant audio and 
visual platforms. In order to decrease the burdens of travel and scheduling, we will make every 
attempt to schedule in-person facilitated ACP sessions at a time and place that is convenient for 
patients.  Directions and parking information will be provided to participants prior to the date of their 
scheduled s ession to facilitate an easier travel plan. Participants will receive parking vouchers, if 
they choose to complete study procedures at the research office. Additionally, participants 
randomized to the Respecting Choices ® arm of the study will have the option of having the ACP 
facilitator come to their homes to conduct the study visit , when appropriate and advisable . 
 
 April 17th, [ADDRESS_238884] is not required for this minimal risk trial. The study PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators will meet monthly to review study progress and any new developments or 
changes to the risk -benefit ratio.  In addition, data quality will be reviewed quarterly by [CONTACT_200262].  
 
The data and safety monitoring plan will address the following areas: (1) the progress of the 
research study, including assessment of data quality and timeliness , and participant recruitment, 
accrual, and reten tion; (2) review of adverse event data to determine whether or not there is any 
change to the anticipated risk -benefit ratio of study participation, and whether or not the study should 
continue as originally designed , or be changed or terminated; (3) assessment of external factors or 
relevant informat ion; (4) review of study procedures designed to protect the privacy of the research 
participants and the confidentiality of their research data. A yearly summary will be submitted to the 
University of  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_200226] (HRPO)  during annual IRB renewal.   
 
6.3.1  Adverse Event Monitoring  
All adverse events will be tracked by [CONTACT_200263] (major complaints 
about the intervention or safety protocol triggers) will be brought to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_200227]. The 
statistician will run a mortality report for review at quarter ly data quality meetings.  
 
Adverse events, serious adverse events  (SAEs) , and unanticipated problems  (UAPs)  will be 
monitored using standard definitions. Deaths (other than those resulting from suicide) and

successful completion of the baseline evaluations, subjects 
will be enrolled and will receive the first dose of FCM (Day 
0). The second FCM dose will occur [ADDRESS_706193] dose, participants will return to the 
clinic for final safety and efficacy assessments.  Once all 
assessment s are complete the participant will exit the study . 
An unsatisfactory response  to oral iron ( i.e., an increase in 
hemoglobin ( Hgb) of <1 g/dL from baseline) will be defined 
as non -responders to oral iron treatment.  Non -responders 
who continue to meet all inclusion criteria (including Hgb 
<11 g/dL) and no ne of the exclusion criteria will receive 1 
course of FCM.  
Inclusion Criteria:  1. Unsatisfactory response to oral iron or those that required 
a concomitant intervention, (defined as, blood

1.1. Treatment of Iron Deficiency Anemia  
Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) remains the most common nutritional deficiency in 
children in the [LOCATION_002] (US)  [Looker , 1997] . Rapid growth, insufficient dietary 
intake, and limited absorption of dietary iron combine to place children at increased risk 
for iron deficiency. Iron malabsorption, gastrointestinal blood loss, or iatrogenesis due to 
repeated blood sampling all represent commo n clinical mechanisms that can result in 
IDA.  Even when recognized, some children are unable to tolerate prescribed oral iron 
supplementation or are unresponsive to it  [Kulnigg , 2006] . Anemia may also decrease 
survival rates in adults and children with chronic renal impairment where it is a 
commonly encountered problem  [Foley , 1996; Stapl es, 2010] . In addition, under -
recognized or inadequately treated anemia is likely the most common extra -intestinal 
manifestation of IBD in children, and it can result in a decr ease in quality of life and 
increased morbidity, inclusive of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], in affected patients  [Kulnigg , 2006] . 
Non-hematologic consequences of iron deficiency in ch ildren include poor weight gain, 
anorexia, irritability, decreased attention span, exercise intolerance, and decreased 
physical activity  [Wharton , 1999] . Existing data suggests that chronic IDA in infants and 
toddlers is associated with long -term diminished mental, motor, and behavioral 
functioning.   Although the exact relationship between iron deficiency and its detrimental 
effects on growth and developm ent is not well -understood, it appears that these effects do 
not occur until iron deficiency becomes severe and chronic enough to produce anemia  
[Kazal, 2002] . 
Options for cor recting iron deficiency include both oral and parenteral formulations. As 
previously described, some children are unable to tolerate or are non -responsive to oral 
iron.  Blood transfusion is an option to treat anemia and replete iron stores, but often 
scarce supply, as well as the potential risk of blood -borne pathogens, limits its use to 
severely ill or clinically unstable patients  [Kulnigg , 2006] . In view of the limitati ons 
associated with oral iron administration or blood transfusions, IV iron administration is 
an important therapeutic option for use in patients with IDA  [Powers , 2014] . 
Multiple parenteral iron products are available. These products vary in the way that iron 
is complexed, which influences the total amount of iron that may be administered during 
a single administration. Numerous other differences differentiate the products.  However, 
all appear to effectively release iron post administration and can restore iron deficit in the 
patient. Previous studies with parenteral iron sucrose (Venofer®) have been performed in 
the pediatric population  [Michaud , 2002; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_541476] , 2008; Surico , 2002]. Iron doses have 
varied in these studies, and the data demonstrates the efficacy and safety of Venofer® in 
doses up to 7 mg iron/kg (or 200 mg) administered over 3 minutes, which was shown to 
be beneficial to both the child and health care facility  [Michaud , 2002] . 
Ferric Carboxymaltose  has been characterized as an iron complex (Type 1) with a 
molecular mass of about 150,000 Daltons. The solution is a dark brown color  with a near 
CONFIDENTIAL

 Administrative Change 1 Date:  Final 03 December 2019  
 
Page 14 of 40 neutral pH (5.0 to 7.0) and a physiological osmolarity permitting administration of higher 
single doses in short time periods. Although no randomized interventional studies have 
been completed  with FCM in the pediatric population to date, the product has been used 
successfully to address iron deficiency in pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis and 
Crohn’s disease. A non -interventional, retrospective observational data collection 
reported F CM exposure in 79 patients aged 2 to 18 years with a mean age of 12.7 years.  
In these patients, FCM was found to be safe, well -tolerated, and effective in increasing 
Hgb, ferritin, and TSAT  [Favreau , 2017] . 
The proposed study will provide safety and efficacy data on the use of FCM in pediatric 
patients (aged between 1 and 1 8 years) with IDA. FCM will be administered in 2 doses at 
15 mg/kg maximum single dose of 750 mg with  a total maximum cumulative dose of 
1500 mg.   The ability to infuse higher doses of elemental iron should permit repletion in 
fewer overall infusions, and in doing so may ultimately permit fewer visits to the treating 
facilities.  
1.2. Ferric Carboxymaltose  
1.2.1.  Key features of Ferric Carboxymaltose  
Ferric Carboxymaltose injection is a stable, non -dextran, Type I polynuclear 
iron (III)-hydroxide carbohydrate complex developed as an IV iron replacement therapy 
for the treatment of IDA. After IV administration, FCM is m ainly found in the liver, 
spleen, and bone marrow.  The iron slowly dissociates from the complex and can be 
efficiently used in the bone marrow for Hgb synthesis.  The carbohydrate moiety of FCM 
is metabolized by [CONTACT_416699].   
1.2.2.  Ferric Carboxymal tose versus Other Parenteral Iron Agents  
There is considerable efficacy and safety data in the literature with respect to existing 
parenteral iron formulations  [Stapl es, 2010] . However, prior to the approval of non -
dextran formulations, the risk of systemic adverse reactions restricted their use. FCM 
offers significant advantages compared to other available IV iron preparations.  
Iron dextran, the first parenteral iron pro duct available in the US, has been associated 
with an incidence of anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions (i.e., dyspnea, wheezing, 
hypotension, urticaria, angioedema) as high as 1.7%  [Michaud , 2002] .  Over the last 
[ADDRESS_706199] been attributed to the use of IV iron dextran  [Fishbane , 2003] .  
The high incidence of anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions is believed to be caused by [CONTACT_541488].  Although some have suggested t hat high 
molecu lar weight iron dextran is associated with a higher rate of life threatening adverse 
events and anaphylactic reactions in comparis on to low molecular weight  iron dextran, 
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was unable to find a clear difference after  
an examination of post -marketing data, clinical trial data, death certificates, and 
emergency room diagnoses  [Pi[INVESTIGATOR_541476] , 2008] .  Iron dextran is limited to second line therapy 
for treatment of iron deficiency.   
CONFIDENTIAL  
American Regent , Inc.   Protocol No.: 1VIT18045  
 Administrative Change 1 Date:  Final [ADDRESS_706200] significant dosage and 
administration rate limitations.  If the body’s ability to sequester, store, and transport 
infused iron is overwhelmed, a reaction to excess free iron in circulation, referred to as a 
bioactive iron reaction, may occur.  Iron sucrose and iron gluconate preparations carry a 
significant ris k of inducing a bioactive iron reaction when delivered at higher doses. 
These reactions are characterized by [CONTACT_27913] (without allergic signs) accompanied by 
[CONTACT_416701], abdomen, flank and/or nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea  [Van Wyck , 
2004] .  
Due to its structure, FCM is more stable than iron gluconate and iron sucrose, and this 
results in a slower delivery of the complexed iron to endogenous iron binding sites.  
These characteristics of FCM make it possible to administer much higher single doses 
over shorter periods of time than iron gluconate or iron sucrose, resulting in the need for 
fewer administrations to replete iron stores.   
2. TRIAL OBJECTIVE  
2.1. Primary Objecti ve 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate  the efficacy and safety of IV FCM in 
pediatric participants who have IDA.  
3. OVERALL STUDY DESIGN  AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a single arm, open -label, multi -center, multi -national, non -randomized study that 
will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a one course treatment with FCM in participants 
who had an unsatisfactory response to oral iron in study 1VIT17044 . 
Subjects will have an EOS Visit (Day 35) from the 1VIT17044  study to qualify for entry.  
Subjects will then be screened, meet all inclusion criteria, no exclusion criteria and have a 
baseline evaluation.  Based on the successful completion of the baseline evaluations, 
subjects will be enrolled and will receive the fir st dose of FCM (Day 0). The second 
FCM dose should occur [ADDRESS_706201] dose, participants will retur n to the clinic for final safety and efficacy 
assessments.  Once all assessments are complete the participant will exit the study.  
An unsatisfactory response  to oral iron ( i.e., an increase in Hgb of <1 g/dL from 
baseline ) will be defined as non -responders  to oral iron treatment.  Non -responders who 
continue to meet all inclusion criteria (including Hgb <11 g/dL) and none of the 
exclusion criteria will receive 1 course of FCM.

Page 16 of 40 3.2. Rationale of Study Design  
The primary objective in this study is to allow partici pants who were randomized to 
receive oral iron in the 1VIT17044 trial and who had an unsatisfactory  response to oral 
iron or those that required a concomitant intervention, (defined as, blood transfusion, use 
of IV or oral iron outside of protocol, increas e in erythropoietin for any reason [Day 0 
thru Day 35 of study protocol 1VIT17044 ], change in IBD treatment) to receive one 
course of FCM.  This course of FCM will consist of two doses of FCM at 15 mg/kg 
(maximum single dose of 750 mg), separated by [CONTACT_140496].  
This study is a rollover for study 1VIT17044 which is an open label, multi -center, multi -
national, randomized, active -control parallel group study that will evaluate  the efficacy 
and safety of FCM in pediatric participants, ages 1 to 18 years with ir on deficiency 
anemia.

5. STUDY DRUG  
5.1. Formulation, Packaging and Storage  
The investigational medication to be used in this study [supplied by [CONTACT_541489] , 
Inc.] will have  been prepared according to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).  
FCM (trade name, Injectafer®) will be supplied as 15 m L vials, containing 750 mg of iron 
as 5% w/v iron containing a polynuclear iron(III) -hydroxide 4(R) –(poly -(14)-O  -D-
glucopyranosyl) -oxy-2 (R), 3(S), 5(R), 6 -tetrahydroxy -hexonate complex in a solution of 
water for injection [50 mg/m L] and will be labeled according to FDA investigational 
regulatory requirements.   
FCM must be kept in a secure place at the investigational site, and stored a t room 
temperature ( see [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia) .  The study medication should not be 
frozen.  Vials of FCM may not be used for more than 1 dose, or for more than 1 
participant.  All FCM vials and syringes (used and unused) should be kept by [CONTACT_541490]. Following reconciliation, sites may destroy used 
and unused study drug on site using local procedures, provided a drug destruction policy 
is in place, or it may be returned to American Regent , Inc.  
5.2. Drug Administrati on/Regimen  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_541477]. All subjects will be dosed with FCM based on the Hgb, TSAT and ferritin 
values from the last scheduled visit in the 1VIT17044  study.   
Partic ipants  will receive a dose of FCM at 15 mg/kg to a maximum single dose of 750 
mg (whichever is smaller) on Days 0 and 7 for a maximum total dose of 1500 mg. FCM

Page 20 of 40 will be administered as either an undiluted IV push at a rate of 100 mgs (2  mL)/minute 
OR in no  more than 250 mL of normal saline and infused over 15 minutes.  
5.3. IV Medication Precautions  
When administering FCM, the following precautions will be taken:  
 The participant will be evaluated clinically prior to drug administration to assess the 
development o f clinically -significant conditions.   
 The vials will be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration before 
use.  If noted, the vial will not be used, and the Investigator or his designee will 
notify the sponsor or sponsor’s designee for re placement of the study drug, and for 
direction on the return of the unused vial.  
 Heart rate and blood pressure will be assessed pre -, immediately post  (within 5 
minutes) , and [ADDRESS_706206] administration.  Participants will be discharged from 
the site by  [CONTACT_541491] 30 minutes after the administration is completed.  
 The participant will be monitored for at least 30 minutes for serious acute reactions 
as hypersensitivity or bioac tive (labile) iron reactions to non -dextran IV iron 
products have rarely been reported. The reactions include: hypotension, loss of 
consciousness, bronchospasm with dyspnea, shortness of breath, and seizures.  
 In the event a serious acute reaction is seen, the site must have the capability to 
provide appropriate resuscitation measures. These may include IV normal 
saline , IV epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], steroids, and/or antihistamines.  
5.4. Drug Accountability  
Investigators will keep  records of the receipt, administration and return of the study drug 
(FCM).  They will not allow the study drug to be used for purposes other than as directed 
by [CONTACT_3181].  The investigator agrees that he/she will not supply study medication to 
any pe rsons other than those enrolled in the study, or to investigators not listed on the 
FDA 1572. When the study is completed, or if it is prematurely terminated, a final 
inventory of all clinical supplies must be compi[INVESTIGATOR_541478] , Inc., or destroyed on site, per the site’s 
documented locally accepted policies. All data regarding the study drug must be recorded 
as per the Monitoring Plan.   
5.5. Concomitant Medication  
All concomitant medications will be recorded in the eCRF from 30 days prior to consent.

7. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
7.1. Adverse Events  
Any untoward medical event experienced by a participant  during the course of this 
clinical trial, whether or not it is related to the investigational product, at any dose, is 
considered an adverse event (AE).  
For any laboratory abnormality, the investigator will make a judgment as to its clinical 
significance . If the laboratory value is outside the normal limits and is felt to represent a 
clinically significant worsening from the baseline value, it should be considered an 
adverse event and should be recorded on the Adverse Events  page of the electronic case 
report form ( eCRF ). If the laboratory value is outside the normal range, but not an 
adverse event, the investigator should comment on the findings (i.e., “not clinically 
significant” or “unchanged from baseline”) in the source documentation [laboratory 
CONFIDENTIAL  
American Regent , Inc.   Protocol No.: 1VIT18045  
 Administrative Change 1 Date:  Final 03 December 2019  
 
Page 25 of 40 repor t]. All laboratory values at the EOS /Day [ADDRESS_706210] been deemed clinical 
significant by [CONTACT_541493].  
To quantify the severity of adverse events, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) -Common 
Term inology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version [ADDRESS_706211], the investigator should use Table 2 to assign 
the adverse event grade.  
Table 2 Grading of Adverse Event Severity  
Grade  Adjective  Description  
1 Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention 
indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities 
of daily living (i.e., preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16208] , using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.)  
3 Severe  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -
threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24599]; disabling; limiting self -care 
activities of daily living (i.e., bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the to ilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden.)  
4 Life-threatening  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated.  
5 Death  Results in death due to the AE  
 
Timing:  Non-serious AE will be reported from the initial treatment with FCM  through 
the completion of the study Day 35. Adverse events will be captured [ADDRESS_706212] 
dose of study drug for participants who receive study drug and terminate early from the 
trial. This can be completed via a phone call. All ongoing AE’s relate d to FCM  should be 
followed until they are no longer related, have taken a confounding medication or return 
to baseline grade . 
Relationship (Causality) : The Investigator will be asked to document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_541479]*  as follows:  
 NONE  There is no evidence of any causal relationship  
 UNLIKELY  There is little evidence to suggest there is a causal 
relationship. There is another reasonable explanation  for the 
CONFIDENTIAL  
American Regent , Inc.   Protocol No.: 1VIT18045  
 Administrative Change 1 Date:  Final 03 December 2019  
 
Page 26 of 40 event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant treatments).  
 POSSIBLE  There is some  evidence to suggest a causal relationship (i.e. 
there is a reasonable  possibility that the adverse experience 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_416714]). However, the influence 
of other factors may have contributed  to the event (e.g., the 
participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events).  
 PROBABLE  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely  
*For the purpose of this trial, study drug is defined as FCM.  
7.2. Reporting of Adverse Events  
Adverse experiences will be elicited by [CONTACT_416715] “Have you noticed 
any problems?”  Participants will be encouraged to report adverse events at their onset.   
Any adverse experience spontaneously reported by , elicited from the participant, or 
observed by [CONTACT_5983], shall be recorded on the appropriate Adverse 
Event page of the eCRF. The investigator will record the date and time of onset, severity, 
the relationship to study medication, the date and time of resolution (or the fact that the 
event is still continuing), the action taken, and the outcome of the adverse experience on 
the Adverse Event page of the eCRF. Whenever possible, the investigator should group 
together, into a single term, signs and symptoms which constitute a single diagnosis. For 
example, cough, rhinitis and sneezing might be grouped together as "upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_42977]."  
7.3. Serious Adverse Events  
Definition : An adverse event is classified as SERIOUS if it meets any one of the 
following criteria:  
 Death  
 Life-Threatening:  The participant was at substantial risk of dying at the time of the 
adverse event or it is suspected that the use or continued use of the product would 
result in the participant's death.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged):  Required admission to the ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_541480] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  
 Disability: Resulted in a significant, persistent, or permanent change, impairment, 
damage or disruption in the participant’s body function/structure, physical activities 
or quality of life.  
 Congenital Anomaly/Bir th Defect .

Page 27 of 40  Important medical events:  Other medically important events that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13046], may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
A distinction should be drawn betw een SAE and severe AE.  A SAE is a major 
experience of its type.  A SAE is not necessarily serious: e.g. nausea, which persists for 
several hours, may be considered severe nausea, but it is not an SAE.  On the other hand 
a stroke, which results in only a l imited degree of disability may be considered a mild 
stroke, but would be a SAE.  
Timing:  All SAEs will be reported from the day of initial treatment with * study drug  
through the completion of the study Day 35.  Serious adverse events will be captured [ADDRESS_706213] dose of study drug for participants who terminate early from the trial. 
This can be completed via a phone call. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541481] a historical 
condition (present prior to initial treatment with study drug or prescheduled prior  to 
treatment with study drug) that has not increased in severity or led to prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541482] a SAE. All reported SAE should be followed until 
they are no longer serious or return to baseline grade.   
Reporting:  Any SAE , starting with the first dose of study drug, that is to be reported (as 
outlined in Timing section above) must be reported immediately ( within 24 hours of 
learning of the event ) to American Regent , Inc. by [CONTACT_756], email and/or fax of the 
written SAE re port form to the contacts listed below:

American Regent, Inc.  
Phone: (800) 734 -9236  
Fax: (610) 650 -0170  
Email: [EMAIL_10360]  
The local investigator is responsible for reporting SAEs to their local Institutional Review 
Board  (IRB) / Ethics Committee based on local reporting guidelines (which may be 
different than those specified in this protocol). The responsible investigator should 
institute appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures and keep the participant under 
observation for as long as is medically indicated.  
8. STATISTICS  
Continuous variables will be summarized in terms of the number of observations, mean, 
standard deviation  (SD) , median, Q1, Q3, minimum and maximum. Other descriptive 
statistics (e.g., coefficient of variation) may be reported when appropriate. Categorical 
variables will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages.   
Generally, data will be summarized by [CONTACT_474306].  However, data from both 
unscheduled and scheduled will be used for determination of l ast observed value, and in 
worst - or best -case changes and/or shifts from baseline. Assessment windows will not be

Page 28 of 40 defined for the purpose of classifying measurements obtained outside scheduled 
assessment times.  
A complete description of the statistical an alyses and methods will be available in a 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized before the database is locked.  
8.1. Stratification/Randomization  
This is a  non-randomized, single arm study.  
8.2. Analysis Populations  
Safety Population  
The safety population will consist of all participants who received at least one dose of 
study drug.   
8.3. Disposition and Baseline Characteristics  
The number of participants in each investigative site will be summarized.  The number of 
participants who are sc reened, treated, prematurely discontinue, and complete the study 
will be summarized.    
The clinical team will identify deviations and the deviations will be identified in the 
database.  Participants with clinically important protocol deviations will be su mmarized.  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
or frequency counts.  
8.4. Endpoints and Definitions  
8.4.1.  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the change in Hgb from baseline to day 35.  Descriptive statistics 
will be provided for the baseline Hgb, the day 35 Hgb, and the within -participant change 
from baseline.  The change in Hgb from baseline to day 35 will be analyzed using paired 
t-tests.  
8.4.2.  Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include:  
 Change in fer ritin from baseline to Day 35  
 Change in TSAT from baseline to Day 35  
 Changes from baseline in Hgb, ferritin, TSAT, and CHr throughout the study  
Details of analyses for these endpoint s will be outlined in the SAP.

Page 29 of 40 8.4.3.  Missing Data  
A participant who withdraws f rom the study for any reason will be included in the 
analyses regardless of time on study. Methods for handling withdrawals and missing data 
will be specific to each endpoint to be analyzed. Missing data will not be imputed for 
descriptive statistical summ aries in safety or efficacy. Details will be provided in the 
SAP.  
8.5. Analyses of Safety  
8.5.1.  Study Drug Exposure  
The number of infusions and total administered amount of iron will be summarized 
descriptively.  
8.5.2.  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) using 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary.  
The number and percent of participants who report treatment emergent AE ( TEAE ) will 
be summarized. A TEAE is an event with onset date on o r after the study drug start date.  
Adverse event summaries will exclude preferred terms that describe asymptomatic serum 
ferritin, TSAT, and reticulocyte values (or changes). This approach is justified by [CONTACT_541494] s and is consistent with the protocol -
defined reporting standards for Hgb/hematocrit (Hct) and low iron indices.  For the 
purposes of this study, non -serious anemia ( Hgb or Hct below the normal range or 
worsened from baseline) or iron deficiency (iron indi ces below the normal range or 
worsened from baseline) will not be considered adverse events.  Anemia or iron 
deficiency will be considered end points if an intervention is required.  
The adverse event profile will be characterized with severity (as graded by [CONTACT_6812] -
CTCAE) and relationship (unrelated and related) to study drug. Related adverse events 
will be events that are possibly or probably related to treatment in the investigator’ s 
judgment.  
Participants who report the same preferred term on multiple occasions will be counted 
once for the preferred term: under the highest severity when summarized by [CONTACT_541495]. If a 
participant reports multiple preferred terms for a SOC, the subject will be counted only 
once for that SOC.   
The number and percent of participants who report treatment -emergent serious adverse 
events will be similarly summarized for each tr eatment group. The number and percent of 
participants who report treatment -emergent adverse events resulting in discontinuation of 
study drug will be similarly summarized for each treatment group.

Adverse events (AEs) of special interest include hypersensitivity, hypersensitivity -like 
reactions, and cardiovascular events. Hypersensitivity and hypersensitivity -like reactions 
will be identified using standardized MedDRA queries. Cardiovascular events will be 
identified using  the SOCs for cardiac disorders and vascular disorders.  
The overviews and summaries that are provided for all TEAEs will also be provided for 
the AEs of special interest. In addition, the time to onset and time  to recovery will be 
summarized.  
8.5.4.  Clinical Labo ratory Findings  
Clinical  laboratory variables will be presented in two ways.  First, the mean change from 
baseline to each scheduled visit will be summarized. Second, the number and percent of 
participants with treatment -emergent potentially clinically significant  (PCS) laboratory 
values will be tabulated. Treatment -emergent PCS laboratory tests are those in which the 
baseline value is normal and post -baseline value is abnormal (i.e., meets Grade  III or 
Grade IV toxicity criteria from the NCI -CTC AE Versi on 5 or higher ).  Baseline will be 
defined as the last value obtained before receiving study drug . 
No formal statistical tests will be performed.   
8.5.5.  Vital Signs  
The change in vital signs (sitting heart rate and blood pressure) from pre -infusion to each 
post-infusion time point will be summarized descriptively on each dosing day.  
8.5.6.  Sample Size Rationale  
There were no sample size estimations for this study.  The current study is a rollover for

Study Drug:  Injectafer® (Ferric Carboxymaltose  [FCM] ) 
Objectives:   The primary objective of this study is to evaluate  the 
efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) ferric 
carboxymaltose (FCM) in pediatric participants who 
have iron deficiency anemia (IDA).  
Nature of Study:  Phase III  
Design : This is a single arm, open -label, multi -center, multi -national, 
non-randomized study that will evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of a one course treatment with FCM  in participants 
who had an unsa tisfactory response to oral iron in study 
1VIT17044 . 
Subjects will have an End of Study (EOS) Visit (Day 35) 
from the 1VIT17044  study to qualify for entry.  Subjects will 
then be screened, meet all inclusion criteria, no exclusion 
criteria  and have a baseline evaluation.  Based on the 
successful completion of the baseline evaluations, subjects 
will be enrolled and will receive the first dose of FCM (Day 
0). The second FCM dose will occur [ADDRESS_706226] dose, participants will return to the 
clinic for final safety and efficacy assessments.  Once all 
assessments are complete the participant will exit the study . 
An unsatisfactory response  to oral iron ( i.e., an increase in 
hemoglobin ( Hgb) of <1 g/dL from baseline) will be defined 
as non -responders to oral iron treatment.  Non -responders 
who continue to meet all inclusion criteria (including Hgb 
<11 g/dL) and no ne of the exclusion criteria will receive 1 
course of FCM.  
Inclusion Criteria:  1. Unsatisfactory response to oral iron or those that required 
a concomitant intervention, (defined as, blood 
transfusion, use of IV or oral iron outside of p rotocol, 
increase in erythropoietin for any reason [Day 0 thru Day

1.1. Treatment of Iron Deficiency Anemia  
Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) remains the most common nutritional deficiency in 
children in the [LOCATION_002] (US)  [Looker , 1997] . Rapid growth, insufficient dietary 
intake, and limited absorption of dietary iron combine to place children at increased risk 
for iron deficiency. Iron malabsorption, gastrointestinal blood loss, or iatrogenesis due to 
repeated blood sampling all represent common clinical mechanisms that can result in 
IDA.  Ev en when recognized, some children are unable to tolerate prescribed oral iron 
supplementation or are unresponsive to it  [Kulnigg , 2006] . Anemia may also decrease 
survival  rates in adults and children with chronic renal impairment where it is a 
commonly encountered problem  [Foley , 1996; Stapl es, 2010] . In addition, under -
recognized or inadequately treated anemia is likely the most common extra -intestinal 
manifestation of IBD in children, and it can result in a decrease in quality of life and 
increased morbidity,  inclusive of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], in affected patients  [Kulnigg , 2006] . 
Non-hematologic consequences of iron deficiency in children include poor weight gain, 
anorexia, irrit ability, decreased attention span, exercise intolerance, and decreased 
physical activity  [Wharton , 1999] . Existing data suggests that chronic IDA in infants and 
toddlers i s associated with long -term diminished mental, motor, and behavioral 
functioning.   Although the exact relationship between iron deficiency and its detrimental 
effects on growth and development is not well -understood, it appears that these effects do 
not oc cur until iron deficiency becomes severe and chronic enough to produce anemia  
[Kazal, 2002] . 
Options for correcting iron deficiency include both oral and parenteral formulations. As 
previously described, some children are unable to tolerate or are non -responsive to oral 
iron.  Bl ood transfusion is an option to treat anemia and replete iron stores, but often 
scarce supply, as well as the potential risk of blood -borne pathogens, limits its use to 
severely ill or clinically unstable patients  [Kulnigg , 2006] . In view of the limitations 
associated with oral iron administration or blood transfusions, IV iron administration is 
an important therapeutic option for use in patients with IDA  [Powers , 2014] . 
Multiple parenteral iron products are available. These products vary in the way that iron 
is complexed, which influences the total amount of iron that may be administered dur ing 
a single administration. Numerous other differences differentiate the products.  However, 
all appear to effectively release iron post administration and can restore iron deficit in the 
patient. Previous studies with parenteral iron sucrose (Venofer®) have been performed in 
the pediatric population  [Michaud , 2002; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_541476] , 2008; Surico , 2002] . Iron doses have 
varied in these studies, and the data demonstrates the efficacy and safety  of Venofer® in 
doses up to 7 mg iron/kg (or 200 mg) administered over 3 minutes, which was shown to 
be beneficial to both the child and health care facility  [Michaud , 2002]. 
Ferric Carboxymaltose  has been characterized as an iron complex (Type 1) with a 
molecular mass of about 150,000 Daltons. The solution is a dark brown color with a near

Page 13 of 37 neutral pH (5.0 to 7.0) and a physiological osmolarity permitting administration of  higher 
single doses in short time periods. Although no randomized interventional studies have 
been completed  with FCM in the pediatric population to date, the product has been used 
successfully to address iron deficiency in pediatric patients with ulcerat ive colitis and 
Crohn’s disease. A non -interventional, retrospective observational data collection 
reported FCM exposure in 79 patients aged 2 to 18 years with a mean age of 12.7 years.  
In these patients, FCM was found to be safe, well -tolerated, and effe ctive in increasing 
Hgb, ferritin, and TSAT  [Favreau , 2017] . 
The proposed study will provide safety and efficacy data on the use of FCM in pediatric 
patients (aged between 1 and 1 8 years) with IDA. FCM will be administered in 2 doses at 
15 mg/kg maximum single dose of 750 mg with a total maximum cumulative dose of 
1500 mg.   The ability to infuse higher doses of elemental iron should permit repletion in 
fewer overall infusions, and in doing so may ultimately permit fewer visits to the treating 
facilities.  
1.2. Ferric Carboxymaltose  
1.2.1.  Key features of Ferric Carboxymaltose  
Ferric Carboxymaltose injection is a stable, non -dextran, Type I polynuclear 
iron (III)-hydroxide carbohydrate complex developed as an IV iron replacement therapy 
for the treatment of IDA.  After IV administration, FCM is mainly found in the liver, 
spleen, and bone marrow.  The iron slowly dissociates from the complex and can be 
efficiently used in the bone marrow for Hgb synthesis.  The carbohydrate moiety of FCM 
is metabolized by [CONTACT_541501].   
1.2.2.  Ferric Carboxymaltose versus Other Parenteral Iron Agents  
There is considerable efficacy and safety data in the literature with respect to existing 
parenteral iron formulations  [Stapl es, 2010] . However, prior to the approval of non -
dextran formulations, the risk of systemic adverse reactions restricted their use. FCM 
offers significant advantages compared to other available IV iron preparations.  
Iron dext ran, the first parenteral iron product available in the US, has been associated 
with an incidence of anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions (i.e., dyspnea, wheezing, 
hypotension, urticaria, angioedema) as high as 1.7%  [Michaud , 2002] .  Over the last 
[ADDRESS_706232] been attributed to the use of IV iron dextran  [Fishbane , 2003] .  
The high incidence of anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions is believed to be caused by [CONTACT_541488].  Although some have suggested t hat high 
molecular weight iron dextran is associated with a higher rate of life threatening  adverse 
events and anaphylactic reactions in comparis on to low molecular weight  iron dextran, 
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was unable to find a clear difference after 
an examination of post -marketing data, clinical trial data, death certifica tes, and 
emergency room diagnoses  [Pi[INVESTIGATOR_541476] , 2008] .  Iron dextran is limited to second line therapy 
for treatment of iron deficiency.   
CONFIDENTIAL  
American Regent , Inc.  Protocol No.: 1VIT18045  
Final version: 1.[ADDRESS_706233] significant dosage and 
administration rate limitations.  If the body’s ability to sequester, st ore, and transport 
infused iron is overwhelmed, a reaction to excess free iron in circulation, referred to as a 
bioactive iron reaction, may occur.  Iron sucrose and iron gluconate preparations carry a 
significant risk of inducing a bioactive iron reaction  when delivered at higher doses. 
These reactions are characterized by [CONTACT_27913] (without allergic signs) accompanied by 
[CONTACT_416701], abdomen, flank and/or nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea  [Van Wyck , 
2004] .  
Due to its structure, FCM is more stable than iron gluconate and iron sucrose, and this 
results in a slower delivery of the complexed iron to endogenous iron binding sites.  
These char acteristics of FCM make it possible to administer much higher single doses 
over shorter periods of time than iron gluconate or iron sucrose, resulting in the need for 
fewer administrations to replete iron stores.   
2. TRIAL OBJECTIVE
2.1. Primary Objective
The pri mary objective of this study is to evaluate  the efficacy and safety of IV FCM in 
pediatric participants who have IDA.  
3.
3.1. OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE  
Overall Study Design
This is a single arm, open -label, multi -center, multi -national, non -randomize d study that 
will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a one course treatment with FCM in participants 
who had an unsatisfactory response to oral iron in study 1VIT17044 . 
Subjects will have an EOS Visit (Day 35) from the 1VIT17044  study to qualify for entry .  
Subjects will then be screened, meet all inclusion criteria, no exclusion criteria and have a 
baseline evaluation.  Based on the successful completion of the baseline evaluations, 
subjects will be enrolled and will receive the first dose of FCM (Day 0). The second 
FCM dose should occur [ADDRESS_706234] dose, participants will return to the clinic for fin al safety and efficacy 
assessments.  Once all assessments are complete the participant will exit the study.  
An unsatisfactory response  to oral iron ( i.e., an increase in Hgb of <1 g/dL from 
baseline ) will be defined as non -responders to oral iron treatment.  Non -responders who 
continue to meet all inclusion criteria (including Hgb <11 g/dL) and none of the 
exclusion criteria will receive 1 course of FCM.

Page 15 of 37 3.2. Rationale of Study Design  
The primary objective in this study is to allow participants who were randomized to 
receive oral iron in the 1VIT17044 trial and who had an unsatisfactory  response to oral 
iron or those that required a concomitant intervention, (defined as, blood transfusi on, use 
of IV or oral iron outside of protocol, increase in erythropoietin for any reason [Day 0 
thru Day 35 of study protocol 1VIT17044 ], change in IBD treatment) to receive one 
course of FCM.  This course of FCM will consist of two doses of FCM at 15 mg/ kg 
(maximum single dose of 750 mg), separated by [CONTACT_140496].  
This study is a rollover for study 1VIT17044 which is an open label, multi -center, multi -
national, randomized, active -control parallel group study that will evaluate  the efficacy 
and safety of FC M in pediatric participants, ages 1 to 18 years with iron deficiency 
anemia.

5. STUDY DRUG  
5.1. Formulation, Packaging and Storage  
The investigational medication to be used in this study [supplied by [CONTACT_541489] , 
Inc.] will have been prepared according to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).  
FCM (trade name, Injectafer®) will be supplied as 15 m L vials, containing 750 mg of iron 
as 5% w/v iron containing a polynuclear iron(III) -hydroxide 4(R) –(poly -(14)-O  -D-
glucopyranosyl) -oxy-2 (R), 3(S), 5(R), 6 -tetrahydroxy -hexonate complex in a solution of 
water for injection [50 mg/m L] and will be labeled according to FDA investigational 
regulatory requirements.   
FCM must be kept in a secure place at the investigational site, and stored at room 
temperature ( see [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia) .  The study medication should not be 
frozen.  Vial s of FCM may not be used for more than 1 dose, or for more than 1 
participant.  All FCM vials and syringes (used and unused) should be kept by [CONTACT_541490]. Following reconciliation, sites may destroy used 
and unused st udy drug on site using local procedures, provided a drug destruction policy 
is in place, or it may be returned to American Regent , Inc.  
5.2. Drug Administration/Regimen  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_541477]. All subjects will be dosed with FCM based on the Hgb, TSAT and ferritin 
values from the last scheduled visit in the 1VIT17044  study.   
Participants  will receive a dose of FCM at 15 mg/kg to a maximum single dose of 750 
mg (whichever is smaller ) on Days 0 and 7 for a maximum total dose of 1500 mg. FCM

Page 19 of 37 will be administered as either an undiluted IV push at a rate of 100 mgs (2  mL)/minute 
OR in no more than 250 mL of normal saline and infused over 15 minutes.  
5.3. IV Medication Precautions  
When adminis tering FCM, the following precautions will be taken:  
 The participant will be evaluated clinically prior to drug administration to assess the 
development of clinically -significant conditions.   
 The vials will be visually inspected for particulate matter and  discoloration before 
use.  If noted, the vial will not be used, and the Investigator or his designee will 
notify the sponsor or sponsor’s designee for replacement of the study drug, and for 
direction on the return of the unused vial.  
 Heart rate and blood pressure will be assessed pre -, immediately post  (within 5 
minutes) , and [ADDRESS_706239] administration.  Participants will be discharged from 
the site by [CONTACT_541491] 30 minutes  after the administration is completed.  
 The participant will be monitored for at least 30 minutes for serious acute reactions 
as hypersensitivity or bioactive (labile) iron reactions to non -dextran IV iron 
products have rarely been reported. The reactions include: hypotension, loss of 
consciousness, bronchospasm with dyspnea, shortness of breath, and seizures.  
 In the event a serious acute reaction is seen, the site must have the capability to 
provide appropriate resuscitation measures. These may include IV normal 
saline , IV epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], steroids, and/or antihistamines.  
5.4. Drug Accountability  
Investigators will keep records of the receipt, administration and return of the study drug 
(FCM).  They will not allow the study drug to be used for purposes other than as  directed 
by [CONTACT_3181].  The investigator agrees that he/she will not supply study medication to 
any persons other than those enrolled in the study, or to investigators not listed on the 
FDA 1572. When the study is completed, or if it is prematurely te rminated, a final 
inventory of all clinical supplies must be compi[INVESTIGATOR_541486] , Inc., or destroyed on site, per the site’s 
documented locally accepted policies. All data regarding the st udy drug must be recorded 
as per the Monitoring Plan.

7. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
7.1. Adverse Events  
Any untoward medical  event experienced by a participant during the course of this 
clinical trial, whether or not it is related to the investigational product, at any dose, is 
considered an adverse event (AE).  
For any laboratory abnormality, the investigator will make a judgm ent as to its clinical 
significance. If the laboratory value is outside the normal limits and is felt to represent a 
clinically significant worsening from the baseline value, it should be considered an 
adverse event and should be recorded on the Adverse Ev ents page of the electronic case 
report form ( eCRF ). If the laboratory value is outside the normal range, but not an 
adverse event, the investigator should comment on the findings (i.e., “not clinically 
significant” or “unchanged from baseline”) in the sou rce documentation [laboratory 
CONFIDENTIAL  
American Regent , Inc.   Protocol No.: 1VIT18045  
  Final version: 1.0 26 April  2019  
 
Page 24 of 37 report]. All laboratory values at the EOS /Day [ADDRESS_706243] been deemed clinical 
significant by [CONTACT_541493].  
To quantify the severity of adverse events, the National  Cancer Institute (NCI) -Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version [ADDRESS_706244], the investigator should  use Table 2 to assign 
the adverse event grade.  
Table 2 Grading of Adverse Event Severity  
Grade  Adjective  Description  
1 Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention 
indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities 
of daily living (i.e., preparing meals, shoppi [INVESTIGATOR_16208], using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.)  
3 Severe  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -
threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24599]; disabling; limiting self -care 
activities of daily living (i.e., bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the to ilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden.)  
4 Life-threatening  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated.  
5 Death  Results in death due to the AE  
 
Timing:  Non-serious AE will be reported from the initial treatment with FCM  through 
the completion of the study Day 35. Adverse events will be captured [ADDRESS_706245] 
dose of study drug for participants who receive study drug and terminate early from the 
trial. This can be completed via a phone call. All ongoing AE’s relate d to FCM  should be 
followed until they are no longer related, have taken a confounding medication or return 
to baseline grade . 
Relationship (Causality) : The Investigator will be asked to document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_541479]*  as follows:  
 NONE  There is no evidence of any causal relationship  
 UNLIKELY  There is little evidence to suggest there is a causal 
relationship. There is another reasonable explanation  for the 
CONFIDENTIAL  
American Regent , Inc.   Protocol No.: 1VIT18045  
  Final version: 1.0 26 April  2019  
 
Page 25 of 37 event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant treatments).  
 POSSIBLE  There is some  evidence to suggest a causal relationship (i.e. 
there is a reasonable  possibility that the adverse experience 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_416714]). However, the influence 
of other factors may have contributed  to the event (e.g., the 
participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events).  
 PROBABLE  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely  
*For the purpose of this trial, study drug is defined as FCM.  
7.2. Reporting of Adverse Events  
Adverse experiences will be elicited by [CONTACT_416715] “Have you noticed 
any problems?”  Participants will be encouraged to report adverse events at their onset.   
Any adverse experience spontaneously reported by , elicited from the participant, or 
observed by [CONTACT_5983], shall be recorded on the appropriate Adverse 
Event page of the eCRF. The investigator will record the date and time of onset, severity, 
the relationship to study medication, the date and time of resolution (or the fact that the 
event is still continuing), the action taken, and the outcome of the adverse experience on 
the Adverse Event page of the eCRF. Whenever possible, the investigator should group 
together, into a single term, signs and symptoms which constitute a single diagnosis. For 
example, cough, rhinitis and sneezing might be grouped together as "upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_42977]."  
7.3. Serious Adverse Events  
Definition : An adverse event is classified as SERIOUS if it meets any one of the 
following criteria:  
 Death  
 Life-Threatening:  The participant was at substantial risk of dying at the time of the 
adverse event or it is suspected that the use or continued use of the pr oduct would 
result in the participant's death.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged):  Required admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541480] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  
 Disability: Resulted in a significant, persistent, or permanent change, impairment, 
damage or disr uption in the participant’s body function/structure, physical activities 
or quality of life.  
 Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect .

  Final version: 1.0 26 April  2019  
 
Page 26 of 37  Important medical events:  Other medically important events that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13046], may jeopardize the participan t or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
A distinction should be drawn between SAE and severe AE.  A SAE is a major 
experience of its type.  A SAE is not necessarily serious: e.g. nausea, which persists for 
several h ours, may be considered severe nausea, but it is not an SAE.  On the other hand 
a stroke, which results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild 
stroke, but would be a SAE.  
Timing:  All SAEs will be reported from the day of initial tr eatment with * study drug  
through the completion of the study Day 35.  Serious adverse events will be captured [ADDRESS_706246] dose of study drug for participants who terminate early from the trial. 
This can be completed via a phone call. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541487] a historical 
condition (present prior to initial treatment with study drug or prescheduled prior to 
treatment with study drug) that has not increased in severity or led to prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541482] a SAE. All  reported SAE should be followed until 
they are no longer serious or return to baseline grade.   
Reporting:  Any SAE, starting with the first dose of study drug, that is to be reported (as 
outlined in Timing section above) must be reported immediately ( with in 24 hours of 
learning of the event ) to American Regent , Inc. by [CONTACT_756], email and/or fax of the 
written SAE report form to the contacts listed below:

Phone: (800) 734 -9236  
Fax: (610) 650 -0170  
Email: pv@americanrege nt.com  
The local investigator is responsible for reporting SAEs to their local Institutional Review 
Board  (IRB) / Ethics Committee based on local reporting guidelines (which may be 
different than those specified in this protocol). The responsible investigat or should 
institute appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures and keep the participant under 
observation for as long as is medically indicated.  
8. STATISTICS  
Continuous variables will be summarized in terms of the number of observations, mean, 
standard deviation  (SD) , median, Q1, Q3, minimum and maximum. Other descriptive 
statistics (e.g., coefficient of variation) may be reported when appropriate. Categorical 
variables will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages.   
Generally, data will be summarized by [CONTACT_474306].  However, data from both 
unscheduled and scheduled will be used for determination of last observed value, and in 
worst - or best -case changes and/or shifts from baseline. Assessment windows will not be

assessment times.  
A complete description of the statistical analyses and methods will be available in a 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized before the database is locked.  
8.1. Stratificat ion/Randomization  
This is a  non-randomized, single arm study.  
8.2. Analysis Populations  
Safety Population  
The safety population will consist of all participants who received at least one dose of 
study drug.   
8.3. Disposition and Baseline Characteristics  
The number of participants in each investigative site will be summarized.  The number of 
participants who are screened, treated, prematurely discontinue, and complete the study 
will be summarized.    
The clinical team will identify deviations and the devia tions will be identified in the 
database.  Participants with clinically important protocol deviations will be summarized.  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
or frequency counts.  
8.4. Endpoints and Definitio ns 
8.4.1.  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the change in Hgb from baseline to day 35.  Descriptive statistics 
will be provided for the baseline Hgb, the day 35 Hgb, and the within -participant change 
from baseline.  The change in Hgb from baseline to day 3 5 will be analyzed using paired 
t-tests.  
8.4.2.  Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include:  
 Change in ferritin from baseline to Day 35  
 Change in TSAT from baseline to Day 35  
 Changes from baseline in Hgb, ferritin, TSAT, and CHr throughout the study  
Details of analyses for these endpoint s will be outlined in the SAP.

Page 28 of 37 8.4.3.  Missing Data  
A participant who withdraws from the study for any reason will be included in the 
analyses regardless of time on study. Methods for handling withdrawals and missing data 
will be specific to each endpoint to be analyzed. Missing data will not be imputed for 
descriptive statistical summaries in safety or efficacy. Details will be provided in the 
SAP.  
8.5. Analyses of Safety  
8.5.1.  Study Drug Exposure  
The number of infusions and total admin istered amount of iron will be summarized 
descriptively.  
8.5.2.  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) using 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary.  
The number and percent of participants who report treatment emergent AE ( TEAE ) will 
be summarized. A TEAE is an event with onset date on or after the study drug start date.  
Adverse event summaries will exclude preferred terms that describe asymptomatic serum 
ferritin, TSAT, and re ticulocyte values (or changes). This approach is justified by [CONTACT_541502] -
defined reporting standards for Hgb/hematocrit (Hct) and low iron indices.  For the 
purposes of this study , non -serious anemia ( Hgb or Hct below the normal range or 
worsened from baseline) or iron deficiency (iron indices below the normal range or 
worsened from baseline) will not be considered adverse events.  Anemia or iron 
deficiency will be considered end points if an intervention is requ ired. 
The adverse event profile will be characterized with severity (as graded by [CONTACT_6812] -
CTCAE) and relationship (unrelated and related) to study drug. Related adverse events 
will be events that are possibly or probably related to treatment in the investigator’s 
judgment.  
Participants who report the same preferred term on multiple occasions will be counted 
once for the preferred term: under the highest severity when summarized by [CONTACT_541503]. If a 
participant reports multiple preferred terms for a SOC, the subject w ill be counted only 
once for that SOC.   
The number and percent of participants who report treatment -emergent serious adverse 
events will be similarly summarized for each treatment group. The number and percent of 
participants who report treatment -emergent  adverse events resulting in discontinuation of 
study drug will be similarly summarized for each treatment group.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
American Regent , Inc.   Protocol No.: 1VIT18045  
  Final version: 1.[ADDRESS_706247]  
Adverse events (AEs) of special interest include hypersensitivity, hypersensitivity -like 
reactions, and car diovascular events. Hypersensitivity and hypersensitivity -like reactions 
will be identified using standardized MedDRA queries. Cardiovascular events will be 
identified using the SOCs for cardiac disorders and vascular disorders.  
The overviews and summaries  that are provided for all TEAEs will also be provided for 
the AEs of special interest. In addition, the time to onset and time  to recovery will be 
summarized.  
8.5.4.  Clinical Laboratory Findings  
Clinical  laboratory variables will be presented in two ways.  First , the mean change from 
baseline to each scheduled visit will be summarized. Second, the number and percent of 
participants with treatment -emergent potentially clinically significant  (PCS) laboratory 
values will be tabulated. Treatment -emergent PCS laborato ry tests are those in which the 
baseline value is normal and post -baseline value is abnormal (i.e., meets Grade  III or 
Grade IV toxicity criteria from the NCI -CTC AE Version 5 or higher ).  Baseline will be 
defined as the last value obtained before receiving  study drug . 
No formal statistical tests will be performed.   
8.5.5.  Vital Signs  
The change in vital signs (sitting heart rate and blood pressure) from pre -infusion to each 
post-infusion time point will be summarized descriptively on each dosing day.  
8.5.6.  Sample Size Rationale  
There were no sample size estimations for this study.  The current study is a rollover for 
study 1VIT17044. There will be a  maximum of approximately [ADDRESS_706248] make study data a ccessible to the monitor, Sponsors, or other

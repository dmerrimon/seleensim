VA Protocol -  Quit Smoking Telehealth [ZIP_CODE], v9, 2018- 02-[ADDRESS_1266852] cause of preventable deaths in t he U S;1 and 
military service is a risk factor for smoking.2,3 In VA, patients with chronic medical illnesses 
represent an important and prevalent population on which to focus smoking cessation efforts .4 
Smoking cessation among patients with chronic medical illnesses substantially decreases 
morbidity and mortality;5-7 yet, many patients with these illness continue to smoke.6 There is a 
strong interrelationship between depression and chronic medical illness.8,9 Depression can 
derail smoking cessation. Smokers with histories of depression are more likely to relapse after a 
quit attempt; have higher nicotine dependence; suffer negative mood symptoms from withdrawal; are less likely to sustain quit attempts and suffer greater s moking- related morbidity 
and mortality than the general smoker population.
10-[ADDRESS_1266853] the potency 
needed to cause significant cessation rates in depressed smokers.  
In the study proposed here, we intend to combine the potency  of co- delivered mood 
management  and the reach of proactive telephone- delivered interventions by [CONTACT_903209] -management for smoking cessation among smokers with 
current depression and chronic medical illness. Proposed is a randomized comparative 
effectiveness trial with a two -group design in which 350 Veteran smokers with depression and 
chronic medical illness will be randomized to either: 1) smoking cessation plus adjunctive behavioral  mood management  (SMK -MM group), an intervention that includes a proactive 
tele-health intervention that combines evidence -based smoking cessation counseling 
augmented with behavioral mood management and a tele- medicine clinic for accessing nicotine 
replacement therapy (NRT), or  2) smoking cessation telephone counseling control  (SMK   
CONTROL), a contact -equivalent control that provides the same smoking cessation telephone 
counseling intervention augmented with health education (instead of mood management) and a 
tele-medicine clinic for accessing NRT.  
VA Protocol -  Quit Smoking Telehealth [ZIP_CODE], v9, 2018- 02-[ADDRESS_1266854] to a state- of-the-science smoking cessation program 
(SMK -MM) to a contact -equivalent smoking cessation and health education control (SMK 
Control) for effects on sustained abstinence from smoking among depressed Veterans with 
chronic disease. Veterans with current tobacco use and chronic disease will be identified from 
patient records at Durham VA  Health Care System (Durham VAHCS) . Veterans will be sent an 
introductory letter signed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_903177]. Veterans who do not decline may be called and asked if they currently smoke and 
if they are willing  to quit smoking in the next 30 days. They wil l also be screened for depression. 
Eligible patients will be randomized to one of two arms: SMK Control (N=175)  or SMK -MM 
intervention (N=175 ). Participating patients will be surveyed at [ADDRESS_1266855] -
randomization. The primary outcome is self -reported prolonged abstinence at the 6 -month 
follow- up (Figure 1). 
 
Accordingly, the specific aims of the study are: 
1. To evaluate the impact of adjunctive mood management intervention on cigarette 
abstinence rates among Veterans at the 6-  and 12- month follow -ups. 
2. To evaluate the impact of adjunctive mood management on depressive symptoms 
among Veterans at the [ADDRESS_1266856] -effectiveness of the adjunctive mood management 
intervention.  
 Selection of Subjects  
Study Setting   
Durham VAHCS  will be the recruitment site from which patients will be identified. In FY 
2010, 53,661 unique Veterans received care at Durham  VAMC. About 30% of these patients 
(approximately 16,100 Veterans) currently smoke cigarettes. Conservatively, 40% of these smokers have a history of significant depressive symptoms, yielding approximately 6,[ADDRESS_1266857] meet all of the followin g inclusion criteria:  
1. Enrolled in the Durham  VAHCS  and associated Community Based  Outpatient Clinics 
(CBOCs) for ongoing care 
2. Current tobacco smokers willing to quit smoking in the next 30 days  
3. Having received a diagnosis of a qualifying chronic illness (i.e., cancer, cardiovascular 
disease, hypertension, diabetes, COPD)  
Figure 1. Study Flow  
VA Protocol -  Quit Smoking Telehealth [ZIP_CODE], v9, 2018- 02-[ADDRESS_1266858] significant burden of depressive symptoms (i.e., meets DSM threshold for > 3 of 
the nine MDD criterion symptoms at the threshold of “more than half the days” (one 
symptom mus t be depressed mood or anhedonia; endorsing “some days” meets criteria 
for self -harm) and endorse functional impairment  OR receive a summary score 10 or 
above on PHQ -9. 63,64 
Patients who meet any one of the following exclusion criteria will be excluded:  
1. Active diagnosis of psychosis or dementia or other memory loss condition in their medical records  
2. Severely impaired hearing or speech  
3. Lack of telephone access  
4. Enrollment in another research study that might affect the main outcomes of this study  
5. Terminal illness  
6. Behavioral flags  
7. Active suicidal ideation flags  
8. Endorses self -harm and greater than minimal risk of suicide 
 
Subject Recruitment  
 Patients clinically diagnosed with chronic medical illnesses and receiving care in  the 
Durham VA HCS  will be identified from CPRS using a data pull for the following health 
conditions  using currently available identification codes : 
 
Cardiovascular Disease;  e.g. 
Ischemic Heart Disease , Coronary Artery Disease , Peripheral Artery Disease, Carotid Artery 
Disease , Myocardial Infarction, Aortic Valve Disease , Atrial Fibrillation , Congestive Heart 
Failure, Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, or Stroke (includes Transient Ischemic Attack, 
Cardiovascular Accident, Cerebrovascular Accident) . 
 
Cancer ; e.g  
Malignant neoplasm of lip, oral cavity, and pharynx , Malignant neoplasm of digestive organs 
and peritoneum , Malignant neoplasm of respi[INVESTIGATOR_326445] , Malignant 
neoplasm of bone, connective tissue, skin,  and breast , Malignant neoplasm of genitourinary 
organs , Malignant neoplasm of other and unspecified sites , or Malignant neoplasm of lymphatic 
and hematopoietic tissue . 
 Diabetes Mellitus  
 COPD;  e.g. 
COPD with acute exacerbation, Chronic airway obstruction, not elsewhere classified, asthma , 
bronchiectasis , bronchitis/with emphysema/decompensated , emphysema , or  
Chronic obstructive asthma.  
 Hypertension ; e.g. 
Essential Hypertension, or Secondary Hypertension.  
    Patients meeting the criteria will be identified to the study team . Medical records for 
these patient s will be reviewed; an abstraction form will be completed ( See Appendix 1) . At the 
time of abstraction, patients will be deemed potentially eligible or ineligible based on disease 
VA Protocol -  Quit Smoking Telehealth [ZIP_CODE], v9, 2018- 02-[ADDRESS_1266859] ete a telephone survey unless they call a t oll-free number to refuse 
participation (See Appendix 2) . Approximately five business days after the mailing, p atient s who 
have not called the toll -free number to decline participation may  be called by a research 
assistant (RA) or other trained study team member to request their participation in the research 
study  and screen for eligibility . When leaving voice mail or answering machine messages for 
patients, the team member will be discrete and maintain the patient’s privacy by [CONTACT_903210]/she is calling from the Durham VA HCS . No information regarding the patient’s health 
condition or smoking status may be included in the message. For patients who are currently 
abstaining from smoking or aren’t ready to quit, we will ask the patient’s permission to re- contact 
[CONTACT_903211].  The study team member  will ob tain informed 
consent  (Appendix 3)  as noted in the Consent Process section below . Once subjects are 
consented, the baseline survey (Appendix 4 ) will be completed over the telephone. Once 
patients have been screened, consented, enrolled, and have completed the baseline survey 
assessment, the call will be either be transferred to or a message left for, depending on 
immediate availability, a non- blinded staff member  to notify the patient  of which of the 2 
treatment groups they are randomized : SMK Control (N=175)  or SMK -MM i ntervention (N=175) . 
The project’s statistical team will perform the entire study randomization before patient 
enrollment begins. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_903212] -9 scoring, (≥5 criterion symptoms, consistent with MDD, vs < 5 criterion 
symptoms, consistent with subsyndromal or persistent depressive disorder) and a blocked 
randomization technique will be used to ensure balance between groups.    
 
In addition to direct -recruiting as detailed above, we may employ self -referral or provider 
referral.  Self -referral would involve placing posters  and brochures in clinic waiting rooms and 
other common areas, as well as on the closed- circuit television. VA  clinicians may also give 
these brochures to patients who may be interested in the study. To facilitate provider  referral, 
we may meet with primary care providers to inform them about the study and give study 
information by  [CONTACT_903213]. We may set up a consult for referring patients to the 
study within the electronic medical  record.   
    
 Consent Process  
The trained study team member  will obtain informed consent to participate after 
describing the aspects of the study. Potential participants  will be told that their participation is 
voluntary, and they may choose not to answer any questions that they find too sensitive. 
Participants will not sign an informed consent form; rather, this study will operate under a 
Waiver of Documentat ion of Informed Consent. As part of the consent process, participants will 
provide consent for use of voice recordings so that counseling calls may be monitored for 
intervention fidelity .  Participants may refuse permission to record and still participate in the 
study.  
 Study Intervention  
 Patients will receive the following intervention components:  
1. Introductory letter:  A letter from [CONTACT_903243] to introduce the study and make an appeal to 
the patient to quit smoking.   
 
2. Combination Nicotine replacement  Therapy (NRT) : [LOCATION_002] Public Health Services 
Update of Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Clinical Treatment of Tobacco Use and 
VA Protocol -  Quit Smoking Telehealth [ZIP_CODE], v9, 2018- 02-12 Page 8 of 25 Dependence (USPHS CPG) recommends the utilization of a combination of a long 
acting nicotine formulation (pa tch) and a short acting nicotine formulation (gum  or 
lozenge, ).[ADDRESS_1266860]  telephone counseling session, c ounselors will discuss the types 
of NRT available and the side effects of each type of NRT with patients.  NRT may be 
discussed in earlier counseling calls if initiated by [CONTACT_2299].  Counselors will tailor 
amount and delivery type of NRT based on nu mber of cigarettes smoked per day (using 
an established protocol22). The counselor  will enter a  research note and the NRT 
prescription  in the patient’s electronic medical record.  This note will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_584765] , [CONTACT_903244],  and the NRT will be provided, as appropriate,  by [CONTACT_903214].  In the rare case of a contraindication, the study pharmacist  
will review the patient’s medical record, formulate a plan for NRT distribution, and send a CPRS note to the patient’s  primary care provider that details the plan.  The primary care 
provider will then have the opportunity to discuss the plan with the study pharmacist  
(See Appendix 5 ).  The patient ’s usual VA prescription co- payments will apply to NRT.   
The subject may dec line NRT.  
 
3. Telephone counseling (described below)  
 
Telephone Counseling  
Both groups will receive up to10 sessions of telephone counseling and a participant 
manual.   Counseling session will be completed over about 5 months on an approximately twice 
a month schedule tailored to the individual p atient ’s needs.  All counseling contact [CONTACT_903215] [ADDRESS_1266861] timed out of their intervention window. The 
counseling content of each group is described in the following paragraphs and delineated in 
Appendix 6.  
 Smoking cessation counseling  (Both Groups) :  
Both groups will receive smoking cessa tion telephone counseling and smoking cessation 
content will be delivered at parallel times. The counseling intervention  is based on standard 
techniques that have been shown to be efficacious for smoking cessation, and  is informed by [CONTACT_363799],
2 Social Cognitive Theory,23 and Motivational Interviewing.24  The 
counseling intervention and participant workbook were adapted from our previous successful 
telephone counseling intervention that targeted chronically ill Veterans (IIR -05-202).25 The 
treatment protocol is consi stent with the Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guide26 and was 
tailored to the Veteran population based on principles of evidence and consensus -based clinical 
practices, and our own experience conducting telephone counseling.  
Mood management enhancement  (Moo d Management Group) :  
In the SMK -MM enhanced arm, behavioral mood management will be integrated into the 
evidence- based smoking cessation counseling. We successfully used this integrated approach 
in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]; this approach has been used in other smoking studies with depression- history -
positive patients.27,28 The mood -management sessions are informed by [CONTACT_903216] ( CBT) and emphasize psycho -educational and skills -based approaches to CBT. CBT 
has been used extensively to address mood management.  The behavioral mood management 
approach we tested in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_903178] “Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression in Veterans and Military Servicemembers”,
[ADDRESS_1266862] manual developed by [CONTACT_41309], and a 
self-help guide to controlling depression, which has been evaluated in other depression 
studies.30 Specifically, SMK -MM enhancement includes behavioral activation, cognitive 
VA Protocol -  Quit Smoking Telehealth [ZIP_CODE], v9, 2018- 02-12 Page 9 of 25 restructuring (working with automatic thoughts, problem solving, and behavioral skills (i.e., 
activity scheduling, relaxation training/controlled breathing). The SMK -MM-enhanced participant 
manual will also include additional worksheets developed for our pi[INVESTIGATOR_903179]’s self-help guide to controlling depression.
[ADDRESS_1266863] 3 participants assigned to the counselor, and then up to 5 
randomly selected sessions per month for the remaining intervention delivery period to provide 
ongoing training and supervision. They will monitor protocol adherence using checklists of key 
counseling components.  
 
 Health education control condition (Healthy Lifestyles group) :  
In the contact -equivalent health education condition, participants will receive parallel 
smoking cessation content on the same schedule as in the MM -enhanced arm; however, health 
education content will supplant the MM content. The educational content will be based on the 
VA National Center on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention’s “Health Living Messages” on 
such topi[INVESTIGATOR_903180], eating wisely, getting recommended immunization and screening 
tests, and being involved with your health care. Participants also will receive chronic -disease-
specific  self-management information.  
 
Study Instruments  
1. Chart Abstraction:  Using an automated data pull of computerized patient medical 
records, we will collect d emographic and contact [CONTACT_3031] (name, date of birth, full social 
security number, mailing address , and telephone numbers).  The data pull will filter for subjects 
who meet inclusion criteria based on provided ICD -[ADDRESS_1266864] documents an active 
diagnosis of psychosis , dementia or other memory loss condition, a  hearing and/or speech 
impediment that would preclude patients from using a telephone, enrollment in another research 
study that might affe ct the outcomes of this study, terminal illness, behavioral flags, or active 
suicidal ideation flags . 
2.  Eligibility  Screening:   Patient’s will be screened for current smoking, willingness to quit in 30 
days, and depression.  Depression will be measured using the 9 -item PHQ.31  Patients who 
score as having major depression will be enc ouraged to speak with their doctor or a counselor 
and will be provided with Durham VAHCS  mental health resources.  For patients who express 
an endorsement of suicidal ideation (endorsement of question #9 on the PHQ -9) and score 
more than minimal risk on the P419 or who show clinical warning signs of elevated risk of self -
harm (e.g. , expression of intent to harm self, severe depression, significantly agitated, 
disordered thought, perceived burdensomeness on others) the  RA will engage the Safety 
VA Protocol -  Quit Smoking Telehealth [ZIP_CODE], v9, 2018- 02-12 Page 10 of 25 Protocol . (See Appendix 7 for details.)  Those qualifying and interested will be consented via 
telephone.   
3.  Baseline Survey:  Patients who consent to participate will complete the baseline survey that 
assesses demographics, smoking history  and current smoking including e- cigarettes , use of 
other tobacco or nic otine -based products, nicotine dependence, self -efficacy to quit smoking, 
contraindication for NRT, health care provider advice for quitting, attitudes lung cancer 
screening, pain, and depression severity . Participants will be asked to respond to three  
questions  (four for women under the age of 50 years)  to determine if they are contraindicated to 
receive NRT ( i.e. high blood pressure not controlled by [CONTACT_12617], chest pain, and wear 
dentures or have jaw pr oblems ).  For women under the age of [ADDRESS_1266865] 
receive physician approval prior to receiving NRT ( as detailed on the Study Intervention 
section) .  
4.  Six (6) and 12 Month Surveys:  Two follow- up survey s will be administered  by [CONTACT_32216] a 
study team member blinded to randomization.  One survey will be administered  approximately 6 
months after enrolling. There will be another follow up survey about 12 months after enrolling. 
The follow- up survey s will include assessments similar to those used in the baseline and will 
also include measures assessing smoking status, use of intervention materials (e.g., NRT, worksheets), and, at the 6- month follow -up, intervention acceptability (e.g., intervention 
appropriateness, suitability, eff ectiveness, and convenience).    
 Should the participant be unavailable to complete the full set of follow -up questions, we 
will offer an abbreviated survey version including only questions relating to our primary and 
secondary outcomes as well as cigarettes smoked per day for a reduced incentive payment.  
This abbreviated version is comprised of approximately [ADDRESS_1266866] not been able 
to reach these participants by [CONTACT_648], we antic ipate being unlikely to reach non- responsive 
subjects for appropriate follow -up should they indicate thoughts of self -harm.  We will include 
the phone number for the Veteran’s Crisis Line on the letter accompanying the abbreviated 
survey.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_903181] 4 weeks, we will continue attempts to reach 
participants by [CONTACT_903217]- up questions.  Should the participant return or complete the abbreviated survey, we wil l 
enter the responses into the survey software and label the remaining questions as “missing” data handling as such.  Should we either successfully reach a participant who mailed in an 
abbreviated survey or a participant changes their mind about wishing to complete the full set of 
questions within the window of opportunity, we will complete the full questionnaire with them by 
[CONTACT_648].  In this case, we will set aside the previously submitted abbreviated survey responses 
for that time point and distribute the full incentive payment.     
Surveys for this protocol are administered  by [CONTACT_903218], NC 
HSR&D survey tool “Illume” . Running on top of Microsoft IIS, Illume is a commercial web 
application configured to use https addresses . The application uses a Microsoft SQL server 
database to store both survey questions, and the answers provided to them . The servers are 
operated under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_903182]&T personnel, who patch, back up, monitor, and update 
VA Protocol -  Quit Smoking Telehealth [ZIP_CODE], v9, 2018- 02-12 Page 11 of 25 the servers, their supporting operat ing system instances, and their virtual machine instances, in 
accordance with established VA research policies and OI&T practices, including having the 
physical servers in a secured server room with restricted access, a UPS infrastructure, and 
adequate cooling . HSR&D has a software maintenance contract for Illume to ensure access to 
patches/fixes from the providing corporation, DatStat . The “Illume” application has been 
evaluated by [CONTACT_69304]6, whose personnel have run an “AppScan” on the application, and approv ed 
its use at HSR&D.   Mail- in follow- up surveys will be entered into the survey tool as soon as 
possible by [CONTACT_17251].  
 
Measures  
Medical data, including diagnosis, will be collected from the patient’s medical record.   
Outcome measures   
Primary outcome   
Prolonged abstinence : In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_903183], we use prolonged abstinence  as our main 
outcome and allow for a grace period around quit date. During the 6 - and 12 -month follow -ups, 
patients will be asked about prolonged abstinence,  “Since [ date of randomization plus 90 days ] 
have you ever smoked at least a part of a cigarette on each of 7 consecutive days , that is 7 
days in a row ?” and “ Since [ date of randomization plus 90 days ] have you smoked any in eac h 
of 2 consecutive  week, that is 2 week in a row ?”32     
 
We also will assess prolonged abstinence via another established single- item measure to 
assess if a more simplified manner of assessing prolonged smoking abstinence yields similar 
resutls.66   This item is , “Have you smoked at all since ( date of randomization plus 90 days )?” 
with responses of: a. No, not at all ; b. 1 -5 cigarette; or c. More than 5 cigarettes .  Answering “ a” 
or “b” would categorize a respondent as achieving prolonged abstinence.   
 
  
Secondary outcomes  
Point prevalent abstinence:  At each follow -up (6- and 12- month), patients will be asked whether 
they have smoked a cigarette, even a puff, in the past [ADDRESS_1266867] 7 days to 
biochemically validate self -report smoking status. Samples will be collected by [CONTACT_359925] a 2 -
week window following the telephone interview.33 Participants are sent instructions, saliva vials, 
a brief tobacco use assessment (that includes the use of nicotine replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_903184]), and a postage- paid, padded envelope for returning the sample to the Durham VA  
Medical Center  project coordinator so that receipt of samples can be tracked for participant 
payments. Participants self -reporting non -smoking who mailed in a follow -up survey will have 
the saliva sample kit express mailed to them in an attempt to reduce the turnaround time 
between self -report and sample collection.  A reminder call will be made by [CONTACT_903219] a sample kit inquiring about kit receipt, inviting questions, reinforcing return by [CONTACT_867901], reminding about including the compl eted questionnaire and 
the incentive payment upon receipt.  Samples will be stored in a secure VA research freezer at 
the medical  center. Next, samples will be sent to an independent laboratory for analysis.  Saliva 
samples will be analyzed for the presenc e of cotinine using a standard cut point of 16 ng/ml to 
determine abstinence. This method of analysis has been used in many of our prior smoking 
VA Protocol -  Quit Smoking Telehealth [ZIP_CODE], v9, 2018- 02-12 Page 12 of 25 cessation studies and yields response rates that are comparable to in- person collection 
methods (i.e., 70%).81   A blind sample of 5% will be run again to assure test accuracy of saliva 
samples. Tubes will be re -labeled prior to shipment with a unique barcode , not the participant’s 
study ID. Following sample analysis, the independent laboratory will be responsible for 
destroying the samples.  The project coordinator will maintain the crosswalk between the two 
codes. Coded samples will be sent by [CONTACT_903220][INVESTIGATOR_903185], 
SRS SOP 202.   Results of the saliva samples will be returned to study staff via a  password 
protected Excel spreadsheet attached to an encrypted email sent from the laboratory to the 
study coordinator .    
Participants will receive $ 20 incentive for returning the saliva sample.  
 
PHQ -9 Patient Depression Questionnaire:  
Patients will be asked the frequency with which they experienced symptoms indicative of 
depression in the past two weeks. This measure can be used to assess DSM criterion 
symptoms for MDD, assess depression severity, and assess suicidal ideations.31 The PHQ -9 
performs similarly across sociodemographic groups (i.e., age, race, sex) and mode of 
administration (e.g., patient self -report).34  For participants responding using the abbreviated 
mail- in follow- up survey, they will be administered the PHQ -8.    
Background Measures  
(See Appendix 4  for all assessment survey  items  and Table 1 for timing of measures.)  
Demographics:  Age, race, gender, education, marital status,  finance,  and employment status 
will be assessed.  
Smoking history/Current  smoking: Patients will be asked number of cigarettes currently smoked  
per day on average , number of serious quit attempts (quitting for at least 24 hours) in the last six 
months and use of e- cigarettes . 
Use of Other Tobacco & Nicotine Products : We will also ask if and how often they use the 
following tobacco or nicotine products: smokeless tobacco (e .g., snuff, dip), cigars, regular pi[INVESTIGATOR_5836], 
and electronic  cigarettes.  
Nicotine d ependence: We will use the [ADDRESS_1266868] for Nicotine Dependence.35   
Health Care Provider Advice for Quitting :  Patients will be asked if they’ve seen a health care 
provider in the past 12 months.  If yes, they will be asked if they were advised to quitting 
smoking.  
Perceived Stress and Copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  The Rhode Island Stress and Copi[INVESTIGATOR_903186] (RISCI) is a 12 -item 
measure with two subscales: perceived stress and perceived copi[INVESTIGATOR_007].36 The RISCI measures 
general stress and copi[INVESTIGATOR_903187]- specific responses, and has been 
widely used in smoking cessation studies. A sample stress item reads “I felt there was not 
enough time to complete my daily tasks” and a sampl e copi[INVESTIGATOR_903188] “I successfully solved 
problems that came up” (1=never to 5= most of the time ).Quality of life : Patients will be asked 
the Euro -Qol (EQ -5D-5L) to rate 5 symptoms (e.g., mobility, self-care ) on a 5-point scale ( 1=not 
at all to 4=very much).  37  
Contraindications to NRT:  Participants will be asked to respond to 3  questions  (4 for women 
under the age of 50 years)  to determine if the patient is contraindicated to receive NRT.  The 
study pharmacist will review all NRT requests for contraindications and formulate an appropriate 
plan based on revealed contraindications .  
Body Mass Index (BMI):  We will collect from the electronic medical record participant’s weight 
and height measures to calculate BMI.

confident to 4= Very confident).[ADDRESS_1266869].39 
Situational Self -efficacy :  A 12-item measuring 
situations that te mpt people to smoke.40  
Participa nts will be asked, “Please indicate 
whether you are sure that you could refrain from 
smoking in each situation”. Response options are:  Not at all sure, Not very sure, More or less sure, 
Fairly sure , and Absolutely sure. ” 
Desire to quit : Patients will  be asked four 
questions about their desire and determination to 
change smoking behavior ( α= .81).41 
Smoker Identity:  We will use two items to assess 
the degree to which a participant considers 
themselves a smoker over the course of the 
intervention.61, [ADDRESS_1266870] Scale (20-item 
PANAS) : Participants will be asked to report 
positive and negative affect . Items will be 
introduced by [CONTACT_903221] “ I’d like to know how you 
feel right at this moment. Your answer choices 
range from Not at All to Extremely . I’ll read you a 
list of words, and for each one, please tell me to what extent you feel that way right now (0= not at 
all to 4=extremely) .

Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS):  A 
6-item scale designed to address consistency of 
daily routine, ability  to plan, and anticipate future 
activities, and being on time.67, 68  
Use of other mood or smoking cessation aids:   
Patients  will be asked if they used other mood 
(antidepressants use and type, psychotherapy use and dose) or smoking cessation counseling 
outside study.  
Abrupt Versus Gradual Cessation:  A single item will assess the nature of smoking cessation 
behavior.65  
Process measures  
Use of smoking cessation self -help materials and counseling:   Patients will be asked how much 
of the self -help manual they read, and how useful the self -help manual was in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_903189].  
Use of intervention materials :  Patients will be asked how useful the counseling calls were in 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_903190] a friend who 
was trying to quit smoking. They will be asked if they used NRT and, if so, what type and what 
their level of adherence was  with NRT.  

VA Protocol -  Quit Smoking Telehealth [ZIP_CODE], v9, 2018- 02-[ADDRESS_1266871] assessment:  Cost assessment will be conducted from an implementation perspective, 
meaning only costs that will be incurred if the intervention were to be implemented throughout 
the VA are considered.   
Direct costs:  Cost assessment consists of three components: traini ng, telephone counseling 
labor input, and cost of NRT. We will collect both the trainer and trainee time needed to train the 
counselor to conduct the smoking cessation counseling calls. The counselor will log the total 
time needed for each counseling call including pre- call preparation and post -call tasks, like 
making patient notes. We will track time for unsuccessful call attempts and re -attempts. 
Aggregate time data will be multiplied by [CONTACT_100609]’s per -minute wage and further inflated 
by 30% to account for fringe benefits to derive direct telephone counseling cost. We will obtain 
unit cost of NRT from the Durham VA Pharmacy and apply this cost for the patients prescribed 
NRT in each study arm.  
  
Indirect costs:  The VA also incurs costs such as adminis trative costs, custodial costs, utilities, 
etc., that cannot be attributed to specific health services (i.e. indirect cost). The VA’s Health Economics Resource Center recommends allocating indirect costs as a percentage of direct 
cost.
[ADDRESS_1266872] -effectiveness: Two cost -effectiveness ratios commonly calculated in the smoking 
cessation economic s literature are cost per quitter and the gold standard of cost per life -year 
saved or quality -adjusted life years (QALY) saved.
[ADDRESS_1266873] -effectiveness analysis is to extrapolate quit 
rates to increases in life expectancy or QALYs.46 We will use the increase in QALYs due to 
smoking cessation provided by [CONTACT_68834]47, stratified by [CONTACT_903222], to 
extrapolate QALYS from quit rates in our study. Fiscella and Franks’ estimates mees cost -
effectiveness guidelines established by [CONTACT_903223] -adjusted life expectancy, and because an annual discount rate of 3% is applied. 
The total cost derived for each arm will be divided by [CONTACT_903224] -effectiveness ratio for both arms.   
Sensitivity Analyses : We will conduct sensitivity analyses to assess robustness of cost -
effectiveness results by [CONTACT_903225], NRT cost, and 
potential QALY gains from quitting.  
 
Risk/Benefit A ssessment  
The study is completely voluntary; participants are informed that they are free to refuse 
to answer any items on the questionnaires or questions form the interview that they do not wish 
to answer.  They are also informed that they are free to dec line participation in any procedure 
and can withdraw from the study at any time.  
VA Protocol -  Quit Smoking Telehealth [ZIP_CODE], v9, 2018- 02-12 Page 15 of 25 There are no known psychological hazards or risks associated with completing 
questionnaires, but it is possible that some distress or discomfort may be caused by [CONTACT_903226].  There is a potential risk associated with the loss of confidentiality of study 
data.  Risks also include discomfort related to quitting smoking. Quitting smoking will cause 
nicotine withdrawal that may lead to headaches, nausea, irritability, weight gain, difficulty 
concentrating, poor sleep, increased appetite increased anxious or depressed mood, and craving for cigarettes.   
Participants may choose nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) . There are risks 
associated with the use of NRT. Minimal risks associated with wearing a nicotine patch include 
skin irritation, dizziness, lightheadedness, increased heart rate or blood pressure, nausea or 
vomiting.  Participants must get VA physician authorization prior to receiving NRT if they have 
uncontrolled high blood pressure or taking medication for depression.  
  While participants may benefit from quitting smoking, there are no guaranteed benefits 
to the indiv idual participant and no immediate benefits of the proposed research to others. 
There are potential benefits to others from the information generated that potentially will be helpful in increasing reach of smoking cessation strategies and developi[INVESTIGATOR_643130] e ffective 
treatment interventions for smoking cessation for Veteran smokers. In our opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the anticipated benefits of this study outweigh the potential risks.  
 
 
Adverse Events   
Quitting smoking should enhance rather than jeopardize health status, and pot ential 
serious adverse events (SAE) for participants in this project are not expected.  Regardless, we 
will minimize potential risk by [CONTACT_68836]. Those with 
contraindications for NRT will be reviewed and cleared by [CONTACT_903227].    
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_903191]. There will be several 
ongoing mechanisms for monitoring and reporting of adverse events: 1) ongoing participant 
contact [CONTACT_2317], 2) a toll -free number provided to participants to report concerns 
related to study participation; 3) regular  meetings between the PIs and study personnel.  
Prior to initiation of any smoking cessation aid, participants will be informed again of the 
potential risks and side- effects associated with NRT or other medication. Participants also will 
be able to call directly via the study toll -free number to report AEs. This toll -free number, 
directed to the project coordinator’s  phone, will be provided to all participants upon entry into the 
study.  
All adverse events will be reviewed and patients evaluated as necessary by [CONTACT_903228]. In addition, study staff will provide patients with any applicable referral numbers. This and other instructions will be provided at the 
beginning of the study. The project manager will follow up with participants in a timely manner  to 
ensure that the event has been resolved and document actions taken.  
The PIs will meet regularly  with study personnel to discuss participants’ reactions to the 
intervention, proper delivery of the intervention, and any adverse events. Monthly meetings 
between the investigators and the project manager will allow for ongoing progress reports, 
including the number of participants currently involved in the study groups, attrition rates, and 
scheduled data collection from participants, as well as notification and review of any AEs. The 
investigative team will classify AEs as "health threatening" or "non- health threatening" events 
and "possibly attributable" or "non -attributable" to the intervention.  Some subjects may not 
complete all scheduled phone calls or follow -up surveys.  This is expected and will not be 
considered an AE.  
Current VA policy regarding reporting of AEs will be followed.    
 
VA Protocol -  Quit Smoking Telehealth [ZIP_CODE], v9, 2018- 02-12 Page 16 of 25 Costs and Payments to Subjects  
Patients in this study may be paid up to $100 . Patient will receive $30 for completing 
each follow -up survey and for those reporting not smoking, $[ADDRESS_1266874]’s completing an abbreviated version of the follow -up survey, 
they will be compensated $5 for their time.  The patient ’s usual VA prescription co- payments will 
apply  to NRT . 
Compensation is for the time and effort the patient invests to 1) complete the follow -up 
surveys and 2) where applicable, obtain a saliva sample, package and return it to the study 
team.  Without compensation, patients may not complete these two outcome measures for the 
study.   Patient’s may choose to decline payment.  
 
Data   
All patient inform ation collected in the context of this research study, and even the fact 
than an individual is participating in the study, will be considered confidential . The following 
steps will be taken to ensure confidentiality and safe handling of all data:  
1. Access to all participant data and information will be restricted to authorized personnel.  
2. Participants will not be identified by [CONTACT_169351], nor will data be 
presented in such a way that the identity of individual participants can  be inferred.  
3. Each participant will be assigned an anonymous study ID which will be used on all study 
forms  and within the study database . 
4. All study personnel will maintain certification with the D urham VAHCS  IRB that they 
have completed training in resear ch ethics and confidentiality.  
 
With respect to paper based records:  
1. All study records that contain participant information will be kept in secured, locked areas when not in use.  
2. Such materials, when in use, will be kept safe from public scrutiny  
3. Materials  that need to be discarded will be destroyed.  
 
Information Security  
Actual access is accomplished by [CONTACT_903229]’ domain IDs to study specific, 
and often directory or database specific, or role specific, security groups within the Active 
Directory.  For this research study, HSR&D COIN OIT support personnel polic y is to accept 
requests for access to data from principle investigators or their delegated project coordinators . 
The requests are captured in the VA’s instance of service Desk Manager from Computer Associates . The names for those for whom access is requested must be on a copy of the 
appropriate study’s IRB -approved staff listing on file with the center’s Program Specialist before 
access is granted.  
 
Data will be maintained in a secured server room within the Durham VA Medical Center, 
room FG104, Buil ding 1.  Data are backed up directly to tape. Most backups run daily, Monday 
through Friday.  Most tapes are retained indefinitely pending resolution of some questions 
around VA Research data retention policy . Tapes created at the NC Mutual building, via 
Symantec Backup exec, are moved from the server room to a separate room, also equipped 
with an intrusion alarm, keypad, and PIV card access . From there, the tapes are moved to an 
Iron Mountain storage facility, after being locked in purpose -made tape cartri dge carriers . Future 
backups may involve data backed up to near -line storage, at the Durham VAMC using EMC 
Networker software and associated hardware,  which  is then replicated to Richmond, Virginia, at 
another Region [ADDRESS_1266875] “Illume” from the DatStat Corporation. Access to the data collected is through various 
tools provided by [CONTACT_903230].   Illume provides additional levels or granularity of restriction to the 
data, beyond what is provided via Active Directory groups . “Illume”, running on top of Microsoft 
IIS, is a commercial web application configured to use https addresses . The application uses 
the Microsoft SQL server database previously mentioned, to store both survey questions, and 
the answers provided to them . The “Illume” application has been evaluated by [CONTACT_69304]6, whose 
personnel have run an “AppScan” on the application, and approved it s use at HSR&D.  
Individual workstations, desktop PCs or laptops, are patched using the VA standard, 
SCCM from Microsoft . Laptops and desktop PCs are encrypted using the VA standard tool 
Symantec’s SE E. Workstations are equipped with anti -virus and firewall  software.  
Data Destruction  
Records will be retained in accordance with the VA records control schedule.  
Data Access Termination 
OI&T personnel remove personnel’s IDs from the groups at the direction of the project 
coordinators and principal investigators . Termination of access will be requested when someone 
departs the project team.  
Incident Reporting  
Any suspected or confirmed loss of VA information will be reported to the Durham 
VAHCS  R&D, Privacy Officer, and Information Security Officer within 1 hour of awareness  of the 
issue and done so using the VHADUR Research Events Report e- mail group:  
[EMAIL_027] .  In addition, the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_903192], HSR&D 
Computer Scientist will be notified of suspected or confirmed loss of VA information.  
 
Confidentiality and Privacy  
 Of primary importance in all study activities will be the security and protection of pati ents’ 
private health information (PHI).  The responsibility of protecting this information begins the 
moment a member of the study team accesses information about a patient and does not 
ultimately end until project data sets are destroyed and/or anonymized in accordance with the 
VA records control requirements.    All information will be kept confidential as provided by [CONTACT_2371] . Confidentiality is maintained 
by [CONTACT_903231].  Data connecting the numerical code with identifying patient 
information will be stored in password -protected databases and will be accessible only to 
pertinent research staff.  All databases will reside on the secure VA network.   
All hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_903193] a secure file cabinet in a locked 
office on VHA property.  Identifiers will be destroyed at study end in accordance with the VA 
records control schedule.  All data will be entered and saved directly to a password protected database.  Research data, including access to the study database, will be limited to current 
research staff.  Removal of access to the research study data will be accomplished for study 
personnel when they are no longer a part of the research team.  
 All interviews and intervention contacts will be conducted by [CONTACT_3665] , and data 
will be directly entered into a VA computer located on VA property . In case of unforeseen 
computer or network failure, staff  will complete hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_832873] . The staff member  will

Safety Monitoring -  Handling of Unexpected or Adverse Events  
 The individuals responsible for safety monitoring will be the PI, the project manager, and 
the Study Physician. The Study Physician for this trial is John Williams, Jr., M.D.   As Study 
Physician, [CONTACT_69333] will ensure participants are medically cleared to p articipate in this trial 
and review all reports of adverse events sent by [CONTACT_903232].  
Interviewers and counselors will be trained and instructed to contact t he study 
coordinator immediately if the participant informs them of the occurrence of an adverse event . 
The study coordinator will inform the principal investigator, and a report of all adverse events will 
be included in progress reports submitted to the I RB. Serious adverse events for participants 
will be reported  according to current VA policy . Additionally, theft or loss of data, unauthorized 
access of sensitive data or storage devices, or non- compliance with security controls will be 
handled promptly in accordance with current VA policy.  
 The risks to participants in this study are minimal . Risks may include psychological 
distress after quitting smoking, and skin irritation or headaches resulting from use of the nicotine 
patch for those patients who opt to use NRT. In the event that a participant experiences 
problems due to NRT, he/she will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_5657]/her primary care physician.  This 
and other instructions regarding use of nicotine replacement and side effects associated with 
use of  NRT will be provided to the subject.   
 It is also possible that the interviews with participants will increase their psychological 
and emotional distress . A toll- free number will be provided to participants to report concerns 
related to study participati on, to ask questions, or to withdraw consent . If a participant 
experiences extreme distress while on the telephone with study staff, the counselor or 
interviewer will provide them with appropriate referral numbers . The study measure of 
depression, the Pati ent Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9), will be administered at screening  and 
follow- up. For patients who express an endorsement of suicidal ideation (endorsement of 
question #9 on the PHQ -9) and are greater than minimal risk on the P4 or have who show 
clinical warning signs of elevated risk of self -harm ( e.g., expression of intent to harm self, severe 
depression, significantly agitated, disordered thought, perceived burdensomeness on others) 
the RA will arrange a warm transfer to the Veteran Cris is Line . (See Appendix 7 for details.)  
 There will be several ongoing mechanisms for monitoring non- medical adverse events 
(e.g., anxiety related to the smoking cessation intervention, depression) . This monitoring will be 
facilitated by:  1) a toll -free number p rovided to participants to report concerns related to study 
participation; 2) ongoing patient contact [CONTACT_903233]; and 3) 
monthly meetings between the investigators , including study physician, and project team in 
which progres s reports are reviewed. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_716617]- Investigator  will conduct regular 
supervision meetings with the counselors to discuss participants’ reactions to the intervention, any adverse events, and proper delivery of the intervention.  
VA Protocol -  Quit Smoking Telehealth [ZIP_CODE], v9, 2018- 02-[ADDRESS_1266877] individual and mean trajectory plots of the longitudinal outcome 
variables (e.g., PHQ) to understand their general trends over the study period. In addition, we 
will explore the variability and correlation structure of the l ongitudinal outcome variables. All 
statistical analyses will be performed using the SAS software package; the Durham HSR&D 
Center of Innovation maintains the current SAS release on our system.  
Intent -to-Treat Analysis.  
All primary and secondary analyses f ocus on the effect of SMK -MM as compared to 
control. We, therefore, plan to use the intent -to-treat assumption for all analyses; participants 
will be analyzed as part of the group to which they are randomized, regardless of intervention 
adherence.  
Analyses 
Hypothesis 1.1:  Prolonged abstinence rates will be significantly higher among Veterans in the 
SMK- MM group as compared to those in the control group.  
Hypothesis 1.2:  The 7- day point prevalence abstinence rates will be significantly higher among 
Veterans i n the SMK -MM group as compared to those in the control group.  
 As described in Section E.10.1, rates of cigarettes abstinence (prolonged abstinence) 
will be assessed at [ADDRESS_1266878] for a between- group difference in abstinence 
rates at 6 months.  This logistic regression model can be written as: Logit(p i) = β 0 + SMK -MM i*β1 
, where p i represents the probability that patient i  has abstained from smoking  at the 6 -month 
follow- up. In this model, SMK -MM i is the intervention group indicator; therefore, β1 represents 
the log- odds ratio of smoking abstinence in the SMK -MM group as compared to the control 
group. For each of the abstinence outcomes, we will formally evaluate the intervention effect b y 
testing that β 1 differs from zero and report the odds ratio (exp( β1)) and 95% CI of the odds ratio.  
An odds ratio significantly greater than 1.[ADDRESS_1266879] 
higher prolonged abstinence rates. The model will also incl ude stratification variables ( gender , 
number of depression symptoms)  as recommended in the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal 
Products guidelines.49   
  Sustainability, or longer term effects of the intervention, will be examined by [CONTACT_903234] 12 months. We will model change in abstinence rates at baseline, 6, and 12 months using generalized linear models with a logit link fit with GEE 
(Generalized Estimating Equations).
[ADDRESS_1266880] 
essentially the same interpretation as those from a cross -sectional regression analysis (e.g. 
logistic regression) but are more appropriate as they properly incorporate the within- subject 
correlation that is inherent in the longitudinal structure of the data. The model will be fit using the 
SAS procedure GENMOD (SAS Institute, Cary, NC ). 
VA Protocol -  Quit Smoking Telehealth [ZIP_CODE], v9, 2018- 02-12 Page 20 of 25 Hypothesis 2.1: Veterans in the SMK -MM group will experience significantly less negative 
effects on depressive symptoms post cessation attempt as compared to the control group.  
 A general linear mixed model will be used to estimate changes in PHQ scores  over time 
and test the secondary hypothesis. Because of the small number of time points, we will apply an 
unstructured covariance matrix to take into account the within- patient correlation between 
repeated measures over time. The predictors in the model w ill include a dummy coded time 
effect and an indicator variable for the intervention interacting with the time effect. The model 
will have the form: Y = β0 + β1*(month6) + β 2*(month12) + β 3*(SMK -MM*month6) + β 4*(SMK -
MM*month12). This model assumes the groups have equal baseline means, which is 
appropriate for a randomized controlled trial and is equivalent in efficiency to an ANCOVA 
model.51 Additionally, the model will include the stratification variables. We plan to estimate the 
parameters in the model using the SAS procedure MIXED (SAS Version 9.2, Cary, NC).  
 Hypothesis 3.1: The relationship between adjunctive mood- management intervention and 
smoking cessation will be mediated by [CONTACT_6270] -efficacy,  and positive and negative affect  
 If there is a significant intervention effect on smoking cessation (i.e., if β
[ADDRESS_1266881] model above in Hypothesis 1.1) , then we also plan to examine 
whether change in self -efficacy  and affect mediate the impact of the intervention. This aim can 
be addressed under the general framework of mediation. We propose to conduct this mediation 
analysis using the MacArthur approach, a modification of the traditional Baron & Kenny criteria, 
developed for use specifically in randomized clinical trials.52,[ADDRESS_1266882] -treatment; therefore, for example, the change 
in patient self -efficacy measures  between baseline and 6 -months will be considered as potential 
mediators. The outcome will be patients’ abstinence at 12- months. We will first fit a model to 
examine the correlation between the mediator (C) and the SMK -MM group: C = γ0 + γ1*SMK -
MM. We also fit a model that examines the relationship between the mediator and the 
probability of abstinence (p): logit(p)  = β0 + SMK -MM*β1 + C*β2 + C*SMK -MM*β3. Improvements 
in patient self -efficacy  and affect  will be considered to account for improvements in abstinence 
rates if there is evidence that γ [ADDRESS_1266883] mode54: the Panel on Handling Missing Data in Clinical Trials recommends this 
framework.[ADDRESS_1266884] a sensitivity analysis where the mis sing ninth item is imputed with the follow -up 
sample mean.  
  
Sample Size Considerations:   
The sample size estimate is based on the primary hypothesis of the trial, which is that 
prolonged abstinence rates at the 6- month follow -up will be significantly higher among Veterans 
in the SMK -MM group as compared to the control group. The sample- size estimate is based on 
a Z-test for the difference in proportions, assuming a two- sided type I error rate of 5% and 
power of 80%. While we did have 20% quit rates in IIR 05- 202 for the total study population, the 
VA Protocol -  Quit Smoking Telehealth [ZIP_CODE], v9, 2018- 02-12 Page 21 of 25 7-day point prevalence rate for those with clinically meani ngful depression was only 17%. These 
quits rates are higher than those reported in the literature, 29,31 raising concern that they may be 
somewhat  anomalous. Thus, we derived quit rates for the proposed study from the broader 
smoking cessation literature. In a recent Cochrane review of smoking cessation interventions 
among those with depression, abstinence rates ranged from 0- 24%, with an average of  9.7%. 
As a second approach, we tried to derive an estimate more specific to the Veteran population. 
The largest trial to date of Veteran smokers (not selected for depression) exposed to telephone 
counseling and NRT yielded 14% prolonged abstinence rates.58 We then searched the literature 
for a correction factor that would convert this 14% prolonged abstinence rates into a cessation rate among depressed patients. A meta- analysis of quit rates among smokers with a history of 
depression demonstrated a 34% lower odds of long- term abstinence compared to non -
depressed patients (OR=0.66; 95% CI 0.53, 0.82).
11 If we extrapolate a 34% correction factor to 
the 14% prolonged abstinence rate, we get an expected rate of 9.7% prolonged abstinence for 
our depressed control group. In our meta -analysis, the mean differences between mood-
enhanced intervention and non- mood enhanced comparator was 10%; this differences jumped 
approximately 15% when NRT was used.16 
Based on results these studies, we estimate the  6-month prolonged abstinence rate to be 
approximately 10% in the contact -equivalent control condition, and 22% in the SMK -MM 
group.  With [ADDRESS_1266885] 80% power to detect this difference (12%) 
in prolonged abstinence rates. We anticipate a drop- out rate of 15% by 6 months; therefore, we 
plan to enroll 175 Veterans in each group to achieve adequate power. Because 7- day point 
prevalence rates are generally ~ 25% higher than prolonged abstinence rates,59 we estimate the 
6-month, 7- day point prevalence abstinence rate to be approximately 13% in the control group 
(10% x 1. 25=13%). With [ADDRESS_1266886] 80% power to 
detect a difference of 13% in 7 -day point prevalence rates at 6 months.     
 Given our planned sample size, we also examine the power and detectable difference 
for Hypothesis 2. 1 (depressive symptoms) evaluated at the [ADDRESS_1266887] 80% power to detect 
a differential improvement of 1.[ADDRESS_1266888] size of 0.24.

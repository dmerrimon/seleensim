 2 INTRODUCTION : BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND SCIENTIFIC RATIO NALE   
2.[ADDRESS_1132832] African and Asian countries 
where U.S. military personnel deploy, including countries where malaria is also endemic 
and where U.S. military personnel are required to take malaria prophylaxis. (1). The 
incubation period for rabies can be as long as [ADDRESS_1132833] -exposure prophylaxis was indicated but 
did not seek medical attention (2).  
Antimalarial drugs, chloroquine in particular, have previously been shown to impair the 
immune response to intradermal (ID) rabies v accination. A randomized controlled trial 
was performed in veterinary students to evaluate the antibody response to ID HDCV 
pre-exposure prophylaxis administered with and without chloroquine (3).  The study 
consisted of [ADDRESS_1132834] -vaccination, indicating that chloroquine taken in 
pre-exposure prophylaxis doses reduces t he antibody response to primary 
immunization with ID HDCV. This observation was also reflected in a Peace Corp 
population in Thailand who had received chloroquine and had reduced immune 
responses to rabies vaccine (4).  As a result, current ACIP guidelines  recommend that 
exposed persons who are taking malaria prophylaxis should receive a fifth dose of 
rabies vaccine 28 days after the exposure.  These guidelines do not differentiate 
between drugs used for malaria prophylaxis (5).   
Obtaining rabies vaccine a nd rabies immune globulin in a deployed setting can be 
challenging (6).  A full understanding of the requirements for protecting exposed 
individuals is necessary for appropriate decision making in a resource -constrained 
environment.  
2.[ADDRESS_1132835]-exposure prophylaxis vaccine 
regimen (without rabies  immune globulin)  in the presence or absence of an FDA -
approved malaria chemoprophylaxis  regimen .  
MALRAB  Version 11.[ADDRESS_1132836]-exposure prophylaxis in unvaccinated individuals who are not on malaria 
prophylaxis consists of four, 1.0 -mL IM injections of the human diploid c ell vaccine 
(HDCV) or purified chick embryo cell (PCECV) rabies vaccine on days 0, 3, 7,  and 14 
(5). In the event of an exposure, human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) would also be 
administered on day 0, at [ADDRESS_1132837] vaccine dose. In previously 
vaccinated individuals, HRIG is not administered, and two doses of vaccine are given, 
one at day 0 and one at day 3.  Current ACIP guidelines recommend that because 
“corticosteroids, other immunosuppressive agents, antimalarials, and 
immunosuppressive illnesses might reduce immune responses to rabies vaccines 
substantially,” exposed persons on antimalarials should receive a fifth dose of rabies 
vaccine on day 28.  The  guidelines do not differentiate between malaria prophylaxis 
regimens (5), therefore this fifth dose is indicated in all compliant soldiers serving in 
malaria -endemic areas.   
This study will administer the post -exposure regimen to volunteers from a US pop ulation 
of military age who are taking one of three malaria prophylaxis regimen s or no malaria 
prophylaxis.  The primary endpoint is the rabies titer [ADDRESS_1132838] dose  or 14 
days after completion of the 4 -dose regimen given to individuals not on  malaria 
prophylaxis  (ie, the time point at which the fifth dose would be given) to determine if 
there is any added value in administering this fifth dose.   
Malarone and doxycycline were chosen because they are the drugs most commonly 
prescribed to deploy ing soldiers for malaria prophylaxis.  Chlor oquine was chosen 
because this was the drug previously shown to affect the immune response to 
intradermal rabies vaccination given for pre -exposure prophylaxis  (3).  Its effect on the 
immune response to intramusc ular rabies vaccines given in the regimen for post -
exposure prophylaxis has not previously been studied.  
2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
2.3.1  Potential Risks  
Subjects receiving Rabies Vaccine  
Reactions to the current rabies vaccine are mild with local pain, erythe ma and swelling 
at the injection site. Systemic reactions are less frequent and include headache and 
malaise (1).  Guillain -Barré syndrome has been reported as a rare event following 
vaccination but its association with vaccination is uncertain (1).     
Subjects receiving Chloroquine  
Reactions to chloroquine include gastrointestinal  upset, headache and pruritus, which 
may be intolerable, is common among Africans.  
 
MALRAB  Version 11.[ADDRESS_1132839] more severe symptoms such as headaches, fever, chills, 
seve re diarrhea, and decreased urin ation.  
All subje cts 
 
Potential  risks of blood  sampling  include tenderness  or bruising  at the spot where  
blood  was drawn. Fainting  or dizziness  can occur  after a blood  draw, but  this is 
uncommon.  
2.3.2  Potential Benefits  
Potential benefits to subjects receiving the rabies vaccine include potentially developi[INVESTIGATOR_817970].

 4 STUDY  DESIGN  
This is a randomized, open -label, single site study conducted in 100 vaccinated healthy 
adults age ≥ 18 to ≤ 60  years old in the US.  
Subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be rando mly assigned  to one of the four 
groups through a computer generated process . 
Rabies vaccine will be administered to subjects who have been randomized into four 
groups . Group 1 will receive Ch loroquine ( po) for [ADDRESS_1132844] rabies 
vaccination. Group 2 will receive Malarone ( po) for [ADDRESS_1132845] rabies 
vaccination . Group 3 will receive Doxycycline ( po) for [ADDRESS_1132846] rabies 
vaccination. Group 4 (control) will begin rabies vaccination without antimalarial 
prophylaxis . See Table [ADDRESS_1132847] visits for RFFIT  assays. Samples will also be taken 
or exploratory proteomic and cellular assays.  
In all groups additi onal blood sam ples may be taken if required to assess AEs. 
Additional  biological sam ples (e.g., body fluid, tissue  samples) may be c ollected  in the 
event of an AE, or SAE.  
Clinical  site person nel will rec ord immediate unsolicited AEs that oc cur within  [ADDRESS_1132848] meet all of the 
following criteria:  
1. Provide signed and dated informed consent form . 
2. Willing to comply with all study procedures and be available for the duration of the 
study .  
3. Male or female, aged ≥ 18 to ≤ [ADDRESS_1132849] Exclusion Criteria  
An individual  who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation 
in this study:  
1. Subject is pregnant, or lactating, or of childbearing potential (to be considered of 
non-childbearing potential, a female must be post -menopausal for at least [ADDRESS_1132850] unable to meet the 
requirements of the protocol.  
10. Previous adverse reaction to any of the antimalarial drugs used in this study.  
Temporary Exclusion Criteria : Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to 
investigator judgment) or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0°C [≥ 100.4°F])  on day 0. . A 
prospective subject should not be includ ed in the study until the condition has resolved 
or the febrile event has subsided.  If the delay for the febrile illness exceeds the window 
between screening and vaccination, or if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093], a 
prospective subject may be re -screened once the fever has resolved.   
Recent o r scheduled receipt of any vaccine [ADDRESS_1132851] 
permuted -block design will be used for randomization/allocation in order to avoid 
undesirable differences in the numbers of patients assigned to each group . 
5.4.[ADDRESS_1132852] 39 subjects would be randomized to malarone, doxycycline and control group 
(1:1:1).  Subjects 40 -100 would be randomized to chloroquine, malarone, doxycycline 
and control grou ps (2:1:1:1). This would ensure that upon completion of enrollment

 subjects would be randomly allocated 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_1132853] . 
5.5.1  Contraindications for Subsequent Vaccinations  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Temporary Contraindications  
An investigator may temporarily postpone a subject ’s further vaccination until the 
following are resolved:  
• Ongoing clinical AE or biological  abnormality related to the trial vaccination  
• Febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0°C [≥ 100.4°F]) or moderate or severe acute 
illness/infection on the day of vaccination, according to Investigator judgment.  
• Acute illness on day of vaccination that the inves tigator determines the subject to 
be ineligible for vaccine that day.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitive Contraindications  
An investigator may terminate a study subject’s  participation in the study if  the following 
contraindications are met : 
• Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical

MALRAB  Version 11.[ADDRESS_1132858] Description  
There are four (4) products used for this study: RabAvert® ( rabies vaccine) produced by 
[CONTACT_817982] , chloroquine phosphate , malarone  and 
doxycycline hyclate .  
RabAvert® (Rabies Vaccine)  
RabAvert® ( rabies vaccine) produced by [CONTACT_817983] a 
sterile freeze -dried vaccine obtained by [CONTACT_188828] -virus strain Flury LEP in 
primary cultures of chicken fibroblasts. The strain Flury LEP was obtained from 
American Type Culture Collection as the 59th egg pa ssage. The growth medium for 
propagation of the virus is a synthetic cell culture medium with the addition of human 
albumin, polygeline (processed bovine gelatin) and antibiotics. The virus is inactivated 
with β -propi[INVESTIGATOR_188811], and further processed by [CONTACT_817984] l centrifugation in sucrose density -
gradient. The vaccine is lyophilized after addition of a stabilizer solution that consists of 
buffered polygeline and potassium glutamate. One dose of reconstituted vaccine 
contains less than 12 mg polygeline (processed bovine gelatin), less than 0.[ADDRESS_1132859]; ovalbumin content is less than 3 
ng/dose (1 mL), based on ELISA. In the final vaccine, neomycin is present at < 1 μg, 
chlortetracycline at < 20 ng, and amphotericin B at < 2 ng per  dose. RabAvert® is 
intended for intramuscular (IM) injection. The vaccine contains no preservative and 
should be used immediately after reconstitution with the supplied Sterile Diluent for 
RabAvert® (Water for Injection). The potency of the final product is determined by [CONTACT_817985] (NIH) mouse potency test us ing the US reference 
standard. The potency of one dose (1.0 mL) RabAvert® is at least 2.5 IU of rabies 
antigen. RabAvert® is a white, freeze -dried vaccine for reconstitution wi th the water for 
injection diluent prior to use; the reconstituted vaccine is a clear to slightly opaque, 
colorless solution.    
Form:  Powder and solvent for suspension for injection

 8 SAMPLE COLLECTION  
Blood samples will be collected for Research Laboratory Assays according to the Blood 
Draw Schedule in Appendix A. Immediately prior to the blood draw; the staff member 
performing the procedure will  remove the collection tubes from the supplied kit and 
verify the subject’s ID number on the labels. Blood will be taken prior to vaccination(s).  
In the event of an AE or SAE, additional biological samples (e.g., additional blood, body 
fluids, tissue samples) may be collected.  
8.1 Sample Preparation  
Blood samples wi ll be retrieved and processed according to Center for Global Health 
and Translational Science  (CGHATS)  Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) or Study 
Specific Procedures  (SSP) . Briefly, serum samples will be maintained at room 
temperature for the allotted ti me, centrifuged, aliquoted and frozen at -80°C for long 
term storage. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) samples will be centrifuged, 
plasma will be removed and retained, cells will be washed, resuspended in freezing 
media, aliquoted and frozen in li quid nitrogen vapor phase for long term storage.  
8.[ADDRESS_1132879] (RFFIT)  
RFFIT is a serum neutralization (inhibition) test, which means it measures the ability of 
rabies specific antibodies to neutralize rabies virus and prevent the virus from infecting 
cells. These antibodies are called rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (RVNA) .  
The World Health Organization (WHO) guideline of 0.5 International Units per milliliter 
(IU/mL) is used as an adequate response to r abies vaccination, as well as the ACIP 
level of “complete neutralization at a serum dilution of 1:[ADDRESS_1132880]” as evidence 
of adequate response in a person . 
RFFIT analysis will be performed on samples taken from Day 0, prior to vaccination 3, 
prior to vaccination 4, [ADDRESS_1132881] 4th vaccination.  
8.2.2  Proteomics  
Proteomics is the analysis of the expression, localization, function, and interactions of a 
set of proteins expressed by [CONTACT_188838] a given set of 
environment al conditions, using iTRAQ or equivalent method. This technique offers a 
novel method to evaluate clinical samples from experimental inoculation for 
identification of novel biomarkers and correlates of immunogenicity.  Proteomics may 
help elucidate the mech anisms by [CONTACT_817993].  Proteomics analysis can be performed on either serum or plasma 
samples.  Proteomics is an exploratory assay and may or may not be done based on

 whether a statistically significa nt difference in GMT is detected between study groups 
and on  data collected from other ongoing studies .  
8.2.3  Cellular Assays  
The cellular response to rabies vaccination is an exploratory assay  and may or may not 
be done  based on whether or not a difference in  GMT is detected between study 
groups and data collected from other ongoing studies.  
8.2.4  Urine Analysis  
Urine will be analyzed to determine if chloroquine  is excreted in part, bound to saposin 
B. Saposin B may play a role in mitigating chloroquine toxicity and /or may be a source 
of toxicity associated with long term chloroquine  use. 
8.2.5  Sample Storage  and Shipment  
Samples will be stored in temperature controlled units, -80°C  ± 10°C  for serum and 
plasma samples, vapor phase liquid nitrogen for PBMCs. These units are monitored [ADDRESS_1132882] be compliant with the 
International Air Transport Association (IATA) [ADDRESS_1132883] dose of antimalarial and 30 minutes after each 
rabies va ccination to ensure their safety. Any AE that occurs during this period will be 
noted on the source document and identified as an immediate event / reaction; and will 
additionally be recorded in the eCRF .  
9.[ADDRESS_1132884], adverse psychological reactions, or breach 
of confidentiality. Risks to others (eg, program personnel) must also be reported .  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems 
involving risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or 
outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research 
procedures that are described  in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
• related or possibly related to participation in the research ( “possibly relat ed” 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
The IRB and the HRPO will evaluate the PI’s and research monitor’s reports to 
determine whether a given incident, experience or outcome constitutes an unanticipated 
problem i nvolving risk to subjects or others and ensure upward reporting of the 
unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others to the appropriate regulatory 
offices . 
9.1.[ADDRESS_1132885] , including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease , temporally associated with the subject’s 
MALRAB  Version 11.[ADDRESS_1132886]’s 
participation in the research.  
9.1.3  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred)  
• Results in  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect   
• An important medical event that may not result in death, be l ife threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222285], based upon appropriate

 10 STUDY  OVERSIGHT  
10.1 Research Monitor  
In addition to the PI’s responsibility for oversight, study  oversight will be under the 
direction of a Research Monitor .  The research monitor  is independent of the study and 
will be available in real time to review and recommend appropriate action regarding 
adverse events and other safety issues.  
Per requirements of Department of Defense Instructions 3216.02, research funded with 
Department of Defense funds requires a research monitor to be appointed.  [CONTACT_818003]  will be the research monitor for this trial.  His duties will include 
reviewing and providing and unbiased assessment and written report of all: SAEs, 
Subject deaths, Unexpected  AEs, Protocol deviations that are related to an adverse 
event impacting the subject, Annual reports and Unanticipated problems involving risks 
to subject and others involved in the trial.  The research monitor may observe 
recruitment and enrollment proced ures and the consent process for individuals, groups 
or units, review monitoring plans and data collection . 
The research monitor may discuss the research protocol with the investigators, 
interview human subjects, and consult with others outside of the stud y about the 
research.  He shall have authority to stop a research protocol in progress, remove 
individual human subjects from a research protocol, and take whatever steps are 
necessary to protect the safety and well -being of human subjects until the IRB ca n 
assess the monitor's report.  He shall have the responsibility to promptly report his 
observations and findings to the IRB or other designated official and the Human 
Research Protection Office . 
MALRAB  Version 11.[ADDRESS_1132889] ed to ensure that the rights of human subjects are 
protected, that the study is implemented in accordance with the protocol and/or other 
operating procedures, and that the quality and integrity of study data and data collection 
methods are maintained.  The monitor will evaluate study processes and documentation 
based on International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), E6: Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines (GCP).  
Before the start of the trial (i.e., before the inclusion of the first subject), the 
Investigato rs and the Monitoring representative will meet at the site -initiation visit to 
discuss the trial protocol and the detailed trial procedures. Emphasis will be placed on 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, visit timing, informed consent procedures, eCRF 
comple tion, and the handling of samples and products . 
The monitoring staff will ensure and document that all material to be used during the 
trial has been received at the site; and that the study investigator team and local 
monitoring staff have been properly in formed about the trial, GCP and regulatory 
requirements . 
After the start of the trial, the monitoring staff or a representative will be in regular 
contact [CONTACT_817995] -up 
visits. The Investigator or delegate must be available for these visits, and must allow the 
monitoring staff direct access to subject medical files and eCRFs. During these visits, 
the monitoring staff will : 
• Evaluate the quality of the trial progress (adherence to protocol and any study -
specific guidelines, quality of data collection and document completion, signature 
[CONTACT_35396], occurrence of SAEs, sample and product management, cold -
chain monitoring, archiving, and direct observation of study procedures during 
the trial) . 
• Source-verify completed eCRFs and any corresponding answered queries . 
• Determine the number of complete or ongoing issues identified at monitoring 
visits (e.g., protocol violations, SAEs). Any identified problems will be discussed 
with the Investigator, and c orrective or preventive actions will be determined, as 
appropriate . 
• Review that all protocol procedures have been completed and the data have 
been entered into the eCRF. All data -related queries must be completed prior to 
database lock . 
At the end of the t rial, a close -out visit will be performed to ensure that:  
• CGHATS  has all the documents necessary for archiving . 
• All samples have been shipped to the appropriate laboratories.  
• All unused products have been either destroyed or accounted for . 
MALRAB  Version 11.[ADDRESS_1132890] dosage schedules in the presence of malaria chemoprophylaxis. No formal 
statistical hypothesis tests will be conducted. Descripti ve analyses will be based on the 
per-protocol analysis sets.  
 
Exploratory statistical analyses of final data may be conducted, if indicated by [CONTACT_188867]. Parametric, non -parametric and resampling (bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) methods 
for statistical inference may be used in exploratory analyses, based on data compliance 
with assumptions of methods.  P -values ≤ 0.05 will be considered significant and p -
values ≤ 0.10 will be considered a trend. Confidence intervals will be constructed at 
α=0.05 and α=0 .10.  When necessary, p -value corrections for multiple comparisons will 
be applied.  
 
Descriptive and any inferential analyses will be carried out using SAS Version 9.2 (or 
higher), which is licensed and supplied by [CONTACT_188833], Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003] . 
12.2 Sample Size  Considerations  
The planned sample size is 100 subjects, who will be randomly allocated (1: 1:1:1) into 
three  treatment groups  and one control group .  The sample size was chosen 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675], based on sample sizes of other exploratory studies of this general  type.  
This exploratory study is not powered to formally test equivalency or non -inferiority in 
immunogenicity among groups according to malaria prophylaxis.  Subjects who withdraw 
prior to first vaccination will be replaced by [CONTACT_817996] o will be 
assigned to the same group as the withdrawn subject. Replacement subjects will not be 
randomized.    
12.2.[ADDRESS_1132891] fourth vaccine dose.  
Per Protocol Analysis Set  
The Per -Protocol (PP) analysis set will include all subjects who had no protocol 
deviations at the time that the data was collected. Two PP analysis sets will be 
produced for the primary objective that will contain separate data from blood drawn on 
day [ADDRESS_1132892] 4th vaccination .   
Subjects will be excluded from the PPAS for the following reasons : 
1. Subject did not meet all protocol -specified inclusion/exclusion criteria or 
experienced a definitive contraindication  
2. Administration of vaccine was not done per protocol  
3. Subject did not receive vaccine in the proper time window as defined in the study 
procedures  
4. Subject did not provide a post -dose serology sample in the proper time window 
as defi ned in the study procedures * 
5. For the malarone and doxycycline groups, subject missed the three or more of 
the daily dose of antimalarial in any one week.  
6. For the chloroquine group, subject missed their weekly dose by [CONTACT_817997]  
*Subjects whose ser ology sample is outside the defined window for the secondary 
endpoint will still be included in the primary endpoint analysis.  
For the computation of GMTs, a titer reported as < LLOQ will be converted to a value of 
0.5 LLOQ.  
For calculating fold -rise and t iter ratio (GMTR), < LLOQ will be converted to 0.5 LLOQ 
for a numerator and < LLOQ will be converted to LLOQ for a denominator  
Any titer reported as > ULOQ (upper limit of quantization) will be converted to ULOQ.  
Missing data will not be imputed.

 Potenti al outliers will be identified using histograms and modified box plots or normal 
probability plots, when appropriate.  Choice of subsequent tests for outliers (e.g. 
Grubbs, Tietjen -Moore and ESD) will depend on the number and nature of suspected 
outliers a nd may require data transformation.  Bootstrapped estimates of standard 
errors may also be reported.  Sensitivity analysis of effect of outliers on descriptive 
statistics will be conducted, and if necessary descriptive statistics that include and 
exclude ou tliers will be reported

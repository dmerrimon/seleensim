 Title COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF HEALTH SYSTEM -BASED 
VERSUS COMMUNITY -BASED DEMENTIA CARE / A PRAGMATIC 
TRIAL OF THE EFFECTIVENESS AND COST -EFFECTIVENESS OF 
DEMENTIA CARE  
Study Design  The design is a pragmatic randomized  3-arm superiority trial.  The unit 
of randomization  is the patient /caregiver dyad . 
Study Duration  6 years  
Trial Sites  4 trial sites: Baylor, Scott, & White Health ; Geisinger Health ; University 
of [LOCATION_007] Medical Branch Health Care System; Wake Forest University  
Objective  Conduct a pragmatic randomized trial to determine the comparative 
effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of two evidence -based models of 
comprehensive dementia care  as well as the effectiveness and cost -
effectiveness of both arms versus usual care .  
Number of Subjects  
(Target)  2150 : 100 0 in each intervention  arm and 1 50 in the usual care group   
Main Inclusion 
Criteria  Community -living , including Assisted Living Facilit ies (cannot reside in 
a nursing home at the time of recruitment ), persons with  diagnosis of 
dementia established by a physician or other primary care provider  
(PCP) , have family or friend caregiver (s) who speak English or 
Spanish, and have a PCP who is willing to partner with the program

 Intervention s Health systems -based dementia care  (based on the UCLA Alzheimer’s 
and Dementia Care program) provided by a nurse practitioner or 
physician’s assistant Dementia Care Specialist  who works within the 
heath system.  
Community -based dementia care  (using the BRI Benjamin Rose 
Institute Care Consultation model) provided by a social worker or nurse 
Care Consultant who works at a community -based organization ( CBO ).  
Both arms include structured assessments and creation of care or 
action plans, care coordination, and caregiver education and support , 
but they differ in key areas including the frequency and mode of 
communication with persons with dementia and caregivers, the degree 
of integration into the health system, including order -writing capability 
and use of the electronic health record.  
Usual care  with consistent referral to Alzheimer’s Association H elpline 
([PHONE_3929]) to speak to master’s level consultants for decision -
making support, crisis assistance , and caregiver education , and 
referral to local programs and services . 
Duration of 
Intervention  and 
Follow -up 18 months  
Primary Outcome  Behavioral symptoms and resulting caregiver distress as measured by 
[CONTACT_183245] -Q Severi ty and Modified Caregiver Strain  Index scales.   
Primary Analysis  All analyses will be according to intent -to-treat. The analysis of the two 
primary outcomes – NPI-Q Severity and Modified Caregiver Strain 
Index scores – will be done using a longitudinal repeated measures 
analysis based on maximum likelihood methods adjusted for the 
stratified randomization by [CONTACT_3725]. Treatment differences will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_183246] e intervals.   
Secondary 
Outcomes  NPI-Q Distress,  caregiver unmet needs and confidence , and caregiver 
depressive symptoms .  
Tertiary Outcomes  Patient long-term nursing home placement , functional status, cognition, 
goal attainment  scaling (GAS) , “days spent at home”, D ementia Burden 
Scale-Caregiver , a composite measure of clinical benefit , Quality of Life 
of person s with dementia , Positive Aspects of Caregiving

Interim Analysis  Because this is a minimal risk trial with a relatively short follow -up 
period (18 months), no monitoring for efficacy or futility is proposed; 
only monitoring for safety will be done.

 1. INTRODUCTION  
This document is a protocol for a human research study to be conducted according to US and international 
standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization 
guidelines), applicable government regulations , and institutional research policies and procedures.  
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES   
This pragmatic randomized clinical trial of [ADDRESS_216505] -effectiveness of 18 months of health systems -based dementia care (based on the 
UCLA Alzheimer’s and Dementia Care program) provided by  a nurse practitioner Dementia Care Specialist  
who works within the heath system versus community -based dementia care (using the BRI Benjamin Rose 
Institute Care Consultation model) provided by a social worker or nurse Care Consultant who works at a CBO  
and will compare both dementia care interventions to usual care . Caregivers and p atients  bring their unique 
personal perspective s of how dementia affect s their lives, what outcomes are important to them, and what 
attributes of the interventions render them feasible, scalable, and sustainable. The clinical sites bring 
participants, clinical environments, and expertise in patient -centered research and implem entation.  The 
investigators, patients, and other stakeholders planned and prepared this protocol  jointly; these partners will 
continue to be collaboratively engaged in all aspects of the trial’s implementation.  
The study’s Specific Aims are:  
1. To engage 4 sets of health systems and community -based organizations, patients, families, and other 
stakeholders in a pragmatic clinical trial  
2. To adapt and implement 2 dementia care interventions at each CTS, including training of DCS’  and 
Care Consultants and pi[INVESTIGATOR_183202], assessments , and outcomes  
3. To recruit 2150  participants and randomize them to receiving HSDC (N=1000), CBDC  (N=1000), or 
usual care ( N=150) 
4. To administer the interventions for [ADDRESS_216506] self/caregiver -reported outcomes and use claims data to evaluate other secondary and 
tertiary outcomes  
6. To compare the effectiveness of the [ADDRESS_216507] analyses of tertiary outcomes of both interventions versus usual care including mortality, 
time spent at home, long -term nursing home placement, patient/caregiver satisfaction , goal attainment 
scaling (in the 2 active intervention groups),  and comparing all three groups on several types of 
utilization and out -of-pocket expenses . We will assess physician satisfaction with dementia care 
provided by [CONTACT_941] 3 treatment groups.  
3. BACKGROUND  
In the  [LOCATION_002], an estimated 5.7  million persons are affected by [CONTACT_7351]’s disease, the most common 
type of dementia.1 The total number with dementia is higher because Alzheimer’s disease is responsible for 
only 60 -80% of dementias and is expected to grow to 7.[ADDRESS_216508] -EFFECTIVENESS OF DEMENTIA

DEMENTIA CARE

 span both the patient and caregiver, medical and social domains, and health system and community -based 
organizations (CBOs).  
In response, several dementia care programs have been developed to comprehensively meet the needs of 
patients and their families including providing care coordination, high quality dementia care, and caregiver 
support.  Some have been based within health care systems and reach out to the communities  whereas others 
are based in the community and reach in to the health care system. Although both approaches have 
demonstrated effectiveness on quality and clinical outcomes, the comparative effectiveness of these  two 
models is unknown.   
4. STUDY DESIGN  
The study  is a pragmatic randomized clinical trial of 2150  participants at four diverse clinical trial sites to 
compare  the effectiveness of 18 months of health systems -based dementia care (based on the UCLA 
Alzheimer’s and Dementia Care program) provided by  a nurse practitioner Dementia Care Specialist  (DCS ) 
who works within the heath system versus community -based dementia care (using the BRI Benjamin Rose 
Institute Care Consultation model) provided by a social worker or nurse Care Consultant who works at a CBO  
versus usual care .

4.2.1  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Table 1  lists the inclusion and exclusion criteria for participation i n the trial  
Table 1: Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion Criteria  
 i. The participant must have a diagnosis of dementia established by a physician or 
other primary care provide r 
 ii. The participant must have a caregiver who speaks English or Spanish and has a 
phone  
 iii. The participant must have a PCP who is willing to partner with the program  
iv. Persons living with dementia in assisted living facilities will be eligible if they do not 
meet any exclusion criteria (however, no more than 25% of participants can be living 
in assisted living facilities at the time of enrollment.   This will be monitored when the 
first 25% of the sample has been enrolled.)  
 
 
Exclusion Criteria  
 i. The participant resides in a nursing home at the time of recruitment .  
ii. The participant is enrolled in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]  (at the time of screen)

[ADDRESS_216510] a 
diagnosis of dementia established by [CONTACT_183247] (ICD 9/10) or on problem list and/or past medical 
history codes . Lists will be  forwarded to the PCPs, practice nurses, or likely partnering physicians (determined 
by [CONTACT_3433] e sites) to review and obtain permission to contact  [CONTACT_4676]/caregiver and confirm  willingness to partner.  
4.3.2  Recruitment  and Enrollment  
Participants will be recruited through physician referral. PCPs will be made aware of the trial through e -mail, 
fliers, and other traditional marketing techniques. In addition, clinical trial site staff will make presentations at 
meetings of participating medical practices , support groups, council meetings, senior centers, and health fairs . 
Local Patient and Stakeholder Committees (LPSC) will also provide advice about local strategies to promote 
recruitment (e.g., wording of documents, incentives) . Some phy sician s or practices may opt to provide a 
“blanket” referral for all their patients with dementia and, if so, study team members may reach out directly to 
recruit participants.  Alternatively, PCPs may choose to review their lists of persons with dementia and delete 
any patients who should not be contact[CONTACT_183248].   
Patients and/or caregivers may also self -refer.  Self -referrals may originate from a variety of ways.  For 
instance, an individual may see a poster in a clinic waiting room, or they may be informed about the study by 
[CONTACT_183249], or from an employee of a community -based organization.  If potential participants would 
like to know more about the study, they must contact [CONTACT_779]’s staff  directly (i.e., self -refer). Then the site 
coordinator will provide further information about the study (and ans wer any of their questions), and if the 
patient and/or caregiver is interested in participating, the site coordinator should assess whether the dyad 
meets the study’s eligibility criteria (i.e., conduct an eligibility screening). If eligible, the potential  participant’s 
PCP will be notified and will be asked about her or his  willingness to partner. If the potential participant meets iv. The participant’s caregiver is unwilling or anticipates being incapable of providing 
self-reported outcome measures for 18 months  
v. Baseline measures refused or not completed  
vi. The caregiver is paid and is not a relative  or close friend of the participant  
vii. At telephone or in -person screener , the caregiver has cognitive impairment  
viii. The patient or caregiver is participating in another dementia intervention study  
ix. Patients and caregivers who are members of a sites’ Local Patient & Stakeholder 
Committee  
x. There is already a member of the same household participating in the study.

 eligibility criteria and does not meet exclusion criteria and if the PCP is willing to partner , an enrollment/ 
baseline interview will be scheduled.  
At the time of enrollment , study staff at each site will identify the primary and a back -up caregiver (in the event 
that the primary caregiver is no longer able to participate ), review inclusion and exclusion criteria, discuss the 
study with the caregiver over the telephone, and schedule the baseli ne assessment .  
Upon successful completion of baseline assessment, caregivers and patients who are able to consent (see 
informed consent section 11.2) will be consented and enrolled into the study.   
4.3.3 Early Withdrawal of Participants  
Because this trial is based on the principle of “intent -to-treat”, all participants will be analyzed in the group to 
which the participant was randomly assigned, regardless of whether they complete the intervention  or not.  
This preserves the effect of randomization. Because the intervention will be integrated into the work flow of the  
practice  and community -based care , we expect relatively few withdrawals from the intervention s. We will have 
four levels of study withdrawal : 
• Withdrawal from study interventions but willing to provide study outcomes by [CONTACT_63496]/interview 
and allow analysis of medical records and CMS claims data. Subsequent Information on health care 
utilization outcomes will be obtained from CMS claims data and medical records.  
• Withdrawal from study interventions and willing to provide study outcomes by [CONTACT_63496]/interview 
but unwilling to allow analysis of medical records and CMS claims data.  
• Withdrawal from study interventions and unwilling to provide study outcomes by [CONTACT_63496]/interview 
but willing to allow analysis of medical records and CMS claims data. Subsequent Information on health 
care utilization outcomes will be obtained from CMS claims data and medical records.  
• Withdrawal from study interventions and unwilling to provide study outcomes by [CONTACT_63496] /interview  
or allow analysis of medical records and CMS claims data . If the participant elects full withdrawal from 
the study, this will be recorded on the Participant Final Disposition Form and no further information will 
be obtained about the participant.  
For participants who are lost to follow -up but who have not withdrawn from the study , we will be able to obtain 
information from the electronic health record or from the u tilization or claims data on secondary and tertiary 
outcomes .   
 
Each of the interventions will be administered until the final 18 -month assessment is completed  unless any of 
the following occur:  
• Patient or caregiver withdraw and there is not a willing replacement caregiver (see 4.3 .3) 
• Patient Death  
• Move s out of the catchment area  and unable to continue to receive the intervention

 5.1 HSDC  
This intervention will be based on the model originally developed at Indiana University and subsequently 
modified in the UCLA Alzheimer’s and Dementia Care (ADC) program8, a 2012 Center for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services Healthcare Innovations Challenge Awardee. The UCLA ADC program is based at an 
academic health care system and partners with CBOs to provide comprehensive, coordinated, patient -
centered care for patients with dementia. T he goals of the program are to optimize patient function, 
independence and dignity, minimize caregiver strain and burnout and re duce unnecessary costs through 
improved care.  
 
HSDC utilizes a nurse practitioner (NP) or physician assistant (PA) Dementia Care Specialist  (DCS ) 
supervised by a physician dementia specialist to tailor and facilitate dementia care delivery in collaboration with 
the primary care physician (co -management). Based on input from stakeholders who will be key to 
disseminating this intervention if it is successful, the name [CONTACT_183315], which was used in the original UCLA Alzheimer’s and Dementia Care program, t o 
Dementia Care Specialist. NPs and Pas can write orders, communicate directly through the EHR , and facilitate 
clinical care. Dementia care is based in the health care system, which partners with CBOs to provide 
comprehensive, coordinated, patient -centered care for persons with dementia. Key components include:   
o Structured needs assessments of patients and their caregivers . HSDC begins with an in -person visit or via 
telemedicine, with a  Dementia Care Specialist (DCS ) including the patient and at least one family member 
or primary  caregiver.  To prepare for the visit and make it most efficient, patients (if early stage) and/or 
caregiver are asked to complete a structured pre -visit instrument 
(http://dementia.uclahealth.org/workfiles/for -physicians/Intake -Form -2017.pdf  ) that includes information 
about the patient and caregivers.  The assessment is scheduled as a 90-minute in -person or via 
telemedicine session during which additional information is obtained by [CONTACT_183251].   In this manner , the DCS  assesses the patient and caregiver’s  needs and their resources.   
 
o Creation and implementation of individualized dementia care plans  based on needs assessments. Based 
on these initial assessments, the DCS  works with the patient and family to draft a personal care plan, which 
is sent to the referring PCP for approval or modification. This interaction with the PCP is aimed at ensuring 
continuity of care. To be efficient and succinct, this EHR -delivered infor mation is divided into medical 
recommendations that the primary care physician is asked to address (and respond back th rough the EHR) 
and social and behavioral recommendations that the DCS  implements independently. When the DCS  has 
received a response from the referring physician, the assessment note is finalized and uploaded  to the 
EHR . The patient /caregiver  then receives a phone call from the DCS  to discuss the final recommendations.  
 
All patients and their families receive ongoing dementia care management by a DCS  supervised by a 
physician dementia specialist, which may include:  
• In-person  or telemedicine  sessions at which patient and family members’ specific questions about 
problems, resources, and implementing care plans are answered  
• Telephone follow -up to monitor implementation of dementia care plans  
• Facilitation of appointments with consultants when needed  
• Teaching dementia management skills to caregivers through individual counseling including information 
on: legal and financial planning with referral to community services, behavioral techniques to 
avoid/manage behavioral problems, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_183205].  
 
Other components of the care plan are tailored to the individual and can include the following components:  
• Consultation with neurology, geriatric psyc hiatry, psychology, or geriatrics  for additional diagnostic 
evaluation (e.g., if there are unusual symptoms) or management of refractory complications    
• Caregiver support groups , either community -based or provided by [CONTACT_73733]

• Referral to community -based organizations  for services such as delivered meals, adult day care, 
care/case management, financial and legal counseling, and transportation assistance as well as 
caregiver traini ng. 
o Monitoring and revising care plans, as needed , including active monitoring and support of the caregiver’s 
emotional and physical health. Adjustments to the care plan are made as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_183252]. All patients are re -evaluated for disease progression and 
adequacy of resources every 3 -4 months by [CONTACT_183253] 1 -year intervals in person  or via 
telemedicine .

5.2 CBDC  
BRI Care Consultation is  a care coaching program for patients with dementia and/or other chronic illnesses 
and for their family or friend caregivers. Grounded in the Stress Process Conceptual Framework2,3, BRI Care 
Consultation is consumer -driven, with a focus on problems or concerns that are important to patients and 
caregivers.  
Care Consultants deliver the program. They have  bachelor’s or master’s degrees in social work, nursing, or 
other helpi[INVESTIGATOR_183206] -based organizations. BRI Care Consultation gives equal 
attention to the patients and their primary family or friend caregivers. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_183207], patients are 
engaged in the program, whenever possible.[ADDRESS_216512] content of assistance provided is tailored to the preferences of individual patients and caregivers 
and is holistic in the ra nge of potential concerns of problems addressed. General areas of assistance include : 
• Increasing access to and monitoring the use of community services and resources,  
A PRAGMATIC TRIAL OF THE EFFECTIVENESS AND COST -EFFECTIVENESS OF DEMENTIA 
CARE/ COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF HEALTH SYSTEM -BASED VERSUS  COMMUNITY -BASED 
DEMENTIA CARE  
 
16 
 • Mobilizing support from the informal network of family and friends,  
• Providing and helpi[INVESTIGATOR_183208] - and caregiving -related information and consumer -ready 
educational materials about medical and non -medical issues,  
• Offering emotional support to both patients and caregivers, and  
• Facilitating  communication and coordination of assistance among patients/caregivers, health care 
providers, and community service providers.  
BRI Care Consultation is low -cost and convenient to use because it is delivered by [CONTACT_756], computer, and 
mail; no in -person contacts are required. It has a standardized protocol that requires at least monthly contacts 
between Care Consultants and patien ts and/or caregivers during the first four months. Required contacts 
decrease to every three months thereafter, although more frequent contacts can be made as part of the Action 
Plan (described below). Contacts often increase when there are changes in pati ents’ symptoms, caregivers’ 
availability or capacity, when new problems arise, or when there are transitions in care settings (e.g., after a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], nursing home placement).  
BRI Care Consultation has 3 main components: 1) Action Plan, 2) Initial - and Re -assessment, and 3) Ongoing 
monitoring.  
o Action Plan : The first priority , when patients and caregivers begin the program , is creating and 
implementing the Action Plan to address concerns identified by [CONTACT_8097]/or caregivers as most 
important to them.  With coaching from Care Consultants, the action plan is populated with simple, 
achievable Action Steps, each with an expe cted completion date and responsible person. Action steps 
should be feasible to accompl ish by [CONTACT_183255]; most are assigned to caregivers, 
patients, and Care Consultants. Care Consultants provide guidance on action -step content and new action 
steps are added to deal with changes in the illness, caregiving, and preferences of patients and caregivers .  
Needed adjustments and modifications to Action Steps  are regarded as opportunities for learning and 
reformulation.  As Action Steps cumulate, patients and caregivers move toward informing and/or finding 
solutions to identified problems.  
 
The initial action plan is mailed or emailed to patients and/or caregivers by [CONTACT_183256]. Updates are sent as action steps are added. The action plan is also sent to the PCP to be  
integrated into the larger medical or service records of the organization implementing the program.  
 
o Initial - and Re -assessment : Although patient - and caregiver -identified needs drive BRI Care Consultation, 
the initial - and re -assessments act as a safety net to ensure that Care Consultants discuss with patients 
and/or caregivers 39 common problems related to dementia. There are 23 potential problems for patients 
(e.g., coordinating and accessing services, medication management, getting and understanding the 
diagnosis), and 16 for caregivers (e.g., finding and accessing communit y services, care -related stra ins and 
depression). Single -item trigger questions are provided to Care Consultants and can be used to prompt 
discussion. The [ADDRESS_216513] touched upon in discussions with patients 
and/or caregivers sometime during the first four mon ths of enrollment and re -assessed at least every six 
months. More frequent re -assessment is recommended for persistent problems.  
 
o Ongoing Monitoring : A key feature that facilitates development of the long -term relationship between Care 
Consultants and patients/caregivers is monitoring activities, including scheduled follow -up contacts by [CONTACT_183257] b y their due dates. Depending on 
experiences with assigned Action Steps, follow -up contacts often are used to set new Action Steps 
representing next steps in the process of moving toward solutions. When there are no active Action Steps, 
ongoing monitoring is done by [CONTACT_183258] -scheduled check -in calls. The timing of 
these check -ins is set at the time of enrollment according to the program’s protocol. Check -in contacts can 
be brief when there are no new issues that pat ients and/or caregivers want to bring up. These contacts

** Also u sed to calculate time spent at home  
** Goal Attainment Scaling will be obtained only on a subset of caregivers  (i.e., it will not be performed in 
caregivers  in the  usual care  group  nor on all caregivers  in the two active intervention groups ; this will be 
completed by [CONTACT_183259] ( i.e., the Dementia Care Specialist  or Care Consultant  with goal setting 
occurring at baseline , and goal attainment scaling occurring 6 months [6 -12 months window]  and 18 months 
[15-18 months window] after enrollment )  
 
Self/caregiver -reported outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and [ADDRESS_216517] the baseline interview via telephone (e.g. , hearing impairment) 
or prefer an in -person visit, the option of conducting the baseline visit in -person will be provided but all baseline 
assessments must follow the telephone interview administration exactly. In-perso n research procedures will 
not commence until the clinical trial site provides CPM with written assurance of adhering to their local 
institution's COVID restrictions and a copy of their respective local policy/procedures. Because many persons 
with dementia become home bound and it is difficult for caregivers to leave the patients, all patient/caregiver 
outcomes will be collected over the telephone . All baseline and follow -up data collection will be co mpleted  by 
[CONTACT_183260]. At 59  months into the study ([ADDRESS_216518] been collected to ensure 
completeness), Medicare claims and Medicare Advantage utilization data will be requested for all time in the 
trial to assess long -term nursing home placement and calculate time (in days) spent at home. Utilization data 
for [ADDRESS_216519] 1 
month prior to the 18-month assessment  to participants in all three arms remind ing them that a study team 
member will call to  schedule their final (18-months) assessment.   
 
For participants enrolled in the active intervention arms, the interventions will continue until each participant 
has completed the final (18 -month) assessment.   
 
6.1.1  Primary Outcomes  
Because of the importance of both the patient and caregiver in dementia care, the primary outcome measures 
will be both the Severity scale  of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire  (NPI-Q)5 and the Modified 
Caregiver Strain Index  (MCSI).  The NPI -Q Severity is a validated survey that assesses the caregiver’s 
perception of the severity of 12 dementia -related psychiatric and behavioral symptoms . NPI-Q Severity score 
ranges from 0 -36 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. In a nursing home population, the 
minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was determined to be 2.[ADDRESS_216520] -EFFECTIVENESS OF DEMENTIA 
CARE/ COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF HEALTH SYSTEM -BASED VERSUS  COMMUNITY -BASED 
DEMENTIA CARE  
 
20 
 The NPI-Q Distress  scale is a validated survey that assesses the level of distress experienced by [CONTACT_3433] e caregiver 
in response to dementia -related psychiatric and behavioral symptoms . NPI -Q Distress score ranges from 0 -60 
with higher s cores indicating more severe  distress. In a nurs ing home population, the MCID  was determined to 
be 3.1 -4.0 points for distress .6 
Caregiver Self -Efficacy  is measured with a 4-item self-efficacy scale assessing the caregiver’s ability to 
manage dementia -related problems and ability to access help , including community resources.   
Patient Health Questionnaire -8 (PHQ -8)8 is a shortened version of the PHQ -9 (item 9 is omitted)  that is often 
used when the instrument is administered by [CONTACT_183261] . The 
PHQ -9 is 9-item validated tool used to assess depressive symptoms in the caregiver using the DSM -IV criteria 
for major depression and is scored from 0 -27 with scores >10 indicating moderate symptoms and scores >[ADDRESS_216521] on scoring and identical scoring  thresholds for depression severity can be used.  9 
6.1.3  Tertiary Outcomes  
Tertiary outcomes include cognition and functional status, long-term nursing home placement, goal attainment 
(a measure developed through a previous  PCORI Methodology grant), mortality, PCP and proxy ratings of care 
and satisfaction, quality of life in Alzheimer’s Disease, positive aspects of caregiving, and a new and novel 
outcome, time spent at home.10  
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA )[ADDRESS_216522] capacity to provide informed consent  (see 11.2 ). 
Functional status  will be measured using the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) measures functional 
status and ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating more functional dependence.15 We will also 
measure activities of daily living16 (Katz ADL) , which has been validated and is well-established in research 
and clinical use.  
 
Goal attainment scaling , developed through PCORI funding to the Principal Investigator, asks patients and 
caregivers to select their most important goal and assesses progress towards meeting it. These goals were 
identified in focus groups of caregivers and patients and additiona l goals were identified when integrating goal -
setting into clinical care in the PCORI Methodology study. An inventory of [ADDRESS_216523] been articulated.17 For this  study, we will use a shorter inventory designed to help 
caregivers consider categories of goals that may be important to them. Goal attainment , defined as whether a 
person’s individual goals are achieved as a result of the study intervention, will be measured using a 5 -point 
goal attainment scale (GAS). Usin g the SMART goal framework , GAS describes the person’s expected level of 
goal achievement over a specified timeframe, ranging from much worse than expected (scored as -2) to much 
better than expected (scored as +2). Scales are dynamically set according to a person’s needs, while 
measurement of attainment is standardized . The mean 6-month GAS score in a previous study of similar 
patients was 52.4  (SD 11.7)  on a 0 -100 scale  with a T -score of 50 indicating that on average the expected 
level of goal attainment was achieved . Measurement of goal attainment will be performed with caregivers by 
[CONTACT_183262] (Dementia  Care Specialists and Care Consultants), who are unblinded, 
and can be performed over the telephone.   
Conceptually, time spent at home  is a composite measure of control of dementia symptoms (e.g., problem 
behaviors), the ability of caregivers to cope with the disease, and the success of the health system in providing 
A PRAGMATIC TRIAL OF THE EFFECTIVENESS AND COST -EFFECTIVENESS OF DEMENTIA 
CARE/ COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF HEALTH SYSTEM -BASED VERSUS  COMMUNITY -BASED 
DEMENTIA CARE  
 
[ADDRESS_216524] 6 months of life but we will modify it to include each person’s total follow -up time spent after 
randomization that is spent at home. Total follow -up time will be determined from time of randomization to time 
of death, withdrawal (if CMS utilization data are allowed by [CONTACT_183263]), or to the end of the 
study for those who are administratively censored. Hence, the time  spent at home is:  
 
“Number of days since randomization (540) minus  (1) number of inpatient days spent at an acute care 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], inpatient rehabilitation facility, skill nursing facility, long -term care facility, or inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183209]) , 
and (2) n umber of days not alive ”. 
 
Caregiver Satisfaction  will be collected using a 11-item questionnaire  modified from the  UCLA ADC , which will 
be collected at 3, 12 , and 18 months.  
 
Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease  (QOL -AD)18 is a 13 -item (range 4 -52) instrument that can be 
administered to persons with dementia and caregivers.  It has demonstrated sensitivity to psychosocial 
intervention19 correlates with health -utility measures, is widely translated and used internationally and can be 
used by [CONTACT_183264]20. 
 
Positive Aspect s of Caregiving  (PAC) is measured with 11 items focusing on favorable aspects of the 
caregiving  experience,21 with range 0 -44 (most positive) and Cronbach’s alpha 0.92.22 The items ask about 
their mental or affective state related to their caregiving experience For example, providing help to care 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_183210] ‘made me feel more useful’, ‘made me feel strong and confident’, ‘given more meaning to my 
life’, ‘enabled me to d evelop a more positive attitude toward life’, and ‘enabled me to learn new skills’.  
 
Two additional tertiary outcomes will be examin ed that use measures described  above . 
 
Dementia Burden Scale -Caregiver (DBS -CG)23 is a composite of the NPI -Q Distress, MCSI, and PHQ -8 scales 
with items transformed linearly to be on a 0 -100 possible range and then averaged with higher scores 
indicating higher caregiver burden. The minimal clinically important difference ( MCID ) for the DBS -CG is 5 
points.   
 
Clinical benefit24- Measured patient symptoms using the NPI -Q severity scale (the only patient outcome 
anticipated to benefit from the program) and caregiver symptoms using the DBS -CG scale. Benefit on the NPI -
Q severity scale is defined as having a 1-year score of  < 6 (the lowest tertile of symptoms) or improving by [CONTACT_12697] 3 points, the MCID. DBS -CG benefit is defined as having a 1 -year score of  < 18.8 (the lowest tertile of 
symptoms) or improving by [CONTACT_97242] t 5 points, the MCID . Defining benefit in this manner allows us to capture 
both preventive (those who have few symptoms at baseline and do not deteriorate ) and therapeutic ( those who 
improv e) benefit from the program. We will then determine clinical benefit using 3 perspectives: patient benefit 
only, caregiver benefit only, patient or caregiver benefit.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_216525] baseline sociodemographic data , including zip code to determine rural/urban status,  to 
characterize the study population and for subgroup analyses. We will also ask caregivers about several 
personal health items including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183211] (e.g., missing appointments) 
because of caregiving demands as well  as items assessing  informal caregiving hours from the BRFSS 
Caregiver module.25 These data sources are well validated using the data collection approaches that the study 
will us e. As a measure of process of care, we will ask whether participant contact[CONTACT_183265]’s

 Physician Satisfaction  will be collected using a n 5-item questionnaire modified from the UCLA ADC , which will 
be linked to specific patients and conducted when the provider’s first enrolled patient completes the study.  The 
instrument will be revised so that the same survey can be administered to evaluate participants in all [ADDRESS_216527] fidelity measures (see above sections describing each intervention) that capture whether 
the interventions are being implemented as planned . In addition , at [ADDRESS_216528] 10 ACOVE and 
Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) quality indicators quality measures of dementia 
care that can be collected by [CONTACT_6270] -report including:

• Annual assessment of cognition  
• Annual assessment of function  
• Annual depression screening  
• Annual screening for dementia -related behavioral symptoms  
 
Domain: Counseling  
• Dementia prognosis  
• Community resources  
• Behavioral interventions for neuropsychiatric symptoms  
• Safety  
• Driving  
• Advance care planning or palliative care  
 
COVID -19 Measures for Caregivers  
To assess the potential impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on study participants , we will administer a 10 -
item questionnaire (modified from the Pain Management Collaboratory and National Alzheimer’s Coordinating 
Center questionnaires) evaluating how COVID -19 has affected caregivers’ emotional, physical, and social well -
being (e.g. car egiver distress, ability to care for person with dementia, social support) and care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ 
mental and emotional well -being over the past 3 months. The COVID -19 Measures f or Caregivers 
questionnaire is obtained over the telephone at the participants’  next scheduled outcomes assessment call,  
after the change has been approved by [CONTACT_1201], by a blinded assessor (e.g. the Research Assistant) . 
 
Finally, we will ascertain self -report (by [CONTACT_84452]) of serious adverse events (SAEs) of death and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183212] . 
 
7. STUDY PROCEDURES AND VISITS  
7.1  Randomization  
At the time of the in -person or telephone (after the start of the 2020 COVID -19 pandemic) baseline 
assessment, caregiver and, if the person with dementia is capable,  patient informed consent will be obtained . 
Upon successful completion of baseline measures , eligible persons will then be randomized to either HSDC or 
CBDC  or UC in a 7:7:1 ratio . The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_183266] a permuted block design with a 
fixed block size  of 15; using variable block sizes was not practical given the size of the block and the few 
numbers of participants to be enrolled in the usual care arm at each site . The randomization scheme will be 
computer -generated and the allocation sequence concealed.  Intervention ass ignment will be delivered by [CONTACT_183267]-based clinical trial management system. Because all of the care processe s employed in all arms  reflect 
A PRAGMATIC TRIAL OF THE EFFECTIVENESS AND COST -EFFECTIVENESS OF DEMENTIA

[ADDRESS_216529] of care, the consent will focus only on the collection of data. This approach is the same as that 
employed in the PCORI - and NIA -funded Strategies to Reduce Injuries and Develop confidence in Elders

8.2 Analysis of Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Outcomes  
8.2.1  Analysis of Primary Outcomes  
All analyses will be according to intent -to-treat or as -randomized. The analysis of the two primary outcomes – 
NPI-Q Severity and MCSI  scores – will be done using a constrained  longitudinal repeated measures analysis26 
based on maximum likelihood methods adjusted for the stratified randomization by [CONTACT_3725].  Treatment  differences, 
averaged over all follow -up time points , will be summarized by [CONTACT_183268] 97.5% confidence 
intervals.  Significance testing for each outcome  will be done by [CONTACT_112655]27 using an overall 
type I error of 2.5% (2-sided) to control for the 3 pairwise comparisons , i.e., testing each outcome at 2.5% will 
maintain the overall type I error at 5% (2 -sided) . This analysis will be implemented as a mixed methods 
repeated measures (MMRM) model which uses all available records under the assumption that visit -specific 
data are missing at random (MAR) .  Inclusion of the baseline 3, 6, 12, and [ADDRESS_216531] for the treatment by [CONTACT_183269] 10% 
significance level. If significant, we will also report treatment differences at each time point.  We will also

[ADDRESS_216532] them. Sensitivity 
analyses will investigate the MAR assumption, such as methods that jointly model missingness and outcome 
distributions (e.g., pattern mixture models ).28,[ADDRESS_216533] this hypothesis using the same longitudinal repeated measures 
analysis described for the primary outcomes at the 0.05 (2 -sided) level of significance uncorrected for 
multiplicity. The difference between giving any intervention and usual care  will be reported as least square 
means with 95% confidence intervals.  
Heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) for the primary outcomes will be assessed in six key subgroups of 
participants: high er vs. low er patient function  by [CONTACT_183270] , independent  vs. dependent  patient function by [CONTACT_183271] , 
more  vs less NPI-Q Severity,  more  vs less MCSI  at baseline, spouse caregiver vs. other caregiver , and white 
non-Latino v s. nonwhite or Latino . These subgroup analyses  are aimed at determining whether there is 
differential effectiveness of the interventions among patients with more and less severe disease, perhaps 
elucidating a preventive (if effect is greater among those with less severe disease) versus therapeutic (if  effect 
is greater among those with more severe disease)  effect . Similarly, the high vs low distress subgroup 
comparison will determine whether the intervention is more effective among those with more distress at 
baseline (a therapeutic benefit) versus less distress (a preventive benefit). Evidence of HTE will be based on 
tests of interaction within the l ongitudinal model structure described above. Because six tests of interaction will 
be conducted, we will use the Hochberg procedure to control for multiplicity using an overall type I error of 
2.5% (2 -sided)  for each outcome ; subgroup treatment differences  will be reported using 99% confidence 
intervals .  
 
Exploratory analyses to assess HTE for the primary outcomes will be also be conducted in demographic 
subgroups (e.g., age, race and ethnicity) as well as the effects of the COVID -19 pandemic and not adjusted for 
multiplicity.   
 
8.2.2  Analysis of Secondary Outcomes   
The analysis of the continuous secondary outcomes – NPI-Q Distress , caregiver depression  (PHQ -8), 
Caregiver self -efficacy – will be analyzed like the primary outcomes. The Hochberg procedure will be used to 
control for the testing of each  secondary outcome  using an overall type I error of 5% (2 -sided) ; treatment 
differences will be reported using 9 5% confidence intervals .  
8.2.3  Analysis of Tertiary Outcomes  
The analysis of tertiary outcomes will be considered exploratory and, thus, no control for multiplicity will be 
done. Continuous outcomes will be analyzed by [CONTACT_183272], time to event data by [CONTACT_183273], Negative Binomial, hurdle models or rank based methods depending on the 
distribution of the counts . Time spent at home is calculated as 540 minus (1) the number of days in a health 
care facility, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], nursing home, acute rehabilitation, and inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125], and (2) the number of 
days not alive . The analytical approach will depend on the distribution of the outcome  (e.g., skewed 
distributions will require rank -based methods.)

 collection ). This protocol will follow the intent -to-treat principle, requiring follow -up of all participants  
randomized regardless of the actual treatment received.[ADDRESS_216535] relatively few dropouts  (< 10%). Whenever a participant drops out of the study, we will 
document the specific reason for dropout, who decided that the participant would drop out, and whether the 
dropout involves some or all types of participation. For example, some participants may drop out of the 
patient /caregiver -reported outcomes but permit use of claims data to determine some secondary and tertiary 
outcomes.  
 
The follow -up period of [ADDRESS_216536] of deaths . Also, the timing and frequency of follow -up assessments at 
3, 6, 12, and 18 months was designed to minimize missing primary outcome data on participants by [CONTACT_183274].  
 
Because the study population has dementia, the primary source of data collection  (including primary and all 
secondary outcomes)  will be from caregivers. To minimize missing data, all follow -up data will be collected by 
[CONTACT_756], making it much easier, compared to in person visits, for participants (and caregivers) to complete 
the outcomes  assessments . Because most instruments, including the two primary outcome measures are self -
administered, we can also offer the options of collecting these data by [CONTACT_6791], se cure website, or secure email, 
which will also reduce the likelihood of missing data. We will also employ a risk -based approach to trial 
monitoring with timely data entry combined with weekly missing data reports that will trigger protocols for 
tracking an d obtaining missing data items or outcome assessments31 data.  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_183214], it is reasonable to assume missing data will occur. Our primary analysis is 
valid under the assumption that missing data is missing at random (MAR). Sensitivity analyses will investigate 
the MAR assumption, such as methods that jointly model missingness and outcome distributions (e.g., pattern 
mixture models ).29,31  . The results of these techniques to account for missing data will be incorporated  into the 
interpretation of findings and conclusions of the study.  
8.3 Sample Size  
8.3.1 Primary Outcomes   
The assumptions used to determine sample size for testing differences among the three treatment arms for the  
two primary outcomes were: 1) t ype I error 0.05/6 = 0.0083 adjusted for 3 treatment comparisons (HSDC vs. 
CBDC, HSDC vs. UC and CBDC vs. UC) times 2 primary outcomes, 2) standard deviation (SD) for NPI -Q 
severity of 6.5 units and SD for MCS I of 6.7 units, 3) treatment difference for HSDC vs. CBDC of  1.5 units, 4) 
treatment difference for HSDC and CBDC vs. UC = 3 and 5) lost to follow up over 18 months because of death 
and dropout of  25 %. The detec table treatment difference of 1.5 units for HSDC vs. CBDC is based on data 
reported in the literature suggesting a minimally clinical important difference (MCID) ranging from 2.[ADDRESS_216537] deviations (SD) for the 18 -month NPI -Q Severity score and MCSI are 6.5 and 6.7, 
respectively, based on UCLA pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299].  An 18 -month censoring rate of 25% was assumed because of death 
(15%) and dropout ( 10%). The death rate was taken from fee -for-service claims data on [ADDRESS_216538] 90% overall power for testing both outcomes. Testing each outcome 
at 95% power with a sample size of 1000 subjects per treatment group (adjusted for censoring) gives at least 
90% overall power for testing both outcomes. Given these sample sizes,  the sample size is 150 (for UC

CARE/ COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF HEALTH SYSTEM -BASED VERSUS  COMMUNITY -BASED

26 
 adjusted for censoring) for comparisons with the two interventions giving an overall power of at least 90% . For 
conservativism , we assumed the same effect size for both interventions compared with UC even though we 
hypothesize that HSDC will be superior to CBDC. The total sample size for the trial is 2150 individuals  
(adjusted for censoring).

censoring rate for analytical purposes is approximately 5% for the primary analysis (i.e., those without any 
primary outcome follow -up data).  
 
Heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) for the two primary outcomes will be assessed in six subgroups of 
participants: high vs. low patient function  by [CONTACT_183270] , high vs. low patient function by [CONTACT_183271] , high vs . low NPI -Q 
Severity, high vs low MCSI at baseline, spouse caregiver vs. other caregiver, and white non -Latino vs. 
nonwhite or Latino . The study will have approximately 90% power to detect interactions (differences in 
treatment effects between subgroup categories) of about 3 units for both NPI -Q severity an d MCSI for the 
HSDC vs. CBDC comparisons. Interactions on the order of 6 units can be detected with approximately 90% 
power for comparisons of HSBC and CBDC with UC for the two primary outcomes. These detectable 
interactions assume a conservative Bonferroni adjusted type I error of 0.05/(6x3x2) = 0.0014 to control for 
multiplicity. (In the analysis, we will conduct one global test of interaction per subgroup for 6 subgroups). Using 
an anchor -based approach that compares changes in NPI -Q measures with other clinical measures, the MCID 
for the severity scale is 3. 2.[ADDRESS_216540] clinically meaningful differences in subgroups for comparisons between the two interventions.  However, 
only large interactions can be detected for the comparisons with UC because of the smaller sample size in this 
arm. A lthough equal subgroup sample sizes were assumed in the calculations, power will not be greatly 
affected if the imbalance in subgroup sample size s is not more extreme than a ratio of 2:1.  
8.3.2  Secondary and Tertiary Outcomes   
For the three  secondary outcomes ( NPI-Q Distress , caregiver depression (PHQ -8), Caregiver self -efficacy ), we 
determined the detectable effect sizes assuming a Bonferroni adjusted type I error of 0.05/(3x3) = 0.[ADDRESS_216541] sizes with 90% power for the three  continuous measures (NPI-Q 
Distress , caregiver depression (PHQ -8), Caregiver self -efficacy ) are on the order of 0.20 for testing HSDC vs. 
CBDC . For testing HSDC /CBDC  vs. UC , there will be approximately 90% power to detect effect sizes on the 
order of 0.40.  Thus, we will have good power to detect small to moderate effects for the three  continuous 
outcomes.  
 
The goal attainment  scaling (GAS)  tertiary outcome will be collected only from caregivers  (in the two active 
intervention groups) enrolled through December 15th, 2020 . Goals will be set at baseline  and will be assessed 
at two follow -up time points: at 6 -12 months and 15 -18 months after enrollment. After considering the expected 
loss to follow up, we anticipate 80% power (appropriate for a tertiary outcome) to detect a 10% difference 
between HSDC and CBDC arms.

Power determinations for tertiary outcomes were not performed because these are considered exploratory. 
Sample size and power were calculated using Power and Sample Size (PASS) software (Kaysville, UT, 2013).  
8.[ADDRESS_216542] effectiveness ratio can be transformed into the clinical benefit gained (patient, caregiver) 
per $[ADDRESS_216543] calculated intervention costs and savings, we will compute 
return on investment = (cost savings – interventi on costs)/(intervention costs).  
 
We will use the Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF), Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) 
file, Outpatient file, Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183215], and Carrier file (non -institutional providers) to determine costs and utilization. 
The MBSF includes the base segmen t with beneficiary demographic information, date of death, and chronic 
conditions, and a costs and use segment with payment and utilization information. The costs will be computed 
as total Medicare payments across all services (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183216], acute i npatient, other inpatient, skilled 
nursing facility, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125], home health, Part B carrier, and durable medical equipment). The MedPAR files 
contain inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183217] (SNF) records for all Medicare beneficiaries, the outpatient  
files include claims submitted by [CONTACT_183275], and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183218]. For participants in MA or commercial health plans, we will use internal records of utilization, and 
compute costs using Medicare prices.   
 
Secondary analyses will be from a societal perspective and include costs to Medicaid and consumers as well 
as Medicare. Long -stay nursing home stays will be identified using place of service codes and Current 
Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for nursing facility services (from carrier and outpatient claims), and the 
absence of SNF claims in an initial month.[ADDRESS_216544] to use negative binomial 
regression to model utilization rates (i.e., count of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]). Negative  binomial regression will allow us 
to account for heterogeneity in  individual rates, repeated events within patients, and different months of 
available claims data for each patient.

 8.5 Safety  
Because this is a minimal risk trial, we will ascertain self -report (by [CONTACT_84452]) of SAEs of death and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183219], which will be monitored by [CONTACT_4318]. At the end of 
the follow -up, we will confirm any between -group differences in self-reported SAEs by [CONTACT_183276][INVESTIGATOR_183220] -obtained utilization data.  In addition , if a caregiver ’s, 
PHQ -8 score is >14, R esearch Assistants  will immediately (that day) notify the site’s clinical director (or 
covering physician) and this clinician can decide on next appropriate steps.   
 8.6 INTERIM MONITORING  
Interim monitoring will focus on safety, recruitment, adherence to protocol, baseline comparability of treatment 
groups, data quality , and uptake of the assigned intervention. A set of monitoring tables will be generated for 
this purpose.  Because this is a minimal r isk trial  and the follow -up period is relatively short (18 months),  no 
monitoring for efficacy or futility is being proposed.  
9. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
9.[ADDRESS_216545] operating 
procedures (SOPs) provided  jointly by [CONTACT_183277] (CPM) and  by [CONTACT_108214] (DCC). The primary mode of data collection will be directly onto electronic forms, through a device that 
is encrypted and secured according to site institutional standards for information security. The DCC will also 
provide equival ent paper forms, for use in situations where a suitably se cure, internet -connected device is 
unav ailable (e.g., a telephone  interview conducted after hours at home). Access to all data collection and data 
entry services will be through a study  portal website Patient dashboard, described below. Staff will be trained in 
the proper handling of paper forms (i.e., storage in secured participant jackets, no identifying information, all 
notations in permanent ink, all modifications initialed and dated in red ink).   
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_216546] of the DCC data management services will be organized and delivered through the D-CARE  Study Portal 
Website , a secure web tool that will be available to study staff. Role -based access to DCC services will require 
login through Yale's Central Authentication Service (CAS), using Yale Research Affiliate user accounts (netids) 
that will be issued to staff as requir ed. The portal website will be hosted by [CONTACT_183278] (ITS) and certified as HIPAA -compliant by [CONTACT_183279] (ISO). ISO will scan 
the portal website for vulnerabilities throughout the study period.  
9.1.2  REDCap  
All data collection systems and services will be based on REDCap, the CTSA -supported data management 
tool ( http://project -redcap.org ). While REDCap provides many essential features, its main strength is its open 
architecture and support for user -designed extensions ("plugins" and "hooks"). Many of the services described 
below are highly customized REDCap extensions that appear to the u ser as stand -alone web applications. 
Through these extensions, we can customize the interface of any REDCap -based web tool to match the 
workflow of the study activity.  
9.1.3  Site Management Services   
The portal website will be the means for disseminating site metrics  such as accrual progress; interviewer 
performance; error rates; error closure statistics; and other performance measures. Detailed reports will be

page. We will post relevant administrative forms on the study portal website , as well as important study 
documents such as the MOP, and study forms . 
9.1.[ADDRESS_216547] access to the REDCap -based data collection tools. Interview staff will be monitored on key 
performance factors such as refusal rate, data completion rate, adherence to rules for contac ting patients (e.g., 
at least one weekend, one evening attempt), adherence to interview windows, and metrics assessing the 
measurement of key outcomes. Staff will be re -trained as indicated by [CONTACT_183280].  
9.1.5 Data Quality Control

text responses, non -exhaustiv e choice sets) will be avoided.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Proactive Data Quality Control   
Comprehensive point -of-entry error checks will be built into the electronic forms. REDCap provides for range 
checks and branching logic enforcement and has limited support for higher -dimension data pattern actions. For 
example, branching logic may be defined based on da ta "pi[INVESTIGATOR_183222]" from other forms.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Batch Error Checks and Error Resolution    
Batch error processing is a necessary component of data quality control. It has been reported that batch data 
cleaning can reduce the median transcription data entry error rate by [CONTACT_183281] -fold.38 A substantial  
portion of D-CARE data will be entered via transcription  from paper forms (e.g., after hours  assessments) , so 
batch error checks problematic data patterns will be a vital component of the QC system . Finally, by [CONTACT_8345], 
real-time errors can be overridden by [CONTACT_183282] (e.g., a lab value outside the range allowed). These 
(apparent) errors must still be resolved.  
 
The D -CARE  tool for daily batch error detection, tracking and resolution will be a web -based tool under 
development by [CONTACT_183283] "Data Quality Control Query" (DQCQ) utility implemented in the 
SILVER -AMI study : http://medicine.yale.edu/intmed/geriatrics/silver_ami/about/ . DQCQ is a REDCap -based  
web tool that manages a database of error conditions detected by [CONTACT_183284] a standard DQCQ 
code (macro) library. All errors are viewable and tracked by [CONTACT_183285], and can be conditionally exposed to site 
staff for resolution. Site staff can cor rect most errors through "mini forms" rendered directly on the DQCQ

application is a modification of the software system, also developed by [CONTACT_79081]5LA, in use by [CONTACT_183286]. The workflow/task management software will be integrated with a REDCap -based electronic data 
capture module (EDC), following method s worked out for STRIDE.  
 
DCC will work with CPM and CTS’s to develop and maintain training standards for software and will provide 
means for accessing tutorial and training webinars.  The DCC, High5LA (the software vendor), and CPM will 
coordinate user supp ort efforts for the software.   
CBDC Management Services  The study will use existing BRI Care Consultation Information System software 
and releva nt data will be exported . This software tracks all contacts, action steps, assessment domains, direct

[CONTACT_183287], supervisors, and administrators that provide results f or these data in aggregate form, which 
can be exported as individual case -level data to statistical software for analy ses. 
9.2 The Data Mart   
DCC will maintain a read -only snapshot or "data mart" for use by [CONTACT_183288], batch error checks and study conduct reports. The data mart will be regenerated each night and will 
be in SAS format. The data mart will incl ude all assessment and outcome data, as well as fidelity measures 
from the HSDC and CBDC systems. Specific data mart snapshots used for DSMB reports, interim analyses, 
manuscripts and other specialized purposes will be permanently saved.  
10. SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1 Background  
This section describes the requirements and processes for reporting adverse events (AE), serious AE (SAE) 
and unanticipated problems to the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of record  and DSMB. It incorporates 
guidelines provided by [CONTACT_43398] (OHRP) of the Department of Health and 
Human Services (DHHS) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reporting requirements.  NIH is obligated to 
ensure that researchers comply with their approved reporting procedures.  Because this is a mini mal risk trial, 
we will ascertain self -report (by [CONTACT_84452]) of SAEs of death and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_183223], which will be monitored by [CONTACT_4318].  At the end of the follow -up, we will confirm any between -
group differences in SAEs by [CONTACT_183289][INVESTIGATOR_183220] -
obtained utilization data.  
10.2 Definitions  
Adverse Event:  Because 45 CFR 46 does not provide a specific definition for an adverse event (AE), the 
definition of an AE will conform to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) Guidelines. The same definition is used by [CONTACT_941] U.S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) except that 
A PRAGMATIC TRIAL OF THE EFFECTIVENESS AND COST -EFFECTIVENESS OF DEMENTIA 
CARE/ COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF HEALTH SYSTEM -BASED VERSUS  COMMUNITY -BASED 
DEMENTIA CARE  
 
31 
 “drug” is typi[INVESTIGATOR_183224] “intervention.” An AE is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an intervention and which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this  treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of an investigational  intervention, whether or not related to the intervention . 
Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE) : Any AE that : 
• Results in death;  
• Is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred ;  
• Requi res or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
• Causes persistent or signi ficant disability or incapacity;  
• Results in congen ital anomalies or birth defects;  
• Is another condition, which the i nvestigators judge to represent significant hazards . 
Unanticipated Problem : any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• unexpected, in terms of nature, severity, or frequency, given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the stu dy population;  
• related or possibly related to participation in the research ; in this guidance document, possibly related 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_183290] ;  
• suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized . 
Adverse Event Reporting Period : The study period during which adverse events must be reported is 
normally defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment 
follow -up. 
Preexisting Condition : A preexisting condition is one that is present at the time of providing the consent for 
the study.  A preexisting condition is considered an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of 
the condition worsens during the study period.  
10.3 Responsibilities  
Investigators conducting clinical research are responsible for:  
• Assurance that their procedures are conducted in compliance with these guidelines.  
• Creating a DSMP that describes the plans for adverse events, serious adverse events, and 
unanticipated problems commensurate with the nature and complexity of the study.  
- Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_183225]  
- Adherence to the DSMP with respect to timely submission of adverse events, serious adverse 
events,  and unanticipated problems .

[ADDRESS_216551] team regarding participants’ safety and continuation of the 
trial. The DSMB will include experts in dementia care (including investigators ), clinical trials and statistic s. 
General Description/Overview : This pragmatic trial differs from a typi[INVESTIGATOR_183226], controlled trial (RCT) in 
important ways. First, no experimental interventions are used. All interventions are standard of care and not 
research. Indeed, the consent form does not include language for  consent to an intervention, only for collecting 
data. Thus, the definitions of research and therefore AE, SAE, Unanticipated Problems and Pre -existing 
conditions do not apply to the intervention. However, this appraisal does not preclude the need to monitor the 
study and its impact on participant safety. There are no in-person study visits  other than the baseline s 
conducted prior to the 2020 COVID -19 pandemic ; the only data collection methodologies are questionnair es 
and examination of claims data. Therefore , our safety monitoring procedures focus on data collection via the 
methodologies available in the protocol design. Our plan is based upon the following principles :  
 
1) It is not feasible or necessary for participant safety to monitor AEs as the definitions above do not apply 
because the intervention is not research . 
2) Limited monitoring is justified for serious adverse events (SAEs)  as many of these will not occur in our study 
populat ion (e.g. congenital anomalies)  AND this is not a trial that has implications for FDA approval. Thus , only 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) need dictate the level of monitoring  in accordance with Federal Registry Title 21 .  
3) It is not necessary to assign monitored SAEs as “related” or “unrelated” to the study protocol because there 
is inherent bias in this assessment, attribution of “relatedness” would be a tremendous burden, and whether a 
difference in SAE burden is considered “related” or not, a significant difference between groups would be 
treated with similar concern by [CONTACT_4318] .  
4) Mechanisms for timely reporting after SAE ascertainment are important, but collective totals of monitored 
SAEs at assigned intervals will meet “timeliness” for the purposes of this study .  
5) The primary and secondary study outcomes will not require additional SAE reporting .  
10.5 Ascertainment of AE, Unanticipated Problems (UP), and SAE  
10.5.1 Adverse events   
As noted in 10.4, AEs will not be collected in this trial since  “any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the intervention ” will be 
occurring in the course of routine care, not research. Limited SAEs will be collected and reported as outlined in 
11.5.3.  
10.5.1  Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
Investigator institutions must have written procedures for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB and others as 
appropriate, of any Unanticipated Problem involving risks to study participants or others  (45 CFR 46.103(b)(5)).

11.2 Informed Consent  
The principles of informed consent are described in ICH guidelines for GCP (ICH E6[R1]). The ICH used by [CONTACT_183297]’s DSMB prior to submission to the IRB 
and Informed Consent . 
As noted previously in the screening procedures outlined above, potential participants  and their identified 
caregivers,  referred by [CONTACT_183298] . Informed 
consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_183299] . At the time of the COVID -[ADDRESS_216556] approval to obtain verbal consents from care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (who have the 
ability to consent), caregivers, and Legally Authorized Representatives (LAR)  using an electronic consent 
process (through RedCap) . In the event that the caregiver is not the LAR, verbal consent from the LAR will be 
obtained prior to the baseline interview being conducted.  
 
After consenting, they will receive  a general description of the study, including the baseline and surveillance 
evaluations, along with the study specific evaluations. The IRB agreed  that consent for the interventions is not 
considered necessary since these are facilitating standard of care in a consistent fashion, not providing an 
experimental intervention. Of course, data collection does require consent and thus will be the primary focus of 
the consenting process .  
 
Decisional capacity and proxy consent :  For all potential participants  who score 8 or higher on the short version 
of the MOCA , cognitive status will be assessed by [CONTACT_183300] 22-item telephone MOCA  prior to 
consenting  and those scoring < 16 will be considered incapable of consent ing for participating in the study and 
providing patient -reported outcomes .39 Those unable to consent will be asked for assent using the question 
“We would to ask your [caregiver relationship or name] some questions. Would that be ok?”   If the person with 
dementia says “no”, then the patient and caregiver will not be enrolled in the study. All caregivers will be 
consented for providing caregiver -reported outcomes and for obtaining caregiver utilization data (for spouses 
only).

CFR Part 46.114.  
As required by 45 CFR 46 Part E, all UCLA IRBs are registered with the federal Office for Human Research 
Protections.  The IRB that will review this study has appropriate membership, including the professional 
competence necessary to review the proposed re search.  
11.3.2 Authorization/Reliance Agreement  
The participating sites are all signatories to the SMART IRB agreement (NIH’s National Center for Advancing 
Translational Sciences (NCATS) Streamlined, Multi -site, Accelerated Resource for Trials (SMART) IRB 
Reliance Platform). This means that an agreement is already in place and related documentation (including 
joinder agreements and general standard operating procedures) is centrally available to all sites.  All sites also 
have access to the SMART IRB platform to properly document their acceptance of the arrangement for this 
particular proposal and track the status of the reliance.  The UCLA IRB office will download and maintain a 
local copy of such documentation.  
Any sites added after award will be expected to sign on to SMART IRB if they have not already done so.  If 
such sites are ineligible to sign on to SMART IRB, an appropriate agreement will be negotiated.

Director,  to: 
• Coordinate communications with r eliance  sites 
• Request and receive information and documentation from relying sites  
• Develop template materials for review by [CONTACT_183301]  
• Submit materials from all sites to the UCLA IRB and coordinate responses to any IRB queries  
• Provide documentation to relying sites  
Reliance  sites will follow local procedures to coordinate, collect and verify information such as:  
• Local context  
• Site variations in areas such as recruiting, informed consent, HIPAA, populations  
• Conflict of Interest disclosure and management  
• Completion of ancillary reviews  
• Training and qualifications of study team  
• Continuing Review or Closure information  
• Reportable Events  
Reliance  sites will provide necessary information or assurances to the UCLA study team for submission to the 
UCLA IRB.  The UCLA IRB office will communicate directly with the UCLA study team as the proxy for all 
relying sites.  
UCLA has dedicated reliance points of contact [CONTACT_183302].  Sections of UCLA’s web -based IRB 
system are designed for submissions, reviews and documentation related to relying sites.  When appropriate,

local IRB office or ancillary services require copi[INVESTIGATOR_183233]).  
11.[ADDRESS_216559]’s Study Advisory 
Committee and approved by [CONTACT_183303] s’ before it can be implemented.  
11.5 Risks to Human Subjects  
The risks associated with participation in the study intervention itself are deemed to be minimal because: 1) the 
interv ention  is aimed at maximizing participation in components of current standard of care; and 2) the 
intervention is being implemented by [CONTACT_183304][INVESTIGATOR_183234]. Our assessment of minimal risk does not, however, preclude the possibility that adverse events, and 
serious adverse events could occ ur. Therefore, a comprehensive data safety monitoring plan is outlined in the 
following sections. Authority for monitoring the safety of the protocol will reside in an independent DSMB 
responsible for holding the PIs accountable for data quality and completeness and assessing the ongoing 
safety of the trial participants through periodic meetings/review. Ongoing participant safety monitoring is the 
responsibility of site PIs who will report adverse events to the SD . The SD has the authority to directly report 
concerns to the DSMB if they arise . 
There are potential risks associated with data collec tion and information management  and, in fact, these risks 
are the major reason consent will be required in this trial. These include inadvertent disclosure of personal 
health information or research data collected. Every effort will be made to inform the participant  of this potential 
and minimize the risks as outlined below.  
11.5.[ADDRESS_216560] Risks  
Minimizing Risks : The study protocol will be implemented at each clinic only after the PI, and study 
coordinator have undergone rigorous  protocol training. The training and monitoring of performance in 
accordance with the Manual of Procedures for the study will be the  responsibility of the study PI  [INVESTIGATOR_183235] . All 
efforts will be made to minimize risks and participant inconvenience and mitigate interruptions of therapy. Risks 
will be minimized by: 1) adequate training of all staff with proficiency testing; 2) frequently encouraging 
participant questions throughout the interventions; and 4) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting and 
monitoring overall study safety by a DSMB  as outlined below . 
11.5.2  Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Participants  and Others  
There are a number of potential benefits of the study for the participants  including: 1) enhanced care by 
[CONTACT_183305] e of two effective  dementia care interventions, 2) receiving close monitoring of the participant 
during the trial , and 3) preventing or reducing caregiver stress and depression . 
There are also potential societal benefits from th e proposed research.  Optimizing models of care for providing 
effective comprehensive dementia care has the potential to greatly enhance patient care – including the 
potential to reduce morbidity both for the patient and caregiver as well as reduce costs.

 two evidence -based approaches to determine comparative effectiveness using a pragmatic design in clinical 
practice settings representing diverse geography and patient populations . 
11.6 Safety Monitoring Protocol  
Safety monitoring will be accomplished in accordance with the Safety Monitoring Plan included in the Manual 
of Procedures (MOP) to be approved by [CONTACT_4318] . 
11.7 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
As shown in Table 8, women are expected to constitute 67 % of the overall sample, consistent with higher life 
expectancy of women than men. Also, women are more likely to participate in clinical trials than men. Table 8 
also summarizes the racial and ethnic background of the potential participants at each of the 4 trial sites.

13. PUBLICATION AND DISSEMINATION POLICY  
The project PIs  in discussion with the Study Advisory  Committee will establish a Publication and Dissemination 
Committee, which will set the rules for publication of the data and authorship in conformity with PCORI policies.  
In accordance with PCORI’s legislative mandate on public dissemination, we will mak e the study’s findings 
available to clinicians, patients, and the general public not later than [ADDRESS_216563] important implications for public health and policy, requiring wide dissemination; 
additionally, several aspects of this trial’s approach and implementation will shape clinical practice and form 
the basis for dissemination a fter the trial. First, the screening methods will be built to interface with major EHR

[ADDRESS_216564], patient 
materials will be adapted and used in the program and will be exportable after the trial. Fourth, training 
materials and procedures will be available for propagating “train the trainer” programs . 
A Publication and Dissemination Committee (PDC) will be established to oversee the dissemination of the 
study’s findings. The PDC will include members of the National Patients and Stakeholders Council (NPSC ) and 
investigators with content expertise. This structure will allow the stakeholders and investigators to jointly 
address how to disseminate study findings to influence clinicians, patients, policy makers, c ommunities, CMS 
and other third -party payers. Also, local councils will work with investigators f rom the trial site to plan 
dissemination and implementation in local communities .  
Dissemination of study results will be accomplished through traditional routes (e.g. scientific meeting 
presentations, publications), but also through novel routes felt to be most effective by [CONTACT_183306] a recent 
roundtable . 
A particularly valuable asset for dissemination of this project is the Pepper Older  Americans Independence 
Centers, which  form a network of fourteen key academic institutions and thought leaders who are likely to be 
early ado pters of this program if proven effective. Three  other potential resources for dissemination will be the 
Health Care Systems Research Network (HCSRN), PCORI Patient Powered Research Network (PPRN) and 
the Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN).  
14. ORGANIZATIONAL FRAMEWORK OF AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS, 
PATIENTS, AND STAKEHOLDERS  
The research will have four major partners: Patients and Stakeholders, Clinical Trial Sites (CTS) Central 
Project Management (CPM), and the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and will be overseen by a Study 
Advisory Committee (SAC). The SAC will advise the study before it goes into the field and will monitor all 
progress to ensure that patient and other stakeholder views are continually integrated into the research.  The 
tasks and responsibilities of each of CPM, CTS, an d DCC are presented in Table 9.

investigators meet monthly during the planning year to monitor progress and provide additional input. The SAC 
meet s twice yearly in person . We plan to hold an investigators’ meeting once yearly.  
14.3 Integration of Patient and Stakeholders in the Trial’s Planning, Implementation, Analyses and 
Dissemination  
In accordance with the model set forth by [CONTACT_183308] ,40 patient engagement will occur at two levels – locally, at 
the clinical trial sites, and nationally, at the central project management level. To provide integration between 
the local and national patient and stake holder  councils, the local councils at t he [ADDRESS_216566] chosen  
representatives t o serve on the National Patient and Stakeholder  Council (NPSC).  
Year 1 will focus  on 1) development of local patient and stakeholder councils; 2) development of national 
patient and stakeholder council  (NPSC ); 3) training of investigators and stakeholders to work in partnership; 4) 
refining methods for eliciting patients’ and stakeholders’ voices, and 5) setting up structures to assure patients 
and stakeholders engagement with investigators to: (a) formulate t he final research questions; (b) finalize study 
design with attention to recruitment of participants, the planne d intervention, the comparators, and the 
outcomes; (c) monitor study’s progress and interim results; and (d) help disseminate the results of the study.

The NPSC is comprised  of 6 persons, 2 Co -chairs and a representative from each LPSC . The N PSC: 1) 
serve s in a consultative capacity to local councils and site PIs , various work group committees  and study 
leadership ; 2) integrate s the input from the 4 local councils and communicate s that to the trial’s PI  [INVESTIGATOR_183242]; and; 3) coordinate s activities  initially  for a) formulating the final research questions; b) finalizing 
study design; c) monitor s study progress, and suggest s changes  and edit s of all partic ipant -facing print 
materials  and d) provides recommendations for disseminating the results . 
14.3.[ADDRESS_216567]. The local councils  will meet 4 times a year during years 1 -4 and 
twice during year 5 . The NPSC will continue to meet month ly throughout the duration of the study . 
After  year 1, the local councils will focus  on refining their trial sites’ local resources that support screening and 
recruitment strategies, the intervention(s), assessment and  outcomes, and strategies for dis seminating  the 
trial’s findings. These local councils will provide recommendations to the NPSC and to site PIs  and continually 
support the local Dementia Care Specialist s and Care Consultants . The NPSC will collate the information from 
all local councils  and provide guidance to the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_183243] . 
14.3.5  Monitoring the study’s progress  
During recruitment, the Operations Committee will review the accrual of participants weekly and after 
recruitment, the collection of outcomes at its weekly meeting. The SAC and DSMB will also review the study’s 
progress. In addition, each committee will review progress of its responsibilities at the monthly meetings.    
14.3.[ADDRESS_216568] team will prepare a summary of findings that will be sent by [CONTACT_183309], including 
their caregivers. This summary will be reviewed and vetted by [CONTACT_183310]/Family 
Stakeholder Committees to ensure that the reading level, formatting, and content of the material are 
appropriate for the target group of participants. The project team has had experience providing updates of 
findings about improved dementia care through the UCLA ADC ne wsletters. This summary of f indings will be

 translated into Spanish and, if appropriate, adapted to suit the population of a specific region. In addition to an 
individual mailing to each participant/caregiver, this information will be conveyed through the project’s website.  
A Publication s Committee will be established to oversee the dissemination of the study findings. It will include 
members of the NPSC and investigators with content expertise. This structure will allow the stakeholders and 
investigators to jointly address 1) how to disseminate the study findings to impact clinicians, patients, policy 
makers, communities,  CMS and other payers; and 2) how study interventions can be scaled up for wider 
implementation. Also, LPSCs  will work with site investigators to plan dissem ination in their local communities. 
The patients and stakeholders can be effective particularly in influencing the policies of CMS and other payers, 
which can facilitate the adoption of the intervention. In addition to publications in scientific journals, the 
Publications Committee will plan presentations at scientific meetings, and orchestrate presentations to 
stakeholders, the media, payers, and policymakers.    
 
If HSDC proves to be superior, dissemination will be less of an issue for systems that serve high percentages 
of capi[INVESTIGATOR_183244] (i.e. Medicare Advantage), since the program would achieve cost savings if it is as 
effective as the original UCLA demonstration ($[ADDRESS_216569] savings, CMS unpubl ished data).  However, 
an initial upfront investment will be required. Work on disseminating HSDC, funded by [CONTACT_183311], will create business cases for adopting organizations to determine how soon they will be able to 
recapture their investment.  In addition, some healthcare systems that have strong cultures of team care may 
want to adapt the intervention by [CONTACT_183312] s, thereby [CONTACT_183313]. If major departures 
occur (e.g., substituting a BSN registered nurse for a nurse practitioner DCS ), then the model would need to be 
evaluated for fidelity to ensure that similar care is provided. In fee -for-service environments, under th e current 
reimbursement structure, HSBC would likely not generate revenue after costs of the intervention are 
considered. Nevertheless, there are new and emerging cost reimbursement mechanisms (e.g. [ZIP_CODE]  cognitive 
assessment code, Chronic Care Management) that can be used to offset significant costs. Other obstacles to 
disseminating HSDC include the lack of a trained workforce and the availability of nurse practitioners who can 
fill the Dementia Care Specialist  role. A grant under consideration by [CONTACT_183314]  A. Ha rtford foundation for their 
December [ADDRESS_216570] financial obstacles to implement this program. Nevertheless, if 
CBDC confers clinical advantages, other mechanisms through the Agency for Community Living (ACL) or new 
Medicare mechanisms might be created to support this program.  
If either HSDC or CBDC is superior, diffusion will need to be planned and an organization will need to assume 
responsibility for ensuring the fidelity within adopting health systems. Such an organization will need to be 
identified or created.

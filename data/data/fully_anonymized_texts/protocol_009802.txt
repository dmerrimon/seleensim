removed , along with the  
corresponding secondary 
objective “to evaluate the effects 
of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_673886] .” The endpoint has been removed to 
avoid redundancy, as the exploratory

treatment groups can be adequately 
assessed after 24 weeks of treatment; 
however, some stud y patients will

is approved.  
Modification of the treatment period 
will result in all patients who complete 
the treatment period being treated for 
a minimum of 24 weeks and a 
maximum of 52 weeks. This change 
will shorten the time to study 
completion while allowing for 
collection of endpoint data to evaluate

The purpose of this protocol amendment is to update the inclusion and exclusion criteria to address 
 for patients on an tifungal  therapy  and to allow a broader population to 
enroll that are still within the recognized International Society  for Human and Animal Mycology 
(ISHAM)  diagnostic criteria . Provisions were also added to protect patient safety and data integrity 
during the COVID -19 pandemic by [CONTACT_673995]/or outside of the clinic environment. Other changes were made for clarification and 
consistency. The following table outlines the changes made to the protocol and the rationale.  
Description of Change  Rationale  Section Changed  
Antifungal therapy related changes  
The inclusion and exclusion 
criteria were modified such that 
patients on antifungal therapy at 
screening may enroll in the study.  
Patients on oral antifungal 
therapy at baseline will be capped 
at 45% of the study population. 
Furthermore, randomization wil l 
now be stratified by [CONTACT_673996] 
(yes/no), in addition to the prior 
stratification criteria. The 
statistical analysis models for this 
study were updated accordingly.

• Revised Schedule of Events 
(SOE) to reduce in -clinic 
visits  and allow for study 
drug to be shipped to 
patients’ home . Removed 
sputum component of the 
optional immunophenotyp ing 
substudy. The exploratory 
endpoint examining sputum 
in this substudy was also 
removed.  To reduce the burden on 
patients and to protect patient 
safety and data integrity in

weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24. For patients who discontinu e study treatment prior 
to week 24, any off -study treatment pre -bronchodilator FEV1 values collected 
after the discontinuation of study treatment through week 24 will be included 
in the analysis. The MMRM model will include OCS use at screening, OAF

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 99 1. INTRODUCTION  
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a progressive, immunologic lung disease 
caused by [CONTACT_674001]  (A fumigatus ) that occurs in patients 
with asthma or cystic fibrosis (Agarwal, 2014 ). The prevalence of ABPA is estimated to be 1% to 
3% in patients with severe asthma referred for specialty care (Eaton, 2000 ) (Kurup, 2009 ). 
Clinically, asthma patients with ABPA have a more severe clinical course with poorly controlled 
asthma, poor response to treatment, and frequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_673917] . In addition, ABPA is often associated with thick mucoid 
secretions that can lead to obstruction of large and small airways, bronchiectasis (which does not 
otherwise occur in asthma), and lung function impair ment beyond that seen in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_673918] . A staging system is described for patients with asthma and ABPA to monitor disease 
progression clinically . Depending on the stage of the disease, clinical features in ABPA vary from 
mild asthma with occasi onal epi[INVESTIGATOR_673919], to patients with fibrosis, honeycomb 
lung, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (Patterson, 1982 ). Stage I is the initial acute stage of ABPA 
manifesting clinically with productive co ugh, wheeze, shortness of breath, fever, malaise, pleuritic 
chest pain, elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), peripheral and tissue eosinophilia, and 
fleeting pulmonary infiltrates on imaging studies . In stage II, the disease goes into remission for a 
variable period; symptoms are reduced, the lung infiltrates clear, and the serum IgE value declines . 
Stage  III is characterized by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_673920], 
production of thick sputum plugs, and an increase in serum total IgE levels that occur in up to 
24% to 50% of patients each year  (Agarwal, 2016 ) (Muthu, 2019 ). During epi[INVESTIGATOR_673921], thick brown mucoid sputum may contain A fumigatus  hyphae . Stage IV is reached 
when, despi[INVESTIGATOR_2391], the disease progresses to extensive mucoid impaction of airways  visible 
on chest x -ray or computed tomography (CT) imaging, lung function decline, and corticosteroid 
dependence . Stage V is the fibrotic stage . Unlike asthma, which does not progress to fibrotic lung 
disease, if the diagnosis is delayed or the disease is  undertreated, ABPA progresses to a fibrotic 
end-stage lung disease that can lead to pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_7518].  
The diagnosis of ABPA is based on clinical, serological, and radiological criteria . Diagnostic 
criteria fo r ABPA have evolved over the past several decades with an increased understanding of 
the disease, recognition of “severe asthma with fungal sensitization” as a distinct clinical entity, 
and improvement in serological testing . Diagnostic criteria for ABPA, modified in 2013 by [CONTACT_674002] (ISHAM) Working Group, are widely 
used clinically, wherein the items are broadly divided into ‘obligatory’ and other supportive 
criteria (Agarwal, 2013 ). The obligatory diagnostic criteria include the presence of a predisposing 
condition (asthma or cystic fibrosis), elevated serum  total IgE >1000 IU/mL, and evidence of 
sensitization to A fumigatus (either a positive immediate hypersensitivity skin test or elevated 
serum -specific IgE to A fumigatus ). Supportive criteria for the diagnosis include 2 of the 
following  3 criteria: 1) eosinophilia >500 cells/µL  in steroid naïve patients (may be historical);  2) 
serum precipi[INVESTIGATOR_673922] A fumigatus ; and 3) radiographic findings consistent with 
ABPA.

Clinical Study Protocol  R668 -ABPA -1923 Amendment 4 
 
REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 99 Approximately 20% to 30% of asthma patients are sensitized to A fumigatus  (Eaton, 2000 ) 
(Schwartz, 1978 ); however, only a small minority of these patients develop ABPA . In individuals 
who develop ABPA, exposure to fungal antigens results in immune deviation toward a robust 
type 2 inflammatory response with release of type 2 cytokines (eg, interleukin 4  or IL -4, IL -5, 
IL-9, IL -13); activation of mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils; and isotype switching of 
lymphocytes to IgE -producing B  lymphocytes and plasma cells (Knutsen, 2011 ) (Chauhan, 2000 ). 
Ultimately, this florid type 2 inflammatory response is deleterious, resulting in mucoid impaction 
of bronchi, bronchiectasis, eosinophilic inflammation, bronchocentric granulomatosis, and 
exudative or obliterative bronchiolitis . This type 2-skewed immune response is thought to be 
related to genetically determined risk factors . Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes 
(HLA‑DRB1*1501 and HLA ‑DRB1*1503) are associated with a high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_673923] 2 immune re sponses with continued synthesis of IgE upon exposure 
to A fumigatus  antigens (Chauhan, 2000 ). Conversely, HLA ‑DQ2 (HLA ‑DQB1*0201 in 
particular) is associated with a lower risk of ABPA (Chauhan, 2000 ). There are increasing numbers 
of reports of single nucleotide polymorphisms in host response genes (eg, polymorphisms in IL4R, 
IL13, IL10, TLR3, EEA1 ) found in ABPA patients, suggesting a panoply of underlying 
abnormalities in both adaptive and innate immunity (Knutsen, 2006a ) (Overton, 2018 ) 
(Overton,  2016 ). Gain -of-function variants in IL4R  are prevalent in atopic disease and lead to 
exaggerated synthesis of IgE antibodies and increases in the number of tissue mast cells 
(Hershey,  1997 ). Of note, a gain -of-function mutation in the extracellular coding region of IL4R  
(ile75val) was present in 80% of the ABPA patients in 1 study (Knutsen, 2006b ). Studies have 
shown that B  cells from patients with ABPA have higher sensitivity to IL ‑[ADDRESS_910786] A fumigatus  antigens 
(Hershey,  1997 ) (Knutsen, 1990 ).  
The current mainstay of treatment for ABPA is administration of systemic corticosteroids, with 
many patients becoming corticosteroid -dependent to control the disease . However, no t all patients 
respond to systemic corticosteroids . Long -term use of systemic corticosteroids is not 
recommended due to the lack of evidence supporting prevention of progressive bronchial 
destruction and the potential for serious side effects associated wi th chronic use . 
ABPA -complicating asthma does not respond clinically to conventional asthma therapy including 
high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) . Various antifungal agents (eg, itraconazole, 
voriconazole, ketoconazole, amphotericin B) are used as adjunctive treatments for ABPA in 
patients who respond poorly to corticosteroids in an effort to reduce the fungal antigenic stimulus 
(Agbetile, 2014 ) (Stevens, 2000 ) (Agarwal, 2018 ). However, clinical response to antifungals is 
variable, antifungal  therapy is not curative, and the side effects of antifungals - which include 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, rash, headache, and hepatotoxicity  ̶ limit their use . Long -term 
studies to evaluate the effect of treatment with these agents to modify the pr ogressive decline in 
lung function in ABPA are lacking.

3.1. Hypotheses  
Treatment with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_673938] ≥[ADDRESS_910789] da mage 
and parenchymal involvement, thus the known efficacy of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_673939] . In addition, all patients will be allowed to receive rescue 
treatment with systemic corticosteroids (standard of care) and antifungal therapy (widely though 
not universally used) as necessary and will be closely monitored throughout the study . The 
proposed treatment duration  of at least [ADDRESS_910790]  of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_673940] -
term changes in lung function; symptom control; rate of severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_22315]; 
; and pharmacodynamic  (PD)  effects on biomarkers of type [ADDRESS_910791] dose of the 
drug.   
The  primary endpoint is the absolute change from baseline in pre -bronchodilator forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_184849] 1 second (FEV1)  at week [ADDRESS_910792] 
of a drug on lung function . Lung function testing is useful in evaluating the progression of ABPA 
since decreased lung function is frequently associated with the disease. In a survey of 126 pat ients 
with ABPA, 85.7% had abnormal lung function  (Agarwal, 2006 ). Secondary  endpoints include :  
annualized rate  of severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_22315] ; ABPA -related exacerbations (in which serum 
IgE doubles compared to the closest pre-exacerbation  value); St.  George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6004] (SGRQ), a widely used, validated questionnaire to assess  the impact of the drug on 
HRQoL measures in chronic respi[INVESTIGATOR_3748]; and the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ -
5), a validated measure of asthma co ntrol . Systemic drug concentration/anti -drug antibodies 
(ADA) and biomarkers (serum total IgE, A fumigatus -specific IgE, 
 have been used previously in the 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_673941]/effect relationship and will help to better understand 
the mechanism of action of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_673942] -[ADDRESS_910793] in patients with ABPA.

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31 of 99 3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
The proposed dose for this study is dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg administered subcutaneously  (SC) every 
two weeks (Q2W) with a [ADDRESS_910794] an acceptable safety profile in adult and adolescent patients with 
moderate -to-severe asthma . In addition, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 3 00 mg every two weeks (Q2W) has shown a 
significant  while significantly reducing exacerbations and improving lung 
function in a population of corticosteroid -dependent patients with severe asthma . This dose 
regimen is approved in the treatment of patients with corticosteroid -dependent asthma . Severity of 
asthma in ABPA is generally greater  than in  asthma patients without  ABPA,  and many ABPA 
patients require treatment with chronic systemic corticosteroids . Therefore, to achieve the opti mal 
benefit -risk ratio in patients with ABPA, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg Q2W dosing regimen is selected for 
this study.  
3.3. Risk/Benefit  
Recognizing that the “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID -19) pandemic will have an impact on 
the conduct of clinical trials, the sponso r does not intend to screen any new patients in this study 
unless the impact of the COVID -[ADDRESS_910795] of trials at individual sites, and patients can safely participate in this study.  The 
sponsor plans to obtain approvals from health authorities/ethics committees to enable continuation 
of study sites for this study, as allowed by [CONTACT_10976].  
3.3.1.  Risk/Benefit for Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_673943] l type 2 -mediated immune disorders 
including AD, bronchial asthma, CRSwNP, and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).  
In adults and adolescents with moderate -to-severe uncontrolled asthma, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_673944] (FEV1), asthma control, and HRQoL in patients with a type 2 inflammatory signature [CONTACT_674031] a blood eosinophil count of ≥150 cells/µL or a fractional exhaled nitric oxide 
concentration of ≥25 parts  per billion (ppb) . In OCS -dependent patients with severe asthma, 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_673945] ~70% while at the same time reducing 
asthma exacerbations and improving FEV1 compared to placebo .  
Type [ADDRESS_910796] -hoc subgroup analysis from the completed dupi[INVESTIGATOR_73242] 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_673946]13579  (QUEST) in patients with moderate -to-severe asthma who met the suggested criteria 
for ABPA diagnosis at baseline . The results from a total of 30 patients (n=18 in the combined 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_125311] 12 in the combined placebo group) provide compelling clinic al evidence for 
the efficacy of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_673935]. Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_673947] 80% reduction in annualized severe exacerbation events and a 0.26L 
improvement in change from baseline to week 24 in pre -bronch odilator (BD) FEV1 . In clinical 
practice, serum total IgE, which is elevated in patients with ABPA, is monitored to assess ABPA 
disease activity . Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_673948] 70% from baseline over 
a 52-week treatment period. Overa ll, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_673949].  
                                        VV-RIM-00295189-1.0 Approved - 24 Mar 2023 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_910797] 
demonstrated a satisfactory safety profile . As of 28 March 2022  (data lock point of last  PBRER) , 
approximately 13,577 subjects were enrolled into the development program for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_673950]:  [ADDRESS_910798] udies, 468 from eosinophilic esophagitis 
studies, 275 from allergy studies, 1495 from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease studies, 309 
from prurigo nodularis studies, 311 from urticaria studies, 45 from bullous pemphigoid study, and 
37 from an allergic b ronchopulmonary aspergillosis study.  
Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24848] a favorable safety profile in clinical studies across all approved 
indications. The identified adverse drug reactions (ADR s) observed across  all indications are 
Injection Site Reactions (ISRs) , Sickness -like reaction/Serum Sickness and anaphylactic reaction. 
Though serious serum sickness and serum sickness -like reactions were observed rarely and only 
in AD clinical trials , and dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] -related anaphylactic reaction was observed rarely and only in 
an asthma clinical trial, they are considered ADRs across all indications as hypersensitivity is not 
expected to be indication specific. As protein therapeutics, all m onoclonal an tibodies  are 
potentially immunogenic. Systemic hypersensitivity is considered an important identified risk for 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458].  
Eosinophilia associated with clinical symptoms in asthma patients is an important potential risk, 
based on cases of eosinophilic granu lomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic pneumonia 
reported in asthma clinical trials (as well as in adult patients with co -morbid asthma in the 
CRSwNP development program). These events may usually, but not always, be associated with 
the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. A causal association between dupi[INVESTIGATOR_673951], Conjunctivitis, Conjunctivitis 
Allergic, Conjunctivitis Bacterial, Blepharitis, Dry Eye, Eye Pruritus, Herpes Simp lex (primarily 
mucocutaneous in nature), Eosinophilia and Oral Herpes were identified ADRs. The eye and 
herpes related ADRs appear to be predominantly AD indication specific. Conjunctivitis is also 
considered an ADR for the CRSwNP indication, although it o ccurred at a lower incidence in these 
studies than in AD studies. Most events were mild in intensity, transient in nature, and did not 
necessitate treatment discontinuation. Conjunctivitis and keratitis related events in AD patients are 
an important identi fied risk for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]. In the completed AD studies in children [ADDRESS_910799] marketing setting.  The program 
has a  data monitoring committee (DMC), whi ch will review the benefit/risk on a regular basis.  A

program, is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.

Approximately 60 patients will be enrolled in the study. The study consists of 3 study periods:  
• Screening p eriod (4 weeks)  
• Randomized treatment period ( 24- to 52 weeks)  
• Post-treatment follow -up period (12 weeks)  
This study employs a variable treatment duration from [ADDRESS_910801] ing the duration of the randomized treatment period, refer to 
Section  9.1.1 . 
Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized (1:1) to 1 of the following treatment 
groups:  
• Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg, after a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1, administered SC Q2W  
• Matching placebo, administered SC Q2W  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_11338] (pooled country), chronic systemic corticosteroid use 
(yes/no) at  screening , and by [CONTACT_674005] (yes/no) at screening.  
Rescue courses of systemic steroids for exacerbatio ns, as determined by [CONTACT_473], will be 
permitted during the study . Patients will be required to continue all background asthma controller 
medications (ICS) with or without long -acting beta agonist (LABA), leukotriene receptor 
antagonist (LTRA), or  long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA) without any changes 
in the dose or regimen during the study period . However, if 2 or more exacerbations occur during 
the treatment period, changes to background therapy ( eg, changes to background asthma co ntroller 
medication or init iation  of antifungal therapy) may be made at the investigator’s discretion.  
Patients on Chronic Oral Corticosteroids  at Baseline :

PATIENTS  
7.1. Number of Patients Planned  
Approximately 60 patients ( approximately 30 patients per  arm) will be enrolled globally.  
7.2. Study Population  
This study will enroll ABPA patients who meet modified ISHAM working group 2013 criteria for 
ABPA (Agarwal, 2013 ). These diagnostic criteria for ABPA are widely accepted clinically and 
broadly divided into ‘obligatory’ and  ‘other’ supportive criteria (Agarwal, 2013 ). 
The overall goals of treatment of ABPA include reduction of symptoms of ABPA, reducing 
pulmonary inflammation, and treatm ent of exacerbations to prevent progression of lung disease . 
Systemic corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment for ABPA, but toxicities limit their 
use. Approximately 25% to 35% of ABPA patients remain on long -term systemic steroids 
(corticoster oid-dependent) . Patients on chronic systemic corticosteroids with a stable dose of up 
to 10 mg/day of prednisolone (or its equivalent) or  up to  30 mg of prednisolone (or its  equivalent) 
every other day will be allowed to participate in the study to evaluat e treatment effects in patients 
with greater disease severity . Antifungal agents, especially triazoles, are prescribed as an adjuvant 
therapy in some cases . However, antifungal agents are not curative, their effects on preventing 
exacerbations are variable , and some of  the benefits associated with triazoles may be related to 
impairment of the metabolism of exogeneous corticosteroids by [CONTACT_674007] a direct 
antifungal effect . Therefore, to minimize confounding effects of these agents, randomizat ion will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_674008]  (yes/no)  at screening . 
Rescue courses of systemic steroids for exacerbations, as determined by [CONTACT_473], will be 
permitted during the study . However, to minimize confounding effects of changes in background 
asthma therapi[INVESTIGATOR_673965], changes to background asthma controller therapy 
(other than OCS use as described above) will not be permitted unless the patient has had [ADDRESS_910807]

made at the investigator’s discretion.  
Patients with post -bronchodilator airflow obstruction ( ) will be permitted

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 46 of 99 *Women of childbearing  potential are defined as women who are fertile, following 
menarche until becoming postmenopausal, unless permanently sterile . Permanent 
sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral 
oophorectomy.  
A postmenopausal state  is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause . A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal rep lacement therapy . However, in the absence of 12 months 
of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to determine the occurrence of 
a postmenopausal state . The above definitions are according to Clinical Trial Facilitation 
Group (CTFG) guidance.  
Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women with documented 
hysterectomy or tubal ligation.  
† Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining 
from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study 
drugs . The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration 
of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
‡ Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal 
(coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not 
acceptable methods of contraception . Female condom and male condom should not be 
used together.  
42. Any country -specific regulation that wou ld prevent the participant from entering the study  
NOTE: Patients  who do not meet the inclusion criteria or fail the exclusion criteria (eg due to 
a transient reason) may be rescreened once, after consultation with the medical monitor. 
Rescreened patients will be assigned a new patient ID versus the one received for the initial 
screening. There is no requirement for a waiting period between the screen -failure date and the 
rescreening.  
7.3. Premature Withdrawal from the Study  
A patient has the right to withdraw f rom the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.  
The investigator and/or sponsor have the right to withdraw a patient from the study if it is no longer 
in the interest of the patient to continue in the study, or if the patient’s continu ation in the study 
places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a patient does not or cannot follow study 
procedures) . An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal of patients shou ld be avoided.  
Patients who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked to complete the early 
termination visit, as described in Section  9.1.2 . 
Rules for discontinuation of study treatment (permanent or temporary) are discussed in 
Section  8.4.2 .

• Placebo -matching dupi[INVESTIGATOR_673973] (ie active substance, anti -IL-4Rα monoclonal Ab).  
Study drug will  be administered by [CONTACT_173874] . Subcutaneous injection sites of study drug 
should be alternated among the different quadrants of the abdomen (avoiding navel and waist 
areas), upper thighs, and upper arms so that the same site is not injected for [ADDRESS_910821] 3 months 
with a stable dose ≥[ADDRESS_910822] include ICS and may include  1 or more 
additional controller medications (eg, LABA, LTRA, LAMA) . Patients requiring a third controller 
are allowed to participate in this study . The third controller should also be used for at least 3 months 
with a stable dose  ≥1 month prior to  screening and between screening and baseline .  
Patients requiring systemic corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent) up to 10  mg per day, or up 
to 30 mg every other day, for ABPA are also permitted . Oral corticosteroid doses will be dow n-
titrated starting 4 weeks after randomization according to the schedule described in Appendix  A. 
Patients receiving oral antifungal therapy at baseline are permitted to enroll . For patients receiving 
antifungal therapy during the 24- to 52-week  treatment period, the dose and regimen should remain 
stable until the end of the treatment period. However, antifungal discontinuation or modification 
to the dose or regimen is permitted for the following reasons: side effects, intolerance, or lack of 
efficacy  (eg, acute exacerbation ) as determined by [CONTACT_093].   
Patients will be required to continue all background asthma controller medications (ICS) with or 
without long -acting beta agonist (LABA), leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), or long -acting 
muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA) without any changes in the dose or regimen during the 
study period.  However, if 2 or more exacerbations occur during the treatment period, changes to 
background therapy (eg, changes to background asthma controller medication or initiation of 
antifungal therapy) may be made at the investigator’s discretion.

Short -acting bronchodilators (SABA) are permitted as rescue therapy throughout the study . Rescue 
therapy with ICS and/or LABAs is not permitted.  
Systemic corticosteroids are allowed as rescue treatment for exacerbation . The need for rescue 
therapy and d osage will be determined by [CONTACT_6962] . For patients on chronic systemic 
corticosteroids, an increase in the dose of systemic steroids is allowed as rescue treatment.  
If 2 or more exacerbations occur during the treatment period, antifungal ther apy may be initiated  
(or the dose may be increased for patients on antifungal therapy) after consultation with the 
medical monitor  at the discretion of the investigator . 
Patients receiving rescue therapy permitted by [CONTACT_674010] . 
They will remain blinded and will be asked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits for 
the double -blind treatment period and the follow -up period, and participate in all assessments for 
these visits according to the Schedule of Eve nts specified in Table  1. 
8.4. Dose Modification and Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules  
8.4.1.  Dose Modification  
Study drug dose modification for an individual patient is not allowed.  
8.4.2.  Study Drug Discontinuation  
Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug should be encouraged to remain in the 
study . Those who agree and do not withdraw from the study  will be asked to return to the clinic 
for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule.  
Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug and who opt to withdraw from the study 
will be asked to complete study assessments, per Section  9.1.2 . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug dosing will be permanently stopped in the event of:  
• Evidence of pregnancy  
• Serious or severe allergic reactions considered related to study drug  
• Specific types of liver dysfunction (eg, Hy’s law is met ([Guidance for Industry Drug 
Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation FDA 2009])  
• Patient withdraws consent  
• If, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation in the study would be detrimen tal to the 
patient’s well -being  
• In the event of a critical protocol deviation, at the discretion of the investigator or the 
sponsor  
• At the specific request of the sponsor

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 50 of 99 • Diagnosis of a malignancy during study, excluding carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or  
squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin . Patient must be withdrawn for these latter 
malignancies if they cannot be adequately treated by [CONTACT_109413].  
• Any opportunistic infection or other infection whose nature or course may suggest an 
immunocompromised status  
• Severe laboratory abnormalities assessed as related to study drug:   
− Neutrophil count ≤0.5 × 103/μL 
− Platelet count ≤50 × 103/μL 
− ALT and/or AST values >3 × ULN with total bilirubin >2 × ULN, excluding 
confirmed Gilbert’s Syndrome  
− Confirmed AST and/or ALT >5 × ULN (for more than 2 weeks)  
Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter will be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation before making a decision of permanent discontinuation of study drug for the 
concerned patient . See Table  1 for information on  follow -up and any further evaluations 
that need to be completed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reasons for Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug dosi ng may be temporarily discontinued in the event of:  
• Severe laboratory abnormalities (as noted in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) where a causal 
relationship to study drug can be reasonably excluded, (ie, an alternative cause is 
evident):  study drug will be discontinued but may be resumed when the laboratory 
abnormality is sufficiently normalized . At minimum, the laboratory value(s) must 
return to a level that no longe r meets the specified criteria for discontinuation, as 
defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . A decision to resume study treatment will be made jointly 
by [CONTACT_173875].  
• Infections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment  
• Other intercurrent illness or adverse event or major surgery which could, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8574], present an unreasonable risk to the patient as a result of his/her 
continued use of the study drug   
After the condition leading to temporary discontinuation of study drug resolves, study drug dosing 
may resume . A decision to temporarily discontinue study drug and/or resume study drug dosing 
should b e discussed with the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. medical monitor . Re-initiation of 
treatment with the study drug will be done under close and appropriate clinical and/or laboratory 
monitoring once the investigator will have considered, according to his /her best medical judgment, 
that the AE is sufficiently resolved and unlikely to recur after resuming therapy with the study 
drug.  
The investigator may temporarily discontinue study drug dosing at any time, even without 
consultation with the medical monito r if the urgency of the situation requires immediate action 
and if this is determined to be in the patient’s best interest . However, the Regeneron medical 
                                        VV-RIM-00295189-1.0 Approved - 24 Mar 2023 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_910823] be recorded by [CONTACT_674011] (eCRF) . Following a temporary interruption or 
missed dose, the investigational medicinal product (IMP) treatment should be reinitiated at the 
next scheduled visit, maintaining  the original dose.  
If a patient requires a prohibited medication at any time during the study, the investigator should 
contact [CONTACT_674012] (except for illness requiring prompt treatment) . Based on 
the discussions, study drug may be conti nued or temporarily or permanently discontinued.  
8.5. Management of Acute Reactions  
8.5.1.  Systemic Injection Reactions  
Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of systemic reactions must be available 
for immediate use . All injection reactions must be rep orted as AEs (as defined in Section  10.2.1 ) 
and graded using the grading scales as instructed in Section  10.2.4 . 
Acute systemic reactions following  SC injection of study drug should be treated using clinical 
judgment to determine the appropriate response according to typi[INVESTIGATOR_24896].  
8.6. Method of Treatment Assignment  
Approximately 60 patients will be randomized at baseline/week 0/visit 2 in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg Q2W or placebo according to a central randomization scheme provided 
by [CONTACT_128124] s ystem (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS) to the 
designated study pharmacist (or qualified designee) . Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_11338] 
(pooled country), by [CONTACT_674013] (yes/no) at screening , and by [CONTACT_674014] l use (yes/no) at screening . 
8.7. Blinding

until after the database is locked for the respective study part.  
8.8. Emergency Unbli nding  
Unblinding of treatment assignment for a patient may be necessary due to a medical emergency or 
any other significant medical event (eg,  pregnancy) and when a treatment decision is contingent 
on knowing the patient’s treatment assignment . Study drug  will be discontinued for patients whose 
treatment has been unblinded/unmasked (Section  8.4.2 ). 
• If unblinding is required:  
− Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment.  
− Only the affected patients will be unblinded.  
− The designated study pharmacist(s)/designee at the study site will provide the 
treatment assignment to the investigator . If ther e is no study pharmacist, the 
investigator for the site will unblind/unmask the patient . Unblinding is performed 
using the IVRS/IWRS which will notify Regeneron .  
− The investigator will notify Regeneron and/or designee as soon as possible after 
unblinding t he patient.  
Treatment assignment is not to be provided to site personnel, other than the unblinded study 
pharmacist (when applicable), at any time during the conduct of the study, except in the case of a 
true emergency and when a treatment decision is cont ingent on knowing the patient’s treatment 
assignment . In the event that there is no study pharmacist, the individual at the site fulfilling that 
role will be the only unblinded member of the site personnel.  
8.9. Treatment Logistics and Accountability  
8.9.1.  Packaging,  Labeling, and Storage  
A medication numbering system will be used to label blinded investigational study drug . Lists 
linking medication numbers with product lot numbers will be maintained by [CONTACT_25006] (or 
companies) responsible for study drug packaging . In order to maintain the blind, these lists will 
not be accessible to individuals involved in study conduct.  
Study drug will be stored at the site at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC; storage instructions will be 
provided in the pharmacy manual.  
8.9.2.  Supply and Dispo sition of Treatments  
Study drug will be shipped at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC to the investigator or designee at regular 
intervals or as needed during the study . At specified time points during the study (eg, interim site 
monitoring visits), at the site close -out visit, and following drug reconciliation and documentation 
by [CONTACT_25007], all opened and unopened study drug will be destroyed or returned to the 
sponsor or designee.

visits, prior to spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] .  
St. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ)  
This questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_674019]  1 The 
SGRQ is a 50 -item questionnaire designed to measure and quantify health status in adult patients 
with chronic airflow limitatio n (Nelsen, 2017a ). 
A total score ranges from 0 to 100 . Scores by [CONTACT_674020]:  
Symptoms, Acti vity, and Impacts (Psychosocial ). Lower score indicates better QoL.  
The first part (Symptoms) evaluates symptomatology, including frequency and severity of cough, 
sputum production, wheeze, breathlessness, and the duration  and frequency of attacks of 
breat hlessness or wheeze.  
The second part has 2 components:  Activity and Impacts . The Activity section addresses 
disturbances to patients’ daily physical activities . The Impacts section covers a range of effects 
that chest troubles may have on patients’ daily  life and psychosocial functions (eg, daily life 
activities and functioning, employment, physical functioning, emotional impact, stigmatization, 
and patients’ perceptions when treated) . The recall period of the questionnaire is over the past 
4 weeks.  
Psychometric testing has demonstrated its repeatability, reliability, and validity . Sensitivity has 
been demonstrated in clinical trials  (Nelsen, 2017b ). A minimum change in score of 4 units was 
established as clinically relevant after patient and clinician testing . The SGRQ has been used in a 
range of disease groups including asthma, COPD, and bronchiectasis.   
Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ -5) 
The ACQ -[ADDRESS_910845] 5 questions, 
between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled) . A higher score indicat es lower asthma

vital signs observed at the time of informed consent should also be recorded as medical history . 
Any subsequent worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or intensity) of 
a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study d rug should also be 
recorded as an AE.  
At each visit, the investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred by [CONTACT_25040] . Adverse events may be directly observed, reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_25041] . Patients should be questioned in a general way, without 
asking about the occurrence of any specific symptoms . The investigator must assess all AEs to 
determine seriousness, severity, and causality, in accordance with the definitions in Se ction  10.2. 
The investigator’s assessment must be clearly documented in the site’s source documentation with 
the investigator’s signature . The investig ator should follow up on SAEs (and adverse events of 
special interest [AESIs]) until they have resolved or are considered clinically stable; AEs should 
be followed until they are resolved or last study visit, whichever comes first.  
Always report the diagno sis as the AE or SAE term . When a diagnosis is unavailable, report the 
primary sign or symptom as the AE or SAE term with additional details included in the narrative 
until the diagnosis becomes available . If the signs and symptoms are distinct and do not suggest a 
common diagnosis, report them as individual entries of AE or SAE .  
Laboratory results, vital signs, and other diagnostic result s or findings  should be appraised by [CONTACT_173901] . Isolated abnormal labor atory results, vital sign 
findings, or other diagnostic findings (ie, not part of a reported diagnosis) should be reported as

unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which  is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug (ICH 
E2A Guideline . Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, Oct 1994).  
10.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the inves tigator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event . This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869] . 
In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] (any duration) or an 
emergency room visit for longer than 24 hours . Prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24928] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24929], 
or is prolonged due to the development of a new AE as determined by [CONTACT_25043].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) .  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event . Important medical events may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other se rious outcomes listed above 
(eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse).  
Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events.  
10.2.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI (serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to the sponsor’s 
product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_674022] . Such an event might warrant further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand it. For a list of AESIs, see Section  10.1.3 .

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 75 of 99 10.2.4.  Severity  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  
Mild:  Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient’s normal functioning level . It 
may be an annoyance . Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptoms, but may 
be given because of personality of the patient.  
Moderate:   Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health . It is 
uncomfortable or an embarrassment . Treatme nt for symptom may be needed.  
Severe:   Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a definite hazard 
to the patient’s health . Treatment for symptom may be given and/or patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
If a laboratory value is considered an  AE, its severity should be based on the degree of

10.2.5.  Causality  
The investigator must provide causality assessment as to whether or not there is a reasonable 
possibility that  the drug caused the adverse event, based on evidence or facts, his/her clinical 
judgment, and the following definitions . The causality assessment must  be made based on the 
available information and can be updated as new information becomes available.  
For double -blinded studies using an active comparator, the investigator should consider all study 
drugs in determining event causality .  
The following factors should be considered when assessing causality:  
• Temporal relationship:  time to onset versus time drug  was administered  
• Nature of the reactions:  immediate versus long term  
• Clinical and pathological features of the events  
• Existing information about the drug and same class of drugs  
• Concomitant medications  
• Underlying and concurrent illnesses

11.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
The primary analyses of the study compare the treatment effect of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] [ADDRESS_910856] placebo on having a greater 
increase from baseline in pre -bronchodilator  FEV1  at week 24 are as follows:  
• Null hypothesis:  ΔDupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]  - ΔPbo = 0 
• Alternative hypothesis: ΔDupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]  - ΔPbo ≠ [ADDRESS_910857] to the primary efficacy endpoint of the absolute change from baseline in 
pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at week 24 . Assuming a 1:[ADDRESS_910858] deviation 
(SD) for the change from baseline in pre -bronchodilator FEV1 at week 24 of  in both 
groups, a 2 -sided Type 1 error of 0.05, and a dropout rate of  by [CONTACT_5875] 24, with approximately

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 80 of 99 11.4.3.  Primary Efficacy Analys is 
The absolute change from baseline in pre -broncho dilator  FEV1 at week 24 will be analyzed using 
a mixed -effects model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The vector of responses will 
consist of the absolute change from baseline in pre -bronchodilator  FEV1 at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 
24. For patients who  discontinue study treatment prior to week 24, any off -study treatment pre -
bronchodilator  FEV1 values collected after the discontinuation of study treatment through week 
24 will be included in the analysis. The MMRM model will include OCS use at screening,  OAF 
use at screening, region, age, sex, height, baseline eosinophil count, treatment, visit, treatment -by-
visit interaction, baseline pre-bronchodilator FEV1 value, and baseline pre-bronchodilator FEV1 
value -by-visit interaction as covariates . An unstructured  covariance matrix  will be used to model 
the correlations between repeated measurements. Parameters will be estimated using the restricted 
maximum likelihood (REML) method and the Newton -Raphson algorithm. Statistical inference

For the primary estimand of interest for the primary endpoint, the i ntercurrent events, strategies, 
and the corresponding missing data handling approaches are provided as below:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  Intercurrent event(s) handling 
strategies  Missing data handling 
approaches  
Change from baseline in 
pre-bronchodilator  FEV1 at 
week 24   The intercurrent events will be handled 
using  the treatment policy strategy  as 
follows:  
-        Taking rescue medications with 
systemic corticosteroids and/or oral 
antifungal drugs (including an 
increase in dose) for asthma or 
ABPA for any reason: all endpoint 
data collected after use  of rescue 
medication will be used in the 
analysis  
-        Taking prohibited medications: all 
endpoint data will be included in the 
analysis irrespective of use of 
prohibited medications  
-        Discontinu ing the study treatment: all 
endpoint data collected after 
discontinuation will be used in the 
analysis   Two types of missing data:  1) 
Patients discontinu ing from the 
study prior to  the analysis time 
point (week 24) will have missing 
data from  the time of 
discontinuation through week 24 ; 
2) Some intermittently missing 
data are expected because of 
occasionally missing a study visit 
while continuing with the 
randomized treatment  
Missing data handling:  for both 
types of missing data, the primary 
analysis MMRM model assumes 
that missing data are MAR, that is, 
that patients with missing data 
would have efficacy outcomes like 
those in similar patients in their 
treatment group who continue their 
randomized treatment through the 
time point at which data are 
missing

SCHEDULE DURING THE RANDOMIZED TREATMENT  
PERIOD FOR PATIENTS WHO ENTER THE STUDY ON 
OCS  AT BASELINE  
The OCS dose should be down -titrated during this phase following a predetermined schedule that 
is based upon the OCS dose patient was receiving at baseline visit (week 0) . During this period, 
patients will continue taking their background controller medication(s) (ICS +/ - LABA, LTRA, 
LAMA, theophylline, etc) w ithout any changes . The reduction in OCS dose should occur per the 
schedule unless the patient meets defined criteria indicating that it is not acceptable for the patient 
to reduce the dose . A clinical assessment should be completed prior to each dose redu ction . 
Primary reasons for not following the scheduled dose reduction include:  
1. FEV1 >15% reduction from the baseline value  
2. Need for rescue short -acting bronchodilator medication by [CONTACT_674028] 4 puffs/day (or 2 or more nebulized doses/day) above the 
mean baseline value for any 2 consecutive days in the prior week; or 12 puffs or more of a

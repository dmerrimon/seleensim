Protocol Summary 
Title:  The Vivaer® Procedure for Treatment of the Septal Swell Bodies  for 
Airway Obstruction  - A Prospective Open -Label Multicenter Study 
(SWELL)  
Purpose:  The purpose of this study  is to assess the clinical use of the Vivaer ARC 
Stylus to treat Septal Swell Bodies ( SSB) to improve symptoms in adults 
diagnosed with nasal obstruction attributed to SSB .  
Indications 
for Use:   The Vivaer ARC Stylus  is indicated for use in otorhinolaryngology 
(ENT) surgery for the coagulation of soft tissue in the nasal airway, to 
treat nasal airway obstruction (NAO) by [CONTACT_443364], 
including cartilage in the internal nasal valve area.  
The Aerin Conso le is an electrosurgical system intended to generate 
radiofrequency electrical current for the use of an Aerin Medical Stylus. The Aerin Console is indicated for use in small clinic, office or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143078]. 
Study 
Objective s: The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of treating 
the nasal septal swell body area with temperature -controlled 
radiofrequency (RF) using the Vivaer system for the treatment of NAO.  
The  secondary objective is to evaluat e the dur ability of the treatment 
effect in an extended follow -up period of 36 months. . 
Study Design:  The study is designed as a multicenter , prospective, open -label, single -
arm study. 
All participants will be evaluated prior to treatment and following 
treatment at week 1 and week 13 (3 months). The 3- month evaluation will 
be used for the primary endpoint analysis. 
The study will have an extended follow -up phase with evaluations 
conducted at 26 weeks (6 months), 52 weeks (12 months), 104 weeks (24 months) and 156 weeks (36 months) to provide additional information on longer- term efficacy and duration of treatment effect.  
A subset of study sites will be selected to participate in a substudy of the use of computed tomography (CT) imaging to assess changes in the SBB after treatment.  
Vivaer  
Treatment : The Vivaer procedure will be performed in the study clinic using the 
Vivaer ARC Stylus and Aerin Console. The Vivaer ARC Stylus is a 
disposable handheld device capable of delivering bipolar radiofrequency energy to t
issue when connected to the Aerin Console radiofrequency 
generating device. Participants will undergo bilateral treatment of the 
nasal airway in a single study procedure session. Each side of the nose will be treated as follows:  
  CTP1125 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – SWELL Study    
 
 Page 6 of 60 CONFIDENTIAL  
• Two (2) to six (6) nonoverlappi[INVESTIGATOR_882294].  
The default treatment settings will be used for the study: temperature 60 ° 
C, power 4 watts, treatment time 18 seconds, and cooling time 12 
seconds. No repeat (“touch up”) proc edures will be permitted after the 
initial procedure through the end of the study (36 months). 
 
Primary 
Endpoint:  The primary endpoint is improvement in self -reported Nasal Obstruction 
Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) Scale score from baseline recorded at the 
screening evaluation  to 13 weeks after the procedure.  
Secondary 
Endpoints:  • Responder percent: A responder is defined as at least 1 NOSE Scale 
class improvement or an improvement (decrease) in NOSE Scale 
score of 20% or more from  baseline to 13 weeks after the procedure.  
• Frequency of device -related and procedure -related serious adverse 
events , including frequency of septal perforation during the 
procedure, through the 3- month evaluation.  
Study 
Hypotheses  Primary hypothesis: mean improvement in NOSE Scale score from 
screening  to 13 weeks will exceed 25 points.  
Other hypothesis: the treatment effects will be maintained through the 
extended follow -up period of 36 months. 
Other 
Outcome 
Measures:  Adverse Events  - Incidence (type and category) of adverse events overall 
and by [CONTACT_6492]- up interval.  
Nasal Assessment  - The target  SSB within each nostril will be visually 
assessed at screening, prior to the procedure , immediately after the 
procedure, and [ADDRESS_1233983] 
Assessment  - A subset of study sites will be selected to participate in a 
substudy of the use of computed tomography (CT) imaging to assess 
changes in the SBB after treatment.  Radiographic c hanges, including 
change in size of the SSB, will be assessed using CT imaging prior to the procedure and at 3 months after the procedure.  
NOSE Scale Score:   
• Mean and mean change from screening at the 3 -, 6-, 12-, 24- and 
36-month follow -up evaluations. 
• Distribution of NOSE Scale score severity categories (mild, 
moderate, severe, extreme) at the 3 -, 6-, 12- , 24- and 36-month 
follow -up evaluations.

 Page [ADDRESS_1233989] o bstruction (NAO) is a highly prevalent disorder that affects the upper 
airway system causing restriction in normal airflow into the nasal cavity. Chronic nasal 
obstruction can elicit many symptoms, including congestion, stuffiness, headache, fatigue, sleep disturbance, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], snoring and impairment of various daily and social activities leading to an overall decline in health -related quality of life 
(QOL).
1-3 Given its high prevalence, treatment of  NAO can be costly, with 
expenditures for prescriptions, over -the-counter (OTC)  medications, and doctor’s 
visits.  
NAO  can be mediated  by a diversity of mucosal and structural disorders in the nasal 
cavity , including acute or chronic mucosal inflammation from infection, allergenic or  
non-allergenic irritants, or structural factors such as nasal masses or polyps, turbinate 
or septal swell body (SSB)  hypertrophy, nasal septal deviation, and nasal valve angle 
changes, narrowing or collapse.1,4-[ADDRESS_1233990] included both noninvasive management and surgical treatment with recent focus on treatment of the nasal valve region.  The nasal 
valve is defined by [CONTACT_882308], the anterior head of the inferior turbinate (IT ), and the caudal end of the upper lateral cartilage  (ULC) . This 
region is critic al in the development of nasal obstruction and represents the narrowest 
part of the nasal airway.
3,8-10 As described by [CONTACT_535418]’s law, minute changes in the 
diameter of a tube will result in exponential changes in airflow11. Thus, any narrowing 
in the nasal valve region, such as that associated with septal  deviation, turbinate 
hypertrophy, congestion of SSB , ULC collapse or insufficiency, nasal polyps, or 
structural changes after rhinoplasty, will change nasal breathing.[ADDRESS_1233991] commonly consists of repair of a deviated nasal septum and reduction of the IT . Surgical treatments may involve various suturing techniques used 
alone or in conjunction with grafting techniques using autologous cartilage typi[INVESTIGATOR_882297].
9,16-19 A new 
minimally invasive surgical procedure has also been introduced that uses an absorbable 
polymer  blend nasal implant to support the upper and lower cartilage inside the lateral 
nasal wall similar to more traditional cartilage and nonabsorbable polymer grafts.20 
Surgical treatments  are efficacious, but may require  significant recovery periods with 
complication  risks  such as bleeding, intranasal adhesions, scarring, infection, and graft 
migration, resorption or extrusion.16,19

Radiofrequency (RF)  energy has been used for decades in the fields of 
otorhinolaryngology (ENT), neurosurgery, cardiology, urology, and general surgery. 
ENT surgeons currently use radiofrequency energy in several nasal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Numerous studies have demonstrated that radiofrequency therapy applied to tissue of the nasal passage can be safe and effective in improving nasal obstruction while preserving nasal function.
21 Radiofrequency turbinate reduction (RFTR), for instance, 
is a minimally invasive surgical option that can reduce tissue volume in a precise, targeted manner.  This technique uses radiofrequency to create heat within the 
submucosal tissue of the turbinate, reducing tissue volume with minimal impact on surrounding tissues. Radiofrequency turbinate reduction differ s fundamentally from 
traditional surgical methods by [CONTACT_138532] -power radiofrequency energy to provide a 
relatively quick and painless treatment for tissue coagulation and/or ablation .
22,[ADDRESS_1233992] been multiple studies analyzing the safety and outcomes of RFTR treatment. A systematic literature review of the RF ablation technique concluded that the technique is well tolerated and effective.
24  
Targeted radiofrequency heating of the lateral cartilaginous nasal wall has also been used in patients with inspi[INVESTIGATOR_138506].  
25,26 The Seren procedure25 used 
an incisional  approached to apply RF heating to the target tissue with the intent to 
produce tissue retraction and volume reduction. Significant improvement in Nasal Obstruction Symptom E valuation (NOSE) Scale score was seen at [ADDRESS_1233993] pressure to the 
mucosa at  the region of the caudal  end of the weakened ULC to induce mechanical 
deformation and potentially change the shape of the lateral nasal wall . At 6 months , 
mean NOSE S cale score improved to 24.7 (SD 20.4, range 0- 90) with an average 
decrease of 54.5 (68.6%). I mprovement in mean NOSE S cale score was maintained 
through the 12-, 18-, and 24- month evaluations (27.6, 32.7, and 26.8, respectively).[ADDRESS_1233994] also been referred to as septal turbinate, nasal swell bodies, 
Kiesselbach’s ridge, septal body, and septal tumescence since first being described by [CONTACT_882309].
30 The SSB can be identified on rhinoscopy, endoscopy, and by [CONTACT_33456] ( CT) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI), appearing as a widened 
portion of the anterior nasal septum. The SSB  contains both glandular and vasoerectile 
tissues although the function of the SSB  is not well described.10 A study of MRI brain 
studies from 54 patients with nonsinonasal complaints provided measures of the 
average length, width, and height of the SSB  and further described them  as a normal 
2x3-cm fusiform structure located anterior to the middle turbinate (MT) and superior 
to the IT approximat ely 2.[ADDRESS_1233995] ed a role in nasal airflow regulation. The 
SSB has been found to be more prominent contralateral to a septal deviation32 and to 
be significantly larger among patients with allergic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis than in

control patients without those conditions.33 The SSB are known to swell in the presence 
of histamine.34 A decrease in the size of the anterior nasal septum after application of a 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_882298] d through MRI.35  Preliminary studies indicate 
that radiofrequency energy can be used to reduce swell body size.36,37 
2.0 Purpose   
The purpose of this study  is to assess the clinical use of the Vivaer ARC Stylus  to treat 
Septal Swell Bodies ( SSB) to improve symptoms in adults diagnosed with nasal 
obstruction.  
2.1 Device and Regulatory Status  The Vivaer  procedure will be performed in the study clinic  using the Vivaer ARC 
Stylus and Aerin Console . The Vivaer ARC Stylus  is a disposable handheld device 
capable of delivering bipolar radiofrequency energy to tissue when connected to the 
Aerin Console radiofrequency generating device  with temperature control capable of 
delivering very low doses of energy.  
The Vivaer ARC Stylus  was cleared for use in the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.) by [CONTACT_4469] (FDA ) under 510(k) K172529 and the Aerin Console was cleared 
under 510(k) K162810. 2.2 Indications for Use The Vivaer ARC Stylus  is indicated for use in otorhinolaryngology (ENT) surgery for 
the coagulation of soft tissue in the nasal airway, to treat nasal airway obstruction 
(NAO)  by [CONTACT_443364], including cartilage in the internal nasal valve 
area.  
The Aerin Console is an electrosurgical system intended to generate radiofrequency electrical current for the use of an Aerin Medical Stylus. The Aerin Console is indicated for use in small clinic, office,  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143078].  
2.[ADDRESS_1233996] varying degrees of effectiven ess, discomfort, and potential complications. There remains a significant 
need for a simple, safe, nonsurgical, minimally invasive treatment that can provide sustained relief for patients suffering with symptoms of NAO. The Viv aer procedure 
using RF technology has been shown to be safe, effective , and durable in a single -arm 
trial comparing pretreatment condition with posttreatment condition. This study is being undertaken to provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of the procedure when treating th e SSB  tissue.   
3.0 Device and Procedure Description  
The Vivaer ARC Stylus  (Figure 1) consists of a handle, shaft and treatment tip. An 
array of bipolar electrodes is positioned on a nonconductive tip ( Figure 2 ) that is 
attached to the handle via a nonconductive shaft. A temperature sensor is located on 
  CTP1125 Rev C

 Page 15 of 60  CONFIDENTIAL  
the Stylus tip to monitor tissue temperature during RF energy delivery. The Stylus is 
powered by [CONTACT_143118] -controlled radiofrequency generator via a flexible 
cable ( Figure 3 ). The Stylus incorporates features to allow compatibili ty with and 
authentication by [CONTACT_836773]. The connector for the Vivaer ARC Stylus  
has a pin configuration that prevents its use with other RF generators, making it only compatible with the Aerin Console. Authentication of the Stylus is achieved via a 
crypto chip that is built into the Stylus handle assembly. The chip is read and written to by [CONTACT_143120]. Information stored on the chip includes the Stylus model information, treatment parameters, usage timestamp data, and a count of the remaining treatment cycles (based upon preset maximum).

prior to use. The conductive media helps to ensure good contact [CONTACT_841776]. Application of the RF energy is controlled by a foot switch connected to the Aerin Console. The Vivaer ARC Stylus  
improves nasal breathing by [CONTACT_882310]. The low -power RF energy generates heat within the tissue 
and creates a coagulation lesion. As the lesion heals, the tissue retracts and stiffens, thereby [CONTACT_882311].  
The procedure requires local anesthesia only. The Stylus is manufactured and supplied 
sterile and for single use only by [CONTACT_882312].  
4.0 Study Objectives  
4.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of treating the nasal septal swell body area with temperature -controlled radiofrequency (RF) using the 
Vivaer system for the treatment of NAO.  
The primary objective will be assessed through evaluation of the primary endpoint, 
defined as change in mean participant NOSE Scale score at 3 months after the 
procedure, and the secondary endpoints of responder percent at 3 months and frequency of septal perforation, and other device -related and procedure -related 
seriou s adverse events through 3 months.

In addition to the primary and secondary endpoints, both the primary and secondary 
objectives will be supported by [CONTACT_882313] s afety 
measures that will include: 
• Adverse events  - Incidence (type and category) of adverse events overall 
and by [CONTACT_6492]- up interval.  
• Nasal Assessment  - The target  SSB within each nostril will be visually 
assessed at screening, prior to the procedure , immediately after the 
procedure, and 3 months after the procedure . The use of an endoscope for 
visual assessment is required.  Representative endoscopic video of each 
nasal passage will be captured for each assessment . Endoscopic n asal 
assessment will include assignment of an SSB grading score.36 
• CT Assessment  – A subset of study sites will be selected to participate in a 
substudy of the use of CT imaging to assess changes in the SBB after 
treatment. Radiographic changes, including change in size of the SSB , will 
be assessed using CT imaging prior to the procedure  and at 3 months  after 
the procedure. 
• NOSE Scale score:   
o Mean and mean change from screening at the 3 -, 6-, 12-, 24- and 
36-month follow -up evaluations. 
o Distribution of NOSE Scale score severity categories ( mild, 
moderate, severe, ext reme ) at the 3- , 6-, 12- , 24- and 36-month 
follow -up evaluations. 
o Mean, change from screening  in mean, and response distribution of 
the 5 components of the NOSE Scale score (nasal congestion, nasal blockage, trouble breathing, trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and getting enough air 
during exercise) at the 3 -, 6-, 12- , 24- and 36 -month follow -up 
evaluations. 
o Proportion of responders based on improvement in NOSE Scale score at the 3-, 6-, 12-, 24 - and 36-month follow-up evaluations.

difficulty assessed at screening  and the 3- , 6-, 12-, 24- and 36-month follow -
up evaluations. 
• Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT -22) - Participant -reported outcome 
measure for the prior 2 weeks of 22 symptoms related to both nasal and 
general health on a score of 0 (no problem) to 5 (problem as bad as it can 
be) and indicate  up to [ADDRESS_1233999] important items 
affecting their health. Scores range from 0 to 110, with higher numbers representing a significant problem for the participant.  
• Participant Satisfaction Assessment  - Five-question self -reported survey of 
satisfaction with the procedure and recommendation to others administered at the 3 -, 6-, 12-, 24- and 36- month follow -up evaluations. 
• Medications - M edication  used for relief or treatment of NAO symptoms 
will be documented at screening and updated as necessary with new 
associated medications at each postprocedure evaluation through the End of 
Study visit . An increase, decrease, no change, starting new or stoppage of 
medication use compared to the first recorded use will be documented.  
5.0 Study Plan

5.4.3 Nasal Obstructio n Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) Scale  
Evaluation of NAO is based on clinical observations of signs and symptoms 
with no easily obtained, reproducible objective measurement techniques of the 
airway .3 Poor correlation and uncertainty between more objective measures of 
nasal patency  (eg, nasal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_138507], acoustic rhinometry, 
rhinomanometry, CT scans, physician assessment of anatomy)  and 
participantive measures have generally been reported.38-[ADDRESS_1234008] important determinates of treatment outcome .
3,38,39 
To evaluate the significance of a participant’s nasal obstruction both before and 
after the procedure, this study will use the well -known p articipant-reported 
NOSE  Scale for determining the primary endpoint of the study. The NOSE 
Scale is a validated disease- specific health status instrument used by [CONTACT_882315].43 The 
NOSE Scale consists of 5 items,  each scored using a 5 -point Likert scale to 
make a total score range of 0 through 100, where higher scores indicate worse 
obstruction. Severity of symptoms can be classified as mild (range, 5 -25), 
moderate (range, 30- 50), severe (range, 55- 75), or extreme  (range, 80-100) 
nasal obstruction, based on responses to the NOSE Scale survey.44 
Treatment responder based on NOSE Scale score improvement: 
A responder is defined as 1 NOSE Scale class improvement (eg , going from a 
score in the severe range (55 -75) at preprocedure to a score in the moderate 
range (30 -50) at the 3 -month evaluation), or an improvement (decrease) in 
NOSE Scale score of 20% or more from screening at the 3 -month evaluation. 
5.4.4 Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Nasal Pain   
A horizontal 100 mm  VAS45 anchored on the left with the words “No Pain” and 
on the right with the words “Worst Pain Imaginable”, will be used to measure nasal pain associated with the procedure. Scores are obtained by [CONTACT_841774] (0) to the point indicated with a vertical slash placed by [CONTACT_882316]. 
5.4.5 Ease of Breathing  Through the Nose  – Numeric Rating  Scale (NRS) 
Breathing Score  
Participants will be asked to describe their perception of their ability to breathe 
through the nose over the past week on a NRS from 0 to 10 where 0 is defined as “No Difficulty Breathing” and 10 is defined as “Extreme Difficulty Breathing”.  
  CTP1125 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – SWELL Study    
 
 Page [ADDRESS_1234009] 22 (SNOT -22) 
The SNOT -22 is a disease- specific, 22 -item, participant -reported outcome 
measure of the prior 2 weeks of symptoms originally developed and validated 
specifically for rhinosinusitis46 that has also been described and used in the 
context of NAO.47,48 participants rate 22 different symptoms related to both 
nasal and general health on a 6- point Likert scale of no problem (0), very mild 
problem (1), mild or slight problem (2), moderate pro blem (3), severe problem 
(4), and problem as bad as it can be (5) and indicate up to [ADDRESS_1234010] important items affecting their health. Scores on the SNOT -22 are 
scaled from 0 to110, with higher numbers representing a significant proble m to 
a participant ’s life. Individual studies have consistently shown that SNOT -22 
scores improve after endoscopic sinus surgery in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with the minimal clinically important difference commonly considered to be a change of 8.9 points; however, the magnitude of changes across studies is quite variable.
49 
The SNOT -22 has also been shown to measure 5 underlying domains, each of 
which may be impacted differently depending on the therapy or intervention involved.
50. The domains are  3 sinus -specific symptom domains (Rhinologic, 
Extra -nasal rhinologic and Ear/Facial symptoms) and 2 general health -related 
QOL domains (Psychological and Sleep dysfunction). The domains are defined by [CONTACT_63790][INVESTIGATOR_882301] 22 total items: 
• Rhinologic symptoms - Items 1, 2, 3, 6, 21, 22 (0-30 score) 
• Extra -nasal rhinologic symptoms - Items 4, 5, 6 (0- 15 score)  
• Ear/Facial symptoms - Items 2, 7, 8, 9, 10 (0- 25 score)  
• Psychological dysfunction - Items 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 (0-35 score) 
• Sleep dysfunction - Items 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 (score 0-25). 
Reporting individual domain scores may help improve the sensitivity and usefulness of the SNOT -[ADDRESS_1234011] recorded use will be documented.

5.4.9 Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be documented according to Section 8.1. 
5.5 Success/ Failure Criteria  
Determinations of the overall success of treatment will be based on 2 levels: (1) the 
individual p articipant level and (2) the overall treatment success. Each level has its 
own criteria for success.  
5.5.1 Participant Success  
The primary outcome success measure for a participant  in this study is based 
on an improvement (decrease) in the NOSE Scale score after the procedure compared to the baseline ( screening ) score. The improvement must reflect  at 
least one category improvement or ≥
 20% decrease in score at the 3 -month 
evaluation for the participant  to be considered a success (responder).  A 
participant  will be considered a nonresponder (failure) at the 3 -month 
evaluation if neither success criterion has been attained.  
5.5.2 Study Succ ess 
The study will be considered a success if the mean improvement in NOSE Scale score from baseline ( screening ) to [ADDRESS_1234012] been 
appropriately delegated and documented. Roles may include : 
• Investigator/Treating  Physician - The Investigator/T reatin g Physician  will 
perform the procedure and postprocedure assessments. The treating physician  
must be a medical doctor with experience in ENT procedures and trained on 
study procedures, including the administration of the Vivaer  procedure for 
treatment of SSB . 
• Oversight of participant -reported outcomes and other data collection – 
Medical or office staff with relevant knowledge and experience as determined by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_882302]- reported outcome s.

5.8 Risk/Benefit Analysis  
5.8.1 Risks  
Potential risks associated with the use of the Vivaer ARC Stylus do not differ 
from commonly used devices and treatments for nasal obstruction and snoring, but due to the nonsurgical nature of the therapy, small treatment area, low energy delivery, and lack of need for general anesthesia, the overall risk to the participant may be less than presented by [CONTACT_882317], septoplasty, or functional rhinoplasty. 
Potential risks associated with the use of the Vivaer ARC Stylus  and the 
associated local anesthetics are listed below. participants will be monitored 
closely as part of this study to allow for early detection of potential problems and prompt treatment if required.  
Anticipated adverse events or side effects that may occur as a result of the 
treatment include :  
• Infection  
• Bleeding (other than during the treatment at treatment sites and greater 
than anticipated by [CONTACT_093])  
• Mucosal changes  
• Scar formation leading to nasal obstruction  
• External deformity  
• Sensory changes at treatment site   
• Bruising including around the orbital area (black eyes) 
Anticipated observations that are expected in and around the treatment area and 
are considered minor include: 
• Inflammation / generalized redness  
• Temporary swelling, edema  
• Blanching (generalized whiteness)  
• Temporary numbness/tingling  
• Temporary soreness/pain 
• Mild bleeding at anesthetic injection and/or treatment site (not requiring physician-level intervention, such as cautery) 
• Temporary nasal obstruction from tissue edema  
• Disruption of mucosal flow/intranasal crusting  
• Scab formation 
  CTP1125 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – SWELL Study    
 
 Page 26 of 60  CONFIDENTIAL  
These observations will be assessed in the nasal assessment and recorded at 
study visits if they occur. Should any of the events above  require mitigation by 
[CONTACT_836776], they will be considered an adverse event and will be recorded on the study Adverse Event Report electronic case report forms (eCRF) . 
Symptomatic improvements may not be achieved in all participants receiving the Vivaer procedure and may not be durable beyond the 3 -month evaluation in 
all participants who achieved relief at 3 months.  
5.8.2 Potential Risks to Participant Confidentiality  
In all clinical studies, confidentiality of protected health information may be breached due to study- related activities beyond those of routine clinical care. 
This risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_841780]’s eCRF. Risks to participant confidentiality are further minimized by [CONTACT_882318]. The 21 CRF Part 11 compliant and validated system maintains audi t trails 
on all entries, changes or corrections to eCRFs. If a person with authority to complete but not sign eCRFs makes changes to an already signed eCRF, the investigator will be required to resign the eCRF, thereby [CONTACT_841782].  
5.8.3 Mitigation of Risks  
The study was developed based on previous preclinical and clinical experience and includes a number of steps to minimize any additional risks to participants in the study: 
• Preclinical mechanical and bench evaluations have been conducted to demonstrate that  the design characteristics of the study device are 
appropriate for reliable clinical use of the device.  
• The Vivaer ARC Stylus  and Console have been cleared for use by [CONTACT_882319] -marked in the European Union. 
• The study will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_154630](s) and conducted according to applicable regulations with 
ongoing review by [CONTACT_1201]. 
• Careful consideration has been given to the inclus ion/exclusion criteria 
in order to select appropriate candidates for treatment.  
• Participants  will be fully informed of the study requirements prior to 
enrollment.  
• Only physicians with experience in nasal surgical and minimally 
invasive procedures, and with  specific training using the Vivaer ARC 
  CTP1125 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – SWELL Study    
 
 Page 27 of 60  CONFIDENTIAL  
Stylus for performing the Vivaer  procedure will be permitted  to 
participate in the study. 
• Study procedures, f ollow -up, and study monitoring are  designed to 
identify and closely manage adverse events in a timely manner.  
5.8.[ADDRESS_1234013] using low doses of RF energy. The low -power RF energy generates heat within 
the tissue and creates a coagulation lesion. As the lesion heals, the tissue retracts and stiffens, thereby [CONTACT_882311]. In addition to 
symptom relief after correcting nasal obstruction, participants may also experience better sleep function and better psychological function. (eg, concentration, productivity, and frustration). These benefits may last beyond the length of the study.

Preparation  (preprocedure)  
The treatment will be performed in the study clinic within 30 days of study entry. 
The participant will be seated and positioned in the exam chair according to personal 
comfort and study physician’s preference (eg, upright, reclined or supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). A nasal assessment ( visual and endoscopic exam) will be performed on each side of the nose 
and for each nostril, including endoscopic video. This is to assess the configuration of the structural components of the lateral nasal wall (including the upper and lower lateral cartilage, their junction and the overlying mucosa), location of SSB and the MT to allow the study physician to map out and plan the areas of treatment. If the 
Screening and Treatment visits occur on the same day, the nasal assessme nt does not 
need to be repeated for P reprocedure.  
Following the nasal assessment, it is recommended t he study physician prepare the 
treatment area with a topi[INVESTIGATOR_270004] (eg, lidocaine, t etracaine, etc .) and 
applying via spray, gel, or saturated pledget placed within the nose. After an 
appropriate amount of time, the SSB is then visualized with an endoscope and 
infiltrated in a submucosal plane with a small amount of local anesthetic to provide adequate tissue analgesia as well as tumescence to fac ilitate radiofrequency energy 
transfer. For example, cottonoid pledgets saturated with 4% lidocaine are placed in 
the nasal passages adjacent to the septum; after 5 minutes, these pledgets are removed and the swell body is injected bilaterally with 0.4 cc of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,[ADDRESS_1234017] been anesthetized , participants will undergo bilateral 
treatment of the SSB in a single study procedure session. Each side of the nose will be treated as follows  
• A nasal speculum is inserted into the nostril and opened to visualize the treatment area. The Vivaer ARC Stylus  will then be inserted to access the 
treatment area. The Stylus will be connected to the Aerin Console generator and the RF en ergy level will be set on the generator. 
• Two (2) to  six (6) nonoverlappi[INVESTIGATOR_882303].  
• For the SSB, Vivaer ARC stylus default settings will be employed. ( Figure 4).

activated, signifying that energy is being delivered through the Stylus . The tone stops 
when the pedal is released , and RF energy is no longer being delivered.  
No repeat ("touch- up") procedures will be permitted during the study follow-up 
period. Additionally, for the purposes of this study, no other  concomitant treatments 
are permitted during this treatment or the follow -up period. 
Procedure data collection  
Data  relating to the procedure and the products used will be recorded on the Study 
Procedure e CRF . The following information  will be recorded:  
• Date of procedure. 
• Procedure and postprocedure medications ( including anesthesia).  
• Aerin Console serial number. 
• Procedure start and end times.  
• Aerin Console settings.  
• Treatment duration  and number  of sites treated for SSB . 
• Occurrence of device malfunctions, protocol deviations, and/or adverse events.

6.5 Postprocedure Assessments and Care  
Immediately postprocedure, a nasal assessment ( visual and endoscopic exam ) for 
each nostril including endoscopic video will be conducted prior to discharging the 
participant and reported on the Study Procedure eCRF.   
Participants will be asked to indicate the pain level experienced during the study 
procedure from anesthesia delivery to procedure completion using the VAS pain 
score instrument on the Pain VAS CRF.  
At the discretion of the study physician, the following care may be provided and 
should be documented: 
• Use of nasal saline spray and antibiotic ointment 2 to 3 times daily for 1 week . 
• The participant should be instructed not to manipulate the treatment site ( i.e., 
no nose blowing) for 24 hours with the exception of any necessary hemostasis.  
• Remind participant to continue to hold all anticoagulants for [ADDRESS_1234019] study follow -up visit (1 week +/ - 3 days) 
scheduled within the visit window prior to release. 
Participants should not receive other concomitant nasal treatment therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (other 
than those specified above) or interventions after the procedure through the 36-month 
follow -up to avoid confounding the evaluation of the effect of the treatment, unless 
the additional care is in response to an adverse event or is considered in the best interest of the participant. Should a treatment or procedure be in the best interest of 
the participant, it must be documented in the source.  The participant will remain in 
the study and be followed through 36 months. Concomitant nasal treatments will be monitored at follow -up evaluations.   
6.6 Follow- up Evaluations  and Study Exit  
Follow- up visit dates wil l be calculated from the study procedure date (Day 0). 
Follow- up visits should be scheduled within the specified visit windows described in 
the Schedule of Events (Section 6.1) and Table 1 (Section 9.3.2). An in- office follow -
up evaluation is scheduled for  1 week and 13 weeks (3 months) after the procedure. 
In addition, follow -up evaluations at 26 weeks (6 months), 52 weeks (12 months), 
104 weeks (24 months) and 156 weeks (36 months) after the treatment procedure will be conducted remotely as a telephone assessment by [CONTACT_8786]. The timing of all follow -up evaluations is based on the date of the procedure and should not be altered 
based on the actual time of preceding follow -up visits. Participants who make non-
study visits should be evaluated for possi ble adverse events and an Adverse Event 
Report eCRF should be submitted if appropriate.  
All participants should be followed through the final follow -up evaluation at 156 
weeks (36 months) postprocedure regardless of their earlier success/failure classification. Every effort should be made to avoid having participants withdraw 
  CTP1125 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – SWELL Study    
 
 Page 35 of 60  CONFIDENTIAL  
from the study (Section 10.6). If a participant does choose to withdraw from the 
study, it is very important to record information regarding the reason(s) and the last 
known status of the participant.  
The following assessments will be conducted as indicated for each follow -up time 
points and recorded on the Follow- up V isit e CRF:  
In-office evaluation  - 1 Week:

• Participant Satisfaction Survey (completed by [CONTACT_3445]).  
• Adverse events. 
Remote  evaluations - 6- month (26 Weeks), 12-month (52- Week s), 24-month (104-
Weeks) and 36- month (156- Weeks) follow-up: 
• Current use and participant -reported change in use of medication, and other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_882304] p articipant -reported changes 
in frequency of use. 
• NOSE  Scale score (verbal administration by [CONTACT_8786]). 
• NRS ease of breathing score (verbal administration by [CONTACT_8786]). 
• SNOT -22 (verbal administration by [CONTACT_8786]).

7.0 Statistical Considerations  
7.1 Study Design 
This is a prospective, m ulticenter, open -label, single -arm study to assess the Vivaer 
procedure for treatment of SSB to improve symptoms in those diagnosed with NAO.  
This study is designed to assess improvement in symptoms from prior to the 
procedure to a primary endpoint at 3 months after the procedure and out to 36 months. 
  CTP1125 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – SWELL Study    
 
 Page 37 of 60  CONFIDENTIAL  
7.2 Study Hypotheses  
The primary endpoint hypothesis for the primary study objective is designed to 
demonstrate that the mean improvement in participant NOSE Scale score from the baseline assessment  at screening  to 13 weeks exceeds 25 points. Note that 
improvement is represented by a decrease in NOSE score. The null hypothesis (H
0) 
is that the decrease in mean NOSE Scale score will be less than 25 points and the alternative hypotheses (H
1) is that the decrease will be more than 25 points:  
H0: µd ≥ −25.0 
H1: µd < −25.0,  
where µ d represents the mean change in NOSE Scale score from baseline to 13 weeks  
(13-week  NOSE Scale score −  baseline NOSE Scale score ). Rejection of the null 
hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis  (H1) means that there is evidence for 
a statistically significant reduction in mean NOSE Scale score from baseline to 13 
weeks postprocedure. 
The secondary endpoint hypothesis for the primary study objective is designed to 
show that the proportion (percent) of participants meeting  the responder definition 
will exceed 0.55 (55%) at 13 weeks. The null hypothesis (H 0) is that the proportion 
of responders will be equal to .55 (55%) and the alternative hypotheses (H 1) is that 
the proportion of responders will exceed 0.55 (55%): 
H0: p0 = 0.55  
H1: p > 0.55,  
where p0 represents the targeted minimum responder proportion at [ADDRESS_1234021] the null hypothesis for both the primary effectiveness endpoint and for the principal secondary endpoint. 
The statistical power (1 – β) for the primary effectiveness endpoint that , on avera ge, 
there is  at least a 25-point improvement in the NOSE Scale score from the 
pretreatment  assessment to the assessment at 13 weeks:  
Statistical Hypothesis:  H 0: µd > -25.0 versus H 1: µd < -25.0 
where µ d is the average change from screening (baseline) 
in the NOSE Scale score at [ADDRESS_1234022] treatment  
Statistical Methodology:  Single- sample paired t -test 
Expected µ d: -[ADDRESS_1234023] Deviation: 20 Significance Level:  One-sided α = .025 
  CTP1125 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – SWELL Study    
 
 Page 38 of 60  CONFIDENTIAL  
Minimum Sample Size:  70 Participants  
Statistical Power:  0.99 
The statistical power (1 – β) for the secondary endpoint is such that at least 55% of 
the treated participants respond to treatment, defined as either at least one NOSE 
Scale class improvement, or at least a 20% improvement in the NOSE Scale score, 
both assessed  at 13 weeks posttreatment : 
Statistical Hypothesis:  H 0: π < 0.55 versus H 1: π > 0.55 
where π is the proportion of participants responding to 
treatment 13 weeks posttreatment  
Statistical Methodology:  Single- sample chi-square test  
Expected π: 0.80 
Significance Level:  One-sided α = .025 
Minimum Sample Size:  70 Participants  
Statistical Power:  0.[ADDRESS_1234024] 70 treated participants, we can be 95% confident that we will observe 
at least one unexpected serious device- related event when the underlying incidence 
of that event is at least 2.3%.  
It is anticipated that participants will be enrolled at sites on a competitive basis; 
however, a reasonable balance of participants among sites may be maintained by [CONTACT_143135][INVESTIGATOR_882305].  
7.[ADDRESS_1234025] reached the primary endpoint at 13 -weeks (3 -month) postprocedure. The primary and secondary 
endpoints will be analyzed using the data from the primary evaluation phase for an 
interim study report when these data become available. Informational outcomes will be analyzed and may be included in interim reports after all participants have reached each of the successive follow -up time points. A final study report will be provided 
after all participants have reached the final [ADDRESS_1234026]  to all safety analyses. All  enrolled participants undergoing the 
procedure ( initiation of an esthesia ) represent the evaluable study population. For 
some evaluations, summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_882322]. The per -protocol 
population is defined as all p articipants who received treatment, with 13 -week (3 -
month) follow -up data and no major protocol deviations.

examined by [CONTACT_882323].  
Other  outcome measures will be analyzed by [CONTACT_143136]. 
7.7 Pooling  
All study data will be pooled across study sites to facilitate h ypothesis testing in 
accordance with the sample size estimation and power analysis (Section 7.3). 
Comparability between study sites may be shown using summary statistics calculated 
by [CONTACT_3725].

the mean change with associated 1-sided lower confidence bound. 
7.11 Secondary Endpoint  Analysis 
The s econdary endpoint hypothesis will be tested only after the primary endpoint of 
the study is met.  The secondary hypothesis  will be evaluated using the proportion of 
responders on the primary outcome measure  at 13 weeks. A responder is  defined as 
having improvement in NOSE Scale score of ≥ 20% from  baseline or at least one  
NOSE Scale class improvement.  
The hypothesis will  be tested at the 1- sided alpha .[ADDRESS_1234029]. The responder proportion (percent) will be presented with the 
associated  95% confidence interval.  The secondary endpoint will be met if the lower 
bound of the confidence interval exceeds 0.55 (55%). 
The frequency (p roportion) of septal perforation  will be calculated along with the 
95% confidence interval along with a summary of each event.

distribution of SSB  grades prior to the procedure and at each follow -up will 
be summarized along with the mean scores and change from screening . 
• Radiographic Imaging  - A subset of  study sites will be selected to 
participate in a substudy of the use of CT  imaging to assess changes in the 
SBB after treatment. SSB  measures from CT scans will be summarized and 
presented as means at screening and at 3 months and as the mean change 
from screening to 3 months.  
• NOSE Scale score  - Categorical responses and scores on the NOSE Scale 
and its individual components will be subject  to multiple summary methods

8.1.1 Definitions  
Following are definitions associa ted with AEs: 
Adverse Event - any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal  laboratory or  image 
findings) in participants, users or other persons, whether or not related to the 
investigational medical device and whether anticipated or unanticipated (per ISO [ZIP_CODE]) 
Note: This definition includes events related to the investigational medical 
device or the comparator . This definition also includes events related to the 
procedures involved. For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to 
events related to the use of investigational medical devices.   
  CTP1125 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – SWELL Study    
 
 Page 43 of 60  CONFIDENTIAL  
Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  - an adverse event that led to any of the following 
(per ISO [ZIP_CODE]) 
a) death, 
b) serious deterioration in the health of the p articipant, users or other 
persons as defined by [CONTACT_10980]:  
1) a life -threatening illness or injury,  or 
2) a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function 
including chronic disease, or  
3) in-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or 
4) medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening 
illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or 
a body function, 
c) fetal distress, feta l death, or a congenital abnormality, or birth defect 
including physical or mental impairment. 
Note : Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition, or a procedure 
required by [CONTACT_760], without serious deterioration in health, is not considered a serious adverse event.  
Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  – adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device.  
Note : This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use , deployment , implantation, installation, or 
operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device. This 
definition also includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device. This includes  comparator if the 
comparator is a medical device  
Serious Adverse D evice  Effect (SADE)  – an adverse device effect that has 
resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event  
(per ISO [ZIP_CODE]). 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect ( UADE)  - any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the inve stigational plan 
or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of participants (21 CFR 812.3(s)). 
Relationship to device an d procedure 
The potential relationship of the event to the device or procedure  will be 
categorized by [CONTACT_3470]: 
  CTP1125 Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol – SWELL Study    
 
 Page 44 of 60  CONFIDENTIAL  
• Not related  
An adverse event for which sufficient information exists to indicate that 
there is no causal connection between t he event and the device or 
procedure. The adverse event is due to and readily explained by [CONTACT_2416]’s underlying disease state or is due to concomitant 
medication or therapy not related to the use of the device or the procedure. In addition, the adverse event may not follow a reasonable temporal sequence following the procedure.  
• Unlikely  
The relationship with the use of the device or procedure seems not relevant and/or the adverse event can be reasonably explained by 
[CONTACT_5748], but additional information may be obtained.  
• Possibly related  
There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been primarily caused by [CONTACT_239060]. The adverse event has a 
reasonable temporal relationship to the use of the device or the procedure and follows a known or expected response pattern to the device or procedure, but alterna tive etiology is equally or more likely 
compared to the potential relationship to the use of the device or the 
procedure. 
• Probably related 
There is a reasonable probability that the adverse event may have been primarily caused by [CONTACT_41491]. T he adverse event has a 
reasonable temporal relationship to the use of the device or the procedure and follows a known or expected response pattern to the device or procedure , and an alternative etiology is unlikely or 
significantly less likely . 
• Definitely related  
The adverse event has a strong causal relationship to the device or procedure. The adverse event follows a strong temporal relationship to the use of the device or the procedure, follows a known response pattern to the device or procedure, and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_143140]’s clinical state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Every effort should be made to determine the cause of each adverse event, because a judgment must be made as to the relationship to the device or procedure. If an investigator cannot assign a causality category the event will 
be considered possibly related for reporting and analysis.

frequency, would not be considered procedure- or device- related.  
Intensity of adverse events :  
• Mild  
The adverse event is noticeable to the participant but does not interfere with routine activity.  
• Moderate  
The adverse event interferes with routine activity but responds to symptomatic therapy or rest. 
• Severe  
The adverse event significantly limits the p articipant's ability to perform

• Causality (in relation to the device or procedure) 
• Unexpectedness  
Signs and symptoms considered normal postprocedure  recovery (eg,

Withdrawal of subjects  
Subjects will be withdrawn from the study and receive appropriate treatment for hyperkalemia (at the 
Investigator’s discretion), if the serum potassium  level exceeds 7 mEq/L  during Week [ADDRESS_888348] 
sample is confirmed by a second sample exceeding 7 mEq/L at an unscheduled visit within one week.  
Concomitant medications :   
Subjects are not allowed to receive potassium binders during the study (e.g. sodium polystyrene sulfonate, or 
SPS) except in emergency situations.  
Except for those listed in the exclusion criteria, all medications (prescription or over -the-counter) that have 
been started prior to screening may be continued during the course of the study.  
Statistical analysis :   
This is a proof -of-concept study, to determine the extent to which administration of patiromer has the potential 
to change the risk category for ESRD patients who are on conventional HD schedules.  In addition, the study 
aims to develop and test study procedures and instruments that will be implemented in a large- scale clinical 
trial.  
By [CONTACT_658589], the power of the trial will be limited.  The proposed primary endpoint is the between- group differences of the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], per subject, of serum K ≥ 5.5 mEq/L during Weeks 3 
and 4.  This will be assessed as follows:  Six serum samples will be collected and assessed for each patient during the efficacy phase (Weeks 3 and 4).  Patients would receive a score of perfect K control  (6 of 6 samples 
in range;  Score 1.0), moderate K control  (5 of 6 in range; Score 0.83), inconsistent K control  (4 of 6 in range; 
Score 0.67) , erratic K control  (3 of 6 in range; Score 0.50), poor K control  (2 of 6 in range; Score 0.33), very 
poor K control  (1 of 6 in range; Score 0.17), or no K control  (0 of 6 in range, Score 0).  These s cores will then 
be averaged for the patients in the active treatment group and the control group, and the results will be 
compared.  Using this approach, a sample size of n=20 per group provides 86% power to detect a between-
group difference of 2 in mean epi[INVESTIGATOR_658574], assuming α=0.[ADDRESS_888349] of adverse events, vital signs, ECG -parameters, clinical laboratory 
parameters and physical examination. Adverse Events will be summarized in an incidence table and coded to MedDRA.  Laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECG -parameters will be summarized; the changes in the 
hematology, biochemistry parameters and vital signs from baseline will also be presented.   Serious Adverse 
Events (SAE’s) will be reported on a jointly developed form with Relypsa.  
Efficacy Variables  
Efficac y parameters will consist of serum levels of potassium, collected prior to scheduled dialysis treatments .

3.  Introduction and Study Rationale  
 3.1 Problem of hyperkalemia  
Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) who are treated with conventional hemodialysis (HD) schedules 
often exhibit life- threatening,  epi[INVESTIGATOR_658575].  Reduced kidney function increases extracellular 
potassium concentration due to the combined effects of a net positive potassium balance in concert with disturbed ion distribution in the body fluid compartments  
1  2  In the HD population, scheduled measurement of 
serum potassium concentration is typi[INVESTIGATOR_658576] a month.  Even with this restricted 
testing schedule, serum potassium exceeds 5 mEq/L in more than a third of patients   3,4.  However, epi[INVESTIGATOR_658577], since many of these transient events are 
not captured with standard treatment and testing schedules.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_658578].  It is plausible that epi[INVESTIGATOR_658579], by [CONTACT_658590] 5,[ADDRESS_888350] that 40- 50% of HD patients who exhibit serum potassium concentrations > 5.5 mEq/L during 
routine measurements in one month will fail to be “cured” the following month with usual clinical care (unpublished data) .  One dilemma that arises is that reducing serum potassium with the use of low dialysate 
potassium is actually associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death  
5.  Furthermore, HD patients 
already carry a high pi[INVESTIGATOR_13551], and it is unclear if prescription of an additional oral medication will reduce the frequency of epi[INVESTIGATOR_658575] 
7.  Even though the manner of achieving this ideal is unclear, these 
observations suggest that avoiding extremes in the concentrations of serum potassium will improve the cardiovascular risk in HD patients.  
High serum potassium contributes to cardiac risk . Maintaining  serum potassium homeostasis is critical to 
create a stable transmem brane potential of about - [ADDRESS_888351] , the ability to maintain potassium 
balance by [CONTACT_658591], and therefore acceptable potassium conditions can only be approximated 
by [CONTACT_658592] .  In a  patient maintained on a conventional, three-
times -per-week HD regimen, potassium intake is recommended to be limited to about 60 mEq/day (420 
mEq/week ).  Dialysis removal typi[INVESTIGATOR_658580] 70- 100 mEq per treatment (210- 300 mEq/week for thrice-
weekly schedules)2.  Assuming that native kidney function accomplishes minimal potassium clearance, to 
maintain a near -steady potassium concentration potassium elimination through the gastrointestinal tract is 
essential .  
In the general population, the normal range for serum potassium is typi[INVESTIGATOR_658581] 3.5 and 5.0 mEq/L  but in HD patients the ideal serum potassium concentration tends to be higher.  In a study of 2,134 HD 
patients, a pre- dialysis serum potassium level of 5.1 mEq/L was associated with the lowest risk of peri -dialytic 
sudden c ardiac arrest, while potassium levels above and below 5.1 were associated with increasing risk  
5.  
Another study examining pre- dialysis serum potass ium levels and survival within a cohort of 81,013 
hemodialysis patients, potassium concentrations between 4.6- 5.3 mEq/L were associated with the lowest 
incidence of all -cause mortality  9nd a survey of 55,183 HD patients in the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice 
Patterns Study (DOPPS) multinational cohort confirmed that the lowest risk of death was observed among 
patients with serum potassium levels between 4 and 5.5 mEq/L and a significa nt increased  risk of death and 
arrhythmia outcomes at potassium values ≥5.6 mEq/L  10 In a study of  serum potassium values obtained within 
a large dialysis organization, approximately 20% of all serum potassium measurements were ≥5.5 mEq, and 
about 12.5% of measurements were ≥6.0, whereas potassium <4.0 accounted for only 9% of all 
measurements  4. 
The removal of potassium from an individual receiving conventional HD departs dramatically from the 
physiology of a person who has normal kidney function.  First of all, HD can only  remove  potassium from the 
extracellular fluid compartment, which contains just  2% of total body potassium  2.  Second, the rate of lowering 
of ser um potassium concentration is inconstant , causing a rapid fall in serum potassium  at the start of the HD 
treatment when the serum -to-dialysate gradient is highest.  The abrupt drop in the first hour is followed by 
[CONTACT_658593] 2- [ADDRESS_888352], the end of the HD session 
causes a  subacute “rebound” of serum potassium levels as potassium mobilizes from the intracellular to the 
extracellular space. The magnitude and the time course of these potassium transients over the HD period are 
influenced by [CONTACT_658594], dialysat e bicarbonate, g lucose,  and potass ium 
concentrations  12.  The potential impact of excursions of potassium concentrations is compelling. In a study of 
ESRD patients on conventional treatment schedules who had wearable defibrillators in place, 70.0% of the 
captured arrhythmia events occurred during the HD session and 2.8% arrhythmias were observed immediately 
after the dialysis procedure 13. 
It might seem as if the problem of hyperkalemia in ESRD can be managed by [CONTACT_20998] a very low dialysate 
potassium concentration.  However, potential hazards may arise by [CONTACT_658595][INVESTIGATOR_658582] s 14.  Clearly a  lack of consensus exists on the ideal dialysate potassium 
concentration to prescribe.  R ecent data from DOPPS reported the range of prevalent use of potassium 
dialysate <2 mEq/L from as low as 3% in the US to a s high as 62% in Spain 10.  The safety of low potassium 
dialysate has been a focus of concern given the possibility that dialysis -induced potassium reductions  may 
provoke cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.  Multiple large retrospect ive studies investigated 
associations between dialysate potassium levels, serum potassium levels, and risk of sudden death, cardiac 
events, and all -cause mortality. In general, large cohort studies identified increased risks of sudden cardiac 
death associated with use of low potassium dialysate < 2 mEq/L 5,9.  The risks associated with low potassium 
dialysate are principally seen among patients with low to norm al pre- dialysis serum potassium.  N o long- term, 
prospective,  controlled st udies have been conducted to examine the effect of low potassium dialysate on hard 
clinical outcomes, but several short term trials employed cardiac monitors to measure subclinical arrhythmic 
events such  as ventricular ectopy,  premature ventricular complex es, and changes in electrocardiographic 
conduction parameters  13,15.  Most but not all studies observed higher rates of ventricular ectopy and QTc 
interval prolongation associated with exposure to potassium dialysates of 0 or 1 mEq/L compared to higher 
potassium dialysate concentrations  14 16,17.  However, whether these observations also apply to clinical 
arrhythmic events or mortality is not known.  In summary, circumstantial evidence highlights  the hazards of 
using a low potassium dialysate <2 mEq/L, and t he evidence for risk is strongest for patients with serum 
potassium levels <5 mEq/L. Whether lower potassium dialysate is appropriate or potentially beneficial for 
patients with higher serum potassium levels is unclear.  
Alternatively, hyperkalemia in ESRD patients can potentially be managed with oral medications  which can bind 
potassium .  Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) has been available since the 1950s to treat high serum 
potassium levels , and it is approved for treatment of hyperkalemia by [CONTACT_3133] 
(FDA) 18.  However , SPS has not been rigorously studied.  There is limited prospective,  long- term clinical trial 
data available to understand the safety and efficacy of these agents , particularly in patients with ESRD .  
Patients experience adverse gastrointestinal symptoms with SPS, and its use has been associated with life-
threatening colonic necrosis 19-21.  In addition, a  significant sodium load can occur with SPS, and this can be a 
particular concern in patients with ESRD  22,[ADDRESS_888353] consists of the polymer anion and a calcium -sorbitol 
counter -ion.  The polymer anion is also termed “patiromer anion” or simply “patiromer,” and it is the active 
moiety. The resin is a cation- exchange polymer that binds pot assium predominantly in the lumen of the colon 
where active potassium secretion occurs.  This potassium binding leads to fecal potassium excretion, leading 
to removal of potassium f rom the body and lowering of serum potassium levels in the hyperkalemic pat ient.  
On October 21, [ADDRESS_888354] who are treated with three times per week with HD are commonly exposed to the risk of 
high potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia).  Serum potassium values above 5.5 mEq/L are associated with increased mortality.  Hyperkalemia treatment options are limited in the ESRD population.  The use of SPS is 
associated with poor patient tolerance and with serious adverse clinical risks; the prescription of low potassium 
dialysate (<2mEq/L) is associated with increased risk of  cardiac arrest.  Oral administration of patiromer is 
effective to decrease serum potassium in patients who have CKD and hyperkalemia, but it has not been studied extensively in HD patients.  Either hyperkalemia or excursions in serum potassium concentrati ons may 
play a role in the high risk of sudden cardiac death in ESRD patients treated with HD.  It is not known if once-daily dosing of patiromer will reduce the frequency of epi[INVESTIGATOR_658583].  
It is important to review  standard, usual care for ESRD patients who are treated with conventional HD 
schedules (thrice- weekly treatments), to avoid and t reat epi[INVESTIGATOR_522682].  If patients present at an 
emergency facility or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_658584] a, they are typi[INVESTIGATOR_658585], intravenous glucose and insulin, and/or intravenous calcium  
24.  The latter does not treat the 
hyperkalemia per se, but it is intended to stabilize the myocardial cells and limit risk of depolarization.  A single 
dose of SPS is often admini stered.  If these medical interventions fail to resolve hyperkalemia, urgent 
hemodialysis is prescribed.  In the outpatient setting, hyperkalemia may be detected at the start of the HD session.  If there are no symptoms, patients receive hemodialysis with their usual prescriptions  and no further 
interventions are prescribed.  For all patients, the HD clinic -based dietitian will counsel on adherence with a 
low potassium diet, with the goal of limiting potassium intake to less than 60 mEq per day  
25,26.  For th is current 
protocol , the dietitian will be blinded to the assigned treatment for the course of the study.  If pre -dialysis 
hyperkalemia is a recurrent problem, the physician and dialysis clinic team will review the prescribed dialysate.  
Due to the risk associated with prescription of low dialysate potas sium, the outpatient clinics employed in this 
study do not prescribe dialysate potassium lower than than 2 mEq/L.  In rare instances, if hyperkalemia 
continues to recur despi[INVESTIGATOR_374949], and additional HD treatments will be prescribed.   
 
 
 
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_888355] study, 243 patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) and hyperkalemia initially were treated with patiromer  27.  The starting dose was 8.4 or 16.8 g 
(as divided doses BID)  for four weeks.  With a mean daily dose of patiromer during the initial treatment phase 
of 12.8 g in patients with mild hyperkalemia and 21.4 g in patients with moderate- to-severe hyperkalemia, 76% 
of the participants reached the target range of serum potassium  (3.8-5.1 mEq/L) .  Then the study had an 8-
week period of randomized withdrawal from patiromer in 107 subjects .  In the latter period, hyperkalemia 
occurred in 60% of the placebo- treated patients and only 15% of the patients who continued on patiromer  27.   
In the second study, 304 subjects with hyperkalemia, CKD, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension were 
randomized to receive 1 of 3 randomized starting doses of patiromer (4.2 g [n = 74], 8.4 g [n = 74], or 12.6 g 
[n = 74] twice  daily [mild hyperkalemia] or 8.4 g [n = 26], 12.6 g [n = 28], or 16.8 g [n = 30] twice daily [moderate 
hyperkalemia])  28. Patiromer was titrated to achieve and maintain serum potassium level 5.0 mEq/L or lower .  
At the  end of the open label 52- week study the mean reduction from baseline in serum potassium level at week 
4 in patients with mild hyperkalemia was 0. 35 mEq/L for the 4.2 g twice daily starting- dose group, 0.51 mEq/L 
for the 8.4 g twice daily starting- dose group, and 0.55 mEq/L for the 12.[ADDRESS_888356] 
patients on HD were monitored for a 7-day baseline period, then they were administered patiromer 4.2g TID  
29.  
In this small study, the mean serum potassium decreased from 5.79 ± 0.31 mEq/L at baseline to 5.39 mEq/L 
during treatment, a mean decrease = 0.4 mEq/L (p=0.08).   The mean fecal potassium  excretion increased from 
616 ± 203 mg/day during baseline to 975 ± 399 mg/day during treatment (P=0.02) .  The proportion of days with 
serum potassium < 5.5 mEq/L was 38% during the baseline period and 67% during the treatment per iod.. 
 This current  protocol includes an initial dose of patiromer of 8.4g once daily to be administered with the 
morning or mid- day meal.  This will be titrated according to the pre- dialysis potassium values in weeks 1, [ADDRESS_888357] duration ( 52 weeks ), hypomagnesemia (7.2%) 
was the most common treatment -related adverse event, mild to moderate constipation (6.3%) was the most 
common gastroi ntestinal adverse event, and hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L) occurred in 5.6% of patients

 6.10 Seven day  cardiac monitor   
The long- term heart  monitor (LTHM)  to be used in this study is a dual – channel wearable cardiac monitor that 
is applied as a skin patch.  The Medicomp Telepath records cardiac rhythms for up to 7 days 
(medicompi[INVESTIGATOR_161491].com; last accessed 5/1/19).  
The first LTHM, Telepatch #1 will be applied at the end of HD3 prior to W eek 0 and removed at the beginning 
of HD3  of Week 0 .  The second LTHM, Telepatch #2, will be applied at the end of HD3 at the end of HD3 and 
removed at the beginning of HD3 of Week 4.   
When the cardiac monitor is applied to a pat ient, a user guide and a symptom diary will be provided.  
 
6.11 Electrocardiography (ECG)  
A 12 lead ECG will be performed during Week 0.   The patient will go to an outpatient Duke cariology clinic for 
the ECG.

3.  The serum potassium  levels exceeds 7 mEq/L  during Week [ADDRESS_888366] sample is confirmed by a 
second sample exceeding 7  mEq/L at an unscheduled visit within one week.      
4.  A serious adverse event occurs (the Invest igator must consider severity of the event and relatedness to 
study medication).  
5.  A significant protocol violation occurs.  
The date and reason for discontinuation must be noted and a brief discontinuation summary must be filled out. 
Serious Adverse Eve nts should be followed up until resolution or for [ADDRESS_888367] subjects that discontinue from study return the remainder of their study medication.  
6.16.  Replacement of subjects  
Subjects who are withdrawn will not be replaced.  
7.  Study medication 
 7.1  Description of medication  
Patiromer is provided as a single- use packet containing a powder that can b e suspended in water for oral 
administration.   Patiromer is an off -white to light -brown powder; occasional white particles may be present.   
Each packet contains 8.4 g patiromer.   Patiromer will be provided free of charge to study participant s.  Once 
the study is over, the remaining patiromer will be returned to Relypsa.  
 7.2  Treatment dispensing  and administration  
The coordinator will provide patiromer packets as outlined to the study participants who randomize to 
receive the study medication.  The patient will be written instructions  to take patiromer as follows:  
 
• Measure ~1/3 cup of water.  Pour half of the water into a glass, then add patiromer and stir.  
Add the remaining water and stir thoroughly.  The powder will not dissolve completely and the 
mixture will look cloudy.    
• Drink the mixture immediately.  If powder remains in the glass after dr inking, add more water, 
stir and drink immediately.  Repeat as needed to ensure the entire dose is administered.  
• Patiromer can be mixed with water, apple juice, or cranberry juice.  Prepare each dose immediately prior to administration.  
• Patiromer should not be heated (e.g., microwaved) or added to heated foods or liquids.   
• Patiromer should not be taken in its dry form.  
 
7.3.  Storage requirements  
Patiromer will be stored in the refrigerator at 2°C – 8°C (36°F – 46°F).  If stored at room  
temperature (25°C  ± 2°C [77°F ± 4°F]), patiromer must be used within 3 months of being taken out of 
the refrigerator.  For either storage condition, do not use patiromer after the expi[INVESTIGATOR_658587].  Avoid exposure to excessive heat above 40°C (104°F).  
 
  
8.  Statistics 
 
 8.1.  Primary analysis  
This is a proof -of-concept study, to determine the extent to which administration of patiromer has the potential 
to change the risk category for ESRD patients who are on conventional HD schedules.  In addition, the study 
aims to develop and test study procedures and instruments that will be implemented in a large- scale clinical 
trial.  
By [CONTACT_658589], the power of the trial will be limited for the primary analysis.  The proposed 
primary endpoint  is the between- group differences of the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], per subject, of serum K ≥ 5.5 
mEq/L during Weeks 3 and 4.  This will be assessed as follows:  Six serum samples will be collected and 
assessed for each patient during the efficacy phase (Weeks 3 and 4).  Patients would receive a score of 
perfect K control  (6 of 6 samples in range; Score 1.0), moderate K control  (5 of 6 in range; Score 0.83), 
inconsistent K control  (4 of 6 in range; Score 0.67), erratic K control  (3 of 6 in range; Score 0.50), poor  K 
control  (2 of 6 in range; Score 0.33), very poor K control  (1 of 6 in range; Score 0.17), or no K control  (0 of 6 in 
range, Score 0).  These s cores will then be averaged for the patients in the active treatment group and the 
control group, and the results will be compared.  Using this approach, a sample size of n=20 per group 
provides 86% power to detect a between- group difference of 2 in mean epi[INVESTIGATOR_658574], 
assuming α=0.[ADDRESS_888368] on the exploratory endpoints will be 
considered in light of the results of the primary analysis.  
Differences in laboratory values between the treatment groups will be determined by [CONTACT_6484] (ANOVA).  The long- term heart monitor results will be compared in the following ways:  
Group 1: Individual patient compared by [CONTACT_658598] #1 vs LTHM #2;  
Group 2: Individual patient compared by [CONTACT_658598] #1 vs LTHM #2 
Group 1 LTHM #1 vs Group 2, LTHM #1;  
Group 1 LTHM #2 vs Group 2, LTHM #[ADDRESS_888369] severe event.

between the treatment groups.  
Bradyarrhythmias will be recorded and classified for comparison as follows: asystole > [ADDRESS_888371] degree AV block, second degree AV block, sinus pause > 3 seconds, and sinus bradycardia < 
40 bpm.  
9. Monitoring 
The spo nsor of the study, Relypsa, will provide study monitoring at a mutally agreeable time, during normal 
business hours.

STUDY SYNOPSIS
Protocol num ber: SHP681 -101 Drug: SHP681
Title of the study: A Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled, Phase 1 Study to Assess the Safety,
Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Ascending, Subcutaneous, Single and Multiple Doses of SHP681 (GLP -2 
analog -Fc fusion) in Healthy Adult Subjects
Number of subjects (total and for each treatm ent arm):
A total of 102 subjects (30 for the single ascending dose [SAD] portion and 72 subjects for the multiple 
ascending dose [MAD] portion) are planned to be enrolled for this study.
Investigator(s): 
Site(s) and Region(s):
Study period (planned):
Feb 2019 -Jan 2020Clinical phase: 1
Objectives:
Prim ary: To assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple, ascending, subcutaneous (SC) doses of
SHP681 in healthy adult subjects
Secondary: To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SHP681 following single and multiple, ascending SC 
doses in healthy adult subjects
Rationale:
SHP681 has been engineered with a significant half -life extension compared to teduglutide. This extended 
half-life is expected to allow  once weekly injection with similar safety and efficacy as teduglutide.
The present study is a first in human study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of SHP681 
when administered as single and multiple ascending SC doses.
Investigational product, dose, and mode of administration:
Investigational product (IP): SHP681 refers to a glucagon -like peptide -2 (GLP -2) analog -Fc fusion protein, 
abbreviated as GLP -2 analog -Fc fusion. The IP w ill be referred to as SHP681 through this document
SAD portion of the study -Dose escalation with single SC doses of SHP681: 0.2 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 
2 mg/kg, and 4 mg/kg vs. placebo.
MAD portion of the study -Sequential dose escalation of SC doses of SHP681: 0.2 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 
1mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, and 4 mg/kg. Each of th e first 5 MAD cohorts will receive SHP681 (or placebo) once 
weekly for 5 w eeks. The 6thMAD cohort w ill receive 4 mg/kg SHP681 once every 2 w eeks for 6 w eeks 
(3doses). 
All subjects (both SAD and MAD portions) will have the IP administered in the abdomen.
Methodology:
SAD -Part 1: The plan is to enroll [ADDRESS_607182] receives placebo. Dose 
escalation will proceed sequentially to assess the following SC doses of SHP681: 0.2 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 
2 mg/kg, and 4 mg/kg. After a single administration of SHP681 or placebo in each cohort, if the dose is assessed 
as safe and tolerable during a dose escalation meeting, the next cohort will be administered a SC dose of SHP681 
at the next higher dose level or placebo. During dose escalation, protocol defined dose levels may be reduced, 
repeated, discontinued, or an intermediate increase may be added depending on the outcome of the blinded safety 
data review  between dose escalations. Upon completion of these [ADDRESS_607183] of a screening p eriod of up to 28 days and

1.BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON
1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options
SHP681 is the Glucago n-like peptid e-2 (GLP-2) analo g-Fc fusion protein, abbreviated as 
GLP-2analog-Fc fusion. The IP will be called SHP681 through this document.
SHP681, a long acting glucagon like pepti de-2 (GL P- 2) analog, is being de veloped for treating 
patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS).
Short bowel sy ndrome is a rare, serious, disabling, socially incapacitating, and potentially
life-threatening condition (Nightingale and Woodward, 2006 ) resulting from surgical resection 
or congenital loss of most of the absorptive surfa ce area of the small intestine (O' Keefe et al., 
2006). Short bowel sy ndrome is characterized by [CONTACT_473853] -energy,fluid, 
electro lyte, or micronutrient balances when on a conventionally accepted, normal diet ( O' Keefe 
et al., 2006 ). Causes of SBS in adults include Crohn's disease, mesenteric ischemia, volvulus, 
trauma, surgical complic ations, and cancer.
The prevalence of adults with intestinal failure due to SBS is estimated at 2 -4 million, (Bakker et 
al., 1999 ; Kelly  et al., 2014 ; Mughal and Irving, 1986) while the incidence of neonatal SBS is 
estimated at 24.5 per 100,000 live births ( Wales et al., 2004 ). It is estimated that 83% of pediatric 
cases of SBS begin du ring infancy (Guarino and De Marco, 2003).
Patients with SBS are highly prone to malnutrition, diarrhea, de hydration, electro lyte 
disturbances, malabsorption of nutrients, gastric hypersecretion, metabolic acidosis, 
cholelithiasis, nephrolithiasis, steatorrhea, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and an inability to 
maintain weight due to the reduced intestinal capacity to absorb macronutrients, water, and 
electro lytes (Dudrick et al., 1991 ; Nightingale, 1999 ; Rombeau and Rolandelli, 1987 ; 
Shanbhogue and Molenaar, 1994; Vanderhoof and L angnas, 1997; Wilmore et al., 1997 ;
Nightingale and Woodward, 2006 ; O' Keefe et al., 2006). Complications common to SBS 
include d- lactic acidosis, h yperoxaluria, intestinal failure associated liver disease, and 
anastomotic ulcers.
Short bowel sy ndrome is the leading cause of intestinal failure, defined as the requirement for 
parenteral support (intravenous nutrition and/or flui ds) to maintain health and/or growth (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_473832]., 2016 ). Although parenteral support (PS) is considered li f
e-saving, it is also well associated 
with serious complications s uch as cathet er-associated bloodstream infections, catheter breaka ge, 
central venous thrombosis, metabolic bone disease, and liver disease. The risks of these 
complications increase commensurat ely with the duration of intestinal failure, and as a result, 
patients with intestinal failure have higher mortality rates than those with intestinal insufficiency
(Amiot et al., 2013; Goulet et al., 2005 ).
Some patients with SBS are able to adapt metabolically  and compensate for their malabsorption 
of fluids, electroly tes, trace elements, vitamins, or nutrients by  [CONTACT_20598]/enteral intake 
(Messing et al., 1999 ; Jeppesen and Mortensen, 2000 ) such that they  can attain enteral 
autonomy  (independence from parenteral support) even though they  continue to have sy mptoms 
of malabsorption (intestinal insuffi ciency ).

when administered as single and multiple, ascending subcutaneous (SC) doses.

1.2.2 Clinical Information
Teduglutide has been shown in clinical trials to reduce parenteral support requirements in 
patients with SBS. It is approved in the US (as Gattex®) for the treatment of adults with SBS 
who are dependent on paren teral support, and in Europe (as Revestive®) for treatment of 
patients aged 1 y ear and above with SBS who are stable following a period of intestinal 
adaptation after surgery . Teduglutide is administered at 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneous once daily .
Alway s refer to the latest version of the SHP681 investigator’s brochure for the overall

MAD (Part 2)
The MAD part will not commence until results of a pharmacokinetic and safety  data review of 
SAD Cohort 1, SAD Cohort 2, and partial data from SAD Cohort 3 are available. Each cohort 
will receive SHP681 (or placebo) once weekl y for [ADDRESS_607228] cohort has been 
administered 2 doses of SHP681 (or placebo) over [ADDRESS_607229] the I P administered i n the abdomen. Dose escalation will proceed sequentially  to 
include the following SC doses: 0.2 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, and 4 mg/kg weekly.
An interim anal ysis was performed after the last subject from the 3rd MAD cohort completed the 
Day 39 visit, to determine the dose level of the 6th MAD cohort, and to assess safety and 
pharmacod ynamics .As of the interim anal ysis, TAK -681 was well- tolerated anddose-dependent 
. The absorption of TAK -681 follow ing SC 
dosing was slow, with absorption half-life 
ranging from 12.7 hours to 30.7 hours. The apparent 
clearance and volume of distribution were 0.105 L/hours and 14.3 L, respectively . The mean 
elimination half -life of TAK -681 ranged from 89.8 hours to 104 hours (ie, 3.7 day s to 4.3 days) 
across dose levels. TAK -681 PK properties were observed to be linear and time -independent. 
Using a noncompartmental anal ysis, the area under the concentration -time curve from time zero 
to infinity  of TAK -681 after multiple doses increased in a dose -proportional manner from 
0.2mg/kg to 1 mg/kg. Based on these results, a dose of 4 mg/kg SHP681 (or pla cebo) every  
2weeks over a 6- week period (3 doses) was nominated for the 6th MAD cohort. 
During dose escalation, protocol defined dose levels may be reduced, repeated, discontinued, or 
an intermediate increase may be added depending on the outcome of the blinded saf etydata 
review between dose escalations. 
3.1.2 Screening and Treatment Period

6.1.[ADDRESS_607254]. This permits all other participants to remain 
blinded. A member of the staff of the CRU or clinical pharmacy should fulfill this role and 
should be fully trained in the relevant aspec tsofthestudy. His/her role should be documented on 
the site’s delegation of authority log. The unblinded dispenser may not administer the 
investigational product to study subjects. The unblinded dispenser must give the investigational 
product to the investigator or designee for administration. The unblinded dispenser will draw up 
the dose into a s yringe andapply a colored wrap to the dosing s yringe(s) to ensure blinding, as 
the active investigational product has a yello w-brown tinge compared to the pl acebo. The 
unblinded dispenser may not administer the investigational product to study subjects. Contact 
[INVESTIGATOR_82473] t he unblinded dispenser and stud y subjects should be kept to a minimum. The 
investigator, stu dy coordinator, andanystudy participants other t han the unblinded dispenser 
must not be allowed to know the investigational product assigned to a ny study subject and must 
not be allowed to see the randomization doe, investigational product containers, or treatment 
records. For emergency circumstances, please see Section 
6.2.3.
Aside from unblinding for the interim anal ysis, the treatment assignment must not be broken 
during the stu dy except in emergency  situations where the identification of the investigational 
product is required for further treatment of the subject(s) or to assess an ysafety,tolera bility, or 
pharmacokinetic questions based on the safe ty revie w.
Treatment assignments in the SAD cohorts and the first [ADDRESS_607255](s)
6.2.[ADDRESS_607256] numbers are assigned to all subjects as they consent to take part in the stu dy. Within each 
site (numbered uniqu elywithin a protocol), the subject number is assigned to subjects according 
to the sequence of presentation for study participation. This will be a 4- digit number starting at 
0001.
The actual treatment given to individual subjects is determined by a randomization schedule. The 
randomization number represents a unique number representing study  portion (SAD/MAD) as 
well as cohort and corresponds to investigational product allocated to the subject. This 
randomization number will be assign ed prior to dosing after eligibility  has been determined.
For the SAD portion Cohort 1, this unique 4 -digit randomization number will be assigned as 
follows:

The plan is to enroll [ADDRESS_607260] receives 
placebo. After a single administration on Day  1 of each treatment period of SHP681 or placebo 
in each cohort, if the dose is assessed as safe and tolerable during a dose escalation meeting, the 
next cohort will be administered a SC dose of SHP681 at the next higher dose level or placebo.
Dose escalation will proceed sequentially to assess the following SC doses of SHP681: 
0.2mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, and 4 mg/kg. During dose escalation, p rotocol defined 
dose levels may be reduced, repeated, discontinued, or an intermediate increase may be added 
depending on the outcome of the blinded saf ety data review between dose escalations.
MAD portion of the study
The plan is to enroll [ADDRESS_607261] 5 MAD cohorts will receive SHP681 (or placebo) 
once weekly for5weeks, on Day 1, 8, 15, [ADDRESS_607262] cohort has been administered 
2 doses of SHP681 (or placebo) over 2 weeks and the dose is assessed as safe and tolerable 
during a dose escalation meeting, the next MAD cohort will commence. Dose esca lation will 
proceed sequential ly to include the following SC doses: 0.2 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg,
2mg/kg, and 4 mg/kg. Subjects in the 6th MAD cohorts will receive 4 mg/kg SHP681 (or 
placebo) once every  [ADDRESS_607263] research

6.2.[ADDRESS_607265] is maintained within an established temperature range. The investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that the temperature is monitored throughout the duration of the study 
and that records are maintained; the temperature should be monitored continuously  by [CONTACT_473860] -house s ystem, a mechanical recording device such as a calibrated chart recorder, or 
by [CONTACT_3177], such that both minimum and maximum thermometric val ues over a specific 
time period can be recorded and retrieved as required. Such a device (ie, certified min/max 
thermometer) would require manual resetting upon each recording. The sponsor must be notified 
immediately  upon discovery  of an y excursion from t he established range. Temperature 
excursions will require site investigation as to cause and remediation. The sponsor will determine 
the ultimate impact of excursions on the investigational product and will provide supportive 
documentation as necessary . Under no circumstances should the product be dispensed to subjects 
until the impact has been determined and the product is deemed appropriate for use b y the 
sponsor.
The sponsor should be notified immediately  if there are an y changes to the storage area of the 
investigational product that could affect the integrity  of the product(s), eg, fumigation of a 
storage room.
6.[ADDRESS_607266] 
dispensed, used, returned, and/or destr oyed must be maintained as detailed further in this section.
The investigator has overall responsibility for administering investigational product. Where 
permissible, tasks may be delegated to a qualified designee (eg, a pharmacist) who is adequat ely 
trained in the protocol and who works under the direct supervision of the investigator. This 
delegation must be documented in the applicable study delegation of authority form.
The investigator or his/her designee (as documented by [CONTACT_1710]) will administer the investigational product only to subjects 
included in this study following the procedures set out in the study protocol. Each subject will be 
given onl y the investigational product car r ying his/her tr eatme nt assignment. All administered 
medications will be documented on the CRFs and/or other investigational product record. 
Noinvestigational product stock or returned inventory  from a Shi re-sponsored study may be 
removed from the site where origina llyshipped without prior knowledge and consent by [CONTACT_130376]. If such transfer is authorized by [CONTACT_456], all applicable local, state, and national laws 
must be adhered to for the transfer.

Adverse events are collected from the time informed consent is signed. (Please refer to Section 8, 
Adverse and Serious Adverse Events Assessment.)
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs
Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured at times specified i nthe 
Study  Schedules of this 
protocol. Additional blood pressure and pulse rate measurements may be performed, as 
determined b y the investigator, in order to ensure appropriate monitoring of subject safety and 
accurate recording of vital sign measurements. A ny changes from baseline which are deemed 
clinically  significant by [CONTACT_363589].
The same method for obtaining blood pressure measurement ( auscultatory or oscillometric) 
should be used throughout the study for all subjects (and documented). In addition, the 
conditions of vital sign measurements should be controlled and as consistent as possible during 
thestudy, in order to minimize external v ariability of the readings. It is advised that 
measurement s be collected at a comfortable room temperature with little to no background noise, 
using the same (appropriate ly sized) cuff placed at the same location of the same arm during the 
study
.
The bladder deflation rate should be deflated (calibrated for oscillometric method or manually  by 
[CONTACT_10182]) at a rate of 2- 3 mmHg/s (and the first and last audible sounds recorded as 
systolic and diastolic pressure) after at least [ADDRESS_607274] a bladder le ngth that is 80% and a width that is at least 40% of arm 
circumference (a length -to-width ratio of 2:1).
The subject should be asked to remove all clothing that covers the location of cuff placement. 
The subject should not have exercised or consumed caffei ne, alcohol, or nicotine within 
[ADDRESS_607275] should be sitting comfortabl y, with the legs uncrossed. The arm should be supported 
with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_6356], such that the middle of the cuff on the upper arm is at the level of the right atrium 
(approximately  halfway  between the bed and the level of the sternum).
At the screening visit, blood pressure should be compared between both arms. I f, after a single 
measurement is taken, there is a difference between arms in either s ystolic or diastolic blood 
pressure of >10 mmHg, the site will perform triplicate BP measuremen ts in each arm to 
determine the arm with the higher BP. The arm with the higher BP (based on the average of the 
3BP measurements for each arm) should be used for inclusion at screening, and the last of the 
3
measurements recorded in the eCRF as the screen ing BP. The same (right or left) arm with the 
higher blood pressure will be used throughout the study .

One reading (seated s ystolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure- pulse) should be taken. The 
use of automated devices for measuring pulse rate is acc eptable, although, when done manually , 
pulse rate will be measured in the brachial/radial artery  for at least [ADDRESS_607276] 
30 seconds and the temperature reported in degr ees Celsius. Ty mpanic temperature may also be 
used.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clini cal Laboratory Evaluations
All clinical laboratory  assay s will be performed according to the laboratory ’s normal procedures. 
Reference ranges are to be supplied by  [CONTACT_473861] -of-range pathological changes. The investigator 
should assess out -of-range clinical laboratory  values for clinical significance, indicating if the 
value(s) is/are not clinically  significant or clinically  significant. Abnormal clinical laborato ry 
values, which are unexpected or not explained by  [CONTACT_423]’s clinical condition, may , at the 
discretion of the investigator or sponsor, be repeated as soon as possible until confirmed, 
explained, or resolved.
The following clinical laboratory  assessme nts will be performed:

Urinalysis
A urine sample for urina lysis will be collected at the timepoints described in the 
Study Schedules. The following parameters will be assessed:
pH Blood Nitrites
Glucose Ketones Leuko cyte esterase
Protein Bilirubin Specific gravi ty
Microscopic examination will be conducted if protein and/or blood is/are detected during 
urina lysis. At a minimum the microscopic examination will consist of red blood cells, white 
blood cells, casts, and bacteria.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Test
For all female subjects (regardless of reproductive potential status), a serum pregnancy testis 
performed at the screening visit, while urine pregnancy test will be performed at subsequent 
scheduled timepoints as indicated in the Study  Schedules ifpregnanc yis suspected; or on 
withdrawal of the subject from the study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug and Alcohol Screen
A urine screen for drugs of abuse and alcoho l breath test will be performed at the timepoints 
described in 
the Study  Schedules . Additional drug and alcohol screens may be performed at the 
investigator’s discretion.
Urine samples are to be tested for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cannabinoids, 
cocaine, methadone, opi[INVESTIGATOR_10149], and phencyclidine.
Results of urine drug and alcohol screens will be reviewed and verified by[CONTACT_473862].

[IP_ADDRESS] Serology Screen
At the screening visit, a blood sample of approximately 8.[ADDRESS_607279] udy. Results of the virology
screen will be reviewed and verifi ed by [CONTACT_473863].
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram
Twelv e-lead ECGs will be performed at the times specified in the Study  Schedules .All ECGs 
will be performed using the equipment supplie d by [CONTACT_10186].
The following parameters will be recorded on the appropriate CRF page: heart rate, PR, 
RR,QRS, and QT intervals. The QTcB and QTcF will be derived from the data in the 
database. The investigator’s assessment of the ECG tracing as normal or abnormal must 
be documented, and if abnormal, his/her determination of whether theabnormality is 
clinical lysignificant or not will be documented on the tracing and recorded in the source 
documentati on.
The subject should be asked to remove all clothing that covers the location of lead placement. 
The subject should not have exercised or consumed caffe ine, alcohol, or nicotine within 
[ADDRESS_607280] 
5minutes prior to collecting the ECG.
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality. It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings.
Triplicate recording, including a 10-second rhy thm strip, will be obtained approximately  
2-4minutes apart for all assessments excluding the screening visit (wherein a single ECG 
assessment is required). Each ECG parameter obtained with the 3
assessments will be recorded 
in the CRF. The average of the triplicate ECG measurements collected at each nominal timepoint 
will be used for ana lysis. The 3 recordings should be immediately assessed as valid recordings 
and if not valid, they should be repeated in order to obtain a total of 3 valid recordings. Invalid 
recordings will not be entered in the CRF.

To ensure saf ety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the investigational site will make 
comparisons to baseline measurements.
If the QTcF interval (calculated online on site) is increased b y >45 msec from the baseline, or an 
absolute QTcF value is >500 msec for any scheduled ECG, then 2 additional ECGs will be 
collected, approximat ely 2- 4 minutes apart , to confirm the original measurement. 
Ifeither oftheQTcF values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value 
(>45 msec increase from the baseline; or >500 msec), then a single ECG must be repeated at 
least hourly until QTcF values from [ADDRESS_607282] follow -up ECGs.
If QTcF values remain above 500 msec (or >45 msec from the baseline) for >4 hours (or sooner 
at the discretion of the investigator) or QTcF intervals get progressiv elylonger, the subject 
should undergo continuous ECG monitoring. A cardiologist should be consulted ifQTcF 
intervals do not return to <500 msec (or to <45 msec above the baseline) after 8 hours of 
monitoring (or sooner at the discretion of the investigator). If amachine-read QTcF/QTcB value 
is prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements may not benecessary if a qualified 
physician’s interpretation determines that the QTcF/QTcB values are in the acceptable range.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abdominal Ultrasound
An abdominal ultrasound will be performed at the times specifie
d in the Study  Schedules .
7.2.3 Pharmacokinetic Procedures
The name [CONTACT_473886] (ies) forthis studywill be maintained in the 
investi gator’s files at the/each site and in the Trial Master File at the sponsor. A laboratory  
manual fully describing the schedule and method of sample handling will be provided to the site. 
Actual pharmacokinetic blood sample collection times versus time of do sing will be monitored. 
The sponsor’s expectation is that the investigator will ensure that every effort is made to collect 
all pharmacokin etic blood samples at the precise protocol scheduled time but must record the 
actual clock time (AM/PM or 24- hr) of the sample collection. Pharmacokinetic blood collection 
must not deviate from the nominal collection time set forth in the protocol by  [CONTACT_726] 
±5minutes for samples drawn within [ADDRESS_607283] 
dose or by [CONTACT_204962] ±[ADDRESS_607284] dose. Samples drawn bey ond study  day

Guidance E2 A 1995).
All AEs are coll ected from the time the informed consent is signed until the defined foll ow-up 
period stated in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_607290] be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline status 
or all variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in 
thestudy. Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved (the investigator 
does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise 
explained. When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of 
event(s) can be documented.

8.1.2 Relationship Categorization
A physician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for 
each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event ma yhave been caused by [CONTACT_7198]. If 
there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not 
related”. Otherwise, if there is any valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting 
a possi ble cause- and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence 
of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related”. The causality assessment must be 
documented in the source document.
The following additional guidance may be hel pful:
Term Relationship Definition
RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the 
investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response 
pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explai ned by [CONTACT_423]’s medical 
condition, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or accident.
Not RelatedThe event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s underlying 
medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident and no plausible temporal or 
biologi c relationship exists between the investigational product and the event.
8.1.[ADDRESS_607292] be recorded during the course of the stu dy on the CRF. Outcomes are 
as follows:
Fatal
Not Recovered/Not Resolved
Recovered/Resolved
Recovered/Resolved With Sequelae
Recovering/Resolving

8.1.[ADDRESS_607293] to the start of study  
treatment, further investigations should be performe d until the values return to within the 
refere nce range or until a plausible explanation (eg, concomitant disease) is found for the 
abnormal values.
The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a 
subject, whethe r a change in a clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG parameter is clinica lly 
significant and therefore represents an AE.

Report Form (and an y applicable follow -up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire medical 
monitor using the details specified in the emergency  contact [CONTACT_1739]. 
The pregnant fem ale study  participant must be withdrawn from the study .
Everyeffort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome and 
condition of the infant. It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain this information within

Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion/misc arriage or congenital abnormality
areconsidered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event 
and Non -serious AEs Required by [CONTACT_10191]. Note: An elective abortion is not 
considered an SAE.
In addition to the above, if the investigator determines that the pregnancy meets serious 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire C linical Study Serious Adverse Event and 
Non-serious AEs Required by [CONTACT_473865]. The test date of the first positive serum/urine -hCG

Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error (as defined below) must be reported to the sponsor 
according to the SAE reporting procedure whether or not they result in an AE/SAE as described 
in Section 8.2. Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply to reports of 
abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE.

sponsor has provided under separate cover to all investigators. However, this is the first clinical 
experience with SHP681 in humans. While major AEs are not anticipated, the investigator 
should proceed with caution. Equipment, supplies, and prope rly skilled medical personnel should 
be immediately available for emergency use in the event of an unexpected reaction. Subjects 
must be carefully selected and monitored clos ely.
8.2.[ADDRESS_607297] be reported by  [CONTACT_473866]/Shire medical monitor within [ADDRESS_607298] awareness of 
the event. Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not ap ply to reports of abuse, 
misuse, overdose, or medication errors (see Section 8.1.6) unless they  result in an SAE.

and Non -serious AEs Required by [CONTACT_473867] (Note: Source documents are not 
to be sent unless requested) and fax or e-mail the form to the Shire Global Pharmacovigilance 
and Risk Management D epartment.
A copy of theShire Clinical StudySerious Adverse Event and Non- serious AEs Required by[CONTACT_473868] (and a nyapplicable follow -up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire

8.2.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be 
related to investigational product or not) that at any dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening. Note: The t erm “li fe-threatening” in the definition of “serious” re fers to an 
event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more s evere.
Requires inpati ent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8686].
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473841]-existing conditions and have not worsened after initiation of treatment should not be 
classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a previously scheduled ventral hernia 
repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_473842] t(s) serious criteria 
must be reported as SAE(s).
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
Is a congenital abnormali ty/birth defect
Is an important medical event. Note: Important medical events that may not result in death, 
be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. Example s of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency
room or at home; blood d yscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study ) are collected from the time the subject signs the 
informed consent until the defined follow- up period stated in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_607300] be reported 
to the Shire Global Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department and the CRO/Shire 
medical monitor within [ADDRESS_607301] awareness of the event.

GLP -2 analog -Fc fusion 19 Nov 2019
In addition, any SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by  [CONTACT_10194] y inte rval after the study  has completed must be reported to the Shire Global 
Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department within [ADDRESS_607302]’s death (ie, the SAE was noted as the primary  cause of death) 
must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution dat e. For 
all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the 
outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded.
For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless 
another investigational product action was previously  taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, 
withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not 
changed” or “not applicable” (if the subjec t never received investigational product). The 
investigational product action of withdrawn should not be selected solel y as a result of the 
subject’s death.
8.2.[ADDRESS_607303], Ethics Committee, and Site 
Reporting
The sponsor is responsible for noti fying the relevant regulatory authorities of related, unexpected 
SAEs.
In addition the sponsor is responsible for notify ing active sites of all related, unexpected SAEs 
occurring during all interventional studies across the SHP681 program.
The investigator is responsible for notify ing the local IRB, local EC, or the relevant local 
regulatory authori ty of all SAEs that occur at his or her site as required.

9.DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS
9.1 Data Collection
The investigators’ authorized site personnel must enter the information required by [CONTACT_64760]. A study monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and 
review the CRF data against the source data for co mpleteness and accurac y. Discrepancies 
between source data and data entered on the CRF will be addressed by [CONTACT_1746]. 
When a data discrepancy warrants correction, the correction will be made by [CONTACT_59752]. Data collection proc edures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit 
and/or at the investigator’s meeting. Once a subject is randomized, it is expected that site 
personnel will complete the CRF entry
within a reasonable window of the subject’s visit.
9.2 Clinical Data Management
Data are to be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO data management plan. 
Quality  control and data validation procedures are applied to ensure the validity  and accuracy  of 
the clinical database.
Data are to be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring further 
clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarification are 
to be communicated to the site for resolution. Only authorized personnel will make corrections to 
the clinical database, and all co rrections are documented in an auditable manner.
9.3 Data Handling Considerations
Data that may  potentiall y unblind the treatment assignment (ie, investigational product blood 
concentrations, antibodies to SHP681,  
, treatment allocation, and investigational product preparation/accountability  data, 
will be handled with special care during the data cleaning and review process. These data will be 
handled in such a way  that, prior to unblinding, any  data that may  unblind study  team personnel 
will be presented as blinded information or otherwise will not be made available. If applicable, 
unblinded data may  be made available to quality  assurance representatives for the purposes of 
conducting independent drug audits.
9.4 Statistical Analysis Process
The study  will be anal yzed by  [CONTACT_10196].
The statistical anal ysis plan (SAP) will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the 
analysis of the PK and safety  data, as well as describe the approaches to be taken for 
summarizing other study  information such as subject disposition, demographics and baseline 
characteristics, investigational product exposure, and prior and concomitant medications. The 
SAP will also include a description of how m issing, unused and spurious data will be addressed.
For non-commercial use only

SHP681 -101 Protocol Am endment 4
GLP -2 analog -Fc fusion 19 Nov 2019
Descriptive anal ysis will be performed to evaluate PK endpoints and safet y endpoints. All 
analyses/summaries will be based on observed data, with missing data handling rules specified in 
Section 9.8.1 or the SAP.
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with the number of subj
ects (n), mean, standard 
deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum value. As appropriate, raw (actual) values, 
changes from baseline, and percent changes from baseline will be summar ized at each scheduled 
timepoint. Baseline is defined as the last non -missing value observed prior to dosing with 
SHP681 or placebo. Additional summary  statistics will be provided for PK endpoints and are 
indicated in Section 9.8.1.
Categorical endpoints w ill be summarized, display ing counts and percentages. Summaries will 
include, where applicable: number and percentage of subjects with an outcome measure and shift 
tables (categorical change from baseline). Summaries will be presented b y dose cohort and fo
r 
the placebo group, and, if appropriate, b y scheduled timepoint.
All data, including derived data, will be presented in subject data listings.
To preserve the integrit y of the statistical anal ysis and study  conclusions, the SAP will be 
finalized prior to database lock.
The pharmacokinetic analy sis will be conducted using Phoenix WinNonlin version 6.2 or higher 
(Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, [LOCATION_004], [LOCATION_003]). The statistical anal yses will be 
performed using SAS®(SAS I nstitute, Cary , NC [ZIP_CODE]).

Shire will endeavor to publish the results of all qualify ing, applicable, and covered studies 
according to external guidelines in a timely manner regardless of whether the outcomes are 
perceived as positive, neutral, or negative. Additional ly, Shire adheres to external guidelines 
(eg,Good Publication Practices 2) when forming a publication steering committee. The purpose 
of the publication steering committee is to act as a non- commercial bo dythat advises or decides 
on dissemination of scientific study data in accordance with the scope of this policy.
All publications relating to Shire products or projects must undergo appropriate technical and 
intellectual prope rty review, with Shire agreement to publish prior to release of information. The 
review is aimed at protecting the sponsor’s proprietary information existing either at the 
commencement of the study or gen erated d uring the stu dy. To the extent permitted by [CONTACT_473883], the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_59702] (or share with other authors) the 
copyright on his/her publications. To the extent that the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_10159], 
joint or shar ed rights, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_10160] a perpetual, ir revocable, 
royalty- free license to make and distribute copi[INVESTIGATOR_10161].
The term “publication” refers to any public disclosure including original research articles, review 
articles, oral presentations, abstracts and posters at medical congresses, journal supplements, 
letters to the editor, invited lectures, opi[INVESTIGATOR_10162], book chapters, electronic postings on 
medical/scientific websites, or other disclosure of the study results, in printed, electronic, oral or 
other form.
Subject to the terms of the paragraph below, the investigator shall have the right to publish the 
study  results, and any  background information provided by  [CONTACT_473884], or necessary  for other scholars to verify  such study  
results. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no publication that incorporates the sponsor’s 
confidential information shall be submitted for publication without the sponsor’s pri or written 
agreement to publish, and shall be given to the sponsor for review at least [ADDRESS_607321] publication of the study results shall be made 
by [CONTACT_10208]’s presentation of a joint, mult icenter publication 
of the compi[INVESTIGATOR_10163]. If such a multicenter publication is not submitted to a 
journal for publication by  [CONTACT_10209] 18-month period after conclusion, abandonment, 
or termination of the study  at all sites , or after the sponsor confirms there shall be no multicenter 
study  publication of the study  results, an investigator may individuall y publish the study results 
from the specific site in accordance with this section. The investigator must, however, 
acknowl edge in the publication the limitations of the single -site data being presented.
Unless otherwise required by  [CONTACT_10210], or the forum in which 
it is made, authorship will comply  with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
(ICMJE) current standards. Participation as an investigator does not confer any  rights to 
authorship of publications.

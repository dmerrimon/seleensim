Device Sizes The Vessix Reduce Catheter is available in balloon diameters of 4.0 
mm, 5.0 mm, 6.0 mm and 7.0 mm with a balloon length of 25 mm and 
a total catheter  working length of approximately 90 cm. The number of 
electrodes on each balloon varies from 4 to 6 bipolar electrodes, 
depending on balloon diameter.  The catheter is compatible with a 7F guide sheath . 
Study Design Prospective, multicenter, single blinde d, randomized, controlled, pi[INVESTIGATOR_709051] 100 randomized subjects  
Planned Number of Centers / Countries  Up to 20 centers in the US  
Primary Efficacy Assessment  Mean reduction in average 24 -hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure 
(ASBP) at [ADDRESS_963999] randomization 
Due to enrollment termination (51 subjects randomiz ed), the primary 
efficacy statistical hypothesis testing will not be conducted. All 
assessments will be observational.    
Safety Assessments Safety Assessments  analyzed at all follow -up time points : 
• All-cause death  
• Renal failure 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709052]  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709053]/syncope

  REDUCE -HTN: REINFORCE  
Method of 
Assigning Patients to Treatment  Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomized  at index 
procedure using an Interactive Randomization System  
Follow- up 
Schedule  All enrolled  subjects will be eval uated at 2 (14 ±7 days), 4 (28 ±7 days) 
and 8 (56±7 days) weeks post randomization . 
Subjects will be further evaluated at 3 (90±14 days), 4 (120 ±14 days), 5 (150 ±14 days), 6 (180 ±14 days), 12 (365 ±30 days), 18 (545 ±30 days), 24 (730±30 days), 30 (910±30 days), and 36 (1095 ±30 days) months post randomization. 
All subjects are required to complete follow up through the 24-month 
time point. After approval of protocol version AH, no further follow up 
will be required for subjects who have completed at lea st [ADDRESS_964001] randomization.  Subjects not yet through the 24-month follow up time point will be required to complete follow up through the 
24-month visit and will undergo a DUS at the 24-month follow up time point. 
Study Duration  It is estimated that it will take approximately 4 years  to complete this 
study. 
Medication Wash- out Phase 
and Medication Additions  After  signing the study Informed Consent Form , patients receiving 
pharmacotherapy for their hypertension will be discontinued from 
current antihypertensive medications .  These patients will be required 
to complete a 4 -week wash -out phase prior to randomization.  If a 
patient is not on antihypertensive medication at the time of Informed Consent, the wash-out period is not applicable. 
Subjects will remain off antihypertensive medications through the 
primary efficacy assessment ([ADDRESS_964002] randomization ) unless 
rescue changes are required.  Investigators have ultimate discretion 
regarding the type of antihypertensive medication and timing of adding rescue medications to ensure subject safety.  
If subjects are not at target ( target defined as OSBP <140 mmHg)  from  
the time of the primary efficacy assessment ([ADDRESS_964003] 
randomization) through the 6- month assessment , medications will be 
added and doses escalated as described in Section 13.3.

  5.2. Clinical Study Summary  
5.2.1. Vessix Vascular, Inc. REDUCE -HTN  
The REDUCE -HTN study (NCT 01541865) was initiated by [CONTACT_709072], Inc. Laguna 
Hills, CA in February 2012. 
 REDUCE -HTN is a prospective, non- randomized, single arm, multicenter study evaluating 
the safety and feasibility of renal denervation using the Vessix Renal Denervation S ystem in 
subjects with medication resistant  hypertension. The first in man (FIM) cohort enrolled 18 
subjects at six centers in Europe (5) and Australia (1) between February 22, 2012 and May 10, 2012.  Subjects considered for enrollment had office-based systolic blood pressure (OSBP) ≥160 mmHg while maintaining compliance with a stable drug regimen of ≥3 antihypertensive medications, including one diuretic (unless intolerance was documented), at maximally tolerated doses for a minimum of two weeks prior to enrollment. Subjects were 
required to have single main renal arteries of diameters ≥3.5 mm and ≤7.0 mm and lengths 
≥20.0 mm without significant stenosis (<30% via angiography) or abnormalities to be eligible for enrollment. Subjects with eGFR <45 m L/min/1.73m
2, Type I diabetes mellitus, 
known/diagnosed secondary hypertension, prior renal art ery intervention, or accessory renal 
arteries >2 mm in diameter that supplied >20% perfusion to the kidney were excluded.  
Following CE marking of the Vessix Renal Denervation System , the REDUCE -HTN 
protocol was amended to allow expanded enrollment in the Post  Market Study (PMS) .  Key 
protocol modifications for the PMS included enrollment of subjects with renal artery length 
≥15 mm or accessory renal arteries, clarification of the exclusion criterion related to abnormal electrocardiogram (“clinically signif icant”) and substitution of the 1-month renal 
artery duplex ultrasound ( DUS ) requirement with a [ADDRESS_964011] Market Study was completed on April 8, 
2013, with a total of 146 subjects enrolled and treated at 23 centers in Europe (17), Australia (4), and New Zealand (2), including continued follow-up on the [ADDRESS_964012]-market study subjects.  
All s ubjects will be followed at 2 weeks and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.  Follow- up 
assessments will include office blood pressure measurement, blood assays and urinalysis for 
renal function, renal DUS at 6 months, and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) 
at 6 and 12-months. Subjects are required to maintain compliance with  all antihypertensive 
medications throughout the follow -up period. 
At 6 months, the mean office SBP was 157.5±23.5 mmHg, a reduction of 24.7±22.1 mmHg 
compared with baseline (P<.0001), thus met the efficacy primary endpoint for the study. Twenty four-hour ambulatory SBP was reduced by 8.4±14.4 mmHg at 6 months (P<.0001). No pre- specified acute safety events occurred. However, one subject (0.7%) was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_549791] a hypertensive emergency unrelated to medication and/or non -compliance within [ADDRESS_964013] (0.7%) had renal artery stenosis which required an intervention. Three other subjects had flow- limiting ste nosis in the renal artery at 6 months 
which did not require intervention.

HTN-1 clinical outcomes for treated subjects demonstrated a sustained reduction of office blood pressure of -14/-10, -21/-10, - 22/-11, - 24/-11 and -27/-17 mmHg at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 
months, respectively. In those subjects assessed for noradrenaline spi[INVESTIGATOR_11036], a mean r eduction 
of 47% (95% CI 28-65%) was observed. For the 5 non- treated subjects, a mean rise in office 
based blood pressure of +3/-2, +2/+3, +14/+9 and +26/+[ADDRESS_964016] udies, the two and three year durability of blood pressure reduction 
via renal sympathetic renal nerve ablation was reported by [CONTACT_709073].
5,15 _ENREF_2  A total 
of 153 patients with resistant hypertension were enrolled in the open label study. Follow-up assessments occurred at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months. Renal nerve ablation resulted in highly significant blood pressure reductions that were maintained over the 3-year follow-up period.  
The mean blood pressure reductions reached 32 mmHg for systolic and 14 mmHg for 
diastolic at 36 months. Ninety- three percent of the patients had an office blood pressure 
reduction of ≥[ADDRESS_964017] proc edure. Blood pressures were reduced on 
average by 21/10, 24/11, 26/11, 27/12, 26/14, 30/13 and 32/14 mmHg at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months respectively.

The procedure was without complication in 97% of patients (149/153). Complications included renal artery dissection, pseudoaneurysm/hematomas at the femoral access site, minor spasm or edema, progression of a preexisting renal artery stenosis and flank pain. Renal function remained stable during the first year of follow-up with a mean eGFR reduction of 2.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI -6.2 to +0.3) for the 64 patients who were available

  at 12 months. However, in the ten patients who completed the 24-month follow-up, there was 
a drop of 16 ml/min/1.73 m2 in eGFR values. The two and three-year durability study demonstrates that significant blood pressure reductions were sustained out to 24 and 36 months which supports the durability of reduction in blood pressure due to renal nerve ablation. The procedure is well tolerated and generally safe.  
Based on the positive outcomes observed in HTN- 1, a larger randomized trial (HTN -2) was 
conducted.  Simplicity HTN -2
16 was a multicenter prospective randomized trial designed to 
assess the effectiveness and safety of catheter -based renal denervation to produce a reduction 
in blood pressure in subjects with ‘treatment resistant hypertension’. Of the 190 subjects screened f or eligibility, 106 were randomly allocated to renal denervation (n=52) or control 
(n=54) groups between June 9, 2009 and January 15, 2010.  The primary efficacy endpoint consisted of the change in seated office-based measurement of systolic blood pressure at 6 months. The 6-month primary endpoint was assessed in 49 of the 52 subjects who underwent 
renal denervation and 51 of 54 controls. Office based blood pressure in the renal denervation 
group reduced by -32/-12 mmHg (baseline of 178/96 mmHg), whereas blood pressures did not differ from baseline in the control group (+1/0 mmHg, baseline of 178/97 mmHg).  
After the primary endpoint was met, 46 control patients (cross over group) underwent renal 
denervation. Esler et al
17_ENREF_18 reported that the 6-month follow up of the cross over 
group showed a significant drop in blood pressure (190.0/99.9 mmHg to 166.3/91.5 mmHg). The one-year follow-up of the initial RDN group continued to show significantly lower blood pressure when compared to baseli ne office BP; although BP at 12 months w as slightly 
elevated from the 6 -month average (-31.7/-11.7 at 6 months compared to -28.1/- 9.7 at 12 
months).   
As with HTN- 1, a favorable safety profile was observed in HTN -2. Safety outcomes for 
HTN- [ADDRESS_964018] 3 antihypertensive medications of different classes at maximal tolerable doses.  Bhatt 
et al19 report 535 patients were enrolled  into the trial; 2 treatment : 1control (masked 
procedure).  The primary efficacy endpoint of mean change at 6 months in systolic office 
blood pressure was not met.  The reduction for the treatment group was - 14.13±23.93 mmHg 
and for the control was -11.74±25.94 mmHg; P=0.26.  The study continued to demonstrate safety of the technology with a 1.4% major adverse event rate for the renal denervation group and 0.6% for the masked procedure group.  Ongoing discussions continue as to why these results do not replicate those of previous trials.  Medication compliance and adjustments are thought to have played a role.

  fibers  in patients with drug-resistant hypertension was conducted in 46 patients (67% male, 
mean age 60 years, and mean baseline office blood pressure 176/96 mmHg) with drug-
resistant hypertension. The primary efficacy objective was change in office blood pressure from  baseline to 6 months. Safety measures included all adverse events with a focus on the 
renal artery and other vascular complications and changes in renal function. Renal artery denervation, using the EnligHTN system significantly reduced the office blood pressure from baseline to 1, 3, 6 and 12 months by -28/10, -27/10, -26/10 mmHg and -27/-11, respectively (P=0.0001). No acute renal artery injury or other serious vascular complications occurred.  
Three patients had device and/or procedural related adverse events through the 12-month follow-up.  The events were hypotension, progression of renal artery stenosis and progression of hypertensive renal artery disease.  Small, non- clinically relevant, changes in average

6. Device Description 
The Vessix Renal Denervation System consists of the Vessix Reduce Catheter, a non -
compliant balloon catheter with bipolar electrodes mounted on the exterior of the balloon, the Vessix Generator (including power supply), and an optional patient extension cable. Study 
sites will also be provided with Vessix Guide Sheath s and a mobile rol l cart  for transporting 
the Vessix Generator . 
 The Vessix Renal Denervation System is designed to deliver radio frequency (RF) energy to 
create precisely located and defined local lesions in the renal arte ry in order to inactivate the 
sympathetic nerves located in the adventitial layer of the renal artery.  
 The V essix Renal Denervation System is CE-marked, TGA-approved and approved for use 
in other regions, but is investigational in the US.  
6.1. Vessix Reduce Catheter  
The Vessix Reduce Catheter is a sterile, single use, over -the- wire percutaneous transluminal 
balloon catheter designed to transmit RF energy via surface-mounted electrodes to treat 
resistant  hypertension. The balloon exterior surface carries bipolar electrodes that deliver RF 
energy to the renal arteries after low pressure (3 ATM) inflation via standard balloon 
angioplasty techniques. The electrodes are centered axially on a noncompliant PET balloon 
and are gold for radiopacity, thereby [CONTACT_709074]  (see Figure 6.1-1).  
The number of electrodes on each balloon varies from 4 to 6 bipolar electrodes, depending on balloon diameter.

6.2. Vessix Generator  
The Vessix  generator is a portable bipolar RF generator which interfaces with the catheter to 
deliver low -power (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 0.5- 2 watts per electrode) RF energy into the renal artery at a 
treatment frequency of 480 kHz. The generator consists of a bright 9” diagonal LCD screen, 
minimalistic and user -friendly graphical user interface (GUI), and an assortment of indicator 
lights (LEDs) and physical buttons.  The generator is classified as a Type BF applied part per  ANSI/ASMI IS [ZIP_CODE]-1:[ADDRESS_964022] 
Edition.  The catheter is connected to the generator either directly or via an intermediate accessory 3 meter patient  extension cable. The generator is pole-mounted to a mobile roll stand and does 
not reside within the sterile field.   
6.3. Patient Extension Cable  
The patient extension cable is a 3 meter cable that connects the Vessix Reduce Catheter to 
the Vessix G enerator and allows for the RF equipment to be located outside the sterile field.  
Use of the patient extension cable is optional.   
6.4. Power Supply  
A medically -certified power supply will convert wall mains AC to local 15 VDC to power

  9.2. Treatment Assignment  
The REDUCE -HTN: REINFORCE  Clinical Study is a randomized  study with treatment arm 
assignments.  Subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria an d do not meet any exclusion criteria 
will be assigned to treatment in a 2:1  (Treatment:Control) scheme.   
Randomization will be accomplished using an Interactive Randomization System.  Subjects will 
be considered enrolled at the time of randomization.   
9.2.1. Treatment and Control  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment  
The device to be evaluated will consist of the Vessix Renal Denervation System : 
• Vessix Reduce Catheter (4 .0, 5.0, 6.0 and 7.0 mm)  
• Vessix Generator ( bipolar radio frequency) 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Control 
The control for the pr imary efficacy assessment is a masked procedure.  
9.2.2. Target and Non-target Arteries  
For each kidney, main renal arteries and  accessory renal arteries (as applicable)  which meet all 
the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria will be treated in this s tudy.   
9.3. Justification for the Study Design  
The REDUCE -HTN: REINFORCE  Clinical Study is intended to demonstrate the effects of renal 
denervation in the absence of potentially confounding antihypertensive medications. The design, 
including an antihypertensive medication  wash -out phase, is similar to pharmaceutical study 
designs looking at early efficacy of compounds. The number of safety events in patients off therapy during the primary efficacy assessment peri od is low in the pharma ceutical  studies.
23,[ADDRESS_964026] blind ing, the blinded 
blood pressure assessor and the utilization of ABPM will provide unbiased data in support of 
efficacy.   
 Because REDUCE -HTN : REINFORCE Clinical Study is the first study to evaluate the Vessix 
Renal Denervation  System  in this off medication population, actions will be taken throughout the 
course of the study to minimize risks to enrolled subjects. These risk minimization efforts are summarized in Section 21.2.

 12.1.1. Medical Equipment Description  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Office -based Blood Pressure Monitoring 
Office -based blood pressure (OBP) measurements will be collected during screening, at 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709059]-up visit with an automatic oscillometric Omron 
HEM -705CP- II monitor (Omron Healthcare, Vernon Hills, IL, [LOCATION_003]) with a printer for 
documentation. Blood pressure will be measured according to the Standard Joint National Committee VII
26 and the European Society of Cardiology and European Society of 
Hypertension27 recommendations.  The devices should be properly maintained and regularly 
calibrated according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.  
 Office -based blood pressure must be obtained by [CONTACT_709078] 6-month follow-up visit. Site blinding guidelines are 
described in the Manual of Operations.  
 Refer to the instruction manual for the OBP monitor for set up and care information, and instructions for preparing the subject for blood pressure (BP) measurements, applying the BP cuff, taking the BP measurements and using the monitor in special conditions (i.e., SBP >220mmHg).    NOTE:  A properly sized BP cuff should be selected based upon the subject’s arm 
circumference.  
 During subject preparation the subject should: 
• avoid smoking, eating or vigorous exercise for 30 minutes prior to the BP 
measurements  
• sit quietly for 5 minutes prior to the measurements  
• sit in a chair with feet flat on the floor  
• rest arm on a table so that the cuff is at the same level as the heart  
• avoid talking during the measurements 
 
NOTE:  The BP should be measured in both upper arms at the screening visit to detect 
possible differences in the measurements.  The arm with the higher values should be used for baseline and all subsequent measurements.  It is recommended to obtain follow -up BP 
measurements at the same time of day as the baseline measurements are obtained.  
 Three (3) BP measurements will be obtained using the same arm at least [ADDRESS_964030] systolic BP (SBP) measurements are more than [ADDRESS_964031] ’s 
OBP may be reassessed for study eligibility at a subsequent time point.  If the lowest and

12.5. Treatment Period  
For the REDUCE -HTN: REINFORCE  Clinical Study, subjects will be randomized to either 
the control group, who will receive a masked procedure or to the treatment group, who will 
receive renal denervation.  All subjects will be washed out from antihypertensive medications 
and remain off medications through the primary efficacy assessment at [ADDRESS_964039] 
randomization unless rescue medication is required as described in  Section 13.1. 
12.5.1. Diagnostic Renal Angiogram , Masked Procedure and Renal Denervation 
Procedure  
Patients  meeting all clinical eligibility and anatomic eligibility based on non-invasive 
imaging will undergo diagnostic renal angiography. If anatomic eligibility is confirmed 
during the diagnostic angiogram, the patient will be immediately randomized and enrolled to 
the control or to the renal denervation treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Diagnostic Renal Angiogram 
A diagnostic aortogram should be performed to obtain visual confirmation of all renal arteries. A selective arteriogram will be performed on each renal artery using a diagnostic catheter in order to confirm anatomic eligibility is  met.   
NOTE:  If new anatomical exclusion criteria are identified during the angiogram the patient 
should not be randomized. 
Upon catheter/sheath  removal, either manual compression or commercialized closure devices 
can be used to achieve hemostasis at the puncture site. Standard -of-care post -intervention 
monitoring procedures should be followed. Angiographic images must be sent to the angiographic core laboratory for evaluation.

There is no clinical evidence to dat e suggesting the need for anticoagulant/  antiplatelet 
medications post -treatment.  
Subject must be able to tolerate analgesics during the treatment . Consider pre- treatment with 
both anxiolytic medications and analgesic medications, such as morphine sulfate or fentanyl. 
Subjects must be sedated. Intra -arterial vasodilators may be administered during  the 
procedure or prior to final angiogram after completing the procedure to prevent spasm. 
Investigators should ensure close monitoring of the amount of contrast for subjects with low 
baseline eGFRs.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Renal Artery Access  
• Use a femoral puncture technique to insert an appropriately sized (5 or 6F) introducer sheath. An activated clotting time (ACT) of >200 seconds is recommended prior to the initiation of the renal denervation procedure.  
• The appropriate Vessix Reduce Catheter to be used for the treatment should be 
identified from the information in Table 12.5-1 below.

can be inflated moving in 0.5 ATM  increments up to a pressure of 3.0 ATM . 
• When proper apposition is confirmed by [CONTACT_709080] G enerator upon balloon inflation, 
fluoroscopy should be used to demonstrate that the catheter is at the optimal position and that blood flow is occluded. Discontinue use of the Vessix  Reduce C atheter if 
excessive pressure is required to inflate the balloon.  
• Perform the denervation treatmen t. (See Vessix Generator Operators Manual).  
• Initiate the treatment by [CONTACT_709081]. (See the Vessix Generator Operators Manual).  
• If the more proximal portion of the artery needs to be denervated to achieve treatment of the full length of the renal artery, avoid overlap of treatment zones. It is

 recommended that the gap between treatment zones is approximately 5mm. ( NOTE:  
To allow for a partial treatment it is acceptable for the balloon to be located partial ly 
outside of the renal artery in the aorta).  
• Upon completion of the treatment, deflate the balloon by 0.[ADDRESS_964043] the balloon again into the sheath  with care to avoid 
drawing the sheath into the artery. The guide wire should remain in the renal artery 
until a selective renal arteriogram has been completed.  
• Perform post procedural imaging on the treated renal artery . 
• Treat the contralateral renal artery at this time if the Vessix  Reduce C atheter is 
appropriately- sized. If treatment of the contralateral renal artery requires a different 
balloon size, remove the Vessix Reduce Catheter , and insert an appropriately sized 
catheter . 
• Treat accessory renal arteries at this time if study anatomical criteria are met.  Ensure  
the Vessix  Reduce C atheter is appropriately -sized. If treatment of the accessory  renal 
artery requires a  different balloon size, rem ove the Vessix Reduce Catheter , and insert 
an appropriately sized cat heter . 
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Vessix Reduce Catheter Deflation and Removal  
• Slowly deflate the balloon to negative pressure.  
• Carefully retract the Vessix  Reduce Catheter through the guide sheath and out of the 
body.  
• Upon guide sheath removal , either manual compression or commercialized closure 
devices can be used to achieve hemostasis at the puncture site.  Standard-of- care post -
intervention monitoring proc edures should be followed. 
 
Angiographic images must be sent to the angiographic core laboratory for evaluation. 
NOTE:  Re-treatment with renal denervation is not allowed through the protocol follow -

14.2. General Statistical Methods 
14.2.1. Analysis Sets  
The primary and pre-specified additional assessments will be analyzed on an intent- to-treat 
(ITT) basis and on a per-protocol basis. For the ITT analysis, all subjects who sign the 
written ICF and are randomized in the study will be  included in the analysis population, 
regardless of whether the subjects receive the assigned treatment .  For the per -protocol 
analysis, only randomized subj ects who meet the eligibility criteria and receive the assigned 
treatment will be  included in the analysis population.   
The ITT population will be the primary analysis set for the purpose of assessing superiority of Test to Control for 8- week average [ADDRESS_964051] of 
random treatment allocations (i.e., a randomization schedule) will be used to assign subjects 
to treatment s in a 2:[ADDRESS_964052]’s site. 
Random permuted blocks of varying sizes will be employed to ensure approximate balance 
of treatment allocation within each site. 
14.2.3. Control of Systematic Error/Bias  
Selection of subjects will be made from the I nvestigators’ general or professional referral 
population. All subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria and having signed the ICF will be eligible to enroll in the study. Consecutively eligible subjects should be enrolled into 
the study to minimize selection bias. Study subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment group within  the investigat ional site. In determining subject eligibility for the study, the 
investigator’s assessment of imaging will be used. However, the Angiographic Core 
Laboratory will independently an alyze the angiograms for all renal denervation procedures 
and the data obtained from the core laboratory  will be used for analyses in order to control

14.2.4. Number of Subjects per Study Site  
Study sites will not be allowed to randomize more than 10 subjects without prior approval 
from the Sponsor (10% of the total number of randomized subjects). No center will be allow ed to enroll more than 20 subjects (20% of the total number of randomized subjects).   
14.3. Data Analyses 
Baseline data will be summarized by [CONTACT_709084] t he randomized study. Subject 
demographics, clinical history, procedure assessment, and medication compliance will be summarized using descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, n, minimum, maximum) for continuous variables and frequency tables for discrete variables. The analysis unit may be (but will not be limited to) by [CONTACT_1130], cathete r, or treatment.  
Test and Control in the randomized study will be compared as needed with a Chi -square test 
or a Fisher exact test for discrete variables and a Student t -Test for  continuous variables. The 
differences between Test and Control in the random ized study  and their 95% confidence 
intervals will be presented as needed.  
14.3.1. Additional Assessments/Measurements  
No formal tests of hypotheses will be  performed for additional assessments. Statistical 
comparisons may be performed for exploratory purposes. No inferences are planned on the additional assessments and therefore alpha -adjustments for multiple comparisons will not be 
used.

 this program requires dynamic collection of unmonitored data as soon as the event is 
reported. This is expedited through BSC’s s afety team , which is responsible for coordinating 
the collection of information for the subject dossier from the centers and core laboratories. During regularly scheduled monitoring visits, clinical research monitors will support the dynamic reporting process through their review of source document information. 
24.2. Data Monitoring Committee  
The independent Data Monitoring Committee (DM C) is responsible for the oversight review 
of all AEs. The DMC will include leading experts in peripheral interventions or interventional cardiology, hypertension, and biostatistics who are not participating in the study and who have no affiliation with BSC. During the course of the study, the DMC will review accumulating safety data to monitor the incidence of CEC events and other trends that would warrant modification or termination of the study.  Responsibilities, qualifications, membership and committee procedures are outlined in the DMC Charter.  
Interim data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_709086] .  Any DMC 
recommendations for study modification or termination because of concerns over subject safety or issues relating to data monitoring or quality control will be submitted in writing to the BSC. In consultation with the Study Coordinating Principal Investigators, BSC will evaluate the recommendation and make a final decision.   However, if the DMC at any time 
determines that a potentially serious risk exists to subjects in this study, the DMC chairman will immediately notify BSC.  
24.3. Clinical Events Committee  
An independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) is an independent group of individuals with pertinent expertise that reviews and adjudicates  important endpoints and relevant 
adverse events reported by [CONTACT_2792]. The CEC will review a safety event dossier, which may include copi[INVESTIGATOR_123321], depending on event timing for, reported case of renal failure, embolic event, vascular complications, renal dissection, renal stenosis, hypertensive crisis, severe hypotension/syncope and death.

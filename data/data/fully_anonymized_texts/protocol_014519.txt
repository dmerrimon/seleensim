Induced Hypogonadism.  After the baseline period, participants will 
receive their first injection of the gonadotropin -releasing hormone 
(GnRH) agonist leuprolide acetate (Lupron) 3.75 mg/month via 
intramuscular injection, which is administered to produce a stable 
hypogonadal co ndition (after the initial “flair”). The first Lupron 
3 
  injection will be administered on day six of the participants’ first 
menstrual cycle after the baseline period and at monthly intervals 
thereafter until follow -up. During the month of GnRH agonist 
admin istration, all participants will receive placebo progesterone 
and placebo estradiol tablets and will be told that at some point

Addback.  After the fourth week of Lupron -alone treatment (i .e., 
hypogonadism), high plasma levels of estradiol and progesterone 
will be attained via micronized progesterone  and estradiol tablets 
for two  weeks (with continued Lupron administration). Estradiol 
will be administered at a dose of 2 mg bid  (i.e., a total of 4 mg per 
day). Progesterone will be administered at a dose of 200 mg bid  
(i.e., a total of 400 mg per day) . The blood levels that we expect to 
achieve and sustain in each woman will be approximately 500 
pg/ml of estradiol and 30 -40 ng/ml of proges terone.   
 
Withdrawal.  After two weeks of hormone replacement, active 
hormone tablets will be replaced with placebo tablets to induce a

Lupron will maintain hypogonadal levels for the two-week 
withdrawal phase. The second fMRI session will take place at the 
beginning of the withdrawal period.

Statistical 
Methodology  This study has one between -subjects factor (group: HS+ versus 
HS-) crossed with one within -subjects factor (time:  baseline 
versus hormone addback) across each outcome (behavioral index 
or percent signal change in a particular region of interest ). Thus, 
for a task/ outcome combination , there is a 2 -by-2 repeated 
measures design.

  1       Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to US 
and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International 
Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research 
policies and procedures.  
1.[ADDRESS_435454] —defined as a predis position to exhibit anger  (Vidal -Ribas et al., 
2016)  and characterized by [CONTACT_350322] -avoidance motivation  (Leibenluft, 2017)  —which 
cuts across neuropsychiatric disorders, including bipolar  (American Psychiatri c Association, 2013)  , 
depressive  (Fava et al., 2010; Perlis et al., 20 05), anxiety  (Leibenluft et al., 2006; P rice & Stolk -Cooke, 
2015) , trauma -related (Price & Stolk -Cooke, 2015; Van Voorhees et al., 2018) , psychotic  (Bilgi et al., 
2017; Penn et al., 1996) , neurodevelopmental  (McGuire et al., 2016) , neurocognitive  (Alper et al., 2002; 
Lopez et al., 2003) , and personality disorders (Scott et al., 2015) . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_350250], the neural dysfunction underlying the vulnerability to, onset of, and exacerbation of 
irritability is und erstudied and poorly understood (Leibenluft, 2017) . Although not included in the DSM 
criteria, irritability is increasingly being recognized as a prominent, defining symptom of perinatal 
depression (PND)  (Williamson et al., 2015) . The perinatal period (i.e., pregnancy and first month 
following childbirth) is characterized by [CONTACT_350323], marked changes in the female reproductive 
hormones estradio l and progesterone, which powerfully regulate approach -avoidance motivation 
(Schiller, Johnson, Abate, Schmidt, & Rubinow, 2016 ). Given that app roach -avoidance dysregulation is 
implicated in irr itability (Leibenluft, 2017) , PND offers a unique opportunity to identify physiological 
regulators of irritability in women.  However, studying women with PND is challenging for two reasons. 
First, the existence of multiple putative etiologic pathways (i.e., vulnerability to the effects of hormonal 
change versus the psychosocial stress of childbirth) resul ts in a heterogeneous phenotype (Postpartum 
Depression: Action Towards Causes and Treatment (PACT) Consortium, 2015) . Second, there are 
obvious logistical problems entailed in studying a mother who is depressed and requires treatment. A 
solution to these problems is provided by [CONTACT_350324] -
pregnant, euthymic women to create a scaled down version of the changes that o ccur during and after 
pregnancy (Bloch et al., 2000) . 
 
We have used this manipulation to identify a subgroup of “hormone sensitive” women in whom 
perinatal -like changes in reproductive hormones precipi[INVESTIGATOR_350251], 
the most prominent and immediate of which was irritability (me asured by [CONTACT_350325] —IDAS -II) (see Section 1.4  below). However, that study focused on anhedonia 
and dysphoria, and given that the primacy of irritability was unexpected (i.e., irritability is neither a 
diagnostic crite rion of PND  (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) nor included in the gold -standard 
self-report instrument of PND severity  (J. L. Cox, Holden, & Sagovsky, 1987 ), yet recent research 
suggests it is, in fact, the cardinal symptom of PND  (Williamson et al., 2015) , the fMRI tasks were not 
selected to investigate irritability. Irritability has been conceptualized as an aberrant “approach” 
response both to potential threat, mediated by [CONTACT_350326] -limbic circuit dysfunction, and to frustration, 
mediated by [CONTACT_350327] (Leibenluft, 2017) . The threat hypothesis of irritability posits that 
5 
  dysregulation in the amygdala -hypot halamic -periaqueductal gray (PAG) threat response circuitry 
results in approach behavior in response to threat rather than freezing or flight (Blair, 2016; Salum et 
al., 2017) . 
 
Evidence supporting the threat hypothesis of irritability includes: 1) irritability is associated with anxiety 
in cross -sectional (Stringaris et al., 200 9), longitudinal (Savage et al., 2015; Stringaris et al., 2009) , and 
genetic studies (Savage et al., 2015) , 2) irritability is characterized by [CONTACT_350328] (Stoddard et al., 2017) , and 3) irritability 
is associated with dysfunctional threat processing, including attention bias toward threatening faces 
(Hommer et al., 2014; Salum et al., 2017 ). A related but distinct process is dysfunctional reward 
processing, specifically pertaining to aberrant responses to frustrative nonreward (FNR). FNR is 
defined as reactions induced by [CONTACT_350329] t one has been conditioned 
to expect, and the frustration hypothesis of irritability predicts increased approach behavior (i.e., 
aggression), relative to peers, in response to FNR (Brotman et al., 2017) . Evidence supporting the 
frustration hypothesis of irritability i ncludes: 1) compared with healthy controls, irritable children report 
greate r frustration in response to FNR (Deveney et al., 2013 ), 2) irritable children respond in an 
aggressive manner toward others, including in  response to ambiguous behavior (Vitaro et al., 2006) , 
and 3) irritable children show dysregulation of the amygdala and striatum in response to FNR (Deveney 
et al., 2013) . Thus, both threat and reward processing are implicated in irritability, and the concepts 
(i.e., Gray's Fear = frustration model (Gray, 1987) ) and neural syst ems implicated are interrelated 
(McNaughton & Corr, 2004)  and consistent with a dysregulated behav ioral approach -avoidance system 
(Leibenluft, 2017) . However, critical gaps remain: th is work been done almost exclusivel y with children 
and adolescents (Leibenluft, 2017) , and the extent to which it generalizes to irritability in adults is 
unclear; few studies have tested both the threat and frustration hypotheses concurrently, whi ch has 
precluded an integrated neural systems model; and to our knowledge, none of the existing studies has 
attempted to distinguish state from trait irritability in terms of clinical presentation, course, or underlying 
neurobiology in adult women.  The pro posed research will address all three of these gaps in the 
literature.  
 
The objective of the current study is to determine whether hormone sensitive women (HS+; n=15) show 
differences in the behavioral activation system relative to non -hormone sensitive wo men (HS -; n=15) 
under baseline and hormone challenge conditions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
and behavioral tests. In essence, with a hormonal manipulation strategy, we will induce a physiologic 
condition that enables us to both provo ke the effect of interest (i.e., irritability) and then, with behavioral 
challenges, identify the systems substrate using neuroimaging. Subjects serve as their own controls 
across time, carrying with  them varying levels of trait vulnerability to irritabili ty and then expressing an 
irritable mood state, also with varying degrees of severity. This approach will therefore allow us to 
disentangle the neural substrates of the vulnerability to, onset of, and exacerbation of irritability while 
simultaneously testi ng both the threat and frustration hypotheses of irritability, which will change the 
field in two important ways: First, this novel manipulation will allow us to create a reversible condition 
simulating both the prominent symptom of irritability and the ho rmonal state that precipi[INVESTIGATOR_350252]. By 
[CONTACT_350330], we can be assured that the hormone -related 
irritability phenotype is selected and exploited for investigation of the  underlying systems neurobiology 
of irritability. Seco nd, the outcome of this project is expected to be a greater understanding of irritability 
[ADDRESS_435455] measure (J. L. Cox et al., 1987 ) for screening in clinical contexts (E. Q. Cox 
et al., 2017)  and for quantifyin g severity in research contexts (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_89102]., 2016)  doesn’t assess 
irritability. Thus, this research has the potential not only to provide critical information about the neural 
systems underlying irritability, one of the most pervasive neuropsych iatric symptoms, but also to 
provide important information about irritability in the context of PND and other reproductive endocrine -
related mood disorders.

17β-diol. The structural formula is:  
 
 
 
Figure 1. Structural formula for  estra -1,3,5,(10) -triene -3, 17β -diol.  
 
Inactive Ingredients: Colloidal silicon dioxide, corn starch, dibasic calcium phosphate, lactose 
monohydrate, magnesium stearate, and sodium starch glycolate. In addition, the 1 mg also contains 
FD&C blue no. 1 alumi num lake and D&C red no. 27 aluminum lake. The 2 mg also contains FD&C 
blue no. 1 aluminum lake and FD&C yellow no. 5 (tartrazine) aluminum lake.  
 
Pharmacology  
Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female 
reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a 
dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human 
estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabol ites, estrone and estriol at the receptor level.  
 
The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 
[ADDRESS_435456] been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.  
Circulating estrogens modulate the pi[INVESTIGATOR_350253], luteinizing hormone (LH) 
and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to 
reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.  
  
LUPRON DEPOT  
  
Description  
Leuprolide acet ate is a synthetic nonapeptide analog of naturally occurring gonadotropin -releasing 
hormone (GnRH or LH -RH). The analog possesses greater potency than the natural hormone. The 
chemical name [CONTACT_832] 5 -oxo-L-prolyl -L-histidyl -L-tryptophyl -L-seryl -L-tyrosyl -D-leucyl-L-leucyl -L-arginyl -N-

D-leucyl -L-leucyl -L-arginyl -N-ethyl -prolinamide acetate).  
 
LUPRON DEPOT is available in a prefilled dual -chamber syringe containing sterile lyophilized 
microspheres which, when mixed with diluent, become a suspension intended as a monthly 
intramuscular injection.  
 
The front chamber of LUPRON DEPOT 3.75 mg prefilled dual -chamber syringe contains leuprolide 
acetate (3.75 mg), purified gelatin (0.65 mg), DL -lactic and glycolic acids copolymer (33.1 mg), and D -
mannitol (6.6 mg). The second chamber of diluent contains ca rboxymethylcellulose sodium (5 mg), D -
mannitol (50 mg), polysorbate 80 (1 mg), water for injection, USP, and glacial acetic acid, USP to 
control pH. During the manufacture of LUPRON DEPOT 3.[ADDRESS_435457], leaving the 
peptide.  
Pharmacology  
Leup rolide acetate is a long -acting GnRH analog. A single monthly injection of LUPRON DEPOT 3.75 
mg results in an initial stimulation followed by a prolonged suppression of pi[INVESTIGATOR_350254].  
 

8 
  Repeated dosing at monthly intervals results in decreased sec retion of gonadal steroids; consequently, 
tissues and functions that depend on gonadal steroids for their maintenance become quiescent. This 
effect is reversible on discontinuation of drug therapy.  
Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally. Intram uscular injection of the depot formulation 
provides plasma concentrations of leuprolide over a period of one month.  
  
  
PROGESTERONE  
 
Description  
PROMETRIUM (progesterone, USP) Capsules contain micronized progesterone for oral administration. 
Progesterone has a molecular weight of 314.47 and a molecular formula of C21H30O2. Progesterone 
(pregn -4-ene-3, 20 -dione) is a white or creamy white, odorless, crystalline powder practically insoluble 
in water, soluble in alcohol, acetone and dioxane and sparingly solu ble in vegetable oils, stable in air, 
melting between 126° and 131°C. The structural formula is:  
 
 
Figure 3. Structural formula for progesterone, USP (pregn -4-ene-3, 20 -dione)  
 
Progesterone is synthesized from a starting material from a plant source and i s chemically identical to 
progesterone of human ovarian origin. PROMETRIUM Capsules are available in multiple strengths to 
afford dosage flexibility for optimum management. PROMETRIUM Capsules contain 100 mg or 200 mg 
micronized progesterone.

glycerin USP, lecithin NF, titanium dioxide USP, D&C Yellow No. 10, and FD&C Yellow No. 6.  
Pharmacology  
PROMETRIUM Capsules are an oral dosage form of micronized progesterone which is chemically 
identical to progesterone of ovarian origin. The oral b ioavailability of progesterone is increased through 
micronization.  
Summary of Previous Human Experience  

9 
  The proposed monthly 3.75 -mg injection of leuprolide acetate (Lupron Depot) is FDA -approved for use 
in premenopausal women to treat endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Lupron has also been widely 
researched in healthy premenopausal women  (Flory et al., 2002; Grigorova et al., 2006; Matthews et 
al., 1998; Sánchez et al., 2002)  and to treat a variety of conditions, including ovarian epi [INVESTIGATOR_350255] (Thompson et al., 1991) , insulin resistance (Elkind -Hirsch, Valdes, & Malinak, 1993 ), endometrial 
stromal sarcoma  (Scribner Jr. & Walker, 1998) , and infertility  (Padilla et al., 1991) . 
 
Several studies have investigated the use of Lupron and hormone addback to treat the symptoms of 
premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysph oric disorder (Lee et al., 2012; Mitwally et al.,  2002; 
Schmidt et al., 1998; Wyatt et al., 2004) , which has resulted in combined Lupron and 
estrogen/progestin supplementation as a recommended long -term treatment f or premenstrual 
syndrome (Kaur et al., 2004; Mezrow et a l., 1994) . 
 
Healthy women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) routinely receive luteal supplementation of 600 mg 
progesterone daily along with 6 mg oral micronized estradiol  (Lukaszuk et al., 2005)  in combination with 
GnRH agonists (e.g., Lupron).  
 
GnRH agonist treatment combined with hormone addback (i.e., high -dose estradiol  and progesterone 
supplementation) has been previously studied in large randomized controlled trials  for the purpose of 
IVF (Bourgain et al., 1990; Damario et al., 1999; Fatemi et al., 2006; Frie dler et al., 1999; Humaidan et 
al., 2005; Lukaszuk et al., 2005) .  Of particular relevance to the current study, researchers induced a 
hypogonadal state using 3.75 mg Decapeptyl, followed by [CONTACT_5019] -dose (800 mg) oral progesterone 
treatment in 32 women wit hout an adverse event (Friedler et al., 1999) . Several studies have examined 
the use of combined Lupron treatment (1 mg daily or 3.75 mg monthly),  oral micronized estradiol (max 
doses ranged from 4 mg to 9 mg daily), and either oral (900 mg daily), vaginal (90 -600 mg daily), or IM 
(50-200 mg daily) progesterone administration in over 1800 healthy women (Bourgain et al., 1990; 
Bustillo et al., 1995; Damario et al., 1999; Engmann et al., 2008; Friedler et al., 1999; Legro et al., 
1993; F. Licciardi et al., 2001; F. L. Lic ciardi et al., 1999; Mirkin et al., 2003; Nagy et al., 2009; Noyes et 
al., 2001; Paulson et al., 1997; Peress & Philips, 1998; Sauer et al., 1992; Tao & Tamis, 1997; Tonguc 
et al., 2011) . Of note, Da mario et al. (Damario et al., 1999)  reported the use of combined Lupron 
treatment, [ADDRESS_435458]. Rubinow’s team at the NIH has examined the combined administration of Lupron and 
estradiol/progestero ne in healthy premenopausal women in several studies without a significant 
adverse event  (Berman et al., 1997; Bloch et al., 2005; Daly et al., 2001; Roca et al., 2003; Schmidt et 
al., 2009)  Moreover, the same drug protocol proposed in the current study has been employed 
previously by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Rubinow’s research team at the NIH (Bloch et al., 2005)  and is currently being used in 
ongoing projects at the NIH under the direction of [CONTACT_350435] and [CONTACT_350436] rtinez.   
 
Thus, a large number of healthy women have previously received combined Lupron with high -dose oral 
estradiol and progesterone supplementation either as part of a research study or routine IVF treatment 
without significant side effects or adverse events.

1.3      Preclinical Data  
N/A 
1.[ADDRESS_435460]. Rubino w’s team at the NIH previously employed the proposed 
protocol to examine reproductive -related affective dysfunction in 16 women (Bloch et al., 2000) . Women 
with a history of postpartum depression showed significant increases in depressive symptoms during 
both hormone addback and withdrawal compared with baseline, whereas the control group did not  
(Bloch et al., 2000) . To our knowledge, this was the first direct evidence to support the involvement of 
ovarian hormones in the development of PND in a sub group of susceptible women. We replicated this 
finding in a larger group of women (N=30; 15 with a history of PND and 15 controls without such a 
history) and included both fMRI and more comprehensive depression and anxiety assessments, which 
revealed that the mood changes in HS+ are primarily driven by [CONTACT_350331].  
 
Recruitment and Retention.  Our successful completion of the previous study (N=30) involving the 
proposed hormone challenge and neuroimaging demonstrates both the feasibility of the pr oposed 
protocol and our ability to recruit and retain participants . Participants were recruited primarily via social 
media (57%) and other online recruitment tools (30%). Of those who began the hormone protocol, only 
3 women (9%) dropped out: one who exper ienced a traumatic life event and consequent psychiatric 
symptoms unrelated to the study, and two because of logistical problems involved with attending 
biweekly study visits at UNC Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Consequent to these dropouts, we modified the protocol to 
conduc t all biweekly study visits in participants’ homes, which subsequently improved retention. We 
have estimated an equivalent attrition rate in the current study despi[INVESTIGATOR_350256], which will likely reduce attrition. Of 
note, none of the women in this or any of [CONTACT_187951]’s previous studies employing hormone challenge 
protocols experienced serious adverse events . 
 
Use of the Hormone Challenge Protocol to Provoke Irritability  and Dysregulate Striatum in HS+.  
Women with a history of PND reported increased irritability, anxiety, dysphoria, and anhedonia during 
the hormone challenge. Eleven out of 15 (73%) women with a history of PND were HS+ (i.e., showed a 
30% increase in IDAS -II affective symptoms during early addback, late addback, or withdrawal 
compared with baseline). Irritability was the primary symptom for the majority (72%) of HS+, and 
because irritability distinguished HS+ and HS - as early as 2 weeks into hormone addback  (t=2.97, 
p<.004; Figure 4), we propose to truncate hormone addback in the current study to 2 weeks (down from 
8 weeks in the previous study) and conduct the second fMRI at that time. During the monetary incentive 
delay (MID) task, there was a significant group x time interaction in the bilateral putamen ( F=5.9, 
11 
  
p<.022), such that HS - showed greater activation than HS+ during hormone withdrawal ( t(26)=2.8, 
p<.01) but not at baseline ( t(26)= -0.6, p=.54) (see Figure 5).  
 
  
Figure 4. Irritability self -ratings during each study 
phase.  HS+ ( n=11) showed significantly increased 
irritability at early addback, compared with baseline 
and compared with HS - (n=14). The early addback 
assessment occurred 2 after two weeks of hormone 
addback (plus Lupron). Symbols:  fMRI session.  Figure 5. Percent signal change in bilateral 
putamen activity during monetary reward at 
baseline and during hormone withdrawal. 
Consist ent with the literature, as HS+ ( n=11) became 
depressed, they showed reduced striatal activation to 
reward, compared with HS - (n=14; non -depressed) . 
 
1.5      Dose Rationale and Risk s/Benefits  
 
Dose Rationale  
 
The rationale for the dose of each drug administered in the proposed study is based on the study 
referenced immediate above. As shown in Figure 4, we found a statistically significant difference in 
irritability between HS+ and HS - after only [ADDRESS_435461] two weeks of hormone 
addback involved doses (2 mg E2 bid and 200 mg P4 bid), which were half that given in the last 6 
weeks of hormone addb ack. Based on these data, our proposed hormone addback protocol will include 
2 mg E2 bid and 200 mg P4 bid for a period of 2 weeks. This shorted addback period will further allow 
us to reduce the number of Lupron injections from 4 in the previous protocol to 2 in the current protocol. 
Thus the  drug protocol, including the route of administration, dosage, dosage regimen, and dosage 
period, mirrors a truncated version of our previous study which included a 7 -month -long hormone 
manipulation protocol that inclu ded higher dose hormones and a previous study conducted at the NIH, 
which both successfully modeled the hormonal events of pregnancy and parturition and precipi[INVESTIGATOR_350257]  (Bloch et al., 2000, 2005) . 
 
Risks/Benefits

timepoint for 
addback fMRI  

[ADDRESS_435462] any adverse side effects associated with the hormonal manipulations outlined in this 
protocol for the following reasons: First, we will be administering the physiologically relevant steroid 
hormones (e stradiol and progesterone) and not the substituted steroids (such as ethinyl estradiol or 
norethindrone) present in many oral contraceptives and which have been reported to have a potentially 
more serious profile of side effects.  Second, the doses of Lupr on, estradiol and progesterone, and the 
duration for which they will be administered in this protocol, will result in plasma hormone levels 
comparable to those commonly used for in vitro fertilization (IVF) protocols lasting 1 -3 months.  
Therefore, based o n current IVF procedures we do not anticipate any adverse incidents arising from the 
proposed doses of estradiol and progesterone (Chetko wski et al., 1986; Rice et al., 1993; Saleh et al., 
1995) . Third, no adverse reactions or events were encountered in past studies conducted with this 
protocol in [CONTACT_187951]’s lab at the NIH. Finally, comparable extended, uninterrupted gonadal steroid 
treatment (such as oral contraceptives) for 6 to 12 weeks has been shown to be well -tolerated (Sulak e t 
al., 1997) . 
 
Lupron : The most frequent adverse effect of Lupron is hot flushes (flashes) reportedly occurring in 4 -
89% of patients receiving the drug.  Lupron -induced hot flushes have ranged in severity from 
occasional mild flushing to frequent sweating.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_350258]; however, in at least one study, the incidence of hot flushes 
did not appear to decrease with continued therapy.  In a recently completed study of [ADDRESS_435463] common side effects reported to occur were 
as follows: 1) hot flashes of mild to moderate intensity (89%), 2) headache (22% ), 3) nervousness or 
irritability (11%), and 4) insomnia (10%).  Local irritation at the injection site was complained of in less 
than 10% of the patients in this sample, and there was a mean decrease in bone density, as measured 
by [CONTACT_232766], of 3 .4 to 4.0%, which totally reversed after the medication had been 
discontinued for six months.  Approximately ten patients of the original sample of [ADDRESS_435464] injection of depot Lupron (Tapp Pharmaceuticals, 
personal communication).  Blurred vision, myalgias, lethargy, memory disorder, and numbness have 
been reported in less than 3% of patients receiving the drug.  Thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolus, 
and congestive heart failure have occurred rarely in patients receiving Lupron, but a causal relationship 
to the drug has not been established.  Adverse GI effects occurring in 2% or more of patient s receiving 
Lupron include nausea and/or vomiting, constipation, and anorexia.  Diarrhea and a sour or unusual 
taste in the mouth have been reported less frequently.  Other adverse effects of Lupron occurring in 
less than 3% of patients include decreased h ematocrit and hemoglobin concentration, fatigue, fever, 
facial swelling, rash, hives, hair loss, and itching.  From our experiences with a longer protocol using 
the same medications in 15 women with a history of [COMPANY_003] and 15 controls, Lupron is well tolerate d (no 
dropouts) with the most common side effect being hot flushes.  Limited information is available on the 
acute toxicity of Lupron.  Following subcutaneous administration of Lupron in rats at dosages 250 -500 
times the usual human dosage, dyspnea, decrea sed activity, and local irritation at the injection site 
were observed; however, there is no evidence to date that overdosage in humans produces similar 
adverse effects.  Lupron dosages up to [ADDRESS_435465].  Recent longitudinal follow -up studies of girls and boys 
13 
  receiving GnRH agonists as a treatment for precocious puberty repo rt the development of normal 
reproductive function, skeletal growth, and fertility  (Feuillan et al., 1999, 2000) .            
 
Estradiol : Nausea is the most common side effect of estrogen administration.  At conventional 
replacement doses, higher than those employed in this protocol, this complaint seldom interferes with 
eating, an d no weight loss has been reported.  Breast engorgement, endometrial hyperplasia and 
bleeding are also common side effects of estrogen administration.  Pre -existing fibroid tumors of the 
uterus may enlarge under the effects of estrogen; however, at the dos age and for the duration of 
estrogen administration in this protocol this risk is small.  
 
The relationship between estrogen, both endogenous and exogenous, and the development of 
endometrial carcinoma has been suggested by [CONTACT_292247] d ifferent lines of investigation (Gambrell, 1986) . 
Numerous retrospective case control studies published since [ADDRESS_435466] that the optimal regimen to prevent hyperplasia during long term ERT and thus, 
inferentially, the risk of carcinoma, consists of 12 to 13 days of progestero ne treatment each month 
when estrogens are administered (Nieman & Loriaux, 1992) . There is an increase in thromboembolism 
in women receiving non -contraceptive estrogen therapy  (Cushman et al., 2004; Daly et al., 2001; F. 
Grodstein et al., 1996; Jick et al., 1996) . Additionally, some but not all studies repor t an increase in risk 
of stroke (Stampfer et al., 1991; Wassertheil -Smoller et al., 2003) in older women taking estrogen 
therapy. However, these complications are unlikely at the dose and duration of estrogen replacement 
employed in this protocol, and in the younger age group of women who particip ate in this study.  One 
study (Chetkowski et al.,  1986) reported no effect of the estrogen patch on the four clotting indices 
previously shown to be altered by [CONTACT_350332] (Mandel et al., 1983; Melis et al., 1984; 
Nieman & Loriaux, 1992) .  Blood pressure, on average, appears to be unaffected by [CONTACT_350333], 
although both increases and decreases have been reported.  In observational studies, p ost-
menopausal estrogen therapy has been observed to lower the relative risk of cardiovascular disease in 
some but not all studies  (Barrett -Connor & Bush, 1991; Stampfer et al., 1991) . In contrast, re cent 
randomized controlled trials in older postmenopausal women (e.g., Women’s Health Initiative [WHI]) 
report an increased  risk of cardiovascular disease (Manson et al., 2003) . Emerging data suggest that 
these disparities in findings may be related to the timing of initiation of estrogen therapy in relation to 
the proximity of menopause.  Subgroup analyses of the combined estrogen and progestin (EP T) arm of 
the WHI demonstrated a significant interaction between coronary heart disease (CHD) risk and time 
since initiation of EPT, with an increased risk in the early years following initiation and a decreased risk 
in later years. Additionally, the incre ased risk of CHD was observed in older but not younger 
perimenopausal women  (Francine Grodstein et al., 2006; Hsia et al., 2006; Lobo,  2004; Manson et al., 
2003; Prentice et al., 2005, 2006) . High doses of oral estrogens have been reported to elevate 
hepatocellular enzyme levels and, less commonly, cause cholestatic jaundice. The risk for gallstones 
and hepatocellular adenomas has bee n reported to be increased in association with oral contraceptive 
14 
  use, and although uncommon these complications may also occur with the use o f replacement doses of 
estrogen (Cirillo et al., 2005; Petitti et al., 1988) . Estrogen therapy also may increase the risk of urinary 
incontinence in older postmenopausal women  (F. Grodstein et al., 2004; Hendrix et al., 2005; Steinauer 
et al., 2005) . Further, most studies have suggested an increased relative risk of breast cancer after four 
or five years' use (Beral, 1997; Chen et al., 2006; Chlebowski et al., 2003; Colditz et al., 1995; Gann & 
Morrow, 2003; Grady & Ernster, 1991; Li et al., 2003; Rossouw et al., 2002; Stefanick et al., 2006; 
Sturmer & Manson, 2004; Wingo et al., 1987) , similar to the risk expected if the onset of menopause 
was delayed for a comparable length of time. Due to the publicity surrounding the cancellation of the 
treatment arm of the Women’s Health Initiative study (Rossouw et al., 2002)  that involved the 
administration of combined conjugated estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate (Prempro), we 
have included the following statement in the consent documents:  
 
Adverse Events Related to Combined Hormone Replacement and the Results of the Women's Health 
Initiat ive (WHI): The WHI study demonstrated that continuous administration of one form of estrogen 
(conjugated estrogens) in combination with one form of progesterone (medroxyprogesterone acetate) is 
associated with an increased risk of dementia, heart attacks, stroke, blood clots, and breast cancer.  
Estradiol, the form of estrogen that we use in this study, is administered as a sole agent (with the 
exception of one week's combination with progesterone) and, consequently, we do not expect that it will 
pose the i ncreased risks observed with the chronic combination of the conjugated estrogens and 
medroxyprogesterone administered in the WHI study.  Indeed, while the estrogen alone arm of the WHI 
trial was shown to be associated with an increased risk of stroke, no i ncreased risk of either heart 
disease or breast cancer was observed (Anderson et al., 200 4; Rossouw et al., 2002) . Estrogens may 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_350259], and depression has also been reported to occur with the use of 
estrogens. In general, considering the dose and duration of treatment that we propose to use in this 
protocol, the ris k of developi[INVESTIGATOR_350260].  
 
Progesterone : Progesterone and the synthetic progestins are widely prescribed, with indications 
including dysfunctional uterine bleeding, endometriosis, mastodynia, galactorrhea, and precocious 
puberty  (Henzel, 1986) .  Side effects reported in women taking progestins may include breakthrough 
bleeding, edema, change in weight (increase or decrease), cholest atic jaundice, rash (with or without 
pruritus), depression, easy fatigue and sedation, lack of initiative, and chloasma.  Since progestins are 
often used in women with antecedent menstrual irregularity, it is not clear whether the breakthrough 
bleeding rep resents an effect of the medication or refractoriness to treatment.  In the large majority of 
patients, menstruation occurs predictably following withdrawal of progestins and is usually more regular 
than in spontaneous cycles.  In a recent study, an averag e dose of [ADDRESS_435467] been associated with the estradiol 
component of the oral contraceptive. Thromboembolic disorders including thrombop hlebitis, pulmonary 
15 
  embolism, and cerebral and coronary thrombosis appear to occur with greater frequency in women 
taking oral contraceptives.  While the increased incidence of these disorders has been associated with 
the estradiol component of the oral co ntraceptives, it is now believed that the progestogen component 
may, to a lesser extent, contribute to the increased risk.  There are relatively few reports associating 
oral contraceptives with the development of carcinomas (vaginal, uterine, hepatic, and mammary) 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_350261], although this may reflect the latent period needed for cellular 
transformation.  Finally, several reports suggest an association between intrauterine exposure to 
female sex hormones and congenital anomalies . 
 
Lupron, Estradiol, and Progesterone Combined Administration:  As discussed in Section 1.2, the 
proposed monthly 3.75 -mg injection of leuprolide acetate (Lupron Depot) is FDA -approved for use in 
premenopausal women to treat endometriosis and uterine fibroids . Lupron has also been widely 
researched in healthy premenopausal women (Flory et al., 2002; Grigorova et al., 2006; Matthews et 
al., 1998; Sánchez et al., 2002) and to treat a variety of conditions, including  ovarian epi[INVESTIGATOR_350255] (Thompson et al., 1991) , insulin resistance (Elkind -Hirsch et al., 1993 ), endo metrial stromal 
sarcoma (Scribner Jr. & Walker, 1998) , and infertility (Padilla et al., 1991) .Several studies have 
investigated the use of Lupron and hormone a ddback to treat the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome 
and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (Lee et al., 2012; Mitwally et al., 2002; Wyatt et al., 2004) , which 
has resulted in combined Lupron and estrogen/progestin supplementation as a recommended long -
term treatment for premenstrual syndrome (Kaur et al., 2004; Mezrow et al., 1994) .Healthy women 
undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) routinely receive luteal supplementation of 600 mg progesterone 
daily along with 6 mg oral micronized estradiol  (Lukaszuk et al., 2005)  in combination with GnRH 
agonists (e.g., Lupron).   
 
GnRH agonist treatment combined with hormone a ddback (i.e., high -dose estradiol and progesterone 
supplementation) has been previously studied in large randomized controlled trials  for the purpose of 
IVF (Damario et al., 1999; Fatemi et al., 2006; Friedler et al., 1999; Humaidan et al., 2005; Lukaszuk et 
al., 2005) .  Of particular relevance to the current study, researchers induced a hypogonadal state using 
3.75 mg Decapeptyl, fol lowed by [CONTACT_5019] -dose (800 mg) oral progesterone treatment in 32 women without 
an adverse event  (Friedler et al., 1999) . Several studies have examine d the use of combined Lupron 
treatment (1 mg daily or 3.75 mg monthly), oral micronized estradiol (max doses ranged from 4 mg to 9 
mg daily), and either oral (900 mg daily), vaginal (90 -600 mg daily), or i.m. (50 -200 mg daily) 
progesterone administration i n over 1800 healthy women  (Bourgain et al., 1990; Bustillo et al., 1995; 
Daly et al., 2001; Damario et al., 1999; Engmann et al., 2008; Friedler et al., 1999; Legro et al., 1993; F. 
Licciardi et al., 2001; F. L. Licc iardi et al., 1999; Mirkin et al., 2003; Nagy et al., 2009; Noyes et al., 
2001; Paulson et al., 1997; Peress & Philips, 1998; Roca et al., 2003; Sauer et al., 1992; Tao & Tamis, 
1997; Tonguc et al., 2011) . Of note, Damario et al.  (1999)  reported the use of combined Lupron 
treatment,  [ADDRESS_435468]. Rubinow’s team at the NIH has examined the combined administration of Lupron and 
estradiol/progesterone in healthy premenopausal women in several st udies without a significant 
adverse event  (Berman et al., 1997; Bloch et al., 2005; Daly et al., 2001; Roca et al., 2003; Schmidt et 
al., 2009) . Moreover, t he same drug protocol proposed in the current study has been employed 
[ADDRESS_435469]. Rubinow’s research team at the NIH  (Bloch et al., 2000, 2005)  
and is currently being used in ongoing projects at the NIH under the direction of [CONTACT_350435] and 
[CONTACT_350437]. Thus, a large number of healthy women have previously received combined 
Lupron with high -dose oral estradiol and progesterone suppl ementation either as part of a research 
study or routine IVF treatment without significant side effects or adverse events.  
The prior protocol most relevant to the current proposal is the trial we completed most recently, which 
used higher doses of hormones  (at least twice the doses of both E2 and P4 proposed here) and  for a 
longer duration (8 weeks versus 2 weeks) and was classified as IND exempt by [CONTACT_1622]. To clarify 
differences between the protocol described in our IND application and that proposed here , we have 
summarized the medication regimens in the table below.

hormone sensitive women (HS -; n=15) under baseline and hormone challenge conditions using 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral tests. Our central hypothesis  is that 
reproductive hormone changes are asso ciated with dysregulated threat and reward processing and 
consequent irritability in HS+. The rationale  for the proposed study is that employing a scaled down 
model of puerperal hormonal events permits the identification of a group of individuals homogeneo us 
for hormone sensitivity (HS+), hence creating the best  opportunity for disentangling the specific 
changes in brain function due to reproductive hormones (i.e., HS -) from those accompanying 
reproductive hormone -precipi[INVESTIGATOR_350262] (i.e., H S+). Because women will act as their 
own controls across time, this study design also allows for a powerful evaluation of state and trait 
variables that may contribute to irritability, including both threat processing and reward processing. 
Identifying bot h state and trait markers of irritability, and disentangling them from the effects of 
reproductive hormones on brain and behavior, will allow for the identification of neural substrates of 
irritability susceptibility that can be investigated across neurops ychiatric disorders. We plan to 
accomplish the objectives of this application by [CONTACT_172093]:  
 
 
Aim 1: To determine the extent to which irritability is characterized by [CONTACT_350339]+ and HS -. 
 
Hypothesis 1: We hypothesize that HS+ is characterized by [CONTACT_350340]. Given this hypothesis, we expect that:  
 
Hypothesis 1a: Compared with HS -, HS+ will show a grea ter degree of threat attention bias as 
measured by [CONTACT_350341].  
 
Hypothesis 1b: Compared with HS -, HS+ will show reduced amygdala -medial PFC connectivity 
in response to threatening stimuli during ho rmone addback relative to baseline.  
 
Hypothesis 1c (secondary): HS+ will show a significant association between self -reported 
irritability and 1) threat attention bias, and 2) amygdala -ventrolateral PFC connectivity during 
hormone addback.  
 
Aim 2: To determine the extent to which irritability is characterized by [CONTACT_350342]+ and HS -. 
 
Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize that HS+ is characterized by [CONTACT_350343] e context of non -
reward (i.e., when reward is expected). Given this hypothesis, we expect that:  
 
20 
  Hypothesis 2a: Compared with HS -, HS+ will show greater reactive aggression assessed with 
the Point Subtraction Paradigm during hormone addback relative to bas eline.  
 
Hypothesis 2b: Compared with HS -, HS+ will show reduced activation of the amygdala and 
ventral striatum in response to FNR during hormone addback relative to baseline.  
 
Hypothesis 2c (secondary): HS+ will show a significant association between self-reported 
irritability and 1) reactive aggression, and 2) striatal activation during hormone addback.

  3       Study Design  
3.1      General Design  
This is a double -blind, placebo controlled, longitudinal cohort -comparison study , single -center study 
using Lupron depot, estradiol, and progesterone to examine whether hormone sensitive women (HS+; 
n=15) show differences in the behavioral activation system relative to non -hormone sensitive women 
(HS-; n=15) under baseline and hormone challenge conditions u sing functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) and behavioral tests. This study will include [ADDRESS_435475] 8 weeks. Out of those 8 visits, 2 of them will require subjects to come to UNC’s campus for their 
MRI visits at BRIC, while the rest of the appointments will be done virtually through HIPAA compliant 
Zoom, Webex, or phone when zoom is not available. Out of these [ADDRESS_435476]’s home when possible (i.e. backyard, back porch, or screened porch). 
In the context of COVID -19, all participants and staff will complete the appropriate screening as 
recommen ded by [CONTACT_350344] -person contact. During in person visits 
participants and the study team will be required to wear masks at all times and maintain 6 feet distance 
when possible to minimize the possibility of COVID -19 transmission. Participants will undergo a scaled 
down hormonal model of pregnancy and parturition (using ovarian suppression with the GnRH agonist 
Lupron and hormone addback  with E2 and progesterone P4 ) in order to examine how hormones 
influence neural function and irri tability in experimentally confirmed HS+ and HS -. FMRI sessions will 
occur at baseline and following two weeks of hormone addback. The study timeline is depi[INVESTIGATOR_3075] 6, and the specific procedures that will take place are outlined in  Table 1  and deta iled below  in 
Section 6 .

  The primary endpoints for this aim are 1) threat attention bias assessed during the visual dot -probe 
paradigm, 2) amygdala -medial PFC connectivity in response to threatening faces on the implicit 
emotion face processing task in HS+ (compared with  HS-) during hormone challenge relative to 
baseline. The secondary endpoints for this aim are the 1) correlation between IDAS -II irritability and 
treat attention bias, and 2) correlation between IDAS -II irritability and amygdala -medial PFC 
connectivity in HS+.  
[ADDRESS_435477] Selection and Withdrawal  
4.1      Inclusion Criteria  
Participants will enroll healthy, euthymic 2 1-45 year old women with a history of postpartum depression 
(n=23) and women without such a history ( n=16). Only participants capable of giving informed consent 
will be enrolled. Participants will be compensated upon completion of the study.  
  
Inclusion Criteria.

an elevated plasma FSH level (> 14 IU/L) and with menstrual cycle variability of > 7 days 
different from their normal cycle length.  
● Pregnant women will be excluded from participation (patients will be warned not to beco me 
pregnant during the study and will be advised to employ barrier contraceptive methods), and 
women who become pregnant (although unlikely because of the hormone manipulation) will be 
withdrawn. The use of leuprolide acetate is not recommended during preg nancy. Prior to 
treatment, a complete physical, including a serum β -HCG test for pregnancy. Participants will be 
seen at the outpatient clinic on a regular biweekly basis. All participants will be required to use 
non-hormonal forms of birth control (e.g., barrier methods) to avoid pregnancy during this study. 
Participants will also undergo urine toxicology and pregnancy tests on the day of each of the 
two fMRI scans. If a woman becomes pregnant during the study, she will not complete the fMRI 
scan, and the hormone protocol will be discontinued.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_435479] Recruitment and Screening  
 
Methods of recruiting for this study include : 
 
We plan to use a similar recruitment strategy to that of our previous study (N=30) involving a 7 -month -
long hormone challenge  and two neuroimaging session. The core of our recruitment plan is to focus on 
the following resources:  
 
• Targeted social media advertising (e.g., Facebook, Instagram)  
• Monthly university -wide recruitment emails  
• Online classifieds (e.g., Craigslist)  
24 
  • Online research registries (ResearchMatch.org, Join the Conquest)  
• Research registry specific to [CONTACT_14817]’s and [CONTACT_187951]’s previous study involving hormone  
challenge and two neuroimaging sessions  
• Flyers in the community  
 
We also will partner with  the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute (NC TraCS) 
Data Access and Informatics Core to identify a cohort of UNC Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_350265]. UNC 
uses the EPIC electronic medical record system, which enables communication to potential research 
participants via email and through the MyChart patient interface. This makes communication with a 
large number of potential research participants cost effective and highly efficient because it will enable 
potential participants to access  our online screening tool simply by [CONTACT_18943] a link in their email or 
MyChart electronic message. Additionally, we will capi[INVESTIGATOR_142397]’s expertise in enrolling members of communities historically underrepresented in r esearch, 
including local American Indian tribes.  
 
Eligibility screening will include:  
● An initial phone or online screening that includes questions about past medical and mental 
health history to assess potential participants  eligibility based on the criteria listed in sections 
4.1 and 4.2.  
● Participants will undergo a Clinical and Health Screening process to determine whether they are 
healthy enough to participate in this study. This screening will include past medical and men tal 
health history and physical exam. During this evaluation, they will be asked questions about 
past and present psychiatric symptoms. They will also be asked to complete questionnaires 
about psychiatric symptoms. They may choose not to answer any or all of the questions for any 
reason.  
● Participants will complete a safety questionnaire to determine whether they have any foreign 
iron or steel metal objects in their bodies, such as a pacemaker, shrapnel, metal plate, or metal 
debris. If they have any such ob jects in their bodies, they cannot participate in the MRI session.  
●  All participants will receive a pregnancy test and urine drug screening. No pregnant women will 
be entered into the study, because the study drugs (Lupron, estrogen, and progesterone) may 
be associated with birth defects.  
4.[ADDRESS_435480] been implicated in the etiology of postpartum depression, some 
depressive reactions, including suicidal ideation, may o ccur during this protocol. However, based on 
25 
  experience with Lupron and estradiol/progesterone addback in women with menstrually -related mood 
disorders, we would expect mood symptoms to be of mild to moderate severity.  
Adverse mood symptoms, including suic idal ideation, will be monitored on a bi -weekly basis by 
[CONTACT_350345] ( IDAS -II). The IDAS -II will 
be scored during the study visit (before the patient leaves the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). IDAS -II Suicidality Scale 
scores of > [ADDRESS_435481] treatment are intolerable, drug 
treatment will be discontinued.  Additionally, study medication w ill be terminated in subjects that 
experience any grade 3 or higher adverse events that limit their activities of daily living, that cannot be 
otherwise addressed by [CONTACT_79146] a medication dose.  
  
In the event of three grade 3 or higher adverse events (i.e . a life threatening adverse event that may 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) possibly or definitely associated with the study intervention, the study will be 
suspended and the study’s Data and Safety Monitoring Board will be notified.  
 
The determination of when an d how to withdrawal subjects will be overseen by [CONTACT_1758]’s Data and 
Safety Monitoring Board and will be reported to the UNC Biomedical IRB.  
4.4.[ADDRESS_435482] to discontinue the hormone  protocol or are discontinued for safety reasons will 
be asked to continue to complete self -report ratings through the end of the proposed study period. 
However, fMRI exams will not be done if participants discontinue the hormone protocol.

Regimen  
  
Induced Hypogonadism (weeks 0 -4). After the baseline period, participants will receive their first 
injection of the gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist leuprolide acetate (Lupron) 3.75 
mg/month via intramuscular injection, which is admi nistered to produce a stable hypogonadal condition 
(after the initial “flair”). The first Lupron injection will be administered on day six of the participants’ first 
menstrual cycle after the baseline period and at monthly intervals thereafter until follow -up. During the 
first month of GnRH agonist administration, all participants will receive placebo progesterone and 
placebo estradiol tablets and will be told that at some point the placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_350266].            
  
Addback ( weeks 4 -6). After the month of Lupron -alone treatment (i.e., hypogonadism), high plasma 
levels of estradiol and progesterone will be attained via micronized progesterone and estradiol tablets 
for two weeks (with continued Lupron administration). Estradiol will be administered at a dose of 4 
mg/day. Progesterone will be administered at 400 mg/day. The blood levels that we expect to achieve 
and sustain in each woman will be approximately 500 pg/ml of estradiol and 30 -40 ng/ml of 
progesterone.   
  
Withdrawal ( weeks 6 -8). After two weeks of hormone replacement, active hormone tablets will be

Overview.  This is a double -blind, placebo controlled, longitudinal cohort -comparison study, single -
center study using Lupron depot, estradiol, and progesterone to examine whether hormone sensitive 
women (HS+; n=15) show differences in the behavioral activation system relative to non -hormone 
sensitive women (HS -; n=15) under baseline and hormone challenge conditions using functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral tests. This study will include [ADDRESS_435485] 8 weeks. Out of those 8 visits, 2 of them will require subjects to come to 
UNC’s campus for their MRI visits at BRIC, while the rest of the appointments will be done virtually

Participants.  Healthy, euthymic, unmedicated (including oral contraceptives), [ADDRESS_435488]. 
Schiller’s and Rubinow’s last NIH -sponsored study and with the social media advertising pi[INVESTIGATOR_350270]. All women will have one or more biological children and will be at least one year past 
their most recent chi ldbirth. In order to maximize the likelihood of identifying HS+, those with a history 
of PND must have a history of at least one epi[INVESTIGATOR_350271] -V major depression accompanied by 
[CONTACT_333255], with an onset within six weeks postpartum (Forty et al., 2006 ), and no history of DSM -V major 
depression with an onset outside of the post partum period. In order to maximize the likelihood of 
identifying HS -, the control group will comprise women without a history of any past or present 
psychiatric disorder, including PMDD, and without first -degree relatives with a history of PND. 
Additional  inclusion and exclusion criteria required for participant safety are detailed in the human 
subjects section. Hormone sensitivity will be prospectively assessed using the hormone protocol 
described below.  
 
We have defined HS+ as a 30% or greater change in any of the IDAS -II mood scales, which include 
dysphoria, suicidal ideation, ill temper (i.e., irritability), and wellbeing (i.e., reverse -keyed) during 
hormone addback or withdrawal, compared with the individual’s own baseline using the equation below:  
 
% symptom change = (Addback score -Baseline score)/Baseline score  
 
Percent symptom change will be calculated for each of the IDAS -II scales listed above at both the 
addback visit (V6) and withdrawal visit (V7). If a participant has a percent symptom  change of  30% or 
31 
  greater on any of the IDAS -II scales listed, she will be classified as HS+. HS - is defined as less than 
30% change in any of the IDAS -II mood scales.   
 
We will only include those with confirmed HS+ and HS - in our planned analyses. Those with a hist ory of 
PND confirmed to be HS - will be excluded from planned analyses. However, if we have enough 
subjects with a history of PND who are HS -, then they may be included as a separate group in 
exploratory analyses. Alternatively, if those with a history of P ND who are HS - are not significantly 
different from those without a history of PND who are HS - in terms of our key outcome variables, then 
we will pool the groups to increase power.  
 
Hormone Administration.  The hormone administration protocol shown in Figure 6 and described below 
will be administered in a double -blind manner  and replicates the methods of our recent study and Bloch 
et al (2000) , modified as follows: the hormone addback period is truncated and the hormone doses 
have been reduced based on our finding that HS+ c an be distinguished from HS - after two weeks of 
low-dose addback (see Preliminary Data).  To clarify double -blinding, all statisticians  in the study will be 
blinded to the treatment intervention given to participants. As all participants will be completing digital 
behavioral tasks and self -report questionnaires throughout the study, which will be analyzed upon study 
completion.  
Baseline . Prior to medication administration, participants will complete a physical exam and 
comprehensive psychological assessment,  including interviews and self -report questionnaires. The first 
fMRI session will be completed during a period of low reproductive hormone levels (days 4 -8, the mid -
follicular phase), which will be confirmed using a plasma estradiol assay. Conducting the b aseline fMRI 
session during the midfollicular phase promotes consistency in hormone profiles across participants 
and provides the optimal contrast for affective symptoms during the period of reproductive hormone 
addback.  
Induced Hypogonadism. After the bas eline period, participants will receive their first injection of 
the gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist leuprolide acetate (Lupron) 3.75 mg/month via 
i.m. injection, which is administered to produce a stable hypogonadal condition (after the init ial “flair”). 
The first Lupron injection will be administered at the end of Study Visit 3 on day six of the participants’ 
first menstrual cycle after the screening period and again one month later. During the first month of 
GnRH agonist administration, all  participants will receive placebo capsules (identical in appearance and 
number to the hormone capsules they will receive later) and will be told that at some point the placebo 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_350248].  
Addback.  After one month of Lupron -alone treatment (i.e., hypogonadism), high plasma levels 
of estradiol and progesterone will be attained via micronized progesterone and estradiol tablets for two 
weeks (with continued Lupron administration). Participants will take 2 mg of estradiol twice daily (for a 
total of 4 mg/day) and 200 mg of progesterone twice daily (for a total of 400 mg/day). The second fMRI 
session will take place at the conclusion of the [ADDRESS_435489] classification of subjects as HS+ and HS -. 
 
Clinical Assessments   
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -V-TR Axis -I Disorders (SCID) (First et al., 2015) , and the 
Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality (SNAP) (Clark, 1993)  will be administered during 
screening to assess past and present psychiatric illness and personality pathology. Each morning, 
starting at Study Visit 1, participants will complete the Daily Rating Form (Endicott et al., 2006)   online, 
a 20-item questionnaire that assesses physical and mood symptoms that acco mpany ovarian hormone 
changes. Ratings are transmitted to the study team in real -time, which  will be used to monitor rapid 
mood changes throughout the study and ensuring participant safety.   
 
 
The following measures will be administered at according to tab le 1: 
 
1.  The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms ( IDAS -II) (Watson et al., 2007)  is a 64 -item 
self-report questionnaire that comprehensi vely assesses anxiety and depression symptoms, 
including ill temper (i.e., irritability), dysphoria, panic, social anxiety, appetite change, lassitude, 
well-being, suicidality, traumatic intrusions, and insomnia. The IDAS -II has excellent 
psychometric prop erties and has been validated in PND  (Watson et al., 2007) . The dysphoria, ill 
temper, wellbeing (inverse), panic, and suicidality scales will b e used to determine hormone 
sensitivity status. Replicating our previous study, HS+ will be defined as a 30% increase in 
mood symptoms during hormone addback. The ill temper scale will be used as the measure of 
irritability to examine associations with beh avioral and fMRI data (Hypotheses 1c and 2c).  
 
2.  The Behavioral Inhibition/Behavioral Activation (BIS/BAS) Scales (Carver & White, 1994)  is 
comprised of four subscales —BIS, Reward Responsiveness, Drive, and Fun Seeking —and 20 
items total that assess behavioral inhibition (anxiety) and behavioral activation (impulsivity). We 
will also include the [ADDRESS_435490] Responsiveness Subscale (Wright et al., 
2009)  to quantify lowered approach motivation following FNR (Hypothesis 2a). The BIS/BAS 
scales are associated with neural markers of psychopathology (Beaver et al., 2006; Simon et 
al., 2010) . Exploratory analyses will be conducted to assess associations between BIS/BAS, 
IDAS -II irritability, behavioral, and fMRI data.  
 
In addition, to assess potential covariates that may impact the associations above, we have 
included  a demographic questionnaire (including self -reported history of pain and poor sleep 
following past pregnancies,  in response to the  SRC’s comments ), the  Edinburgh Handedness 
Scale (because left handedness may impact the validity of fMRI data), a  hormone history 
questionnaire  that we created for previous studies to explore whether menstrual, reproductive, 
or family history may be associated with HS+, and the Trauma History Questionnaire ( given that 
PND is associated with increased prevalence of trauma history. While variables have been 
shown to predict PND, it is unclear the extent to which they are related to HS+ specifically, and 
as such, we will not exc lude women for experiencing a history of trauma, pain, or sleep 
dysregulation (i.e., the experience of these symptoms following a past childbirth likely does not 
preclude a woman from also being hormone sensitive, which will be experimentally confirmed 
using the hormone protocol). However, if these variables are significantly associated with either 
[ADDRESS_435491] 
(BITe)  which is a brief 5 -item self -report questionnaire and the  Misophonia  
Questionnaire  which  is 19 -tem self -report questionnaire both will help to assess irritability.  
To account for the additional level of stress posed  by [CONTACT_25963] -19 pandemic, a COVID Stress 
Scale (CSS) will also be included during in -person MRI scans. The CSS is a 36 -item measure to 
better understand COVID related distress during these in -person visits  (Taylor et al., 2020) . 
 
Depressive symptoms resulting from this hormone regimen, although significant, are relatively brief, 
lasting approximately 7 -10 days (Price & Stolk -Cooke, 2015) . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_350272], depressive symptoms are monitored closely. Any subject who 
devel ops severe depressive symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation) will be discontinued from the study and 
offered treatment.  If inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_350273] a result of the study, that 
participant or their insurance will be responsible for coveri ng the costs .   
 
Functional MRI.  The following tasks will be included in each of the two, one hour -long fMRI sessions:  
 
The i mplicit face emotion processing task (Stodda rd et al., 2017)  will test whether HS+ is characterized 
by [CONTACT_350348] -medial PFC connectivity in response to threat (Hypothesis 1b),, that robustly 
activates key limbic regions, including the amygdala. During the task, participants are asked to i dentify 
the gender of angry, happy, and fearful faces at 50%, 100%, and 150% emotion intensity presented in 
random order for 2000 milliseconds followed by [CONTACT_350349]. Trials will appear in 3 blocks, 
generating 30 trials of each emotion at each inten sity and 90 neutral face emotion trials. Adolescents 
with irritability and anxiety show reduced amygdala -PFC connectivity compared with those without 
anxiety during this task (Stoddard et al., 2017) . 
 
 The  Affective Posner Task (Tseng et al., 2017 ) will test whether HS+ is characterized by [CONTACT_350350] (Hypothesi s 2b), a well 
validated (Deveney et al., 2013; Rich et al., 2005, 2007, 2010)  adaptation of the Posner spatial cueing 
task that includes both reward and FNR and activates key limbic and striatal regions, including the 
amygdala, caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens (Deveney et al., 2013 ). This event -related task 
is divided into 3 runs: during Run 1 (practice run conducted outside of the scanner), participants receive 
accurate feedback about their performance on the task and do not win or lose money; during Run 2, 
participants receive accurate feedback about their performance  on the task and win or lose 50 cents 
per trial, based on their accuracy and reaction time; and during Run 3 (FNR), participants are told they 
must respond accurately to win money, but participants are given feedback that they responded too 
slowly on 60% o f accurate trials, regardless of their performance (Deveney et al., 2013 ). During the 
FNR run, participants with mood dysregulation/irritability have demonstrated decreased amygdala and 
striatal activation relative to euthymic controls (Deveney et al., 2013 ). This task also has good  
convergence with self -reported irritability and frustration and excellent test retest reliability (Tseng et al., 
2017 ), making it ideal for a repeated -measures study design. For the purpose of exploratory analysis, 
we w ill also include a resting state fMRI  scan.  
 
FMRI Data Acquisition and Image Processing.   
[ADDRESS_435492] heart rate  for the duration of time in the scanner. Evidence supports that monitoring 
autonomic nervous system activity during fMRI can provide insight into stress adaptability  (Butle & 
Wartolowska, 2017) . Whole -brain functional images will be acquired  using a single -shot, gradient 
recalled echoplanar pulse sequence sensitive to blood -oxygen -level-dependent (BOLD) contrast. Each 
of [ADDRESS_435493], including corticolimbic regions (amygdala, medial PFC) for the implicit face task and 
amygdala and striatum (caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens) for the Affective Posner. Image 
analyses will control for any group differences in reaction time  or accuracy.  
 
Behavioral Assessments.  The following tasks will be conducted outside the scanner at the end of visits 
3 & 6: To test whether HS+ show a greater degree of threat attention bias (Hypothesis 1a), participants 
will complete a visual dot -probe p aradigm (Salum et al., 2017 .), which measures attention bias toward 
angry faces. Each trial will start with a fixation cross, followed by a pair of faces (one on each side of 
the screen; in anger trials, one face is ang ry and the other is neutral), followed by [CONTACT_61140] (half of 
the time presented on the same side as the angry face and half of the time presented on the side of the 
neutral face). Trials will be of three types (angry -neutral, happy -neutral, and neutral -neutral) and 
presented in random order. Threat attention bias will be calculated for the angry -neutral trials by 
[CONTACT_350351]. Using this task, previous studies have demonstrated that both irritable youths (Hommer et al., 
2014; Salum et al., 2017 ) and anxious adults (Bradley et al., 1999; Mogg & Bradley, 1999, 2005)  have 
greater threat attention bias. To test whether HS+ show greater relational aggression (a pproach 
behavior) in response to frustration (Hypothesis 2a), participants will complete the brief Point 
Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (Golomb et al., 2007) , which measures relational aggression and has 
been validated in adult women (Dougherty et al., 1999) . In the task, participants press a button to 
accrue money or press another button to subtract money from a (fictional) partner at no direct gain to 
themselves. Frustration is induced by [CONTACT_350352], which is attributed to 
the partner. Relational aggression is operationalized as number of point subtractions the participant 
makes.  
  
Physical Exam  
Participants will receive a physical exam prior to drug administration to rule out exclusionary health 
problems. Results of physical  exam will be added to participants’ UNC Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18080].  
Additionally, participants will be required to provide documentation of a normal gynecological exam 
within the last  three  years, which is consistent with guidance from the American Academy of Family 
Medicine  (Qaseem et a l., 2014) . 
  
Venipuncture  
35 
  Participants will undergo venipuncture at 3 study visits. Initial blood tests will include a CBC, Hcg 
serum, BUN, creatinine, electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, and Calcium) and a hepatic panel   
to rule out exclusionary  health problems. Lab results will be added to participants’ medical records.  
Subsequent venipuncture will be for the purpose of assaying estradiol, allopre gnanolone and 
progesterone levels to ensure participant compliance at visits [ADDRESS_435494] the fMRI analyses.  
7.1      Sample Size Determination  
 
We approximated power and  sample size using a simpler model comparing the two groups  
on change scores  in behavioral effects (threat attention bias, reactive aggression) and brain activation  
(amygdala and striatal response to non -reward ) from baseline to addback. With [ADDRESS_435495] 80% power to detect effect sizes of 1.10, which are large and consistent with our previous 
study (see Preliminary Data). We posit that if treatment with supra physiologic levels of reproductive 
hormones does not produce large enough diff erences in neural circuits between HS+ and HS - to be 
detected in a relatively small sample of women, then this line of research, which involves significant 
participant burden, is not worth pursuing. Moreover, given the experimental nature of the proposed 
research, our effect size estimates are more similar to those seen in experimental animal research than 
in traditional human clinical trials. Nonetheless, our own and other previous clinical research supports 
our hypothesized large effect. Studies comparing  participants with major depression and controls have 
yielded effect sizes (Cohen’s d) ranging from 1.15 to 2.05 in dorsomedial PFC responsivity to negative 
emotional stimuli  (Grimm et al., 2008; Hooley et al., 2005; Moses -Kolko et al., 2010) and from 1.[ADDRESS_435496]  (Epstein et al., 2006; Moses -Kolko et al., 201 1; Moria J 
Smoski et al., 2009) . Studies examining the association between amygdala activation and depressive 
symptom severi ty have yielded effect sizes (Cohen’s d) ranging from 1.62 to 2.76  (Hamilton & Gotlib, 
2008; Moses -Kolko et al., 2010) .  
 
Our target number of subjects to include in the fMRI analyses is N=30 (15 confirmed HS+ and 15 
confirmed HS -). Because we have not y et identified a mechanism by [CONTACT_350353] 100% accuracy, we will need to over -recruit women with a history of 
PND to account for those who end up not being HS+. In our previous study 11 of the 15 women (73% ) 
with a history of PND were HS+. For the current study, we therefore plan to over -enroll women with a 
history of PND in order to reach our target of 15 women with confirmed HS+. If 73% of women with a 
history of PND and no history of non -puerperal major d epressive disorder are HS+, then we will need to 
enroll 21 women to find 15 with confirmed HS+. Based on the 9% dropout rate of our prior trial, w e 
estimated a  9% dropout rate, and as such, we have budgeted for an additional 3 subjects to account for 
dropo uts. In the prior study 2/3 of the women who withdrew from the protocol had a history of PND, so 
we anticipate 2 women with a history of PND and 1 control (without a history of PND) will withdraw from 
the proposed study. These numbers are summarized in the  following table:  
 
 
 
 
 
37 
  Recruitment Group  Target 
Enrollment  Confirmed HS+/HS - 
(included in 
fMRI/behavioral 
analysis)  Not HS+/HS - 
(excluded from 
fMRI/behavioral 
analysis)  Withdrawn  
History of PND  23 15 HS+  6 not HS+  2 
Control (no history of 
PND)  16 15 HS - 0 not HS - 1 
TOTAL  39 30 6 3 
 
Thus, we plan to enroll  a total of 39 subjects (n= 16 without a history of PND, n= 23 with a history of 
PND ). 
 
7.[ADDRESS_435497] defined HS+ as a 30% or greater change in any of the IDAS -II mood scales, which include 
dysphoria, suicidal ity, ill temper (i.e., irritability), and wellbeing (i.e., reverse -keyed) during hormone 
addback or withdrawal, compared with the individual’s own baseline using the equation below:  
 
% symptom change = (Addbac k score -Baseline score)/Baseline score  
 
Percent symptom change will be calculated for each of the IDAS -II scales listed above at both the 
addback visit (V6) and withdrawal visit (V7). If a participant has a percent symptoms change of 30% or 
greater on any of the IDAS -II scales listed, she will be classified as HS+. HS - is defined as less than 
30% change in an y of the IDAS -II mood scales.  
 
We will only include those with confirmed HS+ and HS - in our planned analyses. Those with a history of 
PND confirmed to be HS - will be excluded from planned analyses. However, if we have enough 
subjects with a history of PND  who are HS -, then they may be included as a separate group in 
exploratory analyses. Alternatively , if those with a history of PND who are HS - are not significantly 
different from those without a history of PND who are HS - in terms of our key outcome varia bles, then 
we will pool the groups to increase power.  
 
The IDAS -II is scored using a 5 -point Likert scale, ranging from 1 “Not at all” to 5 “Extremely.” The 
scales we will use to determine hormone sensitivity and their ranges are listed in the table below : 
 
IDAS -II Scale  Minimum Score  Maximum Score  
Dysphoria  [ADDRESS_435498] for data determined to be missing at random, 
given that it is a reliable method for obtaining valid inferences in both behavioral and fMRI research 
(Rubin, 1987; Vaden et al., 2012) . Data for dropouts will be compar ed with data for those who complete 
38 
  the study to determine the extent to which excluding their data will introduce selection bias, and 
selection bias will be identified  as a weakness in any resulting publications or presentations.  
 
Sensitivity  Analysis . In addition to the statistical tests described below, we will use sensitivity analyses 
to evaluate the robustness of the study’s main results to reasonable perturbations of the statistical 
methods and assumptions used and to help ensure reproducibility of the main results . Sensitivity 
analysis will address the inclusion/exclusion of questionable  data values (i.e., outliers), the use of 
alternative methods of copi[INVESTIGATOR_350274], and modeling assumptions.  
 
Hypothesis testing.  We have deta iled both the null and alternative hypotheses  we will test below . For all 
hypothesis tests, w e will use the Bonferroni method to correct for multiple comparisons. All hypothesis 
tests that are observed to be not statistically significant will be reported a s being inconclusive. In 
accordance with the ICMJE and Consort Statement, all statistical estimates of population parameters 
will be tabulated alo ng with confidence intervals. The interpretation of confidence intervals will be an 
integral part of the data analysis in concert with the statistical hypothesis tests.   
 
Power calculations  overview . We have based our power calculations on previous studies of similar 
effects (i.e, not pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602]) with N greater than or equal to 30. Given that prior literature s uggests 
large effect sizes for Aims 1 and 2, we believe that point -estimates will yield relatively accurate power 
calculations.    
 
Aim 1: To determine the extent to which irritability is characterized by [CONTACT_350354]+ and HS -. 
 
Null hypothesis  1: HS+ is not characterized by [CONTACT_350355] . 
 
Alternative hypothesis  1: HS+ is characterized by [CONTACT_350355] . Given this hypothesis, we will test the 
following sub-hypotheses : 
 
Null hypothesis 1a: HS+ is not characterized by  [CONTACT_251064] a ttention bias during hormone addback 
relative to baseline  in the target population . 
 
Alternative hypothesis 1a: HS+ is characterized by  [CONTACT_350356] . 
 
Independent variables: Group (HS + versus HS -) and Phase (Visit 3 -baseline versus Visit 6 -
hormone addback)  
 
Dependent variable: Threat attention bias will be measured using the visual dot probe task  
at study visits 3 and 6 . Threat attention bias will be calculated for the angry -neutral tr ials by 
[CONTACT_350357]  (measured in milliseconds)  on trials where the asterisk 
39 
  appears on the same side as the angry face from the mean reaction time on trials  where the 
asterisk appears on the same side as the neutral face.  
 
Analysis: 2x2 Repeated Measured ANOVA will be used to analyze the effects of Group (HS - 
vs. HS+) and Phase  (baseline vs. hormone addback) on threat attention bias.  
 
Power:  We used G*Power 3.[ADDRESS_435499] size f=0.3  
based on a previous study of threat attention bias in those with and without mood 
dysregulation (Hommer et al., 2014) . If we set =.05, we will have 87% power to reject the 
null hypothesis  with a total sample size of N=30.  
 
Null hypothesis 1b: HS+ is not characterized by  [CONTACT_332872] a mygdala -medial PFC connectivity in  
response to threatening stimuli during hormone addback relative to baseline  in the target 
population . 
 
Alternative h ypothesis 1b: HS+ is characterized by  [CONTACT_332872] a mygdala -medial PFC connectivity 
in response to threatening stimuli during hormone addback re lative to baseline  in the target 
population . 
 
Independent variables: Group (HS+ versus HS -) and Phase (Visit 3 -baseline versus Visit 6 -
hormone addback)  
 
Dependent variable: Amygdala -medial PFC connectivity will be assessed during  the implicit 
face emotion processing fMRI task  at study visits 3 and 6 . Functional connectivity expresses 
the statistical dependency among activations in different brain regions and results in 
undirected (symmetrical) connectivity matrices and will be cal culated according to standard 
procedures (Walsh et al., 2017) . We will use a ge neralized psychophysiological interaction 
(gPPI) approach for detecting context -dependent functional connectivity (Cisler et al., 2014; 
McLaren et al., 2012) . Replicating  the methods of Walsh et al. (2017), we will use an ROI 
approach to target the amygdala , which will be defined using the Harvard -Oxford subco rtical 
atlas. Voxel -wise models will be used to evaluate connectivity with the amygdala seed. For 
each participant,  mean fMRI time courses will be extracted from the amygdala seed using 
the “fslmeants ” program  in FSL, then multiplied by [CONTACT_350358] 
(i.e., task condition) to form the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_350275]. The gPPI [INVESTIGATOR_350276], as well as their interaction terms to describe the 
unique effect of these interactions above and beyond the man effects of seed time courses 
and task conditions. Our primary contrast of interest will evaluate the differ ence between 
connectivity during presentation of threatening stimuli versus non -threatening stimuli. This 
allows for the characterization of connectivity patterns specific to threat processing.  
 
Analysis: Group and phase differen ces will be evaluated with respect to seed -based 
connectivity  specific to threat processing using a 2x2 mixed effects analys is with Bayesian 
estimation techniques with FMRIB Local Analysis of Mixed Effects (Smith et al., 2004) . 
40 
  Clusters will be thresholded at Z>2.58 or p<.005 corrected with a minimum conti guous 
cluster size of 8 (Walsh et al., 2017) . 
 
Power: We used G*Power 3.[ADDRESS_435500] examined 
changes in amygdala -PFC between those with and without depression following treatment , 
the few extant studies yielded large effects (d=1.3) (Straub et al., 2017) . If we anticipate an 
effect size f=.5 and set =.05, we will have greater than 99%  power to reject the null 
hypothesis  with a total sample size of N=30.  
 
Null hypothesis 1c  (secondary) : In HS+, t he degree of irritability, threat attention bias, and 
amygdala -medial PFC connectivity during hormone addback are unrelated  in the target 
population .  
 
Alternative h ypothesis 1c (secondary): In HS+, i rritability is assoc iated with  1) threat attention 
bias, and 2) amygdala -medial PFC connectivity during hormone addback  in the target 
population . 
 
“Independent ” variable: Irritability will be defined as scores on the IDAS -II ill temper scale  at 
study visit 6 .  
 
“Dependent ” variables: Threat attention bias at study visit [ADDRESS_435501] as for hypothesis 1b.  
 
Analysis: Pearson’s r will be calculate d for co rrelations between irritabilit y and  1) threat 
attention bias  and 2) amygdala medial -PFC connectivity  during hormone addback (study 
visit 6) in HS+.  
 
Power: We have not powered to the study to assess secondary hypotheses. We used 
G*Power 3.[ADDRESS_435502] size (Spearman’s =.3) (Hommer et 
al., 2014) . If we anticipate an effect size =.3 and set =.05 (two-tailed) , we will have less 
than 20 % power to reject the null hypothesis  with a HS+ sample size of n=15. There is not 
enough information to predict the strength of the association between irritability and 
amygdala medial -PFC connectivity.  
 
Aim 2: To determine the extent to which irritability is characterized by [CONTACT_248709] r eward 
processing during reproductive hormone challenge relative to baseline in HS+ and HS -. 
 
Null hypothesis  2: HS+ is not characterized by [CONTACT_350359] -reward (i.e., 
when reward is expected)  during hormone addback relative t o baseline  in the target population . 
 
41 
  Alternative hypothesis  2: HS+ is characterized by [CONTACT_350359] -reward  
during hormone addback relative to baseline  in the target population . Given this hypothesis, we will test 
the following sub-hypotheses : 
 
Null hypothesis 2a: HS+ is not characterized by [CONTACT_350360] . 
 
Alternative h ypothesis 2a: HS+ is characterized by [CONTACT_350361] . 
 
Independent variables: Group (HS+ versus HS -) and Phase (Visit 3 -baseline versus Visit 6 -
hormone addback)  
 
Dependent variable: Reactive aggression will be defined as the number of point  subtractions 
the participant makes during the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm . 
 
Analysis: 2x2 Repeated Measured ANOVA will be used to analyze the effects of  
Group (HS - vs. HS+) and Phase  (baseline vs. hormone addback) on threat attention bias.  
 
Power: We used G*Power 3.[ADDRESS_435503] size 
based on a previous study examining reactive aggression using the Point Subtraction 
Aggression Paradigm in men who were treated with testosterone versus placebo ( d=.95) . If 
we estimate the effect size f=.45 and set =.05, we will have greater than 99 % power to 
reject the null hypothesis  with a total sample size of N=30.  
 
Null hypothesis 2b:  HS+ is not characterized by [CONTACT_350362] m in response to FNR during hormone addback relative to baseline  in the target 
population . 
 
Alternative h ypothesis 2b: HS+ is characterized by [CONTACT_350363] . 
 
Independent variables: Group (HS+ versus HS -) and Phase (Visit 3 -baseline versus Visit 6 -
hormone addback)  
 
Dependent variable: Activation in amygdala and ventral striatum  (caudate, putamen, 
nucleus accumbens)  ROIs  during the Affective Posner Task. Event types include three 
categories: trial type (money, no money), validity (valid, invalid), and feedback (positive, 
negative, error). Combination of these three factors will be modeled using individual linear 
regressio n with a fixed -shape, gamma -variate response function, convolved with a boxcar 
function of the stimulus duration. FNR will be defined as the contrast between positive valid 
money trials and negative valid money trials (i.e., the difference between expectin g money 
and getting it and expecting money and not getting it).  
42 
   
Analysis: The model will include each of the two event -type regressors (to model FNR), the 
six motion parameters, and baseline drift for each of the runs. Beta coefficients and t -
statistics will be calculated for each voxel and regressor.  Group level analyses will be 
conducted on the amy gdala and striatum (caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens), as 
defined by [CONTACT_350364] -Oxford subcortical atlas. Mean signal intensity will be extracted fro m 
each ROI for each of the event types using FSL. Signal intensity values will be submitted to 
a Group x Trial type x Feedback x Phase x Region ANCOVA in SPSS.  
Power: We used G*Power 3.[ADDRESS_435504] size 
based o n previous studies  examining changes in amygdala activation with various 
treatments  (d=1.58 to 1.96) (Hauner et al., 2012; Riem et al., 2011) . If we estimate the effect 
size f=.5 and set =.05, we will have greater than 99% power to reject the null hypothesis  
with a total sample size of N=30.  
 
Null hypothesis 2c  (secondary) : The degree of irritability, reactive aggression, and subcortical 
(amygdala, caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens) activation in HS+ during hormone 
addback are unrelat ed in the target population . 
 
Alternative h ypothesis 2c (secondary): In HS+, self-reported irritability is associated with  1) 
reactive aggression, and 2) subcortical (amygdala, caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens) 
activation during hormone addback  in the target population . 
 
 “Independent” v ariable: Irritability will be defined as scores on the IDAS -II ill temper scale at 
study visit 6.  
 
“Dependent” variables: Reactive aggression  at study visit [ADDRESS_435505] as for hypothesis 2b.  
 
Analysis: Pearson’s r will be calculated for correlations between irritabilit y and  1) reactive 
aggression and 2) subcortical activation  during hormone addbac k (study visit 6) in HS+.  
 
Power: We have not powered to the study to assess secondary hypotheses. We used 
G*Power 3.[ADDRESS_435506] size (Pearson’s r=.6) in a civilian 
population  (Geniole et al., 2017) . If we anticipate an effect size r=.3 and set =.05 (two-
tailed) , we will have 70% power to reject the null hypothesis  with a HS+ sample size of 
n=15. There is not enough information to predict the strength of the association between 
irritability and subcortical  activation in response to FNR.  
7.[ADDRESS_435507] Population(s) for Analysis  
The rationale  for the proposed study is that employing a scaled down model of puerperal hormonal 
events permits the identification of a group of individuals homogeneous for hormone sensitivity (HS+), 
[ADDRESS_435508] opportunity for disentangling the specific change s in brain function due to 
reproductive hormones (i.e., HS -) from those accompanying reproductive hormone -precipi[INVESTIGATOR_350277] (i.e., HS+). Thus, we will only include those with confirmed HS+ and HS - in our 
planned analyses as described in se ction 7.2.

  8       Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1      Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
·       Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency  (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc.) 
·       Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156],  
·       Serious (as defined below) “ Serious” is different than “severe” as reported in  the CTC criteria 
that applies a grade to the AE.  
  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse 
events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the 
abnormality:  
·       results in study withdrawal  
·       is associated with a serious adverse event  
·       is associated with clinical signs or sympto ms 
·       leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
·       is considered by [CONTACT_350365] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is an y AE that is:  
·       fatal  
·       life -threatening  
·       requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
·       results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
·       a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
·       an important medical event  
  
Importan t medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of 
major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent 
one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, d rug overdose or abuse, a seizure that 
did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency 
department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
  
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serio us should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events . 
[ADDRESS_435509] administration of study treatment.  
  
Pre-existing Condition  
A pre -existing condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition will be 
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens 
during the study period.  
  
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality will be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the 
end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an 
adverse event will also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.  
  
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved advers e events will be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent e vent(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The investigator 
will notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The 
sponsor will also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of 
a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offsprin g of a subject that has participated in this 
study.  
  
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the following  
conditions is met:  
·       The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
·       The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
·       The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent fol low-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.  
  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71979] a serious adverse event unl ess specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any 
condition responsible for surgery will be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the 
criteria for and adverse event.  
  
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12191], nor surgery are reported as an adverse 
event in the following circumstances:  
46 
  ·       Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a 
preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcom e of an adverse event if the 
purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
·       Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842].  
·       Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_238586], unless it 
is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844].  
 
COVID -19 
Any participant that develops symptoms of COVID -19 including by [CONTACT_350366]: fever, cough, 
shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, loss of taste or smell, or has known contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a COVID -[ADDRESS_435510], the investigator will seek information on adverse events 
by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_350367].  Information on all adverse events will be 
recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the 
case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures 
resul ts will be recorded in the source document, though will be grouped under one diagnosis.  
  
All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of each event 
will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or 
participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study 
period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs afte r 
the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation 
will be recorded and reported immediately.  
8.[ADDRESS_435511] be reported are those that are:  
·       related to study participation,  
·       unexpected, and  
·       serious or involve risks to subjects or others  
(see definitions, section 8.1).  
  
47 
  If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the time of 
the initial report includes:  
● Study identifier  
● Subject number  
● A description of the 
event  
● Date of onset  ● Current status  
● Whether study treatment was discontinued  
● The reason why the event is classified as 
serious  
● Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study treatment  
 8.3.1     Investigator reporting: notifying the study sponsor  
  
Any study -related unanticipated problem posing risk of harm to subjects or others, and any type of 
serious adverse event, will be reported to the study sponsor and DSMB by [CONTACT_16470] [ADDRESS_435512] the understanding of 
the event.  Significant new information on ongoing serious adverse events should be provided promptly 
to the study sponsor and the FDA.  
8.3.2  Investigator reporting  
  
For reportable deaths, the initial sub mission to the UNC IRB may be made by [CONTACT_350368]. The AE/Unanticipated Problem Form is required as a follow up to the 
initial submission.  
  
Other Reportable events:  
For clinical drug trials, the following events are also reportable to the UNC IRB:  
● Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents a serious unexpected 
adverse event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as agranulocytosis, hepatic 
necrosis, Stevens -Johnson syndrome).  
● Any adverse event that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigators brochure, protocol 
or informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_284581].  
● Information that indicates a change to the risks or poten tial benefits of the research, in terms of 
severity or frequency. For example:  
● An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to treatment than 
initially expected.  
48 
  ● Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than 
initially expected.  
● A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research study is of no 
therapeutic value.  
● Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or biolog ic used 
in a research protocol.  
● Breach of confidentiality  
● Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard 
to a research participant.  
● Incarceration of a participant when the research was  not previously approved u nder Subpart C 
and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
● Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint 
cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
●  Protocol viol ation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved 
protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_116576], 
or affects the rights or welfare of subjects.  
8.3.3     Investigator reporting: Notifying UNC if affiliate site  
N/A 
8.3.4     Sponsor reporting: Notifying the FDA  
  
The study sponsor is required to report certain study events in an expedited fashion to the FDA.  These 
written notifications of adverse events are  referred to as IND safety reports. The following describes the 
safety reporting requirements by [CONTACT_28822]:  
  
·       Within 7 calendar days  
Any study event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug  
– unexpected,  
– fatal or life -threatening, and  
  
·       Within 15 calendar days  
Any study event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug,  
– unexpected, and  
– serious, but not fatal or life -threatening  
-or- 
– a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable but is later found to fit the 
criteria for reporting (reporting within 15 calendar days from when event was deemed reportable).  
Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that:  
– suggest a significant risk for human subjects i ncluding reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or 
carcinogenicity.  
49 
    
Additional reporting requirements  
Sponsors are also required to identify in IND safety reports all previous reports concerning similar 
adverse events and to analyze the significance of  the current event in light of the previous reports.  
  
Reporting Process  
Adverse events may be submitted on FDA Form 3500A or in a narrative format. If supplied as in a 
narrative format, the minimum information to be supplied is noted above at the beginnin g of section 8.3. 
All adverse events will be reported to the FDA.  
8.3.5     Sponsor reporting: Notifying participating investigators  
It is the responsibility of the study sponsor to notify all participating investigators, in a written IND safety 
report, of  any adverse event associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected, 
as well as any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for human subjects.  
Additionally, sponsors are also required to identify in  IND safety reports all previous reports concerning 
similar adverse events and to analyze the significance of the current event in light of the previous 
reports.  
8.4      Unblinding Procedures  
In the event of a SAE or discontinuation from the study, subjec ts will be unblinded.  
8.5      Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_350278].  In the event of three grade 3 or higher adverse events (i.e. a life threateni ng 
adverse event that may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) possibly or definitely associated with the study 
intervention, the study will be suspended and the study’s Data and Safety Monitoring Board will be 
notified.  
8.6      Medical Monitoring  
The principal inves tigator will oversee the safety of the study at his/her site.  This safety monitoring will 
include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the 
construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monit oring plan.  Medical monitoring will 
include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.  
8.6.[ADDRESS_435513] (DSMB) will act in an advisory capacity to the University of North 
Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC -CH) Institutional Review Board (IRB) to monitor patient safety and 
evaluate the efficacy of the intervention.  
  
DSMB RESPONSIBILITIES  
50 
    
The initial responsibility of the DSMB will be to approve the initiatio n of this clinical trial. After this 
approval and at periodic intervals , following  the enrollment and protocol start of 10 subjects or at 6 
months intervals  during the course of the trail, the DSMB responsibilities are to:  
  
● review plans for data safety an d monitoring;  
● evaluate the progress of the trial, includin g safety events , accrual and retention, and other 
factors that can affect study outcome;  
● make recommendations to the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_201127], termination, or other modifications of 
the trial base d on the reported  beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under study;  
● if appropriate, review  interim analysis of efficacy in accordance with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_93481];  
● assist the UNC -CH IRB by [CONTACT_350369], and sample size.  
  
MEMBERSHIP  
 
The DSMB will consist of at least three members, and the presence of all three members will be 
required to constitute a quorum. The members, recommended by [CONTACT_350370], will include an 
obstetrician -gynecologist, a biostatistician, and a psychiatrist (not affiliated with the UNC Department of 
Psychiatry) and will be subject to approval by [CONTACT_84041] -CH IRB. Membership will consist of persons 
completely independent of th e investigators who have no financial, scientific, or other conflict of interest 
with the trial. Collaborators or associates of [CONTACT_14817] are not eligible to serve on the DSMB. Written 
documentation attesting to absence of conflict of interest is requir ed. The DSMB includes experts in or 
representatives of the fields of:  
• a psychiatrist with relevant clinical experience,  
• an obstetrician -gynecologist with relevant clinical experience;  
• clinical trial methodology, and  
• biostatistics.  
The DSMB chairperson will be responsible for overseeing the meetings, developi[INVESTIGATOR_350279]. Schiller and the UNC -CH IRB, as required. The chair is the contact [CONTACT_350371]  
A Safety Officer will be identified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Schiller at the fi rst meeting. This person will be the contact 
[CONTACT_350372]. The Safety Officer will notify the DSMB and UNC -CH IRB of 
serious adverse events within [ADDRESS_435514]. Schiller will prepare t he 
agenda to address the review of the manual of operating procedures, modification of the study design, 
initiation of the trial, identification of a safety officer, reporting of adverse events, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], interim 
analysis plan, etc.  
  
Meetings of the  DSMB will be held two times a year at the call of the Chairperson. Meetings shall be 
closed to the public because discussions may address confidential patient data. Meetings are attended, 
when appropriate, by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_350280]. Meetings may be convened 
as conference calls as well as in person, although the initial meeting and meetings to discuss interim 
analysis will be face -to-face. An emergency meeting of the DSMB may be called at any time by [CONTACT_350373] C-CH IRB should questions of patient safety arise.  
  
MEETING FORMAT  
  
An appropriate format for DSMB meetings consists of an open and closed session. The open sessions 
may be attended by [CONTACT_458](s), institution staff and UNC -CH IRB staff , and should 
always include the study biostatistician. Issues discussed at open sessions will include the conduct and 
progress of the study, including patient accrual, compliance with protocol, and problems encountered. 
Patient -specific data and treatment group data may not be presented in the open session.  
  
The closed session will be attended only by [CONTACT_93526]. The DSMB may request others to 
attend part or all of the closed sessions (e.g., the study statistician, UNC -CH IRB staff). All safety an d 
efficacy data are and must be presented at this session. The discussion at the closed session is 
completely confidential.  
 
The DSMB will conduct an interim review following the enrollment of [ADDRESS_435515].  
  
Should the DSMB decide to issue a termination recommendation, full vote of the DSMB will be 
required. In the event of a split vote, majority vote will rule, and a minority report should be appended.  
  
REPORTS  
  
1. Interim Reports: Interim reports are generally  prepared by [CONTACT_350374] [ADDRESS_435516] of two parts:  
  
Part 1 (Open Session Report) provid es information on study aspects such as accrual, baseline 
characteristics, and other general information on study status.  
52 
    
Part 2 (Closed Session Report) may contain data on study outcomes, including safety data, and 
depending on the study, perhaps effica cy data. The Closed Session Report is considered confidential 
and should be destroyed at the conclusion of the meeting. Data files to be used for interim analyses 
should have undergone established editing procedures to the extent possible. Interim analyses  of the 
efficacy data are performed only if they are specified and approved in advance and criteria for possible 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_350281].  
  
1. Reports from the DSMB:  A formal report containing recommendations for continuation or 
modifications of the study  prepared by [CONTACT_350375]. Once approved by [CONTACT_4318], the formal DSMB 
recommendation will be forwarded to [CONTACT_350438] is [CONTACT_14817]’s responsibility to distribute the 
formal DSMB recommendation report to tall co -investigators and to assure that copi[INVESTIGATOR_350282].  
  
As previously stated, the formal DSMB report should conclude with a recommendation to continue or to 
terminate the study. Th is recommendation should be made by a formal majority vote. A termination 
recommendation may be made by [CONTACT_350376] a majority vote. The DSMB Chairperson is 
responsible for notifying [CONTACT_14817] of a decision to terminate the study. In the eve nt of a split vote in 
favor of continuation, a minority report should be contained within the regular DSMB report. The report 
should not include unblinded data, discussion of the unblinded data, etc.  
  
Mailings to the DSMB: On a scheduled basis (as agreed upon by [CONTACT_4318]) blinded safety data 
should be communicated to all DSMB members or to the designated safety officer (to be determined at 
the first meeting). Any concerns noted should be brought to the attention of the DSMB Chairperson.  
  
Access to Interim  Data:  Access to the accumulating endpoint data should be limited to as small a 
group as possible. Limiting the access to interim data to the DSMB members relieves the investigator of 
the burden of deciding whether it is ethical to continue to enroll  patie nts and helps protect the study 
from bias in patient entry and/or evaluation.  
  
CONFIDENTIALITY  
  
All materials, discussions and proceedings of the DSMB are completely confidential. Members and 
other participants in DSMB meetings are expected to maintain confidentiality.  
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_435517] of 1996 (HIPAA). Only study personnel, the 
PI, the study coordinator, and research assistants will have access to confidential information about 
study subjects. Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the 
following:  
·       What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
·       Who will have access to that information and why  
·       Who will use or disclose that information  
·       The rights of a research subject to revoke their auth orization for use of their PHI.  
  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, [CONTACT_14817], by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.   For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be 
made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their 
scheduled study period.  
 
9.2      Source Documents  
Sour ce data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a 
clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in 
source documents.  Examples of these origin al documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_19093], microfiches, photographic negatives, 
microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the 
laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
 
All subject files will be stored in the study coordinator’s office in a locked filing cabinet, which will only 
be accessed by [CONTACT_978], study coordinator, and their trained research assistants. Lab values, recorded 
data, subject files, scree ning and call logs will all be stored digitally on the secure, Schiller lab drive 
server. Access will only be granted on this electronic drive for study personnel.  
Once enrolled in the study, participants will be identified by a specific study ID number a ssigned to 
them upon enrollment, to protect their privacy and maintain confidentiality. Any identifying information 
(i.e. consent forms and HIPAA authorizations) will be stored separately from their individual subject 
files. Additionally,  once enrolled in the study, Qualtrics will be used to collect questionnaires data from 
study participants will be labeled by [CONTACT_350377].  
 
 
54 
  9.3      Case Report Forms (as applicable)  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrume nt for the study.  All data 
requested on the CRF must be recorded. Reasons for withdrawal (drop -outs) from the study and missing 
data values will be documented in the database.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure 
was not done or the q uestion was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual 
case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to 
correct such an error, draw a single straight line through th e incorrect entry and enter the correct data 
above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  
For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and 
date it.  
9.4      Records Retention  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least [ADDRESS_435518].  These documents should be retained for a longer 
period if required by [CONTACT_16477].  I n such an instance, it is the responsibility of the 
sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be 
retained.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_435519] (RA) and Russ Dean (data  manager) and overseen by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Schiller  with a goal of maximizing data quality.  
 
[CONTACT_350439] will monitor data completeness using the case report forms for each subject and 
document missing data as well as the reason for missingness in the database. Data accuracy will be 
monitored using descriptive statistics to identify values outside of the possible range as well as outlier s.  
 
Interview and Questionnaire Data  
 
[CONTACT_350440] and  [CONTACT_350439] , in collaboration,  will prepare a codebook for the study and design  
Qualtrics surveys to reduce opportunities for data errors and missingness (e.g., using survey response 
logic to ask participants to confirm they’d like to skip the questions for any missing questionnaire 
values).  
 
All research assistants will receive tra ining with the codebook for all items that require hand entry into 
databases. [CONTACT_350439] will examine data on a mont hly basis for adherence to the codebook.  
  
Behavioral Data  
 
[ADDRESS_435520]. Schiller and [CONTACT_350441] to determine 1) whether data can be corrected 
statistically, and 2) whether the problem needs to be addressed prior to future scans (e.g., in th e case 
of a problem with a scan setting).  
10   Study Monitoring, Auditing, and 
Inspecting  
10.1   Study Monitoring Plan  
This study will be monitored according to the monitoring plan in Appendix C . The investigator will 
allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The Investigator will also ensure that the monitor 
or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the above noted study -related 
documents and study related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.), and has adequate 
space to conduct the monitoring visit.  
10.2   Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], the sponsor, 
government regulatory bodies, and University compliance an d quality assurance groups of all study 
related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study 
data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities 
(e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
  
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_28832].  
  
56 
  11   Ethical Considerations

You may refuse to join,  or you may withdraw your consent to be in the study, for any reason, without penalty.  
 
Research studies are designed to obtain new knowledge. This new information may help people in the future.  
You may not receive any direct benefit from being in the res earch study. There also may be risks to being in 
research studies. Deciding not to be in the study or leaving the study before it is done will not affect your 
relationship with the researcher, your health care provider, or the University of North Carolina -Chapel Hill. If you 
are a patient with an illness, you do not have to be in the research study in order to receive health care.  
 
[ADDRESS_435537] about this study at any time.  
 
What is the purpose of this study?  
The purpose of this research study is to determine the role of hormones (estrogen and progesterone) in postpartum 
depression. We will investigate the role of these hormones in mood by [CONTACT_2329] a hormonal “challenge.” The 
hormonal challenge invo lves three phases. During phase one, you will receive Lupron, a medicine that will 
temporarily turn off your ovaries during the study. Lupron reduces the levels of estrogen and progesterone in your 
blood. During phase two, you will continue to receive Lupr on and you will take pi[INVESTIGATOR_350288]. At one point during phase two, the estrogen and progesterone treatment will be stopped, 
and the levels of both hormones will drop rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. As your hormones drop, you may experien ce symptoms of 
depression, including sadness and less interest in your daily activities.  During phase three, you will stop taking all 
study medications, and we expect your mood and hormone levels to return to normal. You will receive two scans 
of your brain during the study. The brain scans will help us understand how changing hormone levels impact your 
brain function and mood symptoms.  
 
Background :  
Previous studies have shown that estrogen and progesterone play a role in postpartum depression. It is remains 
unclear why changes in estrogen and progesterone cause postpartum depression in some women and not others. 
You are being asked to participate because you are a woman between the ages of 2 1 and 45 in good medical 
health, taking no medication (with the exception of birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]), with regular menses. You also have given 
birth before, and you either had an epi[INVESTIGATOR_350289].  
 
Are there any reasons you should not be in this study?  
You will not be permitted to enter this study if you have important clinical or laboratory abnormalities  including 
any history of the following:  
·   any foreign metal objects or implants in your body as determined by [CONTACT_350382]  
·   endometriosis (an illness related to abnormal tissue growth around the uterus)  
·   enlargement of the ovaries  
·   liver disease  
·   breast cancer  
·   a history of blood clots in the legs or lungs  
·   undiagnosed vaginal bleeding  
·   porphyria (a rare genetic blood disorder)  
·   diabetes mellitus  
·   malignant melanoma (a type of skin cancer)  
·   gallbladder or pancre atic disease  
·   heart or kidney disease  
·   cerebrovascular disease (stroke)  
·   cigarette smoking of more than 10 cigarettes per day  
·   a history of suicide attempts or psychotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  
82 
  ·   recurrent migraine headaches with aura  
·      history of preg nancy -related medical conditions such as excessive vomiting, high blood pressure, deep 
vein thrombosis, or seizures  
·       menstrual cycle variability of greater than 7 days different from your normal cycle length or an abnormal 
level of follicle stimulat ing hormone  
·   current psychiatric diagnosis  
·       body mass index (BMI) greater than 35  
 ·      hormonal contraceptives that are implanted (i.e. progestin IUD or implant)  
 
In addition, you will not be permitted to participate if you have a first degree  relative (immediate family) with 
breast cancer that occurred before menopause, or breast cancer presenting in both breasts, or if you have multiple 
family members (greater than three relatives) with breast cancer.  
 
You may not take part in this study if y ou are pregnant or receiving any medication. If you are using a hormonal 
contraceptive, you must enter a washout period (i.e. stop taking the hormonal contraceptives and instead use a 
barrier contraceptive) and have [ADDRESS_435538] not change your medication dose 
without consulting the investigator. If adequate relief cannot be achieved by [CONTACT_350383], the drug will be 
stopped. Droppi[INVESTIGATOR_350290].  
 
How many people will take part in this study?  
There will be approximately [ADDRESS_435539]?  
This study will include [ADDRESS_435540] of UNC 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
What will happen if you take part in the study?  
  
Clinical and Health Screening:  
  
You will undergo a screening process to determine if you are e ligible for the study.  In order to protect you from 
adverse medication effects, you will be screened with a complete medical and psychiatric history, physical exam, 
and laboratory tests. During the initial visit, approximately 2 tablespoons (about 30 mls)  of blood will be drawn to 
test your hormone levels and liver and kidney function. We will also require that you have had a gynecological 
exam within the last three years. If you are eligible for the study, the results of your medical history, physical 
exam, and laboratory tests will appear in your UNC Health Care medical record.  
 
During the initial screening, you will be asked questions about your past mental health as well as questions about 
any symptoms you may be experiencing now. You will also be asked  to complete questionnaires about your mood 
symptoms and trauma history. You may choose not to answer any or all of the questions for any reason.  
[ADDRESS_435541] any such objects in your body, 
you cannot participate in the MRI session. Please ask the experimenter if you are unsure.  
  
You will also receive a urine drug screenin g prior to each MRI session to make sure that it is safe for you to 
receive the MRI and that your brain activity is not affected by [CONTACT_350384].  
  
Blood Samples and Screening:  
  
Blood samples will be taken at the start of the study and at times during the cou rse of the protocol. All blood 
samples will be drawn in the following way: you will be asked to sit down and after ten minutes a small plastic 
tube (catheter) will be placed in an arm vein, the blood sample will be drawn, and the catheter removed. During 
each of your in-person MRI  visits 30 ml (2 tablespoons) of your blood will be drawn. Estrogen, progesterone, and 
allopregnanolone  levels in your blood will be assessed.   
  
You will receive a pregnancy test before starting the study. You may not participate in this study if you are 
pregnant because the study drugs (Lupron, estrogen, and progesterone) may be associated with birth defects. We 
will ask that you use barrier contraceptive methods (diaphragm or condom or both) for the entire time you are in 
this st udy. To prevent pregnancy, we strongly recommend that you also continue barrier contraception for at least 
three months after the last injection of Lupron and until you have two to three regular menstrual cycles after the 
study has ended.  
  
Hormone Procedures:  
  
Once you finish the screening, we will ask you to have an injection of Lupron into a muscle, once a month for two 
months. You will  attend virtual video appointments every two weeks during the study when possible to minimize 
the risk of COVID -[ADDRESS_435542] two months, we will also ask you to take two different kinds 
of capsules that contain either estrogen and progesterone or placebo. You will not be aware of the real nature 
(hormones versus placebo) of the capsules you are taking, but you will know that at some point during these three 
months you will be started on a one - to two -month period of active medication. During this period,  you will 
receive up to 2 mg of estrogen (17 -beta estradiol) and [ADDRESS_435543] time the hormone capsules are switched over to 
placebo capsu les. After completing the medication period lasting two months, we will continue your follow -up at 
the clinic for another  month. At the end of the study, we will discuss the study results and their meaning with you.  
  
Brain Imaging:  
  
You will participate in two brain imaging sessions at the UNC Biomedical Research Imaging Center. During the 
COVID -[ADDRESS_435544] a temperature scan prior to entering the buil ding and will be 
84 
  asked to wait in one of the holding rooms. This will allow for yourself and the member of the study team to walk 
through the MRI center without possibility of encountering other staff members. In these sessions, magnetic 
resonance images ( MRIs) of your brain will be taken. An MRI is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_350291]. MRIs do not use x -rays or other radiation, and there are no known risks associated with 
MRIs. In this study, special MRIs (called functional MRIs or fMRIs) will be taken that provide information about 
what areas of the brain are made active by [CONTACT_350385]. You will view “stimuli,” including pi[INVESTIGATOR_350292]. The experimenter may ask y ou to push a button when 
particular stimuli appear on the screen.  
  
When you understand the task instructions, you will lie down on your back on a platform and your head will be 
positioned inside a helmet -like circular tube and the platform will be pushed inside the long tube of the MRI 
machine. The MRI technician will provide padding for your head and knees to make you more comfortable while 
lying down. If you are uncomfortable or feel pain because of lying down, please tell the technician immediately. 
You will be able to see outside of the helmet and outside the imaging machine by [CONTACT_51445] a mirror. In this way, 
you will be able to watch the pi[INVESTIGATOR_350293] a screen placed near your feet. If sounds are 
presented, you will hear them through  earphones. It is expected that each imaging session will take approximately 
2 hours.  
  
What are the possible benefits from being in this study?  
Research is designed to benefit society by [CONTACT_31283].  There is little chance you will benefit from  
being in this research study. However, you may learn about your sensitivity to changes in estrogen and 
progesterone levels, which may be useful if you plan to have children in the future.  
 
What are the possible risks or discomforts involved from being in this study?  
1) Mood changes – If you have never experienced an epi[INVESTIGATOR_350294], then your risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_350295], but this risk still exists. If you experience any 
depression symptoms, including th oughts about death or suicide , we ask that you inform us immediately. We will 
assess your mood each day during the study and at your bi -weekly clinic visits. The majority of participants 
complete the daily mood rating every day, and if you miss a day, we w ill contact [CONTACT_350386] a safety assessment 
over the phone. Once you have finished taking the medication for the study, you will only need complete the 
mood ratings once a week.  
  
If you experience severe mood symptoms or suicidal thoughts, then you not be a llowed to continue in the study. 
We will provide short -term treatment with medication for depression until your symptoms improve, however 
these costs will not be covered by [CONTACT_1758]. If you do not wish not to receive standard treatment with medication 
for depression, you may have to be transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_297363]. We can only treat you at UNC if 
you are either in a research study or agree to receive treatment after you have completed the research study. If you 
receive treatment at another  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], UNC will not cover the costs.  
  
Given the relatively brief nature and moderate severity of any mood symptoms that you may experience during 
this study, we do not anticipate that your mood symptoms will adversely impact your children. Nonetheless , we 
cannot guarantee the absence of effect, nor can we anticipate every risk that may result from your participation in 
this study.

  2) Lupron causes the ovary to stop working for a short period of time (one month). Lupron may cause the same 
side effects that are seen when the ovaries stop functioning permanently (menopause). Side effects may include 
hot flushes (flashes), decrease in libido, headaches, nervousness, irritability, muscle aches, trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and a 
slight decrease in bone density. The de crease in bone density is reversible and should not be related to an 
increased risk of bone fracture because of the short time you will receive Lupron treatment. Your menstrual 
periods may be irregular for [ADDRESS_435545] Lupron injection. Skin i rritation may occur at the site of 
injection. All side effects are reversible after the Lupron treatment is stopped, and many side effects, if they do 
occur, will be reversed by [CONTACT_350387]. At the dose of Lupron th at we 
will use, the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_350296]. Nevertheless, you will be monitored closely to see if 
side effects develop, and the medication will be stopped if side effects become intolerable.  
  
3) Estrogen capsules (Estrace, Microni zed 17 -beta-estradiol) – The risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_350297]. The most common side effects 
are nausea, breast tenderness or enlargement, and fluid retention (swellin g). There is a significantly increased risk 
of stroke following estrogen therapy in individuals with migraine with aura, as compared to individuals without 
aura, and as such, women with a history of recurrent migraine with aura will be excluded. Less commo n side 
effects are vomiting, depression, high blood pressure, a spotty darkening of the skin (mostly of the face), or 
vaginal bleeding. Any side effects that you may experience should stop after the end of the study. In the rare event 
that you experience s potty skin darkening, it may not disappear completely.  
  
Estrogen use increases the risk of certain medical gallbladder problems, and it may increase the risk of certain 
types of cancer. However, the risk of cancer is minimal because of the dose and the sh ort period of time estrogen 
is used in this study. The risk of cancer is also reduced because estrogen is given along with progesterone.  
  
Estrogen and progesterone may also cause an increase in birth defects if they are taken during early pregnancy. 
There fore, you should not become pregnant during this study. Pregnancy tests will be given during the screening 
phase, and you will not be allowed to participate if you are pregnant. The study will cover the cost of the 
pregnancy tests.  
  
You will be followed closely to see if side effects develop, and the medication will be discontinued if you 
experience negative or intolerable side effects.  
  
4) Progesterone capsules (Micronized progesterone) - Progesterone is used to treat a variety of gynecological 
disorder s. Side effects are not common and are usually mild. These include breakthrough bleeding (menstruation 
earlier than expected), edema (swelling), loss or increase of weight, jaundice, rash (with or without itching), 
breast tenderness, diarrhea, flatulence ( gas), vaginal discharge, loss or increase of sexual drive, faintness, uterine 
cramps, depressed mood, easily fatigued, drowsiness, lack of initiative, and skin color changes. During and 
shortly after the hormonal replacement you will probably experience so me vaginal bleeding.  
  
If you experience symptoms such as severe mood symptoms, nausea, hypertension (high blood pressure), 
vomiting or extreme fluid retention (bloating or swelling) from the medication, you will have the dose adjusted 
until you feel relie f. If you do not feel relief, then drug treatment will be discontinued. If vaginal bleeding or any 
other gynecological problem occurs, we will arrange for a visit with a UNC gynecologist, which may include a 
transvaginal ultrasound examination. If you expe rience marked discomfort during the insertion of the ultrasound 
[ADDRESS_435546] finds any abnormality during t he ultrasound, further testing may 
occur. If breakthrough bleeding occurs and is intolerable, you will be withdrawn from hormone replacement 
(which should precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047] a period).  
 
5) Blood drawing - You may experience some discomfort or temporary pain at th e site of the needle entry. There 
is a small risk of fainting and local infection.  
  
6) MRI sessions - There are no known risks from exposure to magnetic fields and radio waves used in the MRI 
session.  However,  it is not assured that harmful effects will not be recognized in the future.  A known risk is that 
strong magnetic fields attract iron or steel metal objects posing a safety risk.  Prior to this study you will be given 
a questionnaire to determine if you have any foreign iron or steel metal objects in your body, such as a pacemaker, 
shrapnel, metal plate, or metal debris.  If you have such objects in your body, you cannot participate in the MRI 
part of the study.  
  
If you participate in the MRI session, you will be asked to leave any metal objects in  lockers provided in the 
waiting room of the MRI center.  You will also be asked to remove any articles of clothing with metal inserts or 
clasps before entering the magnet room.  Please ask the experimenter if you are unsure.  It is possible you will feel 
uncomfortable or confined once inside the imaging machine.  This feeling usually passes within a few minutes as 
the experimenters talk with you and the study begins.  However, if this feeling persists, you can tell the 
investigators over the intercom and y ou will be removed immediately from the machine. On rare occasions some 
subjects may experience one or more of the following: momentary dizziness or nausea, a metallic taste, tingling 
sensations, or muscle twitches. Please tell the investigator over the in tercom if any of these sensations occur. 
Once inside the machine, you will hear loud mechanical clanging sounds. This is part of the normal operation of 
the machine. You will be given earplugs to reduce the sounds.  
  
6) There may be uncommon or previously unknown risks. If you have any symptoms or unexpected side effects 
during this protocol, please call the study physicians or nurses right away.  
 
7) COVID -19 Transmission – You may experience the potential risk to COVID -[ADDRESS_435547] to every degree possible. During  the in -person visits we will requir e 
masks at all times  which will be provided to you by [CONTACT_3476] , maintaining 6ft distance when possible, 
temperature checks on arrival to the UNC Biomedical Research Imaging Center, COVID -19 prescreening for 
yourself and staff at various timepoints including the day of the study visit, frequent cleaning with 90% alcoh ol or 
1:[ADDRESS_435548] 14 days and 
monitor your symptoms. If you experience any symptoms of COVID -19 including but not lim ited to: cough, 
[ADDRESS_435549] your Primary Care Provider and your local COVID -19 hotline 
to get tested fo r COVID -19. The study team and UNC Research are not responsible for any care or treatment of 
COVID -19. 
  
Addendum for Patients with a History of Gestational Diabetes, Glucose Intolerance, and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_350298]  
1) There is no evidence that estrogen or prog esterone directly causes gestational (pregnancy -related) diabetes or 
diabetes mellitus. Both birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_350299] -related diabetes or who currently have diabetes. However, it is possible that estrogen may influence 
how your body processes glucose. We will monitor your plasma glucose throughout the study, and if we detect 
increased blood sugar levels, we will ask you to stop participating in this study.  
  
2) Lupron and estrogen treatment ha ve been reported to aggravate migraine headaches. If you have a history of 
recurrent migraine headaches you may not participate in this study. Once Lupron is injected into your body its 
effects last for about four weeks and you may experience an increase i n headache frequency while under its 
influence. If this does happen, we will do our best to manage the pain. If your headaches become severe enough to 
require repeated medication, we may decide with you to discontinue your participation in this study.  
  
Addendum for Patients with a History of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] : 
There is some evidence that estrogen may increase the potential for seizures in some people. Progesterone has 
been shown to have the opposite effect. In the present study estrogen levels will not be higher th an peak 
pregnancy levels. In addition, estrogen will be administered along with progesterone. Thus, the likelihood of 
inducing seizures in someone who has been seizure -free should be very low. However, this possibility exists. If 
you develop a seizure, you r participation in the study will be stopped, and after assuring that you are medically 
stable, we will return you to the care of your primary physician for any follow up that will be required.  
 
What are the risks to a pregnancy or to a nursing child?  
You may not take part in this study if you are nursing or planning to get pregnant. You will take a pregnancy test 
to make sure that you are not pregnant before starting the study. Pregnant women are cannot participate because 
the study medications and the  MRI sessions may have adverse effects on an unborn child. We request that you use 
barrier contraceptive methods (diaphragm or condom or both) while you are in this study. We strongly 
recommend that you continue barrier contraception for at least three mon ths after the last injection of Lupron and 
until you have two to three regular menstrual periods after the study has ended. If you become pregnant during the 
study you should notify the researcher right away.  
  
What if we learn about new findings or infor mation during the study?  
You will be given any new information gained during the study that might affect your willingness to continue 
your participation.  
 
How will your privacy be protected?  
You will not be identified in any report or publication about this study. Although every effort will be made to 
keep research records private, there may be times when federal or state law requires the disclosure of our records, 
including personal informati on.  This is very unlikely, but if disclosure is ever required, UNC -Chapel Hill will 
take steps allowable by [CONTACT_350388].  In some cases, your information 
88 
  in this research study could be reviewed by [CONTACT_350389], research sponsors, or government 
agencies (for example, the FDA) for purposes such as quality control or safety.  
 
Your identity will be protected by [CONTACT_350390] a number and omitting your name [CONTACT_350432]. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_350300] a database for 
future research or scientific reports, and researchers at other institutions may therefore be able to examine your 
brain pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]. However, your name [CONTACT_350433] a database and researchers using these databases 
cannot learn your identity. If you are enrolled or become enrolled in another research study, we may share your 
results with researchers from that study, or we may obtain information about y ou from them. Identifiable data and 
the file that links your ID with your data will be accessible only to those working on this study, including research 
assistants and the PI. All computer files are kept on secure computers on a secure network.  
  
Audio re cordings of your clinical interviews will be identified by [CONTACT_350391] a secure computer 
accessible only to members of our research team. The recordings will be destroyed at the end of the study.  Only your 
research ID number will be t ape recorded along with your interview.  You may request to have the audio recording turned off 
if you are uncomfortable with recording your interview.  
Check the line that best matches your choice:

A copy of this consent form will be given to you.  
 
What will happen if you are injured by [CONTACT_31295]?  
All research involves a chance that something bad might happen to you.  This may include the risk of personal 
injury. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_31246], you might develop a reaction or injury from being in this study.  
  
If you become depressed or anxious as a direct result of participating this study, the UNC Department of 
Psychiatry will provide outpatient medical tr eatment. If vaginal bleeding or any other gynecological problem 
occurs, we will arrange for a visit with a UNC gynecologist. The research study will not cover the costs of such 
outpatient exams and treatment at UNC Health Care, you will need to use your ow n insurance to cover these 
costs.  
  
If you become sick or injured as a direct result of participating in this study, and your condition cannot be 
addressed with outpatient treatment, UNC Health Care will provide all needed inpatient medical treatment. UNC 
Health Care will not be able to reimburse you for costs of such inpatient medical treatment not covered by [CONTACT_37158]. No other form of reimbursement for study -related injury or illness is offered by [CONTACT_350392]. You do not give up any lega l rights by [CONTACT_30112].  
  
If you receive Medicare benefits,  UNC Health Care is required by [CONTACT_350393], complications, and injuries that arise from this study. Information that you are taking part in this stud y, 
medical treatments received, Medicare claims, and other personal information about your such as your name, 
social security number, and date of birth, will be provided to the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services and 
its agents and/or contractors for  this purpose.  
  
If you seek treatment outside of UNC Health Care, you will be responsible for the costs of your treatment.  
89 
   
What if you want to stop before your part in the study is complete?  
You can withdraw from this study at any time, without penalty.  The investigators also have the right to stop your 
participation at any time. This could be because you have had an unexpected reaction, or have failed to follow 
instructions, or because the entire study has been stopped.

I. Overview  
A. Brief description of the purpose of the study and study protocol  
The objective of the current project  is to by [CONTACT_350399] 
(HS+; n=15) show differences in the behavioral activation system relative to non -hormone 
sensitive women (HS -; n=15) under baseline and hormone challenge conditions using 
functional magnetic resonance ima ging (fMRI) and behavioral tests. The first aim is to 
determine the extent to which irritability is characterized by [CONTACT_350400]+ and HS -. The primary 
endpoints for this a im are 1) threat attention bias assessed during the visual dot -probe 
paradigm, 2) amygdala -medial PFC connectivity in response to threatening faces on the 
implicit emotion face processing task in HS+ (compared with HS -) during hormone 
challenge relative to  baseline. The secondary endpoints for this aim are the 1) correlation 
between IDAS -II irritability and treat attention bias, and 2) correlation between IDAS -II 
irritability and amygdala -medial PFC connectivity in HS+.  The second aim is to determine 
the ex tent to which irritability is characterized by [CONTACT_350401]+ and HS -. The primary endpoints 
for this aim are 1) reactive aggression during the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm, and 
2) amygdala and ventral striatum activation in response to frustrative non -reward (FNR) in 
HS+ (compared with HS -) during hormone challenge relative to baseline. The secondary 
endpoints for this aim are the 1) correlation between IDAS -II irritability and reactive 
aggression, and 2) correlation between IDAS -II irritability and amygdala and ventral striatum 
activation in HS+.

multiple family mem bers (greater than three relatives) with postmenopausal breast 
cancer will also be excluded from participating in this protocol;  
● Any woman meeting the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop Criteria (STRAW) 
for perimenopause will be excluded from participa tion. Specifically, we will exclude 
94 
  any woman with an elevated plasma FSH level (> 14 IU/L) and with menstrual cycle 
variability of > 7 days different from their normal cycle length.  
● Pregnant women will be excluded from participation (patients will be war ned not to 
become pregnant during the study and will be advised to employ barrier contraceptive 
methods), and women who become pregnant (although unlikely because of the 
hormone manipulation) will be withdrawn. The use of leuprolide acetate is not 
recommen ded during pregnancy. Prior to treatment, a complete physical, including a 
serum β -HCG test for pregnancy. Participants will be seen at the outpatient clinic on a 
regular biweekly basis. All participants will be required to use non -hormonal forms of 
birth control (e.g., barrier methods) to avoid pregnancy during this study. Participants 
will also undergo urine toxicology and pregnancy tests on the day of each of the two 
fMRI scans. If a woman becomes pregnant during the study, she will not complete the 
fMRI  scan, and the hormone protocol will be discontinued.  
 
     B. Adherence statement  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) outlined below will adhere to the protocol 
approved by [CONTACT_350402].  
 
II. Adverse Events  
A. Adverse event assessment  
This study defines adverse event as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the subject’s participation.  
 
Potential Risks to Human Subjects and Minimization of those Risks  
 
Hormone Protocol  
 
Participants may experience mild to moderate mood symptoms throughout the hormone 
protocol in the study. Participant’s mood symptoms will be monitored each day while on 
the hormone protocol, if any severe mood symptoms are reported short term treatment 
may be terminated and medication prescribed for depression as needed until symptoms 
improve.  
 
Psychological Assessment  
 
Clinical interviews and self -report assessments contain questions regarding sensitive 
personal information. As a result, parti cipants may become upset or embarrassed when 
discussing current or past distressing life events. This risk is necessary in order to assess 
past depressive symptoms and associated psychopathology. However, we have conducted 
several studies assessing past depressive symptoms in women, and participants are 
unlikely to become upset. If participants become upset during an assessment, they will be 
95 
  reminded of their right to discontinue participation, suicidal ideation will be assessed, and 
appropriate treatment r eferrals will be provided. Participants in need of medical follow -
up or psychological counseling will be referred to the UNC Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic. 
If a participant reports having suicidal thoughts, intent, plans, and means during the 
course of the study, she will be taken to the UNC Emergency Department for evaluation.  
 
MRI  
 
The psychological risks associated with the MRI include the discomfort some subjects 
encounter by [CONTACT_350403] (i.e., claustrophobia) 
and th e loud noise made by [CONTACT_350404]. These risks occur for all 
clinical MRI exams and are not increased by [CONTACT_350405]. Nonetheless, the 
steps taken to reduce these risks are described below.  
 
Claustrophobia  
The FDA does not provide  guidelines concerning claustrophobia. Some subjects may feel 
uncomfortable or confined once positioned within the MRI system. For some subjects, 
this confinement results in anxiety. The number of subjects who experience 
claustrophobic reactions during MRI  is uncertain. Approximately  5-10% of patients 
become claustrophobic during clinical MRI scans  (Kilborn & Labbé, 1990) . In one study,  
14.3% of 949 patients undergoing MRI testing in their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_350303]  (Murphy & Brunberg, 1997) . The numbers reported in the se 
studies are not representative of our experience at B RIC where terminated scans and 
panic are infrequent. This is not surprising, given that our volunteers choose to participate 
while patients have less choice. Also, patients may have additional anxieti es about their 
illness or diagnosis that contribute to their discomfort.  
 
We counter the risk of claustrophobia through subject selection and by [CONTACT_350406]. We will exclude from study those subjects who state that they are 
claustrophob ic. We talk to subjects frequently throughout the scan (particularly at its 
onset). We offer to keep the bore fan running to reduce heat and eliminate any fear of 
suffocation. We also provide an emergency ‘panic’ button so that he or she knows that 
help ca n be immediately summoned.  
 
We explain to the subjects that the sounds they will hear are a normal part of the 
scanning, and that mild apprehension in enclosed spaces is a normal reaction. Subjects 
are told that if they feel increasingly anxious during the  scan, they can ask to stop the 
scan. Experimenters listen for telltale signs of growing anxiety or discomfort, such as the 
subject repeatedly asking how much longer the scan will last. If a subject appears to be 
more than mildly anxious or declares himsel f or herself to be anxious, then the 
experimenter removes the subject from the scanner immediately. These studies are then 
reported to the IRB at the end of the year as incomplete studies. We have recently 
constructed a ‘mock scanner’ (or MRI simulator) fr om parts of a decommissioned GE 
scanner. The mock scanner has a bed that moves the subject into its bore, and a spare 
head coil is used for added realism. Recorded scanner noises are played from speakers 
hidden within the frame. Although there are no actua l magnetic fields present, the 
96 
  experience of being ‘scanned’ in the mock scanner is very realistic. Whenever possible, 
we familiarize naïve subjects in the mock scanner so that they know what to expect 
during the real study. Although we have no objective d ata yet to report, our expectation is 
that subjects who experience claustrophobia in the mock scanner will identify themselves 
to the experimenters at that time, and thus will be excused from further participation in 
the experimental protocol.  
 
Acoustic No ise 
 
The FDA guidelines limit the peak unweighted sound pressure level to less than 140 dB. 
The A -weighted root mean square (rms) sound pressure level is limited to [ADDRESS_435554] an EPA Noise Reduction Rate (NRR) of 
29 dB (when properly fit), or headphones that are rated for [ADDRESS_435555] an 
experimenter immediately if the scanner is ever uncomfortably or painfully loud.  
 
Confidentiality  
 
A breach of confidentiality could indicate to others a participants’ psychiatric history. 
Risk of breach of confidentiality is minimized by [CONTACT_350407] a study 
number on all research documents. Study documents that must contain personal 
information, including the informed consent document,  and the document that links study 
ID number to personal identifying information are kept in locked filing cabinets in locked 
rooms. All data will be stored in locked cabinets inside locked offices; electronic data 
will be stored only on password -protected  computers, and data encryption methods will 
be used during communication between investigators. Only study personnel will have 
access to these data. All study staff participate in annual human subject training that 
includes education about responsibilitie s to the minimize risk of confidentiality breach.  
 
Lupron  Side Effects  
 
We do not expect any adverse side effects associated with the hormonal manipulations 
outlined in this protocol for the following reasons: We have administered Lupron in 
previous studies in higher doses with minimal side effects, please see table 1 and 2 in 
MPD outlined in Section 1.5.  
 
Lupron :  The most frequent adverse effect of Lupron is hot flushes (flashes) Lupron -
induced hot flushes ha ve ranged in severity from occasional mild flushing to frequent 
[ADDRESS_435556] common side effects reported to occur were as follows: 1) hot flashes of 
mild to moderate intensity, 2) headache, 3) nervousness or irritability, and 4) insomnia.  
Local irrit ation at the injection site and a decrease in bone density, which totally reversed 
after the medication had been discontinued for six months. Blurred vision, myalgias, 
lethargy, memory disorder, and numbness have been reported in less than 3% of patients 
receiving the drug.  Thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolus, and congestive heart failure 
have occurred rarely in patients receiving Lupron, but a causal relationship to the drug 
has not been established.  Adverse GI effects occurring in 2% or more of patients  
receiving Lupron include nausea and/or vomiting, constipation, and anorexia.  Diarrhea 
and a sour or unusual taste in the mouth have been reported less frequently.  Other 
adverse effects of Lupron occurring in less than 3% of patients include decreased 
hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration, fatigue, fever, facial swelling, rash, hives, hair 
loss, and itching.  From our experiences with a longer protocol using the same 
medications in 15 women with a history of [COMPANY_003] and 15 controls, Lupron is well tolerated  
(no dropouts) with the most common side effect being hot flushes.  Limited information 
is available on the acute toxicity of Lupron.  Following subcutaneous administration of 
Lupron in rats at dosages 250 -500 times the usual human dosage, dyspnea, decreas ed 
activity, and local irritation at the injection site were observed; however, there is no 
evidence to date that overdosage in humans produces similar adverse effects.  Lupron 
dosages up to [ADDRESS_435557].  Recent longitudinal follow -up studies of girls and 
boys receiving GnRH agonists as a treatment for precocious puberty repor t the 
development of normal reproductive function, skeletal growth, and fertility (Feuillan et 
al., 1999, 2000) .            
 
Estradiol : Nausea is the most common side effect of estrogen administration.  At 
conventional replacement doses, higher than those employed in this protocol, this 
complaint seldom interferes with eating, and  no weight loss has been reported.  Breast 
engorgement, endometrial hyperplasia and bleeding are also common side effects of 
estrogen administration.  Pre -existing fibroid tumors of the uterus may enlarge under the 
effects of estrogen; however, at the dosa ge and for the duration of estrogen administration 
in this protocol this risk is small.  
 
The relationship between estrogen, both endogenous and exogenous, and the 
development of endometrial carcinoma has been suggested by [CONTACT_350408] (Gambrell, 1986) . Numerous retrospective case control studies published 
[ADDRESS_435558] that the optimal regimen to prevent 
hyperplasia during long term ERT and thus, inferentially, the risk of carcinoma, consists 
of 12 to 13 days of progesterone treatment each month w hen estrogens are administered 
(Nieman & Loriaux, 1992) . There is an increase in thromboembolism in women 
receiving non -contraceptive estrogen therapy (Cushman et al., 2004; Daly et al., 2001; F. 
Grodstein et al., 1996; Jick et al., 1996) . Additionally, some but not all studies report an 
increase in risk of st roke (Stampfer et al., 1991; Wassertheil -Smoller et al., 2003) in older 
women taking estr ogen therapy. However, these complications are unlikely at the dose 
and duration of estrogen replacement employed in this protocol, and in the younger age 
group of women who participate in this study.  One study (Chetkowski et al., 
1986) reported no effe ct of the estrogen patch on the four clotting indices previously 
shown to be altered by [CONTACT_350332] (Mandel et al., 1983; Melis et al., 1984; 
Nieman & Loriaux, 1992) .  Blood pressure, on average, appears to be unaffected by 
[CONTACT_350333], although both increases and decreases have been reported.  In 
observational studies, post -menopausal estrogen t herapy has been observed to lower the 
relative risk of cardiovascular disease in some but not all studies (Barrett -Connor & 
Bush, 1991; Stampfer et al., 1991) . In contrast, recent randomized controlle d trials in 
older postmenopausal women (e.g., Women’s Health Initiative [WHI]) report an 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease (Manson et al., 200 3). Emerging data suggest 
that these disparities in findings may be related to the timing of initiation of estrogen 
therapy in relation to the proximity of menopause.  Subgroup analyses of the combined 
estrogen and progestin (EPT) arm of the WHI demonst rated a significant interaction 
between coronary heart disease (CHD) risk and time since initiation of EPT, with an 
increased risk in the early years following initiation and a decreased risk in later years. 
Additionally, the increased risk of CHD was obse rved in older but not younger 
perimenopausal women (Francine Grodstein et al., 2006; Hsia et al., 2006; Lobo, 2004; 
Manson et al., 200 3; Prentice et al., 2005, 2006) . High doses of oral estrogens have been 
reported to elevate hepatocellular enzyme levels and, less commonly, cause cholestatic 
jaundice. The risk for gallstones and hepatocellular adenomas has been reported to be 
increase d in association with oral contraceptive use, and although uncommon these 
complications may also occur with the use of replacement doses of estrogen (Cirillo et 
al., 2005; Petitti et al., 1988) . Estrogen therapy also may increase the risk of urinary 
incontinence in older postmenopausal women (F. Grodstein et al., 2004; Hendrix et  al., 
99 
  2005; Steinauer et al., 2005) . Further, most studies have suggested an increased relative 
risk of breast cancer after four or five years' use (Beral, 1997; Chen et al., 2006; 
Chlebowski  et al., 2003; Colditz et al., 1995; Gann & Morrow, 2003; Grady & Ernster, 
1991; Li et al., 2003; Rossouw et al., 2002; Stefanick et al., 2006; Sturmer & Manson, 
2004; Wingo et al., 1987) , similar to the risk expected if the onset of menopause was 
delay ed for a comparable length of time. Due to the publicity surrounding the 
cancellation of the treatment arm of the Women’s Health Initiative study (Rossouw et al., 
2002)  that involved the administration of combined conjugated estrogens and 
medroxyprogesterone acetate (P rempro), we have included the following statement in the 
consent documents:  
 
Adverse Events Related to Combined Hormone Replacement and the Results of the 
Women's Health Initiative (WHI):  The WHI study demonstrated that continuous 
administration of one for m of estrogen (conjugated estrogens) in combination with one 
form of progesterone (medroxyprogesterone acetate) is associated with an increased risk 
of dementia, heart attacks, stroke, blood clots, and breast cancer.  Estradiol, the form of 
estrogen that w e use in this study, is administered as a sole agent (with the exception of 
one week's combination with progesterone) and, consequently, we do not expect that it 
will pose the increased risks observed with the chronic combination of the conjugated 
estrogen s and medroxyprogesterone administered in the WHI study.  Indeed, while the 
estrogen alone arm of the WHI trial was shown to be associated with an increased risk of 
stroke, no increased risk of either heart disease or breast cancer was observed (Anderson 
et al., 2004; Rossouw et al., 2002) . Estrogens may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_350259], and 
depression has also been reported to occur with the use of estrogens. In general, 
considering the dose and duration of treatment that we propose to use in this protocol, the 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_350260].  
 
Progesterone : Progesterone an d the synthetic progestins are widely prescribed, with 
indications including dysfunctional uterine bleeding, endometriosis, mastodynia, 
galactorrhea, and precocious puberty (Henzel, 1986) .  Side effects reported in women 
taking progestins may include breakthrough bleeding, edema, change in weight (increase 
or decrease), cholestatic jaundice, rash (with or without pruritus), depression, easy fatigue 
and se dation, lack of initiative, and chloasma.  Since progestins are often used in women 
with antecedent menstrual irregularity, it is not clear whether the breakthrough bleeding 
represents an effect of the medication or refractoriness to treatment.  In the lar ge majority 
of patients, menstruation occurs predictably following withdrawal of progestins and is 
usually more regular than in spontaneous cycles.  In a recent study, an average dose of 
[ADDRESS_435559] been associated with the estradiol component of the oral contraceptive. 
Thromboembolic disorders including thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, and 
cerebral and coronary thrombosis appear to oc cur with greater frequency in women 
taking oral contraceptives.  While the increased incidence of these disorders has been 
associated with the estradiol component of the oral contraceptives, it is now believed that 
the progestogen component may, to a lesse r extent, contribute to the increased risk.  
There are relatively few reports associating oral contraceptives with the development of 
carcinomas (vaginal, uterine, hepatic, and mammary) despi[INVESTIGATOR_350261], 
although this may reflect the la tent period needed for cellular transformation.   
 
Potential Benefits to Human Subjects  
This study  is designed to benefit society by [CONTACT_350409].  There is little 
chance women who participate  will directly benefit from being in the study. However, 
women who participate may learn about your sensitivity to changes in estrogen and 
progesterone le vels, which may be useful if they  plan to have children in the future.  If a 
participant is interested at the end of study, she will be welc omed to review any physical 
or mood related symptoms, she will also have the opportunity to learn more about 
whether she demonstrated hormone sensitivity throughout the study with the PI.  
 
 
B. Adverse event reporting  
1. This study defines an unanticipated problem as an incident, experience or outcome 
that is both unexpected  (in nature, severity, or frequency) and related or possibly 
related to the research.  
2. This study defines a serious adverse event as fatal or life threa tening, requires or 
prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_350304]/birth defect.  
3. Adverse events will be reported to the UNC -CH IRB and to the NIH as required. 
Following UNC -CH Adverse Event guidelines, eve nts that meet the criteria for an 
unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]) and are also 
serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB within one (1) week of the 
investigator becoming aware of the event. Any other events th at meet the criteria for a 
UPI[INVESTIGATOR_350305] (2) weeks of the investigator 
becoming aware of the problem. In accordance with the terms of the Federal Wide 
Assurance, the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) and the Feder al Drug 
Administration (FDA) are notified in a timely manner of 1) serious or continuing 
101 
  noncompliance; 2) significant adverse events involving risk to participants or others; 
or 3) suspension or termination of IRB approval for a study. Unexpected problems  
involving risk, unless the event is serious and related to the research, are not routinely 
submitted to the sponsor.  
4. Adverse events will be identified through clinical interviews, laboratory results, 
safety tests, and self -report questionnaires.  
5. Every eve nt will be reported to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_20196]. David Rubinow by 
[CONTACT_350410]. An adverse event report 
will be generated for each even and will include a description of the event, when and 
how it was r eported, and any official chart records or documentation to corroborate 
the event.  
6. The adverse event report will also include the severity attribution of the adverse event 
using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) scale: 0 = no adverse event or within 
norm al limits; 1 = mild AE, not requiring treatment; 2 = moderate AE, resolved with 
treatment; 3 = severe AE, resulted in inability to carry on normal activities and 
required professional medical attention; 4 = life threatening or disabling AE; 5 = fatal 
AE.  
7. The adverse event report will also include a determination of attribution according to 
the following scale: 0 = definitely not related; 1 = probably not related; 2 = possibly 
related; 3 = probably related; 4 = definitely related.  
 
III. Safety Review Plan and M onitoring  
 
Oversight of participant safety includes a review of adverse events as well as study progress, 
data integrity, and study outcomes.  
 
A. Justification of sample size  
 
We approximated power and sample size using a simpler model comparing the two gro ups on 
change scores from baseline to addback. With [ADDRESS_435560] sizes of 1.10, which are large and consistent with our previous study. We posit that if 
treatment with supra physiologic levels of reproductive hormon es does not produce large enough 
differences in neural circuits between HS+ and HS - to be detected in a relatively small sample of 
women, then this line of research, which involves significant participant burden, is not worth 
pursuing. Moreover, given the experimental nature of the proposed research, our effect size 
estimates are more similar to those seen in experimental animal research than in traditional 
human clinical trials. Nonetheless, our own and other previous clinical research supports our 
hypothe sized large effect. Studies comparing participants with major depression and controls 
have yielded effect sizes (Cohen’s d) ranging from 1.15 to 2.05 in dorsomedial PFC responsivity 
to negative emotional stimuli (Grimm et al., 2008; Hooley et al., 2005; Moses -Kolko et al., 
2010) and from 1.[ADDRESS_435561] (Epstein et al., 2006; Moses -
Kolko et al., 2011; Moria J Smoski et al., 2009) . Studies examining the association between 
amygdala activation and depressive symptom severity have yielded effect sizes (Coh en’s d) 
ranging from 1.62 to 2.76 (Hamilton & Gotlib, 2008; Moses -Kolko et al., 2010) .  
102 
   
Our target number of subjects to include in the fMRI analyses is N=30 (15 confirmed HS+ and 
15 confirmed HS -). Because we have not yet identified a mechanism by [CONTACT_350411] 100% accuracy, we will need to over -recruit women 
with a history of PND to account for those who end up not being HS+. In our previous study 11 
of the 15 women (73%) with a history of PND were HS+. For the current study, we therefore 
plan to over -enroll women with a history of PND in order to reach our target of 15 women with 
confirmed HS+. If 73% of women with a history of PND and no history of non -puerperal major 
depressive disorder are HS+, t hen we will need to enroll 21 women to find 15 with confirmed 
HS+. We anticipate a dropout rate of 9%, and as such, we have budgeted for an additional 3 
subjects to account for dropouts. In the prior study 2/3 of the women who withdrew from the 
protocol ha d a history of PND, so we anticipate 2 women with a history of PND and 1 control 
(without a history of PND) will withdraw from the proposed study. These numbers are 
summarized in the table below:  
 
Recruitment Group  Target 
Enrollment  Confirmed HS+/HS - 
(included in 
fMRI/behavioral 
analysis)  Not HS+/HS - 
(excluded from 
fMRI/behavioral 
analysis)  Withdrawn  
History of PND  23 15 HS+  6 not HS+  2 
Control (no history of 
PND)  16 15 HS - 0 not HS - 1 
TOTAL  39 30 6 3 
 
Thus, we plan to enroll a total of 39 subjects (n=16 without a history of PND, n=23 with a 
history of PND).  
 
B. Safety and study progress reviews  
1. The research coordinator will evaluate the study subjects at appropriate intervals and 
assess laboratory data and clinical signs for potential adverse events. The research 
coordinator will assist the PI [INVESTIGATOR_350306]. The research coordinator will also observe and document 
all adverse events, act on the PI’s recommendation, and maintain follow -up until 
reconciliation.

4. The frequenc y of the principal investigator’s review is detailed below:  
 Participant accrual —weekly  
 Study adherence and dropouts —Weekly  
 Adverse events —As events occur  
 Participant confidentiality —As events occur  
5. The annual report will include a list and summary of any adverse events; whether the 
adverse event rates are consistent with pre -study assumptions; a summary of 
recruitment and retention and reason for dropouts; and whether the study is on track 
to be comp leted and accomplish the stated aims.  
 
C. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869] —Individual Subject  
 
Participants with significant clinical or laboratory abnormalities will be discontinued 
from the study prior to estrogen administration. Adverse mood symptoms will be 
monitored by a dministering the Inventory for Depression and Anxiety Symptoms  II 
(IDAS -II) at each study visit and the DSRPs administered daily.  If suicidal thoughts or 
severe mood symptoms are observed at any period in the protocol, then PI [INVESTIGATOR_48105] -up 
with the subj ect by [CONTACT_648]. Anyone expressing concerns about their ability to continue in 
the study, will be considered to have severe mood symptoms and be discontinued from 
the protocol. In the event of the occurrence of severe mood symptoms, the protocol will 
be termi nated. Should this step prove to be unsuccessful, conventional medication will be 
prescribed as needed. Further, although we do not anticipate severe adverse reactions, we 
have arranged for inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_350308].  
 
IV. Informed Consent  
 
[ADDRESS_435563] at entry into the study. Potential 
participants will complete eligibility screening by [CONTACT_756]/online survey and by 
[CONTACT_350412] f irst study visit. Prior to the eligibility screening, 
potential participants will give verbal consent via the phone or will read and agree to a 
consent statement on an online survey before providing any information. No more 
information will be asked of par ticipants than necessary to obtain eligibility information 
and to contact [CONTACT_350413]. [CONTACT_276074], or her trained study staff, 
will obtain written informed consent from those individuals who pass the initial telephone 
or electronic screening and are interested in participating. During the consenting process, 
all of the applicable consent forms will be reviewed with each individual, and they will 
be given as much time as they would like to discuss their participation with their famili es 
and decide whether to participate.  
 
V. Data Quality and Management  
 
A. Measures to be taken to review data collection  
1. Data will be collected and analyzed as specified in the protocol:  
 
a. Study Design   
 
Once determined eligible and physically well, participants will begin a hormone 
protocol which will last for 8 weeks.  Participants will undergo a scaled down 
hormonal model of pregnancy and parturition (using ovarian suppression with the 
GnRH agonist Lupron and hormone addback with E2 and progesterone  P4) in 
order to examine how hormones influence neural function and irritability in 
experimentally confirmed HS+ and HS -. FMRI sessions will occur at baseline and 
following two weeks of hormone addback.  In the second study visit, women will 
have a basic la b panel and serum pregnancy test performed.  Prior to the hormone 
protocol women will receive a pelvic exam, breast exam, and Papanicolaou 
test.  Participants who can provide record of a pelvic exam and breast exam 
within the past year and normal pap resul ts within the past 3 years will be 
permitted to decline the GYN exam.  Women will be seen in the clinic each week 
during hormone protocol to assess blood levels of E2, P4 and mood symptoms.  
 
Clinical Assessments.  
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -V-TR Axis -I Disorders (SCID) (First 
et al., 2015) , and the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality (SNAP) 
(Clark, 1993)  will be administered during screening to assess past and present 
psychiatric illness and personality pathology. Each morning, starting at Study 
Visit 1, participants will complete the Daily Rating Form (Endicott et al., 2006)   
online, a [ADDRESS_435564] measures will be administered at  each study visit :  
 
The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms ( IDAS -II) is a 99-item self -
report questionnaire that comprehensively assesses anxiety and depression 
symptoms on 10 subscales. The IDAS -II has excellent psychometric properties 
and has been validated for assessing reproductive mood disorders.  
 
The Behavioral Inhib ition/Behavioral Activation (BIS/BAS) Scales (Carver & 
White, 1994)  is comprised of four subscales —BIS, Reward Responsiveness, 
Drive, and Fun Seeking —and 20 items total that assess behavioral inhibition 
(anxiety) and behavioral activation (impulsivity). We will also include the [ADDRESS_435565] Responsiveness Subscale (Wright et al., 2009)  to quantify 
lowered approach motivation following FNR (Hypothesis 2a). The BIS/BAS 
scales are associated with neural markers of psychopathology (Beaver et al., 
2006; Simon et al., 2010) . Exploratory analyses will be conducted to assess 
associations between BIS/BAS, IDAS -II irritability, be havioral, and fMRI data.  
 
Brief Irritability Test (BITe)  is a brief 5 -item self -report questionnaire that will 
assess irritability.  
 
Misophonia Questionnaire is 19 -tem self -report questionnaire that will assess 
misophonia and in turn irritability.   
 
fMRI Task and Protocol.  
 
The following tasks will be included in each of the two, one hour -long fMRI 
sessions:  
 
The i mplicit face emotion processing task (Stoddard et al., 2017)  will test whether 
HS+ is characterized by [CONTACT_350348] -medial PFC connectivity in response 
to threat (Hypothesis 1b), that robustly acti vates key limbic regions, including the 
amygdala. During the task, participants are asked to identify the gender of angry, 
happy, and fearful faces at 50%, 100%, and 150% emotion intensity presented in 
random order for 2000 milliseconds followed by [CONTACT_350414] d fixation. Trials will 
appear in 3 blocks, generating 30 trials of each emotion at each intensity and 90 
neutral face emotion trials. Adolescents with irritability and anxiety show reduced 
amygdala -PFC connectivity compared with those without anxiety duri ng this task 
(Stoddard et al., 2017) . 
 
The  Affective Posner Task (Tseng et al., 2017) will test whether HS+ is 
characterized by [CONTACT_350415] 
106 
  response to frustration (Hypothesis 2b), a well validated (Deveney et al., 2013; 
Rich et al., 2005, 2007, 2010)  adaptation  of the Posner spatial cueing task that 
includes both reward and FNR and activates key limbic and striatal regions, 
including the amygdala, caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens (Deveney et 
al., 2013) . This event -related task is divided into 3 runs: during Run 1 (practice 
run conducted outside of the  scanner), participants receive accurate feedback 
about their performance on the task and do not win or lose money; during Run 2, 
participants receive accurate feedback about their performance on the task and 
win or lose 50 cents per trial, based on their accuracy and reaction time; and 
during Run 3 (FNR), participants are told they must respond accurately to win 
money, but participants are given feedback that they responded too slowly on 
60% of accurate trials, regardless of their performance (Deveney et al., 2013) . 
During the FNR run, participants wit h mood dysregulation/irritability have 
demonstrated decreased amygdala and striatal activation relative to euthymic 
controls (Deveney et al., 2013) . This task also has good convergence with self -
reported irritability and frustration and excellent test retest reliability (Tseng et al., 
2017) , making it ideal for a repeated -measures study design. For the purpose of 
exploratory analysis, we will also include a resting state fMRI  scan.  
 
FMRI Data Acquisition and Image Processing.   
Scanning is performed using a Siemens Prisma scanner at the UNC BRIC. High -
resolution, T1 -weighted anatomical images will be acquired using an MPRAGE 
sequence. Whole -brain functional images will be acquired using a single -shot, 
gradient recalled echoplanar  pulse sequence sensitive to blood -oxygen -level -
dependent (BOLD) contrast. Each of [ADDRESS_435566], including corticolimbic 
regions (am ygdala, medial PFC) for the implicit face task and amygdala and 
striatum (caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens) for the Affective Posner. Image 
analyses will control for any group differences in reaction time or accuracy.  
 
Behavioral Assessments.  The follow ing tasks will be conducted outside the 
scanner at the end of visits 3 & 6: To test whether HS+ show a greater degree of 
threat attention bias (Hypothesis 1a), participants will complete a visual dot -probe 
paradigm (Salum et al., 2017.) , which measures attention bias toward angry faces. 
Each trial will start with a fixation cross, followed by a pair of faces (one on each 
107 
  side of the screen; in anger trials, one face is angry and the other is neutral), 
followed by [CONTACT_350416] (half of the time presented on the same side as the angry 
face and half of the time presented on the side of the neutral face). Trials will be 
of three types (angry -neutral, happy -neutral, and neutral -neutral) and presented in 
random order. Threat att ention bias will be calculated for the angry -neutral trials 
by [CONTACT_350417] t he neutral face. Using this task, previous 
studies have demonstrated that both irritable youths (Hommer et al., 2014; Salum 
et al., 2017)  and anxious adults (Bradley et al., 1999; Mogg & Bradley, 1999, 
2005)  have greater threat attention bias. To test whether HS+ show greater 
relational aggression (approach behavior) in response to frustration (Hyp othesis 
2a), participants will complete the brief Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm 
(Golomb et al., 2007) , which measures relational aggression and has been 
validated in adult women (Dougherty et al., 1999) . In the task, participants press a 
button to accrue money or press another button to subtract money from a 
(fictional) partner at no direct gain to themselves. Frustration is induced by 
[CONTACT_350352], which is attributed to the partner. 
Relational aggression is operationali zed as number of point subtractions the 
participant makes.

b. Statistical analysis strategy:   
This study has one between -subjects factor (group: HS+ versus HS -) crossed with 
one within -subjects factor (time: baseline versus hormone addback) with the 
outcome (percent signal changed) assessed in response to 2 tasks and in each of 2 
ROIs. Thus, for a task/ROI combination, there is a [ADDRESS_435567] to the change 
from baseline to hormone addback in percent activation. We will also assess the 
difference between the groups at baseline and at addback. Hypotheses 1c and 2c 
will be addressed only in HS+, by [CONTACT_350418] (1c) and FNR (2c). All hypothesis tests that are 
observed to be not statistically significant will be reported as being inconclusive.

DSMB RESPONSIBILITIES  
 
111 
  The initial responsibility of the DSMB will be to approve the initiation of this clinical trial. After this 
approval, and at periodic intervals (to be determined) during the course of the trail, t he DSMB 
responsibilities are to:  
 
● review plans for data safety and monitoring;  
● evaluate the progress of the trial, including safety events, accrual and retention, and other factors 
that can affect study outcome;  
● make recommendations to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_350314], termination, or other modifications of 
the trial based on the reported beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under study;  
● if appropriate, review interim analysis of efficacy in accordance with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_350315] i n advance of data analysis and have the approval of the DSMB;  
● assist the UNC -CH IRB by [CONTACT_350369], and sample size.  
 
MEMBERSHIP  
 
The DSMB will consist of at least three members, and the presence of all three members will be 
required to constitute a quorum. The members, recommended by [CONTACT_264965],  will include an obstetrician -
gynecologist, a biostatistician, and a psychiatrist (not affiliated with the UNC Department of Psychiatry) 
and will be subject to approval by [CONTACT_84041] -CH IRB.  Membership will consist of persons completely 
independent of the investigators who have no financial, scientific, or other conflict of interest with the 
trial. Collaborators or associates of [CONTACT_14817] are not eligible to serve on the DSMB. Written 
docu mentation attesting to absence of conflict of interest is required. The DSMB includes experts in or 
representatives of the fields of:  
 
• a psychiatrist with relevant clinical experience,  
• an obstetrician -gynecologist with relevant clinical experience;  
• clinical tr ial methodology, and  
• biostatistics.  
 
The DSMB chairperson will be responsible for overseeing the meetings, developi[INVESTIGATOR_350316] -CH IRB, as required. The chair is the contact [CONTACT_350371].  
 
A Safet y Officer will be identified by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_350317]. This person will be the contact [CONTACT_350421]. The Safety Officer will notify the DSMB and UNC -CH IRB of 
serious adverse events within [ADDRESS_435570]. Schiller will prepare the 
agenda to address the review of the manual of operating procedures,  modification of study design,  
initiation of the trial, identification of a safety officer, reporting of adverse events, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], 
interim analysis plan, etc.  
 
Meetings of the DSMB will be held two times a year at the call of the Chairperson. Meetings shall be 
closed to the public because discussions may address confidential patient data. Meetings are attended, 
when appropriate, by [CONTACT_3433] e principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_350280]. Meetings may be convened as 
conference calls as well as in person, although the initial meeting will be face -to-face. An emergency 
meeting of the DSMB may be called at any time by [CONTACT_350422] -CH IRB should 
questions of patient safety arise.  
 
MEETING FORMAT  
 
An appropriate format for DSMB meetings consists of an open and closed session. The open sessions 
may be attended by [CONTACT_458](s), institution staff and UNC -CH IRB staf f, and the study 
biostatistician. Issues discussed at open sessions will include the conduct and progress of the study, 
including patient accrual, compliance with protocol, and problems encountered. Patient -specific data and 
treatment group data will not b e presented in the open session.  
 
The closed session will be attended only by [CONTACT_93526]. The DSMB may request others to 
attend part or all of the closed sessions (e.g., the study statistician, UNC -CH IRB staff). All safety and 
efficacy data will and must be presented at this session. The discussion at the closed session will be 
completely confidential.  
 
Should the DSMB decide to issue a termination recommendation, full vote of the DSMB will be 
required. In the event of a split vote, majority vote will rule, and a minority report should be appended.  
 
REPORTS  
 
 
 
Interim Reports: Interim reports will be generally prepared by [CONTACT_350423] [ADDRESS_435571] of two parts:  
113 
   
Part 1 (Open Session Report) will provide information on study aspects such as accrual, baseline 
characteristics, and other general information on study status.  
 
Part 2 (Closed Session Report) may contain data on study outcomes, including safety data, and 
depending on the study, perhaps efficacy data. The Closed Session Report is considered 
confidential and should be destroyed at the conclusion of the meeting. Data  files to be used for 
interim analyses will have undergone established editing procedures to the extent possible. 
Interim analyses of the efficacy data are performed only if they are specified and approved in 
advance and criteria for possible stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_8169] c learly defined.  
 
Reports from the DSMB:  A formal report containing recommendations for continuation or 
modifications of the study prepared by [CONTACT_350424]. Once approved by [CONTACT_4318], t he formal DSMB recommendation will be 
forwarded to [CONTACT_14817]. It is [CONTACT_14817]’s responsibility to distribute the formal DSMB 
recommendation report to tall co -investigators and to assure that copi[INVESTIGATOR_350318]. 
 
As previously stated, the formal DSMB report should conclude with a recommendation to 
continue or to terminate the study. This recommendation should be made by a formal majority 
vote. A termination recommendation may be made by [CONTACT_350425] b y a majority vote. 
The DSMB Chairperson is responsible for notifying the PI [CONTACT_4007] a decision to terminate the study. 
In the event of a split vote in favor of continuation, a minority report should be contained within 
the regular DSMB report. The report should  not include unblinded data, discussion of the 
unblinded data, etc.  
 
Mailings to the DSMB: On a scheduled basis (as agreed upon by [CONTACT_4318]) blinded safety data should 
be communicated to all DSMB members or to the designated safety officer (to be determine d at the first 
meeting). Any concerns noted should be brought to the attention of the DSMB Chairperson.  
 
Access to Interim Data:  Access to the accumulating endpoint data should be limited to as small a group 
as possible. Limiting the access to interim data  to the DSMB members relieves the investigator of the 
burden of deciding whether it is ethical to continue to enroll  patients and helps protect the study from 
bias in patient entry and/or evaluation.  
 
CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
All materials, discussions and proceed ings of the DSMB are completely confidential. Members and 
other participants in DSMB meetings are expected to maintain confidentiality.

The “you” referenced in this information sheet either refers to the participant, “your child”, or the 
individual you are providing consent on behalf of as a legal authorized represe ntative, as applicable.  
 
The following information should be read as an addition to the original Consent process. Unless 
specifically stated otherwise in the following paragraphs, all information contained in that original 
Consent Form is still true and re mains in effect. Your participation continues to be voluntary. You may 
choose not to participate or may withdraw your consent to participate at any time, and for any reason, 
without jeopardizing your future care at this institution or your relationship wit h your study doctor.  
 
New or additional information  
COVID -19 is a  novel (previously unidentified) coronavirus and has been declared a  pandemic  due to its 
global spread.  The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19), is not the same as 
the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans  and usually cause mild illness, like the 
common cold.   Many countries, states, and local governments have implemented restrictions (e.g., 
physical d istancing requirements, closure of public places) to attempt to limit the spread of the virus.  If 
your community does not permit travel or otherwise limits interaction, please tell the study team .  UNC’s 
permission for certain studies to continue is not i ntended to interfere with a person’s ability to follow 
their community’s requirements.  
 
Physical distancing is the primary strategy used to prevent the spread of the virus that causes  COVID -
19. Physical distancing calls for people to increase the space between one another and to avoid 
gatherings and crowds. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says people should 
maintain a distance of at least six feet from others when p ossible.  
 
If you choose to continue your participation in research at UNC project research personnel will do their 
best to follow the below recommendations described in this information sheet that were developed 
based on guidance from the CDC and in partne rship with study teams, departments,  and UNC’s 
Infectious Disease specialist. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_350320]’s efforts, there is still the risk that you may already have 
or may become infected with COVID -[ADDRESS_435573] had a wide range of reported symptoms – ranging from mild symptoms to 
severe illness which may lead to death.   Symptoms may appear  2-[ADDRESS_435574] COVID -19: 
• Cough  
• Shortness of breath or  difficulty breathing  
• Fever  
• Chills especially repeated shaking chills  
• Muscle pain  
• Sore throat  
• New loss of taste or smell  
• Vomiting and diarrhea  
This list is from the CDC but may not include all possible symptoms.  People experience the virus in 
many differ ent ways.  Please contact [CONTACT_350427].  
Pandemics can be stressful for everyone. Fear and anxiety about a disease can be overwhelming and 
cause strong emotions in both adults and children .  Please talk with the study team if you are 
experiencing COVID symptoms, fear or anxiety.   
 
Please seek emergency medical care immediately if experiencing the following symptoms:  
 
• Trouble breathing  
• Persistent pain or pressure in the chest  
• New confusion  
• Inability to wake or stay awake  
• Bluish lips or face  
*This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that 
are severe or concerning to you.  Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the 
operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID -19.  
 
Children and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS -C) 
Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS -C), is a condition in children where different body parts can 
become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes,  or gastrointestinal organs.  We 
do not yet know what causes MIS -C, however we know that many children with MIS -C had the virus 
that causes COVID -19, or had been around someone with COVID -19.  MIS -C can be serious, even 
deadly, but most children who have b een diagnosed with this condition have gotten better with medical 
care.  
Contact [CONTACT_51443]’s doctor, nurse, or clinic right away  if your child is showing  symptoms of MIS -C: 
• Fever  
• Abdominal pain  
• Vomiting  
• Diarrhea  
• Neck pain  
• Rash  
116 
  • Bloodshot eyes  
• Feeling extra tired  
 
Be aware that not all  children will have all the same symptoms.  Seek emergency care right away  if 
your child is showing any of these  emergency warning signs of MIS -C or other concerning signs:  
• Trouble breathing  
• Pain or pressure in the chest that do es not go away  
• New confusion  
• Inability to wake or stay awake  
• Bluish lips or face  
• Severe abdominal pain  
What steps are the study team and UNC taking to prevent the spread of COVID?  
To help prevent the spread of COVID study teams across UNC are taking the following steps:  
Conducting an individual risk assessment with subjects to determine if the individual is part of a high -risk group as 
defined by [CONTACT_350428].  The wellness screen will include questions about whether the you have 
or had COVID -19, possible exposure to the virus, possible symptoms, and about risk factors.  
 
If the subject would like to participate but is in a high -risk group as defined by [CONTACT_350429] 65, live in a nursing home  or long -term care facility, or who have underlying medical conditions, 
particularly if not well controlled, they should discuss if study activities can be safely delayed with the study team 
or if participation should continue.  
 
1. Prior to a face -to-face visit, research personnel must confirm your appointment and perform 
telephone wellness screenings no more than [ADDRESS_435575] be rescreened by [CONTACT_350430] (i.e., to confirm 
there are no symptoms, no fever, etc.). You and anyone required to attend the vis it must 
be masked upon arrival at the clinic/research site. Anyone who fails rescreening will be 
immediately isolated in a private room. Clinical study personnel will be contact[CONTACT_350431]. You may be responsible for cost of testing, and treatment of COVID -[ADDRESS_435576] developed and implemented a regular schedule for frequently 
cleaning and wipi[INVESTIGATOR_350321] (e.g., door and cabinet handles, faucets, light 
switches, keyboards, and o ther frequently touched objects) with an approved disinfectant or 
117 
  disinfectant wipes. Research personnel will also follow routine surface decontamination of 
common equipment like instrumentation and computers. Disinfecting any surfaces that may be 
thought to be contaminated and use an approved disinfectant such as a 1:10 dilution of bleach 
or 60% to 90% alcohol solution.  
5. Research that involves participants of [ADDRESS_435577] wear masks.  
6. If research involves travel or overnight stays, accommodation and meals should allow for 
adequate physical distancing (6 feet or more) wherever feasible. Vehicle occup ancy should be 
limited to no more than two people in a standard car, with open windows while travelling, if 
possible. Vehicle occupants should wear masks.  
7. Some locations may have additional safety procedures.  If your visit is at such a location, the 
study  team will describe what to expect when they call to confirm your study visit.  
If you feel as though the above precautions are not being followed please either talk with the study 
staff, submit an anonymous request through Ethics Point by [CONTACT_3379] 1 -[PHONE_7246], or reach out to the 
UNC OHRE IRB at [ADDRESS_435578] concerns 
about safety.

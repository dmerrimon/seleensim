The cardiac  natriuretic  peptide  (NP) system  may protect  against  the development  of 
cardiometabolic  risk.  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
2.[ADDRESS_574444] that glucocorticoids potently stimulate NP production. There are 
limited studies in humans showing that glucocorticoids sti mulate NP production;[ADDRESS_574445] is to generate preliminary data  that will be used to 
develop power calculations, inform cutoff ranges, and inform the timing of the NP response 
for larger subsequent studies .” In 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will quantify the distribution of NP responses and characterize the time 
course of NP responses to a highly standardized dosing protocol of dexamethasone. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_450640].  
 
Aim:  To determine  the range of distribution and time course of NP responses to a single dose of 
dexamethasone IV 4 mg in healthy lean individuals.

Protocol Date: 08/18/2017 Hypothesis:  Determination of the NP responses (the range and time course of changes in NP 
levels) to dexamethasone in [ADDRESS_574446] that glucocorticoids potently stimulate NP production. Administration 
of dexamethasone to rats caused an increase in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) expression in 
the heart, where ANP is produced.4

5.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
 
Subjects will be recruited via the Vanderbilt Broadcast email system  
([EMAIL_8640] ).  
 
ResearchMatch.org will be utilized as a recruitment tool for this protocol.  ResearchMatch.org is 
a national electronic, web -based recruitment tool that wa s created through the Clinical & 
Translational Science Awards Consortium in 2009 and is maintained at Vanderbilt University as 
an IRB -approved data repository (see IRB #090207).   
 
 
6.[ADDRESS_574447]’s medical history and medications will be 
discussed and  documented. A  physical exam, including meas urement of height, weight, and 
vital signs , will be performed .  Blood will be collected for a comprehensive metabolic panel, 
CBC, and Hemoglobin A1c, and a urine pregnancy test  will be done  on female subjects of child -
bearing age . Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed to confirm that the subject meets 
study eligibility requirements.   
 
Eligible subjects who wish to participate in the study will be scheduled for 4  additional 
outpatient visits at the CRC. Subjects will be instructed to subjects to continue their habitual 
sodium intake for several days prior to the study and throughout the study. The Study design 
and CRC Protocol Over view are shown in the Figure and Table  below, respectively.

CRC Visit - Day 1  
 
Subjects will arrive at the CRC in the early morning (around 7 AM). Subjects will have fasted for 
at least [ADDRESS_574451] will be done on female subjects of child -bearing age.  Immediately after urinating, subjects 
will be instructed to lay in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] , and they will remain in this supi[INVESTIGATOR_450641], including during voiding (subjects will be instructed to use a 
bedpa n or urinal jug when voiding, as they must remain supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). Supi[INVESTIGATOR_450642]. One peripheral IV will be placed , which will be 
used for blood draws. Normal (0.9%) Saline (NS) will be infused at a rate  of approximately 10 
ml/hr to keep the IV line open and ensure successful subsequent blood draws.  
 
After the subject s have  been lying supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] 60 minutes, a baseline blood sample will be 
collected for NP, RAAS measurements  (aldosterone, plasma renin acti vity), cortisol,  basic 
chemistries , and markers of glucose metabolism (glucose, insulin level) . Immediately 
afterwards, subjects will receive an intravenous injection of dexamethasone [ADDRESS_574452] 3 hours , and then every 60 minutes during the 
following 5 hours. Additional blood, at each time point, may be used to run other tests , 
including dexamethasone levels to help  determine clearance rate of dexamethasone  which may

injection . At this time (8 hours after the dexamethasone injection), the study procedures for 
Day 1 will conclude.   A meal  will be provided at the completion of the visit.  
 
All urine produced during the visit will be collected and some saved for future analysis.  Subjects 
will be asked to produce a urine sample  approximately every 120  minutes throughout the study 
visit; however, if the subject is unable to void at the pre -specified time points , urine will be 
collected when the subject is able to void and the time that the urine was produced will be 
record ed. Vital signs will be recorded every [ADDRESS_574453]’s sodium intake during the [ADDRESS_574454] 8 hours. There will be one blood draw at each visit; the blood will be 
collected approximately [ADDRESS_574455] confidenti ality. 
 
 
 
7.0 Risks of Investigational Agents/Devices (side effects)  
 
General :  Risks related to overnigh t fasting include hypovolemia. Thus, s ubjects will  have 
baseline blood pressure measured upon arrival at the CRC. The risk s associated with 
phlebotomy in h ealthy individuals are minimal. Volume depletion and anemia are possible risk s 
of phlebotomy;  these risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_450645], as well as by [CONTACT_450646] a CBC 
at the screening  visit and by [CONTACT_450647] . Risks related to the 
placement of the peripheral intravenous lines include hem atoma formation and phlebitis. In 
addition, there is a potential risk of hypoglycemia while fasting overnight and during the 
morning until study procedures are completed. The risk of hypoglycemia in healthy individuals 
while fasting for this amount of time is low. Subjects will be provided a meal at the conclusion 
of the infusion.  
 
Protocol Version  #: 3  8 
Protocol Date: 08/18/2017 Dexamethasone:  Potential adverse reactions to dexamethasone include infection, hypertension, 
increased blood glucose, headache, fatigue, emotional lability, increased appetite, nausea, 
abdominal discomfort, drug hypersensitivity , and increased bone turnover or bone loss . 
However, these potential adverse reactions are much more likely to occur with extended or 
chronic use of dexamethasone , and are much less likely with a single dose of dexamethasone . 
In the current study, we are giving a single IV dose of dexamethasone, w hich has a rapid half -
life and thus is cleare d rapi[INVESTIGATOR_450643].  
 
8.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to 
Participant s or Others  
 
Adverse events will be reported to the IRB per Vanderbilt University Medical Center IRB policy.  
 
9.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time  and should notify study personnel if they 
wish to withdraw from the study . Subjects may request their biological samples to be destroyed 
at any time. However, any data or biological samples that have already been used for research 
cannot be destroyed.  Subjects may be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the 
investigators’ (possible reasons listed below). Subjects will receive financial compensation for 
the visits that they complete.  
 
Possible reasons for withdrawal /discontinuation  from study in clude, but are not limited to:  
 Development of an active infection at the time of the Day 1 visit  
 Noncompliance with treatment or procedures  
 Decision by [CONTACT_3445]/participant withdraws consent  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Starting a medication mentioned in exclusion  criteria ( glucocorticoids other than what is 
prescribed in the study, antihypertensive medications, metformin, or any antidiabetic  
medications , any medications known to affect dexamethasone metabolism ) 
 Development of a significant medical condition spec ified in the exclusion criteria  
 In female subjects, becoming pregnant during study  
 Significant adverse event deemed by [CONTACT_450648]  
 
 
10.0  Statistical Considerations  
 
The two primary endpoints will be the NT -proANP trajectory (NT -proANP levels across time) 
and NT -proBNP trajectory (NT -proBNP levels across time). We will also measure ANP and BNP 
to fully define their kinetics. The descriptive statistics, such as mean, me dian, range, and 
standard deviation, will be examined at each time point. The mean levels of the endpoints will 
be plotted by [CONTACT_450649]. The null hypotheses are that NT -proANP 
will not change over time (slope of NT -proANP traje ctory= 0) and that NT -proBNP will not 
 
Protocol Version  #: 3  9 
Protocol Date: 08/18/2017 change over time (slope of NT -proBNP trajectory= 0). For our analysis, we will use restricted 
maximum likelihood (REML) -based mixed effect model analyses for the two primary endpoints: 
1) NT -proANP trajectory as the ou tcome and time points  as covariates, and 2) NT -proBNP 
trajectory as the outcome and timepoints as covariates.  
 
11.0  Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
Strict confidentiality will be maintained to the fullest extent by [CONTACT_5051],  includin g 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_56568] a secure location. All specimens will be coded after they are obtained and 
the code key kept in a secure location .  Blood samples will be coded anonymously to remain 
confidential and identifiers will be ke pt in a separate, secure  location.   Samples may  be shared 
with third parties outside of Vanderbilt for future testing but will remain anonymous to the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].   Subjects may contact [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_450644].

1.0 Objectives  
 
1.1 Describe  the purpose, specific aims, or objectives of this research. Specifically, 
explain why it is important to do the study.  
Historically, pregnant women were advised to refrain from exercise due to concerns of maternal 
and fetal risk such as preterm de livery, low infant birth rate and fetal stress.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_278126], fetal, and infant health, only 9 -
15% of pregnant women meet the current physical activity recommendations.1-3 In addition, 
pregnancy exercise research is confounded by a lack of randomized controlled trials (RCT) that 
include diversity in participant demographics, specifically inner city populations, and difficulty 
accurately quantifying weekly exercise volume. We propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_48085] t RCT investigating two 
different approaches to exercise intervention across a spectrum of demographics that we believe 
will result in improved exercise adherence as well as in maternal and infant health outcomes.  
 
 
1.2  State the hypothesis to be tested, if applicable.  
NOTE:  A hypothesis is a specific, testable prediction about what you expect to 
happen in your study that corresponds with your above listed objectives.  
 
Specific Aim #1:  To determine the feasibility of two types of exercise interventions (supervised 
& home exercise) in terms of design, implementation and adherence.  Our working hypothesis  is 
that both supervised and home exercise interventions will be imp lementable as designed in 
pregnant women as evidenced by [CONTACT_193531], eligibility, retention, follow -up and exercise 
adherence from 1st trimester through [ADDRESS_339577] -natal at a 60% rate, but that adherence to the 
two types of exercise interventions will differ by [CONTACT_44009].  A secondary exploratory 
hypothesis is that we will be able to successfully recruit and retain 50% of our pregnant women 
from the Syracuse Community Health Center (primarily women with lower resources).  
 
                                                                 Page 2 of 32  Specific Aim #2: To determine  the appropriateness of the outcome measures proposed for the 
exercise intervention in detecting changes in maternal aerobic fitness, quality of life (QOL), 
fatigue, sleep quality, depression, and weight change throughout pregnancy and [ADDRESS_339578]; SF -12 Generic Quality of Life (QOL); 
Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI); Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQLI); Center for 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6328] (CES -D); Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale 
(EPDS); and the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ). Our working hypothesis  is 
that the above outcome measures will be able to detect changes in maternal outcome measures in 
both exercise groups.  
 
2.0 Scientific/Safety Endpoints  
 
2.1 Describe the scientific endpoint(s), the main result or occurrence under study.   
NOTE:  Scientific endpoints are outcomes defined before the study begins to determine 
whether the objectives of the study have been met and to draw conclusions from the data.   
Include primary and secondary endpoints.  Some example endpoints are:  reduction of 
symptoms, improvement in quality of life, or survival.  Your response should not be a 
date.   
The scientific endpoint of this project is determining if the study is feasi ble in terms of the 
proposed approach and if the planned outcome measures are appropriate for detecting change in 
the maternal dependent variables in all three participant groups.  
 
 
3.0 Background  
 
3.1  Provide the scientific or scholarly background, ratio nale, and significance of the 
research based on the existing literature and how it will contribute/fill in gaps to existing 
knowledge.  
Physical activity during pregnancy has substantial benefits for maternal and fetal health including: 
reduced risk of exc essive weight gain, developi[INVESTIGATOR_278127] -eclampsia (PE), gestational diabetes mellitus 
(GDM) and gestational hypertension (GH), pre -term birth, macrosomia; depressive symptoms, and 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_278128]; and, can improve maternal sleep; and neonatal neuro motor skills at [ADDRESS_339579] a higher pre -pregnancy body mass index (BMI) than Caucasian women and have a 
higher obesity rate, non -Caucasian pre gnant women are less likely to engage in exercise and participate in 
more sedentary activity compared to Caucasian pregnant women.19-[ADDRESS_339580] 
trimester and continuing until birth is not asso ciated with an increased risk for preterm birth (<37 weeks) 
                                                                 Page 3 of 32  or low birth weight, even in previously sedentary women; and, does not compromise maternal or fetal 
health as assessed by [CONTACT_278145], type of delivery, incidence of preterm delivery, bir thweight, 
neonatal head circumference, Apgar score or neonatal complications.23-[ADDRESS_339581]-natal period, it is imperative that we discover how to promote participation and adherence to an 
appropriate pre -natal exercise intervention across a spectrum of demographics.

4.1  Describe and explain the study design (e.g. case -control, cross -sectional, 
experimental, interventional, longitudinal, and observational). Indicate if there is 
randomization, blinding, control group, etc. If randomizing, explain how this will be 
                                                                 Page [ADDRESS_339597] a complex study design (i.e., multiple arms and 
treatments), include  a schematic diagram . 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_115834] (feasibility) of a future larger study of i nterventional design with 
randomization.  Participants in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_278130]  a free

5.[ADDRESS_339598]  a survey and interview of subjects related to acceptability to participate in EX 
and HOM EEX and discuss barriers to regular exercise which will be analyzed using descriptive statistics 
and a phenomenological approach.   To determine the feasibility of mat ernal and infant outcomes, 
Kruskal -Wallis and Friedman’s ANOVA will be used to investigate between group and within group 
differences.  Relationships between variables will be analyzed using Spearman correlation coefficient.  
Because this is a feasibility study, the results will be used as preliminary data to apply for future funding 
and also will provide variable quantitative and qualitative data for validating  interventions that can 
increase adherence to exercise guidelines during pregnancy in women with different ethnic and 
socioeconomic backgrounds.  
 
 
 
5.2 If appli cable, provide a power analysis  for the number of subjects to be included. 
If qualitative research, so state, and provide general justification for the total number of 
subjects proposed.   
NOTE:  This may not apply to certain types of studies, including chart/records 
reviews, survey studies, or observational studies.  This question is asked to elicit whether 
the investigator has an adequate sample size to achieve the study objectives and jus tify a 
conclusion.

Eighteen low risk pregnant women with a singleton pregnancy will be recruited for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_278136] (50%), University OB/GYN Associates, and 
Upstate Community OB/GYN.   All wo men will be enrolled during the 1st trimester (6 to 13 -
weeks’ gestation) and without absolute contraindications to moderate intensity exercise during 
pregnancy as defined by [CONTACT_278146] (ACSM) and American College 
of Obstetricians a nd Gynecologists (ACOG). 44-45 All participants will be cleared for exercise by 
[CONTACT_278149]/GYN . The ACSM and ACOG guidelines include 150 min/wk of cardiovascular activity 
at a moderate intensity; 2 -3 days/week of resistance training; and 2 -3 days/wk of flexi bility 
training.44-45 Clearance will come exclusively from the OB/GYN.  
                                                                 Page 13 of 32   
Women will be randomly assigned to either UA, EX or HOMEEX.  Women randomized to EX 
will attend three exercise classes/week at the Institute for Human Performance (IHP) and given 
flexibility to attend classes between the hours of 7:30a -6p, Mon -Fri.  Each session will consist 
of: 5-min flexibility warm -up and cool -down; 40 min of moderate intensity calculated as 40 -59% 
Heart Rate Reserve (HRR) along with Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE ) between 13 -14; and 
20 minutes of resistance with an additional 30 minutes of unsupervised home aerobic activity per 
week.  The women will be given their choice of aerobic equipment or walking either track / 
treadmill to achieve a total of 40 minutes of mo derate intensity exercise.  
  
Women assigned to HOMEEX will receive instructions for their home walking program 
including tips for walking indoors and outdoors, exercise handouts for warm -up/cool -down 
activities, demonstrations for resistance training acti vities and an exercise log.  HOMEEX 
women will be contact[CONTACT_278150], barriers/challenges faced, ask 
questions, and strategies to achieve the exercise guidelines.  If women in either EX or HOMEEX 
are unable to achieve 30 -40 minutes of continuous aerobic exercise at the start of the study, they 
will be given an individualized, progressive exercise program that breaks activity into smaller 10 
minute sessions and/or increases rest between sessions to achieve the 150 minutes/week  of 
moderate intensity activity.   
 
Both exercise groups will receive exercise counseling during their first meeting in addition to 
materials on the benefits of exercise, a log to record additional activity completed each week, 
goal setting, making time fo r exercise/making exercise a habit and exercise behavioral strategies.  
The UA group will receive an exercise log to record any weekly activity in addition to a weekly 
phone call/text/email to remind the individual to download information from the Polar Ig nite 
watch (Bethpage, NY) and a reminder to complete the weekly exercise log.  
 
Each woman enrolled in the study will be given a Polar Ignite watch to wear for the study 
duration.  This monitor will be programmed for moderate intensity HRR and will alarm i f HR 
falls above/below during exercise for both exercise groups.  In addition, the monitor will record 
all other activity within the HRR range and will be used to verify information obtained from 
activity and QOL questionnaires to reduce self -reported bias  in all groups.  For the control group, 
the watch will record activity by [CONTACT_278151] a weekly basis.  
 
Regardless of randomization, all women will report to the IHP between weeks 11 -13 (late 1st 
trimester) for baseline tes ting and to review past medical history, medications and exercise 
history.  Height will be measured to the nearest 0.[ADDRESS_339603] to determine HRR for the two exercise groups and  estimate VO 2max 
using the Pollock equation which will be repeated at 3 - and 6 -months after birth to compare 
aerobic fitness levels.46  
 
All women will complete the following questionnaires at baseline (late 1st trimester), 25 -26 
weeks (late 2nd trimester), and 37 -38 weeks (late 3rd trimester), and monthly through [ADDRESS_339604]-natal: MFI, SF -12 QOL; PSQLI; CES -D; EPDS; and the PPAQ.  All questionnaires have 
been demonstrated to have good validity, reliability, and internal consistency and the CES -D and 
EPDS are similar to each other in regards to internal consistency and test -retest reliability.47-[ADDRESS_339605] their gross and fine motor, and cognitive 
development measured monthly (months 1 -6) at home using  the Bayley Scales of Motor 
Development, 4th edition.[ADDRESS_339606] all of their supervised pregnancy exercise sessions, 
questionnaires, and weight measured at the IHP.  After delivery, women assigned to EX will 
resume their supervised IHP exe rcise program between 4 -8 weeks (depending on delivery mode) 
when they are cleared for activity by [CONTACT_9682], complete exercise testing at [ADDRESS_339607] monthly home visits for infant testing through 6 months. HOMEEX and 
UC women will  visit the IHP at baseline, 3 & [ADDRESS_339608] -delivery for exercise testing, 
questionnaires, and weight measurement.  HOMEX and UC groups will receive home visits for: 
2nd & 3rd trimester questionnaires and weight measurement and every month post -delivery for 
questionnaires, weight measurement and infant testing.  
 
Statistical analysis used to determine feasibility of the exercise intervention will include general 
descriptive statistics to assess recruitment, eligibility, retention, follow -up and exercise 
adherence.  In addition, we will conduct a survey and interview of subjects related to 
acceptability to participate in EX and HOMEEX and discuss barriers to regular exercise which 
will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and a phenomenological approach.    To determine 
the feasibility of maternal and infant outcomes, Kruskal -Wallis and Friedman’s ANOVA will be 
used to investigate between group and within group differences.  Relationships between 
variables will be analyzed using Spearman correlation coeffi cient.  Because this is a feasibility 
study, the results will be used as preliminary data to apply for future funding and also will 
provide variable quantitative and qualitative data for validating interventions that can increase 
adherence to exercise guid elines during pregnancy in women with different ethnic and 
socioeconomic backgrounds.

NOTE:  Breach of con fidentiality is always a risk for identifiable subject data.  
If a woman has been sedentary she may experience muscle soreness  from participation in the 
exercise program  that will dissipate aft er 4-7 days of regular exercise .  In addition, a previously 
sedentary woman may experience initial fatigue  (lasting 1 to 2 days)  which will also dissipate  
within 4 -6 weeks of consistent exercise.   Participation in this research has minimal risks to the 
mother and fetus and all participants will be instru cted as to what constitutes adverse responses 
and when to not engage in exercise.  For mothers in the structured exercise group (EX), 
transportation to the IHP may be inconvenient and/or difficult. Following delivery, it may be 
more difficult for mothers t o engage in the exercise program (HOMEX and EX) if they don’t 
have childcare.

abnormal blood pressure; faint ing; and disorders of heart rhythm that can be minimize d by 
[CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_278143] .  In 
addition, they will be told to maintain their exercise intensity at a moderate level ( conversational 
level ) throughout each and all exercise sessions.   
 
At the beginning and throughout the study, participants will be reminded  that their participation 
is voluntary and they can stop participating in the study  at any time.   
 
With the exception of the depression questionnaires, the information being asked of participants  
is not sensitive information —e.g. how is your s leep, activi ty, fatigue and QOL?   Participant 
information is confidential, not shared, securely kept, and coded by [CONTACT_6227] .  
 
While we will not be analyzing the data  (e.g. results of depression or other questionnaires)  
during the study to avoid compromising interaction s (e.g. bias)  with participants, s tudy personnel 
will be speaking to participants  in the HOMEEX and EX groups multiple times per week .  
Participants will be asked about  their next OB/GYN appointment and if anything about their 
health status has changed (th is helps to also insure that each participant is maintaining an active 
relationship with her OB provider).  The physician approval form  that provides a participant with 
clearance to participate in the study  will include a statement  that asks the physician to inform 
study personnel immediately if the participant develops any contraindication , relative or 
absolute,  to participation in an exercise program (e.g. fetal growth restriction or gestational 
hypertensive disorder).  Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)  will be handled per individual 
participant’s OB/GYN recommendations.  If a participant develops a n absolute  contraindication 
to participation in the study, they will be removed from the study.  If a participant experiences an 
adverse event, a new clearanc e must be provided by [CONTACT_142355]/GYN for the participant to return to the 
study.  In the case of an emergency, participants will be advised to seek care at Upstate

Only full term infants (birth at 37+ weeks gestation) will go on to participate in the neonatal 
portion of the study.  Infants participating in this portion of the study will undergo monthly

delayed motor development), participants will be advised to contact [CONTACT_187353].  
 
Participants will regularly be asked  how they are feeling.  I f a participant  expresses that she is 
feeling blue or is having  depressive thoughts, study personnel  will recommend that she contact 
[CONTACT_278153]. We will follow up each week to check the status of these symptoms and to 
make sure they have spoken with their health provider.   Participants i n the control group  are also 
being contact[CONTACT_278154], so relationships are being established , and the same process for

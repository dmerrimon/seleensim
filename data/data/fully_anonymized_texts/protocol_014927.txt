of [ADDRESS_920658] and using a medic ally acceptable method 
of contraception  (Note: females presenting with oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea who are aged ≤55 
years of age should be considered potentially fertile and therefore, as well as undergoing pregnancy 
testing like all other female subjec ts, will be expected to be using an acceptable method of 
contraception ).

that interferes with the metabolism of glucocorticoi ds. 
2. Clinical or biochemical evidence of hepatic or renal disease. Creatinine over twice the ULN or 
elevated liver function tests (ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_920660]).  
3. Subject s on regular daily inhaled , topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] , nasal  or oral steroids for any indication other than CAH.  
4. Subject s with any  other significant medical or psychiatric conditions that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_680275].  
5. History of malignancy (other than basal cell carcinoma successfully treated >6 months prior to en try

rsion: Final 7.0 – [ADDRESS_920663] 2017 completion of the 6 -month study period, all subjects may then enter a period of open -label treatment with 
Chronocort® as part of  an open -label extension  study  (to be co nducted  under a separate protocol) . 
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS : 
A sample size of 102 sub jects provides greater than 95% power and 2 -sided alpha 5% to demonstrate a fall in 
the logarithm of the mean daily unsigned standard deviation score of [ADDRESS_920664] 
glucocorticoid replacement therapy  group . It is assumed that (i) the me an fall in the Chronocort® group will be 
the same (0.78) as that observed in the phase II study (DIUR -003) (ii) the mean fall in the standard therapy 
group will be 0.2 (approximately 25% of the Chronocort® phase II study  fall) and (iii) the standard deviat ion 
of the fall (0.681) is that seen in the phase II study . The study is powered to ensure that there can be a reasonable 
description of the comparison of Chronocort® with a variety of standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 120 subjects will be 
randomised to this study which  will account for an inevaluability rate of 15%. Individual sites  should not recruit 
more than [ADDRESS_920665], DOSE AND 
MODE OF ADMINISTRATION : Chronocort® will be provided as 5mg, 10mg and 20mg capsules  for 
oral administration . The starting dose for each subject  will be based 
on the subject ’s previous glucocorticoid therapy dose  and then dose 
titrated to effect . The morning dose of  Chronocort® (approximately 
1/3rd of the total daily dose) should be taken at 07:[ADDRESS_920666] 1 hour before a meal and the evening dose 
(approximately 2/3rd of the total daily dose) should be taken at 23:[ADDRESS_920667] meal of the day.   
REFERENCE THERAPY, DOSE 
AND MODE OF 
ADMINISTR ATION:  Continuing previous oral glucocorticoid therapy titrated to effect .

(CTX)  and osteocalcin  (after fasting) . 
 To assess changes from baseline in glucose and insulin in the morning (after fasting)  
 To assess changes from baseline in  glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and PRA  in the morning . 
 To assess the impact of Chronocort® on quality of life (QoL) using SF -36®, Multidimensional 
Assessment of Fatigue (MAF), and EQ -5D™ . 
 To assess subject  compliance in subject s treated with Chronocort® over a 6 -month period.  
ENDPOINT S: 
Primary Endpoint:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline to [ADDRESS_920668] 
deviation score ( SDS) profile for [ADDRESS_920669]:  CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No.: DIUR-00 5 
Chronocort®        Diurnal Ltd 
 
Page 7 of 91 
Ve
rsion: Final 7.0 – [ADDRESS_920670] 2017 Secondary Endpoints : 
1. The change from baseline to 24 weeks of the mean of the 24 -hour SDS profile for A4 (calculated in the 
same way as the primary endpoint).  
2. The presentation of 17 -OHP and A4 by [CONTACT_680297] ( using 24 -hour SDS profile at 24 weeks) . 
3. 17-OHP and A4 level s at 09:00  as a responder analysis (i.e. the number of subjects achieving results in 
the optimal range) . 
4. Changes relative to standard glucocorticoid replacement ther apy in body composition (DEXA)  (fat mass, 
lean mass and total bone density) to be measured at all sites except [LOCATION_013].  
Exploratory Endpoints:  
1. Partial area under the curve (AUC)  of 17 -OHP at 15:00 -23:00, 23:00 -07:00, and 07:00 -15:00  (all refer to 
actual c lock time of sampling) . 
2. The primary endpoint measure will also be presented for the profiles measured at [ADDRESS_920671] treatment in the following:  
a. Bone markers – serum CTX  and osteocalcin  (after fasting)  
b. hsCRP  
c. Assessment of glucose and insulin in the morning (after fasting)  
d. Assessment of HbA1c, total testosterone, and PRA  in the morning  
e. QoL using SF -36®, MAF, and EQ -5D™  
4. Use of glucocorticoids at beginning and end of the study will be presented bot h as individual 
glucocorticoids used, and as calculated hydrocortisone equivalents using accepted conversion constants 
for the calculations.  
Safety Endpoints:  
1. Routine haematology, biochemistry, physical examination, vital signs, urinalysis, electrocardiog ram 
(ECG).  
2. Clinical adverse events ( AEs) – particular note of use of sick day rules and Addisonian crises . Under or 
over-replacement with glucocorticoids will be considered in the efficacy endpoints.  
3. Changes relative to the standard treatment in weight, bo dy mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and 
blood pressure (BP) . 
METHODOLOGY:  
As part of the baseline assessment , subject s will be admitted overnight  for a 24-hour endocrine profile whilst 
on their standard therapy . Subject s will attend the study site in the morning  and have a profile taken: 17 -OHP 
and A4 at 15:00, 17:00, 19:00, 21:00, 23:00, 01:00, 03:00, 05:00, 07:00, 09:00, 11:00, 13:00  and 15:00 . 
Baseline bloods will be taken on the second morning and will include: safety  measure ment s, all secondary 
endpoints to be measured – PRA , fasting osteocalcin and CTX, DEXA scan for body composition (except 
[LOCATION_013]) (DEXA scan may be performed at other times up to 2 weeks before baseline if scheduling proves 
difficult), insulin and glucose, HbA1c, QoL, height, weight  (BMI to be calculated)  and waist circumference . 
After these measure ment s have been tak en, the subject  will be randomis ed to Chronocort® or to continue on 
their standard care. Randomisation will be stratified by [CONTACT_680298]:  
1. hydrocortisone onl y or 
2. prednisone or prednisolone, alone or in combination with hydrocortisone   
3. dexamethasone only or in combination with any other gl ucorticoid  
The i nitial dose setting  at the start of the  Chronocort® treatment  will be based on hydrocortisone dose 
equivalen t of baseline therapy in accordance with standard clinical practice.  Further dose refinement/titration 
will be conducted in both treatment groups as necessary after [ADDRESS_920672]  has been re -admitted for further 24-hour profiles, to include 17 -OHP and 
A4. Safety endpoints and PRA  will also be measured at the 07:00  morning sample at each profile.  
At 6 months, all the baseline tests wil l be repeated (including the 24 -hour profile) . All subject s may then 
continue on Chronocort®, whatever their randomi sed treatment , as part of an open -label extension study  (to 
be conducted under  a separate protocol).  
Blinding:  The decision to change doses in both treatment groups will be made by a n independent bl inded 
physician  but the actual change in dose will be made by [CONTACT_680299] . The 
intention of dose a djustment is to optimis e control of CAH according to current standard of care based on 
subject  symptoms and the measurem ent of androgens , as is currently recommended to clinical practice .  
Stress doses of hydrocortisone will be given for intercurrent illnesses as medically indicated according to 
“sick day rules” . Fludrocortisone dose adjustment will be allowed if medically indicated and will be based on

rsion: Final 7.0 – [ADDRESS_920673] 2017 BP measurements and laboratory data (goal supi[INVESTIGATOR_680276] < 1.[ADDRESS_920674] ). 
o Dose changes  in both treatment groups will be under the direction of an independent blinded 
physician and will be made following an inpatient assessment of symptoms and androgen levels.  
o Dose adjustment will be based on clinical symptoms using the “signs and symptoms of adrenal 
insufficiency questionnaire” and the measurement of the 17 -OHP and A4 profile s. 
o The 5 samples taken between  01:00 and 09:[ADDRESS_920675] or Chronocort® therapy  and the 5 samples taken between 
11:00 and 19:[ADDRESS_920676] or Chronocort® therapy. 
Dose adjus tments will be considered if [ADDRESS_920677] therapy (within the limits set by [CONTACT_479026] ) but the timing and the 
drugs used  must not be changed . Dose adjustment  will use the lowest dose adjustment available with the 
specific therapy , so genera lly for hydrocortisone this will be 5mg, for p rednisolone 1mg and dexamethasone 
0.25mg.  
Where 17-OHP and A4 show inconsistent trends the A4 parameter will take precedence in directing dose 
adjustment . 
If required, d ose a djustments will be made within 2  weeks of the week 4 and week 12 visits  when 
biochemical results are reviewed.  
 All s ubject s (whether or not there has been a titration) will receive a telephone call one week after 
any dose adjustments to enquire as to whether there have been any AEs, and reinforce any other 
protocol requirements . 
 No dos e adjustments outside of the protocol -defined dose adjustments should be conducted, unless 
clinical signs and symptoms indicate an immediate need. In such cases the Sponsor’s medical 
monitor must be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (preferably before any dose changes are impleme nted). Any such 
unscheduled dose adjustments should be based on clinical symptoms only, with repeated androgen 
testing discouraged and must be pre -approved by [CONTACT_1034]’s medical monitor .The rationale for 
any dose adjustment, by [CONTACT_680300], will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
 In subject s who have undetectable androgens at baseline on their regular medication , caution will be 
taken over dose reduction so as to avoid the risk of suppressed pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal axis occurring in 
these subject s. 
STATISTICAL METHODS:    
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) must be finalised before any subject is randomised into the trial.   
Efficacy:  The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline to 24 weeks in the primary efficacy 
variable (natural logarithm of the mean over the 24 -hour SDS profile for 17 -OHP). The primary efficacy 
endpoint will be compared between treatment groups within a Normal linear analysis of cov ariance 
(ANCOVA) model with baseline treatment category and baseline SDS as covariates. Exploratory analyses will 
investigate the sensitivity of the results to the transformation of the endpoint and to the form of the model. 
Secondary endpoints will also b e analysed as a change from pre -randomisation baseline to end -of-study. To 
ensure that the treatment effect of Chronocort® is not all as a result of non -hydrocortisone based regimes being 
different in achieving control, the effect of Chronocort® within bas eline treatment subgroups will be presented.   
Safety:  Summary vital signs change from baseline data will be presented in tabular form, by [CONTACT_680301], with N, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, quartiles, minimum and maximum as appropriate.  
Summary ECG (heart rate, PR interval, QRS width, QT interval and QTC interval) change from baseline data 
will be presented in tabular form, by [CONTACT_680302], with N, n, mean, SD, median, minimum and 
maximum as appropriate.  
AEs will be coded usin g the latest version of the MedDRA drug dictionary. Data will be summarised using 
preferred term and primary system organ class. Only treatment -emergent AEs, being events with an onset at 
or after the first administration of study drug, will be presented i n summary tables. Where changes in severity 
are recorded in the eCRF, the most severe incidence of the AE will be reported in the tables. Rates will be 
calculated as the proportion of subjects with at least one AE related to the number of subjects treated in each 
treatment group. Frequency tables will be provided concerning severity and drug relationship.

Introduction 
 
Overview 
 
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), generally due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, is a disease 
of the adrenal cortex characterised by [CONTACT_680303], and androgen excess. The severe or classic form occurs in 1 in 15,000 births 
worldwide (Merke 2005; Pang 1993; Therrell 2001), while the mild non-classic form is a 
common cause of hyperandrogenism (New 2006) . The discovery of glucocorticoid therapy as 
a treatment for CAH occurred in the 1950s resulting in subjects with classic CAH surviving . 
However, existing glucocorticoid treatment remains suboptimal and many unresolved clinical 
problems exist (Han et al. 2014).  
 
The
re is currently no standard treatment for this condition, and the glucocorticoid therapi[INVESTIGATOR_680278]. Also 
adults may experience iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome, hyperandrogenism, infertility or the 
development of the metabolic syndrome (Arlt 2010). Chronocort®, a newly-developed 
modified release oral formulation of hydrocortisone, is designed to mimic the normal serum 
levels of the endogenous cortisol circadian rhythm, offering the prospect of an improved 
treatment outcome. The proposed study will evaluate whether a twice a day dosing regimen of 
Chronocort® given at night and in the morning (which can more closely normalise cortisol 
levels) will improve control of adrenal androgen production (as measured by 
17-hydroxyprogesterone [17-OHP] and androstenedione [A4] ). 
 
Overview
 of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia  
 
The adrenal cortex secretes the stress hormone cortisol, a glucocorticoid steroid that regulates 
energy balance and many intracellular processes. Cortisol synthesis is stimulated by 
[CONTACT_680304] (ACTH), which increases the synthesis of the cytochrome P 
(CYP) enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of cortisol. ACTH secretion by [CONTACT_32360][INVESTIGATOR_2117], 
in turn, is increased by [CONTACT_680305]-releasing hormone (CRH), 
which is partly regulated by [CONTACT_60653] ‘zeitgeber’, or clock. Both ACTH and CRH secretion 
are inhibited by [CONTACT_680306]. The adrenal cortex also secretes aldosterone, a 
mineralocorticoid steroid hormone that regulates sodium, potassium and water balance. 
 
The pathophysiology of 21-hydroxylase deficiency-related adrenal hyperplasia is closely 
linked to the degree of enzyme deficiency. In the most severe form, concomitant aldosterone 
deficiency leads to salt loss and dehydration. In CAH, the defect in cortisol biosynthesis leads 
to a compensatory increase in ACTH and hypothalamic CRH due to a lack of the usual negative 
feedback by [CONTACT_44096]. Conventional glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement doses 
fail to replicate the close temporal relationship between CRH, ACTH and subsequent cortisol 
pulses (Krieger 1971; Ross 2005). Supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoid are often 
necessary to adequately suppress excess adrenal androgen and oestrogen production (Cutler 
1990; Merke 2001). Thus subjects with treated CAH are often poorly controlled on current 
standard therapy.  
 
Conventional medical treatment of CAH is often a difficult balancing act between the 
undesirable states of hypercortisolism and hyperandrogenism (Han 2014). Subjects with CAH 
are
 at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a number of clinical manifestations, such as obesity in children 
(Cornean 1998), insulin resistance (Azziz 1994; Moran 2000; New 1993; Speiser 1985), and

ycystic ovaries, which may contribute to infertility in women with CAH . Oligomenorrhoea 
or amenorrhoea may be present in adolescence (Barnes 1994; Deneux 2001). The development 
of ectopic adrenal tissue or adrenal rest tissue is also associated with CAH. 
 
Overview of Chronocort® 
 
The active ingredient of Chronocort® is hydrocortisone. The safety profile of hydrocortisone is 
well characterised in humans and there is extensive clinical experience with the use of 
hydrocortisone in subjects with CAH. The excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (inactive ingredients) used in the 
Chronocort® formulation under investigation are also well-characterised and are approved for 
use in humans at the proposed levels. The Chronocort® formulation has been manufactured and 
is supplied in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The risks of 
Chronocort® are, therefore, expected to be no greater than the risks of an equivalent dose of 
cortisol. 
 
Chronocort® is a patented oral modified release formulation of hydrocortisone which is 
intended to mimic, or closely match, the serum levels of endogenous cortisol, thereby 
[CONTACT_680307]. The rationale for Chronocort® is based on the 
belief that the delivery of a physiological cortisol profile will offer significant clinical benefits 
over current treatment. Formulations of immediate release (IR) hydrocortisone and other 
glucocorticoids used in the treatment of CAH are recognised to be unsatisfactory due to issues 
with: 
 
 subopt imal disease control  
 risk of  glucocorticoid over-treatment 
 inconve nient dosing regimens 
 c omplex and inconsistent protocols for monitoring therapy 
 poor subject compliance 
 
Mimicry of the physiological cortisol profile is achieved by a delayed release and sustained 
absorption profile, such that when the dosage form is administered at night time (approximately 
23:00 hours) there is a period of absence of drug release followed by a period of sustained 
absorption, to yield an elevation in serum cortisol concentration according to the normal 
circadian profile, with peak concentration occurring in the morning (approximately 06:00-
08:00 hours) (Whitaker 2014; Mallappa 2015). 
 
Rat
ionale for the use of Chronocort® in the treatment of CAH 
 
Subjects with classic CAH receive replacement glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid. Many 
diff
erent regimens of glucocorticoid are advocated. Hormone levels are monitored prior to 
morning dose of medication, aiming for mildly elevated morning 17- OHP  levels and normal 
renin levels (Joint LWPES/ESPE CAH Working Group 2002; Merke 2005; Speiser 2003) . 
Physical features and clinical symptoms are monitored for evidence of excessive (e.g. obesity, 
striae, and decreased linear growth in children) or insufficient (e.g. hirsutism, amenorrhoea or 
viriliation in women, fatigue, and increased linear growth, early puberty, advanced bone 
maturation in children) treatment. It is often quite difficult to reduce excess androgen without 
giving excess glucocorticoid because current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_680279].

hronocort® is a newly-developed formulation of hydrocortisone that allows for slow 
absorption after oral administration when given at 23:00 hours (20mg) and 07:00 hours (10mg), 
so that cortisol levels peak in the early morning (Whitaker 2014) . The compound has the unique 
potential to provide the best possible physiologic replacement of cortisol and promises to 
ameliorate many of the unresolved medical issues surrounding the management of subject s 
with CAH (Mallappa 2015).  
 
Over
view of Chronocort® clinical studies  
 
One
 Phase I study has been completed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Chronocort® 
(study DIUR-002) (Whitaker 2014). Study DIUR-002 fully characterised the PK performance 
a
nd dose proportionality of Chronocort®. The target PK criteria, commensurate with the 
endogenous circadian profile for cortisol, were as follows: mean C max >300nmol/L 
(>10.8 mcg/dL) for the 20mg dose, T max a pproximately 6-[ADDRESS_920691]-dosing to prime waking, 
mean cortisol level >100nmol/L (>3.6mcg/dL) up to 16:00 hours, mean cortisol level 
<100nmol/L (>3.6mcg/dL) after 22:00 hours, and relative bioavailability >80%. In study 
DIUR-002, all assessment criteria were met.  
 
Study DIUR-003 (Phase II pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]) was conducted in 16 subjects at a single site, the 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, [LOCATION_003] (Mallappa 
2015). DIUR-003 evaluated the PK profile of cortisol following short-term twice-daily 
administration of Chronocort® (20mg at night and 10mg in morning) in subjects with CAH and 
this was compared with data from healthy volunteers in the Phase I study. It also examined the 
effects of both short-term and long-term treatment with Chronocort® on key disease-related 
biochemical markers and other indices of efficacy/ PK. The study evaluated 16 subj ects with 
CAH over a 6-month period. A ll subjects started the study on 30mg daily (given as 10mg at 
07:00 and 20mg at 23:00), with dose titration then taking place within 2 weeks, following 
investi
gator review of biochemical and clinical parameters.  
  
The
 PK profile of Chronocort® after 20mg at 23:00 and 10mg at 07:00 in subjects with CAH 
was similar to that seen in the Phase I clinical study (DIUR-002). The PK profile was 
characterised by [CONTACT_680308] a maximal concentration 
approximately [ADDRESS_920692]-dosing, consistent with the physiological endogenous profile of 
cortisol reported in normal individuals. The variation in C max and area under the curve ( AUC ) 
was similar to that seen in physiological cortisol levels in healthy volunteers.  
 
This 
physiological replacement of cortisol with Chronocort® improved the control of disease-
related biomarker androgens in subjects (control compared to baseline standard therapy). This 
was achieved with a similar dose of glucocorticoid; the mean hydrocortisone dose equivalent 
on standard therapy was 28mg and on Chronocort® was 26mg. On standard therapy at baseline, 
the majority of subjects had uncontrolled androgen levels, with most having high levels of 
17-OHP and A4. Following 6-months titration with Chronocort®, the majority of subjects had 
17-OHP and A4 levels in the normal or optimal range (see Figure 1).

anaemia cases were all consistent with acute low level red cell reduction attributable to blood 
loss secondary to the blood draws related to the study. The aetiology of the carpal tunnel

All events were mild and their relationship to the investigational medicinal product (IMP) was

roposed study   
The proposed study aims to build on the results of study DIUR-003 and further evaluate 
whether Chronocort® can provide improved control of serum androgen levels (using 17- OHP  
and A4  as markers) compared to current glucocorticoid treatment regimens. 
 
Benefit/Risk Assessment 
The subjects in this study have classic CAH. As such, they have an absolute requirement for 
lifelong glucocorticoid replacement therapy. It is proposed that the formulation of 
hydrocortisone being evaluated in this study, Chronocort®, has characteristics that may 
improve the outcome in patients with CAH. 
 
The currently used glucocorticoid replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_680281]. Chronocort® is a novel modified-release formulation of 
hydrocortisone that has been shown to closely mimic the physiological circadian profile of 
cortisol. It is hypothesised that this will provide improved CAH disease control. Results of 
clinical trials using Chronocort® have demonstrated that cortisol levels on Chronocort® 
approximated physiologic cortisol rhythm over 24 hours, and  improved control of  androgens 
in su
bjects with CAH when compared to baseline conventional glucocorticoid therapy.  
 
The risks associated with this study include those associated with blood sampling and general 
involvement with clinical trials. The investigators in this trial are all highly experienced both 
in clinical trials and in the management of patients with CAH, and these risks are then 
negligable. In addition, to minimise the risk of anaemia associated with the withdrawal of 
multiple blood samples for laboratory testing (as seen in a previous study), the planned total 
blood volume to be withdrawn during this study has been limited to a maximum of 427mL . 
The other risks then relate to the potential under- or over-treatment of subjects with 
glucocorticoids as seen in day- to-day clinical practice. These risks apply to both conventional 
treatment and Chronocort®. The patients will be informed of the potential for under-treatment 
(a
s occurs when there is an intercurrent illness) and are taught to manage this with supplemental 
steroids (emergency pack for sick day rules) and to seek medical assistance. It is also possible 
that the new formulation of Chronocort® might fail to release properly in the gut with resultant 
low levels of cortisol. If this were to occur once, the associated risk would be low, as a 
subsequent dose would be given either [ADDRESS_920698] (DSMB). The DSMB 
will meet on a regular basis during the study to review the safety data and will operate in 
a
ccordance with a predefined charter. 
 
Over-treatment with hydrocortisone is unfortunately common in this condition as physicians 
try to control the cortisol levels.  Regular assessment of the subjects (both biochemically and 
clinically) in the study will identify over-treatment and correct it through a reduction in dose.  
 
Thus the potential risks of the study are minimised and mitigated through investigator 
oversight, use of sick day rules by [CONTACT_680309], and specific study 
activities (titration of dose, and identification of AEs). All subjects will be given the relevant 
information about the the risks and potential benefits of the study and all subjects have to sign

 consent form prior to inclusion in the study that meets all the requirements of GCP and 
national regulations.  
 
The risks of Chronocort® are expected to be no greater than the risks of an equivalent dose of 
hydrocortisone and similar to the risks associated with current glucocorticoid therapy the 
subject is receiving at entry into this study. However, the delivery of hydrocortisone with 
C
hronocort® has been demonstrated to produce a cortisol profile more similar to the 
endogenous cortisol profile than current immediate-release hydrocortisone formulations and 
thi
s is expected to result in improved disease control in patients with CAH. For subjects in the 
study
, the potential benefits exceed the potential risks.

A 
previous phase II study (a two-part, single cohort, open label multiple dose protocol 
[DIUR-003]) demonstrated that Chronocort®, whe n given in a twice a day regimen in subjects 
with CAH, enables physiological replacement of cortisol,  which results in improved control of 
androgens without increasing glucocorticoid exposure (Mallappa 2015). Chronocort®, in 
contrast to hydrocortisone IR, achieved a physiological profile. Dosing times for study

it is recommended that the morning dose of Chronocort® is taken on an empty stomach at least

as an open study rather than a blinded study. The randomisation either to Chronocort® or to 
continue on their original therapy will be stratified with regard to the subject’s prior treatment. 
The number of subjects in the study will be closely monitored via the interactive web response 
system (IWRS) system until a total of 120 subjects are randomised in the study. This number 
of 
subjects provides greater than 95% power, with a 2-sided alpha of 5% to demonstrate a fall 
in the mean daily unsigned standard deviation SDS of 17-OHP, which is 20% less than that 
seen in the phase II study.

aseline Assessment and Randomisation (2 - day visit) 
Subjects will be called in for the Baseline Visit (Visit 1) and admitted overnight for a 24-hour 
e
ndocrine profile whilst remaining on their standard therapy. Subjects will have 17-OHP and 
A4 measured at 13 t ime points. On the second morning baseline bloods will be taken together 
with
 all safety measures and all secondary endpoint measurements (see Section 11).  
 
Af
ter the completion of the baseline profile, the subject will be randomised either to receive 
C
hronocort® or to continue on standard care. 120 subjects will be randomised (see Section 11). 
 
The
 initial dose setting at the start of Chronocort® treatment will be made on hydrocortisone 
dose equivalent of baseline therapy, with the hydrocortisone dose calculated as prednisone dose 
multiplied by 5 and dexamethasone dose multiplied by 80 (up to a maximum starting dose of 
Chronocort® 30mg, split as 20mg at night and 10mg in the morning)  Chronocort® will be given 
at 23:00 hours (approximately 2/3rd of the total daily dose) and 07:00 hours (approximately 
1/3rd of the total daily dose). The first dose of Chronocort® will be taken at 23:[ADDRESS_920711] dose of study medication (Chronocort® or standard therapy). 
 
Dose Adjustment 
 
Dose adjustment in both treatment groups will be made, if necessary, within 2 weeks of Visits 
2 
(4 weeks) and 4 (12 weeks). The decision to change dose will be made by [CONTACT_680316]. The 
independent blinded physician will determine either that no change is required or that an 
increase/decrease in the morning/midday/evening medication is needed. In the event that a 
change in the midday dose is advised for a subject who is receiving Chronocort or in a subject 
who is receiving twice daily dosing of standard therapy, the local investigator must decide to 
make this dose change at the most appropriate timepoint in their judgement (morning or 
evening),  in addition to any changes already advised for morning and evening doses, so that 
the total change advised is accommodated within the day. For each subject, the independent 
blinded physician will record whether or not a treatment change is required in the electronic 
case report form (e CRF ). The local investigator will be informed so they can make the change 
to the prescription and the local investigator will document whether or not a change is required 
in the subject notes, using the eCRF as the source document for this information. All subjects 
will receive a telephone call to inform them whether or not their dose will change.  The local 
investigator will ensure the subject receives clear instructions in writing (emails are acceptable) 
following the telephone call. All subjects will receive a further telephone call one week after 
the first call (whether or not dose adjustment has been recommended) to assess any AEs and 
reinforce any other protocol requirements. 
 
No dose adjustments outside of the protocol-defined dose adjustments should be conducted, 
unless clinical signs and symptoms indicate an immediate need. In such cases the Sponsor’s 
medical monitor must be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (preferably before any dose changes are implemented). Any 
such unscheduled dose adjustments should be based on clinical symptoms only, with repeated 
androgen testing discouraged and must be pre-approved by [CONTACT_1034]’s medical monitor. 
Rationale for any dose adjustment, by [CONTACT_680317], will be recorded in the e CRF . With intercurrent illness, 
sick day rules apply (see Appendix 4 for an example). In subjects w ith undetectable androgen

occurred since the last visit – it should not be used to record AEs due to other causes. 
 
o The  independent blinded physician will review the signs and symptoms of adrenal

Chronocort® therapy. Dose adjustments will be considered if [ADDRESS_920715] therapy (within the limits set by [CONTACT_680319]) but the timing and the drugs used must not be changed. Dose adjustment will use 
the lowest dose adjustment available with the specific therapy, so generally for hydrocortisone 
this will be 5mg, for prednisolone 1mg and dexamethasone 0.25mg. 
 
Where 17-OHP and A4 show inconsistent trends, the A4 parameter will take precedence in 
directing dose adjustment. 
 
The
 dose adjustment is to optimise control of CAH according to current standard of care based 
on subject symptoms and the measurement of androgens as is currently recommended for 
clinical practice. No other glucocorticoid dose adjustments will be allowed apart from sick day 
rules. Fludrocortisone dose adjustment will be allowed if medically indicated and will be based 
on BP 
measurements and laboratory data (goal supi[INVESTIGATOR_680276] <1.5

Study Medication and Administration 
10.1 Randomisation and Blinding 
The
re will be a fully stratified randomisation of subjects using an IWRS system. Stratification 
will
 be based on subjects’ current treatment at the time of entering the study. This is an 
open-label study so there will be no blinding or unblinding procedures. Subjects will be 
a
llocated an identifying number sequentially per site in the following format: Study No./Site 
No./Screening No. (for example D005/1/001, D 005/ 1/002 etc. for site 1 ; D005/2/001 etc. for 
sit
e 2). When the subject is randomised, a separate randomisation number will be allocated, 
whic
h will be used internally for the purposes of treatment allocation and stratum identification . 
The screening number will still be used for subject identification purposes, so there will be 
gaps in subject ID numbers for screen failures. 
10.2 Description and Handling of IMPs 
The
 Investigational Medicinal Products (IMP) for this study are: 
  Chronocort® (Hydrocortisone Modified Release Capsule). In this study Chronocort® will 
be supplied in three unit dose strengths of 5mg, 10mg and 20mg per capsule.  
 the standard glucocorticoid replacement therapy that the subject is receiving will be used 
for subjects randomised to the comparator arm  
 
Diurna
l Ltd will supply the study sites with adequate bulk study medication of Chronocort® 
for the entire study period. Diurnal will also supply the standard glucocorticoid replacement 
therapy used at each site to ensure that subjects remain on the same products throughout the 
study.  
10.2.1 Chronocort® Formulation  
C
hronocort® is a modified-release formulation of hydrocortisone for oral administration. 
Chronocort® is available in dose strengths of 5, 10 and 20mg hydrocortisone. The 5mg 
formulation will be presented in white opaque body/blue opaque cap size [ADDRESS_920724] gelatin 
capsules, printed with ‘CHRONOCORT 5mg’ on the capsule body. The 10mg formulation will 
be presented in white opaque body/green opaque cap size [ADDRESS_920725] gelatin capsules, printed with 
‘CHRONOCORT 10mg’ on the capsule body. The 20mg formulation will be presented in 
white opaque body/orange opaque cap size [ADDRESS_920726] gelatin capsules, printed with 
‘CHRONOCORT 20mg’ on the capsule body. 
 
All excipi[INVESTIGATOR_680283]® modified release capsules are standard materials normally 
used in pharmaceutical drug products, are the subject of [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia/National 
Formulary (NF) and/or European Pharmacopeia Monographs, and have been used in 
pharmaceutical products worldwide over many years. 
10.2.2 Packaging and Labelling 
Chronocort® capsules are contained within either a PVC/PE/PVdC blister pack sealed with 
aluminium lidding foil or a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle sealed with a 
polypropylene (PP) lid. Each blister pack contains 10 capsules of the same dose strength. Each 
bottle pack contains 100 capsules of the same dose strength. The sponsor will supply 
Chronocort® to the pharmacy at the study site as clinical packs containing 100 capsules of each 
dose strength, i.e. 10 x 10-count blisters (100-count pack) or [ADDRESS_920727] randomised to Chronocort® will be assembled by [CONTACT_680320]. Each dose

Chronocort® Treatment pack [ADDRESS_920729] carton containing one 
clinical pack of each dose strength (5, 10 and 20mg Chronocort®), with each pack containing 
100 Chronoc ort® capsules. The initial Chronocort® dose regimen will be determined according 
to the individual subject prescription, based on the hydrocortisone dose equivalent of the 
subject’s previous therapy, with the hydrocortisone dose calculated as prednisone dose 
multiplied by 5 and dexamethasone dose multiplied by 80 (up to a maximum starting dose of 
Chronocort® 30mg, split as 20mg at night and 10mg in the morning).   
 
Tr
eatment pack 2 (dispensed at Visit 2 after 4 weeks) and Treatment pack 3 (dispensed at Visit 
3 after 12 weeks) will be dispensed by [CONTACT_680321]. Treatment packs 2 and 3 will 
be
 assembled based on individual prescribed dosing regimen, including any dose adjustment 
required. 
 
Chronocort® will be labelled as shown in Appendix 9. The subject number will be written on 
the study pack by [CONTACT_32335]. 
 
Diurn
al will also provide appropriate labels for the standard glucocorticoid replacement 
ther
apy that the pharmacy can use to label the drugs dispensed to subjects (See Appendix 9). 
The
 subject number will be written on the study pack by [CONTACT_32335]. The batch numbers of 
the standard glucocorticoid replacement therapy must be recorded by [CONTACT_32335]. 
10.2.3 
Storage 
Chronocort® will be securely stored in the study site pharmacy at a temperature not exceeding 
25°C
. Subjects dispensed with treatment packs will be advised to store Chronocort® securely 
in a cool (room temperature) and dry place out of the reach of children. The comparator of 
standard glucocorticoid replacement treatment will be stored in line with the manufacturer’ s 
labelling. 
10.2.4 Accountability 
Subjects randomised to Chronocort® will return treatment pack [ADDRESS_920730] 
to 
the returns pharmacy at the site. All used and unused Chronocort® will be stored at the 
returns pharmacy and made available for review by [CONTACT_12935] (CRA) as 
outlined 
in Section 14.8. Following the sponsor’s approval, all remaining Chronocort® will 
either be returned to the supplier or destroyed on site within [ADDRESS_920731] until the next visit will be 
dispensed. 
Dispensing of the comparator treatment will be in accordance with the site’s usual procedure, 
but used and unused medication must be returned to the study site at each visit and

ccountability conducted along similar lines to that detailed above for Chronocort®. 
Accountability must also be performed at each visit for the safety pack, which  should be used 
in conjunction with the sites “sick day rules”. Any use of the medications in the safety pack 
should be recorded in the eCRF, along with the reason for use.  
10.3 Dosage and Administration  
S
ubjects will be randomised on Day 2 of the baseline visit, following the 24-hour endocrine 
profil
e and baseline blood tests. Further 24-hour endocrine profiles will be carried out at weeks 
4 
and 12, and any dose titrations required will be assessed centrally by [CONTACT_680322].  
 
The morning dose of Chronocort® should be taken on an empty stomach at least [ADDRESS_920733] meal of the day. 
Subjects will be asked to self-administer the dose of Chronocort® provided at 23:00 hours 
(approximately 2/3rd of the total daily dose) and 07:00 hours (approximately 1/3rd of the total 
daily dose) with a small drink of water. 
 
The
 comparator of standard glucocorticoid replacement treatment will be dosed in line with the 
site’s usual practice. 
10.[ADDRESS_920734] symptoms and the measurement of androgen levels. Stress doses of 
hydrocortisone will be given for intercurrent illnesses as medically indicated according to “sick 
day rules” (Appendix 4 for an example). Other dose adjustments will not be allowed, unless 
the local investigator judges that there is a medical reason to alter the dose, and if so this will 
be recorded in the subject notes and the e CRF  (see also last bullet point below).  
 Dose  adjustment will be based on clinical symptoms using the “signs and symptoms of 
adrenal insufficiency questionnaire” (Appendix 5) and the measurement of the 17-OHP, 
a
nd A4 profile. The adrenal insufficiency questionnaire should only be used to 
determine if symptoms of under or over replacement of glucocorticoids have occurred 
since the last visit – it should not be used to record AEs due to other causes. 
 Dose  adjustments in both treatment groups will be made by [CONTACT_680322], according to the instructions provided in Section 8 under the heading “Dose 
Adjustment” 
 Dose  adjustment will be made within 2 weeks of visits when biochemical results are 
re
viewed. Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_680323] – either to tell them of the new dose, or of no change in dose . 
This 
will be followed in writing (whether there is a change in dose or not) repeating the 
instruction of the phone call. If it is practical to see the subject again in the clinic to tell 
them of
 the dose adjustment, this is also acceptable.  
 All subjects (whether or not there has been a titration) will receive a telephone call one 
week after any dose-adjustment, to enquire as to whether there have been any AEs, and 
reinforce any other protocol requirements. 
 The  rationale for a ny dose adjustment, by [CONTACT_680324], will be recorded in the subject’s notes 
and in the eCRF. 
 No dose adjustments outside of the protocol-defined dose adjustments should be 
conducted, unless clinical signs and symptoms indicate an immediate need. In such 
c
ases the Sponsor’s medical monitor must be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (preferably before any dose

hanges are implemented). Any such unscheduled dose adjustments should be based on 
clinical symptoms only, with repeated androgen testing discouraged and must be pre-
approved by [CONTACT_1034]’s medical monitor. 
 
Fludrocortisone dose adjustment will be allowed if medically indicated and will be based on 
BP measurements and laboratory data (goal supi[INVESTIGATOR_386029] A above the lower limit and <1.[ADDRESS_920736]).

 A one-week supply of 20 mg oral hydrocortisone (in 10mg tablets to allow dosage of 
up to 20mg three times daily)  
 2 vials of hydrocortisone for injection plus syringes and needles 
 The  site’s standard information guidance regarding “sick day rules” (routinely given to 
any subject receiving hydrocortisone replacement therapy)  
 
Diurn
al will also provide appropriate labels for the safety pack that the pharmacy can use to 
label the drugs dispensed to subjects (See Appendix 9). The subject number will be written on 
the safety pack by [CONTACT_32335].  
 
Subjects will continue to take Chronocort® twice daily or standard glucocorticoid replacement 
therapy at the usual dosing regimen when taking stress doses. Any additional doses of 
hydrocortisone needed should only be taken from the safety pack and should not be taken from 
the study medication pack. 
10.6 Permitted Concomitant Medications/Treatments 
The
 subjects must be instructed that no additional medication will be allowed without the prio r 
consent of the investigator. Any medication considered necessary for the subject’s safety and 
well-being may be given at the discretion of the investigator(s). Medication for sick days does 
not require authorisation. All concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded in the 
subject’s e CRF . 
 
Existing or previous treatments for CAH (last 6 months) will be recorded separately in the 
eCRF from routine medication as part of the subject’s medical history. 
[ADDRESS_920737] be taken prior to any study related procedures. Subjects will continue on their 
regular medication for CAH until they are randomised at Visit 1.2 (Day 2 of the baseline visit) .  
11.1 Visit Schedule  
At 
any visit, if multiple assessments are being conducted, then the measurements should be 
made in the following order: demographic data and medical history, AEs, signs and symptoms 
of adrenal insufficiency, waist circumference and weight, physical examination, vital signs, 
ECG, urinalysis, blood tests, and then dosing.

 P hysical examination  
A full physical examination to assess the subject’s general appearance and overall 
health will be carried out at screening and at the last visit in the study. Significant 
findings that are present prior to the start of study drug must be included in the relevant 
medical history/current medical status section of the eCRF and significant findings 
made after the start of study drug which meet the definition of an AE must be recorded 
in the eCRF. At the other visits, an abbreviated physical examination will be conducted 
if indicated by [CONTACT_2695], noting any changes from the screening assessment. Any abnormal 
findings will be recorded on the eCRF.  
11.3 Sick Day Rules  
All 
subjects will be educated regarding “sick day rules”. “Sick day rules,” a written guideline 
regarding what to do during any illness, will be given to the subject s (as is done for all CAH 
subjects). Wher e sites have a standa rd set of ‘sick day rules” these will be supplied to subject s 
a
t that site routinely along with an emergency pack of medication (see Appendix 4 for an 
e
xample of sick day rules that can be used for this study if a site choses to do so). Use of sick 
day rules will be recorded in e CRF , including both duration, dose of steroid and use of 
injection. Sick day rules from each site will be collected prior to the beginning of recruitment 
and placed on file by [CONTACT_1034].

1. I nability to tolerate Chronocort® secondary to perceived or observed side effects 
2. P regnancy (not due to safety reasons but because pregnancy may interfere with the 
primary endpoint) 
3. Any  other changes to clinical signs or changes in laboratory values, physical status or

T
he sponsor reserves the right to request the withdrawal of a subject due to protocol violation, 
a
dministrative or other reasons, or in the event of emergence of adverse risk data on the product. 
 
If a subject withdraws from the study prior to study completion, the reason for withdrawal 
should be sought and recorded on the e CRF . AEs should be followed up until resolution.  
 
If a subject withdraws from the study they will not be eligible to participate in the extension 
study. 
11.6 Replacement of Withdrawn S ubjec ts 
120 subjects will be randomised to account for withdrawals anticipated during the course of 
the stud
y and to provide 102 evaluable subjects. 
11.7 Additional Information for the Study Population 
F
emales presenting with oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea who are aged ≤55 years of age 
shoul
d be considered potentially fertile and therefore, as well as undergoing pregnancy testing 
like all other female subjects, will be expected to be using an acceptable method of 
contraception as noted below. 
 
Acceptable forms of contraception include: 
1. 
Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception (including 
oestrogen-containing products) – note that use of these methods of contraception must 
remain 
the same throughout the study in both nature and dose. The type of contraception 
should have been ongoing for ≥[ADDRESS_920782] 7 days after the final 
dose. If <90 days prior to the study, additional use of a double barrier method until 90 days 
is reached is required.  
2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).  
3. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault 
c
aps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. The following should be noted:  
 Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom ar e not 
highly effective forms of contraception. Therefore the use of additional 
spermicides does confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection.  
 How ever, spermicides alone are inefficient at preventing pregnancy when the 
whole ejaculate is spi[INVESTIGATOR_54073]. Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of 
contraception and should not be used alone.

 4. 
Male sterilisation (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of 
sperm in the ejaculate). [For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male partner 
should be the sole partner for that subject].  
5. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
Periodic abstinence, such as calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post ovulation methods, 
and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception

12 Adverse Events and Toxicity Management 
 
12.1 A dverse Event Definition 
An AE is defined as (21CFR312.32):  “Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.”  An AE can therefore be any 
unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or 
not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. This includes any newly occurring event 
or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of 
study drug.  
12.2 Adverse Event Collection  
AE
s will be collected for all subjects from the time of consent up to phone call T4 (30 days ± 
3 days) following the last visit or, if applicable, the Early Withdrawal visit. Any ongoing AEs 
post study will be followed to resolution or stabilisation if resolution is not expected. Only 
treatment emergent AEs will be included in the main safety analysis: other AEs will be listed. 
 
De
tails of any AEs, signs, and symptoms will be collected, including details of onset, 
resolution, frequency, severity, seriousness, relationship to the drug, effect on the study drug, 
treatments administered, and outcome. All AEs will be followed, whenever possible, until it 
returns to the baseline condition or becomes stable with no further change expected. In the 
event of any abnormalities considered to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_408482], 
subjects will be followed up with appropriate medical management until values are considered 
to be clinically acceptable. Referral or collaborative care will be organised if required.

Ve
rsion: Final 7.0 – [ADDRESS_920785] 
be reported equally for both study treatments, regardless of whether the investigator thinks the 
AEs are related to the study treatment. 
12.3.1 Diagnoses vs. signs/symptoms 
Each AE should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs (including 
abnormal laboratory values if not constituting AEs themselves or ECG findings) or symptoms 
should NOT be recorded as additional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) 
should be recorded as the AE(s). 
12.3.2 Laboratory values  
Changes in laboratory values may be considered AEs if they are judged to be clinically 
significant (i.e., if some action or intervention is required or if the investigator judges the 
change to be beyond the range of normal physiological fluctuation). If abnormal laboratory 
values are the result of pathology for which there is an overall diagnosis (e.g., increased 
creatinine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be reported as an AE. 
12.3.3 Pre-existing conditions 
Pre-existing conditions (present before the start of the AE collection period) are considered 
concurrent medical conditions and should NOT be recorded as AEs. However, if the subject 
experiences a worsening or complication of such a concurrent condition, the worsening or 
complication should be recorded as an AE. Investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condition (e.g., “worsening of….”). 
12.3.4 Pre-planned surgeries or procedures 
Pre-planned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to the start of AE 
event collection are not considered AEs. However, if a pre-planned procedure is performed 
early (e.g., as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre-existing condition, the worsening 
of the condition should be captured as an AE. 
12.3.5 Insufficient clinical response (lack of efficacy) 
Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacological action, should NOT be recorded as 
an AE. The investigator must make the distinction between exacerbation of pre-existing illness 
and lack of therapeutic efficacy. 
12.3.6 Overdose 
Cases of drug overdose without manifested side effects are NOT considered AEs. 
12.4 Assessment of Adverse Event Severity 
The
 following guidelines for rating severity of AEs should be used: 
 
Mild: 
Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated; are of minor irritant type; no loss of time 
from normal activities; symptoms would not require medication or a medical evaluation; signs 
and symptoms may be transient, disappearing during continued treatment with study 
medication.

Chronocort®        Diurnal Ltd 
 
Page 44 of 91 
Ve
rsion: Final 7.0 – [ADDRESS_920786] 2017 
 Moderate: 
Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activities; the study medication may have 
been interrupted.  
 
Severe: 
Incapacitating with inability to do work or do usual activities; signs and symptoms may be of 
systemic nature or require medical evaluation; the study drug may have been stopped, and 
treatment for the event may be required.  
 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event, as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance, such as severe headache. This is not the same as serious, which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to 
a subject’s life or functioning. 
12.5 Assessment of Adverse Event Causality/Relatedness 
All 
AEs will be assigned one of the following assessments of causality (note that both 
Chronocort® and the standard glucocorticoid replacement therapy used in the comparator arm 
are considered IMPs in this study): 
 
 Not r elated 
 R elated to the IMP  
 R elated to sick day medication 
 R elated to an interaction between IMP and sick day medication 
 R elated to either IMP or sick day medication 
 
All AEs judged by [CONTACT_680330] a reasonable suspected causal 
relationship to an IMP, or are due to an interaction with an IMP, qualify as adverse drug 
re
actions (ADRs).  
 
Appendix [ADDRESS_920787] of events that are anticipated to occur in the targeted 
stud
y entry population of subjects with congenital adrenal hyperplasia when disease treatment 
is 
not optimum. In general, if events as listed in Appendix 3 occur and are considered serious, 
they will not be reported to regulatory authorities in an expedited safety report since causality 
will likely be due to the underlying medical condition, rather than to study drug. During th e 
course of the trial, if aggregate analyses indicate that the events are occurring more frequently 
than anticipated, the sponsor will notify regulatory authorities expeditiously as appropriate. 
12.6 Assessment of Adverse Event Expectedness 
An AE 
is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator Brochure or is not listed 
at the specificity or severity that has been observed. "Unexpected," as used in this definition, 
also refers to AEs that are mentioned in the Investigator Brochure as occurring with a class of 
drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
 
The concept of expectedness does not refer to what may occur in the course of the treated 
disease such as in the case of disease progression and/o r lack of drug effect.

rsion: Final 7.0 – [ADDRESS_920788] 2017 
 12.7 Serious Adverse Event Definitions 
An 
AE is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes (21CFR312.32): 
 
 Death. 
 I s life-threatening. Life-threatening, in the definition of serious, refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
 R equires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574]. 
 R esults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. 
 I s a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 I mportant medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_680288], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
12.8 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
The definition of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) includes a 
suspected causal relationship with administration of the test preparation (thus, a causality 
assessment of unrelated is not a S[LOCATION_003]R). 
12.[ADDRESS_920789]. The investigator shall supply the sponsor and the ethics 
c
ommittee/Institutional Review Board (IRB) with any additional requested information. 
 
The
 report must be made by [CONTACT_756], facsimile, or email to the following contacts at the 
following numbers: 
 
SAEs must be notified immediately (and within 24 hours) by [CONTACT_680331]’s responsible physician,  
 and to     
. This should be done even if the required 
information is incomplete or if the investigator is awaiting laboratory or diagnostic reports. 
This should be followed by a written report within 3 working days. 
 
The S AE form requires the following information (at a minimum): 
 
 S ubject ID (case number, gender, date of birth, initials [unless date of birth and initials 
are not allowed to be collected according to local law]) 
 Trial no.

Ve
rsion: Final 7.0 – [ADDRESS_920790] 2017 
  S tudy therapy (dose, route, form regime, start date, end date) 
 C oncomitant medication (including dose, route, form, regime, start date where 
available) 
 Nature of SAE (overall diagnosis where available or alternatively signs and symptoms) 
 S everity of SAE 
 Da te and time of occurrence 
 An y associated factors (concomitant disease or medication) 
 P roposed relationship to study therapy 
 Outc ome  
 I dentification of the reporter 
 Ac tion in relation to study (withdrawn, suspended, none). 
 
Investigators may be asked for additional information for any report of an SAE. An SAE form 
indicated as a follow-up report with attached documents (if necessary) should be forwarded to 
the sponsor/designee as soon as the additional information is available. 
 
The sponsor should submit to the regulatory authority(ies) all safety updates and periodic 
reports, as required by [CONTACT_433052](s). 
 
Some of the AEs likely to occur in subjects with CAH, are of special interest, and whilst they 
may not be defined as SAEs, they will be reported in the same manner in order to capture the 
data in real time, together with additional data, if this should be required. However these events 
will not be reported to the regulatory authorities unless they are defined as SAEs. These events 
will include, but not be limited to, Addisonian crisis and events causing implementation of 
‘sick day rules’.  
 
Addisonian or adrenal crisis is defined as follows (based on Allolio 2015): 
 
 (A ): Major impairment of general health with at least two of the following 
signs/symptom s: 
Hypotension (systolic blood pressure <100 mmHg) 
Nausea or vomiting 
Severe fatigue 
Fever 
Somnolence 
Hyponatraemia (<132 mmol/L) or hyperkalaemia (as judged by [CONTACT_479062]) 
Hypoglycaemia 
 (B ): Parenteral glucocorticoid (hydrocortisone) administration followed by [CONTACT_680332]: 
Grade 1: outpatient care only 
Grade 2: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422] (general ward) 
Grade 3: admission to intensive care unit 
Grade 4: death from adrenal crisis (with or without parenteral glucocorticoid 
administration) 
 
In addition, some events may occur that represent an improvement in the subject's condition 
e.g. restoration of menses. These events are of special interest and should be recorded as AEs 
clearly stating that the event is an improvement in the condition, and these events will be coded

s 'Unexpected Therapeutic Effect'. Whilst these events are not SAEs, they should be reported 
in 
the same manner as SAEs in order to capture the data in real time, together with additional 
data, if this should be required. However these events will not be reported to the regulatory 
authorities as SAEs.  
12.10 Serious Adverse Event Expedited Reporting 
The
 sponsor or designee will expedite the reporting to the appropriate regulatory authority(ies) 
of all ADRs that are both serious and unexpected. Such expedited reports should comply with 
the applicable regulatory requirement(s) (i.e., 21CFR312.32).  
12.10.1 Standards for Expedited Reporting 
For each SAE/S[LOCATION_003]R, the investigator and sponsor (or designee) will independently assess 
whether there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_5257] 
(“drug-related”) . If the SAE is assessed to be both drug-related and unexpected, the sponsor or 
designee will report it to the appropriate regulatory authorities and notify investigators as 
required by [CONTACT_13762]. The sponsor or designee will report SAEs to the US 
FDA as required by [ADDRESS_920792] 
notification of the S[LOCATION_003]R to the sponsor/designee.  
 
All events qualifying as SAEs and S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be reported by [CONTACT_680333] ( CRO ), as necessary, to Regulatory Authorities and ethics 
committees/IRB (the latter may be through the local investigator, as required by [CONTACT_13125]). 
12.10.2 Expedited Reporting Guideline for Other Observations 
Other safety issues that might be considered for expedited reporting when they could materially 
alter the current benefit-risk assessment of the IMP (sufficient to consider changes in the 
administration or in the overall conduct of the trial) include, for example: 
 
 A n increase in the rate of occurrence of an expected serious adverse reaction, which is 
judged to be clinically important 
 Post-study S[LOCATION_003]Rs that occur after the subject has completed a clinical trial and are 
reported by [CONTACT_68477] 
 New event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the I MP likely to 
affect the safety of the subjects, such as a SAE which could be associated with the trial 
proc
edures and which could modify the conduct of the trial 
12.11 Sponsor’s Responsibilities  
The
 sponsor is responsible for the ongoing safety evaluation of the IMP. The CRO is 
responsible for ensuring that expedited reports are made to the regulatory authority(ies) and all 
applicable investigators of all ADRs that are both serious and unexpected, of findings that could 
adversely affect the health of subjects, impact on the conduct of the trial or alter the competent 
authority’s authorisation to continue the trial.

 S
uch expedited reports should comply with the applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., 
21CFR312.32). The sponsor should submit to the regulatory authority all safety updates and 
periodic reports, as required by [CONTACT_25435].  
 
The CRO is responsible for arranging structures and writt en standard operating procedures to 
ensure that the necessary quality standards are observed in every step of the case 
documentation, data collection, validation, evaluation, archiving and reporting.  The CRO will 
assign a case number to be used in all futu re correspondence regarding the event and will 
forward the case to Diurnal Ltd within one working day.  
 
All events qualifying as S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be reported by [CONTACT_680334], as 
necessary, to Regulatory Authorities and ethics committees/IRB (the latter may be through the 
local investigator, as required by [CONTACT_427]). 
12.[ADDRESS_920794] be withdrawn from the study immediately (not due to safety reasons but 
because pregnancy may interfere with the primary endpoint). The event must be reported to 
the sponsor immediately upon receipt of information by [CONTACT_5984]. While the pregnancy 
itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complications should be recorded 
as AEs or SAEs (if applicable). Any pregnancy will be followed through delivery for the 
observation of any SAEs . Fatalities and spontaneous abortions must be reported as SAEs. 
12.[ADDRESS_920795] (DSMB) will meet on a regular basis during 
the study in order to review safety data. The DSMB will meet several times during the study, 
and operate in accordance with a charter, which is a separate document. 
[ADDRESS_920796] summary statistics for continuous baseline and outcome variables are: N, mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, quartiles, minimum and maximum. The standard summary 
statistics for categorical baseline and outcome variables are: count and proportion (expressed 
as percentage). Geometric mean and coefficient of variation will also be presented for variables 
which will subsequently be log-transformed during the analysis. 
 
All efficacy variables, vital signs and laboratory assessments, together with their changes from 
baseline, will be summarised by [CONTACT_1570] (Chronocort®, standard therapy), stratum

B
aseline and demographic data will be summarised by [CONTACT_64208]. Shift 
tables from baseline will be provided for vital signs and laboratory assessments. 
 
Data on dose changes indicated by [CONTACT_479026], non-implemente d 
changes and reasons for non-implementation will be presented descriptively by [CONTACT_6490]. 
 
Where appropriate, graphical displays of variables assessed serially over time may be 
presented. 
 
The summary tables and figures will be supported by [CONTACT_680335]. 
13.1.2 Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals 
All significance probabilities will be reported as two tailed. Confidence intervals will be 
reported as 95% two-sided. 
13.1.3 Comparison of Groups 
In general, continuous variables will be compared across treatment groups using a Normal 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) linear model including pre-baseline standard therapy and, 
if 
appropriate, the baseline assessment of the variable as covariates in the model. In the case of 
c
hange-from-baseline variables, baseline will always be included as a covariate. 
Binary variables, such as response, will be compared using logistic regression with adjustment 
for covariates as in the continuous data case. 
13.1.4 Missing Outcome Data 
Missing 17-OHP and A4 values (including those considered missing due to being taken outside 
the permitted time window) within the 24-hour hormone profile will be imputed by [CONTACT_680336]-missing measurements to the scheduled missing time point 
(including out- of-window measurements). In the event that several values are missing from a 
single profile, a decision will be made about the validity of the whole profile will be made at 
the Data Review Meeting on a case- by-case basis (see Section 13.10) 
 
Subjects who withdraw from the study will be assessed on the basis of the latest available 
24-hour profile. This is a conservative procedure as subjects enter the study already receiving 
a
 suitable dose of their standard therapy.  
 
Exploratory and sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the effect of any missing data 
on the efficacy conclusions.

criteria, subject disposition/withdrawals, compliance, protocol deviations, study 
termination/duration) will be listed and summarised descriptively. Details will be described in 
the S AP. 
 
Protocol Violations/Deviations 
 
As will be described in the S AP, following trial completion, but prior to database lock, any/all 
protoc
ol deviations will be reviewed and classified as either ‘minor’ (unlikely to appreciably 
affect trial outcomes) or ‘major’ (likely to affect outcomes) and this classification will be 
utilised to define the various study populations for analysis purposes.

De
mographic and other baseline characteristics for all randomised subjects will be listed and 
summaris ed.  
13.6 Efficacy Analyses 
13.6.1 
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis is the comparison of the mean change from baseline to 24 weeks 
in the primary efficacy variable (natural logarithm of the mean over the 24-hour SDS profile 
for the natural logarithm of 17-OHP) between the Chronoco rt® treatment group and the 
standard therapy treatment group within the efficacy evaluable analysis set. 
This is the primary efficacy analysis for this study . All other analyses of this outcome variable 
and all analyses of other efficacy variables are secondary or exploratory analyses.

13.8 Power and Sample Size Considerations 
A sample size of 102 subjects provides greater than 95% power and 2-sided alpha 5% to 
demonstrate a fall in the logarithm of the mean daily unsigned standard deviation score of 
17-OHP relative to the standard glucocorticoid replacement therapy group. It is assumed that 
(i) the mean fall in the Chronocort® group will be the same (0.78) as that observed in the phase

 II
 study (DIUR-003) (ii) the mean fall in the standard therapy group will be 0.2 (approximately 
25% of the Chronocort® phase II study fall) and (iii) the standard deviation of the fall (0.681) 
is that seen in the phase II study. The study is powered to ensure that there can be a reasonable 
description of the comparison of Chronocort® with a variety of standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 120 subjects 
will
 be randomised to this study which will account for an inevaluability rate of 15%. 
I
ndividual sites should not recruit more than [ADDRESS_920808] consulting the sponsor. 
13.9 Exploratory Analyses 
Additi
onal exploratory and sensitivity analyses may include, but are not limited to: 
 a n assessment of the efficacy results in subgroups; 
 a n assessment of the effect of missing data on the efficacy conclusions; 
 a n assessment of the effect of baseline variables on efficacy 
 a  comparison between the treatment groups of the number of direction of dose 
changes made during the study period. 
Any exploratory analyses not specified in the SAP must be clearly described as such in the 
clinical study report. 
13.10 Data Review Meeting 
The
 sponsor will convene a Data Review Meeting after the data has been cleaned and the 
database locked but before analysis has commenced. The review will be performed within the 
framework of the requirements of the ICH Guideline E9. 
 
The
 terms of reference for the Data Review Meeting will include, but will not be limited to: 
 the determination of whether protocol violations are 'major' or 'minor', or not a 
protocol violation at all 
 the a llocation of subjects to analysis sets 
 a  review of missing data and of outliers 
 a  review of the distribution of the efficacy variables, considering any 
implications for the proposed method of statistical analysis 
 a  review of whether additional covariates need to be included in the analyses 
 re visions to SAP in light of any Data Review Meeting findings  
 
All persons taking part in the Data Review Meeting must only have access to datasets masked 
to treatment allocation.  Treatment group allocations will be scrambled using a dummy 
randomisation list and presented using generic treatment labels (for example, “Group A” and 
“Group B”

 A 
signed and dated inform ed consent form (ICF) shall be obtained from each subject prior to 
entering the study. The investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from 
the subject after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential 
ha
zards of the study and before any protocol specific screening procedures or any study 
medications are administered. Information should be given in both oral and written form 
whenever possible and deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_107650]/IRB. Subjects will also be 
asked to consent to allow the sponsor, sponsor representative or external regulatory auditor to 
review their medical records to confirm compliance with GCP. All information sheets and 
consent forms will be provided in local language. 
 
The acquisition of informed consent(s) should be documented in the subject’s medical record 
and the ICF should be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_29159]’s legally 
acceptable representative and by [CONTACT_28490] 
(not necessarily by [CONTACT_093]). The original signed ICF will be retained with the medical

for data verification purposes, authorised representatives of Diurnal Ltd., a regulatory 
authority, and/or an ethics committee/IRB may require direct access to parts of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_680289], including subjects’ medical history. 
 
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic information being 
linked to the identity of the subject. This involves coding of the samples and data. For coded 
samples this will mean that there is segregation of the databases containing coded genotypic 
and clinical information with protection of confidentiality achieved by [CONTACT_680337].

14.8 Drug Reconcilliation 
The
 CRA will perform drug reconciliation of supplies received on site, used, and destroyed or 
returned. The medication provided for this study is for use only as directed in the protocol. It 
is the investi
gator/institution’s responsibility to establish a system for handling study 
treatments, including IMPs, so as to ensure that: 
 
 De liveries of such products from Diurnal Ltd are correctly received by a responsible 
person 
 Such deliveries are recorded 
 S tudy treatments are handled and stored safely and properly as stated on the label 
 S tudy treatments are only dispensed to study subjects in accordance with the protocol 
 An y unused products are either returned for destruction or destroyed on site in liaison 
with the CRA and following approval from the sponsor of the destruction procedure 
 
At the e
nd of the study, it must be possible to reconcile delivery records with records of usage 
and destroyed/returned stock. Records of usage should include the identification of the person 
to 
whom the study treatment was dispensed and the quantity and date of dispensing . This record 
is in addition to any drug accountability information recorded on the e CRF . Any discrepancies 
must be accounted for on the appropriate forms. Certificates of delivery and return must be 
signed, preferably by [CONTACT_274665], and copi[INVESTIGATOR_680290]. 
 
All unused medication should be either returned for destruction or destroyed on site following

will make available all records pertaining to the study. To allow sufficient time to assemble 
documentation for the study monitor, monitoring visits will be confirmed in advance of planned 
visits. 
 
All communications, between the sponsor, designated study representative, and investigator 
should be documented for the study file.  
14.13 Publi cation Policy 
This section details the collaboration contractual terms relating to the data ownership and 
publication policy for Diurnal Ltd and the participating investigators stemming from the data 
generated from this study. 
 
The study results will be published irrespective of the study outcome. The sponsor and 
Principal Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_680291]. The sponsor’s and investigator’s comments on the proposed publication(s) shall 
be considered in good faith by [CONTACT_89588] . Publication of the results will not include company 
confidential information without the permission of the sponsor. 
 
The sponsor may announce summary data in order to comply with Financial and other 
Regulatory Authorities, whilst ensuring that release of such data will not compromise the 
investigator’s liability to publish the data in appropriate scientific forms. Announcements made 
prior to the first scientific publication of the data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_680339]. 
 
Data from individual study sites (unless the only site of a study, or a circumscribed sub-study) 
will not be published separately unless exceptional circumstances prevail.

dix 3 - Expected Adverse Events 
 
The active ingredient of Chronocort® is hydrocortisone. The safety profile of hydrocortisone is 
well characterised in humans and there is extensive clinical experience with the use of 
hydrocortisone in subjects with CAH. The excipi[INVESTIGATOR_680292]® formulation are 
also well-characterised and approved for use in humans at the proposed levels. The risks of 
Chronocort® are, therefore, expected to be no greater than the risks of an equivalent dose of 
cortisol.  
 
For US NIH clinical centre on ly (new text in bold): The active ingredient of Chronocort® is 
hydrocortisone. The safety profile of hydrocortisone is well characterized in humans and there 
is extensive clinical experience with the use of hydrocortisone in subjects with CAH. The 
excipi[INVESTIGATOR_680292]® formulation are also well-characterized and approved for 
use in humans at the proposed levels. The risks of Chronocort® are, therefore, expected to be 
no greater than the risks of an equivalent dose of cortisol. However, until the safety, efficacy 
an
d tolerability of this formulation in the treatment of individuals with CAH has been 
proven, the risk is considered to be greater than minimal rsk with the prospect of direct 
b
enefit in indidivual subjects . 
 
The Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of hydrocortisone is used as the reference for 
expected AEs ( http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/[ZIP_CODE] ). However, some of the data 
in the hydrocortisone SmPC clearly relates to anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive doses of 
glucocorticoid, which will not be used in this study of Chronocort®. Should such 
immunosuppressive events be observed they would be unexpected so are not included. 
 
The following is reproduced from section 4.8 of the hydrocortisone SmPC:  
 
The
 incidence of predictable undesirable effects, including hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal 
suppression correlates with the relative potency of the drug, dosage, timing of administration 
and the duration of treatment. The following side effects may be associated with the long-term 
systemic use of corticosteroids: 
 
Gastrointestinal:  
Dyspepsia, peptic ulceration with perforation and haemorrhage, abnormal distension, 
oesophageal ulceration, candidiasis, acute pancreatitis. 
 
Musculoskeletal:  
Proximal myopathy, osteoporosis, vertebral and long bone fractures, avascular osteonecrosis, 
tendon rupture. 
 
Fluid and electrolyte disturbance:  
Sodium and water retention, hypertension, potassium loss, hypokalaemic alkalosis. 
 
Dermatological:  
Impaired healing, skin atrophy, bruising, striae, acne, telangiectasia.

antidiabetic therapy, negative protein and calcium balance, and increased appetite. 
 
Neuropsychiatric:  
Euphoria, psychological dependence, depression, insomnia and aggravation of schizophrenia.

Increased intra-ocular pressure, glaucoma, papi[INVESTIGATOR_59411], posterior subcapsular cataracts, 
corneal or scleral thinning, exacerbation of ophthalmic viral or fungal diseases. 
 
Cardiovascular:  
Myocardial rupture following recent myocardial infarction. 
 
General:  
Hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis has been reported. Nausea, malaise, leucocytosis, 
thromboembolism. 
 
Withdrawal symptoms:  
Too rapid a reduction of corticosteroid dosage following prolonged treatment can lead to acute 
renal insufficiency, hypotension and death. A withdrawal syndrome may also occur including 
fever, myalgia, arthralgia, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, painful itchy skin modules and weight loss. 
 
A wide range of psychiatric reactions including affective disorders (such as irritable, euphoric, 
depressed and labile mood, and suicidal thoughts), psychotic reactions (including mania, 
delusions, hallucinations, and aggravation of schizophrenia), behavioural disturbances, 
irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and cognitive dysfunction including confusion and 
amnesia have been reported. Reactions are common and may occur in both adults and children. 
In adults, the frequency of severe reactions has been estimated to be 5-6%. Psychological 
effects have been reported on withdrawal of corticosteroids; the frequency is unknown. 
 
 
In addition, 3 out of 16 subjects in a phase 2 study of Chronocort® had symptoms of carpal 
tunnel syndrome (median nerve compression), which may be related to fluid retention 
secondary to Chronocort® treatment.

dix 4 - Sick Day Rules 
 
Each site should follow their own sick day rules, or if these are not available then the following 
rules should be used: 
 
ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY 
Your body does not make adequate cortisol or aldosterone. Cortisol is a hormone which has 
many purposes in the body including maintaining blood pressure. Normally cortisol is secreted 
in the body in small amounts every day by [CONTACT_234127]. In addition to the usual 
production of cortisol, the body normally has the ability to increase cortisol production in 
response to various stressors such as infection or trauma. Aldosterone is a hormone which is 
important in regulating salt and water balance. Sufficient aldosterone is necessary to prevent 
dehydration. These two hormones are being replaced in your body by [CONTACT_6589].  
 
Extra hydrocortisone must be given during times of extreme physical stress  such as illness 
with fever and significant trauma.  
 
For illnesses which result in:  
 
Fever greater than or equal to 100°F (37.7°C)/ minor illnesses: take 10mg Hydrocortisone 
three times a day in addition to the usual daily dose of Chronocort®. 
 
Fever greater than or equal to 101°F (38.3°C)/ more severe illness: take 20mg Hydrocortisone 
three times a day in addition to the usual daily dose of Chronocort®.  
 
Vomiting: If you vomit, wait one half-hour and then take 20mg of hydrocortisone for sick day 
rules from your packet provided. If you vomit the Chronocort® dose do not take another dose 
of Chronocort® until the next dose is due. Call the study team to let us know you are sick. If 
you are vomiting and cannot keep the medication down (vomit less than 1 hour after the dose), 
you need to administer injectable hydrocortisone. Do not delay giving injectable 
hydrocortisone.  Drink SMALL  amounts of clear liquids frequently, as tolerated. Call your 
doctor or go to an emergency room if your symptoms worsen or you do not improve within 
one hour. 
 
Watch for signs of acute cortisol deficiency: headache, nausea, abdominal pain, dehydration, 
confusion, weakness, fatigue.  
 
An injectable form of hydrocortisone must be kept in an easily accessible location for 
emergencies (i.e. purse, briefcase, desk at work). It may be kept for several years in the 
unmixed form at room temperature. It should not be exposed to extreme hot or cold (i.e. do not 
store in the glove compartment of a car) . Check the expi[INVESTIGATOR_479009] a 
prescription refill when needed. Also make sure you have the needle necessary to inject the 
medication.  
 
Your dose of hydrocortisone for injection is [ADDRESS_920828]:  CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No.: DIUR-00 5

 Othe
r points to remember:  
 
 When you are sick, drink sugar and salt containing liquids (e.g. non-diet soda, Gatorade , 
Lucozade, soup). 
 
 I f you need to have surgery, extensive dental work, or you have been in an accident, 
extra doses of hydrocortisone will be needed, usually by [CONTACT_479075]. Notify any physician or dentist that you have ADRENAL 
INSUFFICIENCY, so proper amounts of hydrocortisone can be given prior to a 
procedure.  
 
 I t is essential that you wear a medical identification bracelet or necklace to alert people 
in times of emergency that you have adrenal insufficiency and are taking medication. 
It is also a good idea to have a wallet card or something on your driver’s licenc e 
identifying you as having ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY.  
 
 Call your doctor for:  
Fever for more than three days 
Changes in behaviour, such as acting confused 
 
 I f you are living with someone, let them know to seek medical help on your behalf if 
you are unresponsive or difficult to arouse. 
 
Ensure that you have a list of important phone numbers:

rsion: Final 7.0 – [ADDRESS_920898]. The following changes were 
made:  
 
1) Modification of the RSI in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) necessitated an update to 
Appendix 3 (Expected Adverse Events) in the protocol. 
2) C
larification was added that the DSMB is independent.  
3) The inclusion criteria of PRA less than [ADDRESS_920899]. 
4) Appendix [ADDRESS_920900] (minor 
administrative change). 
Protocol Version 3.0 dated 03 December 2015  
The protocol was amended to address the Swedish Medicines Agency and the US National 
Institutes of Health comments on the protocol that a separate benefit/risk assessment should be 
added. The following c hanges were  made:  
 
1) S
ection 5: new section added at the end of Section 5 titled Benefit/Risk Assessment. 
P
rotocol Version 4.0 dated 28 May 2016  
The following changes were made to the protocol: 
 
1) The Sponsor signatory was changed from .  
 
2) Different clinicians use different conversion factors for dexamethasone to hydrocortisone. 
The
 protocol states that ‘The initial dose setting at the start of Chronocort® treatment will 
be made on hydrocortisone dose equivalent of baseline therapy, with the hydrocortisone 
dose calculated as dexamethasone dose multiplied by 80’. Investigators and Diurnal have 
been concerned that this may lead to a safety issue that if patients on a higher dose of 
dexamethasone were converted by x80 they would be exposed to excess hydrocortisone, 
therefore a greater mineralocorticoid effect, and be at risk of being overdosed. Therefore 
the protocol was amended to state that the current conversion rate of x80 should be used 
as per protocol up to a maximum starting dose of Chronocort® 30mg (split 20mg at night 
and 10mg in the morning). The justification for the maximum of 30mg Chronocort® is 
based on the fact this was the starting dose for all patients in the Phase 2 study (DIUR-003) 
(Mallappa 2015) and is in line with recommendations for hydrocortisone dosing in CAH 
(Speiser 2010).  If the investigator has any concerns regarding the starting dose in a patient 
then these can be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
 
3) The protocol stated that blood samples should be taken for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], unless genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_680295]. It was clarified that if previous genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_680296].

 4)
 Subjects who routinely work night shifts and so do not sleep during the usual nighttime 
hours was added to the exclusion criteria.  
 
5) At the request of the Dutch ethics committee, the following sentence has been added to the 
procedures for the screening visit (Section 11.1.1) and also in Section 11.4 (Informed 
Consent): At Dutc h centres only, potential subjects will be approached by [CONTACT_680341]. If the treating physician is also the investigator the subject information 
sheet can be provided immediately. If this is not the case then the treating physician will 
ask the patient for permission for the investigator to approach them about study 
participation.  
 
6)
 It was noted that the terminology for the independent blinded physician was not consistent 
throughout the protocol so this was corrected throughout.  
 
7)
 In the synopsis, Section 8 (Study Design) and Section 10.4 (Dose Adjustment) it was stated 
that ‘Dose adjustment will not take place without measurement of androgens at an inpatient 
visit,  unless the local investigator considers it is indicated by [CONTACT_680342]. ’ 
However, this statement was considered confusing and also seemed to mandate the 
measurement of androgens at an unscheduled dose adjustment, which was not the case. 
The text was therefore revised to say ‘No dose adjustments outside of the protocol-defined 
dose adjustments should be conducted, unless clinical signs and symptoms indicate an 
immediate need. In such cases the Sponsor’s medical monitor must be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 
(preferably before any dose changes are implemented). Any such unscheduled dose 
adjustments should be based on clinical symptoms only, with repeated androgen testing 
discouraged and must be pre-approved by [CONTACT_1034]’s medical monitor.’ 
 
Protocol Version 5.0 dated 23 September 2016 
 
The
 following changes were made to the protocol: 
 
1) The Sponsor signatory was changed from  
 
2) The Chronocort® capsules may now be supplied in either blister pack s or bottles. 
Therefore, Section 10.2.2 (Packaging and Labelling) and Appendix 9 (Labelling) were 
updated . 
 
Protocol Version 6.0 dated 13 April 2017 
 
The
 following changes were made to the protocol: 
 
1) The statistician was changed from . 
 
2) The sample size was increased from 110 to 120 p atients due to a higher level of protocol 
deviations than originally anticipated. As such, the inevaluability rate has been increased 
from 7% to 15%. 
 
3) The titration instructions in Section 8 (Dose Adjustment) has been modified to provide 
guidance if the independent blinded physician states that a change to the midday dose is 
needed but the patient is either receiving Chronocort or is receiving twice daily dosing of 
standard therapy. In such cases the local investigator is instructed to decide whether to

already advised for morning and evening doses, thus ensuring that the total change advised 
is ac
commodated within the day. 
 
4) The screening period has been extended by 1 week (21 days) to allow extra time for the 
stud
y site to obtain the results of the screening PRA test.  
 
5) Clarification added to Sections 9.2 and 11.7 and the synopsis that  female subjects 
presenting with oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea who are aged ≤55 years of age should 
be
 considered potentially fertile and therefore, as well as undergoing pregnancy testing 
like all other female subjects, will be expected to be using an acceptable method of 
contraception, as listed in S ection 11.7. 
 
6)
 Some events may occur during the study that represent an improvement in the subject's 
condition e.g. restoration of menses. To ensure sufficient details of such events are 
recorded, Section 12.[ADDRESS_920903] 2017 (administrative local amendment for US only) 
 
F
ollowing comments from the IRB, an additional statement has been added in Appendix 3 
(E
xpected Adverse Events) amending the risk category from 'minimal risk with the prospect of 
direct benefit to individual subjects' to 'greater than minimal risk with the prospect of direct 
benefit to individual subjects'. This is administrative change at the NIH clinical centre in the 
US only and has arisen due to an error in the NIH IRB classification at the beginning of the 
study (i.e. there is no actual change to the benefit/risk assessment).

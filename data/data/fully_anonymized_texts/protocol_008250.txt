Statistical Analyses  Part A 
Sample size calculations conducted using noncompartmental analysis -based PK 
parameters, such as clearance and volume, in adults indicate that data from 8 subjects will allow 80% power to target a 95% CI within 60% and 140% of the 
geometric mean estimate of clearance for VX -661 in each pediatric subgroup 
(cohort). 
There will be no statistical analyses  for the safety variables in Part  A. All safety 
analyses will be performed descriptively.  
Part B 
An important safety endpoint is the incidence of AEs. With 50  subjects 
completing the study, there is a 92.3% chance of observing AEs in at least [ADDRESS_388177] if the true incidence rate is 5%, and a 99.5% chance of observing AEs in 
at least [ADDRESS_388178] if the true incidence rate is 10%.  
For the primary endpoints, summary statistics will be provided for treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), clinical laboratory assessments

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects an estimated 70,[ADDRESS_388201] in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an epi[INVESTIGATOR_139327] (Cl
-) 
channel activated by [CONTACT_315435] -dependent protein kinase A that is responsible for aiding in 
the regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion in various tissues .3 This function is 
defective in patients with CF due to a loss of either cell surface expression and/or function. 
More than [ADDRESS_388202] the quantity of 
functional cell surface CFTR protein include defects that reduce CFTR protein synthesis and defects that impede the cellular processing and delivery of CFTR proteins to the cell surface.  
CFTR gene mutations associated with minimal CFTR function include 
• mutations associated with severe defects in ability of the CFTR channel to open and 
close, known as defective channel gating or “gating mutations”; 
• severe defects in the cellular processing of CFTR and its delivery to the cell surface;  
• no (or minimal) CFTR synthesis; and  
• severe defects in channel conductance.  
The most prevalent mutation is an in -frame deletion in the CFTR gene resulting in a loss of 
phenylalanine at position 508 in the CFTR protein (F508del- CFTR).
[ADDRESS_388203] 87% 
of patients with CF have at least 1  copy of the  F508del- CFTR mutation and about 47% have 
2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014].12 In the European Union, approximately 83% of patients with CF have 1 or 2  copi[INVESTIGATOR_315403] F508del- CFTR mutation, and approximately 38.7% of patients with CF in the United 
Kingdom have [ADDRESS_388204] been studied.10 One approach is to treat with a compound that will modify the 
cellular processing and trafficking of the CFTR protein to increase the amount of  functional 
CFTR at the cell surface. This kind of compound has been termed a CFTR corrector. Another 
approach is to treat with a compound that increases the channel gating activity of protein kinase A-activated CFTR at the cell surface to enhance ion tran sport. This kind of compound 
has been termed a potentiator. Depending on the amount of residual CFTR channel activity in the membrane and the pathophysiology of that activity (reflecting the CFTR genotype of 
the patient and possibly other factors), both approaches may be required to ameliorate lung disease in patients with CF. A modest restoration of Cl
- secretion through the action of a 
potentiator and/or corrector could prevent the hyperabsorption of water across the api[INVESTIGATOR_139329], al lowing proper maintenance of airway hydration. Adequate 
airway hydration could alleviate the cycle of mucus plugging, infection, and inflammation, which leads to irreversible structural changes in the lungs and, eventually, respi[INVESTIGATOR_315404].  
VX-661 is a CFTR corrector that works by [CONTACT_315436] F508del-CFTR and other mutant CFTR forms, thereby [CONTACT_315437], resulting in enhanced chloride transport.
17 When added for 
more than 24 hours to human bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (HBE) cells isolated and cultured from lung explants obtained from donors with CF (CF-HBE cells) who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, a concentration- dependent increase in levels of mature (i.e.,  plasma 
membrane) F508del -CFTR was observed. The increased trafficking of F508del-CFTR to the 
cell surface resulted in a significant increase in Cl
− secretion .[ADDRESS_388205] the 
processing and localization of other misfolded or normally folded proteins other than CFTR, suggesting that the mechanism of VX-661 action is selective for CFTR (CFTR corrector).
18 
Ivacaftor (also known as VX-770) is the first CFTR modulator to show an improvement in CFTR function and clinical benefit in patients with CF. Results from several Phase [ADDRESS_388206] mutations 
that result in gating defects as evidenced by [CONTACT_139371] (measured by [CONTACT_139372]) and corresponding substantial, durable improvements in lung function, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], and weight gain. Ivacaftor was also well tolerated, as evidenced by [CONTACT_315438].  
Kalydeco (ivacaftor) is indicated for the treatment of CF in patients as young as [ADDRESS_388207] 1 of the following mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, 
G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, S549R, or  R117H. Please refer to the ivacaftor

 DESIGN 
8.1 Overview of Study Design  
This is a Phase  3, 2-part (Part A and Part B), open- label, multicenter study evaluating the PK, 
safety, and tolerability of multiple doses of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor in subjects 
6 through 11 years of age with CF who are homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Efficacy will also be evaluated in Part B. Part A is composed of 
2 weight-based cohorts, which will be enrolled simultaneously, and Part B is composed of a 
single cohort. Subjects who participate in Part  A may participate in Part B if Part B eligibility 
criteria are met.  
Part A 
Up to approximately 16 subjects total are planned for enrollment across Cohort 1 (subjects weighing <25  kg at baseline) and Cohort 2 (subjects weighing ≥25 kg at baseline ).  
Part A includes the following: 
• Screening Period (Day  -28 through Day -1) 
• Treatment Period (Day  1 through Day 14) 
• Washout Period (Day 14 to Day 28 [± 3 days])  
• Safety Follow -up Visit (14 [±  3] days after the last dose of study drug) 
Figure 8-1 depi[INVESTIGATOR_315406]  A study design. After obtaining written 
informed consent (and assent, if applicable), Screening Visit assessments will be completed at any time during the p eriod of 4 weeks (Day  -28 through Day -1) before the first dose of the 
study drug (Day 1). During the Treatment Period, subjects will be administered VX-661 
50 mg daily (qd) in combination with ivacaftor, either 75 mg (subjects <25 kg at baseline) or 
150 mg (subjects ≥25 kg at baseline), every 12  hours (q12h) for 14 days. A 2-week Washout 
Period (Day 14 to Day 28 [± 3 days] ) will be included in order to evaluate the off- drug 
response. A Safety Follow -up Visit is scheduled to occur 14 (±  3) days after the la st dose of 
study drug for all subjects, including subjects who permanently discontinue from study treatment for any reason.  
A review of safety, tolerability, and PK data will be completed by [CONTACT_315439] A to select the VX -661 dose fo r Part B.  

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 25 of 93

Part B 
Approximately 56 subjects are planned for enrollment. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, 
approximately 50 subjects are expected to complete Part  B.  
Part B includes the following: 
• Screening Period (Day  -28 through Day -1) 
• Treatment Period (Day  1 through Week 24 [±  5 days]) 
• Safety Follow -up Visit (4  weeks [± 7 days] after the last dose of study drug) 
Figure 8-2 depi[INVESTIGATOR_315406]  B study design. After obtaining written 
informed consent (and assent, if applicable), Screening Visit assessments will be completed at any time during the period of 4 weeks (Day  -28 through Day -1) before the first dose of 
study drug (Day 1). During the Treatment Period, subjects will be administered VX -661 
50 mg qd in combination with ivacaftor 75 mg  q12h (subjects <40 kg at baseline) or VX -661 
100 mg qd in combination with ivacaftor 150 mg  q12h (subjects ≥40 kg at baseline) for 
24 weeks.  No dose adjustments will be made throughout the duration of treatment in this 
study. At the Week  24 Visit, subjects who complete study drug treatment will be offered the 
opportunity to enroll in an extension study evaluating VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor (enrollment will be  based on the eligibility criteria specified within the extension study). 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment are not eligible to rollover into 
the extension study. 
A Safety Follow -up Visit is scheduled to occur 4 weeks (± 7 days) aft er the last dose of study 
drug. The Safety Follow-up Visit is not required for subjects who have enrolled in the 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.[ADDRESS_388209] an Early Treatment Termination (ETT) Visit and 
a Safety Follow -up Visit. 
Figure 8-2 Schematic of Study Design for Part  B 
 
8.1.1 Screening 
Part A and Part  B 
Screening Visit assessments are listed in  Table 3-1  (Part A) and Table 3-3 (Part B). 
The Screening Period will occur within [ADDRESS_388210]'s parent or legal guardian must sign and date a study-specific informed consent form (ICF) and the subject must sign an assent form (if applicable) before any study- specific procedures can 
be performed. The ICF (and assent form, if applicable) w ill comply with all applicable 
regulations governing the protection of human subjects and will be approved by [CONTACT_139385]'s institutional review board (IRB).  
To prepare for study participation, subjects will be instructed on the Study Restrictions (Section 9.3) and use of concomitant medications ( Section 9.4).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Repetition of Screening Period Assessments  
Part A and Part  B  
Repetition of any individual Screening Visit assessment(s) that do not meet eligibility criteria is not permitted, with the following exceptions:  
• If there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g.,  hemolyzed sample) or equipment 
malfunction, collection of a repeat sample for the appropriate laboratory test may be 
permitted after discussion with the Vertex medical monitor or authorized designee.  

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 27 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • If a convincing al ternative etiology is identified for elevated transaminases, e xclusionary 
liver function test (LFT) levels may be retested within 14  days of the original Screening 
Visit date.  
If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and 
completed within the Screening Period window, then the subject is eligible for the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rescreening  
Part A and Part  B  
Subjects may be rescreened after discussion with, and approval from, the Vertex medical 
monitor or authorized designee to account for e xclusionary events that may not reflect the 
subject’s true baseline due to an acute event, which may resolve. Subjects who complete Part A or who discontinue treatment for other reasons than safety reasons and wish to 
participate in Part B, must be rescreened and meet all eligibility criteria before enrolling in Part B. Subjects who were not eligible to participate in Part A may be rescreened for Part B 
after discussion with, and approval from, the Vertex medical monitor or authorized designee. 
If a subject is rescreened, all Screening Visit assessments will be repeated except for CF 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_315407] (if the ophthalmologic examination was performed within 3 months before the Rescreening Visit). If a subject is rescreened, the screening window will begin after the first rescreening assessment has been initiated.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Extension of Screening Period Window  
Part A and Part  B 
A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 2 weeks after approval by [CONTACT_315440]: 
• Repetition of the Screening Period assessments ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Unexpected operational or logist ic delays, or to meet the eligibility criteria  
• Scheduling of the ophthalmologic examination ( Section 11.7.6)  
8.1.[ADDRESS_388211]’s legally appointed and authorized representative (e.g., parent or legal guardian) for administration to the study subjects on study days where a clinic visit is not scheduled, as described in Section 10.1. 
If a subject has any clinically significant, study -related abnormalities at the conclusion of a 
scheduled visit, the Vertex medical monitor or authorized designee will be notified, and the 
investigator will make every effort to arrange follow -up evaluations at appropriate intervals 
to document the course of the abnormalities. 
Part A  
Table 3-[ADDRESS_388212] dose of study drug will be the morning dose administered on Day 14 ( Figure 8-1). Dosing details are given in Section 10.2. Subjects must return to the 
clinical site on Day 21 for PK assessments (Table 3-2) . 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing will be asked to return to the clinical site for a Safety Follow -up Visit ( Section 8.1.5). 
Part B 
Table 3-[ADDRESS_388213] dose of study drug will be the evening dose 
administered the day before the Week 24 Visit. Dosing details are given in Sec tion 10.2. 
8.1.3 Washout Period  
Part A 
A 2-week Washout Period (Day 14 to Day 28 ± 3 days) will be included in order to evaluate 
the off-drug response.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   8.2 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens  
8.2.1 Study Design 
This is a Phase  3, 2-part (Part A and Part  B), open- label, multicenter study evaluating the PK, 
safety, and tolerability of multiple  doses of VX- 661 in combination with ivacaftor in  subjects 
6 through 11 years of age with CF who are homozygous or heterozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR mutation. Efficacy will also be evaluated in Part B. Part  A is composed of 
2 cohorts and Part B is composed of a single cohort. The open- label design is considered 
adequate to evaluate the PK and safety of VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor in this 
pediatric population. Subjects will be divided into 2 weight-based cohorts in Part A so that 
the relationship between VX-661 PK and body weight can be explored a cross the entire 
weight range expected in the 6 to 11 year old population.  
The subjects studied are from the population that is expected to benefit from VX-661 in 
combination with ivacaftor. Part B is designed to evaluate the long term safety, tolerabilit y, 
and PK, as well as efficacy, of VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor in the pediatric CF 
population. This design is in harmony with guidelines for the study of human subjects, especially children, and balances safety concerns with potential benefits for  the individual. 
8.2.2 Study Drug Dose and Duration 
[IP_ADDRESS] VX-[ADDRESS_388219] the VX -661 dose for Part B. The PK data in Part  A were consistent with the 
predictions from the population PK model. Consequently, this model was used to simulate exposures for different VX -661 doses in weight ranges expected for subjects 6 through 
11 years of age. Based on these simulations, VX-661 doses of 50 mg  qd in subjects weighing 
<40 kg and 100 mg  qd in subjects weighing >40 kg were selected for Part  B to match the 
exposures observed at the dose of 100 mg qd in subjects 12 years and older. These exposures were shown to be safe and efficacious in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies (VX11-661-101, VX13-661-103, VX14 -661-106, and VX14 -661-108). 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 31 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   [IP_ADDRESS] Ivacaftor Dose 
Part A  
Ivacaftor doses have been selected to provide similar exposures to those observed at the 
efficacious dose in adults. Based on population PK simulations, an ivacaftor dose of 75 mg q12h in subjects 6 through 11 years of age weighing <25  kg and a dose of 
150 mg q12h in subjects 6 through 11 years of age weighing ≥25 kg is expected to yield 
similar exposures to those observed in adults administered 150 mg  q12h.  
Therefore, the ivacaftor doses chosen for the pediatric population in this study (6 through 
11 years of age) are:  
• 75 mg q12h in su bjects <25 kg at baseline  
• 150 mg q12h in subjects ≥25 kg at baseline  
Part B 
For Part B, it was desired to provide similar IVA exposures to those observed at the 
efficacious dose in adults while maintaining the same TEZ:IVA  ratio in adult and pediatric 
populations. Following review of the safety, tolerability, and PK data from Part A, additional population PK simulations of IVA were performed to evaluate the impact on IVA exposures of increasing the weight cutoff from 25 kg to 40 kg to maintain consistency with TEZ dosing 
and the adult TEZ:IVA ratio. As expected, these simulations demonstrated that lowering the IVA dose from 150 mg  q12h to 75 mg  q12h in subjects weighing between 25 kg and 40 kg 
lowered predicted IVA exposures. However, IVA exposures were similar to those observed at the efficacious dose in adults. Additionally, the majority of subjects still achieved IVA 
exposures exceeding the model -predicted EC
90 calculated  for ppFEV 1 in the G551D gating 
population. 23  Given that the IVA EC 90 for G551D exceeds that for F508del and other 
mutations that are responsive to IVA in vitro (that is, these same exposures are predicted to exceed the EC90 for these mutations by [CONTACT_315441] G551D)
 24, increasing the IVA 
weight cut off f

development; however, a potential association has not been fully excluded. 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]: Since lung disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality for patients 
with CF, CF lung disease is the desired primary target of VX-661/ivacaftor combination therapy. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (as measured by [CONTACT_10266]
1) is the most widely implemented standardized 
assessment to ev aluate lung function. 
Nutritional Status (measured by [CONTACT_315442]): Malnutrition is common in patients with 
CF because of increased energy expenditures due to lung disease and fat malabsorption. Given that VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor is a syste mic therapy, it has the potential to 
improve extrapulmonary manifestations of CF, including those in the gastrointestinal system. Improved nutritional status, defined as an increase in weight and/or BMI, is considered an appropriate endpoint for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_315408]-targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Studies  VX08-770-102 and VX08-770-103). To evaluate the 
effect of VX -[ADDRESS_388223] of VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor on growth 
and nutrition adjusted for age and sex, weight- for-age, height- for-age, BMI- for-age, and the 
respective z -scores will be determined. Height and weight will be collected at the study visits 
indicated in the schedule of assessments.  
Sweat Chloride:  In patients with CF, the underlying CFTR ion transport defect results in 
elevated sweat electrolyte levels.25,[ADDRESS_388224] (quantitative pi[INVESTIGATOR_315409]) is the
 most common diagnostic tool for CF. A sweat chloride concentration of

In addition, sweat collection must be performed at the Screening Visit (Table 3-1 [ Part A] 
and Table 3-3 [ Part B]) if an eligible sweat chloride value is not available in the subject’s 
medical record (NOTE:  for subjects who are heterozygous for t he F508del-CFTR mutation 
and with a second CFTR allele with a gating defect that is clinically demonstrated to be ivacaftor responsive, this value may be obtained from a record collected prior to use of 
Kalydeco).  For subjects using a sweat chloride value documented in their medical record to 
establish eligibility, the sweat chloride test at the Screening Visit is optional.  
Collection of sweat chloride will not overlap with any other study assessments.  
Subjects and their parent/caregiver should not be informed of their study- related sweat 
chloride results during the Treatment Period.  
11.6.3 Weight, Height, and BMI  
Weight, height, and BMI (derived) will be assessed. Weight and height will be measured with shoes off at time points noted in Table 3-2 and  Table 3-4. Weight and height will be 
measured before the dose of the study drug during the Treatment Period.

test). 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.[ADDRESS_388275] will be permanently withdrawn from study drug dosing as discussed in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. If a pregnancy test is positive, the procedures outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] will be followed.  
CF genotype ( Screening Period only ): CF genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_315421]'s medical record. This assessment does not need to be repeated in the case of rescreening or for confirmed subjects in Part A who wish to participate in Part B. In subjects with the R117H  mutation, linkage to poly- T tract 
polymorphisms will also be determined from a second specimen. Specific instructions will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
Alcohol Screening ( Part A Only): Subjects may undergo random urine alcohol testing if 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093].  
Additional Evaluations : Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged by [CONTACT_252865].  
For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for 
management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by [CONTACT_315451] a s possible after 
the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94248]), the investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local  laboratory value . 
11.7.[ADDRESS_388276] Parameters  
Part A and Part  B  
Liver Function Testing 
Liver function testing (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, direct bilirubin, and total bilirubin) must be performed as noted in Table  3-[ADDRESS_388277] elevations of >3  × ULN and clinical 
symptoms must be followed closely, including repeat confirmatory testing performed by [CONTACT_315452] [ADDRESS_388278] is >5 × ULN, repeat follow-up levels must be obtained within 7 ± [ADDRESS_388279] the tests repeated and sent to the central 
laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours). 
Study Drug Interruption  
Study drug administration must be interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing), 
and the medical monitor m ust be notified, if any of the following criteria is met: 
• ALT or AST >8  × ULN 
• ALT or AST >5  × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST >3  × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2  × ULN and/or 
clinical jaundice  
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted and the subject should be 
followed closely for clinical progression. 
If no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, or alcohol 
ingestion) for the elevated transaminases is identified, regardless of whether ALT or AST levels have improved, study drug treatment must be permanently discontinued if repeat testing within [ADDRESS_388280] their trans aminases monitored closely 
until levels normalize or return to baseline.  
Resumption of Study Drug 
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation has been identified, study drug may be resumed once transaminases return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, whichever is higher. 
Approval of the medical monitor is required before resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol-defined transaminase elevation occurs within 4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by [CONTACT_94525] 48 to 72 hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless of the presumed etiology. 
11.7.[ADDRESS_388281] study visits (Table 3-1, Table 3-2, Table 3-3 , and Table 3-4 ). At other visits, 
symptom-directed PEs and symptom- directed vital sign assessments can be performed at the 
discretion of the investigator or healthcare provider
. 
A PE includes a review of the following systems: head/neck/thyroid; eyes/ears/nose/throat (EENT); respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examinations will be reported as AEs.  
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature (oral), pulse rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. These will be assessed following a [ADDRESS_388282] 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 3-1, Table 3-2, Table 3-3, and Table 3-4 ). Additional 
standard 12- lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated.  
The performance of all ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines: 
• The subject will be instructed to rest in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5  minutes before 
having an ECG performed. 
• The ECG will be performed before any other procedures that may affect heart rate, such 
as blood draws. 
The ECG traces will be manually read at the study site at the Screening and Safety Follow -up 
Visits. A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by [CONTACT_139386]. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through the Safety Follow-up Visit will be recorded as AEs.  
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make 
comparisons to baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >45  msec from the 
baseline or an absolute QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2  additional ECGs 
will be performed approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value 
(>45 msec from baseline or ≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until 
QTcF values from 2  successive ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the r epeat 
measurement.  
If the QTcF value remains above the threshold value (>45 msec from the average of the 3 predose values on Day 1 or ≥500 msec) on repeated measurement or is noted on >[ADDRESS_388283] their QTc monitored closely until it normalizes or returns to  baseline.  
Further details pertaining to ECGs will be provided to sites in a separate document (ECG Manual).

12 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PLANS  
This section presents a summary of the planned analyses for this protocol. Statistical analysis details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), and PK data analysis details will be provided in the Clinical Pharmacology Analysis Plan (CPAP), both of which will be finalized before the clinical data lock for the study.  
12.1 Sample Size and Power  
Part A 
Sample size calculations were conducted to estimate the precision in deter mining VX -661 
clearance in pediatric subjects in the 2 weight -based cohorts. The method used 
noncompartmental analysis -based PK parameters, such as clearance and volume, in adults 
with the assumption that there is similar variability in clearance in adults  and pediatric 
subjects 6  through 11 years of age within each weight group. The calculations indicate that 
data from 8  subjects will allow 80% power to target a 95% CI within 60% and 140% of the 
geometric mean estimate of clearance for VX -661 in each pediatric subgroup (cohort).  
Part B 
Planned enrollment is approximately 56 subjects. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, approximately [ADDRESS_388309] with an AE for the given incidence (θ) and sample size. With a total sample size of 50 subjects (compl eter), there is a 92.3% chance of observing AEs in at least [ADDRESS_388310] if the 
true incidence rate is 5%, and a 99.5% chance of observing AEs in at least [ADDRESS_388311] if the true incidence rate is 10%. The probabilities have been calculated by [CONTACT_7702] a binomi al 
distribution for the number of AEs using SAS

No statistical tests will be carried out to evaluate any baseline imbalance between treatment 
groups. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications used in this study will be coded by [CONTACT_315455].  
Part A 
Medications in Part A will be categorized as the following:  
• Prior medication:  any medication that started before the first dose of study drug in 
Part A, regardless of when it ended. 
• Concomitant medication:  medication continued or newly received during the TE period 
for Part A. 
• Post-treatment medication: medication continued or newly received after the TE period 
for Part A. For those subjects from Part A who enrolled in Part B, medications that 
continued or were newly received on or after the first dose of study drug i n Part B will 
not be considered as post- treatment medication.  
A given medication can be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post- treatment; 
or prior, concomitant, and post- treatment. If a medication has a missing or partial missing 
start/end date or time and it cannot be determined whether the medication was taken before first dose, concomitantly, or post-treatment, it will be considered as prior, concomitant, and post-treatment.  
Prior and post- treatment medications will only be listed and not summarized. The 
concomitant medications will be summarized descriptively based on the Safety Set.

will be provided for all secondary efficacy variables based  on FAS.  
Absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 24 :  
Absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 will be analyzed using a restricted maximum 
likelihood (REML)- based mixed effect model repeated measures (MMRM) approach that 
would include 'treatme nt', 'visit', and 'treatment by [CONTACT_765]' interaction as fixed, categorical 
effects and 'baseline ppFEV 1' as continuous, fixed covariate. A n unstructured (co)variance 
structure will be used to model the within -subject errors. If the model fails to converge, a 
compound symmetry covariance structure will be considered. The degrees of freedom of the 
denominator will be approximated by [CONTACT_315456]-Roger’s method.41 The estimated mean 
change from
 baseline through Week 24 within each treatment group and the overall t reatment 
will be calculated using appropriate contrasts. The corresponding LS means, P  value and the 
95% CI will be calculated and presented in a table. The primary assessment of efficacy will be based on these estimates.  
The estimated 
mean changes at post -baseline visits within each treatment group and the 
overall treatment will also be presented. The least squares (LS) means, P values and the 95% 
CIs will be presented in a table. The LS means (95% CI) for change from baseline at each visit will be plotted  for the individual treatment groups and the overall treatment group. 
Additional supportive analysis and sensitivity analysis may be described in the SAP. 
Relative change in ppFEV
1 from baseline through Week 24 : Analysis of this variable will 
be performed using the same approach as described for the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from 
baseline.  
Absolute change in weight (/weight -for-age z- score) from baseline at Week  24: Analysis 
of this variable will be similar to that for the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline. The 
MMRM will use baseline weight (/weight- for-age z-score) as covariate instead of baseline 
ppFEV 1. For this variable, the assessment of efficacy will be primarily based on Week  24.  
Absolute change in height (/height -for-age z- score) from baseline at Week  24: Analysis 
of this variable will be similar to that for the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline. The 
MMRM will use baseline height (/height- for-age z-score) as covariate instead of baseline 
ppFEV 1. For this variable, the assessment of efficacy will be primarily based on Week  24.

this variable will be similar to that for the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline. The 
MMRM will use baseline BMI (/BMI -age z-score) as covariate instead of baseline ppFEV 1. 
For this variable, the assessment of efficacy will be primarily based on Week  24.  
Absolute changes in sweat chloride from baseline through Week  4 and through 
Week 24: Analysis of this variable will be performed using the same approach as described 
for the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline. The MMRM will use baseline sweat 
chloride value as covariate instead of baseline ppFEV 1. The estimated mean change from 
baseline through Week 4 and Week 24 within each treatment group and the overall treatment 
will be calculated using appropriate contrasts. The corresponding LS means, P  value, and the 
95% CI will be calculated and presented in a table. For this variable, the assessment of efficacy will be primarily based on the estimates for mean change from baseline through 
Week 24. Note that for each scheduled sampling time point, 1 sample from each arm would 
be obtained. The data analysis will use the average of the results from the 2  samples. 
Absolute change in t he CFQ-R respi[INVESTIGATOR_315423] 24: Analysis of this domain will be similar to that for the absolute change in ppFEV

VX-661, ivacaftor, and their metabolites. The PK/PD relationship between concentrations of 
VX-661 and ivacaftor (and their metabolites as appropriate) and efficacy and safety measurements may be investigated. The results of the PK and PK/PD analyses using a population approach will be presented in a separate report. 
13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND ADMI NISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, 
Severity Grading, and Reporting 
13.1.1 Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or worsening of a preexisting condition (e.g., increase in its severity or frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinically Significant Assessments 
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs, will be assessed 
and those deemed a clinically significant worsening from baseline documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglobin).  
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more 
of the following: 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 75 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment 
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A change in the d ose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of 
whether the study a ssessment results are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_1275].  
A laboratory value that is Grade [ADDRESS_388325] indicates a life -threatening  AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time ICF is signed until the following time points:  
• For subjects who do not enroll: until time of screen failure (e.g., screen failure, withdrawal of consent) 
• For enrolled subjects wh o have a Safety Follow -up Visit: through the Safety Follow-up 
Visit 
• For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow-up Visit, the earliest  of: 
o [ADDRESS_388326] dose of study drug in the extension study ( Part B). 
All subjects will be queried, using non-leading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as [ADDRESS_388327]'s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE: 
• Description of the event 
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious” 
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) 
• Severity 
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and non-serious AEs. 
The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 76 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Pr ogram, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
August 2012). AEs of CTCAE Grades  4 and 5 will be documented as “life-thr eatening.” In 
considering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that 
reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the CTCAE. The severity of an AE that does not appear i n the CTCAE will be determined 
according to the definitions in Table 13-1.  
Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening 
(Grade 4) Any adverse drug experience that places the subject, in the view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to 
the study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2.  
Table 13-[ADDRESS_388328] been ruled 
out, and/or the event re -appeared on re- exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly rel ated There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, 
such as charac teristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to 
be related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject's medical record).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the A E. The action 
taken will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3.  

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.[ADDRESS_388329] to an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Outcome 
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4. 
Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/Resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/ Resolved 
With Sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not Recovered/Not 
Resolved (Continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing 
Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at leas t possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow -up) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], surg ery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of 
treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
• Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs 
after participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study drug) 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 78 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as 
it occurred  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home)  
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139355], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_168788], unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139357]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94253] (e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) will not be considered to indicate an SAE. 
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and "severe,” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is  based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through 
the Safety Follow -up Visit, regardless of causality, will be reported by [CONTACT_139409]. In addition, all SAE s that occur after the Safety Follow -up Visit and are 
considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24  hours. 
SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred to as the “SAE Fo rm”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that 
accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_94316](s) and possible etiologies. On the Clinical Trials SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the Vertex Clinical Trials SAE Form.  

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 80 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   investigation, or the scientific quality of the study (i.e., efficacy assessments) will require 
IRB/IEC notification before imple mentation, except where the modification is necessary to 
eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to human subjects. Vertex will submit all protocol modifications to the required regulatory authorities.  
When circumstances require an immediate departure from procedures set forth in the 
protocol, the investigator will contact [CONTACT_139412]. If possible, contact [CONTACT_94321]. Any departures from protocol will be fully documented in the source documentation and in a protocol deviation log.  
13.2.4 Access to Records  
The investigator will make the office and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155410]. The records will also be available for direct inspection, verification, and copying, as required by [CONTACT_774], by [CONTACT_775] (FDA and others). The investigator will comply with applicable privacy and 
security laws for use and disclosure of information related to the research set forth in this protocol.  
13.2.[ADDRESS_388330] names linked to such numbers shall be limited to the site and the study doctor and shall not be disclosed to Vertex. As required by [CONTACT_315461], the investigator will allow Vertex and/or its representatives access to all pertinent medical records to allow for the verification of data gathered in the CRFs/SAE forms and the review of the data collection process. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, including the IRB/IEC, may also request access to all study records, including source documentation, for inspection. 
For sites p articipating in the study in the US, and in accordance with the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act and associated regulations (“HIPAA”), an executed 
HIPAA authorization shall be obtained by [CONTACT_94324] (or the legal representative of the subject) before research activities may begin. Each HIPAA authorization shall comply with all HIPAA requirements including authorization allowing the site access to and use of the subject’s personally identifiable health information, authorization for the site to disclose such information to Vertex, the FDA and other parties requiring access under the Protocol, and statements as to the purpose for which such information may be used and for how long. 
13.2.[ADDRESS_388331] Retention  
The investigator will maintain all study records according to ICH GCP guidelines and/or 
applicable local regulatory requirement(s), whichever is longest, as described in the Clinical Trial Agreement. If the investigator withdraws from the responsibility of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_139359]15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 81 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   records, custody will be transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility and 
Vertex will be notified.  
13.2.7 Study Termination 
At any time, Vertex may terminate this study in its entirety or may terminate this study at any 
particular site. In addition, for reasonable cause, either the investigators or their IRBs/IECs may terminate the study at their center.  
Conditions that may lead to reasonable cause and warrant termination include, but are not 
limited to:  
• Subject or investigator noncompliance 
• Unsatisfactor y subject enrollment 
• Lack of adherence to protocol procedures 
• Lack of evaluable and/or complete data  
• Potentially unacceptable risk to study subjects  
• Decision to modify drug development plan 
• Decision by [CONTACT_315462]. 
13.[ADDRESS_388332] will be entered into a CRF by [CONTACT_94326] a secure, validated web -based electronic data capture (EDC) application. 
Vertex will have read -only access to site- entered clinical data in the EDC application.  
Instances of missing, discrepant, or uninterpretable data will be queried with the investigator for resolution. Any changes to study data will be made to the CRF and documented in an audit trail, which will be maintained within the clinical database.  
13.4 Monitoring  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or approved by [CONTACT_139417]. On- site checking of the CRFs/SAE Forms for completeness 
and clarity, cro ss-checking with source documents, and clarification of administrative matters 
will be performed. 
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_139411]. Monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_49915] a representative of Vertex, or designee (study site monitor), who will review the 

Protocol VX15- 661-113, Version  3.0 Page 82 of 93 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   CRFs/SAE Forms and source documents. The study site monitor will ensure that the 
investigation is conducted according to the protocol design and regulatory requirements. 
13.[ADDRESS_388333]. It is the investigator's 
responsibility to ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject's CRF. Source documentation supporting the CRF data will indicate the subject's participation in the study and will docume nt the dates and details of study 
procedures, AEs, other observations, and subject status. 
The investigator, or designated representative, will complete the CRF as soon as possible 
after information is collected.  
The audit trail entry will show the user's  identification information and the date and time of 
any correction. The investigator will provide formal approval of all the information in the CRFs, including any changes made to the CRFs, to endorse the final submitted data for the subjects for whom the investigator is responsible.  
Vertex will retain the CRF data  and corresponding audit trails. A copy of the final archival 
CRF in the form of a CD or other electronic media will be placed in the investigator's study 
file.

Notes: CFTR mutations that are not likely to respond to VX -661 and/or ivacaftor therapy were defined using 
3 major sources: biological plausibility for the mutation to respond (i.e.,  class), evidence of clinical severity on 
a population basis based on the patient registry CFTR2 (average sweat chloride >86  mmol/L, percentage of 
patients with pancreatic insufficiency [%] is >50%), and in vitro testing (mutations that responded with chloride 
transport <10% of wild -type CFTR were considered minimal function and nonresponsive). The clinical severity 
criteria (average sweat chloride >86  mmol/L, %PI >50%) do not specifically apply to the individual subjects to 
be enrolled in this study, but were used to classify the mutation status.  
a PI [INVESTIGATOR_315432] a residual function mutation, but this mutation is included because of SwCl - 
data and biological rationale, which suggests that this type of mutation should be severe and not responsive.  
b Unpublished data.  
c PI [INVESTIGATOR_315432] a residual function mutation, but this mutation is included because of SwCl - 
 data, low baseline in vitro conductance, and failure for ivacaftor to improve conductance by [CONTACT_2669] 10% 
 over baseline.

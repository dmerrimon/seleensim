Alcon – Business Use Only  5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Rationale and Background  
Refractive surgery using  the Wavelight EX500 excimer laser system is recognized as a  safe 
and effective treatment for hyperopia with or without astigmatism  (El-Naggar 2017 , 
Motwani  2017 , Durrie 2010) . The Wavelight EX500 excimer la ser is approved by [CONTACT_700435]. Although, Japan ’s guideline for refractive surgery allows 
correction for hyperopia with and without astigmatism. The WaveLight EX500 excimer laser 
system has not been approved for hyperopic tr eatment in Japan.  The purpose of this study is 
to collect safety and efficacy data to apply for registration in Japan.  
5.[ADDRESS_950836] efficacy and safety data on the WaveLight EX500 
excimer laser system for the  correction of hyperopia up to +3.0  D of sphere with and without 
astigmatic refractive errors up to +3.[ADDRESS_950837], with a maximum MRSE of 
+3.0 D, to apply for registration in Japan.  
At the end of the study, a clinical study report will be p repared in accordance with applicable 
regulatory requirements and standards.  
There are no immediate plans to submit the results of this postmarket  study for publication; 
however, the results may be offered for publication if they are of scientific interest, or if the 
results relate to a product that is subsequently approved or cleared for marketing.

7.1 Study Design  
This is a prospective, single -arm, multi -center, interventional study with planned bilateral 
LASIK treatment with the WaveLight EX500 excimer laser system for subjects requiring 
refractive c orrection of hyperop ia with or without astigmatism. All treated eyes will be 
targeted for emmetropia. The postoperative state of each treated eye will be compared to the 
preoperative state of the same eye.  
Subjects will be evaluated initially for suitabil ity as candidates for bilateral LASIK. Potential 
subjects willing to participate will be consented and screened. Approximately 30 qualified 
subjects (up to 60 eyes) will receive bilateral LASIK and be followed for [ADDRESS_950839] particip ation is approximately 1 year and includes 9 study visits consisting 
of Screening, Surgery, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 month, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. 
Approximately 4 US study sites will participate in this clinical study. It is estimated that 
enrollment and follow -up of all subjects will take approximately 17 months. Additional 
information on the study population can be found in Section 8.  
Assessments will be obtained at baseline and at appropriate times after LASIK to evaluate the 
safety and effe ctiveness of the treatment . 
 
 Clinical assessments to be obtained at study 
visits a re outlined in Table 3–1 and defined in Section 10 .  
The main analyses for effectiveness will be conducted at refractive stability for the FAS 
(Refractive Stability is defined in Section 12.4).  Subjects are followed for at least 12 months 
(Day 330 to Day 420) for safety and supportive effectiveness assessments. All data analyses 
will be conducted at study completion.  
7.2 Rationale for Study Design  
The prospective , single -group study design, objectiv es, planned visits and assessments, and 
planned analysis at refractive stability are based on recommendations by [CONTACT_454206] Z80.11 -2012  
(R2017) , the FDA  Checklist of Information Usually Submitted in an IDE (1996) , and IS O 
[ZIP_CODE]:2011.  
The study population includ es subjects with hyperopia , with or without astigmatism, based 
on this being a prevalent refractive error for LASIK treatments today and the intended 
population for hyperopic LASIK.

• “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit? ” 
In addition, changes in any protocol -specific parameter s and/or questionnaires evaluated 
during the study are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter or questionnaire response  that is 
clinically relevant, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_66286], is to be reported as an AE. These 
clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality . 
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting  
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent. Any pre -existing medical conditions or 
signs/symptom s present in a subject prior to the start of the study (ie, before informed consent 
is signed) are not considered AEs in the study and should be recorded in the Medical History 
section of the eCRF.  
In addition, dry eye, superficial punctate keratitis, and optical visual disturbances (eg, glare, 
halo, and starburst) are examples of early postoperative findings that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_700426] -refractive surgery. These are not considered AEs if they can be reasonably 
expected to resolve within [ADDRESS_950865]. However, based on the Investigator ’s medical judgment, signs and symptoms of dry 
eye and ocular visual disturbances prior to [ADDRESS_950866] include: date of 
occurrence, severity, treatment (if applicable), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality. In addition, the Investigator mus t document all device deficiencies reported or 
observed with test and control products on the Device Deficiency eCRF. The site must submit 
all available information on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the Study Sponsor 
immediately as follows:  
• ADEs or  SAEs  are documented on the Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device 
Effect eCRF within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awarenes s.

Deficienc y Form. The completed form is emai led to the Study Sponsor at 
[EMAIL_13383]  according to the timelines outlined above; however, the 
reported information must be entered into the EDC system once it becomes 
operational.  
Any AEs and device deficiencies for non -study market ed devices/p roducts (eg, FS200, 
Custom Paks) will be considered and processed as spontaneous (following the postmarket 
vigilance procedures) and should be  communicated to the device ’s/product ’s manufacturer  as 
per local requirements.

Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency being reported, the Study 
Sponsor may req uest copi[INVESTIGATOR_13271] ’s medical records. The 
Investiga tor must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory authorities or IRB/IEC.  
Intensity and Causality  Assessments  
Where appropriate, the Investigator must assess the intensity (severi ty) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:

Approved Date: 26 Mar 2021  Page 54 of 67 
 
Alcon – Business Use Only  Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign or 
symptom.  
Moderate  An AE is moderate if the sig n or symptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitati ng and results in the 
subject ’s inability to work or engage in their usual activities.  
For every AE in the study, the Investigator must assess the causality (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study procedure). An assessment of causality will also be performed 
by [CONTACT_271456], as shown below:  
Causality  
Related  An AE classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly related 
where a direct cause and effect relationship with the medical device or st udy 
procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility that 
the AE was caused by [CONTACT_443411].  
Not Related  An AE classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or simply 
unlikely to be related  (ie, there are other more likely causes for the AE).  
The Study Sponsor will assess the AEs and may upgrade the Investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality. The Study Sponsor will notify the Investigator of any AEs that is 
upgraded from non -serious to serious or from unrelated to related.  
Furthermore,  the Study Sponsor shall promptly conduct an evaluation of any unanticipated 
adverse device effect, including anticipated adverse events that occur in unanticipated 
severity or frequency. The resu lts of this evaluation will be reported to the FDA, the IRB, and 
participating Investigators within [ADDRESS_950867].

1-month interval,  when all of the following recommended criteria are met:  
• At least 95% of the treated eyes have a change ≤ 1.00 D of MRSE between the 
2 refractions;  
• The mean rate of change in MRSE, as determined by a paired analysis, is ≤ 0.5 D per 
year (0.04 D/month) over  the same time period;  
• The mean rate of change of MRSE decreases monotonically over time, with a 
projected asymptote of zero or a rate of change attributable to normal aging;  
• The 95% confidence interval for the mean rate of change in MRSE includes zero or a 
rate of change attributable to normal aging; and  
• Stability is confirmed at least 3 months after the stability time point by a statistically 
adequate subgroup  .

course of the study. In particular, the Investigator must keep an enrollment log with 
confidential identifyin g information that corresponds to the subject numbers and initials of 
each study participant. At the end of the clinical study, the Study Sponsor will collect a copy 
of the enrollment log without any identifying subject information . All documents submitted  
to the Study Sponsor will identify the subjects exclusively by [CONTACT_69213]. No other personally identifying information will be transmitted to the Study 
Sponsor.  
The Study Sponsor may release anonymized study data to external resear chers for purposes 
of future research directly related to the study objectives, or future research that is beyond the 
scope of the current study objectives. The Informed Consent Form explains this to study 
subjects. Anonymization means that all identifiabl e information will be removed from the 
dataset and all links to the subjects in the study will be removed. Anonymization of the data 
will maintain confidentiality of the subjects who participate in the study so that they cannot 
be identified by [CONTACT_700445]. The anonymized data set will contain records from all 
of the subjects in the current study, but the anonymization process might change the data set 
in some ways, so external researchers will be informed that they might not be able to 
duplicate s ome o f the results from this study.

 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Study Title:   Phase II prospective evaluation of bone remodeling during Ixazomib treatment 
in relapsed/refractory MM patients.  
Phase:   2 
Number of Patients:   20 
Study Objectives  
Primary  
 To evaluate the effect of ixazomib on inducing osteoblast activation as 
measur ed by [CONTACT_631024]/refractory 
myeloma  
Secondary  
 To evaluate the association between osteoblastic activation and myeloma 
response to ixazomib  
 To identify predictive factors for ixazomib -associated osteoblastic activation  
Overview of Study Design:    
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal disease of plasma cells that is characterized by [CONTACT_631025] (and other organs) and sometimes results 
in bone marrow failure, bone destruction , hypercalcemia, and renal failure.  It constitutes 
approximately 1% of all reported neoplasms and approximately 13% of hematologic 
cancers worldwide.  Bone disease is extremely common at myeloma diagnosis.   It is 
present in the majority of patients and i s associated with bone pain, fractures, spi[INVESTIGATOR_6710], and hypercalcemia.   Bone disease in myeloma results from the activation of 
osteoclast and suppression of osteoblast activity in the myelomatous bone marrow.   As 
treatment and survival of myeloma patients improve, new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_631009] y needed.  The p roteasome inhibitor , Bortezomib (VELCADE) has  
been shown to produce an anabolic bone effect (increase ALP, bone ALP, osteocalcin) in 
relapsed/refractory patients.  This study will examine the bone anabolic effect in patients 
with relapsed/r efractory myeloma  with the  next generation proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib , 
treatment (4mg day 1, 8,  15, 22 Q 28 days cycle x  6 cycles).  
Study Population:   Adult patients with confirmed diagnosis of relapse d/refractory multiple 
myeloma . 
Duration of Study:   2 years

 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1. Scientific Background  
1.1.1.  Multiple Myeloma  
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal disease of plasma cells that is characterized by [CONTACT_631025] (and other organs) and sometimes results in 
bone marrow failure, bone destruction, hypercalcemia, and renal failure.  It constitutes  
approximately 1% of all reported neoplasms and approximately 13% of hematologic cancers 
worldwide.(1)   In the Americas, Canada, and Western European countries, approximately 5 
to 7 new cases of MM are diagnosed per 100,000 people each year(1, 2, 3) .  Although less 
common in Asian countries, MM is a growing health problem with an incidence that is 
approaching w estern countries and a larger population base.(4, 5)   In the [LOCATION_002], 
approximately 20,000 cases of MM are diagnosed each year and 10,650 deaths per year are 
due to the disease (approximately 2% of all cancer deaths).  
 
MM is sensitive to many cytoto xic drugs including alkylating agents, anthracyclines, and 
corticosteroids for both initial treatment and relapsed disease.  Over the past decade, 
significant achievements have been made in expanding treatment options for MM with novel 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_631011], Bortezomib (VELCADE) , and lenalidomide.  These regimens 
have  extended progression -free survival (PFS) and/or time -to-progression (TTP)(6, 7, 8, 9, 
10).  The introduction of novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_631012] -dose therapy 
significantly  improved overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma who were 
eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)  (11, 12) .  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_78930], the disease remains incurable and 
there is a need for ne w and better agents.  Patients who relapse after their initial therapy 
demonstrate variable response to subsequent treatments with decreasing likelihood and 
duration of response (DOR).  Patients ultimately become refractory to approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_631013] n o alternative treatment option s.  In an effort to further target the proteasome with 
improved activity  in MM  and other cancers, Millennium has developed ixazomib, a small 
molecule 20S  proteasome inhibitor.  
 
1.1.2.  Bone Disease in Multiple Myeloma  
Bone disease is extremely common at myeloma diagnosi s (13).   It is present in the majority of 
patients and is associated with bone pain, fractures, spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377], and 
hypercalcemia (1 4, 15).  The pathogenesis of lytic bone disease in myeloma is complex and is 
associated with increased osteoclast activity through multiple interactions between myeloma 
cells and the bone marrow microenvironment, impairing osteoblast function which results in 
decreasing bone formation ( 13-15).   
 
1.1.3.  Bortezomib and MM Bone Disease  
The p roteasome inhibitor Bortezomib  (VELCADE) has been shown through numerous clinical 
and preclinical studies to have an impact on bone health, density, and on the biomarkers related 
to osteoblast and osteoclast activity .  Evidence indicates that Bortezomib demonstrates a bone 
anabolic effect  as shown in Table 1 (16).

PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_631006], MD   UARK [ADDRESS_841953] of bortezomib on bone health, including fewer bone disease -related MM 
progression events, increases in bone volume, and improvements in osteolytic lesions. Alkaline 
phosphatase (total and bone isoenzyme), a marker of bone formation, is in creased during 
bortezomib treatment; the degree of increase may be associated with treatment response. 
Bortezomib is also related to  a reduction in Dickkopf -1, an inhibitor of osteoblast function. 
Increases of other bone -formation markers and decreases of bone -resorption markers, have 
also been seen . These clinical effects are supported by [CONTACT_631027]/activity, arising from 
direct effects of bortezomib and pro teasome inhibition. Thus, e vidence indicates that bortezomib 
exerts a positive effect on bone metabolism in MM and has a bone anabolic effect  (16). 
 
1.1.4.  Ixazomib (MLN9708)  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Preclinical Experience  
Please refer to the current ixazomib Investigator’s Brochure (IB)  and Safety 
Management Attachment (SMA).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical Experience  
Ixazomib has been evaluated as an oral single agent in phase [ADDRESS_841954] 
included patients with advanced solid tumors, lymphoma, relapse d/refractory MM 
(RRMM), and relapsed or refractory light-chain (AL) amyloidosis and demonstrated early 
signs of activity. Ongoing studies continue to investigate both single -agent ixazomib and 
ixazomib in combination with standard treatments. Based on encouraging preliminary 
data observed in patients with MM requiring systemic treatment, 2 phase 3 trials in newly 
diagnosed MM (NDMM) (C16014) and RRMM (C16010) patient populations are 
currently evaluating ixazomib in combination with Revlimid and Dexamethasone 
(RevDex) versus placebo/RevDex. Both trials are c ombining ixazomib at a weekly dose 
of 4.[ADDRESS_841955] of food, and oral bioavailability. Studies evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetic 
(PK) of ixazomib alone (in Japanese patients) and in combination with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone in Asian adult patients (incl uding Japanese patients) with a diagnosis of 
NDMM are ongoing.  
 
As of 27 March 2013, preliminary clinical data is available for a total of 653 patients 
across 13 studies. The emerging safety profile indicates that ixazomib is generally well 
tolerated. The adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the class -based effects of 
proteasome inhibition and are similar to what has been previously reported with 
VELCADE though the severity of some, for example peripheral neuropathy, is less. 
While some of these potenti al toxicities may be severe, they can be managed by [CONTACT_128734], or, as needed, dose modification or 
discontinuation.  
 
Fatigue was the most common AE reported among 384 patients treated in the oral (PO) 
studies (47 %). Other common AEs reported in the pooled intravenous (IV) and PO 
safety populations include nausea, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and vomiting. Rash is 
also a commonly reported treatment -emergent event; however, there is some variety in 
its characterizati on and causality resulting in different preferred terms to describe it. A 
high-level term outline of rash events includes rashes, eruptions and exanthems NEC; 
pruritus NEC; erythemas; papulosquamous conditions; and exfoliative conditions. The 
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_631006], MD   UARK [ADDRESS_841956] now completed enrollment, 
and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were the common dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) 
when the use of prophylactic anti -emetics was not permitted per protocol. In the 
expansion cohorts  or phase 2 cohorts (as per each study), the incidence and severity of 
GI symptoms was mitigated by [CONTACT_20549] 
(MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) (as per each study) and standard clinical 
usage of anti -emetics and/or ant idiarrheal medications as deemed appropriate. 
Prophylactic use of anti -emetics has not been required as with other agents but (as 
outlined in Section 6.7) has been used according to standard practice and are effective.  
 
The most frequent (at least 20%) tre atment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported 
with the PO formulation pooled from single -agent studies (n = 201) irrespective of 
causality to ixazomib, include nausea (53%), fatigue (51%), diarrhea (44%), 
thrombocytopenia (34%), vomiting (38%), decreased  appetite (32%), fever (21%), and 
anemia (21%). The most frequent (at least 20%) TEAEs reported with the PO 
formulation pooled from combination trials (irrespective of the combination) (n = 173), 
irrespective of causality to ixazomib, include diarrhea (47% ), fatigue (44%), nausea 
(38%), peripheral edema (35%), constipation (33%), insomnia (29%), thrombocytopenia 
(28%), anemia (26%), vomiting (26%), neutropenia (25%), back pain (24%), pyrexia 
(23%), peripheral edema (21%, each), fever (20%), cough (20%), hyp okalemia (20%), 
neutropenia (20%), and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (20%). Overall rash of all grades 
is reported in approximately 50% of patients and is more common when ixazomib is 
given in combination with lenalidomide where rash is an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_5171].  
 
Additional detailed information regarding the clinical experience of ixazomib may be 
found in the Investigator’s Brochure,  including information on the IV formulation.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
Clinical IV and PO pharmacokinetic (PK) data show that ixazomib citrate (measured as 
the biologically active boronic acid form of ixazomib [MLN2238]) has multi -exponential 
disposition with a rapid initial phase that is largely over by [ADDRESS_841957] maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of 
approximately 0.5 to 2.0 hours and terminal t1/2 after multiple dosing of approximately 5 
to 7 days (14).  Results of a population PK analysis (N = 137) show that there is no 
relationship between body s urface area (BSA) or body weight and clearance (CL).  Also, 
based on stochastic simulations for fixed dose, exposures are independent of the 
individual patient’s BSA  (15).  Based on these data, a recommendation was made for 
fixed dosing in clinical trials.  An absolute bioavailability of 67% was determined for 
ixazomib using the population PK analysis. Please refer to the current ixazomib IB and 
Safety Management Attachment (SMA) for information on the PK for IV doses of 
ixazomib.  
 
Metabolism appears to be t he major route of elimination for ixazomib, and urinary 
excretion of the parent drug is negligible (< 5% of dose). In vitro studies indicate that 
ixazomib is metabolized by [CONTACT_20550] P450s (CYPs) and non -CYP 
enzymes/proteins. The rank order of re lative biotransformation activity of the 5 major 
human CYP isozymes was 3A4 (34.2%) > 1A2 (30.7%) > 2D6 (14.7%) > 2C9 (12.1%) > 
2C19 (< 1%). Ixazomib is not an inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 nor a 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5. The po tential for ixazomib treatment to produce 
drug-drug interactions (DDIs) via CYP inhibition is inferred to be low. However, there 
may be a potential for DDIs with a concomitant strong CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 inhibitor or 
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_631006], MD   UARK [ADDRESS_841958] -pass metabolism when ixazomib is administered 
via the PO route and because of the moderate contribution of CYP3A4 - and CYP1A2 -
mediated metabolism of ixazomib in human liver microsomes. Ixazomib may be a weak 
substrate of P -glycoprotein (Pgp), breast cancer  resistance protein (BCRP), and 
multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP2) efflux pump transporters. Ixazomib is 
not an inhibitor of Pgp, BCRP, and MRP2. The potential for DDIs with substrates or 
inhibitors of Pgp, BCRP, and MRP2 is, therefore, inferre d to be low. Clinical Study 
C16009 (Arm 1) with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, showed a 2 -fold increase 
in area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) in the presence of 
ketoconazole. This resulted in the continued exclusion of st rong CYP3A4 inhibitors in 
ongoing/planned clinical studies.  
 
Further details on these studies are provided in the IB. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical Trial Experience Using Oral Ixazomib  
As of 27 March 2013, a total of 507 patients with differing malignancies (multiple 
myeloma,  AL amyloidosis, non -hematologic cancers, and lymphoma) have been treated 
in studies evaluating the oral ixazomib formulation.  These patients have been treated 
with different doses of ixazomib either as a single -agent treatment (in 201 patients) or in 
combination with currently clinically available treatments (in 306 patients).  Information

[IP_ADDRESS].  Overview of the Oral Formulation of Ixazomib  
The emerging safety profile indicates that oral ixazomib is generally well tolerated. The 
adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the class -based effects of proteasome 
inhibition and are similar to what has been previously  reported with VELCADE though 
the severity of some, for example peripheral neuropathy, is less.  While some of these 
potential toxicities may be severe, they can be managed by [CONTACT_631028], or, as needed, dose modif ication or discontinuation.    
 
In the 4 ongoing studies (C16003, C16004, C16007, and C16009) investigating single -
agent oral ixazomib in patients with differing malignancies (multiple myeloma, AL 
amyloidosis, nonhematologic cancers, and lymphoma), a total  of [ADDRESS_841959] frequent (at least 10%) 
AEs occurring in the pooled safety population from sin gle-agent oral ixazomib Studies 
(C16003, C16004, C16007, and C16009) is shown in Table 3.

a Note that rash maculopapular and rash macular represent the [ADDRESS_841963] a 50% reduction in disease burden in some patients and 
prolonged disease stabilization in others across all ongoing trials. The antitumor activity 
has been seen with single -agent ixazomib, when combined with established th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
and across the malignancies studied (advanced solid tumors ) (17), non -Hodgkin’s 
disease, Hodgkin’s disease ( 18), relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma 
[RRMM]( 19) relapsed or refractory systemic light chain amyloidosis [RRAL]; ( 20), and 
newly  diagnosed multiple myeloma [NDMM]; (21 -24) to date.  
 
Though additional data are needed to characterize the clinical benefit of this drug, the 
emerging data supports the ongoing development of ixazomib.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma  
 
The earl y development of ixazomib  in patients with RRMM involves 2 studies (C16003 
and C16004) with similar objectives, but each investigated [ADDRESS_841964] -in-class proteasome inhibitor, VELCADE.  Study C16003 is 
an open -label, dose escalation, phase 1 study of ixazomib  dosing on a twice -weekly 
schedule on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21 -day cycle in adult patients with RRMM. (2 5)  
Study C16004 is an open -label, dose escalation, phase 1 study of ixazomib  dosing on a 
weekly sch edule on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -day cycle in adults patients with RRMM  
(26, 27).  Both studies have now completed enrollment.  The DLTs in Study C16003  
were rash macular and thrombocytopenia and the DLTs in C16004 were nausea, 
diarrhea, vomiting, and erythema multiforme.  
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_631006], MD   UARK [ADDRESS_841965] included bortezomib, 
thalidomide (or lenalidomide), and corticosteroids.  In both studies, when the MTD was 
established, cohorts of patients representing the heterogeneous patient population 
currently seen in clinical practice were t o be enrolled into [ADDRESS_841966] that 
ixazomib has anti -tumor activity in heavily pretreated MM patients, with durable 
responses/disease control, and is generally well tolerated. Please refer to the ixazomib 
IB and SMA  for further information.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (NDMM)  
Multiple research paths are being explored in patients with NDMM with a focus on 
evaluating ixazomib in combination with agents commonly used across treatment 
settings.  The development of ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide with 
dexamethasone (LenDex ) in patients with NDMM who are transplant eligible or ineligible 
involves 2 studies (C16005 and C16008) with similar study designs except for a few key 
differences, namely the schedules of ixazomib and dexamethasone  .  Ixazomib is also 
being evaluated in combination with melphalan and prednisone (MP) for patients who 
are not transplant eligible due to age or coexisting morbidity (in Study C16006) .  
 
All 3 studies are phase 1/2, with phase 1 focusing on safety and phase 2 on efficacy 
(and further characteri zation of safety).  Please refer to the ixazomib IB and SMA for 
further information.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical Trial Experience Using IV Ixazomib  
See the  IB for descriptions of the 2 studies that investigated IV ixazomib in advanced 
solid tumors and advanced lymphoma (Studies C16001 and C16002, respectively).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Preclinical Activity of Oral Ixazomib in Myeloma Bone Disease  
Ixazomib has demonstrated both pre clinical and clinical activity .  Gomez et al 
investigated its bone anabolic and antiresporptive effects in myeloma and in comparison 
with Bortezomib (VELCADE ) in preclinical models.  Clinically achievable concentrations 
of Ixazomib markedly  inhibited osteoclast  formation and resorption in ex vivo 
experiments, as well as promoted osteoblast differentiation and function (even in 
osteoprogenitor cells from MM patients with osteolytic lesions).   In a mouse model, 
Ixazomib was found to be at least as effective as in traperitoneally administered 
Bortezomib in the control of myeloma growth and in the prevention of bone loss  (28).   
1.2. Study Rationale  
Bortezomib has been shown to produce on anabolic bone effect in relapse d/refractory MM patients  . 
The next generati on proteasome inhibitor, Ixazomib , has been evaluated in a pre -clinical setting  and 
has demonstrated to be as equally effective to Bortezomib in both controlling tumor burden and 
providing a significant benefit in associated bone disease (as sustained by [CONTACT_631029]  (28).  
Consequently , it is conceivable that this agent may achieve bone beneficial effects in addition to its 
anti-myeloma activity in multiple myeloma patients.    Therefore, this study is designed to  focus on the 
bone anabolic effect of Ixazomib ( MLN 9708 ) on MM patients , with the  primary objective of determining  
the effect of a short course of ixazomib (6 cycles) on changes in bone on formation markers (BALP ,

 osteocalcin) and bone densitometry (Dexa scan) indicies.  The dose of ixazomib will be given as 4mg 
weekly in a 28 day cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles.   
1.3. Potential Risks and Benefits  
Please refer to the current ixazomib Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and Safety Management Attachment 
(SMA ). 
Risks of  study drug:  
Blood and lymphatic system disorders:  Lymphopenia. Reductions in blood  counts may predispose 
patients to an increased susceptibility to infection (see  Infections and infestations below). A rare risk is 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic  purpura, a ra re blood disorder where blood clots form in small blood 
vessels  throughout the body, characterized by [CONTACT_12703], petechiae, fever, and  possibly more 
serious signs and symptoms. Reticulocytopenia was described in  animals and may be associated with 
anemia. These potential risks should be  managed according to standard medical practice.   
Gastrointestinal disorders:  Intestinal obstruction including ileus and  intussusception (described in 
animal studies), abdominal pain.  
General disorders and administration site conditions:  Chills, influenza like  illness.   
Infections and infestations:  Pneumonia. Lymphopenia may be associated with  increased risk of 
infection, including re -activation of herpes zoster. Antiviral therapy  may be initiated as clinica lly 
indicated.  
Investigations:  Blood creatinine increased (see Renal and urinary disorders below).  
Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Dehydration, electrolyte imbalance.  
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:  Back pain, myalgia, arthralgia,  bone  pain, pain in 
extremity.  
Nervous system disorders:  Headache, syncope. In addition, autonomic and motor  neuropathy may 
be observed, as both have been reported for VELCADE, another  proteasome inhibitor. Posterior 
reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) ha s been reported with ixazomib . PRES has also been 
reported for VELCADE (refer to  VELCADE for Injection Package Insert)  and Kyprolis .(10) Transverse 
myelitis has also been  reported with ixazomib . It is not known if ixazomib  causes transverse myelitis;  
however, because it happened to a patient receiving ixazomib  , the possibility that  ixazomib  may have 
contributed to transverse myelitis cannot be excluded.   
Renal and urinary disorders:  Renal impairment, renal failures, and renal failure  acute have been 
reported in association with dehydration due to nausea, vomiting,  anorexia, and/or diarrhea, the use of 
nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs  (NSAIDs), and/or disease progression. In one situation, this has 
been severe,  requiring temporary dialysis.  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_83731], thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Dyspnoea, cough, upper  respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], 
pneumonitis.  
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:  A rare risk is Stevens -Johnson syndrome,  a severe, life -
threatening or deadly rash with skin peeling and mouth  sores, which  should be managed 
symptomatically according to standard medical practice.  Stevens -Johnson syndrome has also been 
reported for VELCADE (refer to  VELCADE for Injection Package Insert(10)). It is also reported as risk 
with lenalidomide, an agent  used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies including  in combination 
with proteasome inhibitors. For more information about this risk  with lenalidomide, refer to the Revlimid 
(lenalidomide) Package Insert.(11)  
Vascular disorders:  Hypotension, orthos tatic hypotension.  
Other:  Acute phase response that may result in fever and metabolic changes  (observed only in 
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_631006], MD   UARK 2014 -14

 nonclinical studies). Infrequent incidences of tumor lysis  syndrome have also been reported.  
Potential Benefits:  
The clinical benefit of ixazomib continues to be studied in a comprehensive and global development 
plan that involves studies sponsored by [CONTACT_20555].  Ixazomib appears to show early signs of anti -
tumor activity as evidenced by [CONTACT_2669] 50% reduction in disease burden in some pat ients, including 
patients that have been heavily pretreated as well as those with newly diagnosed MM, and prolongs 
stabilization of the underlying disease in other patients across all ongoing trials.  The preliminary 
findings are favorable when considering  historical and currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_631014].  Though additional data are needed to characterize the clinical benefit of this 
drug, the emerging data supports expanded development of ixazomib for the treatment of pati ents with 
advanced malignancy.This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, good clinical 
practice (GCP), applicable regulatory requirements, and International Con ference on Harmonisation 
(ICH).  
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES

The primary endpoint of this study is change in  serum osteocalcin from baseline to  study exit.   
3.2. Secondary  Endpoint  
The secondary endpoint s of this study  include change in serum osteocalcin  and other serum bone 
markers ( BALP, NTX, Vitamin D25 ) at each study visit, including the exit visit; change in bone marrow 
parameters (immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics, and flow cytometry)  and Dexascan T scores 
from baseline to end of study; and association between bone marker and radiological changes and anti-
myeloma activity in response to Ixazomib therapy.  
  
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_631006], MD   UARK [ADDRESS_841967]  of the next generation 
proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib,  in relapsed/refractory myeloma patients .   Treatment consists of 
ixazomib  4 mg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 of a 28 -day cycle , for a maximum of  6 cycles).  
General eligibility criteria may be assessed prior to the formal Screening period if it is part of standard 
clinical practice.  However, per  the Schedule of Events, formal screening will occur during the 
Screening period, which may last for up to 35 days prior to initiating study treatment . Determination of 
relapsed/refractory disease  as an entry criterion may be based on patient data obtained  during or 
following the patient’s most recent prior antineoplastic therapy.   
Study  drug (ixazomib  4.0 mg) will be given  on Days 1, 8 , 15, 22 of a 28 - day cycle for a maximum of 6 
cycles.  Dose modifications  may be made based on toxicities during treatment.   Patients will be 
discontinued from the study for progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.   
Treatment periods will be defined as 28 -day cycles.  Patients will be seen once per treatment cycle 
(Day 1) during  their participation in the active treatment  of the study.   More frequent follow -up would be 
only as clinically indicated  at the discretion of the treating physicia n. 
Patients will be assessed for disease response and progression.  Response will be assesse d according 
to the International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) criteria (see APPENDIX  A) for all patients every 
4 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles (unless  disease progression  or unacceptable toxicity) .   
ECOG performance score  (APPENDIX B) , adverse events ( AEs), laboratory values, and vital sign 
measurements will be collected and assessed throughout the study.  Toxicity will be evaluated 
according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), 
version 4.03, effective  date 14 June 2010.  
Patients will attend an End of Treatment (EOT) visit after completion of their 6 cycles (or at study 
discontinuation due to progressive disease , unacceptable toxicity , or other reason ) and will continue to 
be followed for survival.   
4.2. Number  of Patients  
[ADDRESS_841968] patient enrolled.

6. TREATMENT  PLAN  
All baseline assessments,  labs, and bone marrow biopsies are to be completed within 35 d ays of 
enrollment .  Radiological studies are to be completed within 60 days prior to enrollment.   
Study drug (ixazomib 4.0 mg) will be given on Days 1, 8, 15, [ADDRESS_841973] meet the following criteria:  
 ANC must be ≥ 1,000/mm3. 
 Platelet count must be ≥ 75,000/mm3. 
 All other non -hematologic toxicit ies should, at the investigator’s discretion, generally be 
recovered to patient’s baseline condition or Grade 1 or lower . 
Dose modifications may be made based on toxicities during treatment described in detail in section 8. 2.3.  
Treatment periods will be defined as 28 -day cycles.  Patients will be seen in clinic once per treatment 
cycle  (Day 1)  during  their participation in the active treatment of the study.   More frequent follow -up would 
be only as clinically indicated  at the discr etion of the treating physician . 
Patients will be assessed for disease response and progression.  Response will be assesse d according to 
the IMWG criteria (see APPENDIX  A) for all patients every 4 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles (unless 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity).   
Patients will attend an End of Treatment (EOT) visit after completion of their 6 cycles (or  at study 
discontinuation due to progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason) and will continue to be 
followed for survival .  Follow -up for survival after end of treatment will be limited to contact [CONTACT_631032] v erify the patient’s disposition.  Verification of the patient’s disposition may be 
performed by [CONTACT_631033] 3 months of the 
scheduled follow -up interval.  
6.1. Physical assessments  
Physical Assessments include History and Physical (H&P), which includes a detailed medical and 
treatment history, vital signs, weight, height, and BSA, and performance evaluation (ECOG) as seen in 
Appendix B. H&P and performance evaluation will be performe d at all visits. Toxicities will be evaluated 
according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), 
version 4.0, effective date 14 June 2010 starting with cycle 1.    
6.2. Laboratory  tests  
Laboratory tests  (CBC with differential, BMP, LFTs, Uric Acid, Albumin, CRP , Pregnancy Test 
(WOCBP) ), bone marker  tests ( BALP, Osteocalcin, NTX, Vitamin D 25 ), and m yeloma   lab tests 
(Serum Protein Electrophoresis, Serum Quantitative Immunoglobulins, Serum Free Light Chains, 
Serum IFE and/or Urine Beta -2-Microglobulin ) will be performed at baseline , on day 1 of cycle s 2-6, 
and at end of study . BNP and TSH will be performed at baseline and end of study only.  
6.3. Bone Marrow Tests

 Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_631017] g ene expression profiling (GEP) are optional and will be 
performed in subjects providing informed consent.  Based on the requirement of obtaining at least 3 
million plasma cells, approximately 50 ccs of bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_579929] a  EDTA syringe 
and sent to the Myeloma Institute Research lab for gene array studies.  If there are insufficient plasma 
cells in the  sample to perform gene array, an additional bone marrow pull and bone marrow biopsy may 
be requested.  The sample should be clearly labeled “for separation for GEP  for UARK 2014 -14”. 
6.4. Radio -Imaging  
The bone densitometry scan (Dexascan)  and skeletal survey will be performed at baseline and at end 
of study.

8. STUDY  DRUG  
8.1. Description of Investigational Agent  
The ixazomib drug product is provided in strengths of 4.0, 3.0, and 2.3  mg capsul es as the active 
boronic acid. The different dose strengths are differentiated by [CONTACT_631034]:

4.[ADDRESS_841974] be met and documented before 
drug administration.  Study drug will be administered or di spensed only to eligible patients under 
the supervision of the investigator or identified sub -investigator(s).  Patients should be 
monitored for toxicity, as necessary, and doses of ixazomib should be modified as needed to 
accommodate patient tolerance to treatment; this may include symptomatic treatment, dose 
interruptions, and adjustments of ixaz omib dose (see Section on 8.2.3 for dose modifications ). 
Capsules of ixazomib will also be referred to as study drug.  Study drug will be supplied by 
[CONTACT_20552] 4.0, 3.0, and 2.3 mg ixazomib.  
The prescribed administration of ixazomib doses in this study is 4.0mg ixazomib weekly in a 28 
day cycle.  
Patients should be instructed to swallow ixazomib capsules whole, with water, and not to break, 
chew, or open the capsules.  Study drug should be taken on an empty stomach (no food or 
drink) at lea st 1 hour before or 2  hours after a meal.  Each capsule should be swallowed 
separately with a sip of water.  A total of approximately 8 ounces (240 mL) of water should be 
taken with the capsules.   
Missed doses can be taken as soon as the patient remembers  if the next scheduled dose is 
[ADDRESS_841975].  A double dose should not be taken to make up for a missed dose.  If 
the patient vomits after taking a dose, the patient should not repeat the dose but should resume 
dosing at the time of the next sched uled dose.  
8.2.2.  Ixazomib Destruction

Treatment Assoc.Toxicity  
Treatment with ixazomib will use a cycle length of [ADDRESS_841976] meet the fol lowing criteria:  
 
 ANC must be ≥ 1,000/mm3. 
 Platelet count must be ≥ 75,000/mm3. 
 All other non -hematologic toxicit ies should, at the physician’s discretion, generally be 
recovered to patient’s baseline condition or Grade [ADDRESS_841977] been met. If the patient continues to fail  to 
meet the above -cited criteria, delay therapy and continue to re - evaluate. The maximum 
delay before treatment is discontinued is 3 weeks.

 [IP_ADDRESS].  Excluded Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
The following medications and procedures are prohibited during the study:  
 Systemic treatment with any of the following metabolizing enzyme inhibitors is not 
permitted during this study.  A DDI with a strong inhibitor would increase MLN2238 
exposure.  
 Strong inhibitors of CYP1A2:  fluvoxamine, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin  
 Strong inhibitors of CYP3A:  clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, 
voriconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone,  and posaconazole  
 Systemic treatment with any of the following metabolizing enzyme inducers should be 
avoided unless there is no appropriate alternative medication for the patient to use.  A 
DDI with a strong inducer would decrease MLN2238 exposure.  
 Strong  CYP3A inducers:  rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
phenytoin, and phenobarbital  
 The dietary supplements St John’s wort and Ginkgo biloba are not permitted.  
 Additional treatment or procedures  prohibited during the study:  
 Adjuvant hormone th erapy for breast or prostate cancer.  
 Bisphosphonates: Concomitant treatment with bisphosphonates will not be 
permitted.  
 Any antineoplastic treatment with activity against MM except for drugs in this 
treatment regimen.  
 Radiation therapy (the requirement for  local radiation therapy generally indicates 
disease progression).  
 Platelet transfusions to help patients meet eligibility criteria are not allowed within 
3 days before study drug dosing.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Permitted Concomitant Medi cations and Procedures  
The following medications and procedures are permitted during the study:  
 Antiemetics, including 5 -HT3 serotonin receptor antagonists, may be used at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
 Loperamide or other antidiarrheal should be used for symptomatic diarrhea at discreti on 
of the investigator. The dose and regimen will be according to institutional guidelines. 
IVF should be given to prevent volume depletion.  
 Growth factors (eg, granulocyte colony stimulating factor [G -CSF], granulocyte 
macrophage -colony stimulating factor  [GM-CSF], recombinant erythropoietin) are 
permitted. Their use should follow published guidelines and/or institutional practice; 
however, alternative usage may be reviewed with the Millennium Clinical or Medical

 Representative . Erythropoietin will be all owed in this study. Their use should follow 
published guidelines and/or institutional practice.  
 Patients should be transfused with red cells and platelets as clinically indicated (except 
as noted in 8.2.4) and according to institutional guidelines.  
 Antivir al therapy such as acyclovir may be administered if medically appropriate.  
 Patients who experience worsening neuropathy from baseline may be observed for 
recovery, and have dose reductions/delays as indicated in the protocol, and any 
supportive therapy or intervention may be initiated as appropriate at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
 Supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care may be given throughout the 
study.  
8.2.4.  Preca utions and Restrictions  
Fluid deficits should be corrected before and thro ughout treatment.  
Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) induced prevalence of nephrotoxicity is 
relatively low; however, given the wide use of these agents many persons are at risk, including 
for example, patients with cardio -renal disease, dehydra tion, and the aging kidney. NSAIDs 
should be avoided with impaired renal function given reported NSAID -induced renal failure in 
patients with decreased renal function.  
Pregnancy  
It is not known what effects ixazomib has on human pregnancy or development of the embryo or 
fetus.  Therefore, female patients participating in this study should avoid becoming pregnant, 
and male patients should avoid impregnating a female partner.  Nonsterilized female patients of 
reproductive age group and male patients should use effective methods of contraception 
through defined periods during and after study treatment as specified below.  
Female patients must meet 1 of the following criteria:  
 Postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR  
 Surgically sterile , OR 
 If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice [ADDRESS_841981] dose of study drug, AND  
 Agree to practice true abstinenc e when this is in line with the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the subject.  (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.)  
Male patients, even if surgica lly sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), must agree to 1 of the 
following:

  Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment 
period and through [ADDRESS_841982] dose of study drug, OR  
 Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the subject.  (Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.)  
8.2.5.  Management of Clinica l Events  
Adverse drug reactions such as thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and 
rash have been associated with ixazomib treatment. Management guidelines regarding these 
events are outlined below. Further details of management of ixazomi b AEs are described in 
Section 6 of the ixazomib IB.  
Transverse Myelitis  
Transverse myelitis has also been reported with ixazomib. It is not known if ixazomib causes 
transverse myelitis; however, because it happened to a patient receiving ixazomib, the 
possibility that ixazomib may have contributed to transverse myelitis cannot be excluded.  
Prophylaxis Against Risk of Infection  
If lymphopenia is noted, patients may be at an increased risk of infection.  In particular, 
lymphopenia can be associated with reac tivation of herpes zoster and herpes simplex viruses.  
Antiviral therapy such as acyclovir or valacyclovir may be initiated as clinically indicated.  Other 
antivirals are also acceptable.  
Nausea and/or Vomiting  
Standard anti -emetics, including 5 -HT 3 antagonists, are recommended for emesis occurring 
upon treatment initiation; prophylactic anti -emetics may also be considered.  Dexamethasone 
should not be administered as an anti -emetic.  Fluid deficits should be corrected before initiation 
of study drug  and during treatment . 
Diarrhea  
Diarrhea should be managed according to clinical practice, including the administration of 
antidiarrheals once infectious causes are excluded.  Fluid intake should be maintained to avoid 
dehydration.  Fluid deficits should b e corrected before initiation of treatment and during 
treatment. Prophylactic antidiarrheals are not generally recommended.  
Erythematous Rash With or Without Pruritus  
As with bortezomib, rash with or without pruritus has been reported with ixazomib, primar ily at 
the higher doses tested and when given with agents where rash is an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_5171].  The 
rash may range from limited erythematous areas, macular and/or small papular bumps that may 
or may not be pruritic over a few areas of the body, to a more  generalized eruption that is 
predominately on the trunk or extremities.  Rash has been most commonly characterized as 
maculopapular or macular.  To date, when it does occur, rash is most commonly reported within 
the first 3 cycles of therapy.  The rash is  often transient, self -limiting, and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_20539] 1 to 
2 in severity.  
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_631006], MD   UARK 2014 -14 
Clinical Study Protocol X16013   v5, May 15 , 2017    
 
Page 33 of 50 
 Symptomatic measures such as antihistamines or corticosteroids (oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) have been 
successfully used to manage rash and have been used prophylactically in subsequent cycle s.  
The use of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], IV, or oral steroid (eg, prednisone ≤ 10 mg per day or equivalent) is 
permitted.  Management of a Grade 3 rash may require intravenous antihistamines or 
corticosteroids.  Administration of ixazomib (and/or other causative agent if  given in 
combination) should be modified per protocol and re -initiated at a reduced level from where rash 
was noted (also, per protocol).   
In line with clinical practice, dermatology consult and biopsy of Grade 3 or higher rash or any 
SAE involving rash is recommended.  Prophylactic measures should also be considered if a 
patient has previously developed a rash (eg, using a thick, alcohol -free emollient cream on dry 
areas of the body or oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_12669]).  A rare risk is Stevens -Johnson Synd rome, a 
severe and potentially life -threatening rash with skin peeling and mouth sores, which should be 
managed symptomatically according to standard medical practice.  Punch biopsies for 
histopathological analysis are encouraged at the discretion of the i nvestigator.  
Thrombocytopenia  
Blood counts should be monitored regularly as outlined in the protocol with additional testing 
obtained according to standard clinical practice. Thrombocytopenia may be severe but has been 
manageable with platelet transfusions  according to standard clinical practice. Ixazomib 
administration should be modified as noted as per dose modification recommendations in the 
protocol when thrombocytopenia occurs. Therapy can be reinitiated at a reduced level upon 
recovery of platelet cou nts. A rare risk is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a rare 
blood disorder where blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body characterized 
by [CONTACT_12703], petechiae, fever, or possibly more serious signs and symptoms. TTP 
should be managed symptomatically according to standard medical practice.  
Neutropenia  
Neutropenia  has been reported with ixazomib.  Blood counts should be monitored regularly as 
outlined in the protocol with additional testing obtained according to standard c linical practice.  
Neutrop enia may be severe but has been manageable with G-CSF according to standard 
clinical practice.  Neutropenic nadirs commonly recover without intervention by [CONTACT_631035] a short delay in treatme nt.  ixazomib administration should be 
modified when neutropenia occurs, as noted in the dose modification recommendations table .  
Therapy can be reinitiated at a reduced level upon recovery of absolute neutrophil counts . 
Fluid Deficits  
Dehydration should be avoided  because ixazomib may cause vomiting, diarrhea, and 
dehydration .  Acute renal failure has been reported with ixazomib.  Fluid deficits should be 
corrected before initiation of study drug  and during treatment and as needed during therapy .  
Until f urther information is available, intake of NSAIDs while on this protocol should be avoided.  
Hypotension  
Symptomatic hypotension and orthostatic hypotension have been reported with ixazomib. Blood 
pressure should be closely monitored while the patient is on  study treatment and fluid deficit 
should be corrected as needed, especially in the setting of concomitant symptoms such as 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or anorexia. Patients taking medications and/or diuretics to manage 
their blood pressure (for either hyp o- or hypertension) should be managed according to 
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_631006], MD   UARK [ADDRESS_841983] clinical practice, including considerations for dose adjustments of their concomitant 
medications during the course of the trial.   
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome  
One case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported with 
ixazomib.  While this case ultimately resolved, PRES has also been reported rarely with other  
proteasome inhibitor s, VELCADE  and Kyprolis .  PRES is characterized by [CONTACT_631036], seizures 
and visual loss, as well as abrupt increase in blood pressure.  Prompt diagnosis and initiation of 
antihypertensive and anticonvulsant therapy are important to prevent irreversible end -organ 
damage.  
8.2.6.  Preparation, Reconstitution, and Dispensin g 
Ixazomib is an anticancer drug and as with other potentially toxic compounds caution should be 
exercised when handling ixazomib capsules.  
Packaging and Labeling  
The study drug ixazomib capsules will be provided by [CONTACT_20555].  The study drug will be 
hand led as open -label material  bearing a label with the following statement:  “Caution: New 
Drug – Limited by [CONTACT_12201].”    
The capsules are individually packaged using cold -form foil -foil blisters that are in a child -
resistant carton.   There are 3  capsules  in each wallet/carton.  
Storage, Handling, and Accountability  
Study drug will be stored in the UAMS Research Pharmacy under the supervision of the 
research pharmacist who will be responsible for maintaining the supply according to th e 
manufacturer’s specifications, dispensing the drug for administration, and maintaining all 
accountability records.  
Upon receipt at the investigative site, ixazomib should remain in the blister and carton provided 
until use or until drug is dispensed. The  container should be stored at the investigative site 
refrigerated (36°F to 46°F, 2°C to 8°C). Ensure that the drug is used before the retest expi[INVESTIGATOR_502207]. Expi[INVESTIGATOR_20541].  
Ixazomib capsules dispensed to the patient for take -home dosing should remain in the blister 
packaging and refrigerated as noted above until the point of use. The investigative site is 
responsible for providing the medic ation to the patient in the correct daily dose configurations. 
Comprehensive instructions should be provided to the patient in order to ensure compliance 
with dosing procedures. Patients who are receiving take -home medication should be given only 
1 cycle o f medication at a time. Patients should be instructed to store the medication 
refrigerated (36°F to 46°F, 2°C to 8°C) for the duration of each cycle. Patients should be 
instructed to return their empty blister packs to the investigative site, rather than d iscarding 
them. Reconciliation will occur accordingly when the patient returns for their next cycle of take -
home medication.  Any extreme in temperature should be reported as an excursion and should 
be dealt with on a case -by-case basis.  
Because ixazomib i s an investigational agent, it should be handled with due care. Patients 
should be instructed not to chew, break, or open capsules. In case of contact [CONTACT_631037]:  [INVESTIGATOR_631006], MD   UARK [ADDRESS_841984] with the powder (eg, from a broken capsule), skin should be washed 
immediately with soa p and copi[INVESTIGATOR_12666] [ADDRESS_841985] 
capsules.  
Study Compliance  
Study drug will be administered or dispensed only to eligible patients under the supervision of 
the investigator or identified sub-investigator(s).  The appropriate study personnel will maintain 
records of study drug receipt and dispensing.  
Termination of Treatment and/or Study Participation  
Patients will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any 
reason, without prejudice to their medical care.  The investigator also has the right to withdraw 
patients from the study for any of the following reasons:  
 Adverse event  
 Protocol violation  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Progressive disease   
 Study terminated  
At the time of withdrawal, all study procedures outlined for the End of Treatment  visit should be 
completed  (unless already completed and withdrawal is only from long -term follow -up for 
survival) . The primary reason for patient’s withdrawal from the study sh ould be documented.  
9. STATISTICAL  AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES  
9.1. Statistical methods  
This is a single -arm, phase 2 study to evaluate bone remodeling during ixazomib treatment in 
relapsed/refractory MM patients. The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of ixazomib on inducing 
osteoblast activation as measured by [CONTACT_631038] . Ixazomib will 
be administered orally at the dosage of 4.[ADDRESS_841986] are described in Section 3. A similar study outlined in Zangari (16) by 
[CONTACT_631039] (30) evaluated bone markers after treatment with bortezomib in relapsed myeloma and found 
marked improvement. Terpos (30) reported the median and range osteocalcin level for myeloma 
patients at baseline and after 8 cycles of treatment with bortezomib.  Based on an observed median 
osteocalcin level (and estimated standard deviation ) of 7.46 ng/ml ( sd = 12.65 ) in ba seline myeloma 
patients compared to 19 ng/ml ( sd = 18.6 ) after treatment with bortezomib, differences in pre - and post - 
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_631006], MD   UARK [ADDRESS_841987], and a significance level of 0.05, the design gives  a powe r of 88 % for [ADDRESS_841988] will be used .  Difference in binary study 
parameters will be evaluated using McNemar’s test for correlated proportions .  Correlation between 
bone marker parameters will be evaluate d using the Spearman correlation coefficient.  One -sided p -
values <0.[ADDRESS_841989] who has signed 
informed consent to participate in a study but before administration of any study medication; it does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with study participation.  
Adverse Event Definition  
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence in a  patient or subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory fi nding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product.  This includes 
any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the 
administration of study drug.  
With the exception of grade 3 -4 laboratory abnormalities, a n abnormal laboratory value will not be 
assessed as an AE unless that value leads to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, 
therapeutic intervention, or is considered by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change from 
baseline.   
Serious Adverse Event Definition  
 Serious AE (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death.Is life -threaten ing (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe).  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324].  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. (Disability is defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 Is a medically important event .  This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be immediately 
life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered serious when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, require medical or surgical 
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_631006], MD   UARK [ADDRESS_841990] of an infectious agent.   Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse; any organism, virus, or infectious particle (eg, prion protein 
transmitting Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy), path ogenic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.   
Clarification should be made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered severe in 
intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous.  The general 
term severe  is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, 
however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache).  This is NOT 
the same as serious , which is based on patient/event outc ome or action criteria described above, and is 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or ability to function.  A severe AE 
(Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  For example, a white blood cell 
count of 1000/mm3 to less than 2000 is considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered 
serious.  Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Related  
An even t is “related” if more likely than not it was caused by [CONTACT_631040] “unexpected” when its specificity, nature, severity or incidence is not accurately reflected in 
the consent form, protocol, or IB previously reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201].  Examples include 
lower rate of response to treatment or a side effect that is more severe than initially expected.  
Study Period  
The study period is defined as the period of time from start of study drug through the End of Treatment 
visit.  Eve nts occurring after enrollment but prior to the study period will be considered pretreatment 
events (see above).  
10.2.  Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of AEs  
Maurizo Zangari, M.D., is the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_37105]; The University of Arkansas for M edical 
Sciences (UAMS) is the study sponsor.  UAMS is responsible for reporting serious adverse events 
(SAEs) to any regulatory agency ; the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_631018] (see Section 10.4) . 
AEs may be spo ntaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an open question from study 
personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures .  When 
possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology sho uld be noted as one 
comprehensive event.  All AEs occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course 
of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the 
study treatment or partici pation is not the cause.  SAEs that are still ongoing at the end of the study 
period must be followed up for up to 30 days to determine the final outcome.  Any SAE that occurs after 
the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study tre atment or study participation 
should be recorded and reported immediately to the Sponsor  (UAMS) .   
All subjects will be monitored for AE’s during the study.  Assessments may include monitoring the 
patient’s clinical symptoms; laboratory, pathological, radiological, or surgical findings; physical 
examination; or other appropriate tests and procedures.  
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_631019]:  Maurizio Zangari, MD   UARK 2014 -14

 unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery was performed earlier or later than planned).  All 
SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s 
stable  or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).  
AE’s are to be reported in a routine fashion at scheduled times during the trial, such as with the annual 
continuing review to the IRB.  Certain AEs must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for mor e 
timely monitoring of subject safety and care.  The preporting of these events depends on the 
characteristics of the event:  
 Seriousness (grading of event)  
 Relatedness to study therapy  
 Expectedness  
Steps to Determine if the even t requires expedited Reporti ng: 
 Identify the type of event and grade the event using NCI CTCAE version 4.0  
 Determine whether the adverse event is related to the investigational drug.  Attribution 
categories are as follows:  
o Unrelated  
o Unlikely  
o Possible  
o Probable  
o Definite  
 Determine the expectedness of the event.  Expected events are those previously identified 
resulting from administration of the agent.  See definition for “unexpected” above.  
10.3.  Expedited Reporting of  SAEs  
Only adverse events meeting the UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845] (Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Subjects or 
Others) will need to be reported to the UAMS IRB within the required 10 day period  of being notified of 
the event. UPI[INVESTIGATOR_631020]: a) 
unanticipated or unexpected; b) related to the research; and c) involves new or increased risk to the 
subject(s).  All other adverse events should be recorded and reported to the UAMS IRB at continuing 
review.  
The Spon sor (UAMS) will be promptly notified of all SAEs that are related to the study and 
unanticipated/unexpected. These SAEs will be reported to the Sponsor using the FDA Medwatch 
3500A.   UAMS  will report events to FDA in accordance with 21CFR312.  
All other SA Es will be reported to the Sponsor and FDA in the Annual Progress Report.  
Deaths that are related to research will be reported to the Sponsor immediately upon Investigator 
notification.  A death due to a terminal condition of the research participant would  be considered 
anticipated and not related to the research and therefore not immediately reportable under this policy.   
The sponsor will report deaths to FDA in accordance with 21CFR312.    
10.4.  Other Required Reporting  
AEs which are serious must be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) from the date 
the participant signs Informed Consent through [ADDRESS_841991] of ixazomib. 
Any SAE that occurs at any time after completion of ixazomib treatment or after the study  period that 
the principal -investigator and/or sub -investigator considers to be related to any study drug must be 
reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee).  In addition, new primary malignancies that 
occur during the follow -up periods must be rep orted, regardless of causality to study regimen, for a 
minimum of three years after the last dose of the investigational product, starting from the first dose of 
study drug. All new cases of primary malignancy must be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilan ce (or 
designee).

 Regardless of expectedness or causality, all SAEs (including serious pretreatment events) must also be 
reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance:  
Fatal and Life Threatening SAEs within 24 hours but no later than 4 calendar days of the 
investigator’s observation or awareness of the event  
All other serious (non -fatal/non -life threatening) events within 4 calendar days of the investigator’s 
observation or awareness of the event  
See below for contact [CONTACT_20558].   
The investigator must fax the SAE Form per the timelines above.  A sample of an SAE Form will be 
provided.   
The SAE report must include at minimum:  
Event term(s ) 
Serious criteria  
Intensity of the event(s ): Principal - or sub -investigator’s determination.   Intensity for each SAE, 
including any lab abnormalities, will be determined by [CONTACT_631041], as a guideline, whenever po ssible.   The criteria are available online at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
Causality of the event(s):  Principal - or sub -investigator’s determination of the relationship of the 
event(s) to study drug administration.  
Follow -up information on the SAE may be requested by [CONTACT_20555].    
Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormalities, will be determined by [CONTACT_631042] 4.0, as a guideline, whenever possible.  The criteria are available online at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.  
Relationship to the study drugs for each SAE will be determined by [CONTACT_9940] -investigator 
by [CONTACT_631043]: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with 
the study drug(s)?  
The investigator must also provide Millennium Pharmacovigilance with a copy of all communications 
with applicable regulatory authorities rel ated to the study product(s), as soon as possible but no later 
than [ADDRESS_841992] Information

Email: [EMAIL_356]  
Fax: 1 -[PHONE_5005]  
Hours: Mon -Fri, 8am -6pm EST  
 
Product complaints in and of themselves are not AEs.  If a product complaint results in an SAE, 
an SAE form should be completed and sent to Millennium Pharmacovigilance .  
12. ETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1.  Informed  Consent  
The principles of informed consent are described by [CONTACT_60836] (Federal Register 
Vol 46, No. 17, January 27, 1981, part 50) and the Office for Protection from Research Risks Reports: 
Protection of Human Subjects (Code of Federal Regulations 45 CFR 46).  They must be followed to 
comply with FDA regulations for the conduct and monitoring of clinical investigations.  
12.2.  Institutional  Review  
This stu dy must be approved by [CONTACT_172001], as defined by [CONTACT_631044] (Ref Federal Register Vol. 46, No. 17, January 27, 1981, part 56) and the Office 
for Protection from Research Risks Reports: Protection of Human Subject s (Code of Federal 
Regulations 45 CFR 46).  
 
The Investigator will be responsible for preparing documents for submission to the relevant IRB/EC and 
obtaining written approval for this study.  The approval will be obtained prior to the initiation of the 
study.   
 
Any modifications/amendments to the protocol after receipt of IRB/EC approval must be submitted by 
[CONTACT_26492]/EC for approval  and to the sponsor . The Investigator is also responsible for 
notifying the IRB/EC and sponsor of any serious deviations f rom the protocol, or anything that may 
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_631006], MD   UARK [ADDRESS_841994]’s right to protection against invasion of privacy. In compliance 
with [LOCATION_002] Federal regulations, representatives of the FDA, NCI and other regulatory authorities 
may review medical records and copy relevant research records in accordance with local laws.  
 
Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate f rom the subject’s 
statement of informed consent, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in 
writing from the appropriate individual.  
12.4.  Investigator Responsibilities  
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH guideline  for Good Clinical Practice and the Code of 
Federal Regulations.  
 
The Investigator will permit IRB/EC review and regulatory inspec tion(s) (e.g. FDA, EMEA, TPP), 
providing direct access to the facilities where the study took place, source documents and all  other 
study documents.  
 
The Investigator or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff must be available at some time 
during auditing visits to review data and resolve any queries and to allow direct access to the subject’s 
records (e.g. medical reco rds, office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study related charts) for source data 
verification. All study documents must be made available to the auditing representative so that the 
accuracy and completeness of study documents may be confirmed.  
12.5.  Protocol  Amen dments  
If modification of the protocol is necessary, the modification must be confirmed in writing, and the 
Sponsor will inform the FDA in accordance with 21CFR 312; the Investigator will inform the IRB.  
Amendments that are administrative in nature do not require IRB approval but will be submitted to the 
IRB for information.   
12.6.  Suspension of Study  
If conditions arise requiring further clarification before the decision to p roceed with or terminate the 
study can be reached, the study will be suspended until the situation has been resolved.  
12.7.  Protocol  Deviations  
When an emergency occurs that requires a deviation from the protocol for a study subject, a deviation 
will be made onl y for that subject. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_631021], if circumstances and time permit, contact [CONTACT_631045]. If time 
does not allow for this, the Investigator will notify of the IRB of the deviation as soon as possible in 
writing.  
 
Such contacts will be made as soon as possible to determine whether or not the subject (for whom the 
deviation from protocol was effected) is to continue in the study.  The subjects’ medical and/or research  
record will completely describe the deviation from the protocol and state the reasons for such deviation.

 APPENDICES  
 
APPENDIX A  
Response Criteria and Survival Outcome Definitions  
 
Timing of Response Evaluation  
 
Response will be evaluated according to the Schedule of Evaluations listed above (Section 6.0)  
 
Definition of Measurable Disease  
 
a. Measurable protein criteria of the serum are defined as serum M -protein of IgG, IgA, IgD, IgE Isotype ≥ 1.0 gm/dl 
(10.0 g/L).    Measurable protein criteria of the urine are defined as urine M -protein (Bence -Jones Protein) > 200 
mg/[ADDRESS_841998] either  20% bone marrow plasmacytosis or >3 lytic lesions on skeletal 
survey.  
 
c. Non-Secretory Disease:  Participants without quantifiable M -proteins but with 20% bone marrow plasmacytosis 
will be assessed using plasma cell percentages.  These participants will be evaluated for CR, no CR, and 
progression/relapse using the criteria abo ve. 
 
Response Criteria : 
 
Multiple Myeloma:  For the purpose of establishing one set of criteria for both Phase II and Phase III multiple myeloma 
studies, the following definitions will be used.  These definitions are based on the International Uniform Resp onse Criteria 
for Multiple Myeloma.  
 
a. Measurable Disease :  Measurable, quantifiable protein criteria must be present.  Acceptable protein criteria are:  
 
 Serum M protein ≥ 1 g/dL ( ≥ 10 g/L), quantified by [CONTACT_631046] 
(SPEP).  
 
AND / OR  
 
 Urine M protein [Bence -Jones Protein] ≥ 200 mg/24 hrs  (> 0.2 g/24 hrs), quantified by 24 -hour urine 
protein electrophoresis (UPEP ).  
 
OR 
 
 Patients who have both serum M protein levels < 1 g/dL AND urine M protein levels < 200 mg/24 hrs at 
baseline may be followed by [CONTACT_557357] (FLC) assay if involved free light chain level ≥ 10 
mg/dL (≥ 100mg/L).  
 
Oligosecretory and Non -secretory Disease:   Patients that do not meet the criteria for measurable disease 
above may only be assessed for the following objective statuses: Stringent Complete Response, Stable, and 
Progression.  
  
b. Objective Status:  
 
Stringent Complete Response (sCR):    
 
 Meets all o f the criteria for Complete Response (CR) and   
 normal serum free light chain ratio and 
absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by [CONTACT_631047] (CR):  
 
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_631006], MD   UARK 2014 -14 
Clinical Study Protocol X16013   v5, May 15 , 2017    
 
Page 46 of 50 
  Disappearance of all evidence of serum and urine M proteins on immunofixation electrophoresis studies 
and 
 ≤ 5% plasma cells in bone marrow and 
 disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas  
  
Very Good Partial Response (VGPR):  
 
 Meets all of the criteria fo r Partial Response (PR) and 
 Serum and urine M proteins detectable by [CONTACT_332864]  
 ≥ 90% reduction in serum M protein and urine M protein < 100 mg/24 hrs.  
 
Partial Response (PR):  
 
 If the patient had soft tissue plasmacytomas  present at baseline and they were assessed at this disease 
assessment: ≥ 50% reduction in size of soft tissue plasmacytomas (see Appendix  A; Notes h.) and 
 If the patient had ≥ 30% plasma cells in bone marrow at baseline and a bone marrow biopsy was done: ≥  
50% reduction in plasma cells and 
 ≥ 50% reduction in serum M protein and reduction in urine M protein ≥ 90% or to < 200 mg/24hr or 
 If patient had serum M protein < 1 g/dL, urine M protein < 200 mg/24 hrs, and an involved serum free light 
chain level ≥ 10 mg/dL at baseline: ≥ 50% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved 
serum free light chain levels  
 
Stable Disease (STA):  
 
 Patient does not meet criteria for Stringent Complete Response, Complete Response, Very Good Partial 
Response, Partial  Response, or Progression.  
 
Progression (PROG):   Any one or more of the following:  
 
 Serum M protein increase ≥ 25% from baseline (or an increase of ≥ 1 g/dL if serum M protein was ≥ 5 
g/dL at baseline), with an absolute increase of ≥ 0.5 g/dL or 
 Urine M pr otein increase ≥ 25% from baseline, with an absolute increase of ≥ 200 mg/24 hrs or 
 If patient had serum M protein < 1 g/dL, urine M protein < 200 mg/24 hrs, and an involved serum free light 
chain level ≥ 10 mg/dL at baseline: ≥ 25% increase in the differe nce between involved and uninvolved 
serum free light chain level, with an absolute increase of ≥ 10 mg/dL or 
 Bone marrow plasma cell percentage increase ≥ 25% from baseline, with the absolute plasma cell % ≥ 
10% or 
 New bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacyt omas, or definite increase in size of existing bone lesions or 
soft tissue plasmacytomas (see Appendix  A: Notes h.) or 
 Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium > 11.5 mg/dL or 2.65 mmol/L) that can be 
attributed solely to multiple myeloma  
 
NOTE: If a disease assessment indicates that a patient is experiencing a Stringent Complete 
Response, Complete Response, Very Good Partial Response, Partial Response, or Progression, this 
should be confirmed by a second disease assessment and this should b e done prior to the institution 
of any new therapy.  The second disease assessment may be done at any time.  
 
Notes : 
 
a. “M protein” may also be known by [CONTACT_423886]: M -spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], monoclonal protein, myeloma protein, monoclonal 
paraprotein, M-component.  
 
b. Urine M protein measurement is estimated using 24 -hour urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) only.  Random or 24 hour 
urine tests measuring kappa and lambda light chain levels are not reliable and are not recommended.  
 
c. Patients with ‘mea surable disease’ in both the serum and urine (serum M protein ≥ 1g/dL and urine M protein ≥ 200 
mg/24h) at baseline need to be followed by [CONTACT_631048].  
 
d. Except for assessment of Complete Response, patients with ‘measurable  disease’ restricted to the serum (serum M

 protein ≥ 1 g/dL and urine M protein < 200 mg/24h) at baseline may be followed by [CONTACT_423888].  Likewise, except for 
assessment of Complete Response, patients with ‘measurable disease’ restricted to the urine (serum  M protein < 1 g/dL 
and urine M protein ≥ 200 mg/24h) at baseline may be followed by [CONTACT_423889].  
 
e. Patients with serum M protein ≥ 1 g/dL and/or urine M protein ≥ 200 mg/24h at baseline will be assessed for response 
based on SPEP and/or UPEP results only.   Except for assessment of Stringent Complete Response, serum free light 
chain (FLC) assay response requirements are only applicable to patients who had serum M protein < 1 g/dL, urine M 
protein < 200 mg/24 hrs, and an involved serum free light chain level  ≥ 10 mg/dL at baseline.  A normal serum free light 
chain ratio is required for all patients for a Stringent Complete Response.  
 
f. To qualify for a Complete Response, both serum and urine immunofixation must be carried out and must be negative, 
regardless  of the size of the baseline M protein in the serum or urine.  
 
g. Skeletal survey is not required for assessment of response unless clinically indicated, but is recommended once a year in 
clinical practice.  Stringent Complete Response, Complete Response, Very Good Partial Response, Partial Response, 
and Stable Disease all require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were 
performed, but radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements.  
   
h. The size of the soft tissue plasmacytomas is defined as the sum of the products of the cross -diameters of each 
plasmacytoma.  The size of the bone lesions will be determined in a similar manner.  A definite increase in the size is 
defined as a ≥ 50% incr ease (and at least 1 cm2) of this sum.  
 
Best Response : This is calculated from a sequence of Objective Status evaluations  
 
Stringent Complete Response (sCR):  An objective status of Stringent Complete Response on at least two sequential 
disease assessments.  Only one bone marrow biopsy, done during one of these two disease assessments, is required to 
confirm the response.  
 
Complete Response (CR ): An objective s tatus of Complete Response on at least two sequential disease assessments.  
Only one bone marrow biopsy, done during one of these two disease assessments, is required to confirm the response.  
  
Very Good Partial Response (VGPR ): An objective status of Ver y Good Partial Response on at least two sequential 
disease assessments.  
Partial Response (PR):   An objective status of Partial Response on at least two sequential disease assessments.  
 
Unconfirmed sCR (UsCR):  One objective status of Stringent Complete Res ponse (based on evidence from serum and 
urine studies and, if drawn, bone marrow biopsy) but the confirmation studies are either not done, or when done, do not 
meet the requirements necessary to confirm response.  This must be documented before progression  and at least three 
weeks after registration.  
 
Unconfirmed CR (UCR):  One objective status of Complete Response (based on evidence from serum and urine studies 
and, if drawn, bone marrow biopsy) but the confirmation studies are either not done, or when done , do not meet the 
requirements necessary to confirm response.  This must be documented before progression and at least three weeks 
after registration.  
 
Unconfirmed VGPR (UVGPR ): One objective status of Very Good Partial Response, but the confirmation studi es are 
either not done, or when done, do not meet the requirements necessary to confirm response.  This must be documented 
before progression and at least three weeks after registration.  
 
Unconfirmed PR (UPR ): One objective status of Partial Response, but the confirmation studies are either not done, or 
when done, do not meet the requirements necessary to confirm response.  This must be documented before progression 
and at least three weeks after registration.  
 
Stable / No Response (STA ): At least one objec tive status of Stable at least three weeks after registration, but not 
qualifying as any of the above.  If radiographic studies were performed there should be no known progressive or new 
bone lesions.  
 
Increasing Disease (lNC) : First objective status recor ded (other than Unknowns or those before three weeks) of 
Progression, provided this occurs within eight weeks of registration.

Page 48 of 50 
 Inadequate Assessment. Response Unknown (NASS): Progression greater than eight weeks after registration and either 
all objective  statuses prior to registration are unknown or the only known objective statuses occurred less than three 
weeks after registration.  
 
Relapse :  In patients with a confirmed response as described above , relapse is defined as the first occurrence of any of 
the following, reconfirmed by [CONTACT_423890]/or 24 -hour urine M protein, done more than 2 weeks apart : 
   
a. Myeloma protein increase by [CONTACT_726] 100% from the lowest level recorded on study, or a rise of 2.0 g/dl 
(this increase must be to a level > 1.0 g/dL if it is to constitute the sole manifestation of relapse).  
b. Myeloma protein increase above the response criteria for PR (see criteria for Partial Remission).  
c. Reappearance of M -protein in blood or urine not related to immune recovery or rece nt infection.  
d. Increase in the size and number of lytic bone lesions recognized on radiographs.  New skeletal or MRI 
lesions, preferentially confirmed by [CONTACT_14239][INVESTIGATOR_337].  
e. Myeloma related cytogenetic abnormalities.  
f. BM plasmacytosis > 10% or > 5% light chain restricted, non -diploid, plasma cells on cIg/DNA.  
g. Hypercalcemia, not explained by [CONTACT_364820].  
 
 
Survival Outcomes  
 
Overall Survival :  measured as the time from initial registration to death from any cause.  
 
Event -Free Survival :  measured as the time from initial registration to progression/relapse of disease or death from any 
cause

Clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 10% or biopsy -proven bony or extramedullary plasmacytomaa 
And any one or more of the following myeloma defining events:  
 Evidence of end organ damage that can be attributed to the underlying plasma cell proliferative 
disorder, specifically:  
o Hypercalcemia:  serum calcium >0.25 mmol/L  (>1 mg/dL) higher than the ULN or 
>2.75 mmol/L (>11 mg/dL)  
o Renal insufficiency:  CrCl <40 mL per minb or SCr >177 µmol/L (>2 mg/dL)  
o Anemia:  Hb >20 g/L below the LLN, or Hb <100 g/L  
o Bone lesions:  one or more osteolytic lesions on skeletal radiography, CT, or PET -CTc 
 Any one or more of the following biomarkers of malignancy:  
o Clonal bone marrow plasma cell percentagea ≥60%  
o Involved:uninvolved serum FLC ratiod ≥100  
o >1 focal lesions on MRI studiese 
CrCl, Creatinine clearance; CT, computed tomography; FLC, free light chain; Hb, hemoglobin; Ig, immunoglobulin; 
IMWG, International Myeloma Working Group; LLN, lower limit of normal; M protein, monoclonal protein; MRI, 
magnetic resonance imaging; PET -CT, Positron emission tomography -computed tomography; ULN, uppe r limit of 
normal; SCr, serum creatinine  
aClonality should be established by [CONTACT_30432] κ/λ –light-chain restriction on flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, 
or immunofluorescence.  Bone marrow plasma cell percentage should preferably be estimated from a core  biopsy 
specimen; in case of a disparity between the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_170037], the highest value should be used.  
bMeasured or estimated by [CONTACT_117207].  
cIf bone marrow has less than 10% clonal plasma cells, more than one bone lesion is required to distinguish from 
solitary plasmacytoma with minimal marrow involvement.  
dThese values are based on the serum Freelite assay (The Binding Site Group, Birmingham, [LOCATION_006]).  The involved 
free light chain must be ≥100 mg/L.  
eEach focal lesion must be 5 mm or more in size.

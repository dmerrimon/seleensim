1.1 SYNOPSIS 
Title: Transabdominal plane (TAP) Blocks for Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia 
Repair
Grant Number:
Study Description: Inguinal hernias are bulges in the groin region that arise from 
weaknesses in the abdominal wall. Often, due to discomfort, pain or 
cosmetic dissatisfaction, these hernias must be surgically repaired. The 
use of a transabdominal plane (TAP) block—a local injection given in 
the abdomen to block pain receptors on nerves—during surgery can 
presumably decrease postoperative pain. The aim of our study is to 
investigate whether the use of a TAP block can decrease the use of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_409670].
Objectives*:The aim of our study is to examine outcomes and pain control after 
surgery in patients who underwent laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair 
(IHR) with the use of perioperative transabdominal plane (TAP) block. 
Research Question: Does transabdominal plane block improve pain 
when undergoing inguinal hernia repair?
Endpoints*:To evaluate whether preoperative TAP blocks improve pain score 
(primary end point) and decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (secondary endpoint) after 
an inguinal hernia repair. Other end points- complications after surgery.
Study Population: We will be enrolling 100 patients from Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_409671].
Phase* or Stage:
Description of 
Sites/Facilities Enrolling 
Participants:All enrollment will occur at one site (Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) at Faculty 
Practice Associates and Emergency Department.
Description of Study 
Intervention/Experimental 
Manipulation:The study intervention is the administration of a TAP Block (0.25% 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338309] (Saline). For patients weighing <100 kg, they 
will receive a total of 50 mL ((25 mL on each side of the abdominal 
wall). If patients weigh>100 kg, they will receive a total of 60 mL
 (30mL on each side of the abdominal wall). The TAP plane is identified 
using ultrasound. All anesthesiologists working with the surgical 
attendings involved in this study have been trained in this technique; it 
is a routine part of their practice. Anesthesiologists will be performing 
the block.
Study Duration*:2 Years
Participant Duration: 2 Weeks

Protocol <#> DD Month YYYY
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research 52.[ADDRESS_516632] (TAP) block—a local injection of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_409672]—during surgery can presumably decrease postoperative pain. Currently, TAP blocks 
are approved for use and performed based on surgeon preference (e.g. some surgeons perform them on 
every case, others variably, etc.). The aim of our study is to investigate whether the use of a TAP block can 
decrease the use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_409670]. 
Papers - PMID: 27555193, 29605459, 25558340, [ADDRESS_516633]/ Fisher exact test and Student t-test/Wilcoxon Signed rank test. This method of analysis does not take 
into account longitudinal nature of the data. We will take into account the fact that same patient is being 
examined throughout the study at different time points. In addition to the above mentioned statistical 
procedures we will examine the trajectory between the TAP group vs. placebo group over time using 
mixed effects models (will also take into account correlation structure between different time points) for 
the outcome of opi[INVESTIGATOR_409673].
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 
2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS 
There always exists the potential for loss of private information. There is also always the risk that the TAP 
block may not provide adequate analgesia.
There is also a risk of bowel perforation during TAP injection. However, this risk is minimal given that the 
bowel is well visualized with ultrasound guidance and thus avoided at all costs.
All injections of anesthetic carry a <1% risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) which can cause 
seizures or even cardiac arrest. 
As all risks for harm are those included as part of standard treatments, there are no provisions for harm 
or injury. Any follow-up tests, treatments, or procedures will performed at cost to the participant.
2.3.2 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS 
It is possible that the patient may receive no benefit from this study. However, benefits may include 
improved postoperative pain management, decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_409674].

future patients with inguinal hernia to be more knowledgeable about the benefits and risks of this option.

for harm or injury due to the study. All information will be stored securely and in accordance with IRB 
policies and expectations. This treatment could prove beneficial to the patient and the larger public in 
terms of pain control and reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].

Do TAP blocks improve pain

block on pain levels through 
the RCT design is the gold 
standard approach. 
Secondary
Do TAP blocks decrease

number/volume of 
pain medication. TAP blocks should directly

complications after surgery?Assessing 
complication rate 
differences 
between the 
intervention and

Protocol <#> DD Month YYYY
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research 7After receiving approval for the study, we will conduct a prospective single institution 
randomized clinical trial assessing if using a TAP block perioperatively can reduce pain scores 
after surgery. Other endpoints include whether there are differences in pain medication usage 
and complications. 
Patients will be screened by [CONTACT_409688]. If the patient is 
interested, we will consent them for the study after they understand the study details, 
procedures, and expectations. We will then consent using IRB approved study consent forms 
and procedures. Patients will undergo a laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair according to 
standard procedures. Our study will assess if a TAP block impacts pain scores. Patients will be 
randomized to receive the intervention or placebo. Sequentially numbered sealed opaque 
envelopes with group allocation inside will alert the anesthesiologist/ surgeon
 to order Tap block composed of 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338309] (normal saline).
Inguinal hernia repair will be performed in standard fashion that each individual surgeon is 
familiar with. No additional tests or blood work outside the standard of care for IHR will be 
performed for research purposes. In addition, some patients will be given TAP blocks before 
surgery to help in pain management. In addition, patients will be discharged with a worksheet 
on which they are to record analgesic use and pain scores on postoperative days one, two, 
three and four. They are expected to bring the completed log to their two-week follow up visit 
with their surgeon. Patients may also expect to receive a phone call from a member of the 
surgical team to remind them to record these metrics.
The TAP block is done pre-procedure using 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. If patients weigh<100 kg, they 
will receive a total of 50 mL (25 mL on each side of the abdominal wall). If patients weigh>100 
kg, they will receive a total of 60 mL (30mL on each side of the abdominal wall). The TAP plane 
is identified using ultrasound. All anesthesiologists (not surgeons) working with the attendings 
involved in this study have been trained in this technique; it is a routine part of their practice. It 
is anesthesiologists who will be performing the block.
Patients will be discharged with a worksheet /survey on which they are to record analgesic use 
and pain scores on postoperative days one, two, three and four. They are expected to bring the 
completed log to their two-week follow up visit.

disease, they may be overwhelmed and may have limited time to process the risks and benefits of

involved in the consent process in best practices for consenting a patient. Ultimately, the physician will 
make the decision for enrollment.
6 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S)
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S) ADMINISTRATION
6.1.1 STUDY INTERVENTION OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION DESCRIPTION
The study intervention is 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. This neural block will be administered at the transabdominal 
plane. Other clinical trials have shown benefit of a neural block for hernia repairs on pain scores. We 
believe this intervention will work according to similar mechanism.
6.1.2 ADMINISTRATION AND/OR DOSING
Patients are randomized to receive one time administration of either 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_409676]. 
The TAP block is done pre-procedure using 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. If patients weigh<100 kg, they will receive 
a total of 50 mL (25 mL on each side of the abdominal wall). If patients weigh>100 kg, they will receive a 
total of 60 mL (30mL on each side of the abdominal wall). The TAP plane is identified using ultrasound. All 
anesthesiologists (not surgeons) working with the attendings involved in this study have been trained in 
this technique; it is a routine part of their practice. It is anesthesiologists who will be performing the block.

This document is a clinical research protocol and the described study will be

associated regulations, and all applicable research requirements . 
 
4. BACKGROUND  
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer in the US  and europe , 
with more than 140,000 new cases and over 50,000 deaths annuall y in the [LOCATION_003] 
alone.1,2,3 While being extremely lethal in its advanced stages, exhibiting a five -year 
survival rate of less than 10%,[ADDRESS_731391] preventable cancer by [CONTACT_556867]. Over 90% of the CRC incidents develop over years from polyps th at grow 
in the colon.[ADDRESS_731392] method for CRC screening, as it enables detection and real -time removal of 
pre-cancerous polyps during the examination.  
It is well known that lesions are missed during routine colonoscopy. A meta -analysis 
of 6 studies by [CONTACT_556868].4, in which subjects  went through two colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_556848], reported an overall 22% poly p miss rate. A clinical study by [CONTACT_556869].,5 which performed same -day, back -to-back colonoscopy on 183 subjects , reported 
an overall adenoma (pre -cancerous polyp) miss rate of 24%. A back -to-back same -
day colonoscopy study in [ADDRESS_731393] colonoscopy of 28% polyps and 20% adenomas. The polyp missing effect 
and its consequences are well demonstrated when comparing actual colorectal cancer 
incidents to past colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_556849] s. Postic et. al.7 
compared resected colon specimens with the results of colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_556850] 7 of 37 
Doc.  G-EYE  [ZIP_CODE], Rev. 01  
 
 
 
  
 
 within 5 months prior to surgery and reported that 23.3% of the lesions in the 
resected specimens were missed during these colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Pabby [INVESTIGATOR_57395]. al.8 report ed 
that 23% of subjects  in whom colon cancer developed, went within [ADDRESS_731394] on polyp detection rate. A 6,185 patient study by [CONTACT_556870]. 
al.9 repor ted a miss -rate of 12.2% in the cap -assisted colonoscopy group vs. 28.6% 
miss rate in the standard colonoscopy group, implying a positive effect of cap 
employment on polyp detection rate. In contrast, another study performed by [CONTACT_556871]. 
al.[ADDRESS_731395] colonoscopy and cap -assisted colonoscopy (31.3% vs. 
32.8%, respectively). Recently, a rearward viewing device was introduced for use 
during colonoscopy with standa rd endoscopes. The device – the Third Eye 
Retroscope (TER) (Avantis Medical, Sunnyvale, CA), is a disposable optical 
instrument which is passed through the instrument channel of a standard endoscope, 
and folds forwardly of the endoscope optics to provide r etrograde viewing which is 
inspected in parallel to the endoscope’s forward viewing image. This technique is 
aimed to allow inspection of the proximal surface of austral folds, which is not in the 
line-of-sight of the endoscope’s forward -viewing optics, th ereby [CONTACT_556872]. Few clinical studies were performed to 
evaluate the ability of TER to detect additional polyps, beyond standard colonoscopy. 
Triadafilopoulos et. al.11 performed a 24 patient study and reported additional 11.8% 
increase in polyp diagnostic yield using the TER. In this study, the endoscope was 
advanced in the colon to the cecum, and TER was employed during endoscope 
withdrawal. DeMarco et. al.12 performed a 298 patient study with similar 
comparison, which demonstrated 13.2% and 11% increase in detection of polyps and 
adenomas, respectively, by [CONTACT_556873]. A similar study by [CONTACT_556874]. al.13 in 249 
subjects  reported 14.8% and 16% TER -related increase in detection of polyps and 
adenomas, respec tively. Leufkens et. al.14 performed a tandem (back -to-back) study 
in 349 subjects , investigating the TER -related second pass net increase in polyp 
detection, and reported respective TER -related increase in polyp and adenoma 
detection of 23.2% and 29.8%.  
Overall, 5 major reasons can be detailed for missing polyps during colonoscopy:  
1. Polyps that are hidden behind folds in the colon, and are thus not in the line -
of-sight of the endoscope's optics.  
2. Polyps that are in the endoscope optics line -of-sight, but are  masked by [CONTACT_556875]'s topography and natural folds, and are thus un -noticed.  
3. Shallow polyps which do not extend much beyond the mucosa surface.

The NaviAid™ G-EYE ™ system presents a  new and  unique concept that overcomes 
all 5 items listed above, providing an overall solution to the two endoscopy key 
challenges of limited detection/treatment yield and limited operation range.  
 
The NaviAid™  G-EYE ™ system is aimed to create a c omprehensive change of 
practice in the methodology, yield and range of concurrent GI endoscopy, while 
maintaining the existing practice, visualization technique and endoscopy room 
process flow.  
 
The NaviAid™  G-EYE ™ endoscope comprises a standard endoscope onto which a 
unique balloon is permanently integrated, at its bending section. The NaviAid™  G-
EYE ™ balloon is controlled by [CONTACT_556876]™ SPARK2C inflation system. The  
NaviAid™  G-EYE ™ system components are presented in figure 1.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A major attr ibute of the NaviAid™  G-EYE ™ system is its Controlled Withdrawal™ 
technique of the endoscope, with the balloon moderately inflated is to expand and 
stretch the intestinal lumen during endoscope withdrawal. The balloon -endoscope 
system encompassing this con trolled withdrawal method, will broadly improve 
endoscopy performance technique, clinical practice and diagnostic/therapeutic yield, 
by [CONTACT_556877]:  
1. It straightens intestinal folds, thereby [CONTACT_556878]. In 
contrast to rearward -viewing optics, this solution does not detect the lesion in 
its rearward location, but rather brings the lesion towards the forward -viewing 
optics of the endoscope. A major advantage of this approach is that once the 
lesion is brought forwardly of the endoscope optics, it can be readily treated,

inflation system, and (b) permanen tly integrated reusable

 eliminating the need to manipulate the endoscope to be positioned facing the 
lesion.  
1. The local stretching of the colon (or ot her portion of the GI tract) creates a 
smoother and more visually uniform background against which polyps and 
other lesions can more readily be seen by [CONTACT_556879].  
2. This stretching causes polyps and other pathologies to protrude inwardly from 
the colon walls to an extent which is enhanced. Specifically, it provides 
enhanced visibility and access to shallow polyps.  
3. The smooth engagement of the moderately inflated balloon  with the colon (or 
other portion of the GI tract) provides the operator with full control over the 
withdrawal process, allowing thorough and continuous investigation of the 
colon, and very importantly – preventing endoscope slippage in the colon. As 
menti oned in reason [ADDRESS_731397] it, such a po rtion remains unscreened, 
adversely affecting detection yield.    
4. Once a polyp or other lesion is detected, the endoscope’s balloon can be 
readily inflated to anchoring pressure  providing endoscope stabilization in the 
bowel during treatment. This attribut e can be highly valuable when 
performing complex or time/effort consuming intervention, such as removing 
a shallow polyp, multiple polyp removal, suturing, clip application, ERCP 
sessions, and a variety of other interventions. In terms of impact on 
endosco pic intervention practice, the stabilization effect can be dramatic, 
substantially reducing operation time, failure rate, patient risk and sedation 
exposure level, and physician’s required interventional experience and skills.

clinical study coordinator . Details on the randomization method are described in the 
statistical section (section 8).  
  
The investigator will inform the patient of the Group designation prior to the start of 
the procedure.  
 
7.6 Study Procedures  
 
 All subjects will undergo routine bowel preparation according standard protocol 
for each institution .  
 The subject will undergo colonoscopy in accordance with the randomization 
process.  
 Standard colonoscopy will be performed using Pentax endoscope of EC -3890i 
series.  
 G-EYE™ colonoscopy will be per formed using G -EYE™ colonoscope  which is 
based on Pentax EC -3890i series.  
 When performing standard colonoscopy , the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_556851] . 
 When perf orming the G-EYE ™ colonoscopy, the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_556852]™  G-EYE ™ system  Instructions 
For Use  (IFU) . 
 During intubation and withdrawal, investigator will use standard clinical practice 
and will observe the video display .  
 No Buscopan will be used during the procedure.  
 All polyps detected during intubation  will be removed;  irrespective of size, color 
or subjective interpretation, with the possible exception of very small ( <2 mm) 
polyps  or clusters of rect al polyps and that – in the judgment of the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] – 
are not clinically significant. Such lesions will be treated according to the 
endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ standard practice with methods that the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_556853] s. Possible approaches include a) removing all 
such lesions, b) removing one or more lesions for histological evaluation and 
leaving the rest behind or c) leaving all of the lesions in place.  These lesions will 
be excluded whether removed or not.   
 Intubati on time is defined as the duration of the time from the entry of the 
colonoscope into the anal verge to the time when the colonoscope arrives in the 
cecum, as determined by [CONTACT_093].

  Investigator will record bowel preparation using the [LOCATION_011]  Bowel Preparation 
Scale S core method15. Total score (0 -9) will be obtained by [CONTACT_556884], mid and left colon . Score in each segment should be 
≥2 (2 or 3)  to be acceptable. If score of either segment is <2 (0 or 1) , then the 
patient should be either  excluded from the study  or re -scheduled to a different 
session . If patient is rescheduled than he/she will not be re -randomized.  
 Intubation time , withdrawal time and total procedure time will be measured using 
time displayed on the monitor, on a wall clock or on a watch. Pause times will be 
measured by [CONTACT_556885]. An acceptable alternative is to use a 
stopwatch to determine the time intervals, in which case the stopwatch will be 
stopped at the beginning of a pause and re -started as the procedure resumes.  
 Withdrawal time is defined as the duration of the time from initiation of cecal 
inspection to the time when the colonoscope is with drawn from the anus.  
 During withdrawal, pause times will be measured by [CONTACT_556886]. 
An acceptable alternative is to use a stopwatch to determine the time interv als, in 
which case the stopwatch will be stopped at the beginning of a pause and re -
started as the procedure resumes .  
 Polyps observed during insertion will not be removed or marked with biopsies or 
color.  
 Polyp size will be measured by [CONTACT_556887]  
 All polyps detected during withdrawal will be removed  (except for complicated 
polipectomies – see below) , irrespective of size, color or subjective interpretation, 
with the possible exception of very small (<2mm) polyps  or clusters of rec tal 
polyps as described above.   
 After detection of a polyp, chromoendoscopy  (e.g. NBI) can be used for polyp 
characterization.  
 Images of detected polyps will be taken in 3 states: iScan1, iScan2, after removal. 
Complicated polypectomies can be performed  in a different session. The detection 
of the lesion will be noted in the files, and the histology results will  be taken from  
the polypectomy phase. Such cases should be noted in the study files.  
 Withdrawal times should be targeted to a minimum of 6 minutes . Withdrawal 
times of less than 5 minutes will be regarded as a violation of the protocol.  
 All removed polyps have to  be clearly marked and sent to histology.   
 Patients will be followed up in either short term scheduled visit  (for instance 
following histolo gy results) or via telephone call within [ADDRESS_731404] -
procedure, to assess safety.  Follow up during either phone call or visit will be 
noted in patient study files.

8. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
8.1 Study Design and Objectives:  
This is a multicenter,  two-arm, randomized , open -label   study  intended  to compare the 
detection rate obtained by [CONTACT_746]  G-EYE™ colonoscopy vs. the detection rate 
obtained by  [CONTACT_556891] y.  
8.2 Study Endpoints : 
8.2.1 Primary Performance Endpoint:  
The primary performance measure will  be the detection rate of adenomas and 
serrated lesions combined (DR)  which is defined as the percentage of subjects 
with at least one relevant lesion  found, in each of the study groups.  
  
             
 
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Investigation Plan   
Page 18 of 37 
Doc.  G-EYE  [ZIP_CODE], Rev. 01  
 
 
 
  
 
 8.2.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints include:  
 Time to reach cecum,  
 Withdrawal (of device) time,  
 Total procedure time,  
 Number of polyps , 
 Number of adenomas   
 Other finding s (including mass, bleeding,  stricture, inflammation etc.)  
8.2.3 Safety Endpoints  
 Incidences of known  complications that may result from the pro cedure are 
similar to those relevant to standard endoscopy and include, but may not 
be limited to: perforation, hemorrhage and septicemia/infection.  
 All adverse event s and complications  
8.3 Study hypothesis:  
Null Hypothesis:   Psc = P G-EYE 
Alternative Hypot hesis:  Psc ≠ P G-EYE 
Where Psc is the ADR in subjects who undergo standard colonoscopy, and P G-EYE is the DR in 
subjects who undergo G -EYE™ colonoscopy.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_731407] the above described null hypothesis with  80% 
power at a 5% level of significance. From the literature it is known that the adenoma 
detection rate is 24%. If we power this study to detect a 35% increase in the DR with 
the G -EYE™ colonoscopy  then 450 subjects will be required per study group, for a 
total sample size of 900 subjects.  To allow for a potential 10% drop out rate we  will 
enroll 500 patients in each group, for a total of 1000  subjects . 
8.5 Randomization : 
After a subject meets the eligibility criteria, he/she will be equally allocated (wi th a 
1:1 ratio) to one of the following 2 treatment groups based on a randomization scheme 
with blocks stratified by [CONTACT_384]:  
 Group A : Subjects will undergo a G -EYE™ colonoscopy.  
  
             
 
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Investigation Plan

8.6 Blinding : 
NR to open label study.  
 
8.7 Data Analysis Sets : 
8.7.1 Intent to Treat (ITT) analysis set : 
The ITT analysis set will consist of all subject s randomized. In accordance with the 
ITT principle, all subjects randomized who were found eligible for the study  will be 
kept in their originally assigned treatment group.  
8.7.2 Per protocol (PP) analysis set : 
The per -protocol analysis set will consist of  all subjects who complete the study 
without major protocol violations ; a list of protocol violations that are considered 
major will be prepared before statistical analysis is performed.  
8.7.3 Statistical Analysis of analysis sets : 
The ITT analysis set wil l serve as the main set for performance  and safety 
assessments.  
The primary performance  assessment will also be performed on the PP analysis set  
8.8 Statistical Analysi s: 
8.8.1 General Considerations  
 
Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® v9.3 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary 
NC, [LOCATION_003]).  
Baseline demographic and other baseline characteristics, together with safety analyses 
will be performed on all enrolled subjects. Baseline values are defined as the last valid 
value prior to treatment.  
Study result s will be presented in tables and graphs when relevant. Continuous 
variables will be summarized by a mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and 
maximum, and categorical variables by a count and percentage  
The required significance level of findings will  be 5%. All statistical tests will be two -
sided.  If statistical tests are performed nominal p -values will be presented. Where

9. ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1 Reporting re quirements  
Timely and complete reporting of Adverse Events (AE) and safety assessment allows:  
 Protection of safety of study subjects.  
 Greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the study treatment.  
 Appropriate modification of study protocols an d improvement in study 
design and procedures.

 9.2 Definitions:  
Adverse Events (AE)  
AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject. This definition does 
not imply that there is a relationship between the adverse event and the device under 
investigation.  An AE can therefore be any unfa vorable and unintended sign, 
symptom, laboratory observations or disease temporally associated with the use of the 
investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational product. The 
following should be reported as AE:  
 Untoward medical cond itions or signs or symptoms that were absent before 
starting study treatment.  
 Untoward medical conditions or signs or symptoms present before starting 
study treatment and worsen (increase severity or frequency) after starting 
study treatment.  
 Abnormal labo ratory value or test.  
 Clinical signs or symptoms that require therapy.  
Device Related Adverse Events  
Device Related Adverse Events are defined as any untoward medical occurrence not 
present at baseline which is suspected of being related to the investigati onal device.  
Device -Related AE’s MUST also be reported by [CONTACT_215897] 
24 hours of investigator's awareness of the event. The reporting should then be 
followed up by [CONTACT_236442] [ADDRESS_731411] (ADE)  
ADE is defined as any untoward and unintended response to a medical device. This 
definition includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the 
instruction s for use or the deployment of the device, and any event that is a result of a 
user error.  Therefore, some adverse device effects may be related to device failure, 
malfunction or misuse.  
 
Device failures, Malfunctions and Misuse  
Investigators are instruct ed to report all possible device failures, malfunctions or 
misuse observed during the course of the trial. These incidents will be documented in 
the case report form provided as follows:  
  
             
 
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Investigation Plan   
Page [ADDRESS_731412] (UADE)  
An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) is defined as any serious adverse 
effect on health or safety or any the life -threatening problem or death caused by [CONTACT_556895], frequency or severity. 
UADEs may also include other serious problems associated with the device that  affect 
the rights or welfare of study subjects.   
 
Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
A SAE is an adverse event that:  
1.     Led to a death,  
2.     Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that:  
        a.     Resulted in a life -threatening i llness or injury  
        b.     Resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function  
        c.     Required in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_556855]  
d. Resulted in medical or surgical interve ntion to prevent permanent 
impairment to body structure or a body function.  
  3.       Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
 
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  
A Serious Adverse Device Effect is an adverse event  caused by [CONTACT_556896] a serious adverse event or that might have led to any of these 
consequences if suitable action had not been taken or interven tion had not been made 
or if circumstances had been less opportune.  
 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE)   
An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) is defined as any serious adverse 
effect on health or safety or any life -threatening proble m or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or

 application (including a supplementary plan or application), or a ny other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, 
safety, or welfare of subjects.  
9.[ADDRESS_731413] be listed on the appropriate eCRF  page . All AEs will be 
characterized by [CONTACT_4868]:    
 Intensity or Severity  
 Relatedness  
 Outcome  
 Treatment or Action Taken  
 
Intensity or Severity  
The following categories of the intensity of an adverse event are to be used:  
Mild - Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the patient’s usu al 
activity or is transient, resolved without treatment and with no sequelae.  
Moderate  - Interferes with the patient’s usual activity and/or requires symptomatic 
treatment.  
Severe  - Symptom(s) causing severe discomfort and significant impact of the 
patient ’s usual activity and requires treatment.  
 
Relatedness  
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship to the 
device:  
Not related  - The cause of the AE is known and the event is not related to any aspect 
of study participatio n. 
Possibly related  - There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_28224].  
The AE has a timely relationship to the study procedure(s); however, follows no 
known pattern of response, and an alternative cause seems m ore likely or there is 
significant uncertainty about the cause of the event.  
Probably related  - It is likely that the event was caused by [CONTACT_28224].  
The AE has a timely relationship to the study procedure(s) and follows a known 
pattern of respon se; a potential alternative cause, however, may explain the event.  
Related  - A related event has a strong temporal relationship and an alternative cause 
is unlikely.  
 
Outcome  
The clinical outcome of the AE or SAE will be characterized as follows:  
Death  - The SAE eCRF must be completed for this outcome  
Recovered without sequelae  - The patient returned to baseline status  
  
             
 
CONFIDENTIAL Clinical Investigation Plan   
Page 25 of 37 
Doc.  G-EYE  [ZIP_CODE], Rev. 01  
 
 
 
  
 
 Ongoing  - Patient did not recover and symptoms continue;  
Recovered with sequelae  - The patient has recovered but with clinical sequelae from  
the event  
Unknown - The patient outcome is unknown  
 
Treatment or Action taken  
The treatment or action taken after the occurrence of an AE or SAE will be reported 
as: 
Interventional Treatment  - Surgical, percutaneous or other procedure  
Medical Treatment  - Medication dose reduction/interruption or discontinuation, or 
medication initiated for event  
None  - No action is taken

The reporting should then be followed up by [CONTACT_236442] 5 days, using 
the Serious Adverse Event form in the study file.  
In accordance with European regulations, all investigators will be notified of the 
occurrence  of serious unexpected AEs, if such AEs are associated with the use of the 
study device (i.e., if there is a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_556897]). The investigator must inform the relevant 
Medical Ethics Committee according the applicable national procedures.  
 
It is also the responsibility of the investigator to inform the representative of the 
appropriate local Ethics Co mmittee, within 24 hours of investigator's  awareness of the 
event. A copy of the report cover letter will be filed with the subject’s medical file.

10. STUDY MONITORING  
Study monitoring activities will include study initiation visits, interim site monitoring 
visits and close -out visit.  The study initiation visit enables the study monitor and/or 
sponsor to review thoroughly the  study protocol and case report forms with the 
investigator's staff, in order to assure that the investigator understands the Clinical 
Study Protocol, including records and reports, has sufficient background, facilities, 
subject load, time, and willingness  to comply with the study requirements; submits the 
Clinical Study Protocol to the Ethics Committee for review and approval, maintains 
all correspondence, the Clinical Study Protocol, and all required records on file; and 
submits required reports, assumes responsibility for the investigation at her/his 
institution, which may include supervision of some tasks; and has sufficient 
experience with the study population.  
Interim site monitoring visits will be scheduled depending on the rate of subject 
enrollment.  During the interim site monitoring visits the following treatments will be 
followed; the monitor will review the case report forms of each subject in the study to 
make certain that the data provided are accurate and obtained in the manner specified 
in the  protocol.  The subjects' clinical records will be reviewed to confirm th at the 
case report form data is  consistent with the investigator clinical records, the 
background data and concurrent medication are documented in the case report forms, 
and that ther e is an accurate account of the use of the study device in the treatment.   
The site Study Regulatory binder and other study documents will be reviewed.  The 
subjects' clinical records will be reviewed to determine whether recording of adverse 
events has b een omitted in the case report forms.  If this is found to be so, the case 
report forms will be returned to the investigator and corrected to include this 
information. During the course of the study, the monitor shall be available to discuss, 
in person or by [CONTACT_756], questions regarding adverse effects, removal of subjects 
from the study, conduct of the study, etc.  At the completion or termination of this 
study a close -out visit will be conducted.  
  
11. REGULATORY AND HEALT H AUTHORITY AUDITS  
The European Uni on’s authorities and/or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
and/or the local state health authorities may request access to all study records, 
including source documents for inspection. The investigator  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_556856]. The investigator  must notify the sponsor  of 
any health authority audit as soon as notification of such audit is made. A 
representative or designee of the sponsor  may also conduct similar audits and may be 
present during health authority audi t.

Page [ADDRESS_731418] / STUDY DISC ONTINUATION  (DROP OUT CRITERIA)  
Subjects should be removed from the study whenever considered necessary for their 
welfare or when the subject expresses a desire to withdraw from the study . Non -
compliance with the protocol, the occurrence of a Serious Adverse Event or any 
medical condition that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], warrants discontinuation 
from the study for the safety of the subject , may necessitat e discontinuing a subject. If 
a subject is discontinued, the reason must be entered on the case report form and 
signed by [CONTACT_093]. In case of any questionable situation, the study monitor or 
Smart Medical Systems  Ltd. personnel should be consulted . When a subject is 
removed from the study as a result of Serious Adverse Event, a final physical 
examination must be performed. Subjects removed from the study because of an 
adverse event will be followed -up until the adverse event has been resolved.  
 
In the case that the occurrence of adverse events is greater than anticipated, the 
clinical investigation will be suspended; in such a case, a safety committee will be 
arranged to decide if the study could be continued. The Ethics Committee will be 
notified a nd the results of the safety committee discussions will be brought for the EC 
review and decision.  
 
Smart Medical Systems  Ltd., reserves the right to discontinue any study for 
administrative reasons at any time, such as, but not limited to a decision to 
discontinue further clinical investigation with the device, improper conduct of the 
study by [CONTACT_093], inability to obtain the number of subjects required by [CONTACT_12695], etc.  Reimbursements for reasonable expenses will be made if such an action 
is necessary.  
In the following cases, subjects will be withdrawn from the study:  
 Technical error or  device  malfunction  
 Inadequate bowel preparation  (score <2 in one or more colon segments, 
according to BBPS ). In such case patient can also be rescheduled for a 
secondary session. In such case patient will not be re -randomized.  
 Any medical condition revealed during the examination that might  require 
cease of treatment for medical reasons  or affect study outcome  
 Patient having more than 20 polyps  
 
The following c ases will be considered as screening failure  and will also be 
withdrawn from the study : 
 Polyposis that was revealed during the examination  
 Bowel obstruction

18.1 Data handling procedure – Data review and Queries resolution  
 
18.1.1  eCRF  
 An Electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF) will be completed for each subject 
enrolled into the clinical study, to record and transmit all information collected 
in the study. The Investigator will review, approve and electronically sign/date 
each completed eCRF; the Investigator’s signature [CONTACT_556909]’s responsibility for ensuring that all clinical and laboratory data 
entered on the eCRF are complete, accurate and authentic.   Access to t he 
eCRF will be given by [CONTACT_556902] [INVESTIGATOR_556857] . 
 It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that eCRFs are legible and 
completely filled in.  
 Errors must be corrected . History of changes including wh o performed the 
change and date of change will be kept in the study  database . An investigator 
or any personnel signature [CONTACT_556910] [CONTACT_556903]. No other person 
is permitted to sign for the investigator. The signature [CONTACT_556911] [CONTACT_556904].  
Patients will be identified only by [CONTACT_79166].  
 If an assessment is not done or not known or otherwise unavailable, indicate 
this by [CONTACT_565] “ "Unkno wn"in the respective answer field of the eCRF.  If the 
question is irrelevant (e.g. not applicable to the subject), indicate this by 
[CONTACT_565] “N/A” (Not Applicab le) in the respective answer field of the eCRF.

  It is anticipated that relevant sections of the eCRF will be completed by [CONTACT_556905] [ADDRESS_731419] data, and other information contained in Source Documents.  Source 
Documents are the original records (and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_63062]); 
including, but not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_38109],  physician or office 
charts, physician or nursing  notes, subject diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, x -
rays, etc.  Information recorded on the eCRF may be considered as Source 
Data only when Data is collected for trial purposes  
18.1.[ADDRESS_731420] identifier code (patient code) will be given by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_556858].  This code will be applied on documentation relating to each 
subject, namely, eCRF, Informed Consent form and CDs.   Also, this will also 
be used for transferring, repo rting processing and analysis of data.  The 
investigator 's iPad will include Subject identification list with the personal 
information of each Subject and will be accessible using a personal username 
[CONTACT_2383]. When printed, the list will be kept in clo sed envelop to protect 
subjects’ confidentially.  
18.1.[ADDRESS_731421] name [CONTACT_556912], publications, or other disclosures of clinical study outcomes.  
18.1.5  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_556859].   The CRA will issue query form when unclear information and/or 
significant deviation lab result or other information from previous visit occur.  
18.1.6  The Study Coordinator will deal with the query form requirements no later 
than two w eeks from date of query receipt and will send the query resolution 
to the CRA.  Should new information becomes available the Study 
Coordinator  will update the database accordingly . 
 
 
18.2 Data retention

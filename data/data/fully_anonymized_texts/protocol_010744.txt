4. OBJECTIVES * 
The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of Animal Assisted Intervention wildlife 
activities on veterans with PTSD. The specific aims of this study are to explore a series of 
wildlife animal -assisted interventions with [ADDRESS_614049] PTSD/ PTSD symptoms in 
order to:  
1. Determine the feasibility, safety and acceptability of the interventions to ensure adequacy of 
each intervention for a larger RCT.  Outcomes will be measured by [CONTACT_478514], 
rate of adverse events, activity surveys and focus groups.  
2. Obtain preliminary estimates of the wildlife  AAI on physiologic and psychological well -
being and a ssess relative efficacy of the three interventions. Outcomes will be measured by 
[CONTACT_77514]-5,23, 24 Warwick -Edinburgh Mental -Well Being Scale,44, 45 Speilberger State/Trait 
Anxiety Inventory46 and Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6326] (CES -D-10) scale.47 
Physiologic measures include heart rate variability. 49 
3. Obtain preliminary estimates of connectedness to nature and wildlife through the short -form 
Nature -Relatedness (NR -6)50 and Human -Wildlife Bridging Feelings of Valuation Scale.20    
 
5. BACKGROUND * 
Introduction  
Human -animal interactions within a variety of settings and populations have shown positive 
health benefits.1 While the field of human -animal interaction is very promising there is need for a 
more rigorous evidence base.2,3 Research on human -animal interactions has primarily been done 
with domesticated animals such as pets. We propose a novel approach using a series of wildlife 
activities for veterans suffering from PTSD following their military duty. The activities will be

Significance: Human -Animal Interaction and Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder in Military 
Veterans  
Animal -assisted intervention (AAI) has been defined as, "any intervention that intentionally 
includes or incorporates animals as part of a therapeutic or ameliorative process or milieu."4, p.36 
AAI includes the use of animals within specific therapeutic interventions (Animal -Assisted 
Therapy), less structured activities with animals (Animal -Assisted Activities) and use of trained 
animals to assist with daily activities (Service/Assistance Animals)[ADDRESS_614051] sizes: medical conditions, autism -spectrum symptoms, behavioral problems, and emotional 
well-being.[ADDRESS_614052]-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD  is a psychiatric disorder that can occur in people 
who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event such as a serious accident, rape or other 
violent personal assault or war/ combat.[ADDRESS_614053] anyone but has been particularly 
concerning among veterans suffering from wartime trauma. The prevalence of PTSD in veterans 
who served in recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ranges from 13.5 -30% with an estimated 
500,000 U.S. troops diagnosed with PTSD.6 Symptoms of PTSD include intrusive thoughts or 
flashbacks to the traumatic event, avoiding reminders of the event such as people or places, 
negative thoughts or feelings, and arousal/ reactive symptoms such as irritable outbursts and self -
destructive behavior.5 PTSD is potentially a very debilitating condition that is associated with a 
higher risk of suicidal behavior, particularly among young, female and rural veterans. In addition 
to suicide, struggles with substance abuse and homelessness are significant prob lems for the 
population of veterans with PTSD.6 Stigma is a major barrier to receiving treatment for PTSD; 
studies suggest that less than half of veterans with PTSD seek treatment within the first year.[ADDRESS_614054] been utilized as complementary approaches that may 
alleviate this barrier due to “the nonjudgmental nature of human -animal interactions.”7 
A systematic review conducted in 2015 found 10 studies on the use of AAI in trauma using 
dogs, horses and/ or farm animals.  Only two of these focused on war trauma. The studies 
suggested that AAI was a promising complementary therapy, particularly in redu cing PTSD 
symptoms, depression and anxiety, but that more rigorous studies are needed.[ADDRESS_614055].6 In sum, HAI offers a promising approach for 
individuals suffering from war trauma but additional research is needed.6,8,9 Given the practical 
challenges obtaining trained service dogs, it will be important to study modalities with other 
animals.   
Scientific Premise: Wildlife and Health  
The contemporary human disconnect from nature is an increasing health concern.10,[ADDRESS_614056] focused on domesticated animals. Yet there are

 Page 3 of 30 Template Revised 8/8/[ADDRESS_614057] feeding/ watching. Bird 
feeding has been linked with positive psychological benefits through feelings of pleasure and 
increased connectedness to nature. Self -reported well -being was associated with increased 
species diversity at feeder and familiarity with different species.[ADDRESS_614058] abundance (time of day when people were 
more likely to be outdoors experiencing birds) with reduced self -reported depression, anxiety 
and stress.16  Brock et al. found that individuals who fed birds developed a “warden attitude” of 
concern for the birds that visited their own feeder.[ADDRESS_614059] -feeding hobby[CONTACT_478515]’s area 
(84%); wanting to  help birds (79%) and relaxation or therapy (65%)[ADDRESS_614060] visit. The study also tested a new instrument developed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_478475] (Cronbach’s 
alpha=.837 -.940). [ADDRESS_614061] 
spendin g more time outdoors as well as environmental/ wildlife stewardship for both 
children and adults.[ADDRESS_614062] wildlife and habitat conservation.  
Theory -Guided Intervention: Wildlife Immersion Activities  
The study will be guided by [CONTACT_978]’s theory of transcendent pluralism which is grounded in 
mutually evolving human and ecological dignity.20, 31, 32 Wildlife experiences are viewed as 
pluralistic encounters that influence wonder and transcendence. In many Native American 
traditions each species of animal is viewed as having its own qualities that offer teachings for 
humans.33, 34 Thus a variety of species may meet different human needs.  
The activities that comprise the interventions will be framed within the concept, “Embodied 
spatial -temporal interaction”, which emerged from the PIs prior study on wildlife 
rehabilitation.[ADDRESS_614063] be respected when 
conducting AAI to avoid animal stress. Engagement in shared wildlife space requires 
H00016795 : Wildlife and Wellbeing

INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN - REQUIRED  
 
 Page 4 of 30 Template Revised 8/8/2017  attentiveness to one’s own spatial relationship to the animal. Safe space is also important for 
humans. There is a permeable boundary between humans and wildlife.36 Wildlife rehabilitation 
and sanctuary care offer a healing window across this boundary. Study activities will be guided 
by [CONTACT_478516]. Activities will also 
be framed within the natural rhythms  of the seasons to be in synchronicity with animal needs. 
For example, spring is when baby w ildlife may be orphaned and require human care. Thus, each 
intervention for this study is designed as an immersion  activity experience within the space of a 
wildlife setting rather than a discrete action. The experience occurs in a wildlife -rich space and 
may include multiple interactions with diverse animal species over a period of time. We define a 
wildlife immersion activity as an embodied spatial -temporal experience in which human 
participants enter a space (setting) in which they consciously engage wit h wildlife in a 
manner that affirms the dignity of both human and animal with respect for natural 
rhythms.  Wildlife immersion experiences are designated as animal -assisted activities  (in 
contrast to animal -assisted therapy which entails formal therapeutic treatment).2

10. STUDY ENDPOINTS * 
• The primary outcome measures are from study Aim I: Feasibility and safety of 
intervention will be measured through ongoing observation and safety logs and 
monitoring of recruitment/ retention.  Acceptability will be assessed with activity 
evaluation survey s, focus groups at study conclusion and a follow -up personal interview/ 
phone call  to assess bird feeder use.  
 
• The secondary outcome measures are from Aim II and Aim III: Psychological well -being 
will be assessed at baseline and after each activity through : Warwick -Edinburgh Mental -
Well Being Scale (14 item; α=.91)44, 45, Speilberger State/Trait Anxiety Inventory (6 
item; α=.82)46 and Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6326] (CES -D-10) scale (10

There are no safety endpoints.  
11. PROCEDURES INVOLVED * 
Approach  
The feasibility nature of this study offers flexibility to evaluate a series of immersion activities. 
We will use a crossover design in which each participant receives a sequence of [ADDRESS_614067] been 
shown to reduce fear and enhance self efficacy about managing encounters with wildlife.38, 39 
Each activity will be conducted twice  to minimize potential anxiety and novelty effects. 
Activities will be planned in small groups ( up to 10 participants) to provide more concentrated 
experience at facilities and peer support. We will endeavor to maintain same groups throughout 
although logistical m odification may sometimes be needed.  
Activities (see protocol below for detailed outline) include: Introductory Forest Walk : A 
guided forest walk will be conducted to control for effects of nature alone; Wildlife Immersion 
Activity  I: Participants will experience wildlife through a wildlife rehabilitation setting in which 
they engage in activities such as feeding baby [CONTACT_478519]; Wildlife Immersion 
Activity  II: Participants will experience wildlife through observation of iconic wildlife at a 
wildlife park/ sanctuary and accompanyin g game keepers during feeding/enrichment; and 
Wildlife Immersion Activity III:  Participants will experience wildlife in the natural setting 
through bird feeding and watching. This activity is designed to transition to a sustainable home 
activity that veterans can continue following study conclusion. After an initial training at Mass  
Audubon we will provide individual bird feeders to participants as well as c ommunity bird 
feeders at the indicated Soldier On  facilities . Bird identification education and books  will be 
provided. All settings also have self -guided educational displays so free time will be included in 
each session to facilitate each participant’s transcendent inquiry as part of the wildlife immersion 
experience. The time between each set of activi ties will be spaced by [CONTACT_478520] a 
washout period  to reduce any carryover effect.[ADDRESS_614068] walk will show a 
small improvement over baseline measures at enrollment (due to nature effect) and that each 
animal activity will s how an additional improvement above the forest walk (nature plus animal).

Scientific Rigor  
Literature on HAI research has identified several methodological issues with recommendations 
to address these including: detailed procedures for future replicability, unbiased outcome 
measures, independent researcher/ intervention teams, provisions for animal welfare and hu man 
safety3,9 and addressing novelty as a confounder.40 Two additional concerns not appreciated in 
the literature are: (a) need to address nature itself as potential confounder due to health benefits 
from nature contact [INVESTIGATOR_1238] (b) sustainability; i.e. many re ported studies describe interventions that 
may not be feasible for participants to continue. Table 1 outlines our strategies to address these 
issues.

Measures  
We will utilize both quantitative and qualitative measures to assess parameters from study aims 
guided by a unitary -transformative paradigm of integrated bio -psycho -social -spi[INVESTIGATOR_478478].41,42  
Aim I:  Feasibility and safety of intervention will be monitored through ongoing observation and 
safety logs and monitoring of recruitment/ retention.  Acceptability will be assessed with 
evaluation surveys after each activity, focus groups at study conclusion an d a follow -up phone / 
in-person  interview to assess bird feeder use 4-6 weeks after final study activity . The activity and 
focus group questions will be framed using transcendental method, a cognitive approach 
developed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_478479] p rior studies.43  
Aim II:  Psychological measures will be conducted at baseline and after each activity to reduce 
learning effects . Psychological well -being will be assessed through Warwick -Edinburgh Mental -
Well Being Scale (14 item; α=.91)44, 45, Speilberger State/Trait Anxiety Inventory (6 item; 
α=.82)46 and Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6326] (CES -D-10) scale (10 item; α=.70).[ADDRESS_614079] biosensor will be 
measured at baseline and before and 5 minutes after each activity. Noninvasive stress markers 
such as heart rate  are preferable as they reduce stress induced by [CONTACT_478523]49 as well as being consistent with a nature -focused intervention. We will 
also obtain a measure of PTSD symptoms through administering the PCL -5 at baseline and  at 
study conclusion.23, 24   
Aim III:  Connection to nature and wildlife will be measured with the short -form Nature -
Relatedness (NR -6) (6 item; α=.85 -.96)50 and Transcendent Feelings of Animal Valuation Scale 
developed by [CONTACT_976] (7 item; α=84 -.94)20 at baseline and after each activity.   Qualitative assessment 
will include an animal observation  journal exercise during the Maine Wildlife Park activities.

mindfulness.54 Applying the resulting design effect55 of 1+.0105×(10 -1)=1.0945 and 80% 
retention rate yields an effective sample size of 40/1.0945=36 participants. With an overall 0.05 
Type I error rate and a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (6 pairwise comparisons of the 
4 activities), and 80% pow er, we will be able to detect a statistically significant mean within -
participant between -activity difference in an outcome, e.g., anxiety, of 0.[ADDRESS_614081] deviation of within -participant change in the outcome. The corresponding 
detectable within -participant change from baseline to end of study or baseline versus each 
individual activity (no corrections for multiple testing), is 0.48 SD.    
Statistical analyses:   
Aim 1 : To assess feasibility, we will estimate quantities relevant for study planning, including 
outcome standard deviations and within -participant and within -group correlations, and rates of 
attrition and missing data and their correlates. Acceptability of eac h activity will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_478525]. Safety for each activity will be assessed via the per -
participant distribution of incidents reported by [CONTACT_926].  Analyses will be conducted for the full 
sample as well as by [CONTACT_478526].   
Aim 2 : We will conduct preliminary intent -to-treat analyses comparing participant outcomes 
across activities and baseline using linear mixed modeling56 with a random effect for participant 
group and accounting for within -participant correlation over time. In addition, the role of novelty 
for each activity will be estimated as within -participant differences in physiologic outcomes 
between the first and se cond time that activity is conducted. To the extent possible given sample 
sizes, we will adjust for parti cipant characteristics predictive of missing data to reduce 
nonresponse bias.[ADDRESS_614082] modification; by [CONTACT_100827], the latter analyses will 
be exploratory.   
Aim 3 : Analyses parallel to those in Aim 2 will compare participants’ connectedness to nature 
and wildlife across activities.  Additional exploratory analyses will examine whether 
connectedness to nature and wildlife mediates between -activity differences in wel l-being in Aim 
2 analyses.

Baseline measures  collected will include:  
• Demographic information: age; gender; race, ethnicity, education, branch of service; 
tours of deployment; medical history; substance use; medications; allergies  
• Physiologic measures: heart rate; noninvasive stress markers such as heart rate are 
preferable as they reduce stress induced by [CONTACT_478543]48 
• Psychological measures

• Animal observation journal exercise during Maine Wildlife Park visits  
Pre/Post activity measures  will include:  
Physiological measures ( heart rate before and after every activity  at each site ) 
Psychological survey measures (after activity at each site)  
Study conclusion:  Focus groups and PCL -5 
4-6 week  F/U after final study activity : Phone / in person  interview  
All scales will be completed on paper surveys, collected by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_205557] a locked research 
office.   
Confidentiality:  The following steps will be taken to ensure that all patient data remain 
confidential.  
(1) Use of numeric identifiers:  To ensure confidentiality, study assessments and electronically 
stored data will be identified only by a unique identifier. The master list linking the patient 
ID to the patient’s identifying information will be maintained in a separate file and will be 
destroyed at the conclusion of the study. Signed consent forms will be kept in locked filing 
cabinets and will only be accessible to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_478491].  
(2) During study activities partici pants will be provided with a name [CONTACT_478551] . If there are two 
individuals with the same first name [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a cohort the initial of the last name [CONTACT_478552].  
 
(3) Data storage :  
Recruitment data will be entered into a UMass Chan Research Drive using an encrypted laptop 
maintained by [CONTACT_478544] , contact [CONTACT_478545].  This file will be destroyed at study conclusion.  The screening data file will 
contain an ID number that will correspond to research data files but kept separately.   Audio files 
will be securely transferred with encryption or via a UMMS IT sanctioned method, such as Move 
IT. Audio files will be destroyed once the transcriptions are checked for quali ty. 
 
Activity data will be collected by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_478504]. Post activity data will 
include written surveys, journal entries, and heart rate records. Data will be collected by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_478505].

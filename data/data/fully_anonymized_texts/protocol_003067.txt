Title of Study:  A Phase 3  Randomized, Observer -Blind, Multi -center, Controlled Study 
to Evaluate Safety, Immunogenicity , and Lot-to-Lot Consistency of an Adjuvanted Cell 
Culture -Derived, H5N1 Subunit Influenza Virus  Vaccine in Healthy Adult Subjects ≥18 
years of Age  
Study Period:   The study period for each 
subject  will be approximately 13  months.  Clinical Phase:  Phase 3 
Rationale: H5N1 type influenza virus is a specific strain that resulted in rapid spread of 
influenza in birds and poultry (bird flu ) across Asia, Europe and Africa. This strain has 
been associated with 637 human cases documented from 2003 through 2013, with a case 
fatality rate of 59% (WHO 2013). Widespread circulation, pathogenicity and direct 
transmission of avian viruses to humans suggest that H5N1 has important pandemic 
potential, increased by [CONTACT_299883]. The S ponsor  is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a n 
adjuvanted monovalent inactivated subunit vaccine against the H5N1 strain, as the 
availability of a vaccine (even if incompletely ma tched to the pandemic virus) in the 
early stages of a pandemic may prevent more infections and deaths than waiting for 
completely matched pandemic vaccines to be produced and distributed. The production 
of the viral antigen components is based on cell cult ure technology. This production 
process has been used for the production of Optaflu® (trivalent seasonal influenza 
vaccine, licensed in EU, and in the US under the trade name [CONTACT_299971]™) and Celtura® 
(monovalent, adjuvanted, pandemic H1N1 vaccine, licensed  in [LOCATION_013] and other 
countries).  
Proprietary MF59® squalene -based oil -in-water emulsion adjuvant has been studied in a 
number of influenza vaccine formulations, and is included in a trivalent seasonal vaccine 
licensed for elderly adults in Europe, Fluad® , and in the registered cell culture -derived 
2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccine, Celtura®. MF59 enhances the immune response in these 
seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines and has a well -established safety profile . 
More than [ADDRESS_366008] been 
distributed in licensed products.  
The MF59 -adjuvanted cell culture derived H5N1 vaccine (hereafter referred to as 
aH5N1c) has been  tested in three  Phase 2 studies (V89_04, V89_13 and V89_11 ) in 
adult , elderly adult,  and pedi atric subjects , respectively .  These studies evaluate d 
aH5N1c in two dosage levels, 7.5  mcg + 0.25 mL MF59 (full dose) and  3.75 mcg +

0.125  mL MF59 (half dose), in order to determine the lowest effective  dose for each 
target population. Results from thes e phase [ADDRESS_366009] led to the selection of  the 
higher dose  for the Phase 3 study in a healthy adult  and elderly adult  population.  
The purpose of this Phase 3 study is to evaluate the safety , immunogenicity  and lot-to-
lot consistency of 3 lots of aH5N1c  vaccine in approximately 2394  healthy adults ≥18 
years of age  receiving the vaccine . Subjects will be randomized in  a 3:1 ratio to receive 
either aH5N1c vaccine or saline placebo. Enrollment will be stratified by [CONTACT_654]: 18 to <65 
years of age and   ≥65 years of age , to allow adequate safety a ssessment of the entire age 
spectrum. In addition,  both age cohort s will be evaluated for immunogenicity according 
to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research ( CBER ) and the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) criteria  (CBER 2007,  CHMP 2003, CHMP 
2006) . 
Primary Objectives  
Co-Primary Immunogenicity Objective s:  
To demonstrate lot -to-lot consistency across three consecutively prod uced lots of  
aH5N1c vaccine, as assessed by [CONTACT_299884] (GMTs)  of 
hemagglutinati on inhibition (HI) antibody responses to the H5N1 vaccine strain 3 weeks 
after the second vaccine administration  (Day 43) in healthy adult subjects ≥ 18  years of 
age. 
After lot -to-lot consistency is demonstrated, the popul ations of all H5N1 c vaccine 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_299865] t o evaluate immune responses to aH5N1c vaccine 
according to immunogenicity criteria defined by [CONTACT_299885]  3 weeks after the 
second  vaccine administration  (Day 43)  as measured by [CONTACT_299886] -specific 
HI assay . 
Primary Safety Objective : To evaluate the safety and tolerability of  aH5N1c vaccine 
and placebo in healthy  adult  subjects  ≥ 18 years of age.  
Secondary Objectives  
Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives:  If lot -to-lot consistency is demonstrated, the 
populations of vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_299866]5N1c lots will be pooled and the 
following objectives assessed:  
 To evaluate i mmune  responses to aH5N1c vaccine according to immunogenicity 
criteria defined by [CONTACT_299887] 3 weeks after the second vaccine

Statistical Analysis of Primary Objective s: 
Co-Primary Immunogenicity Objective s: The lot -to-lot cons istency will be claimed if 
the two -sided 95%  confidence intervals  (CIs) of all the three pairwise comparisons 
(GMT(Group A)/ GMT(Group B), GMT(Group A)/ GMT(Group C),  GMT(Group C)/ 
GMT(Group B)) fall within 0.6 67 and 1.5. Significance level to  all these tests is α = 5%, 
which needs no adjustment for multiplicity as all hypotheses have to be rejected 
(intersection -union test problem).  
With the proposed sample size, assuming a standard deviation of 0. 85 for the l og10 
antibody titers (for each va ccine lot), approximate pairwise equivalence of factor [ADDRESS_366025] based on 718  subjects per lot group has a power 
of 95%. The resulting overall power is approximately 86%, beca use the total number of 
comparisons is three . To account for dropouts ( approximately  10%), a total of n= 798 per 
lot should be recruited.  
After demonstrating success of the lot -to-lot consistency, the achievement of the CBER 
criteria (co-primary objective)  will be claimed  if the lower bound of the  two-sided 95% 
CI for the percent of subjects achieving an HI antibody titer ≥ 1:40 should meet or 
exceed 70%  or 60% (for subjects 18 - <65 years of age and subjects ≥65 years of age , 
respectively) for all lots pooled.  
With the proposed sample size of 1077 pe r age cohort and the assumed proportions 
based on previous studies, such as V89_04 and V89_13 the power to meet or exceed 
70% or 60% of the subjects achi eving an HI antibody titer ≥ 1:40 is 82% - > 99%  (based 
on the age cohort) . 
Primary Safety  Objective: There is no statistical null hypothesis associated with the 
safety objective, which will be analyzed descriptively.  
Planned A nalyses:  An interim analysis of  immunogenicity will be p erformed  for all 
subjects through the Day [ADDRESS_366026] will remain blinded to treatment assignments for this interim analysis.  
The final analysis will be performed when all data up to the study end (Day 387) are 
available. Analysis will be done on fully unblinded data set by [CONTACT_299893].  
Data Monitoring Committee: No Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) is planned in

Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 1.0  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
Study V89_18 is part of a program funded by [CONTACT_299894] 
S
ervices (DHHS) to develop a cell culture-derived influenza vaccine in accordance with 
the US Pandemic Preparedness Plan. This DHHS contract supports the evaluation of 
safety and effectiveness of the MF59™ adjuvant in a cell culture-derived pandemic 
influe
nza vaccine. If there is an H5N1 virus pandemic, the strategy of having a pre-
pa
ndemic H5N1 vaccine, even if incompletely matched to the pandemic H5N1 virus and 
pe
rhaps giving relatively low protection, may prevent more infections and deaths than 
waiting for completely matched pandemic H5N1 vaccines to be produced and distributed 
(Ferguson 2006).  
An inf
luenza pandemic occurs when a novel influenza virus emerges against which the 
vast majority of the world’s population has no immunity. Outbreaks of influenza in 
animals, especially when they occur during annual outbreaks in humans, result in the 
mer
ging of animal and human influenza viruses and increase the chances of a pandemic.  
This phenomenon has been observed only with influenza A viruses and results from the 
emergence of a new antigenic variant (antigenic shift) caused by [CONTACT_299895], with or without a concomitant change 
in neuraminidase, the other major surface antigen ( Treanor 2004 ). If such a virus 
demonstrates the ability to transmit efficiently from person to person, the result is a global 
outbreak of disease that affects a high percentage of individuals in a short period of time 
and is likely to cause substantially increased morbidity and mortality in all areas of the 
world.  
Over [ADDRESS_366041] devastating 
influenza pandemic in 1918, the so-called “Spanish flu”. The “Asian flu” of [ADDRESS_366042] to be developed, 
approved, and produced in very large quantities ( Fedson 2003 ). Preliminary findings have

Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, [ADDRESS_366043] outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza occurred in Asia 
(H
ong Kong). This strain re-emerged in [ADDRESS_366044] 2013 and 378 of these died, 
re
presenting a case fatality rate of 59.3% ( WHO 2013 ). Highly pathogenic avian 
influenza H5N1 viruses have not yet been detected among wild birds, domestic poultry, 
or
 humans in the [LOCATION_002]. 
The
 Sponsor is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a monovalent inactivated influenza vaccine that is adjuvanted 
with M
F59C.1 (MF59 proprietary adjuvant) and uses a surface antigen from a potential 
pa
ndemic H5N1 virus strain candidate (A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 (H5N1) NIBRG-23 
stra
in) to be tested in clinical studies. The MF59 adjuvant is an oil- in-water emulsion, 
composed mainly of squalene, which is an intermediate metabolite in the synthesis of 
c
holesterol. This vaccine contains the same MF59 adjuvant  
 
FLUAD is currently licensed in many European countries and other countries worldwide 
for active immunization against influenza in elderly (65 years of age and over), especially 
for those with an increased risk of associated complications (i.e., individuals affected by 
[CONTACT_299896], cardiovascular, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_3748]).  
F
LUAD is not licensed in the [LOCATION_002]. Since product launch in [ADDRESS_366045] been distributed worldwide.  
Previous clinical experience suggests that two doses of non-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza 
vaccine with 90μg of strain-specific hemagglutinin (HA) are necessary to achieve 
protective levels of antibodies in unprimed, immunologically naïve individuals, which 
represents 6 times the normal 15μg/dose required for the interpandemic seasonal 
influe
nza vaccine ( Treanor 2006 ). The use of an adjuvant, however, allows reducing the 
quantity of antigen per dose and would potentially lead to increased vaccine production 
capacities ( Nicholson 2001 ). Although it is unlikely that a single dose of the H5N1 
vaccine would be enough to achieve protective antibody levels even if the adjuvant is 
added.   
The observation of cross-reactive immune responses after vaccination with MF59-
adjuvanted H5N1 vaccines is potentially of great interest for the development of pre- 
pande
mic vaccines, since it suggests that the use of the MF59 adjuvant may ameliorate 
protection from H5N1 infection, even for H5N1 virus strains that have undergone 
antigenic drift.

PRO-01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 
Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Currently licensed pandemic and pre-pandemic vaccines are produced using the 
conventional egg-based manufacturing process. However, in the event of a new 
pandemic, there will be a dramatic increase of vaccine demand that will overwhelm 
global production capacity. Moreover, any condition that compromises availability of 
eggs (e.g. bird flu pandemic) will dramatically reduce production of influenza vaccines. 
Thus, increasing the availability of influenza vaccine to prevent the next pandemic can be 
viewed as largely dependent on developi[INVESTIGATOR_299868]. Clinical development of the 
cell culture-derived, MF59-adjuvanted H5N1 (aH5N1c) vaccine helps address the 
medic
al need of a safe and effective pandemic and pre-pandemic vaccine. 
The cell culture-derived process is not subject to the limitations of egg-based production 
a
nd will therefore be a major public health benefit in the scenario of a pandemic. 
Efficacy and safety of the aH5N1c vaccine needs to comply with stringent regulatory 
standards for new vaccines. The Sponsor has already conducted a Phase 1/2 dose ranging 
c
linical study (V89P1) under US-IND in healthy adults 18 to 40 years of age, using 12 
diff
erent adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted formulations of the cell culture-derived H5N1 
va
ccine. Immunogenicity results from this study assessed by [CONTACT_114772]-derived HI, SRH 
and MN assay demonstrated that formulations without the adjuvant did not meet any of 
the CBER criteria, while all formulations with 0.125mL (50%) or 0.25mL (100%) doses 
of the standard dose of MF59 achieved the CBER seroconversion criterion 3 weeks after 
the s
econd dose.  No formulation achieved the CBER criterion of HI titer ≥ 1:40 as the 
stud
y was not powered for this, although point estimate levels approached the 70% cut-
of
f.  Furthermore, for all pairwise comparisons at the same antigen level, formulations 
with adjuva
nt were more immunogenic 3 weeks after the second vaccination than those 
without adjuvant, when assessed as geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroconversion 
ra
tes (p < 0.001). These immunogenicity data clearly showed that the MF59 adjuvant is 
an essential component of the aH5N1c vaccine formulation, and is necessary to elicit an 
ade
quate immune response.  
Laboratory safety tests performed in a subset of 120 subjects from the V89P1 Phase 1/2 
stud
y did not raise any safety concerns. The aH5N1c vaccines were well tolerated in 
he
althy adults (18-40 years of age), and reactogenicity and safety results of all 12 vaccine 
groups in study V89P1 were similar. No dose-dependent safety issues or vaccine-related 
long
-term effects on safety were observed in this dose-ranging Phase 1 /[ADDRESS_366046] been performed evaluating 
“

After signing of the informed consent form (ICF),  eligible subjects will be enrolled in the 
stud
y after undergoing a review of their medical history and a physical examination,  
Vaccine administration will be performed in an observer-blind manner (i.e. efforts should 
be
 taken to shield the subject and blinded study team members from viewing vaccine 
a
dministration).   
After each vaccination, all subjects will remain under medical supervision at the study 
site for at least [ADDRESS_366051] solicited and unsolicited AEs, and medication/vaccinations 
given from Day 1 to Day 7 (inclusive) and from Day 22 to Day 28 (inclusive). From Day 
8 to 21 and from Day 29 to 42,  only unsolicited AEs, solicited AEs that continue beyond 
Day 7 or 28, respectively, and medications/ vaccinations will be collected at the time of 
re
turn to the clinic on Day 22 or 43, respectively. 
In 
addition to these safety data, from Day 1 through Day 387 (inclusive) serious adverse 
e
vents (SAEs), adverse events of special interest (AESIs), new onset of chronic disease 
(N
OCD), AEs leading to vaccine/study withdrawal, medically attended AEs, associated 
c
oncomitant medications for any of these events, and all vaccinations will be recorded. 
F
or full list of AESIs see appendix A . These data will be captured through the diary card, 
b

B
lood will be drawn from each subject for immunogenicity assessments before each 
vaccination (Day 1 and Day 22) and also drawn at clinic visits on Day 43 and Day 183.

Informed Consent  
"Informed consent" is the voluntary agreement of an individual to participate in research.  
Consent must be given with free will of choice, and without undue inducement.  The 
individual must have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the nature of the 
proposed research, the anticipated risks and potential benefits, and the requirements of the 
research to be able to make an informed decision. 
If a subject is unable to read, an impartial witness should be present during the entire 
infor
med consent discussion.  An impartial witness is defined as a person who is 
independent from trial conduct, who cannot be unfairly influenced by [CONTACT_299902], who attends the informed consent process if the subject or the subject's legally 
a
cceptable representative cannot read, and who reads the ICF and any other written 
information supplied to the subject.  After the written ICF and any other written 
infor
mation to be provided to the subject, is read and explained to the subject and after the 
subj
ect has verbally consented to the subject’s participation in the trial and, if capable of 
doing
 so, has signed and personally dated the ICF, the witness should sign and personally 
date the consent form. By [CONTACT_17317], the witness attests that the 
information in the ICF and any other written information was accurately explained to, and 
a
pparently understood by, the subject and that informed consent was freely given by [CONTACT_299903].

3.2.5  Visit Procedures 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pre-vaccination procedures 
The following procedures should be carried out at the clinic visits before the vaccinations 
on Day 1 and Day 22 are performed: 
1. B efore or on Day 1 clinic visit only:  
a. Obtain informed consent (see sections 3.2.1  and 12.2  ) 
b. P erform screening procedures (see section 3.2.2 ) 
2. On the  Day [ADDRESS_366059] has experienced across each organ system (see section 6.2 ) .   
4. P erform a general physical examination  (see section 6.2 ) 
5. P rivately review with females of childbearing potential their ability to become 
pregnant. Also verify that they will use/continue to use a reliable birth control method 
unti
l 3 weeks after the second vaccine administration. (see section 3.2.2 ). Determine 
the date of the subject’s last menstrual period. A pregnancy test will be performed on 
all female subjects of childbearing potential. If the pregnancy test is positive or 
indeterminate, the subject must not be vaccinated (see se ctions 3.5 , 3.8 and 6.6.4).  
6. On Day 1 clinic visit only:  
a. Enroll the subject (see to section 3.2.3) 
b. R andomize the subject (see to se ction 3.2.4 ) 
7. B ody temperature (preferably oral) must be measured on the day of vaccination. If it 
is  ≥38.0 °C (≥100.4 °F), vaccination must be postponed until three days after the

infe
ction (see section 4.3 ). 
8. The  use of analgesics and/or antipyretics is strongly discouraged within 24 hours prior 
to vaccination (see section 5.4 ). 
9. P rior to study vaccinations, draw blood from the subject for serology testing.  Details 
regarding the volume of blood and testing to be performed are in section 3.6.1 . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  
Vaccination procedures 
Vaccinations will be performed on Day [ADDRESS_366060] does not meet any criteria for delaying or 
c
ancelling additional study vaccinations, as described in section 4.3 and section 4.4  of the 
pr
otocol before performing the vaccination according to the procedures described in 
section 5.3  and 3.3..  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Post-
vaccination procedures 
The following post-vaccination procedures will be performed on Day 1 and Day 22: 
1. C areful training of the subject on how to measure solicited local AEs, body 
temperature and how/how often to complete the diary card is crucial. Training should 
be
 directed at the individual who will perform the measurements of the local AEs and 
those who will enter the information into the diary card. This individual may not be 
the subject, but if a person other than the subject enters information into the diary 
card, this person’s identity must be documented in the diary card and this person must 
receive training on its completion. Training of the subject on how to measure an 
injection site AEs should be performed while the subject is under observation after 
vaccination. Diary card instruction must include the following: 
a. The subject must understand that timely completion of the diary card on a daily 
basis is a critical component to study participation. The subject should also be 
instructed to write clearly and to complete the diary card in pen.  Any corrections 
to the diary card that are performed by [CONTACT_299905] a single strikethrough line with a brief explanation for any change. 
No changes can be made to the diary card when it is returned to the clinic.

spec
ific types of reactions at the injection site (solicited local AEs), any specific 
generalized symptoms (solicited systemic AEs), body temperature (taken 
preferably orally), any other symptoms or change in the subject’s health status, 
a
nd any medications/vaccinations received (excluding vitamins, minerals and 
homeopa
thic treatments).  These solicited AEs, unsolicited AEs and body 
tempe
rature will be recorded in the “six hour” location on the diary card. 
c. Body temperature measurement is to be performed using the thermometer 
provided by [CONTACT_779].  If the subject feels unusually hot or cold during the day, the 
subj
ect should check body temperature. If the subject has fever, the highest body 
tempe
rature observed that day should be recorded on the diary card. If the 
temperature is  35.5°C ( 95.9 °F), the subject should be instructed to repeat the 
mea
surement to ensure it is correct. The measurement of solicited local AEs is to 
be performed using the ruler provided by [CONTACT_779]. The collection of body 
temperature, solicited local AEs, solicited systemic AEs will continue for a total of 
[ADDRESS_366062]. If the temperature is ≥ 38.0°C (≥100.4 °F) on Day 7, the 
subj
ect should be instructed to continue to measure the temperature each day, as 
described above, until it returns to  38.0°C (100.4 °F) for the complete day.

subject’s healthcare provider, if the subject chooses to share this information. 
6. C omplete the termination electronic case report form (eCRF) page and this will mark 
the completion of the subject’s participation in the study. 
3.3  Blinding Procedures 
The trial is designed as an observer-blind study. During the Treatment Phase of the study 
(D
ay 1 through Day 43), designated unblinded nurse(s), physician(s), or other qualified 
pe
rsonnel will be responsible for administering the study vaccines to the subjects. They 
will
 be instructed not to reveal the identity of the study vaccines either to the subject or 
the inve
stigative site personnel (i.e., investigator and study nurse) involved in the 
monitoring of conduct of the trial, except in an emergency.  
The designated unblinded nurse(s) or physician(s) will not take part in evaluating the 
subject(s) for safety or collect study data after the vaccinations. Except in the case of 
medic
al necessity, a subject’s treatment should not be unblinded without the approval of 
the Sponsor. In such instance of medical emergency, every effort should be made to 
contact [CONTACT_27464]. If unblinding should occur (by [CONTACT_299911] a serious adverse event) prior to completion of 
the study, the investigator must promptly contact [CONTACT_299912]. Instructions regarding emergency unblinding will 
be provided to the investigator.  
Study vaccine allocations (first and second vaccinations at Day 1 and Day 22) will not be 
available to the investigator or personnel monitoring the trial until after the completion of 
the trial and final review of Day 387 data. 
A formal interim analysis of immunogenicity will be carried out by [CONTACT_299913] (to preserve the blind) after Day 43 immunogenicity data are 
available for all subjects (excluding those lost to follow-up or withdrawn for other 
re
asons).  The results of that interim analysis will have limited distribution to internal 
pe
rsonnel and appropriate external public health or regulatory agencies, who are not 
invol
ved in the ongoing conduct of the trial. Investigators, other site, CRO and Sponsor 
personnel, and the serology laboratory) will remain blinded to subjects’ individual study 
a
rm assignment until final data from all termination visits are locked.

Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, [ADDRESS_366069] be stripped 
of any identifiers that reveal the identity of that individual (beyond the use of subject ID, 
as described in section 3.2.3 ). 
The use of any written or verbal information identifying the subject such as name, initials, 
photos or testimonials, requires separate and appropriate documented consent from the 
subject. 
Dia
ry cards will be the only source document allowed for solicited systemic and local 
AEs (including body temperature measurements), starting after the initial 30-minute post-
vaccination period at the clinic.  The following additional rules apply to documentation of 
safety information collected in the diary cards: 
1. No c orrections or additions to the diary card will be allowed after it is delivered to the 
site. 
2. An y blank or illegible fields on the diary card must be described as missing in the 
eCRF. 
3. The  site must enter all readable entries in the diary card into the eCRF, including 
those values that may be biologically implausible (e.g. body temperature: 400°C). 
4. Any illegible or implausible data should be reviewed with the subject.  For example, 
if the subject with a body temperature of 400°C describes that the body temperature 
wa
s actually 40°C on the day in which body temperature: 400°C was written into the 
diary card, this fever of 40°C should be described in the source documents and 
reported as a verbally reported (unsolicited) AE in the AE eCRF.  
5. An y new safety information described at the visit (including a solicited AE not noted 
in the diary card) must NOT be written into the diary card and should be described in 
the source documents and reported as a verbally reported  (unsolicited) AE in the AE 
eCRF. 
3.4.2  Electronic and Paper Case report forms 
Paper (VSAE form, pregnancy follow-up CRF) and electronic CRFs will be used in this 
study. Data will be entered onto electronic and paper CRFs by [CONTACT_1755]/or the 
investigator’s dedicated site staff.   See section 9.1  for more details.

Laboratory Assessments 
3.6.1  Processing, Labeling and Storage of Serum Samples for Serology 
Approximately 10 – 12 mL sample of blood will be drawn from all subjects at Day 1 and 
Da
y 22 before vaccination, and at Day 43 and Day 183. The blood volume will not 
e
xceed 12 mL at each time point in order to provide the necessary serum volume 
(approximately half of the blood draw volume) for the serology assays. All samples will 
be
 tested blinded to subject ID, visit numbers and treatment assignment.

study  (see below for a description of withdrawal from study vaccine for subjects which 
re
fers to those subjects who do not receive additional vaccine doses but continue in the 
study for safety follow-up and/or other procedures). The reasons for premature 
withdrawal from the study include: 
 Adve rse event 
 De ath 
 W ithdrawal of consent  
 L ost to follow -up 
 Admini strative reason 
 P rotocol deviation 
 Other 
NOTE:  Before entering any alternate category as the reason for the subject’s 
disconti
nuation from the study, the investigator should make every effort to investigate 
whether or not safety concerns (AE or death) may have been related to the subject’s 
discontinuation from the study.  If a safety concern has been associated with the subject’s 
disconti
nuation, this must be described on the Termination eCRF page, even if it is not 
the primary reason for the subject’s discontinuation. 
For any subject withdrawing from study participation prior to the planned Termination 
visi
t, it is important to determine if an AE was associated with the reason for 
discontinuing the study.  This AE must be identified on the AE eCRF page by [CONTACT_124439] 
“Withdrawn from study due to AE”. 
For an y subject withdrawn from study participation due to death, this should be noted on 
the Termination eCRF page and the associated SAE that led to the death must be 
reported.

PRO-01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 
Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, [ADDRESS_366072] is otherwise entitled. Reason for early 
ter
mination should be deemed as “withdrawal of consent” if the subject withdraws from 
pa
rticipation due to a non-medical reason (i.e., reason other than AE). Subjects should be 
encouraged to be followed for safety for the duration of the study. When a subject 
withdraws, or is withdrawn, from the study, the procedures described in section 3.9, Early 
Termination Visit , should be completed if possible.  
The date of termination is the date of the last contact (clinic visit or telephone) in which 
the subject’s health status was assessed or, in cases where the subject does not agree to 
a
ny further safety follow-up, it is the date consent is withdrawn. 
I
n sites in the [LOCATION_002], if a subject withdraws consent but does not revoke the Health 
I
nsurance Portability and Accountability Act authorization (HIPAA), the Sponsor will 
ha
ve full access to the subject’s medical records, including termination visit information.  
If a subject revokes only the HIPAA authorization, the Sponsor will have full access to all 
of
 the subject’s medical records prior to the date and time of written revocation. 
For subjects who fail to show up for scheduled visits (clinic or telephone contacts),  study 
staff are encouraged to make at least three documented attempts to contact [CONTACT_299914] 
e
ncourage the completion of study termination procedures. These efforts to contact [CONTACT_299915].  The termination date for the subject 
to be c
aptured on the Termination eCRF page is the date of the last successful visit (clinic 
or telephone) with the subject.  
For subjects who are withdrawn from the study due to Sponsor decision (e.g. meeting pre-
specified withdrawal criteria or termination of study by [CONTACT_1034]), this reason should 
be noted in the Termination eCRF page and any ongoing AEs at the time of study 
withdrawal must be followed until resolution/stabilization. 
In general, subjects associated with protocol deviations may remain in the study unless 
continuation in the study jeopardizes the subject’s health, safety, or rights. For subject s 
who are withdrawn from the study due to receipt of an excluded medication/vaccination 
or due to significant protocol non-compliance, this reason should be noted in the 
Termination eCRF page. Any ongoing AEs at the time of study withdrawal must be 
followed until resolution/stabilization. This would not include any subject who became 
pregnant during study conduct despi[INVESTIGATOR_299875].  See below for greater detail. 
If a subject is withdrawn prematurely from the study for a reason other than those 
ou
tlined above, this reason must be documented in the Termination eCRF page.

reasons including but not limited to: failure to meet criteria for revaccination (see se ction 
4.4), or pregnancy (see section 6.6.4 ). Subjects who are withdrawn from study 
vac
cination should be encouraged to continue in the study for safety follow-up and 
other procedures as appropriate until the scheduled termination visit.   If the subject 
is wi
thdrawn from study vaccination(s) due to AE, this event must be linked to the 
withdrawal from vaccination on the AE eCRF page.  
The Sponsor or the investigator (following consultation with the Sponsor) has the right to 
discontinue
 this study at any time. If the clinical study is prematurely terminated, the 
investigator is to promptly inform the study subjects and local EC/IRB and should assure 
appropriate therapy and follow up for the subjects. All procedures and requirements 
pertaining to the archiving of study documents should be followed. All other study 
materials (study medication/vaccines, etc.) must be returned to the Sponsor. 
Any subject who, despi[INVESTIGATOR_177851], becomes pregnant 
during
 the trial will not receive further vaccination but should be encouraged to continue 
participation in the study. The site should complete a Pregnancy Report CRF (initial 
report) as soon as possible (see section 6.6.4 ).  If the subject withdraws from the study for 
a
ny of the above categories except death, the site will obtain permission from the subject 
to continue to remain in contact [CONTACT_299916], 
even if the outcome is not known until after the subject reaches the end of the routine 
stud
y period.  
Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. 
When a subject is withdrawn or withdraws from the study, the procedures described in

P
RECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN ADMINISTERING STUDY VACCINE: 
Prior to vaccination, subjects must be determined to be eligible for study vaccination and 
it must be clinically appropriate in the judgment of the investigator to vaccinate. 
Eligibility for vaccination prior to first study vaccine administration is determined by 
[CONTACT_299919] 4.[ADDRESS_366088] immunization practices are to be observed and care should be taken to 
administer the injection intramuscularly. Before administering vaccine, the vaccination 
site is to be disinfected with a skin disinfectant (e.g., 70% alcohol). Allow the skin to dry. 
DO NOT inject intravascularly  or intragluteally.  
As with all injectable vaccines, trained medical personnel and appropriate medical 
treatment should be readily available in case of anaphylactic reactions following vaccine 
administration. For example, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1:1000, diphenhydramine, and/or other 
medications for treating anaphylaxis should be available. 
5.4  Prior and Concomitant Medications and Vaccines 
Data on 
all medications  (except vitamins, minerals and homeopathic treatments) that 
we
re taken by [CONTACT_198506] 2 months prior to enrollment (including birth control) will 
be collected in the relevant Prior and Concomitant Medications eCRF. 
All vaccinations received up to [ADDRESS_366089] should be questioned regarding plans to receive an influenza vaccine over the next

illnesses or injuries. Relevant medical history can also include any medical history that 
c
ontributes to the understanding of an AE that occurs during study participation, if it 
represents an exacerbation of an underlying disease/preexisting problem. 
A review of systems  is a structured interview that queries the subject as to any 
complaints the subject has experienced across each organ system. This will be performed 
before enrolment and used to guide physical examination. 
A general physical examination is to be performed by a qualified health care 
pr
ofessional and will include, at a minimum, a check of general appearance, auscultation 
of heart and lungs, palpation of the abdominal, assessment of extremities, and review of 
the subjec

HI
 antibody titers measured at Day 22 ([ADDRESS_366094] study vaccination), and at Day 
43 (2
1 days after second study vaccination) are the adequate timings to measure the 
antibody response o f subjects. These titers will be compared against baseline antibody 
titers (Day 1, prior to vaccination) and will be used to evaluate immunogenicity. 
Additionally, measurement of HI antibody titers at Day [ADDRESS_366095]-

Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 Solicited local adverse events: 
Injection site induration, erythema, ecchymosis and pain. 
Solicited systemic adverse events: 
Nausea, generalized myalgia, generalized arthralgia, headache, fatigue, chills, loss of 
appetite, malaise and fever (derived from measured body temperatures (defined as body 
temperature ≥38.0 °C [≥100.4 °F] ). 
Other
 solicited adverse events: 
Body temperature (summarized by [CONTACT_299928] 0.5 oC increments from 
36.0 oC) and the use of analgesics/ antipyretic medication for prophylaxis or treatment. 
The study staff must review the diary card with the subject at the following visit (see 
se
ction 3.2.5 ) and must directly record the solicited local and systemic AEs, and other 
solicited AEs on the appropriate Local and Systemic AEs eCRF. As described in s ection 
3.4.1, all solicited AEs that are legible must be recorded verbatim in the eCRFs, even if 
the values do not appear to be plausible.   
If a solicited local or systemic AE continues beyond day [ADDRESS_366098] a causal relationship with this treatment. Therefore, an AE can 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for 
example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational 
product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.  This definition 
includes intercurrent illnesses or injuries and exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. 
NOTE:  Every effort should be made by [CONTACT_299929] a subject (solicited and unsolicited AEs) for an underlying 
diag
nosis and to capture this diagnosis as the event in the AE page.  In other words, the 
practice of reporting only symptoms (e.g., “cough” or “ear pain”) are better reported 
according to the underlying cause (e.g., “asthma exacerbation” or “otitis media”).

ate: some limitation in normal daily activity. 
Severe: unable to perform normal daily activity. 
The relationship of the study treatment to an AE will be determined by [CONTACT_299931] s:  
1. Not Related 
The AE is not related to an investigational vaccine if there is evidence that clearly 
indicates an alternative explanation.  If the subject has not received the vaccine, the 
ti
ming of the exposure to the vaccine and the onset of the AE are not reasonably related in 
time, or other facts, evidence or arguments exist that reasonably suggest an alternative 
explanation, then the AE is not related. 
2. Possibly Related 
The administration of the investigational vaccine and AE are considered reasonably 
related in time and the AE could be explained by [CONTACT_299932]. 
3. Probably Related

I
t should be noted that a severe AE need not be serious in nature and that a SAE need not, 
b
y definition, be severe. 
SAEs will be captured both on the VSAE form as well as on the AE eCRF. All SAEs will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_299934]. SAEs that 
are judged to be possibly or probably related to the study vaccine should be reported to 
the 
Sponsor as related (i.e., suspected) events. 
The relationship of the study treatment to an SAE will be determined by [CONTACT_98286]:   
1.  Related/suspected 
The SAE is judged by [CONTACT_299935] (see section 6.6.1 ).  
2.  Not Related 
The SAE is not related if exposure to the study vaccine has not occurred, or the 
occurrence of the SAE is not reasonably related in time, or the SAE is considered 
unli
kely to be related to use of the study vaccine, i.e., there are no facts (evidence) or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship. 
In addition, SAEs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_299936] “expectedness.”  An 
unexpected AE is one that is not listed in the current Summary of Product Characteristics 
or the Investigator’s Brochure or an event that is by [CONTACT_299937] a listed event. 
In 
addition, a pre-existing event or condition that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_299880].  If the onset of an event occurred before the 
subject entered the study (e.g., any pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_299881]

Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 7.2  Success Criteria 
7.2.1  Success Criteria for Co-Primary Objectives  
Lot-to-lot consistency, derived from Day 43 HI titers for each aH5N1c lot, will be 
c
laimed if, for subjects ≥ 18  years of age in the Per Protocol Set, the two-sided 95% 
c
onfidence intervals (CIs) of all the three pairwise comparisons (GMT(Group A)/ 
GMT(Group B), GMT(Group A)/ GMT(Group C),  GMT(Group C)/ GMT(Group B)) fall 
within 0.667 and 1.5. Significance level to all these tests is α = 5%, which needs no 
a
djustment for multiplicity as all hypotheses have to be rejected (intersection-union test 
problem).  
Furthermore after lot- to- lot consistency is achieved,  CBER criteria for the percentage of 
subjects with HI titer ≥ 1:40 on Day 43 will be assessed as below, for subjects from both 
age cohorts (18 to 65 years of age and ≥ 65 years of age) on pooled lots. The overall 
power to fulfill those CBER criteria is 98%.  
Immunogenicity according to CBER in subjects 18 - < 65 years of age 
The aH5N1c vaccines immunogenicity will be evaluated in subjects 18 to < 65 years of 
age, using the following measurements according to the current CBER criteria for the 
adult population (CBER 2007):  
 The  lower bound of the adjusted two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects 
achieving an HI antibody titer ≥ 1:40 should meet or exceed 70%.  
Immunogenicity according to CBER in subjects ≥ 65 years of age 
The aH5N1c vaccine immunogenicity will be evaluated in subjects ≥ 65 years of age, 
using the following measurements according to the current CBER criteria for the ≥ 65  
years of age population (CBER 2007):  
 The  lower bound of the adjusted two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects 
achieving an HI antibody titer ≥ 1:40 should meet or exceed 60%.  
The study will be considered a success if both lot- to-lot consistency for subjects aged ≥ 
18 years, and CBER criteria (titer above 1:40) for both age cohorts (18-65 years and ≥ 65 
years) are met.

The aH5N1c vaccines immunogenicity will be evaluated in subjects 18 to < 65 years of 
age, using the following measurements according to the current CBER criteria for the 
adult population (CBER 2007):  
 The  lower bound of the adjusted two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects 
achieving an HI antibody titer ≥ 1:40 should meet or exceed 70%.  
 The lower bound of the adjusted two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects 
achieving seroconversion for HI antibody should meet or exceed 40%. 
Immunogenicity according to CBER in subjects ≥ 65 years of age 
The aH5N1c vaccine immunogenicity will be evaluated in subjects ≥ 65 years of age, 
using the following measurements according to the current CBER criteria for the ≥ 65  
years of age population (CBER 2007):  
▫ The lower bound of the adjusted two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects 
achieving an HI antibody titer ≥ 1:40 should meet or exceed 60%. 
▫ The  lower bound of the adjusted two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects 
achieving seroconversion for HI antibody should meet or exceed 30%.

with H
I titer ≥ 1:[ADDRESS_366106] threshold as follows:  
Criteria for subjects 18 to 60 years of age:  
- The percentage of subjects with seroconversion in HI antibody is >40%; 
- The GMR is >2.5; 
- The percentage of subjects achieving an HI titer ≥ 1:40 is >70%. 
For subjects > 60 years of age: 
- The percentage of subjects with seroconversion in HI antibody is >30%;

- FAS2 (applicable to CBER criterion on seroconversion or significant increase) 
will include all subjects who received at least one dose of study vaccine and 
provide at least one evaluable serum sample at Day 1 AND Day 43.  
More details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.  
FAS will be analyzed “as randomized” (i.e., according to the vaccine a subject was 
de
signated to receive, which may be different from the vaccine the subject actually 
received).

7.3.8  Protocol Deviations 
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or 
procedures of a study protocol. A protocol deviation may be a reason to remove data from 
an analysis set at the time of analysis. Reportable (major) protocol deviations will be 
de
fined as exclusionary from the analysis according to protocol objectives and endpoints, 
which will be specified in the statistical analysis plan. In some cases exclusion of data 
may be due to a reason other than a protocol deviation, e.g. early termination.  
7.4  Analysis Plan 
7.4.1  Analysis of Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) for 
age, height and weight at enrollment will be calculated by [CONTACT_299948]. 
Distributi
ons of subjects by [CONTACT_4321], ethnicity, race and previous influenza vaccination (in the 
past 12 months) will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_43108]. 
7.4.2  Analysis of Co-Primary Objectives  
For lot- to-lot consistency, the following equivalence hypotheses will be tested 
simultaneously: 
H0:  (μlot A - μlot B) ≤ -0.176 or (μlot A - μlot B) ≥ 0.176 or 
(μlot
 A - μlot C) ≤ -0.176 or (μlot A - μlot C) ≥ 0.176 or 
(μlot
 B - μlot C) ≤ -0.176 or (μlot B - μlot C) ≥ 0.176 
vs.
 
H1:  (μlot A - μlot B) > -0.176 and (μlot A - μlot B) < 0.176 and 
(μlot
 A - μlot C) > -0.176 and (μlot A - μlot C) < 0.176 and 
(μlot B - μlot C) > -0.176 and (μlot B - μlot C) < 0.176 
Here, H 1 refers to the alternative hypothesis of pairwise equivalence (consistency) 
transformed to the log10 scale. Accordingly, μlot A , μlot B, and μlot C denote the means 
of log10-transformed Day 43 titers of the corresponding lot groups. The lot- to-lot 
consistency will be claimed if th e two-sided 95% CIs of all the three pairwise

PRO-01 TEMP 06 / Atlas No. 293620 
Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 comparisons are within the equivalence ranges. Significance level to all these tests is α = 
5%, which needs no adjustment for multiplicity as all hypotheses have to be rejected 
(intersection-union test problem).  
For CBER criteria HI antibody titer ≥1:40 should meet or exceed 70% and 60% 
respectively for the two different age cohorts (18- <65 years of age and ≥65 years of age) 
the following hypothesis will be tested: 
 H 0: (πi-π0) ≤ 0 vs. H 1: (πi-π0) > 0 
Here, H 1 refers to the alternative hypothesis. π 0 denotes the threshold for proportion of 
subjects with a HI titer ≥1:40 (π 0=0.7 for subjects 18 to <65 years of age and π 0=0.6 for 
subjects ≥65 years of age). Significance levels to these tests is α = 5% which needs no 
a
djustment for multiplicity as all hypothesis have to be rejected (intersection union 
problem). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis Populations for Co- Primary Objectives 
The primary analysis population for testing the null hypotheses above will be the Per 
Protocol Set (PPS).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  
Statistical Methods for Co-P rimary Objectives 
Log-normal distributed data 
All statistical analyses for HI will be performed on the logarithmically (base 10) 
transformed values.  Individual HI titers below detection limit will be set to half that limit. 
Geometric mean HI antibody titers (GMT) 
Adjusted estimates of geometric mean titers (GMTs), and their associated 95% CIs at Day 
43 will be determined using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with factors for lot, age 
groups (18-64, ≥ 65), center and a covariate for the effect defined by [CONTACT_63450]-transformed 
prevaccination antibody titer. Influenza-antibody GMTs (Day 43), associated two-sided 
95% CIs and median, minimal, and maximal area/titer values will be determined and 
presented together with N (number of subjects), by [INVESTIGATOR_2268] (for the first primary objective) . 
This model will include only immunogenic data from the 3 lots of aH5N1.  
Statistical analyses will be performed on the logarithmically (base 10) transformed titer

Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 To assess equivalence of lots, the limit of the 95% CI will be compared with the pre-
specified thresholds (see Section 7.2.1 ). 
Analysis of binary data 
Binary data (proportion of subjects with HI titer ≥ 1:40) will be analyzed using loglinear 
models wit
h a factor for dose group adjusted for center, at Day 43. Proportions and two-
sided 95%
 CIs will be calculated based on these models. Models might be simplified in 
case of convergence problems. 
Handling of missing values for Immunogenicity Data 
For immunogenicity data, it may be reasonable to consider missing immunogenicity 
values as missing completely at random (MCAR), i.e., not informative. Therefore, the 
primary analysis will comprise a complete case analysis only, without introducing any 
bias. Imputation methods will not be used. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sample Size and Power Considerations of Co- Primary Objectives 
Data observed in previous studies in similar sets (V89_04 in  subjects 18-64 years of age; 
V89_13 in subjects > 65 years of age) showed a variability of the post vaccination titers 
ra
nging from 0.75 to 0.88 (in the log scale). With the proposed sample size, assuming a 
standard deviation of 0. 85 for the log10 antibody titers (for each vaccine lot), approximate 
pa
irwise equivalence of factor [ADDRESS_366108] based on 718 
subj
ects per lot group has a power of 95%. The resulting overall power is approximately 
86%
, because the total number of comparisons is three. To account for dropouts 
(approximately 10%), a total of n=798 per lot should be recruited. 
Da
ta observed in previous studies in similar populations (V89_04 in subjects 18-<65 
y
ears of age; V89_13 in subjects > 65 years of age) showed a proportion of  86% of  
subjects aged 18 to <65 years and a proportion of 81% of subjects aged 65 years and 
older
 achieving an HI antibody titer of ≥1:40. With a sample size of 1077 evaluable 
subj
ects from the pooled lots there is an overall power of approximately 98% to achieve 
the CB
ER criteria (HI antibody titer ≥1:[ADDRESS_366109] 70% of the subjects aged 18 to <[ADDRESS_366110] 60% of the subjects aged 65 years and older). To account for

Version No. 1 / Version Date: August, 20 2012 7.4.3   Analysis of Safety Objectives 
Handling of missing values for Safety Data: 
Unsolicited AEs: The entire study period  will be divided into disjoint intervals based 
upon the time and event schedule in the protocol. Endpoints for the intervals will be 
specified in the AP. 
Solicited AEs: The solicited study period (30min- Day 7) will be divided into disjoint 
intervals: 30 min, 6h-Day 3, Day 4-Day 7, and one overall interval: 6h-Day 7. 
For each of the intervals the following algorithm will be applied: 
1. I f less than 20% of subjects are without any solicited AE data (i.e., none of the 
solicited AEs has been captured in the interval) for the respective time interval, then 
no further action is necessary and the Safety Set pertaining to the interval will be 
analyzed. 
2. I f 20% or more of subjects are without any solicited AE data, the missing mechanism 
will be analyzed by [CONTACT_299949] a newly created variable indicating whether a 
subject is missing the respective AE-value or not (1=AE record present; 0=AE record 
not present). 
a. If the percentage of missing subjects does not vary significantly between vaccine 
groups (p>0.05) then ‘missing completely at random’ (MCAR) is assumed and no 
further action is required. Data will be analysed without the missing values. 
b. If the percentage of missing subjects vary significantly between vaccine groups 
(p≤0.05) then ‘missing at random’ (MAR) is assumed, i.e., the missing mechanism 
is conditional on the vaccine group. Multiple imputation methods will be applied 
to reduce potential bias arising from missing values (details will be given in 
Appendix 16.1.9 of the CSR, if applicable). 
For solicited events, multiple imputation will be confined to analyses of any (rather than 
specific) local AEs and of any (rather than specific) system reactions and for unsolicited 
events, to analyses of any AEs and SAEs. 
Further details of the statistical methods will be provided in the AP.

se Events 
There is no statistical null hypothesis associated with the safety objective, which will be 
analyzed descriptively. All safety analyses will be done by [CONTACT_29299]. Safety will also 
be
 analyzed by [CONTACT_654].  
All solicited AEs will be summarized according to defined severity grading scales 
(Appendices A  and B).  
Frequencies and percentages of subjects experiencing each AE will be presented for each 
symptom severity.  Summary tables showing the occurrence of any local or systemic AE 
overall and at each time point will also be presented. 
Post-vaccination solicited AEs reported from Day 1 to Day 7 will be summarized for the 
intervals Day 1-3 (with and without the 30-minute interval), Day 4-7, and Day 1-7 (with 
a
nd without the 30-minute interval), by [CONTACT_299950]. The 30-
mi
nute interval measurement will be summarized separately. The severity of solicited 
loca
l AEs, including injection-site erythema, ecchymosis and induration will be 
categorized by [CONTACT_299951].  Injection-site 
erythema, ecchymosis and induration will be summarized according to categories based 
on line
ar measurement: mild (grade I) : 2.5 cm to 5.0 cm; moderate (grade II) : 5.1c m to 10 
cm;severe (grade III) : 10 cm.  
Inje
ction site pain and systemic AEs (except fever) occurring for the 7 days including   
each vaccination will be summarized according to “mild”, “moderate” or “severe”.   
Each solicited local and systemic AE will also be further summarized as “none” versus 
“any”.   
Use of antipyretics and analgesics will be summarized by [CONTACT_299952]/or prophylaxis. The influence of antipyretics and analgesics use on the occurrence of 
specific AEs (e.g., fever) will be assessed. 
Body temperature will be summarized by 0.5 ° C increments from <36.0° C up to ≥40.0° 
C
 and will be broken down irrespective of route of measurement.  Body temperature will 
also be summarized as <38.0  °C or ≥38.0 °C.  
B

9.1  Data Entry and Management 
In this study, data will be entered onto eCRFs in a timely fashion by [CONTACT_40581]/or the investigator’s dedicated site staff.  Data entered onto eCRFs are stored on a 
secure website.  The data collected on this secure website are assimilated into an EDC 
system, which is compliant with 21 Part 11 policies of the Code of Federal Regulations.  
The EDC will be designed and validated by [CONTACT_13668](s) prior to 
a
ctivation for data entry by [CONTACT_21127]. The investigator must review data entered and 
electronically sign the eCRFs to verify their accuracy.  
Access to the EDC system for data entry or review will require training and distinct 
indi
vidual access code assignments to those site staff members who will be entering study 
data and those involved in study oversight who may review study data.  Data are collected 
within EDC, to which the Sponsor and site monitors have exclusively “read only” access.  
eCRF data will be reviewed routinely by [CONTACT_299964](s) and clinical monitors.  
Pregnancy CRFs that are three-part “no carbon required” (NCR) paper CRFs will be 
provided for each subject by [CONTACT_1034].  One copy must be retained by [CONTACT_093], 
a
nd all other copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including the original copy) will be returned as directed by [CONTACT_429].  Instructions on how to complete these forms will be provided to the 
investigator. 
All study data must be entered by [CONTACT_299965].  If the investigator delegates and authorizes other persons in his/her staff to make 
entries on the CRF, the names, positions, signatures and initials must be documented in 
writing (e.g., site delegation log). 
Arrangements will be made by [CONTACT_299966].  
No CRFs are to be mailed to the Sponsor without specific authorization. 
Data from paper CRFs are entered into the study database by [CONTACT_299967]. Verification is performed manually by a separate member of the 
staff by [CONTACT_299968]. 
Electronic Data Transfer (EDT) is one method used  for collecting laboratory data.  The 
full-service laboratory (i.e., central laboratory) will send data as electronic files by a 
secured method (e.g. via diskette, CD, as an encrypted file attachment on electronic mail, 
or as a direct transfer into a specified server directory) to the Sponsor’s CDMS 
de
partment.  The data file is pre-processed and loaded by a member of the CDMS team

I
RBs/ECs, and regulatory authorities as required. If an inspection of the clinical site is 
requested by a regulatory authority, the investigator must inform the Sponsor immediately 
that this request has been made. 
The
 investigator is also responsible for the following: 
 maintaining a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom the investigator has 
delegated significant trial-related duties 
 demonstrating the capability of recruiting the required number of suitable subjects 
within the recruitment period 
 demonstrating sufficient time and staffing to properly conduct and complete the study 
within the agreed trial period 
 e nsuring that all persons assisting with the study are adequately informed about the 
protocol, the investigational product(s), and their study-related duties and functions 
 ensuring that appropriately trained health care professionals are responsible for all 
study-related medical decisions and for ensuring appropriate medical care of subject s 
e
xperiencing any AE  related to the study 
 if permission to do so is given by [CONTACT_423], ensuring that the subject’s primary 
healthcare provider is informed of the subject’s participation in the study. 
The investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes of the protocol 
without agreement by [CONTACT_179664]/favourable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_5698]/IEC of an amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an

12.5  Protocol Amendments 
An amendment is a written description of change(s) to or formal clarification of a trial 
pr
otocol which may impact on the conduct of the clinical trial, potential benefit of the 
clinical trial, or may affect subject safety, including changes of trial objectives, trial 
de
sign, subject population, sample sizes, trial procedures, or significant administrative 
aspec
ts.  An administrative change of a trial protocol is a minor correction or clarification 
that has no significant impact on the way the clinical trial is to be conducted and no effect 
on subject safety (e.g., change of telephone number(s), logistical changes).  Protocol 
amendme
nts must be approved by [CONTACT_1034], Health Authorities where required, and 
the IRB/EC.  In cases when the amendment is required in order to protect the subject 
sa
fety, the amendment can be implemented prior to IRB/EC approval. Notwithstanding 
the need for formal approval of a protocol amendment, the investigator is expected to take 
any immediate action required for the safety of any subject included in this trial, even if 
thi
s action represents a deviation from the protocol. In such cases, the Sponsor should be 
notifie
d of this action, the IRB/EC at the trial site, and, if required by [CONTACT_427], 
the relevant health authority) should be informed within 10 working days.

Study Design  A prospective, single arm, open -label, multicenter trial that will be conducted in 
three phases:  
Phase I - Run-in:  
Eligible participants will be trained to use a smartphone migraine diary application. 
During the 4 weeks of this phase, participants will be instructed to report all their 
migraines and headaches at onset . For each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], participants will be 
instructed to report headache level, presence/absence of associated symptoms, 
and use of medications at baseline, at onset, [ADDRESS_674789] report . Participants who comply with the migraine diary reporting will continue 
to the treatment phase.  
Phase II – Treatment:  
A 4-week treatment phase in which participants will be asked to treat their migraine 
headaches with the Nerivio device and to avoid taking medications within [ADDRESS_674790]-treatment. The treatments with the device should be performed within 60 
minutes of the onset of migraine or headache. Participants will be asked to report 
their headache level, presence/absence of associated symptoms, and use of 
medication using the smartphone application at baseline, [ADDRESS_674791] treatment of a qualifying migraine headache (see below) after the training treatment is considered the test treatment and will be used 
for al l efficacy assessments. 
Phase III - Follow -up: 
Participants who complete the treatment phase will be offered to participate in an 
8-week follow -up phase in which they will incorporate the Nerivio device into their 
usual care according to their preference (Nerivio only, medication only, both or none). Participants will be asked to report all their migraine s or headaches at 
onset , regardless if they are using the device or not. For each migraine or 
headache, participants will be instructed to report headache level, 
presence/absence of associated symptoms, and use of medications at baseline, [ADDRESS_674792] report.  
Qualifying 
migraine headache A qualifying migraine headache is defined as a migraine headache that:  
1. Is of moderate or severe intensity and preceded by 24 hours of no pain or mild 
intensity pain; or is of mild intensity and preceded by 24 hours of no pain;  
2. Occurred in a setting in which the patient could properly administer the 
treatment (that is, it is possible to initiate a complete treatment within 60 
minutes of onset and the participant will be able to complete the migraine diary 
at 2 hours after treatment)  
Primary efficacy 
endpoint 1. Pain relief at [ADDRESS_674793] -treatment without the use of rescue medication. Pain relief is 
defined as an improvement from severe or moderate pain to mild or no pain, 
or from mild pain to no pain.

 Template ID: CLI-I00101 Rev: 1.[ADDRESS_674798] prevalent and disabling neurologic disorders  [1]. The 
International Headache Society defines chronic migraine as Headache occurring on 15 or 
more days/ month for more than three months, which, on at least eight days/month, has 
the features of migraine headache  [2].  
 
Chronic migraine affects approximately 1.4– 2.2% of adults worldwide [3] and about 10% 
of the migraine population [4], however quality of life is more greatly affected in chronic 
migraine patients, than in epi[INVESTIGATOR_336712]  [5].  
Treatment plan for chronic migraine consists of both prophylactic treatment and acute 
treatment. Although prophylactic medication have been shown to be efficacious for some 
patients  [6], studies show very low adherence to preventive treatments [7] and high 
discontinuation rates mostly due to lack of efficacy and existence of side effects  [8]. Yet , 
acute treatment, if used excessively, can often lead to medication overuse headache 
(MOH)  [9]. Thus, there is a great unmet need for alternative non-pharmacological acute 
migraine treatments that are both effective and well tolerated. Such developments hold 
the potential to improve the health and quality of life of patients with chronic  migraines.  
 
Non-invasive neuromodulation is safe, well -tolerated, and may have fewer adverse effects 
than drugs  [10,11]. Remote electrical neuromodulation (REN)  [12] is a novel acute 
migraine treatment which stimulates upper arm peripheral nerves to induce conditioned 
pain modulation (CPM)  - an endogenous analgesia mechanism in which conditioning 
stimulation inhibits pain in remote body regions  [13].  
 
The safety and efficacy of REN ( Nerivio™, Theranica Bio- Electronics LTD., Israel) has 
been recently assessed for migraine in a randomized, double- blind, sham -controlled multi -
center study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . This study  demonstrated that REN provides superior 
clinically meaningful relief of migraine pain and MBS compared to placebo, offering a  safe 
and effective non-pharmacological alternative for acute migraine treatment. Specifically, 
the active stimulation was more effective than sham stimulation in achieving pain relief 
(66∙7% [66/99; CI95% 56∙48-75∙82] vs. 38∙8%, p<0∙001), pain-free (37∙4% vs. 18∙4%, 
p<0∙005) and MBS relief (46∙3% vs. 22∙2%, p<0∙001) at [ADDRESS_674799]-treatment. In addition, t he incidence of device-related adverse events was low and 
similar between treatment groups (4∙ 8% vs. 2 ∙4%, p=0∙49). All device -related adverse 
events  were mild, did not required medical intervention and resolved within 24 h ours. The 
device was granted a 510k De novo approval (DEN180059)  for the acute treatment of 
migraine in people who do not have chronic migraine. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of REN for the treatment 
of chronic migraine.

3. Identification and description of the device information 
3.1. Intended use 
Current indication for use of the device: 
The Nerivio ™ is indicated for acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in 
patients [ADDRESS_674800] chronic migraine. It is a prescription 
use, self-administered device for use in the home environment at the onset of migraine 
headache or aura.  
This study aims  to expand the current  indication to include acute treatment of migraine 
in people with chronic migraine.  
 
3.2. Device description 
The device is a wireless wearable battery -operated stimulation unit controlled by a 
smartphone software application. Treatments with Nerivio™  are self-administered by 
[CONTACT_336734] a migraine attack.  
 
The Nerivio™  is a fully integrated unit similar in appearance to an adhesive armband 
made of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). The device includes several main 
components:  
• A pair of electrodes covered with hydrogel and a removeable protective film  
• An electronic circuitry and a battery contained in a plastic case 
• A software that includes firmware and a software application for mobile platforms  
•  An armband to improve the adhesiveness  and enable a discreet treatment 
 The external side of the Nerivio™  (Figure 1) includes an  "ON " switch and a LED 
indicator that signals various modes of operation, located on the enclosure. The internal 
side includes the electrodes and a biocompatible adhesive material that holds the 
device in its location . The armband is applied over the device to further secure its 
location on the arm  and conceal  the device to enable a discre et treatment. 
 The device produces a proprietary electrical signal comprising a modulated symmetrical quad-phasic square pulse with a modulated frequency of 100-120-Hz, 
pulse width of 400 μs, and up to 40 mA output current (adjusted by [CONTACT_2299]).

3.3. The application 
Activation, control over stimulation intensity and termination of stimulation are 
performed via a dedicated smartphone application and installed on the user’s 
smart phone (Figure 2). The application has a graphical user interface (GUI) which 
includes graphical controls that the user can select using a touch screen. The app 
enables the user to start treatments  and control them as well as  review the history of 
migraine headaches.  
 
  
 
Figure 2: The app screens  
 
The Nerivio  application also includes a ‘migraine diary’ which collects information on 
the migraine epi[INVESTIGATOR_336713] (e.g. date & time, location, headache pain intensity,

etc.). The application also provides notifications and indications on connection state 
and remaining number of treatments.    
The device communicates with the mobile application software through a Bluetooth® 
radio protocol (BTLE) which uses 2.4GHz carrier.  
 
The application can be installed from Google Play or the App store and supports 
Hebrew and English menu displays.  
  
3.4. Operational context  
Nerivio™  is a wearable, battery -powered medical device for the acute treatment of 
migraines with or without aura. Nerivio™  delivers transcutaneous electrical nerve 
stimulation (TENS) through the control of the Nerivio™  iOS or Android app. Nerivio™  
is a home-use device that requires prescription but does not require training. The device 
is provided with a printed QuickStart guide and a user manual in the app. The first use 
of the device requires the user to install the app and pair the smartphone to the device. 
In each treatment, the intensity level should be individually set so it feels strong yet 
comfortable and painless. The battery of the device is non-rechargeable, the electrodes 
should be covered with protective liners and the device should be stored in its original 
package.  
Nerivio™   should be placed on the user’s arm ( Figure 3) at the onset of a migraine 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the device should then be turned on and a treatment can be activated via the mobile application. The treatment includes a weak electrical current delivered to the 
skin via the electrodes. The arm was chosen for several reasons. First, it is distal from 
the head, enabling to produce CPM  response. Second, it may be easily accessed 
independently by [CONTACT_336735]. Finally, it provides a di screet 
location that maintains the privacy of the user and enables to continue with ongoing 
activities during treatment.

3.5. Principle of operation 
Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) is a descending endogenous analgesic 
mechanism that originates in the brainstem  (rostral ventromedial medulla), in which 
pain in one part of the body inhibits pain in multiple remote body regions [13]. According 
to this well -established mechanism, also known as “pain inhibits pain”, the intensi ty of 
a painful stimulus can be reduced by a second painful stimulus at a different location 
[14,15]. Notably, it has been shown that very strong but subjectively non‐ painful 
stimulus is sufficient to trigger pain inhibitory effects [16].    
From a neuronal level, noxious sensory information is carried by [CONTACT_336736] – the Aδ and C fibers ( Table 1). Aδ fibers are small myeli nated afferents that 
respond to mechanical and thermal stimuli, and carry rapid, sharp pain. These fibers 
are responsible for the initial withdrawal reflex responses. C fibers are unmyelinated 
and have a small diameter and low conduction velocity. These fibers respond to 
chemical, mechanical and thermal stimuli and produce slow, burning pain. The 
headache of migraine is believed to be mediated by [CONTACT_336737] [17]. CPM inhibits the responses of these fibers, 
with an inhibitory preference towards the C fiber mediated responses [18]. Another type 
of primary sensory afferent fibers is the Aβ fibers which are large and thickly myelinated, 
enabling rapid signal conduction ( Table 1). These fibers have a low activation threshold 
and transmit tactile information.

In Nerivio™ , the stimulation (secondary stimulus) is engineered to produce a strong but 
non-painful stimulus that invokes the CPM as a pain relief mechanism for the migraine 
headache (initial stimulus). The patient is instructed to adjust the intensity to the 
strongest stimulation which is  still below the perceived pain level. The area of the 
electrodes of Nerivio™  is relatively large, enabling to recruit a large number of fibers 
during treatment. The pulse frequency and duration are designed so that C fibers  and

Aδ fibers are stimulated below their thresholds, aiming to produce a local sensation 
below the pain threshold, as well as to avoid excitation of motor nerves. Furthermore, 
the local pain sensation in the arm may be inhibited by  Aβ fibers through the “gate 
control” theory of pain [19], further preventing the perception of pain. In addition, the 
pulses frequency gradually changes during the stimulation to avoid pain habituation, 
and a low frequency modulating waveform is added to invoke the release of 
neurotransmitters to further enhance the analgesic impact.  
 
3.6. Output parameters 
Output parameters of the Nerivio™  are similar to those of other  transcutaneous electrical 
nerve stimulation (TENS ) devices previously approved by [CONTACT_336738].  
The Nerivio™  output parameters and its comparison to other approved devices are 
described in  Table 2.

4. Preliminary investigations and justification for the study design 
4.1. Previous pre-clinical experience 
No animal studies were conducted with the Nerivio™  device. The necessity for an animal 
study has been deemed unnecessary since the device utilizes similar output parameters 
to those of FDA approved TENS devices, and in accordance with the application of risk

4.2. Previous clinical experience 
The clinical data was obtained in one prospective, double-blind, randomized, crossover, 
sham -controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_336714], randomized, double -blind, sham -
controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491] (TCH-003). Both studies were conducted on adults (ages 18 
years or above). Each of these studies is briefly summarized below. 
   
4.2.1 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_23366] a single-center , prospective, double-blind, randomized, crossover, 
sham controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_520235]-invasive remote electrical neuromodulation with Nerivio™ for the acute treatment 
of migraine. The results of this study have been published in Neurology [12]. Briefly, 86 
people with migraine with or without aura (in accordance with ICHD classification criteria) 
who had 2– [ADDRESS_674803] 2 months 
were recruited. The participants were requested to treat migraine epi[INVESTIGATOR_520236], which randomly provided five 20-minute-long stimuli programs 
differentiating in pulse width; 4 active programs at 80– 120 Hz, with pulse widths of 200 
(P200), 150 (P150), 100 (P100), and 50 (P50) ms, and 1 placebo stimulation protocol 
(P0) at 0.1 Hz frequency with 45-ms -long pulses.
 
 
Pain levels were self-reported using a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS) [20] via a 
smartphone application at onset and 10, 20, and [ADDRESS_674804] 50% at [ADDRESS_674805] 50% of completed treatments.

Efficacy  
The analysis of the primary endpoint revealed a 64% rate of at least 50% pain reduction 
(defined as a reduction from sever to moderate pain to mild or no pain) at [ADDRESS_674807] 50% of completed active treatments. This rate was signifi cantly 
higher than the 26% rate found for the sham treatment (p=0.005). The data 
demonstrated that the P200 program was most effective for headache relief. Thus, the 
following pi[INVESTIGATOR_520237] P200 program.  
 
Safety  
In this study no devi ce-related adverse events and no side effects were reported.  
 
4.2.2 TCH-003 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] s tudy ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  
This was a randomized, double-blind, sham -controlled study conducted at 7 [LOCATION_003] and 5 
Israeli sites  from December 2017 to October 2018. This study  aimed to assess  the 
efficacy  and safety of Nerivio™ . 
 
Participants  
Eligible patients were 18– 75 years old females and males who met the International 
Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) third edition criteria for migraine with or without aura, with at least two and no more than eight migraine headaches per month, 
with no more than 12 headache days per month, and with stable (or no) migraine preventive medications in the last two months prior to recruitment.  Exclusion criteria 
were: 1) pregnancy, nursing, trying to conceive; 2) pure menstrual migraine (excluded because these attacks are often longer) ; 3) implanted electrical device(s); 4) treatment 
with OnabotulinumtoxinA  in the prior month; 5) nerve blocks in the preceding two weeks; 6) current use of cannabis; 7) uncontrolled epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]; 8) receiving parenteral infusions for 
migraine in the preceding two weeks; 9) other significant pain, medical or psychiatric 
illness that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_336718]; 10) 
unable to use a smartphone; 11) previous experience with REN in clinic al trials for 
migraine.  
 
Randomization and masking 
Before each site initiation, randomization schemes of blocks of eight participants per site 
(four active and four sham) were developed. Group allocation was concealed by 
[CONTACT_336740] (Android or iOS) prepared by 
[CONTACT_336741] (DMC), which included the device media 
access control  (MAC ) address (the unique device identification number) and an assigned 
randomization number identifier. Participants were randomized based on the type of 
operating system of their phones (Android or iOS) and their order of arrival to the 
randomization visit.  To assess blinding, participants were asked at the end of study 
which group they thought they had been assigned to (active, sham, do not know). The 
participants, investigators and clinic personnel were unaware of group assignment until

the completion of the double-blind treatment phase. Each device was programmed with 
one of two versions of firmware that deliver ed either active or sham electrical sti mulation 
(see above for detailed electrical properties). In all other aspects, the active and the sham 
conditions were kept similar.  
 
Procedures  
After enrollment, participants were trained to use the electronic diary application, 
installed on their own smartphones, and then completed a one-month migraine diary 
(“roll-in” phase). Eligible participants were then randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either active 
(active group) or sham stimulation (sham group), in a double-blind manner. During the 
randomization visit, participants were trained to use the device assigned to them, 
including finding the optimal individual stimulation intensity level (perceptible but not 
painful). Participants treated their migraine attacks for 4-6 weeks (“double- blind 
treatment” phase), starting at their optimal stimulation intensity, as soon as possible after 
migraine headache began and always within one hour of symptom onset. Participants 
were instructed to avoid taking rescue medications within two hours post-treatment, if possible. Pain scores (none, mild, moderate, or severe) were recorded at baseline, 2- 
and 48-hours post-treatment. Migraine associated symptoms including nausea, 
photophobia and phonophobia were recorded at the time of treatment. Participants 
declared their most
  bothersome migraine symptom (MBS) for each treated attack and 
reported absence and presence of all associated symptoms (including their MBS) at baseline and [ADDRESS_674808]-treatment in the "test treatment", defined as improvement from severe or 
moderate pain to mild or none, or, improvement from mild pain to none. The secondary 
efficacy endpoints pain-free (improvement from mild, moderate, or severe pain to none), MBS relief, pain relief & MBS relief, and MBS freedom at [ADDRESS_674809] 50% of their treated attacks. Pain relief at [ADDRESS_674810]-treatment as function of baseline pain 
level was also explored.      
 
 Results 
296 participants were enrolled; 252 were randomized after the " run-in" phase, 126 were 
assigned to the active group and 126 to the sham group. Of the 44 who were not 
randomized, 33 failed to meet the “roll -in” criteria, 9 withdrew from the study and 2 were 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_336742]. Among the 252 randomized 
participants  (intent-to-treat population), 7 withdrew from the study, 3 (1 sham, 2 active)

due to intolerance to the stimulation and 4 (2 sham, 2 active) were lost to follow up. [ADDRESS_674811] one treatment (the "run-in" treatment) and 203 
participants completed the “test treatment”. 202 participants (99 in the active group and 
103 in the sham group) started the “test treatment” within one hour from symptom onset 
and reported pain level at 2 hours, forming the mITT population with evaluable data. 37 
participants who did not complete the “test treatment”, due to insufficient migraine 
attacks (n=18), participant’s decision not to use the device (n=4), other (n=6) or unknown (n=9), were excluded from the efficacy analyses.  
The demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between treatment groups (Table 4). The characteristics of treated migraine headaches were comparable to those 
reported in previous migraine studies  [21–23].

group, a therapeutic gain of 27. 9% (p<0. 001;Figure 4A).  Similar results were found when 
missing data was imputed using a worst-case scenario (66/103=64. 1% for active versus 
41/104=39. 4% for sham, p<0. 001). Furthermore, more participants in the active group 
were pain-free at [ADDRESS_674813]-treatment (37. 4% [37/99; CI 95% 27.85-47 .67]) compared 
with the sham group (18. 4% [19/103; CI 95% 11.49-27.30]; a therapeutic gain of 19.0%; 
P=0. 003, adjusted; Figure 4A). Rescue medication within [ADDRESS_674814]- treatment was 
used by 1% of the participants in the active group and 3. 8% in the sham group (p=0. 19). 
The active treatment was also significantly more effective than sham for MBS relief 
(46.3% [44/95] vs. 22. 2% [22/99]; CI 95% 36.02-56. 85 and 14. 48-31. 69 respectively; 
p<0.001, adjusted) and for combined pain relief & MBS relief (40. 0% vs. 15. 2%; CI 95% 
30.08-50. 56 active and 8. 74-23. 76 sham; p< 0.001, adjusted) at [ADDRESS_674815]-treatment 
(Figure 4B and Table 4). There was no statistically -significant difference between 
treatment groups in the [ADDRESS_674816]-treatment MBS free response (40. 7% [33/81] vs. 
36.4% [32/88]; CI 29. 95-52.23 active and 26. 37-47.31 sham; p=0. 55, adjusted; Figure 
4B).  
The 2-hours pain relief and pain-free superiority of the active treatment were sustained 
[ADDRESS_674817]-treatment was achieved 
in 34 of 87 (39∙1%) participants in the active group, and in 15 of 89 (16.9%) participants 
in the sham group (P<0. 005; Figure 4A). Sustained pain-free at 48 hours was achieved 
in the active group by 18 of 87 (20. 7%) p articipants, and in the sham group by 7 of 89 
(7.9%) participants (P<0. 05; Figure 4A). 
During the 4-[ADDRESS_674818] 50% of treated attacks was higher in the active group compared to the sham group 
(62.6% [62/99] vs. 45.6% [47/103], p=0.015).

The primary endpoint was also evaluated as a function of baseline pain intensity. The interaction between baseline pain intensity and response rate was not found significant 
(p=0.84), indicating that the treatment effect was similar across baseline pain intensity 
levels.  
 
Safety analyses were performed on all 252 participants (ITT population). The percentage 
of participants experiencing at least one adverse event was 13.5% (34/252) and was 
comparable across treatment groups (15.1% [19/126] active and 11.9% [15/126] sham,  
p=0.58). 23 device-related adverse events were reported during 773 treatments (2.7%), 
14 in the active group and 9 in the sham group. The incidence of device-related adverse events was low (3.6%), and similar between treatment groups (6/126 [4.8%] vs. 3/126 
[2.4%]; p=0.49). Device-related adverse events included warmth sensation, temporary 
arm/hand numbness, redness, itching, tingling, muscle spasm and pain in the arm, 
shoulders or neck ( Table 5). All device-related adverse events were mild, resolved within 
24 hours and did not require medical treatment. There were no device -related serious

Table 5:  Incidence of adverse events and device-related adverse events in the ITT population  
 
The findings of this study  suggest that remote electrical neuromodulation with Nerivio™  
is an effective acute migraine treatment with a favorable safety and tolerability profiles . 
REN may be an alternative acute migraine treatment with comparable or superior 
efficacy to commercially available neuromodulation devices  [21,24] . REN has the 
potential to increase patient adherence, improve migraine management and improve the 
health and quality of life of people with migraines.   
 
4.3. Clinical investigation risks and benefits  
4.3.1. Anticipated benefits to participants  
The clinical studies conducted in adults demonstrated that REN provides superior 
clinically meaningful relief of migraine pain and MBS compared to sham -device with a 
favorable safety profile, offering a  safe and effective non-pharmacological alternative for 
acute migraine treatment. It is anticipated that the use for chronic  migraines will be 
experienced with  a similar clinically beneficial effect.

none of the participants withdrew from the study due to adverse events. The safety 
profile of the device is favorable compared to triptans [25] and to new pharmacological 
agents, such as centrally acting serotonin (5-HT1F) agonists that lack  cardiac  
vasoconstric tive activity [26]. Furthermore, the device has comparable or superior 
efficacy to commercially available neuromodulation devices  [21,24].  
   
4.3.3.  Risk-benefit balance 
The data collected in the randomized controlled clinical study  in adults  demonstrated 
that acute treatment of migraine with Nerivio™  results in most important clinical benefits 
with a very  low risk to  the patient. Invoking conditioned pain modulation using peripheral 
neurostimulation that induces a general analgesic effect resulted in favorable 2-hour 
pain relief and pain-free responses  which are comparable with pharmacological acute 
migraine treatments such as triptans with a more favorable safety profile. Overall, the 
benefit-risk balance of Nerivio™  is favorable. The overall risk posed by [CONTACT_520247]. The device offers a major benefit by [CONTACT_1541] a novel acute treatment of migraines which is highly effective and reduces the side effects of current pharmacological treatments. Therefore, the device may offer an alternative non -
pharmacological treatment approach to the limited effective treatment options for 
chronic migraines  and has the potential to decrease the reliance of patients  on 
pharmacological treatments, improve treatment adherence, reduce the risk of medication overuse and considerably improve the health and quality of life of patients 
suffering from  chronic  migraines. 
 
5. Objectives & hypotheses  
5.1. Study objectives 
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Nerivio™  for the acute 
treatment of migraine in people with chronic migraine. The goal of this study i s to 
demonstrate migraine headache relief without unexpected device-related adverse 
effects . 
 
5.2. Study hypothesis 
The hypothesis of this study is that in people with chronic migraine, REN with Nerivio™  
will provide clinically meaningful relief of migraine pain with a favorable safety profile.  
 
6. Study design  
6.1. Participants 
This study will be conducted on up to 150 eligible participants.

Enrollment:  The screening process will include an eligibility assessment and a urine 
pregnancy test. Following successful screening, the site staff will provide the participants  
with study related information, perform an enrollment interview and receive an informed 
consent from the participants. During this visit, participants will complete baseline 
questionnaires that included information on the frequency and severity  of their migraine 
attacks, typi[INVESTIGATOR_520239], us e of preventive and acute treatments, and the 
effect that their migraine attacks have on their daily routine and quality of life.  
 
Application training:  Eligible participants who enroll to the study will be trained to use 
the diary mode of the application that is installed on their own smartphones. The 
participants will be instructed to report the onset of all their migraines and headaches 
and  complete a migraine diary questions regarding their pain intensity levels , the 
presence/absence of aura and associated migraine symptoms  (nausea, photophobia, 
phonophobia, and allodynia) as well as rate their stress level and functional disability at 
baseline, [ADDRESS_674822]-treatment. At the beginning of each treatment, 
participants will also be asked to report the time elapsed from attack onset. The site 
personnel will be required to document the training session in the CRF.   
 Run-in phase: After the enrollment visit, participants will undergo a 4-week  migraine 
diary phase aimed to collect baseline migraine characteristics and further assess eligibility. The participants will use the app to record pain intensity levels , the 
presence/absence of aura and associated migraine symptoms  (nausea, photophobia, 
phonophobia, and allodynia) as well as the effect that their migraine attacks have on 
their daily routine and quality of life, at baseline, 2- and 24-hours post-treatment. These 
reports will be transferred by [CONTACT_520249] (EDC) system , 
where they will be collected and registered.  
Participants who report at least [ADDRESS_674823]-treatment will continue to the treatment phase.  
 
Second visit- 
Device training: Eligible participants  who successfully complete the run-in phase  will 
receive the Nerivio™  device. The device will be registered and connected by [CONTACT_520250]. During this  visit, participants will be  trained to use the device. Device 
training will  include finding the optimal individual stimulation intensity level (perceptible 
but not painful), that will be subject to change during the treatment phase. The site staff 
will also carefully review with the patient how to identify a qualifying migraine headache  
(see below) and provide detailed instructions on study procedures.  
 
If the research staff recognizes that the participant cannot tolerate the feeling of the 
electrical stimulation, the participant  may be withdrawn from the study .

 Template ID: CLI-I00101 Rev: 1.[ADDRESS_674824] of the study:  
• Treatments of migraine and headaches  with Nerivio™  should be performed as 
soon as possible after migraine headache or aura  began and always within one 
hour of symptom s onset. Treatments of mild headaches are accepted.  
•  Avoid taking rescue medications within two hours post-treatment (2 hours from 
start of treatment), if possible.  
• The treatment should be performed for at least 30 minutes (the recommended 
treatment duration is 45 minutes).  
 
The site personnel will be required to document the training session in the CRF.  
 Treatment phase: Participants will be instructed to use the device for the treatment of 
migraine and/or headaches  (see below) as soon as possible and always within 60 
minutes of onset during a period of up to 4 week s. Participants will be instructed to use 
the device with the intensity level identified during the device training visit ( and adjust as 
necessary ) and make sure the stimulation is perceptible but not painful . Participants will 
be instructed to avoid taking rescue medications within [ADDRESS_674825] pain intensity levels , the presence/absence of aura and associated 
migraine symptoms  (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and allodynia ) as well as  
the 
effect that their migraine attacks have on their daily routine and quality of life , at 
baseline, [ADDRESS_674826]-treatment may treat 
again with the Nerivio™  device  or may treat with usual care at that time or any time 
thereafter if the headache does not resolve. Participants will also be able to treat 
headache recurrence with the device. Migraine headaches that are not treated with the 
device may be treated with usual care.  
 The first reported treatment will be considered a "training" treatment, aimed to verify that 
the participants use the device properly, and will only be included in the safety analysis. 
The efficacy evaluation will be performed on the first treatment of a qualifying attack  (see 
below) following the training treatment (hereby [CONTACT_336750] “test treatment”). 
 
Qualifying migraine headache 
A qualifying migraine headache is defined as a migraine headache that:

1. Is of moderate or severe intensity and preceded by 24 hours of no pain or mild 
intensity pain; or is of mild intensity and preceded by 24 hours of no pain  
AND  
2. Occurred in a setting in which the patient could properly administer the treatment 
(that is, it is possible to initiate a complete treatment within 60 minutes of onset 
and the participant will be able to complete the migraine diary at 2 hours after treatment) 
 
Third visit - Follow -up phase:  
Following the 4-week period of the treatment phase, participants will return to the clinic 
to fill questionnaires assessing satisfaction and user experience. All participants who 
complete the treatment phase will enter  an additional  8-week phase in which the device 
can be incorporate in to their usual care.  Participants will treat their migraines and 
headaches according to their preference- treatment with Nerivio only, treatment with 
medication only, both treatment options , or none. Participants will be asked to report all 
their migraine headaches at onset (migraines or headache), regardless if they are using 
the device or not. The participants will use the app to record pain intensity levels , the 
presence/absence of aura and a ssociated migraine symptoms  (nausea, photophobia, 
phonophobia, and allodynia) as well as the effect that their migraine attacks have on 
their daily routine and quality of life, at baseline, [ADDRESS_674827]-treatment.  
Fourth (final)  visit – End of study:  
Participants will return to the clinic following the end of the follow -up phase, at which time 
they will return the device. The participants will have the option of returning the device 
by [CONTACT_336751]-site visit.  Participants may be asked to fill additional 
questionnaires on their migraine and their experience with the device.  
 
6.3.1. Study duration 
The duration of the stud y for each participant is expected to be [ADDRESS_674828]-treatment without the use of rescue medication. Pain relief is defined as an

be resolved, the database will be locked, cleaned and exported for final statistical 
analysis. A study report will be issued following the final database lock.  
 
6.6. Data management  
The data management function will be supported by a cloud-based electronic data 
capture ( EDC ) system developed by [CONTACT_336752].IO (Modi’in, Israel). FlaskData.IO 
provides services for collection and remote monitoring of clinical trials data, compliant 
with HIPAA and [ADDRESS_674833] data and promptly resolve 
these  issues.  
 Data collected by [CONTACT_336753] a secured cloud-based 
database where it will undergo analysis aimed at detecti ng of missing data and other 
inconsistencies. The smartphone will transmit PRO and technical data containing 
activation times, stimulation intensity and ePRO via the smartphone to a central electronic database for analysis. Activities such as repeatedly aborted programs, missing 
feedbacks, inconsistent stimulation intensity adjustments, will be communicated to the 
research coordinator of the corresponding site, using the participants’ ID codes. 
Automated means were developed to identify and provide corresponding notifications 
regarding events that may lead to protocol deviations and/or missing data, and which 
resolution may require involvement of study personnel . Examples of such events include 
missing PRO data or low device battery level. An automated system was implemented to notify  the participant, site study coordinator and the s ponsor’s  study monitor of such 
issues . Missing data will be automatically identified by a script running on the cloud of 
FlaskData.IO , and queries will be generated to the participants and the corresponding 
site study coordinator. Near real time detection of problems in accumulating data will 
allow timely generation and resolution of queries. Intermediate data processing and 
translation into eCRF format will be performed. Processed data are further pushed into 
the EDC system.

A daily back -up of the database will be  performed.  In addition, a copy of each 
participant’s ePROs and other activities  will be  stored in his/her smartphone memory and 
can be retrieved if needed.   
EDC tools will be used for locking the database and exporting to SAS compatible format 
for interim and final statistical analyses . Query resolution will  also be performed using 
EDC tools. All paper -based source data and relevant medical documents that also serve as source 
documents will be maintained by [CONTACT_336754]. 
participant identification will be removed from all data and the participants  will be 
identified by [CONTACT_336755]. The site investigator is responsible for ensuring that eCRFs are filled in a timely manner and that relevant paper documents are properly stored. The 
investigator s will provide the documents to the sponsor either through the sponsor 
representative or by [CONTACT_520251] ’s request. 
Access to data will be authorized and controlled, in accordance with relevant regulations  
and guidelines.

treatment. Calculations show that a sample size of 1 10 participants would provide 80%  
power to determine that 60% (±6%) of the participants  will achieve pain relief at [ADDRESS_674846]-treatment. The sample size may be increased to up to 120 participants  to account 
for a potential ~10 % drop -out rate and/or missing data.  
 
7.4. Analysis sets 
Intent to treat analysis set (ITT)  
The ITT analysis set includes all patients undergoing the treatment phase.  
  
Modified intend to treat analysis set (mITT) 
The mITT analysis set includes all patients undergoing the treatment phase and treat a 
test treatment within [ADDRESS_674847] 
baseline assessment will not be included in the relevant analysis.   
 
Per-protocol analysis set (PP)  
The PP analysis set includes all patients from the mITT analysis set without major 
protocol deviations. Main protocol instructions include: 
• has started within 60 minutes of migraine symptoms  onset 
• was administered to treat a qualifying migraine headache 
• was administered for at least 30 minutes  
• includes data on pain intensity at [ADDRESS_674848]-treatment 
• rescue medication was not used before or within [ADDRESS_674849] -treatment 
 
Statistical analysis of the analysis sets

 Template ID: CLI-I00101 Rev: 1.[ADDRESS_674850] treatment and will be used 
for all efficacy asse ssments. If th is treatment is not evaluable (i.e., no pain data at [ADDRESS_674851]-treatment), a subsequent treatment of a qualifying migraine headache with 
evaluable data will be considered the test treatment.   
Use of rescue medication before the 2-hours assessment will be considered a 
treatment failure for the 2-hours endpoints, and before the 24 hours assessment for the 
sustained 24-hours endpoints . The percentage of participants achieving each of the 
efficacy  outcomes will be presented  in a tabular form along with two-sided 95% exact 
confidence intervals .  
For the associated symptoms outcomes, the observed response proportions and corresponding 95% exact confidence intervals for each associated symptom will be 
provided. All patients with baseline and 2 hours values will be included in the analyses. 
A response in each associated symptom (nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia) is defined as change from presence of a specific associated symptom at 
baseline to absence of the same associated symptom at [ADDRESS_674852]-treatment.  
 In addition, logistic regression models will be used to assess the efficacy . Baseline 
value and site will serve as covariates. The efficacy  endpoint (pain relief at 2 hours)  may also be evaluated in attacks with aura 
and attacks without aura separately.  
 
7.5.4. Safety a nalysis 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_336757], including adverse events. Serious adverse events, device-related SAEs, adverse events (by [CONTACT_336758]), device-related AE, adverse device reactions and device malfunction rates 
will be documented. Treatment tolerability, the number and percent of subjects who fail 
to complete the study and the number and percent of subjects who fail to complete the study because of adverse events will be presented. Time to withdrawal will also be 
assesse d and presented by [CONTACT_5263] -Meier curves.

7.5.5. Treatment by [CONTACT_336759]. Centers with less 
than 10 subjects will be grouped together by [CONTACT_224161]. If the center term is 
found significant (p<0.1), the reason for this interaction will be further explored. This 
evaluation may include demographic features, symptoms at presentation, clinical and 
treatment history, and site comparability in the features found to be associated with the 
primary endpoint variables. Adjustment for other covariates such as demographics or other baseline subject characteristics may be performed by [CONTACT_288377] 
a logistic regression model. 
The analysis may be repeated for US sites vs. out of US (O US) sites. 
 
7.5.6. Handling of missing data 
Sensitivity analys es of the efficacy endpoints may  be performed to assess the impact 
of missing data of pain severity at [ADDRESS_674853]- treatment on the efficacy outcomes . 
This will be performed using several possible imputation methods  including, but not 
limited to: 
• Observed data: use only treatments with non-missing pain data who did not 
withdraw early from study. 
• Dropout/AE Imputation: a subject with no post baseline measurement of pain or 
a subject withdrawn due to an adverse event or treatment intolerability should be 
considered as a non-responder for this analysis. 
• Worst Case Scenario: assumes that all subjects with missing pain data are failures.  
• Best Case Scenario: assumes that all subjects with missing pain data are 
successes.  
 
8. Data management  
8.1 Data capture 
Data capture will be performed using an e lectronic data collection (EDC) system in 
conjunction with electronic patient reported outcome (PRO) collection tools implemented 
in the smartphone application. The clinical sites will use electronic case report for ms 
(eCRFs) to document the information required by [CONTACT_336760].  
The EDC provider is FlaskData.IO . The EDC enables  secure collection, transmission, 
validation, monitoring and real -time administration of the data collected at the sites and 
by [CONTACT_336761]. The system offers a password-restricted access to 
clinical trial information based on individuals' roles and responsibilities. The EDC is compliant with 21 CFR Part 11 and FDA’s “Guidance: Computerized Systems Used in 
Clinical Investigation s.” 
Except for patient reported outcomes  which are directly reported by [CONTACT_520252] a pplication, data reported on the eCRF should be driven from source

 Template ID: CLI-I00101 Rev: 1.[ADDRESS_674854] data entry 
For several CRF fields , source data verification (SDV) may not be possible as entries 
may not be found in source documents ( i.e. patient reported outcome completed 
directly into the smartphone a pp). Therefore, the CRF may be used for direct data entry, 
but only in pre-defined fields.  
  
8.2 Data quality assurance 
To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects, a clinical data management review  of the patient data in the CRF will be performed by [CONTACT_456]. During this 
review, patient data will be assessed for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies. In addition, the data will be reviewed for adherence to the CIP and relevant regulations. To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management 
review process, data queries and/or site notifications will be issued by [CONTACT_456]. 
Discrepancy resolution will be documented within the database audit trail. 
 
8.3 Electronic signatures 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_336722], 
monitored and reviewed. The electronic signature [CONTACT_520257] , the data queries, and the site notifications, and agrees with the content. Any

audit.  
 
9. Amendments and deviations from  the protocol 
9.1. Protocol amendments 
The protocol cannot be amended by [CONTACT_336765]’s approval. Protocol amendments will be submitted for approval to local IRB/EC and, if applicable, to the respective regulatory authority (RA).  The amendments can be 
implemented in the study only after an IRB/EC and/or RA approval  are obtained. N on-
substantial changes (e.g. minor logistical or administrative changes, change of 
monitor(s), telephone numbers, renewal of insurance) which do not affect the rights, 
safety and well -being of human subjects and/or are not related to the clinical investigation 
objectives or endpoints, may only require a notification to the IRB/EC and/or regulatory  
without protocol amendment.

The following documents are relevant to the protocol but are not considered part of the 
protocol.  These documents  are stored and modified separately. As such, modifications 
to these documents do not require protocol amendments : 
• Site roster  
• Case report forms  
• Data management plan 
• Monitoring plan 
• Statistical a nalysis plan 
 
9.2. Protocol deviations 
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical study protocol, Good Clinical 
Practice, or related SOPs requirements. The deviation may be associated with  the 
subject, the investigator, or study personnel . The investigator /co-investigators must 
obtain the sponsor ’s approval  for all protocol deviations,  except for cases  in which the 
safety and well -being of a patient will be affected, as stated in section 4.5.4 b of the ISO 
[ZIP_CODE] (2011).   
Compliance with the protocol will be assessed by [CONTACT_336766], using designated reports provided by [CONTACT_27950]. 
All protocol deviations will be addressed in study subject source documents and promptly 
reported to the site IRB, according to local requirements.   
9.2.1 Procedures  for recording, reporting and analyzing protocol 
deviations 
All protocol deviations will be documented in source documents and appropriate 
eCRF s. 
The study monitor is responsible for identifying and reviewing protocol deviations with 
the investigator or designee and documenting the issue and action/outcome of the 
protocol deviation in the MVR and any follow up letter/communication with the principal 
investigator. The study monitor will ensure that major protocol deviations are discussed with the 
investigator. Major deviations include deviations that: 
• impact patient safety  
• alter the risk/benefit ratio  
• compromise the integrity of the data  
• affect willingness of the patient’s participation in the study  
 
The deviations will be reported to the IRB/EC periodically or as specified by [CONTACT_336767]. Further documentation of any changes in research activity should be 
submitted to the sponsor and the IRB/EC if t he deviations are related to any instance

of serious or continuing non-compliance with governing regulations/requirements of the 
IRB/EC, and/or  related to changes in protocol  specified patient activity and procedures.  
 In addition to the immediate reporting, t he study monitor will document all deviations in 
the monitoring visit report and follow -up letters. The monitor will discuss deviations with 
relevant site personnel. If needed, a note to f ile will be issued and filed in the relevant 
file and a copy will be sent to the sponsor. The sponsor or its designee will review 
records of deviations and will consider the need for corrective and preventive action and further external reporting to regulatory authorities. Deviations will be summarized 
and included in the study report. The potential impact/lack of impact of the deviations 
on the study results will be assessed .

requirements. 
 
10. Device accountability 
The devices will be provided by [CONTACT_336768] (sponsor), with all required labeling. The device number will be documented in the CRF and in the site log when 
provided to the participant. Each batch of devices delivered to the clinical sites for 
allocation to study participants will be  accompanied with a shipment note. The d evice 
shipment records will be  maintained by [CONTACT_336769].  
 Prior to distribution, the devices will be  stored in a designated locked cabinet. The access 
to the investigational devices will be controlled by [CONTACT_16133]. The devices will only 
be used in the clinical investigation and according to the study protocol . 
 Each device has a sticker on it with a unique number. When a device will be provided to 
the participant, it will be paired with the participant’s smartphone using Bluetooth 
connection. During device allocation, application installation and device– smartphone 
pairing, a site allocated u ser ID will be  entered by  [CONTACT_336770] a pplication.  
The three IDs ( user ID, phone ID, device ID) provide a mean  for identifying technical and 
PRO data from each participant in the electronic database while protecting participant’s 
privacy.  
 The investigator s will be responsible for the safe storage of the devices according to the  
instructions provided  by [CONTACT_336768], with restricted access to the 
investigational materials in their possession, thereby [CONTACT_520253] -006 Clinical

12. Adverse events 
Adverse event (AE) is  defined as  any unfavorable and unintended medical change, 
temporally associated with the use of the sponsor’s product, whether or not considered 
related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse 
change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the sponsor’s product, is also an adverse experience. An 
adverse device effect (ADE) is an adverse event related to the use of the investigational 
device. In this study the ADE refers to side effect and complications.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that leads to 
a) death,  b) serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in  
1) a life-threatening illness or injury, or  2) a permanent impairment of a body structure or  a body function, or  
3) in-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or  
4) medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to body structure or body function  
c) fetal distress, fe tal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
 A serious device related adverse effect (SADE) is an adverse event related to the use of 
the investigational device and that is considered by [CONTACT_520254]. 
12.1. Characteristics of AE s 
An investigator who is a qualified physician, will evaluate all adverse events  as to:

Maximum intensity 
Mild: awareness of symptom, but easily tolerated 
Moderate: definitely acting like something is wrong 
Severe: extremely distressed or unable to do usual activities  
 
Duration  
Record the start and stop dates of the adverse experience. If less than 1 day, indicate 
the appropriate length of time and units  
 Relationship of an AE and SAE to the study device  
The relationship of the adverse event to the study device is defined as:  
 Definitely  related: There is evidence of exposure to the device. The temporal sequence 
of the AE onset relative to use of the device is reasonable. The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_336773]. Dechallenge is positive. Rechallenge (if 
feasible) is positive. The AE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the device.  
Probabl y related: There is evidence of exposure to the device. The temporal sequence 
of the AE onset relative to use of the device is reasonable. The AE is more likely 
explained by [CONTACT_336773]. Dechallenge  (if performed) is positive.  
Possibl y related: There is evidence of exposure to the device. The temporal sequence 
of the AE onset relative to use of the device is reasonable. The AE could have been due 
to another equally  or less  likely cause. Dechallenge (if performed) is positive.  
Definitely  not related: The subject/patient did not use the device; or temporal sequence 
of the AE onset relative to device use is not reasonable; or there is another obvious 
cause of the AE. 
12.2. Reporting of AE s and SAE s 
All adverse events will be recorded in appropriate adverse events case report form. The 
adverse events will be used for the safety assessment. An on-site visit to monitor the 
adverse event will be conducted if the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_336726]. 
These visits will be reported using designated case report forms. If during the last visit, 
an ongoing device-related AE is present, the participant will be monitored for approximately [ADDRESS_674859] report any SAE or SADE to the sponsor within 1 business day :

shortly after the treatment. 
The following migraine symptoms are foreseeable and will not be considered as device 
related: headache, nausea, light sensitivity, sensitivity to noise, allodynia, abdominal 
pain, loss of appetite, cold or heat sensation, paleness, fatigue, dizziness, a nxious mood, 
fever (rare), blurred vision, vision symptoms such as bright flashing dots or lights, blind spots, wavy or jagged lines ( aura). 
 
12.4. Device malfunction 
Device malfunction is an inadequacy of the device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, or performance, such as failure, use error or inadequate 
labeling. Device malfunctions  may or may not be associated with an adverse event.  
All device malfunctions  will be reported in the eCRF. Device malfunctions  that were  
associated with an SAE or that could have led to an SAE if a) suitable action had not been taken or b) intervention had not been made or c) if circumstance had been less 
fortunate, will be reported within 24 hours of occurrence. If possible and needed, the 
device(s) associated with malfunction or failure will be retained until arrangements for its 
collection are made by [CONTACT_456].  
 All device malfunctions  will be summarized and reported in the clinical study report and 
will be reported to the regulatory authorities according to local  reporting requirements.

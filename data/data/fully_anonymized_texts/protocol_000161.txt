1.0 Objectives  / Specific Aims  
 
Specific aims : Smoking cessation and relapse prevention represent and important opportunity to 
improve cancer survival rates (1, 2), reduce the risk of cancer treatment complication (3),  and 
improve the quality of life of patients with and survivors of cancer (4).  Previous studies showed that 
repetitive TMS (rTMS) reduced cue craving to smoking and treat nicotine dependent smokers (5, 6). 
Recently one study completed by [CONTACT_567322] 10 sessions of rTMS over the left 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) reduced cigarette consumption and cue craving, and also 
increased quitting rate  on target quit date in nicotine dependent smokers. Thus, we propose 
conducting a controlled, double -blind trial comparing the effect of   treatments of active rTMS and 
sham rTMS on cigarette abstinence days, cigarette consumption and smoking craving durin g a 7 -days 
of quit attempt period in 20 nicotine -dependent patients with cancer. Specific aims are: Aim 1: Assess 
a feasibility of the rTMS for smoking cessation in cancer patients. Aim 2: Obtain preliminary estimates 
of whether one -week active rTMS of lef t DLPFC tends to be more efficacious than sham rTMS during 
a 7-days of quit attempt laboratory model period increasing abstinence days, and also decreasing 
cigarette consumption and cue -elicited craving in cancer patients with smoking.   
 
1.1. Primary objective  
 To assess a feasibility of the rTMS for smoking cessation in cancer patients:  The primary feasibility 
measures are  (1) whether or not we can enroll 20 cancer patients  with smoking  within 12 months ? (2) 
Study attrition. How many subject s can complete 7 -day quit attempt during rTMS treatment ? How 
many subjects will complete one -month follow -up? (3) To m easure the percent completion of 
assessment measures.  
 
 
1.2 Secondary objectives  
To obtain preliminary estimates of whether one -week activ e rTMS of left DLPFC tends to be more 
efficacious than sham rTMS during a 7 -days of quit attempt laboratory model period increasing 
abstinence days, and also decreasing cigarette consumption and cue -elicited craving in cancer 
patients with smoking.  
1.3 Exp loratory objectives  
Self-reported  number of cigarettes smoked per day, cue -induced craving (QSU – Brief), visual analog 
scale for craving and side effect will be measured pre and post each rTMS session. Other 
assessment, Carbon Monoxide, Fagerstrom Test fo r Nicotine Dependence (FTND ), and MNWS -R will 
be completed at baseline and the last TMS. Quitting attempt will verify daily CO < [ADDRESS_745196] few decades (1). About half of patients with 
cancer are now expected to survive their cancer for at least 1 0 years after diagnosis (2). However, 
many people with cancer still continue to smoke despi[INVESTIGATOR_567316] a known and often reversible 
cause of premature death as a result of cancer, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and several other 
diseases (4). In additio n, continued smoking after a cancer diagnosis increases the risk of second 
primary tumors and cancer recurrence and it a cause of treatment complications (5). Smoking 
cessation after a diagnosis imparts significant survival benefits for people with cardiov ascular disease, 
                                                      Version #2; Version Date: 9/27/2017  
 Page 3 of 15  diabetes, and multiple sclerosis (6). That is, all -cause mortality among cancer survivors who continue 
to smoke after a diagnosis is significantly worse than those who have never smoked (1).  
 
2.2. Smoking Cessation for Cancer Patients   
In 2008, when the US department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines for tobacco 
cessation were last updated, 10 specific recommendations for treatment were formulated as a quick 
guide to the overall principles (7). While some patients may quit on their own or require minimal 
advice to quit, it is essential to keep in mind that the treatment of tobacco use in many patients with 
cancer may require a more intensive and comprehensive approach (2 5). Unfortunately, very few 
smoking cessation studies have been conducted in the cancer setting, and their focus is usually on 
the delivery of behavioral in tervention rather than the effectiveness of a specific therapy or 
pharmacotherapy (8, 9). Likewise, patients with cancer are usually excluded from pharmacologic 
smoking cessation trials, mostly owing to concerns about the patients’ ability to participate in and 
complete a trial and the difficulty of determining whether any emerging side effec ts are due to the 
cancer or cancer treatment or to a smoking cessation medication.   
 
2.3. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Smoking Cessation   
To date, several human studies have begun to evaluate the effects of rTMS applied to the lateral or 
medial p refrontal cortex on cue -induced craving and cigarette consumption (5, 10-12). In one previous 
study, experimenters (10) administered high frequency rTMS to the left DLPFC of treatment -seeking 
smokers.  Sub jects received 20 trains of either real or sham rTMS (20Hz, 90% motor threshold, 2.5 
secs-on, 42.5 sec intertrain intervals for a total of 1000 pulses) over the left prefrontal cortex.  These 
investigators found that while real rTMS was associated with sig nificant reduction in terms of the 
number of cigarettes smoked in comparison with sham stimulation (p < .01), levels of craving did not 
differ significantly between the groups. In contrast, Amiaz and colleagues reported that rTMS (100% 
rMT, 10Hz, 20 train/ day, total 1000 pulses) of the DLPFC reduced both cigarette craving and 
consumption (5).  One study has recently completed a preliminary parallel -groups sham -controlled 
trial of rTMS in combination with the ni cotine patch to treat tobacco addiction in heavily -dependent 
patients with schizophrenia (13). They found that rTMS did not increase abstinence rates, but did 
significantly reduce tobacco cravings induced by [CONTACT_69506] -term (30 -60 minutes) abstin ence, which was 
assessed before application of the nicotine patch. Recently Dinur -Klein and colleagues reported that 
deep rTMS of the prefrontal and insular cortices reduced cigarette consumption and nicotine 
dependence (14). A recently completed exploratory study led by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_218335] a controlled, double -blind 
method to compare the impact of daily treatments of active rTMS (delivered to DLPFC) vs sham rTMS 
on cue craving and cigaret te consumption in nicotine -dependent cigarette smokers. We found that [ADDRESS_745197] smokers (15, 16). Each 
year, 40% of smokers try to quit, but 50% to 75% relapse within the first week of a quit attempt (17). 
Furthermore, withdrawal symptoms peak during the first few days of abstinence (18, 19), and these 
symptoms, in turn, predict relapse (20). These laboratory -based models of medication screening 
provide smokers with medication and assess the number of days of abstinence during a [ADDRESS_745198] 
reported that crossover design with laboratory model of 7 day  abstinence attempt has improved the 
efficacy of initial tests in smoking cessation for efficacy in smoking cessation drug discovery (15, 16, 
21-23).

 Page 4 of 15  3.0 Intervention  to be studied  
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (T MS) is a noninvasive (and relatively painless) brain stimulation 
technology that can focally stimulate the brain of an awake individual (24, 25). A localized pulsed 
magnetic field transmitted through a TMS  coil is able to focally stimulate the cortex by [CONTACT_567323] (26, 27)  induc ing electrical cu rrents in the brain (28). If TMS pulses are delivered 
repetitively and rhythmically, the process is called repetitive TMS (rTMS). rTMS for the treatment of 
depression was approved for one manufacturer by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 
October, 2008 (29, 30) and for a different device in January 2013. Researchers are investigating 
rTMS potential treatment effects in other neuropsychiatric disorders (schizop hrenia, pain, alcohol, 
cocaine, stroke) (31)Treatment parameters and groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007] – The time in the chair and the number of 
pulses on the head will be the same for all subjects. Active or sham T MS will be the only difference.  
The sham group only receives sham at all treatments. Stimulation frequency for all active subjects: 10 
Hertz – Pulse train duration (on time) 5 seconds, Inter -train interval (off time) 10 seconds (15 second 
cycle time), Pow er (intensity) level 100% rMT, Total 60 trains, 15 minutes, Total pulses 3000 per day, 
3000 x 10 = [ZIP_CODE] pulses for 10 sessions.  
 
The sham TMS system will be connected to an electrical generator on a 9 V battery and electrodes 
will be placed over the prefr ontal cortex. The regulator is triggered by [CONTACT_567324], 
microsecond, pulses of the electrical current through to the skin on the subjects' forehead. Electrical 
stimulation will be triggered by [CONTACT_567325] T MS pulses. To further 
assess the adequacy of the mask, TMS administrators, clinical raters, and patients will complete “best 
guess” questionnaires, assessing their best guess as to treatment condition, and their level of 
confidence in this guess.  
 
4.0 Study Endpoints   
4.1 P rimary efficacy endpoint  
 Conducting feasibility includes:   (1) how many cancer patients with smoking can be enrolled in 12 
months. (2) Study attrition. How many subjects can complete 7 -day quit attempt during rTMS 
treatment. How many  subjects will complete one -month follow -up. (3) Measurement strategy - percent 
completion of assessment measures.  
4.[ADDRESS_745199] one 24 -hour period of 
abstinence will be recorded as “0” days abstinent.   
4.3. Exploratory endpoints  
 Self-reported  number of cigarettes smoked per day, cue -induced craving (QSU – Brief), visual analog 
scale for craving and side effect will be measured pre and post each rTMS session. Other 
assessment, Carbon Monoxide, FTND, and MNWS -R will be co mpleted at baseline and the last TMS. 
Quitting attempt will verify daily CO < [ADDRESS_745200] rTMS session.   Cigarette consumption will be evaluated by [CONTACT_7939]: 
‘how many cigarettes do you now smoke on an average d ay?’ Craving will be assessed by [CONTACT_7939]: 
‘how much do you want to smoke a cigarette right now on a scale from 1 to 10?’  Nicotine 
dependence will be assessed by [CONTACT_567326].

procedures, risks and benefits will be explained.  
 
9.0 Consent Process  
 
Informed cons ent will be completed prior to conducting any research procedures.  The patient will be 
given sufficient time to read the informed consent and the opportunity to ask questions. Study 
personnel will review the consent with the participants in a private sett ing and assess participant’s 
understanding of the study.  Patients will be informed that the participation is voluntary and that they 
may withdraw consent to participate at any time, they will be informed that choosing not participate 
will not affect the c are that patient will receive for the treatment for his/her cancer. Participants not 
able to understand the consent after help from the study personnel, and those either excluded or 
unwilling to participate after the informed consent procedure, will be pro vided with an appropriate 
referral for smoking ces sation if they are interested.  After having obtained the consent, a copy of the 
informed consent form will be given to the patient.  
 
 
10.0 Study Design  / Methods  
 
10.1 General Design of the Study  
 
This is a randomized, double -blinded design of active rTMS and sham rTMS. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_187060] a 
total of 20 nicotine -dependent patients with cancer. Subjects will be randomized to either sham rTMS 
or real rTMS over the  left DLPFC. At the end of 7-day study, everyone can be referred to the Hollings 
Cancer Center (HCC) Tobacco Treatment Program for active treatment.   
 
10.2 Baseline Evaluation  
 
After the informed consent  is obtained , participants will be assessed for study incl usion/exclusion 
criteria.    
 (1) Demographic Data: Basic demographic information including age, gender, race, and medical 
history will be collected. (2) Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) (32): This is a well -
standardized structured instrument used to provide quick and accurate DSM -IV psychiatric diagnoses.  
The MINI will be used to conf irm the inclusionary/exclusionary diagnoses in the participants. (3) 
Tobacco Use History:  Detailed history of current and past tobacco use will be obtained, including 
cigarette smoking.  The questions addressed will include the amount, frequency, duration  of smoking, 
preferred brand, reasons for smoking, smokeless tobacco, family history, etc. (4) Fagerstrom Test for 
Nicotine Dependence (FTND) (33):  This is a self -rating questionnaire for nicotine dependence. (5) 
Questionnaire of Smoking Urges - Brief (QSU -B) (34):  This is a 10 -item self -rating questionnaire for 
assessmen t of craving.   (6) Minnesota Withdrawal Scale - Revised (MNWS -R) (35): MNWS -R is a 
DSM -IV based instrument to assess symptoms of nicotine withdrawal . (7) Biomarkers:  We will also 
use carbon monoxide (CO) level in the expi[INVESTIGATOR_567317] a standard CO breathalyzer at each visit. (8) 
Tobacco diary: This is a daily diary of all tobacco products consumed in the period between visits, 
                                                      Version #2; Version Date: 9/27/2017  
 Page 7 of 15  including cigarettes.  Pa rticipants will maintain a daily tobacco diary, which will be collected at each 
visit.     
 
10.3. TMS Procedures  
(1). All TMS procedures will be performed by a highly trained faculty or staff member of the Brain 
Stimulation Laboratory at MUSC under the su pervision of a licensed M.D. with specialized training in 
TMS delivery. (2). Treatment parameters and groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007] – The time in the chair and the number of 
pulses on the head will be the same for all subjects. Active or sham TMS will be the only difference.  
The sham group only receives sham at all treatments. Stimulation frequency for all active subjects: 10 
Hertz – Pulse train duration (on time) 5 seconds, Inter -train interval (off time) 10 seconds (15 second 
cycle time), Power (intensity) level 100% rMT, To tal 60 trains, 15 minutes, Total pulses 3000 per day, 
3000 x 5 = [ZIP_CODE] pulses for 5 sessions. If patients can not complete 5 sessions, they can complete 5 
sessions within 7-day quit attempt  (3). Subject Preparation for TMS delivery - The subject will be 
asked to remove and store any glasses or earrings, and to remove wallets from their pockets if they 
contain magnetic media (e.g., credit cards).  They will be asked to empty their bladder to avoid 
treatment interruption. Ear protection will be provided.  (4). Resting Motor Threshold (rMT): At entry, 
we will determine each subject’s rMT and all rTMS dosing will be given relative to this value. The coil 
will be positioned over the area of the skull roughly corresponding to the motor cortex and then 
systemat ically moved and adjusted until each pulse results in isolated movement of the right thumb. 
Once we completed “threshold hunting”, we will use a modified PEST algorithm attached EMG to 
determine rMT. (5). Localizing the TMS Coil over DLPFC: At a visit afte r providing informed consent, 
participants will be fitted with a white lycra swim cap. This cap will be worn during all TMS sessions in 
order to insure proper placement of the TMS coil across visits. Localization of the stimulation site in 
the prefrontal c ortex will be performed using Bean Method developed by [CONTACT_2296] (36). (6). Treatment 
administration: The Neuronetics TMS will be used for the study. ( 7). Active Sham rTMS: Successful 
patient and operator masking is key to the success of this trial. In one of our previous studies, we 
have successfully developed an active  sham system (37). To further assess the adequacy of the 
mask, TMS administrators, clinical raters, and patients will complete “best guess” questionnaires, 
assessing their best guess as to treatment condition, and their level of confidence in this guess.  
 
10.4. The 7 days of a quit attempt: Participants will be asked to start a quit attempt after the 
first TMS session.   
 
During the abstinence attempts, subjects will be told that you “go as long as you can without 
smoking”.  We will compare the numbers of cigarettes smoked and days of abstinence between active 
rTMS week the sham rTMS week.

outcomes over time.  General linear mixed models, ideal for mod eling repeated longitudinal outcome 
data, will be used to estimate the potential treatment benefit of rTMS on numbers of cigarettes 
smoked per day.  Poisson (or negative binomial) regression models will be used to estimate the 
potential treatment benefit o f rTMS on numbers of days abstinent from cigarette smoking during their 
7-days following their quit attempt.  The regression models will allow us to estimate rTMS treatment 
benefit along with 95% confidence intervals.  All analyses will be conducted in col laboration with the 
SCTR BERD biostatisticians.  
 
The data from follow -up will be used to measure the durability of one week rTMS treatments. We 
hypothesized that the number of quit day would predict a long -term effect for smoking cessation.  
 
Electronic and  hard copy CRF’s will be provided for the recording of data.  With the exception of hard 
copy case report forms utilized for expedited reporting requirements, such as the reporting of SAE’s, 
the remainder of patient data will be collected and submitted via  electronic CRFs. All data should be 
substantiated by [CONTACT_567327] a patient research record. ICH Good 
Clinical Practices are to be followed.  
 
Electronic data for on study and follow -up patient data is submitted via REDCap. R EDCap is 
managed from the Medical University of South Carolina as a consortium partner under their CTSA. 
REDCap CRF is a secure, Web -based application designed to capture and manage research study 
data.  
 
The system has been reviewed for 21CFR Part [ADDRESS_745208] iance and has been deemed “21CFR 11 
Capable.” Users of the REDCap system are limited to members of the IRB approved research team

12.2 Data analysis  
 
General considerations:  All data will be analyzed in consultation ([CONTACT_453255]) with the electronic 
system called REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). Statistical analyses will be performed 
using SPSS 22.0 (IBM Inc.). Baseline demograp hic and baseline characteristics, together with safety 
analyses will be performed on all enrolled subjects. Baseline values are defined as the measures on 
screening visit. The standard summary statistics for continuous variables are: mean, standard  
deviati on, median, minimum and maximum. The standard summary statistics for categorical variables 
are: count and percentage.  All statistical tests will be two -sided. For comparison of means 
(continuous variables), the two -sample t -test or the Wilcoxon rank sum t est will be used as 
appropriate. For comparison of proportions (discrete data), the Chi -squared test will be used as 
appropriate. All test performed  at significance ɑ = 0.05.  
 
To assess a feasibility of the rTMS for smoking cessation in cancer patients:  The numbers of subjects 
who were randomized and who entered and completed each visit of the study will be provided, as well 
as the reasons for all post -randomization discontinuations, grouped by [CONTACT_567328]. The discontinued subjects, pro tocol deviations, and subjects excluded will be proved as well.   
 
To obtain the secondary estimates:  The abstinence days, and cigarette consumption and cue -elicited 
craving will be compared between the active TMS and sham groups with a t -test or a repeated 
measures analysis of covariance model. Baseline daily number of cigarettes smoked, sex and center 
will be used as covariates.  
  
To analyze the exploratory measures:  cue-induced craving (QSU – Brief) and visual analog scale for 
craving will be measured pre and post each rTMS session. Other assessment, Carbon Monoxide, 
FTND, and MNWS -R will be compared b etween two groups.  
 
12.3Safety analysis  
 
Following standard procedures, frequency and severity measures of side effects will be constructed 
from the clinical measures. Descriptive statistics as well as changes from baseline will be presented 
by [CONTACT_567329].  
 
13.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects   
 
1.  Trial Management:  The study will be managed from the Brain Stimulation Lab within the 
Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Medical University of South Carolina.   
2.  Data Management and Analysis:  Data will be entered by [CONTACT_351768] a 
computer using standard database software.  The data analysis plan is outlined in the Data 
Analysis Plan section.  
3.  Quality Assurance:  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_567319] s to discuss 
qualitative comments received during data collection and any problems in data collection.  The 
statistician will periodically examine the database to look for irregularities.  Initial data analyses will 
examine distributions of variable scores , and comparability of baseline characteristics across 
conditions in case analyses need to be adjusted for these.  Confidentiality protections are outlined 
above.  
4.  Regulatory Issues:  All unexpected Adverse Events (AEs) will be reported to the MUSC IRB and 
Committee on Human Research within 48 -business hours.  Serious AEs will be reported within 24 -
business hours.  Follow -up of all unexpected and serious AEs will also be reported to these 
agencies.

 Page 10 of 15  5.  Definition of AE and SAE:  An AE  is defined as any untoward  medical occurrence in a study 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment (ICH GCP).  Any unwanted change, physically, psychologically or 
behaviorally, that occurs in a study parti cipant during the course of the trial is an adverse event.  A 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that has one of the following 
outcomes: death, life -threatening, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929],  persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6.  Documentation and Reporting:  AEs/SAEs are documented and reported as per IRB 
requirements. Research staff will identify adverse events and obtain all available informati on to 
assess severity, seriousness, study relatedness, expectedness, outcome and the need for change 
or discontinuation in the study intervention.  Adverse events are generally documented on AE 
Logs and AE Case Report Forms (CRFs).  Additional relevant AE information if available will be 
documented in a progress note in the research record as appropriate to allow monitoring and 
evaluating of the AE.  If the AE meets the definition for serious, appropriate SAE protocol specific 
reporting forms are completed and disseminated to the appropriate persons and within the 
designated timeframes as indicated above.  For each AE/SAE recorded, the research staff will 
follow the AE/SAE until resolution, stabilization or until the participant is no longer in the study as 
stated in the protocol. We will report adverse events to the Medical MUSC IRB online per the 
IRB’s guidelines.  
7. Study endpoints proposed: The study is considered completed with the last visit of the last subject 
undergoing the study. Safety concerns, inclu ding a high rate of seizures (5%) can cause early 
study termination.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_745209] will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following 
reasons:  
1. Withdrawal of consent  
2. Subject is not compliant with requirements of the study, including inclusion criteria and exclusion 
criteria  
3. The study is prematurely stopped  
4. The investigator believes that for safety reasons it is in the best interest of the subject to stop 
treatment.  
5. Subject motor threshold cannot be located.  
6. Subject v oluntarily withdraw s from the study without reasons.  
7. When a subject withdraws before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal will be 
documented on the CRF.  
15.0 Risks to Subjects  
 
 Potential Risks.  Investigational Device Exemption: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation is FDA 
approval device for depression treatment. It is an investigational device  for smoking cessation  The 
IRB at MUSC (in cooperation with the FDA) has determined repetitive TMS to be a non-significant risk 
intervention.  
 
Potential Risks of TMS:  
 
Potential risk of a seizure:  
The most serious side effect associated with rTMS is the accidental induction of a seizure. Although 
accidental seizures occur at a frequency of <0.1%, there are fa ctors that may increase the risk of 
rTMS triggering a seizure such as family history of seizures, alcohol use and previous neurological 
condition.  The risk of seizure induction is also related to the intensity, duration, frequency and rest 
interval of stim ulation  as well coil type . To date, [ADDRESS_745210] been  reported  with seizure s at 
                                                      Version #2; Version Date: 9/27/[ADDRESS_745211] H coil . To our 
knowledge, neuronetic stimulator with the parameters and settings we propose to use does NOT 
cause seizures.  
 
Potential for scalp discomfort and headaches:  
Some people report some mild discomfort when the magnetic pulses are applied over the scalp, and a 
small number of people (~5%) rep ort headache following rTMS. However, the headaches are 
temporary and manageable with common over -the-counter pain remedies.  
 
 
Potential hearing loss:  
The discharge of the TMS coil generates a high -energy click that may cause damage to the inner ear. 
Human s exposed to TMS have shown temporary increases in auditory threshold (especially at high 
frequencies) lasting at least [ADDRESS_745212] 
these changes and will be worn during TMS sessions.  
 
Potential change s in cognitive function:  
There have been no reports of long -term changes (more than a minute) in cognitive function (memory, 
attention, etc) in TMS studies. Safety studies specifically looking for these changes did not find any 
effects of TMS with the exce ption of one open study in which healthy volunteers were exposed to [ADDRESS_745213]. The stimulation par ameters exceeded 
the recommended safety range and there was no control for patient fatigue or other non -specific 
effects.  
 
Other potential effects of TMS on brain tissue:  
TMS is thought to be safe, with no brain damage, despi[INVESTIGATOR_567320]. 
We have reported a safety study looking at the MRI scans before and after [ADDRESS_745214] also performed an MRI 
diffusion imaging study before and after TMS/fMRI study and found no harmful effects of TMS on 
brain tissue at the site of stimulation.  
 
Safety in case of pregnancy:  
This protocol will exclude pregnant wom en. The risks of using TMS with pregnant women are 
currently unknown. If you are pregnant, or think you might be pregnant at any point during this study, 
please inform the investigators and the TMS will be discontinued immediately.  
 
 
Unknown Risks:  
TMS is  an experimental procedure that has not been approved by [CONTACT_4760] a treatment for nicotine 
craving and it may have unknown side effects. The researchers will let you know if they learn anything 
that might make you change your mind about participating in the study.  
 
 
Potential Risks of Nicotine Craving Laboratory Procedures:  
 
Risk of emotional distress:  
The procedures proposed in these studies are widely used in research and clinical evaluation 
procedures and have been shown to be safe.  
 
Risks regarding Confidentiality:  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_351226]’ anonymity and confidentiality, there is always some minimal risk 
of people other than the study investigators gaining access to your health information. Every effort will 
                                                      Version #2; Version Date: 9/27/[ADDRESS_745215] significant new findings during the course of the study, we will notify the patient.  
 
18.0 Drugs or Devices (if applicable)  
Neuronetics TMS is a treatment device for depression. We will use the TMS device for 
smoking cessation in cancer patients. TMS device is a claim of a non -significant risk device.

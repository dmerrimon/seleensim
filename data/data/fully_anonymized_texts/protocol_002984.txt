Title:  
DEMONSTRATION OF AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED CLOSED 
LOOP GLUCOSE CONTROL SYSTEM AS A THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IN  
TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 DIABETIC PATIENTS  
 
Study Des cription : Tight glucose control in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) setting is difficult to 
achieve. We hypothesize that a closed loop glucose control system based 
on artificial intelligence (AI) will improve upon the glucose control 
currently achieved by [CONTACT_547093] , and may improve the outcomes 
of critically ill patients, including those with COVID -19. This Earl Feasibility 
Study  (EFS)  will test the ability of a prot otype artificial intelligence based  
closed loop glucose control system  named FUSION,  to provide safe and 
effective  glucose control in subjects with  type 1 and type 2 diabet es in a 
clinical research center (CRC) setting. Subjects with type [ADDRESS_715644] in human study  of a new 
medical device, the controlled environment of the CRC is preferable to the 
less controlled environment of an ICU setting.  
 
Objectives:  
  
 Primary Objective s:   
 
1. The primary safety  objective of this first in human study is to test 
the hypothesis that an AI based closed loop glucose control system 
will be able  to safely  control the blood glucose levels of 
participants with  type [ADDRESS_715645] 
the hypothesis t hat a n AI based closed loop  glucose control  system  
will effectively  control the blood glucose levels of participants with  
type 1 and  type 2  diabetes  during a 24 hour stay in the CRC 
setting.  
 Secondary Objectives:

DEMONSTRATION OF AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED CLOSED LOOP GLUCOSE CONTROL SYSTEM AS A 
THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IN TYPE [ADDRESS_715653] 75% of ICU patients suffer from dysglycemia – hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and increased 
glucose variability.[ADDRESS_715654] is caused by [CONTACT_547098], and by [CONTACT_547099]’ inflammatory cascades, both of which can impair organ function including the kidneys, bone 
marrow, lungs and heart.5 A large prospective randomized study published in 2001 showed that tight 
glucose control in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients decreased their morbidity and mortality rates by 30 -
40%.[ADDRESS_715655] been seen in medical,11 cardiac,12 and trauma13 ICU setting s. 
 
As noted  below ( Figure 1 ) mortality  rate increases  as the  degree of hypoglycemia increases. In this study 
of 4,946 ICU patient s, the control 
patients  had no glucose values less 
than 81 mg/dL, and as a result had an 
overall mortality rate that was 46% 
lower than the group of patients who 
suffered at least one hypoglycemic 
event.14 
Shown below ( Figure 2 ) are  the 
deleterious  effects of both higher 
average glucose values and increasing 
glucose variability  (CV = coefficient of 
variation)  in a study of 4,[ADDRESS_715656]  2022

As can be deduced from Figure 2, the best patient outcomes would be achieved by [CONTACT_117354] a mean 
blood glucose level in the range of 70 -139 mg/dL while at the same time keepi[INVESTIGATOR_547011], as 
measured by [CONTACT_547100], to less than 15%.  
 
It is also essential to maintain the ICU patient’s glucose level in the clinician prescribed range. Seen 
below ( Figure 1) are results  from 2,550 non -diabetic ICU patients.16 The prescribed range being used for 
this study was 70 – 140 mg/dL. For purposes of analysis, there were an equal number of patients in the 
high time in range (TIR hi) and low time in range 
(TIR lo) groups. The patients with a high time in 
range (TIR hi) had a median percent time in 
range of 94%, while those wi th a low time in 
range (TIR lo) had a median value of 61%. The 
overall mortality rate for the patients with a low 
time in range was 86% higher than the high 
time in range group.  This study showed that 
mortality rates decrease significantly when the 
glucose  time in range 70 – 140 mg/dL exceeds 
90%. Non -diabetic ICU patients are more 
susceptible to the adverse effects of 
dysglycemia than are diabetic patients, and 
overall represent 75% of all ICU patients.

DEMONSTRATION OF AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED CLOSED LOOP GLUCOSE CONTROL SYSTEM AS A 
THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IN TYPE [ADDRESS_715657] failed to achieve effective tight glucose control, especially when it is defined as time in range 
of 70 - 140 mg/dL exceeding 90%, hypoglycemia (< 70 mg/dL) rate of less than 0.1%, and glucose  
variability as measured by a CV of less than 15%. This inability to effectively control blood glucose levels 
in critically ill patients has led to incorrect conclusions from some studies.  
 
In a large randomized prospective tight glucose control study of 6104 patients known as the NICE -
SUGAR study,17 the tight glucose control group (range 81 -108 mg/dL) actual ly had higher mortality rates 
than the control group (glucose < 180 mg/dL) – 27.5 vs 24.9% mortality rates. However, the tight glucose 
control group had a severe hypoglycemia (<= 40 mg/dL) rate of 6.8%, versus 0.5% in the control group. 
This large hypoglyc emia rate in the tight glucose control group would have significantly increased the 
mortality rate of this group, as can be seen above ( Figure 1 ). This  confounding  variable most likely led to 
the higher mortality rate in the tight glucose control group. In a post hoc analysis of their glucose data, 
the NICE -SUGAR investigators noted that there was an association between both moderate (41 -70 
mg/dL) and severe (<= 40 mg/dL) hypoglycemia and mortality rates in the patients they studied.18 The 
patient group that did not suffer from any hypoglycemia had a mortality rate of 23.5%, versus 28.5% and 
35.4% in the moderate and severe hypoglycemia groups (p<0.001 for both groups). The odds ratios of 
death were 1.6 and 2.6 in the moderate and severe hypoglycemia groups as compared to the patients 
who did not suffer any hypoglycemia. This confirms the importance of avoiding hypoglycemia while 
attempting to maintain tight glucose control in the ICU setting.  
After it was originally determined that tight glucose control improves ICU patient outcomes, multiple 
methods aimed at achieving tight glucose control in this challenging patient population were developed. 
The original method was paper based intravenous insulin dosing protocols.19 To utilize these, the nurse 
would manually measure the patient’s blood glucose level, then refer to the institutions paper based 
protocol to determine if any adjustment in the current intravenous insulin dose was n eeded, then go to 
the intravenous pump to make an adjustment to the intravenous insulin infusion rate. This cycle would 
repeat itself every [ADDRESS_715658] home grown paper 
based protocols, although it is still an open loop method. The nurse stil l manually measures the patient’s 
blood glucose level, enters the value into the Glucommander software, and then manually enters the 
new insulin dose recommended by [CONTACT_547101] [ADDRESS_715659]  2022 
 
  10 While the software -based insulin 
dosing calculators represent an 
improvement over paper -based 
protocols, they still are not capable 
of achieving a time in range (e .g., 
100 – 140 mg/dL ) that exceeds 90%, 
while at the same time avoiding any 
significant time in the hypoglycemic 
range and red ucing glucose 
variability. In a poster presentation 
presented at the 2016 American 
Diabetes Association meeting, it was 
noted that when Glucommander was 
used in 340 adult ICU patients with 
sepsis, it produced a time in range (70 – 180 mg/dL ) of 72%, and a hypoglycemia (< 70 mg/dL ) rate of 
0.51%.22 In a study done on 2,398 medical/surgical ICU patients, Glucostabilizer achieved a time in range 
(80-150 mg/dL) of 80.4% and hypoglycemia (< 70 mg/dL ) rate of 3.5%. In a study done on burn patients, 
Endotool was noted to achieve a time in range (80 – 110 m g/dL) of 47% and a hypoglycemia (<80 mg/dL) 
rate of 4.5%.23 In a multi -center medical ICU study on 508 patients, the Space GlucoseControl system 
time in range (80 -150 mg/dL) was 83% and hypoglycemia (<80 mg/dL) rate was 2.3%. These results for 
time in desired control range and hypoglycemia are summarized here  (Figure 2, Figure 3). 
It should be noted that the 
standard of care for achieving tight 
glucose control in ICU patients is 
insulin delivery via the intravenous 
rout e, and that ICU nurses will 
spend [ADDRESS_715660] prior attempts to achieve glucose control utilizing 
Figure 2– Although different ranges were reported, none were able to 
achieve > 90% time in range.  
 
Figure 3– Patient types treated were:  Sepsis (Glucommander), 
medical/surgical ICU (GlucoStabilizer), burn ICU (Endotool), medical ICU 
(Space GlucoseControl). Endotool and Space GlucoseControl hypoglycemia 
rates are for < 80 mg/dL.

control.22 Newer computerized glucose management systems, such as Endotool,27 utilize Model 
Predictive Control (MPC) theory28 and have enjoyed improved success compared to PID controllers in 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_547012],  and limiting the incidence of hypoglycemia. However, these 
systems still focus solely on the glucose lowering effects of insulin and do not consider the glucose 
elevating effects of glycogenolysis/gluconeogenesis – from the liver. This causes them to have  
unacceptably high rates of hypoglycemia and low time in the desired range,29 thus they are not suitable 
in their current format f or creating a closed loop glucose control system for use in the ICU setting. The 
failure of PID and MPC based glucose controllers to achieve safe and effective tight glucose control has 
led to the need to consider alternative control techniques.

be noted that the majority of deaths occurred in the group of patients whose admission glucose levels 
were less than 140 mg/dL.  
This points out the need  to remain vigilant for the development of hyperglycemia after admission, in 
COVID -19 patients whose admission blood glucose levels are less than 140 mg/dL, as the previously 
noted study by [CONTACT_547102] 24 and 
48 hours of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547017] (odds ratio 2.15 and 3.31, respectively).33 
The study by [CONTACT_547103] -diabetic patients admitted with COVID will often go 
on to develop hyperglycemia (e.g., > 140 mg/dL) after the first week of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n (Figure 6), thus  
vigilance for the 
development of 
hyperglycemia may need to 
be extended throughout the 
entirety of their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70210].  
 
In a study performed in Italy 
it was shown that the 
presence of hyperglycemia 
(>7.7 mmol/L) on admission 
significantly increases

Figure 6 - This graph demonstrates that non -diabetic COVID -19 patients who develop 
hyperglycemia (e.g., > 140 mg/dL = 7.8 mmol/L), will often do so after their 7th day of

  15 In this same study it was shown that in the 
group of 25 patients with hyperglycemia on 
admission, a non -randomized subgroup who 
electively chose to be treated with 
intravenous insulin  versus usual care with 
subcutaneous insulin, that the improved 
glucose control produced by [CONTACT_547104] ( Figure 7). The 
patients treated with intravenous insulin 
had a target glucose range of 7.77 – 9.99 
mmol/L. The patients treated with 
subcutaneous insulin received usual glucose 
control per their treating physician. The 
group treated with intravenous insulin were 
on the infusion for a mean of 32.7 ± 4.9 hours 
after entering the target glucose range of 7.77 
– 9.99 mmol/L. After cessation of the 
intravenous insulin, this group of treated 
patients received usual glucose control with 
subcutaneous insulin per their treating 
physician.  
 
One explanation for the improved outcomes in the patients treated with an intravenous insulin infusion 
may be a reduction in their inflammatory state and a reduction in their propensity to form blood clots, 
which  are two common and most likely re lated conditions seen in COVID -[ADDRESS_715670] been implicated in the development of ARDS in COVID -19 patients.43  
 
Finally, a laboratory study showed that when human peripheral monocytes are infected with CoV -2 
(COVID -19), the viral load of the monocytes after 24 hours of incubation in glucose containing medium 
was logarithmically related to the glucose level o f the medium the monocytes were incubated in.44  This

To date, most attempts to control the glucose level of COVID -[ADDRESS_715673] met with only marginal 
success, as their glucose levels are highly variable and nonlinear, making them difficult to control using 
the current open loop techniques. In a retrospective analysis of 562 ICU a dmissions at a single medical 
center, the patients with COVID -19 had statistically significant worse glucose control, versus non -COVID -

A multi -center retrospective analysis of 1,122 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60992] -19 patients demonstrated the

In these open loop systems, the nurse manually checks the patient’s blood glucose level every 1 -4 hours, 
enters the meas ured level into the insulin dosing software, and then manually enters the results of the 
insulin dosing software into the insulin infusion pump as depi[INVESTIGATOR_48393] ( Figure 11). These systems do 
not utilize a dextrose (D -glucose) component for purposes of con trol, which makes them prone to 
periods of hypoglycemia.

With use of the current open loop glucose control technique ICU patients still experience high rates of 
hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, low time in the desired glucose range, and large glucose variability.[ADDRESS_715677] of infections in the U.S., with 
currently more than 30,000 patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057],  and the potential for tight glucose control to lower 
mortality rates in hyperglycemic COVID -19 patients both with and without diabetes, development of a 
safe and effective closed loop glucose control system intended for use in COVID -19 patients is urgently 
needed.  
 
2.3 STUDY RATIONALE – FUSION AI BASED ARTIFICIAL P ANCREAS SYSTEM  
 
The novel glucose control system  to be tested in this study is an expert based rule system or Knowledge 
Based S ystem .49,[ADDRESS_715678]. Leon DeJournett,  who is the developer of the novel AI based glucose controller to be 
tested in this study. If successful, this controller could  be utilized in a closed loop glucose control system 
(artificial pancreas) for treatment of dys glycemia in ICU patients.  
 
Through an intensive review of how the native glucose control system  functions  (e.g., pancreas & liver) , 
a knowledge based multiple in put multiple  output  (MIMO)  glucose control system has been 
developed.52 The algorithm s of this system  use the four input variables of absolute glucose, glucose 
rate of change, weight based intravenous insulin dose and weight based intravenous dextrose dose.  
Based on the values of these f our input variables and the desired glucose control range, the two output 
variables of continuous intravenous insulin and continuous intravenous dextrose are adjusted. The 
results from the primary knowledge -based  controller are also run through additional knowledge based 
controllers. These additional controllers monitor for outlying situations such as rapid falls or rise of 
bloo d glucose levels. These  controllers will modify the two output variables from the primary controller 
if the clinical situation warr ants such a change. Through utilization of the proper control techniques  and 
frequent ad justment of the insulin and/or dextrose infusion rates (every 5  or 10 minutes) , tight control 
of glucose will be achieved. In addition, epi[INVESTIGATOR_547022],  
and glucose variability will be minimized.  
 
The20lucos n for continuing  clinical studies at this time is that thorough preclinical studies  and a small 
first in human study  of this controller have already been completed . The  preclinical studies included  the 
largest simulation study of a glucose controller published to date,53 and a comparative simulation study 
that showed cle ar superiority of the AI  based controller over Glucommander and several other ICU 
based glucose controllers.54 In addition, non-Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)  animal test ing using a 
swine model of stress induced hyperglycemia55 showed that the controller was able to achieve tight 
glucose control with no significant hypoglycemia .56 In a second larger animal study the artificial pancreas 
(AP) system demonstrated its ability to avoid severe hypoglycemia and minimize moderate 
hypoglycemia despi[INVESTIGATOR_547023] .[ADDRESS_715679] in human study on type 2 diabetic subjects in a CRC setting, the controller was able to 
mainta in a high percent time in range 70 -180 mg/dL while avoiding any hypoglycemia (< 70 mg/dL).  
[ADDRESS_715680]  2022 
 
  21 Both simulation studies used a mathematical model of the ICU patients glucose -insulin system that has 
been clinically validated.58 The two AI controller outputs of insulin and dextrose were incorporated into 
the model, such that the controller’s  outputs could attempt to bring cont rol to the modelled system as 
the system experienced time variant changes of its internal parameters, or was perturbed through time 
variant exogenous infusions of intravenous dextrose.  
 
In the first simulation study , ICU “patients” were created through use of time variant changes in their 
insulin sensitivity, volume of distribution and half -life. In addition,  variable rates of dextrose infusions 
were used to simulate potential clinical scenarios. The glucose sensor data also had variable degrees of 
accuracy ranging from 5 -15%, and bias ranging from ± 0-10 mg/dL.  Finally, three different starting 
glucose values  and seven different control ranges were used. This led to 126,000 unique simulations , 
each done  over a period of five days. This study produced 15 million hours of simulation time and 107 
million glucose values for analysis.53 As can be seen below ( Figure 12 ), when  the control range was set to 
100-140 mg/dL and the sensor error was 10%, the time in range of 70 -140 mg/dL was 95%, which is 
consistent with the  “time in range hi” group noted above  (Figure 1).  
 
Figure 12 – SE = sensor error.  DeJournett, Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, 2016.  
The controller also did an exceptional job of avoiding any significant hypoglycemic events with an overall 
rate of hypoglycemia (< 70 mg/dL) of 0.09% with a s ensor error of 10% as noted  below  (Figure 13 ). By 
[CONTACT_547105], clinicians can easily adjust the hypoglycemia rate towards zero , as 
was seen in the 100 -140 mg/dL control range group . For the entire study there were no glucose values 
less than 45 mg/dL.

As seen  below  (Figure 14 ), the  controller was just as adept at minimizing glucose variability as noted by 
[CONTACT_547106] 11. 1% when the sensor error was 10%.  The ability to minimize glucose variability to 
this degree should have a significant impact on ICU mortality rates as evidenced by  [CONTACT_547107]  2 above.

  23 In a second  simulation study the same mathematical model and time variant  changes were used to 
create 80 virtual “patients ,” and  a novel random walk sensor error method was used that guaranteed an 
overall sensor error of 10%. This study utilized five , time variant exogenous dextrose infusions to  
perturb the model and  produce d a total of 400 five -day simulations per controller. The AI cont roller  to 
be tested in the current study ,52 which is being commercialized  by [CONTACT_547108] (IMT) , was 
compared to the Yale protocol (YALE),59 Glucommander (GLUC),[ADDRESS_715683] et al PID controller

and Technolo gy, 2017.  
As can be seen from Table 6 the IMT  AI based controller showed clear superiority in this simulation 
study. It is important to note that the IMT controller achieved a time in range 70 -140 mg/dL greater 
than 95%, a CV less than 15%  and a hypoglycemia rate of 0.  Per the previous noted clinical  studies, all 
these results will correlate with improved survival of ICU patients , if they carry over to the real world 
setting . 
3.2 ANIMAL STUDIES  
Although the FDA does accept simulation testing as a sole valid method to accomplish pre -clinical 
testing of glu cose controllers,64-66 it was decided to perform two animal tests to assess the performance 
of IMT’s complete closed loop glucose control system in an in vivo setting. In th e first small pi[INVESTIGATOR_547024] A 
THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IN TYPE [ADDRESS_715684]  2022 
 
  24 study  a fully functional clo sed loop glucose control system , which is essentia lly the same system to be 
tested in the current  proposed  study, was utilized to complete a twelve hour closed loop glucose control 
study in a swine model of stress induced hyperglycemia.56 For this study  the stressors to the 
anesthetized swine included endotoxin infusion to mimic sepsis,67 lung aspi[INVESTIGATOR_547025] s yndrome ,68 and a high dose of Solumedrol to mimic the stress 
hormone response seen in critically ill patients.69 The animals also received dextrose boluses to elev ate 
their 24lucose e Levels at the start of the experiment, and high rates of dextrose infusions (5 -10 
mg/kg/min) to make glucose control difficult to achieve. In one scenario, the animals were under  type 1 
diabet es conditions through infusion of Octreotide ,70 with  C-peptide le vels confirm ing lack of native 
insulin production.  
As noted below ( Figure 15 ), the fully  functional artificial pancreas (AP) system was able to maintain the 
blood glucose level in a normal swine range of 40 -80 mg/dL in the animals that were rendered type I  
diabetics via an Octreotide infusion56 and simultaneously were in a state of stress induced 
hyperglycemia (SIH). While it is not surprising that the control animal that did not receive any insulin 
died,  the important point is that the treated animal was able to achieve effective tight glucose control  
which produced a lower stress state as noted by a normal lactic acid level.

  25 As can be seen below ( Figure 16 ), IMT’s  AI based glucose c ontrol system was just as effective in 
augmenting the animal’s intact endogenous insulin production. Although t he control animal was unable 
to bring its glucose level into the normal range throughout the course of the twelve hour experiment , 
IMT’ s AI based control ler was able to bring the glucose  level into  the desired range within [ADDRESS_715686] of the experiment . It should also be 
noted that the untreated animal had elevated lactic ac id levels com pared to the animal that achieved 
effective tight glucose control with  IMT’s AP system.

DeJournett, Diabetes, 2016.  
In the second animal study the safety and performance of the F USION  system was assessed using a 
swine model of unannounced hypo - and hyperglycemia challenges . For thi s test the F USION  system was  
composed of t he EIRUS (Getinge AB) CGM,  which is a CE marked CGM designed for use in the ICU 
setting,  the F USION  systems  artificial intelligence -based (AI -based) glucose control software, and two 
syringe pumps.  The study protoc ol is seen below ( Figure 17 ).

The results from the fully autonomous F USION  system were compared to an ICU physician who had 
access to every 30 -minute arterial glucose values and who used Dextrose 20% and NovoRapid to treat 
hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Both the control and treated animals had EIRUS CGM’s in place, and 
the glucose values from these CGM’s were used for statistical comparison. Not ed below ( Figure 18 ) are 
the median (25 -75) glucose values from both groups. As can be seen from this graph the F USION  system, 
acting in a fully autonomous mode, was able to avoid both severe hypoglycemia after the insulin bolus 
and rebound moderate hypoglycemia secondary to treatment of the induced hyperglycemic state. The

published in 2013,71 the set up pi[INVESTIGATOR_547033] (Figure 2 2) was utilized, with the overall form factor 
being very similar to the FUSION  system seen above ( Figure 20).

For this 48 -hour study on 24 ICU patients the control  range was 6-8 mmol/ L. The closed loop patients 
had Reference Glucose Value s measured on a blood gas machine every 30 minutes to 6 hours. The MPC

Although the closed loop system in this study improved upon the results from the local protocol, it was 
only able to achieve  a time in range 6-8 mmol/ L of 54%, a time in range  3.9-8 mmol/ L of 60%, and a CV

THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IN TYPE [ADDRESS_715704]  2022 
 
  35 Effective tight glucose control can decrease ICU mortality rates as has been previously reported.  In 
addition, significant improvement in morbidity is expected, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_547112]  a high time in range while at the 
same time having no hypoglycemia. In this Japanese study of 447 pancr eatic surgical patients,72 the tight 
glucose control group (80 -110 mg/dL) had an 86% time in range, while the intermediate control group 
(140 -180 mg/dL) had a 97% time in range, with neither group experiencing any hypoglycemi a. The tight 
glucose control group had a 58% reduction in the surgical site infection rate as can be seen below 
(Figure 2 3). 
 
 
Figure 23 – Okabayashi, Diabetes Care, 2014.  
 
A large study done at the John Hopkins Health System estimated that surgical site infections  (SSI)  cost 
their system around $21,000 per infection, or around $3.3 million annually.73 There are around 150,000 
SSI’s per year in the U.S., thus tight glucose control in these patients has  the potential to save around 
$1.8 billion per year.74  
 
This same Japanese closed loop glucose control study also demonstrated a 21% reduction in the length 
of stay in the more tightly controlled group, as noted below ( Figure 2 4).

Figure 24 – Okabayashi, Diabetes Care, [ADDRESS_715706] of care, as the latter is  directly correlated with length of stay.  
 
To emphasize the size of the problem, in the U.S there are 80,000 ICU beds with 6 million annual 
admissions,2 with the European Union experiencing similar numbers.75 The U.S. spends 150 billion 
dollars caring for these ICU patients.76 Given an average ICU mortality rate of 10%, an effective glucose 
control system that lowers  ICU mortal ity rates by [CONTACT_2669] 20%  would be expected to save 120,[ADDRESS_715707] $1,000 per patient , if used on 50% of ICU patients,  would be expe cted to  reduce overall 
U.S. healthcare costs by 3 billion dollars annually.  If the European Union were included, these numbers 
would be roughly doubled.  
 
 
4 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    
 
4.1 KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
The main risk associated with tight glucose control studies is hypoglycemia, with hypoglycemia being 
defined as any glucose value less than 70 mg/dL. The rate of hypoglycemia has traditionally been close [PHONE_058]
DaysHospi[INVESTIGATOR_205673]
80-110 mg/dL                                 140 -180 mg/dL
DEMONSTRATION OF AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED CLOSED LOOP GLUCOSE CONTROL SYSTEM AS A 
THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IN TYPE [ADDRESS_715708]  2022 
 
  37 to 20% in studies aiming at lower glycemic targets .77,78 In addition , hypoglycemia in tight glucose control 
studies has been associated with increasing mortality rates,14,18 although a causal relation ship has not 
been established. The immediate risk of a hypoglycemic event, especially a clinically important  one with 
glucose values less than 54 mg/dL, is impaired brain function resulting in a temporary coma, or a 
hypoglycemia induced seizure.79,[ADDRESS_715709] experienced hypoglycemic events.81,82 An additional potential risk of 
tight glucose control is the development of hypokalemia, which can lead to a prolonged Qt interval and 
potentially fatal  dysrhythmias. However, this issue has been reviewed and  it was found that  there was 
no ass ociation found between tight glucose control and development of prolonged Qt syndrome.83,84 
 
Hypoglycemia is a risk for any tight glucose control study, however the AI based FUSION glucose control 
system under study was particularly effective at avoiding hypogl ycemic events in the simulation and 
animal studies . When the control range was set to 100 -140 mg/dL in the simulation studies, no glucose 
values less than 70 mg/dL were recorded in either study . In the two subject first in human study the 
percent time in r ange less than 70 mg/dL was zero.  
 
The risk s of severe hypoglycemia (< 54 mg/dL) ; moderate hypoglycemia  (54 – 69 mg/dL)  with associated 
hypoglycemia symptoms of anxiety, irritability, sweating, hunger, shakiness, fatigue, pale skin, lethargy, 
seizures ; and symptoms of hypoglycemia at any level due to falling glucose levels (e.g., neuroglycopenia) 
will be mitigated by [CONTACT_54465]:  
1. Monitoring of the subject’s glucose level with two Dexcom G6 CGM’s.  
2. Sharing of the Dexcom G6 CGM’s values wi th study personnel via the Dexcom Follow App on 
two smartphones.  
3. Setting the Dexcom CGM’s to alarm for CGM glucose values less than 85 mg/dL.  
4. Measurement of Reference Glucose Value for any CGM glucose value less than 85 mg/dL.  
5. Measurement of Reference Glucose Values at a minimum frequency of every 1 hour.  
6. Measurement of Reference Glucose Values every 10 minutes if either CGM has a glucose value 
less than 70 mg/dL.  
7. Measurement of Reference Glucose Values every [ADDRESS_715710] recent Refe rence 
Glucose Value was less than 70 mg/dL.  
8. Measurement of a Reference Glucose Value at any time if the subject displays any of the above 
noted signs of hypoglycemia.  
9. Terminating the study  on subject  if the subject has a Reference Glucose Value less than 5 4 
mg/dL.  
10. Terminating the entire study if two subjects have a Reference Glucose Value less than 54 mg/dL.  
 
For purposes of this document, the term Reference Glucose Value  refers to the following:  
DEMONSTRATION OF AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED CLOSED LOOP GLUCOSE CONTROL SYSTEM AS A 
THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IN TYPE [ADDRESS_715711]  2022 
 
  38 1. A whole blood glucose value in mg/dL measured at the subject’s bedside using the FDA 
approved Nova StatStrip Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547035]. The whole blood sample should be 
immediately analyzed after it is taken from the subject.  
2. The whole blood sample should be taken from the following two sources, which ar e listed in 
their order of preference:  
a. Venous blood sample fr om a retrograde hand vein intravenous catheter  using the 
standard blood draw method of Emory University’s CRC.  
b. Capi[INVESTIGATOR_547036] a fingerstick using the standard fingerstick method of 
Emory University’s CRC.  
 
If the subject experiences severe hypoglycemia  as measured by a Reference Glucose Value , moderate 
hypoglycemia as measured by a Reference Glucose Value with hypoglycemia symptoms, or  
neuroglycopenia, they will receive th e following treatments  to minimize their risks : 
 
1. The subjects will be given free access to snacks and glucose containing juices  of sufficient 
quantity to raise their Reference Glucose Value  so that it is greater than 70 mg/dL and so that 
they are no longer experiencing any symptoms of hypoglycemia.  
2. The subjects will be given a rescue dose of 15 mL of 50% dextrose in any of the following 
scenarios:  
a. For a Reference Glucose Value less than 54 m g/dL.  
b. For a Reference Glucose Value of 54 -69 mg/dL with accompanying symptoms of 
hypoglycemia – anxiety, irritability, sweating, hunger, shakiness, fatigue, pale skin, 
lethargy, seizures . 
c. For any Reference Glucose Value when the subject is experiencing sig ns of hypoglycemia 
caused by a rapid fall in the subject ’s blood glucose level (e.g., neuroglycopenia)  and the 
ingestion of snacks or glucose containing juices do not relieve these symptoms within 10 
minutes from the time the snacks/juice is ingested.  
3. If intravenous access is no longer available and the subject has a Reference Glucose Value less 
than 70 mg/dL, or is exhibiting signs of neuroglycopenia, the subject will be given Glucagon 1 mg 
intramuscularly every 15 minutes as needed until their Reference Glucose Value  is greater than 
70 mg/dL on two consecutive checks  that are separated in time by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_715712] completely resolved.  
 
The other potential risks of partic ipating in this study in clude severe hyperglycemia, diabetic 
ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome, excessive blood removal (lab draws), and fluid 
overload.  
DEMONSTRATION OF AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED CLOSED LOOP GLUCOSE CONTROL SYSTEM AS A 
THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IN TYPE [ADDRESS_715713] in human testing, the current studies pro posed control 
range of 100 -140 mg/dL, and the above monitoring and risk mitigation strategies, no alternative 
procedures are warranted at this time.  
 
4.2 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
The immediate benefits for participants with diabetes  in a brief ( 31 hour) tight glucose control study in a 
CRC setting are limited. However, development of a closed loop glucose control system designed for use 
in the inpatient setting may have long term benefits for this patient population , as p reliminary studies 
have demonstrated improved outcomes through use of  automated closed loop glucose control in this 
group  in the  non-ICU inpatient setting .85,[ADDRESS_715714] is able to maintain a high time in the control range,16 while at the same time 
avoiding any hypoglycemia  events .14 Finally, safe and effective tight glucose control has the potential to 
lower critical illness related mortality including COVID -19 related mortality .35 
 
Long  term  potential benefits  for the ICU patient population  mainly relate to a shorter overall recovery 
period based on decreased comp lication rates and the potential for a shorter ICU  length of stay to 
decrease mortality rates after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].87 
 
4.3 ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
 
4.3.1  FAILURE OF DEXCOM G6 CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITOR (S) 
The risk of complete failure of the continuous glucose monitor ing system  will be mitigated through use 
of two Dexcom G6 CGM systems, which will provide redundancy to this critical component of the 
FUSION artificial pancreas system.  In addition, replacement of the Dexcom CGM system – sensor, 
transmitter , or receiver – will be a llowed if any of the se three components of an individual  CGM system 
experiences a failure.  To clarify, the FUSION system uses a simple average of the two Dexcom G6 CGM 
values to decide what steps to take to bring the subject’s blood glucose value into the desired control 
range. In order to be averaged, these two Dexcom G6 CGM values must be time stamped within [ADDRESS_715715]  2022 
 
  40 system . The FUSION system will automatically shut down after four  hours if it has only one Dexcom G6 
CGM system available for  use. The FUSION system will automatically shut down if it has no Dexcom G6 
CGM systems available for use for a period of time exceeding 20 minutes.  
The Dexcom G6 CGM Sensor/Transmitter pair communicate via Bluetooth, to the Dexcom G6 Receiver. 
IMT has  not altered in any way, how the Dexcom G6 CGM system works or handles communications 
between the Transmitter and Receiver.   The Dexcom G6 CGM system sends new glucose values to the 
Receiver every 5 minutes, if they are available, from the Sensor/Transmitter pair attached to the 
subject. The Dexcom G6 CGM manual notes that the Transmitter and Receiver must be within 20 feet of 
each other, with no obstacles between them (e.g., walls) in order to effectively communicate via 
Bluetooth. The FDA is aware of the 20 foot range limitation of the Dexcom G6 CGM system and has 
approved this CGM sy stem for use in artificial pancreas systems. IMT has developed software call ed a 
Driver, that queries the database of the Dexcom G6 Receiver, every 30 seconds, for new glucose va lues.   
When the Driver discovers new date/time stamped glucose values in the database of the Receiver, it 
brings these values into a glucose queue within the FUSION system for use by [CONTACT_547090]. The 
FUSION system will only average glucose values th at are time stamped within 5 minutes of each other. 
The all -in-one Medical Computer running the FUSION systems software is connected to the Dexcom G6 
CGM Receiver via a serial data cable. In our internal testing, each Dexcom G6 CGM Receiver was able to 
receive new glucose values from the Dexcom G6 Transmitter 99.53% of the time within the designed 5 
minute time interval.  
The benefit of using the Dexcom G6 CGM is that the FDA has already approved this system for use as an 
integrated continuous glucose monito r (iCG M) in automated insulin dosing  (AID) systems for use in 
treatment of patients with diabetes  in the outpatient setting. This study and  follow -up studies to be 
performed in the ICU setting will attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of using  the Dexcom G6 CGM 
system in an AID system (e.g., FUSION) designed for use in the inpatient setting.  
 
In addition, the study will also demonstrate the ability of the Dexcom G6 transmitter to simultaneously 
transmit its glucose data to one medical device (e.g., the Dexcom G6 Receiver) and the Dexcom G6  
Follow  App on a mobile phone placed [ADDRESS_715716]’s bed. Demonstration of this functionality 
is impor tant, as a mobile phone device will be needed in the ICU setting to provide remote monitoring  
(e.g., outside of the room)  of the subject ’s continuous glucose measurements . 
 
4.3.2  USE OF INNACURATE CGM GLUCOSE VALUE FOR GLUCOSE CONTROL  
The risk of using an inaccurate CGM value for glucose control  will be mitigated by [CONTACT_547113] . In addition, independent Reference Glucose Value s (Nova StatStrip 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547035] ) will be obtained every [ADDRESS_715717]  2022 
 
  41  
The benefit of using Dexcom’s G6 CG M, which has already been approved as an iCGM, is to determine 
its accuracy in different scenarios/settings (e.g., participants with diabetes  in the proposed  study; 
COVID -19 patients in ICU in future study).  
 
The benefit of obtaining Reference Glucose Value s every 10-60 minutes is to independently monitor for 
hypoglycemia in cases where the CGM systems are providing the FUSION system with false high glucose 
levels that could lead to hypoglycemia , or to monitor for hyperglycemia in cases where the CGM 
systems are providing the FUSION system with false low glucose levels that could lead to hyperglycemia . 
The Reference Glucose Value s can be used to administer rescue doses of 50% intravenous dextrose in 
cases of sev ere hypoglycemia (< 54 mg/dL) , moderate hypoglycemia (54 -69 mg/dL) with associated 
hypoglycemia  symptoms , or in cases of neuroglycopenia.  
 
4.3.[ADDRESS_715718] , which manifests as a 
sudden non -physiologic fall in the glucose value  (e.g., < ± 2 mg/dL/min) , the study nurse will move the 
subject until they are no longer laying on the sensor site. I f one of the two abdominal sensors  
experiences repeated compression artifact  values, the study nurse will have the option of placing a new 
CGM sensor  on an alternative abdominal site, or on  the posterior aspect of the contralateral upper arm 
from the abdominal sensor t hat continues to function  normally  (e.g., right side of abdomen and 
posterior aspect of left upper arm). The arm position may  decrease  the risk of both sensors suffering 
from compression artifacts , which could occur if the subject were to lay on  both of  their abdom inal 
sensors during sleep.  
A recent study involving the Dexcom G7 CGM revealed that positioning the CGM on the back of the 
upper arm  was as accurate and reliable as the abdominal position.88 This study, which involved 316 
participants and 77,774 paired (CGM vs YSI) glucose values, demonstrated an overall MARD of 8.2% for 
the arm and 9.1% for the abdomen. Amon g the 308 sensors worn on the arm, 291 (94.5%) had >80% of 
CGM -YSI matched pairs that met the %20/20 accuracy criterion. Among the 311 sensors worn on the 
abdomen, 272 (87.5%) had >80% of matched pairs that met the %20/[ADDRESS_715719] in human study performed on two subjects with type 2 diabetes in the CRC, the FUSION 
system infused an average of 26% of the subject’s total daily volume  needs during the 24 hour study 
period. The risks to the subjects from this amount of volume include generalized edema  in the setting of 
abnormal renal /liver  function, or exacerbation of underlying congestive heart failure in the setting of 
underlying cong estive heart failure. This risk will be mitigated by [CONTACT_547114] , liver , or cardiac conditions.  
This risk  will also be mitigated by [CONTACT_547115], based 
on an analysis  of the results from the first two subjects studied . These optimization effort s include steps 
to prevent excessive use of insulin during states of hyperglycemia (e.g., > 140 mg/dL), which can lead  to 
a rapid fall of elevated glucose values into and through the  desired glucose control range of 100 -140 
mg/dL. This rapid fall of glucose levels leads the FUSION system to either start a dextrose infusion if one 
is not currently infusing, or to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_547037]. The FUSION 
systems glucose control software will also be optimized to decrease the dextrose infusion more quickly  
in states where the glucose level is in the desired control range and is either stable or increasing. These 
effort s to avoid excessive use of dextrose shou ld decrease overall  fluid intake, as the dextrose infusion 
accounted for 88% of the total fluid given by [CONTACT_547090].  
Finally, the risk of fluid overload will be minimized through routine monitoring of the subjects for signs 
of fluid overload, throug hout the 24 -hour closed loop glucose control session. These signs will include 
evidence of peripheral edema (swollen hands, ankles , legs , eyelids ), increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
shortness of breath, or signs of pulmonary edema on exam such as rales.  Excessiv e volume loading, from 
the FUSION system, wi ll be defined as fluid delivered by [CONTACT_547090] (e.g. , insulin infusion and 
dextrose infusion )  in excess of [ADDRESS_715720] in human study  with no instances of software failure, and excellent overall glucose control 
capabilit ies as demonstrated by [CONTACT_547116]. Finally, the glucose control software 
has undergone an independent verification and validation process by [CONTACT_547117]  (JKI)  that 
specializes in working with the LabVIEW engineering software suite used to create the F USION  systems 
glucose control software. This verification and validation testing is repeated with each new version of 
the software, and prior to using the updated software in the clinical setting. The risks of software failure 
will be mitigated through independent monitoring of the subject’s  glucose values to prevent the serious 
risk of hypoglycemia.  Complete software failure during  the study would lead to termination of the study.  
 
The benefit of using closed loop glucose control software is demonstration of the feasibility of using this 
software to create a complete glucose  control system and  outweigh s the noted risks.  
 
4.3.8  FAILURE OF SYRINGE PUMPS TO ACCURATELY DELIVER DOSES OF INTRAVENOUS 
INSULIN AND DEXTROSE  
 
The risk of th e syringe pumps to not accurately deliver doses of insulin and dextrose has been mitigated 
through assessment of their accuracy prior to the study using a balance scale technique.89 This testing 
has demonstrated the accuracy of the syringe pumps to be within ± 5% from the prescribed infusion 
rate/ volume.  In addition, the infusion pump output rates are monitored by [CONTACT_547118] 10 seconds to ensure the pump outpu t rates match the prescribed rates from the software.  If 
these rate differences are greater than 20%, the study is temporarily stopped until the syringe pump is 
replaced .

available for consultation  throughout the entirety of the [ADDRESS_715723].  
 
The benefit of using the KDS Legato 100 syringe pumps is their highly a ccurate dosing and their 
compatibility  with the LabVIEW software used to develop the  FUSION  closed loop  glucose c ontrol 
system being tested in  this study.  It is expected that the KDS Legato 100  syringe pumps will not be part 
of the final FUSION system for which marketing approval will be sought.  
 
4.3.10  RISK OF DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)  
DKA is a metabolic condition brought on by [CONTACT_547119] a fuel source, which leads to excessive breakdown of fat, and abnormal labs 
consisting of elevated blood levels of glucose and beta  hydroxybutyrate, with a concomitant lowering of 
the blood pH. The risk of the participants entering the study while they are in DKA w ill be mitigated by 
[CONTACT_547120] 3. This screening will include  a

The risk of the subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_547039] y will be mitigated by [CONTACT_547121] 1 hour. If the subjects CGM or Reference Glucose Value is > 240 
mg/dL, the subjects will have their blood screened for ketones using the Nova Max Plus ketone meter. If 
the subject’s blood ketone level is > 1 mmol/L, they will have venous blood sent for a basic metabolic 
panel, pH, and beta hydroxybutyrate to determine if they are in DKA. Subjects who are found to be in 
DKA, during their stay in the CRC during visit 3, will b e removed from the study.

levels are difficult to control , outweighs the risk of the subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_107977] , given the information 
on the FUSION systems p erformance that will be gathered during the course of this study.  
4.3.11  RISK OF SEVERE HYPERGLYCEMIA  
Severe hyperglycemia is defined as a  Reference Glucose Value greater than 240 mg/dL . In subjects with 
type [ADDRESS_715725] is at risk of

i. Safety  
 
To assess the hypothesis that an AI

2. Efficacy  
 
To assess the hypothesis that an AI 
based glucose controller will 
provide effective glucose control in 
participants with  type 2 diabetes  
consuming three meals over the 
course of the 24 -hour closed loop 
glucose control session.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
The percent of all glucose values that 
are in the hypoglycemic range, when 
the latter is defined as glucose 
values less than 70 mg/dL . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The percent of all glucose values that 
are within the range of 70 -180 
mg/dL.  
 
 
  
 
 
Avoidance of 
hypoglycemia during 
tight glucose control 
leads to decreased 
mortality rates, and thus 
measurements of the 
rate of occurrence of 
hypoglycemia can be  
considered an 
assessment of the  
overall safety of the 
glucose control system 
under study.  
 
 
 
 
 
ICU mortality rates 
increase when patients 
experience both 
hypoglycemia (< 70 
mg/dL) and 
hyperglycemia (> 180 
mg/dL). Thus , testing 
the ability of the AI 
based glucose control 
system to maintain the 
study subjects in the 
range of 70 -180 mg/dL 
will give an indication of 
its ability to avoid these 
two deleterious 
glycemic states.

the recommendation of adul t endocrinologists (Drs. Pasquel or Davis) who are the principal 
investigators for this study. The dose of  short acting insulin  ordered after admission to the CRC 
will be  based on the amount of carbohydrates ingested  by [CONTACT_547132] , their  Reference Glucose V alue measured just prior to breakfast , and their usual 
home routine.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  VISIT 3, TIME 0 TO 5 HOURS ( PREPARATION FOR CLOSED LOOP GLUCOSE CONTROL 
STUDY ) 
 
1. General  
All subjects will be admitted  between the hours of [ADDRESS_715746]  2022 
 
  54 minimum should include a cardiac monitor, pulse oximeter, intermittent blood pressure capab ilities, and 
a resuscitation cart.  
2. Screening Prior to Initiation of the Closed Loop Glucose Control Session  
The subjects will be tested for the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis  and appropriate Reference Glucose 
Values  prior to proceeding to steps 3 -6 below. This testing will include:  
i. Reference Glucose Value  at time of admission to the CRC  – If the Reference Glucose 
Value  is greater than  300 mg/dL, the subject will be screened for blood ketones  using 
the Nova Max Plus  (Nova Biomedical ) ketone meter . If the Reference Glucose Value  is 
less than  70 mg/dL or the subjects are experiencing any symptoms of hypoglycemia, 
regardless of their Reference Glucose Value , the subjects will be offered a snack or 
glucose containing  juice. To be clear, the Nova Max Plus ketone meter will be used for 
any blood ketone analysis performed during the time the subjects are in the CRC.  
ii. Blood ketones – The study will be cancelled if the blood ketones are > 1 mmol/L.  If 
blood ketones are > 1 mmol /L, a venous blood sample will be sent to the central lab at 
Emory University for a basic metabolic panel , venous pH  and beta -hydroxybutyrate  to 
rule out  diabetic  ketoacidosis. If diabetic ketoacidosis is confirmed, the subject  will be 
stabilized per the usual routine care at Emory Healthcare.  
iii. Blood glucose prior to insertion of Dexcom G6 CGM’s and intravenous lines  – The 
subjects Reference Glucose Value  must be in  the range of 70 -300 mg/dL prior to 
insertion of the two Dexcom G6 CGM’s and two intravenous lines.  
 
In addition, the closed loop glucose control session of the study will not be initiated if the participant has 
symptoms requiring action (e.g., abdominal p ain, vomiting, unable to eat or drink, fever ≥ 101.5), 
regardless of bloo d glucose  or ketone levels.  
 
3. Dexcom G6 CGM  devices  
The subjects will have two Dexcom G6 CGM  device s placed in the abdominal position, approximately 5 
cm to the left or right of the umbilicus  (Figure 25) .

Figure 25 – Green shaded areas denote appropriate areas of the abdominal wall to place  the Dexcom G6 CGM’s. 
This figure is  from the Dexcom G6 CGM us er manual.  
 
The CGM devices should be placed shortly after arrival to the CRC facility.  For the Dexcom G6 CGM labeled 
“#1”, enter the glucose sensors four -digit code and the transmitters six -digit serial number into the 
Dexcom G6 Receiver labeled “#1”  and into the Dexcom G6 Follow App on the mobile phone labeled “#1”.  
For the Dexcom G6 CGM l abeled “#2”, enter the glucose sensors four -digit code and the transmitters six -
digit serial number into the Dexcom G6 Receiver labeled “#2”  and into the Dexcom G6 Follow App on the 
mobile phone labeled “#2” . Position the mobile phones [ADDRESS_715748]  an IV placed in the contralateral  
hand in a retrograde position . The hand with the retrograde IV will be warmed to 50-55 degrees Celsius 
with a commercial warming box  or warming pad  for purposes of arterializing the venous blood.90 
5. Reference Glucose Value  
After both Dexcom CGM’s have started to return glucose values to the Dexcom Receivers, and p rior to 
starting the closed loop glucose control portion of study , a Reference Gl ucose Value (s) (taken from 
arterialized retrograde hand IV line) will be measured using  the Nova StatStrip Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547048] . If the retrograde hand vein is no longer available  at any point during visit 3 , Reference Glucose 
Valu es may be obtained from a finger stick (capi[INVESTIGATOR_17276]), with analysis of this sample being 
performed on the Nova StatStrip Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547035] . 
 
On July 12, 2018, the FDA cleared the Nova StatStrip Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547049], specifically including those receiving 
intensive medical intervention therapy.  According to the FDA’s 510(k) Substantial Equivalence

6. Calibration of Dexcom G6 CGM’s  
The Dexcom G6 CGM ’s will be calibrated under the following scenarios:  
 
1. The Dexcom G6 CGM value (s) do not meet CGM Validation Criteria  
If one or both of  the Dexcom G6 CGM ’s are more than 20  mg/dL  different from the Reference 
Glucose Value for CGM values less than 100 mg/dL, or are more than 20% different from the 
Reference Glucose Value for CGM values greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL at any time during 
visit 3, they will be recalibrated against the result  from the Reference Glucose Value  (using the 
Dexcom G6 receiver (s)). This calibration must occur within 5 minutes of obtaining the Reference 
Glucose Value sample. If the Dexcom G6 Receivers are recalibrated, the matching mobile 
phone’s Dexcom App  must also be recalibrated at the same time (e.g., if Dexcom Receiver #1 is 
recalibrated, also recalibrate the Dexcom G6 Follow App in mobile phone #1).  If a Dexcom G6 
sensor is recalibrated, a follow up CGM one hour after the re calibration must be within 20 
mg/dL of the Reference Glucose Value  for CGM values less than 100 mg/dL, or within ± 20% of 
the Reference Glucose Value  for CGM values greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL. If a CGM is felt 
to be inaccurate – cannot be calibrate d to meet the aforementioned CGM Validation Criteria  – it 
may be replaced  according to the CGM Replacement Criteria.  
2. The Dexcom G6 CGM’s are greater than 20% different than their averaged value.  If the averaged 
glucose value of the two Dexcom G6 CGM’s is greater than 20% different than the CGM values, a 
Reference Glucose Value will be obtained and both CGM’s will be re -calibrated against the result 
of the Reference Glucose Value using the Dexcom G6 receivers. This recalibration must occur 
within 5 minutes of obtaining the Reference Glucose Value sample. In this scenario, t he FUSION 
system will automatically alert the clinical study staff of the need to recalibrate both Dexcom G6 
CGM’s. If the Dexc om G6 Receivers are recalibrated, the matching mobile phone’s Dexcom 
Follow Apps must also be recalibrated at the same time . If a Dexcom G6 CGM  is recalibrated, the 
CGM value one hour after recalibration must be within 20 mg/dL of the Reference Glucose 
Value for CGM values less than 100 mg/dL, or within ± 20% of the Reference Glucose Value for 
CGM values greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL.

THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IN TYPE [ADDRESS_715750]  2022 
 
  57  
Prior to starting the closed loop glucose control session , a Reference Glucose Value will be obtained 
immediately after the time when the CGM sensors begin to return glucose readings . Reference Glucose 
Values  will be subsequently checked every 30 minutes until the CGM sensor values meet the  following  
CGM Validation Criteria : 
 
1. CGM’s must be within 20 mg/dL of the Reference Glucose Value for CGM values less than 100 
mg/dL, or within ± 20% of the Reference Glucose Value for CGM values greater than or equal to 
100 mg/dL.  
 
Closed -loop therapy will begin after two consecutive averages of CGM values meet the above  CGM 
Validation Criteria . The above  CGM  Validation Criteria  will be used throughout the entirety of visit 3.  
 
Blood for  independent glucose  analysis will be drawn from the retrograde venous line in the warmed 
hand . The drawn blood will be immediately analy zed for glucose using the Nova StatStrip Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547052] . These blood glucose values will be known as the Reference Glucose Value s. If 
the arterialized venous line stops working, it may be replaced. If an arterialized  venous line is no longer 
available, fingerstick capi[INVESTIGATOR_547053] s. Fingerstick capi[INVESTIGATOR_547054] . 
 
All Reference Glucose Values will be manually recorded on the studies case report form, however, they 
will not be used by [CONTACT_547133] (except to calibrate the Dexcom 
G6 CGM’s , as necessary) . 
 
All subjects will be allowed to drink water throughout the course of the study. No glucose containing 
drinks will be allowed during the closed loop portion of the study , unless the subjects glucose level 
(CGM or Reference  Glucose Value ) is < 70  mg/dL, or the subject is experiencing symptoms of 
neuroglycopenia . Subjects will remain confined to either the bed or a bedside chair throughout the 
course of the study. Subjects will use a bedside commode for bathroom breaks in order to prevent any 
inter ruption to their closed loop glucose control  session . 
 
The following supplies will be needed to complete the study: 1) four [ADDRESS_715751] stopcocks, 2)  two IV tubing 
(non -microbore) of 6-[ADDRESS_715752], 3) Forty 50 mL BD syringes filled with  D10NS (study site research pharmacy to fill these [ADDRESS_715753] sterile technique), 4) Six 50 mL BD syringes  filled with  NovoLog  insulin 
mixed in normal saline to a concentration of 1 unit/mL (study site research pharmacy to fill these [ADDRESS_715754] sterile technique). The  FUSION system ( Figure 20 ) will  be supplied by [CONTACT_91332].

[IP_ADDRESS]  VISIT 3, TIME 5 TO 2 9 HOURS (CLOSED LOOP GLUCOSE CONTROL SESSION)  
 
The closed loop glucose control session will  not begin until the following criteria has been met:  
1. Both Dexcom G6 CG M’s are returning glucose values and  have been calibrated – if necessary ; or

Please refer to the below standard operating procedure (SOP)  document for  the calibration procedure 
for the Dexcom G6 CGM’s,  setting up the FUSION system , and initiati ng it’s software:  
 
FUSION System SOP  
 
To better simulate how the FUSION system will be used in the ICU setting, no run-in period will be 
performed prior to the subject consuming the first meal. During the 24-hour closed loop glucose control 
study  (time 5 to 29 hours ), blood glucose control will be performed autonomously by [CONTACT_547134] F USION  glucose control system.  For safety reasons, the subjects will have a Reference 
Glucose Value independently measured every 10-60 minutes on the Nova StatStrip Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547055] . These independent Reference Glucose Value s will not be used by [CONTACT_547135].  After 2-3 hours of confirmed CGM accuracy  (e.g., from 0900 to 1 200), the closed loop 
glucose control session will  begin. The first meal consumed during the closed loop glucose control 
session will be lunch.  
 
Lunch will consist of 60 grams of carbohydrate (45 -60% of total meal Kcal’s) and be consumed beginning 
at   ̴1200 hours ( the beginning of the closed loop glucos e control session). Dinner will consist of 75 grams 
of carbohydrates (45 -60% of total meal Kcal’s) and be consumed beginning at 1800 hours ( 6 hours after 
beginning of closed loop glucose control session) . Breakfast will consist of 50 grams of carbohydrate (45-
60% of total meal Kcal’s) and be consumed  beginning  at 0800 hours on day 2 of  the closed loop session 
began (20 hours after  the beginning of the closed loop glucose control session).  
 
Subjects will be allowed to have snacks between the hours of 2100  on day 1 and 0 600 hours on day 2  of 
their CRC study , or at any time for CGM or Reference Glucose Values less than 70 mg/dL or for 
symptoms of neuroglycopenia . Subjects will preselect their breakfast, lunch,  and dinner meal choices 
from the CRC menu prior to the study. These  meals will be unannounced to the F USION  system. Once 
the closed loop glucose control period has ended a fter [ADDRESS_715756]  2022 
 
  59 If the subjects are removed from the study due to the occurrence of a severe hypogl ycemic event (< 54 
mg/dL), the subjects will have their glucose values measured with a Reference Glucose Analyzer  (e.g., 
Nova S tatStrip Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547035] ) every 10 minutes, until their Reference Glucose Values  
are greater than  70 mg/dL. They will then have additional Reference Glucose Values  drawn every [ADDRESS_715757] consistent Reference Glucose Values  in the range of 80 -250 mg/dL  for a period 
of at least two hours.  See Recovery Period  (Page s 107-108) for details with regards to subcutaneous 
insulin doses to be received prior to discharge from the Clinical Research Center.  
 
The insulin and dextrose 50 mL medication syringes may not be used for more than 24 hours. Although 
the study should be terminated  after a period of 24 hours (e.g., may not go longer than 24 hours), if for 
any reason the study period is longer than 24 hours (e.g., on orders from the principal investigator), the 
insulin and dextrose medication syringes must be exchanged for new medica tion syringes. To be clear, 
the insulin and dextrose medication syringes may not be used for a period of time exceeding 24 hours.

10.2 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS  
 
10.2.1  SAFETY  
 
The exclusion criteria  which are used to screen for potential subjects  eliminates  those  with hepatic 
failure, signs of significant he patic disease as defined by [CONTACT_1629] a lanine aminotransferase greater than three 
times the upper limit of normal, any signs of  renal failure, subjects with any history of  congestive heart 
failure, subjects with a history of ischemic heart disease/cerebrovascular accident/ seizures and  
eliminates all females who are pregnant. The purpose of these exclusion criteria is to avoid first in 
human  trials on subjects with severe organ compromise, and exposure of a fetus to an untested medical 
device . 
 
Independently m onitoring Reference Glucose  Values every  10-[ADDRESS_715777] safety 
should they experience hypoglycemia that the closed loop glucose control system is either unaware of 
or is unable to effectively treat. This monitoring will allow for early intervention in case the sub jects 
experience severe hypoglycemia ( Reference Glucose Value < 54 mg/dL) or moderate hypoglycemia 
(Reference Glucose Value 54-69 mg/dL) with clinical signs of hypoglycemia.  
   
10.2.2  PHYSICAL EXAM/LABS  
 
The visit [ADDRESS_715778]’s  weight. No vital signs will be recorded.  
During the closed loop glucose control portion of the study the subject ’s vital signs will be monitored 
with a frequency of at least every 1 hour . 
 
No EKG’s will be needed for pu rposes of completing this study. No radiologic studies will be needed for 
purposes of completing this study.  
DEMONSTRATION OF AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED CLOSED LOOP GLUCOSE CONTROL SYSTEM AS A 
THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IN TYPE [ADDRESS_715779]’s  routine visit to the adult endocrinology clinic  will be used whenever possible. In addition to 
medical history and physical exam information, this may also include use of necessary lab work to 
include creatinine, alanine aminotransferase,  hemoglobin,  HbA1c, C-peptide, and urine pregnancy test.   
 
10.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
10.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  (AE)  
 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurren ce associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related.  
 
 
10.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  (SAE)  
 
 
An adverse event ( AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious ” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse 
event, a persistent or significant incapacity , or substantial disru ption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions. Important medical events that may not result in death  or be life -threatening may be 
considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
DEMONSTRATION OF AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED CLOSED LOOP GLUCOSE CONTROL SYSTEM AS A 
THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IN TYPE [ADDRESS_715780]  2022 
 
  68 participant  and may require  medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition.  
 
 
10.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 
For adverse events ( Aes) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines 
will be used to describe severi ty:  
 
• Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant ’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe  – Events interrupt a participant ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.   Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  For 
purposes of this study, the fol lowing will be considered severe  adverse events:  
 
1. Death  
2. A life threatening experience  
3. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
4. Seizure secondary to hypoglycemia  
5. Myocardial infarction that is temporally related to a hypoglycemic (<  70 mg/d L) event  
6. Cardiac dysrhythmia that  that is temporally related to a hypoglycemic (<  70 mg/d L) event  
7. Reference Glucose Value  < 54 mg/d L 
8. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: meeting all criteria: symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or 
vomiting, serum ketones > 1.5 mmol/L, either arterial blood pH < 7.30 or venous pH < 7.24 , or 
serum bicarbonate < [ADDRESS_715781] alert Ideal Medical Technologies Inc . or its designee of any severe  adverse 
event (SAE) within 48 hours of investigator awareness of the event via an agreed upon method. Alerts 
issued via telephone are to be immediately followed with official notification on study -specific SAE 
forms. See attachment IMT2022 -1-A1 for serious adverse event form.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
All adverse events ( Aes) must have their relationship to study intervention  assessed  by [CONTACT_237357]/her clinical judgment. 
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categor ies below. In a clinical trial  of a 
medical device , the medical device under study  must always be suspect.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention  caused the AE, or the re is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention  and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention  and the AE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that  the administration of the study 
intervention  caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention  
and event onset , or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
 
The principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_21190] ( AE) is expected 
or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is 
not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention . 
 
10.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 
The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or severe  adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits  or upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All A es including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report CRF. Information to be co llected includes event description, time of onset, 
clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to medical device under study  (assessed only by [CONTACT_547146] A 
THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IN TYPE [ADDRESS_715782]  2022 
 
  70 with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the even t. 
All A es occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All A es 
will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant  is screened will be considered as 
base line and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition  deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event  
at each level of severity  to be performed. A es characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_547060] 1 (for non -serious A es) or 3 days (for SAEs) after the last 
day of study participation.  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of 
AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed  for outcome information until resolution or 
stabilization.  
 
Unsolicited adverse events are not applicable to this study.  
 
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_715783] ( IRB) as soon as possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_715784] and shall report the results of such evaluation to

11.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
11.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
 
The data will be presented as median and interquartile range (25 -75), except for the Clarke error grid 
analysis which will be presented as percent of values in zones A , B, C, D and E .  
 
11.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICA CY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
1. To determine percent time in range < 70 mg/d L for each subject , the calculation is as follows:  
 
(# of glucose values in range < 70 mg/d L/total number of all glucose values) * 100  
 
This result will be presented as median and interquartile range (25 -75). 
 
2. To determine percent time in range 70 -180 mg/dL  for each subject , the calculation is as follows:  
 
(# of glucose values in range 70 -180 mg/dL /total number of all glucose values) * 100  
 
This result will be presented as median and interquartile range (25 -75). 
 
 
 
11.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
For the secondary endpoints that measure  percent time in range , the  values will be calculated as noted 
above in 9.4.2.  These results will be presented as median and interquartile range (25 -75).  
 
The number of hypoglycemic events less than 70 mg/d L will be presented as median and interquartile 
range (25 -75).  
 
The mean glucose level will be presented as mean ± SD . 
 
The coefficient of variation will be presented as median and interquartile range (25 -75).

The Clarke error grid analysis will be presented as a graph of the Clarke error grid. The Reference 
Glucose Value (Nova StatStrip Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547035])  and Dexcom G6 data will be analyzed to 
determine the percent of all valu es that are in zones A, B, C,  D and E . 
 
 
11.4.4  SAFETY ANALYSES  
 
For the safety primary endpoint of percent time in ran ge < 70 mg/d L, the calculation is as follows:  
 
(# of glucose values in range < 70 mg/d L/total number of all glucose values) * 100  
 
This result will be presented as median and interquartile range (25 -75).  
 
Each AE or  SAE will be independently reported as percent of patients experiencing the event . SAE’s that 
require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_547063] a table. If the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_547064]’s are secondary to the intervention this will be reported in the final 
study summary. Any rescue medicine that is u sed per 8.5.1 will be separately reported as percent of 
subjects requiring rescue medicine.  
 
11.4.5  BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  
 
The following baseline characteristics will be recorded at the start of the study , 1) age, 2) sex, 3)

Diabetic Subjects  
(IMT2022 -1-P2) 
MEAL CHALLENGE  PROTOCOL  
Type [ADDRESS_715838].  
Methods Overview:  
After admission to the CRC  and confirming the subjects are eligible to continue with the closed loop 
glucose control session on visit 3 (see page s 53-54), catheters will be placed in one antecubital vein for 
purpose of insulin and or D10NS infusion, and in a con tralateral arm vein in a retrograde fashion for 
purposes of blood draws.  
Precaution to Avoid Electrostatic Discharge from Affecting FUSION System  
Touching the FUSION system when your body has a build -up of static electricity may cause an 
electrostatic disc harge (e.g., flow of electricity) into the FUSION system. It is unknown if this would 
adversely affect the performance of the FUSION system. In order to mitigate against the risk of study 
personnel introducing an electrostatic discharge into the FUSION sys tem, the following precaution must 
always be taken prior to touching the FUSION system:  
1. Touch a metal table that is positioned near the FUSION system but is not in contact [CONTACT_547165] . This procedure must be performed prior to each 
interaction (e.g., touching) with the FUSION system.  
Meal Challenge  Protocol:  
The meal challenge protocol is outlined in detail below.  
Potential Problems.  
Severe hypoglycemia  (< 54 mg/dL) may be associated with adrenergic response symptom s (tachycardia, 
sweating, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]) and neuroglycopenia  symptoms  (impaired cognition, coma, seizures).  Based 
upon previous studies , patients can sustain hypoglycemia for approximately [ADDRESS_715839]  2022 
 
  98 To avoid risk to our human subjects, vital signs  will be monitored closely. Frequent independent glucose 
measurement s will be performed (every 10-60 minutes) to minimize the risk of severe hypoglycemia (< 
54 mg/dL) or moderate hypoglycemia ( 54-69 mg/dL) with the above noted hypoglycemia symptoms. The 
protocol calls for rescue doses of  15 mL of  50% dextrose  for severe hypoglycemia , moderate 
hypoglycemia with hypoglycemia symptoms , or neuroglycopenia . In addition, the study on any one 
subject will be terminated if they experience a severe hypoglycemia even t (< 54 mg/dL) . The overall 
study will be terminated if two subjects experience a severe hypoglycemia event  (< 54 mg/dL) .  
 
Patients with a history of liver failure, renal failure, cerebrovascular accident, seizure disorder,  
congestive heart failure,  and ischemic heart disease will not be recruited for this study.  
During the time period when the FUSION  system is operational and active, if a participant’s CGM or 
Reference Glucose Value  is >240 mg/dL for over 1 h our or ≥  300 mg/dL at any point  after starting the 
FUSION system , the following steps will be taken: Ketones will be assessed at the discretion of the 
principal investigator(s)  for any concern about possible ketosis or DKA by  [CONTACT_62262] a blood ketone level 
at the bedside. If the blood ketone level is greater than 1 mmol/L, a venous blood sample from the 
subject will be sent to the central laboratory of Emory Healthcare for a basic metabolic panel, blood pH, 
and beta hydroxybutyrate level.  If the subject is f ound to be in DKA,  the subject will be stabilized per the 
usual routine care at Emory Healthcare.  
When a hyperglycemia/ketotic event meets the above reporting requirements , an Adverse Event Form 
will be completed. Events meeting DKA criteria should be considered serious adverse events with 
respect to reporting requirements. Hyperglycemia events not meeting criteria for DKA generally will not 
be considered as serious adverse events unless one of the severe adverse event  criteria  is met.

consumed at breakfast, lunch and dinner will be 50, 60 and 75 grams.  
 
1.  Admit to Study Site on (specify date)  _____________________ _ between  06:00-07:00AM.  
 
2.  Informed Consent       ___   Signed and in the Medical Chart.  
                                       ___   Must be signed upon Admission prior to any procedure.  
 
3.  Ad Lib  water  prior to Closed Loop Glucose Control  
 
Instruct subject to void . Subject may have ad lib water throughout their entire stay in the CRC.  
4.  Voiding during the CRC visit (time 0-32 hours)  
The subject may use the bathroom for voiding prior to the onset of the closed loop glucose control 
session (time 0 -5 hours), and after conclusion of the closed loop glucose control session (time 29 -
32 hours). If subject needs to void during the  closed loop glucose control session (time 5 -29 hours) , 
a bedpan/urinal must be provided , in order to make sure the subjects blood glucose level remains 
under the control of the FUSION system.  
5.  Diet  before study onset (time -7 to 1 hours) :

7.  Screening prior to initiation of the  closed loop glucose control session (time 0 -1 hours)  
The subjects will be tested for the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis and appropriate Reference 
Glucose Values prior to proceeding with the closed loop glucose control session. This testing will 
include:  
i. Reference Glucose Value  at time of admission to the CRC  – If the Reference 
Glucose Value is greater than 300 mg/dL, the subject will be screened for blood 
ketones using the Nova Max Plus (Nova Biomedical) ketone meter. If the 
Reference Glucose Value is less than 70 mg/dL or the subjects are experiencing 
any symptoms of hypoglycemia, regardless of their blood Refe rence Glucose 
Value,  the subjects will be offered a snack or glucose containing juice. To be clear, 
the Nova Max Plus ketone meter will be used for any blood ketone analysis 
performed during the time the subjects are in the CRC.  
ii. Blood ketones – The study will be cancelled if the blood ketones are > 1 mmol/L. 
If blood ketones are > 1 mmol/L, a venous blood sample will be sent to the central 
lab at Emory University for a basic metabolic panel , venous pH  and beta -
hydroxybutyrate  to rule out  diabetic  ketoacidosis. If diabetic ketoacidosis is 
confirmed, the participant will be stabilized per the usual routine care at Emory 
Healthcare.  
iii. Blood glucose prior to insertion of Dexcom G6 CGM’s and intravenous lines  – The 
subjects Reference  Glucose Value must be in the range of 70 -300 mg/dL prior to 
insertion of the two Dexcom G6 CGM’s and two intravenous lines.  
In addition, the closed loop glucose control session will not be initiated if the participant has 
symptoms requiring action (e.g., abdominal pain, vomiting, unable to eat or drink, fever ≥ 101.5), 
regardless of bloo d glucose  or ketone levels.  
8.  Diet before onset of closed loop glucose control session (time 0 -5 hours):  
Subject to be offered breakfast with 50 grams of carbohydrate at ti me 1 hours (  ̴ 0800 hours on day 
1), after admission to the CRC unit.   After consuming breakfast, the subject is to remain NPO until 
lunch offered at the time of initiation of the closed loop glucose control session at time 5 hours (  ̴ 
1200 on day 1) . After admission to the CRC, if the subject has a Reference Glucose Value less than  
70 mg/dL or is experiencing signs of neuroglycopenia (hypoglycemia of sufficient duration and 
degree to interfere with normal brain metabolism and function) at any Refere nce Glucose Value , 
they will be offered snacks and/ or glucose containing juice.  
9.  Insulin Dosing Prior to Study Onset (time 0 -5 hours):  
The study’s  principal  investigators  ([CONTACT_547179]  or [CONTACT_123914])  will determine  the short  acting  insulin  
dose  required  to cover  the breakfast  that is consumed  at approximately  [ADDRESS_715843] ’s medical  history,  pre-prandial  Reference  Glucose  Value  that is measured  by [CONTACT_547166][INVESTIGATOR_547076]  a fingerstick  capi[INVESTIGATOR_547077] , and carbohydrate  
load  in the meal.  All insulin  doses  given  during  the CRC stay (visit  3)  will be administered  by a 
DEMONSTRATION OF AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED CLOSED LOOP GLUCOSE CONTROL SYSTEM AS A 
THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IN TYPE [ADDRESS_715844].  The Emory  Clinical  
Research  Center  will provide  all insulin  that is administered  to the subjects  throughout  visit 3 (e.g.,

I. Both Dexcom G6 CGM’s are greater than  70 mg/dL.  
II. The subjects have two consecutive Reference Glucose Values greater than  70 
mg/dL. These Reference Glucose Values will be measured by [CONTACT_547170][INVESTIGATOR_547081] a venous or capi[INVESTIGATOR_130935].  
B. Every 30 minutes:  
Monitor the subject’s Reference Glucose Values  every 30 minutes when the following 
occur:  
I. After both Dexcom G6 CGM’s begin to return glucose readings after their original 
insertion and prior to the onset of the closed loop glucose control session, for 
purposes of verifying the accuracy of the CGM’s. This monitoring prior to the onset 
of the clo sed loop glucose control session may be discontinued once both CGM’s 
have  met the following CGM Validation Criteria  on two consecutive Reference 
Glucose Values:  
 
CGM  readings must be within  ± 20 mg/dL of the Reference Glucose Value for CGM 
readings < 100 m g/dL or CGM readings  must be within ± 20% of Reference Glucose 
Values for CGM readings >= 100 mg/dL  on two consecutive Reference Glucose 
Values.

i. During the last 22 hours of the closed loop glucose control session (time 7 -29 
hours), if the following occur:  
a) Both CGM’s are in the range of 85-240 mg/dL  and the subject is not 
experiencing any signs of neuroglycopenia.  
 
Result: _____ mg/dL , Time: _________ (24 hour clock)  
Note: Notify study team if the CGM or Reference Glucose Value  is < 70 mg/dl or > 300 mg/dl.  
 
16.  Dexcom G6 CGM Placement, Calibration and Replacement  
 
 Visit  3 (Time 0 to 5 hours) : 
Place two Dexcom G6 CGM ’s in the abdomen 5 cm to the right and left of the umbilicus (Figure 28).  
 
 
 
Figure 2 8 – Green shaded areas denote appropriate areas of the abdominal wall to place the Dexcom G6 
CGM’s. This figure is  from the Dexcom G6 CGM user manual.  

DEMONSTRATION OF AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED CLOSED LOOP GLUCOSE CONTROL SYSTEM AS A 
THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IN TYPE [ADDRESS_715855]  2022 
 
  105 Make sure the Dexcom G6 Transmitters are labeled “#1” and “#2”. These labels should be in a 
clearly visible position after  the Transmitters have been attached to the Dexcom G6 glucose 
sensors. Once both Dexcom CGM’s begin to return glucose values, obtain a Reference Glucose 
Value using the Nova StatStrip Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547048]. If either of the Dexcom CGM’s do not meet  CGM 
Validation Criteria , they may be calibrated. The Dexcom G6 
CGM’s must meet t he following CGM Validation Criteria 
throughout the CRC study session (visit 3) , otherwise they 
will be calibrated as often as is necessary : 
 
1. CGM  readings must be within  ± 20 mg/dL of the 
Reference Glucose Value for CGM readings < 100 
mg/dL or CGM readings  must be  within ± 20% of 
Reference Glucose Values for CGM readings >= 100 
mg/dL  on two consecutive Reference Glucose 
Values.  
 
Calibrations should only be attempted when the glucose rate 
of change is less than  ± 2 mg/dL/min on the Dexcom G6 CGM 
(see figure 29).  
 
If after two calibration attempts prior to beginning the closed 
loop glucos e control session (time 0 -5 hours) the CGM(s) still do not meet CGM Validation Criteria , 
they may be replaced. The closed loop glucose control session may not begin until there are two 
working Dexcom G6 CGM’s in place, and both CGM’s have met the above noted CGM Validation  
Criteria . 
 
Closed Loop Glucose Control Session (Time 5 to 29 hours) : 
Inspect the CGM  sites (see Monitoring Activities)  and ensure proper performance and 
communication to the two Dexcom G6 Receivers that are labeled “#1” and “#2”, and that are part 
of the FUSION system ( Figure 20 ); ensure communication with the Dexcom G6 Follow APP on the 
two mobile phones labeled “#1” and “#2”. The CGM’s may be replaced during the closed l oop 
glucose control session for any of the following reasons:  
1. The CGM(s) do not meet the above noted CGM Validation Criteria  and are unable to be 
calibrated after two attempts over a two -hour period of time.  
2. If the CGM measurement is > 180 mg/dL and the si multaneous (e.g., within 5 minutes) 
Reference Glucose Value is < 100 mg/dL, the CGM may be replaced as this scenario may 
lead to inadvertent insulin administration by [CONTACT_547090], which may result in 
hypoglycemia (< 70 mg/dL).  
3. If the CGM measurement is < 100 mg/dL and the simultaneous (e.g., within 5 minutes) 
Reference Glucose Value is > 180 mg/dL, the CGM may be replaced as this scenario may 
lead to a delay in the treatment of hyperglycemia, which will increase the risk for DKA in 
type I diabetic sub jects.  
Figure 29 – Glucose rate of change ,

THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IN TYPE [ADDRESS_715856]  2022 
 
  106 4. The CGM(s) experience repeated compression artifact that is unable to be relieved through 
repositioning of the subject. Compression artifact is a sudden non -physiologic fall in one of 
the CGM glucose levels (e.g., < ± 2 mg/dL/min), when the second C GM does not experience 
this same degree of fall in its glucose level. The FUSION system monitors for compression 
artifact and will display an alarm alerting the clinical study nurse of its occurrence, and the 
need to reposition the subject so that they are  not directly laying on the transmitter/sensor 
pair.  
5. The subject is experiencing significant bleeding, pain, or signs of infection at the CGM 
insertion site.  
6. The CGM transmitter/sensor pair stops working for any reason.  
 
If the Dexcom G6 CGM’s need to be replaced during visit 3, the preferred replacement site is 
another abdominal position (see Figure 28). If another abdominal site is used, place the new CGM 
at least [ADDRESS_715857] from the other abdominal CGM that is still wor king properly. As an alternative, 
and only if another abdominal site is not available or may result in further compression artifacts, a 
replacement CGM may be placed in the posterior upper arm position, on the contralateral side 
from the remaining CGM (e.g ., if remaining CGM is on the right side of the abdomen, place the 
replacement CGM on the posterior aspect of the left upper arm). In the event a replacement CGM 
is used, it must be calibrated until it meets the above noted CGM Validation Criteria . The position 
of the CGM’s and all calibration attempts will be noted on the Case Report Form.  
 
17.  Frequency of CGM Calibration  
The CGM’s may be recalibrated as often as necessary during the closed loop glucose control session 
(time 5 -29 hours) if they do n ot meet the following CGM Validation Criteria : 
 
1. CGM’s glucose readings must be within  ± 20 mg/dL of Reference Glucose Values for CGM 
readings less than  100 mg/dL or must be  within ± 20% of Reference Glucose Values for CGM 
readings greater than  100 mg/dL.  
 
 
Only CGM’s not meeting the above noted CGM Validation Criteria  will be calibrated, thus either 
one or both CGM’s may be calibrated at any point in time, depending on the circumstances.  
 
In addition, the FUSION system monitors the CGM’s for si gns of significant deviation (e.g., > 20%) 
from the average glucose value used by [CONTACT_547171]. If the FUSION 
system detects CGM deviation of > 20% from the average glucose value used by [CONTACT_547090]  
(e.g., CGM #1 = 70 mg/dL, CGM #2 = 130 mg/dL, and average glucose value used by [CONTACT_547172] = 100 mg/dL)  it will display an alarm alerting the clinical study nurse of this occurrence, and 
request that both CGM’s be recalibrated against a Reference Glucose Value.  
 
To be clear,  if the CGM’s meet the above noted CGM Validation Criteria  throughout their time of 
use in visit 3, and the FUSION system does not automatically call for a CGM calibration, it is possible 
to complete visit [ADDRESS_715858] Blood Collection Protocol  per CRC guidelines  
 
RN: Draw blood glucose sample  from retrograde intravenous line: Draw 0.5 mL of whole  blood to 
measure glucose levels using the Nova StatStrip Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547080] 10-60 
minutes  (time 4 t o 32 hours).  
 
19.  Meal Challenge Protocol  
Time 5 hours (  ̴1200 on day 1): Subject to consume lunch with 60 grams of carbohydrate.  
Time 11 hours (  ̴ 1800 on day 1): Subject to consume dinner with 75 grams of carbohydrate.  
Time 25 hours (  ̴0800 on day 2): Subject to consume breakfast with 50 grams of carbohydrate.  
 
Carbohydrates should make up 45 -60% of the total Kcal’s of each meal.  
 
Time 5 to 29 hours: Closed loop control of blood glucose with FUSION system ( Figure 20 ), to control 
range of 100 -140 mg/dL.  
 
Throughout the entirety of the subjects stay in the CRC (e.g., time 0 to 32 hours), if the subject has 
a Reference Glucose Value le ss than  70 mg/dL or is experiencing signs of neuroglycopenia 
(hypoglycemia of sufficient duration and degree to interfere with normal brain metabolism and 
function) at any Reference Glucose Value , they will be offered snacks and/or glucose containing 
juice . 
 
 
 
20.  RECOVERY PERIOD (Time 29 to 32 hours ) 
1. Type 1 Diabetic Subjects:  
Type  [ADDRESS_715859]  four  consecutive  Reference  Glucose  Values  
within  the range  of 80-250 mg/dL,  with  the most  recent  rate of change  being  less than  ± 2 
mg/dL/min,  which  is equal  to either  a single  sideways  arrow  or a single  up or down  arrow  as 
noted  in the illustration  above  (Figure  29), which  was taken  from  Dexcom  G6 CGM  manual . 
The glucose  sample  source  can be either  from  a venous  catheter  sample,  or from  a capi[INVESTIGATOR_547082].  The Nova  StatStrip  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547083].  
 
Following  standard  practice,  subjects  with  type  1 diabetes  will receive  a dose  of basal  insulin  dose  
two hours  before  discontinuation  of the FUSION  systems  continuous  insulin  infusion  (CII),  as it is 
expected  that basal  insulin  levels  will slowly  reach  a therapeutic  level  after  administration.  An 
endocrinologist  ([CONTACT_547179]  or [CONTACT_123914])  will determine  the dose  of the basal  insulin  before  CII 
discontinuation  for subject s with  type  1 diabetes.  The next  dose  of basal  insulin  (at home)  and 
transition  to the participants  home  regimen  will be determined  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Pasquel  or [CONTACT_123914].

  108  
The study’s  principal  investigators  ([CONTACT_547179]  or [CONTACT_123914])  will determine  the short  acting  insulin  
dose  to cover  the lunch  (60 grams  of carbs)  that is consumed  at approx imately  1200  hours  on Day 
2, based  on the participant’s  medical  history,  pre-prandial  Reference  Glucose  Value  that is 
measured  by [CONTACT_547173][INVESTIGATOR_547084] , and carbohydrate  load  in the meal.  
 
Subjects  using  insulin  pumps  will start  continuous  subcutaneous  insulin  therapy  with  rapid  acting  
insulin  immediately  after  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_547085]. [CONTACT_547179]  or [CONTACT_123914]  may  adjust  the 
settings  of the subject’s  insulin  pump  prior  to discharge  from  the CRC to minimize  the risk of 
hypoglycemia  or DKA.  
 
2. Type 2 Diabetic Subjects:  
 
Type  [ADDRESS_715861]  four  consecutive  Reference  Glucose  Values  
within  the range  of 80-250 mg/dL,  with  the most  recent  rate of change  being  less than  ± 2 
mg/dL/min,  which  is equal  to either  a single  sideways  arrow  or a single  up or down  arrow  as noted  
in the above  illustration  (Figure  29). 
 
The glucose  sample  source can be either  from  a venous  catheter  sample,  or from  a capi[INVESTIGATOR_547082].  The Nova  StatStrip  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547083].

THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IN TYPE [ADDRESS_715862]  2022 
 
  109  
Both type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects will consume a lunch consisting of 60 grams of 
carbohydrates beginning at 1200 hours on day 2.  
 
The study nurse will check Reference Glucose Values  every 30 minutes with the Nova StatStrip 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_547035] – Times 29, 29.5, 30, 30.5, 31 , 31.5, and 32  hours , etc., until the 
subjects Reference Glucose Values are  in the range of 80 -250 mg/dL  for a period of at least two 
hours after the completion of the closed loop glucose control session, and the most recent 
glucose rate of change is less than ± 2 mg/dL/min.  
 
If the subject is removed from the study early due to the presence of hypoglycemia (e.g., < 54 
mg/dL or < 70 mg/dL with neuroglycopenic symptoms) or for any other reason, they will have 
ongoing monitoring i n the CRC until they have had glucose values in the range of 80 -250 mg/dL 
for a period of at least two hours, and until their most recent glucose rate of change is less than ± 
2 mg/dL/min. In the event the subject is removed from the study early, any short  or long acting 
insulin dosing needed from the time the subject is removed from the study until the time the 
subject is discharged from the CRC, will be per the orders of the study’s principal investigators ([CONTACT_547180] or [CONTACT_123914]).  
 
If the subjects CGM or Reference Glucose Values are less than 70 mg/dL at the time they are 
removed from the study, they will have Reference Glucose Values measured every 10 minutes 
until such time as their glucose values are greater than 70 mg/dL. If the subject develops sig ns of 
diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., Reference Glucose Value > 240 mg/dL and blood ketones > 1 mmol/L), 
they will have a basic metabolic panel, venous pH, and beta hydroxybutyrate drawn. If the subject 
develops diabetic ketoacidosis, they will be stabilized and have ongoing care per the usual routine 
of Emory Healthcare.  
 
21.  Intravenous Catheter Removal:  
Remove both IV catheters once the subjects Reference Glucose Value  is in the range of 80 -250 
mg/dL for a period of at least two hours after the completion of the closed loop glucose control 
session, and when the most recent glucose rate of change is less than ± 2 mg/dL/min. This criterion 
will not be met prior to time 32  hours (  ̴ 1500 hours of 2nd day in the CRC). The subject m ay be 
discharge d from the CRC unit once this criterion has been met.  
22.  Discharge Criteria  
 
The subjects Reference Glucose Value  must be between 80 -250 mg/dL  for a period of [ADDRESS_715863] be  less than ± 2 mg/dL/min . 
For subjects who have been placed back on their usual continuous subcutan eous insulin infusion 
pump, they may be discharged once their Reference Glucose Value  is between 80 -250 mg/dL  for

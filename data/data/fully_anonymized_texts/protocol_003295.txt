 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Study Title  
Evaluation of the Safety, Tole rability, Efficacy and Activity of AMX0035, a Fixed Combination 
of Phenylbutyrate (PB) and Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid (TUDCA), for Treatment of 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)  
 
Version Number  
4.0 
 
Study Indication  
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)  
 
Phase of Development 
II 
 
Rationale for the Study  
The objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of  AMX0035 in subject s with 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a progres sive neurodegenerative disease for which 
there is no cure. T here are only two medi cations approved specifi cally for treating ALS .  This 
includes Rilutek (riluzole), which only provides a modest benefit for  subjects , and Radicava 
(edar avone). ALS also exacts a significant economic burden.  
 AMX0035 has demonstrated e fficacy in models of neurodegeneration, classical activation of 
neuroinflammation, and bioenergetics deficits. The individual components of AMX0035, PB and 
TUDCA have demonstrated efficacy in in vivo models of ALS, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, 
ischemia, and m any others. Each individual  component has also been tested in small clinical 
trials of ALS subject s and w as found to be  safe and well-tolerated, and hit primary endpoints of 
efficacy.  
 The first t rial under this IND will be a randomized double -blind placebo- controlled Phase II trial 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AMX0035 for treatment of ALS. The program is  designed 
to demonstrate that treatment is safe,  can slow the decline in function, muscle strength, and vital 
capacity, and to assess the impact of AMX0035 therapy on biomarkers of ALS including blood 
levels of phosphorylated axonal neurofilament H subunit and [ADDRESS_873507] population. 
 
Study Design 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled 28-w eek study evaluating 
the safety, tolerability, efficacy , pharmacokinetics and biological ac tivity of AMX0035.

 Study Objectives and Endpoints  
The prima ry objective of the study is to assess safety , tolerability,  and efficacy  of oral (or feeding 
tube) administration of AMX0035 via sachet  (3g PB and 1g TUDCA)  twice daily vs. matched 
placebo admini stered  via sachet  twice daily.  
 
The primary outcome measures wi ll be: 
1. To confirm the safety and tolerability of AMX0035 in subject s with ALS over a 24- week  
period 
2. To measure the impact of treatment on disease progression using the slope of  the revised 
Amy otrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS -R) 
 The second ary objectives of the study will be:  
1. To assess the impact of AMX0035 on the rate of decline of isometric muscle strength, as 
measured by [CONTACT_525008] (ATLIS)  
2. To assess the impact of AMX0035 on disease progressi on as measured by [CONTACT_525021] (SVC) decline, time to tracheostomy, and survival 
3. To assess the impact of AMX0035 on biomarkers including blood levels of  
phosphorylated axonal neurofilament H subunit (pNF -H) and 18 kDa translocator protein  
(TSPO) PET tra cer uptake 
4. To determine the population pharmacokinetics parameters of P B and TUDCA at steady 
state during treatment with AM X0035 
5. To measure the impact of the treatment on survival. 
 Study Loca tions  
Up to [ADDRESS_873508] ALS Consortium (NEALS) centers in the [LOCATION_002]  will participate in the 
study.   
Number of Planned Subjects  
Approximately [ADDRESS_873509] sporadic or familial ALS diagnosed as 
definite as d efined by [CONTACT_651390]  (Appendix 1) .  Subjects must provide written 
informed consent prior to screening.  At screening, eligible subjects must be at least [ADDRESS_873510] a V C ≥ 60% of predicted cap acity for age, height and 
gender .  Subjects must have had onset of ALS symptoms less than or equal to [ADDRESS_873511] onset of weakness. Subjects on a stable dose of riluzole and 
those not taking riluzole, and women of child- bearing age at screening are eligible for inclusion

 2 Introduction: Background Information and Scientific Rationale  
2.[ADDRESS_873520] s in the US and an estimated 450,000 people worldwide, according to the ALS 
Association. ALS causes the progressive degeneration of motor neurons, resulting in rapi[INVESTIGATOR_524982]; on average, the disease is fatal within just 3-5 years. There are two  FDA-approved medication s for 
ALS, riluzole, which  only extends survival modestly, and Radicava (edaravone) .  ALS also 
exacts a significant economic burden.  
 
Although the precise cause of  ALS is unknown, ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases such 
as Alzheimer’s are strongly characterized by [CONTACT_525010]. Together these 
processes form a toxic cycle that is a key driver of progressive neurological decline. Recent research has highlighted mitochondrial stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as key mediators of both the nerve cell death and neuroinflammatory processes
1. The mitochondrion is 
the energy production center of the cell, while the ER is the quality control center. These two organelles are in constant communication, and are in fact physically connected by a membrane, and their health is vital to cell survival. When either of these cellular processes go es awry, t he 
resulting stress can either kill the cell and/or create inflammation. The brain is extremely sensitive to both mitochondrial stress and ER stress, and both of these pathways have been strongly implicated in causing neurodegenerative disease. We believe that only therapeutically 
targeting both organelles simultaneously will enact a significant and lasting benefit.  
2.1.2 AMX0035 Rationale  
AMX0035 is a proprietary combination of two small molecules, phenylbutyrate (PB) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), designed to block neuronal death and neurotoxic 
inflammation through simultaneous inhibition of endoplasmic r eticulum (ER) stress and 
mitochondrial stress.  
 Both PB and TUDCA have been evaluated individually in many disease -specific models of ALS 
and other neurodegenerative diseases, and in many nonspecific models of ER Stress and bioenergetic stress, respectively.  
 PB is a pan -HDAC inhibitor and ameliorates ER stress through upregulation of the master 
chaperone regulator DJ -1 and through recruitment of other chaperone proteins
2,3. The large 
increase in chaperone production reduces activation of canonical ER stress pathways, folds misfolded proteins, and has been shown to increase survival in many in vivo models including

Version 7.0 
Version date 30Mar2020 
Page 18 of 102 
 the G93A SOD1 mouse model of ALS4. Phenylbutyrate has also been effective in additional in 
vivo models of Huntington’s Disease, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s5,6,7. 
 
TUDCA recovers mitochondrial bioenergetic deficits through incorporating into the mitochondrial membrane, reducing Bax translocation to the mitochondrial me mbrane, reducing 
mitochondrial permeability, and increasing the apoptotic threshold of the cell
8. TUDCA has 
exhibited efficacy in many in vivo oxidative insult models, including mouse models of stroke, retinal d isease, cardiac disease, brain lipopolysaccharide insult, the MPTP mouse model of 
Parkinson’s, and ALS in vitro models of poly(GA)-induced toxicity
9,10,11. 
 Either ER stress or bioenergetic stress can result in neuronal death and a cytotoxic immune response. We therefore combined PB and TUDCA and have since demonstrated that they have synergistic efficacy when dosed in particular ratios. The combination of agents demonstrated a mathematically synergistic increase in neuronal viability in a strong oxidative insult model (H2O2 -mediated toxicity) by [CONTACT_525011].   
 Cytotoxic neuroinflammation has been found to be a major par t of neurodegeneration
12,13,14. 
Different ratios of AMX0035 reduced classical activation of cytotoxic cytokines and incre ased 
phagocytic cytokines in an LPS-insult, glial model of inflammation .  
2.1.[ADDRESS_873521]  was 
scheduled to receive PB at increasing dose from 9 to 21 g/day. A total of [ADDRESS_873522] s were 
recruited at 8 sites in the U S. Twenty- six subjects completed the 20 -week treatment phase. 
Histone acetylation was decreased by [CONTACT_3450] 50% in blood buffy- coat specimens at 
screening and was significant ly increased after PB administration. Blood levels of PB and the 
primary metabolite, phenylacetate, increased with dosage (Figure 1 ) with a  plateau between the [ADDRESS_873523] dose (9 g/day), was the most effective at increasing  histone acetylation levels in blood 
(Figure 2 ). Treatment  with PB did not alter blood riluzole levels. Adverse events in subject s 
taking riluzole and NaPB together did not occur more frequently, compared to those on PB 
alone.

Version 7.[ADDRESS_873524] at 9 g/day. However, the author noted that in a 
study of PB in Huntington’s disease, the effects of PB on mRNA expression levels of a 12-gene 
biomarker set were greatest at lowest dosages ( 4 g t.i.d.) with an inverse dose response16. 
 
For the planned Phase II trial of PB in combination with TUDCA, we therefore selected a dose of 3 grams of PB twice a day (6 grams per day) as a target dose with the desired pharmacologic effect.  
 Recently, TUDCA at 1g b.i.d. demonstrated a statistically significant slowing of ALSFRS -R 
progression rate in a year -long, multi -site, placebo- controlled clinical trial of ALS
17.  In this 
proof- of-principle trial, [ADDRESS_873525] s under treatment with riluzole were randomized to 
placebo or TUDCA (1 gram b.i.d.) for 54 weeks.  The proportion of responders (defined as subject s with >1 5% improvement in ALSFRS -R slope) was higher under TUDCA (87%) than 
under placebo (P =  0.021; 43%). At study end, baseline- adjusted ALSFRS- R was signiﬁcantly 
higher (P = 0.007) in TUDCA than in placebo groups. Comparison of the slopes of regression analysis showed slower progression in the TUDCA than in the placebo group (P < 0.01) ( Figure 
3). 
 
Figure 3 : Linear regression analysis of ALSFRS -R mean scores 
over time for the TUDCA (circles, slope - 0.388) and placebo 
groups (triangles, slope -0.262). 
 For the planned Phase II trial of PB in combination with TUDCA, we therefore selected a dose of 1 gram of TUDCA twice a day (2 gram s per day) as a target dose.  
 Ursodiol ( UDCA) , the non- taurine conjugated form of TUDCA, was also found to be safe and 
well-tolerated in  a crossover study  subjects with ALS
18. Subjects who received UDCA treatmen t 
also showed significant benefit as measured by  [CONTACT_525012].  
 
 
AMX-0035 in ALS Protocol Number: AMX3500  
Version 7.[ADDRESS_873526] s randomized to active therapy in the Phase II trial will receive 3g PB and 1g TUDCA 
twice a day orally  (or by [CONTACT_525013]) . AMX0035 will be presented as a [ADDRESS_873527]  interrupted treatment 
with PB at the 9 gram per day dose (i.e. a dose higher than that planned in the proposed Phase II) 
for the occurrence of edema on the foot and under the eye. 
2.1.4 Additional Previous Clinical Experience with Phenylbutyrate  
Sodium phenylbutyrate (PB) is ge nerally well tolerated. It is FDA approved for subject s with 
urea cycle disorders including deficiencies of carbamylphosphate synthetase, ornithine 
transcarbamylase, or argininosuccinic acid synthetase. It is indicated in patients with either 
neonatal-onse t deficiency or late -onset disease. The usual total daily dose is 450- 600 mg/kg/day 
in patients weighing less than 20kg, or 9.9- 13.0 g/m
2/day in larger patients.  Detailed information 
can be found on the package insert for PB19. 
 Sodium phenylbutyrate is also under development as an anticancer agent. In a dose escalation study in subject s with refractory solid tumor malignancies doses of up to 45g/day were 
administered
20. Due to dose- limiting toxicities , the study concluded that 27g/day was the 
maximally tolerated dose. Nausea, vomiting, hypocalcemia and fatigue occurred at the 36g/day and 45g/day doses. Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, dyspepsia and vomiting) occurred at  the 
lowest dose of 9g/day and was seen within 30 minutes of drug ingestion. However, 82% of subject s completed the study despi[INVESTIGATOR_524983]. Other frequently reported side effects 
include a "sweat" -like odor, usually noticeable only to the caregiver. Mild neurotoxicity 
(confusion, lethargy) has been noted at higher doses of close to 30g/day, but resolved with dose reduction.   A dose -escalation study of intravenous PB in subject s with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute 
myelogenous leukemia found a  maximally tolerated dose at 375 mg/kg/day (26.3g/day for a 
70kg individual) with no serious toxicities detected in subject s receiving doses between 125 and 
375 mg/kg/day (8.8 and 26.3g/day for a 70kg individual)
 21. Dose -limiting toxicities (lethargy, 
confusion, slurred speech) were detected at 440 and 500 mg/kg/day PB (30.8 and 35g/day respectively, for a 70kg individual). Reports of edema have been blamed on the high sodium

 load associated with the drug. Phase  I/II studies in subjects with sickle cell anemia  (see table 1 
below) and beta thalassemia report similar side effects.  
 
Another phase I study in subject s with refractory solid tumors tested IV PB doses between 150 to  
515 mg/kg/day (up to 36g/day for a 70kg individual) with dose -limiting toxicities (excessive 
somnolence, confusion) and electrolyte abnormalities resulting at a dose of 515 mg/kg/day (36.0 
g/day for a 70kg individual). The maximally tolerated dose of PB was determined to be 410 mg/kg/day (28.7 grams/day for a 70kg individual) as there were no dose -limiting toxicities at this 
dose and no subjects required dose reductions or escalations (see table 1).  
 The most common side effects of PB include: menstrual irregularities, decreased ap petite, sw eat-
like body odor, and bad taste. Less common side effects include: nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, stomach pain, gastritis, headache , and skin rash. Rarely, cases of peptic ulcers, rectal 
bleeding, constipation, pancreatitis and renal tubular acidosis have been reported. Hypoalbuminemia, metabolic acidosis, alkalosis, hyperchloremia, hyperuricemia, hypokalemia, 
hypophosphatemia, hyperphosphatemia and hypernatremia  have been observed . At higher doses, 
some subject s experienced confusion and fatigue, both of which resolved with dose reductions. 
Rarely, the following may occur, but have not been directly linked to sodium phenylbutyrate therapy: anemia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis, arrhythmia, syncope and depression.   Table 1: Prior Clinical Experience with Phenylbutyrate

2.1.5 Additional Previous C linical Experience with TUDCA  
Tauroursodeoxycholic acid is currently marketed in Italy under the brand name [CONTACT_525059] 
( ). It is exported to China and Turkey under the brand name [CONTACT_525060]. It is 
used for the treatment of cholesterol galls tones. It has been used for the treatment of cholestatic 
liver diseases including primary cirrhosis, pediatric familial intrahepatic cholestasis and primary sclerosing cholangitis and cholestasis due to cystic fibrosis. To our knowledge there are no other off label use s of tauroursodeoxycholic acid.  
 Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) , which is widely used in the [LOCATION_002]  for treating gallstones , 
is produced and secreted endogenously by [CONTACT_525015] a taurine (TUDCA)  or glycine  (GUDCA)  
conjugate. Taurine conjugation increases the solubility of UDCA by [CONTACT_525016]. TUDCA is taken up in the distal ileum under active transport and therefore likely has a slightly a longer dwell time within the intestine than UDCA which is taken up more proximally in the ileum (IND ).   TUDCA is widely used for the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones. This generally requires long periods of treatment often 1 to 2 years to obtain complete dissolution (IND ).   Between 1997 and 2007, 898,000 Tudcabil ta blets were sold in Italy ( taken from product profile 
contained in referenced IND ). There were no reported cases of toxicity related to Tudcabil capsules. There were no reports of overdose or drug abuse during this period. There were no reports rela ted to the use of pregnancy (all pregnant subjects, and those planning to 
become pregnant , are excluded from this trial).  Common adverse events include mild abdominal 
pain and diarrhea. There are some cases of pruritus and a very limited number of cases o f 
elevated liver enzymes. It should be noted that most of the studies are conducted in subject s with 
chronic liver disease.

Version 7.[ADDRESS_873530] trouble absorbing bile acids (e.g. ileal disease or resection).  The only known 
or theoretical drug interactions are with substances that inhibit the absorption of bile acids such 
as cholestyramine and with drugs that increase the elimination of cholesterol in the bile (T UDCA 
reduces biliary cholesterol content). Based on similar physicochemical characteristics, it is likely 
that drug toxicity  and interactions are very similar to th ose of ursodeoxycholic acid which are 
summarized below.   TUDCA has been and is being evalua ted in multiple other studies as well. A  study at Columbia 
of [ADDRESS_873531] s are administered 1.75g TUDCA

TUDCA o n lipid markers and ER stress has been completed in [ADDRESS_873532] s at 1.75g daily for 4 
weeks; an additional study arm in this study assessed PB at 20g/day (see table 2) . We have

2.1.6   Previous Clinical Experience with Ursodiol  (UDCA)  
Ursodiol therapy has not been associated with liver damage. Lithocholic acid, a naturally 
occurring bile acid, is known to be a li ver-toxic metabolite. This bile acid is formed in the gut 
from ursodiol less efficiently and in smaller amounts than that seen from chenodiol. Lithocholic acid is detoxified in the liver by [CONTACT_525017], although man appears to be an efficient sulfater, i t 
is possible that some subject s may have a congenital or acquired deficiency in sulfation, thereby 
[CONTACT_525018]- induced liver damage ( IND ). 
 Abnormalities in liver enzymes have not been associated with Actigall® (Ursodiol USP capsules) therapy and, in fact, Actigall® has been shown to decrease liver enzyme levels in liver disease. However, subject s given Actigall® should have SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT) 

 
 
AMX-0035 in ALS Protocol Number: AMX3500  
Version 7.[ADDRESS_873535] been shown to adsorb bile 
acids in vitro and may be expe cted to interfere with ursodiol in the same manner as the bile acid 
sequestering agents (IND ). Estrogens, oral contraceptives, and clofibrate (and perhaps other lipid -lowering drugs) increase hepatic cholesterol secretion, and encourage cholesterol  
gallstone formation and hence may counteract the effectiveness of ursodiol.  Ursodeoxycholic acid was tested in 2- year oral carcinogenicity studies in CD -1 mice and 
Sprague- Dawley rats at daily doses of 50, 250, and 1000 mg/kg/day. It was not tumorigenic in 
mice. In the rat study, it produced statistically significant dose -related increased incidences of 
pheochromocytomas of adrenal medulla in males (p=0.014, Peto trend test) and females (p=0.004, Peto trend test). A 78- week rat study employing intrarectal  instillation of lithocholic 
acid and tauro- deoxycholic acid, metabolites of ursodiol and chenodiol, has been conducted. 
These bile acids alone did not produce any tumors. A tumor -promoting effect of both metabolites 
was observed when they were co -administ ered with a carcinogenic agent. Ursodiol is not 
mutagenic in the Ames test (IND ).   Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with ursodiol doses up to 200-fold the therapeutic dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired ferti lity or harm to the fetus at 
doses of 20 - to 100 -fold the human dose in rats and at 5 -fold the human dose (highest dose 
tested) in rabbits. Studies employing 100- to [ADDRESS_873536] shown some 
reduction in fertility rate and litter siz e. (IND ) There have been no adequate and well -
controlled studies of the use of ursodiol in pregnant women, but inadvertent exposure of [ADDRESS_873537] trimester of pregnancy during the Actigall trials led to no  evidence of effects on the fetus or newborn baby. Although it seems unlikely, the 
possibility that ursodiol can cause fetal harm cannot be ruled out; hence, the drug is not recommended for use during pregnancy.  2.[ADDRESS_873538] s with 
urea cycle disorders.  Refer to the phenylbutyrate tablet label (Buphenyl®).
 
 
In female subject s, the most common clinical adverse event reported w as amenorrhea/menstrual 
dysfunction (irregular menstrual cycles), which occurred in 23% of the menstruating subjects. Decreased appetite occurred in 4% of all subject s. Body odor (probably caused by [CONTACT_525019], phenylacetate [PAA] ) and bad taste or tas te aversion were each reported in 3% of 
subjects.

Other adverse events reported in 2% or fewer subject s were:  
• Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, gastritis, nausea and vomiting; constipation, rectal 
bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, and pancreatitis each occurred in one subject .  
• Hematologic: aplastic anemia and ecchymoses each occurred in one subject .  
• Cardiovascular: arrhythmia and edema each occurred in one subject.  
• Renal: renal tubular acidosis  
• Psychiatric: depression  
• Skin: rash  
• Miscellaneous: headache, syncope, and weight gain  
 Phenylbutyrate has been evaluated in a dose -escalating study in ALS subject s over the course of 
20-weeks and was found to be generally safe and tolerable
15. Specifically, the most common 
adverse events included falls or other  accidental injury , dizziness, diarrhea, edema, dry mouth, 
headache,  nausea, and rash . With the exception of  headache, these adverse events occurred at a 
higher rate compared to  the comparison placebo cohort. These events are expected side effects 
from PB. There were no clinically significant changes in  laboratory values, EKGs or vital signs. 
No deaths or  unexpected and related serious adverse events occurred.  Significant adverse events 
did not occur more  frequently with subjects who were taking riluzole in addition to NPB, 
compared to subjects taking PB  alone. Importantly, this study evaluated daily dosages of 
phenylbutyrate between [ADDRESS_873539] s receiving intr avenous phenylacetate, 250–300 
mg/kg/day for 14 days, repeated at 4- week intervals. Manifestations were predominately 
somnolence, fatigue, and lightheadedness; with less frequent headache, dysgeusia, hypoacusis, disorientation, impaired memory, and exacerb ation of a pre-existing neuropathy. 
 
 These adverse events were mainly mild in severity. The acute onset and reversibility when the phenylacetate infusion was discontinued suggest a drug effect.  The m ost common adverse reactions reported with the use of T UDCA (≥1%) are: abdominal 
discomfort, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, pruritus, and rash.
 
 TUDCA is generally well tolerated. A derivative, UDCA or ursodiol, is approved for subject s 
with primary biliary cirrhosis. Common adverse events  with TUDCA  include mild abdominal 
pain and diarrhea. There are some cases of pruritus and a very limited number of cases of elevated liver enzymes.  
 
 TUDCA has been evaluated over a year -long placebo controlled study in ALS subjects at 1g 
b.i.d
17. The population for safety analysis consist ed of [ADDRESS_873540] s. Laboratory 
parameters did not change in either treatment group during the course of the study. Except for

 the expected com plications related to ALS,  no changes in vital signs and laboratory values that  
could possibly be attributed to the study drug or placebo were recorded. Overall, five adverse 
events were considered by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigators to be study related  based on the subj ects’ 
descriptions. Two events were reported in the [ADDRESS_873541] s (13.3%);  three events 
occurred in the [ADDRESS_873542] s (21.4%). The events were as follows: m ild diarrhea 
occurred in two subject s treated with TUDCA and in two treated with  placebo; anorexia was 
reported in a placebo- treated  subject . Four subject s died during the study period,  one in the 
TUDCA group and three in the placebo group. The one death in the treated group was not 
considered drug related —TUDCA trended towards a survival benefit.   
 
The risks and side effects of muscle strength testing include fatigue and/or muscle crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_873543] both been tested individually in ALS clinical trials and met their 
primary  endpoints of safety  and tolerability . TUDCA also met its efficacy endpoint of slowing 
ALSFRS- R decline, and PB was therapeutically efficient in improving histone acety lation levels. 
If successful, this trial will allow further clinical development of this therapy to potentially slow ALS progression. The trial is also assessing multiple biomarkers in concert with clinical endpoints, which will allow  both a more detailed understanding of drug activity as well as serve 
as a data set for the field as a whole to help understand how these biomarkers might track ALS progression.

The primary outcome measures will be:  
1. To confirm the safety and tolerability of a fixed -dose combination of PB and TUDCA in 
subjects with ALS over a 6- month period ; 
2. To measure the impact of the treatment using the slope of progression with the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS -R); 
 
The secondary objectives of the study will be:  
1. To assess the impact  of AMX0035 on the rate of decline of isometric muscle  strength, as 
measured by [CONTACT_525008] (ATLIS) ; 
2. To assess the impact of AMX0035 on disease progression as measured by [CONTACT_525021] (SVC) decline, time to tracheost omy and survival; 
3. To assess the impact of AMX0035 on biomarkers including phosphorylated axonal neurofilament H subunit (pNF- H) levels and 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) uptake;  
4. To develop concentration- response models of TUDCA and phenylbutyrate at s teady -state 
after administration of AMX0035 sachet twice -daily.  
5. To measure the impact of AMX0035 on survival. 
 3.2 Study Outcome Measures  
3.2.1 Primary Outcome Measures  
The primary  outcome  measures for the study will include : 
• Safety  and tolerability  as def ined as the proportion of subject s able to remain on study 
drug until planned discontinuation. 
• The rate  of
 decline (slope of decline) in the ALS  functional rating  scale (ALSFRS-R).   
 Safety and tolerability will be assessed by  [CONTACT_525022] 9. 
 The revised version of the ALSFRS was created to add assessments of respi[INVESTIGATOR_26517], including dyspnea, orthopnea, and the need for ventilatory support.
 The revised ALSFRS 
(ALSFRS- R) has been  demonstrated to retain the properties of the original scale and show strong 
internal consistency and construct validity.  
 Survival endpoint will be defined as death, tracheostomy or permanent assisted  ventilation (> 22 
hours a day).

Version 7.[ADDRESS_873552] 30  days will be excluded from 
the trial. However, subjects who are using Mexiletine at a dosage less than or equal to 
300mg/day for cramps and fasciculations will not be excluded.   There is a potential for an interaction between AMX0035 and Mexiletine ; at 20 times the 
intended clinical concentration (C
max), the principal metabolite of Phenylbutyrate, 
Phenylacetylacetate has been shown to be inhibitory to CYP 1A2 and CYP 2D6 which are the major enzymes responsible for the breakdown of Mexiletine. Therefore, it is possible the co-
administration of Phenylbutyrate and Mexiletine will increase the subject ’s exposure to 
Mexiletine.  
 Subjects who are co -administered AMX0035 and Mexiletine should therefore be monitored for 
Mexiletine- associated adverse events, and if these events present , the Site I nvestigator should 
consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_524990] . Adverse events ass ociated with 
Mexiletine include but are not limited to cardiac arrhythmias, liver injury, and blood dyscrasias.  
5.[ADDRESS_873553] who meets all eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive either therapy by [CONTACT_525026]0035 (3g PB and 1g TUDCA)  or matching placebo for [ADDRESS_873554] will be discontinued from participation in the study if: 
• Any clinical adverse event (AE ), laboratory abnormality, requirement for a concomitant 
medication, concurrent illness, or other medical condition or situation occurs such that , in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , continued participation in the study would not be in the 
best interest of the subject.  
• The subject is non- compliant or is lost -to-follow -up. 
 
 
AMX-0035 in ALS Protocol Number: AMX3500  
Version 7.[ADDRESS_873555] may choose to discontinue participation in the study at any time.  However, the Site Investigator (SI) or designee will encourage subjects to cont inue with follow -up, regardless of 
their compliance with the  study drug.  If the SI or designee is concerned about the use of a 
prohibited medication or other safety issues, then the study drug may have to be reduced to single dose or discontinued.  If a subject permanently discontinues study drug, t he SI or design ee 
should still encourage subjects to follow the study protocol under the modified  intent- to-treat 
principle (ITT). These subjects will be encouraged to follow the study visits, off drug. Loss to follow -up should be prevented whenever possible.  
 Any subject who is on study drug and needs to begin the use of any prohibited medication, must immediately discontinue use of the study drug and should not begin use of the prohibited medication before an appropriate wash -out period of at least [ADDRESS_873556] a Follow- Up Telephone Call 
no sooner than 28 days  (+5 days) after taking their last dose of study drug to monitor their safety 
and to permit review of their medical records at the e nd of the study to document their vital 
status.   Subjects who withdraw from the study due to adverse events will be followed for outcome measures under the ITT protocol as noted above. T he DSMB will review these events promptly 
and make recommendations ab out potential changes to the study, including possible changes to 
protocol, updates to the informed consent form, or even ending the study early.    In the event a subject wishes to no longer have their personal health information used for the analysis of this study, he or she will notify the site through an authorized letter and future data will not be included in analysis; however, all data up to this letter will still be included.

For subjects with a gastrostomy or nasogastric (feeding) tube, the study drug may be dissolved in 
water as per the procedures outlined above in Section 6.3 and the study drug may be 
administered via the feeding tube.     
6.4 Modification of Study Intervention/Investigatio nal Product For A S ubject  
Any dosage adjustment, including the reason for and da tes of adjustmen t, will be documented in 
the CRF for each subject requiring this manipulation. The SI or designated licensed physician 
Sub-Investigator may reduce the dosage of study drug or dis continue the study drug in its 
entirety for adverse events (AE s) thought to be  related to the study drug or for other reasons 
during the trial (the reason for, and dates of suspension or dose reduction must be documented). All dose modifications need to be  discussed with the study Medical Monitor.  If the AE is mild 
or moderate, the  dosage may be reduced until the event improves.  The SI or designated licensed 
physician Sub- Investigator may then choose to resume the higher dosage or maintain the subject 
at a reduced dosage.   If the event is serious or life threatenin g, and deemed to  be definitely drug related, the study drug 
will be discontinued immediately. Study subjects must remain off the study drug permanently. Subjects may not resume study drug.  All A Es will be followed to resolution  within the study for 
28 days (+ 5 days) aft er a subject’s last dose of study drug.  
6.4.1. Dosage Discontinuation Reasons for discontinuation of study drug may include an AE, Medical Monitor or Site 
Investigator recommend ation, Sponsor termination, protocol deviation, lost -to-follow -up, subject 
request, or death.  All serious adverse events (SAEs) that occur in a subject who has discontinued 
early must be recorded and reported within 24- hours of awareness.   
 
Study subject s who discontinue study drug prematurely (early termination from study) and 
decide to not remain  in the  modified  intent- to-treat (ITT) portion of the study will be encouraged 
to return for a Final Safety/Early Termination  Visit and participate in a Follow -Up Telephone 
Call 28 days (+ 5 days) after the last dose of st udy drug.  
 All subjects who discontinue study drug early and choose to remain in the ITT portion of the 
study will be encouraged to follow the study visits, off drug, up to the time of the last  visit 
(Follow -Up Telephone Call).   
 SAEs will be followed for resolution for 28 days (+5 days) after a subject’s last dose of study 
drug, regardless of whether they prematurely discontinued study drug or completed 2 4 weeks of 
treatment.

Version 7.[ADDRESS_873562] Compliance  
Subjects will be instructed to return emp ty and unused study drug containers at each clinic Visit 
(Weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24) or the Final Safety Visit (whichever occurs first). In the event that a 
remote study visit occurs, the subject will be instructed to return empty and unused study drug 
contai ners from previous study drug kits at the next clinic visit.  
Site staff  will count returned and unused sachets to determine compliance.  
 Non-compliance will be otherwise defined as taking less than 80% or more than 125% of study 
drug as determined by [CONTACT_651394].  If a study subject is non- compliant with study drug, the 
Site Investigator (SI) or designee should re -educate and train the subject in administration of 
study drug.  Data indicating non-compliance will be used in the end of study analysis.   6.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy

Vital signs, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate (radial artery)/minute, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]/minute, temperature and weight will be assessed at spec ified visits.  Height will 
be measured and recorded at the Screening Visit only.   
8.1.2 Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
The following laboratory tests will be performed for safe ty: 
 
o Hematology with differential panel: complete blood count with differentia l (hematocrit, 
hemoglobin, platelet count, RBC indices, Total RBC, Total WBC, and WBC & 
differential)

o Serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) for women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) (collected only at Screening Visit, and as n ecessary throughout course of 
study) 
 All subjects will have safety  laboratory  tests at the designated visits outlined in the protocol. 
These samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory.  The Site Investigator (SI) may order additional testing, if nee ded, to further assess an adverse event (AE), or if there is any su spi[INVESTIGATOR_318352] a subject may be pregnant, throughout the course of the study.

timeframes; however, all samples should be analyzed regardless of actual collection time. The time of administration will be noted.  T he time of the last meal prior to administration and the 
time of th e drug administration(s) in the previous 24 hours will also be noted.   
 
Additionally, blood will be collected for biomarker analysis, including light and heavy 
neurofilament testing  (NF-L and pNF -H, respectively) . Neurofilaments will be used as a 
mechanistic measure of neuronal death. These proteins are greatly elevated in ALS subject s and 
promising results from multiple trials suggest this marker may be prognostic of clinical decline. NF-L and pNF -H will be tested over multiple time points with the intention of gene rating a 
longitudinal dataset correlating neurofilament levels to observed clinical outcomes. This dataset will help to validate AMX0035 therapeutic mechanism and provide a datase t for the ALS field.  
 All samples will be labeled with a code.  T he code wil l not include any identifiable information.

information from these genetic studies may be made available to collaborators in academia, not-
for-profit settings, or industry for appropriate research.   Results of DNA testing from this study 
will not go into the participant’s medical record.    
The NYGC will be conducting the sequencing of the coded samples, doing the analysis o f the 
sequencing and sharing the results of such sequencing and analysis with researchers pursuant to 
this protocol, as well as uploading the data to data repositories such as the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbG aP).  
 
8.1.5  12- Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A standard 12- lead ECG will be performed .  Tracings will be reviewed by a central ECG reader  
and a copy of the tracings will be kept on site as part of the source documents. The central ECG 
vendor will provide  standard ECG devices for every site and provide training as necessary.   
8.1.6 Physical Examination 
A comprehensive physical examination will be performed and recorded .   
8.1.7 Neurological Examination  A neurological examination will be performed and recorded. Examination will include 
assessment of mental status, cranial nerves, mo tor and sensory function, reflexes, coordination, 
and stance/gait.    
 8.1.8 Upper Motor Neuron -Burden (UMN -B) 
The Penn Upper Motor Neuron- Burden (UMN -B) is the total number of pa thological UMN signs 
on examination including pathologically brisk biceps, supi[INVESTIGATOR_318355], triceps, finger, knee and ankle  
reflexes, and extensor plantar responses assessed bilaterally and brisk facial and jaw jerks.  The scale is a combination of Ashworth, Ref lexes, and Pseudobulbar Affect scale (Range score: 0 -
32).  The UMN also includes scoring of the Center for Neurologic  Study- Lability Scale (CNS -LS), a 
7-item self- report scale that assesses pseudobulbar affect (PBA)  by [CONTACT_651396] P BA epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (laughing or crying).  Data is generated from the clinical exam a nd

 8.1.9 Columbia Suicide Severity Ratin g Scale  (C-SSRS)  
The US FDA recommends the use of a suicidality assessment in strument that maps to the 
Columbia Classification Algorithm for Suicide Assessment (C -CASA)

Version 7.0 
Version date 30Mar2020 
Page 64 of 102 
 Rating Scale (C -SSRS)23. The C -SSRS involves a series of probing questions to inquire  about 
possible suicidal thinking and behavior. 
 
At the Baseline Visit, the C -SSRS Baseline version will be administe red.  This version is used to 
assess suicidality over the subject’s lifetime. 
 At all clinic visits after the Baseline Visit , the Since Las t Visit version of the C -SSRS will be 
administered. This version of the scale  assesses suicidality since the subject’ s last visit.  
8.1.10  Exit Questionnaire  
An exit questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_525034] (Week 24). This will include questions regarding blindedness and overall experience with  
the trial.  
 
8.1.11  Adver se Events  
Adverse events (AEs) will be documented at each study visit, including the Screening Visit once 
the informed consent form has be en signed by [CONTACT_423], and at all study visits, including the 
Final Telepho ne Call 28 days (+ 5 days) after the las t dose of study drug.  Information on 
adverse effects of study drug and on inter -current events will be determined at each visit by 
[CONTACT_525035], review of concomitant medications, and vital sign results.  
8.2 Outcome Measures 
8.2.1 A LSFRS -R (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale – Revised)  
The ALSFRS- R is a quickly administered (5 minutes) ordinal ratin g scale (ratings 0 -4) used to 
determine subjects' assessment of their capabili ty and independence in [ADDRESS_873589] be NEALS certified.  
8.2.2 Pulmonary Function Testing  - Slow Vital Capacity  (SVC)  
Slow Vital Capacity (SVC): The vital capacity (VC) (percent of predicted normal) will be 
determined, using the upright slow VC method. The VC can be measured using conventional spi[INVESTIGATOR_318353] a calibration check prior to subject testing.  A printout from the 
 
 
AMX-0035 in ALS Protocol Number: AMX3500  
Version 7.[ADDRESS_873590] VC is 10% or greater for the first [ADDRESS_873591] VC recorded is utilized  for eligibility.  
8.2.3 Isometric Stren gth Testing  (ATLIS)  
Accurate Testing of Limb Isometric  Strength: We are measuring isometric strength using the 
Accurate Testing of Limb Is ometric Strength device (ATLIS) developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Patricia Andres 
of [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The device was spe cifically designed to alleviate the 
reproducibility concerns that exist for prior strength measurements such a s hand held 
dynamometry (HHD ). ATLIS does not depend on experimenter strength, and has measurement 
setting s to ensure that subject s are in the sam e position each time they are tested.  All ATLIS 
evaluators must be trained and certified. ATLIS may detect functional decline before the ALSFRS- R, which may have a ceiling effect, and may be able to detect changes i n function with 
greater sensitivity to A LSFRS- R. The measure does show a small training effect, so we will 
include measurement at initial screening visit to allow subject s to become acquainted with the 
device.  
8.2.[ADDRESS_873592] instructions  will be provided in 
the S ite Manual  of Procedure s (MOP) .  
8.2.[ADDRESS_873593] be NEALS certified to perform the ALSFRS -R, SVC and ATLIS; specific 
certification requirements are outlined in the study operations manual. Repeat NEALS certification will be required every two years for al l NEALS certified outcome measures. It is 
strongly preferred that a single evaluator performs all measures throughout the study, if possible. NEALS certification is required for all evaluators prior to performing any study tests.

 9 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
The adverse event (AE) definitions and reporting procedures provided in this protocol comply 
with all applicable [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines.  The Site Inves tigator will 
carefully monitor each subject throughout the study for possible adverse events.  All AEs will be 
documented on CRFs designed specifically for this purpose.  It is also important to report all AEs, especially those that result in permanent dis continuation of the investigational product 
being studied, whether serious or non -serious.  
9.1 Definitions of AEs, Sus pected Adverse Drug Reactions & SAEs 
9.1.1 Adverse Event and Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions  
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease te mporally associated with a 
study, use of a drug product or device whether or not considered related to the drug product or device.   Adver se drug reactions (ADR) are all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product 
related to any dose.  The phra se “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a subset of AEs can be classified as suspe cted ADRs, if there is a causal relationship to the medicinal product.  
 Examples of adverse events include: new conditions, worsening of pre -existing conditions, 
clinically significant abnormal physical examination s igns (i.e. skin rash, peripheral edema, etc), 
or clinically significant abnormal test results (i.e. lab values or vital signs), with the exception of outcome measure results, which are not being recorded as adverse events in this trial (they are being coll ected, but analyzed separately). Stable chronic conditions (i.e., diabetes, arthritis) that 
are present prior to the start of the study and do not worsen during the trial are NOT  considered 
adverse events.  Chronic conditions that occur more frequently (for intermittent conditions) or with greater severity, would be considered as worsened and therefore would be recorded as adverse events.  
 Adverse events are generally detected in two ways:  
  
Clinical   symptoms reported by [CONTACT_243075]. 
 
Ancillary Tests   abnormalities of vital signs, laboratory tests, and other diagnostic 
procedures (other than the outcome measures, the results of which are not bein g captured 
as AEs).  
 
 
 
AMX-0035 in ALS Protocol Number: AMX3500  
Version 7.0 
Version date 30Mar2020 
Page 67 of 102 
 For the purposes of this study, symptoms of progression/worsening of ALS, including ‘normal’ 
progression, will be recorded as adverse events.      
The following measures of disease progression will not be recorded as adverse events even if 
they worsen (they are being recorded and analyzed separately): vital capa city results , ALSFRS-
R, and ATLIS result s. 
 If discernible at the time of completing the AE log, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_246412].  However, if an observed or reported sign, symptom, or clinically significant laboratory anomaly is not considered by [CONTACT_246413] a component of a specific disease or syndrome, then it should be recorded as a separate AE on the AE log.  
Clinically significant laboratory abnormalit ies, such as those that require intervention, are those 
that are identified as such by [CONTACT_67505].  
 Subjects will be monitored for adverse events from the time they sign consent until completion of their p articipation in the study (defined as de ath, consent withdrawal, loss to follow up, early 
study termination for other reasons or following completion of the entire study).   
 An unexpected adverse event is any adverse event, the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the current  Investigator’ s Brochure.  An unexpected, suspected adverse drug 
reaction is any unexpected adverse event for which , in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_651386] (or their designee), there is a reasonable possi bility that the investigational product 
caused the event.  
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that meets any of the followin g 
criteria:  
1. Results in death.  
2. Is life threatening: that is, poses an immediate  risk of death as the event occurred.  
a. This serious criterion applies if the study subject, in the view of the Site 
Investigator or Sponsor, is at immediate risk of death from the  AE as it occurs.  It 
does not apply if an AE hypothetically might have caused  death if it were more 
severe.  
3. Requires in-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
a. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34096] (including elective PEG tube/g-tube/feeding tube placement) or a routinely scheduled treatment is not an SAE by [CONTACT_651397] “procedure” or a “treatment” is not 
an untoward medical occurrence. 
4. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
 
 
AMX-0035 in ALS Protocol Number: AMX3500  
Version 7.0 
Version date 30Mar2020 
Page 68 of 102 
 a. This serious criterion applies if the “disability” caused by [CONTACT_318378] a substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions. 
5. Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the s ubject (whether the 
subject is male or female).   
6. Necessitates medical or surg ical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a 
body function or permanent damage to a body structure. 
7. Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243047], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include blood dyscrasias or convulsions  that do not result in in -patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 An in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243048] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], treat ment- emergent, clinical 
adverse event may meet criteria for "seriousness" but is not an adverse experience, and will 
therefore, not be considered an SAE.  An example of this would include a social admission 
(subject admitted for other reasons than medical,  e.g., lives far from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], has no place to 
sleep).  
 A serious, suspected adverse drug reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is an SAE for which , in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_524997], there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused the event.  The Site Investigator is responsible for classifying adverse events as serious or non -serious. 
9.[ADDRESS_873594] throughout the study for possible AEs.  All AEs will be documented on source document templates and e CRFs designed specifically for 
this purpose.  All AEs will be collected and reported in the electronic data capture (EDC) system 
and compi[INVESTIGATOR_651387]. The Medical Monitor shall promptly review all information relevant to the safety of the investigational product,  
including all serious adverse events (SAEs).  Special attention will be paid to those that result in permanent discontinuation of the investigational product being studied, whether serious or non-serious.  
 9.2.1 Assessment of Adverse Events 
At each visit (including telephone interviews), the subject will be asked if they have had any 
problems or symptoms since their last visit in order to d etermine the occurrence of adverse 
events.   If the subject reports an adverse event, the Investigator will probe furt her to determine:  
1. Type of event 
2. Date of onset and resolution (duration)

 1.  Not Related:          Concomitant illness, accident or event with no reasonable association with treatment.  
 2.  Unlikely: The reaction has little or no temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product, and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists. 
 3.  Possibly Related:  The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product and follows a known response pattern to the suspected investigational product; the reaction co uld have been produced by [CONTACT_246415]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_243079]. (Suspe cted 
ADR)  
 4.  Probably Related: The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from administration of investigational product; is confirmed by [CONTACT_246416] -challenge; 
and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state. (Suspected ADR)  
 5.  Definitely Related:  The reaction follows  a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of investigational product; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the investigational product; and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_651388], and reappearance of the reaction on 
repeated exposure. (Suspected ADR)

Version 7.[ADDRESS_873597] (DSMB) will be assembled for the trial. The 
DSMB receives the blinded and unblinded summary r eports of the frequency of all clinical 
adverse events and safety laboratory t ests for planned periodic meetings as specified in the 
DSMB charter . In addition, the DSMB Chair may call ad hoc meetings. Meetings will be held 
via teleconference.  A DSMB Charte r will detail the processes of this group.   
 Summaries of serious adverse events and enrollment will be provided appr oximately monthly to 
the DSMB by [CONTACT_525037]. Any possibly, probably or definitely study drug related,  
serious adverse events (i.e. serious adverse drug reactions, or S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are considered events of 
interest and will be reported in real -time (within 1 business day of Coordination Center (CC) 
awareness) to the DSMB. All adverse events and abnormal laboratory values results wi ll be 
listed and will be completely identified (using MedDRA adverse reaction codes) by [CONTACT_651398].  The DSMB c an ask to receive the SAE reports more frequently.  As necessary, the 
DSMB can review the frequencies of clinical and laboratory abnormalities.  Recommendations for modification or termination of the trial based on s afety data will be made by [CONTACT_651399] t he 
PIs and Steering Committee.  The DSMB will review safety data throughout the trial and may stop the trial for safety if they determine that there is a significant difference in the rate of a particular adverse event that would indicate a risk that is gr eater than the possible benefit of the 
study drug.  A notable increase in the frequency of any adverse event should be examined by [CONTACT_9288] B although it may not lead to a recommendation by [CONTACT_4318].  
 Prior to each DS MB meeting, the CC will provide an update to the DSMB on enrollment, data 
quality (missing data) and protocol adherence.  The CC will be responsible for communication with the DS MB.

 Power for safety and tolerability was considered in three ways: incidence of adverse events 
(AEs), change in ALFSR -R and ATLIS, and change in biomarker such as pNF- H. 
 
With [ADDRESS_873600] an 80% probability of detecting any adverse event 
expected to occur in at least 2% of treated subject s. We will have 80% power to detect a [ADDRESS_873601] at alpha = 0.05. We will consider a dose tolerable if the proportion of treatment  
failures (discontinuation of study drug due to an adverse event) is less than 40% with 80% 
confidence, one -tailed. With [ADDRESS_873602] 80% power for 
declaring AMX0035 tol erable at the tested dose if the true treatment failure rate is 30%.  
 
A shared -baseline, mixed -effects analysis will be used for primary a nalysis. A covariate of 
bulbar onset or onset elsewhere  and a second covariate  of age at enrollment  will be included i n 
the analysis. The mixed -effects model accounts for both the variance between subject s and the 
deviation within subject s from their avera ge rate of decline. We will use the same analysis for 
clinical outcomes in this trial. We propose to test at an alpha of 0. 05. 
 Further detail on primary analysis and analysis rationale for secondary endpoints will be included in the Statistical Analysis P lan (SAP).

occurrence of each adverse event and i ncidence of Grade III/IV adverse events. Total number of 
serious adverse event s and abnormal laboratory tests will be compared between groups using 
Fisher's exact test. Withdrawal, abnormal laboratory tests, vital signs and use of concomitant medications w ill be assessed to characterize the safety profile of the combination of PB an d 
TUDCA. Compliance data will be determi ned for each visit and by [CONTACT_1570]. The time to 
subject refusal will be compared between treatment groups to better determine tolerability. This 
will be accomplished using a method of survival analysis that allows informative censoring due to death. Descriptive statistics denoting the changes from baseline to the final assessment visit 
with respect to key laboratory parameters and vital signs will also be provided.

assessment after ran domization. Slope will be imputed from a vailable data and time points. 
Homogeneity of clinical characteristics and efficacy variables at baseline between the two randomization gr oups (between- group baseline differences) will be assessed by [CONTACT_525041] a c hi-squared test for discrete variables. All efficacy 
endpoints will compared between the two randomization groups at study end (between-group 
differences at study end) by [CONTACT_525042], adjusting for baseline valu e and for center effect, and by a chi -squared test for discrete variables. Survival 
time will compared between treatments by a Kaplan –Meie r survival analysis.  
 The primary analysis strategy will use a shared -baselin e, mixed -effects model of ALSFRS -R 
progr ession rate. The mixed -effects model accounts for both the variance between subject s and 
the deviation within subject s from their average rate of decline. We will use the same analysis 
for clinical outcomes in this t rial. We propose to test at an alpha of 0. 05. We are targeting an 
effect size (slowing of ALSFRS -R slope) greater than 30% based on the trial by [CONTACT_525043]
17. In 
the Phase I/II t rial of TUDCA that analyzed a total of 29 subjects, the ALSFRS -R score declined 
32.5% more slowly in the TUDCA group: the slopes of the two regression lines were 
significantly different ( -0.262/week for the TUDCA group, - 0.388/week for the placebo group; P  
< 0.01). 
10.2.4 Analysis Populations  
The modified  intent to treat (ITT) population will include all study subjects who are randomized 
and receive at least one dose of study drug. The ITT population will be considered for primary 
analyses. For ITT analyses, subjects will be grouped based on randomized treatment, regardless of treatment actually received.   10.3 Missing Da ta 
The trial will be modified  intent to treat (ITT).  Every effort will be made to obtain follow -up 
information for all subjects whether or not they continue on treatment.

 13 APPENDICES  
13.1 APPENDIX I: EL ESCORIAL WORLD FEDERATION OF NEUROLOGY 
CRITERIA FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF ALS  
 Information obtained from the web site: www.wfnals.org . 
 The diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [ALS] requires:  
 A - The presence of:  
 (A:1) evidence of lower motor neuron (LMN) degeneration by [CONTACT_2085], electrop hysiology
 or neuropathologic examination,   (A:2) evidence of upper motor neuron (UMN) d egeneration by [CONTACT_12148], and  
 (A:3) progressive spread of symptoms or signs within a region or to other regions, as determine d by [CONTACT_525049], together with  
 B - The absence of:  
 (B:1) electrophysiological and pathological evidence of other disease processes that 
might explain the signs of LMN and/or UMN degeneration, and  
 (B:2) neuroimaging evidence of other disease  processes that might explain the observed 
 clinical and electrophy siological signs.  
 CLINICAL STUDIES IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF ALS  
 A careful history, physical and neurological examination must search for clinical evidence of UMN and LMN signs in four regions  [brainstem, cervical, thoracic, or lumbosacral spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]] 
(see T able 1) of the central nervous system [CNS]. Ancillary tests should be reasonably applied, 
as clinically indicated, to exclude other disease processes. These should include electrodiagnosti c, neurophysiological, neuroimaging and clinical laboratory studies .  Clinical 
evidence of LMN and UMN degeneration is  required for the diagnosis of ALS.  The clinical 
diagnosis of ALS, without pathological confirmation, may be categorized into various levels of certainty by [CONTACT_651401] [bulbar cranial motor neurons], cervical, thoracic, or lumbosacral spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] [anterior horn motor neurons]. The terms 
Clinical Definite ALS and Clinicall y Probable ALS are used to describe these categories of 
clinical diagnostic certainty on clinical criteria alone:  
 A. Clinically Definite ALS is defined on clinical evidence alone by [CONTACT_651402], as 
well as LMN signs, in three regions.   B. Clinica lly Probable ALS is defined on clinical evidence alone by [CONTACT_525052] (above) the LMN signs.  
 
 
AMX-0035 in ALS Protocol Number: AMX3500  
Version 7.[ADDRESS_873610] two limbs, with proper 
applicatio n of neuroimaging and clinical laboratory protocols to exclude othe r causes.  
 D. Clinically Possible ALS is defined when clinical signs of UMN and LMN dysfunction are found together in only one region or UMN signs are found alone in two or more regions; or  
LMN signs are found rostral to UMN signs and the diagnosis of Clinically Probable - Laboratory -supported ALS cannot be proven by [CONTACT_525053], neurophysiologic, neuroimaging or clinical laboratory studies. Other diagnoses must have been excluded to accept a diagnosis of Clinically Possible ALS.

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)  Lifetime  
Actual Attempt:  
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in 
part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to die 
associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be 
any injury or ha rm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but 
gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or 
circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide 
can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done anything to harm yourself?  
Have you done anything dangerous where you could  have died?  
What did you do?  
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?  
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?  
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / witho ut ANY intention of killing yourself (like 
to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)? (Self-
Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

 Interrupted Attempt:  
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) from starting the potentially self-injurious act (if 
not for that, actual attempt would have occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609]. Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an 
attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away 
by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun 
fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

The following instructions will be provided orally to the patient at the Baseline  Visit by a 
healthcare staff member. Please have the Listerine® products  (Pocketpaks® and Pocketmist®) 
available for demonstration. 
 
- Alert the patient that the study drug has a strong bitter taste, but that there are ways to make it more palatable (see b elow).  
 - Rip open the sachet of study drug and add it to a cup or other container and add approximately 8 oz. (1 cup) of room temperature water and stir vigorously. Study drug may require significant 
stirring or gentle crushing to dissolve.   - The treatm ent should be taken within one hour of mixing into water. 
 - Several things may be done to reduce the bad taste and make the drug more palatable:  
 
1) Use Listerine Pocket Packs®  (strips)  or a Listerine PocketMist®  (spray) immediately 
before and/or immediately after taking the drug. Use liberally to coat the mouth. This has been found to significantly  mask the bitter taste.  
 2) Take a snack or a meal after taking your treatment.  
 3) Follow drug immediately with milk to remove taste from the mouth.  
 4) Avoid drinking fruit juice at the same time as the drug as this may make flavor worse.  
 
- Mixing the study drug with a liquid other than water should be avoided.

Study Indica tion 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)  
 
Phase of Development  
II 
Rationale for the Study  
The objective of this study is to determine the long- term safety of AMX0035 in subjects with Amyotrophic 
Lateral Scleros is (ALS). ALS is a  progressive neurodegenerati ve disease for which there is no cure. There are 
only two medicines approved specifically for treating ALS, Rilutek (riluzole) and Radicava (edaravone). ALS 
also exacts a significant economic burden . 
 
AMX0035 has demonstrated ef ficacy in models of neurodegeneration, classical activation of 
neuroinflammation, and bioenergetics deficits. The individual components of AMX0035, PB and TUDCA have demonstrated efficacy in in vivo models of ALS, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s , ischemia, and many others. 
Each individual component has also been tested in small clinical trials of ALS subjects and was found to be safe and well -tolerated, and hit primary endpoints of efficacy. 
 
Study Design and Plan  
This is a multicente r, open label extension, up to 132- week study evaluating the long -term safety of 
AMX0035. Up to one hundred thirty- two (132) subjects will be given oral (or feeding tube) twice daily sachet 
of active therapy.  Treatment duration will be  up to one thirty -two (132 ) wee ks starting at the  
Screening/Baseline visit.  C linic visits will occur at Screening/Baseline, Week 6 (day 42), Week 12 (day 84), 
Week 24 (day 168), Week 36 (day 252), and Week 52 (Day 364) , Week 6 8 (Day 476), Week 8 4 (Day 588), 
Week 10 0 (Day 700), Week 116 (Day 812), Week 132 (Day 924) . Study visits may occur  remotely,  as needed.  
If possible, remote visits should be conducted using a HIPAA -compliant video conferencing platform. If video 
conferencing is not available or not feasible, remote visi ts may be co nducted by [CONTACT_648]. If the visit is not  
conducted in person, the following procedures should be completed in the following suggested order: 
ALSFRS-R, AE Review, Key Study Event, Concomitant Medications, Columbia- Suicide Severity Scale.  
 All visit windows are  consecutive calendar days and are calculated f rom the day the subject starts study 
treatment (Day 0, the day of the Screening/Baseline Visit). The  screening/Baseline visit must  occur within 28 
days of the Week 24 visit of the main study.  If t he Screening/Baseline visit occurs on the day of the Week 2 4 
visit or within 7 days of that visit then it is not necessary to complete the assessments, labs and outcomes.  If the Screening/Baseline visit occurs Day 8 – Day 28 then all assessments, labs and outcomes ne ed to be 
comple ted.  Visit windows will be +/- 10 days for the Week 6 and Week 12 visits and +/ - 28 days for the Week 
24, Week 36, Week 52, Week 6 8, Week 8 4, Week 100, Week 116 and Week 132 visits. Any change from this 
visit window will be cons idered an out of window visit deviation.

 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Study Purpose  
To determine the Clinical Accuracy of the welloStationX  by: 
• evaluating  clinical bias with stated uncertainty ; and  
• determining  clinical repeatability . 
1.2 Indications for Use  
The results of this clinical study are intended to support the following 
indications for use: “ “The welloStationX  is a non -contact [CONTACT_843690] . The welloStationX  can be used by [CONTACT_843691]. The welloStationX  
has an ambient operating temperature range of 59F – 82.4F (15C – 28C).”  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1172487].   
 
The welloStationX  is being evaluated for use  for the screening of individuals for 
fever.   
 
Deatiled information on the configuration and operation of the welloStationX  can be 
found in the accompanying welloStationX  Use and Care Manual . 
2.1 Risk Analysis  
The general risks associated with the welloStationX  device are relatively 
minimal based on a review of published literature and known safety issues 
associated wi th the use of these types of infrared thermo meter  devices.  
Wello  has taken steps throughout the manufacture and design of the 
welloStationX  to reduce or eliminate all potential risks to the user.   Wello  has 
identified the potential risks and actions taken to address each risk below:  
• The welloStationX  is not intended to be used around water.  Do not set up 
the welloStationX  near a sink or other wet area.  If it is necessary to place 
near a sink or other w et area, make sure the unit is plugged into a working 
GFCI outlet.  
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVATE INFORMATION OF WELLO , INC.  Page 8 of 18 
Protocol Number:  WS-001 
Original Issue Date:  08/18/2018  
 • Always operate the thermometer in an operating temperature range 16°C 
to 40°C (60.8°F to 10°F), and relative humidity less than 95%.  
• Always store the welloStationX  in a cool and dry place -20°C to 50°C ( -4°F 
to 122°F) and relative humidity less than 95%.  
• Do Not Attempt Repairs – Do not attempt to open, take apart, service or 
modify the product or power supply to avoid the risk of electrical shock.  
Any attempt to op en or service the product will void the Limited 
Warranty.  
• Important AC Adapter Safety  
• Use only the power supply units supplied with the unit.  
• Do not use non -standard sources for power such as generators or 
inverters.  Only use standard AC power provided by  a standard wall 
outlet.  
• Do not overload the wall outlet or power strip or extension cord.   
• Check AC plug to make sure the prongs are configured properly and 
are of the proper configuration for the wall adapter.  
• Ensure the power cord is not left in a posi tion where it can be walked 
on, pi[INVESTIGATOR_218238], tripped over or otherwise pulled from the wall  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1172488] Sample  
Subjects will be males and females aged 5 years  of age  and older.  A total 
minimum of 105 subjects will be enrolled with 3 2-52 of those subjects being 
febrile.  For the purpose of this testing, fever is defined as a core 
temperature of 99.5 °F (37.5 °C) or higher.  
3.2.[ADDRESS_1172489] sample size selection is based on the specifications in ISO [ZIP_CODE] -
2-56; 201.102.2: human subject population requirements: “The 
minimum number of subjects in the CLINICAL ACCURACY VALIDATION 
shall not be less than 105” and “ The total number of febrile subjects 
shall be not less than 30% and not greater than 50% of all subjects in 
the selected age group. ”

off-the-shelf calibrated  Welch Allyn SureTemp oral thermometer 
with disposable probe covers .  
2. Each measurement was recorded by [CONTACT_843694].  
3. Each measurement was recorded by a trained techninian.  
3.3.4  Adverse Events Evaluation  
Throughout the four measurement recordings, any reported and/or 
observe d adverse events will be recorded on the CRF and reported 
and dealt with applicably.  
There are no reasonably anticipated adverse eve nts with use of the    
welloStationX infrared thermometer.  
3.3.[ADDRESS_1172496] for whom a febrile temperature measurement (99.5 °F 
(37.5 °C) or higher ) was recorded using the Welch Allyn SureTemp oral

 4.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
4.1   Primary Outcome Measures  
The Primary Outcome Measures for this study are to evaluate:  
 
1. Clinical Accuracy of the welloStationX ; and  
2. Clinical Repeatability of the welloStationX  
4.2   Primary Outcome Analysis  
As per ISO [ZIP_CODE] -2-56, these measures will be recorded and analyzed as 
follows:  
 
1. Clinical Accuracy  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_843695] . 
  
Results will be presented through:  
(i) Descriptive presentation of means and standard de viations  
(ii) Evaluation of agreement calculated as the  clinical bias ( mean bias (±SD) ) 
(iii) Limits of Agreement (LOA) calculations   
(iv) Band -Altman plot created using mean bias and standard deviation data   
(v) XY Plor  and Correlation Coefficient caluclation  
 
2. Repeatability will be calculated using the pooled standard deviations 
formula.  
 
All analyses will be performed and presented by [CONTACT_843696] (febrile and 
afebrile) and by [INVESTIGATOR_16897] (test device compared with refere nce device) , as 
applicable . 
4.3   Study Success Evaluation  
Accuracy and reliability in welloStationX  thermometer readings will be 
demonstrated if there is close agreement between the welloStationX  and 
the reference device (Welch Allyn SureTemp oral thermo meter).  
Additionally , agreement values will be referenced against those attained for 
the prior validation study for the CareGiver thermomete r, with a greement 
values for the welloStationX to be comparable or better to the published 
data  for the Caregiver . This reference is the following:

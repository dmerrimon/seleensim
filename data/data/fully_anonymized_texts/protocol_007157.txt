Spending from the cards was not restricted to food but could be spent on anything and anywhere Visa was accepted. In total, 3,[ADDRESS_667151] outreach to residents by [CONTACT_514797], including food pantry lines, COVID-19 testing lines, and social service agencies. Applications could be submitted online via the city’s website or on paper by [CONTACT_59274][INVESTIGATOR_514795]. In practice, most applications were submitted by [CONTACT_514798], where city staff, equipped with tablets, assisted residents with the application.  Eligibility criteria included: • Resident of Chelsea, [LOCATION_005] • Household income at or below 30% of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Area Median Income The lottery was a weighted lottery. Specifically, a household could receive additional lottery tickets by [CONTACT_378138]:  • No one in the household was currently working • The household was not receiving unemployment insurance • The household was not receiving food assistance (e.g., SNAP benefits) • There was a disabled household member • There was a household member over 65 years of age • There was a household member who was a veteran • There was a household member who was under 6 years of age • There was a household member between the ages of 6 and 17 The total number of lottery tickets per application ranged from 1 to 8. Although it was the city’s intention to restrict households to a single application, some households managed to enter the lottery with more than one application. In these cases, the household still received only a single Chelsea Eats card. Records for the duplicate applicants will be combined into a single record, summing the lottery tickets across the duplicate records to determine the household’s overall probability of winning the lottery. We account for the differential probability of winning the lottery across households in the statistical analysis (see section E.2). Of note, some households never pi[INVESTIGATOR_514796]. The city then gave these unused cards to households from a randomly generated waitlist that was created at the time of random assignment. All waitlisted households ultimately received Chelsea Eats cards and are therefore part of the treatment group. The waitlist households received their cards approximately one month later than the primary lottery winners, but the cards were credited with both the 
[ADDRESS_667152] and second months – so the total payments received by [CONTACT_514799].   D. Data, Study Sample, Outcomes, and Other Variables D.1. Data and Study Samples The two closest emergency departments to the City of Chelsea are Cambridge Health Alliance’s Everett Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_145472]. Participants in the study will be matched to their electronic health record at Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA) and Mass General Brigham (MGB) using a probabilistic algorithm based on name, year of birth, gender, address, and phone number.  There are two additional/secondary study samples. The first will be a subsample of study participants who received their primary care at CHA or MGB at baseline. The second will be children of the participants, identified using address and phone number of the participants as well as dependency relationships available through the electronic health record data.  D.2. Planned Outcomes Outcomes will be assessed on a per-household basis and measured using the electronic health record data over the ten months of the trial.  1. Primary Outcome a. Emergency department use i. We will use the electronic health record data to count visits to the emergency department. Our primary outcome will be assessed on a monthly basis over the duration of the cash benefit and is therefore specified as a frequency variable.  ii. We will also characterize the nature of these visits including by [CONTACT_094]-specified diagnosis categories and whether it resulted in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], as secondary outcomes (see below). iii. Our primary outcome is count-based and not binary (i.e., any versus none) in order to maximize power. To understand general access to emergency department care versus intensity in emergency department use, we will separately assess a dichotomized version of the outcome.  2. Secondary Outcomes a. Emergency department use by [CONTACT_094]-specified categories: i. Behavioral health-related ED visit ii. Substance use disorder-related ED visit iii. Potentially avoidable vs non-avoidable (categorized using the previously validated [LOCATION_001] University algorithm) 
6  iv. Resulting in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] v. As above, we will separately assess count-based and binary versions of these outcomes. b. Outpatient service use i. Outpatient service use includes office visits and other types of outpatient care such as imaging and procedures. We will also assess outpatient service use disaggregated according to type of service (i.e., office visits to primary care, cancer screening tests). ii. As above, we will separately assess count-based and binary versions of these outcomes. c. COVID vaccination i. The first COVID vaccine received emergency use authorization on December 11, 2020. Vaccination status will be a binary variable for having received at least one dose of any COVID vaccine by [CONTACT_514800]. d. Clinical measures: hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, weight, and cholesterol i. These are continuous measures available in the electronic health record. We will use the latest available reading or result during trial period.  ii. Given potential changes in access to care (see outcomes above) that could affect the set of participants for whom we have data for these measures, we have also specified a sensitivity analysis below using the subsample for patients who received their primary care at CHA or MGB at baseline.  D.3. Patient Characteristics The data includes information on participants’ household size, disability status, veteran status, work status, income, receipt of other benefits or assistance, and utilization/spending prior to randomization. These characteristics come from the lottery application form or electronic health records and are assessed prior to randomization. In the event that there are high levels of missingness for any key covariate (i.e., >2%), multiple imputation methods will be used.  E. Statistical Analysis E.1. Evaluation of randomization, balance, and attrition We will test for balance between treatment and control based upon observable baseline characteristics for the overall study population.  Because differential attrition correlated with treatment, for example due to death, could introduce bias into our results, we will also evaluate the attrition rate and assess for balance between treatment and control based upon both baseline characteristics for the final analytic sample (and attritors) and potential causes of attrition.  
7   E.2. Statistical specification Our primary analytic approach is an analysis based on the intent-to-treat principle that compares outcomes for those randomized into the treatment group to those who were randomized into the control group. Specifically, we will estimate the following linear regression model: 𝑦!=𝛽"+𝛽#CASH!+𝛽$𝐗!+𝜖!, where 𝑦! is the utilization or clinical outcome for individual or household 𝑖. See section D.2. for a list of our primary and secondary outcomes. “𝐶𝐴𝑆𝐻!” is an indicator for whether individual 𝑖 won the lottery and was thus randomized into the treatment group. 𝑿𝒊 is a vector of covariates, specifically patient characteristics, including baseline (pre-randomization) values of the outcome variable, which are not explicitly necessary since they should be unrelated to treatment status, but they may increase the precision of our estimates to the extent that they explain some of the variance in the outcome. The coefficient on CASH!, 𝛽#, is our main coefficient of interest; it provides the difference in means between the treatment groups and the control group. In addition to our primary specification above that corresponds to testing for a level shift, we will also include an interaction term between an indicator for time and treatment status to test for changes in slope. As described in section C, a household could receive additional lottery tickets by [CONTACT_514801]. Observations will thus be weighted by [CONTACT_514802] 𝛽# is an unbiased estimate of the relationship between winning the lottery and the outcome. An alternative specification that includes indicators for number of lottery tickets is discussed below. Standard errors will be clustered at the household level and adjusted for heteroskedasticity.   E.3. Subgroup analyses To examine heterogenous effects of the cash benefits, we will repeat our analyses for four pre-specified subgroups, each defined based on data from the pre-randomization period. The subgroups are: (1) chronic disease at baseline, (2) history of acute care utilization, (3) financial distress at baseline, and (4) poor self-reported health at baseline.  Specifically, we use electronic health record data to define participants by [CONTACT_514803] a known chronic disease (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, depression, anxiety) for which she/he/they is prescribed a regular medication. We will also use the electronic health record data to define participants by [CONTACT_514804].  For a subset of the participants, we have baseline survey data that enables subgroup analyses by [CONTACT_514805]-reported health. Financial distress is defined as an affirmative answer on a survey question asking the participant whether she/he/they had any bills, expenses, 
8  or needs that they were unable to pay. Poor self-reported health is defined as a positive screening (score≥3) on the 2-question version of the Patient Health Questionnaire, a positive screening (score≥3) on the 2-question version of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire, or a fair/poor response on the 5-point scale of self-rated health.  E.4. Alternative specifications and sensitivity analyses Our primary specification includes patient characteristics and baseline values of the outcome in the model to improve power as well as any chance imbalance between the study arms after randomization. As described in section E.1., we will compare covariates between the treatment and control groups, and we will explore whether our results are sensitive to inclusion of these covariates in the model. Importantly, our primary specification accounts for differential probability of winning the lottery using inverse probability weights. As an alternative approach, we will include the set of covariates that are correlated with treatment probability into the model, specifically indicators for number of lottery tickets. Finally, as a sensitivity check, we will also conduct our analyses on the subpopulation of participants with established primary care at MGB or CHA at baseline. To ensure our estimates are robust to method of estimation, we will also estimate generalized linear models assuming a negative binomial distribution for the count utilization outcomes and a generalized linear model with a Bournoulli distribution and logit link function for the binary outcomes. In a final robustness check, we will Winsorize the utilization measures to ensure that our estimates are not sensitive to outliers.  E.5.

Cover Sheet for “ Are Bright Lights and Regulated Sleep Times Effective  Treatment for 
Depression ?” (IRB #7361 )  
Overview : This outline is a guide for you to use while considering whether to participate in 
this research study. The conse nt that follows includes much more information about the 
study and its risks, which you will need to make a decision. Please read this outline and the 
consent carefully, and only sign it if you are comfortable doing so.  
● You are being asked to participate in a research treatment study because you are 
depressed.                                                                                                                               
● Your treatment  will involve keepin g specified sleep times and sitting in front of bright lights 
wearing tinted or untinted goggles.  
Type of treatment : The treatment portion of this study will last up [ADDRESS_538558] and physical examination will 
determine whether you are healthy and not pregnant (if you are a fertile female) .  Treatment 
will be with bright lights and specific chang es to your sleep, partially determined by [CONTACT_426267].  The specific timing and manipulation of allowed sleep, bright lights and 
use of goggles will be ra ndomly (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin) determined.  In order to manipulate 
your sleep, varying amounts of time remaining awake between allowed sleep will be  
required, for some patients required wake time might reach as long as [ADDRESS_538559] week you will complete rating forms and speak with a study doctor  by 
[CONTACT_426268] 6 weeks. Thereafter , your study doctor 
will con tinue to treat you for an additional six months during which there will be monthly 
determinations of how you are doing.  During this time, while your study doctor will manage 
your treatment, you or your insurance will pay for any medicine or other treatmen t such as a 
light box.  After this six months, if psychiatric treatment is still needed, your doctor will help 
you find further treatment.  
Alternatives to participation : You do not have to participate in this research study to receive 
treatment for depres sion. If you decide not to participate, the doctor who evaluated you will 
help you find an alternative.  
Risks : There are risks and discomforts associated with participating in this study (please 
read the “Risks” section of the detailed consent for a compl ete listing and explanation of 
risks). These include:                                                                                                               
● Your depression may not improve                                                                                                    
● Bright light can over -stimulate some people and can cause patients with bipolar disorder 
to switch from being depressed to being “high” (that is, hypomanic or manic )                        
● Missing sleep can also over -stimulate and induce switching to a “high” mood                             
Compensation : None                                                                                                  
Voluntary Participation : Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You do not have to 
participate if you do not want to and can stop participating at any time.  

 -1-   23 February 2017                                                                                                                                      IRB #7361 CONSENT FORM Are Bright Lights and Regulated Sleep Times Effective Treatment for Depression?  Purpose and Overview The purpose of this study is to find out whether sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_426252] a bright light wearing goggles is effective treatment for depression.  You are being asked to participate in this study because you are depressed and do not have mood swings (bipolar disorder).  Voluntary Participation in this research study is voluntary. If you decide not to participate, or if you later decide to stop participating, or your doctor removes you from study participation for any reason, you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. A decision not to participate or withdraw your participation will not affect your current or future treatment at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute or Columbia University.  Alternatives to Participation There are alternatives to your participating in this study. If you previously participated in another treatment study, you may be eligible for further treatment without taking part in this study. You can go to a private doctor or to a psychiatry clinic where you may receive any of the medications marketed for depression. Electroconvulsive treatment and focused psychotherapy are also accepted treatments for depression. Electrical stimulation of a nerve in the neck (called the vagus nerve) has also been approved by [CONTACT_1622].  Study Procedures In order to find out if you can be treated in this study, you will receive a complete psychiatric evaluation by a study psychiatrist. If the study psychiatrist decides you can participate, you will be given this consent form to read. If you then agree to participate and are satisfied that your questions have been answered, you will then sign the consent form. A member of the research team will then complete research rating forms, you will complete self-report ratings, about a tablespoon of blood will be drawn for routine laboratory testing (for example, to make sure your kidneys and liver are healthy), a doctor will perform a physical examination (for example, listen to your heart and lungs, look into your eyes) and you will provide a urine specimen (to be checked for kidney function, pregnancy if you are a woman of child-bearing age, and street drugs such as heroin and cocaine). These tests will determine if you have a medical disorder such as low thyroid function that might be the cause of your depression or that should be treated prior to your entry into this study. If you have one of these medical problems, your doctor will discuss this with you at the first visit after it is found, or telephone you if it requires quicker attention.    You have been offered participation in this study because you are depressed.  Once you have agreed to participate and signed the study consent form, you will be asked to answer questions about your mood, prior treatment, the times of the day you like to do things, a variety of common psychiatric symptoms and your interest and functioning in several life circumstances, like work and family.  You will wear an activity monitor (which looks like a wrist watch) and keep a log of your sleep, mood and energy for about seven weeks.  After 1-2 weeks (you can choose to wait up to 30 days before re-evaluation), you will be re-evaluated.  If you remain significantly depressed at this re-evaluation, and remain agreeable, you will begin sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_426253] (regulated sleep therapy) plus sitting in front of bright 

 -2- lights wearing goggles.  The timing of your allowed sleep and which of several types of goggles you will wear will be determined randomly (as if by a flip of a coin). Whatever timing and goggles you are assigned you will continue for the next six weeks, initially with daily telephone evaluations and from the end of week [ADDRESS_538560] back in the tube labeling the time; when all tubes are collected they are stored in the refrigerator until you bring them to the clinic which will have them analyzed for a hormone called melatonin which is directly regulated by [CONTACT_426269].  You will be asked to wear goggles for an hour prior to saliva collection and throughout the two collections.    Light and Regulated Sleep Therapy Treatment will be with bright lights and regulated sleep times.  To help us determine whether this approach is effective treatment and which times for sleep and bright lights and how best to use sleep and bright lights, by [CONTACT_426270].  All will be given specific times they are allowed to sleep and specific times to sit in front of the bright lights.  For some, the specific sleep times may include one or more [ADDRESS_538561] several days.  You will be provided goggles both to wear in the evening during saliva collection for melatonin and when sitting in front of the bright lights.  Prior to being told your specific times for allowed sleep and use of the bright lights, you will complete the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire; your answers will suggest where your biologic clock is currently set and partially determine the times you will be allowed to sleep and instructed to use the bright lights.  You will also report the time you want to be sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_426254].  Risks and Inconveniences General. A general risk is that you may remain depressed. It has not been determined whether the combination of wake therapy, light therapy and regular allowed sleep is effective for your disorder. Second, suicide is a risk in patients who are depressed.  Patients with bipolar disorder may become manic. These risks will be minimized by: (a) exclusion of patients known to have bipolar disorder; (b) not participating in the study if you or your doctor consider you to be at significant risk to harm yourself or in need of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; (c) discontinuing study participation should you become significantly worse or significantly suicidal; (d) offer of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426255]/suicidal thoughts/behavior; (e) weekly visits and [ADDRESS_538562].   Remaining awake for long periods. The major risk of remaining awake for long periods is mania. This possibility will be minimized by [CONTACT_426271] a history of mania or hypomania (a period of being “high” without being manic), constant availability of access to a research psychiatrist by [CONTACT_756].  

 -3- Light Therapy. Patients may become over-stimulated, and those with bipolar disorder may become manic.  As this study will not include patients known to have bipolar disorder, this risk seems minimal, but likely not zero, especially since not all patients with bipolar disorder are known to have it.  More commonly, over-stimulation is described as “like too much coffee” and can be eliminated by [CONTACT_426272], either by [CONTACT_426273], or both.  Occasionally, light exposure may also cause headache, nausea or eye irritation.  Again, these will be counteracted by [CONTACT_426274], decreasing the time you sit at the light or both.  Long-term research studies have found that light therapy is safe for the retina of the eye. Nevertheless, as a precaution, we will examine your retina to see whether there are already signs of damage, and you will not receive light therapy if you have retinal conditions such as retinitis pi[INVESTIGATOR_426256]. As the lights used are similar to early morning light in intensity but without any ultraviolet radiation, they may be considered safer than going outside on a sunny day.  Additional Risks Participation in this study may involve risks that we currently do not know.  Some discomfort may be associated with the drawing of blood samples. A maximum of [ADDRESS_538563] the willingness of some subjects to continue their participation.  Confidentiality All study information is kept in locked cabinets at the Depression Evaluation service at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute or in a secure HIPAA compliant computer accessable only by [CONTACT_464]. Records will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_2371]. Your name [CONTACT_426300]. Any publications will present only group data and not include information that could identify you. Records will be available to research staff, and to Federal, State and Institutional regulatory personnel (who may review records as part of routine audits). Also, you should be aware that there are legal advocacy organizations that have the authority under [LOCATION_001] State law to access otherwise confidential subject records, though they cannot re-disclose this information without the subject’s consent. Electronically stored/transmitted data will be password protected with access only to study personnel.  There are limits to confidentiality. For example:  If your answers indicate a serious problem that may jeopardize your safety or health, then the researchers will contact [CONTACT_426275]-being.  Also, suspected or known neglect or sexual or physical abuse of a child, or threatened violence to self or others will be reported to the appropriate authorities. 

 -4- Study Compensation Medications and tests that are part of the research study are provided free of charge, and neither you nor your insurance company or other third party payer will be billed for these, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], if at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute. Any medications or tests not required by [CONTACT_426276].  In addition, following 6 weeks, regardless of initial treatment assignment, all participants will continue to be followed and complete monthly ratings for an additional six months; during this post-[ADDRESS_538564]-12 week treatment period, should you and your doctor determine that further psychiatric treatment is indicated, your doctor will help you find an appropriate treater.  In Case of Injury Federal regulations require that we inform participants about our institution's policy with regard to compensation and payment for treatment of research-related injuries.  In case of injury, [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute will provide short term emergency medical treatment, which has been determined to be necessary by [CONTACT_209024]'s doctors. In addition, we will provide assistance in arranging follow up care in such instances.  [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute and Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene do not provide compensation or payment for treatment of research related injuries. However, you should be aware that you do not give up your legal right to seek such compensation through the court by [CONTACT_121091].  Questions Your study doctor will answer any questions you may have now or in the future to the best of his/her ability. If you should have additional questions, you can contact [CONTACT_079], Jonathan W. Stewart, M.D., ([PHONE_8866]).  If you have any questions about your rights as a research participant, want to provide feedback, or have a complaint, you may call the NYSPI [CONTACT_26057] (IRB). (An IRB is a committee that protects the rights of participants in research studies). You may call the IRB Main Office at ([PHONE_8867] during regular office hours.  You will be notified of significant new findings that may relate to your willingness to continue to participate.  Women of Child-bearing Age While these treatments are considered to be fairly safe during pregnancy, the study excludes women who are pregnant.  Therefore, a pregnancy test will be performed and if it is positive, you cannot participate.  Also, we ask that you use reasonable precautions not to become pregnant while participating and for a number of weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_426257].  Because the safety of missing a night of sleep, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_426258], you should not be pregnant or become pregnant while using these treatments.  Should you become pregnant, you should immediately contact a study psychiatrist and discontinue any treatment until informed otherwise by a study psychiatrist.

disclose your Health Information for administrative purposes, or operational purposes to 
evaluate the quality of the services you receive.  No authorization is required in these 
circumstances.  Health Information used and disclosed for research requires a special 
authorization from you.   
 
Not all types of uses and releases can possibly be described in this document so we have 
listed some common examples of permitted uses and disclosures below:  
 
FOR RESEARCH:  At NYSPI, we perform mental health and substance abuse research and in 
that process may collect Health Information about you. Our researchers may share your health 
information with other researchers, clinicians, sponsors, regulatory authorities and others if you 
authorize them to do so.  
 
All research conducted at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_426262] a special process required by [CONTACT_426280], including privacy.  We will not use your health 
information or disclose it for research reasons without either getting your prior written approval 
or determining that your privacy is protected.  
 
Health Information about you may be disclosed without authorization to people preparing to 
conduct a research project - for example, to help them look for participants with specific 
medical needs, so long as the health information they review does not leave our facility and the 
project is reviewed by [CONTACT_426281].       
 
FOR TREATMENT:  Caregivers, such as nurses, doctors, psychologists and social workers, 
may use your health information to determine and provide you with treatment.  Individuals and 
programs at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_426263], such as clinical examinations, therapy, laboratory test results, 
medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or transfers or referrals for follow -up care.   
 
FOR PAYMENT:  NYSPI/OMH  may release information about you to your health plan or health 
insurance carrier to obtain payment for our clinical services.  For example, we may need to 
give your health plan information about medications that you received so your health plan will 
pay us for treatment or services we provided.  We may also share your information, when 
appropriate, with other government programs such as Workers’ Compensation, Medicaid, or 
Medicare to determine if you are eligible for, or to coordinate, your benefits, entitlements, and payments.  We may need to disclose a limited amount of information about you to explore your 
financial situation for possible sources of payment for your care, but we will only do so as 
permitted under law.  We may also tell your health plan about a treatment you are going to 
receive to obtain prior approval or to determine whether your plan will cover the treatment.  If 
you are due a refund of money because you have overpaid for our services, we may share a 
limited amount of your information with the NYS Office of the State Comptroller to obtain that 
refund for you.  
 
While the institution does not seek reimbursement from health plans for research services 
there might be instances where the research team might recommend medical services for 
conditions identified during your participation in research. For example, we may need to give 
your health plan information about a clinical exam or medications that you received so your 
health plan will pay for treatment or services that you might need.   
 
FOR OPERATIONS:  NYSPI/OMH may review information about you to ensure that the 
services provided to you are appropriate, safe and are of high quality.  For example, we may 
use your information to evaluate our treatment and service programs or to evaluate the 
services of other providers that use government funds to provide health care services to you.  
We may combine health information about many individuals to research health trends, or 
determine what services and programs should be offered, or whether new treatments or 
services are useful.  We may share your health information with our business partners who 
perform functions on our behalf.  OMH requires that our business partners abide by [CONTACT_426282].

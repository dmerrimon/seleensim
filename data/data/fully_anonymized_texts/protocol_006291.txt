CM00110 Rev A PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
Study Title Urodynamic Feasibility Study (UDS) 
Device Name [CONTACT_395261]® UroLift® System UL400. This device was cleared for 
marketing in the [LOCATION_003] on September 13, 2013. 
The UroLift System is indicated for the treatment of symptoms due to 
urinary outflow obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia 
(BPH), including lateral and median lobe hyperplasia in men 45 years of 
age or older.    
Study Goals  To prospectively collect urodynamic data prior to, and [ADDRESS_496592] of the PUL procedure on prostatic obstruction, bladder 
health and other urodynamic parameters.  
 To obtain evidence which may support the design of an 
expanded study. 
Subject Population 10 to 20 males over the age of 45, diagnosed with symptomatic benign 
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and intended for PUL procedure with the 
UroLift System will be enrolled at a single center. 
Since this is the first study to assess the impact of PUL procedure using 
pressure flow studies, the population is planned to be similar to the 
population studied in the LIFT Study.  
Study Design This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, single-center study. 
This is the first exploratory study of the impact of PUL as measured by 
[CONTACT_395252] (UDS). UDS will be performed at 
screening and at the 3-month follow-up visits. UDS will include an 
assessment of obstruction and bladder health as measured by [CONTACT_395253] 
(maximum urinary flow rate) and Pdet (detrusor pressure) at Qmax, 
and Pdetmax (maximum voiding pressure), as well as capturing all 
other standard urodynamic parameters. UroCuff as an alternative form 
of urodynamics testing will be an optional test performance at baseline 
and at 3M follow-up.  
In addition, standard BPH measures such as symptoms, qualify of life, 
uroflowmetry and post void residual will be evaluated at the follow-up 
visits. The analysis of the 3-month data is intended to evaluate the 
possibility of expanding the scope of the study. There will be no formal 
hypothesis testing.

performed at screening and the 3-month follow-up visits and will include an assessment of 
obstruction and bladder health as measured by [CONTACT_395256]@Qmax, and by [CONTACT_395257], and

In addition, standard BPH measures such as symptoms, qualify of life, uroflowmetry, and post

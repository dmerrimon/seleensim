Primary Endpoint:  30-day mortality  
I. Specific Aims  
Resuscitation strategies for the acutely injured patient in hemorrhagic shock have evolved.  
Patients benefit from receiving less crystalloid and early red blood cell transfusion with balanced ratios of plasma and platelets.
1-3 These resuscitation practices are termed Damage Control 
Resuscitation and are incorporated into massive transfusion protocols in level 1 trauma centers 
across the country.2-4 This reconstituted strategy has also been coined ‘whole blood- like’ 
resuscitation despi[INVESTIGATOR_507418].5,[ADDRESS_654906] hours 
following trauma center  arrival , underscoring the importance of early interventions which 
provide benefit.1-3,7 Due to the time sensitive nature of the treatment of hemorrhage, the ideal 
resuscitation intervention would entail use of blood products containing all essential hemostatic 
 6  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23/[ADDRESS_654907] to time of injury,  and mitigation  of the devastating 
downstream consequences of shock and coagulopathy.  
     Whole blood transfusion following traumatic injury represents the ‘essential next step’ for the management of hemorrhagic shock post -injury. Prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507419], at a time before 
hemorrhagic shock and coagulopathy begin to have their detrimental consequences. We 
hypothesize that the initiation of whole blood resuscitation in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507420] -injury as 
compared to standard prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507421]. Thus, a large pragmatic clinical trial is needed to definitively establish the efficacy and safety of whole blood resuscitation initiated in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. Only a high- quality clinical trial will provide the evidence to justify the 
use of this limited resource early post -injury.  
     Whole blood is a precious resource. The shelf life of the whole blood product depends on separation procedures and ranges from 21 to 35 days. The storage of whole blood leads to platelet dysfunction, cell lysis, and release of potassium and free heme which may reduce the resuscitative capacity of whole blood or contribute to end organ injury. The safety and efficacy of whole blood as a resuscitation fluid as it approaches its shelf life remains poorly characterized. The aims of the current Type O Whole  blood and assessment of Age during prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507409] (TOWAR) trial are to determine the efficacy and safety of whole blood resuscitation as compared to standard care resuscitation in patients at risk of hemorrhagic shock and to appropriately chara cterize the hemostatic competency of whole blood relative to its age.  
      
AIM#1 : Determine whether prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507422] 30- day mortality in patients at risk of hemorrhagic 
shock. AIM#2 : Determine whether old prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507413] (age > 14 days) as compared to young 
prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507413] (age ≤ 14 days) is associated with equivalent clinical outcomes, hemostasis, prevention of coagulopathy, and platelet function in patients at risk of hemorrhagic shock. AIM# 3: Determine whether prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507423], blood and blood component transfusion requirements, lower incidence of coagulopathy, and improved hemostatic a nd platelet 
function in patients at risk of hemorrhagic shock.

     A recent secondary analysis from the PAMPer  
trial demonstrated that patients who received both 
plasma and red cells  (an independent predictor of 
mortality in the cohort)  in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885] , 
had the best adjusted survival. Patients receiving   
crystalloid resuscitation only, had the highest 
mortality.13 (Figure 2 .) 
     We hypothesize that the initiation of low titer 
whole blood (LTWB O) resuscitation in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507424] -injury as 
compared to standard prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507421]. A large pragmatic clinical trial is needed to definitively establish the efficacy and safety of whole blood resuscitation initiated in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507425] a function of storage time. Only a high- quality clinical trial will provide the  evidence to justify 
the use of this precious blood banking resource early post -injury.  
 
Study Design/Setting : The current proposed trial will be a 6- year (4 -year enrollment), multi-
center, open label, prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507415] 10 level -1 trauma centers from within 
the LITES network and will enroll approximately 1020 patients. The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_507426].

Study Intervention
: Two units of low titer whole blood, group O (LTWB O) will be collected 
using local site approved blood banking protocols and will be stored at each respective EMS 
base or stocking facility for each EMS unit/service. Low titer will be defined as anti -A and anti-
B antibody titers <256 and only units meeting this threshold or lower will be issued for prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507431]. Whole blood will be collected and kept to either 21 days or 35 days based upon which preservation process is employed a t each respective participating site (CPD -21 days 
shelf life, CPDA -1-35 days shelf life).  
 
Study Intervention Arm : Patients  will receive up to two units of whole blood as collected by [CONTACT_507488] 1- [ADDRESS_654910] Care Arm : Patients will receive prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507432]/service once all 
inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria are met. Once the patient arrives at a part icipating site 
and prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507433], patients will receive standard in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507434].  
 
Randomization and Masking : A single stage cluster randomization scheme will be utilized. 
Participating EMS services/agencies at each site will follow  a fixed randomization approach of 
(LTWB O), (LTWB O), (Standard Care), with the initial treatment being randomly assigned.  
Thus an EMS service/agency will be randomly assigned to one of three three -month repeated 
 9  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23 /202 2 sequences: (1) LTWB O), (LTWB O), (Standard Care); (2) LTWB O), (Standard Care), (LTWB 
O); and (3) (Standard Care), LTWB O), (LTWB O)  
 Communication with the blood bank transportation services and each respective air base or EMS unit/service will occur and an annual schedule of randomization assignment will be distributed to each study site and respective EMS base/service. This specific r andomization scheme is required 
due to the limited supply, goal of minimization of wastage of LTWB O, and the logistics and delivery of the intervention in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. The proposed trial will be an open label trial as blood product transfusion requires appropriate documentation and essential look back procedures.  
III. Outcomes  
 
Primary Outcome : The primary outcome for the clinical trial will be all cause 30 -day mortality.  
 
30-day mortality will be checked by [CONTACT_507489]. If there is no response from the patient, 30- day mortality  will be checked by [CONTACT_507490].  
Secondary Outcomes : Our principal secondary outcome for the trial will be age of whole 
blood and its association with all primary and additional secondary outcomes. Additional 
secondary outcomes for the proposal will include 3-hour mortality, 6- hour mortality, 24-hour 
mortality,  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], death from hemorrhage, death from brain injury, blood and blood 
component transfusion requirements in the initial 24 hours, incidence of Multiple Organ Failure (MOF ), incidence of nosocomial infection, incidence of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] 
(ARDS), time to hemostasis, incidence of coagulopathy by [CONTACT_506083], incidence of allergic/transfusion reaction and measurements of platelet and overall patient hemostatic function. 
 
Secondary Outcome Definitions : 
 
Age of whole blood: Age of the LTWB O  blood products transfused will be recorded as 
designated by [CONTACT_507491]. Based upon the separation procedures utilized at the respective blood bank, LTWB O units will have a defined maximum shelf life out to [ADDRESS_654911] site-specific protocols will be utilized for this. When the age of 2 units of LTWB O are disparate, an average age of LTWB O transfusion will be calculated.  We 
will stratify Age of LTWB O into YOUNG (1 -14 days) and OLD (>14 days). We will 
similarly bin age or average age of LTWB O by [CONTACT_5875] (1-7days), (8-14days), (15-21days), (22-28days), and > 28 days and allow comparison across all primary and 
secondary outcomes.  
 
3-hour, 6-hour, 24-hour, and In -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380]:  3-hour, 6-hour, 24-hour, and  in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507435]. Over the first 
 10  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23 /[ADDRESS_654912] 24-hour period.  
Time to death:   Time to death will be based on the documented and recorded time of 
death  in days from arrival.  Those surviving up to 30-days post enrollment will be 
censored.    
 
Mortality from hemorrhage and brain injury : Cause of death will be adjudicated by a 
site investigator  
 
Twenty four -hour blood and blood component transfusion requirements:  24-hour 
blood and blood component transfusion requirements will be determined by [CONTACT_507492], the number of units transfused, and the time of transfusion. Any initiation of blood transfusion will be considered completed. 
 
Multiple Organ Failure (MOF):  Organ dysfunction will be evaluated via the Denver 
Post-injury Multiple Organ Failure Score, a well-validated scoring system in injured patients and characterized as an incidence rate (%) and as MOF free days.
14,[ADDRESS_654913] scores of each of the individual systems. A summary Denver score > [ADDRESS_654914] .
15  
 
Nosocomial Infection ( NI): The CDC criteria for the diagnosis of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507436] (www.cdc.gov/nhsn) and recorded over 30 days. 
 
Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053] (ARDS ): The Berlin definition for mild ARDS 
(PaO 2/FIO 2, ≤ 300 mm Hg + timing, imaging and origin criteria) will be utilized as a 
threshold value to determine the incidence of ARDS and will be further stratified into Moderate (PaO
2/FIO 2, ≤ 200 mm Hg) and Severe (PaO 2/FIO 2, ≤ 100 mm Hg).16 
 
Coagulation parameters:  During the first 60 minutes from arrival to the TOWAR trial 
site, blood for PT, INR and point of care rapid- TEG or conventional TEG analysis will be 
obtained. These measurements will be repeated as close to 24 hours ( +/- 12 hours) from 
the time of arrival as feasible, to coordinate with other lab draws and staffing patterns. For those sites with rapid TEG capabilities, tissue factor will be added to a citrated whole blood collection tube and rapid TEG parameters including activated clotting time (ACT, seconds or R time ), angle (α, degrees), coagulation time (K, seconds), maximum 
amplitude (MA, mm), clot strength (G, dynes/cm
2), and estimated percent lysis (LY30, 
%) will be measured for each patient.  
 
 11  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23 /202 2 Time to hemostasis : The time to hemostasis outcome variable will be determined by [CONTACT_507493] a nadir transfusion requirement of [ADDRESS_654915] 4 hours, the patient will be designated a ‘non- hemostasis’ patient.  
 
Allergic/Transfusion reaction : Any transfusion complication in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507437]. As the intervention is specific to the early phase of care setting and since transfusion complications are temporally related to the specific transfusion, all transfusion related co mplications will be assessed during the initial 24 hours from the 
time of administration and recorded.  
 
Platelet Function:  We will assess platelet activation, aggregation, and adhesion to 
monitor the changes in platelet activity in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_507438] . Blood will be collected within 60 minutes of 
arrival to the TOWAR site when feasible and analyzed for aggregation via whole blood aggregometry using low dose collagen (2ug) as a stimulus. In addition, all patients will receive TEG (6s or 5000, depending on site availability) with platelet mappi[INVESTIGATOR_507439] (AA) stimulation. Additionally, a rTEG will be run and the MA recorded. Collectively, the TEG with platelet mappi[INVESTIGATOR_507440], predominantly driven by [CONTACT_507494]. In a subset of patients presenting at centers with appropriate analytical capabilities, we will assess platelet activation via  flow cytometry analysis for P- selectin 
expression (CD62p) as well as perform flow based microfluidic assays across collagen impregnated slides to assess for platelet adhesion under flow based conditions. Finally, due to the evolving importance of platelet extracellular vesicles in hemostasis and inflammation, when feasible we will perform size exclusion chromatography to isolate and characterize EVs from platelets collected from patients and utilize nanoparticle tracking analysis (Nanosight) to quantify the presence of EVs . 
17,18 
 
Classification of Mortality : Classification  of the underlying mechanisms responsible for 
mortality are essential to appropriately characterize regional variation and preventable morbidity and mortality. Classification of mortality outcomes will be assigned at the level of the enrolling institution by [CONTACT_355090] . A predefined list of mortality classifications will 
be provided and adjudicated upon at the site level and will include  1) Hemorrhage/Exsanguination, 2) TBI/herniation, 3) Multisystem Organ Failure, 4) Sepsis, 5) ARDS, 6) Coagulopathy, 7) Cardiac Arrest with 1-6, 8) Pulmonary Embolism, 9) Withdrawal of Care as well as other pertinent causes of injury related death.  
 
Predefined Subgroups : Predefined subset analyses for the trial will be performed looking at 1) 
Patients who ultimately did or did not required in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507441]; 2) Patients with and without significant traumatic brain injury (Head abbreviated injury scale- AIS >2 excluding cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_507442]); 3) Patients arrived from the scene of injury versus those brought from a referr al hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]; 4) Patients who ultimately did or did not require massive 
transfusion (≥ [ADDRESS_654916] 24 hours); 5) Patients who received leukocyte reduced 
 12  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23/202 2 whole blood versus those who did not; 6) Patients who had severe prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_392130] (SBP 
<70mmHg) versus those who did not; 7) Patients who required operative intervention in first 24 hours versus those who did not ; 8) age, 9) sex; 10) race; 11) trauma center; and 12) service . It 
is recognized that the study is not appropriately powered for these subgroup comparisons and the results and conclusions formulated from these subgroup analyses will be considered exploratory 
in nature and will not be used as a basis for treatment recommendations.   Please note that some 
of the planned subgroup analyses involve post -randomization factors.  In these instances , 
mediation analyses will be carried out.    
 
IV. Screening and Enrollment  
 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed based on available information at the time of enrollment in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_84365]. Although all reasonable efforts will be made by [CONTACT_507495], due to the nature of the emergency pre- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885], there may be occasions where the EMS crew must 
rely on verbal report of inclusion criteria, including qualifying vitals, from the referring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_392164]. In these instances, if, after subsequent review of outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491]/ or ground 
crew documentation, it is determined that the subject did not meet inclusion criteria and/or met exclusion criteria, the subject will remain enrolled in the study based on the intention- to-treat 
principle.  
In the event that a verbal report must be used in lieu of physical documentation or directly 
witnessing the qualifying vitals, documentation of the verbal report will serve as the source documentation for determining eligibility. Verbal reports will be doc umented in the emergency  
medical record and will detail the information reported and by [CONTACT_20898].  
 Study participants will be randomly assigned to either LTWB or standard of care based on a cluster randomized design. Patients will be randomly assigned by [CONTACT_507496] (one -month time interval) or LTWB (two -month time interval).  
 Subjects will undergo initial blood sampling for our secondary outcomes of interest  during the 
first 60 minutes from arrival to the TOWAR trial site. A  point of care rapid or conventional 
thromboelastography (TEG)  will be  performed for coagulation parameter measurements as close 
to arrival as possible and as close to 24  hours as possible (+/ - 12 hours) when clinical care 
allows.  
V. Potential Risks and Benefits  
Potential Risks 
Risks Associated with LTWB: The whole blood product to be utilized starting in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507443] [ADDRESS_654917] 45 months. The primary risks with any blood transfusion can be found in the Circular of Information prepared jointly by [CONTACT_507497], the American Red Cross, America’s Blood Centers, and the Armed Services B lood 
Program. Those primary acute immunologic complications include hemolytic transfusion 
 13  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23 /202 2 reactions, immune mediated platelet destruction, febrile nonhemolytic reactions, allergic 
reactions, anaphylactoid reactions and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). Delayed immunologic complications include delayed hemolytic reaction, alloimmunization, posttransfusion purpura, and transfusion- associated graft -vs-host disease. Nonimmunologic 
complications include transmission of infectious agents, bacterial sepsis, transfusion- associated 
circulatory overload (TACO), hypothermia, and metabolic comp lications.  
 The intervention product is group O  LTWB. A risk associated with transfusion of Rh+ blood in a woman of child- bearing age i s hemolytic disease of the fetus  during a future pregnancy. 
Complications of this disease include fetal anemia, fetal hydrops, and in the most severe cases, fetal death. However, the overall risk of poor fetal outcome in a future pregnancy for Rh- women that are administered Rh+ blood has been estimated to be less than 0.5%.
19 Importantly, the 
incidence of a female being Rh - is 10-15%. The majority of women injured have no risk of Rh 
mismatch. For those that are at risk, the likelihood of poor fetal outcome in a future pregnancy is small.  Importantly, an FDA approved EFIC pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507444]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], LTWB 
randomized trial (PPOWER IND #[ZIP_CODE]) randomized  group O RH+ LTWB and included 
women of childbearing age due to this low inherent risk.  Women of childbearing potential who receive O+ whole blood resuscitation and are determined to be Rh- will be notified and counseled following standard blood banking and trauma service guidelines. 
 
Potential Benefits /Safety  
The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_507445] [ADDRESS_654918] 
also executed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_507446]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], LTWB randomized trial (PPOWER IND 
#[ZIP_CODE]) with one of the primary outcomes being feasibility. The experience from this NIH funded pi[INVESTIGATOR_507447]- center trial.  
  
VI. Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
Analysis for Trial Clinical Outcomes :  
 
AIM#1 Analysis : Determine whether prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507422] 30-day mortality in patients at risk of hemorrhagic 
shock. 
 
 14  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23 /[ADDRESS_654919] for differences between the proportions. For continuous characteristics, means (medians) and standard deviations (interquartile ranges) will be calculated and t-tests (Wilcoxon) will be us ed to compare the means (distributions) between treatment arms.  
 For the primary trial outcome, an indicator of death within [ADDRESS_654920] will be carried out for the pre-defined subgroups. Regression models appropriate for the outcome variable (e.g., mixed effect logistic regression for binary outcome variables) will be used to test for the homogeneity of the treatment effect. Main effects will be included in the model for treatment, the indicator of the subgroup and the two-way interaction between treatment and subgroup. If a statistically significant interaction is observed, we will reject the null hypothesis of a homogenous treatment effect.   
AIM#2  Analysis : Determine whether prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507448] (age > 14 days) as compared 
to young whole blood (age ≤ 14 days) is associated with similar clinical outcomes, hemostasis, 
prevention of coagulopathy, and platelet function in patients at risk of hemorrhagic shock. 
The analysis will begin by [CONTACT_507498]; whole blood age ≤ 14 days  versus 
whole blood age > [ADDRESS_654921] for differences between the proportions. For continuous characteristics, means (medians) and standard deviations (interquartile ranges) will be calculated and t-tests (Wilcoxon) will be used to compare the means (distributions) between treatment arms.  
 An unadjusted analysis comparing the 30-day mortality rate by [CONTACT_507499] a chi-square test. Additionally, because of the observational nature of the study, a propensity adjusted analysis will be carried out to control for potential confounders (including biological sex, TBI, etc.). A generalized boosted regression model (GBM) will be used to generate a propensity score for each participant indicating the probability of receiving young whole blood. The GBM approach will be used to identify important characteristics that will be 
used to estimate the propensity scores. From this approach, a propensity score, 𝑝𝑝(𝑥𝑥), indicating 
the probability of receiving young whole blood given the observed characteristics will be 
obtained for each subject.  
 
We will use the Toolkit for Weighting and Analysis of Nonequivalent Groups (twang) software package and the SAS/Stata macros (http://www.rand.org/statistics/twang/downloads.html) to estimate and evaluate the propensity scores. We will estimate the propensity score for each 
 15  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23/[ADDRESS_654922] by [CONTACT_507500]  (dichotomous) or mnps (multinomial). That i s, 
GBM will fit separate GBMs to each dummy treatment indicator to estimate the propensity score 
for the given phenotype. We will consider all the subject characteristics when fitting GBM. The GBM approach will select which characteristics to include and t he best functional form including 
interactions. If missing data is present for the subject characteristics, twang will attempt to 
construct weights that also balance rates of missingness by [CONTACT_507501].  
 
The maximum number of iterations for the GBM approach will be set to the default (i.e.[ZIP_CODE]). 
The optimal number of iterations will be selected as the one that minimizes the balance statistics of interest. We will use the balance statistics es.mean and ks. mean. The es.mean uses the 
absolute standardized bias (also referred as the effect size or absolute standardized mean difference) and summarizes across variables, and the ks.mean uses the KS statistic to assess balances and summarizes across variables. We will allow a maximum of three splits for each tree in the model, allowing for three -way interactions between all covariates to be considered. The 
shrinkage parameter will be set to 0.0005 to ensure a smooth fit. The tuning parameters involved in the GBM mo dels will be adjusted if necessary, until covariate balance is achieved.  
 
To evaluate the model, we will plot the balance statistics as a function of the number of iterations (higher iterations correspond to more complicated fitted models). If more iterations are needed, we will increase the number of iterations. Balance tables and plots will be generated to assess balance. Multiple pairwise sets of balance metrics will be evaluated. We will use the ES and the KS as balance metrics to assess whether the groups are balanced with respect to the observed baseline and pre -treatment c haracteristics. For the ES metric, a value under 0.20 is indicative of 
good balance. For the KS metric, a value under 0.10 will be indicative of good balance, but p-values will also be evaluated. T he GBM fit (es.mean or ks.mean) that provides the best balance 
and yields the largest effective sample size will be preferred (McCaffrey et al., 2013) . We will 
also plot the propensity score values using boxplots to compare the distributions and to evaluate the common support. Ideally, the propensity score distributions will overlap entirely; however, if there are areas of substantial non -overlap, we will discard subjects in those areas to increase 
generalizability. We will use a 1 -dimensional function of the propensity score, referred to as the 
sensitivity functio n (SF), to quantify the hidden bias due to unmeasured confounders.  
 Variables in the GBM will include demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and site. A mixed -effects log -binomial regression model will then be used to estimate the independent 
effect of receiving young whole blood on 30- day mortality. The mi xed effects log -binomial 
regression model will include an indicator of 30 -day mortality as the dependent variable and 
indicator of the age of whole blood as the independent variable, with the propensity scores used as an inverse probability weight.   A similar approach will be taken for the secondary outcomes, though the analytic approach may vary based on the distribution of the outcome. For example, for a continuous secondary outcome (e.g., clotting time parameters); a mixed -effects linear regression  model to estimate the 
independent effect of the age of whole blood on the outcome. For time to event outcomes (e.g., time to death ), Kaplan -Meier curves will be generated for each treatment group and a log -rank 
test will be used to compare the distributio n of the cumulative proportion. Observations will be 
censored at 30 days after arrival.

transfusion requirements, lower incidence of coagulopathy, and improved hemostatic and platelet 
function in patients at risk of hemorrhagic shock.  
 
The analysis of the secondary outcome will mirror the analytic approach for Aim 2. The analytic approach for other binary outcomes (e.g., 6- hour mortality) will be identical as those for the 
primary anal ysis. For continuous outcomes (e.g., 24-hour blood and component transfusion 
requirements), a mixed effect regression model will be used to determine if the average number of units transfused between the two treatment groups differ. For time to event outcomes (e.g., time to hemostasis), Kaplan -Meier curves w ill be generated for each treatment group and a log-
rank test will be used to compare the distribution of the cumulative proportion.

Sample Size Justification and Power Analysis: The sample size calculations are based on the 
primary outcome, 30- day mortality, for Aim [ADDRESS_654924] a difference in the 30- day mortality 
rate of 26% vs. 16% (based on data from the PAMPer study), assuming 80% power, a type I 
error rate of 0.05, a two-sided alternative hypothesis, and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.02, as was observed in the PAMPer study.
[ADDRESS_654925]  on the 
size of the sample needed. If the ICC is smaller  (e.g., 0.01 would require a sample size of 300 per 
arm), fewer people will be needed.  However, if it is larger, more will be needed  (e.g., 0.05 
would require a sample size of 680 per arm).   
 Using a 2:1 random allocation of study participants to LTWB:standard of care, and enduring that  there are [ADDRESS_654926] care arm, will lead to a total sample size of 1020, with 
680 participants receiving LTWB. Assuming that 60% of these participants will receive whole 
blood ≤ 14 days in age and 40% will receive whole blood > [ADDRESS_654927] of proportions there will be 80% power to detect a higher mortality rate of 22.6% among those receiving whole blood over 14 days old, assuming a 30- day mortality rate of 1 4% among 
those receiving whole blood ≤  14 days, a type 1 error of 0.05 and a two -sided alternative 
hypothesis (that whole blood > 14 days in age has a worse outcome than whole blood ≤ 14 days) vs. the null hypothesis that whole blood > 14 days is the same or better than whole blood ≤ 14 days).  
Randomization of Ineligible Subjects : It is anticipated that there will be a small proportion of 
patients enrolled who receive whole blood or standard care that in retrospect will not have met 
the entry criteria and are thus ineligible. In this circumstance, patients will be analyzed according to the group to which they were randomized. Subgroup analyses based on eligibility criteria will be performed if the number of patients so affected is large. However, based on the relatively 
 17  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23 /202 2 limited inclusion and exclusion criteria it is anticipated that the frequency of this event will be 
low.    
Missing Data:  Consistent with the intention -to-treat principle, the analysis methods used to 
analyze the primary outcome include all patients according to their assigned intervention.  Baseline characteristics of patients with missing outcome data will be compared. Miss ing 
primary outcome data will be imputed.  Based on data from PAMPer, it is anticipated that the missing data rate will be less than 5%.
12   
 
Non-adherence : In some circumstances, patients may receive standard care instead of the 
whole blood intervention when randomized to whole blood. Non-adherence is most likely to occur in the case of the patient who requires urgent care in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507449]. Fortunately, this event is relatively rare. In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_392216]- to-treat analytic design, these patients will be analyzed with 
the group to which they were randomized.  
Interim Analyses : In concert with the DSMB, prior to initiation of the trial, the final monitoring 
plan will be developed to serve as the guide to the DSMB’s decision-making process concerning early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84953]. In making the decision to recommend termination of the study, the DSMB shall be guided by [CONTACT_392339]: (i) a formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_392235], (ii) information on safety outcomes by [CONTACT_1570], (iii) consistency between results for primary and secondary outcomes, and (iv) consistency of treatment effects across subgroups. 
We have designed this trial with two -interim looks before the final analysis. The groups 
sequential approach of Lan and DeMets  using the O'Brien-Fleming spending function will be 
used to determine the type I error boundaries for each analysis. The selection of the Lan and 
DeMets approach permits flexibility with respect to the number of interim analyses. Two formal interim analys es of efficacy will be performed when 33% and 67% of the enrolled participants 
reach the assessment of the primary endpoint (30 days after injury). The level of significance will maintain an overall p value of 0.05 according to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_507450] a p value of 0.038;  two sided, for the final analysis with a final z-value of 1.993.  
The DSMB may recommend termination of the trial if  the results of the interim analysis are 
unlikely to change after accruing more patients based on conditional power. Conditional power is 
defined as the approach that quantifies the statistical power to yield an answer different from that 
seen at the inter im analysis. If this quantity is small, then the DSMB may conclude that it would 
be futile to continue with the investigation. 
 
Data Sources : Data will be collected prospectively as patient care progresses. This will include 
a review of the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507451](s), Emergency Department  and electronic/paper hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097].  
 
Data Entry : The DCC will create web -based HTML forms to collect necessary information from 
all participating sites. Web entry forms will have dynamic features such as edit and data type checks. Details and clarification about data items will be provided using pop-up windows. Data 
 18  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23 /202 2 encryption and authentication methods will be used. Additional features will be built into the 
web entry forms including: forms transmission history, access to past forms, tracking of data corrections, and the capability to save and re-load incomplete form s. The subjects will be 
identified by a study number only. All clinical interventions will become part of the patient’s medical records including platelet transfusion. All hard copy source documentation will be kept in a secured, locked cabinet in the site’s research coordinator’ s office. All study documents will 
be maintained in a secure location for the time frame designated by [CONTACT_133032] ’s 
requirements. The electronic data will be entered and maintained on a password protected SSL website designed for this trial.  
 The data entered for the TOWAR  trial will be maintained by [CONTACT_507502] a relational database. 
The database would be housed in a virtual environment so in the event of a hardware failure it would migrate to a new host. The data will be backed on a regular schedule with full transaction log files in use and copi[INVESTIGATOR_507452] a secure service. In addition to the data server, the production web server will also be backed up routinely and as a virtual machine can be transitioned to di fferent hardware automatically in case of hardware failure. All 
Servers are behind an enterprise firewall and access has to be granted through the firewall even within the University Network.    
Database Management : A two -tiered database structure will be created. A front -end database 
will serve the web entry needs, using a database management system well -suited to handling 
updates from multiple interactive users. The data from this database will be transferred on a regular schedule to a data repository that can be used by [CONTACT_108250]. This 
database will be kept as needed, e.g. for quarterly performance reports. Access to data will be limited to those who need access to perform their tasks . The database management system is able 
to manage large quantities of data, to merge data from multiple databases as required, to handle complex and possibly changing relationships, and to produce analysis datasets that can be imported into a variety of statistical analysis packages.  
 
Surveillance for Outcomes and Data Elements : Data will be collected prospectively as patient  
care progresses. This will include a review of prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507451](s), Emergency Department and electronic/paper hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097].   
Prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507453]- Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507454]:  Demographics, shock severity (base deficit, lactate), 
injury characteristics, Prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507455], interventions (intubation, chest tubes), injury severity, operative interventions and timing of interventions, injury severity score, ICU days, ventilator days, length of stay, multiple organ dysfunction scores (daily), nosocomial infectious outcomes, blood gas results, radiography reads, transfusion of blood and blood components, resuscitation requirements, all primary and secondary outcomes will be recorded. 
 
VII. Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC)  
 
Clinical Coordination specific for the TOWAR study will be performed by [CONTACT_355091] (Multidisciplinary Acute Care Research Organization) and the dedicated research teams at the 
 19  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23/202 2 University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], including all regulatory requirements, provider and coordinator training 
and monitoring.  
VIII. Data Coordinating Center (DCC)  
 
Data Coordination specific for the TOWAR study will be performed by [CONTACT_507503]. 
Wisniewski at the Graduate School of Public Health at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]. The DCC 
will coordinate all data collection and entry, management, security and confidentiality, data 
archiving, quality control and electronic medical record biomedical informatics as needed, as well as plan, coordinate and assist with all statistical analyses  
IX. Human Subjects  
 
We anticipate that this study will be conducted under the federal provisions governing Exception 
from the Requirement for Informed Consent for Emergency Research, including community consultation, public notification, as well as notification of patients or their legally -authorized 
representative as soon as feasible after enrollment. The latter shall include provision of an 
opportunity to opt out from ongoing participation that will be given through oral and written communication.  Community consultation as determined by [CONTACT_507504]. We will utilize a central IRB at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]. Since the population eligible for enrollment includes all citizens in the study regions it will not be possible to target any particular smal l group. Feedback from the community will be obtained by [CONTACT_507505]. If requested, bracelets will be made available that could be wo rn by [CONTACT_507506]. 
Public notification and community consultation will be performed as directed by [CONTACT_507507], targeted small group meetings or consultation with community leaders. Due to ongoing participation in numerous multicenter research studies involving emergency research, our insti tution and the 
other participating institutions have significant experience with community consultation and notification practices.  
 
Institutional Review Board : A central IRB will be utilized at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_507456]. All current LITES Network sites have IRBs which have experience and engagement with central IRB procedures.  
 
Training and Participating Site Coordination : As the clinical coordinating center for the trial, 
the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] (MACRO) at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_507457], provider training and sample collection and storage. Research coordinators, providers and associated staff will be trained during the months prior to the trial start date regarding  the scientific basis for the study, specific inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, sample coll ection and processing, study procedures and SOPs, and rapid TEG 
performance. Training verification and retraining will occur if new staff is hired at individual participating sites. Trial enrollment and maintenance of data integrity will be assessed using the 
 20  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23/[ADDRESS_654928] medical occurrence associated with the use of the drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
      b. Adverse reaction means  any adverse event caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a 
subset of all suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
c. Suspected adverse reaction  means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than “adverse reaction”  
d. Reasonable possibility. For the purpose of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
e. Unexpected adverse event/reaction  refers to an event/reaction that is not consistent with 
the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the IND application. f. Life -threatening, suspected adverse reaction. A suspected adverse reaction is considered 
“life-threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator (i.e., the study site principal 
investigator) or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or research subject at immediate risk of death. It does not i nclude a suspected adverse reaction that , had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
f. Serious, suspected adverse reaction. A suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of the Investigator (i.e., the study site principal investigator) or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse reaction, inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31007], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
g. Reportable non- compliance refers to a failure on the part of the investigator or study team 
member to follow the terms of the IRB approved protocol or abide by [CONTACT_115155], that adversely affect the rights and welfare of subjects or significantly compromises the quality of the research data. Incidents of non- compliance on the part of the  
subject are not considered reportable.  
h. Unanticipated Problem Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]) refers to any accident, experience, or outcome that meets the following criteria: unexpected in terms of nature, severity or frequency; related, or possibly related, to a subject’s participation in research; and places subjects or others at greater risk of  harm (including physical, economic, 
or social) than was previously known or recognized. 
 
Assessing and Reporting Adverse Events (AEs)  and Non -compliance : Adverse events will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_507508]. Investigators and study team will determine if any  related adverse events  occur during the period from 
 21  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23 /202 2 enrollment through study participation termination. If reportable adverse events  occur, they will 
be recorded on the adverse event case report form  in the electronic data capture system , which 
will be submitted to the  Coordinating Center . All reported adverse events  will be classified by: a) 
Severity ( fatal or life -threatening, serious, or non-serious); and b) Expected vs. Unexpected. 
Please refer to the table below for timelines for reporting.  
 
This study population is expected to have a large number of serious adverse events, including 
death from trauma related injuries . Expected  adverse events that are related or possibly related to 
the intervention will be documented and reviewed for changes in nature, severity, or frequency across the study population.

Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) : A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be 
created to review this study and provide recommendations re. study continuation to the IND 
Sponsor. After initial approval and at periodic intervals (to be determined by [CONTACT_942]) during the course of the study, the DSMB responsibilities are to:  
a. Review the research protocol, informed consent documents and plans for data and safety monitoring; b. Evaluate the progress of the study, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, adverse events, unanticipated problems, performance of the trial sites, and other factors that can affect study outcome; c. Consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the 
 22  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23/202 2 participants or the ethics of the study;  
d. Review clinical center performance, make recommendations and assist in the resolution 
of problems reported by [CONTACT_507509];  
e. Protect the safety of the study participants;  
f. Report on the safety and progress of the study;  
g. Make recommendations to the IND Sponsor, and if required, to the FDA concerning 
continuation, termination or other modifications of the study based on the observed 
beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under study;  
h. Monitor the confidentiality of the study data and the results of monitoring;  i. Assist the IND Sponsor by [CONTACT_57018], enrollment, sample size and/or data collection.  
j. The DSMB will include experts in emergency medicine, surgery (trauma/critical medicine), bioethics and biostatistics. Members will consist of persons independent of the investigators who have no financial, scientific, or other conflict of interest with the study. Written documentation attesting to absence of conflict of interest will be required.   k. The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_68344], Health Sciences will provide the logistical management and support of the DSMB. A safety officer (chairperson) will be identified at the first meeting. This person will be the contact [CONTACT_507510]. Procedures for this will be discussed at the first meeting.  
l. The first meeting will take place before initiation of the study to discuss the protocol, approve the commencement of the study, and to establish guidelines to monitor the study. The follow -up meeting frequency of the DSMB will be determined during the first meeting.  
An emergency meeting of the DSMB will be called at any time by [CONTACT_414137].    
 
XI. Quality Control, Assurance and Confidentiality  
 
Protocol Compliance : The participating study site Investigators will not deviate from the 
protocol for any reason without prior written approval from the IRB except in the event of the  
safety of the research subject. In that event, the study site Investigator will notify the IND Sponsor and reviewing IRB immediately, if possible, and request approval of the protocol deviation, or, if prospective IND Sponsor and IRB approval is not possible, the study site Investigator will notify the IND Sponsor and reviewing IRB promptly following the respective protocol deviation. The study site Investigator will inform the reviewing IRB of all protocol deviations and unanticipated events involving risks to the research subjects and others and will obtain prospective IRB approval for all proposed protocol changes. Persistent or serious noncompliance may result in termination of the study site’s participation in the research study.  
 
Protocol Deviations : Due to the relative focused inclusion criteria and the short intervention 
period, we expect few protocol deviations as compared to other large multicenter trials. If monitoring reports demonstrate evidence of continuing protocol deviations, we will analyze them to determine if they are site specific or common across the study. We will note if specific inclusion or exclusion criteria are being misinterpreted, if a certain time point in testing is being omitted, or if a common set of data elements are missing. If the deviations are site specific, retraining will be done at the site. If the problems are study wide, we will discuss them with the 
 23  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23 /202 2 other investigators, the DOD and the FDA to see if the protocol needs to be amended or 
recruitment put on hold.  
Privacy and Confidentiality : The study site Investigators and members of their research team 
will make reasonable effort to ensure the research subjects’ confidentiality. Subject name [CONTACT_507540] a secure, locked, limited access area.  
Investigator Responsibilities : 
The study site Investigators will agree to implement the IRB approved protocol and conduct the study in accordance with Section 9 (Commitments) of Form FDA 1572, 21 CFR Part 312, Subpart D, and the ICH GCP Guidelines (E6, Section 5) as well as all applicable national, state and local laws. The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/Good Clinical Practice, and applicable regulatory requirements.

2017;83(3):[ADDRESS_654932] outlined below each criterion stipulated in the regulations for this exception and how our study 
design applies to these criteria.  
 
(1) The human subjects are in a life -threatening situation, available treatments are unproven or 
unsatisfactory, and the collection of valid scientific evidence, which may include evidence 
obtained through randomized placebo -controlled investigations, is necessary to determine the 
safety and effectiveness of particular interventions.  
 
The proposed trial is a randomized trial comparing the use of prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507466].  These patients are in a life -threatening situation with a 
mortality approaching 30- 40% despi[INVESTIGATOR_321510].[ADDRESS_654933] improved survival if transfusion of high or equal ratios of plasma and platelets to blood 
occurs.3 Evidence suggests that early blood component transfusion may reduce overall blood transfusion 
requirements and that addressing the coagulopathy which occurs early after injury improve s outcome.1-
3,12,25 This is what whole blood resuscitation provides.  
 
(2) Obtaining informed consent is not feasible because:  
i. The subjects will not be able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical condition;  
ii. The intervention under investigation must be administered before consent from the subjects' 
legally authorized representatives is feasible; and  
iii. There is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the individuals likely to become eligible for 
participation in the clinical investigation.  
 
The study intervention needs to be administered  en-route to a definitive trauma center from the injury 
scene  or outside emergency department  to provide the m aximal survival benefit.12 (see discussion of 
therapeutic window below). In this uncontrolled setting, the hemorrhagic shock patient is unable to 
provide consent for study enrollment, as they are commonly unconscious or in extremis, and legal next -
of-kin are often not immediately available, nor is it practical for the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507467]. Since we are studying patients with 
hemorrhagic shock following injury, there is no way to prospectively identify i ndividuals who are likely 
to become eligible for this trial.  
 
(3) Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects because:  
i. Subjects are facing a life- threatening situation that necessitates intervention;  
 26  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23/[ADDRESS_654934] benefit to the individual subjects; and  
iii. Risks associated with the investigation are reasonable in relation to what is known about the 
medical condition of the potential class of subjects, the risks and benefits of standard therapy, if 
any, and what is known about the risks and benefits of t he proposed intervention or activity.  
 
(i) As defined, these patients are injured and in hemorrhagic  shock and are facing a potentially life -
threatening situation that requires immediate intervention.  
(ii) Previous human studies suggest the potential for a direct benefit to individual patients who are in 
hemorrhagic shock.3,9,10,12,26 
(iii) Whole blood has been evaluated in the military and has been shown to offer a survival advantage. We 
have provided whole blood to over [ADDRESS_654935] not been observed in previous trials. We contend that 
these risks are reasonable in light of the potential benefits outlined in this proposal  and the current poor 
outcome for patients with hemorrhagic shock.  
 
(4) The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver.  
 
This study could not be conducted without the waiver of consent due to the need to initiate the 
intervention quickly in the prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507468], prior to trauma center  arrival for  hemorrhagic 
shock patients  at significant risk of mortality.  
 
(5) The proposed investigational plan defines the length of the potential therapeutic window based 
on scientific evidence, and the investigator has committed to attempting to contact a legally 
authorized representative for each subject within that window o f time and, if feasible, to asking the 
legally authorized representative contact[CONTACT_507511]. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact [CONTACT_507512].  
 Patients in hemorrhagic shock following injury have been shown to develop progressive hypothermia, 
coagulopathy and acidosis leading to further recalcitrant hemorrhage and multisystem organ failure and 
death.
[ADDRESS_654936]’s legal authorized representative as soon as feasible and a summary of these efforts will be documented in the patient’s chart. If the subject becomes 
competent during the study period, then he/she will be approached by [CONTACT_507513].  
 
(6) The IRB has reviewed and approved informed consent procedures and an informed consent 
document consistent with Sec. 50.25. These procedures and the informed consent document are to 
be used with subjects or their legally authorized representatives in si tuations where use of such 
procedures and documents is feasible. The IRB has reviewed and approved procedures and 
information to be used when providing an opportunity for a family member to object to a subject's 
participation in the clinical investigation consistent with paragraph (a)(7)(v) of this section.  
 
All procedures and consent forms will be approved by [CONTACT_507514] ( sIRB) of 
the study prior to the onset of the trial.  
 
 27  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23/202 2 (7) Additional protections of the rights and welfare of the subjects will be provided, including, at 
least:  
i. Consultation (including, where appropriate, consultation carried out by [CONTACT_1201]) with representatives of the communities in which the clinical investigation will be conducted and from 
which the subjects will be drawn;  
ii. Public disclosure to the communities in which the clinical investigation will be conducted and 
from which the subjects will be drawn, prior to initiation of the clinical investigation, of plans for 
the investigation and its risks and expected benefits;   
iii. Public disclosure of sufficient information following completion of the clinical investigation to apprise the community and researchers of the study, including the demographic characteristics of 
the research population, and its results;  
iv. Establishment of an independent data monitoring committee to exercise oversight of the clinical 
investigation; and  
v. If obtaining informed consent is not feasible and a legally authorized representative is not 
reasonably available, the investigator has committed, if feasible, to attempting to contact [CONTACT_507515]'s family member who is not  a legally authorized representative, and 
asking whether he or she objects to the subject's participation in the clinical investigation. The 
investigator will summarize efforts made to contact [CONTACT_507516].  
 
(i) Community consultation as outlined by [CONTACT_507517]. 
Since the population eligible for enrollment includes all citizens in the study region it will not 
be possible to target any particular small group. Feedback from the community will be obtained by [CONTACT_507518]. If requested, bracelets will be made available that could be worn by [CONTACT_507519]. Public notificat ion and community 
consultation will be performed as directed by [CONTACT_507520], targeted small group meetings or consultation with community leaders if the pandemic allows it. O ur institution has significant 
experience with community consultation and notification practices.  
 
(ii) & (iii) Public disclosures will be performed both prior to study enrollment and at the completion of the study in the form of multimedia press releases organized by [CONTACT_4520]. These will include plans for the study including potential risks and benefits and 
a summary of the results of the study upon completion. In the event that the press releases are 
not widely circulated, advertisements may also be placed in local papers describing the study.  
 
(iv) The Data Safety Monitoring Board will function as an independent data monitoring 
committee who will exercise oversight of the study.  (v) We expect that all patients who meet 
the enrollment criteria will be unconscious or in critical state that does not allow appropriate 
consent to occur. Any delay in medical care that would be required for the care provider to 
attempt to obtain consent from the patient’s legal guardian would be life threatening. Thus, it 
will not be feasible to attempt to obtain informed c onsent during the initial therapeutic 
window. Requiring consent to review a prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_507469] a biased estimate of the 
safety and efficacy of the intervention. T herefore, we will use exception from consent for 
emergency research which includes public notification, community consultation, patient notification of enrollment, and provision of an opportunity to opt out from ongoing 
participation.

CJD,  Babesia  Ebola)    
A. General Requirements:   FDA has specific lookback requirements for some infectious 
agents, e.g., HIV, HCV, CJD, while others are performed by [CONTACT_507523] (HVB, HTLV, WNV, Zika, Ebola, Babesia).  The CTS Pi[INVESTIGATOR_507471] a transfusion recipi[INVESTIGATOR_507472].  Transfusion Service physician will send the 
patient’s physician a letter  or secure e- mail  notifying him/her of the lookback.  HIV and 
HCV notifications are sent by [CONTACT_507524] e- mail .  The rest of the 
notification letters are sent by [CONTACT_507525] e- mail.   
 
Revised step II.B.1;   step II.B.5 rewritten   
B.Lookback Notification Process   
1.HIV and HCV lookback process:   A notification letter is sent along with a notification form  by 
[CONTACT_507526] e- mail . The physician must promptly return the enclosed notification form 
…  
5.CJD lookback notification process and criteria:   The blood center will notify CTS of components from donors 
that were found to have CJD, vCJD, suspected vCJD, risk factors for CJD, or if withdrawal is recommended in cases 
under investigation for vCJD (CJD diagnosis and age less than 55). In those situa tions, consignee notification could 
enable the consignee to inform the physician, or other qualified personnel responsible for care of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], so 
that recipi[INVESTIGATOR_507473].   CTS will notify the patient’s physician in writing by [CONTACT_507527]/she provides follow up to the transfusion service of the patient outcome.   Follow up notification is not required if 
no response is received.   If the patient is deceased, physician notification is not required.   

 29  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23 /202 2 For transfusible components from a donor with one family member diagnosed with CJD, or with risk factors for 
vCJD, suspected vCJD (due to geographic risk deferral, transfusion in the U.K. or in [LOCATION_009]  between 1980 and the 
present, or due to injection of bovine insulin), per FDA Guidance for Industry, it is not appropriate to conduct tracing and notification of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_507474].

PRINCIPLE  
Regulatory agencies require notification of consignees by [CONTACT_507528] a donor 
who subsequently tests confirmed positive for HIV1, 2, HCV, or is at risk for transmitting Creutzfeldt-

Version 8.0 dated 8/23 /202 2  
POLICY   
I.IDENTIFICATION OF INFECTED DONORS   
A. Units implicated in the lookback process are identified by [CONTACT_507530].   The transfusion service is notified in writing of the units and their shippi[INVESTIGATOR_107278].   Notification to 
external hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (non CTS facilities) is completed  by [CONTACT_507531], not the RCRL or CTS.  
 
II.RECIPI[INVESTIGATOR_507477]/CJD/PARASITIC INFECTION 
(HIV, HCV, HBV, HTLV, WNV, Zika, Ebola, CJD,Babesia)  
A.General Requirements  
FDA has specific lookback requirements for some infectious agents, e.g., HIV, HCV, 
CJD, while others are performed by [CONTACT_507532] (HVB, 
HTLV, WNV, Zika, Ebola, Babesia).  The CTS Pi[INVESTIGATOR_507478] a transfusion recipi[INVESTIGATOR_507479].  Transfusion Service physician will send the patient’s physician a letter or 
secure e-mail notifying him/her of the lookback.  HIV and HCV notifications are sent by 
[CONTACT_507526] e- mail.   The rest of the notification letters are sent by [CONTACT_507533] e- mail.   
B.Lookback Notification Process  
1.HIV and HCV lookback process:   A notification letter is sent along with a 
notification form by [CONTACT_507526] e -mail. The physician must promptly 
return the enclosed notification form to the transfusion service indicating that 
they accept responsibility for patient notificat ion.  In the case of HIV and HCV, 
patient notification includes the need for HIV or HCV testing and counseling.  If 
the transfusion service cannot locate the physician, does not receive the 
notification form from the physician, or the physician refuses to accept 
responsibility for notification, then the transfusion service is responsible for 
notifying the patient.  This is done by [CONTACT_507534][INVESTIGATOR_600].  The 
FDA requires that the process of notification be completed within 12 weeks for 
HCV and HIV and reasonable attempts should be made.  In addition to the 
physician notification, the facility where the patient was transfused will be notified.  This notification will go to the transfusion committee or similar entity  
at the facility.

2.HCV lookback notification criteria:   A reactive NAT result serves as one basis for 
initiating lookback.  Since confirmatory testing for HCV (RIBA) became 
unavailable in 2012, new FDA approved algorithms were developed for HCV 
notification.  Notification of transfusion recipi[INVESTIGATOR_507480] -
HCV screening assay but negative on a mini-pool or individual donation HCV NAT assay and non- reactive on a second anti -HCV screening assay.   Transfusion 
Services must make reasonable attempts to perform the notification within 12 weeks when the donor is repeatedly reactive on the anti- HCV screening assay 

 31  
Version 8.0 dated 8/23/202 2 and positive on a mini -pool or individual donation HCV NAT assay or 
negative  on the HCV NAT assay and reactive on the second anti -HCV screening 
assay.   Notification for HCV is not required if the donor is deceased.  
3.HIV lookback notification criteria:   When testing for HIV is confirmed positive or 
NAT positive when the screening test is reactive and further testing is not 
available, or if under an IND or IDE is exempted for such use by [CONTACT_8415], you must 
notify transfusion recipi[INVESTIGATOR_507481], or the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]'s physician of record or a legal representative or relative if the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_193732] a minor, 
deceased, adjudged incompetent by a State court, or if the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_507482] a legal representative or relative to receive information on 
behalf of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_507483] (see 
above), you  must make reasonable attempts  to perform the notification within [ADDRESS_654937] 
notify the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s physician of record but it is left up to the clinician’s medical 
judgement as to whether or not to inform a family member.  
4.HBV lookback notification process and criteria:   The blood center will notify CTS 
of components from donors that test confirmed positive for HBV on a current 
donation (surface antigen positive with positive neutralization and/or positive 
NAT).   CTS will notify the patient’s physician in writing by [CONTACT_507535]/she provides follow up to the transfusion service of the 
patient outcome and/or testing.  Follow up physician notification is not required 
if no response is received.  If the patient is deceased, physician notification is not 
required. 
 
5.CJD lookback notification process and criteria:   The blood center will notify 
CTS of components from donors that were found to have CJD, vCJD, suspected 
vCJD, risk factors for CJD, or if withdrawal is recommended in cases under 
investigation for vCJD (CJD diagnosis and age less than 55). In those situa tions, 
consignee notification could enable the consignee to inform the physician, or  
other qualified personnel responsible for care of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], so that recipi[INVESTIGATOR_507484].   CTS will notify the patient’s physician 
in writing by [CONTACT_507536]/she provides follow up to 
the transfusion service of the patient outcome.   Follow up notification is not 
required if no response is received.   If the patient is deceased, physician 
notification is not required.  
 
For transfusible components from a donor with one family member diagnosed 
with CJD, or with risk factors for vCJD, suspected vCJD  (due to geographic risk 
deferral, transfusion in the U.K. or in [LOCATION_009] between 1980 and the present, or 
due to injection of bovine insulin), per FDA Guidance for Industry, it is not 
appropriate to conduct tracing and notification of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_507474].

CTS of components from donors that test confirmed positive for HTLV I/II.  CTS 
will notify the patient’s physician in writing by [CONTACT_507536]/she provides follow up to the transfusion service of the patient outcome 
and/or testing.  Follow up notification is not required if no response is 
received.   If the patient is deceased, physician notification is not required. 
 
7.Zika virus lookback notification process and criteria:   The blood center will notify 
CTS of components from donors that test NAT positive for Zika virus.  CTS will 
notify the patient’s physician in writing by [CONTACT_507527]/she provides follow up to the transfusion service of the p atient outcome and/or 
testing.   Follow up notification is not required if no response is received. If the

and/or testing.  Follow up notification is not required if no response is received.   If the patient is deceased, physician notification is not required. 
 
9.Ebola virus lookback notification process and criteria:   The blood center will notify 
CTS regarding blood and blood components collected from donors later determined to have Ebola virus infection or disease.  CTS will notify the patient’s 
physician in writing by [CONTACT_507536]/she provides 
follow up to the transfusion service of the patient outcome and/or testing.  Follow 
up notification is not required if no response is received.  If the patient is 
deceased, physician notifica tion is not required.

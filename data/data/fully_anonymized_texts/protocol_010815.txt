1.0 Introduction 
1.1 Conventional ly Fractionated  External Beam Radiotherapy  
The optimal radiation schedule taking into account both daily fraction size and overall duration of treatment for the curative treatment of prostate cancer using external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is unknown.  Over the last [ADDRESS_489542] 
patients to receive daily fractions of 1.8-2.0 Gy for a duration of 7- 8 weeks to a total 
cumulative dose to the prostate of 70-79 Gy (1).  Treatment in this fashion has been demonstr ated to be safe with moderate rates of late rectal and bladder toxicity .  
 Four randomized trials provide evidence that doses above 74 Gy can increase the likelihood of cure but higher doses are associated with increased toxicity, especially rectal toxicit y (2-5). In the MD Anderson randomized trial there was an increase in grade 2 or 
higher rectal toxicity from 12% to 26% between the 70 Gy and 78 Gy arms  (6).  In further 
analysis of this study it was found that both the volume of rectum treated to higher doses (70 Gy) as well as lower doses (40- 60 Gy) contributed to late rectal toxicity  (7).   
Further dose intensification using c onventional fractions of 1.8-2.[ADDRESS_489543] 
successful radiation targeting one will not be able to adequately treat the prostate wi thout 
also treating  a portion of the anterior rectal wall .  Additionally, the delivery of radiation 
therapy over this protracted period of time is expensive and inconvenient for patients with some radiation schedules in excess of 9 weeks.   
We propose to i nvestigate a novel treatment regimen that will: 1) significantly reduce the 
duration of treatment and 2) limit the volume of normal tissue radiated while maintaining equivalent efficacy. In short, w e hypothesize that  hypofractionated radiation therapy usin g 
continuous real- time evaluation of prostate motion  combined with reoptimization of the 
IMRT plan according to the anatomy of the day will improve the therapeutic ratio . 
 
1.2 Biologic Basis of Hypofractionation   
The efficacy of radiation in causing reproductive cellular  death is a function of the overall 
radiation dose, the dose per fraction, and the overall treatment time. C lassically this 
relationship is described according to the linear- quadratic (LQ) model . Using the LQ 
model the fractionation sensitivity  of both tumor cells and normal tis sues can be defined  
using the alpha- beta ratio (α/ß) .   
 
Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_390380] a high alpha- beta ratio (≥ 10 Gy)  such that changes in individual fraction size would be 
expected to only have a modest overall impact on efficacy as compared t o overall 
treatment dose.  In contrast, slowly dividing tissue s that exhibit late toxicity to radiation 
therapy (such as bone , connective tissues,  or spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]) are often described by a lower 
alpha- beta ratio  (in the range of 3- 5 Gy) such that larger dai ly fractions would be 
anticipated to cause relatively greater toxicity when compared to smaller fractions when delivered to the same total dose. In most clinical scenarios  cancer s have alpha- beta ratios 
much higher than the normal tissues adjacent to them ( i.e. 10 Gy vs. 3 Gy) and as a result 
Duke Prostate SBRT  
 
Version: 17-June-[ADDRESS_489544] a lower  alpha- beta ratio than 
nearby  [CONTACT_390391] (rectum, bladder) (8).  This observation has encouraged investigators 
to evaluate radiation fractionation schemes that use fraction sizes larger  than 1.8-2.0 Gy 
(9). If the alpha -beta ratio of prostate cancer is lower than nearby [CONTACT_390392], larger fraction s (to a lower total dos e) should result in 
an increase in the therapeutic ratio.    
1.[ADDRESS_489545] examined a number of 
hypofractionated regimens with daily fraction sizes ranging from 2.5 to 7.25 Gy delivered in 5-28 fractions over 1- 6 weeks  (10).  As this protocol examines a five fraction regimen , 
only the experience with five fraction regimens will be reviewed.  
Investigators at the Virginia Mason Clinic in Seattle published the first experience with a five fraction regimen  in 2006 (11). These clinicians  treated a total of 40 patients with low 
risk prostate cancer (T2a or less, Gleason 6 or les s, PSA 10.0 or less) and reported 
preliminary toxicity and efficacy results with a median follow -up of 41 months.  The 
Virginia Mason clinicians delivered five fractions of  6.7 Gy (total dose 33.5 Gy) over five 
days.   The 5 year estimate of freedom from b iochemical recurrence is  90% by [CONTACT_111527]-Phoenix 
definition .  Late toxicity was defined as occurring 30 or more days after the completion of 
therapy.  Overall, the treatment was well tolerated with no Grade 3-5 genitourinary (GU) or gastrointestinal (GI) toxic ity reported at a median of 41 months of follow -up. Grade 2 
genitourinary toxicity was reported in 20% (8/40) of patients and Grade 2 gastrointestinal 
toxicity was reported in 7.5% ( 3/40) of patients . 
The second published experience with a five fraction re gimen comes from investigators at 
Stanford University (12).  These clinicians treated a total of 41  patients with low risk 
prostate cancer (T2a or less, Gleason 6 or less, PSA 10.0 or less) and reported preliminary toxicity and efficacy results with a minimum follow -up of 6 months (median 33 months).  
The Stanford regimen delivered [ADDRESS_489546] investigators reported no RTOG Grade 4 -5 acute or late GU/GI  
complications.  Two  patients experienced  RTOG Grade 3 late GU toxicity and none 
reported  Grade 3 GI complications. A reduced rate of rectal toxicities was observed with 
every -other -day vs. 5 consecutive days treatment regimen (0% vs. 38%, p = 0.0035). At 
last follow -up, no patient has had a biochemical  recurrence. Of 32 patients with 12 months 
minimum follow -up, 25 patients  (78%) achieved a PSA nadir  ≤0.4 ng/mL. A PSA decline 
to progressively lower nadirs up to [ADDRESS_489547] ive

We anticipate that this study will begin enrolling subjects in the Fall  2009 and will enroll 2 subjects a month for 30 months 
for a total enrollment of 60. 
 
3.0 Study Design and Patient Selection  3.1 Study Design

(e.g., an artificial hip).  
3.3.11 Severe, active comorbidity, defined as follows:  
• Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_390381] 6  months 
• Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months  
• Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of 
registration  
• Crohn’s Disease or ulcerative colitis  
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respi[INVESTIGATOR_390382] 
• Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects; note, however, that laboratory tes ts for liver function and coagulation parameters 
are not required for entry  into this protocol. (Patients on Coumadin or other blood 
thinning agents are eligible for this  study.) 
• Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition; note,  however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this 
protocol. The need to exclude  patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary 
because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive. Protocol- specific requirements may also  exclude 
immunocompromised patients. 
 
4.0 Pretreatment Evaluations   
Note: This section lists baseline evaluations needed before the initiation of protocol treatment 
that do not affect eligibility.

 4.2 Insurance Pre-Authorization 
As some private insurance carriers will not cover SBRT to the prostate it is highly 
recommended that pre-authorization be completed before enrolling the patient on study. Patients whose insurance carriers do not cover SBR T of the prostate need to be advised 
before proceeding with study enrollment.  
5.0 Radiation Therapy 5.1 Dose Specifications  
5.1.1 Stereotactic Targeting and Treatment  
This protocol will require treatments to be performed with a stereotactic technique with 
the use of a 3 -D coordinate system defined by [CONTACT_390394] (Calypso) or  use of 
the ExacTrac system  and/or use cone -beam CT (CBCT)  with  fiducial markers .  
 
Dose Fractionation 
Patients will rec eive 5 fractions of radiation. Each fraction size will be 7.4 Gy. The total 
dose will be 37 Gy. The 5 treatments will be scheduled to be delivered every other day. A minimum of 36 hours should separate each treatment.  No more than 3 fractions will be 
delivered per week.  The total duration of treatment will be no shorter than 10 days and 
no longer than 18 days.  
 
5.2 Supportive M easures  
5.2.1 Urinary   
Symptomatic urinary medicines, ( e.g. tamsulosin ) are allowed at the discretion of 
the treating radiation oncologist or urologist.  
5.2.[ADDRESS_489550] a full urinary bladder both during simulation and treatment.  This may be achieved by [CONTACT_390395] 16- 24 oz of water or 
other fluid 2- 3 hours prior to treatment and to not urinate between this time and 
treatment as they are able.  
5.2.3 Bowel  
One tablespoon of Milk of Magnesia will be taken the night before the simulation 
and the night before each treatment. One Fl eet’s enema wi ll be administered  2-[ADDRESS_489551] quality assurance measures will be taken prior and during radiation therapy.  
 
5.4 Set-up, Localization and Tracking 
5.4.1 Patient Set -up 
Patients  will be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_105683] a comfortable posture. The minimum 
immobilization apparatus will be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_390383]-banded together or equivalent . More complex immobilization devices are 
allowed, as per the discretion of  the treating physician, as long as they do not 
Duke Prostate SBRT  
 
Version: 17-June-2013  10 
 interfere with the proper functioning of the image -guidance (Calypso, ExacTrac 
and cone- beam CT ) system.  
5.4.[ADDRESS_489552] system will be utilized for both 
localization and tracking /monitoring . The initial localization and alignment is 
based on the center of mass of the transponders/fiducial markers. After initial 
localization is performed, all effort should be made to initiate the treatment delivery as quickly  as possible.  Significant rotations may be corrected at initial 
localization stage, and intra- fractional rotations will be ignored. Further 
adjustment during the treatment will be translational shift of the center of mass determined via Calypso or Ex acTrac, using remote couch motion. 
 
5.5 Treatment Planning  
5.5.1 Simulation  
Computed Tomography (CT)  CT will be the primary image platform for treatment planning.  The simulation should be performed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_64959], with the transponders/fiducial markers in place . Axi al cuts of 3 mm or less  will be 
acquired throughout the pelvis with slices of 1 mm thickness through the prostate (defined as [ADDRESS_489553] point of the prostate gland or 
transponder/fiducial markers to [ADDRESS_489554] 
transponder/fiducial  marker).  
 
MRI  
MRI images are not required. However, if MR scan is planned with use of 
Calypso system, MR  should be obtained prior to the implantation of transponders.  
 Contrast  Oral, IV, urethral, and bladder contr ast are allowed but not required.  
 
5.5.2 Treatment Planning/Target Volumes  
1. The definition of volumes will be in accordance with the ICRU Report #50 and ICRU Report #62: Prescribing, Recording, and Reporting Photon Beam Therapy. 2. The Gross Tumor Volume (GTV ) is defined by [CONTACT_390396]. 
The GTV for the purposes of this protocol is the prostate only.  3. The clinical target volume ( CTV) will be the same as the GTV and wi ll consist 
of the prostate without the seminal vesicles as defined by [CONTACT_105] -contrast axial CT 
scan.  
4. The planning target volume ( PTV ) will be defined as the CTV plus a 3 mm  
margin posteriorly and 5mm in all other dimensions. 
 
5.5.3 Dosimetry  
1. Intensity Modulat ed Radiotherapy (IMRT) beam arrangements will be designed 
with a  minimum of [ADDRESS_489555] IMRT. If 
Duke Prostate SBRT  
 
Version: 17-June-[ADDRESS_489556] 95 % of the PTV with a 
maximal differential between the prescription isodose line and the maximum dose to the PTV of 15%. Maximal dose to the PTV is defined as to 1cc or 1% of PTV.  In addition, <10% of the PTV or < 5 cc (whichever is smaller) should be treated to >112% of the prescription dose.  4. Ad equate dose conformality to the PTV, defined as the ratio of prescription 
isodose volume to PTV volume of < 1.2, should be achieved.   5. The volume of all tissues outside the PTV receiving > 100% of the prescription dose should be < 15% of PTV volume.  6. Ideally hot spots will be manipulated to occur within the periphera l zones of the 
prostate itself avoiding the prostate -rectal interface as defined by [CONTACT_390397].  
 
5.6 Critical Structures  
5.6.1 Critical Organ Dose -Volume Limits  
1. The normal tissue volume to be contoured will include bladder, rectum, bilateral femora (to the level of ischial tuberosity), seminal vesicles, penile bulb, and skin.  2. The normal tissues will be contoured and considered as solid organs.  
3. The bladder should be contoured from its base to the dome 4. The rectum should be contoured from the anus (at the level of the ischial tuberosities) for a length of [ADDRESS_489557] of the prostate superiorly as one structure (right and left).  The seminal vesicles are not a target for this trial but dosimetric data will be collected for later analysis. 7. The tissue within the skin and outside all other critical normal  
structures and PTVs are  designated as unspecified tissue.  
8. The following table lists maximum dose limits to a point or volume within several critical organs.  These are absolute limits, and treatment delivery that does not abide by [CONTACT_390398] a major protocol violation.  The dose is 
listed as total over 5 fractions and per fraction.

5.7.[ADDRESS_489561] on site. The comparison can  be done both manually and automatically. For any imag e-
guidance method, if any deviation is larger than 2 mm, correction should be perfo rmed.  
 
5.7.7 All image/signal- guidance data should be recorded for post treatment review and 
analysis.  In some case, replanning (either offline or online) based anatomy of the 
day may be performed . Such request will be made by [CONTACT_30951]. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_489562] the following potential side effects:  
5.8.1 Small bowel or rectal irritation manifesting as abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], diarrhea, rectal urgency, proctitis, or hematochezia 
 
5.8.2 Bladder complications including urinary frequency/urgency, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection, and incontinence 
 
5.8.3 Radiation dermatitis  
 
5.8.4 Clinical dis cretion may be exercised to treat side effects from radiation therapy. 
Rectal side effects such as diarrhea may be treated with diphenoxylate or loperamide. Bladder or rectal spasms can be treated with anticholinergic agents or tolterodine. Bladder irritation can be managed with phenazopyridine. Dysuria may be managed with ibuprofen. Erectile dysfunction can be treated with phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors (sildenafil). 
 
5.9 Radiation Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SA Es) will be recorded in study database. 
Related and unexpected SAEs will be reported to the DUHS IRB per IRB policy. Sites are responsible for reporting any related and unexpected SAEs  to their respective IRBs and also 
for notifying [CONTACT_6321] and his Study Coordinator of such an event in order to facilitate reporting to the DUHS IRB in accordance with the required reporting timelines. Conversely, the DUHS study team is responsible for notifying all study sites of any reportable events in a timely fashion.

treatment or procedure (attribution of unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite).  
 
Definition of an SAE: Any adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death;  
 A life -threatening  adverse experience;  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life threatening, or do not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_390384], when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  
Note:  All deaths on study require both routine and expedited reporting regardless of 
causality. Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided. “On study” is 
defined as during or within [ADDRESS_489563] been previously identified as resulting from treatment of prostate cancer  with radiation therapy. For purposes of this 
study, reporting requirements are determined by [CONTACT_390399]: the type or nature of the event; the severity (grade); the relationship to the study therapy and whether the event is expected or unexpected.  
 Recommended assessment steps include:  
Identification of adverse events using the NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 terminology. A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the CTEP home page (http://ctep.cancer.gov).  
Grading the severity of the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE Version 4.0.  
Determination as to whether the adverse event is related to the study therapy using t he 
following categories: Unrelated, Possible, Probable, and Definite. Determine whether the adverse event is expected or unexpected.

6.8 Adverse Events Classificatio n 
Adverse events will be recorded at each study visit.  These adverse events will be classified 
in accordance to the CTCAE ver. 4.0.  
7.0 Statistical Analysis Plan 7.1 Primary End Point 
The primary end -point of the study is the safety of deliver ing SBRT to the prostate.  The 
dose and fractionation of radiation is determined such that the risk of late complications should be equivalent to the BED
3Gy of 78 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. 
 A conservative estimate of grade 3 rectal toxicity for this regimen of 78 Gy in 2 Gy fractions is 1.5% at 2 years.  Therefore, with a patient population of 60 patients if the true 
rate of grade 3 or higher rectal toxicity is 1.5% there will be a 77% power to rule out a >7.1% rate.  If the true rate is 2.5%, there will be an 81% power of ruling out a >9.6% rate.  
 
Incidence of GU and GI Acute and Late Adverse Events  
Adverse events are scored according to CTCAE version 4.0. An acute adverse event will be defined as an adverse event occurring less than or equal to 90 days from the completion of RT. Both unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios and the respective 95% confidence interval will be computed.   A late adverse event will be defined as an adverse event occurring more than 90 days from the completion of RT. The time to late  adverse events will be measured from the time that 
protocol treatment is comple ted (i.e., the completion of radiation) to the time of the worst 
late adverse event. If no such late adverse event is observed until the time of the analysis, the patient will be censored at the time of the  analysis. The distribution of time to late 
adverse events (observed severities of adverse events  over time) will be estimated . 
 
7.2 Secondary End- Points  
7.2.1 Disease- free survival: Disease-free failure events include local progression, 
distant progression, biochemical recurrence as defined by [CONTACT_390393], and death from any cause. 
7.2.2 Analysis for Endpoints Related to EPIC- 26 QOL  
We will use the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC -26) 
instrument to measure QOL. Protocol eligible patients will be included in the QOL analysis only if they hav e provided baseline and at least one subsequent 
measurement. The EPIC -26 instrument is intended to be collected on all cases 
participating in the trial.  
 The EPIC -26 will be collected at pretreatment (baseline) and at 3 , 12, 24 months, 
and 3 years after th erapy starts. Patient self -assessment of symptoms will be 
performed using three primary EPIC scales: urinary, bowel, and sexual symptoms.

7.4 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_390386] ≤ 7.5% of the men will experience a grade 3+ adverse event. For this study, a 
rate of 5% grade 3+ GU and GI adverse events (pt) according to the CTCAE version 4.0 within 24 months of the start of radiation therapy is considered acceptable. A rate of 20% is considered unacceptable. The null hypothesis (H0) is that this radiation therapy is not tolerable versus the alternative hypothesis (HA) that this radiation therapy is tolerable. With [ADDRESS_489571] the null hypothesis is >90%.   The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_390387] [ADDRESS_489572] some treatment. If at any stage, we show 
that the grade 3+ GU and GI adverse event rate may be greater than or equal to 20%, we would temporarily close the study to accrual, gather the relevant source data on the cases with gr ade 3+ GU and GI adverse events, prepare a statistical report summarizing the 
adverse event findings, and present the report to the radiation oncology and GU multidisciplinary team for review. The GU team will review all source documentation on the analyzed cases with adverse events and the statistical report summarizing the findings as soon as possible. Following the review of the data, the team will discuss the findings and make a recommendation about the study. If at the first or second stage either of t he 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_390388], we will continue accrual and monitoring for grade 3+ GU and GI adverse events. If we continue until the last stage, then we will either conclude “tolerability” or not.

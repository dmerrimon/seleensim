Introduction:  
Psoriasis vulgaris is a common inflammatory condition of the skin that results in scaly red 
itchy plaques. In addition to affecting the skin, psoriasis can also cause disease in the finger 
and toe nails. Nail psoria sis is a chronic disease and can present with the following clinical 
findings: splinter hemorrhage, leukonychia, red spots in the lunula , nail pi[INVESTIGATOR_22940] , nail plate 
crumbling, hyperkeratosis, and/ or nail plate separation from the nail bed. The most 
characteristic nail findings associated with nail psoriasis are nail pi[INVESTIGATOR_22940], onycholysis with a 
rim of erythema, and oil spots. Special interest will be paid to identifying these particular 
nail findings in patients, however all potential nail ps oriasis symptoms will be assessed in 
patients in this study. Due to the highly visible nature of disease in the fingernails, nail 
psoriasis often results in a substantial deleterious effect on a patient’s quality of life. 
Patients also can have significant  pain and disability due to nail psoriasis.  
Psoriasis patients  who have nail involvement are known to have  more severe psoriasis 
disease and diminished  quality of life  when  compared to psoriasis patients without nail 
disease.  Patients with nail psoriasis often also have psoriatic arthritis , and untreated  
psoriatic arthritis is known to lead to joint destruction with potentially severe morbidity . 
Nail psoriasis has a reported  incidence of 80 to 90% (Jiaravuthiasan, et al ). Because nail 
psoriasis causes a substantial disease burden for patients, it is critical that safe and 
effective treatments are found for this specific type of psoriasis . Unfortunately, nail 
psoriasis is often difficult to treat.  
Apremilast  is an orally ava ilable small molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4)  
that is FDA approved for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis . PDE4 is one of 
the main phosphdi esterases expressed in immune cells, and its inhibition by [CONTACT_314261] i ncrease cyclic adenosine monophosphate and thereby [CONTACT_314262]. Specifically, apremilast is believed to down regulate pro -
inflammatory cytokines  including  TNF -α, IL -23, IL -17, and others .  
Apremilast has shown promising results for treating psoriatic arthritis  and nail disease; 
however more data is needed regarding its effect on nail psoriasis  (Kavanaugh , et al ). We 
hypothesize that apremilast  will prove to be highly effective in treating nail psoriasis. We 
propose to conduct an open  label clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of 
apremilast in treating nail psoriasis , where we will follow the package insert guidelines for 
treating patients with apremilast .  
STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Primary Objective  
To determine the efficacy and safety of oral  apremilast in the treatment of nail psoriasis.  
The primary efficacy outcomes will be the  change in the modified Nail Psoriasis  Severity 
Index (mNAPSI), which has been  validated as a reliable tool for measuring nail  disease 
(Cassell, et al) . 
Primary Outcome Measure :  
• Mean percent change of mNAPSI at week 36  compared to baseline for all nails. mNAPSI   
score ranges from 0 (no nail disease) to 130  (complete nail involvement in all ten nails.)  
 
Secondary Objectives  
• Mean p erce nt change in mNAPSI of target nail at weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, and [ADDRESS_386745] udy.  
• Proportion of patients achieving mNAPSI of 0 in all fingernails at weeks 36 and 52.  
• Change in patient reported nail pain, as based on the Nail Pain VAS score, at week  
52 compared to baseline score.  
•  Pain Change in psoriatic arthritis symptoms at  week 52 compared to baseline, in patients 
who self -identify as having psoriatic arthritis at baseline. Symptoms will be assessed using 
a visual analogue scale (VAS) for reporting psoriatic arthritis pain.  
•  Safety Adverse effects will be assessed at each  visit  
•  Proportion of patients achieving a mNAPSI 75 response, as defined by 75% or greater  
reduction over baseline in mNAPSI score at weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, and 52 for the target  
fingernail.  
• Mean change in the total number of nails involved assessed at  weeks [ADDRESS_386746] package insert 
(www.celgene.com/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]).  
 
Number of Subjects  
Twenty eligible patients will be enrolled. Patients will be treated for [ADDRESS_386747];  there will be no placebo arm in this study .  
 
Visit Schedule  
Screening Period  
Patient eligibility will be determined within [ADDRESS_386748] three months (week 0, 4,  8, 12), then every 12 weeks until week 48 
(week 24, 36, 48) followed by a final study visit at week 52. Patients will have  
photos  taken of their target nail and of all of their finger nails  at baseline, week [ADDRESS_386749] a physician global assessment of fingernail psoriasis and a sPGA (using 
the NPF Score version) done at every visit.  On week 0, 24, and [ADDRESS_386750] a PASI 
and BSA done. There will  be PRO questions at each visit.  PASI/PGA assessments will be 
compared to the nail improvement noted in the NAPSI.  
 
Dosing schedule   
Twenty eligible patients will be enrolled. Patients will be treated for [ADDRESS_386751]; there will be no placebo arm in this study.   
Treatment will be delivered  just as it would be for patients with psoriasis receiving 
apremilast outside of this clinical trial. By [CONTACT_314263], we hope to capture an accurate portrayal of the efficacy and safety of apremilast on 
the treatment of psoriatic nail disease.  
Dosing will follow package insert guidelines as follows:  
Day 1: 10mg am dose  
Day 2: 10mg BID  
Day 3: 10mg am dose, 20mg pm dose  
Day 4: 20mg BID  
Day 5: 20mg am dose, 30mg pm dose  
Day 6 and beyond: 30 mg BID  
 
Discontinuation of the Study  
The study may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator at any time  without 
replacement

SAFETY PLAN  
Clinical Safety Assessments  
The following clinical safety assessments will be performed:  (See study flowchart)  
 Physical examinations  
 Vital signs (te mperature, heart rate,  blood pressure , and weight ) 
 Monitoring for adverse events  
 Monitoring for concomitant therapy  
 Laboratory evaluations (c omplete metabolic panel,  complete blood count with 
differential, Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B, QuantiFERON  gold ) will be done at baseline . 
Fasting will not be required prior to laboratory evaluations. Continued 
monitoring will be done at the discretion of the investigator, but contin ued 
laboratory monitoring will not be required during the trial. Patients with a 
positive QuantiFERON  gold (QGT) will be referred to the health department for 
recommended treatment.  
 
Laboratory Safety Assessments  
The following laboratory tests will be per formed at screening , baseline, and week 52 : 
 Urine pregnancy test, if applicable.  
 Laboratory evaluations (complete metabolic panel, complete blood count with 
differential, Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B, QGT) will be done at baseline. Continued 
monitoring will be done at the discretion of the investigator, but continued 
laboratory monitoring will not be required during the trial.  
 
Contraception Education  
The risks to a fetus or to a nursing child from apremila st are not known at this time.  
Results of the animal and in vitro studies can be found in the IB.    
All females of childbearing potential (FCBP) † must use one of the approved contraceptive 
options as described in Section “Inclusion Criteria” while on investigational product and for 
at least [ADDRESS_386758] of childbearing potential’s contraceptive measures or ability to 
become pregnant changes at the time of study entry or at any time during the study, the 
Investigator will educate the subject regarding options and correct and consistent use of 
effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully prevent pregnancy.  
Male subjects (including those who have had a vasecto my) who engage in activity in which 
conception is possible must use barrier contraception (male latex condom or nonlatex 
condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]) while 
on investigational product and for at least [ADDRESS_386759]’s chosen form of contraception must be effective by [CONTACT_314264] (for example, hormonal contraception should be 
initiated at least 28 days bef ore randomization).

SAFETY REPORTING  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended , or untoward medical occurrence 
occurring at any dose that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. 
It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any 
concomitant impairment of the subject’s hea lth, including laboratory test values (as 
specified by [CONTACT_65801]), regardless of etiology. Any medical condition that was 
present prior to study treatment and that remains unchanged or improved should not be 
recorded as an AE. If there is a worsen ing of that medical condition this should be 
considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the Case 
Report Form rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome.  
All AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_57748](s) from the time of signing the informed 
consent through the end of the designated follow -up period.  
Abnormal laboratory values defined as adverse events  
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by [CONTACT_39132]:  
 Results in discontinuation from the study.  
 Requires treatment, modification/interruption of study drug dose, or any other 
therapeutic intervention.  
 Is judged by [CONTACT_737](s) to be of significant clinical import ance.  
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the 
diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the CRF. If the abnormality 
was not a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality s hould be 
recorded as the AE.  
Serious adverse event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE which:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening (i.e., in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689](s) the subject is at 
immediate risk of death from the AE)  
 Requires inpatient ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption 
of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Constitutes an im portant medical event  
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately 
life threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but may jeopardize the 
subject or require medical or surgical intervention to p revent one of the other outcomes 
listed above.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such 
an AE should be considered serious.  
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65777]: were planned before entry 
into the  clinical study; are for elective treatment of a condition unrelated to the studied 
indication or its treatment; occur on an emergency outpatient basis and do not result in 
admission (unless fulfilling other criteria above); are part of the normal treatmen t or 
monitoring of the studied indication and are not associated with any deterioration in 
condition.  
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE pages of the CRF and the SAE Report Form must 
be completed.  
For each SAE, the Investigator(s) will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to study drug, action taken regarding study drug, and outcome.  
Classification of severity  
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator(s) must assess the severity of the event. The AEs 
will be evaluate d for severity according to the following scale:  
Grade 1 = Mild  
Grade 2 = Moderate  
Grade 3 = Severe  
Classification of Relationship/Causality of adverse events (SAE/AE) to study drug  
The Investigator(s) must determine the relationship between the administra tion of study 
drug and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:  
Not suspected : The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study 
drug administration makes a causal relationship unlikely 
or remote , or other medicatio ns, therapeutic interventions, 
or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for 
the observed event  
Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study 
drug administration makes a causal relationship possible,  
and other medications, therapeutic interventions, or 
underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event.  
Immediate reporting of serious adverse events  
Any AE that meets the any criterion for a SAE requires the completion  of an SAE Report 
Form in addition to being recorded on the AE pages of the CRF.  The Investigator(s) is 
required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  This applies to 
all SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, that o ccur during the study, those made 
known to the Investigator(s) within [ADDRESS_386760]’s last dose of study drug, and 
those made known to the investigator(s) at anytime that are suspected of being related to 
study drug.  
The SAE must be reported imme diately (i.e., within 24 hours of the Investigators’ 
knowledge of the event) to Celgene Safety by [CONTACT_6972].  A written report (prepared by [CONTACT_3786](s) using an SAE Report Form or a 3500A Medwatch form  is to be faxed to 
Safety (see below for conta ct information).

The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE.  If a subject has died and 
an autopsy has been performed, copi[INVESTIGATOR_314260].  Any follow -up data will be detailed in a 
subsequent SAE Report Form or Medwatch form and sent to Celgene.  
The Investigator(s) is responsible for informing the Institutional Review B oard/Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow -up 
information about the event. The Investigator(s) must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_137746], 
including correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/IEC, on file.  All SAEs that have not 
resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study must be followed 
until either the event resolves completely, stabilizes/resolves with sequelae, or returns to 
baseline (if a baseline value is available).  
Pregnancies  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of 
age or disease state) of a female subject or the female partner of a male subject  occurring 
while the subject is on study drug, or within [ADDRESS_386762]’s last dose of study drug, 
are considered immediately reportable events.  Study drug is to be discontinued 
immediately and the subject instructed to return any unused portion of the study drug to 
the investigator(s).  The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy,  or positive pregnancy test must 
be reported to Celgene Safety immediately facsimile using the Pregnancy Report form 
provided by [CONTACT_27718].  
The female should be referred to an obstetrician -gynecologist experienced in reproductive 
toxicity for further evaluat ion and counseling.  
The Investigator(s) will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and 
must notify Celgene Safety of the outcome of the pregnancy as a follow -up on the follow up 
Pregnancy Reporting form.  
If the outcome of the pregnan cy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE 
(i.e., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted 
fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that 
in an aborte d fetus]), the Investigator(s) should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs 
(i.e., report the event to Celgene Safety by [CONTACT_31950] 24 hours of the Investigator’s 
knowledge of the event).  
In the case of a live “normal” birth, Celgene Safety should  be advised by [CONTACT_31950] 24 
hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event.  
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_386763] to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator(s) 
suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported to 
Celgene Safety by [CONTACT_31950] 24 hours of the Investigators’ knowledge of the event.  
If the female is found not to be pregnant, any determination  regarding the subject’s 
continued participation in the study will be determined by [CONTACT_737] . 
 
Overdose  
 
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported 
as an AE. Overdose, accidental or intentional, whe ther or not it is associated with an AE 
should be reported as an AE.  Any sequela of an accidental or intentional overdose of an 
investigational product should be reported as an AE.  
 
If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reporte d on  
an SAE report form. The overdose resulting in the SAE should be identified as the cause of 
the event on the SAE report form but should not be reported as an SAE itself.  
 
In the event of an overdose, the subject should be monitored as  appropriate and s hould 
receive supportive measures as necessary. There is no known specific an tidote for 
apremilast overdose. Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical 
situation and t he judgment and experience of the treating physician.  
 
Overdose for this protocol, on a per dose basis, is defined as ingestion of any more than the 
amount prescribed of apremilast (or matching placebo) tablets in any 24 hour period 
whether by [CONTACT_65802].

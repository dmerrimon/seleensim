demonstrated the critical role of extracellular PDI in regulat ing platelet thrombus formation and 
fibrin deposition in vivo. Employing intravital fluorescence microscopy to monitor a laser -induced 
vascular injury in mice, we observed that inhibition of PDI with either bacitracin, a non -specific 
thiol isomerase inhibi tor, or a specific and inhibitory monoclonal anti -PDI antibody completely 
blocked both platelet thrombus formation and fibrin generation in vivo. The role of PDI in 
thrombus formation is not unique to the laser injury model as similar observations have bee n 
made using carotid artery ligation and ferric chloride injury in mice (Furie, Furie and Bellido -
Martin, unpublished results).  
 
Identification of quercetin as a potent inhibitor of PDI  
Following the observation that inhibitory antibodies against PDI bloc k platelet thrombus and 
fibrin generation in vivo, we became interested in investigating PDI as a novel antithrombotic 
target. Absent a known potent and selective small molecule inhibitor, we performed a high 
throughput screen of 4900 bioactive compounds u sing a turbidometric insulin assay. The 
reduction of insulin by [CONTACT_480807]650 . Notably,

at the 3 position of the pyrone ring. The enzymatic cleavage of the glucose -rhamnose bo nd in 
quercetin -3-rutinoside yields isoquercetin (quercetin -3-O-
-D-glucoside).  
 
Quercetin inhibits thrombus formation in animal models  
Following the identification of quercetin -3-rutinoside and related flavonoids as potent inhibitors 
of PDI, we performed  laser - induced vascular injury experiments in mice and observed inhibition 
of platelet thrombus formation and fibrin generation following intravenous and oral 
administration. A modest dose of oral quercetin (5 mg/kg) yielded a ~50% reduction in platelet 
accumulation and fibrin generation in mice. The PDI -specific nature of this interaction is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_480808].  
 
Quercetin as an anticoagulant in humans  
In order to evaluate the potential antithro mbotic activity of quercetin in humans, d -dimer levels 
were measured in plasma samples following administration of oral quercetin. In this previously 
published clinical trial conducted at University of Utah, study subjects received oral quercetin 
(365 mg t wice daily) for 28 days. Eligible patients were hypertensive and excluded for a history 
of cardiovascular events, diabetes, renal disease, obesity, or active smoking. In four patients 
with baseline elevations in d -dimer (>500 ng/ml) there was a significant  decrease in mean 
plasma d -dimer levels compared with baseline (1198 vs. 462 ng/ml, P=0.056). No change in d -
dimer levels was observed in patients (N=20) with normal baseline concentrations (174 vs. 184 
ng/ml, P=0.97).    
 
The antithrombotic potential of f lavonoids first garnered attention in the 1990's following the 
publication of several large epi[INVESTIGATOR_29820]. In the Zupthen Elderly Study, the group of 
individuals who consumed over 30 mg of flavonoids daily experienced a nearly 70% reduction 
in mort ality from myocardial infarction (adjusted RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 -0.71) compared with 
those individuals who consumed less than [ADDRESS_617868] yielded inconsistent results. Flavonoids such 
as quercetin are known to inhibit p late let function in vitro. The ingestion of either onion soup or 
quercetin -4’-O-
-D-glucoside (the predominant quercetin found in onions) inhibited ex vivo 
platelet aggregation. However there has never been a prospective clinical study on the use of 
quercetin  to specifically prevent thrombotic events in humans.  
 
Quercetin has been used in numerous clinical studies with a long established history of safety.  
The compound recently received the designation of Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by

the FDA. Querce tin (>99.5% purity) will be provided by [CONTACT_480809] (Sudbury, MA) 
which adheres to Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines and previously provided study drug 
for randomized clinical trials conducted in the [LOCATION_002]. Based on our preliminary data, the 
IC50 for PDI inhibition with quercetin analogues is 5 -7uM. While we describe a reduction in d -
dimer levels following an oral dose  
of quercetin at 375mg daily twice daily, the IC50 achieved was only 1.5uM. Recent data 
provided by [CONTACT_480810] (500mg) in combination with ascorbic 
acid and niacin improves both stability and absorption, yielding serum concentrations close to 
5uM. Quercegen Pharma formulates quercetin in chews containing ascorbic acid but formal PK 
studies are lac king. Also, the presence of a glucoside moiety at the [ADDRESS_617869] demonstrated biologic activity and in preliminary experiments using an 
insulin turbidometric assay we observed that purified quercetin -glucoronide inhibited PDI activity 
with greater potency than quercetin o r quercetin -3-rutinoside.  
 
In summary, we previously observed that inhibition of PDI in vivo inhibits platelet thrombus 
formation and fibrin generation in a mouse thrombosis model. Following the identification of 
quercetin and related flavonoids as potent  PDI inhibitors in vitro, we demonstrated 
antithrombotic efficacy in animal models as well as a reduction in d -dimer in humans. Based on 
these preliminary findings and unique antithrombotic mechanism of PDI inhibition, we propose 
to evaluate quercetin as a n antithrombotic in specific patient populations. Prior to initiating these 
trials, we plan to perform a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study to evaluate the 
influence of ascorbic acid and niacin on quercetin/isoquercetin absorption. As planned trials  
include patients at risk of thrombosis such as those with elevated antiphospholipid antibodies, 
will explore pharmacodynamics specifically in this population.

Plasma samples will be used for quantitation of quercetin by [CONTACT_480812] .  
 
Microparticles will be isolated from PFP and PDI activity on the surface of plasma microparticles 
will be measured with a fluorescent substrate (dieosin glutathione disulfide or di -E-
GSSG) per previously described methods (Raturi et al Biochimica et Bi ophysica Acta 
2008;1778:2790 -2796.  
Additional hemostasis -related assays such as microparticle and tissue factor activity will be 
performed using PFP.  
B. Statistical Considerations  
a. Sample Size Justification:   A total of 40 healthy individuals will be 
enrolled in the trial. Data collected from the pharmacokinetic analysis will be 
used to identify the formulation of study drug, either isoquercetin or quercetin 
with or without ascorbic acid. Ten patients per group is the minimum number 
necessary to establish a difference in values of pharmacologic variables (e.g. 
Cmax or AUC) of at least one standard deviation of magnitude with a 0.[ADDRESS_617874] chooses 
not to participate in the second part of the study (i.e. quercetin in co mbination 
with ascorbic acid and niacin) then alternative subjects will be recruited to 
complete the second PK/PD analysis.  
For the cohort with antiphospholipid antibodies or myeloproliferative disorder , 
we plan to enroll 20  patients  (approximately 10 in e ach arm).  The null 
hypothesis is there is no difference in thrombin -induced thrombin generation 
measured at 0 and 4 hours.  The sample size calculation is based on 
preliminary data demonstrating that the mean decrease in thrombin generation 
before and aft er isoquercetin was -54% with a  
standard deviation of mean % difference of .[ADDRESS_617875] analysis for time 0 and 4 hours with a 2 -sided 
alpha of 0.05, the power of the study is 95.8  
 
b.   Data Analysis:   The concentration of quercetin in plasma will be 
determined by [CONTACT_480813]. 
Analysis will include elimination half -life, peak concentration, and area under 
the curve. We will also evaluate an experiment assay  to monitor PDI inhibition 
in plasma using a dieosin glutathione disulfide (di -E-GSSG) to liberate a self -
quenching N -terminal GSSG residue following cleavage of a disulfide bond. 
There is a planned comparison of peak PDI inhibition for the different group s 
and correlation with serum quercetin levels. Statistical analysis will be 
performed in collaboration with Donna Neuberg, PhD and Federico Campi[INVESTIGATOR_480805].

B4. POSSIBLE BENEFITS  
This study will not directly benefit the study subj ects. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies 
of quercetin will facilitate the conduct of clinical trials of quercetin to treat prothrombotic conditions.  
 
 
 
 
B5. POSSIBLE RISKS AND ANALYSIS OF RISK/BENEFIT RATIO  
 
Quercetin is considered safe without  significant toxicities and Quercegen Pharma received GRAS 
designation from the FDA for their quercetin formulation (Inventory Number GRN 341). Quercetin has 
been used in numerous clinical studies with a long established history of safety.  Quercetin or 
isoquercetin (>99.5% purity) alone or in combination with ascorbic acid and niacin will be provided by 
[CONTACT_480809] (Sudbury, MA) which adheres to Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines and 
previously provided study drug for randomized clinical trials con ducted in the [LOCATION_002].  
As a common dietary flavonoid, quercetin has been evaluated in a number of clinical trials with 
different endpoints. Quercetin may lower blood pressure slightly as was demonstrated in a 
randomized trial of 43 individuals treate d with quercetin 365 mg twice daily for 28 days. Both systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure were modestly lower at 28 days in the quercetin treated patients (7 mm 
Hg and 5 mm Hg, respectively) although this effect was not observed in a other studies. No si gnificant 
change was observed with lipid profiles or serum glucose. In a randomized trial of 1002 outpatients 
treated with oral quercetin 500mg or 1000 mg daily for 3 months to prevent upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_58776], there were no significant adverse events reported. In a phase I study where quercetin was 
administered intravenously  at doses greater than 2000 mg, there was evidence of nephrotoxicity in 
several patients.

placement of an IV with subsequent draw of 40cc over the course of 4 hours . Risks associated 
with IV placement and lab draws include pain, ecchymosis, and ra rely superficial 
thrombophlebitis. Some individuals  can experience a vaso -vagal reaction to venipuncture.  
 
B6. RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT PROCEDURES  
Recruitment  
 
Subjects will be recruited at the medical center. Flyers will be posted at different locations a t 
BIDMC and Center for Life Sciences Building (CLS) requesting healthy subjects interested in 
participating in a the study. Investigators will discuss with the protocol with potential subjects 
and provide a consent form describing this study for the subjec ts to review . Recruitment for 
Cohort D will include discussion with rheumatology and hematology staff of potentially eligible 
study subjects. We will also access BIDMC CQ2 database to identify eligible participants who 
have been diagnosed with an antiphosp holipid antibodies. Following identification of potentially 
eligible study subject, physician or nurse will contact [CONTACT_480814]. Based on interest, will be evaluated in clinic and will review consent 
and eligible criteria.   
 
Following consent, inclusion criteria will be reviewed to confirm eligibility for study participation using a 
checklist that will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_480815]. The subjects will be 
given list of fl avonoid -rich foods to avoid [ADDRESS_617879] Protection  
All participants rece iving study  agents will be evaluated for safety . The safety parameters include 
spontaneous reports of adverse events reported to the investigator by [CONTACT_4317].  All toxicities 
encountered during the study will be evaluated according to the NCI criteria (CTCAE 4.0) .  Life -
threatening toxicities will be reported i mmediately to [CONTACT_480816]  and IRB .

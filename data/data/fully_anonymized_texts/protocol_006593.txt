Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ 17  1 Research Protocol: Abstinence Reinforcement Therapy (ART) for Homeless Veteran Smokers  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_68757] C. Beckham, Ph.D.  
 
Cigarette smoking is the most lethal substance use disorder in the [LOCATION_002] in terms of morbidity and mortality  (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008 , Mokdad, et al., 2004) . Unfortunately, smoking 
cessation treatment including smoking cessation aids such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are greatly underutilized ( National Institute of Health, 2006 ). Veterans who are homeless, along with those who have 
mental health or substance abuse problems, are at the highest risk for nicotine dependence  (Tsai, et al., 2011 ). 
Prevalence estimates for smoking among homeless Veterans are 80%  (Tsai & Rosenheck, 2012) . Thus, 
homeless Veterans are at tremendous risk for smoking related morb idity and mortality.  
 Risks associated with smoking among homeless Veterans are also increased because of the high rates of HIV prevalence among persons who are homeless (Reynolds, 2009; Robertson et al., 2004; Culhane et al., 2001) and homeless Veterans specifically (100,000 Homes, 2011). Evidence suggests that there are substantial health implications for smoking among perso ns living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA; Reynolds, 2009). For example, PLWHA 
who smoke compared to those who don’t smoke are at increased ris k of developi[INVESTIGATOR_68758] -related condition 
(Crothers et al., 2005). To our knowledge, the impact of smoking cessation on disease progression among homeless Veterans who are living with HIV/AIDS has not been examined.  
 Smoking cessation efforts among homele ss Veterans to date have been largely ineffective. Even among  754 
homeless Veterans enrolled in mental health, primary care and supported housing at 11 U.S. sites (3/4 of whom had discussed their smoking with a health care professional), smoking was not de creased over a one 
year period. Taken together, this information suggests that smoking needs to be targeted specifically among this high risk population of smokers  (Tsai & Rosenheck, 2012) .  
 The addition of contingency management (CM) to existing evidence -based tele -health smoking cessation 
interventions is expected to be a cost -effective way to increase the reach of intensive smoking cessation 
treatment. CM is a behavioral therapy that provides positive reinforcers (e.g., money, vouchers) to individuals misusing substances contingent  upon objective evidence of abstinence from drug use. Implementation of CM 
has been limited because of the need to verify abstinence multiple times daily with a clinic -based carbon 
monoxide (CO) monitor. As a result, CM has largely been relegated to inpatient and day treatment programs. The application of emerging smart  phone technology, however, can overcome this barrier, and may be 
particularly well suited to homeless Veterans, most of who  use cell phones. We have developed a smart  phone 
application which allows a participant to video themselves several times daily while using a small CO monitor and to transmit the data to a secure server. This innovation has made the use of CM for outpatient smoking cessation portable and feasible, i.e., mobile CM (mCM). The goal of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined tele -health and m CM intervention that we are calling Abstinence Reinforcement 
Therapy (ART) . Proposed is a comparative effectiveness trial with a two -group design in which 165 homeless 
Veteran smokers will be screened and 126 will be randomized to either:  
 
ABSTINENCE REINFORCEMENT THERAPY (ART) , a tele -health intervention that combines guideline -based 
cognitive -behavioral telephone (CBT) counseling, a tele -medicine clinic for access to smoking cessation 
aids including choice of pharmacotherapy , and intensive behavioral therapy through mCM . 
 
VA SPECIALTY SMOKING CESSATION TREATMENT  control , which includes all the elements associated with 
enrollment in a VA specialty smoking cessation clinic including group counseling, individual telephone counseling, self -help materials, and smoking cessation aids including choice of pharmacotherapy.  
Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ [ADDRESS_75269] (Impact = Reach X Efficacy) ( Abrams, et al., 1996 ) on changing health beha vior at the population level, we must 
identify new and innovative strategies to increase treatment intensity, access, and participation. Specific aims are to:  
 AIM 1: Evaluate the impact of ART on rates of abstinence from cigarettes as measured by [CONTACT_68790] -verified, self -
reported prolonged abstinence at post -treatment, and [ADDRESS_75270] -randomization 
follow -ups.  
Hypothesis 1:  Abstinence rates will be significantly higher among homeless Veterans randomized to the 
ART intervention than among  those randomized to the VA specialty smoking cessation intervention 
(primary end -point will be self -reported and bio -verified prolonged abstinence at the 6 -month follow -up). 
 
AIM 2:  Evaluate the relative cost -effectiveness of the ART intervention in quality adjusted life years (QALY).  
Hypothesis 2:  ART will result in greater cost -effectiveness compared to the control condition as measured 
by [CONTACT_68791] -effectiveness ratio.  
 
AIM 3:  Evaluate potential treatment mediators including self -efficacy -related mechanisms.  
Hypothesis 3:  Increased abstinence associated with ART will be partially mediated by [CONTACT_68792] -
efficacy compared to the VA specialty smoking cessation care condition.  
 
Supplementary AIM  1: To evaluate the impact of psychiatric (i.e., PTSD, depression and alcohol abuse) 
symptoms on treatment outcome across the two conditions.  
 Supplementary AIM 2: To evaluate the impact of smoking status on HIV disease progression (presence of AIDS- related illnesses) and disease progression markers (CD4 T -cell count, viral load).  
 The funding source for the study is a VA Rehabilitation Research and Development Merit Review awarded to 
[CONTACT_68854]. Portions of the salaries of [CONTACT_68855]’s  study team are f unded by [CONTACT_68793].  
 METHODS  
 
Participants  
We anticipate consenting and screening [ADDRESS_75271] to be able 
to recruit approximately 165 Veterans in the 36 month enrollment period; we anticipate more than 35 screen 
outs at the screening visit. There are currently over 67,000 Veterans enrolled at the Durham VAMC and approximately 33% of these Veterans are current smokers. There are currently at least 1,231 homeless Veterans with co -morbid nicotine dependence enrolled at the DVAMC. If we enroll only 11% of eligible 
homeless smokers w e expect to achieve our recruitment goal of [ADDRESS_75272] that 10 -15% of our participants will be female, 
and 40% will be minorities.  See Table 1 for a summary of the study’s inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
 
Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ 17  3  
Table 1. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Veterans must meet all inclusion criteria:  Veterans who meet any one of the exclusion criteria 
will be excluded:               
• Homeless  
• Enrolled in the Durham VA for ongoing care  
• Current smokers (at least 10 cigarettes  or 
equivalent daily)  
• Willing to quit smoking in the next 30 days  
 • Has current uncontrolled substance use 
disorder (other than nicotine dependence) that 
would interfere with his/her ability to perform study proce dures  
• Uncontrolled psychotic symptoms  
• Severely impaired hearing or speech (Veterans must be able to respond to phone calls.)  
• Lack of interest in participating in telephone care  
• Pregnancy  
 
There are multiple competing definitions for “homeless.” We will use the definition followed in the most recent VA congressional report ( Perl, 2012) that defines homelessness as one of the following: 1) living in a 
shelter; 2) living in an institution that provides temporary residence; 3) a publ ic or private place not designed 
for regular sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_68759]; 4) imminent loss of housing; and 5) other federal definitions including a) experienced a long term period without permanent house; b) instability as evidenced by [CONTACT_68794]; or c) can be expected to continue in unstable housing due to factors such as chronic 
disabilities.  
 
Recruitment  
Study staff will identify potential eligible Veterans using several different means. First, potentially eligible Veterans may be identified through data pulls from DVAMC’s electronic medical record  using Fileman . The 
study staff will also work closely with staff in the DVAMC’s Healthcare for  Homeless Veterans program to 
identify potentially eligible Veterans. Flyers , informational business  cards  and brochures that have been 
approved by [CONTACT_68795]’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be posted on research bulletin boards, program offices, and clinic areas , including the VA’s Infectious Disease Clinic . In addition, study staff members will visit 
local housing facilities (e.g., shelters, transitional housing developments) to identify potential participants, and 
flyers and brochures will be placed in those community settings. We will also advertise via the closed circuit 
television system within the VA Medical Center. We will post ads in local newspapers and online classified 
advertisement services, including Craigslist.com. A lso, upon approval from the Public Affairs officer, we will 
host informational tables in the medical center. At these informational tables, IRB -approved recruitment 
materials from the study (and from other studies run in the Traumatic Stress and Health Research Laboratory) will be made available to interested veterans, and study staff members may be on site to answer questions about the research studies. No participants will be consented or screened at these public locations.  
 If a Veteran is identified from the electronic medical record, he/she will be sent an introductory letter signed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_68760]. If the electronic medical record reveals that the Veteran has an upcoming appointment at the medical center, that Veteran will be sent a special letter indicating that the study coordinator may be available 
to meet them at their scheduled appointment. T he study coordinator will contact [CONTACT_68796], and ask him/her to mention the study and provide basic information (if willing). The clinician will be asked to introduce the potentially eligible Veteran to the study coordinator in person. The study coordinator would then describe the study, 
Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ [ADDRESS_75273] recruitment in this manner, he/she will also be given the 
option of providing a direct referral via a paper form; see following paragraph. If the clinician indicates unwillingness to assist with recruitment, the study coordinator will not solicit  help from him/her. In both 
versions of the recruitment letter, potential participants will be given an “opt -out” number to call in order to 
decline participation and/or further contact [CONTACT_2301]. Study staff members will perform random spot -checks of names and addresses on 20% of all letters prior to mailing. This will capture any sorting error 
that may have occurred during the preparatory procedures.  Seven business days after the mailing, Veterans 
who have not called the toll free number to decline participation may be called by a study staff member  to 
request their participation in the research study. In the telephone contact, the study staff member  will inform 
the Veteran that he/she was  contact[CONTACT_68797]/she is a homeless Veteran who smokes 
and is  registered for care at DVAMC. Any Veteran who contacts or is contact[CONTACT_68798], and they may choose not to answer any questions that they find too sensitive. Also,  Veterans will be told that their participation will not affect their care at the VA. The study staff member  
will explain the study in detail, including compensation. No study procedures will begin until formal, written 
informed consent has been obtained.  
 
Because Traumatic Stress and Health Research Laboratory has many studies that are currently enrolling participants, we w ill utilize a centralized recruitment strategy in order to “triage” participants into the correct 
studies. We have created a centralized recruitment phone screen and flowchart that reflects our current studies. When any potential participant contacts our centralized recruitment telephone number, the study team member answering the VA phone line will use the centra lized phone screen to det ermine potential 
eligibility. The study team member will then pass along any potential participants’ information to the study coordinator for the appropriate study. That study coordinator will use his/her study -specific phone script to 
further determine el igibility.  
 In conversations with clinicians from several clinics in DVAMC, we have been provided the feedback that they strongly prefer to provide potential participants’ names and contact [CONTACT_3031]. Clinicians have reported that they Veterans often indicate that they prefer that their names and contact [CONTACT_68799].  We’d like to make it easy for interested Veterans to get involved in research, while protected the privacy of those Veterans who are not interested in re search. Towards that end, we have developed a system 
whereby [CONTACT_68800]. We will ask that the clinician or provider provide basic information about the study to potentially eligible Veterans; cli nicians will be provided 
IRB-approved recruitment materials to assist this patient education. If the Veteran is interested in learning 
more about participation, the clinician or provider will provide a “Contact [CONTACT_68801]” information sheet to the Veteran for him/ her to complete. We will request that all “Contact [CONTACT_68801]” sheets will be completed by [CONTACT_68802], not by [CONTACT_13917]. The information sheet includes options for contact [CONTACT_68803] (e.g., send me information, call me, send me information and call me) . If any Veteran prefers to receive information by 
[CONTACT_2319], he/she will be sent the IRB -approved recruitment letter. Any Veteran who prefers to receive information 
by [CONTACT_68804] -approved telephone script. This information sheet will  provide 
“…written documentation that the subject is willing to be contact[CONTACT_68805],” as outlined in VHA Handbook 1200.5. “Contact [CONTACT_68801]” sheets will be delivered to study staff members via secured means (e.g., internal VA snail mail, en crypted Outlook emails with pdf attachments, personal delivery). Any 
sheets sent via internal VA mail will be placed inside a sealed and addressed envelope that is THEN put into the snail mail envelope. This plan has been reviewed with local privacy and information security officers. Similar to VA consults, if any clinician finds use of the “Contact [CONTACT_68801]” sheets to be too onerous, he/she can refer 
Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ 17  5 a participant directly to our clinic by [CONTACT_2306] [INVESTIGATOR_2275] a co -signer to a note in CPRS  
in which the clinician has documented that the participant wishes to be contact[CONTACT_2307].  
 
In order to reach a wider range of homeless Veterans , we will plan to use a recruitment method referred to as 
respondent -driven sampling, or “seed rec ruitment” (Christina Meade, Ph.D., personal communication). Seed 
recruitment is suitable for sampling “hidden populations” of participants who are best known by [CONTACT_68806] (Heckathorn, 1997).  It includes providing incentives to participants for referral of other eligible participants. In our model, each participant, or seed, will receive six  coupons to recruit other Veterans in 
his/her social networks. The recruitment coupons will provide a brief description of the survey and a phone number for contact[CONTACT_68807]. The coupon will be marked with a unique identification number 
(not the study identification number) so that when the coupons are returned to us, the ID number can be used to provide a small payment ($ 25) to the participant  who made the referral. The key connecting the 
participant’s study ID number with the seed ID number will be kept in a database separate from other PHI, creating two layers of separation between the seed ID and the already -participating Veterans’ identifyi ng 
information. Any Veteran who does not wish to recruit in this manner will not be required to do so.  
 There is evidence suggesting that research study branding may be helpful for recruitment and retention of research participants, especially those with low incomes (Nicholson et al., 2011). In order to enhance recruitment and retention, we’d like to use branded recruitment materials and provide branded materials  to 
participants. Branded materials may include banners, tote bags, and plastic bracelets.  Of co urse, any 
participant who does not wish to use the branded materials such as the tote bag will not be required to do so.

for this study, any participant whose urine drug screen is positive will not necessarily be excluded from participation. Exclusion will be based on psychiatric interview results, with drug screen results serving as corroborating evidence for reported abstinence where applicable. Any woman who 
is of child -bearing age 
and/or potential will be given a urine pregnancy test . 
Pregnant women will be excluded from participation.  
 Participants who continue to be potentially eligible will be interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV Diagnosis (SCID; First, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], Gibbon, & Williams, 1994) in order to  
further  determine 
participant eligibility. If during the SCID interview  a 
participant endorses risk for suicidal or homicidal ideation, staff members will follow policy se t out in the 
Traumatic Stress and Health Research Laboratory’s Psychiatric Emergency Standards of Practice.  
 Participants will meet with a study staff member to complete study measures using a RED Cap survey in which 
participants are “interviewed” for surve y answers. We have chosen this method of collection of baseline 
measures because it most closely matches the collection of questionnaire data in the telephone follow -up 
sessions. The baseline survey will include the following measures:

18. Self Efficacy to Overcome Personal Barriers to Cessation, which is a [ADDRESS_75277] session, eligible participants will be rando mized to one of the two treatment groups.  Any Veteran 
who is randomized to the control condition will be informed that a consult will be placed for smoking cessation at this facility’s specialty smoking clinic. Participants will be told that he/she will co ntacted 
approximately nine weeks later, and  at, 3, 6, and 12 -month follow -up sessions, and that they may be

 Any Veteran who is randomized to the ART group will be offered up to a 12 -week course of NRT in the form of 
nicotine patches and up to two rescue methods (e.g., nicotine lozenge). Participants will be screened for 
Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ 17  8 suitability for NRT or other smoking cessation aids (SCA) , including bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]. Veterans will receive tailored 
amount and delivery type  of NRT based on number of cigarettes smoked per day [using an established 
protocol (Bars, et al., 2006 )]. All participants who are medically eligible may  also be prescribed bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]. Any 
eligible participants will be prescribed sustained -release bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], 150 mg/daily for days 1 to 3 and 300 
mg/daily (administered in two daily doses) for the remaining study period.  Participants will be allowed to 
continue bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_68763] 6 mont h follow up visit or their final study visit (if they drop out earlier).  
 NRT will be provided via mail. Should the Veteran want NRT or other smoking cessation aid that is not available over the counter, an appointment will be made for him/her in the medic ation clinic. [CONTACT_56972] will 
write the NRT prescriptions and both [CONTACT_56972] and the study coordinator will work with patient’s primary VA physician to discuss contraindications. In those cases in which a participant reports contraindications to NRT (e.g., high blood pressure not controlled by [CONTACT_12617]) or other contraindications to bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], the study 
coordinator or [CONTACT_56972] will contact [CONTACT_2299]’s primary VA physician in order to obtain authorization to use the study medications. In order to det ermine eligibility to use SCA, study staff will review participants ’ 
self-report measures and available CPRS records for any relevant health information.  This will include, but is 
not limited to, liver function tests where available , because bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_68764], hepatitis, cirrhosis, seizure disorder, and/or uncontrolled diabetes. If a participant with a seizure disorder, history of or current hepatitis and/or cirrhosis, renal impairment, and/or uncontrolled diabetes wishes to enroll in the study, he/she will not receive contraindicated medications. If a participant 
with any of these medical conditions is unwilling to participate in the study without taking bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], he/she will be withdrawn from the study. In addition, any participant who has not had a recent liver function test will be asked to either participate without taking bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_68765] a blood test (to examine liver function) within three months of beginning bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]. Study medications will be administered and delivered through the standard VA pharmacy rather than the research VA pharmacy, as all Veterans are eligible for NRT through the VA pharmacy, and the NRT prescribed is not the focus of the study and does not differ from that offered in the Stop  Smoking Clinic, of which [CONTACT_56972] is the prescribing physician.  
 Participants will be prescribed nicotine skin patches delivering up to 21 mg/[ADDRESS_75278] smokers will be  
prescribed an initial dose of 21 mg patches ; smokers reporting light smoking may be asked to use a lower dose 
patch in consultation with the study physician.  Participants will be provided with detailed information and education regarding the use of the nicotine skin patches. This educational component will include a rationale for usin g the patches, proper placement of the patch, when to use them, possible side effects, and how to 
report side effects to research staff as they may occur in the course of the study. Dosage of NRT will be reduced at two week intervals after it is begun. If a participant indicates any negative side effects of NRT use, dose may be adjusted downward based on the physician’s recommendations. All doses will be logged for later analysis.  Beginning on the identified quit date, participants will be allowed to choose  one acute administration 
“rescue method” of NRT from the following: nicotine gum, nicotine lozenge, nicotine inhaler, or nicotine nasal spray. This rescue method will be used PRN to reduce cravings during the post -quit period.  All medications will 
be mail ed to participants.  
 After randomization, ART participants will receive study equipment , including the smart phone equipped with 
the study app, and CO monitor. Participants will be provided with a manual that summarizes payment information and provides instructions on use of the equipment. The CO breath monitor is a hand- held battery 
operated instrument that measures CO in ppm, and provides an LED reading of CO levels. The smart phone provided to participants will be the Droid Razr Maxx (Motorola Mobility Inc, Libertyville, IL)  or an iPhone 5C .

OS being used for the iPhones is iOS 7.1  in FIPS 140 -2 encrypted mode ; see FIPS 140 -2 certificate 2021. In the 
event that the Droid Razr Maxx or iPhone 5C are  not available in the future, another FIPS -140-2 compliant 
device may be used upon written approval by [CONTACT_68811]’s Information S ecurity Officer (ISO). This policy has 
been developed in conjunction with the ISO. Both phones will be run off the Verizon 4G LTE network  because  
Verizon has the best coverage in North Carolina . It is assumed that most participants will only achieve 3G 
speeds and the methods proposed in this project are based on 3G speed availability.  For each video recording, 
participants will be asked to 1) begin a recording using the smart phone; 2) show the initial zero CO reading to 
the camera; 3) video record him/herself holding his/her breath during the monitor’s countdown; 4) blow into 
the carbon monoxide monitor while on ca mera; and 5) show the final CO reading to the camera. Any video 
recordings taken with the phone remain on the phone until the phone undergoes a hard reset (i.e., upon return to the lab). It is important for this data to remain on the phone because if technical difficulties prevent participants from uploading a viewable video, the study’s technical developer can manually remove the videos from the phone to the web -server. This is important because the readings are crucial to the study’s primary 
intervention,  and are therefore crucial to gathering reliable and valid data. Study coordinators can monitor 
validity and compliance on a daily basis and offer feedback to ongoing participants regarding compensation. Participants will receive training by [CONTACT_68812]; this training session will occur at some time point between sessions 1 and 3, depending on the participant’s chosen smoking quit date. Participants will not begin actual monitoring until after Session 3. If a participant is 
lost to contact [CONTACT_68813]/she should have begun home monitoring (defined as two weeks of no contact [CONTACT_68814]), we will disable the telephone and telephone service, and will only reinstate service if the participant  contacts the laboratory. In order to enhance ability to reach participants easily, to  encourage 
full participation, and to limit losing contact [CONTACT_20688], all participants assigned to ART will be allowed to use the study smart phone to make calls to persons other than study staff and to use the phone for text messaging to persons other than study staff. An ORD ISO reviewed this procedure, and indicated to the facility ISO that we have covered information security well enough to allow partic ipants to use the texting feature on 
the smart phones.

investigator (McFall, et al., 2010 ), and are consistent with the Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guide 
(Fiore, et al., 2000 ). During this session, participants will set a smoking quit date to occur the day of Session 4. 
The telephone counseling intervention will be provided by [CONTACT_44753] ; see  “Staff Training” for a

compensation. Because an escalating versus a fixed reinforcement schedule has produced higher abstinence rates ( Heil, et al., 2008 , 
Stoops, et al., 2009), an escalating schedule 
will be used in this protocol (identical to our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]). Participants can check their compensation level at any time through the application. However, they do not receive their final payment until the mCM treatment and two -week follow -up period is completed.

 Session 7 (both control group and ART participants only). Session [ADDRESS_75286], all 
participants will be asked to rate the helpfulness of any therapy they received. ART group participants will be 
prompted to end NRT use and to continue Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_68770]. ART group p articipants  will be 
asked return their loaned smart phone and CO monitor , and will be provided a postage -paid mailer for the 
equipment return, and will be offered $[ADDRESS_75287] (IRB), ISO, facility Privacy Officer (PO), and other 
appropriate personnel as dictated in the Traumatic Stress and Health Research Laboratory’s Standard Operating Procedures  (SOP) regarding study equipment. This SOP has been previously approved by [INVESTIGATOR_34952]’s ISO, and has been used successfully in by [CONTACT_68815] -approved studies at the Durham 
VA. In addition, we will report any data security and/or privacy issues to the ISO, PO, IRB, and other agencies immediately,  as dictated by [CONTACT_68816]’s Human Research Protection Program SOP.   
 Results of our recent research have suggested that abstinence rates may improve at 3 -month follow -up visits 
when participants are offered a $[ADDRESS_75288] for abstinence (rather than simply money for providing a saliva sample; see Hertzberg et al., 2013 from IRB #1294 and Carpenter et al., in press from IRB #1666). We would like to examine rates of reported abstinence further. Towards that end, prior to Session 8 (3 -month follow -up), 
all participants (control and active treatment groups) will be randomized to two conditions for abstinence 
reinforcement and will be informed of their randomi zation group. Half of all participants will receive $100 for 
biochemically verified  (i.e., salivary cot inine)  abstinence at Session 8  (abstinence incentive) ; half will receive no 
incentive pay for abstinence  at Session 8  (no abstinence incentive) .  
 Following Session 7, the study coordinator will complete a second medical abstraction form for any participant who indicated HIV -positive status at the screening session . 
 Session 8 (both control group and ART participants).  Session 8 will be a 3 month follow -up laboratory visit. In 
this session , participants will be  interviewed regarding general functioning (i.e., Role Functioning Scale), social 
isolation, current cigarette use, nicotine dependence, self -efficacy for quitting and/or remaining quit, and their 
use and adherence with SCAs (e.g., nicotine replacement). Medical records will be reviewed to examine and 
corroborate self -reported SCA use. Veterans in both arms will be asked to evaluate the care they received. Any 
participant who reports a relapse to smoking will be interviewed to determine approximate date of relapse 
using the Timel ine Follow Back method (Lewis -Esquerre, Colby, Tevyaw et al., 2005). We have recent 
experience using this method to assess daily smoking behavior. Because smoking relapse often occurs in the 
context of substance use, we will evaluate alcohol and cocaine use in conjunction with smoking using this procedure. In this session, participants will provide a CO reading and a saliva sample for bio -verification  (see 
Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ 17  12 “Biochemical Verification” below) . Participants will also be asked to provide a urine sample for a uri ne drug 
screen. Urine drug screens will only be used as another source of information regarding substance use. If any 
participant is unwilling or unable to attend an in- lab appointment to complete these study procedures, he/she 
will be allowed to complete the measures over the phone and to mail in a saliva sample. Participants who 
cannot come to the lab for the saliva sample will not be asked to provide a urine sample. Participants  are sent 
instructions, saliva vials, a brief tobacco use assessment (that in cludes use of nicotine replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_68771]), and a postage -paid padded envelope for returning the sample to the study coordinator at 
the VA. The saliva sample will be analyzed for salivary  cotinine, a by -product of nicotine. As  indicated above, 
any participant randomized to the “abstinence incentive” group will receive $100 for self -reported and CO -
verified abstinence at this session.   Session  9 (both control group and ART participants). Session [ADDRESS_75289]. 
In these session s, participants will be interviewed regarding general functioning (i.e., Role Functioning Scale), 
social isolation,  current cigarette use, nicotine dependence, self- efficacy for quitting and/or remaining quit, 
and their use and adherence with SCAs (e.g., nicotine replacement). Medical records will be reviewed to 
examine and corroborate self -reported SCA use. Veterans in both arms will be asked to evaluate the care they 
received. Any participant who reports a relapse to smo king will be interviewed to determine approximate date 
of relapse using the Timeline Follow Back method (Lewis -Esquerre, Colby, Tevyaw et al., 2005). We have 
recent experience using this method to assess daily smoking behavior . Alcohol and cocaine use will  also be 
assessed using the method. At Session 9, any participant who was assigned to the ART condition and used 
bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_68772] a SCA will be prompted to cease use. Participants will be asked to attend a brief appointment in 
the Traumatic Stress and Health Research Laboratory. During this visit, participants will provide a saliva sample  
and urine sample . As stated above, any participant who is unable or unwilling to attend an appointment will 
be allowed to complete the measures over the phone and to mail in a saliva sample.  Only those participants 
who provide a saliva sample in person will be asked to provide a urine sample.  
 Session 10 (both control group and ART participants). Session [ADDRESS_75290]. In this session, part icipants will be interviewed regarding current cigarette use, current e -cigarette 
use, alcohol use, and marijuana use. Participants  will be asked to attend a brief appointment in the Traumatic 
Stress and Health Research Laboratory. During this visit, participants will provide a saliva sample  and urine 
sample . As stated above, any participant who is unable or unwilling to attend an appointment will be allowed 
to complete the measures over the phone and to mail in a saliva sample.  Only those participants who provide 
a saliva sample in person will be asked to provide a urine sample.  
 In order to enhance participant retention at the 6 -month follow -up, we will mail to participants a Veterans’ 
Day card, birthday card, and a “thank you” card. These strategies have been used by [CONTACT_68817] (2006) to increase retention.  
 Biochemical Verification. Self -reported prolonged abstinence will be verified by [CONTACT_68818] -up session. Our choice of primary and secondary smoking endpoints follows recommendations by [CONTACT_68819] (SRNT; Hughes & Brandon, 2003). Self -reported and bio -verified 
prolonged abstinence at the 6 -month follow -up will be the primary end- point. Following definitions used in VA 
CSP-519 (McFal l et al., 2010), we define nonabstinence as smoking (or other tobacco use) for [ADDRESS_75291] two weeks following the quit date (Hughes & Brando n, 2003). Saliva samples will be collected from 
participants who report prolonged abstinence at each follow -up. This process has been shown to improve the 
validity of self -report smoking cessation.  After saliva samples are  collected , they will be sent for analysis to the 
Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ [ADDRESS_75292] cut point off 10 ng/ml to determine abstinence. A blind sample of 5% will be run again to assure test accuracy of saliva samples. Secondary 
smoking outcomes will include 7 - and 30 -day point prevalence abstinence at each assessment, where 
abstinence is defined as no tobacco use in the prior 7 or 30 days respectively (McFall et al., 2010). Any participant who  provides  a saliva sample as requested will be paid $75. We have found in previous IRB 
approved projects (Calhoun IRB # 1415) that participants are unlikely to  provide  saliva for less money than this, 
and given that bioverification of abstinence is crucial to the specific aims of the study, we believe this payment 
is warranted.   
 Following Session s 9 and 10 , the study coordinator will complete medical abstraction form s for any participant 
who indicated HIV -positive status at the sc reening session.  
 
During this study, it is anticipated that participants will miss scheduled telephone contacts. This does not 
necessarily constitute a protocol deviation. If a no -show or a missed appointment causes interruption in study 
activities (such as more than 2 days of missed medications), we will report the missed appointments to the IRB as protocol deviatio ns. Otherwise, the missed appointments will be recorded in study databases as necessary. 
Also, throughout the study, study staff may contact [CONTACT_68820] -related concerns, 
scheduling/rescheduling appointments, or appointment reminders.  
 Optional Study Procedures.  With subjects’ written consent, contact [CONTACT_68821], address, phone number, and dates of research participation along with diagnostic information will be added into a “Contact [CONTACT_2302]”. The purpose of this database is to re -contact [CONTACT_68822]. Potential participants will only be contact[CONTACT_68823]. Beckham and her staff. Only Dr . Beckham and her research staff will 
have access to this database, which will  be housed on the VA Network’s S:\ Drive (path S: \Nicotine 
Research \Study Information \Study Logbooks).  
 Diagnostic, demographic, and questionnaire data and other information collecte d as part of this study will be 
added to a larger database entitled ‘Trauma Database.’ Data coding and complete confidentiality of all subject information in the “Trauma Database” will be accomplished in a three -step process. First, information from 
this s tudy will be coded and will only be linked by [CONTACT_68824]. Second, information 
collected from other protocols run by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Beckham will be coded and linked by [CONTACT_68825]. Lastly, the information will be merged into the larger “Trauma Database” which will be used  for future 
research. Information collected from many study participants (500 or more) from different studies will then be examined to inform researchers about the topic they are trying to learn more about. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_68773], the development of a combined research database is particularly useful.  The purpose of combining information collected from numerous studies is to increase the power of the statistical analysis of genetic, diag nostic, questionnaire and other assessment data. Each study that deposits 
data into the ‘Trauma Database’ repository will not include any of the 18 individual identifiers under the Privacy Rule.  
 Participant Reimbursement. As described in Table 2 above, pa rticipants who are randomized to the control 
group may receive up to $ 460 for full participation in the study. Participants randomized to the ART condition 
may receive up to $ 1038  for full participation. Differential rates of payment for the two conditions are 
Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ [ADDRESS_75293] this additional burden. In each condition, to ensure that patients assigned to the ART group return the CO monitor and phone, we are providing postage paid return mailers and adding a $ 50 
incentive for each equipment return. In order  to enhance rates of equipment return, any participant who 
doesn’t return loaned study equipment will have their final payment decreased by $100.  
 In our previous studies, the follow -up rates for surveys have been consistently less than 75%. We suspect that 
subjects who continue to smoke are less likely to complete the follow- up surveys. Based on our experience in 
our previous HSR&D smoking projects, we are adding a $[ADDRESS_75294] used these incentives in other studies with success (McBride, Bastian, Halabi et al., 2002). If participants report abstinence at the 3 , 6, and 12  month follow -ups, they will be paid $ 75 to provide a saliva 
sample.  
 We will present the overall  payment information in the informed consent document; however, rather than 
describe in detail in the informed consent form the payment details  for mCM  in the ART condition, 
participants assigned to that condition will be provided information about details  of payment in the 
instruction manual “mCM: Mobile Contingency Management Manual. ” We believe that the payment 
information is detailed and thorough, and that this detailed information would not be useful to provide to all 
participants . Rather, we believe that the information is really only relevant to participants in the ART  
condition.  
 Payment will be issued to participants via check, as has been consistent with other telephone -based care 
studies run by [CONTACT_29452]. Checks for payment will be issued through VA Financial Services. VA has 
recently changed payment options such that Veterans who have a bank account are paid through direct deposit into their account. Study staff members are required to complete a “Vendorizing Coversheet ” with 
participants, which includes bank account information. Participants will be informed that payment will be received approximately 4 to 6 weeks after it is requested.  
 For those study visits that occur in the research laboratory, participants in both  arms may be provided with 
local bus passes in order to facilitate transportation.   Staff Training . Of the study measures utilized , only the SCID require s specific training or skills for 
administration (above a BA degree). As in our other studies, multiple diagnostic raters will be utilized over the data collection period. Each rater will be trained using SCID standardized training (i.e., manual, videotapes , 
and co -rating training with a trained rater). Interrater reliability for diagnoses based on videotapes of patient 
interviews across previous studies has been high with a kappa = .96. Additionally, staff providing these diagnostic interviews are trained in use of the Psychiatric Emergency Standards of Practice. Training is completed and supervised by a Master’s level clinician with experience in psychiatric diagnosis, or by [CONTACT_37829].D. level clinical psychologists. Regular clinical supervision is provided on a monthly basis in team interview meetings, and consultation is provided regularly to interviewers.  
 All clinicians who will be providing the smoking cessation counseling intervention will attend a half -day 
training meeting during which they will be trained by [CONTACT_6283]. Calhoun & Beckham, both clinical psychologists who have extensive clinical and research experience providing cognitive -behavioral interventions for smoking 
cessation. After training, counselors will role -play each counseling session with another sta ff member. These 
sessions will be videotaped and rated for fidelity and competence by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Calhoun using the Yale Adherence 
Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ 17  15 and Competence Scale system [YACS; ( Carroll, 2000 )]. Counselors will not be all owed to provide the 
intervention to live participants until they have demonstrated 100% competence and adherence with the 
required elements of each treatment session. During the study, a random selection of twenty percent of all counseling sessions will be  audio -recorded , using a VA approved audio recorder,  and [CONTACT_68856] will rate 
counselor treatment fidelity/adherence using the YACS ( Carroll, 2000 ). Only the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_68774], therefore voice print of the participants will not be collected  during these fidelity 
checks . The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_68775] t hat the phone is not being used on speaker , and we will ask therapi[INVESTIGATOR_68776]. At present, VA records control requirements do not require us to retain audiorecordings that are collected for the purpose of establishing 
treatment fidelity. Therefore, audiorecordings will be deleted from the approved audio recorder after fidelity has been established. The system includes checklists for mea suring critical treatment elements. Fidelity 
feedback will be provided to the counselors. In order to protect against drift, the frequency of fidelity review will occur equally across the beginning, middle, and end of the intervention period. Counselors will attend weekly supervision meetings to review critical points in counseling sessions and receive ongoing consultation.  
 
Rationale for U sing and Description of VA Specialty Care as a Control Comparison . We considered using 
primary  care based smoking cessation care or telephone counseling as the control comparison. Although 
national clinical practice guidelines ( CPG ) suggest that intensive interventions associated with specialty care 
are “more effective than less intensive interventi ons and should be used whenever possible,”  (Fiore, et al., 
2000 ) there is significant disagreement in the tobacco control field regard ing how smoking cessation care 
should be structured ( Sherman, et al., 2006 ). Many experts emphasize treatment in specialty clinics ha s been 
shown to be most efficacious  (Fiore, et al., 2000 ) as well as most cost effective  (Cromwell, et al., 1997 ). Others, 
citing low enrollment rates in specialty care, argue that primary care appro aches should be emphasized ( Stead 
& Lancaster, 2002 ). Sherman and colleagues  (Sherman, et al., 2006 ) assessed the institutional approach to 
implementing tobacco CPG among [ADDRESS_75295] sites emphasized a specialty 
approach and some restricted medications to those attending a specialty  clinic . Thus, our decision to compare 
the ART intervention to specialty care was based both on recommendations from the CPG and evidence 
suggesting that it is currently the preferred approach among VA facilities  (Sherman, et al., 2006 ).  
 The DVAMC has a long history of providing state -of-the-science specialty smoking cessation care. The specialty 
Smoking Cessation clinic currently employs the QuitSmart Program (Shipley et al., 1999) , which was developed 
locally and is now used extensively throughout the VA system. The clinic provides group treatment and telephone counseling provided by [CONTACT_68826] -level psychologists and medicat ion management provided by 
[CONTACT_68827].  Patients receive three group counseling sessions provided over 6 weeks, a telephone counseling 
session following their quit date, NRT (up to three forms), bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_68777] (if multiple quit attemp ts with NRT and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_68778]). The treatment is manualized , which will allow us to easily 
measure which aspects of the intervention were administered to the patient by a review of medical records.  
 Cost -Effectiveness  Measures   
Smoking cessation co unseling alone or in combination with NRT has been shown to be highly cost effective  
(Song, e t al., 2002) . We will estimate the cost and cost- effectiveness of the ART  and VA specialty care . 
Approaches to accounting for costs and outcomes in cost analyses can vary widely. One important variable is 
the perspective taken in the analysis, i.e., the  standpoint from which costs and benefits are realized. 
Consistent with previous work in this area and with expert panel recommendations ( Gold, et al., 1996 ), we 
have chosen to take a broad societal perspective as opposed to the unique perspective of the patient, VHA, or other third -party payer. We considered the measurement of future resource utilization costs as an outcome 
variable, e.g., differences between groups in the costs associated with the number of outpatient and inpatient 
Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ 17  16 visits in the year following the intervention. It is unlikely, however, that groups will differ in smoking -related 
illness visits in the year following the intervention. Thus, consistent with the Public Health Service (PHS) task 
force guidelines ( Gold, et al., 1996 ) we propose to use quality adjusted life year (QALY) as the primary 
outcome.  Additionally, we made decisions regarding cost measurement outcomes. Proposed costs will include 
both intervention delivery costs and participant costs. Costs associated with the development of the interventions will be excluded from the analyses as these costs have already been incurred and are thus “sunk” costs.  
 Costs to be collected can be grouped into two broad categories: intervention delivery costs and participant time costs . Intervention costs incurred to develop both interventions will be excluded from the analysis as 
these costs have already been incurred and are thus “sunk” costs.  
 Costs for both conditions will be estimated using standardized estimates of support staff a nd our 
interventionists. The time it takes to prepare for and execute the intervention used in specialty care is already 
prescribed in the QuitSmart treatment manual. We will use surveys and counselor record to validate these 
estimates. Providers will be a sked to provide time estimates for sessions associated with a subset of 30 
patients randomly chosen to estimate time use ( see below ). Similar methods will be used to estimate time 
spent in preparing advanced clinic access letters and scheduling appointment s (Specialty Care) . The time it 
takes to prepare for and execute the cognitive- behavioral telephone counseling for the ART intervention is 
specified in the treatment manual but will be assessed through a data tracking system (time spent on all intervention  calls will be recorded using interventionist input ). Similar methods will be used to estimate time 
spent in contact[CONTACT_68828]. Our study physician  will 
use a similar data tracking system to measure time  spent administering NRT and other SCAs  to participants.  
The value of time spent on the intervention will be assessed using VA salary and benefits data, and by [CONTACT_68829]. In addition to labor costs, materials costs, includin g the cost of nicotine lozenge, inhaler, mCM and the smart phone, and costs of 
compensation to participants wi ll be collected. [CONTACT_68857]’s group has experience collecting time logs of 
activities  and has published cost effectiveness studies  (Wang, et al., 2012 ). Her group has built proprietary 
database collection applications tailored to the various interventions being studied at the Durham HSR&D Center of E xcellence .  
 Evaluation of participant time c osts will includ e the time spent by [CONTACT_68830], 
techniques, or information. As part of the 3 -month follow -up, time spent on the intervention materials other 
than those involved in the telephone sessions (and attendance to the smoking cess ation specialty clinic) will 
be assessed. In the intervention arm, the number of videos submitted will be used to assess the time involved in providing bio -verification as part of mCM . We will derive participant time cost estimates for individuals in 
each group by [CONTACT_68831], gender, and if possible, race as derived from the Statistical Abstract of the US. Because we chose  to conduct the cost -
effectiveness analysis from the societal perspective, the use of mean wage rates has higher generalizability and validity than self -reported wages by [CONTACT_3038].  
 We propose to estimat e participant time by a random sample of participants at key points in the intervention. 
This is intended to minimize participant burden while collecting reliable measures of participant time use for 
both ART treatment and comparison participants. Specifically, at randomization, 30 patients (15 in A RT and 15 
in Specialty Care ) will be selected randomly to be a part of the time use study. At three different time periods 
in the intervention (1 week, 3 weeks and 6 weeks), participants will be asked  to answer time use questions for 
the full range of the intervention tasks in which they engage (e.g. total time spent recording and uploading 
Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ 17  17 readings for ART participants; time spent receiving feedback for ART participants, or time spent on CBT for 
usual care participants). ART participants will be prompted to answer these questions using their loaned smart 
phone. Control group participants will be contact[CONTACT_68832]. Randomly selecting [ADDRESS_75296] the learning curve of delivering and participating in the intervention by [CONTACT_68833] (and in CBT), yet it will not be announced to patients when the time study will occur so that people do not adjust behavior.  The 
approach for providers will mirror that used for patient time use.   
 The primary effectiveness outcome measure will be quality -adjusted life years (QALYs)  (Fiscella & Franks, 
1996 ). The QALY is a standardized effectiveness measure th at allows for the comparison of the value of a 
particular intervention to a broad range of other potential health care investments. Differences in trial quit rates among Veterans in the ART and control group will allow us to identify changes in the QALY effectiveness measure across groups. To estimate the QALYs, we will employ the methods and estimates developed by [CONTACT_68834]  (Fiscella & Franks, 1996 ), who derived estimates of the increase in QALYs due to smoking 
cessation from published life expectancy data  (Rogers & Powell- Griner, 1991 ), adjusting for the impact of 
smoking cessation on health- related quality of life. For analyses, quit rates at the 6 -month follow -up will be 
utilized. Participants who remain abstinent from smoking at the 6 -month follow -up will be considered 
sustained quitters and assigned an age and gender specific increase in QALY.  
 RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSIS  
 The clinical interview to establish diagnosis can cause some psychological distress in the form of a temporary increase in anxiety, but any ensuing distress is usually well tolerated. There are no known psychological hazards or risks associated with completing questionnaires. Risks also include discomfort related to quitting smoking. Qu itting smoking will cause nicotine withdrawal that may lead to headaches, nausea, irritability, 
weight gain, difficulty concentrating, poor sleep, increased appetite, anxious or depressed mood, and craving for cigarettes. Participants in the ART condition will be offered NRT, and it is likely that participants in the control condition will also be offered NRT. There are risks associated with the use of NRT. Minimal risks associated with wearing a nicotine patch include skin irritation, dizziness, lightheade dness, increased heart 
rate or blood pressure, nausea or vomiting. Risks of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_68779], insomnia, nausea, constipation, headache, shakiness or jitteriness, skin rash, sweating, allergic reaction, change in appetite, weight loss, dizzin ess, tremor, thinking abnormally, hot flashes, worsening depression or suicidal thoughts and 
behavior, and ringing in the ears. At the highest dosage of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_68780], seizures occurred in 1 out of every 1000 (0.1%) who took this drug.  Participants are informed that  they are not 
required to take bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], and will be allowed to participate in the study if they refuse to do so. In both conditions, there is a potential risk associated with the loss of confidentiality of study data.    ART participants have a greater risk of violation of confidentiality and/or privacy in the study. Specifically, collection and transfer of videotaped carbon -monoxide monitoring have risks with regards to privacy and 
confidentiality. We have limited the lik elihood that participant identification will occur by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
method for training participants to provide only their side profile, as a side profile may  not be considered a 
full-face image, and may limit identifiability. In addition, we allow participants to review any videos prior to 
uploading them, and participants may choose to delete any video that they feel violates their privacy. In 
previous studies using this methodology that have been run in the Traumatic Stress and Health Research 
Laboratory, we have had no participant complaints regarding issues of privacy and confidentiality related to 
use of the smart phone videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_4585]. Care has been taken to ensure that data collection and transport is in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_68781]  6500, which addresses information security. Data

Protection of Vulnerable Population. The VA has identified persons who are homeless as an “other vulnerable population.” It is presumed that one of the primary vulnerabilities of this population is the risk of undue influence from monetary compensation. In designing this research intervention, careful conside ration has 
been given to the risk of undue influence. Divergent with our typi[INVESTIGATOR_68782] , which includes compensation for 
attendance at most or all study sessions, we have designed the study such that compensation is mostly based on obtaining and maintaining abstinence from smoking, especially within the ART condition. Within the control group, more than 55% of the total possible payment is related to smoking abstinence. In the ART 
condition, more than 70% is related to smoking abstinence. We believe that th e risk of undue influence is 
greatly diminished with this design, and that the potential health benefits of smoking cessation greatly outweigh the risk of influence through compensation for cessation.  
 DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING  
 Quitting smoking should enhance rather than jeopardize health status, and potential serious adverse events (SAE) for participants in this project are not expected. Regardless, we will minimize potential risk by [CONTACT_68836]. In the ART condition, thos e with contraindications for NRT will require 
medical clearance by [CONTACT_68837]. Similar 
clearance is often required of Veterans enrolled in DVAMC’s specialty smoking cessation clinic.  
 The individuals responsible for data safety and monitoring will be the PI, the project manager, and the Study 
Physician. The Study Physician for this trial will be Scott Moore, M.D., Ph.D. [CONTACT_56972] is a board certified general psychiatrist, and is the treat ing physician of the DVAMC’s specialty smoking cessation clinic. As the 
Study Physician, [CONTACT_56972] will ensure participants are medically cleared to participate in this trial and will review all reports of adverse events (AEs) sent by [CONTACT_68838].  [CONTACT_68858] will serve as a backup 
prescriber.  
 Further data safety and monitoring will be provided by [CONTACT_978]. There will be several ongoing mecha nisms for 
monitoring and reporting of adverse events: 1) ongoing participant contact [CONTACT_2317], 2) a toll -free 
number provided to participants to report concerns related to study participation; and 3) weekly meetings 
Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ [ADDRESS_75298] manager’s phone, will be provided to all participants 
upon entry into the study.   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_2278]’ reactions to the intervention, proper delivery of the  intervention, and any adverse events or unanticipated problems. Monthly meetings 
between the investigators and the project manager will allow for ongoing progress reports, including the number of participants currently involved in the study groups, attrition rates, and scheduled data collection from participants, as well as notification and review of any AEs. Safety monitoring for adverse events (AEs) will be conducted in real time by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or project manager. The following information about adverse e vents 
will be collected: 1) the onset and resolution of the AE, 2) an assessment of the severity or intensity (use existing grading scales whenever possible), 3) an assessment of the relationship of the event to the study 
(definitely, probably, possibly or  not related), and 4) action taken (e.g., none, referral to physician, start or 
increase concomitant medication). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_2279], will assign attribution to 
the event, and will monitor the event until its resolution. Any adverse events will be reported to the IRB in accordance with the local Human Research Protection Program’s Standards of Practice.  
 DATA MANAGEMENT AND SECURITY  
 
Several types of data will be collected over the course of the study. As described under the Request for Waiver 
or Alteration of Informed Consent and HIPAA Authorization for Research, PHI to be collected during recruitment activities includes name, address , telephone number , and social security number. Other data to 
be collected over the course of the study (as described in the HIPAA authorization ) include name; address; 
phone number; social security number; dates of study visits;  account numbers (for Veterans who have bank 
accounts, payment will be issued via direct deposit, which requires a Vendorizing Coversheet that asks for account information and VA Form 10 -7078 to be obtained),  and images potentially comparable to a full -face 
image. Sources of health information include medical history and physical exam information, videorecordings, 
saliva and urine specimens, progress notes in CPRS, laboratory test results, survey responses, alcohol and/or drug use information, and mental health notes. This informatio n will be used for research purposes  only .  
 Any hard copy data collected over the course of the study will be stored in a locked file cabinet in a locked office suite in the Traumatic Stress and Health Research Laboratory at the Durham VA Medical Center. Hard copy data will include, but is not limited to, any information gathered from potential participants during the telephone screening process, participant consent forms and HIPAA authorization forms, laboratory test results, and VA forms [ADDRESS_75299] will be a computer assisted telephone interviewing system that will facilitate the collection of patient measures at baseline, end of treatment, and 3 and 6 -month follow -up. The primary database engine technology underlying this system will 
be the MySQL database server hosted by [CONTACT_68839]  (VIReC). MySQL is a relational 
database management system. The coded data collected during telephone interviews  will be managed using 
REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the Department of Veterans Affairs' VIReC. We have chosen REDCap because it facilitates the easy development, collection and entry of research data, it is available at no 
Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ [ADDRESS_75300], and it is  hosted within and only accessible from the VA's intranet. All data collected can be exported into 
a number of standard formats including SAS, MS Access, and SQL.  
 
Second , the study team will develop a MS Access tracking database that will electronically track participants 
through all components of the study. This tracking data will contain identifiable data, including the key that 
links participants to study identification numbers; other data  collected in the course of the study will be kept 
separately fro m identifying information. This database will be stored on a VA secured computer server 
(S:\Nicotine Research \Study Information\ Study Logbooks ) that is encrypted, password -protected, and only 
accessible by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Beckham  and study staff. The key to seed recru itment coupons that connects the 
participant’s study ID number with the seed ID number will be kept in a database separate from other PHI, creating two layers of separation between the seed ID and the already -participating Veterans’ identifying 
information . 
 We have used similar methods of data entry in our prior studies, and internal audits show excellent reliability. All data transactions within and between systems will run through controlled, secure transactions to ensure 
the preservation of database integr ity and privacy. Of primary importance in all study activities will be the 
security and protection of Veterans’ private health information (PHI). All staff will complete educational 
modules designed to improve good clinical practices, improve protection of  participant privacy, and promote 
information security and research compliance. Participants’ identifying information will only be available to [CONTACT_68855]  and the research staff at the VA Medical Center. If any staff member leaves the research staff, 
he/s he will be removed from the staff listing, and access to the study’s data will be immediately withdrawn. 
The key and other study data will be kept in accordance with VA records control requirements, and if destruction is required by [CONTACT_68840], research data will be destroyed in accordance with 
VA records control requirements. As mentioned above, audio recordings made for treatment fidelity review will be deleted after review.   Within the ART arm of the study, we have developed several wa ys to minimize data security risk with video -
tapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Participants will be specially trained to provide only partial- face images during the videos , and we ask 
participants not to speak while making a video so that a voice print is not collected . The smart p hone is 
programmed such that a staff member will set up the telephone and enter the participant’s code into the phone. When the participant chooses to upload a video, they upload the video directly from the phone to a secured website (see below for further  information about the website), and the phone programming ensures 
that the video is uploaded into the correct participant’s area of the website. This ensures that study participants’ data is stored in the correct place, and that study participants cannot view any other participants’ data. Participants are asked to review their videos before posting, and they can choose not to upload any video that they don’t wish to upload for any reason. Please see “Study Procedures” for more information about the technology used in the study.  
 For the study’s website, we will use shared server space provided by [CONTACT_68841], Inc . The study url is 
https://www.calhounlab.com
. Server space is currently used through a Duke Univer sity contract, and is shared 
with other VA and Duke IRB -approved studies run in the Traumatic Stress and Health Research Laboratory (PIs 
[CONTACT_68855] and Calhoun). We will be using AES -[ADDRESS_75301], and 
the data being transferred is encrypted at transfer (AES -256) . Website properties indicate TLS 1.0, AES w/ 128 
bit encryption (High); RSA with [ADDRESS_75302] access to the secured server at InMotion Hosting; the encryption key is held only by [CONTACT_20229]. This will ensure all video uploads and data that the participant sends over the internet via their phone s will only be transferred 
Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ [ADDRESS_75303] identifiers are placed on the  website. Videos are stored via study ID number, and participants are trained to provide side 
facial images without voice imprint. InMotion also runs audits regularly of the websites hosted within their shared servers to prevent scriptside vulnerabilities,  as well as having a 24/7 support team monitoring their 
servers. The web application written for this study has been checked for SQL injection, Code Injection, XSS, and RFI vulnerabilities and has passed. The site will only be accessible by [CONTACT_68842] 512 -bit SHA -2 hashed passwords.  
 In order for data analysis to occur using MplusV7 software and SAS software (see “Data Analyses” below), a coded  dataset will be sent to VINCI for analysis using VA -owned data analysis  software (SAS).  In the event that 
MplusV7 software or appropriate SAS modules for analysis are not available through VINCI, coded  data will be 
moved to Duke University Medical Center for analysis. Any data movement outside the protected VA environment wil l be accomplished using a VA -issued and owned FIPS -140- [ADDRESS_75304] access; data are encrypted at rest.  
 DATA ANALYSES  
 The study is a randomized two -arm parallel group, longitudinal trial. The primary analysis will be based on 
intention to treat principles; the overall intervention effect will be measured for the entire sample assuming participants have foll owed their randomized assignment.  The main conclusions drawn from this trial will be 
based on the pre -specified hypotheses outlined below and will be tested with two -sided p -values at the 
standard 0.05 level. Statistical analyses will be performed using SA S (Version 9:  SAS Institute  Cary  NC) and 
Mplus V7.   
 Missing Data and Attrition Rates . Because the main predictors of interest, treatment group and 
demographics, are collected at baseline, we do not anticipate much missing data. We do, however, anticipate missing values in the longitud inal outcomes owing to dropout or an inability to reach the patient by [CONTACT_648]. 
The primary analysis will be based on intention to treat principles and will use a missing=smoking approach (treating those who dropped out of the p rogram as current smokers).  Although conservative, this approach 
produces an estimate of the verifiable efficacy of the intervention based on a representative sample rather than a potentially inflated estimate based on an unspecified sub- sample  (An, et al., [ADDRESS_75305], et al., 2005 ) 
and is recommended by [CONTACT_68843]  (Hughes, et al., 2003 , Hughes, et al., 2004 ).  
 Hypothesis 1:  Abstinence rates will be significantly higher among Veterans randomized to the ART 
intervention as compared to those randomized to VA specialty smoking cessation clinic . Rates of abstinence 
from cigarettes (self -reported prolonged abstinence) will be assessed at post -treatment, 3 -months , 6-months , 
and 12 months  follow -up. At each time point, abstinence will be measured as a dichotomous variable  
(abstinent or not ). Self-report of abstinence will be validated with saliva testing of cotinine levels. The primary 
endpoint is abstinence rate at [ADDRESS_75306] for a between -group difference in the proportion of V eterans with bio -verified abstinence from 
cigarettes at the primary, 6 -month follow -up. This logistic regression model can be written: Logit(p
i) = β0 + 
ART i*β1 , where p i represent the probability that patient i  has abstained from smoking at 6 -months of follow -
up. In this model, ART i indicates whether or not patient i  is in the ART intervention  group of the study; 
therefore, β1 represents the log -odds ratio of smoking abstinence in the ART group as compared to the 
Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ [ADDRESS_75307] over time using a repeated measures logistic regression model, in 
which the model parameters are  estimated using generalized estimating equations methodology (GEE). GEE 
methodology allows the relationship between the response and explanatory variables to be modeled 
separately from the correlations resulting from clustering of repeated measurements within each subject. The regression coefficients from a GEE model have essentially the same interpretation as those from a cross -
sectional regression analysis (e.g. logistic regression) but are more appropriate as they properly incorporate the longitudinal structure of the data. The predictors in the model will include intervention arm (a 2 -level 
variable) an d a time effect (post -treatment, 3-months and 6 -months). Time will be considered as categorical 
and we will explore whether an exchangeable, unstructured, or AR(1) correlation structure is most appropriate to take into account the within -patient correlation between the repeated measures over time. 
GEE modeling will be performed using the SAS PROC GENMOD.  
 As participants are aware that  their self -report will be evaluated by [CONTACT_68844], the majority of 
reports are concordant with test results (> 90% in our current trials). For a ny discrepancies between self-
report and biochemical verification, we plan to determine the sensitivity of model estimates when using results of cotinine assays as the dependent variable.  
 Hypothesis 2:  ART treatment will result in greater cost -effectiveness as measured by [CONTACT_68791] -
effectiveness ratio. The cost data from the VHA Databases and participant surveys will be utilized to calculate cost-effectiveness.  The economic analysis will follow the guidelines developed by [CONTACT_68845] -
Effectiveness in Health and Medicine  (Gold, et al., 1996 ).
 We will employ the societal perspective (i.e., all costs 
incurred by [CONTACT_68846], the VA health care system, and the individual 
participants, including medical, non -medical, productivity), with secondary analyses from the VA health care 
system perspective. The VA health care syst em perspective, which is most relevant to VA decision makers, 
excludes the direct non- medical costs borne by [CONTACT_68847], such as the costs of their time.  Data on the effects 
and costs of the interventions will be used to estimate the incremental cost -effecti veness, or ICER (US$ per 
QALY) comparing the ART intervention to VA specialty smoking cessation intervention. The incremental cost -
effectiveness ratio R is expressed as: R = ( µCT - µCU) / (µET - µEU), where µ  denotes the estimated mean for CT 
(cost of ART intervention ), CU (cost of specialty smoking cessation intervention), ET (effect of ART), and EU 
(effect of specialty smoking cessation intervention). T ime duration  of the economic analysis will be [ADDRESS_75308] probabilistic sensitivity analysis (2nd order Monte Carlo simulation). Parameter 
estimate ranges with appropriate distrib utions will be used for the various intervention and participant times, 
wage rates, NRT costs, and QALY effectiveness measures in conducting the decision model simulation. We will present our results as means (with CIs), incremental cost -effectiveness anal ysis scatterplots, cost -effectiveness 
acceptability curves, and one -way sensitivity analysis of model variables that drive the results  (Briggs, et al., 
2006 , Willan & Briggs, 2006 ). 
 Hypothesis 3:  The ART treatment effect will be partially mediated by [CONTACT_68792]- efficacy compared to the 
control condition.  The self -rating of efficacy collected across study time period will be utilized to evaluate this 
meditational hypothesis. If there is a significant intervention effect upon smoking cessation at [ADDRESS_75309] effects. 
Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ 17  23 Relative to conventional tests of mediation, such as Sobel’s z, which do not account for this skew and 
therefore inflate the standard error of the indirect effect, bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_68783]. 
Mediation analyses will use standard linear and logistic regression modeling approaches and will be con ducted 
with Mplus v7.  Considering that self- efficacy will be measured at four time points —baseline, post -treatment, 
3-month follow -up, and 6 -month follow -up—we will also examine whether differences by [CONTACT_68848] -efficacy from time point to time point. Using 
linear and logistic GEE models and following mediation procedures for nested data  (Krull & MacKinnon, 1999 ), 
we will first examine differences in abstinence by [CONTACT_68849] t (post -treatment, 3 -month follow -up, and 
6-month follow -up), controlling for abstinence at time t -1 (baseline, post -treatment, and 3 -month follow -up). 
This is equivalent to modeling group differences in change in abstinence rates over the course of the study  
(Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002 ). We will then test differences by [CONTACT_68850] -efficacy at time t -[ADDRESS_75310] of psychiatric symptoms (i.e., PTSD, 
depression, and alcohol abuse symptoms) on abstinence rates, analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_68851] (psychiatric symptoms vs. none)  and its interaction with the intervention in dicator to the 
statistical models described above under hypothesis 1. The interaction term will be tested to determine if the treatment effect is consistent across the levels of the subgroup variable at 3 and 6 -month follow -ups.  
 Supplementary Aim 2: To d etermine the impact of smoking status on HIV disease progression parameters, 
presence of AIDS -related illnesses, CD4 T -cell count, and viral load at each time point will be modeled via 
multilevel modeling as a function of concurrent smoking status.  
 
Sampl e Size Considerations . Power calculations provided below were performed with Power Analysis and 
Sample Size software (PASS, Version 12: NCSS LLC, Kaysville, Utah) . The sample size estimate is based on the 
first hypothesis; i.e., the ART intervention will result in higher  quit rates from cigarettes at [ADDRESS_75311] -
randomization  and was calculated for a logit -linked logistic regression model with a two -sided type -I error rate 
of 5%. Six months was chosen as the primary endpoint as it is generally recognized as the standard follow -up 
duration for reporting data from clinical trials and is consistent with the SRNT  recommendations  (Hughes, et 
al., 2003 ). As described in the analysis section, we are adopting a missing=smoking approach as recommended 
by [CONTACT_68843]  (Hughes, et al., 2003 , 2004) and all randomized patients will be included in the analyses. That is, 
any participant who is randomized and drops out will be counted as a smoker. Our estimates below reflect this method.  
 Because homeless smokers are typi[INVESTIGATOR_68784], there are few data that 
directly address potential efficacy of existing smoking cessation interventions in this population. For example , 
while there is evidence that provider contact [CONTACT_68852] a measurable effect on smoking cessation in non- homeless smokers  (Fiore, et al., 2000 ), physician contact [CONTACT_68853] a 
study of 754 homeless persons including homeles s Veterans  (Tsai & Rosenheck, 2012) . Using administrative 
data  we calculated the observed Impact of usual VA specialty care for homeless smokers.  In a random sample 
of homeless smokers (N=100) with an address in Durham county we found that 46% were referred to Specialty Smoking Cessation Care. Of these, [ADDRESS_75312] one session of the intervention 
resulting in reach defined as 24% (11 of 46). Estimates of attendance rates for VA specialty care in non-homeless Veterans range from 6% to 30%  (Sherman, et al., 2005 , Yano, et al., 2008) and in our quality 
improvement evaluation of DVAMC specialty care  we found that only 16% of non -homeless Veterans referred 
to specialty care attend at least one session.  Among those acce ssing care , only 3 completed the program (73% 
Protocol, PI [INVESTIGATOR_68756] 7/21/ 17  24 attrition rate) and only one V eteran quit smoking. Thus, the observed  efficacy was 9% (1 of 11 V eterans who 
received any treatment quit smoking). The resulting impact of specialty care would equal  2% where Impact =  
Reach (.24) X Efficacy (.09). Note , drop -outs  are included in this  calculation of efficacy  as treatment failures . 
Even if the efficacy of VA specialty smoking cessation care was as high as the average efficacy rate observed 
for intervent ions that combine multiple treatment formats including self -help materials, group counseling, a nd 
telephone counseling, i.e., 23% (95% CI, 19.9% -26.6%) among non -homeless smokers  (Fiore, et al., 2000 ), 
specialty care  impact  would only approach 5 %.  Thus, we expect the overall quit rates (impact)  of specialty 
care to fall between 2% and 5 %. 
 Cessation  rates for ART  are based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]. Five homeless Veterans were randomized to active mCM 
in our first pi[INVESTIGATOR_68785] [ADDRESS_75313] study  of PTSD smokers , the observed efficacy rate was 40% (2 V eterans quit  and remained 
abstinent at 3 months; 1 dropped out of treatment (20% treatment attrition) and did not quit; 2 did not 
respond to the 3 -month follow -up are presumed to be smoking ). In the open trial, 3 -month efficacy rates 
among the 20 Veterans are 65%.  Collapsing across  these trials  (n=25 ), observed 3 -month cessation rates are 
60%. This rate is consistent with observed short term (end of treatment) quit rates in similar CM interventions  
with  non-homeless populations  [e.g.,  (Alessi, et al., 2004 , Roll, et al., 1996 )]. We have included a  6-month 
follow -up in our open trial of homeless smokers and the current bio-verified efficacy rate (missing=smoking) at  
6-month s is 57% ( 8 of 14  who are eligible for a 6 -month follow -up remain abstinent ). We conservatively 
powered the trial with the expectation that there will be a larger relapse rate between [ADDRESS_75314] observed  (see Gilpen, et al., 1997 , Zhou, et al., 2009 ); thus we expect the 6- month quit rate for 
ART will fall between 22%- 32%.  Based on a [ADDRESS_75315], alpha=.05, we would need to enroll between 24  
subjects (e.g., 2 % vs 32%) or up to 63 subjects (e.g., 5 % vs. 22%) in each arm to achieve 80% power to detect 
expected differences and will randomize  a total of [ADDRESS_75316] of members representing consumers (e.g., homeless smokers, providers), family members, and content experts in homelessness, and will be led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Eric

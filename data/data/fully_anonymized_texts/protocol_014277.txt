Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 24-Aug-[ADDRESS_769952] be conducted every 4 weeks (-1/+3 days) relative to the first 
dose of study medication until disease progression, death or withdrawal of consent. The date of progression, best 
response and date of response used in the effic acy analysis will be based onthe independent review committee 
(IRC). Subjects will be followed at least every 16weeks, or more frequently, after disease progr ession for survival 
and subsequent myeloma therapy. Cross -over between the arms is not permitted.
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review the safety of the trial on a routine basis. In addition 
there will be an interim analysis for safet y and efficacy once the following two conditions have been met: at least 
338progression events (70%) have been observed and all subjects have been randomized.
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity analysis will be collected in all subjects who received 
elotuzumab.
Study Population :
Subjects who are newly diagnosed w ith symptomatic Multiple Myeloma and who:
have not received any prior systemic anti -myeloma therapy AND
have measurable disease AND
are not candidates for high -dose therapy plus s tem-cell transplantation because of age ( 65 years) or coexisting 
conditions
Study Assessments and Primary Endpoint : 
Tumor response assessment by [CONTACT_585544] w ill be evaluated during the trial for all randomized subjects. An IRC 
(Independent Review Committee) will conduct a blinded, independent review of these tumor assessments. The 
primary endpoint of PFS will be based on the IRC assessment. 
Statistical Methods :
Power
The primary objective in this study is to compare PFS between treatment groups at the two-sided, 5% type I error 
rate. There will be 1 interim analysis of PFS, which will allow  for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_540107]. An O’Brien and
Fleming function will be em ployed to determine the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_585525]. The com parisons of PFS 
will be carried out using log-rank tests stratified by [CONTACT_585545] (International Staging System 1 -2 versus 3), 
ECOG performance status (0 versu s 1 -2), and age (< 75 years old versus 75years old).
Approximately [ADDRESS_769953] 
482progression events (as per IRC) , ie, documented progressions or deaths. Four hundred eighty two (482) events 
ensure that a two-sided test procedure with a family -wise type I error rate of 5% and 1 interim  analysis after 70% of 
the total events (338) will have 90.5% power if the median PFS times in the control and experimental arms are
25and 33.[ADDRESS_769954] 
after 354deaths, which is projected to occur 7years (84months) after the initiation of the study. An O’Brien and 
Fleming -spending function will be used to obtain the nominal significance levels for the interim and final analyses 
of survival. Three hundred and fifty-four (354) deaths ensure that a two-sided 5% level sequential test procedure 
with one interim analysis will have80% power for a 8.7percentage point improvement in 4-year survival rate from 
59.0% to 67.7%, ie, for a HR = 0.74.
Power calculations were done using East v5.1 software. (See Section 8.1, Sample Size Determination, for more 
detail.)
Endpoint Definition s and Analyses
The primary endpoint in this study is progression -free survival (PFS), which is defined as the time from 
randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression, as determined by [CONTACT_585546], 
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 24-Aug-[ADDRESS_769955] tumor assessment.
The follow ing censoring rules will be applied to PFS:
Subjects who receive system ic secondary anti-myeloma therapy prior to documented progression will be 
censored on the date of their last tumor assessment prior to initiation of new therapy
Subjects who have an event > [ADDRESS_769956] prior 
assessment
Subjects who do not progress and who do not receive subsequent therapy will be censored at their last tumor 
assessment
See Section 8.3, Endpoint Definitions, for more detail on the definition of PFS.
A stratified log -rank test w ill be used to compare PFS between treatment arms. The factors w ill be the same as those 
used in the randomization. The hazard ratio of the experimental to the control arm and corresponding tw o-sided 95% 
confidence interval will be calculated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model with treatment as the sole 
covariate. The Kaplan -Meier product limit method w illbe used to display PFS curves and PFS rates at [ADDRESS_769957] been follow ed for the appropriate 
time.
The key secondary endpoints are:
Objective response rate
Overall survival
Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of randomized subjects who have a best overall response 
ofpartial response orbetter . Overall survival is the time from randomization until death. Subjects who do not die 
will be censored at the date of last contact.
A hierarchical procedure will be used to ensure a two sided family -wise type I error rate of 5% for testing the one 
primary and two key secondary endpoints. If there is a statistically significant improvement in PFS, then ORR will 
be com pared betw een arms at the two -sided 5% level. If the comparison of ORR is also statistically significant, then 
survival will be comp ared between arms using a two -sided 5% level sequential test procedure. 
Objective response rate will be compared between randomized arms using a two-sided 5% level Cochran -Mantel 
Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_585547]. An associated odds ratio and 
95% confidence interval will be calculated. The response rate and its corresponding 95% confidence interval will 
also be calculated for each treatment arm. There w ill be no interim comparison of this endpoint.
Survival willbe compared between treatment arms using two-sided, stratified log-rank tests at the interim and final 
looks. The family -wise type I error rate for the sequential testing procedure will be 5% and the stratification factors 
will be the same as those used for the randomization. The significance level at the interim  and final analyses of 
survival will be determined using an O’Brien and Fleming spending function.
Other Secondary endpoints include change from baseline in mean score of pain severity and mean score of pain 
interference using the BPI -SF. The tw o endpoints will be tested at the 2 -sided 2.5% level each and will not be part of 
the hierarchical testing procedure. For these two endpoints, comparison will be conducted using a longitudinal 
mixed model with treatment arm and time point (categorical) and baseline score as fixed effects and a banded 
covariance matrix (covariances are constant on each diagonal of the matrix).

study , and after any  revisions ar e completed for new information
5)If informed consent is initially  given by a subject’s legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently  becomes capable of making and communicating their 
informed consent during the study , then consent must additional ly be obtained from the 
subject
6)Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093], 
should fully inform the subject or the subject's legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study  and of any new information relevant to the 
subject's willingness to continue participation in the study . This communication should be 
documented

Tumor assessments, based on the EBMT criteria, will be conducted every  4 weeks (-1/+3 days) 
relative to the first dose of study  medication until disease progression, death or withdrawal of 
consent. The date of progre ssion, best response and date of response used in the primary  efficacy  
analyseswill be based on the independent review committee (IRC) assessments as well as the 
investigators . All subjects must continue to have protocol -specified tumor assessments until 
disease progression (even if the subject is off study  therapy  or has started on a new anti -myeloma 
therap y, as specified in the ITT definition of PFS in Section 8.3.1), death, or withdrawal of 
consent from the study . Once subjects reach disease progression, they shall be followed at least 
every  16weeks after disease progression for overall survival and subsequent myeloma therapy . 
Cross -over between the arms is not permitted.
An independent DMC will conduct regular safet y reviews throughout this trial . In addition, there 
will be a pre-planned interim anal ysis for safety  and PFS once the following two conditions have 
been met: at least 338 (70%) progression events have been observed perIRC and all subjects 
have been randomized. 
Subjects who receive any non-protocol specified systemic anti-myeloma therap y prior to 
documented progression will be discontinued from study  treatment (see Section 3.5). However, 
tumor assessments should continue at [ADDRESS_769967] y 
with the int ent to treat analy sis (Section 8.3.1).
Subjects will continue to be followed until the last subject has the last follow -up visit which is 
projected to occur approximately  [ADDRESS_769968] Study  Access to Therapy
At the conclusion of the study , subjects who continue to demonstrate clinical benefit will be 
eligible to receive study drug. Study  drug will be provided via an extension of the study , a 
rollover study  requiring approval by [CONTACT_52228] y and ethics commi ttee or 
through another mechanism at the discretion of the sponsor. The sponsor reserves the right to 
terminate access to study drug if any of the following occur: a) the marketing application is 
rejected by [CONTACT_20429] ; b) the study  is terminated due to safet y concerns; 
c)thesubject can obtain medication from a government sponsored or private health program; or 
d) therapeutic alternatives become available in the local market.

3.2.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects should be encouraged to continue participation in the trial until the laboratory  definition 
of disease progression is met (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Subjects who discontinue study  therap y before 
progression (eg, due to toxicity ) should be encouraged to allow the necessary  laboratory  results 
(eg, M-protein data, radiologic data, calcium results) to be collected until progression criteria are 
fulfilled, even if the subject is on subsequent therap y (as per the PFS ITT definition in 
Section 8.3.1). These data can be obtained by [CONTACT_423]’s local health care provider or the site 
staff and then anal yzed and entered into the CRF/database by  [CONTACT_585550]. Withdrawal 
of consent should be minimized because:
1. T he subject in this trial who discontinues study  therap y before progression will most likely  
subsequently  be followed in any case by a healthcare provider locall y or at the site via 
routine standard of care assessments (ie, monthly  M-protein data, calcium, etc) and
2.In most cases, this protocol would not require any additional samples beyond those 
considered standard of care
If there is uncertaint y about the progression criteria, investigators are encouraged to contact [CONTACT_448307]/study  director prior to:
1.starting a subject on another my eloma regimen or 
2.performing the end of tre atment visit for progression
Subjects who request to discontinue study  drug will remain in the study  and must continue 
protocol specified follow -up procedures. The only exception to this is when a subject specifically 
withdraws consent for any further contact [CONTACT_35859]/her or persons previously  authorized by 
[CONTACT_20439]. Subjects should notify  the investigator of the decision to 
withdraw consent from future follow -up in writing , whenever possible. The withdrawal of 
consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by  [CONTACT_093] (and entered onto 
the appropriate CRF page), as to whether the withdrawal is from further:
1.study  medication but subject is willing to continue to perform visits for PFS follow -up. study  
medicat ion and study  visits for PFS but agrees to provide the results of future myeloma 
assessments from another site/local site
2.study  treatments, results from another site/local sites, but agrees to be contact[CONTACT_585551]-up
In the event that vital status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly 
available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriatel y directed in 
accordance with local law.
3.2.[ADDRESS_769969] to 
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 24-Aug-[ADDRESS_769970]’s medical records. If it is determined that the 
subject has died, the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death. 
If investigator’s use of third- party representative to assist in the follow -up portion of the study  
has been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a 
Sponsor -retained third- party  repres entative to assist site staff with obtaining subject’s contact 
[CONTACT_35864] -up portion of the 
study . The site staff and representative will consult publicly  available sources, such as public
health registries, obituary  listings, and databases, in order to obtain updated contact [CONTACT_3031].

[IP_ADDRESS] Premedication Regimen in Subjects Without a Prior Infusion Reaction 
Consult the Sponsor for further guidance regarding premedication management eg,alternative 
medications for subjects allergic or intolerant to any premedication or to determine if locall y 
used equivalent medications are acceptable.
On weeks of elotuzumab infusion, the weekly dexamethasone will be split into a po and IV 
administration (described in Section 4.3.1) which will also serve as premedication for 
elotuzumab.
Intravenous and po dexamethasone doses are calculated to prevent an imbalance in 
dexamethasone exposure between the control and investigational arms (Refer to Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] for premedication in su bjects with prior infusion reaction).
In addition, the following must also be administered 30 - 90 minutes prior to elotuzumab:
H1 blocker: diphenh ydramine (25 - 50 mg po or IV) or equivalent;
H2 blocker: ranitidine (50 mg IV) or equivalent
acetaminophen ( 650 - 1000 mg po)
[IP_ADDRESS] Premedication Regimen in Subjects With a Prior Infusion Reaction
To be re-treated with elotuzumab, subjects with prior infusion reaction must receive H1, H2 
blockers and acetaminophen at maximum doses specified (ie, 50 mg diphenh ydramine , 
50mgranitidine, and 1000 mg acetaminophen).
To prevent imbalance in dexamethasone exposure between the two arms in the study , doses of 
intravenous dexamethasone above 10 mg require a decrease in the po dexamethasone. 
Recommended dexamethasone dosing issummarized below and in Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1. Decisions to 
use more aggressive premedication schemes in subjects with only  prior Grade [ADDRESS_769994] be approved b y the Sponsor or designee.
For subjects with prior Grade 1 infusion reaction, the same dexamethasone premedication 
regime as in Section 4.3.1 may be used.
For subjects with prior Grade 2 infusion reaction, administer 10 mg IV dexamethasone 
(instead of 8 mg) as the premedication steroid at least 45 minutes prior to elotuzumab. 
Subjects should still take 28 mg oral dexamethasone either as a single dose or split dose 
([ADDRESS_769995] 3 hours prior to elotuzumab).
For subjects with Grade [ADDRESS_769996] only receive a total of 
16mg oral dexamethasone ([ADDRESS_769997] 3 hours prior to 
elotuzumab). Eighteen mg of IV dexamethasone has similar exposure to approximately
24mg oral dexamethasone.

Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 24-Aug-[ADDRESS_770004] elotuzumab permanently  discontinued. These subjects 
should continue to receive lenalidomide and dexamethasone per protocol.
Once the elotuzumab infusion -related reaction has resolved to Grade 1, the infusion can be 
restarted at 0.5 mL/minute. If symptoms do not recur after 30 minutes, the infusion rate may be 
increased in a stepwise fashion starting at a rate per investigator ’sdiscretion, and increasing 
up to a rate per investigator’s discre tion, up to a maximum of 5 mL/ minute .
Subjects who experience an infusion reaction require vital signs to be monitored every  [ADDRESS_770005]’s signs and symptoms. The infusion can be reattempted at the 
next protocol defined infusion time point at the investigator’s discretion with additional 
premedication as described in Table [IP_ADDRESS] -1
Infusion reactions after the completion of elotuzumab infusion : Should a Grade2infusion 
reaction occur following completion of an elotuzumab infusion, the subject should be treated as 
clinically  indicated with 1 or more of the following medications or interventions: 
diphenhy dramine, acetaminophen, hydrocortisone, H2 inhibitor, leukotriene inhibitor, oxygen 
inhalation, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], bronchodilators, or other supportive measures as indicated.
Elotuzumab infusio ns on subsequent weeks after a prior Grade 2 infusion reaction : 
Subjects with prior Grade [ADDRESS_770006] the next infusion started at 
0.5 ml/min and then escalated in a stepwise fashion (0.5 mL/minute every  30 minutes to a 
maximum of 2 mL/min). If no Grade 2 infusion reaction occurs, the next infusion may be
increased in a stepwise fashion starting at a rate per investigator ’s discretion, and up to a 
maximum of 5mL/minute .If tolerated, all subsequent infusions may start at a rate per 
investigator’s discretion, up to a maximum rate of 5 ml/minute.
4.3.3 Dose Delay or Interruption
If the dose of one drug in the regimen (ie, lenalidomide, dexamethasone or elotuzumab) is 
delay ed or interrupted, the treatment with the other drugs may continue as scheduled. Subjects 
experiencing a 28 day delay in all study  drugs lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and elotuzumab 
due to an adverse event(s) related to study  treatment must be discontinued from study  drug. 
Subjects experiencing delay s unrelated to study therap y, for example due to radiation therap y 
may delay  study  treatment up to [ADDRESS_770007] on 
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 24-Aug-[ADDRESS_770008] be discontinued for an 
adverse event or other reason. Patients are considered still on study therapy  even if they continue 
solely  on lenalidomide.
Please consult the BMS medical monitor or any questions regarding dose interruption or study 
therap y discontinuation.
[IP_ADDRESS] Elotuzumab
In Cycle 1 and 2, an elotuzumab dose that falls outside of the pre-specified window 
(-1to+3days) must be skipped.
In Cycles 3 and beyond, elotuzumab dosing may be delay ed for up to 1 week. If unable to 
administer within 1 week, then the dose should be skipped and resumption of the elotuzumab 
continues per the protocol defined schedule.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dexamethasone
Dexamethasone delay  should be performed as clinically  indicated at the discretion of the 
investigator.
For subjects receiving elotuzumab, the weekl y dexamethasone dose that coincides with or is 
temporally  closest to the elotuzumab dosing must be administered as part of the premedication 
for elotuzumab per the guidance in Section 4.3.1.
[IP_ADDRESS] Lenalidomide
Lenalidomide delay  should be performed as clinically  indicated at the discretion of the 
investigator.
Subjects should be instructed that if a dose of lenalidomide has been missed and it has been less

5.4 Efficacy  Assessments
Efficacy  endpoints will be based on serum and urine protein electrophoresis (SPEP and UPEP), 
corrected calcium (serum calcium and serum albumin), and bone marrow assessments at 
predefined intervals as specified in Table 5.1-1, Table 5.1-2, and Table 5.1-3. Assessments for 
SPEP and UPEP will be based on central lab results, whereas assessments of bone marrow, bone 
lesions , extramedullary plasmacy tomas, and corrected calcium will bebased on local analysis at 
the site. Serum [ADDRESS_770052] be recorded in the 
CRF/eCRF as requested by  [CONTACT_585562] .
5.4.1 Efficacy Assessment

quantification, corrected calcium (calcium and albumin), and serum free light chain 
(when indicated for CR assessment), should be re-evaluated per the protocol -stated frequency  
relative to the date of first dose of study  drug until disease progression based on the EBMT 
criteria, irrespective of dose delays or treatment cycle. If subject does not have documented 
EBMT -based disease progression as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] (eg, disease progression was 
determined by [CONTACT_585563]-protocol -defined criteria) at time of study drug 
discontinuation, then tumor assessments must continue to be performed according to the 
same schedule described above until disease progression even if a subsequent anti -myeloma 
treatment is initiated prior to disease progression. Subjects will be followed every  16 weeks 
(or more frequently ) after disease progression for survival, subsequent myeloma therapy , and 
development of second primary  malignancy .
All efficacy  laboratory assessments should be done through the central laboratory , except 
corrected calcium, and bone marrow assessments for plasma cell percentage and light chain 
restriction (clonality  by [CONTACT_182470] ). All bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_585533] y. For an y SPEP or UPEP assessment performed locally , in lieu 
of a central lab assessment, (ie, if the subject cannot complete a visit at the study  site), M protein 
absolute quantification (eg,g/dL or g/L for SPEP and mg/24 hrs for UPEP) must be performed.
Any laboratory  samples analyzed locally , including for efficacy , must be entered on the 
appropriate CRF as requested by  [CONTACT_585562].

Subjects without measureable urine M protein (< 200 mg/24 hours )at baseline and at the next 
two consecutive assessments do not have to submit q4 week urine samples with each cycle (but 
must submit q12 week urine samples) until SPEP M protein becomes undetectable. Therefore , at 
the time SPEP becomes undetectable, 24-hr UPEP collection should promptly  resume and 
continue q4 weeks until SPEP becomes detectable.
Assessment of UPEP M protein and urine immunofixation at the time of possible CR/sCR is 
mandatory for all subjects , that is negative urine immunofixation for a minimum of 6 weeks is 
required to fulfill CR/sCR criteria, even in subjects with nonmeasurable values at baseline. Any 
local serum and urine myeloma lab tests that may also have been performed must also be 
reported in the CRF as requested b y Sponsor to properly assess efficacy b y protocol criteria .
1)Serum: serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) for M protein quantification ,total serum 
protein, immunofixation, and quantitative immunoglobulin assay .
a)Immunofixation of serum is required at baseline and to confirm CR regardless of whether 
measurable M -protein was present at baseline .

5.4.3 Imaging Assessments for Myeloma
[IP_ADDRESS] Skeletal Survey
Skeletal survey , by [CONTACT_182474] y, for metastatic disease will be performed at 
screening (within 28 daysprior of randomization), and on study  if clinicall y indicated 
(development of compression fracture does not exclude response). Use of conventional or low 
dose CT scan (ie, of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) or MRI  bone survey  is acceptable. If imaging is performed on 
treatment for assessment of progression, the site must use the same modality  of imaging as used 
in screening. The number and location of skeletal lesions and whether they are lytic should be 
recorded on the eCRF. On treatment survey  should record whether there is an increase in the 
number or size of ly tic lesions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Extramedullary Plasmacytoma
CT or MRI should be performed in all subjects if clinically  indicated at baseline to assess for the 
presence of extramedullary  plasmacy toma. To minimize unnecessa ry radiation in myeloma 
subjects where progression is primarily  based on serum and urine M-protein, on study  
assessments should only be performed if clinically  indicated (ie, pain, concern for disease 
progression), whether or not present at baseline, and at the time of CR/sCR assessment.
A sum of the products of the longest diameters and longest perpendicular diameter for all 
measurable lesions will be calculated at baseline. This sum will be used as the reference for 
on-study  assessments by  [CONTACT_585566].
All tumor measurements must be made in millimeters. All documented measurable lesions are to 
be followed throughout the trial. All assessments to be used for tumor response evaluation, 
including the baseline assessment, must be performed using the same method for repeat 
assessment. CT and MRI scanning are the preferable methods of assessment. Conventional CT 
and MRI  should be performed with contiguous cuts of 10mm or less or with cuts of 
5(or10)mm if spi[INVESTIGATOR_585536]. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation 
by [CONTACT_12148]. Evaluation by  [CONTACT_13190] x-ray is less preferable than CT or MRI , and should 
only be used for well- defined lesions surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. Clinical examination is only 
acceptable when lesions are superficial, such as a skin nodule or palpable lymph node. Skin 
lesions must be documented by a photograph with a ruler. Ultrasound is not acceptable for 
documentation of measurable disease.

documented as new lesions since the completion of radiation therap y), bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion (exception for effusions 
documented by [CONTACT_182475]), 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, abdominal masses that are not pathologically/cytologicall y 
confirmed and followed by  [CONTACT_15218], and cy stic lesions.
5.4.4 Independent Review Committee
The followi ng information will be submitted to an Independent Review Committee (IRC) for 
final assessment of objective response based on:
1.The subject’s laboratory  results (electronicall y and via CRF)
2.All imaging results via CRF
3.Local pathology  results via CRF
4.Local pathology  results of bone marrow samples for confirmation of stringent CR.
The criteria for IRC review are defined in a separate I RC charter.
5.4.5 Definitions of Response
[IP_ADDRESS] Complete Response (CR)/stringent CR (sCR)
A CR requires that all of the following criteria be achieved:
1.Negative immunofixation (“IF”) on both serum and urine, maintained for a minimum of 
6weeks and
2.A bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_585538] < 5% plasma cells. I t is not essential to perform 
a trephine biopsy , but if a biopsy  is performed thismust also contain < 5% plasma cells 
(although not required for documentation of CR using the EBMT criteria, light chain 
restriction (flow or IHC for kappa and lambda light chain in the bone marrow should also be 
assessed to assist in classification of stringent CR using the IMWG criteria)17and
3.If skeletal survey  showed osteoly tic bone lesions, there should be no increase in the size or 
number (development of a compression fracture does not exclude response) and
4.If screening scans showed extramedullary  plasmacy tomas, complete disappearance of any 
must be noted.
5.For assessment of stringent CR, per IMWG criteria, all criteria for CR must be upheld. In 
addition, bone marrow sample must be assessed for light chain restriction (as mentioned in 
bullet 2 above) and serum free light chains must be normalized at two time points at least 
6 weeks apart, at the time of CR assessment.

[IP_ADDRESS] Partial Response (PR)
Subjects in whom some, but not all, the criteria forCR are fulfilled are classified as PR, 
providing the remaining criteria satisfy  the requirements for PR. This includes subjects in whom 
routine electrophoresis is negative but in whom IF has not been performed.
1.Greater than or equal to 50% reduction in serum M-protein, maintained for a minimum of 
6weeks.
2. Reduction of 90% in urinary  light chain excretion or a decrease to < 200 mg/ 24hours, 
maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks.
3.Greater than or equal to 50% reduction in the size of extramedullary  plasmacy tomas present 
at baseline (b y radiography or clinical examination using bidimensional measurements).
4.If a skeletal survey  is performed, no increase in the size or number of lytic lesions 
(development of a compression fracture does not exclude response).
[IP_ADDRESS] Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)
VGPR, a subset of PR, is not formally  included in the EBMT criteria but is derived from the 
IMWG criteria.17Because VGPR is commonl y used to measure depth of response in MM, this 
response must be reported by  [CONTACT_585567] :
1.Serum and Urine M -protein detectable by  [CONTACT_585568] a subsequent assessment OR
2.90% or greater reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level < 100 mg per 24h 
and that is confirmed in a subsequent assessment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Minor (Minimal) Response (MR)
Subjects who have reduction in M-protein or plasmacy toma but do not meet the criteria for PR 
are classified as MR if they meet all the following definition:
1.Between 25 - 49% reduction in serum M -protein, maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks.
2.Between 50 -89% reduction in urinary  light chain excretion which still exceeds 
200mg/24 hours, maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks.
3.Between 25 - 49% reduction in the size of extramedullary  plasmacy tomas.
4.If a skeletal survey  is performed, no increase in the size or number of lytic lesions 
(development of a compression fracture does not exclude response).

[IP_ADDRESS] Progression of Disease (PD)
Prog ression
Progression describes a definite increase in disease activit y relative to the nadir in 2 consecutive 
assessments in subjects not in CR, whereas the term “relapse from CR” applies to a recurrence of 
evident disease in subjects previously  in CR. The date of EBMT based disease progression is the 
first date of two consecutive values fulfilling the criteria for disease progression. 
Any of the following list is sufficient for PD:
1.Increase of > 25% in serum M-protein (also an absolute increase of at least 5 g/L) and 
confirmed b y at least 1 investigation.
2.Increase of > 25% urinary  light chain excretion (which must also be an absolute increase of 
at least 200 mg/24- hours and confirmed by  [CONTACT_2669] 1 investigation.
3.Increase of > 25% plasma cell percentage in the marrow (which must also be an absolute 
increase of at least 10%).
4.Definite increase in the size or number of lytic bone lesions or extramedullary 
plasmacy tomas (development of a compression fracture does not exclude continued response 
and may  not indica te progression).
5.Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium greater than 11.5 mg/dL; 
2.8mmol/L) not attributable to any other cause.
Relapse from CR (for subjects in CR)
Subjects who have documented CR and then achieve at least one of the following criteria are 
classified as relapse from CR. According to the EBMT criteria, relapse from CR is considered to 
be progression of disease. The date of EBMT based relapse from CR is the first date of two 
consecutive values fulfilling the criteria for rel apse. 
1.Reappearance of serum or urinary  M-protein onimmunofixation or routine electrophoresis, 
confirmed b y at least one further investigation and excluding oligoclonal reconstitution.
2.Greater than or equal to 5% plasma cells in a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_585539] .

The BPI-SF is a 15 -item (Appendix 5) instrument designed to assess pain in patients with cancer

includes questions to measure the interference of pain in the patient’s daily  life, including 
general activity , mood, ability  to walk, normal work both outside the home and housework, 
relations to other people, sleep, as well as enjoyment of life (7-item reactive dimension).52In 
multiple myeloma patients, significant associations were found between pain intensity  measured 
by [CONTACT_55817]-SF and mood disturbance scores. As pain interference increased, so did levels of 
mood disturbance. A joint predictive model explained 74.6% of the variability  in total QOL

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an 
investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily  have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.
Adverse events can be spontaneously  reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious A dverse Events
A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose : 
results in death
is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically  might have caused death if it 
were more severe)
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] 
(seeNOTE below)
results in persist ent or significant disability /incapacity
is a congenital anomal y/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediatel y 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medic al and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) 
Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an 
important medical event (See Section 6.6for the defin ition of potential DILI).
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, any organism, virus or infectious particle, 
pathogenic or non -pathogenic) via the study  drug is an SAE.
Although pregnancy , overdose, cancer, and potential DILI are not always serious by [CONTACT_157335], these events must be handled as SAEs for data transmission purposes 
(See Section 6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).
NOTE : 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102412]: 
a visit to the emerge ncy room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered "important medical event" or event life 
threatening)

6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting 
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safet y 
Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting. 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol -specified procedures . All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and within [ADDRESS_770062] be completed for an y event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study  drug, but is potentially  related to 
the conditions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study  
procedure), the relationship must be specified in the narra tive section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS (or 
designee) within [ADDRESS_770063] be recorded on the SAE Report 
Form; pregnancies on a Pregnan cy Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). The preferred 
method for SAE data reporting collection is through the eCRF. The paper SAE/pregnancy  
surveillance forms are only intended as a back -up option when the eCRF system is not 
functioning. In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile 
(fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
SAE Facsimile Number:  Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
For studies capturing SAEs through electron ic data capture (EDC), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. In the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission, 
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 24-Aug-[ADDRESS_770064] (required for SAE and pregnancy  reporting): Refer to Contact 
[CONTACT_20491].
If only  limited information is initially  available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up 
SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially  reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity  or relationship to study  drug or if new information 
becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours to BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.
6.2 Nonserious A dverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Thecollection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study  drug. Nonserious 
AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the s ubjects.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1). Follow -up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study  drug, or those that are present at the end of study  
treatment as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the 
nonserious AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnormalities 
that are reported/identified during the course of the study.
6.[ADDRESS_770065] Abnormalities
The following laboratory  abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF page or 
SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
Any laboratory  test result that is clinically  significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
Any laboratory  abnormality  that required the subject to have study  drug discontinued or 
interrupted
Any laboratory  abnormality  that required the subject to receive speci fic corrective therapy .
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical, rather than the laboratory  term would be used 
by [CONTACT_9673] (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).

Second primary  malignancies (SPMs) will be collected throughout the study  which includes 
assessments during survival follow -up. All SPMs that occur during the screening period and 
within 60 day s of discontinuation of dosing will be reported as an SAE regardless of relationship 
to study  drug. Additio nally , any SPM that occurs after this timeframe and considered related to 
study  drug will be reported as an SAE. All other SPMs will be collected and reported as adverse 
events.
7 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE A ND OTHER EXTE RNA L 
COMMITTEES
A data monitoring comm ittee (DMC) will be established before the first subject is treated and 
will monitor safet y throughout the study . (The DMC will receive SAE tables every  4months and 
more comprehensive safety  data every  8 m onths.) In addition, the DMC will review safety  and 
efficacy  data, including a formal comparison of PFS for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], once the following two 
conditions have been met: at least [ADDRESS_770072] been randomized . A separate charter will describe the activities of this committee. (Also see 
Section 8.5, I nterim Analy ses, for details on the interim anal yses of safet y and efficacy).
8 STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
The number of events and power for PFS were calculated assuming an exponentia l distribution 
in each arm. One interim analy sis of PFS is planned. The comparisons of PFS will be carried out 
using log-rank tests stratified by [CONTACT_585545] (International Staging System 1 - 2 versus 3), 
ECOG performance status (0 versus 1 -2), and age (<75years old versus 75 years old). The 
interim analy sis will allow for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_585540] y. An O’Brien and Fleming 
spending function will be employ ed to determine the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74239]. 
Approximately  [ADDRESS_770073] 482 progression events, ie, documented progressions or deaths as 
determined by [CONTACT_26732]. Four hundred and eight y-two (482) events ensure that a two-sided, 5% 
level, sequential test procedure with 1 interim analy sis after 70% of the total events (338) will 
have 90.5% power if the median PFS times in the control and experimental arms are [ADDRESS_770074] ratio of the experimental to control arm is 0.74.
Assuming an accrual rate of 24subjects per month, it will take approximately  60months to 
obtain the required number of events, 31 months for accrual and 29 months for PFS follow -up. It 
is projected that at the time of final PFS analysis (at least 482 events), an observed hazard ratio 
of 0.84 or less, which corresponds to a 4.8 month or greater improvement in median PFS (25 vs 
29.8 months), would result in a statistically significant improvement in PFS for the 
elotuzumab -containing arm. In view of evolving results with frontline lenalidomide therap y, a 
reassessment of the sample size could be made. The decision to reevaluate sample size would be 
based on external data only and would not involve a change in the required number of PFS 
events.

Survival, a keysecondary  endpoint, will be compared between the two arms at the time of the 
interim analy sis of PFS (if and only if both PFS and ORR are positive), and again after 354
deaths, which is projected to occur 7years (84months) after the initiation of the study. An 
O’Brien and Fleming -spending function will be used to obtain the nominal significance levels 
for the interim and final analyses of survival. Three hundred and fifty-four (354) deaths ensure 
that a two-sided 5% level sequential test procedure with one interim analy sis will have 80% 
power for a 8.7 percentage point improvement in 4-year survival rate from 59.0%36to 67.7%, 
ie,for a HR = 0.74.
Power calculat ions were done using East v5.1.

Analy ses of baseline characteristics, including demograph y, patient -reported outcomes, and 
efficacy  will be carried out on all randomized subjects. Analy ses of safety  will be based on all 
treated subjects.
8.3 Endpoint Definitions
8.3.1 Progression -Free Surviva l
The primary  definition of progression-f ree survival (PFS) isthe time from randomization to the 
date of the first documented tumor progression, using the criteria in Section5.4.5.5, or to death 
due to any cause, provided death does not occur more than 10 weeks (2 or more assessment 
visits) after the last tumor assessment. Clinical deterioration will not be considered progression. 
The following censoring rules will be applied for PFS:
Subjects who receive systemic secondary  anti-myeloma therap y prior to documented 
progression will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment prior to the initiation of 
the new therap y.
Subjects who have an event (documented progression or death) > 10 weeks (2assessment 
visits) after the last prior tumor assessment will be censored at the last prior assessment.
Subjects who do not progress and who do not receive subsequent therapy  will be censored at 
their last tumor assessment.
The main analysis of PFS will be by  [CONTACT_585569].
IRC PFS also will be analy zed appl ying an intent- to-treat (ITT) definition that utilizes all data on 
each randoml y assigned subject until either a progression event or the end of the study . PFS 
under the ITT definition will be defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first
documented tumor progression or to death due to any cause. Clinical deterioration will not be 
considered progression. Subjects who neither progress nor die will be censored on the date of 
Revised Protocol No.: 05

8.4.2 Efficacy Analyses
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary  endpoint for the study  is progression -free survival based on IRC assessment . The 
primary  analysis of PFS will beto compare the 2 randomized arms at the interim and final looks 
via two-sided, log-rank tests stratified by [CONTACT_585545] (International Staging System 1 -2 
versus 3), ECOG performance status (0 versus 1 -2), and age (<75 years old versus 75 years 
old). An O’Brien -Fleming spending function will be employ ed to determine the significance 
levels and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_585541]. (See Section 8.5, Interim Anal ysis, 
for more detail). 
Further analysis of PFS will includ e the computation of hazard ratios and estimation of PFS 
functions. The PFS hazard ratio of lenalidomide/dexamethasone + elotuzumab to 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone alone and an associated two- sided confidence interval will be 
computed using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model with treatment arm as the sole 
covariate. The alpha level () for the confidence interval will be the same as the nominal 
significance level for the hypothesis testing. The stratification factors will be the same as those 
used in the randomization. The PFS functions for each randomized arm will be estimated using  
the Kaplan -Meier product -limit method. Two-sided, 95% confidence intervals for median PFS 
and the first and third quartiles will be computed by [CONTACT_141585].

[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Analyses
The key  secondary  endpoints are:
Objective response rate (ORR)
Overall survival
A hierarchical procedure will be used to ensure a two-sided, family -wise type I error rate of 5% 
for testing the one primary  and two key secondary  endpoints. If there is a statistically  significant 
improvement in PFS, ORR will be compared between a rms at the 5% level. If the comparison of 
ORR is also statistically  significant at the 5% level, then survival will be compared between arms 
using a 5% level sequential test procedure.
Objective response will be compared between randomized arms using a two-sided 5% level 
Cochran -Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_585547]. 
An associated odds ratio and 95% confidence interval will be calculated. The response rate and 
its corresponding 95% confidence interval will also be calculated for each treatment arm. There 
will be no interim comparison of this endpoint.
Survival will be compared between treatment arms using two-sided, stratified log-rank tests at 
the interim and final looks. The family -wise type I error rate for the sequential testing procedure 
will be 5% and the stratification factors will be the same as those used for the randomization. 
The significance level at the interim and final analy ses of survival will be determined using an 
O’Brien and Fleming α spending function.
Other Secondary  objectives are:
Change from baseline of mean score of pain severity  and change from baseline of mean score 
of pain interference (BPI -SF)
Each of the two comparisons will be made at the two-sided type I error of 2.5% and will be 
tested independent of the significance of the comparison of the progression -free survival, 
objective response rate and overall survival. See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details about anal yses.   
8.4.3 Safety Analyses
Summary  tables will be presented on safet y parameter s for each treatment arm. Toxicity  rates 
(worst CTC grade per subject) of adverse events and laboratory  tests, both of any  occurrence and 
severe (Grade 3) will be tabulated. Shift tables for selected laboratory  parameters will be 
produced.

[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of HRQoL Data
All analyses will be conducted on randomized subjects. Questionnaire completion rate, defined 
as the proportion of questionnaires actuall y received out of the expected number (ie, the number 
of subjects still on treatment), will be calculated and summarized at each assessment point. 
Subjects without any  post- baseline assessment will be excluded from the analy sis.
The comparison between the 2 treatment arms of the change from baseline in the mean score of 
pain severity  will be conducted using a longitudinal mixed model with treatment arm, time point 
(categorical), and baseline score as fixed effects and a banded covariance matrix (constant 
covariances on each diagonal of the matrix). Similar model will be used to analyze change from 
baseline in mean sco re of pain interference.
Adjusted mean change from baseline at each assessment point will be graphicall y presented by

8.5 Interim A nalyses
A data monitoring committee (DMC) will be established before the first subject is treated and 
will monitor safet y throughout the study . (The DMC will receive SAE tables every  4months and 
more comprehensive safety  data every  8 m onths.) In addition, the DMC will review safety  and 
efficacy  data once the following two conditions have been met: at least [ADDRESS_770080] 338 (70%) progression events will be a formal 
comparison of PFS between treatment arms. This formal comparison of PFS will allow for early 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_540107] . The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_585542] O’Brien and 
Fleming spending function in East v5.1. (Under current accrual assumptions, the 
338progression event milestone will occur approximately  41 months after study  start.)
The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_585543], and will be determined using the interim monitoring tool in East 
v5.1. However, if there were exactly  338 events the DMC could stop the study  for superiority if 
the p -value were 0.0148. (It should be noted that survival follow -up would continue even if the 
study  were stopped at the interim analy sis of PFS for superiorit y.)
A formal interim analy sis of OS will be conducted provided that both the analyses of PFS and 
ORR are positive (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for further detail). The final analysis of survival, 
provided that the survival portion of the study  is not stopped early , will take place after at least 
[ADDRESS_770081] is randomize d. The nominal significance levels for the interim and final survival 
comparisons will be determined by  [CONTACT_1629] O’Brien and Fleming alpha spending function.

APPENDIX 6 PREPA RATION AND ADMINISTRA TION OF ELOTUZ UMA B
Note: Subjects must be premedicated as described in Section 4.3.[ADDRESS_770089] be completed within 8 hours if kept at 
room temperature (25C). In the [LOCATION_002] and Puerto Rico, where a shortage of normal 
saline has been reported, dextrose 5% water (D5W) may be used. Normal saline is the preferred 
diluent and D5W should only be used if normal saline is not available. If a delay  is anticip ated 
after the dose has been diluted in normal saline, the prepared dose (properly  identified) may be 
refrigerated at 2C to 8C for up to 24hours. If stored under refrigerated conditions, the study 
drug solution should be equilibrated to room temperatu re (takes about 2 to 2.5 hours), and the 
container must be gently inverted to thoroughl y mix the contents before administration. If the 
storage time limit is exceeded, the prepared dose solution must be discarded and the reason 
documented b y the pharmacist in the study  drug accountability  records.
Elotuzumab will be administered to each subject as an IV infusion, using an automated infusion 
pump set at the appropriate rate according to the dose administration section (seeAdministration 
Instruction section below). The dose of elotuzumab will be calculated using the subject’s predose 
weight on Day  1 of each cy cle, and then added to 0.9% saline for infusion.
Reconstitute elotuzumab lyophilized study drug, as described in steps 1 to 5 .
Step 1:  For a 440 mg vial of lyophilized elotuzumab, draw 17 mL of Sterile Water for Injection 
(SWFI), USP into a sy ringe equipped with an 18 -gauge or smaller needle.
Step 2:  Remove the flip-top from the elotuzumab vial.
Step 3:  Place the vial upright on a flat surface and, using standard aseptic techniques, insert the 
syringe needle into the vial through the center of the rubber stopper and deliver 17mL (into the 
20-mL vial containing 440 mg elotuzumab) SWFI , USP, into the vial. Slowly  remove the sy ringe 
needle out of the vial. The final volume of the reconstituted solution is approximately  17.6mL, 
which includes the volume displaced by [CONTACT_317434]. The concentration of elotuzumab in the 
reconstituted solution is approximately  25mg/mL.
Step 4:  DO NOT SHAKE. Hold the vial upright and gently  swirl the solution by  [CONTACT_317435]. Then gentl y invert the vial a few times in order to dissolve any 
powder that may be present on top of the vial or the stopper. Finally , hold the vial upright again
and gentl y swirl the solution a few more times to dissolve any remaining particles. Avoid 
prolonged or vigorous agitation. DO NOT SHAKE.  
Step 5:  After the remaining solids are completely dissolved, allow the reconstituted solution to 
stand for [ADDRESS_770090] small bubbles and/or foam around the edge of the vial. The reconstituted 
preparation results in a colorless to slightly yellow, clear to slightly opalescent solution 
containing approximately  25mg/mL of elotuzumab.

Step 6:  Once the reconstitution is completed, withdraw the calculated drug volume and further 
dilute with 100-500 ml of normal saline into an infusion bag (see Pharmacy  Manual for details). 
The volume of saline or D5W can be adjus ted so as not to exceed 5 ml/kg of patient weight at 
any given dose of elotuzumab. The resulting elotuzum ab concentration must be from 1.0 mg/ml 
to6.0 mg/ml. Elotuzumab solutions are compatible with polyvinyl chloride and polyolefin bags. 
Examples of such bags include Viaflo, MacoPharma Easyflex N, Macoflex N, B Braun Excel, 
and Braun Ecobag.
Drug volume will be calculated based on subject weight: For example, a subject receiving 
10mg/kg elotuzumab who weighs 80 kg on Day 1 [predose] will require 800mg of study  drug 
for infusion. Withd raw 32 mL of elotuzumab (25mg/mL) from [ADDRESS_770091] receiving 20mg/kg elotuzumab [predose] will require 1600 mgof 
study  drug for infusion. Withdraw 64 mL of elotuzumab (25 mg/mL ) from [ADDRESS_770092]. Used 
elotuzumab vials will be stored until study  drug accountability  has been completed by [CONTACT_317436], and destruction or return is authorized. Used vials do not need to be refrigerated.
Note: Subjec ts must be premedicated as described in Section 4.3.1 prior to elotuzumab infusion.
Administration Instructions
1. Administer through a low-protein- binding 0.22 - micrometer or smaller in-line filter (placed 
as proximal to the subject as is practical). Prime the infusion line with study  drug before 
starting the infusion.
2.Set the IV pump to deliver the infusion at the rate of 0.5 mL per minute (including the drug 
in the line). The total time of infusion will vary depending upon the maximum tolerated 
mL/min infu sion rate as discussed above.
3.Record every  time the infusion is started and stopped and the reason why the start and stop 
occurred.
4.Monitor the IV setup and the subject’s IV site frequently  during infusion, checking for the 
correct infusion rate and IV site infiltration.
5.Ensure that the full volume of elotuzumab is infused.
6.After elotuzumab has been infused from the line, discontinue the infusion, disconnect the 
IVtubing, and dispose of materials appropriately  according to the facility ’s standard 
procedure .
The first dose of elotuzumab will be administered following premedications (described in 
Section 4.3.1) to each subject as an IV infusion, using an automated infusion pump set at an

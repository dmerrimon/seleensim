OPERATIONAL  DEFINITIONS  
Adolescence:  The period of  physical  and psychological  development  from the  onset  of puberty  
to adulthood.  
Adolescent:  A person of  age 10 – 19 years.  
Vaccine:  is a suspension  of live (attenuated/weakened)  or inactivated  microorganisms  (e.g. 
bacteria,  viruses)  or fractions  of microorganism  administered  to induce  immunity and prevent  an 
infectious  disease or its complications.  
Vaccine  completion:  defined  as having  received  two doses  of the HPV  vaccine  series  with an 
interval  of [ADDRESS_388681] OF  ABBREVIATIONS

ABSTRACT  
Background - Cervical cancer is the leading female cancer in Uganda. HPV is the principal cause 
of cervical cancer, making vaccination the single most important primary preventive measure. 
However, in Kampala, Uganda only 29% of girls receive both needed doses. Reasons  for under -
vaccination include school absenteeism on special vaccination days, failing to remember to come 
to a health facility for a needed dose, and lack of knowledge regarding HPV and the vaccines. 
While research regarding the use of text message has no t yet been demonstrated in a 
preteen/adolescent population in sub -Saharan African or other low - and middle -income countries 
(LMICs), phone reminders may improve adherence to vaccination completion rates. According to 
the World Bank, 89.9% of urban househol ds in Uganda have a cell phone. While text messages 
can be used in populations with low literacy, families can opt to receive automated phone call 
reminders instead.  
Objectives - This protocol is for text and voice phone message intervention development fo r a 
subsequent pi[INVESTIGATOR_315771].  The specific objectives are as follows:  
1)To identify HPV vaccine text message reminder content (and parallel automated voice
phone reminders) d esired by [CONTACT_315809].
2)To develop and pre -test HPV vaccine reminders with caregivers and their adolescent girls
in Kampala.
3)To pi[INVESTIGATOR_315772] - This study will utilize a qualitative approach as part of an exploratory sequential design 
with the primary intent of the exploratory design is to develop a digital tool which will then be 
tested.  We will conduct formative research using key infor mant interviews with families of 
preteen/ adolescent girls  (throughout will be called adolescent)  (n=30 dyads/triads), clinicians and 
immunization nurses of involved study sites (n=10), administrative staff and school leadership of 
involved study sites (n=12), and leadership within the KCCA and Ministry of Health (n=4)  to 
assess attitudes towards HPV vaccination and text message reminders. Using the results from the 
interviews we will create prototypes of messages that will be shared with families (n=30 dyads) to 
identify issues with clarity, tone, and persuasiveness. Next, we will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_201834] l to 
randomize caregivers of adolescents at one KCCA site and the adolescent clinic, stratified by [CONTACT_3725], 
language and HPV vaccine dose needed (initiation vs. completion). Feasibility milestones will 
include reach, effect size determination and implementati on measures. If the pi[INVESTIGATOR_315773], we 
will conduct a future full -scale RCT assessing the impact of the HPV vaccine text message 
reminders. The main outcome will be timeliness of vaccination. We will also collect 
process/feasibility measures.  
Utility o f the Study  - The messages will be used for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_315774].  
Anticipated Study Outcomes - This study will allow us to understand the types of educational 
information paren ts and providers believe is needed in HPV vaccination reminders in an LMIC. 
We will be able to use this information in a future large -scale intervention that will utilize text 
message reminders to prompt caregivers to return their adolescents for their nex t HPV dose.

oropharyngeal  cancer.1 
1.2 Problem  statement:  
An important  public  health  goal is enhancing  HPV  disease  prevention  through  HPV  vaccination.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_315775].  Uganda  rolled  out the HPV  
vaccination  into the  national extended  programme  on immunization (UNEPI)  in November 2015.  
However,  of the adolescents  who receive  the first dose of HPV  vaccine  many  do not receive  the 
second  dose they need  to complete  the series  for adequate  protection.  Furthermore,  of those  who 
do receive  the second  dose,  many  do not receive  it in a timely  fashion  within  the recommended  12 
months,  resulting  in more  days at risk. In two previous  national  surveys,  72% and 83% of girls 
assessed  initiated  vaccination, but only  39% and 27% of them,  respectively,  completed  the series.  
1.3 Justification:  
Text messages  could  be used to address  many  of the problems  identified  with poor HPV  vaccine  
uptake.  The study  assessing  HPV  demonstration  projects  in LMICs  found  main  vaccination  
barriers  to include:  1) school  absences  on vaccination  days and 2) lack of knowledge  or awareness  
about  cervical  cancer,  HPV  vaccine  and HPV  vaccination  programs.  All these,  and more,  are 
targetable with  HPV vaccine  text message  reminders.  
Although  there  is evidence  from  developed  countries  that text messaging  is an effective  
intervention  to promote  vaccine  completion  rates,  there  is a knowledge  gap about  its use in 
resource -limited  settings.  Since  the rates of mobile  phone  possession  is high in this population,  it 
is important  to test the effectiveness  of vaccine reminder  text messages.  
1.4 Research Questions  
What message content would key stakeholders prefer for HPV vaccination reminders?  
Are text message vaccine reminders for HPV vaccination feasible?  
Do text message vaccine reminders demonstrate potential impact on timely HPV vaccination 
initiation and completion?

Page  [ADDRESS_388685] knowledge  gaps regarding  the link 
between  HPV  and cervical  cancer as  well as misperceptions  regarding  the vaccine.  In one study  
that included  stakeholder  interviews,  investigators  found  that a key driver  of vaccination  was 
fears  about  vaccine safety.2 Another showed that the perceived  benefits  of vaccination - 
particularly  cancer  protection as well as perceived  safety  of HPV vaccination - increased  girls'  
and caregivers'  acceptability  of HPV vaccination.[ADDRESS_388686] at  an 
adolescent  clinic (a site  for this study ), knowledge  about  cervical  cancer,  HPV, and HPV  
vaccination  were  associated with  increased  vaccine  coverage.  Other  investigators  have  also 
found  that families  chose  vaccination  because it protects  against  cervical  cancer,  prevents  
infection,  and because vaccines overall  are good  for health.[ADDRESS_388687], scalable opportunities  to foster  vaccination.  Traditional

95% CI: 1.15 – 1.44; six  studies;  7,772 participants) .[ADDRESS_388689] several  characteristics  making  them  an attractive  
technology  for vaccine  reminders  in all populations.  
a)Text messages  are a good  way to reach  people . The number of mobile  phone  user is high,
with an estimated  6.8 billion users  world -wide.32 According  to the  World  Bank,  89.9%  of
urban  households  in Uganda have  a cell phone.33 
Page  6 of 142 b)Text messages  act as cues to  action.  They  may draw  attention  more than  written  information
and may be perceived  as less intrusive than  a phone  call.24 In addition,  they remain  on a
person’s  phone  as a persistent  reminder.  This makes them  particularly  useful for
interventions  with a clear, desired  behavioral  outcome.
c)Text messages  are useful across  populations  with various  levels  of literacy  since space
limitations  force a minimal  number of short,  simple  words.
d)Text messages  are delivered  outside  the office setting . This is important  for reaching  patients
not accessing  care regularly,  a key group  for targeting  HPV vaccine reminders  as well as for
school -based  programs.  Text messages  also allow  more frequent  contact  [CONTACT_4490] a  health  care
team  than can be achieved with in -person  visits alone.
e)Text messaging  is scalable  and can be personalized . It allows  interaction  with thousands  of
patients  simultaneously  thereby  [CONTACT_315810]’ health,
but also on the  health  of the public  by [CONTACT_315811] -level  vaccination  coverage.  Yet,
text messaging  can also allow  personalization  based  on individual  characteristics  such as age
and language.
f)Text message reminders  are a flexible  platform. They  can be used either  for simple  prompts
or for reminders  that inform a  patient  or family  when a  vaccine is needed,  and even for more
complex  interactions  that include embedded  educational information  and interactive
responses  that can close  knowledge  gaps and dispel  vaccine misperceptions.
Text messages  could  be used to address  many  of the problems  identified  with poor  HPV vaccine  
uptake.  The study  assessing  HPV demonstration  projects  in LMICs  found  main  vaccination  
barriers  to include: 1)  school absences  on vaccination days and 2) lack of  knowledge  or 
awareness  about  cervical  cancer,  HPV vaccine  and HPV vaccination  programs. All these,  and 
more,  are targetable with  HPV vaccine text message  reminders.22 
 They  can notify  famili es that their child  is in need of vaccination  either for their first  dose 
or that it is time  to return  for the second dose  
 Timing  of reminders  can be tailored  to the  individual  child  based  on when  their dose is 
due as well as where  and when  they should  go to receive that dose,  including  special  days 
at school.  
Page  7 of 142  Educational  information  can be embedded  into text messages  to provide answers  to 
common  questions  or concerns  families  have about vaccination  or include  information  
that has been shown  to impact the  likelihood  of caregivers  to accept  vaccination, like  
cancer protection.  
We have established  strong evidence supporting HPV  vaccine text  message  reminders.  [CONTACT_315844]  (MPI  [INVESTIGATOR_40349]) published  the first studies  using  text message  vaccine  reminders  for 
adolescent  and pediatric  popula tions.34-[ADDRESS_388690] or  second  dose of the HPV vaccine  received  a series  of text message  
reminders  when the  next dose  was due. Adolescents whose caregivers  were  texted were more  
likely  to receive their next dose on -time vs. non-enrollees  (51.6% of enrollees  vs. 35.0%  of non- 
enrollees  [p = 0.001]  or 38.1%  of historical  controls [p=0.003]).40 In a secondary  analysis  
(unpublished),  those  receiving  text messages  also had higher series  completion rates (45% vs. 
29% p<0.01).  These  conventional  reminders  solely  notified  caregivers  via text that the next dose 
was due; they did not include  any other information  such as vaccination -related  educational  
health  information.  While these results strongly  supported the  potential  effectiveness  of text 
message reminders,  still fewer than  half of adolescents  (45%) completed  the series.  
In her most recent  study,  Stockwell  demonstrated  74.1%  completion  rates of HPV vaccine series  
within  12 months for adolescents  of caregivers  receiving  text message reminders.41 This rate was  
much  higher than  both historical  controls  (34.8%)  and the comparison  group  of non-enrollees  
(45.2%,  p<0.0001).  
This proposed  project  is innovative  in four important  ways.  
1)This will be the first use of text message vaccine  reminders  for adolescent  vaccinations
in not only  Africa but for any LMIC.  Text message vaccine reminders  have been used for
pediatric vaccination  studies in Africa in Kenya and Nigeria33,42-[ADDRESS_388691] of sub-Saharan  Africa,  vaccinations  for young
children  are delivered  as part of EPI (Expanded  Programme on Immunization) in
which  primarily  families  bring  their child  in to a  central  location  for vaccination.
This differs  from  vaccination for adolescents,  who are being  vaccinated  in a
variety  of places,  including  the school, health  centres  and immunization posts in
the community.  This means that a more tailored  mHealth  approach  is needed to be
able to provide reminders for these various groups.
b.Caregiver views of  pediatric vaccination  are generally  positive,  while in contrast
many  concerns  about  HPV  vaccination  still exist making  the embedded
educational  information  in HPV reminders  particularly  important.
c.Caregivers  are very accustomed to thinking  about  vaccinations  for their infants
but vaccinations  for adolescents  are much  newer to them  and knowledge  gaps
remain.50 In addition,  care seeking  patterns  for infants may  differ markedly  than
for adolescents,  making  this type of outreach  potentially  even more  important.
2)We will also be able to assess for the first time what  types  of educational  information
caregivers  and providers  believe is needed  in HPV vaccination  reminders  in a LMIC.  An
August  2018 article highlighted  that while nearly  a quarter  of the  world’s  population are
adolescents , on average  only 1.6%  of all global health  development  assistance funding
goes to adolescent  health .51 Given  the very high burden of  cervical  cancer  coupled  with
late diagnosis,  the opportunity  for primary  prevention offered  by [CONTACT_315812].
Uganda has  a young  population, 59.7%  are <[ADDRESS_388692]  may also be useful to other  LMICs.
3)This project  is at the intersection  of two important  governmental  ministries - the Ministry
of Health  and the Ministry  of Education - these  mHealth  reminders  would  be a novel
intervention  spanning  the two arenas  of health and education.

oCaregiver is willing  to take  part in interview
Exclusion criteria:  
Those who are unable to consent/assent to the study
Those unable to be interviewed at the affiliated study health centres
3.3.[ADDRESS_388697] not completed the HPV vaccine series will be given a consent form/information 
sheet by a member of our study team. Then, they will be asked if they  have any questions and if 
they are willing to participate. After being read the consent/assent form, one willing adult 
participant who is the primary caregiver of the adolescent will be asked to sign the consent and the 
10-[ADDRESS_388698] 
not completed  the HPV vaccine series  and receive  care at the study -affiliated  healthcare centres  
about  possible  participation.  If these families  are interested,  they will be asked  to travel  to their 
study -associated  healthcare centre to be  consented  and participate in the  study  interview and  
their transp ort to and from the  health  centre will  be reimbursed.  
The interviews  will be grounded  in the  general  domains of  the critical  interpretive synthesis  
framework  put forth  by [CONTACT_315817].  After  obtaining  informed  consent, interviews  will be conducted  using a  semi- 
structured  interview  guide by [CONTACT_315818]  15 of 142 interviews  with adolescent and their caregivers.  The guide was  develop ed based  on the  
investigators’  experience  with HPV vaccination.  Audio -recorded  interviews will last 30-40 
minutes.  We will use open -ended  questions  with neutral  probes  to facilitate  discussion  and 
\encourage unbiased  responses.  In addition,  rather  than leading  the interview based  on a 
predetermined  hypothesis,  we will  allow the concepts  to emerge inductively.  
We will seek to interview 30 caregiver  and adolescent  dyads/triads,  but will use  an iterative data  
collection  and analysis  approach  and continue data collection  until data saturation  is reached  
(e.g. no new themes arise from  the data).  Eligible  criteria  are outlined  as above. Adults  and 
adolescents  will be interviewed  concurrently,  but separately  to facilitate comfort  and encourage  
honest  answers.  Family  interviews  will concentrate on text message reminder content,  focusing  
on the  attitudes,  perceived  norms  and perceived  control that may affect  intent  to vaccinate in the  
Phillips et al model.  We will also assess  desired  message timing  and phrasing.  Additionally,  we 
will assess  if families  want for only the caregiver  or the caregiver plus adolescent  to receive the 
messages.  
At the health  centres/clinics,  we will  interview clinicians  caring  for 10-14 year olds,  
immunization nurses,  administrative staff,  and medical  leadership  (n=12).  We will purposefully  
sample schools  from  the list of  KCCA health  centre -affiliated  schools  included in Appendix  26, 
focusing  on two per division each of which represent  a different  student  demographic  
composition.  At the study -affiliated  schools, we will interview up to two people per school  
including  the headmasters  and staff involved  in Child Days  Plus/HPV vaccination.  Interviews  
will include content  discussions  regarding  experiences  with families’ vaccine  knowledge  and 
attitudes  as well as community  access  and facility  readiness  factors  from  the Phillips et al model  
in order to align  reminder content  and timing  with current  processes.  Interviews  will take place  
in person  at the facilities  in which  the participant  works,  or another  decided upon location.  
In addition,  local  and national government  officials,  including  KCCA and  MOH leadership  
involved  in immunization  programs,  will also be interviewed  with focus on  access  and readiness  
from  the Phillips et al model  and an eye towards  sustainability  (n=4).  Interviews  will take place  in 
the leadership  offices  after written  informed  consent is obtained.  We will interview the KCCA  
Directors  of Education and Social  Services,  and of Public  Health  and Environment  as well as the 
Page  16 of 142 City Manager  of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_315784].  These individuals  together oversee vaccination  
at the KCCA - affiliated  schools,  health  centres,  and immunization posts  and in Kampala overall.  
At the MOH,  we will  interview the Program  Manager of UNEPI.  
During  the process  of data collection,  COVID -19 risk management  procedure  (Appendix  24) 
will be followed  to protect  the health  and safety  of study  participants  and researchers.  
3.3.[ADDRESS_388699]  methods  of qualitative  analysis.  Analyses  will follow  a 
systematic,  iterative  process  in which  transcripts  will be independently  read for familiarity  with 
content.  General  thematic  domains  and codes  will be identified,  and then transcripts  will be 
systematically  and independently  coded  line-by-line by [CONTACT_315819].  The coding  scheme  
will remain  flexible  and open  to accommodate  expansion  as the teams  agree  on new codes.  Double  
coding  of all data will occur  to facilitate  reliability.  Coding  inconsistencies  will be reviewed  and 
resolved  during  meetings  with the research  team.  Thematic  analyses  will then be conducted  on the 
data to identify  emerging  themes.  Qualitative  data coding  and analysis  will be facilitated  by [CONTACT_315820].  Summaries  of coded  texts  and comparative  analyses  will be discussed  with 
the investigatory  team  who were  not involved  with the coding,  as well as outside  experts,  to obtain  
validation.  The themes  identified  through  the qualitative  analysis  will be used to guide  the 
construction  of the text (and parallel  phone)  messages  that will be pre-tested  in Objective 2. 
3.4 Objective  
Objective 2a: To develop HPV vaccine  reminders  with caregivers  and their adolescent  girls
in Kampala.
Objective 2b: To pretest  HPV vaccine  reminders  with caregivers  and their adolescent  girls
in Kampala.
Page  17 of 142 3.4.1 Study  procedure for Objective 2a message  development  
We will design  the reminders  using  the information  gathered  under  Objective  1 to ident ify the 
themes,  content,  timing  and framing  of the SMS  reminders.  We will also use content  gathered  
during  our previous  studies  described  above,  the relevant  literature,  and the team’s  expertise  in 
text messaging,  HPV  vaccination,  adolescent  medicine,  health  literacy  and community  
engagement.  The same  message  content  and timing  will be used for those  opting  for voice  
reminders.  The messaging  will be behaviorally -informed  with the framing  based  on findings  from  
participants  from  Objective  1. Possible  examples  include  “loss -frame”  messages  that focus  on the  
negative  consequences  of an adolescent  not being  vaccinated,  and/or  “gain -frame”  messages  that 
focus  on what  can be achieved  through  vaccination.  Messages  may also include  social  comparisons  
that capi[INVESTIGATOR_315785],  contigent  on if this 
is found  to be motivating  to families  based  on the Objective  [ADDRESS_388700]  coordinator  will then design  the 
messages.  The team  will then iteratively  revise  the messages,  keepi[INVESTIGATOR_315786] 160- 
character  count  and paying  attention  to reading  level,  as assessed  by [CONTACT_315821] –Kincaid  readability  
test. The final draft messages  will first be designed  in English  then will be forward  translated  from  
English  into Luganda  by [CONTACT_315822] a 
second  independent  professional  translator  from  Luganda  into English.  All the while,  translators  
will ensure  proper  linguistic  and cultural  equivalence,  following  procedures  adapted  from  
guidelines  for translating  health  services  research  measure.  The two versions,  the original  English  
and the reverse -translated  English,  will then be compared  by [CONTACT_2362].

3.4.4 Study  procedure for Objective 2b message  pretesting  
We will show/read  the designed  messages  with caregivers  and adolescent  to identify issues  with 
clarity  and persuasiveness.  Using  methods  previously utilized  by [CONTACT_315823],  the 
project  coordinator  will purposefully  sample  families  meeting  criteria  a above  from  the waiting  
rooms  at the adolescent  clinic  and KCCA  health  centres.  Families  will be consented/assented  as 
outlined  in objective  1. After  obtaining  informed  consent,  the project  coordinator  will share  the 
proposed  messages  and ask the caregiver  to relay  back,  in their own words,  what  the message  
means  to them  in order  to assess  clarity.  S/he will then ask families  about  the level  of 
persuasiveness  as well as any problems  or suggested  changes.  Messages  will be updated  in an 
Page  19 of 142 iterative  process  until no new message  changes  are made.  Based  on our previous  work,  we 
anticipate needing  20 dyads (with  representation  by [CONTACT_315824]).  
3.4.5 Data  management and analysis  
Final  messages  will be reverse translated  from  Luganda and  team members  will review to make  
sure that  the content  is the  same between  the messages  in the  two languages. We  will also map 
the final messages  back to the factors  of the critical  interpretive synthesis  framework  related  to 
attitudes,  perceived  norms and perceived  control,  as well as access .

3.5.3 Study procedure  
We will recruit eligible participants from the sites outlined in Aim 1 and 2. This includes health 
centres  overseen by [CONTACT_315814][INVESTIGATOR_315788] (KCCA), as well as the associated schools 
and immunization posts in the community. In addition, we will also recruit at the 
Page  20 of 142 Makerere/Mulago/Columbia Adolescent Health Clinic at Mulago National Referral Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the 
teaching hospi[INVESTIGATOR_315789].  
For those vaccinated through clinic sites:  Families will be recruited multiple ways. First, families 
who are interested can enroll directly at the health centre at the times research staff are on -site, 
possibly  at the time they are being evaluated for another health condition and are not receiving the 
vaccine that day. Second, if research staff are not on -site, providers and nursing staff at the study 
sites will ask families permission to provide the research st aff with their contact [CONTACT_315825].  
For those vaccinated through community immunization posts:  Village health workers who already 
work in each vil lage will be mobilized to approach households with 10 -14 year olds who are in 
need of vaccination (have not yet been vaccinated or who have initiated but have not completed the 
series) to identify those who would be interested in the study. Research staff will contact [CONTACT_315826], as above. The use of village health workers has been previously successful for both 
immunization campaigns and other research studies.  
For those vaccinated through the Child Days Plus:  Girls will be given an information sheet and the 
study contact [CONTACT_315827]. We would get permission from the schools to 
call families back as above.  
We will enroll only one child per family; if more than one is eligible, one wi ll be randomly 
selected.  For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_86234], we will enroll families of girls who are in need of either the 
first or second dose, with an outcome of receipt of next needed dose. Due to the need to complete 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_315790],  we will only enroll those in need of the second dose if their next 
dose is due strictly between [ADDRESS_388706] coordinator will randomize families into intervention vs. 
usual care arms (1:1 ratio) stratified by [CONTACT_315828], parental language (English or Luganda), 
and dose due (1st or 2nd) using a randomization module. Research staff will not know the study 
assignment during enrollment. The outcome assessor and analyst will remain blinded to arm 
assignments.  
Families who report on the demographic survey their highest degree of schooling as P7 or below 
will be asked at enrollment if, in the case they are randomized to the intervention, they would 
prefer a voice reminder in lieu of texts; such reminders would in clude the same content, timing and 
interactivity as the texts. While in Kampala only 2.1% of women and 0.5% of men have no formal 
education, 17.6% of women and 17.1% of men completed only some primary school.[ADDRESS_388707] the timing used for those not at boarding school. If the special timing 
is selected, we will account for the minimal interval between doses (for those in need of a second 
dose). Intervention -arm families enrolled through Child Days Plus will be sen t their series prior to 
the next Child Days Plus event at their child’s school or before any other special immunization day 
events, if the school holds one.  
Intervention, Text Message Target, Content and Frequency:  
For those families randomized to the int ervention arm: Based on our previous studies as well as 
the full country HPV vaccine evaluation highlighting the parents involvement as vaccine decision 
makers, we plan for the messages to be targeted to the parent, unless in Aim [ADDRESS_388708] that 
girls should also  receive the message. All text messages are automated and will be sent in English 
or Luganda based on parental preference.  
The message sequence consists of 5 weekly, main message reminders beginning 5 weeks before the

SEARCH Protocol June [ADDRESS_388709] data; we will stop messages for tho se already vaccinated. HPV registers for schools are 
generally kept with the affiliated KCCA health centre immunization nurses. For families of those 
unvaccinated who were first vaccinated at Child Days Plus will receive booster messages directing 
them to bring their daughter to the KCCA health centre affiliated with their school (who conducts 
their Child Days Plus outreach) as they will have missed the school vaccination day.  
Usual Care arm: Families randomized to the usual care arm  will not receive text m essage vaccine 
reminders.  
3.5.[ADDRESS_388710] a hazards ratio of 1.67 with 80% power, allowing for a 5% type I error comparing time to 
next dose.  
At the study sites,  we expect there to be, on average, [ADDRESS_388711] 913 families to meet age, language and cell phone/texting 
inclusion criteria. To meet our minimal sample size of 154 (77/arm) for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/feasibility study, 
we need to recruit 16.9% of eligible families, which is feasible. If recruitment is slower than 
expected, we wil l be able to use more KCCA sites.  
Data Management  
Vaccination data will be abstracted from the HPV vaccination registers in use clinically at the sites. 
Girls generally seek care from one site. All data will be entered into a REDCap database hosted at 
Columbia with secure access provided only to Columbia and Ugandan study staff. The Ugandan -
based project coordinator will monitor text messages sent, replies, and “undeliverable” messages 
under the supervision of Drs. Bakeera -Kitaka and Stockwell. Linkages be tween parents’ and girls’ 
information, survey data and vaccine records will be maintained in separate password protected 
files. All final datasets will be coded.  
D10. Analytic Plan   
The primary analytic plan for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_315791] 2021 Page 24  of 142 intervention using a RE -AIM implementation framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, 
Implementation, Maintenance). We will focus only on reach, effectiveness, and implementation 
(not adoption or maintenance which is not applicable for th is pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] ). 
Reach: We will collect data on number of families  
approached
eligible and ineligible (including reasons for ineligibility)
eligible who enrolled
number enrolled in text message vs. phone reminders
Effectiveness: While the focus of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_315792], we will also assess the effect size of the 
intervention. The outcome will be timeliness of vaccination (time to event). Time will be from start 
of main message series to receipt of the next needed dose. Data analysis will be performed using  
Stata. The primary analysis will be intention -to-treat (ITT), whether or not further messages were 
declined or undeliverable. A secondary per protocol analysis will only include those who received 
the entire set of reminders. Timeliness of vaccine receipt  will be compared using Kaplan -Meier 
curves using a stratified log rank test. In addition, in order to gain effect sizes needed for a future 
large -scale intervention, comparisons will also be stratified assessing those due for the first dose 
(initiation) a nd second dose (completion).  
Implementation: We will assess various process measures, including:  
Messages sent/delivered (if a text message is electronically returned as undeliverable, we
will contact [CONTACT_315829])
Number who opted out of further messages
Number who responded to messages
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_315793]
Factors associated with response and drop out
ochild characteristics (age, site, school status (in or out of school), grade, relationship
with caregiver)
ofamily characteristics (age, education, employment, income, marital status, distance to
health facility, language)
We will also randomly select [ADDRESS_388712] them complete two implementation measures: Acceptability of 
Intervention Measure (AIM), Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM).  These were developed 
and psychometrically assessed by [CONTACT_315830] . In addition, they will also complete an adapted Health 
Information Technology (IT) Usability Evaluation Scale (Health -ITUES) .  
We will then present findings to key non -parental stakeholders (as identified under Aim 1) and 
conduct semi -structured interviews to gather feedback. Conduction of the interviews and the 
analytic plan will follow the methods outlined in Aim 1.  
3.[ADDRESS_388713] operating procedures and study risk 
management procedures.  
3.7 Ethical considerations  
Permission to carry out the study was already obtained Columbia University IRB in [LOCATION_001] City 
under expedited review for meeting the following two c riteria  
a) Research involving materials (data, documents, records, or specimens) that have been
collected, or will be collected solely for non -research purposes (such as medical treatment or 
diagnoses).  
b) Research on individual or group characteristics o r behavior or research employing survey,
interview, oral history, focus group, program evaluation, human factors evaluation, or quality 
assurance methodology.  
We sought approval for the study through the IRB at Columbia University as part of our research 
team is located within that institution. We are seeking approval through SOMREC as the other 
researchers and research participants are located in Kampala, Uganda.    
Page  26 of 142 3.8 Dissemination  
The findings  of this study  shall be availed  to the  Kampala Capi[INVESTIGATOR_315782],  the Columbia  
Department  of Pediatrics  and Child Health,  and all other stakeholders.  
Risks  / Benefits  to Subjects  
This is a minimal  risk study.  Some  caregivers  might find there are interview questions  they do 
not want  to answer;  they can skip any questions  they like and can stop the  interview at  any time.  
Interviews  can be  converted  to be  conducted  online  to decrease  risk of COVID -19 transmission  
if necessary.  Patients  do not receive  any care as part of  the study  they or their 
parent/caergiver only receive a text message.  They  can choose to act or not act on the  message.  
The vaccination  is not directly  part of  the intervention. Some  parents  might  find the alerts  to be  
intrusive,  but we will  design  them  based  on parental input.  In addition,  they can opt out at any 
time.  There is also a minimal  risk of loss of  confidentiality.  However,  we will assure  
confidentiality  as below.  
Compensation  
Staff,  caregivers,  and adolescents  taking  part in interviews  will receive Ugandan Shillings  (UgX)  
30,000 which  is equivalent  to ~USD$8,  officials  taking  part in interviews  will receive UgX  
75,000 which  is equivalent  to ~USD$18.  Families  who were contact[CONTACT_315831] -affiliated  health centre to be  consented  and participate in 
interviews  will be given  travel  compensation  of UgX 10,000 which is the  equivalent  of ~USD$3.  
Those enrolling  in the  pi[INVESTIGATOR_315794]  (UgX) 15,000 which  is 
equivalent  to ~USD$4.   These compensation  amounts  were determined  by [CONTACT_315832].  
Informed  Consent  
Page  [ADDRESS_388714]  names  will be recorded  (last names  
will be used when  it would be  culturally  or otherwise inappropriate  for an  interviewer to address  
an interviewee by [CONTACT_315833]).  Data  will be stored  on an encrypted  computers  and/or servers  
and in locked  research  offices  at Makerere University  and/or Global  Health  Uganda (the  
subcontractor).  Only  Columbia  and Ugandan  research  staff will have access to the  recordings.  
The researchers  will be responsible  for ensuring  that the  confidentiality  of the data is maintained  
at all times.  Paper documents will be stored  in a locked  cabinet  at Makerere  University  and/or  
Global  Health  Uganda.  The study  database  will reside  at Columbia  on the  RedCap  server.  The 
recordings  will be used solely  for research  purposes to inform  the content  of the intervention  and 
possible  future publications. The recordings  will be destroyed  upon  conclusion of  the study.  
Conflict of Interest  
There  are no conflicts  of interests  amongst  any of the researchers  
Collaborative Agreements  
None  
Intended  Use of Results  
The intended  use of the results is to design  a trial of text message vaccine  reminders,  which  if 
successful  could  lead to a  larger-scale text message reminder program  on timely  human  
papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597]  (HPV) vaccination  in Ugandan  adolescents.  In addition,  we will potentially  
publish a  manuscript  related  to this data.  The data  will be used for future  grant  applications . 
Storage of and access  to research  data by [CONTACT_315834] [INVESTIGATOR_25653] [ADDRESS_388715] a de -identified copy  of the final analytic trial dataset.  In addition, we will 
permit access to the data on the basis of the experience and scientific qualifications of the investigator(s) 
and their agreement to not reproduce or share the data with others and to not attempt to determine the 
identities of patients or locations. Requests must be submitted in writing on the letterhead of the 
sponsoring institution at which the research will be conducted and include identifying information about 
the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -investigators, including their curricula vitae or NIH biosketch. This data 
set will be free of identifiers that would permit linkages to individual research participants or specific 
practice sites. Research data will be made available only if appropriate I RB permission are obtained. Data 
Use Agreements will be executed as necessary. Data will be able to be exported to common statistical 
packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R) for analysis.  
Data  Safety  
This is a minimal  risk study.  Some  caregivers  might find there are interview questions  they do not 
want  to answer;  they can skip any questions  they like and can stop the  interview at  any time.  There is 
also a minimal  risk of  loss of  confidentiality.  However,  we will assure  confidentiality.  The researchers  
will be responsible  for ensuring  that the  confidentiality  of the data is maintained  at all times.  Paper 
documents will be stored  in a locked  cabinet  at Makerere  University  and/or  Global  Health  Uganda.  
The study  database  will reside  at Columbia  on a RedCap  server.  The recordings  will be used solely  for 
research  purposes to inform  the content  of the intervention  and possible  future publications. The 
recordings  will be destroyed  upon  conclusion of  the study.  
Data will be stored on an encrypted computers and/or servers and in locked research offices at Makerere 
University and/or Global Health Uganda (the subcontractor).

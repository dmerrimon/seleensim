1. INTRODUCTION AND BAC KGROUND  
[COMPANY_012] Vision recently launched a multifocal contact [CONTACT_13293], 1 -DAY ACUVUE® 
Moist Multifocal.  The lens is the only marketed soft multifocal lens to have its optical 
design optimized for the changes tha t occur in pupil size with refractive error.  The modality 
for the lens is daily disposable.  There is a desire to evaluate the same optical design in a 
reusable modality.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate a multifocal optical design 
manufactured  from senofilcon -A material and compare the visual performance to the 1-DAY 
ACUVUE® Moist Multifocal . 
1.1. Name [CONTACT_391366]: JJV Investigational senofilcon -A Multifocal Contact [CONTACT_19550] -The lens has the same 
optical design,  diameter, base curve and aspheric back surface design as the 1-Day Acuvue® 
Moist Brand Multifocal .  The lens is manufactured in senofilcon -A.        
 
Control Lens:  Marketed 1-Day Acuvue® Moist Brand Multifocal Contact  [CONTACT_19550]. 
1.2. Intended Use of Investigationa l Products  
Both lenses are intended to correct spherical refractive error and presby[CONTACT_19555].  The test lenses 
are intended to be used as a 2-week, reusable, daily wear lens.  The lenses require use of a 
care system to clean and disinfect the lenses.  The cont rol lenses are daily wear lenses that 
are disposed of at the end of each wear cycle .  No care system is required for the control 
lenses.  
1.3. Summary of Findings from Nonclinical Studies  
All previous pre -clinical findings were deemed satisfactory prior to proc eeding with clinical 
trials on humans.   For the most comprehensive nonclinical information regarding JJV 
investigational senofilcon -A multifocal refer to the latest version of the  Investigator 
Brochure. 
1.4. Summary of Known Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects  
The Investigational multifocal contact [CONTACT_391352] a continuous asphere providing 
for the correction of refractive spherical ammetropia  and presby[CONTACT_19555].  The material is a 
silicone hydrogel material, senofilcon -A.   
 
The 1-Day Acuvue® Moist Bran d Multifocal Contact [CONTACT_93880] a currently marketed product 
that is made of the etafilcon -A material.  The contact [CONTACT_656473] a subjects refractive  spherical ammetropia  and 
presby[CONTACT_19555] . 
 
The intent of the Test lens is daily wear, reusable lens that the subject wears while awake.  
This lens is not intended for extended wear.  Anticipated risks and adverse reactions with this 
lens are similar to other soft daily wear contact [CONTACT_656474].  A listing 
of examples of adverse reactions is found in the Section [ADDRESS_884101] comprehen sive clinical information regarding the JJV

4. STUDY DESIGN AND RAT IONALE  
4.1. Description of Study Design  
The clinical study is a randomized -controlled, single -masked, cross-over clinical trial.  There 
are two study treatment s. A total of approximately [ADDRESS_884111] article will be dispensed for 3±1 days and an 
optimization visit will occur.  The final lens pair will be dispensed for 7±[ADDRESS_884112] 
follow-up on the final lens pair will occur.  The lenses will b e dispensed for an additional 
7±[ADDRESS_884113] on the prima ry/secondary endpoints measured in the study.      
 
CR-6201, v4.[ADDRESS_884114] Article Allocation  
The study lenses will be worn in a bilateral and random fashion using a 2×[ADDRESS_884115] will randomly be assigned to one  of two unique 
sequences (Test/Control or Control/Test).  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_3725].  
 
Permuted block randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to 
treatment, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. 
Each block will contain two different lens trial sequences.  
 
The order of lens wear will be based on the randomization scheme assigned to the study site.   
The study site will follow the randomization scheme provided and will compl ete enrollment 
according to the randomization list and will not pre -select or assign subjects.  
5.2. Masking  
This is a single -masked study with the subjects being masked. Subjects will be unaware of 
the identity of the investigational product. Investigators and clinical site personnel involved 
in the data collection will not be masked as to the identity of the investigational product.  
 
Under normal circumstances, the mask should not be broken until all subjects have 
completed the study and the datab ase is finali zed. Otherwise, the mask should be broken only 
if specific emergency treatment/course of action would be dictated by [CONTACT_656480]. In such cases, the Investigator may, in an emergency, contact [CONTACT_35041].  In the eve nt the mask is broken, the Sponsor must be informed as soon as 
possible. The date, time, and reason for the unmasking must be documented in the subject 
record. The Investigator is also advised not to reveal the study treatment assignment to the 
clinical si te or Sponsor personnel.  
 
Subjects who have had their treatment assignment unmasked are expected to return for all 
remaining scheduled evaluations.  Subjects who are discontinued may be replaced.  
5.3. Procedures for Maintaining and Breaking the Masking  
The test articles mask shall not be broken unless information concerning the lens type is 
necessary for the urgent medical treatment of a subject.  The Sponsor must be notified before 
the mask is broken.  
 
When dispensing test articles, the following steps should be followed to maintain 
randomization codes:  
 
CR-6201, v4.[ADDRESS_884116]  article associated with an Adverse Events and/or a Product 
Quality Complaint must be retained and stored in a glass vial with moderate solution pending 
directions from the sponsor for potential return to JJVC. 
6.7. Accountability of Test Articles  
JJVC will pro vide the Investigator with sufficient quantities of study article and supplies to 
complete the investigation.  The Investigator is asked to retain all lens shipment 
documentation for the test article accountability records.  
 
Test article must be kept in a  locked storage cabinet, accessible only to those assigned by [CONTACT_35500]. The Investigator may delegate this activity to authorized study 
site personnel listed on the Site Delegation Log.  All test articles must be accounted.  This 
includes: 
1. What was dispensed for the subject for trial fitting, to wear out of the office, or issued 
for the subject to replace appropriately between visits  
2. What was returned to the Investigator unused  
3. The number and reason for unplanned replacements   
 
The Investigator will collect all unused test articles from the subjects at the end of the 
subject’s participation. Subject returned unused test articles must be separated from the 
clinical study inventory of un -dispensed test articles, and must be labeled wit h the subject 
number and date of return.  Following final reconciliation of test articles by [CONTACT_2037], the 
Investigator or monitor will return all unused test articles to the Sponsor . 
If there is a discrepancy between the shipment documents and the cont ents, contact [CONTACT_35501] .

JJVC (and the IEC/IRB and  DMC, if applicable) will evaluate all adverse events.  If it is 
determined that an adverse event presents an unreasonable risk, the investigation, o r that part 
of the investigation presenting the risk, will be terminated, as soon as possible.  
 
Should the study be terminated (either prematurely or as scheduled), the Investigator will 
notify the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authority as required by [CONTACT_656485].  
12. PROCEDURE FOR HANDLI NG PRODUCT QUALITY C OMPLAINTS  
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) refers to any written, electronic, or oral communication 
that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, 
effectiveness or performance of test articles after they have been released for clinical trial 
use.   
 
Potential complaints may come from a variety of sources including but not limited to 
subjects, clinical research associates (CRA), clinical operations man agers (COM), medical 
CR-6201, v4.[ADDRESS_884170] quality 
complaints:  
· Subject satisfaction inquiries reported via “Subjective Questionnaires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO)”  
· Clinical test articles that a re stored improperly or damaged after receipt at the 
investigational site  
· Lens replacements that occur due to drops/fall -outs 
· Damage deemed by [CONTACT_35513], 
and not indicative of a quality deficiency (i. e. tears, rips, etc.), only in situations 
where there is no deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_656486] [ADDRESS_884171] be 
recorded in the EDC system, which will trigger an automatic email notif ication to the 
appropriate COM/CRA and Clinical QA representative. In cases where the EDC system in 
use is not configured to send automatic notifications or when an EDC system is not used, the 
COM/CRA is responsible for notifying Clinical QA upon discovery  that a PQC has occurred.   
 
Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the COM/CRA will contact [CONTACT_19568]:   
· Date the complaint was received/recorded in the EDC System (Date of Sponsor 
Awareness)  
· Who received the complaint  
· Study number  
· Clinical site information (contact [CONTACT_2300], site ID, telephone number)  
· Lot number(s)  
· Unique Subject Identifier(s)  
· Indication of who first observed complaint (site personnel or subject)  
· OD/OS indication, along with whether the lens was inserted  
· Any related AE number if applicable  
· Detailed complaint description (scheduled/unscheduled visit, wear time, symptoms, 
resolution of symptoms, etc.)  
· Eye Care Provider objective (slit lamp) findings if applicable  
· Confirmation of product ava ilability for return (and tracking information, if 
available), or rationale if product is not available for return (Refer to Form Control 
 for test article return instructions)  
 
Once a complaint is received, it will be assessed by [CONTACT_19569], CRA,  or trained site personnel 
to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event (AE/SAE).  If the complaint 
results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or trained site personnel will follow Section 13 of this 
protocol. If the AE/SAE was potentially the result of a product quality related deficiency, 
these procedures also applies and will be executed in parallel.   
 
In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_35514].  In this event, the 
PQC form s will be marked “Intentionally Left Blank” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must 
be documented.

13. ADVERSE EVENTS  
13.1. Definitions and Classifications  
Adverse Event (AE) – An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinic al signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users 
or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device.  
Note 1 to entry: This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device 
or the comp arator. 
Note 2 to entry: This definition includes events related to the procedures involved.  
Note 3 to entry: For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to 
investigational medical devices .”1 
 
An AE includes any condition (including a pre -existing condition) that:  
1. Was not present prior to the study, but appeared or reappeared following initiation of 
the study  
2. Was present prior to the study, but worsened during the study. This would inc lude 
any condition resulting from concomitant illnesses, reactions to concomitant 
medications, or progression of disease states  
3. Pregnancy must be documented as an adverse event and must be reported to the 
clinical monitor and to the Sponsor immediately up on learning of the event  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
· Results in death  
· Is life threatening  
· Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
· Results in persistent or significan t disability/incapacity (e.g., a sight threatening 
event, a significant persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage, or 
disruption to the subject’s body)  
· Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
· Requires intervention to prevent permanent damage (the use  of the test article 
resulting in a condition which requires medical or surgical intervention to preclude 
permanent impairment of the body structure or a body function).  Important medical 
events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or requir e hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71154], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition  
 
Diagnoses a nd conditions that are considered Ocular Serious Adverse Events include, but not 
limited to:  
· Microbial Keratitis (MK)  
· Iritis (including cells in the anterior chamber)  
· Permanent decrease in best spectacle corrected visual acuity equivalent to 2 acuity 
lines or greater

· Any corneal event which necessitates temporary lens discontinuation > 2 weeks  
 
Non-Significant Adverse Events  – Those conditions that are usually a symptomatic and 
usually do not warrant discontinuation (temporary or permanent) of the test article.  
However, the Investigator may choose to treat as a precautionary measure.

Note 1 to entry: This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any 
malfunction of the investigational med ical device.  
CR-6201, v4.0 Amendment 3.0
Page 69 of 190
JJVC CONFIDENTIAL

Note 2 to entry: This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from 
intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.”[ADDRESS_884173] (UADE) – Any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the test article, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan, Investigator’s Brochure or protocol, or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with the test article that relates to the rights, safety 
and welfare of subjects.  
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events  
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Investi gator will evaluate adverse events to 
ensure the events are categorized correctly.  Elements of categorization will include:  
· Seriousness/Classifications (see definition in Section 13.1) 
· Causality or Relatedness – i.e. the relationship between the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures and the adverse event (not related; unlikely related; 
possibly related; related - see definition in Section 13.2.1) 
· Adverse E vent Severity – Adverse event severity is used to assess the degree of 
intensity of the adverse event (mild; moderate; severe for all events - see definition in 
Section 13.2.2)   
· Outcome – not recovered or not resolved ; recovering or resolving ; recovered o r 
resolved with sequelae ; recovered or resolved ; death related to adverse event ; 
unknown 
· Actions Taken – none; temporarily discontinued; permanently discontinued; other  
13.2.1. Causality Assessment  
Causality Assessment – A determination of the relationship between  an adverse event and 
the test article. The test article relationship for each adverse event should be determined by 
[CONTACT_32981]:  
· Not Related - An adverse event that is not related to the use of the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures  
· Unlikely Related – An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more 
likely, e.g. concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), or the relationship of time 
suggests that a causal relationship is not likely  
· Possibly Relate d – An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test article, or 
to the study treatment or study procedures. An alternative explanation, e.g. 
concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive.  The relationship in 
time is reasonable.  Therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded  
· Related – An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse effect (device) or 
adverse reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_376706], e.g. concomitant treatment o f concomitant disease(s).  The relationship 
in time is very suggestive, e.g. it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328] -challenge and re -challenge  
CR-6201, v4.0 Amendment 3.0

JJVC CONFIDENTIAL

13.2.2. Severity Assessment  
Severity Assessment – A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adverse 
event as determined by  [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423].  The 
assessment of severity is made irrespective of test article, study treatment or study procedure 
relationship or seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following 
scale: 
· Mild – Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities  
· Moderate – Event is bothersome, possible requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities  
· Severe – Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities  
13.3. Documentation and Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
The recording and documenting of adverse events (ocular and non -ocular) beg ins when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study treatment or study procedure.  Adverse events 
reported before the use of test article, start of study treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if the condition  deteriorates at any time during the 
study it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untoward medical events reported after the 
subject’s exit from the study will be recorded as adverse events at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  
 
Upon finding an advers e event, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_19535]. He/she will complete the Adverse Event /eCRF.   
 
Complete descriptions of all adverse events must be available in the subject record. All 
Adverse Events  including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on the appropriate case report form or electronic data 
system. All adverse events occurring while the subject is enrolled in the study must be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship.   
 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to maintain documentation of each reported adverse 
event. All adverse events will be followed in accordance with applicable licensing 
requirements.  Such documen tation will include the following:  
· Adverse event (diagnosis not symptom)  
· Drawings or photographs (where appropriate) that detail the finding (e.g., size, 
location, and depth, etc.)  
· Date the clinical site was notified  
· Date and time of onset  
· Date and time of resolution  
· Adverse event classification, severity, and relationship to test articles, as applicable  
· Treatment regimen instituted, including concomitant medications prescribed, in 
accordance with applicable licensing requirements  
· Any referral to another health care provider if needed  
· Outcome, ocular damage (if any)  
CR-6201, v4.0 Amendment 3.0

JJVC CONFIDENTIAL

· Likely etiology  
· Best corrected visual acuity at the discovery of the event and upon conclusion of the 
event 
 
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/she will complete the Corneal Infilt rate 
Assessment eCRF.  Where necessary, a culture of the corneal lesion will be collected to 
determine if the infection is microbial in nature.  If cultures are collected, the date of culture 
collection and laboratory utilized will be recorded.  
 
Changes i n the severity of an AE shall be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed.  Adverse events characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of the onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Chang es in the 
assessment of relationship to the Test Article shall also be clearly documented.  
 
Subjects who present with an adverse event shall be followed by [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have returned to pre -treatment stat us, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolved.  If further treatment beyond licensure is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropriate health care provider.  The Investigator will use his/her clinical 
judgment as to whether a subject reportin g with an adverse event will continue in the study.  
If a subject is discontinued from the study, it will be the responsibility of the Investigator to 
record the reason for discontinuation.  The Investigator will also document the adverse event 
appropriate ly and complete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjects with ongoing adverse 
events related to the test article, study treatment or study procedures, as of the final study 
visit date, should be followed to resolution of the adverse event or until referral to an 
appropriate health care provider, as recommended by [CONTACT_737]. Non -ocular adverse 
events that are not related to the test article, study treatment, or study procedures may be 
recorded as “ongoing” without further follow -up. 
13.4. Reporting Adverse Even ts  
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by e -mail, facsimile, or 
telephone as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours from discovery for any serious 
/significant adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non -significant  adverse event.  
In addition, a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_35451]/IRB 
according to their requirements (Section 13.4.2).  The report will comment whether the 
adverse event was considered to be related to the test article, study treatment or study 
procedures.  
13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor  
Serious/Significant Adverse Events  
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of all serious/significant adverse events occurring 
during the study period as soon as possible by e -mail, fax, or telephone, but no later than 24 
hours following discovery of the event.  The Investigator is obligated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_656488]. 
All subjects experiencing a serious/significant adverse event must be followed up and all 
outcomes must be reported.  
 
CR-6201, v4.[ADDRESS_884174] articles.  
 
In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Investigator must:  
· Notify the Sponsor immediately  
· Obtain and maintain in the subject’ s records all pertinent medical information and 
medical judgment for colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the 
subject 
· Provide the Sponsor with a complete case history which includes a statement as to 
whether the event was or was not re lated to the use of the test article  
· Notify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB reporting procedure according to 
national regulations  
 
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE), the Investigator 
will submit a report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no 
later than [ADDRESS_884175] report the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participating Investigators within [ADDRESS_884176].  
 
Non-Serious Advers e Events 
All non-serious adverse events, including non -serious adverse device effects, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_35521] 2 days from discovery.  
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Responsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities  
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reporting must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set 
forth by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site will refer to and follo w any guidelines 
set forth by [CONTACT_19582].  
 
The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events to the local health authorities according 
the written guidelines, including reporting timelines.  
13.4.3. Event of Special Interest  
None 
13.5. Repo rting of Pregnancy  
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270] -report) during the study will be discontinued after the 
event is recorded as an Adverse Event.  Once discontinued, pregnant participants and their 
fetuses will not be monitored for study related purp oses.  At the Investigator’s discretion, the 
study participant may be followed by [CONTACT_71178]. However, this data

are discontinued due to fluctuations in refractive error and/or visual acuity that occur 
secondary to  systemic hormonal changes, and not due to unforeseen health risks to the 
mother or fetus.  
14. STATISTICAL METHODS  
14.1. General Considerations  
All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed using the SAS software 
Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) . Throughout the analysis of data, the results for each 
subject/eye will be used when available for summarization and statistical analysis.  
Unscheduled visits will be summarized separately and will be excluded from the statistical 
analysis. 
 
Summary table s (Descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be provided for all 
baseline variables, efficacy variables and sa fety variables as appropriate. Continuous 
variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], 
median, minimum and maximum). Frequency count and percentage of subjects or eyes 
within each category will be provided for categorical data.  
 
Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_656489] ( Safety Popula tion or Per -Protocol Population ). All analyses will be 
conducted on per-protocol population  (see Section 14.3).   
14.2. Sample Size Justification  
Historical study tested hyp eropes in presby[CONTACT_171193]. The data from  
was used to estimate the sam ple size of the study. There was no historical data for myopes 
yet, so the performance of the myopes was assumed to be the same as hyperopes . 
 
Using the POWER procedure in S AS 9.4, it required at least 59 myopic subjects to complete 
the study to satisfy al l the primary and secondary hypotheses with overall type I error 0.05 
and power no less than 90%. At the end of this section, a summary table of the sample sizes 
required for each individual hypothesis is provided.   
 
Primary Hypothesis : Criteria # of subje cts needed  Power 
CLUE Vision  >40 42 0.9 
    
Secondary Hypothesis  Criteria # of subjects needed  Power 
CLUE Vision  Test-Control>= -5 59 0.9

14.3. Analysis Populations  
Safety Population:  
All subjects who were administered any test article excluding subjects who  drop out prior to 
administering any test article. At least one observation should be recorded.  
 
Per-Protocol Population:  
All subjects who have successfully completed all visits and did not substantially deviate from 
the protocol as determined by [CONTACT_656490] l cohort review committee prior to database hard lock 
(Per-Protocol Population). Justification of excluding subjects with protocol deviations in the 
per-protocol population set will be documented in a memo to file.  
 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population:  
All subjects regardless of actual treatment and subsequent withdrawal from study or 
deviation from protocol. At least one observation should be recorded.  
14.4. Level of Statistical Significance  
All planned analysis for this study will be conducted with an overall type  I error rate of 5%.  
14.5. Primary Analysis  
Primary efficacy analysis : 
 
CLUE Vision : 
Overall quality of vision scores will be analyzed using a linear mixed model adjusting for 
baseline values as fixed covariates. The model will include the experimental design factors: 
sequence of lens wear, period, lens type, time point and interaction between lens and time 
point as fixed effects. The covariance between residual errors from the same subject across 
lens wearing periods/time point will be selected based on the fi nite-sample corrected 
Akaike’s Information Criterion (Keselman et al. 1998)6. Covariance structures considered 
may include: Homogenous compound symmetry (CS) and Unstructured covariance structure 
(UN). The structure that returns the lowest Akaike Informati on Criteria Corrected (AICC) 
will be selected as the structure that best fit the data.  
 
Primary Hypothes is: 
Comparisons will be carried out using 95% confidence intervals constructed of least -square 
means (LSM) from the linear mixed models of CLUE vision scores for each study 
population. Statistically superiority will be concluded if the lower limit of the confidence 
intervals of the test lens are greater than the thresholds for the corresponding populations.  
 
Secondary Hypothes is: 
Comparisons between the test lens and control lens at each time point (1 week and 2 weeks) 
will be carried out using 95% confidence intervals constructed of least -square means (LSM) 
differences (Test minus Control) from the linear mixed model. The non -inferiority of the test 
lens relative to the control will be concluded if the lower confidence limit of LSM difference 
is above the non -inferiority margin -5. The superiority will be established if the lower 
confidence limit is above 0.  
CR-6201, v4.[ADDRESS_884178] and Roger method (K enward and Roger, 1997)[ADDRESS_884179] clinical trial s don’t provide the evidence that subject dropout is systematic or not -at-
random. To evaluate the impact of missing data, sensitivity analysis will be conducted using 
multiple imputation methods if the proportion of subject dropout is greater than the 15%.  The 
SAS/STAT procedures PROC MI and PROC MIANALYZE will be utilized with a 
parametric regression method used to make at least [ADDRESS_884180] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]/ ARCHIVING  
15.1. Electronic Case Report Form/Data Collection  
The data for this study will be captured on electronic case report fo rms (eCRFs) using an 
EDC system (Bioclinica) . An authorized data originator will enter study data into the eCRFs 
using the EDC system. Data collected on equipment that is not captured in EDC will be 
formatted to the specification of the JJVC database manager and sent to JJVC for analysis.

APPENDIX G: TEST  LENS FITTING GUIDE  
Step 1. 
Choose the first lens based on the best spherical equivalent refraction and ADD power for 
both eyes.   Select the first lens per table 1 below.   
 
Table 1.  Initial Lens Selection   
 ADD        
 +0.75 +1.00 +1.25 +1.50 +1.75 +2.00 +2.25 +2.[ADDRESS_884191]’s vision at distance and near after the lens has settled (10 minutes).  If the 
vision is acceptable continue with the fit assessment  and dispensing as per the protocol.   
 
If the vision is not acceptable, ensure that the proper initial lens power was selected by 
[CONTACT_746] a distance over -refraction with +/ - 0.25D trial lenses (or flippers) to determine if 
a change in the initial lens power is required (note:  the over -refraction should be performed 
outside of the phoropter in normal room illumination).  Recheck both distance and near 
vision with the over -refraction in place.  If a change in the initial lens power is not required 
refer to the fitting steps listed below in step 2 (table 2).

MEDICAL HISTORY
A medical history will be obtained and will include demographic data (e.g., age, race/ethnicity). 
In addition, medical information will also be recorded, including a detailed oncologic history 
with specifics of previous cancer treatments, other medical and surgical history, medication 
history and drug allergies and any other medical conditions and disease states that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_18959], are relevant to the subject’s study participation.
HEIGHT AND WEIGHT
Body height and weight will be measured, and bod y mass index (BMI) will be calculated using 
the height recorded at screen ing. Height should be measured on a wall-mounted stadiometer. 
Weight should be measured in light -weight clothing, without shoes.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
A complete physical examination w ill be performed at Screening and at the EOS or ET visit. The 
complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessment of the following systems: 
HEENT, Mouth/Dental (if required), Neck (including Thyroid & Nodes), Cardiovascular, 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], Gastrointestinal, Renal, Neurol ogical, Musculoskeletal, Skin, Other. All other 
scheduled examinations will be symptom-directed.
All physical examinations are to be conduc ted by a medically qualified Investigator.
ABDOMINAL EXAMINATION
Abdominal examinations are to include at a minimum palpation, auscultation (noting presence 
and frequency of bowel sounds), and percussion (l ooking for signs of peritonitis or localized 
tenderness). Abdominal examinati ons are to be conducted at the study visits indicated in the SoA 
prior to dosing.
Besides local gastrointestinal tolerability effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and 
constipation, there is a theoretical risk of small or large bowel obstruction. To mitigate this risk, 
particular attention will be  applied for abdominal examination, w ith particular interest in signs of 
obstruction (reduced bowel sounds, decreased stool, bilious vomiting, and abdominal discomfort 
and distension). If an obstruction is suspected, the subject will be transferred to a medical facility 
and an abdominal X-ray obtained as well as  other imaging that may be appropriate.
VITAL SIGNS
Vital signs will be measured by a qualified staff member. Vital signs assessments will include 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate , respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature. Patients 
should be resting in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes prior to and during vital signs 
measurements. 
ELECTROCARDIOGRAMS
Twelve-lead ECGs will be assessed (including but not limited to the measurements of ventricular 
Protocol GLY-200-02 AM02V01 
06 October 2022 
Confidential              34 
heart rate (HR), PR interval, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] ( RR), QRS duration, QT interval and QT interval 
corrected by [CONTACT_469414]’s formula [QTcF]). Screening and prior to first dose, triplicate 12-lead 
ECGs each separated by [CONTACT_2669] 1 minute will be taken to establish eligibility at baseline. The 
average value for the triplicate will be utilized for assessing QT interval corrected using 
Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) exclusion criteria. All other post-first dose ECGs will be single readings. However, if any of the ECG measurements is out of normal range, it will be repeated in 
triplicate (separated by [CONTACT_2669] 1 minute).
ECG normal ranges are as follows:
• PR interval: 120 msec – 220 msec (inclusive);
• QRS duration: < 120 msec;
•47F)  PVHF PDOHV 47F)  PVHFI emales);
• HR 45-100 beats/min (inclusive)
If the “re-check” triplicate’s average is still above these parameters, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_729891] a 
determination on further action. The same model of ECG machine should be used for Screening, 
pre-dose and post-dose readings for all patients. ECGs will be taken after at least [ADDRESS_996935] 8 hours prior to clinical laboratory blood sample 
collection. Samples for local clinical laboratory analysis will be collected by a qualified staff 
member. All safety laboratory assessments will be assessed by a certified local laboratory, using the relevant laboratory’s internal and standard normal range values.
At a minimum, the following tests will be conducted:
•Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell indices, thrombocyte count 
(platelets), reticulocyte c ount, white blood cell count with differential (including 
neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes and monocytes). 
•Coagulation: international normalized ratio, prothrombin time and activated partial 
thromboplastin time. 
•Chemistry: sodium, potassium, magnesium, chlo ride, bicarbonate, phosphate, calcium, 
amylase, lipase, uric acid, albumin, globulin s, protein, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine 
kinase, creatinine (estimated glomerular filtration rate), blood urea nitrogen, alkaline 
phosphatase, ALT, AST, GGT, total bilirubi n, conjugated and unc onjugated bilirubin, 
total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, glucose. Vitamin and mineral pane ls will be evaluated per the SoA.

Protocol GLY-200-[ADDRESS_996939] in this study:
xHyperglycemia with evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or impending DKA : A blood glucose 
value > 300 mg/dL with symptoms of DKA (e.g., nausea, dizziness, abdominal pain, lethargy) and 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_729892] > 1.5 mmol/L or urine ketone positivity
xClinically significant hypoglycemia : A blood glucose measurement of <54 mg/dL (<3.0 mmol/L) that 
may or may not have immediate symptoms depending on the level of hypoglycemia unawareness
DEFINITION OF SAE
An SAE is defined as any serious adverse event that, at any dose:
1. Results in death
2. Is life-threatening
xThe term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in which the subject was at 
risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have 
caused death, if it were more severe.
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729893], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12994] (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.
xHospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
xThe term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.
xThis definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
6. Is an important medical event, defined as an event that does not fit one of the other outcomes, but may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes
xExamples of such events include intensive treatment for allergic bronchospasm (a serious problem with 
breathing) requiring treatment in an emergency room, serious blood dyscrasias (blood disorders), seizure/convulsion that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729894].

DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
UP Definition
xAn unanticipated problem is defined as, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of 
the following criteria: 
oUnexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; 
oRelated or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is areasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and 
oSuggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.
  
RECORDING AND FOLLOW-UP OF AE AND/OR SAE
AE and SAE Recording
xSerious Adverse Events (SAEs) should be reported to the Sponsor and/or CRO within 24 hours from 
the discovery of the event. 
xWhen an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event.
xThe Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information.
xThe Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of Severity
The investigator will make an assessment of severity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign it 
to 1 of the following categories: 
xMild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal discomfort and not interfering 
with everyday activities.
xModerate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort to interfere with normal everyday activities.
xSevere: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be 
confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and 
SAEs can be assessed as severe.
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
Assessment of Relationship to Study Agent
The relationship of the study treatment to an AE will be determined by [CONTACT_233913]:  
1. Not Related 
The AE is not related if (1) administration of the study medication has not occurred or (2) the occurrence of 
the AE is not reasonabl y related in time or(3) the AE is considered related to another event, medical 
Protocol GLY-200-[ADDRESS_996940] not associated with the study medication (such as disease progression, environmental 
factors, unrelated trauma, etc.) 
2.  Unlikely Related
The AE is unlikely related if (1) the AE is unlikely related in time or(2) the AE is considered unlikely to be 
related to use of the study medication (i.e., there are no facts [evidence] or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship), orthe AE is considered possibly related to another event, medical condition or product not 
associated with the study medication. 
3.  Possibly Related
The AE is possibly related if (1) the study medication and AE are considered reasonably related in time and
(2) the AE could equally be explained by [CONTACT_729904]. 
4.  Probably Related
The AE is probably related if (1) the study medication and AE are considered reasonably related in time and 
(2) the study medication is more likely than other causes to be responsible for the AE or is the most likely cause of the AE.
xThe Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
xAlternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration will be considered and investigated.
xThere may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report (refer to Section 10.2.5 ). However, it is very important that the Investigator 
always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data (refer to Section 10.2.5 ). 
xThe Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information and send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.
xThe causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.
Assessment of Expectedness
xThe Sponsor will be responsible for determining whether an AE/SAE is expected or unexpected.
xAn AE/SAE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study agent in the IB or is not listed in the IB at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
REPORTING OF SAES
SAE Reporting to Sponsor and IRB
xAny AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF. 
xAll SAEs must be reported by [CONTACT_729905] 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge of the event. 
oSponsor Drug Safety Contact [CONTACT_7171]: [EMAIL_13909]   
oProSciento Safety Team Email: [EMAIL_13910]
xThe Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent. This 
requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that occur during the study (from the time the participant si
gns informed consent until post-treatment follow up visit, or an y SAE made known to the

Investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP). Serious adverse events 
occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured.
xThe SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include a concise summary of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27598]. If a participant died and an autopsy has been performed, copi[INVESTIGATOR_729895]. Any follow-up data should be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Sponsor Drug Safety or its designee. 
xWhere required by [CONTACT_19666], the Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/EC of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow-up information about the event. The Investigator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_729896]/EC.
xDetails will be provided in the Safety Management Plan (SMP).
xThere may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_29482]. In this case, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the subject number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_321293].
REPORTING OF UPS
Unanticipated Problem Reporting
xIncidents or events that meet the criteria for unanticipated problem require the creation and completion of an UP report. It is the site Investigator’s responsibility to report UPs to their IRB and to the Sponsor. The 
UP report will include the following information: 
oProtocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number; 
oA detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome; 
oAn explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an UP; and 
oA description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the UP. 
xTo satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline: 
oUPs that are SAEs will be reported to the IRB and to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event. 
oAny other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the Sponsor within the IRB-required reporting timeframe. 
oAll UPs should be reported to approp riate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s 
written reporting procedures) and IRB within the timeframe specified by [CONTACT_729906].

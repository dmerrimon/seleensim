Prot Amnd 4/Version  Date:04. 3.2020 81.0 INTRODUCTION  – BACKGROUND & RATIONALE
1.1 Disease  Background
Diffuse large  B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma, representing about 30% of all NHL. It is estimated that approximately 20,[ADDRESS_826914] 
treatment for patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL is R-CHOP (rituximab + 
cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin [hydroxydaunomycin] + vincristine [Oncovin®] + 
prednisone). Treatment with R-CHOP results in a 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) 
of approximately 75%, 5-year PFS of approximately 65%, 2-year overall survival (OS) of 
approximately 80%, and 5-year OS of approximately 75%.2 DLBCL is highly 
heterogeneous in histology, clinical behavior, and underlying biology, and therefore 
exhibits significant variation with regards to outcome after therapy.  There are several 
high-risk disease markers and poor prognostic factors that are associated with a high 
likelihood to be refractory to or relapse after treatment with R-CHOP, illustrating a need 
for improved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Cell of  origin subtypes of DLBCL can be defined by [CONTACT_621239] B cell 
(ABC)/non-germinal center B cell (non-GCB) subtype and germinal center B cell (GCB) 
subtype. ABC/non-GCB subtype DLBCL has an inferior outcome when treated with R-
CHOP compared to the GCB subtype.3-5 Efficacy outcomes (response rates and survival 
measures) associated with ABC/non-GCB DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP vary 
depending on the study. In general, the 2-year progression free survival (PFS) of 
ABC/non-GCB DBLCL and GCB DLBCL are ~60% and ~80%, respectively.3,6 The 5-year 
overall survival of ABC/non-GCB DBLCL has been reported at 56%.3
The human  MYC oncogene is responsible for malignant transformation of several types 
of lymphoma, and is a sine qua non mutation associated with Burkitt lymphoma7,8.  MYC 
has been found to be rearranged in up to 10% of cases of DLBCL.9 MYC rearrangement 
and over expression are independent poor prognostic factors.9,10 Other recurrent genetic 
translocations found in lymphoma, including BCL-2 and BCL-6, can co-occur with MYC 
rearrangement, which is referred to as “double-hit lymphoma”, and subsequently confers 
a particularly poor prognosis with a 3-year overall survival of 49%.11-13
Indolent/low-grade lymphomas  transform to a more aggressive large B cell lymphoma at 
a frequency of approximately 2-3% per year over the first 5 years.14 Transformed low-
grade lymphoma to large B cell lymphoma in patients who received no prior treatment of 
their low-grade lymphoma (treatment-naïve transformed low-grade lymphoma) have 
outcomes similar to that of de novo DLBCL.15,[ADDRESS_826915] worse prognosis when compared to treatment-
naïve transformed low-grade lymphoma.15,16 Consolidative stem cell transplantation is 
considered in cases of previously treated transformed low-grade lymphoma because of 
this inferior prognosis.16
In addition  to these disease-specific factors contributing to a worse prognosis, prognostic 
models that also account for patient-specific factors, such as the IPI [INVESTIGATOR_348807]-IPI, are 
able to separate the higher risk groups from the lower risk groups.  Using the NCCN-IPI, 
patients treated in the rituximab era with a high-intermediate risk score of 4-5 and a high-
risk score of ≥6 had a 5-year overall survival of 64% and 33%, respectively.17
Relapsed/refractory DLBCL  is associated with a poor prognosis with treatment options 
including salvage chemotherapy regimens and autologous stem cell transplant. Salvage 
regimens followed by [CONTACT_621240] a remission in approximately 40% 
of cases, but these remissions tend to be less durable.18 Given the poor prognosis in the

Prot Amnd 4/Version  Date:04. 3.2020 9relapsed/refractory setting,  it would be ideal to have more high-risk patients achieve 
favorable outcomes using front-line therapy.  R-CHOP has been compared to the more 
aggressive regimen dose-adjusted EPOCH-R in a randomized clinical trial of front-line 
therapy in patients with DLBCL. The results were presented at the American Society of 
Hematology annual meeting in December 2016, which demonstrated no difference in 
overall survival or event-free survival.19 Therefore, the lymphoma community is 
continuing to investigate regimens that improve upon R-CHOP in the front-line treatment 
of DLBCL, especially in the high-risk setting. 
1.2 R-CHOP  Background & Overview
Combination chemotherapy  with cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin [hydroxydaunomycin] 
+ vincristine [Oncovin®] + prednisone (CHOP) was established as a standard treatment 
of DLBCL decades ago20. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, was later 
combined with CHOP (R-CHOP) and improved clinical outcomes compared with CHOP 
alone, thus becoming the standard treatment of DLBCL.21,[ADDRESS_826916] of care for the front-line 
treatment of DLBCL. R-CHOP in the front-line treatment of DLBCL results in a 2-year 
PFS of approximately 75%, 5-year PFS of approximately 65%, 2-year OS of 
approximately 80%, and 5-year OS of approximately 75%.2 Prognosis is significantly 
worse for certain subsets of DLBCL, as described above (section 1.1). 
The individual drugs  of R-CHOP are FDA approved for the treatment of non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma, which includes DLBCL. R-CHOP is typi[INVESTIGATOR_621196] 21-day cycles for a total 
of 6 cycles.2,22 Intravenous rituximab (375 mg/m²), cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m²), 
doxorubicin (50 mg/m²), and vincristine (1.4 mg/m² with maximum dose 2 mg) are all 
given on day 1. Prednisone (100 mg) is given orally on days 1-5. The adverse events of 
R-CHOP are well known given the number of years it has been used in clinical practice. 
Possible grade 3-4 adverse events include neutropenia, infection, febrile neutropenia, 
neurological toxicity, thrombocytopenia, nausea/vomiting, mucositis, and cardiac toxicity.2
1.3 TAK-659  Background & Overview
TAK-659 is  an orally (PO) bioavailable, potent and reversible inhibitor of SYK and FLT3 
currently under development for the treatment of patients with advanced malignancies.
SYK is  a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase with SH2-binding domains that bind to 
phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs (ITAMs) located in B and T 
cells and certain natural killer (NK) cells. SYK becomes activated upon ITAM binding and 
subsequently controls the activity of downstream signaling pathways ,eg, 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear 
factor kappa-B (NF-kB) that mediate diverse cellular responses, including proliferation, 
differentiation, and survival. The SYK pathway is implicated in hematological tumors as 
well as select solid tumors development (eg, Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]-mediated naso-
pharyngeal tumors).
FLT3 is  a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a role in hematopoiesis. Activating 
mutations in tyrosine kinase genes, including FLT3, are found in approximately 30% of 
patients with de novo acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Mutations in the FLT3 gene 
most often involve internal tandem duplication of the juxtamembrane domain coding 
region or point mutations of the tyrosine kinase domain, resulting in ligand-independent 
proliferation due to constitutive activation of the FLT3 receptor conferring poor prognosis 
for patients.23,24

1.3.1 Non-clinical  Experience
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacology
Nonclinical enzymatic  and cell-based studies demonstrated that TAK-
659 is a potent, reversible SYK and FLT3 inhibitor. TAK-659 inhibited 
SYK and FLT3 purified enzymes with a concentration producing 50% 
inhibition (IC 50) of 3.2 and 4.6 nM, respectively. Among a panel of 
kinases also inhibited by [CONTACT_4129]-659, the IC 50 ranged from 1.4- to 115-fold 
higher than those for SYK. In addition, in a study of the cellular kinase 
selectivity of TAK-659, the IC 50 for TAK-659 in a cell line expressing SYK 
was 116 nM, which was lower than the IC 50 for any other kinase tested in 
this model (about 2-fold lower than the next lowest IC 50 for ROS).
TAK-659 inhibited the  B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, as 
indicated by [CONTACT_621241], as well as 
inhibition of the phosphorylation of several downstream targets. TAK-659 
potently inhibited SYK and FLT3 activities in hematopoietic malignancy-
derived, cultured human cell lines, including T-cell lymphoblastoma, 
megakaryoblastoma, and AML, with a concentration producing half-
maximal response (EC 50) ranging from 11 to 775 nM in sensitive cell 
systems. In an additional study in cultured human tumor cells treated 
with TAK-659, the EC 50 ranged from 134 to 25,[ADDRESS_826917] inhibitory effects observed in 2 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) cell lines (OCI-Ly10 and HBL-1).
TAK-659 demonstrated  significant antitumor activity after oral (PO) 
administration in HBL-1 (DLBCL cell line model; 120 mg/kg; p0.005), 
PHTX-95L (primary DLBCL tumor; 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg; p0.001), 
OCI-Ly10 (activated B-celllike DLBCL [ABC-DLBCL] cell line model; 30, 
60, and 90 mg/kg; p0.001), TMD8 (DLBCL cell line model; 60 and 90 
mg/kg; p 0.001 and 0.01, respectively), MV-4-11 (AML cell line model; 
30 and 60 mg/kg; p0.001), KG-1 (AML cell line model; 60 mg/kg; 
p0.001), and PHTXM-32Ga (gastric cancer model; 60 mg/kg; p<0.001) 
mouse xenograft models. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) correlated with 
markers of SYK pathway modulation in the models where it was 
analyzed (eg, HBL-1, PHTX-95L, and OCI-Ly10) and showed antitumor 
activity after TAK-659 treatment. Additionally, pharmacodynamic analysis 
of MV-4-11 tumors from mice treated with TAK-659 demonstrated an 
apparent reduction of SYK phosphorylation at tyrosine residues 
Y525/526 (phosphorylated SYK [pSYK] Y525/526), as well as an 
increase in terminal biomarker cleaved caspase-3, CC3, a critical marker 
of apoptosis.

659+idelalisib, TAK-659+azacytadine and TAK-659+MLN1117 was

TAK-659-venetoclax, TAK-659 + daunorubicin, and TAK-
659+gemcitabine was synergistic. In a combination study of 
TAK-659+WX-mPD-1 (anti-programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1]) 
(TAK-659 QD and WX-mPD-1 twice weekly [BIW] dosed for 3 weeks), 
durable TGI was observed until the last reported timepoint at Day 94. 
TAK-659+WX-mPD-1 demonstrated significant benefit (p<0.001) over 
TAK-659 and WX-mPD-1 single agent treatment in maintaining tumor 
regression. Preclinical studies show that SYK inhibition results in loss of 
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and activation of T-cell 
response both in vitro and in vivo. TAK-[ADDRESS_826918] could be 
indirectly attributed to the decrease in CD11b+ MDSC or B220+ B cells 
in the tumor-inflitrating lymphocytes of TAK-659-treated tumors. 
Therefore, the addition of TAK-659 to an anti-PD-1 agent could improve 
tumor regression via modulation of the tumor-infiltrating immune cells 
and other immune cells in the tumor microenvironment25.   
   [IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics
In nonclinical  species, TAK-659 has good oral bioavailability, low plasma 
protein binding, moderate to large volumes of distribution, and moderate 
to high plasma clearance. TAK-659 was relatively stable with low extent 
of metabolism in human liver microsomes, S9, and hepatocytes; 
therefore, the metabolism is expected to be low in humans. TAK-659 is a 
major substrate of CYP3A4/5 and P-gp; thus, there is potential for an 
interaction between the corresponding inhibitor and inducer drugs. TAK-
659 is not anticipated to perpetrate CYP- or P-gp/BCRP-mediated 
interactions in the clinic. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Toxicology
The nonclinical  toxicology assessment of TAK-659 supports clinical trials 
in patients with advanced malignancies. GLP-compliant studies were 
conducted in accordance with ICH S9 guidance. In summary, the TAK-
659 nonclinical toxicology profile supports its use in patients with 
advanced malignancies on the basis of the following:
Target  organ toxicities were similar between rats and dogs, were 
generally monitorable and reversible, and included hematopoietic and 
lymphoid systems, GI mucosa, bone physis, and testicular and 
ovarian gametes.
Target  organs specific to the rat included reversible and monitorable 
effects on the lens of the eye and urothelium of bladder and kidney.
Dose-limiting  toxicity in dogs was pharmacologically mediated 
hematopoietic and lymphoid depletion/atrophy in dogs, and these 
same effects were prominent in rats; however, urolithiasis was dose 
limiting in a single rat.
Based  on results from in vitro Ames assays and in vitro and in vivo 
micronucleus evaluations, TAK-659 is considered genotoxic 
(mutagenic and aneugenic) with a benefit:risk ratio that is acceptable 
in patients with advanced cancers.

On  the basis of in vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology studies, TAK-
659 has low potential for cardiovascular (CV), respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], or central 
nervous system (CNS) effects in patients.

[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics
Preliminary plasma  PK results were available from lymphoma, solid 
tumor, and AML patients enrolled in the dose escalation phases of 
Studies C34001 and C34002. In addition, preliminary urine PK results 
were available from lymphoma and solid tumor patients enrolled in the 
dose escalation cohorts of Study C34001. TAK-[ADDRESS_826921] absorption (overall median T max of 2 hours) in patients with 
hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies. Moderate variability 
was observed among dose-normalized steady-state AUC  values in 
lymphoma, solid tumor, and AML patients (coefficient of variation of 
49.6%, 40.6%, and 38.8%, respectively). An approximately dose-
proportional increase in steady state AUC  was observed over the 60 to 
160 mg range in patients with AML. Mean accumulation ratios ranging 
from 1.9-fold to 2.6-fold and mean peak-to-trough ratios ranging from 3.2 
to 5.7 were observed across the study populations after repeated QD 
dosing for 15 days. On the basis of data in lymphoma and solid tumor 
patients, renal clearance accounted for 30-34% of TAK-[ADDRESS_826922] 30-34% of TAK-659 systemic 
clearance. Active tubular secretion appeared to be the predominant 
component of renal clearance, based on comparison of unbound renal 
clearance to glomerular filtration rate. Terminal disposition half-life will be 
determined in a single dose PK run-in phase of the indolent NHL 
expansion cohort of C34001.
Additional details  on TAK-659 PK are provided in the TAK-659 IB. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug-Drug Interactions
To date,  no drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies have been conducted in 
humans. Because the metabolic and disposition pathways of TAK-659 
remain to be fully characterized in humans in vivo, the risk of PK DDIs 
between TAK-659 and concomitantly administered drugs has been 
informed by [CONTACT_621242].
In vitro  studies indicate that TAK-659 is a substrate of P-gp and is 
metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2, with relative 
contributions of 69.1% to 73.0%, 16.6% to 30.9%, and 0% to 8.40% for 
these respective CYPs. There is a potential risk for TAK-[ADDRESS_826923] TAK-659 exposure.
TAK-659 was not a  potent reversible inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 
2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4/5 in human liver microsomes at concentrations

these same CYPs at concentrations up to 50 M. In addition, TAK-659 
was not an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, or 3A activity or mRNA expression 
levels in human hepatocytes at concentrations up to 50 M. 
Furthermore, TAK-659 was not an inhibitor of the efflux transporters P-gp 
or BCRP in Caco-2 cells at concentrations up to 100 µM. When these in 
vitro findings are viewed in context of the C max observed at doses up to 
120 mg QD in patients with lymphoma or solid tumors or at doses up to 
160 mg QD in patients with AML, there is low predicted risk for TAK-659 
to cause DDIs via induction or inhibition of CYP enzymes, P-gp, or 
BCRP.
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug-Food  Interactions
To date,  the effect of food on the PK of TAK-[ADDRESS_826924] 1 hour before and no sooner than 2 hours 
after food and beverages except water.
Because grapefruit  juice is considered a strong CYP3A inhibitor, there is 
a potential risk for TAK-659 PK to be altered by [CONTACT_621243]-containing 
food and beverages. Accordingly, consumption of grapefruit-containing 
food and beverages is prohibited during clinical studies of TAK-659.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical  Pharmacodynamics
Plasma inhibitory activity  assays have been performed on plasma 
samples from a number of patients in the Study C34002 to examine 
TAK-659 activity on FLT3 signaling pathways levels. Up to 70% inhibition 
of FLT-3 phosphorylation was observed in samples from patients in the 
60 and 100 mg cohorts and ≥90% inhibition in patients in the 120 mg 
cohort as of the date of data cutoff.
 [IP_ADDRESS] Clinical  Efficacy
As of  the [ADDRESS_826925] responses of CR and PR were reported for 8 patients and 4 
patients, respectively. Of the 12 patients with DLBCL who responded, 2 
had transitioned to stem cell transplant prior to the data cutoff and 6 were 
still receiving study drug as of the data cutoff; [ADDRESS_826926] response of stable disease (SD), and 22 patients experienced 
progressive disease (PD). No response-evaluable patients with solid 
tumors had a best response of CR or partial response (PR). One patient 
had a best response of SD, and the remaining 9 patients experienced 
PD. Among the 2 response-evaluable patients with CLL, 1 had PR and 
was on study in Cycle 4 as of the data cutoff and 1 had SD. Four patients 
with indolent lymphomas responded to treatment with TAK-659. One 
patient with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma achieved a 
CR and is still on study in Cycle 10 as of the data cutoff, 3 patients with 
FL achieved PR, and 1 patient had SD. One of the FL responders 
remains on study in Cycle 22 as of data cutoff.

[IP_ADDRESS] Potential Risks  Based on TAK-659 Clinical Studies
Identified Risks
Infection
Infections, including  pneumonia, P jirovecii pneumonia, CMV, and sepsis 
are an important identified risk for subjects receiving TAK-659 treatment. 
In single agent TAK-659 studies (C34001, C34002, C34004, and 
C34007), most patients (63%) experienced at least [ADDRESS_826931] frequently reported TEAE (16%), 
followed by [CONTACT_621244] (11%). Pneumonia (10%), and sepsis (6%) 
were the most frequently reported Grade ≥3 TEAEs. In TAK-659 
combination studies (C34003, C34005, and C34008), 54% (50 of 93 
patients) experienced at least 1 TEAE of any grade classified under the 
infections and infestations SOC as defined by [CONTACT_165942]. Pneumonia

profile of TAK-659 in relation to the additional cases of pneumonitis were 
identified from review of these SAEs. Pneumonitis and other pulmonary 
toxicities are being closely monitored in TAK-659 clinical studies
Lipase Elevations
Asymptomatic elevation  in lipase is an important potential risk of TAK-
659. In nonclinical studies, lipase was sporadically elevated at high 
doses of TAK-659 in both rats and dogs; however, there was no 
evidence of microscopic organ damage. A TEAE of lipase increased was 
reported in 16% (any Grade) and 14% (Grade ≥3) of subjects treated 
with TAK-659. Theselipase elevations were generally asymptomatic. 
There was 1 SAE of pancreatitis reported in the safety database in 
subjects treated with TAK-659. Monitoring of serum lipase should be 
performed according to the study protocol.
Lymphoid and Hematopoietic  Effects
Lymphoid and  hematopoietic effects are an important potential risk for 
subjects receiving TAK-659 treatment. Neutropenia (any Grade) was 
reported in 20% of subjects treated with TAK-659 as a single agent and 
in combination; Grade ≥3 neutropenia in 18%, and febrile neutropenia 
(any Grade) in 13% of subjects treated. Neutropenia is commonly 
observed in hematologic malignancies and this may provide alternative

protocols. Granulocyte colony stimulating factors can be used
for supportive  measures; guidance for their use is per routine local 
oncology practice, as well as protocol-specific.
[IP_ADDRESS] Potential  Risks and Benefits based on non-clinical studies
Potential risks identified  from nonclinical studies in dogs and rats include:
Lymphoid  and hematopoietic effects that include lymphoid depletion 
and myelosuppression that are associated with thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, and reticulocytopenia. These findings may be associated 
with increased susceptibility to infection, bleeding, and/or anemia.
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_621197], urinary tract, and lens. 
Intestinal  effects included minimal-to-slight mucosal hemorrhaging.
Urinary  and renal tract effects included hyperplasia of transitional 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_621198], dilatation and hemorrhage in the 
renal pelvis that led to hematuria and proteinuria, and urolithiasis with 
possible ureter obstruction. Lens effects included epi[INVESTIGATOR_621199].
Reproductive system effects,  including decreased spermatozoa and 
seminiferous tubule degeneration in the testis and corpora luteal 
necrosis in the ovaries.
Possible  mutation of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).
≥1.07-μM  TAK-659 can inhibit ADP- and collagen-mediated human 
platelet aggregation in the context of this in vitro study.
Growth  plate thickening and disorganization (not relevant to adults).
Risks  listed above are based on toxicology findings in the nonclinical 
studies with TAK-659; they may or may not present with similar 
severity in humans. All of the identified nonclinical target organ 
toxicities were generally reversible and are anticipated to be 
manageable with clinical monitoring and intervention. Clinical study

possible that administration of TAK-659 will result in toxicities that were 
not observed or predicted from the studies completed in rats and dogs.
Lymphoid and Hematopoietic  Effects
Lymphoid and  hematopoietic effects were observed in animals. 
Lymphoid and hematopoietic depletion consisted of depletion of bone 
marrow hematopoietic precursors and decreased lymphocytes in 
lymphoid tissues. There were correlative decreases in circulating 
lymphocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, and reticulocytes, along with 
decreases in thymic and splenic weights. These effects were dose 
dependent, pharmacologically mediated, and generally reversible.

Reproductive Effects
Effects on the  reproductive systems included testicular seminiferous 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_621207]. The reproductive effects are expected to be reversible.
Skeletal Effects  
Effects on the  growth plate and related structures were observed in 
animals. The effects were dose dependent, pharmacologically 
mediated, and reversible and included thickening/disorganization of the 
physis (femur and sternum) and articular-epi[INVESTIGATOR_621208], and 
retention/disorganization of the primary spongiosa. Additionally, the 
effects on the growth plate would not be relevant to adult patients 
whose bone growth plate is closed. 
Genotoxicity 
TAK-659 was mutagenic  in an Ames assay (S typhimurium TA1537) 
after metabolic activation with rat liver enzymes and was aneugenic in 
micronucleus evaluations. Increased micronucleus formation in human 
peripheral blood lymphocytes was primarily associated with positive 
kinetochore staining and, thus, was positive for aneugenic genotoxicity. 
Spleen tyrosine kinase has been implicated in mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_621209] 
(20); therefore, the aneugenic effect of TAK-659 was consistent with its 
pharmacologic mechanism of action. Based on the genotoxic nature of 
TAK-659, its toxicity profile would be acceptable for patients with 
advanced malignancies.

CHOP are not acceptable and require significant improvement with novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (see 
section 1.1). There is increased expression of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling 
components among the molecularly characterized BCR/proliferation subtype of DLBCL, 
including but not limited to spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), a non-receptor cytoplasmic 
tyrosine kinase.28 SYK plays a critical role in BCR signaling-driven tumorigenesis. TAK-
659 ([COMPANY_005] Pharmaceutical Company Limited) is a selective, reversible, and potent 
inhibitor of SYK. With the hypothesis that TAK-659 may generate pronounced antitumor 
effects in lymphomas including DLBCL, it is being clinically investigated in early phase 
clinical trials. Updated results of a phase 1, dose-escalation with expansion cohorts study 
of single agent TAK-659 in mostly relapsed/refractory lymphoma patients was recently 
presented at the International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma in Lugano, 
Switzerland in June 2017.10 The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been determined to 
be 100 mg by [CONTACT_16629]. 65 patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL have been 
treated on study with single agent TAK-659. Encouraging clinical responses have been 
seen in these heavily pretreated DLBCL patients with 12 of 45 (27%) achieving an 
objective response. 8 of 45 patients (18%) have obtained a complete response, and most 
of these have been durable at time of last follow-up. These responses have been seen in 
both the ABC/non-GCB and GCB DLBCL subtypes. Of the drug-related serious adverse 
events seen with TAK-659, there does not appear to be a significant overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_621210] R-CHOP.

^A minimum  of 3 patients will be treated per cohort; a total of 
[ADDRESS_826978]  “3+3” dose escalation design will be utilized. Initially, 3 patients will be 
enrolled at the starting dose (level 1), after which enrollment will be temporarily 
suspended until all 3 patients complete the DLT evaluation period (defined as cycle 2 of 
the study [the first 21-day cycle of TAK-659]).). Once all 3 patients complete the DLT 
period and toxicity data has been submitted, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) will review the data and confirm the presence or absence of any DLTs (defined 
below). The following rules will be used at each dose level to determine whether or not to 
proceed to the next dose level:
If  0 of 3 patients at a given dose level experience a DLT (defined below), then 
escalation will proceed to the next dose level.

oIf  this happens at level 1, de-escalation to level -1 will occur.
oIf  this happens at level 2 or beyond, the previous level will be declared the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
oIf  this happens at level -1, the study will be closed to further accrual and the 
regimen of TAK-659 + R-CHOP will be considered too toxic at any dose.
If  1 of 3 patients at a given dose level experiences a DLT, then an additional 3 slots 
will be added (for a total of 6 patients at that level):
oIf  1 of 6 total experiences a DLT, then escalation will proceed to the next level.
oIf  ≥ 2 of 6 total experience a DLT, the previous level will be declared the MTD. 
NOTE: Whichever  dose level is declared the MTD must have 6 total patients treated at 
that level. For example, if 3 patients are treated at level 2 and 0 patients experience DLT, 
escalation would then proceed to level 3. However, if ≥ 2 patients at level 3 experience 
DLT, enrollment to level 2 would need to be re-opened to enroll an additional 3 patients 
at that level (with 0 or 1 DLT observed in 6 total patients) in order to declare level 2 the 
MTD.
4.3.1 Definitions  of Dose Limiting Toxicity
Although DLT-like  events may occur at any point during treatment, only DLTs 
defined during Cycle 1 of TAK-659 (Cycle 2 of the study) will influence decisions 
regarding dose escalation, expansion of a dose level, or evaluation of 
intermediate dose levels for purposes of MTD determination. Patients will be 
monitored through all cycles of therapy for treatment-related toxicities. Any DLT-
like events occurring during Cycle [ADDRESS_826980] to be 
managed to resolution before starting Cycle 2 with TAK-659.
Toxicity will  be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE version 5.0. DLT is 
defined as any of the events listed below. All adverse events meeting this criteria 
will be considered DLT’s unless the event is clearly unrelated to study therapy. 
Grade  4 neutropenia (ANC <500 cells/mm3) unresolved to ≤Grade 1 (ANC 
>1500 cells/mm3) or baseline for more than 7 consecutive days.

4.4 Toxicity  Management & Dose Delays/Modifications
4.4.1 Recommended  TAK-659 Dose Modifications
TAK-659 is  administered in continuous cycles; therefore, study drug should be 
administered continuously unless AEs occur that meet the dose modification 
criteria as outlined below.
Per the  dose modification guidelines, patients who have the study drug held 
because of treatment-related or possibly related AEs may resume study drug 
treatment after resolution of the AE, but may either maintain the same dose level 
or have doses of study drug reduced (dose reduction) by [CONTACT_2669] 1 dose level. 
Dose reduction levels for TAK-659 are presented in the table below. When a 
dose reduction of TAK-659 occurs, the TAK-659 dose will be reduced to the next 
lower dose that has been established as a safe dose. The dose reduction of 
TAK-659 will, in general, follow a decrement of 20 mg. If initial dose adjustment 
does not provide sufficient relief, the dose of TAK-659 may be further reduced if 
the treating physician considers that the patient is benefiting from study treatment 
and may benefit at a further reduced dose of TAK-659. Up to 2 dose-level 
reductions of TAK-659 due to AEs are generally recommended. If more than 2 
dose-level reductions of TAK-659 are needed to manage TAK-659-related AEs, 
discontinuation of treatment should be considered unless the treating physician 
feels the patient may benefit from continued study treatment after resolution of 
AEs to <Grade 1 or baseline, or a level (must be ≤Grade  2) that is determined to 
be acceptable by [CONTACT_093](s) based on benefit-risk assessment. Dose 
adjustments for R-CHOP are allowed based on standard of care guidelines as 
listed in Table 4.4 and Table 4.6.

Any patient  who receives at least one dose of study therapy will be evaluable for 
toxicity endpoints. Each patient will be assessed for the development of toxicity 
according to the timeframe referenced in the Schedule of Events table). Toxicity 
will be assessed according to CTCAE v5.0. 
4.4.3 Criteria  for Discontinuation of Study Drug(s)
TAK-659 dosing  should be discontinued if patients experience a Grade 4 non-
hematologic toxicity (except those listed in Table 4.5) and/or Grade 4 anemia. If 
TAK-659 dosing is delayed because of TAK-659 related toxicities for >[ADDRESS_826982] of care, stop 
TAK-659. Patients exceeding delays of >[ADDRESS_826983] clinical practice, unless specifically excluded. 
Supportive care agents, such as erythropoietin, G-CSF, blood products (RBC 
and platelet transfusions), and pain medications are permitted as needed per 
American Society of Hematology (ASH)/ASCO guidelines or local institutional 
practice. However, these agents should not be used in this study in a manner 
that would either help establish eligibility for the study or support escalation of 
study drug dose during dose escalation.
Prophylaxis Against Infection
Patients with advanced hematological malignancies may be at an increased risk 
of infection. Prophylactic use of antibiotic, antiviral, or antifungal medication can 
be considered as clinically indicated and as per local standard practice. In 
particular, lymphopenia can develop in association with either treatment or with 
the underlying disease (DLBCL).
Lymphopenia can be associated with reactivation of herpes zoster, CMV, 
herpes simplex and other viruses. Antiviral therapy such as acyclovir, 
gancyclovir, valacyclovir, or other antiviral agents may be initiated as clinically 
indicated although it is strongly recommended. 
PJP prophylaxis should  be initiated with C2 (first dose of combination 
treatment). 
Given their degree of immunosuppression,  patients with posttransplant  
lymphoproliferative
 disease are often at an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_621219]. Consideration should be given to antibiotic, antifungal,  and antiviral 
prophylaxis during therapy, particularly if the patient  is more prone  to

Edema (Including  Periorbital)
Peripheral and  periorbital edema have been observed in patients treated  with 
TAK-659.  Management of the event should follow the standard local practice 
and dose modification as required.
Rash With  or Without Pruritus
Prophylactic measures should  also be considered if a patient develops a rash 
(eg, using a thick, alcohol-free emollient cream on dry areas of the body). In the 
case of rash, the use of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_128104] (eg, prednisone ≤ 10 mg per 
day or equivalent) is permitted.
Hypophosphatemia
Hypophosphatemia has been observed in patients  treated with TAK-659.  
Consider prophylaxis; otherwise refer to dose modification guideline.
Enzyme Elevations  (Transaminase, Amylase and Lipase, CPK and LDH 
Elevations)
Elevations of the enzymes above have been observed. Events are generally 
asymptomatic and reversible with dose interruption. 
LDH elevations have been observed in the majority of patients  exposed to TAK-
659. These elevations have been asymptomatic and the clinical significance is 
unknown. No doses have been interrupted due to increased LDH; however, LDH 
elevations have been observed to be reversible in patients
 who had TAK-659 
interrupted due to other reasons.
4.5 Concomitant  Medications/Procedures
During the  study, patients will be instructed not to take any additional medications 
(including over-the-counter products and supplements) without prior consultation with the 
investigator. At each visit, the investigator will ask the patient about any new medications 
he/she is taking or has taken while on study. All concomitant medications (defined as any 
medication given during the study) and significant nondrug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including physical 
therapy and blood transfusions, should be recorded from signing of the informed consent 
form (ICF) through [ADDRESS_826985].
4.5.1 Required/Permitted  Concomitant Medications 
Required ancillary  medications administered during all cycles: 
• Acetaminophen 650  mg PO and diphenhydramine 50-100 mg IV or PO 30-60 
minutes prior to rituximab. 
• PJP  prophylaxis should be initiated with C2 (first cycle of combination therapy)
• Those  patients who test positive for hepatitis B should be closely monitored for 
evidence of active HBV infection and hepatitis during and for several months 
after rituximab treatment, and should be managed at the discretion of the 
investigator, including possible antiviral medications.

during
 the study.  
Radiation therapy  is prohibited during the study (note that, in general, the 
requirement for local radiation therapy  indicates disease progression).  
Palliative radiotherapy for local pain/symptom  control in a preexisting non-

Intravenous high-dose methotrexate and/or intravenous cytarabine is not 
permitted during study treatment.
Concurrent  systemic administration of TAK-659 with inhibitors or inducers of 
P-gp or strong inhibitors  or inducers of CYP3A are not permitted in this 
study.  In vitro studies indicate that TAK-659 is a substrate for P-gp and that, 
among CYP isozymes,  TAK-659 is preferentially metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5. 
Refer to the list below and Appendix A  for a nonexhaustive list of 
medications,  supplements,  and food products that are inhibitors or inducers 
of P-gp or strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A  based on the US FDA

If a patient experiences  an AE on study and TAK-659 dosing is temporarily 
interrupted because of that AE, the medications listed above and Appendix A  
may be used for AE management if there is no appropriate alternative 
treatment  available per the investigator’s judgment and the dosing is not 
concurrent with study drug. This situation should be evaluated by [CONTACT_1961].  Patients should be closely monitored for potential toxicities.

treatment for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adverse event. Patients will be followed for survival status every 6 
months by [CONTACT_621253] 3 years from treatment 
discontinuation. 
4.10 Removal  of Subjects from Study Treatment and/or Study as a Whole
Patients can be  taken off the study treatment and/or study as a whole at any time at their 
own request, or they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, 
behavioral or administrative reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation must be clearly 
documented on the appropriate eCRF and may include:
Patient  voluntarily withdraws from treatment (follow-up permitted)
Patient  withdraws consent (no follow-up permitted)
Patient  is unable to comply with protocol requirements
Patient  demonstrates disease progression (clinical or radiological progression)
Patient  experiences unacceptable toxicity 
Treating  physician determines that continuation on the study would not be in the 
patient’s best interest
Patient  becomes pregnant 
Patient  develops a second malignancy that requires treatment which would interfere 
with this study
Patient  becomes lost to follow-up (LTF) 
The study is  terminated 
Protocol  violation 
4.11 Patient  Replacement
Patients who sign  consent and/or receive R-CHOP but come off study before receiving 
TAK-[ADDRESS_826992] be observed for one 
cycle (21 days) on TAK-[ADDRESS_826993] experienced a dose limiting toxicity.

6.1 Definitions
6.1.1 Response  will be evaluated, using the Lugano classification for assessment of 
Lymphoma.31 See Appendix D for specific response assessment criteria.
6.1.2 Clinical evaluation  and tumor assessments will be performed periodically, as 
shown in Table 6, based on evaluation of spleen and liver, physical examination 
for superficial disease and B symptoms, radiologic evaluation, and appropriate 
laboratory studies.
6.1.3 A  lesion is categorized based on the location as either a nodal lesion or an 
extranodal lesion if it is located in organs other than lymph nodes or nodal mass, 
but including spleen and liver.
6.1.4 All  tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non-
measurable as follows:
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable  nodal and extranodal lesions:
A lesion  will be called measurable if it can be measured accurately in 2 
perpendicular dimensions and:
For  nodal lesion, if the long axis is >15 mm, regardless of the length 
of the short axis
For  extranodal lesion, if the long and short axes are ≥[ADDRESS_827016] one measurable extranodal lesion. 
6.1.5 Classification  of lymph nodes
[IP_ADDRESS] Lymph  nodes are classified according to their size and/or relationship to 
the disease:
A  lymph node meeting the measurability requirement, but with 
long axis > 15 mm (e.g. short axis cannot be measured 
accurately) will constitute a non-measurable nodal lesion.
A  lymph node not meeting the measurability criteria, but with a 
size of 11 mm to 15 mm in the long axis and >10 mm in the short 
axis will be checked for relationship to disease:
oIf  it is thought to be disease related, it will constitute a 
non-measurable nodal lesion
oIf  it is not thought to be disease related, it will constitute 
an abnormal lymph node, but not a lesion.
All other  lymph nodes will be considered normal and will not constitute nodal 
lesions.
6.1.6 Criteria  for normalization of lesions
[IP_ADDRESS] The normalization  of lesions is defined as follow:
oA  measurable nodal lesion must become ≤ [ADDRESS_827017] decrease to ≤10 mm in the 
short axis and be ≤ [ADDRESS_827018] disappear completely (assigned a size of 
0 mm x 0 mm) to be considered normalized.

Endpoint: Toxicity and  tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_621246], including vital 
signs and  ECOG performance status, and laboratory values to determine incidence and 
grade of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and dose-limiting 
toxicities, as defined in section 4.3.[ADDRESS_827019] cycle (21 days) of TAK-659 combined 
with R-CHOP (study Cycle 2) to determine the maximum tolerated dose. 
6.2.[ADDRESS_827020] met 
the minimal treatment and safety evaluation requirements of the study and/or 
who experience a DLT during Cycle 2. The minimum treatment and safety 
evaluation requirements are met, if, in Cycle 2, the patient has been treated with 
TAK-659 for ≥ 14 days (receiving at least 75% of planned doses of TAK-659 in 
Cycle 2) and observed for ≥ 21 days following the dose on Cycle 2, Day 1 
(C2D1), and is considered to have sufficient safety data by [CONTACT_621255] (DMC) to conclude a DLT did not occur. Patients 
who do not meet these minimum requirements will be regarded as ineligible for 
inclusion as DLT-evaluable patients for the given dose cohort and may be 
replaced within the same cohort. 
6.3 Secondary  Endpoints
Endpoints: 
6.3.1 Overall  response rate (ORR), using Lugano criteria (2014), will be defined as the 
percentage of  subjects with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response 
(PR) as assessed by [CONTACT_473]. Response will be assessed by [CONTACT_10052]/CT at 
screening, PET/CT after C3, and by [CONTACT_10052]/CT at the End of Treatment visit. All patients 
who receive at least one dose of TAK-659, have sites of measurable disease at baseline, 
and [ADDRESS_827021]-baseline disease assessment are evaluable for this endpoint. This will be 
assessed at 3 months.
6.3.2  Progression free  survival (PFS) will defined as the time from study enrollment until 
progression/recurrence of lymphoma or death from any cause. This will be assessed at 
12 and 18 months.
6.3.3 Overall  survival (OS) will be defined as the time from study enrollment until death 
from any cause. This will be assessed at 12 and 18 months.
7.0 ADVERSE  EVENTS
This study  will be conducted in compliance with the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) of the 
Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (please refer to 
Appendices for additional information). The level of risk attributed to this study requires high-risk 
monitoring, as outlined in the DSMP. In addition, the study will abide by [CONTACT_360610], as  set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations.  
7.1 Adverse Event Monitoring
Adverse event data  collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical 
trial, are done to ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as well as those 
who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a 
routine manner at scheduled times during a trial (see Section 5 for time points). In 
addition, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for 
optimal monitoring and patient safety and care.

Other Study  Number:  IISR-2017-101972
Prot Amnd 4/Version  Date:04. 3.2020 49All patients experiencing  an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to study drug, 
will be followed until: 
the adverse event resolves or  the symptoms or signs that constitute the adverse 
event return to baseline; 
any  abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline; 
there  is a satisfactory explanation other than the study drug for the changes 
observed; or
death.
7.2 Definitions  & Descriptions
7.2.1 Adverse  Event
Adverse Events  may be spontaneously identified by [CONTACT_5363]/or in 
response to an open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], 
physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures.  Any clinically relevant 
deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an 
AE.  When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying 
pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event.  
An adverse  event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving 
study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an experimental intervention, whether or not related to 
the intervention. 
Recording of  AEs should be done in a concise manner using standard, 
acceptable medical terms. In general, AEs are not procedures or measurements, 
but should reflect the reason for the procedure or the diagnosis based on the 
abnormal measurement. Preexisting conditions that worsen in severity or 
frequency during the study should also be recorded (a preexisting condition that 
does not worsen is not an AE). Further, a procedure or surgery is not an AE; 
rather, the event leading to the procedure or surgery is considered an AE.
If a specific  medical diagnosis has been made, that diagnosis or syndrome 
should be recorded as the AE whenever possible.  However, a complete 
description of the signs, symptoms and investigations which led to the diagnosis 
should be provided. For example, if clinically significant elevations of liver 
function tests are known to be secondary to hepatitis, “hepatitis” and not 
“elevated liver function tests” should be recorded. If the cause is not known, the 
abnormal test or finding should be recorded as an AE, using appropriate medical 
terminology (e/g/ thrombocytopenia, peripheral edema, QT prolongation).
7.2.2 Severity  of AEs
All non-hematologic adverse  events will be graded according to the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The 
CTCAE v5.0 is available at 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCA
E_v5_Quick_Reference_8.5x11.pdf 
If no  CTCAE grading is available, the severity of an AE is graded as follows:
Mild  (grade 1): the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal daily 
activities.
Moderate  (grade 2): the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily 
activities.
IRB #: STU00207880-CR0003 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 4/11/2022 through 4/10/2023.
NU Study Number: NU  18H02
Other Study  Number:  IISR-2017-101972
Prot Amnd 4/Version  Date:04. 3.2020 50Severe (grade  3): the event makes the patient unable to perform normal daily 
activities or  significantly affects his/her clinical status.
Life-threatening  (grade 4): the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event.
Fatal (grade  5): the event caused death.
7.2.3 Serious  Adverse Events (SAEs)
All SAEs,  regardless of attribution, occurring from time of signed informed 
consent, through [ADDRESS_827022] medical occurrence 
that:
Results  in death.
If death  results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be 
reported as event (SAE) itself.
Is  life-threatening.
The patient  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to 
an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
Requires  in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9959] ≥ 24 hours.
Results  in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.
Is  a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Is  an important medical event.
Any event  that does not meet the above criteria, but that in the judgment of 
the investigator jeopardizes the patient, may be considered for reporting as a 
serious adverse event. The event may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious 
Adverse Event“. 
For example:  allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home; convulsions that may not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; development of drug abuse or drug dependency.
7.2.[ADDRESS_827023] or Others
A UPI[INVESTIGATOR_199901] a  type of SAE that includes events that meet ALL of the following 
criteria:
Is  unanticipated  in terms of nature, severity, or frequency
Places  the research subject or others at a different or greater risk of harm
Is  deemed to be at least possibly related to participation in the study.   
7.3 Adverse Event Reporting
7.3.1 Routine Reporting
All routine  adverse events, such as those that are expected, or are unlikely or 
definitely not related to study participation, are to be reported on the appropriate 
eCRF . Routine AEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1578] (DMC) 
according to the study’s phase and risk level, as outlined in the DSMP. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_827024] dose of 
treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must 
also be reported accordingly.
1) Identify  the type of adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v 5.0.
2) Grade  the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v 5.0.
3) Determine whether the  adverse event is related to the protocol therapy.

Possible:  AE may be related to the study treatment.
Unlikely:  AE not likely to be related to the study treatment.
Unrelated:  AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.
4) Determine the  prior experience of the adverse event.
Expected events  are those that have been previously identified as

Each tablet should be swallowed separately with a sip of water. A total of 
approximately 8 ounces (240 mL) of water should be taken with the prescribed 
doses of TAK-659. Patients must swallow the tablets whole; the tablets must not 
be chewed, crushed, or manipulated in any way before swallowing.
Patients should  be instructed to take their study medication at approximately the 
same time each day and to not take more than the prescribed dose at any time. If 
a patient fails to take TAK-659 one day, or if a patient does not take TAK-659 at 
their scheduled dosing time (± 6 hours of the scheduled dosing time), that dose 
should be skipped, and the patient must not make dose adjustments to account 
for the missed dose on subsequent days, for example, by [CONTACT_41680] a double dose of 
study drug(s) on the following day. Patients should record any skipped doses in 
their dosing diary (and resume dosing at the next scheduled time with the

8.2.3 Mode of  action
Rituximab is  a chimeric murine/human gamma 1 kappa monoclonal antibody 
(Chinese hamster ovary [CHO] transfectoma). It recognizes the CD20 antigen 
expressed on normal B cells and most malignant B-cell lymphomas. It binds with 
high affinity to CD20-positive cells, performs human effector functions in vitro, 
and depletes B cells in vivo. The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 
antigen on B-lymphocytes and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions 
to mediate B cell lysis in vitro. The biological effect is manifested by B-cell 
depletion in peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow.

Tumor lysis  syndrome resulting in renal failure has been described, and 
occasional fatalities noted. Tumor lysis syndrome is more likely in patients with 
high numbers of circulating malignant cells (≥ 25,000/μL).  Severe 
mucocutaneous reactions associated with rituximab include Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194]. The onset of these reactions has been 
from 1-3 weeks.
Less severe  infusion reactions are common with rituximab. These include fever, 
chills, and dyspnea. The mechanism of rituximab infusion reactions is thought to 
be secondary to release of cytokines. If a reaction occurs, then the infusion 
should be stopped until the symptoms resolve, and then restarted at a 50% 
slower rate. 
Recent reports  describe hepatitis B reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic 
failure and death in some patients with hematologic malignancies treated with 
rituximab. The majority of these patients received rituximab in combination with 
chemotherapy. The median time to diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately [ADDRESS_827039] dose. 
Exacerbation or reactivation of other viral infections has also been reported with 
rituximab. Recent reports describe JC virus reactivation leading to progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients who were receiving rituximab. 
Patients presenting with new neurologic findings (e.g., major changes in vision, 
unusual eye movements, loss of balance or coordination, confusion) should be

Vincristine is  commercially available in 1 mL, 2 mL, and 5 mL vials in a 
concentration of 1 mg/mL.
8.5.[ADDRESS_827047]  common toxicity associated with vincristine is neurotoxicity. Peripheral 
manifestations of neurotoxicity include: numbness of extremities, paresthesias, 
loss of deep tendon reflexes, neuropathic pain and muscle weakness. GI 
manifestations of neurotoxicity include constipation, and adynamic ileus. Cranial 
nerve manifestations include: diplopia, hoarseness, tinnitus, jaw pain (the latter 
usually occurring with the first dose of vincristine). Orthostatic hypotension & 
SIADH may also be seen. Vincristine is a vesicant and may cause tissue 
necrosis upon extravasation. This is more likely with bolus injections as opposed 
to dilute infusions
8.5.11 Nursing  implications
Vincristine should  befurther diluted in 50 mL 0.9% sodium chloride to final 
concentration 0.0015 – 0.08 mg/ml and infused over 10 minutes 
Precaution: Maximum  single dose is 2 mg.

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Study  Design/Study Endpoints
This is  a Phase I dose escalation study that will accrue between 12 and 18 patients.  
10.2 Sample  Size and Accrual
The design  of the study is described in detail in Section 4.3. If there are insufficient 
patients evaluable for toxicity at the end of 18 patients, the protocol will be amended to 
add the required number of additional patients.  
10.3 Data  Analyses Plans
Sections 6.2  and 6.3 define evaluability for toxicity, DLT determination and response 
(ORR).
Using only  patients evaluable for toxicity (Section 6.2.1), safety and tolerability of TAK-
659 will be determined by [CONTACT_621264], timing, frequency, 
severity and attribution.  
Dose limiting toxicities  are defined in Section 4.3.1.  The determination of maximum 
tolerated dose is defined in Section 4.3. The MTD will be determined using only patients 
who are evaluable for DLT determination (Section 6.2.1). 
Preliminary efficacy of TAK-659  will be assessed by [CONTACT_621265] 95% exact 
binomial confidence intervals, using all response-evaluable patients (Section 6.3) as the 
denominator.  ORR is defined as the percentage of subjects with a confirmed complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by [CONTACT_473]. This will be 
assessed at [ADDRESS_827054] (IRB) Approval and Consent 
It is  expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance 
with federally mandated regulations. The IRB should approve the consent form and 
protocol.
In obtaining  and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the 
applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Before recruitment  and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full 
explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. 
Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by [CONTACT_10000]. Once this essential information has been 
provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the

11.3 Registration  Procedures
For potential  patients, study teams are asked to inform the QAM of the date and time that 
the patient will need to be registered ([EMAIL_3934]).  
BEFORE a  patient can be treated on study, please complete and submit the following 
items to confirm eligibility and receive an identification number:
Patient’s  signed and dated informed consent form (upload to NOTIS and keep 
original hard copy in a secure location/study chart)
Copy  of the pathology report (upload to NOTIS)
Signed  and dated Eligibility Checklist (upload to NOTIS and keep original hard copy 
in a secure location/study chart)
The QAM will  review all source documentation required to confirm eligibility that is readily 
available in the patient’s electronic medical record (EMR).  Any information that is not 
available in the EMR must be de-identified and emailed to the QAM. Once the QAM 
confirms the patient is eligible, he or she will register the patient, assign a subject 
identification number, provide a cohort assignment (as applicable), and send a 
confirmation of registration to involved personnel. Registration will then be complete and 
the patient may begin study treatment. 
11.[ADDRESS_827056]  Complaints or Medication Errors (Including Overdose)
A product complaint is  a verbal, written, or electronic expression that implies 
dissatisfaction regarding the identity, strength, purity, quality, or stability of a drug 
product.  Individuals who identify a potential product complaint situation should 
immediately contact [CONTACT_299736] (see below) and report the event. 
Whenever possible, the associated product should be maintained in accordance with the 
label instructions pending further guidance from a [COMPANY_005] Quality representative.
A medication  error is a preventable event that involves an identifiable patient and that leads 
to inappropriate medication use, which may result in patient harm.  While overdoses and 
underdoses constitute medication errors, doses missed inadvertently by a patient do not.  
Investigators must record all medication errors (including overdose) on the appropriate 
CRF form. Individuals who identify a potential medication error situation should 
immediately contact [CONTACT_11750] (see below) and report the event.

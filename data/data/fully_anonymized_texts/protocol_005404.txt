2 Introduction , Background Information and Scientific Rationale  
2.1 Background  Information  and Relevant Literature  
 
2.1.1   Intensive  glycemic control is of unclear benefit and carries increased risk for older adults with 
diabetes.  A number of randomized controlled trials, including the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in 
Diabetes (ACCORD) trial,1 the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron 
Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial,2 and the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial 
(VADT)3, found that intensive glycemic control was not protective for macrovascular complications of 
diabetes including myocardial infarction or stroke. Although the [LOCATION_008] Prospective Diabetes 
Study ([LOCATION_006]PDS) did find a reduction in myocardial infarction in the long term after intensive glycemic  
control, this study enrolled middle -aged patients at time of diabetes diagnosis.[ADDRESS_526626] that tight glycemic control is primarily 
beneficial to patients with newly diagnosed diabetes and a l ong life expectancy; these characteristics do 
not apply to most older patients, many of whom have been living with diabetes as a chronic disease.7 
Furthermore, these trials demonstrated the potential for harm with tight glycemic control, notably

writing by [CONTACT_417549],1,2 as well as a suggestion of increased all -cause mortality.1 Indeed, older 
adults are particularly susceptible to harms related to hypoglycemia in diabetes, including emergent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_417537].8-12 Intensive glycemic treatment may also lead to increased 
risk of polypharmacy and adverse medicine interactions for older adults with multiple chronic conditions.13  
 
2.1.2  The American Geriatric Society’s Choosing Wisely guideline recommends moderate glycemic 
control.  The third Choosing Wisely recommendation from the American Geriatric Society is: “Avoid using 
medications other than metformin to achieve hemoglobin A1c<7.5% in most older adults; moderate 
control is generally better.”14 Furthermore, as shorter life expectancy and greater comorbidity burden may 
decrease the benefits and increase the risks of tight glycemic control, the Choosing Wisely campaign 
suggests using these markers of health status to identify gly cemic targets for older patients with diabetes. 
Glycemic target HbA1c ranges are provided for older adults in three categories: 7.0 -7.5% for healthy 
adults with a long life expectancy, 7.5 -8.0% for patients with moderate comorbidity and a life expectancy 
of less than 10 years, and 8.0 -9.0% for patients with multiple comorbid conditions and a shorter life 
expectancy.7,[ADDRESS_526627]. Caroline Blaum on 
categorization of older adults with diabetes into three clinical groups based on health status;[ADDRESS_526628] outcomes for older adults with 
comorbid conditions in observational or modeling s tudies.19-21 Additionally, the American Diabetes 
Association (ADA) and others have recommended similar health status categories related to HbA1c 
targets in older adults.11,17,[ADDRESS_526629] -to-change behavior.  The field of 
behavioral economics (BE) seeks to combine principles of standard economics a nd psychology to 
recognize the limitations of the classical economic framework that views human decision -makers as 
purely rational actors who make decisions by [CONTACT_417550] 
(sometimes termed Homo economicus ).29  In reality, humans are predictably irrational,30 making common 
decision errors that are explicable through a set of psychological principles, and are therefore predictable .  
The field of behavioral economics posits that these decision errors, once recognized, can be harnessed 
to encourage desired be haviors rather than inhibit them.31 
 
2.1.4   Decision errors fall into a typology of recognizable classes with known mechanisms.  Traits 
contributing to decision errors i nclude loss aversion, anchoring, overweighting of small probabilities, 
present bias, regret aversion, sensitivity to defaults, and the power of social comparisons.32 Once 
recognized, each of these decision errors can be harnessed and overcome, often in the form of gentle 
“nudges” that make a desired behavior more likely.33-36  Loss aversion occurs when  a loss is more 
distressing than a gain of equivalent value;37,38 thus, presenting rewards using a loss rather than a gain 
frame can be an effective motivator.  Anchoring occurs when the decision -maker compares potential 
outcomes to some specified or implied reference level;[ADDRESS_526630] 
information presented, so adjustment of the scale and/or st arting point of a choice set can influence the 
resulting decisions. Present bias, also called hyperbolic discounting,40 occurs when outcomes occurring in 
the near future carry much more weight than those occurring further into the future.41  Human beings tend 
to overweigh small probabilities, one feature that contributes to the popularity of lotteries.42,43 Regret 
aversion can be a highly motivating force in determining future actions.44-46  Regret lotteries are a 
behavioral economic intervention simultaneously targeting probabilistic errors, present bias, and regret; in 
this approach, rewards are contingent on a desired behavior and participants are inform ed that they 
would have won if they had only completed it.47,48   Defaults are a powerful driver of decisions, carrying 
implications of superiority or endorsement and taking advantage of decisional inertia; examples exist in 
such diverse domains as participation in retirement plans49 and organ donation50 that demonstrate 
dramatic differences in participation as a result of the chosen default option. Social comparisons have

writing by [CONTACT_417551] a number of settings to be effective in influencing behavior,24,51 as people tend to be 
heavily motivated by [CONTACT_417552];52,53 the 
phenomenon of social desirability bias is well documented.54,55 
 
2.1.5   Substantial  evidence shows the benefits and limitations of clinical decision support on clinical care.   
Electronic health records (EHRs) now dominate the landscape, influencing nearly every clinical decision, 
workflow, and order placed by [CONTACT_37157].  While EHRs have been successful in standardizing 
documentation, facilitating data sharing, and improving safety, their impact on clinical decision making has 
been mixed.  Clinical decision support (CDS) is the primary EHR tool for influencing c linical decision making 
and promoting adherence to clinical guidelines. CDS entails providing clinicians, patients, and other 
healthcare stakeholders with pertinent knowledge, templates, and/or person -specific information, 
intelligently filtered or present ed at appropriate times, to enhance health and healthcare.56 CDS is an 
effective tool for improving provider performance and patient outcomes ;57 a meta -analysis of 25 randomized 
controlled trials found strong evidence that CDS improves care (odds ratio 1.42, 95% confidence interval 
1.27 to 1.58).[ADDRESS_526631] be integrated into the relevant provider’s wo rkflow.61 CDS can take many forms; to date, alerts and 
reminders have been the dominant CDS tools.[ADDRESS_526632] of EHRs and CDS to improve healthcare outcomes.62  
 
2.1.6   New studies indicate that combining behavioral economic and EHR clinical de cision support tools 
offers promise for improving guideline adherence.  Integrating behavioral economics and electronic health 
records using various CDS tools is a novel approach to improving adherence to guidelines that also 
seeks to minimize negative impa cts on clinical workflow and cognitive load.  For example, Meeker et al. 
integrated three BE concepts (suggested alternatives, accountable justification, and peer comparisons) 
into the EHR at 50 primary care practices to significantly (~5 -7%) reduce inappr opriate antibiotic 
prescribing for upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073].[ADDRESS_526633], to promote clinician adherence to the Choosing Wisely guideline fo r 
diabetes management in older adults.   Specific areas of innovation include:  
 
• Minimal impact on clinician workflow or cognitive workload .  Unlike most new CDS systems, the 
proposed BE -EHR module will have limited negative impact on clinical workflow and c ognitive load. 
BE tools inherently by[CONTACT_417553].66 Instead it leverages the peripheral route, which uses contextual cues and other 
influencing tools to nudge clinicians to choose actions consistent with stated guidelines.  
 
• Extending the power of BE by [CONTACT_417554].   Several BE approaches 
have demonstrated efficacy. By [CONTACT_417555] a 
customizable EHR module, we will amplify the potential impact of BE on clinician guideline adherence 
when tre ating older people with diabetes . 
 
• A flexible, scalable, modular intervention .  The creation of the BE -EHR module serves as a highly 
scalable platform for embedding BE -based CDS into any EHR system. The proposed module will 
guide other EHR users through a menu of customizable options that can switch on (or off) various 
BE-derived CDS tools to replicate our intervention for improving clinician adherence to diabetes 
management guidelines in older adults. More importantly, this module can be easily applied to many 
other conditions in older adults and other populations where combining BE with EHR -based clinical 
decision support will be useful for improving guideline adherence.

 • A scalable, interoperable, standards -based solution . The BE -EHR tool will follow stand ards-
based development approaches, enabling widespread adoption across healthcare systems and 
diverse EHR platforms.  
2.2 Rationale  
This study aims to evaluate  a new BE -EHR module to improve adherence to Choosing Wisely guidelines 
among older adults with diabet es.  
2.3 Potential  Risks & Benefits  
2.3.1  Known Potential Risks  
The risk is not greater than minimal risk (i.e., risk encountered in daily life or in the course  of usual 
clinical practice). Individual case determinations of potential safety gaps will never  be released to 
supervisors of any clinicians whose charts are being reviewed. None of the  study  investigators has any 
oversight capacity over any  clinicians.  
2.3.[ADDRESS_526634], our team has successfully 
identified the  potential  benefit of connecting interventions with clinical workflows, and will assess  a novel  
BE-EHR module to enable improved, guideline -consistent care of older adults with diabetes.  
 
3 Objectives and Purpose  
3.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate  a customized  EHR toolkit that applies behavioral 
economic insights to promote appropriate diabetes care in older adults based on the American Geriatric 
Society’s Cho osing Wisely  (CW)  guideline.  
3.2 Secondary Objectives (if applicable)  
The secondary objective of the study is to continue to assess the usability  of the proposed BE -EHR 
module in clinical practice.  
 
4 Study Design  and Endpoints  
4.1 Description of Study Design  
NYU La ngone Health has ambulatory care sites in the five boroughs of [LOCATION_001] City (NYC) as well as in 
suburbs of [LOCATION_001] and New Jersey. Sites include academic practices, many community -based 
practices and a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC); many are m ultispecialty. Physicians in these 
practices form the NYU Faculty Group Practice (FGP) consisting of 351 total practices, including 81 
primary care and 21 endocrinology practices. The NYU Brooklyn Family Health Center (FHC) is the 
second largest FQHC in th e nation and has [ADDRESS_526635] EPIC + the BE -
EHR module.  
4.2 Intervention  
The BE-EHR module  includes six components : 1) a tailored advisory for patients over 75 with diabetes, 2) 
medication refill protocol with information on Choosing Wisely guidelines, 3) pre -population of the 
medication preference list with metformin, 4) lab result protocol with information on Choosing Wisely

writing by [CONTACT_417556], 5) peer comparisons regarding performance meeting guidelines, and 6) media campaign with 
information about Choosing Wisely guidelines. The set of nudges is referred to collectively as the BE -
EHR module.  
 
To tailor the intervention appropriately, we use a life expectancy algorithm to address different target 
patient populations with different CW guidelines. The life expectancy algorithm was built into the BE -EHR 
module to drive timing and content of module firings that incorporate both patient life expectancy (high, 
medium, low) and target glycemic index per the CW guideline. These categories are defined as follows:   
1) healthy older adults with l ong life expectancy (>10 years): HbA1c target range of 7 -7.5%;  
2) those with moderate comorbidity and a moderate life expectancy (3 -10 years): HbA1c target range of 
7.5-8%; 
3) those with multiple comorbidities and shorter life expectancy ( 3 years): HbA1c target range of 8 -9%. 
4.3 Randomization  
There are currently 81 primary care practices in our FGP. Practice sites will be randomized using variable 
block sizes of 4 and 6 to ensure balance, with an even randomization ratio that will result in half of the 
sites randomized to the BE -EHR module activation (BE -EHR) and half randomized to usual care (UC). 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_417557] (<= 100 patients vs > 100 patients over 75 with diabetes) 
to ensure balance. [CONTACT_103527] will request that th e randomization scheme be generated by [CONTACT_417558], in order to 
maintain blinding of assignment by [CONTACT_3476].  
4.4 Study En dpoints  
Outcomes measured at the prescr iption encounter level include whether the prescription is for a diabetes 
medication other than metformin, and whether the patient’s most recent HbA1c value is within the 
Choosing Wisely HbA1c range guidelines for his/her age and morbidity category; these will be combined 
to classify the encounter as CW -compliant or CW -noncompliant. Outcomes measured at the physician 
level include these two measures, aggregated as a proportion of total prescription encounters within all 
eligible patients .

If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_110791](s) for the termination or suspension.  
 
Circumstan ces that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Determination of futility  
 
Study  activities  may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are 
addressed and satisfy the sponsor and/or IRB. 
 
6 Study Schedule  
Participants will be included in this study by [CONTACT_417560] e of meeting eligibility criteria and having a patient 
encounter during the study period  (i.e. the trial)  of eighteen months from the date of randomization .  
There are no study -specific visits.   Any patient meeting criteria who has one or more patient enco unters 
during the 18 -month study period will be included.  Therefore, no study -specific visits are relevant for this 
study , so there is no schedule of visits .

7 Study Procedures/Evaluations  
There are no study -specific procedures that patients will undergo.  They will receive care as usual by [CONTACT_417561].  In order to evaluate Choosing Wisely compliance status, the BE -EHR algorithm will 
capture information on demographics, diagnoses in the patient’s problem list, prescription history , and 
relevant lab results (i.e. allergies and blood glucose (HbA1c)) .  The study team members will not collect 
this information directly ; data will be collected in NYULH’s EHR system, EPIC, and an EPIC Reporting 
analyst will extract  the relevant parameters from the EHR into a  report. The study team members only 
receive the ultimate determination from the algorithm that the patient is either CW -compliant or CW -
noncompliant.  
7.1 Procedures/Evaluations  
Practice sites will be randomized using variable block sizes of 4 and 6 to ensure balance, with an even 
randomizat ion ratio that will result in half of the sites randomized to the BE -EHR module activation (BE -
EHR) and half randomized to usual care (UC). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_417557] (<= 100 
patients vs > 100 patients over 75 with diabetes) to ensur e balance.  See Section 4.[ADDRESS_526638].  Patients 75 and over with one of the included codes are eligible.  The algorithm is outlined 
below as well as a description of each component of the interventional module:  
1. Evaluation of Choosing Wisely compliance using a built -in algorithm.  The life expectancy 
algorithm was built into the BE -EHR module to drive timing and content of module firings that 
incorporate both patient life expectancy (high, medium, low) and target glycemic index per the 
CW guideline. These categories are defined as  follows:  
1) healthy older adults with long life expectancy (>10 years): HbA1c target range of 7 -7.5%  
2) those with moderate comorbidity and a moderate life expectancy (3 -10 years): HbA1c target 
range of 7.5-8% 
3) those with multiple comorbidities and shorter life ex pectancy ( 3 years): HbA1c target range 
of 8-9% 
2. Firings of various module components using internal EPIC reporting.  Each of the six components 
is triggered when a participant who has lower than recommended glycemic control is encountered 
in the system.  
1) Tailored Advisory: The Tailored Advisory nudge activates in Epic for any patient who is not 
CW compliant. For each patient seen, clinicians can respond by [CONTACT_17325] “Agree with

explain” option, with space for free text comments. A response is not required.  
2) Refill Protocol: The Refill Protocol nudge activates in Epic any time a medication refill for 
either Metformin or a non -Metformin diabetes medication is generated for a patient over 75  
3) Preference List: The Preference List nudge is a system level nudge at the pi[INVESTIGATOR_185911]. 
Metformin is listed at the top of the page as the choice for “First -line Type 2 Diabetes,” 
without restricting orders for non -Metformin m edications.  
4) Lab Result: The Lab Result nudge activates in Epic whenever there is a new A1c lab result 
for a non -CW compliant patient; the alert remains active in Epic for seven days following the 
result.  
5) Peer Comparison: The Peer Comparison nudge is sent v ia a secured Microsoft Outlook 
account once per month. The subject line of the email is “Message from the desk of Dr. 
[Insert Practice Director Name]” and the email content includes three graphics: a CW 
compliance rate for the individual provider, a CW com pliance rate for the clinician’s practice 
site, and a CW compliance rate across all NYU Langone practices. Depending on whether 
the clinician’s CW compliance rate was above or below the rate of their respective practice, 
the provider receives either a “neg ative” or “positive” version of the email  
6) Campaign: The campaign toolkit for dissemination includes three gameshow -themed 
animations (Price is Right, Jeopardy, and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire), as well as a 
flashcard deck that quizzes physicians on CW be st practices. The Price is Right campaign 
includes three unique variations and the Jeopardy campaign includes four unique variations.

8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency  (i.e., not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e., possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156])  
Study number : s19 -[ZIP_CODE]   Page 11 
Version  date: 10/1 1/2019    
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the NYU School of Medicine and Langone Health.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in 
writing by [CONTACT_4530]  
 • Suggests that the resear ch places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be  adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_417563] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or  incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require  intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result 
in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events .  
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_417564], the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the 
subject’s personal physician, b elieves might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The 
investigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a 
subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably  be related to this study.  
8.[ADDRESS_526639] seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events should be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and also in th e appropriate adverse event module of the case report 
form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should 
recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events occ urring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or 
participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that  are still ongoing at the end of the study period 
must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
study period and is considered to be possibly related to study participation should be recorded and 
repor ted immediately.

Version  date: 10/1 1/[ADDRESS_526640] be reported if they  are: 
• related to study participation,  
• unexpected, and  
• serious or involve risks to subjects or others.  
 
For Narrative Reports of Safety Events  
If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the time of 
the initial report includes:  
• Study identifier  
• Study Center  
• Subject number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  • Current status  
• Whether study treatment was discontinued  
• The reason why the event is classified as 
serious  
• Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study treatment  
8.3.1  Investigator reporting: notifying the IRB  
Federal regulations require timely reporting by [CONTACT_94106].  The following describes the NYULMC IRB reporting requirements, 
though Investigators at participating sites are r esponsible for meeting the specific requirements of their 
IRB of record.  
 
Report Promptly, but no later than 5 working days:  
Researchers are required to submit reports of the following problems promptly but  no later than 5 working 
days from the time the i nvestigator becomes aware of the event:  
• Unanticipated problems including adverse events  that are unexpected and related  
– Unexpected : An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately 
reflected in the protocol -related documents, s uch as the IRB -approved research protocol, any 
applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent document 
and other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts.  
– Related to the research procedures : An event is related to the research procedures if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event was more likely than not to be 
caused by [CONTACT_28821].  
– Harmful : either caused harm to subjects or others, or placed them at increased risk  
 
Other Reportable events:  
The following events also require prompt reporting to the IRB, though no later than 5 working days : 
• Complaint of a research subject  when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint 
cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol deviations or violations  (includes intentional and accidental/unintentional deviations 
from the IRB approved protocol) for any of the followin g situations:  
– one or more participants were placed at increased risk of harm  
– the event has the potential to occur again  
– the deviation was necessary to protect a subject from immediate harm  
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Incarceration of a participant  when the  research was not previously approved under Subpart C 
and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
• New Information indicating a change to the risks or potential benefits  of the research, in 
terms of severi ty or frequency. (e.g. analysis indicates lower -than-expected response rate or a 
Study number : s19 -[ZIP_CODE]   Page 13 
Version  date: 10/1 1/[ADDRESS_526641]; Other research finds arm of study has no therapeutic value; 
FDA labeling change or withdrawal from market)  
 
Reporting Process  
The reportab le events noted above will be reported to the IRB using a Reportable New Information 
submission and will include a description of the event with information regarding its fulfillment of the 
above criteria, follow -up/resolution, and need for revision to con sent form and/or other study 
documentation. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_65036]’s study file.  
9 Study Oversight  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_417538] e safety of the study at her site.  This 
safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted 
above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan  (see 
Section 11: Study  Auditing, Monitoring and Inspecting).  Medical monitoring will include a regular 
assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.  
[ADDRESS_526642] higher rates of CW compliance . 
10.2 Sample Size Determination  
Our preliminary  data indicate that approximately 30 -40% of eligible patients have care that is CW -
compliant. We wish to be able to detect an increase in the rate of CW -compli ant care of ten percentage 
points or more. We conservatively estimate an ICC (intra -class correlation coefficient, a measure of the 
degree of additional correlation among providers within the same practice) of 0.05; with an average of 
four providers per pr actice site at [ADDRESS_526643] of 1.15. The sample of 280 
providers becomes an effective sample size of 244, providing approximately 87% power to detect a 
difference of ten percentage points between the study arms.  
10.[ADDRESS_526644] to accommodate 
clustering of providers within practices. We will assess whether negative binomial regression is warranted 
because of overdispersion. We will also explore non -parametric methods such as quantile regression and 
other rank -based approaches. Although randomization should obviate the need for any additional 
adjustment, we will explore whether adjustment for provider -level characteristics, such as demographics, 
panel size, or insurance mix, is necessar y.

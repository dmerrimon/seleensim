Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IRB [ZIP_CODE].0 10]  Effective: 9/20/[ADDRESS_123898]. Guerrero’s recruit ment to Mayo on June 2018, all remaining patients in thi s trial are at the at the 1 -
year follow-up stage or beyond. These visits will be conducted at the respective sites in accordance to the procedural protocol and under approved IRBs at the different sites. The data gathered at the follow up visits will be entered into the existing electronic data capture database. Mayo Clinic staff will gather the data collected at all sites  for analysis, and work with the sites to  address any issues or protocol deviations.  
 Plan for collection and management of data from all centers:  The electronic case report forms (e-CRFs) are designed to accommodate the study design and requirements. 
Modification of e- CRFs will only be made if  deemed necessary by [CONTACT_16170]. Primary data 
collection based on source documented hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111205]. Electronic CRFs will be completed online. All applicable eCRFs will be a utomatically available to 
the study coordinator at the sites as new patients are enrolled in the study. All clinical sites will be monitored periodically by [CONTACT_111206], accuracy of e -CRFs, and compliance to applicable 
regulations. Evident patterns of non- compliance with respect to these standards will be cause for the site to be 
put on probation. If corrective actions are not subsequently undertaken, the clinical site will be asked to withdraw from the trial.  
 The online dat abase will reside on a central server accessible through the Internet  by [CONTACT_111207]. 
Conventional data verification sub-routines will be extensively programmed to test entry and logical errors, while all individual (study patient based) case report forms will be linked for cross- reference. Periodic analysis 
of each data field (across cases) will be performed in order to examine the expected distributions of data, and to identify outliers for possible data errors. All e- CRFs will be subjected to initial inspection for omitted data, data 
inconsistencies, and deviations. The resolution of data inconsistencies will be done using electronic tracking and will be resolved by [CONTACT_977].  
 Process for reporting and evaluating protocol events and deviati ons from all centers:  
 The patients will be followed closely by [CONTACT_111208]. All adverse events (AEs) will be reported by [CONTACT_111209]. For the purpose of this study, an adverse event is any undesirable medical occurrence in a patient. This definition does not depend on a causal relationship with the device or the protocol requirements. Expected clinical and non-significant clinical adverse events will not be reported. Adverse events may be volunteered by [CONTACT_1962], elicited by [CONTACT_18370], or collected via observation by [CONTACT_737]. All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_111210]/or procedure, and whether or not the event meets serious criteria. If it is

 determined that an AE has occurred, the investigator should obtain all the information required to complete the 
AE Form of the CRF. Source documents will be acquired by [CONTACT_111211] (CEC) in  a timely manner to ensure timely assessment and adjudication of the 
event as appropriate. In addition, patients will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_093], and/or study coordinator if any significant adverse events occur between study visits.  The investigator s at each site will not deviate from the protocol without the prior written approval of the 
sponsor investigator except in medical emergencies or in unforeseen, isolated instances where minor changes are made that will not increase the patient’s risk or affect the validity of the trial. In medical emergencies, prior approval for protocol deviations will not be required, but the sponsor investigator must be notified within [ADDRESS_123899] excessive protocol compliance issues.

HIPAA Identifiers and Protected Health Information (PHI)  
 Protected health information is medical data that can be linked to the subject directly or through a combination of indirect identifiers.  
 
Recording i dentifiers (including a code) during the conduct of the study allows you to return to the medical 
record or data source to  delete duplicate subjects, check a missing or questionable entry, add new data points, 
etc. De -identified data is medical information that has been stripped of all  HIPAA identifier s so that it cannot be 
linked back to the subject. De- identified data is rarely  used in the conduct of a research study involving a chart 
review.   
 Review the list of subject identifiers below and, if applicable , check the box next to each HIPAA identifier 
being recorded at the time of data  collect ion or abstraction.  Identifiers apply to an y subject enrolled in the 
study including Mayo Clinic staff, patients and their relatives and household members.   Internal  refers to the subject ’s identifier  that will be recorded at Mayo Clinic  by [CONTACT_5984] . 
External  refers to  the subject ’s identif ier that will be shared outside of Mayo Clinic.

Data Analysis  
 The analysis of clinical  outcomes will be based on the principle of intention to treat. There will be three 
intervention groups in the study: 1) Native Mitral Valve and 2) V alve-in-Ring and 3) Valve- in-Valve. The three 
groups will be evaluated separately for the primary and secondary outcomes.  Sample Size  Using a sample size of [ADDRESS_123901] change in proportions of 0.30 (i.e., proportions of 0.[ADDRESS_123902]). Using the same sample size and alpha level, the paired t- test would have a 
power of 0.[ADDRESS_123903] size of 0.53 (i.e., a mean change which is 0.[ADDRESS_123904] deviation) for comparing pre and post change in continuous variables. A total of 30 patients in each group will be enrolled in this preliminary feasibility study.  Analysis and reporting of results:  The technical success, hemodynamics results and clinical outcomes will  be analyzed and reported. The primary 
objective is to evaluate the short -term (<30 days) and mid term (12 months) safety and feasibility of 
transcat heter mitral valve implantation to treat severe calcific mitral valve disease or failing surgical mitral rings 
or bioprostheses in patients who are not candidates for standard surgical mitral valve replacement. The primary safety and effectiveness endpoint s will be analyzed on an intention- to -treat basis. Therefore, all patients will be 
included in the analysis regardless of subsequent events.

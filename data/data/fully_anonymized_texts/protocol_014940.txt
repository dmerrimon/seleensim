[ADDRESS_1031724] The Coalition to Advance Real-World Evidence through Randomized Controlled Trial Emulation (CARE) Initiative is a program designed to build an empi[INVESTIGATOR_753726]-world data in clinical and regulatory decision-making. Using results from randomized clinical trials as a benchmark for causal effect estimates, a series of randomized controlled trial emulations will be conducted using real-world data (RWD) to better understand when observational methods and secondary data collected from routine healthcare practice can provide reliable conclusions on drug effectiveness. This protocol describes the first of several studies and seeks to emulate the KEYNOTE-189 randomized controlled trial.1 KEYNOTE-189 aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of pembrolizumab, platinum therapy, and pemetrexed vs. platinum therapy and pemetrexed in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and without epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR)/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene mutations.

protocol analyses was corrected.

Table 1.  Research question and objective  Objective:  In alignment with the KEYNOTE -189 trial, the objective is t o compare the overall survival of 
patients receiving pembrolizumab, platinum therapy, and pemetrexed vs. platinum therapy 
and pemetrexed for the treatment of  metastatic NSCLC  without EGFR/ALK mutations , and to 
calibrate results against the KEYNOTE -[ADDRESS_1031727]:  Average treatment effect  Hypothesis:  Within the population of patients with the tumor type of interest who receive pemetrexed and 
a platinum therapy, those additionally treated with pembrolizumab will have better survival 
than those not treated with pembrolizum ab. The results will be congruent with the KEYNOTE -
189 trial.  Population (mention key inclusion -exclusion 
criteria):  Patients with metastatic NSCLC  who have no t previously received systemic therapy for

Study design Overview of key design elements of the KEYNOTE-189 trial: The KEYNOTE-189 trial was a randomized controlled, double-blind trial comparing the efficacy of pembrolizumab vs. placebo when taken in combination with platinum therapy (investigator’s choice of cisplatin or carboplatin) and pemetrexed for the first-line treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer without EGFR or ALK mutations. Patients with active brain metastases, on chronic systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive agents, and a history of other primary malignancies were excluded. Follow-up was initiated at treatment randomization (baseline) and stopped at the earliest of death, unacceptable toxic effects, investigator decision, or patient withdrawal of consent. The primary outcome was overall survival, defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed to estimate the relative hazard of mortality and 12-month survival probability using a Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier estimator, respectively. More details on the design elements of the KEYNOTE-189 trial and how these compare to the present real-world evidence emulation study are available in the appendix along with study design diagrams for each of the studies’ designs. Overview of key design elements of the real-world evidence emulation study:  Primary (intention-to-treat) analysis: This is a retrospective cohort study comparing patients with incident use of pembrolizumab, pemetrexed, and platinum therapy vs. pemetrexed and platinum therapy following the first indication of metastatic disease in their electronic health record. The study design is illustrated in Figure 1-A. Patients will be required to have a diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer and have no evidence of EGFR or ALK mutations prior to treatment initiation. Patients with evidence of brain metastases in the 2 weeks prior to treatment initiation, records in the 90 days prior to treatment initiation indicating use of systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive agents, or a history of other primary malignancies will be excluded. Exposure will be ascertained within a 14-day window of time (i.e., “exposure regimen ascertainment window”), beginning on the day of first record indicating use of a study drug (pembrolizumab, pemetrexed, or platinum therapy), and ending 14-days later (“time zero"). Patients’ exposure will be classified based on the receipt of all study drugs in each regimen within the 14-day exposure regimen ascertainment window, which will be incident with respect to metastatic disease; study drug initiation may occur on or after date of metastatic disease. Patients will be required to be alive and at risk of the event throughout the exposure ascertainment window. Confounders will be assessed during the baseline period, defined as all time prior to and including time zero. Follow-up will begin on the day after the 14-day exposure regimen ascertainment window and proceed until the outcome event (death), loss to follow-up (>90-day gap in health record activity), 640 days of follow-up, or administrative end of available data occurs (i.e., last date of record in the dataset). Time-fixed inverse probability weights will be used to adjust for potential confounding. The effect of treatment initiation on the outcome of 
 
[ADDRESS_1031728] will be estimated using an intention-to-treat estimator. This primary analysis will be agnostic to treatment adherence and will not account for potential selection bias induced by [CONTACT_753750]-varying confounding. Rationale for this design is described in the next section. Secondary (per-protocol) analysis: A secondary analysis will be conducted that will employ the same eligibility criteria as the primary analysis, but with a modified exposure definition and analysis plan. Two static treatment regimens will be compared in the per-protocol population as follows: 1. Exposure: First-line, concurrent use of pembrolizumab, platinum therapy (cisplatin or carboplatin), and pemetrexed every 21 days for 4 cycles, followed by [CONTACT_753751] 21 days thereafter until intolerance/toxicity, progression, or mortality. 2. Comparator: First-line, concurrent use of platinum therapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) and pemetrexed every 21 days for 4 cycles, followed by [CONTACT_753752] 21 days thereafter until intolerance/toxicity, progression, or mortality. Upon failure of the original first-line regimen, may use pembrolizumab monotherapy every 21 days. The study design is illustrated in Figure 1-B. Given that some components of the exposure and comparator treatment regimens are overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (i.e., platinum therapy and pemetrexed), a “clone and censor” approach3 described by [CONTACT_753753]. In this approach, the analytic cohort will be cloned to create [ADDRESS_1031729] copi[INVESTIGATOR_753727], where each “clone” is assigned to one of two static treatment regimens (defined in variables section) and censored upon deviation from their assigned regimen. The justification for using this method is that if a patient experiences an event during follow-up but has a treatment pattern that complies with both exposure strategies of interest (e.g., taking platinum therapy and pemetrexed between days 1-10 of follow-up), the event will be attributed to both groups rather than one group differentially. In alignment with the KEYNOTE-[ADDRESS_1031730] adhered to static treatment regimens (i.e., treatment regimens dependent only on treatment history, but not upon other covariates) during follow-up that are detailed in the variables section of this protocol. Time-fixed confounders (assessed at baseline) and time-varying confounders (assessed at each interval of follow-up) will be controlled for using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Potential informative censoring induced by [CONTACT_753754]. The effect of the treatment on the outcome will be estimated using a per-protocol estimator, where follow-up will begin on the day after treatment initiation and proceed until an outcome event (death), treatment cessation (deviation from regimens described in the variables section of this protocol), loss to follow-up (>90-day gap in health record activity), 640 days of follow-up, or end of available data occurs (i.e., last date of record in the dataset). Rationale for this design is described in the next section.

analysis. All patients shown are distinct and are classified on the basis of their treatment initiation within a [ADDRESS_1031731] to  each patient’s first record of metastasis. Not ably, this analysis is agnostic to adherence and patients are 
followed up from the end of the exposure regimen ascertainment window until occurrence of an outcome or censor event. Additio nally, multiple records 
for each study drug may occur within the asce rtainment window, as observed in Patients D and H.  Panel B  Secondary (p er-protocol ) analysis. Patients 
1-4 are “cloned” and assigned to each treatment strategy  upon initiation of a study drug . Patient 1 adheres perfectly to the exposure treatment strategy 
and experiences the outcome event; therefore, all person -time observations are contributed to the exposed group. Patient 1 also contributes a small 
amount of person -time to the comparator group, as the patient’s treatment history is aligned with the compar ator treatment strategy for some follow -
up time prior to initiation of D 3. Patient 2 in the “exposed” group is censored upon initiation of a cancer treatment that is not a part of her assigned 
regimen (D x) and does not contribute person -time to the compara tor group since D 3 is not a component of the comparator regimen. Patient 3 in the 
”exposed” group is censored at the end of the 21 -day interval because that is the point at which the patient’s treatment history is no longer compliant 
with the exposure stra tegy. Patient 4 in the “comparator” group has a treatment history that is compatible with the comparator strategy and 
experiences an outcome event but is censored in the “exposed” group due to a lack of “compliance” with the exposed treatment strategy. Notably, if an 
event occurs during an interval of follow -up time that is compatible with both treatment strategies, the outcome is attributed to both groups.   

 
9  Rationale for study design choices:  Study design decisions reflect the bias-variance trade-off that is inherent to nearly all epi[INVESTIGATOR_753728], as well as the goal to emulate the KEYNOTE-189 trial results. The primary analysis was constructed to maximize the number of eligible patients for analysis and resultant statistical power, while the secondary analysis was designed to mitigate bias as much as possible at the expense of a greater variance. Both analyses use weighting to obtain marginal treatment effects and censor patients administratively at 21 months (640 days) of follow-up, which may align more with the randomized controlled trial result than conditional treatment effects. The 14-day exposure regimen ascertainment window in the primary analysis was chosen to allow for some variability in treatment patterns that are likely to occur in routine care. Ascertaining exposure in shorter intervals (e.g., on a single day) may be too restrictive and result in few eligible patients, while longer time periods may result in treatment patterns in the study population that are vastly different from the trial. In the per-protocol analysis, a 21-day treatment administration was chosen to align with the dosing schedule prescribed in the KEYNOTE-[ADDRESS_1031732] otherwise been discarded during matching procedures or lack of treatment adherence. Furthermore, treatment adherence may be relatively high among patients with lung cancer due to the nature of the disease. Adjustment for informative censoring can introduce additional variability (and reduce precision of) effect estimators, due to the presence of extreme weights. Although the analytic approach in the primary analysis more closely resembles that of the KEYNOTE-[ADDRESS_1031733] (as will be done in the secondary analysis) may give rise to results that more closely align with randomized controlled trials, where relatively high levels of adherence are often observed. At 21 months of follow-up, 33.8% and 17.8% of patients were on the assigned therapy in the pembrolizumab-containing and placebo-containing group of the KEYNOTE-189 trial, respectively.1 Lastly, time-varying confounding is likely to be present in the real-world oncology population, where clinical condition and performance status can change dramatically over follow-up. 5.2.  Setting Context and rationale for definition of time 0 (and other primary time anchors) for entry to the study population  The criteria defining time zero for the primary (intention-to-treat) and secondary (per-protocol) populations are specified below in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 1 in the appendix. In the primary population, time zero will be defined by [CONTACT_2671] 14-day exposure regimen ascertainment window (incident with respect to the first record of metastasis) described in the Study Design section. In the secondary population, time zero will be defined by [CONTACT_753755] a study drug of interest (also incident with respect to an indication of metastasis in the data source). Time zero will be restricted to dates on or after October 7, [ADDRESS_1031734]-line advanced disease setting.4–6 Permitting “historical” controls will allow for a greater study sample size and precision of estimates, under the assumption that decisions driving treatment initiation are constant over time. A “washout” window, in which a patient has no records indicating study drug use between 
 
[ADDRESS_1031735], will be applied to the primary and secondary populations to ensure that the exposure regimen identified is each patient’s first-line treatment for metastatic disease. Table 2.

To distinguish the indication for these study drugs, treatments occurring after the first observed metastatic disease indicator will be deemed as treatments for metastatic disease. a See appendix for listing of clinical codes for each study parameter b Indicators of metastatic disease include records indicating stage 4 disease, indicators of metastasis derived from the data vendor, or International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) diagnostic codes indicating metastasis. Information on metastatic disease is drawn from a linked tumor registry and tumor morphology descriptors contained within the health record. 
 
11  Context and rationale for study inclusion criteria:  Operational definitions for study inclusion criteria are shown in Table 3, and were selected to proxy those of the KEYNOTE-189 trial as closely as possible.1 Numerous variables in the data source were used to define each criterion in order to harness all available information. For example, treatments were selected using National Drug Code (NDC), Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS)/Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), and RxNorm codes. “Observability” requirements (e.g., continuous activity in health record database) will not be imposed during the baseline period to maximize study sample size and statistical precision of outcome estimates. Platinum therapy is used in both the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting, as well as the metastatic setting. Therefore, in defining “No prior systemic treatment for metastatic disease,” the date range for assessment (between stage IV diagnosis and the index treatment) was chosen to differentiate between therapi[INVESTIGATOR_753729]. We assume that patients are being seen within-network and all relevant healthcare encounters are captured during the baseline period. Table 3.

15  5.3.  Variables Context and rationale for exposure(s) of interest Primary analysis (intention-to-treat) exposure definition: The two treatment strategies that will be compared in the intention-to-treat population will be as follows: 1. Exposure: Initiation of first line pembrolizumab, platinum therapy, and pemetrexed within a 14-day exposure assessment window 2. Comparator: Initiation of first line platinum therapy and pemetrexed within a 14-day exposure assessment window  A patient will be classified as having “initiated” each multi-drug regimen if they had an incident order, dispensation, and/or administration for all component study drugs of that regimen within a 14-day exposure assessment window. For both treatment groups, the exposure regimen ascertainment window will be incident with respect to the first record of metastatic disease to distinguish between therapi[INVESTIGATOR_753731]-line therapy for metastatic disease. All available information in the data source will be used to ascertain exposure status, including procedure codes (i.e., HCPCS/CPT “J” codes), as well as NDC and RxNorm codes available from the medication-related data tables. This exposure definition is illustrated in Figure 1-A in the Study Design section. Secondary analysis (per-protocol) exposure definition: The two static treatment regimens that will be compared in the per-protocol population are as follows: 1. Exposure: First-line, concurrent use of pembrolizumab, platinum therapy (cisplatin or carboplatin), and pemetrexed every 21 days for 4 cycles, followed by [CONTACT_753751] 21 days thereafter until intolerance/toxicity, progression, or mortality. 2. Comparator: First-line, concurrent use of platinum therapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) and pemetrexed every 21 days for 4 cycles, followed by [CONTACT_753752] 21 days thereafter until intolerance/toxicity, progression, or mortality. Upon failure of the original first-line regimen, may use pembrolizumab monotherapy every 21 days.  These real-world data treatment regimen definitions were chosen as a compromise between 1) the heterogeneity of adherence patterns observed in routine clinical practice, and 2) the goal of emulating the KEYNOTE-[ADDRESS_1031736] without compromising the general adherence pattern imposed in the KEYNOTE-189 trial. Discontinuation of treatments or treatment switch will be assumed to be due to intolerance/toxicity or progression events. A patient will be classified as having “initiated” each multi-drug regimen if they had an incident order, dispensation, and/or administration for any component study drugs of that regimen. As with the intention-to-treat exposure definition, the “incident” order, dispensation, and/or administration will be with respect to the first record of metastatic disease. Also similar to the primary analysis, all available information in the data source will be used to 
 
16  determine exposure status, including procedure codes (i.e., HCPCS/CPT “J” codes), as well as NDC and RxNorm codes available from the medication-related data tables. Patients with evidence of non-study drugs between the initial metastatic disease indicator and incident study drug use will be excluded from the analysis by [CONTACT_753756]-line treatment. Refer to Figure 1-B in the Study Design section for several illustrations of the static treatment regimens.  Table 5.

a Assessment times shown are inclusive. b See appendix for listing of clinical codes for each study parameter. c Indicators of metastatic disease include records indicating stage [ADDRESS_1031737].  Context and rationale for outcome(s) of interest The outcome of interest is overall survival, which will be estimated as the probability of survival beyond [ADDRESS_1031738] of mortality comparing the exposure vs. comparator groups. Month and year of mortality are available for patients in the data source; however, exact dates of death are not available to preserve patient privacy. Date of death will be assumed to have occurred on the first day of the month of death given in the data source. Table 6.

18  Context and rationale for follow-up  Primary analysis (intention-to-treat): The effect of treatment initiation on the outcome of interest will be estimated (i.e., “intention-to-treat effect”), where follow-up will begin on the day after a 14-day exposure regimen ascertainment window and proceed until the outcome event (death), loss to follow-up (>90-day gap in health record activity), 640 days after the index date, or end of available data occurs. “Health record activity” will be defined by [CONTACT_753759], treatments, and vitals records. See Figure 1-A for an illustration of follow-up in the primary intention-to-treat analysis. Administrative censoring at 21 months (640 days) will be imposed to align with the duration of the KEYNOTE-189 trial at the time initial results were published.   Secondary analysis (per-protocol): The effect of the treatment on the outcome will be estimated (i.e., “per-protocol effect”), where follow-up will begin on the day after initiation of a study drug in each regimen of interest and proceed until an outcome event (death), treatment cessation (deviation from regimens described in the variables section of this protocol), loss to follow-up (>90-day gap in health record activity), 640 days after the index date, or end of available data occurs. “Health record activity” will also be defined by [CONTACT_753759], treatments, and vitals records (similar to the primary analysis). In aligning with the KEYNOTE-189 trial, cross-over from the non-pembrolizumab group to pembrolizumab monotherapy will be permitted. Administrative censoring at 21 months (640 days) will be imposed to align with the duration of the KEYNOTE-189 trial at the time initial results were published. See Figure 1-B for illustrations of follow-up in the secondary per-protocol analysis.

a Time-varying covariates that will be considered for inclusion in statistical models for weight estimation in the secondary (“per-protocol”) analysis. Variables will be assessed in the “assessment window” stated in the table and updated at every discrete time interval of follow-up. b See appendix for listing of clinical codes for each study parameter  5.4.  Data analysis Context and rationale for analysis plan Table 9.  Primary, secondary, and subgroup analysis specification A. Primary analysis (intention-to-treat) Hypothesis:  The relative hazard  of mortality is not equal  among patients who initiated  pembrolizumab and chemotherapy vs. 
chemotherapy alone.  Exposure contrast:  Patients initiating pembrolizumab, pemetrexed, and platinum therapy (cisplatin or carboplatin)  vs. patients 
initiating pemetrexed and platinum therapy (cisplatin or carboplatin)  within a [ADDRESS_1031742] occurrence of metastatic disease  Outcome:  Marginal hazard ratio for mortality, standardized to the empi[INVESTIGATOR_753732].  Analytic software:  R Statistical Software (v4.1.2; R Core Team 2021)  
Packages: tidyverse  (v2.0.0) , mice  (v3.15.0), survival (v3.1 -8) Model(s):   ℎ(𝑡,𝐿0)=ℎ0(𝑡)∗𝑒𝛽1𝐴0+𝛽2𝑇𝐿0 
 
27  where ℎ(𝑡,𝐿0) is the hazard of mortality at discrete time interval ‘t,’ conditional on the vector of potential 
confounders, “ 𝐿0,” assessed at baseline; ℎ0(𝑡) is the baseline hazard at discrete time interval ‘t’; and 𝐴0 is an 
indicator for treatment initiation, coded a s “1” and “0” for the exposure and comparator group, respectively.   
The proportional hazards assumption will be checked through visual inspection of  plots containing  scaled 
Schoenfeld residuals vs. time for each covariate.  The Breslow method of handling ti es will be used.  Confounding adjustment method     Stabilized, time -fixed , inverse probability of treatment weights will be used to adjust for confounding. Individual -
level weights will be estimated by [CONTACT_51632] : 
𝑆𝑊𝐴=𝑓(𝐴0)
𝑓(𝐴0|𝐿0) 
where 𝐴0 is the treatment that the patient received  and 𝐿0 is a vector of bas eline confounders.  
 
The quantit y in the denominator will be estimated using a logistic regression model with 𝐴0 as the dependent 
variable and the 𝐿0 vector as the independent variables  and the quantity in the numerator will be estimated with 
a logistic regression model containing 𝐴0 as the dependent and sole variable in the model.  The model will be fit to 
a person level dataset (i.e., one row per patient, with each row representing a p atient’s complete experience 
during baseline and follow -up). 
 
All potential confounder variables will be considered for inclusion in the weight estimation  (Table 8) . However, a s it 
is not possible to predict the quantity of missing values and sparseness of the data at the time of writing this 
protocol, the precise functional form of the final regression model will be determined at the time of analysis. The 
most flexible functional form will be chosen to reduce the possibility of bias due to mod elling assumptions.  
 
To verify that weights were estimated correctly, the  mean weight will be checked  to be approximately equal to 1. 
The empi[INVESTIGATOR_753733], suggesting 
positivit y violations.  In the presence of suspected random positivity violations (e.g., due to sparse data), modelling 
assumptions will be altered to smooth over “zero ” or “near -zero” quantities  within levels of the exposure and 
covariat es. If this approach is unsuccessful, weight trimming may be considered whereby [CONTACT_753760] 1st percentile will be removed from the analysis.  Structural positivity violations should not be 
possible, given our eligibility criteri a and treatment strategies.  Missing data methods    
 
28        The data source is comprised of data drawn from over 50 healthcare networks, some of which may contribute certain variables to varying degrees. This is one plausible reason for missing values, and while identifying information on contributing healthcare networks is not available in the database, it can be proxied by [CONTACT_753761] (and all other measured variables in analysis). This theory is supported by [CONTACT_753762] (bmi, marital status, etc.) on region. Therefore, the data are believed to be Missing at Random (MAR).  To address missing values that are MAR, multiple imputation with chained equations (fully conditional specification) can be employed. This approach is appropriate to address data that are MAR and permits the flexibility needed to impute different variable types (continuous, categorical, etc.). A series of conditional models will be specified to estimate the parameters of a joint distribution from which the imputed values will be drawn. Predictive mean matching, ordered logistic regression, and multinomial logistic models will be considered to impute continuous, ordinal, and nominal variables that contain missing values, respectively. The final imputation models and variables to be imputed will be determined by [CONTACT_753763]. Inference regarding the final effect estimates will account for the imputation procedure.  Please refer to the appendix for more information on missing data. Subgroup Analyses    Subgroup analyses will be conducted similarly to the KEYNOTE -189 trial1 to facilitate comparison : 
1. Age (<65, ≥65)  
2. Sex (male, female)  
3. ECOG performance Status (0, 1, 2+)  
4. Smoking status (current or former, never)  
5. Brain metastases at baseline ( yes, no)  
6. PD-L1 tumor proportion score  (<1%, ≥1%, 1 -49%, ≥50%)  
7. Platinum -based drug (carboplatin, cisplatin)   Hypothesis:  The 12-month survival probability  is not equal among patients who initiated pembrolizumab and chemotherapy 
vs. chemotherapy alone.

time ‘t’ will be as follows:  
𝑆𝑎(𝑡)=∏1−𝑑𝑡𝑎

to-treat mortality hazard ratio).  Subgroup Analyses  List all subgroups   Provided PD -L1 tumor  proportion score is available in the data source, overall survival will be estimated within 
subgroups of  patients with a PD -L1 tumor proportion score of <1%, 1 -49%, and ≥50% to facilitate comparison with 
the KEYNOTE -189 trial.1  B. Secondary analysis (per-protocol) Hypothesis:  The relative hazard of mortality is not equal among patients who adhered to the static treatment regimen of

Concurrent use of pemetrexed and platinum therapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) every 21 days for 4 cycles , followed

confounders of the entire study population.  Analytic software:  R Statistical Software (v4.1.2; R Core Team 2021) Packages: tidyverse (v2.0.0), mice (v3.15.0), survey (v4.1-1) Model(s):  
  A weighted , pooled -over -time  marginal structural  logistic regression model  will be used to estimate the per -
protocol mortality hazard ratio  as follows:  
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡[Pr(𝐷𝑡=1|𝐴,𝐿0,𝐷̅𝑡−1=0,𝐶𝑡−1=0)]=𝛼0,𝑡+𝛽1𝐴+𝛽2𝑇𝐿0 
where 𝐷𝑡 denotes a death event at time ‘t’ , ‘A’ is a time -updated binary indicator of adherence to the static 
treatment regime specified  in the study design  and variables  section of this protocol  (taking on value of 0 for the 
comparator group and 1 for exposed group at discrete time points ‘t’), 𝐿0 denotes a time -fixed vector of 
confounders assessed at baseline , 𝐶𝑡−1 is an indicator of censoring at time ‘t -1’ (e.g., due to non -adherence to 
regime of interest , loss to follow -up, or administrative end of data ), and 𝛼0,𝑡 is a time -varying intercept (estimated 
as a polynomial  function of ‘t’) .  
Provided the probability of morality is less than 15% in each discrete time interval, the treatment coefficient of the 
pooled logistic model will approximate a relative hazard . 
As it is not possible to predict the quantity of missing values and sparseness of the data at the time of writing this 
protocol, the precise functional form of the final regression model will be determined at the time of analysis. The 
most flexible functional form will be chosen to reduce the possibility of residual bias arising from  modelling 
assumptions.  Confounding adjustment 
method     To account for potential confounding bias, stabilized  time -varying  inverse probability of treatment weights will be 
applied to the study sample to generate  a pseudo -population , in which the treatment at time ‘t’ is independent of 
confounder histor y. The weights will take on the following form:  
 
 
31  𝑆𝑊𝐴=∏𝑓(𝐴𝑡|𝐴̅𝑡−1)
𝑓(𝐴𝑡|𝐴̅𝑡−1,𝐿0,𝐿̅𝑣)𝑇
𝑡=0 
 
where 𝐴𝑡 denotes  time -varying  treatment status  that the patient actually received  at discrete time ‘t’ (taking on 
values 0 for adherence to the comparator regimen and 1 for adherence to the exposed regimen), 𝐿0 denotes a 
vector of time -fixed baseline confounders , and 𝐿𝑣 denotes a vector of time -varying con founders . The overbar is 
used to represent treatment history.   
 
The conditional probability mass functions that comprise the numerator and denominator of 𝑆𝑊𝐴 will be 
estimated using a pooled logistic regression model  that includes treatment status at time ‘t’, treatm ent history, 
covariate history (baseline and time -varying ), and a time -varying intercept  (using functional of time using 
splines) . The model will be fit to a person -time  level dataset  (i.e., multiple  rows per patient, each row representing 
a patient’s experience during a discrete time interval) . Each person -time contribution to the weight will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_753765] p redicted probabilities from the model over each person -time 
interval from t=0 through event or censor ing, “T,” where T = min(event, censoring) . 
 
As illustrated in the study design  and variables  section of this protocol , patients  will be censored when they do not 
adhere to the treatment regimens  of interest. To account for potential informative censoring induced by [CONTACT_753766], inverse probabi lity of censoring  𝑆𝑊𝐶 weights will be estimated and applied jointly with 
𝑆𝑊𝐴 to the study sample.  The censoring weights will take on the following form:  
 
𝑆𝑊𝐶=∏𝑓(𝐶𝑡=0|𝐴̅𝑡−1,𝐶𝑡−1=0)
𝑓(𝐶𝑡=0|𝐴̅𝑡−1,𝐶𝑡−1=0,𝐿̅𝑣)𝑇
𝑡=[ADDRESS_1031747] the same treatment and 
covariate history as those who were censored, more heavily to “compensate” for those that were censored.  
Therefore, the mean weight over follow -up time should be 1. This will be verified graphically to check for model 
misspecification . 
 
Using a similar approach to treatment weight estimation, the conditional probability mass functions that 
comprise the numerator and denominator of 𝑆𝑊𝐶 will be estimated using a p ooled logistic regression model that 
includes censoring  status at time ‘t’, treatment history, covariate history (time -varying), and a time -varying 
 
32  intercept (using functional of time using splines) for the denominator, and the same variables (except for covariate history) for the numerator.  The final study sample will be weighted by [CONTACT_753767]-time interval as follows:  𝑆𝑊𝐴,𝐶=𝑆𝑊𝐴∙𝑆𝑊𝐶  Missing data methods          The data source is comprised of data drawn from over 50 healthcare networks, some of which may contribute 
certain variables to varying degrees. This is one plausible reason for m issing  values , and while identifying 
information on contributing healthcare ne tworks is not available in the database, it can be proxied by [CONTACT_753768] (and all other measured variables in analysis). This theory is supported by [CONTACT_753769] (bmi, marital status, etc.) on region . Therefore, the data are believed to be 
Missing at Random (MAR).  
 
To address missing values that are MAR, m ultiple imputation with chained equations  (fully conditional 
specification) can be employed. This approach is appropriate to address data that are MAR and permits the

will be specified to estimate the parameters of a joint distribution from which the imputed values will be drawn.

Data sources Summary of data source: The data source used for this study is derived from electronic health records of [ADDRESS_1031753] (demographics, date-indexed encounters, diagnoses, procedures, and medications) and natural language processing of free-text provider notes. The data are enriched using tumor/cancer registries for oncology information and obituaries and Social Security records for mortality data. The healthcare organizations from which the data are drawn are varied and include acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], networks of outpatient clinics, academic medical centers, pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], and cardiac care and surgical centers. Although the data are sourced from many institutions, those institutions are not identifiable in the data for privacy purposes. Context and rationale for data sources Reason for selection: The process for selecting a data source is described in a previously published manuscript.[ADDRESS_1031754] a final fit-for-purpose dataset, including data quality, quantity (sample size), and provenance. Because data is sourced from entire health care organizations, which house several in-network hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], clinics, and other institutions, patients’ experiences are captured more completely. Strengths of data source(s): Major strengths of the data source used in this study include its linkage with a tumor/cancer registry, availability of all (including non-oncology) diagnosis codes contained in the health records, and presence of medication history through a variety of sources (medication reconciliation, drug ordering system, administrations, dispensations, etc.). Information is captured from natural language processing of unstructured clinical notes, as well as structured data fields within the health record. Importantly, results of tumor biomarkers and genomic testing are available, facilitating appropriate selection of our cohort of interest (i.e., patients without EGFR or ALK mutations in tumor cells). Collectively, these qualities enable ascertainment of patients’ longitudinal clinical histories at a relatively high level of detail as well as identification of confounders that are not oncology-related (e.g., comorbidities). Limitations of data source(s): Limitations include the inability to distinguish between medication record types (i.e., orders, administrations, and dispensations), unavailable information on out-of-network encounters (i.e., EHR discontinuity13), and limited drug dosing information. Natural language processing may also result in an unknown degree of measurement error, as the models used to derive variables have not been validated. Many of these

42  5.6.  Data management Data management and processing will be done using RStudio Pro (v4.1.0) via Posit Workbench and will proceed through the following phases: 1. Data explorations: During this phase, the investigator will become acquainted with the data source and identify the specific variables that can be used to ascertain eligibility criteria, exposure, outcome, and confounders. These variables and the data tables that they may be found in will be listed in a spreadsheet. No analyses will be conducted outside of simple univariate summary distributions of the variables in the raw data. The purpose of this phase will be to explore missingness patterns and determine the utility of specific variables in key variable (e.g., exposure, outcome, confounder, selection criteria) ascertainment.   2. Cohort selection: Cohort selection will be carried out in a manner specified by [CONTACT_753772]. Cohort(s) generated in this phase will be used to conduct feasibility analyses that will further inform protocol development or, if no further protocol changes are needed, creation of the analytic file. 3. Analytic file: Person-level and person-time level analytic files will be created for the primary and secondary analyses, respectively. Each variable will be created based on operational definitions provided in this protocol for the exposure, outcome, and confounders of interest.  5.7.  Quality control Upon receiving the data, programmers will visually inspect all data tables to ensure correct formatting and labelling of variables. Summary distributions will be inspected during the “Data explorations” phase of the data management process described in the data management section of this protocol. Software code written for the purposes of data management and statistical analysis will be reviewed using a formal code review process established at Aetion, which has been adapted from industry standards, best practices, and the experience of internal team members. A central GitHub repository will be used to share and review code. One to two reviewers will be responsible for reviewing each line of code and ensuring correct application of functions and methods (e.g., through spot-checking randomly selected samples of observations before and after application of code).  5.8.

46  6.  Limitation of the methods This study has several methodologic limitations, as well as limitations that pertain to the study’s comparability to the KEYNOTE-189 trial.  As with all epi[INVESTIGATOR_29820], the possibility of residual or unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out. Residual confounding may result from misspecification of statistical models (e.g., when estimating inverse probability treatment and censoring weights). To mitigate the risk of this bias, a flexible functional form of covariates in each model will be used where possible (e.g., including polynomial and interaction terms) to make fewer assumptions about the relation between the independent and dependent variables. An advantage of the data source is that patients’ medical histories are available through standardized diagnosis and procedure codes, as well as medication use. Collectively, these histories can be leveraged to ascertain many known prognosticators of mortality to further reduce the risk of unmeasured confounding accordingly. In the oncology population, the possibility of time-varying confounding is an important consideration, as patients’ health can rapi[INVESTIGATOR_753748]-up. Furthermore, cancer treatment regimens tend to vary over time, involving several drugs. To account for treatments and prognosticators that vary over follow-up, a secondary analysis will be conducted using a marginal structural model to estimate a per-protocol effect. This approach addresses time-varying confounding by [CONTACT_57148] a pseudo-population, in which treatment at each discrete time interval during follow-up is independent of confounder history (under the assumption that all confounders were measured (i.e., “conditional exchangeability”), consistency, positivity, and no model misspecification).7 In addition to confounding, selection bias may occur due to the presence of missing data or informative censoring. Missing data may induce selection bias if the mechanism giving rise to missing values cannot be adequately described or proxied by [CONTACT_753776] (i.e., data are “missing not at random”). Provided that the observed variables do fully relate to missingness (i.e., data are either “missing completely at random” or “missing at random”), several methods are available to correct for potential bias. Once missing data are fully described, including the extent of missingness for key variables in each treatment group, the mechanism underlying missingness will be hypothesized and addressed accordingly. Informative censoring arises when patients who remain within each risk set at a given discrete time during follow-up have a differential risk of the outcome than patients who were censored. Our secondary (per-protocol) analysis plan accounts for this by [CONTACT_753777], under the assumption that all common causes of censoring and the outcome at each discrete time during follow-up are measured and not misspecified in the weight models. Information bias is a possibility in our analysis. Inaccurate or miscoding of standardized codes in the data could lead to measurement error. Furthermore, in the data source, medication orders, dispensations, and administrations are not always distinguishable. In the present analysis, all such medication records are treated equal, and may not represent the patient’s true experience. For this reason, a sensitivity analysis in which medication administrations using HCPCS/CPT codes will be used to define treatment exposures for patients. Notably, the mortality outcome has not been validated and is subject to measurement error, particularly as only month and year or mortality are provided in the data source (we assume date of death is first of the month reported). The pattern of mortality is unlikely to vary across treatment group (i.e., non-differential), which would pose no risk of bias to relative effect measures, such as hazard ratios. However, systematic under-recording  may affect absolute effect measures, such as the 12-month survival probabilities.  
 
[ADDRESS_1031759] that accounts for treatment adherence will be conducted in this study. An additional limitation of the primary (intention-to-treat) analysis is the misalignment of treatment initiation with respect to calendar time. We address this with a sensitivity analysis restricting the cohort entry dates (time zero) to be contemporaneous with respect to exposure group. Lastly, this study is being performed to assess the ability of real-world data in this specific treatment setting to reach similar conclusions to randomized clinical trials using the KEYNOTE-189 trial as a benchmark for causal inference. This study may fail to align with the trial’s results for many reasons that are not rooted in bias, including but not limited to differences in study samples (particularly with respect to effect modifiers), random sampling variability, differences in adherence and follow-up, and differences in the measurement of study eligibility criteria, exposures, and outcomes. Therefore, it will be critical to evaluate the results of this study in light of all reasons that could explain any observed differences (or similarities).   7.  References 1.

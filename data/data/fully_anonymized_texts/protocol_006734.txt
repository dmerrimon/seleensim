1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
This is a safety  study  to evaluate  toxicity  and other  clinical  outcomes  of whole  lung intensity - 
modulated  radiation  therapy  (IMRT)  following  standard  treatment  in patients  with synovial  sarcoma  
and lung metastases.  Patients  who received  standard  therapy  for synovial  sarcoma  will be assessed  
for residual  disease  in the lungs  by [CONTACT_447]-therapy  imaging.  Patients  with pulmonary  metastases  <2 
cm will then be eligible  to receive  Whole  Lung  Irradiation  (WLI).   The treatment  plan will involve  [ADDRESS_644755],  physical  exams,  and toxicity  
assessments  at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months  (+/-3 weeks  for 3 and 6 months  and +/-6 weeks  for 12, 
18, and 24 months),  an echocardiogram  at 6, 12, and 24 months,  and pulmonary  function  tests  at 6 
and 24 months.  
 
Fifteen  patients  will be enrolled  in 6 years.  The duration  of the study  will be 6 years.  
 
 
 
2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
Primary  objective  
 
• To assess  the overall  toxicity  rate at 1 year after whole  lung IMRT  in this patient  population  
Secondary  objectives  
• To determine  rates  of pulmonary  failure -free survival  after completion  of whole  lung IMRT.  
• To determine  rates  of overall  survival  (OS)  after completion  of whole  lung IMRT.   
• Assessment  of toxicity  and response  to treatment.   
 
• Patients  complete  standard  therapy  as determined by [CONTACT_500751]  (e.g.  surgery  +/- radiation  to the primary  site)  +/- any 
adjuvant  chemotherapy.   Patients  are eligible  for this protocol  if they  
have  lung  metastases present  at diagnosis  or develop  lung  metastases  
over  the course  of standard  therapy.  
 
• After  the completion  of all planned  therapy, patients  will be assessed  
with  imaging  of their  lungs.  If there  is no residual  pulmonary  disease  or 
lung  metastases  are <2cm,  patients are eligibile  to participate  on 
protocol.  
 
• Whole  lung  irradiation  using  IMRT  on protocol.

3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
3.1 The usage  of whole  lung irradiation  in the management  of pulmonary  metastases  
 
Whole  lung irradiation  (WLI)  is standard  of care in the treatment  of patients  with pulmonary  
metastases  from rhabdomyosarcoma  (RMS),  Ewing  Sarcoma,  and Wilms  Tumor1-3. The 
dose  of WLI in modern  Children’s  Oncology  Group  (COG)  protocols  is 15Gy  for RMS and 
Ewing  Sarcoma  and 12 Gy for Wilms  tumor.  WLI reduces  the rates  of lung recurrences  in 
patients  with RMS1 .  In the European  Intergroup  Cooperative  Ewing’s  Sarcoma  Study  
(EICESS),  WLI was associated  with a trend  to improved  overall  survival  (OS),4  reduced  
pulmonary  relapses  and improved  event -free survival  (EFS)5. Similarly,  patients  with Wilms  
tumor  with lung metastases  at diagnosis  demonstrate  reduced  pulmonary  relapse  when  
treated  with WLI as demonstrated  in both the [LOCATION_006] Children’s  Cancer  Study  Group  ([LOCATION_006]CCSG)  
6  and the National  Wilms  Tumor  Study  Group  (NWTSG)3. The [LOCATION_006]CCSG  also demonstrated  
an association  between  EFS with the use of WLI. Taken  together,  these  studies  demonstrate  
that WLI is an accepted  and efficacious  treatment  in the management  of pulmonary  
metastases  from RMS,  Ewing  Sarcoma,  and Wilms  Tumor.  
 
3.2 Rationale  for using  whole  lung irradiation  in synovial  sarcoma  
 
Synovial  sarcoma  comprises  approximately  8% of all soft tissue  sarcomas  (STS)  and is the 
third most  common  extremity  STS7. Synovial  sarcoma  is frequently  a disease  of young  adults  
with a mean  age of 30-40 years8. About  6-18% of patients  have distant  metastases  at 
presentation  and the lungs  are the most  common  site of metastases.  In one series  of  
patients  <21 years  of age with synovial  sarcoma,  rates  of metastases  at diagnosis  are about  
6% with the vast majority  of metastases  (86%)  located  in the lungs9. An adult  series  reported  
18% of patients  with metastatic  disease  at time of presentation  with 78% of metastases  
located  in the lungs10. In a Surveillance,  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_500740]  (SEER)  database  
study  of 1,268  adult  and pediatric  patients  with synovial  sarcoma,  the rate of distant  disease  
at presentations  was 13%11. 
In contrast  to RMS, Ewing  Sarcoma,  and Wilms  tumor,  the use of WLI in patients  with 
synovial  sarcoma  and lung metastases  is not standard  of care.  In the recently  closed  COG  
phase  III ARST0332  trial for non-rhabdomyosarcoma  soft tissue  sarcoma,  which  included  
synovial  sarcomas,  the use of WLI or focal radiation  to the lungs  was not allowed.   However,  
like RMS and Ewing  sarcoma,  synovial  sarcoma  is a radiosensitive  histology8. In the non- 
metastatic  setting,  the use of radiotherapy  has been  shown  in large  series  to be associated  
with local control12  and EFS in patients  with localized  disease10. 
 
Data indicate  that local control  of pulmonary  metastases  is associated  with improved  
survival.  In a study from this institution  that included  41 pediatric  patients  <22 years  old with 
synovial  sarcoma,  patients  who underwent  pulmonary  metastasectomy  had a 2-year OS of 
65% compared  to 0% among  patients  who did not undergo  pulmonary  metastasectomy13. In 
this series,  10 of 41 patients  could  not undergo  pulmonary  metastasectomy  due to diffuse  
non-resectable  disease.  A larger  series  examining  pulmonary  metastasectomy  in all patients  
at this institution  with soft tissue  sarcoma  (STS)  and pulmonary  metastases  showed  a 3-year 
overall  survival  rate of 46% in those  patients  who underwent  complete  resection  of 
pulmonary  metastases  compared  to 17% in patients  with no resection.  Of note,  of the 20

patients  in this series  with long term survival,  13 relapsed  in the lungs  requiring  repeat  
resections  leading  the authors  to conclude  that “pulmonary  metastases  frequently  represent  
diffuse  involvement  of the lung parenchyma.  As such,  it is difficult  to eradicate  all foci of 
metastatic  disease  with resection14.”  A series  from Japan  that included  pediatric  and adult  
patients  with STS demonstrated  a 2-year actuarial  survival  rate of 49.7%  from time of first 
pulmonary  resection  with the use of aggressive  pulmonary  metastasectomy15. 
In addition  to metastasectomy,  local therapy  to the lung in the form of radiation  has been  
shown  to provide  excellent  local control  and improved  OS. A series  from the University  of 
[COMPANY_002]ster  using  stereotactic  body radiotherapy  (SBRT)  for pulmonary  metastases  from STS 
showed  an 82% rate of local control  at three  years  and an improvement  in OS from .6 years  
to 2.1 years  with the use of SBRT16. Synovial  sarcoma  comprised  15% of the patient  
population  in this study.  A German  study  investigated  the use of WLI to 12Gy  with a boost  of 
50-[ADDRESS_644756]  to late toxicity,  the rates  of radiation -induced  
cardiac  disease  are between  10-30% with the onset  of symptoms  ranging  from 5-[ADDRESS_644757]  to rates  of congestive  heart  failure  (CHF),  
myocardial  infarction,  pericardial  disease,  and valvular  disease  with a significant  
increase  in these  late complications  when  cardiac  radiation  exposure  exceeded  
15Gy20 . Another  study  of childhood  cancer  survivors  showed  that the risk of dying  as 
a result  of cardiac  disease  was significantly  higher  in patients  who had received  an 
average  radiation  dose  greater  than 5Gy to the heart  (RR 12.5)  and was further  
increased  at doses  exceeding  15 Gy (RR 25.1).  There  was a linear  relationship  
between  radiation  dose  and risk of cardiac  mortality21. 
 
The NWTSG  reported  the rates  of congestive  heart  failure  in a cohort  of patients  
treated  on NWTS  1-4. The RR of CHF was increased  in females,  by [CONTACT_500752],  lung irradiation,  and abdominal  irradiation.  The risk of CHF 
increased  by a factor  of 1.[ADDRESS_644758]  anteroposterior -posteroanterior  (S-RT) technique  and

whole  heart,  right atrium,  left atrium,  right ventricle,  left ventricle,  liver and thyroid  
gland.  The volume  of the heart  receiving  6Gy, 8Gy, 10Gy  and 11.4Gy  was 
significantly  lower  in the CS-IMRT  plans  as compared  to the S-RT plans.  This was 
also true for the left ventricle,  right ventricle  and myocardium.  The volume  of left 
atrium  and right atrium  receiving  10Gy  or above  was significantly  less in the IMRT  
plans.  Similarly,  the volume  of coronary  vessels  receiving  ≥11.4Gy  was lower  in the 
IMRT  plans.  
 
There  is a recently  completed  multi-institutional  protocol  (IRB#  11-100),  including  this 
institution,  investigating  the feasibility  of cardiac -sparing  whole  lung IMRT  in children  
and young  adults  (<30 years  old) with a diagnosis  of Wilms  tumor,  Ewing  Sarcoma  or 
RMS  and lung metastases.  
3.3.[ADDRESS_644759]-irradiation  resolved  by 2 years  and no patients  reported  any significant  
pulmonary  symptoms  or decrease  in exercise  tolerance26. A second  study  of patients  
with Ewing  Sarcoma  treated  with WLI showed  a rate of late lung toxicity of .6 (on a 0- 
3 scale  with 0 indicating  no toxicity)  and no severe  pulmonary  function  test 
abnormalities  among  patients  treated  with WLI and no thoracic  surgery.  An additional  
study  showed  reductions  in FEV1  in 50% of patients,  reductions  in total lung capacity  
in 60% of patients,  and reductions  in diffusing  capacity  in 81% of patients,  but all but 
one patient  had none  or mild self-reported  respi[INVESTIGATOR_500741] -up25. In one 
study  of patients  treated  with WLI for Wilms  Tumor,  a failure  of chest  wall growth  was 
thought  to contribute  to late effects  on pulmonary  function  though  the mean  age of 
patients  was young  (3 years  and 9 months)  and the radiation  dose  delivered  was 
20Gy27 . Taken  together,  these  results  indicate  that while  pulmonary  function  test 
abnormalities  are often  seen  after whole  lung irradiation,  the incidence  of clinically  
significant  pulmonary  toxicity  is low, particularly  at low-doses  of 15Gy,  which  is the 
dose  prescribed  in this protocol.

4.2 Design  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -075 A(6)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_644760]  therapy  (e.g. surgery  +/- radiation  to the primary  site) +/- any adjuvant  
chemotherapy.  The sequence  and types  of therapy  offered  prior to WLI will likely  vary based  
on primary  tumor  site, tumor  resectability,  extent  of metastatic  disease,  performance  status,  
and comorbidity.  Each  patient’s  therapy  will be determined  by [CONTACT_500753].  
 
Patients  are eligible  for this protocol  if their pulmonary  metastases  are present  at diagnosis   
or develop  over the course  of treatment.  After completion  of all planned  therapy,  patients  will 
be assessed  with a CT scan of their lungs  and a PET scan  if the CT scan shows  residual  
lung metastases.  Assuming  there  is no residual  pulmonary  disease  or that any remaining  
pulmonary  metastases  are <2 cm, patients  will proceed  to WLI. If there  is gross  disease  in 
the lung >[ADDRESS_644761] pulmonary  
metastases  <[ADDRESS_644762] an 
echocardiogram  and pulmonary  function  tests  (PFTs)  prior to initiation  of whole  lung 
irradiation  to assess  baseline  cardiac  and pulmonary  function.  Patients  will be simulated  for 
external  beam  radiation  with the use of a 4D CT to account  for respi[INVESTIGATOR_500742],  as per 
standard  practice.  Patients  will be treated  with IMRT  to 1500cGy  in 150cGy  fractions.  
 
After completion  of WLI, patients  will be followed  by [CONTACT_500754] 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months  (+/-3-6 weeks  depending  on timepoint).  Patients  will 
also have echocardiograms  at 6 months  (+/- 3 weeks)  and 12, and 24 months  (+/- 6 weeks).  
Patients  will also undergo  pulmonary  function  tests  (PFTs)  at 6 months  (+/- 3 weeks)  and 24 
months  (+/- 6 weeks).  Any severe  toxicity  due to radiation  will be carefully  evaluated  and 
further  accrual  will be terminated  if the level of toxicity  is greater  than expected.  The protocol  
may be terminated  or modified  as determined  by [CONTACT_62674].  Please  see 
section  11.0 regarding  specific  dose  limiting  toxicities  and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_500743].  
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
External  beam  radiation  therapy  will be administered  on an outpatient  basis,  once  daily 
(except  weekends  and holidays)  for approximately  two weeks.  Patients  will undergo  a 
simulation  prior to initiation  of radiation.  Once  an IMRT  plan is generated  which  meets  all 
dose  constraints  specified  in section  9.3.3 , patients  will be treated  with 6MV photons  for 10 
treatments.  Any pediatric  patients  who are too young  to lay still on a daily basis  will receive  
general  anesthesia  per department  practice.  
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
 
IMRT  is a sophisticated  technique  that uses a computer  controlled  multileaf  collimator  to shape  the 
intensity  of each  treatment  beam  to optimally  deliver  the dose  to the tumor  and protect  normal  
tissue.   IMRT  is being  used  to deliver  WLI in order  to minimize  the dose  to the heart  as explained  in 
section  3.3.2.

• The CTV is the bilateral  lung volume  including  all pleural  recesses and 
bilateral  hila. 
• The ITV is defined  as an expansion  on the CTV to encompass  the bilateral  
lungs  on all phases  of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_500745] 4DCT.  Careful  
review  of the sagittal  and coronal  views  of the costo -diaphragmatic  recesses  
should  help determine  the inferior  extent  of the pleural  cavity  and care must  
be taken  to ensure  that they are included  in the ITV. 
• The PTV is defined  as a [ADDRESS_644770]  AP-PA technique  using  2-D or 3-D planning,  the final PTV for IMRT  
in this protocol  will be more  accurate  because  we are utilizing  4-D scanning  
and then giving  a dosimetric  margin  of 1cm beyond  the maximum  lung 
expansion  (ITV).  
 
• 9.[ADDRESS_644771] 95% of the prescribed  dose.  The 
PTV used  for the purposes  of the DVH is the PTV as drawn  by [CONTACT_500759]  5mm  
from the skin (i.e. the buildup  region)  as is our departmental  practice.  No more  than 5% of 
the PTV should  receive  more  than 105%  of the prescribed  dose  and no more  than 1% of the 
PTV should  receive  more  than 110%  of the prescribed  dose.  For organs  at risk (OARs):  the 
maximum  doses  to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_127102],  breast  (in female  patients),  and liver should  be <107%,  
<108%,  and <110%  respectively  of the prescribed  dose.  For the heart:  
 
1) The maximum  dose  should  be <110%.  
 
2) The planner  should  reduce  the mean  heart  dose  until the specified  PTV coverage  
constraints  are approached  (i.e. until the planner  gets close  to the D95, D05, D01 PTV 
limits).

• Cardiac  dysfunction  
 
Rare  but serious  
 
• Pneumonitis  
• Increased  risk of secondary  cancer  
• Pulmonary  fibrosis  
 
Reproductive  risks:  Treatment  on this study  can affect  an unborn  child.  Patients  should  not 
become  pregnant  or breastfeed  a baby  [CONTACT_500760].  Sexually  active  
patients  who are at risk of getting  pregnant  or fathering  a baby  [CONTACT_500761] 3 months  thereafter.  
Definition of a Serious Adverse Events (SAE): 
 
• A Serious  Adverse  Event  is an adverse  experience  that: 
o Is fatal or life-threatening  
o Is disabling  
o Results  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_141065]  
o Results  in a congenital  anomaly  or occurrence  of malignancy  
o Any adverse  event  that is possibly  related  to WLI that is grade  3 or higher  will 
be considered  an adverse  event.  
 
Evaluation of SAE: 
 
Review  of the patient  record  including  the treatment  dosimetry  will be undertaken  by [CONTACT_211163]  [INVESTIGATOR_500746].  The principal  investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_500747],  
discontinue  the study  altogether,  or to modify  the protocol  prior to enrolling  more  patients  
pending  the results  of the review.  
Unacceptable  Toxicity:  
 
Enrollment  on the protocol  will be suspended  for WLI related  acute  toxicities  ≥ grade  [ADDRESS_644777]  wall 
pain. If one of these  events  is observed  in one patient,  then the protocol  will be closed  to 
further  accrual  until review  by [CONTACT_62674]  [INVESTIGATOR_500748].  
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
12.[ADDRESS_644778]  will 
score  toxicity  at each  visit. Any toxicity  recorded  within  three  months  of completion  of 
radiation  will be considered  acute.  Any toxicity  after three  months  from completion  of 
radiation  will be considered  late toxicity.  
12.2 Assessment of Secondary Objectives 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -075 A(6)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_644779]  will be obtained  at 3 and 6  months  (+/- 3 weeks)  and at 12, 18, and 
24 months  (+/- 6 weeks)  post-treatment.  This study  will use a modified  Response  Evaluation  
Criteria  in Solid  Tumor  (RECIST)  for assessment  of tumor  response.  The baseline  scan  will 
be the pre-irradiation  CT scan.  
 
All patients  will be assessed  as failure  or failure  free as defined  below.  Pulmonary  failure -free 
survival  will be defined  as survival  with no progressive  disease  in the lungs.  CR, PR, and SD 
will be considered  failure -free. 
 
For patients  with measurable  (≥5mm  but <10mm)  lung lesions  at the time of study  entry:  
 
a. The investigator  will identify  up to [ADDRESS_644780]  diameter  (LD) for all target  lesions  will be 
calculated  and reported  as the disease  measurement.  
b. Complete  response  (CR) is defined  as the disappearance  of all target  lesions.  
c. Partial  response  (PR) is defined  as at least a 30% decrease  in the disease  
measurement,  taking  as reference  the pre-irradiation  CT scan.  
d. Progressive  disease  (PD) is defined  as at least a 20% increase  in the disease  
measurement,  taking  as reference  the smallest  disease  measurement  recorded  
since  start of treatment,  or the appearance  of one or more  new lung lesions.  
e. Stable  disease  (SD) is neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor sufficient  
increase  to qualify  for PD. 
 
For patients  with no measurable  disease  present  at baseline:  
a. Stable  disease  (SD) is defined  as no appearance  of measurable  lesions  in the 
treated  area 
 
b. Progressive  disease  (PD) is defined  as the appearance  of measurable  lesions  on 
post-treatment  scans  and will be considered  failure -free if no measurable  lesions  
develop.

treatment  in patients  with synovial  sarcoma  and lung metastases.  To this end we will enroll  15 
eligible  patients  which  will take about  6 years.  Due to this long enrollment  time the safety  endpoint

will include  both acute  (<=3 months  from the end of WLI) and late toxicities  (>3 months  from the end 
of WLI).  Namely,  we will evaluate  the rate of any grade  3 toxicities  (including  pneumonitis,  
esophagitis,  pericarditis  and cardiac  dysfunction)  by [CONTACT_500762]-Meier estimation.  If a patient  
withdraws  from the protocol  (expected  to be 10% within  1 year),  or dies without  any grade  3  
toxicities  (expected  to be 50% at 1 year)  he/she  will be regarded  as a censoring  at such  time points.  
We will not use a competing  risks analysis  because  it is expected  that the withdrawal  and death  are 
independent  from toxicities,  and the actuarial  estimate  is believe  to be more  illustrative  of the toxicity  
profile  than the cumulative  incidence  rate by [CONTACT_500763] a competing  risk. For the decision  
rule we will look at the 1-year toxicity rate. If, the higher  bound  of the 85%,  1-sided  confidence  
interval  of the 1-year toxicity  rate based  on the (one minus)  Kaplan -Meier  estimate  is lower  than 0.25 
than we will declare  the whole  lung IMRT  procedure  safe.  This unusually  high type 1 error rate, 15%,  
is used  due to the rareness  of such  patients  and the high progression/mortality  rate without  WLI. To 
roughly  assess  the power  of the study  with [ADDRESS_644782]  and other  progressions  and death  are considered  as 
the competing  risks.  Overall  survival  rates  will be estimated  by [CONTACT_8761]-Meier method.  
 
15.0 RESEARCH  PARTICIPANT  REGISTRATION   AND  RANDOMIZATION  PROCEDURES  
 
15.1 Research  Participant  Registration  
 
Confirm  eligibility  as defined  in the section  entitled  Criteria  for Patient/Subject  Eligibility.  
 
Obtain  informed  consent,  by [CONTACT_40136].  
During  the registration  process  registering  individuals  will be required  to complete  a protocol  
specific  Eligibility  Checklist.  
For patients  enrolled,  immediately  after consent  is obtained,  the RSA at MSKCC  will regis ter 
participants  in the Clinical  Trial Management  System  (CTMS).  Once  the participant’s  
eligibility  is established,  the registration  will be finalized  and the participants  will be 
randomized  using  the Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB).  
15.2 Randomization

IRB Number: 14 -075 A(6)  
Approval date: 29 -Aug-2018  
Page  18 of 22  
  
 
This is not a randomized  study.  
 
16.1 DATA  MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
 
A Research  Study  Assistant  (RSA)  will be assigned  to the study.  The responsibilities  of the RSA 
include  project  compliance,  data collection,  abstraction  and entry,  data reporting,  regulatory  
monitoring,  problem  resolution  and prioritization,  and coordinati  ng the activities  of the protocol  study  
team.  
 
The data collected  from this study  will be entered  into a secure  Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB).  
Source  documentation  will be available  to support  the computerized  patient  record.  
 
Data collection  will principally  assess:  
• Adherence  to informed  consent  procedures.  The informed  consent  must  contain  a full 
explanation  of the possible  advantages,  benefits,  risks,  alternative  treatment  options,  and 
availability  of treatment  in the case  of injury,  in accordance  with Federal  Regulations  as 
detailed  in 21CFR50.   The investigator  is responsible  for obtaining  written  informed  consent  
from potential  patients.   A copy of the signed  document  will be given  to the patient,  and the 
original will be retained by [CONTACT_500764]/her copy of the record forms. 
 
• Adherence  to eligibility  criteria.  The study  RSA will ensure  that documentation  exists  for all 
eligibility  criteria  and that the checklist  is complete  and signed  by [CONTACT_500765],  prior to initiation  of treatment.  All supporting  source  documentation  must  be 
maintained  in the patient’s  research  file. 
 
• Safety  Evaluation:  Radiation  related  toxicities  will be recorded  as they occur,  and graded  
according  to the CTCAE  Version  4.0.  Toxicities  that cannot  be graded  using  the CTCAE  will 
be graded  as grade  1 (mildly  symptomatic),  grade  2 (moderately  symptomatic  but not 
interfering  significantly  with function),  grade  3 (causing  significant  interference  with function),  
or grade  4 (life-threatening).  All SAEs  will be recorded,  whether  or not related  to study  
treatment.  
 
• The occurrence  of unacceptable  toxicity  indicating  the need  for cessation  of treatment  will 
require  mandatory  reporting  to the IRB. In this circumstance,  the IRB will be consulted  before  
a patient  is removed  from therapy.  If the physician  feels it is in the best interests  of the  
patient  to stop treatment,  the IRB will be consulted.  
 
• We expect  to enroll  15 patients  in 6 years.  Since  we are assessing  two-year follow -up, we 
estimate  that it will take 6 years  to complete  the study.  
 
 
16.1 Quality  Assurance  
 
Regular  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  and completeness  
of registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data 
and inconsistencies.   Accrual  rates,  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up, 
will be monitored  periodically  throughout  the study  period,  and potential  problems  will be 
brought to the attention of the study team for discussion and action.  Rando m-sample data

quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_279143] a minimum  of 
twice  per year,  or more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.2 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM) Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  
were  approved  by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.  These  plans  address  the 
new policies  set forth by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy of the Nationa l Cancer  
Institute  for Data and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials”.  This document  is available  at:  
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  
established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_40138].  The MSKCC  Data and 
Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at:  
http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm There are several different mechanisms by [CONTACT_500766],  safety  and quality.  Institutional  processes  are in place  for 
quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  
therapeutic  response,  and staff education  on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  
procedures  for quality  control.   Additionally,  there  are two institutional  committees  that are 
responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials programs.  The Data and Safety  
Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  
Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for phase  III clinical  trials,  report  to the MSKCC  Research  Council  
and Institutional  Review  Board.  During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  
protocol  will be assessed  for its level of risk and the degree  of monitoring  required.  Every   
type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI 
cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed,  and monitoring  procedures  will be established  at 
the time of protocol  activation.

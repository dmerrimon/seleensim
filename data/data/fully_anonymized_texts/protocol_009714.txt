2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 DLBCL and PMBCL  
 
Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative 
malignancies with differing patterns of behavior and responses to treatment.  The 
prognosis depends on the histologic type, stage, and response to therapy.  The NHLs can 
be divi ded into two prognostic groups: the indolent lymphomas and the aggressive 
lymphomas.  In Western populations, the majority of NHL (~85%) are of B -cell origin. 
NHL is a significant medical problem.  Last year, the American Cancer Society estimated 
that 71,8 50 persons were diagnosed with NHL, and despi[INVESTIGATOR_124366], 
19,790 died from this disease (Siegel et al. 2016) .  Diffuse large B -cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) in itself is recognized to be an aggressive B -cell NHL, often presents clinically 
in a more symptomatic manner than indolent lymphoma, but a considerable number of 
these patients can be cured using intensive combinatio n chemotherapy regimens.  The 
standard treatment for patients with aggressive lymphoma who do not obtain a complete 
response with frontline treatment —or for those who relapse — is intensive salvage

 chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_12676] (ASCT).  Not all patients are 
suitable candidates for this aggressive treatment option.  In addition, relapsed or 
progressive disease after auto -SCT occurs in more than 50% of patients with NHL (Philip 
et al. 1995) ; for these patients, prognosis is poor, with a median overall survival of 7 to 
11 months (Paltiel et al. 2003) .  Currently there is no consensus treatment for patients 
who have relapsed or refractory disease after auto -SCT.  
DLBCL is comprised of two major molecular subtypes: germinal center B cell -like 
(GCB) DLBCL and activated B cell -like (ABC) DLBCL (Alizadeh et al. 2000) .  All 
DLBCL lymphomas express the BCR on their cell surface and ABC DLBCLs rely on B -
cell recept or (BCR) signaling for their survival.  Downstream of the BCR are critical 
transducers that regulate DLBCL pathogenesis.  These include proximal BCR signaling 
effectors SYK, BTK, BLNK, PLCγ2, PI3Kδ and PKCβ.  The pathways downstream of 
the BCR include the PI3K -AKT -mTOR signaling pathway, which provides a direct 
conduit from diverse stimuli, including cell surface receptors and metabolic changes 
within the cell, to downstream pathways affecting cellular growth, size, survival and 
angiogenesis (Yuan and Cantley 2008) . Therefore, the targeting of the PI3K -AKT -mTOR 
has strong rationale.  
Primary mediastinal B -cell lymphoma (PMBCL), originally described in the 1980s, 
accounts for up to 10% of DLBCL.  It is epi[INVESTIGATOR_124367], clinically, and biologically 
distinct from the other subtypes of DLBCL (GCB].  Similar to nodular sclerosing 
Hodgkin lymphoma arising in the mediastinum, it is likely derived from a thymic B cell 
and typi[INVESTIGATOR_124368], 
which may invade local structures.  Studies of gene expression profiling demonstrate a 
significant overlap between PMBCL and nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma.  In fact, 
PMBCL shares a third of its genes with NSHL (Rosenwald et al. 2003) .  Among the most 
common genetic alterations in PMBCL are abnormalities on chromosome 9p (up to 75%) 
and 2p (approximately 50%).  Although these abnormalities have been described in 
NSHL, they are t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_124369].  The 9p region 
encodes Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), which then activates the transcription factor signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6 through phosphorylation (Rosenwald 
et al. 2003) .  Also, in the 9p region, programmed death ligands (PD -L) 1 and 2 are 
rearranged at a frequency of 20% (Twa et al. 2014) , which higher than what is seen in 
other subtypes of DLBCL.  
The optimal therapeutic approach to PMBCL is controversial, with a paucity of 
prospective studies.  PMBCL is frequently treated like other DLBCL subtypes.  The cure 
rate for progressive or recurrent disease after primary therapy is low.  Across the disease  
spectrum, relapsed/refractory NHL continues to represent an unmet medical need.  Given 
the few treatment options available for patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma, 
novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_124370].  Treatment with convention al 
cytotoxic chemotherapy results in promising responses, however a great majority of 
subjects relapse due to emergence of molecularly resistant clones.  Evasion of the host 
immune responses is an important mechanism for inducing resistance to cancer thera py 
(Schreiber et al. 2011) .  Over the last several years, drug development in oncology has 
seen the emergence of immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Strategies to block molecular and cellular 
mediators of cancer induced immunosuppression such as Cytotoxic T -Lymphocyte

 Antigen 4 (CTLA4, CD152), Programmed Death -1 receptor (PD -1, CD279) or T 
regulatory cells (T reg) have been explored both in solid and hematologic malignancies 
with some success.  
 
Tumor cells up regulate expression of the immune check point receptors (ICR) such as 
CTLA4, PD -1 and the ligands (PD -L1, B7 -H1/CD274) ICR which effectively attenuates 
the T -cell proliferation and anti -tumor effects.  While the necessary machinery for an 
effective antitumor immune response is present in lymphoma patients, the immune 
response appears ineffective and most lymphomas escape immune surveillance and 
progress.  In prior work (Wilcox et al. 2009a; Wilcox et al. 2009b; Yang et al. 2012; 
Yang et al. 2006) , we have shown th at the tumor microenvironment is highly 
immunosuppressive due to the presence of regulatory T (Treg) cells, suppressive 
monocytes and immunosuppressive cytokines.  Furthermore, we have found that PD -
L1/PD -1 signaling is a dominant mechanism accounting for immune suppression present 
in the tumor microenvironment (see Figure 1) (Wilcox et al. 2009a; Yang et al. 2012) .  
PD-1 immune check point inhibition has been shown to result in up regulation of genes 
associated wit h effector, NK cell function and cytolytic effects (Keir et al. 2008) .  The 
cardinal biological effects of PD -1 immune check point inhibition are manifested by 
[CONTACT_61828]8+T cells, averting depletion of memory B cells, depleting 
Foxp3+iTreg cells and restoring robust Th1 immunity (Keir et al. 2008) .  Targeting PD -
1immune check points has the potential to play a major role in cancer therapy by

 2.2 CTEP IND Agents  
 
2.2.1 Nivolumab  
Nivolumab is a fully human, IgG4(ⱪ) isotype mAb that binds PD -1 on activated immune 
cells and disrupts engagement of the receptor with its ligands PD -L1(B7 -H1/CD274) and 
PD-L2 (B7 -DC/CD273), abrogating the inhibitory signals and augmenting host antitumor 
immune response (Keir et al. 2008) .  Nivolumab has demonstrated efficacy in solid and 
hematological malignancies (Ansell et al. 2015; Brahmer et al. 2012) .  In early phase 
trials in hematologic malignancies, both nivolumab and pembrolizumab were found to be 
well tolerated and demonstrated clinical responses in various disease histologies.  In 
Hodgkin lymphoma patients, both agents were highly effective with very durable 
responses (Ansell et al. 2015) . In the nivolumab trial, an analysis of the responses seen in 
patients with other histological subtypes of lymphoma also showed clinically promising 
results (Lesokhin et al. 2014) .  While not quite as impressive as the results seen in the 
Hodgkin cohort, an overall response rate (ORR) in follicular lymphoma of 40% was seen.  
In patients with diffuse large B -cell lym phoma, 36% of patients responded to treatment.  
Though recent unpublished data from a phase 2 trial suggests a much lower ORR in 
DLBCL , in the low teens . A phase 1b multi -cohort trial in heavily pre -treated 
relapsed/refractory PMBCL using pembrolizumab showed that it was safe and active in 
these patients, with an ORR of 4 1% (7/17) (Zinzani et al. 2017) ; with a median follow -up 
of 11.3 months, median duration of response (DOR) was not reached.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Nivolumab pharmacokinetics were assessed using a population PK approach, over a 
dose range of 0.1 to 20 mg/kg administered as a single dose or multiple doses as a 60 -
minute intravenous infusion every 2 or 3 weeks.  Nivolumab clearance decreases over 
time, with a mean maximal reduction (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) from 
baseline values of approximately 24.5% ( 47.6%) resulting in a geometric mean steady 
state clearance (CLss) (CV%) of 8.2 mL/h (53.9%); the decrease in CLss is not 
considered clinically relevant. The geometric mean volume of distribution at steady 
state (Vss) (CV%) is 6.8 L (27.3%), and geometric mean elimination half -life (t1/2) is 
25 days (77.5%). Steady -state concentrations of nivolumab were reached by 
[CONTACT_3450] 12 weeks whenadministered at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and systemic 
accumulation was approximately 3.7 -fold. The exposure to nivolumab  increases dose 
proportionally over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks. 
The predicted exposure of nivolumab after a 30 -minute infusion is comparable to that 
observed with a 60 -minute infusion.  Based on dose/exposure efficacy and safety 
relationships, there are no clinically significant differences in safety and efficacy 
between a nivolumab dose of 240 mg or 3 mg/kg every [ADDRESS_139809] on the clearance of nivolumab: age weight, gender, race, baseline 
LDH, PD -L1 expression, solid tumor type, tumor size, renal impairment, and mild 
hepatic impairment.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Rationale for Modification of the Dosage of Nivolumab After 8 Cycles  
 
Data obtained from manufacturer (Bristol -Myers Squibb) indicates that nivolumab 
administered as 480 mg Q4W over 30 -minutes is expected to offer the same clinical 
benefit as 3 mg/kg Q2W in subjects with melanoma, squamous non -small cell lung 
cancer (SQ NSCL C), non -squamous NSCLC (NSQ, NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), urothelial carcinoma 
(UC), and classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL).  This information is based upon data 
gathered in the course of the ext ensive nivolumab development program across multiple 
tumor types as well as robust clinical pharmacology and quantitative systems 
pharmacology (QSP) analyses.  
 
The proposed dose modification is based on the comprehensive understanding of 
nivolumab pharmacology and mechanism of action taken together with the following 
data and analyses:  
 
• Comparison of nivolumab exposures achieved by 240 mg Q2W, 480 mg Q4W and 3 
mg/kg Q2W in subjects with melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, SCCHN, cHL, and UC  
 
• Efficacy bridging evaluation  
o Comparison of the efficacy of nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W, [ADDRESS_139810] to the following 
endpoints: overall survival(OS), objective response (OR)

Q2W, 240 mg Q2W, and 480 mg Q4W, including sensitivity of RO to 
parameters that may vary across solid tumor types  
 
• Safety bridging evaluation  
o Assessment of safety margins, by [CONTACT_124424] 240 
mg Q2W and 480 mg Q4W relative to the well -tolerated 10 mg/kg Q2W 
regimen  
o Comparison of the safety of nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W, [ADDRESS_139811] to the following 3 endpoints: Adverse events 
leading to discontinuation or death (AEDC/D), Grade  3+ adverse events (AE -
Grade 3+), and Grade 2+ immune -mediated adverse events (AE -IM Grade 2+)  
o Clinical safety data from subjects treated with nivolumab 480 mg Q4W 
administered over a 30 -minute infusion  
 
The exposure -response efficacy analysis between the 3 mg/kg Q2W and the [ADDRESS_139812] ratios for survival with the 480 mg Q4W 
regimen are very similar to the 3 mg/kg Q2W regimen, resulting in a similar hazard ratio 
relati ve to the standard of care treatment studied in each respective phase 3 clinical trial. 
In addition, these analyses indicated that similar outcomes would be achieved when using 
an early efficacy measure of response rate (objective response; OR) as well.  T he 
exposure -efficacy response trends were consistent across different tumor types with

 varying tumor immunogenicity and mutational burdens.  Hence, in cases where 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W has been proven to be superior to standard of care, nivolumab 
480 mg Q4W is predicted to provide comparable benefit, irrespective of tumor type.  
 
This position is further supported by [CONTACT_124425] a mechanistic 
quantitative systems pharmacology model incorporating transport to site of action, 
binding kinetics and varied physiological factors representing highly perfused or stromal 
tumors.  The median intratumoral RO predicted with this model is high for nivolumab 3 
mg/kg Q2W, 240 mg Q2W and 480 mg Q4W trough levels over a range of possible 
physiological parameter values.  It is postulated that high RO at the tumor site will 
initiate the immuno -stimulatory cascade resulting in similar efficacy with 3 mg/kg Q2W, 
[ADDRESS_139813] clinical data for the 10 mg/kg Q2W regimen 
that had a similar safety profile to the 3 mg/kg Q2W regimen.  The nivolumab exposure 
parameters, including Cmax, resulting from 480 mg Q4W were well below Cmaxss 
values achieved with 10 mg/kg, providing a robust exposure safety margin. In addition, 
there were negligible differences in the probabilities of experiencing an adverse event 
irrespective of severity or adverse event type.  Moreover, key safety results from the 
interim safety analysis of CA209511 (Part 2) demonstrate that the safety profile of 
nivolumab 480 mg IV over 30 minutes Q4W is consistent with the established safety 
profile of nivolumab (240 mg Q2W or 3 mg/kg Q2W administered IV over 60 minutes) 
across mul tiple indications and Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC].  Taken 
together, these findings indicated that the safety profile of nivolumab is expected to be 
unaltered by [CONTACT_124426].  
 
Based on extensive quantitative clinical pharmacology analyses and safety analyses 
summarized in this submission, the nivolumab [ADDRESS_139814] similar efficacy and safety profiles to those established 
with the 3 mg/kg Q2W dosing regimen administered over [ADDRESS_139815] 8 cycles  on the study.  After 8 cycles , Nivolumab will be administered at the 
dose of 480 mg IV every 4 weeks. Both dosage strengths will be infused over 30 minutes.  
 
2.2.2 Copanlisib  (BAY 80 -6946)  
 
The B -cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway is critical for the development, 
proliferation, and survival of malignant B -cells.  Drugs targeting BCR pathway kinases, 
including the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib [2] and the phosphatidylinositol  
3-kinase (PI3K) -δ isoform inhibitor idelalisib [3], have proven to be effective treatment 
options in patients who have relapsed or are refractory to standard therapy.  However, 
fatal and/or serious toxicities have been associated with idelalisib use [3, 4 ] and, recently,

Protocol Version Date:    July [ADDRESS_139816] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [5 –7].  Theref ore, new 
approaches, such as dual inhibition of PI3K -δ and PI3K -α, are necessary to both mitigate 
toxicity issues and improve efficacy [8 –10]. 
Copanlisib (BAY 80 -6946; [COMPANY_014], [LOCATION_010]) is an intravenous pan -class I 
PI3K inhibitor with predominant activity against the PI3K -α and PI3K -δ isoform (Liu et 
al. 2013) .  A first -inhuman phase 1 study established the maximum tolerated dose of 
copanlisib as 0.8 mg/kg administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 -day cycle (Patnaik et 
al. 2016) .  In an expansion cohort including NHL patients, severe toxicities were low and 
there were early signs of efficacy, including complete response (CR) or partial response 
(PR) in all six patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma,  and one of three 
patients with DLBCL (Patnaik et al. 2016) .  A phase 2 study of copanlisib conducted in 
indolent and aggressive lymphomas (Dreyling et al. 2017) , the ORR w as 43.7% (14/32) 
in the indolent cohort and 27.1% (13/48) in the aggressive cohort  including mantle cell 
lymphoma, Peripheral T -cell lymphoma and DLBCL ; median progression -free survival 
(PFS) was 70 days (range, 0 –897) in the aggressive cohort with a median DOR of 166 
days (range, 0 –786).  In the 15  patient with DLBCL out of  a total of 34 patients with 
aggressive lymphomas , only 1 PR was seen with an ORR of 6.7% , Common adverse 
events included hyperglycemia (57.1%; grade ≥ 3, 23.8%), hypertension (54.8%; grade ≥ 
3, 40.5%), and diarrhea (40.5%; grade ≥ 3, 4.8%), all generally manageable. Neutropenia 
occurred in 28.6% of patients (grade 4, 11.9%) (Dreyling et al. 2017) . In a phase 2 study  
of 40 patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL after 1 or more lines of therapy, the ORR 
was 25%. Higher responses were seen in the ABC subtype (37.5%) as compared to the 
GCB subgroup (13.6%) (Lenz et al. 2017) . To date, there is no data with copan lisib in 
PMBCL.    
Copanlisib Pharmacokinetics:  
Copanlisib demonstrated dose -proportional increases in the plasma exposures (Cmax and 
[AUC( 0 25)] over the dose range of 0.1 to 1.2 mg/kg (absolute dose range: 5 to 93 mg) 
with a terminal elimination half -life of 39.1 h. There is no time -dependency and no 
accumulation in the pharmacokinetics of copanlisib. The recommended (Phase 2) and 
approved dose of monotherapy copanlisib is 60 mg given i.v. as a one hour IV infusion 
on an intermittent weekly schedule on days 1, 8 and 15 in a 3 weeks on/1 week off 
schedule.  
Copanlisib is eliminated predominantly via feces (64%; unchanged 30%) compared to 
urine (22%; unchanged 15%). Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that age, 
gender, race, smoking status, body weight, mild hepatic impairment, and mild to 
moderate rena l impairment had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
copanlisib and therefore no dose recommendation is needed for these specific 
populations. Based on the preliminary categorical analyses and the central tendency, 
copanlisib does n ot prolong the QT/QTc interval.  
 
Copanlisib metabolism is primarily mediated by [CONTACT_097]3A (>90%) with minor contribution

15 
 of CYP1A1 (<10%).  Concomitant use of copanlisib with strong cytochrome P450 3A 
(CYP3A) inducers may decrease copanlisib AUC and should be avoided. Concomitant 
use of copanlisib with strong CYP3A inhibitors increases copanlisib AUC and a dosage 
reduction t o 45 mg is advised if patients required strong inhibitors. Copanlisib has low 
risk for clinical drug -drug interactions of concomitant drug products through inhibition or 
induction of CYP enzymes, inhibition of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 
(UGT) enzymes. Copanlisib is not an inhibitor of P -gp, BCRP, multi -drug resistance -
associated protein (MRP2), bile salt export pump (BSEP), OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT 
1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, and MATE1 at therapeutic [ADDRESS_139817] available version of the investigator's brochure

2.3  Rationale for Combination  
 
In a preclinical mouse model, p110δ inactivation in regulatory T cells (Treg) unleashes 
CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and induces tumor regression (Ali et al. 2014) .  Thus, p110δ 
inhibitors can break tumor -induced immune tolerance.  In the A20 DLBCL syngeneic 
mouse model with tumor intrinsic regulation of the immunosuppressive environment, 
treatment with copanlisib resulted in effective down regulation of tumor ‐infiltrating Tregs 
and an increase of INFg+ CD44+ cells in tumors (Liu 2017) .  PR were observed in 75% 
of mice treated with copanlisib in combination with a surrogate anti ‐mouse PD ‐1 (aPD‐1, 
BioXCell) compared to 0% PR in the monotherapy groups.  These data support the 
rational for the combination of copanlisib and nivolumab in DLBCL.

Copanlisib is administered by [CONTACT_941] 1 hour IV infusion weekly for 3 weeks (days 1, 8, and 
15) of each 28 -day cycle.  Copanlisib dose will be determined using a safety cohort in 6 
patients with Copanlisib 60 mg weekly days 1,8,15 with Nivolumab 240 mg  IV on days 1 
and 15 each cycle.  Copanlisib could be reduced to 45 mg if toxicity was observed with 
the combination, and the safety cohort will be re -evaluated  (Investigator’s Brochure, 
2016).   Cycle 9 and beyond treatment will be given as follows:  Copanlisib: Days 1and 
15 of each cycle Nivolumab (N) will be given IV day 1 only starting at 480 mg flat dose.  
 
Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1)  
The following assessments should be performed on Cycle 1, Day 1 before receiving study 
treatment unless otherwise specified.  
• On Cycle 1 Day 1, patients are not required to be fasting prior to the pre -dose 
glucose measurement.   
 
• Glucose will be measured at pre -dose and p ost dose  1 hour and 2 hours after the

metabolism, copanlisib infusions could be associated with temporarily increase in blood 
glucose. Addition of meal in close proximity to copanlisib infusion may exacerbate 
glucose increase.  
On infusion days , a low carbohydrate diet is recommended,  the timing and content of 
caloric  meal intake and additional glucose testing (if clinically indicated) is managed and 
monitored by [CONTACT_124430].  
All glucose measurements done at the site, oral glucose lowering medication and/or

The use of corticosteroids as antiemetics prior to copanlisib administration is not allowed. 
After administration, flush the line with 0.9 % sodium chloride to ensure complete dose is 
given. No IV glucose preparations should be administered on the days of infusion.  
 
5.1.2 Nivolumab  
 
Nivolumab will be given intravenously at a dose of 240 mg on days 1 and 15 of each 28 -
day cycle for cycles 1 through 8 and at a dose of 480 mg on day 1 of cycle 9 and all 
subsequent cycles.  
 
Nivolumab is to be administered as a 30-minute IV infusion, using a volumetric pump  
with a 0.2 -1.2 micron in -line filter at the protocol -specified dose. Fixed dose (eg, 240 mg, 
360 mg, or 480 mg flat dose) nivolumab injection can be infused undiluted or diluted 
with 0.9% normal saline so as not to exceed a total infusion volume of 1 60 mL.  It is not 
to be administered as an IV push or bolus injection. At the end of the infusion, flush the 
line with a sufficient quantity of normal saline.  
 
5.1.3  Safety Cohort  
 
No dose escalation will be utilized, but a saf ety run -in of 6 patients with DLBCL or

[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of DLT  
 
A DLT is defined by [CONTACT_124431] (CTCAE v. 5) 
within the first cycle of treatment of dose escalation cohorts, which is possibly, probably, 
or definitely related to copanlisib and/or nivolumab in order to evaluate potential toxicity 
related treatment delays or any event within the first cycle of trea tment that requires 
permanent discontinuation of copanlisib, and/or nivolumab.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Non-Hematological DLT  
 
Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non -hematological toxicity that is possibly, probably or 
definitely attributable to the treatment regimen is considered a DLT, including the 
following:  
o Non-hematologic toxicity that causes a delay of >14 days in initiating cycle 2.  
o Any type of grade 3 -4 hypersensitivity reaction (i.e.: allergic reaction, 
anaphylaxis, serum sickness, skin disorders, etc.), regardless of attribution, that 
necessitate discontinuation of study drug.  
o Any type of grade 3 -4 immune related adverse event including skin reactions.  
o Grade 3 or greater colitis and bowel perforation  
o Grade 3 ALT/AST elevation or [ADDRESS_139849]  
o Grade 3 -4 pneumonitis  
o Grade 4 hyperglycemia: persistent post -infusion grade [ADDRESS_139850]. 
Definition of persistent occurrence is based on repeated fasting blood glucose 
measurement following tre atment with copanlisib.

monitored if these medications cannot be avoided. These medications may 
include quinidine, cyclosporine, and digoxin.  
• Systemic corticosteroid therapy at a daily dose higher than [ADDRESS_139854]/MRI 
screening. If a patient is on chronic corticosteroid therapy, corticosteroids s hould 
be de -escalated to the maximum allowed dose before the screening. Patients may 
be using topi[INVESTIGATOR_124374]. Short -term (up to 7 days) systemic 
corticosteroids above 1 0 mg p rednisolone or equivalent will be allowed for the 
management of acute conditions ( e.g., treatment non -infectious pneumonitis). The 
use of corticosteroids as antiemetics prior to copanlisib administration will not be 
allowed.

6. Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications for Copanlisib and Nivolumab  
 
Below are dose modification tables applicable to all patients participating in this study for 
the following adverse events.   
 
Patients who develop adverse events while being treated must have one or both drugs 
held or discontinued according to the guidance provided in the tables below.   
 
Please use as written and contact [CONTACT_124434].  Note that if 
a patient experiences several adverse events and there are conflicting recommendations, 
the investigator should use the recommended treatment modification for the mo st serious 
event that has a higher level of modification, i.e. going off study treatment versus holding 
drug.  
 
Dose hold = study drugs must be held  as indicated .  Day 1 of the next cycle is given when the 
patient meets the protocol criteria to restart drugs.  The current cycle will include all days until 
the patient resumes treatment and may be longer than 28 days.

neurologic changes or radiologic evidence of pi[INVESTIGATOR_124384] 3 events.  
Any patients who require additional immune suppressive treatment beyond steroids 
should go off study treatment . 
 
Patients requiring > two dose delays for the same event should go off protocol therapy.  
 
Prior to starting corticosteroids or hormone replacement for any reason, appropriate 
endocrine testing including cortisol, ACTH, TSH and T4 must be obtained to document 
baseline.  
 
Please note that in some cases the treatment algorithms recommend steroids if symptoms 
do not resolve in 7 days.  However, this recommendation is not meant to delay steroid 
treatment at any time it is clinically indicated.   
 
Patients may be dose -delayed for evaluation and restarted depending on results.  
Any patient started on corticosteroids initially who is determined to not require steroid 
treatment for an autoimmune adverse event may resume therapy after a 2 week 
observation period without further symptoms at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_115655].

6.[ADDRESS_139863] -infusion glucose>250  mg/dL after study drug administration 
may continue treatment.  However, the next infusion must be delayed until the patient’s pre -
infusion glucose level s return to <160  mg/dL (fasting) or <200  mg/dL (non -fasting).  Guidelines 
for the management of transient glucose increases are given in APPENDIX D and APPENDIX  
E.  Continuing  occurrence of post -infusion blood glucose >400 mg/dL, based on repeated 
laboratory analysis despi[INVESTIGATOR_124385] 2 infusions of copanlisib,  will 
require dose reduction by [CONTACT_30560].  
• Further dose reduction (where appropriate per study design/population)  is allowed as 
long as discontinuation criteria was not met.  
• Dose re -escalation is allowed when a patient has achieved controlled glucose levels per 
investigator’s judgment.  
• Persistent occurrence of post -infusion blood glucose >400 mg/dL based on laboratory 
analysis which occurred at the lowest dose level despi[INVESTIGATOR_124386] 
(after at least one cycle of treatment) with consultation of a diabetes specialist  requires 
permanent discontinuation of the study drug.  
 
6.2 Treatment of blood pressure increases associated with copanlisib  
 
It is important that patients with pre -existing arterial hypertension adhere to their regular 
medication schedule and take their usual doses on the days of study drug infusion.  
The management of acute blood pressure (BP) increases following copanlisib will need to be 
individualized for each patient, but experience from a Bayer -sponsored phase 1 study with

 copanlsisib has suggested the benefit of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers ( i.e., 
amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], felodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]).  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_124387] -dihydropyridine should also be considered.   
Addition of non -dihydropyridine can be considered because of low significant clinical DDI 
potential with these drugs based on results with itraconozole data   In general, it is advisable for 
sites to be prepared, so that anti -hypertensive medication is readily available in case of need.  
In the event of the occurrence of arterial hypertension ≥150/90 mmHg during infusion of 
copanlisib at any cycle, antihypertensive treatment is suggested.  In the event of the occurrence of 
grade 3 arterial hypertension (≥160/100 mmHg) during infusion of co panlisib, the infusion should 
be interrupted and anti -hypertensive treatment as suggested above is administered.  Infusion can 
be resumed when BP has returned to <150/90 mmHg.  
Blood pressure measurement on treatment days  
Blood pressure will be measured every 5 -10 min prior to each copanlisib dose (no more than 4 
measurements) until there are two consecutive results <150/90 mmHg.  If blood pressure is ≥ 
150/[ADDRESS_139864] for 5 -10 min before blood pressure is recorded.  
On infusion days, blood pressure will be measured at 0 hour (pre -dose), 30 min (mid -infusion), 60 
min (end of infusion), and 1 hour and 2 hours after the end of infusion .  
NOTE : A window of ±10 min is allowed for all BP measurements, except for pre -dose (0 hour) 
measurement.  
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section s 7.2 and 
7.3) will determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting via the CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System (CTEP -AERS) in addition  to routine  reporting.

7.5 Secondary Malignancy  
 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a meta stasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an 
NCI Protocol #:  [ZIP_CODE]

 NCI IND/IDE be reported expeditiously via CTEP -AERS .  Three options are available to 
describe the event:  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
 
7.6 Second Malignancy  
 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine AE 
reporting unless otherwise specified .

Description:  The powder is white to yellow solid substance.  
 
How Supplied:  Copanlisib is supplied by [CONTACT_124435], CTEP, DCTD, NCI.  The agent is available as a 
lyophilized product containing 60 mg of copanlisib in a 6 mL injection vial.  The excipi[INVESTIGATOR_124392], sodium hydroxide, citric acid, and water for injection.  
 
Preparation:   Using appropriate aseptic technique, reconstitute the 60 mg vial of copanlisib 
with 4.4 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride resulting in a concentration of 15 mg/ml.  Gently 
shake well for 30 seconds and allow the vial to stand for 1 minute to let bubbles rise to the 
surface. Repeat if undissolved substance is still present. The reconstituted solution may be 
slightly yellow and should be clear prior to being withdrawn from the vial.   Withdraw the 
appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution and fu rther dilute by [CONTACT_124436] a 50-200 mL 
0.9% sodium chloride bag. Mix well  by [CONTACT_24518] .  
 
Storage: Store intact vials between 2°C and 8°C.  
 
If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return copanlisib to between 
2°C and 8°C  and quarantine the supplies.  Provide a detailed report of the excursion 
(including documentation of temperature monitoring and duration of the excursion) to 
[EMAIL_087]  for determination of suitability.  
 
Stability:  Stability studies of the vials are ongoing.   The diluted solution should be used 
immediately (stored up to 4 hours at room temperature including preparation and 
administration).   If the diluted solution for infusion is not used immediately, it is stable for 
up to 24 hours refrigerated between 2°C and 8°C. It takes approximately 60 minutes for the 
100 mL diluted solution to return to room temperature after refrigeration.  The infus ion 
should be completed within 24 hours of preparation.  
 
CAUTION:  The single -use lyophilized dosage form contains no antibacterial 
preservatives.  Therefore, it is advised that the reconstituted product be discarded 6 hours 
after initial entry.  
 
Route  of Administration: IV infusion   
 
Method  of Administration:   The diluted solution for infusion is administered IV over 1 
hour. After administration, flush the line to ensure complete dose is given.  No IV glucose 
preparations should be administered on the days of infusion.  
 
Potential Drug Interactions:    
In vitro, copanlisib is metabolized primarily via CYP 3A4 and to a minor extent by 
[CONTACT_097]1A1.  It is also a substrate of P -gp and BCRP, but not a substrate of MATEs, OCTs, 
OATs, or OATPs. Concomitant administration with strong inhibitors or inducers of 
CYP3A4  should be avoided.  Use caution when administered with strong inhibitors and 
inducers of CYP1A1, P -gp, and BCRP.   Smoking tobacco may reduce drug exposure since 
NCI Protocol #:  [ZIP_CODE]  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Protocol Version Date:    July [ADDRESS_139876] a low risk for inhibition or induction of CYP isoforms, inhibition of UGT isoforms, 
and inhibition of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase.  Copanlisib does not inhibi t P-gp, 
BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, bile salt export pump (BSEP), 
MRP2, or MATE1 at therapeutic [ADDRESS_139877] low protein binding.  
 
Special H andling:  Copanlisib is not genotoxic in vitro or in vivo.  Copanlisib is expected to 
adversely affect male and female reproduction.  
 
Patient Care Implications: . Females of child -bearing potential and male patients must use 
adequate contraception while receiving copanlisib and for [ADDRESS_139878] 3 hours after start of infusion and 
hyperglycemia is frequently observed persisting for approximately 1 -3 days after study 
drug administration. Refer to protocol document for treatment and monitoring guidelines.

 differentiation 279 [CD279]) cell surface membrane receptor. PD -1 is a negative regulatory 
receptor expressed by [CONTACT_93247] T and B lymphocytes. Binding of PD -1 to its ligands, 
programmed death –ligand 1 (PD -L1) and 2 (PD -L2), results in the down -regulation of 
lymphocyte activation. Nivolumab inhibits the binding of PD -1 to PD -L1 and PD -L2.  
Inhibition of the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands promotes immune responses and 
antigen -specific T -cell responses to both foreign antigens as well as self -antige ns. 
 
Description:   Nivolumab Injection is a clear to opalescent, colorless to pale yellow liquid; 
light (few) particulates may be present. The drug product is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, single -
use, isotonic aqueous solution formulated in sodium citrate, sodium chloride, mann itol, 
diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (pentetic acid) and polysorbate 80 (Tween® 80), and 
water for injection.  Dilute solutions of hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may be 
used for pH adjustment (pH 5.5 -6.5). 
 
How Supplied:   Nivolumab is supplied by [CONTACT_414] -Myers Squibb and distribu ted by [CONTACT_124438], CTEP/DCTD/NCI as 100 mg vials (10 mg/mL) with 
a 0.7mL overfill.  It is supplied in 10 mL type I flint glass vials, with fluoropolymer film -
laminated  rubber stoppers and aluminum seals.  
 
Preparation:   Nivolumab injection can be infused  undiluted (10 mg/mL) or diluted with 
0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.  When the dose is based on patient weight (i.e., 
mg/kg), nivolumab injection can be infused undiluted or diluted to  a final  concentration  of 
1-10mg/ml s. When the dose is fixed (eg, 240 mg, 360 mg, or 480 mg flat dose), nivolumab 
injection can be infused undiluted or diluted so as not to exceed a total infusion volume of 
160 mL.  For patients weighing less than 40 kilograms (kg), the total volume of infusion 
must not exceed [ADDRESS_139879] preparation and 
handling, vigorous mixing or shaking is to be avoided.  
 
Nivolumab infusions are compatible with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyolefin containers 
and infusion sets, and glass bottles.  
 
Storage:   Vials of Nivolumab injection must be stored at 2° - 8°C (36° - 46°F) and protected 
from light and freezing.   The unopened vials can be stored at room temperature (up to 25°C,

If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return Nivolumab to 2°C -8°C and 
quarantine the supplies.  Provide a detailed report of the excursion (including documentation 
of temperature monitoring and duration of the excursion) to PMBAfterHou [EMAIL_2470]  
for determination of suitability.  
 
Stability:   Shelf -life surveillance of the intact vials is ongoing.  
 
The administration of undiluted and diluted solutions of Nivolumab must be completed 
within 24 hours of preparation.  If not used immediately, the infusion solution may be stored 
up to 24 hours in a refrigerator at 2° -8°C (36° -46°F) and a maximum of 8 hour s of the total 
24 hours can be at room temperature (20° -25°C, 68° -77°F) and room light.  The maximum

administration period.  
 
CAUTION:   The single -use dosage form contains no antibacterial preservative or 
bacteriostatic agent.  Therefore, it is advised that the product be discarded 8 hours after 
initial entry.  
 
Route of Administration:    Intravenous infusion over 30 minutes.  Nivolumab can be 
safely infused over 30 minutes in subjects with cancer.  Do not administer as an IV push or 
bolus injection.  
 
Method of Administration:   Administer through a 0.2 micron to 1.2 micron pore size, 
low-protein binding (polyethersulfone membrane) in -line filter.  
 
Potential Drug Interactions:  The indirect drug -drug interaction potential of nivolumab 
was assessed using systemic cytokine modulation data for cytokines known to modulate 
CYP enzymes.   There were no meaningful changes in cytokines known to have indirect 
effects on CYP enzymes across all dose levels of nivolumab. This lack of cytokine 
modulation suggests that nivolumab has no or low potential for modulating CYP enzymes, 
thereby [CONTACT_124439] a low risk of therapeutic protein -drug interaction.  
 
Patient Care Implications:  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) receiving 
nivolumab must continue contraception for a period of [ADDRESS_139881] dose of nivolumab.

9.2    Integrated Correlative Studies
NCI Protocol #:  [ZIP_CODE]  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Protocol Version Date:    July 13,, 2021   
69 9.2.1 Lymph3Cx Cell -of-Origin (COO) molecular subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_124365] – Integrated Laboratory 
Correlative Study #1  (See Appendix G for more details ).  
 
The “Lymph3Cx” assay provides molecular Cell -of-Origin (COO) subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_124393] B cell 
lymphomas into Germinal Center B cell (GCB), Activated B Cell (ABC), Unclassifiable (UNC), 
and Primary Mediastinal B Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) types, which have different bi ological 
features such as genomic alterations, gene expression and mutation profiles, signal pathway 
activation, and prognosis. We hypothesize that, as an integrated biomarker, the Lymph3Cx assay 
will identify those patients in this trial who benefited fro m the addition of Copanlisib in 
combination with Nivolumab.   
 
PMBCL is recognized as a distinct lymphoma entity in the current World Health Organization 
classification. However, the diagnosis relies on integration of clinical characteristics at time of 
presentation since reliable distinction from DLBCL solely based o n morphological or 
immunophenotypic features can be difficult and non -reproducible. Gene expression profiling 
(GEP) studies provide evidence that PMBCL can be distinguished from DLBCL on a molecular 
level and support a strong relationship between PMBCL and  classical Hodgkin lymphoma 
(Rosenwald et al., J Exp Med 2003; Savage et al., Blood 2003). Because these studies were 
performed using snap -frozen tissue specimens, the molecular classification of PMBCL has not 
penetrated into clinical practice. The Lymphom a and Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project 
research consortium (LLMPP), of which [CONTACT_60897]  ([EMAIL_2471] ) is the current 
Principal Investigator, recently developed a robust and accurate molecular assay for the 
distinction of PMBCL from DLBCL using GEP techniques applicable to routinely available 
formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded tissue (FFPE) biopsies.  
 
The Lymph3Cx assay that will be used in this clinical trial is builds upon the well -established 
Lymph2Cx assay with the addition of a gene expression “module” that specifically identifies 
PMBCL in additio n to the DLBCL subtypes (ABC, GCB, UNC).  The Lymph3Cx assay is run 
on the same platform as Lymph2Cx, the nCounter system by [CONTACT_124442]. The Lymph2Cx assay 
is now going through commercial development to become an FDA -cleared test. The Lymph2Cx 
is the only DLBCL cell -of-origin assay at such an advanced stage  of development, indicating the 
quality of the assays by [CONTACT_124443].  
For Lymph3Cx assay development, all cases used were centrally reviewed by a panel of expert 
hematopathologists in the LLMPP. Gene selection was performed using data previously 
generated on Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 microarrays and the NanoString platform. T he training 
cohort for the new Lymph3Cx assay consisted of 68 cases (48 DLBCL and 20 PMBCL), and the 
independent validation cohort was comprised of 88 PMBCL and 78 DLBCL (42 GCB, 26 ABC, 
10 unclassified). Cases were required to have a tumor content of > 60 % (after macrodissection) 
and nucleic acids were extracted from 10 µm FFPE scrolls. Digital gene expression was 
performed using 200 ng RNA and the NanoString technology (Seattle, WA). Fresh versus 14 day 
old unstained tissue sections, at ambient temperature, were compared and yielded the same 
results on 5 samples indicatin g a 2 week time lag between cutting the samples and initiating 
testing is acceptable. Reproducibility between 2 different technical staff members, pathologists, 
and instruments was 100% fo r 9 samples repeated 2 weeks apart. Precision was assessed by 
[CONTACT_124444] 5 cases on 3 different occasions, with 100% concordance. Dilution studies 
demonstrated that 100ng was the minimal reliable input for the assay. Potentially interfering 
NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Version Date: July 13 , 2021  
 
70 substances, including all reagents used in the assay, were tested and demonstrated no 
interference. The final Lymph3Cx gene set consisted of 64 probes and included the previously 
described 20 genes of the Lymph2Cx assay. A classifier score was then modeled  to account for 
error probabilities of the pathological classification and cut -points were defined at the 0.1 and 0.9 
probability scores. The model, including coefficients and thresholds was then “locked” and 
applied to the independent validation cohort. T he assay yielded gene expression data of sufficient 
quality in 157/166 cases (94.6 %). Among the pathologically -defined PMBCL, 85% were also 
classified as such based on the molecular signature. Ten percent were allocated in the 
“uncertain” category and 5% of cases showed a molecular signature [CONTACT_124471]. Among the 
pathologically -defined DLBCL cases, 83% were classified as DLBCL by [CONTACT_124445], 14% were 
“uncertain” and 3% were predicted to be PMBCL based on GEP. The newly developed and 
validated Lymph3Cx assay c learly distinguishes PMBCL and DLBCL based on gene expression 
signatures and shows high concordance with the pathological classification of an expert 
hematopathologist panel.  
 
An important pre -analytical variable is percentage of tumor, which should be a minimum of 60% 
based on a second dilution study demonstrating that 60% and 50% gave reliable results, but that 
40%, 30%, and 20% did not. To be conservative, 60% was chosen to a llow for slight variability 
in tumor content estimates and successive cuts off of the block. To address the tumor percent, an 
H&E stained section of each case will be assessed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Rimsza, who will estimate tumor 
purity. If needed, macro -dissection of th e tissue sections will be performed to increase tumor 
content. Optimal input is [ADDRESS_139887]. Rimsza will measure the size of the tumor area 
and determi ne the number of needed sections at the same time that she determines the tumor 
content. A Pathology Quality Assurance form is used to document the tissue input specifics 
(size/number of needed sections and percent tumor). At this time, only formalin fixed  biopsies 
(not other fixatives) have been assessed. The Pathology reports on the biopsies will be reviewed 
to determine whether formalin or another fixative was used. The average raw count of the 
housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_124394] a final quality c ontrol marker – samples with <20 
counts for this metric are reported as “Poor Quality”. The materials for this study will be 
analyzed in the exact same manner as the samples in the clinical laboratory that are tested for 
medical care. A positive and negati ve control and up to ten samples can be included in each 12 -
well cassette. Positive control is an equimolar mixture of oligonucleotides which hybridizes with 
all probes in the assay. This will be lyophilized, reconstituted into stock solutions, and pooled by 
[CONTACT_3455]. The negative control is a well in the cassette that includes all reagents and 
probes, but no RNA.  Importantly, there is a 100% concordance of [ADDRESS_139888] standardized operating procedures, controls, and a 
completely locked algorithm. Scoring is not applicable in this assay.

9.3 Exploratory/Ancillary Correlative Studies  
Unless otherwise indicated, we will follow the same steps for all correlative studies in terms of 
collection, handling and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_124395] 9 .3.2 and 9. 3.3. 
 
 
9.3.1 Background and Methodology  
We propose to obtain tumor tissue, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum for biomarker 
and correlative studies :  
• To characterize the effects of the copanlisib  and nivolumab combination regimen on 
tumor cells, tumor microenvironment and the immune response in relapsed/refractory 
DLBCL and PMBCL  
• To assess predictors of response of the combination in relapsed/refractory DLBCL and 
PMBCL . 
 
We will use the PD1/PD -L1 expression, gene amplification, number and location of immune 
cells, genetic mutations in the tumor, peripheral cell subtypes and activation status, as well as 
cytokine profile to develop an immune signature [CONTACT_124472] h response to PD -1 
blockade in combination with copanlisib.  
 
Blood/blood product/Tissue samples will be collected for the following research :  
1.  Identification of intratumoral immune cells by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC). To assess 
whether the location or num ber of intratumoral immune cells predicts response to therapy, serial

73 5-μm paraffin -embedded sections will be deparaffinized and endogenous peroxidase quenched 
by [CONTACT_124448] 50% methanol/H2O2.  All sections will be pretreated with 50 mmol/L EDTA 
and staining will be done automatically on DAKO Autostainer using antibodies to CD11c (Leica 
Microsystems 5D11), CD14 (Cell Marque EPR 3653), CD163 (DAKO 1F8), CD68 (DAKO PG -
M1), CXCL13 (R&D Systems [ZIP_CODE]), FOXP3 (Abcam 236AE/7), CD3 (R&D Systems), PD -L1 
(405.9A11), PD -L2 (366C.9E5) and PD -1 (Abcam NAT). Sections will be viewed wit h an 
Olympus BXFA51 microscope and photos taken with an Olympus DP71 camera.  
 
2.  Determine whether genetic amplification or copy number gain resulting in PD -L1/2 is 
associated with resp onse to therapy in our patients.  FISH will be performed to assess copy 
number on chromosome 9p24.1.  The bacterial artificial chromosome probes (CHORI; 
www.chori.org) RP11 -599H2O, which maps to 9p24.1 and includes PD -L1 (labeled with 
Spectrum Orange), and  RP11 -635N21, which also maps to 9p24.1 and includes PD -L2 (labeled 
with Spectrum Green), will be cohybridized.  A control centromeric probe, Spectr um Aqua –
labeled CEP9 (Abbott Molecular) that maps to 9p11 -q11, will be hybridized according to the 
manufacturer's recommendations.  Nuclei with a target:control probe ratio of at least 3:1 will be 
classified as amplified, those with a probe ratio of more t han 1:1 but less than 3:1 will be 
classified as relative copy gain, and those with a probe ratio of 1:1 but with more than two copi[INVESTIGATOR_124396] 9p.  
 
3.  Serum cytokine profile. To determine whether a serum cytokine profile can be used as a 
predictive biomarker, serum specimens will be subjected to multiplex ELIS A (Invitrogen, 
Camarillo, CA) to measure 30 serum cytokines in pre -treatment and subsequent blood samples.  
Luminex -200 system version 1.7 will be used for reading plates and MasterPlex QT1.0 system 
(MiraiBio) will be used to analyze data. Cytokines will i nclude epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] (EGF), 
eotaxin, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF -b), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating 
factor (GM -CSF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), IFN -α, IFN -ϒ, interleukin [ADDRESS_139891] (IL -1RA), IL -1β,IL-2, IL -2R , IL -4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10,12,13,15,17, Inducible protein -10

(MIG/CXCL9), MIP -1α (CCL3), MIP1β ( CCL4), regulated on activation normal T -cell 
expressed and secreted (RANTES),TNF -α and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). 
Internal control serum will be included in all assays to control for interassay variation.  
 
4.  Changes in T -cell subsets by f low cytometry. To define changes in peripheral blood cell 
populations after treatment, peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be stained with 
fluorochrome -conjugated antibodies to human CD69 (R&D Systems), CD3 (clone HIT3a), 
CD19 (clone 4G7), PD1 (clone E H12.1), CD14 (clone M5E2), CD163 (clone GH1/61), CD21 
(clone B -ly4), PD -L2 (clone M1H18), PD -L1 (clone M1H1), TIM3 (clone 344823), and CD23 
(clone EBVCS -5; all obtained from BD Biosciences) and the data will be analyzed us ing 
CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).  
 
5.  Sequencing to determine mutational burden. To determine whether increased numbers of 
mutations correspond to increased responses to therapy, genomic DNA will be extracted from 
formalin -fixed, paraffin - embedded tissue blocks for mutational an alysis. DNA will be extracted 
using the Qiagen FFPE DNA extraction kit. DNA quantitation will be performed using a Qubit 
fluorometer prior to sequencing. Whole -exome capture libraries constructed via the Agilent 
NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Version Date: July [ADDRESS_139892] in -solution hybrid 
selection process will be used. Enriched exome libraries will be sequenced on the HiSeq 2000 
platform (Illumina) to generate paired -end reads (2x76bp) to a goal of 150X m ean target 
coverage (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA). Targeted resequencing using a custom panel of 376 
loci to a target coverage of 500X will be performed usin g Ampliseq (Life Technologies).  
 
6.  Screening for PTEN Loss. The following methods were developed  and validated using 
standard approaches for clinical test validation, in line with CLIA provisions and CAP 
requirements  at MDACC  (in collaboration with [CONTACT_124476]) clinical IHC laboratory, which 
is certified under the provisions of the [LOCATION_002] Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act 
(CLIA)  and accredited by [CONTACT_9891] (CAP). This laboratory is also 
the central laboratory for the PTEN immunohistochemical study for the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) trial.   The anti -human PTEN antibody 
clone 6H2.1 (isotype IgG2a, kappa) is manufactured by [CONTACT_124449] (FDA) for in vitro diagnostic use (IVD).  Per  Dako, the immunogen 
against which the antibody is produced is the f ull-length recombinant human PTEN protein.   
This is a monoclonal mouse anti -PTEN clone 6H2.1 which identifies a single band at the 55 kD -
predicted molecular weig ht for PTEN in western blots of MCF -7, T-47D and MDA -MB-435S 
PTEN -homozygous cell lines. PTEN -null cell lines BT -549 and MDA -MB-468 were unreactive 
with clone 6H2.1 by [CONTACT_124450]. Immunoblots of MCF -7 cells induced to express 
PTEN demonstrated a n increased band intensity at the expected size, while a weak band was 
observed on immunoblots of ZR -75-1 cell lysates containing a hemizygous deletion of PTEN 
and a missense mutation in the remaining allele. Immunohistochemical staining of sections from 
FFPE blocks of Ishikawa 3 -H-12 cells transfected with PTEN stained positively, whereas PTEN -
deficient 3 -H-12 cell block sections were unreactive. The anti -PTEN antibody is provided in 
liquid form as a tissue culture supernatant (containing fetal bovine seru m) at a concentration of 
222.4 mg/L dialyzed against 0.05 mol/L Tris -HCl, pH 7.2, and 0.015 mol/L sodium azide, and 
containing stabilizing protein.  
 
This antibody can be used to perform IHC on formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissue 
sections  and has been in use since 2010. The final protocol is validated for use on 4 um FFPE 
tissue sections. In brief, following deparaffinization and rehydration of the tissues sections, 
antigen retrieval is performed at 100 °C for 20 minutes with Tris -EDTA buffer, pH 6.0.  
Endogenous peroxida se is blocked with 3% peroxide for 5 minutes. Primary PTEN antibody 
(Dako, clone 6H2.1) is applied at 1:100 dilution.  Prima ry antibody detection is carried out using 
a commercial polymer system (Bond Polymer Refine Detection, Leica), and staining 
development is achieved by [CONTACT_124451] (Leica)  
 
A positive and negative control is added to every IHC run (batch control) and is reviewed by a 
member of the IHC medical directorship team. Records of batch control results are documented 
daily in internal laboratory records.  
 
Correlatives ( 1 to 6) will be done at Stephen Ansell’s laboratory (Chair of lymphoma disease 
oriented group). [CONTACT_124477] has extensively studied the effects of immunotherapy on the tumor 
and tumor microenvironment and has published several papers in the topic. These corr elatives 
will be exploratory.

Lugano Classification Response Criteria  
 
11.1.1  Response Considerations  
 
 Definitions for clinical response for patients with lymphoma are based on the 
lymphoma response to immunomodulatory therapy criteri a or LYRIC. (Cheson et 
al. 2016)   Lymph node measurements should be taken from the CT port ion of the 
PET/CT, or other dedicated CT scans where applicable.  Measurement of 
lymphadenopathy for purposes of assessing for PR will be determined by [CONTACT_124453] (SPD). The per pendicular diameter of a single node is sufficient to 
evaluate for PD (see Table 11.1. 2).  Measurable extranodal disease should be 
assessed in a manner similar to that for nodal disease.  For these 
recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disease. D isease that is only 
assessable (e.g., pleural effusions, bone lesions) will be recorded as present or 
absent only, unless, while an abnormality is still noted by [CONTACT_124454], it is found to be histologically and pathologically n egative.  
 
 For response assessment, PET -CT is preferred for staging of FDG -avid 
lymphomas and CT scan is preferred in the other lymphomas  
 
   Progressive disease is based on either PET -CT based (PMD) or CT based (PD) 
response criteria.  Definition of progressive disease according to LYRIC is same 
as the Lugano classification except that a new category of indeterminate response 
(IR) is added. Patients whose disease fall in the IR category may continue 
treatment for additional 12 weeks if the patient remains clinically stable as judged 
by [CONTACT_1963]. A repeat imaging study  in 12 weeks (or earlier if 
clinically indicated) is mandator y to confirm or refute disease progression.  PET 
confirmation of progressive disease is per physician discretion.

a.   A score of [ADDRESS_139910] treatment, especially if at 
the time of an interim scan. However, in trials involving PET where de -escalation is 
investigated, it may be preferable to consider a score of 3 as inad equate response (to avoid under 
treatment). Measured dominant lesions: Up to six of the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, 
and extranodal lesions selected to be clearly measurable in two diameters. Nodes should 
preferably be from disparate regions of th e body and should include, where applicable, 
mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas. Non -nodal lesions include those in solid organs ( e.g., liver, 
spleen, kidneys, and lungs), GI involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on palpation. 
Non-measured lesions: Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease and truly 
assessable disease should be considered not measured. These sites i nclude any nodes, nodal 
masses, and extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the 
requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable 
disease, which is any site of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantitatively 
with measurement, including pleural effusions, ascites, bone lesions , leptomeningeal disease, 
abdominal masses, and other lesions that cannot be confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_9661]. In 
Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal sites ( e.g.,, GI tract, liver, bone marrow), FDG uptake may be 
greater than in the mediastinum with complete  metabolic response, but should be no higher than 
surrounding normal physiologic uptake ( e.g., with marrow activation as a result of chemotherapy 
or myeloid growth factors).

89 13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
13.1 Study Design /Endpoints : 
 
13.1.1  Overview  
This is a parallel phase II study of Nivolumab and Copanlisib in patients with 
relapsed/refractory diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary mediastinal 
large B -cell lymphoma (PMBCL). It is designed using two separate a one -stage designs 
with an in terim analyses based on the Simon optimal design to assess efficacy (ORR 
(CR+PR)).   
 
13.1.2  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the proportion of objective responses (either a CR or PR 
according to Lugano criteria). Throughout Section 1 3.0, CR or PR will be considered 
synonymous with “success”, unless specified otherwise. All patients meeting the 
eligibility crite ria who have signed a consent form and have begun treatment will be 
evaluable for response.  
 
 DLBCL and PMBCL will be analyzed  and reported separately.  
 
13.1.3  Statistical Design  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Decision Rules are based upon prior response rates reported in section s 2.2.[ADDRESS_139919] response rates similar to those 
presented.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Cohort  
This treatment regimen has been explored in previous studies but study results have 
not been reported, thus, it has been determined that a safety cohort is necessary to 
confirm the copanlisib dose.  
 
[ADDRESS_139920] been evaluated for adverse events in 1 cycle.  If 1 or 0 of 6 patients experience a 
DLT as defined in section [IP_ADDRESS] , the study will open enrollment to accrue the rest of 
the patients.  If [ADDRESS_139921] been evaluated for adverse 
events in 1 cycle.  If 1 or 0 of 6 patients experience a DLT as defined in 
section [IP_ADDRESS] , the study will open enrollment to accrue the rest of the patients.  If no 
DLTs are observed at dose level 1, the study will open to complete accrual. If 1 or 
less patients experience DLTs at dose level -1, the study will open to complete 
accrual.  If 1 or less patients experience DLTs at dose level 1, the study will ope n to 
complete accrual.  
NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Version Date: July [ADDRESS_139922] on all three lymphoma 
subtypes.   The 6 patients accrued at the acceptable dose will be included in the 
primary analysis.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] DLBCL: The largest success proportion where the proposed treatment 
regimen would be considered ineffective in DLBCL is 25%, and the smallest success 
proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this 
patient population is 45 %. This design uses [ADDRESS_139923] 25%.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Interim Analysis: Enter [ADDRESS_139924] 4, we will continue 
accrual.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Final Decision Rule: If [ADDRESS_139925] 44 evaluable patients, we 
may recommend further testing of this regimen in subsequent studies in this 
population.  
 
13.1.3..3.3  Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_124406]. Analyses involving over accrued patients are discussed in 
Section 16.3 .4. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].4  NOTE: We will not suspend accrual at the interim analysis to allow the 
first 14 patients to become evaluable, unless undue toxicity is observed. Given the 
limited overall sample size and the inclusion of an adverse events stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], we 
feel it is ethic al to not halt accrual for the interim analysis. However, if accrual is 
extremely rapid, we may temporarily suspend accrual in order to obtain safety and 
efficacy data on these patients before re -opening accrual to further patients.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] PMBCL: The largest success proportion where the proposed treatment 
regimen would be considered ineffective in PMBCL is 30%, and the smallest success 
proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this 
patient population is 50 %. This design uses [ADDRESS_139926] 30%.

91 [IP_ADDRESS].1 Interim Analysis: Enter [ADDRESS_139927] 8, we will continue accrual.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Final Decision Rule: If [ADDRESS_139928] 46 evaluable patients, we 
may recommend f urther testing of this regimen in subsequent studies in this 
population.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_124406]. Analyses involving over accrued patients are discussed in 
Section 16.3 .4. 
13.1.3. 4.4 NOTE: We will not suspend accrual at the interim analysis to allow the first 22 
patients to become evaluable, unless undue toxicity is observed. Given the limited overall sample 
size and the inclusion of an adverse events stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], we feel it is ethic al to not halt accrual 
for the interim analysis. However, if accrual is extremely rapid, we may  temporarily suspend 
accrual in order to obtain safety and efficacy data on these patients before re -opening accrual to 
further patients.  
 
 
13.2 Sample Size /Accrual Rate   
 
13.2.1  This study is expected to require a minimum of 42 (6 safety cohort, 14 DLBCL and 22 
PMBCL) and a maximum of 96 (6 safety cohort, 44 DLBCL and 46 PMBCL) evaluable 
patients. We anticipate accruing 10 (10%) additional patients to account for ineligibility, 
cancellation, or other reasons. Therefore, the study is expected to accrue a maximum of 
106 patients overall.  
 
13.2.2  Accrual Rate and Study Duration:  The anticipated accrual rate for the safety cohort is 2 -
3 months.  The anticipated accrual rate is 3-5 patients per month for the DLBCL cohort 
and 1 -2 patients per month for the PMBCL group.  Therefore,  after assessing safety,  the 
accrual period is expected to be 11 months  for the DLBCL cohort, with the primary 
endpoint evaluated at approximately 17 months  after the trial opens (or after the last 
patient accrued has been observed for at least 6 months and data collection fo r the 
induction phase is complete). The accrual period is expected to be [ADDRESS_139929] completed all cycles of treatment.

92 13.2.3  Power and Significance Level: Assuming that the number of successes is binomially 
distributed, the significance level is .10, i.e. there is a 10% chance of finding the drug to 
be effective when it truly is not. The probability of declaring that this regime n warrants 
further study (i.e. statistical power) under various success proportions and the probability 
of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_124407] a function of the true 
success proportion.  
 
For DLBCL:  
 
If the true success proportion is...  0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 
Then the probability of declaring 
that the regimen warrants further 
study is…  0.097  0.286  0.543  0.766  0.901  
and the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_124408] …  0.521  0.355  0.221  0.124  0.063  
 
 
  For PMBCL:  
 
If the true success proportion is...  0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 
Then the probability of declaring 
that the regimen warrants further 
study is…  0.097  0.279  0.532  0.762  0.905  
and the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_124408] …  0.671  0.474  0.290  0.152  0.067  
 
 
13.2.4  Other considerations: Adverse events, quality/duration of response, and patterns of 
treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific discoveries or changes in 
stand ard care will be taken into account in any dec ision to terminate the study.

13.5 Evaluation of Response  
 
13.5.1  Primary Outcome Analyses:  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  The proportion of successes will be estimated by [CONTACT_124462]. Confidence intervals for the true success 
proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner (Duffy 
D 1987) . 
 
NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Version Date: July 13 , 2021  
 
94 13.5.2  Secondary Outcome Analyses: These analyses will include all patients meeting the 
eligibility crite ria who have signed a consent form and have begun treatment, including 
patients who fail to achieve a complete or partial response.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events: All eligible patients that have initiated treatment will be considered 
evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s). The maximum grade for each type of 
adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed 
to determine patterns. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the 
study treatment will be taken into consideration.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Progression free survival time is defined for all evaluable patients as the time from 
registration to relapse or death due to any cause. Patients are censored if they have not 
achieved progression at the time of analysis.  The distribution of progression -free 
survival will be estimated using the method of Kaplan -Meier. In addition, the 
progression -free survival rate at 5 years after registration will be reported.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Duration of response is defined for all evaluable patients who have achieved a CR or 
PR as the date at which the patient’s objective status is first noted to be a CR or PR to 
the earliest date relapse is documented. The distribution of duration of complete  
response will be estimated using the method of Kaplan -Meier . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overall survival time is defined as the time from registration to death due to any 
cause. Patients are censored if they are alive at the time of analysis.  The distribution 
of survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan -Meier  (Kaplan and 
Meier 1958) .  
 
13.5.3  Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the additional 
patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_124409] s; however, they will be included in final endpoint estimates and confidence 
intervals.  
 
13.6 Evaluation of Toxicity : 
 
13.6.1  The study statistician will review the study weekly to monitor accrual, endpoints and 
adverse events. The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) is responsible for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial at least twic e a 
year, based on reports provided by [CONTACT_31959].  
 
13.6.2  Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]: The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_124410]. We note that the Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_124411] (1) the study re -opening to accrual or (2) at 
any time during the conduct of the trial and in consideration of newly acquired 
information regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation. 
The study team may choose to suspend accrual beca use of unexpected adverse event 
profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below.  
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we

We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed 
“unrelated” or “unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to 
monitor the emergence of a previously unrecognized treatment -related 
adverse event.  
 
13.7 Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov:  
At study activation, this study will have been registered within the 
“ClincialTrails.gov” website. The Primary and Secondary Endpoints along with 
other required information for this study will be reported on ClinicalTrials.gov. 
For purposes of timing of th e Results Reporting, the initial estimated completion 
date for the Primary Endpoint of this study is 5.5 years after the study opens to 
accrual. The definition of “Primary Endpoint Completion Date” (PECD) for this 
study is at the time the last patient regi stered has been followed for at least 2 
months.

>250mg/dL  • Hydration status should be 
clinically assessed.  
• If clinical assessment is 
consistent with dehydration, 
fluids should be given as 
clinically appropriate (orally or 
IV). 
• Laboratory test confirming 
increase should be repeated. If 
the repeated glucose value is 
persistent and/or patient is 
symptomatic and/or the hydration 
status indicates the need for 
hydration, glucose lowering 
medication should be 
administered.  
• Prompt input from a diabetes 
specialist should be obtained.  • Hydration if appropriate  
• Rapid/ short acting insulin 
may be given for glucose 
persisting at >250 mg/dL, or

Please submit a response to each of the criteria below and complete one Study Checklist  for 
each Biomarker endpoint.  
1. Name [CONTACT_124473]: Lymph3Cx Cell -of-Origin (COO) molecular subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_124417] B cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) and Diffuse Large B Cell 
Lymphoma (DLBCL) subtypes  
2. For an integral or integrated assay, indicate the role(s) of the biomarker assay in the trial:  
A. Eligibility criterion  
B. Assignment to treatment  
C. Stratification variable  
D. Risk classifier or score  
E. Other (describe in detail): This assay provides molecular cell -of-origin (COO) 
subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_124418], not PMBCL, and uncertain; and DLBCL, with DLBCL 
further divided into Activated B cell, Germinal Center B cell, and Unclassifiable 
subtypes. These tumor types have different biological f eatures such as gene 
expression, mutation profiles, signal pathway activation, and prognosis.  
Retrospectively, after closure of the trial, the Lymph3Cx results will be analyzed 
with regard to patient response to the novel chemo therapy regimen. The assay 
was developed by [CONTACT_124465] (LLMPP), of which [CONTACT_60897] is the current Principal 
Investigator.   
3. Identify the specific individual(s) and laboratory(ies) who are being considered for 
conducting the assay(s) for the trial.  Performing lab: Molecular Diagnostics – Arizona 
Laboratory, Mayo Clinic Arizona; Medical Director: [CONTACT_124475]; Performing

NCI Protocol #:[ZIP_CODE]  
Local Protocol #:  MC1787  
Version Date: July [ADDRESS_139950] cancer 
assay.  The RNA extraction kits are commercially available from [COMPANY_002].  The 64 
fluorescently -labeled tags used in the assay will be from NanoString. The 
positive control is an eq uimolar mixture of oligonucleotides with complimentary 
sequences to all probes in Lymph3Cx assay. The oligonucleotides will be 
purchased in bulk, lyophilized, reconstituted into stock solutions, and pre -mixed 
by [CONTACT_124466] p rior work with the Lymph2Cx 
assay (D. Scott et al, Blood  2014).  We have a standard operating procedure for 
storage and dilution of this calibration standard, which has been used for 
normalization in all subsequent studies including the proposed trial. Additional 
PMBCL cell line pellets will be included as posi tive controls for the Lymph3Cx 
as well. The analysis algorithm is held behind a firewall on a password 
protected, NCI -sponsored website, so as to prevent any “drift” or tweaking.  
 
B. Describe the specimens, and anticipated methods for specimen acquisition, fixation or 
stabilization, and processing.  Provide justification for the timing of specimen 
collection. Describe the scoring procedures and type of data to be acquired:  
• quantitative/continuously distributed  
• semi -quantitative/ordered categorical  
• qualitative/non -ordered categorical  
 
The specimens will be formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections 
from the diagnostic pre -treatment biopsies of the patients, processed under 
standard clinical protocols at each participating site. Quantitative digital data 
will be generated f rom the nCounter system then uploaded to an NCI sponsored 
website with the analysis algorithm, which will calculate a probability score and 
assign the results into PMBCL, not PMBCL, or uncertain, and then 3 
DLBCL/not PMBCL categories: DLBCL -ABC, DLBCL -GCB,  or DLBCL -UNC.  
The average raw count of the housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_124394] a final 
quality control marker – samples with < 80 counts for this metric are reported as 
“Poor Quality”.  
A. Provide data on the analytical performance of the assay. -For in vitro  tests, describe 
the current status of studies defining the accuracy, precision, reportable range, 
reference ranges/intervals (normal values), turn -around time and failure rate of the

2017, manuscript under preparation  for submission). The assay yielded GEP 
data of sufficient quality in 157/166 cases (94.6%).  The Rimsza laboratory 
provided the intra - and inter -laboratory reproducibility data for the Lymph3Cx

114 assay, which was 100% for repeat samples within the same laboratory and 
between laboratories respectively. The laboratory turn -around time for the 
assay is 2.[ADDRESS_139951] 119 cases was 0% (all biopsies yielded 
sufficient RNA when assessed for pre -analyti cal variables as described below) 
using standard chemistry. A positive and negative control and up to ten samples 
can be included in each 12 -well cassette.  Positive controls include the mixture of 
oligonucleotides and cell lines which hybridize with all p robes in the assay.  The 
negative control is a well in the cassette that includes all reagents and probes, 
but no RNA. An important pre -analytical variable is percentage of tumor, which 
should be a minimum of 60%.  To address this, an H&E stained section o f each 
case will be assessed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Rimsza, who will estimate tumor purity.  If needed, 
macro -dissection of the tissue sections will be performed to increase tumor 
content.  Input is [ADDRESS_139952]. Rimsza will measure the 
size of the tumor area and determined the number of needed sections at the same 
time that she determines the tumor content. A Pathology Quality Assuranc e 
form is used to document the tis sue input specifics (size/number of needed 
sections and percent tumor). At this time, only formalin fixed biopsies (not other 
fixatives) have been assessed.  The Pathology reports on the biopsies will be 
reviewed to determine whether formalin or another fi xative was used. A 
complete validation packet for the Lymph2Cx assay as a laboratory developed 
test in the clinical Molecular Diagnostics in Arizona Laboratory at the Mayo 
Clinic was completed in November [ADDRESS_139953] and estimated 
for completion in late 2018. Although not for use in clinical decision making in 
this proposed trial, the Lymph3Cx assay will be run using the same standardized 
operating procedures as in the Mayo clinical laboratory. CLIA lab identification 
number 03D2113087.  
 
 
B. If the assay will be performed at more than one site, describe how inter -laboratory 
variability in the measurements listed in 5A above will be assessed. Describe how 
these sources of variation will be minimized to maintain performance at all sites 
within a cceptable limits and to prevent drift or bias in assay. Not applicable, all 
testing will be performed at one site.   
 
6. Provide data on the clinical utility of the integral/integrated assay as it will be used in the 
trial:  
A. Provide background information that justifies the use of this assay result as a marker 
for this trial. State the hypothesis and rationale for utilizing the biomarker, with 
supporting preclinical and clinical data, when available.  For example, if the integ ral 
marker will be used as a stratification or treatment -determining variable, data

115 supporting its prognostic or predictive association with a main trial endpoint should 
be described or referenced.  
 Note:   If the trial objectives include an evaluation of the association of the 
integral marker with a new clinical endpoint or factor not previously studied, 
explain how the magnitude of the association or effect will be measured and 
provide power calculations for any statistical tests that are planned.  
  
The Lymph3Cx assigns the molecular COO subtype of cases of large cell 
lymphomas into PMBCL and DLBCL subtypes with different phenotypes 
and genotypes.  Meaningful analysis of any clinical trial results need to be 
correlated with COO status in order to accu rately describe the enrolled 
cohort of patients. Diagnosis of PMBCL is difficult, non -reproducible, and 
relies heavily on clinical presentation in the mediastinum, however, our 
research consortium recently described PMBCL -like tumors outside of the 
mediast inum, and conversely, not every case of large B cell lymphoma 
occurring in the mediastinum is a PMBCL, but could also be a usual DLBCL 
that happens to present there. (A. Rosenwald et al, J Exp Med , 2003; J. Yuan 
et al, Am J Surg Path ,  2015). Several assays for COO have been published in 
the literature.  The original methods used snap frozen tissues and the 
Affymetrix gene expression profiling system, which are now accepted by 
[CONTACT_124467] a “gold standard” for COO classification of DLB CL and PMBCL 
respective ly (G. Wright et al, PNAS  2003; A. Rosenwald J Exp Med  2003); 
but both are expensive, have a poor turn -around time, and the Affymetrix 
platform does not perform well with FFPE tissue input.  The LLMPP 
research consortium, beginning with the original “discovery” methods, 
developed a GEP method that is accurate  and useful in FFPE tissues.  
 
B. Describe the expected distribution of the biomarker in the study population.  Justify 
the number of patients and specimens to determine feasibility and to demonstrate that 
the studies are likely to produce interpretable results.  
As per the prior LLMPP publication using GEP on frozen tissues, we expect that 
80% of patients with an initial diagnosis of PMBCL will classify as PMBCL 
using the molecular method with the rest being DLBCL (A. Rosenwald et al, J 
Exp Med, 2003). As per our prior publications we further expect that the 
DLBCL will subtype as approximately 50% GCB, 35% ABC, and 15% UNC (S. 
Kendrick et al, Leuk Lymph 2016). The response rates will be compared to GEP 
classification to determine whether there is a specific subtype  that correlates 
with treatment response. Given that this is a phase II study, descriptive statistics 
will be used to explore these COO and treatment associations.  
 
C. If cutpoints will be used, specify the cutpoint(s) and describe how these will be used 
in the trial.  Provide the rationale for the cutpoint(s) selected.  What proportion of 
subjects is expected to have values above and below the proposed assay value 
cutpo ints?  What magnitude of effect (e.g., treatment benefit) or outcome (e.g., 
prognosis) is expected for patients with assay results above and below the proposed 
cutpoint(s)?

116 The cut -points for classification are pre -set at a  probability score  of 10% and 
90%  as generated from the locked Lymph3Cx algorithm, which was previously 
trained and validated. The results are first classified into PMBCL or not -
PMBCL or an uncertain category.  Then the non -PMBCL cases (DLBCL) are 
further classified into one of 3 subtypes  such that DLBCL -ABC (equal to or 
greater than 90% probability score), germinal center B cell subtype (less than or 
equal to 10% probability of being an ABC type), and uncl assifiable category (for 
all probabilities between 10 -90%). It is expected that 60 -70% of DLBCL patients 
will have the GCB subtype of DLBCL. We do not know if there will be a 
correlation between PMBCL, DLBCL -GCB or DLBCL -ABC subtype and 
clinical outcome in  this trial. The data will be collected retrospectively for 
correlation.  
 
D. Describe the conditions under which treating physicians and or patients will be able 
to access the biomarker assay results.  
The treating physicians will not have access to these biomarker results, only the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_124420].  The patients will not have access to the results at any time.

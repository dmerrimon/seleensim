Name [CONTACT_791]: MS1819  
Protocol Number:  AZ-CF2002  
Protocol Title : A Phase 2, Open -Label, Multicenter, 2x2 Crossover Trial to assess the Safety and Efficacy 
of MS1819 in Enteric Capsules  in Patient s with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency due to Cystic Fibrosis ; 
with an Extension Phase Evaluation of Immediate Release MS1819 Capsules  
Study Name:   [CONTACT_405851] 2:  A Phase 2,  Open -Label, Multicenter, 2x2 Crossover Trial to  assess the Safety 
and Efficacy of MS 1819 in enteric capsules in  Patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency due to Cystic 
Fibrosis ; with an Extension Phase Evaluation of Immediate Release MS1819 Capsules  
Study Site(s):  This study will be conducted at approximately 15 sites in North Amer ica and  the European 
Union . 
Number of Patients:  Approximately  30 Phase of Development:  2b 
Objectives  
The primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety and efficacy of MS1819  in enteric capsules vs  
porcine pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy  (PERT) in patients  with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency 
(EPI) due to cystic fibrosis (CF).  The exploratory objective of the extension phase (EP) is to find a dose of 
MS1819 in immediate release capsules that is safe and results in CFA values in a thera peutic range.  
Study Design 
This is a Phase 2, open -label, multicenter, 2x2 crossover  study assessing the safety and efficacy of MS1819 , 
2240 mg /day vs porcine PERT, and 4480 mg /day vs porcine PERT given at the  same dose  and dosing 
regimen  that was being a dministered during the pre -study  period.  MS1819 will be administered in enteric 
capsules.  
MS1819 will be first assessed in a 2x2 crossover including approximately 30 patients  completing both 
periods . Fifteen patients will be randomized to the MS1819 2240 m g/day vs PERT arm, and 15 patients will 
be randomized to the MS1819 4480 mg/day vs PERT arm.  Patients  in each arm will further  be randomized 
to receive either the sequence consisting of MS1819  for 3 weeks follo wed by [CONTACT_405807] 3 weeks or 
the opposit e sequence of treatments, PERT for 3 weeks followed by [INVESTIGATOR_46427]1819  for another 3 weeks.  
Randomized patients  will be males or females, 18 years or older . Safety ( adverse events [ AEs], serious 
adverse events [ SAEs ], discontinuations due to adverse events , and safety laboratory values) will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_339818].  The primary efficacy endpoint is the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) that will be 
assessed at the end of the 3-week period of treatment for  each 2x2 crossover.  
Patients enrolled into the e xtension phase (EP) will be composed of patients who have completed the 
crossover phase of OPTION 2. These patients must continue to comply with the same inclusion and 
exclusion criteria as used in the cross over phase of the OPTION 2 trial  (some screening tests may need to 
be repeated and all subjects must have completed an End of Study visit in the crossover phase).  
AzurRx BioPharma, Inc.   October 30, [ADDRESS_511706], immediate release 
capsules each containing 140 mg of MS18 19, will be the same as used in a previous OPTION trial (AZ -
CF2001) of MS1819 in patients with EPI [INVESTIGATOR_220981].  
The E P will first enroll 9 patients, each receiving 4 .4 grams/day of MS1819, for two weeks.  At the end of 2 
weeks, patients will enter confineme nt for a controlled diet, stool collection and CFA measurement.  Data 
will be analy zed using descriptive statistics.  Based upon resulting CFA data,  5 additional patients may be 
enrolled at the 4.4 grams/day  dose to better characterize the CFA following en couraging results from the 
initial 9 patients.  If safety is satisfactory and the CFAs do not achieve values considered to be in the 
therapeutic range,  9 more patients will be enrolled and dosed at 6 .7 grams /day for [ADDRESS_511707] participated in the 4 .4 grams/day dose evaluation, as described above, or may be 
new patients from the OPTION 2 crossover phase . After treatment with 6 .7 grams/day for 2 weeks is 
completed,  CFAs will be measured , and data assessed as before .  Depending on CFA analysis, either another 
5 patients will be enrolled to  better characterize  encouraging initial results, or the study will be terminated. 
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_405808] 9 patient phase of 4 .4 grams/day, an d again 
after the initial 9 patient phase of 6 .7 grams/day, should that dose be studied.

Statistical Methods  
Statistical methods will be further detailed in the Statistical Analysis plan (SAP).  
Sample size: Based upon CFA data obtained in the recently completed Phase 2a trial ( OPTION), 15 patients  
per MS1819 dose  should provide suffic ient point estimates of CFA in each  group in the crossover phase.  
Given the acceptable safety profile obtained in the OPTION trial, a sample of 15 patients should be adequate 
for observation of safety  per dose of MS1819 . This study will use descriptive ana lyses for both safety and 
primary efficacy.   
Likewise, in t he EP, sample sizes are estimates based upon prior studies of similar design with CFA and 
safety endpoints.  
 
Analysis Sets:  
Safety Set:  Patients receiving at least one dose of treatment.  
Efficacy Sets 
• Modified Intent- to-Treat Se t (mITT) : All randomized patients  receiving at least one dose of 
treatment and have at least one valid stool collection and CFA post baseline while receiving 
their assigned study drug. The primary analysis will be performed in the mITT se t. 
• Per Protocol Set : mITT patients completing both periods and without any major protocol 
deviation. A sensitivity analysis will be performed in the Per Protocol Set.  
 Handling Missing Data:  
Missing data will not be replaced.  
 
Safety Analysi s:   
Safety (A Es, SA Es, discontinuations due to adverse events , and safety laboratory values) will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_339818].  
 
Efficacy Analysis:   
The primary efficacy endpoint is defined  as the CFA assessed at the  end of each 3 -week treatment pe riod 
(Visit 6 or Visit 9) .  CFA will be calculated as follows:  
CFA (%) = 100 ((fat intake (g) − fat excretion (g))/ fat intake (g))

AZ-CF2002   Version 3.0  Page 9 of 79 
 
Primary Analysis:  
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be a comparison of the mean CFAs from the MS1819 
treatment vs the porcine PERT treatment, using descriptive statistics.  This analysis will be conducted for 
each of the two MS1819 doses.  
An exploratory analysis of non -inferiority between the MS1819 and PERT groups will be conducted. The 
treatment effect,  along with the 95% confidence interval of the difference in CFA (MS1819 minus porcine 
PERT), will be estimated Non -inferiority will be claimed if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval 
is greater than -15%, where 15% is the non -inferiority margin.   
Subgroup analyses:  
Analyses of CFA , considering the same approach used for the primary analysis,  will be performed in the 
following subgroups:  
• by [CONTACT_405810] (<80% vs ³80%). An analysis will be done in the 
subgroup of patients  with CFA below 80% while receiving porcine PERT, as well as in the 
subgroup of patients  with CFA of 80% or greater while receiving porcine PER T.  
• By [CONTACT_405811]. 
 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints : 
Coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA) will be calculated and analyzed in the same manner as CFA.  
Stool weights,  signs and symptoms for malabsorption , body weight, BMI and lipid soluble vitamins (A, D, 
E, and K),  will be analyzed using descriptive methods.  
 
Explora tory Endpoints in Extension Phase:  
Efficacy:   CFA,  CNA, stool weight, signs and symptoms of malabsorption, body weight, and body mass 
index, will be analyzed based upon descriptive methods.  
Safety:   AEs, SA Es, discontinu ations due to adverse events , and sa fety laboratory values will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_339818].

(EPI) is defined as a deficiency of exocrine pancreatic enzymes which results in the inability 
to maintain normal digestion. The symptomatology of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405767]. Pancreatic lipase is  an enzyme that hydrolyzes triglycerides into monoglycerides 
and free fatty acids , deficiency. 
Lipid maldigestion due to lipase deficiency can lead to weight loss , steatorrhea (excess fat in 
the feces), fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies  (e.g., vitamins A, D, E, and K), and can eventually 
lead to vitamin B12 deficiency and a potential decrease in quality of life (King et al, 197 9). 
In EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405768] (CF) or chronic pancreatitis, there is also a decrease in 
bicarbonate output, causing a lower intestinal pH , which leads to precipi[INVESTIGATOR_405769]. Fat maldigestion is further exacerbated by 
[CONTACT_405813] (Struyvenberg et al, 2017).  
5.2 Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency due to Cystic Fibrosis 
Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive chronic progressive disorder with high morbidity 
and a shortened life expectancy. CF affects more than 70,000 people worldwide (Cystic 
Fibrosis Foundation). In most Caucasian populations, CF prevalence is 7-8 cases per 100,000 inhabitants but is less frequent in other populations (Farrell, 2008; Banks et al, 2010; 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry 2010). In the [LOCATION_002], there are 
approximately 30,000 affected individuals (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient 
Registry, 2016). The disease occurs as a consequence of mutations in the gene encoding for 
the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a plasma membrane ion 
channel that mediates transport of chloride, bicarbonate , and other anions. Dysfunction of 
the CFTR gene leads to a decrease in luminal fluid volume and decreased pH, resulting in 
protein precipi[INVESTIGATOR_405770]. Mutation of both alleles of CFTR results in the production of thick mucus, which causes a 
multisystem disease of the upper and lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352], the digestive syst em, and the 
reproductive tract. 
Cystic fibrosis is frequently associated with EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405771]. A neonatal screening study found that  63% of infants 
with CF were exocrine insufficient, and approximately 30% of the exocrine sufficient group 
would progressively become insufficient over the next 36 months (Waters et al, 1990). Even

individuals with less severe CFTR mutations (Class IV, V, or VI) were more likely to develop 
EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405772] (Ledder et al, 2014; Bodewes et al, 2015). 
5.[ADDRESS_511719]  of Care for the Compensation of Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency 
Porcine pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy  (PERT) is the standard of care to prevent 
maldigestion, malnutrition, and excessive weight loss  (Greenberger and Toskes 2008, 
Dhanasekaran and Toskes 2010, Greenberger and Toskes 2013). This therapy uses animal 
pancreatic extracts, which have been marketed since 1938. Porcine pancreatic extract s 
(porcine PERT) consist of an enzymatic mixture from pi g pancreas, namely amylase, 
protease, and lipase, which digest starch, protein, and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], respectively. Therapy with 
porcine PERTs has demonstrated efficacy on the maldigestion symptoms due to EPI.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_405773]-term use, major concerns have been raised by [CONTACT_405814], the CF 
community, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because of the animal ingredients 
used for porcine PERTs and the risk of transmission of conventional and nonconventional 
infectious agents. Furthermore, therapy with porcine PERTs has clear limitations: 
• The protease enzymatic constituents of porcine PERTs are suspected to cause fibrosing colonopathy (Kimura et al, 1998; Kimura et al. 1999), a severe adverse 
event (AE) observed at high doses in young patients with CF.  
• To prevent this risk of fibrosing colonopathy, the CF Foundation recommended that dosages should be limited to 500-2500 lipase units/kg/meal, ≤10,000 lipase units/kg/day, or ≤4000 lipase units/g of dietary fat/day (Stallings et al, 2008). 
Noticeably, porcine PERTs have only mild or null effects on creatorrhea (Van 
Hoozen et al, 1997, Airinei et al, 2011). 
• Incomplete correction of the lipid malab sorption, which can only be reached by 
[CONTACT_405815] 50% of patients with EPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_405774]/or pancreatectomy [Dominguez-Munoz et 
al, 2006; Safdi et al, 2006]. An internal survey based on all pub licly available 
individual data show that only 25% of patients affected by [CONTACT_405816] [INVESTIGATOR_405775] y 
normalized coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) ( i.e., CFA higher than 93%) on 
porcine PERT substitution therapy. The incomplete enzymatic activity of porcine 
PERTs in the physiochemical environment of the upper digestive tract may explain 
their reduced efficacy. A number of factors are involved, including the gastric acid pH in the range of 1 to 4; the intestinal pH ranging from 4 to 6 (porcine PERTs are 
active at pH > 6.5 in presence of biliary salts); and the protease content of the upper 
digestive tract (i.e., gastric pepsin). Due to the acid lability of pig pancreatic lipase, 
commercial enzymes are formulated as enterically coated beads. 
• The hazard of zoonotic pathogen transmission to humans remains possible with porcine PERTs because of their animal origins. For example, the porcine parvovirus may be present in these extracts, with (minimal) risk that it can cross species and 
transmit diseases to humans (Cherney, 2008).  
AzurRx BioPharma, Inc.   October 30, 2020  
AZ-CF2002   Version 3.0  Page 18 of 79 
 
• Some additional concerns identified with porcine PERT s include irritation of oral 
mucosa if chewed/retained and hyperuricemia because of the presence of purines in 
porcine pancreatic extracts  [Package insert Creon, Pancreaze, Zenpep, Pertzye] . In 
addition, patients with an allergy to proteins of porcine origin may have severe allergic reactions . 
• As all of the currently marketed PERTs are porcine derived, there is a supply risk (both quality and quantity) that is dependent on the availability of  pig herds.  
 
Because of the risks and limitations of porcine PERT, new drugs are demanded by 
[CONTACT_405817].  
A fundamental question is the value and usefulness of a lipase-only enzyme replacement therapy, such as MS1819 for patients with EPI.  For decades, the only available enzyme 
supplements to treat EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405776]-derived pancreatic enzymes containing a mixture 
of lipase, protease, and amylase.  While the importance of the individual components in 
treating maldigestion has not been prospectively assessed, it is widely agreed that the earliest 
and sometimes only sign of malabsorption is steatorrhea (DiMagno et al, 1993; Ferrone et 
al, 2007).  Extrapancreatic sources of protease and amylase exist (Dominguez-Munoz, 2007; 
Hammer et al, 2010), whereas little lipase is available other than t hat secreted by [CONTACT_366054].  Furthermore, some have suggested that protease deficiency can be treated in part 
with essential amino-acid mixtures (Engelen et al, 2014).  Most agree that amylase is the 
least important of the 3 supplemental pancreatic enzymes (Ladas et al, 1993) perhaps because 
of high amylase content in salivary gland secretions.  In summary, the future value of a 
lipase-only supplement, either as a lipase-only replacement therapy in patients with mild to 
moderate EPI, or as an augmenting lipase for hyporesponsive patients reaching maximal 
doses of porcine enzyme treatment, remains to be seen.  
5.[ADDRESS_511720] (MS1819)  
MS1819 is a preparation of a recombinant yeast lipase, designated LIP2, which is a secreted 
enzyme, isolated from the strictly aerobic Yarrowia lipolytica that is found in various foods 
such as cheese and olive oil. This non pathogen micro-organism is widely used as a 
biocatalyst (e.g., erythritol production, a polyol used as a food additive) and is generally 
recognized as safe by [CONTACT_405818]. The genetically engineered 
strain of Yarrowia lipolytica contains 5 additional copi[INVESTIGATOR_405777]2 gene integrated int o its 
genome (total of 6 including the endogenous native LIP2 gene). The genetic stability of the strain has been assessed for 100 generations, providing a safety margin as the full 
fermentation process corresponds to approximately 30 generations. Both current Good 
Manufacturing Practice (cGMP)-compliant Master Cell Bank and Working Cell Bank have 
been manufactured. 
The LIP2 gene product is a [ADDRESS_511721] the proteolysis by [CONTACT_405819] 
(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_405778], 2000). At least [ADDRESS_511722] been 
characterized (Aloulou et al, 2007). 
Until 2009, the active ingredient for MS1819 (recombinant yeast lipase, designated LIP2) 
was freeze-dried (FD) to obtain a final drug substance, MS1819-FD. From 2010 onwards, 
the process was changed for large scale production and the active ingredient for MS1819 w as 
mixed with maltodextrin at a 1:2 ratio (dry weight/weight) and then spray  dried (SD) to obtain 
a final drug substance, MS1819-SD. MS1819-SD will be referred to as MS1819 as this is the 
only form of drug substance currently in clinical development. 
In is this clinical trial, MS1819 is supplied in ~280 mg (420,000 TBU), size zero enteric 
capsules (Capsugel, Morristown, NJ, [LOCATION_003]). 
5.5 Preclinical Studies with MS1819 
5.5.1 In Vitro Studies 
The enzymatic activity of LIP2 has been extensively investigated in vitro and has an 
appropriate profile to compensate the EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405779]. 
For example, the optimal activity of LIP2 occurs at pH 6, and works well in a range from pH 
4 to 7 which is usually found in the duodenum of CF patients with decreased pancreas derived 
bicarbonate. In addition, LIP2 enzymatic activity is not inactivated by [CONTACT_405820]. Furthermore, 
LIP2 is active on triglycerides with a wide range of fatty-acid lengths, including long-chain 
triglycerides, which are the predominant forms of triglycerides in the human diet. Compared with the porcine pancreatic lipase, LIP2 is more active than the porcine pancreatic lipase with 
all triglycerides tested at pH ranging from 4 to 6. 
5.5.2 In Vivo Studies  
The efficacy of MS1819-FD has been investigated in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107] ; in which experimental 
pancreatitis and EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405780]. Daily doses of MS1819-FD 
10.5 mg or greater administered once a day nearly completely corrected the CFA of 
approximately 20 kg minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107] (Aloulou 2015). The safety of MS1819 has been investigated in 2 nonclinical regulatory trials whereby 
[INVESTIGATOR_46427]1819 was well tolerated at dosages up to 4700 mg/kg in rats and 1175 mg/kg in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_405781] 13 weeks, equivalent to 1000mg/kg and 250mg/kg of lipase respectively.  
In summary, MS1819 was effective in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_405782] a maximum feasible dose over 3 month’s administration.  
AzurRx BioPharma, Inc.   October 30, [ADDRESS_511723]-in-man study, 
FLIP110. This exploratory clinical trial without pre defined statistical analysis objectives, was 
a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel study.  
Patients affected with chronic pancreatitis or pancreatectomy and severe EPI, were randomly 
assigned to 2 phases with an allocation ratio of 2:1 to receive MS1819 -FD 20 mg 3 times a 
day or a ‘dummy’ placebo treatment identical in aspect and taste. Each treatment was given 
for a phase of 1 week after a 1-week washout phase.  
Twelve patients were randomly included: 8 in MS1819-FD phase and 4 in the placebo phase. 
Three patients in the MS1819-FD phase were excluded from the per protocol (PP) analysis 
because of severe protocol deviations (i.e., steatorrhea < 7 g/day in the baseline phase 
demonstrating the lack of significant EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405783]). 
The primary endpoint of the study was defined as the relative change in steatorrhea compared 
with baseline. A nonstatistically significant d ifference of the primary endpoint was found 
between the 2 phases both in intent-to-treat (ITT: -14.6 % ± 26.6 in the MS1819-FD phase 
vs +16.9 % ± 40 in the placebo phase; not significant) and PP analysis (-15.8 % ± 20.6 in the 
MS1819-FD phase vs +16.9 % ± 40 in the placebo phase; not significant), respectively.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints also support the efficacy of MS1819-FD compared with 
placebo in both ITT and PP populations, including the absolute change in CFA (ITT: 
+6.1 ± 13.4 vs -6.7% ± 11.0), number of daily evacuations over 7 days (ITT: -19.2% ± 22.8 
vs +4.1% ± 11.7; p =.09), the weight of stools (ITT: -10.6% ± 27.4 vs +25.5% ± 48.2; not 
significant), and Bristol scale, which is a classification of the form of human feces to evaluate 
the effectiveness of treatments for diseases of the bowel (ITT: -5.13% ± 15.5 vs 
+2.46% ± 16.6; p<.0001). 
MS1819-FD was well  tolerated with no serious adverse events (SA Es). Only 2 AEs were 
observed: constipation (2 patients in the MS1819 group) and hypoglycemia (2 patients in the 
MS1819 group and 1 patient in the placebo group). 
In summary, the FLIP110 study supported the continued clinical investigations of the 
efficacy of higher doses of MS1819 using established surrogate biomarkers for EPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_405784].

5.6.2 MS1819/16/01 Phase 2a Study with MS1819 
An open-label, dose escalation Phase 2a study (MS1819/16/01) was conducted to investigate 
the safety of escalating doses of MS1819 in 11 patients with EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405785]. 
The primary objective of this study was to investigate the safety of escalating doses of 
MS1819 (280 mg/day, 560 mg/day, 1120 mg/day, and 2240 mg/day).  Each dose was given 
over a two-week period. A CFA was obtained at baseline after washout, and after each 
escalating dose period.  Safety assessments included immunoallergic side effects, digestive 
symptoms, and clinical laboratory tests. The secondary objective of this study was to 
investigate the efficacy of MS1819 by [CONTACT_405821].  
Eleven patients were enrolled into the stud y, and ten completed all doses.  One patient 
withdrew during the 1120 mg/day dose level due to severe diarrhea.  This was not assessed 
as related to study drug. 
In the Intent-to-Treat population, mean CFA rose from a baseline of 46.1% to 62.4% at the 
highest dose (p = 0.001).  A number of symptoms improved comparing the highest dose to 
baseline, including stool consistency (p < 0 .001), number of bowel movements (p = 0.006), 
steatorrhea (p = 0.008), and abdominal pain (p = 0.148).  The treatment was well tolerated, 
with only two SAEs reported.  Only one SAE was considered by [CONTACT_405822], which was a patient with mild, transient elevations of liver 
enzymes.  The elevations were between 2 and 3 X upper limit of normal  (ULN) , and lasted 
for about two weeks, a period of time that the patient was no longer receiving study drug. 
The patient had no symptoms of liver disease.  
5.6.[ADDRESS_511724] experience with MS1819 in patients 
with cystic fibrosis.  The trial began in February of 2019, and all patient s completed the trial 
by [CONTACT_61763] 2019.  The trial was conducted in 14 sites, with 11 in the U.S. and 3 in Poland.  All 
sites participated in enrollment.  The primary objectives of the trial were to ascertain safety of 2240 mg/day dose of MS1819 in patients with cystic fibrosis and to compare the efficacy 
of MS1819 to commercial PERT in digestion of fat.  The study was not powered for 
inferential statistics. A total of at least [ADDRESS_511725] 30 days. The dose of MS1819 
employed was 2240 mg/day.  This dose, used previously in a Phase [ADDRESS_511726]-time study in cystic fibrosis. 
Patients were randomized to begin the study in a treatment arm of MS1819, or a treatment 
arm using the same PERT, and same dose, they had been receiving prior to enrollment.  After 
three weeks on treatment, a CFA was measured, and the patient was crossed over to the 
opposite treatment.  After three more weeks of treatment, a CFA was measured, and the 
patient was returned to their pre-study PERT.  An end of study visit was done two weeks 
after completing the treatments  or upon early withdrawal of patients .  
A total of 46 patients were screened, 41 were enrolled and 32 completed the study.  Of the 
9 withdrawals, one patient discontinued after completing both study treatment periods, three 
patients discontinued during treatment with PERT and five patients discontinued during 
treatment with MS1819. The withdrawals of patients who discontinued during treatment with 
MS1819 were primarily attributed to increased symptoms of exocrine pancreatic 
insufficiency. 
The mean CFA for the MS1819 group was 56% (range 7% to 92%), and the mean CFA for 
the PERT group was 86% (range 57% to 97%). This mean CFA of 56% on a dose of 
2240 mg/day MS1819 was similar to the mean CFA of 62% in the chronic pancreatitis study 
at the same dose. The mean coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA) for the MS1819 group 
was 93% and the mean CNA for the PERT group was 97%.  Symptoms of exocrine pancreatic 
insufficiency were more prominent in the MS1819 group.  
MS1819 was well-tolerated, with no remarkable adverse events. Three SAEs occurred during 
the screening period, but none during the trial itself. Each of these SAEs w as due to 
pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. Laboratory values were unremarkable during the 
trial. 
5.[ADDRESS_511727] shown MS1819 to be relatively acid stable when compared to 
porcine derived lipases (see Investigator Brochure). However, it is also evident that below 
pH 4.0, there is increasing inactivation of MS1819 as the pH drops. Work by [CONTACT_405823], et al 
(2013), has shown that in CF patients, the pH in the upper duodenum may be as low as 3.[ADDRESS_511728] been exposed to low pH in patients with or without gastric acid 
suppression. Given that in the OPTION study, mean CFA with a dose of 2240 mg/day was 
56%, a level below our target of 80%, it may be important to provide more protection of MS1819 against acid inactivation in the stomach and upper duodenum to provide adequate 
MS1819 dose and optimal lipolytic activity in the duodenum.  Accordingly, for this study, 
enteric capsules will be employed for our MS1819 delivery.  Intrinsically enteric capsules 
AzurRx BioPharma, Inc.   October 30, [ADDRESS_511729]. 
Also, given that our goal is to reach CFA values of 80% or greater, it is reasonable to 
employ a higher dose than that used in the OPTION study.  While it is possible that simply 
adding the protection of an enteric capsule will provide adequate MS1819 delivery at the 
2240 mg/day dose, it is also possible that a higher dose will still be necessary.  To explore 
each of these possibilities, we will use both the 2240 mg/day as well as the 4480 mg/day dose in this study. 
The use of mass (mg) for dose expression, rather than USP lipase units is the result of the 
biochemical difference between porcine pancreatic -derived lipase and the 
microbial-derived lipase from the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica (Aloulou  et al, 2015).  Porcine 
lipase is active at pH >7, while peak yeast-derived lipase activity occurs at pH 6 and has no 
activity at pH 9. The USP assay for porcine lipase units is conducted using an  olive oil 
substrate at pH 9, while the enzymatic activity f or MS1819 is assayed using tributyrin as 
substrate at pH 6.  At pH 6 it is difficult to assess the true lipolytic activity of MS1819 
using olive oil as a substrate given the high pKa of oleic acid (the main fatty acid component of olive oil), it is not pos sible to monitor the lipolysis directly as fatty acid will 
remain in a protonated form and the assay requires the acid form.  No validated conversion 
factor is available for conversion of USP lipas e units to tributyrin units.  It has been 
suggested by [CONTACT_405824]-derived lipase products that mass rather than units be 
used for dose expression (Heubi et al, 2016).

7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
This study is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, 2, 2x2 crossover trial to assess the safety and 
efficacy of MS1819 in enteric capsules in patients with EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405786] 18 years or older. Efficacy will be evaluated by [CONTACT_405826]1819 to treatment with porcine PERT. Refer to Figure 1 for a flow chart of the study 
design. 
Two doses of MS1819 will be studied in parallel groups.  These doses will be 2240 mg/day 
and 4480 mg/day. During the treatment period, patients will be first randomized to the two 
groups and then to either MS1819 or to their pre-study porcine PERT.  After three weeks, a 
CFA will be collected and the patients will be crossed over to the alternative treatment for 
three more weeks of treatment, followed by [CONTACT_405827].  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), consisting of members external to AzurRx 
BioPharma, Inc., and including members of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, 
Inc. (CFFT) DSMB, will monitor safety throughout the trial. After the study is complete, the 
DSMB will review the efficacy/safety data.  
Dosages will typi[INVESTIGATOR_405787]: 1/4 of the daily dose at each of 3 main 
meals, and 1/8 at each of the 2 snacks. The 2240 mg/day dose will be fractionated as follows: 
2 capsules of 280 mg with the morning, noontime, and evening meals, plus 1 capsule of 
280 mg with the morning and evening snacks. The 4480 mg/day dose will be fractionated as 
follows: [ADDRESS_511730] of the original lipase (clintrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; clintrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The recently completed OPTION trial showed no carryover for CFA values 
after crossover. Furthermore, the 3-week duration of treatment with either study agent is well 
established as sufficient to show the degree of lipase effectiveness (FDA Package Insert, CREON; FDA Package insert, PANCREAZE). 
 
This study is divided into 4 main periods.

7.3.4 Removal of Patients from the Study   
A patient may be withdrawn from the study at any time for any of the following reasons: 
• Lost to follow-up 
• Withdrawal of consent, for any reason, at any time 
• Major protocol deviations that could compromise the interpretation of the results  
• Occurrence of an immunoallergic reaction  
• Occurrence of an adverse reaction ( i.e., an SAE related to IMP) that justifies the 
discontinuation of the IMP 
• Pregnancy 
AzurRx BioPharma, Inc.   October 30, [ADDRESS_511738] be fully documented in the case 
report form (CRF) and a short narrative description should be added in the patient’s medical records. 
If at the time of withdrawal, the  patient has received the investigational study product 
(partially or totally), study staff should encourage the patient to a ttend the Early Withdrawal 
Visit for follow-up safety investigations. These patients will be included in the mITT efficacy 
analysis and safety analysis. If the reason for discontinuation is an AE, then the Investigator will seek to obtain follow-up 
information and to document the event until its resolution or stabilization. In any case, the 
Investigator will take all necessary measures to ensure the patient's safety and ensure the patient is treated in accordance with local standard of care . 
If a patient is lost to follow-up, then the Investigator should make every effort to obtain 
maximum information on the reasons for the nonattendance to the visit and on the patient’s 
state of health. All attempts will be documented in the patient’s medic al records. 
Pregnancy 
Patients will be instructed that known or suspected pregnancy occurring during the study, in 
patients or female partners of male patients, should be confirmed and reported to the 
Investigator. Any patient who becomes pregnant during the study must be promptly withdrawn from the study. Upon discontinuation from the study, only those procedures that 
would not expose the patient to undue risk will be performed. The Investigator should also 
be notified of pregnancy occurring during the stu dy but confirmed after completion of the 
study. In the event that a patient is subsequently found to be pregnant after inclusion in the 
study, any pregnancy will be followed to term, and the status of mother and child will be 
reported to the Sponsor after delivery. 
Full details will be recorded in the CRF, or an SAE report will be completed if the patient 
has completed the study.

crossed over to their prestudy PERT will continue with their prescribed therapy.  Remind 
patients of their scheduled Visit 10 date 
8.3.3 Visit 10: End-of-Study /Early Withdrawal Visit (Day 56 ± 2) 
Patients will return to the clinic for their End of Study visit approximately [ADDRESS_511744] dose of study drug (either MS1819 or the patient’s prestudy porcine PERT).  In the event 
that patients do not complete V9, an Early Withdrawal visit will be held approximately 
[ADDRESS_511745] dose of study drug. The procedures scheduled for the End-of-Study 
visit are the same as those that should be conducted for the Early Withdrawal visit.  The 
following procedures will be performed at the End -of-Study/Early Withdrawal Visit: 
• Focused physical exam to evaluate gastrointestinal tract, heart , and lungs 
• Record any changes in AEs and concomitant medication   
• Assess  and record malabsorption signs and symptoms

the patient consume exactly 100  g of fat per day, the fat excretion assay remains valid with a 
fat intake range within 15% of the goal ( i.e., 85 to 115 g of fat per day). The nutritional 
planning and calculation of dietary fat and nitrogen (protein) intake will be conducted by a 
qualified dietician at each site. The actual fat and nitrogen (protein) intake will be calculated 
from the recorded type and amount of food consumed. A central laboratory will calculate 
CFA, CNA, and stool weight values on the basis of dietary intake and the fat and nitrogen 
excreted in stool. 
An indicator marker (500 mg of Food, Drug, and Cosmetics [FD&C] Blue #2) will be 
provided as two 250-mg capsules. The first marker (consisting of two 250 -mg capsules) will 
be given at the beginning of breakfast or first meal on Day 1 of the supervised confinement 
to mark the start of the controlled diet. The second marker (two 250 -mg capsules) will be 
given at the beginning of breakfast or first meal on Day [ADDRESS_511748] marker 
has passed (the first stool containing the first marker is discarded) and is completed when the 
second marker has passed (the first stool containing the second marker is collected). Patients 
must continue the supervised confinement until the second stool marker is passed. The 
controlled diet will be maintained until the patient takes the second marker. Although it is 
not part of the controlled diet, the breakfast or first meal consumed on Day 4 of the supervised 
confinement should mimic (as closely as possible) the breakfast or first meal consumed on

The planned Schedule of Assessments is included in Section 7.1.1 (Table 1). 
9.[ADDRESS_511751] medical occurrence experien ced by a patient in a clinical 
investigation; it does not necessarily have a causa l relationship with this study drug. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product , whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product. Active or worsening of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405795].  Worsening 
of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405796].   
Adverse events may also include postdose complications that occur as a result of 
protocol-mandated procedures (e.g., invasive procedures such as venipuncture, biopsy, etc.).  
Preexisting events that increase in severity or change in nature during, or as a consequence 
of, use of a medicinal product in a human clinical study will also be considered AEs.  Any 
preexisting medical condition or diagnosis associated with a clinically significant laboratory 
abnormality should be documented on the CRF or eCRF.  The Investigator should attempt to 
establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and other clinical information. 
In such cases, the unifying diagnosis should be documented as the AE, rather than the individual signs and symptoms (e.g., runny nose, scratch throat, cough, and low grade fever 
should be recorded as an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_405797]). 
An AE does NOT include the following: 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion); the condition that necessitates the procedure is an AE  
• Any preexisting disease or condition or laboratory abnormality present or 
detected before the start of administration of study medication that does not 
worsen 
• Laboratory abnormalities without clinical manifestations, which do not require 
medical intervention, or that do  not result in termination or delay of study 
medication 
AzurRx BioPharma, Inc.   October 30, 2020  
AZ-CF2002   Version 3.0  Page 49 of 79 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL • Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred ( e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63805], social, or convenience admissions)  
• Overdose of any study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or 
symptoms, unless the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913] 
• Worsening and/or flares of EPI [CONTACT_259118]. This should be recorded in the 
appropriate EPI [CONTACT_87479]. However, if disease worsening meets any of the criteria for 
an SAE, it must be recorded on the SAE form and reported to the Sponsor or 
designee within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.  
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is defined as any adverse experience occurring at any dose of study medication that 
occurs between the time th e patient signs the informed consent form through the end -of-study 
that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening situation (patient is at immediate risk of death) 
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186634] n for a 
clinically relevant reason (note that this excludes “social” hospi[INVESTIGATOR_405798] ) 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a patient who received study 
drug 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171763], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or patient may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition .  
Examples may include, but are not limited to:  
o Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm 
o Blood dyscrasias that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
o Seizures that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37349] “serious” is any in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256170] a minimum of an overnight stay in a health care facility.

CONFIDENTIAL Worsening and/or flares of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_405799].  However, if disease worsening meets any of the criteria for an SAE, then it must be 
recorded on the SAE form and reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event. 
9.1.3 “Serious” vs “Severe” Adverse Event 
To avoid confusion or misunderstanding over the difference between the terms “serious”  and 
“severe,” which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is provided 
(excerpted from International Council for Harmonisation [ICH] E2A):  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical sign ificance (such as severe headache).  This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually ass ociated with 
events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves 
as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
9.1.4 SAE Definition Clarifications 
• Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an AE in itself .  
• All deaths during study through the end-of-study, regardless of cause or 
relationship, must be reported. 
• “Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the patient is actively receiving study 
drug at the time of the event. 
• “Life-threatening” means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred. This does not include an event that might have led to death, 
had it occurred with greater severity.  
• Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98176].  If an AE prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is an SAE. 
• “In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” means the patient has been formally admitted to a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113979], for any length of time, excepting situations where 
an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10800], social, or convenience admissions). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_405800].  It does not include presentation and care within an emergency 
department (although an emergency department visit may define a medically important event, which is also considered an SAE).

AZ-CF2002   Version 3.0  Page 51 of 79 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL • If any AE worsens during the study and eventually meets the criteria for an SAE 
the AE should be recorded as a new SAE. 
9.2 Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events 
AEs will be recorded in the CRF for all patients from the time the patient signs the informed 
consent form through the end of the study or patient withdrawal. 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs (as defined in  Section 9.1 and as 
further specified below) observed by [CONTACT_405833]’ medical records, in the CRF, and as an SAE in the electronic 
data capture system.  These AEs will include the following:  
1. All SAEs (as defined in Section 9.1.2) that occur. 
2. All nonserious AEs (as defined in Sect ion 9.1.1) that occur. 
The following AE attributes must be assigned by [CONTACT_737]:   
• AE diagnosis or syndrome(s) (if known, signs or symptoms if not known);  
• event description (with detail appropriate to the event);  
• dates of onset and resolution; severity; assessment of relatedness to study drug ; 
and 
• action taken with study medication.   
The Investigator may be asked to provide follow-up information, discharge summaries, and 
extracts from medical records or CRFs. It will be left to the Investigator’s clinical judgment to determine whether the relatedness of 
an AE, and of sufficient severity to require the patient’s removal from treatment or from the 
study. A patient may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment because of what he or she 
perceives as an intolerable AE. If either of these situations arises, the patient should be 
strongly encouraged to complete the End-of-Therapy assessments and be under medical 
supervision until symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable.  
9.3 Grading of Adverse Events,  
The Investigator will be asked to provide an assessment of the severity of the AE using the 
categories noted below.  This assessment is subjective, and the Investigator should use 
medical judgment to compare the reported AE to similar events observed in clinical practice.  
It is important to recognize that severity is not equivalent to event seriousness.  
AzurRx BioPharma, Inc.   October 30, 2020  
AZ-CF2002   Version 3.0  Page 52 of 79 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Grade 1 (Mild):  usually transient; requires no special treatment and does not generally 
interfere with the patient’s daily activities. 
Grade 2 (Moderate):  produces a mild to moderate level of inconvenience to the patient 
and may interfere with daily activities.  These events are usuall y ameliorated by [CONTACT_11884]. 
Grade 3 (Severe):  significantly interrupts daily activity and requires systemic drug 
therapy or other medical treatment.  
9.[ADDRESS_511752] make an assessment of  the relationship of the 
event to the study drug using the following scale: 
Unrelated:  Th e event is definitely not or unlikely associated with study drug 
administration and is judged because of causes other than the study drug. 
Related:  Events considered to be related are those that follow a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the study drug, that are not easily explained by [CONTACT_405834]’s clinical state or other treatment or 
confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_405801] 
(de-challenge), if applicable.  
9.5 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Procedures 
Serious adverse events will be recorded from the time the patient signs the informed consent 
form through the end of study.  AEs will be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes, or 
until the end of study for that patient. 
If the AE is an SAE and is assessed as “related to study drug”, it must be followed until either 
the event is considered stable or resolved.  
Any SAE assessed as “unrelated to study drug” will be followed as clinically indicated until  
its resolution or, if not resolving, until considered stable or until the final study visit for that 
patient whichever comes first. 
All SAEs that occur must be reported within [ADDRESS_511753] as well as the End-of-Therapy CRF. 
The Investigator should notify the appropriate IEC/IRB of SAEs occurring at the site and 
other SAE reports received from AzurRx, in accordance with local procedure s and statutes. 
AzurRx will ensure that applicable regulatory authorities receive all relevant in formation on 
an SAE, in accordance with regulatory requirements.  Results of AzurRx’s investigation of 
other safety information shall be submitted, as required .

during the study.  The following actions should be taken in the event of a confirmed 
pregnancy: 
1. For female patients, study drug should be discontinued immediately. 
2. The pregnancy should be reported to the Safety Group within 24 hours of 
notification using the applicable Pregnancy Report Form.  
3. The Investigator should counsel the patient regarding the possible effects of 
previous study drug exposure on the fetus and the need to inform the study site of 
the outcome of the pregnancy. 
4. The patient or the patient’s pregnant partner must be monitored until the 
immediate postnatal period or until termination of the pregnancy.  The outcome should be reported to the Medical Monitor using the Pregnancy Outcome Form.  
Pregnancy is not an AE in and of itself. However, any pregnancy complication s or elective 
terminations of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE.  A 
spontaneous abortion is always considered an SAE and will be reported as described in the 
AE and SAE sections (Section 9.2 and Section 9.5).  Furthermore, any SAE occurring as an 
adverse pregnancy outcome poststudy must be reported to the Medical Monitor. 
9.7 Hepatic Monitoring 
The following guidelines are provided for the management of serum transaminase elevations 
in patients with new, clinically meaningful increases in liver function tests occurring during 
the study. All cases of new (i.e., since screening) elevations in ALT or AST ³ [ADDRESS_511755] 
or any questions concerning the management of a patient with elevated serum transaminases 
should be discussed with the study Medical Monitor.  
AzurRx BioPharma, Inc.   October 30, 2020  
AZ-CF2002   Version 3.0  Page 54 of 79 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Patients who experience a new (i.e., since screening) elevation in ALT or AST level to 
≥3 × ULN OR total bilirubin ≥1.5 × ULN will have hepatic monitoring (ALT, AST, 
Bilirubin) until one of the following occurs:  
• Withdrawal from study if elevation in ALT or AST level to ≥3 × ULN is 
associated with a rise in total serum bilirubin to ≥2 × ULN (without laboratory 
findings of cholestasis [elevated serum alkaline phosphatase ≥2 × ULN]) 
• Withdrawal from study if elevation in ALT or AST level to ≥5 × ULN is 
associated with new or exacerbated gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (i.e., nausea, 
vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, and/or jaundice) and other causes are not 
evident 
• Withdrawal from the study if elevation in ALT or AST is ≥10 × ULN regardless 
of serum bilirubin level 
Causes of acute elevation of transaminases should be considered and ruled out (e.g., viral 
hepatitis, concomitant medications).  
Patients discontinued from study drug administration should resume porcine PERT therapy 
according to physician prescription.   
9.[ADDRESS_511756] (DSMB) will monitor and protect the 
safety and risk/benefit of the study patients throughout the study duration and evaluate the 
risk/benefit of study drug.  The DSMB will consist of suitably qualified individuals, including 
CF experts.   
9.9 Appropriateness of Measurements 
The efficacy and safety assessments planned for this study are widely used and generally 
recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant to the assessment of biological products 
administered to patients with CF.

CONFIDENTIAL 10. STATISTICAL METHODS  
10.1 General Considerations 
The statistical methods will be further detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment 
only if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other chan ge to the data analysis 
methods described in the protocol, and the description for makin g the change, will be 
described in the SAP and in the clinical study report. Additional exploratory analyses of the 
data will be conducted as deemed appropriate.  
Statistical methodology and analyses will be in accordance with the principles outlined by 
[CONTACT_25039] (ICH) E9 guidelines.   
Tables, listings, and figures will be produced in accordance with the principles outlined by 
[CONTACT_11580] E3 guidelines.   Summaries will consist of descriptive statistics including the non missing counts, mean, 
standard deviation, median, Interquartiles (IQ), minimum and maximum values for 
continuous variables, and number and percentage of patients in each defined category for 
categorical variables.  
The primary efficacy endpoint analysis aims to compare the mean CFA after re ceiving 
MS1819 vs porcine PERT.  With the sample size to be employed, primary efficacy analysis 
will be descriptive rather than inferential.  
As a general rule, missing data will not be replaced.  
10.2 Sample Size Determination 
Based upon CFA data obtained in the recently completed Phase 2a trial (OPTION), 
15 patients per MS1819 dose should provide sufficient point estimates of CFA in each group. 
Given the acceptable safety profile obtained in the OPTION trial, a sample of 15 patients should be adequate for observation of safety per dose of MS1819. This study will use 
descriptive analyses for both safety and efficacy analyses.

CONFIDENTIAL 10.3 Analysis Sets 
• Safety Set: patients receiving at least one dose of treatment. Patients will be 
analyzed according to the treatment actually received. The Safety Set will be used 
for all analyses of safety endpoints unless specified otherwise and for the 
summaries of patients in listings related to dosing of study drug. 
• Efficacy sets: 
o mITT Set: All randomized patients receiving at least one dose of treatment 
and have at least one valid stool collection and CFA post baseline while 
receiving their assigned study drug. The mITT set is considered as the 
primary set for the efficacy analysis. The mITT set will be used for all 
analyses of efficacy endpoints . 
o Per Protocol Set: Subset of the mITT set comprising all patients who do 
not violate the terms of the protocol in a way that would a ffect the study 
outcome significantly, as determined by [CONTACT_1003]. Protocol 
deviations will be captured throughout the study and classified as minor 
or major and reviewed at a data review meeting before database lock. 
Attendees will include appropriate individuals from the Sponsor and 
contract research organization. Each major deviation will be categorized 
as either important or not important with respect to the effect on the 
primary endpoint analysis. A sensitivity analysis will be performed in the 
Per Protocol Set.  
10.4 Handling Missing Data  
Missing data will not be replaced.   
10.5 Demographic, Other Baseline Characteristics and Medication 
Demographics, other baseline characteristics , and medications will be summarized for the 
Safety Set unless specified otherwise. 
10.5.1 Patient Disposition and Withdrawals 
The following will be summarized: 
• Number of screen failures  
• Number of patients included in the ITT, and PP sets 
• Number of patients who completed the study (both treatment periods)

CONFIDENTIAL • Number of patients who discontinued the study early with reasons  
The patient disposition, inclusion and exclusion criteria not met, eligibility for each analysis 
set, and protocol deviations will be listed.  
10.5.2 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summarized in the Safety Set: 
• For each treatment arm (i.e., 2240 mg/day and 4480 mg/day)  
• for each sequence of each cross over  
• for each crossover 
• for all patients  
10.6 Safety Analysis   
Safety (AEs, SAEs, discontinuations due to adverse events, and safety laboratory values) will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_339818]. A DSMB will be in charge to assess the safety of 
MS1819.  The DSMB Chairperson will receive SAE reports in real time during the study.  In 
addition, the DSMB will do a full data review at the end of the study to assess overall safety. 
10.7  Efficacy Analysis   
10.7.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the CFA assessed at the end of each 3-week 
treatment period (Visit 6 or Visit 9). CFA will be calculated as follows: 
CFA (%) = 100 ((fat intake (g) − fat excretion (g))/ fat intake (g))  
 
Primary Analysis:   
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be a comparison of the mean CFAs from 
the MS1819 treatment vs the PERT treatment, using descriptive statistics. This analysis will be conducted for each of the two MS1819 doses. 
An exploratory analysis of non-inferiority between the MS1819 and PERT groups will be 
conducted.  The treatment effect, along with the 95% confidence interval of the difference in 
CFA (MS1819 minus porcine PERT), will be estimated.  Non-inferiority will be claimed if

CONFIDENTIAL the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is greater than -15%, where 15% is the non-
inferiority margin. 
Subgroup analyses: Analyses of CFA considering the same approach used for  the primary 
analysis will be performed in the following subgroups: 
• by [CONTACT_405810] (<80% vs ³80%). An analysis will 
be done in the subgroup of Patients with CFA below 80% while receiving porcine 
PERT, as well as in the subgroup of patients with CFA of 80% or greater while 
receiving porcine PERT.  
• by [CONTACT_405835]. 
10.7.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA) will be calculated and analyzed in the same manner 
as CFA. 
Stool weights, signs and symptoms for malabsorption, body weight, BMI and lipid soluble 
vitamins (A, D, E, and K), will be analyzed using descriptive methods.

CONFIDENTIAL 11. EXTENSION PHASE  
11.1 Exploratory Objective 
The exploratory objective of the Extension Phase (EP) is to find a dose of MS1819 in 
immediate release capsules that is safe and results in CFA values in a therapeutic range.  
11.[ADDRESS_511757] acid deactivation.  Based upon in vitro 
studies, an expected 50% or more of inactivation of MS1819 might occur in the gastric phase 
if unprotected.  The primary clinical endpoint for the study was to achieve consistent CFAs 
in the range considered by [CONTACT_405836].  
The results of OPTION 2 may not achieve the stated objective.  As in the previous OPTION  
study, (see section 5.6.3 of this protocol), no safety issues have occurred in the OPTION [ADDRESS_511758] already passed 
beyond the duodenum. 
It is clear, that while rational, the enteric capsule may not be performing to expectations.  The 
Extension Phase of our clinical trial, described in this amended protocol, is intended to 
explore a different approach to solve the problem of delivering an adequate enzyme dose for 
meal digestion.  The use of immediate release capsules, as was the case in the original 
OPTION trial, provides for immediate dissolution and mixing with the meal in the stomach.  
In this Extension Phase, we propose to overcome the partial loss of enzyme activity from 
stomach acid exposure by [CONTACT_405837].  
Having the previous experience with the 2.2 grams/day dose in the original OPTION trial , 
we now propose to increase the dose to 4.4 grams/day, and if safe but not resulting in adequate CFAs, proceed to 6.7 grams/day dosing.  Past experience showing a dose response 
in chronic pancreatitis patients  (MS1819/16/01 Phase 2a Study with MS1819) offers 
encouragement that a higher dose accompanied by [CONTACT_405838] a therapeutic range.  The Data 
Monitoring Committee for the original OPTION study has reviewed the safety profile for the 
2.2 grams/day dose in immediate release capsules and approved increasing the dose to 4.4 grams/day. 
AzurRx BioPharma, Inc.   October 30, [ADDRESS_511759] 
a large cohort of patients studied while using a stable dose of PERTs in OPTION and OPTION 2 we will not enroll further PERT control patients.  
Patients enrolled into the extension phase (EP) will be composed of patients who have 
completed the crossover phase of OPTION 2. These patients must continue to comply with 
the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as used in the crossover phase of the OPTION 2 
trial (some screening tests  may need to be repeated and all subjects must have completed an 
End of Study visit in the crossover phase). Concomitant medications will be allowed as in 
the crossover phase. The Drug Product, immediate release capsules each containing 140 mg 
of MS1819, will be the same as used in a previous OPTION trial (AZ-CF2001) of MS1819 
in patients with EPI [INVESTIGATOR_220981].  
The EP will first enroll 9 patients, each receiving 4.4 grams/day of immediate release 
capsules of MS1819, for 2 weeks.  At the end of 2 weeks, patients will enter confinement for 
a controlled diet, stool collection and CFA measurement.  Data will be analyzed using 
descriptive statistics.  Based upon resulting CFA data, 5 additional patients may be enrolled 
at the 4.4 grams/day dose to better characterize th e CFA following encouraging results from 
the initial 9 patients.  If safety is satisfactory and the CFAs do not achieve values considered to be in the therapeutic range, 9 more patients will be enrolled and dosed at 6.7 grams/day 
for [ADDRESS_511760] participated in the 4.4 grams/day 
dose evaluation, as described above, or may be new patients from the OPTION 2 crossover phase. After treatment with 6.7 grams/day for 2 weeks is completed, CFAs will be measured, 
and data assessed as before.  Depending on CFA analysis, either another 5 patients will be 
enrolled at the 6.7 grams/day dose to better characterize encouraging initial results, or the 
study will be terminated. 
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_405808] 9 patient phase of 
4.4 grams/day, and again after the initial 9 patient phase of 6.7 grams/day, should that dose 
be studied.

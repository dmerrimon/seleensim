Aims and Goals  
 
The current protocol is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_147898]-assisted psychotherapy on symptoms of chronic, tr eatment-
resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study follows thr ee FDA-approved 
Phase I safety studies (one sponsored by [CONTACT_147944]), is endorsed by [CONTACT_147945] s tudies, and is 
the first FDA-approved scientific study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy  in any patient 
population. 
  
Findings from this study will be used to guide development of a second pi[INVESTIGATOR_147899]-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD patients.  If  results of 
both of these pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], plus another small pi[INVESTIGATOR_147900], are 
promising, the data gathered will be used to inform the design of two large (N= at lea st 
280) multi-site Phase III studies of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a tr eatment for 
PTSD.  MAPS' Clinical Plan (Doblin 2002) will require at least [ADDRESS_169573] 
cognitive function when measured two months after the second experimental session.  
The hypotheses to be tested by [CONTACT_147946]:  
 
1. Volunteers receiving MDMA-assisted psychotherapy will experience (t rends toward) 
a greater decrease in signs and symptoms of PTSD than controls after each 
experimental session, as measured by [CONTACT_15370]-rated PTSD Scale ( CAPS), the 
self-reported Impact of Events Scale (IES) and Symptoms Checklist-90-R ( SCL-90-
R). 
 
2. Volunteers receiving MDMA-assisted psychotherapy will experience (t rends toward) 
a greater decrease in signs and symptoms of PTSD than controls at two months 
after the second drug-assisted (MDMA or placebo) session. 
 
3. Exposure to MDMA will not be associated with neurocognitive toxicity as assess ed 
by [CONTACT_147947] (RBANS), 
the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT) and the Rey-Osterrieth Compl ex 
Figure Test.

 Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_68020] C Mithoefer. Sponso r: MAPS   
The primary outcome measure evaluating efficacy will be the Clinician-A dministered 
PTSD Scale (CAPS). Secondary outcome measures evaluating efficacy wi ll be the 
Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the Symptom Checklist 90-R.  
 
The assessment of neuropsychological status serves as a means of safety  evaluation and 
is measured by [CONTACT_147948] 
(RBANS), the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), and the Rey-Oster rieth 
Complex Figure. The NEO Personality Inventory is a neuropsychological measure  of 
personality that is also part of our safety evaluation. 
 
Background  
 
MDMA is a ring-substituted phenylisopropylamine derivative with a unique profile of  
psychopharmacological effects that make it well suited to intensive psychot herapy.  
MDMA has been hypothesized to represent a new class of psychoactive agents, call ed 
entactogens (Nichols 1986; Nichols 1990), producing feelings of closeness to others, 
empathy, well being, and insightfulness, with little perceived loss of control  (Grinspoon 
and Bakalar 1986; Hegadoren et al. 1999; Nichols 1986; Shulgin and Nichols 1978).  
There is considerable previous human experience with the use of MDMA in the context 
of psychotherapy. Before MDMA was classified in [ADDRESS_169574] to psychotherapy in the United Stat es and 
Europe (Adamson 1985; Gasser 1994; Greer and Tolbert 1998; 1986; Grinspoon and 
Bakalar 1986).  Although no properly controlled trials were conducted, these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147901]-clinical or clinical psychiatric conditions, including posttraumatic  stress 
disorder.  More recently, placebo-controlled clinical trials have confirmed r eports from 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147902]-controlled intoxication characteriz ed by 
[CONTACT_147949], increased well being, sociability, self-confidence, and extrovers ion (Cami et al. 
2000; Harris et al. 2002; Liechti et al. 2001a; Tancer et al. 2001; Vollenweider et al. 
1998).   
 
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs in response to a traumatic eve nt or events.  It 
is most likely to occur following an event involving perceived personal threat, such a s 
rape or physical assault (Breslau 1998).  Approximately 10% - 20% of people who 
experience a major trauma go on to develop PTSD, giving it an estimated 8% prevale nce 
in the general population (Kessler et al. 1995).  In the National Comorbidity Study, t he 
median time to remission was [ADDRESS_169575] still had symptoms several time s per 
week 10 years later (Kessler et al. 1995).  People with PTSD frequently develop ot her 
comorbidities, particularly affective and substance abuse disorders (Kess ler et al. 1995).  
In addition to the psychiatric manifestations, individuals with PTSD have an increas ed 
incidence of physical problems and impairments in social and occupational functioning  
that lead to increased healthcare utilization and decreased quality of life (Br ady et al. 
2000: Kessler et al. 1999; Solomon and Davidson, 1997).  PTSD is clearly a public health 
problem that causes a great deal of suffering and accounts for a significant  portion of 
health care costs.  It is also a disorder for which there are, to date, two FDA-appr oved 
medications [both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)] about which the re are 
still many unanswered questions regarding psychological and pharmacologi cal effects 
(Montgomery and Bech 2000).  The search for more effective treatments and a wider  
array of treatments is of substantial public health importance.

Treatment goals for posttraumatic stress disorder include alleviating  symptoms and 
interrupting the stress-induced neurochemical abnormalities produced by [CONTACT_147950].  
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_147903] i nterrupt the 
destructive neurobiological changes by [CONTACT_147951].  
Anecdotal reports of past experience with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sugges t that it 
could serve as such a treatment. On the basis of past reports of successful treatm ent of 
PTSD with MDMA-assisted therapy and on the basis of its reported entactogenic  effects, 
we expect that psychotherapy conducted in combination with MDMA should produce 
symptomatic improvement in this population.   
 
Anecdotal accounts of the use of MDMA in people with PTSD-like symptoms (no formal 
diagnoses or evaluations were conducted) can be found on the MAPS website at the 
bottom of the MDMA page ( http://www.maps.org/research/mdma/index.html#healing) , 
in the Accounts of Healing section,  and include an account of a woman treated for PTSD 
after rape and sexual abuse (http://www.maps.org/research/mdma/moaccou nt.html). 
Other anecdotal reports not dealing specifically with therapy in people with P TSD have 
also included accounts of people treated for PTSD-like symptoms (Metzner and  
Adamson 2001).   
 
Further reports of the therapeutic use of MDMA can be found in the testimony from the  
1985-[ADDRESS_169576]. Greer (who had administered MDMA to about 80 
individuals and reported apparent benefits to the therapeutic alliance and to outcome s), 
[CONTACT_148006] (who reported use of MDMA with [ADDRESS_169577] shown accelerated therapeutic progress), and [CONTACT_148007] (who reporte d 
successfully conducting approximately 150 MDMA sessions with about 100 patients), 
and others. Transcripts and documents from of these hearings can be found on the MAPS 
website at: http://www.maps.org/dea-mdma/ (in Section 6). No formal FDA-a pproved 
study of the therapeutic use of MDMA in any patient population has yet to be conducted, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_147904]. 
 
Samuel Widmer, MD, Peter Gasser, MD, and other members of the Swiss Medical 
Society for Psycholytic Therapy received permission from the Swiss Minis try of Health 
to administer MDMA to patients from 1988 to 1993. During this time, 171 patients 
received MDMA with no significant adverse effects reported. In a follow- up survey, 
85.1% of 121 responding patients reported good or slight improvement during therapy, 
which included 6.8 ± 4.3 (1 - 16) MDMA sessions administered in the context of on-
going therapy. Unfortunately, no formalized research was conducted with these  patients. 
[CONTACT_148008]’s report on the follow-up survey was published in the MAPS Bulletin and can 
be found at: http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v05n3/05303psy.html . 
 
The subject population of chronic PTSD patients was selected in part because these  
individuals have failed to obtain relief from currently available treatments  and because of 
patient and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147905]-assisted psychotherapy in tr eating 
PTSD, from treatments conducted prior to the criminalization of MDMA in 1985.  The 
qualities that have been associated with MDMA in anecdotal reports (i.e. decrea sed 
defensiveness and enhanced therapeutic alliance) seem to have the potential t o be 
particularly useful in the treatment of this disorder.  PTSD is a condition that invol ves

prominent fear responses. Revisiting traumatic experiences in psychotherapy  is 
recognized to be of therapeutic value. Early clinical experience with MDMA is  consistent 
with the hypothesis that it can increase therapeutic effectiveness in this popula tion.  The 
combination of anxiolysis (reduction in fear and anxiety), euphoria, feelings of 
interpersonal closeness and facilitated recall for past events would seem to  have the 
potential to maximize or amplify the benefits of psychotherapeutic interve ntions.  
 
MDMA primarily acts as a monoamine releaser, as well as possessing som e direct effects 
on various neurotransmitter receptor sites (for further details, see Chapter  1 in the 
Investigator’s Brochure and Liechti and Vollenweider, 2001).  The relationships bet ween 
the neurochemical and physiological effects of MDMA are poorly understood, but st udies 
of subjective effects in humans indicate that potentially therapeutic actions m ay be at 
least partly due to monoamine releasing properties and to moderate activity at the 
serotonin 5HT2A receptor.  An imaging study also noted lower activity in the left 
amygdala after MDMA (Gamma et al. 2000), suggesting that MDMA inhibits or a lters 
activity in areas of the brain that process fear-related stimuli. 
 
To date, several Phase I trials have been conducted in the [LOCATION_002], Spain and 
Switzerland.  MDMA has been administered to over 100 participants in controlled studie s 
conducted within the [LOCATION_002], and to over 100 more individuals in controlled 
studies conducted in Europe.  When MDMA is used in therapeutic doses in a controlled 
setting, the risk/benefit ratio is favorable (Cami et al. 2000; de la Torre et al . 2000a; de la 
Torre et al. 2000b; Grob et al, In Preparation, Data presented to FDA; Grob et al. 1996; 
Harris et al. 2002; Lester et al. 2000a; b; Liechti and Vollenweider 2000a; b; Li echti et al, 
2001a: b; Mas et al. 1999; Pacifici et al. 2001; 2000; Tancer et al. 2001; Vollenweider et 
al. 1998; 1999).  MDMA appears to have risks that are similar to those of other 
structurally-related sympathomimetic compounds, such as methamphetamine, that  have 
been used clinically for many years. 
 
Since the late 1970s, MDMA has been used by a growing number of individuals in non-
medical settings.  Illicit use of ecstasy (material sold as MDMA)  is most commonly 
reported at dance events such as “rave” parties and at nightclubs but is not confined t o 
these situations or subcultures.  In the [LOCATION_002], prevalence of ecstasy u se reported in 
2000 was estimated to be 11.6% for young adults (ages 19-28).  While a number of 
serious adverse events, including fatalities, have been reported after illic it use of ecstasy 
in uncontrolled conditions, these are events are relatively rare when considering t he 
prevalence of ecstasy use (Gore 1999; Baggott, 2002).   
 
There has been no evidence of significant acute or lasting toxicity in Phas e I studies.  
This is noteworthy because animal studies have indicated a possibility of long- term 
serotonergic brain changes after high dose MDMA regimens (e.g., Hatzidimi triou et al. 
1999; Lew et al. 1996; Sabol et al. 1996) and some studies suggest clinically subtle 
neurocognitive changes may occur in a subset of repeated users of illicit MDMA and 
other drugs (e.g., Croft et al. 2000; Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al. 2000).  In contrast, all  
available Phase I data indicate that it is unlikely that the MDMA exposures  proposed in 
this protocol cause persisting measurable reduction in serotonin function or lasting 
neurocognitive deficits.  Tests of neurocognitive function have found that performanc e is 
not affected by [CONTACT_147952] (Boone et al. In Pre paration, see 
also Table 2.5  in Investigator’s Brochure; Vollenweider et al. 2001; 2000).

Twelve participants will be randomly assigned to receive MDMA, while eig ht 
participants will receive inactive placebo. The additional participant will  be randomly 
assigned to receive MDMA or placebo, with a 60% chance of receiving MDMA anda 
40% chance of receiving placebo. Following baseline measures and two introductory 
psychotherapy sessions, participants will receive two MDMA or placebo-assi sted 
sessions spaced 3-[ADDRESS_169579] “open label” sess ion as soon 
as can be arranged after the blind is broken for the participant 2 months after the se cond 
experimental session. Participants assigned placebo who choose to enroll in “Sta ge 2” 
will undergo three open-label sessions scheduled as indicated in the tables below.  One 
day after each experimental session, a non-drug psychotherapy session will  occur. In 
addition, three or four non-drug psychotherapy sessions will be conducted between the 
two experimental sessions, three or four non-drug psychotherapy sessions will  be 
conducted after the second experimental session, and three non-drug therapy sess ions will 
be scheduled after the third “open label” session. Outcome measures will be adm inistered 
two months after the second MDMA or placebo session in Stage [ADDRESS_169580] of study participation.

Primary outcome measures were selected to be well-validated, clinically -relevant, and 
repeatable.  These include observer-rated measures of PTSD symptoms, subjec t-rated 
measures of symptoms and discomfort, and neuropsychologist-administered tests of  
neurocognitive function. Observer-rated and subject-rated measures of symptoms w ill be 
made at baseline, at four days after each experimental session, and at two m onths after 
the second experimental session.  Neurocognitive function will be assessed at  baseline 
and at two months after the second experimental session.  A complete medical 
examination will be performed at baseline and at four days after the second MDM A or 
placebo session.  During experimental sessions, participants will be supervise d at all 
times by [CONTACT_128490], including a physician who will be present thr oughout 
each experimental session.  Measures of physiological status and partici pant distress 
intended to monitor participant safety will be made at frequent, scheduled intervals . 
Participants who had received placebo during this study will be offered an opportunity  to 
receive MDMA-assisted psychotherapy upon completion of the study. Participa nts who 
consent to the open-label continuation would receive two experimental sessions with [ADDRESS_169581] age 1 or 
Stage 2, as applicable, consenting participants may take part in a long-te rm follow-up that 
will include re-assessment with CAPS and a questionnaire addressing the positi ve and 
negative effects of taking part in the study, any enrollment in new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and us e of 
“ecstasy” subsequent to study participation. The independent rater will conduct the   
CAPS assessment over the telephone and the questionnaires will be mailed to 
participants. 
 Data Analysis  
 
The current study is a Phase II pi[INVESTIGATOR_147906] e stimate of 
the effect size of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in relieving symptoms of P TSD.  As 
such, this study has sufficient power only to detect large effects.  However, it i s 
hypothesized that participants receiving MDMA-assisted psychotherapy w ill tend to have 
greater decreases in observer-rated and self-rated symptoms and associa ted problems at 
 MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in Chronic PTSD 9/24/0 3, revised -01/23/2009  10

four days and two months after the final experimental session compared to partic ipants 
receiving placebo.   
 
The first thirteen participants have been stratified prior to randomization acc ording to 
whether or not they have been [CONTACT_148009]’s patients. Since it is unlikely that ma ny 
more of [CONTACT_148009]’s patients will be enrolled in this study, stratificati on will cease for 
the last seven participants. Results will be analyzed for the entire [ADDRESS_169582]. Mithoefer's patients and those re ferred by 
[CONTACT_147954][INVESTIGATOR_11437]. The purpose of this sub-analysis is to ga ther 
some information about whether subjects who have already established a therapeutic 
alliance with [CONTACT_148009] prior to the start of the study (his patients) wil l respond more 
favorably than the other subjects. 
 
Data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_147955] (ANOVA), with e xperimental 
intervention condition (MDMA versus placebo) serving as a between-group factor  and 
time of measurement, or experimental session (first or second) serving as  within-subjects 
factors.  Statistical significance will be set at 0.05. Separate analys es will be performed 
for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature , 
Subjective Unit of Distress scores, the CAPS-2, the IES, the SCL-90-R, each RB ANS 
scale score, the PASAT, and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figures Test sco res.  Of these 
measures, it is expected that statistically significant changes wi ll only be detected in heart 
rate and blood pressure and will last several hours when MDMA-assisted psychothera py 
is compared to placebo psychotherapy sessions, but that no other statistically signi ficant 
changes will be detected.  In particular, neurocognitive measures are  not hypothesized to 
suggest potential toxicity in participants receiving MDMA. 
 
The statistics that we will be doing on this project are not complex given the smal l 
sample size.  Analyses will consist of descriptive statistics, inferen tial group 
comparisons, and exploratory correlations.  The first step will be to descriptive ly 
summarize the data.  We will quantitatively characterize the final study  by [CONTACT_147956], including the demographic 
characteristics and outcome variables.  The second phase of the data analysi s will be to 
compare the control group with the experimental group.  We will perform some 
exploratory group comparison analyzes to determine if there are any syst ematic biases in 
the data. This is not expected to be the case, but since this is not a randomized design, the 
possibility exists.  In order to control for this possible confounding effect, we wi ll use co-
variate statistical techniques if a systematic bias does exist.  Anothe r method for 
controlling for any systematic bias is a repeated-measures design wher e subjects will also 
serve  as their own controls.  After the data has been summarized and reviewed, we wil l 
undertake the main statistical analyses.  A series of ANOVA's will be pe rformed on our 
main outcome variables.  This will include the CAPS, Impact of Events, NEO, 
neurocognitive toxicity measures, biochemical markers, etc.  We will be u sing a mixed 
within/between analysis where the control group will be compared to the exper imental 
group and where the subject's baseline will be compared with post treatment score s. We 
will perform exploratory analyses to compare participants who received supple mental 
doses with those who received single doses, and within/between analyses comparing 
PTSD symptoms after the second experimental session and the third, “open label” 
session. We will perform exploratory analyses that will compare the last C APS score 
obtained during participation in Stage 1 and, if applicable, Stage 2, and CAPS score at the

long-term follow-up for any participants assessed at long-term follow-up.  All of these 
analyses will be performed to test for our hypothesized outcomes.  Interactions in t he data 
will also be investigated.  Finally, since this project is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we wil l also perform 
exploratory data analysis in attempt to discover any finding that emerge outs ide of our 
predicted theories. 
 Subjects  
 Who and Why 
 
Participants will be unpaid individuals, male or female, ages [ADDRESS_169583] 
been diagnosed with current PTSD using DSM-IV criteria, including a score of 50 or 
above on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), a recognized measure  of 
PTSD severity.  PTSD was selected for study because it is among the most debi litating of 
conditions for which there is evidence that MDMA may be effective.  There are only  two 
FDA-approved treatment for PTSD (e.g., Zoloft and Paxil) and these treatments  are not 
effective in all patients.  There is therefore a substantial need for improved treatments for 
this debilitating and degenerative illness.   
 
We will recruit twenty subjects who have failed to achieve remission afte r treatment with 
a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor after at least three months, and after  receiving 
psychotherapy lasting for at least six months, with at least twelve psyc hotherapy sessions 
in the course of treatment. We will also accept one veteran whose war related PTS D 
symptoms have lasted from a year to five years and who does not have access to 
conventional treatment or who refuses to undergo conventional treatment. Our intention 
is to recruit participants who, aside from having PTSD, are physically heal thy, as 
confirmed by [CONTACT_147957], and will not be posed untoward risks by 
[CONTACT_147958]. Because of the high co-morbidity of mood and anxiety disorders 
among people with PTSD, it is necessary to include individuals with these additional  
diagnoses (excluding bipolar affective disorder).  As discussed below, we wi ll only 
include persons  who are not taking or can be safely withdrawn from other prescripti on 
medications that might present difficult-to-evaluate risks of drug-drug i nteraction and that 
might confound any findings of therapeutic benefit.   
 Total Number/Number per group 
 
Twenty-one men and women will be recruited for study participation.  The firs t twenty 
who meet inclusion criteria without any exclusion criteria will be included i n the study. 
An additional subject will be a veteran who meets all other initial inclusion crit eria but is 
unable to obtain psychotherapy and is unwilling to undergo pharmacotherapy. Any 
volunteers who drop out or are excluded between the first and the second experimental 
intervention (MDMA or placebo) sessions will be replaced.  Researchers will , 
nevertheless, attempt to collect outcome data on PTSD symptoms, neurocognitive 
function and the experience of being a research subject in drop-outs and excluded 
volunteers.   
 
Because no previous properly-controlled studies have assessed the efficacy of M DMA-
assisted psychotherapy, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_147907] e ffect size this 
experimental intervention so that we may later design a larger, properly-po wered study.

large Phase III trials. 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 
 
Individuals will be included as potential participants if they meet the following 
conditions:   
 
1. Participants must meet DSM IV criteria for current PTSD (within t he past 6 months) in 
response to crime victimization (CR-PTSD), including childhood sexual or physic al 
abuse, or meet criteria for PTSD in response to combat, with the diagnosis las ting no 
more than five years in duration.  A subject would not be excluded for having more 
than one traumatic event, but would be excluded if a non-crime-related or non-
combat-related traumatic event were a significant contributor to the PTSD sy mptoms.  
They must have a CAPS score of [ADDRESS_169584] either: 
a.  have had at least one unsuccessful attempt at treatment with a selective 
serotonin uptake inhibitor (SSRI) and one unsuccessful treatment with any 
form of psychotherapy for which there exist a controlled trial indicating 
efficacy in the treatment of PTSD.  This includes cognitive-behavioral thera py 
(including exposure therapy), stress inoculation training, including anxiety 
management, and insight-oriented psychotherapy (Foa et al. 2003; Jaycox et 
al. 2002; Krupnik 2002; Resick and Schenk 1992). Treatment with an SSRI 
must have lasted for at least three months, and psychotherapy must have 
lasted for six months and included at least twelve sessions.  Treatment will be  
deemed to have been unsuccessful if the participant continues to meet criteria 
for current PTSD following the treatment. 
b.  Be a veteran with PTSD symptoms that have endured for no less than one year 
but no more than f ive years.  One such subject may be included without prior 
treatment if he or she is unwilling or unable to undergo psychotherapy or 
pharmacotherapy. 
3. Participants may also meet criteria for a mood disorder (except bipolar affective 
disorder, see exclusions) and for other anxiety disorders. The inclusion of subjects  
with other mood and anxiety disorders is essential because there is marked freque ncy 
of co-existence of other psychiatric disorders among people with PTSD (Bra dy et al. 
1994; Faustman and White 1989). 
4. Participants must also be willing to commit to medication dosing, experimental 
sessions, and follow-up sessions and to complete evaluation instruments. 
5. Participants must be willing to refrain from taking any psychiatric medica tions during 
the study period, with the exception of gabapentin when prescribed for pain control. 
If they are being treated with psychoactive drugs at the time they are  recruited into 
the study, the prospective participant will be encouraged to discuss medication 
withdrawal with his or her outside treating physician, and will be required to give D r. 
Mithoefer permission to do so as well. The drugs will then be tapered in an 
appropriate fashion to avoid withdrawal effects. They will be discontinued long 
 MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in Chronic PTSD 9/24/0 3, revised -01/23/2009  13

enough before the first MDMA/placebo session to avoid the possibility of any drug-
drug interaction (the interval will be at least 5 times the particular drug's ha lf-life). No 
new medications may be started until after the evaluation session, which will oc cur [ADDRESS_169585] agree that, for one week preceding each MDMA/placebo ses sion: 
c.  They will refrain from taking any herbal supplement (except with prior 
approval of the research team)  
d.  They will not take any nonprescription medications (with the exception of 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen unless with prior 
approval of the research team). 
e.  With the permission of their physician they will not take any prescription 
medications (with the exception of birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], thyroid hormones or 
other medications approved by [CONTACT_5051]). 
8. Participants must agree to take nothing by [CONTACT_120576]-free liquids aft er 
12:00 A.M. (midnight) the evening before each experimental intervention session. 
Participants must also refrain from the use of any psychoactive drug, wit h the 
exception of caffeine or nicotine, within 24 hours of each MDMA/placebo session. 
They must agree not to use caffeine or nicotine for 2 hours before and 6 hours after 
each dose of drug (MDMA or placebo). 
9. Participants must be willing to remain overnight at [CONTACT_148009]'s clinic  after each 
experimental session until the non-drug session occurring the next morning .  An 
attendant will be present  to assist with personal needs if requested and offer dinner 
and breakfast. The attendant will be a registered nurse (RN) and of the same  sex as 
the participant, and he or she will be trained for assisting in this study.  The at tendant 
will be instructed to contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mithoefer at the request of the participant or i f there 
are signs that the participant is under physical or psychological distress. A t the 
participant’s request and with [CONTACT_148009]'s approval, a significant other c an remain 
with the participant for support between the end of the experimental session and the 
non-drug session the next morning. 
10. Participants will be asked to locate an individual willing to drive them home the 
morning after the experimental sessions, after the non-drug therapy session. If a 
participant is unable to locate someone to transport them home, the investigators will 
assist the participant in obtaining transport from the clinic to the participant ’s home or 
any other location where he or she is staying temporarily. 
11. Participants must be willing to be contact[CONTACT_147959] a daily basis by [CONTACT_147960] a week after each experimental session.   
12. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative pregna ncy test and 
must agree to use an effective form of birth control. 
13. Participants must be literate.  They must be proficient in reading documents  written in 
English.   
 
Individuals will be excluded from study participation if they are:

 Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_68020] C Mithoefer. Sponso r: MAPS   
 
1. People who indicate that a non-crime or non-combat related traumatic event is a 
significant contributor to their PTSD symptoms, as assessed by [CONTACT_25905].  
2. Women who are pregnant or nursing, or of child bearing potential and are not 
practicing an effective means of birth control. 
3. People with a history of or current primary psychotic disorder or bipolar affecti ve 
disorder type 1 or borderline personality disorder. 
4. People with dissociative identity disorder or an eating disorder with active purg ing, or 
borderline personality disorder.  
5. People with evidence or history of significant hematological, endocrine, 
cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, coronary, pulmonary, renal, gastrointesti nal, 
immunocompromising, or neurological disease, including seizure disorder. 
(Participants with hypothyroidism who are on adequate and stable thyroid 
replacement will not be excluded). 
6. People with hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, hepatic disease (with or  without 
abnormal liver enzymes), or history of hyponatremia or hyperthermia. 
7. People weighing less than 50 kg or more than 105 kg. 
8. People with prior use of "Ecstasy" (illicit drug preparations purported to cont ain 
MDMA) more than [ADDRESS_169586] Method and Informed Consent Process  
 
Potential participants will be recruited through referrals made by [CONTACT_147961][INVESTIGATOR_11437] (see referral letter), including referrals selec ted from among the patients 
of [CONTACT_148009], and advertisements.  Letters of referral specifical ly request the 
participation of crime victims experiencing symptoms of PTSD.  Prospective par ticipants 
will contact [CONTACT_147962], usually initia lly by 
[CONTACT_756].  Prospective participants will visit the researchers' office, di scuss and review 
the study procedures (including risks, potential benefits, and alternatives) bef ore giving 
written informed consent.  Individuals will be encouraged to ask questions and consider 
their alternatives.  The prospective participant’s comprehension of materia l in the 
informed consent will be assessed through a 16-item quiz administered after the  
prospective participant has read the consent form.  The investigators will addres s any 
misunderstandings identified through incorrect quiz responses, and will use the quiz as  a 
guide for further discussion of the study if necessary.  Potential participant s can include 
current and past patients of the researchers. Subjects from the researchers ’ patient pool 
must have an interview with another psychiatrist not involved in the design or 
administration of the study before engaging in the informed consent process. The 
researchers will be careful when discussing the study with these individuals to e nsure that 
the pre-existing patient-physician relationship does not unduly influence their dec ision 
concerning study participation. It is anticipated that this study will ge nerate widespread 
interest and that potential participants from other regions may be willing to temporarily 
relocate in order to participate in the study.  We will accept no one who, because of 
illness, intelligence, language or cultural differences, appears unable to underst and the

nature and risks of the experiment, or who is unable to read (or, if blind, be read to) and 
follow the informed consent.   
 Screening Process 
 
The 1998 version of the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS: Blake et al. 1 990) 
will be used to provide a DSM-IV CR-PTSD diagnosis.  Individuals with a score of 50 or 
above will be considered eligible for study participation (Weathers et al . 2001). If the 
subject meets DSM-IV PTSD criteria, the rest of the Structured Clinica l Interview for 
Diagnosis  (First et al. 1994) wil7l be administered for the purpose of ruling out 
exclusionary Axis I diagnoses (i.e., exclusion criteria of substance dependenc e, psychotic 
disorder, dissociative disorder, eating disorder, or bipolar disorder).  Relevant module s of 
the SCID II (First et al. 1997) will be administered for the purpose of ruling out  the 
presence of borderline personality disorder, an exclusionary Axis II disorder.   
 
Any subject who appears at imminent risk for trauma and victimization as asse ssed by 
[CONTACT_147963] t he principal 
investigator (PI) or a study co-investigator.  He or she will be counseled in s pecific risk-
reduction strategies, and referred for immediate protection or care as ne eded.  These 
subjects would not be eligible for study participation.  Subjects who do not meet 
eligibility criteria at this point or who do not wish to participate will be refe rred for 
alternative treatment. 
 
There will be no gender exclusions or racial/ethnic exclusions.  Because the inc idence of 
crime related PTSD is higher in women, it is anticipated that a majority of the  subjects 
will be female.  We will attempt to recruit both men and women into this study.  
Similarly, it is anticipated that the racial/ethnic composition will be c lose to that of the 
regional population.  We will attempt to reach individuals of different ethnic or racia l 
backgrounds in our recruitment efforts. 
 
Individuals who meet the psychiatric criteria and agree to participate in the study will 
receive further medical evaluation.  The examination will involve the following 
procedures: general medical history and physical exam, electrocardiogram  (EKG), 
metabolic profile, assessment of serum electrolytes, thyroid hormone levels  and levels of 
TSH, HIV serology and urine pregnancy test for females.  A physician not dir ectly 
involved in administering the therapeutic treatments will perform the medical 
examination.  Results of HIV serology will be kept confidential, and appropria te referral 
for counseling will be made if necessary.   
 
After giving written informed consent to participate in the study, participant s will receive 
information on a separate document concerning videorecording of study sessions. 
Participants can either consent or decline to consent to have their sessions recorde d to 
video.  
 
Study Procedures  
 
Following pre-study evaluation, individuals who meet the study criteria and a gree to 
participate will be scheduled for a baseline assessment battery to be admi nistered within 
[ADDRESS_169587] MDMA session.  They will also be scheduled for the two 
introductory psychotherapy sessions that will occur within this same time peri od. After 
 MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in Chronic PTSD 9/24/0 3, revised -01/23/2009  16 
 Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_68020] C Mithoefer. Sponso r: MAPS   
these sessions, participants will receive MDMA or placebo during two experi mental 
sessions. If both the participant and the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_147910] e and 
appropriate to do so, participants will receive a supplemental dose of 62.5 mg MDMA or 
placebo approximately 2 to 2.5 hours after the initial dose. Experimental sessions w ill be 
followed by [CONTACT_147964]-up sessions and psychotherapy follow-up sessions, as 
described below. 
 Study Outcome Measures 
 
The measures that will be used in the course of this study are listed below.   
 
1. Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, 1998 Revision. (CAPS: Blake et al., 1990). The 
CAPS is a structured clinical interview designed to assess the seventeen 
symptoms of PTSD along with eight associated features.  
2. Impact of Event Scale (IES; Horowitz et al, 1979). The Impact of Event Scale i s a 22-
item self-report scale designed to measure the extent to which a given str essful 
life event produces subjective distress.  
3. Subjective Units of Distress. This is a standardized subjective rating scal e by [CONTACT_9444] a 
subject can quickly rate comfort level throughout the session (l-7 scale).  
4. Symptom Checklist 90-R: This is a standardized instrument used to measure subject ive 
feeling states. It gives subscales on several dimensions.  
5. Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) (Horvath and Greenberg 1989) is a 36-item sel f-
report scale designed to assess the quality of working alliance existing bet ween 
patient and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541].   
6. Reactions to Research Participation-Questionnaire-Short Form (Revised)  (Newman 
and Kaloupek, 2001).  This is a 24-item assessment of participants’ experience of 
study participation, reasons for participation, and perceived costs and benefit s of 
participation.  The measure contains items addressing participation due to 
perceived coercion or undue influence by [CONTACT_473].   
7. Long-term Follow-Up Questionnaire: This is an 11-item questionnaire designe d by [CONTACT_28824] (Michael Mithoefer MD) that assesses presence and 
perceived benefits of study participation, perceived harm from study participat ion, 
commencement of new psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy, and use of ecstasy 
subsequent to study participation. 
 
Neuropsychological Measures that will be used are: 
 
1. The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Stat us (RBANS) 
(Randolph 1997) has two parallel forms, with identical administration but 
different stimulus content, ideal for measuring change in neuropsychological  
status over time.  
2. The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT) (Roman et al. 1991) is a sensiti ve 
measure of information-processing speed and efficiency, concentration skill s, and 
immediate memory which has an extensive literature associated with the ef fects 
of brain dysfunction. 
 3. Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (Mitrushina et al 1999) consists of a complex  two-
dimensional line drawing. The subject's task is to copy the design with pencil on 
paper. The Rey-Osterrieth assesses visuoperceptual skills, spatial orga nizational 
skills and memory.

 Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_68020] C Mithoefer. Sponso r: MAPS   
 4. NEO Personality Inventory (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_14646] 1998). The NEO is a well-established measur e 
of personality with sound properties of reliability and validity that operationally  
define personality structure according to a five-factor model.  
5. Subject Beliefs on Condition Assignment: All subjects will be asked to indicate  
whether they believe they have received MDMA or placebo during the 
experimental sessions.  
 
Safety Monitoring Measures that will be used are: 
 
1. Automated blood pressure and pulse monitoring equipment 
2. Thermometer for reading body temperature at regular intervals. 
3. Subjective Units of Distress, a 1-item self-report measure of subjective ex perience of 
degree of distress, with responses given via 7-point likert scale, with this short 
measure administered repeatedly throughout the MDMA/placebo session. 
4. Standard assay of liver enzymes (“liver panel”), assessed with blood sampled a t follow 
up after the second MDMA/placebo session, as a means of detecting changes in 
liver function. 
 
As noted in discussing the specific hypotheses of the proposed study, the CAPS will 
serve as a primary outcome measure, and the IES and SCL-90-R serve as sec ondary 
outcome measures.  All measures of neurocognitive function and the NEO serve as 
means of safety evaluation.   
 
The Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) is intended to assess a process variable  
(therapeutic alliance) that may be related to efficacy. The Subjective  Units of Distress 
(SUD) will also be administered in order to assess a process variable, subjec t comfort 
level throughout the experimental session. The Reactions to Research Participa tion-
Questionnaire-Short Form (Revised), another measure of a process variable, wil l be 
administered at the final follow-up to evaluate subject reactions to the study i tself. The 
long-term follow-up questionnaire will be administered to assess any positive or  negative 
effects of study participation and use of ecstasy subsequent to study participat ion. 
 
Baseline Assessment  
 
A battery of psychological and diagnostic assessments will be performed during t he two 
weeks prior to the first experimental session in order to provide baseline measure s of 
PTSD symptomatology, mood state and global functioning.  All study measures 
described above, except WAI and the measure of subject beliefs on condition assignme nt, 
will be administered during baseline assessments. 
 
Non-Experimental Psychotherapy Sessions  
 
Following the initial screening and data collection at baseline, all subjects  will receive 
two ninety-minute introductory sessions with the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. The WAI will be 
administered during the second introductory psychotherapy session. There will the n be 
two individual experimental sessions conducted 3-5 weeks apart, each lasting 
approximately six to eight hours depending upon the participant's response.  Three or 
four sixty to ninety-minute non-drug psychotherapy sessions will be conducted in the  
time intervening between the two experimental sessions.   Participants wil l also see the 
investigators in a ninety-minute follow up session a day after each experimenta l session, 
 MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in Chronic PTSD 9/24/0 3, revised -01/23/2009  18 
 Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_68020] C Mithoefer. Sponso r: MAPS   
and in two or three more psychotherapy sessions after the second experimental (M DMA 
or placebo) session but before the study has been completed.  A final psychotherapy 
session will occur at the time of the final research follow-up two months from the s econd 
experimental session.  
 
Non-drug psychotherapy sessions will be recorded to video and audio. These recording s 
will be used for manual development and potentially for training therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147911] m 
MDMA-assisted therapy. They are intended to record the events occurring duri ng 
therapy, and will not serve as outcome measures. Full names and addresses, if the y 
appear in these recordings, will be edited out of the recording before the tape is se en by 
[CONTACT_147965]. Facial 
images will not be removed from the video tapes to be viewed by [CONTACT_147966] .  
However face shots will be obscured on any tapes used for training purposes unless the 
subject gives his or her written permission (via "Video and  Audio Use Permission I C”) 
to retain face shots (for more details of recording, see Appendix B). 
 
The attendant referred to above will be an RN, will always be of the same sex as  the 
subject he or she will be staying with, and will be trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mithoefer to be  on duty 
at the office following each experimental session.  The attendants will be sel ected for 
their ability to act as reliable and compassionate attendants to the study subj ects, and to 
recognize when to call [CONTACT_148009] in the event that a subject is experienc ing physical 
or emotional distress during the night following an experimental session.  A neces sary 
quality for these individuals will be the ability to tolerate being in the prese nce of other 
people’s emotions without becoming emotionally reactive themselves. Attendants  will be 
taught to be attentive to the subject's needs for food or liquids, and to offer 
companionship by [CONTACT_147967] a walk according to the subject's desir es.  
They will be instructed to listen compassionately if the subject wants to tal k, but not to 
attempt to interpret the subject's experiences or otherwise act as thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].  The emphasis 
will be on listening rather than talking and on being quietly present.  The attendant will  
be taught to avoid initiating long conversations with the subject or being intrusive i n any 
way on the subject's experience, other than to inquire about their physical or emotiona l 
needs and their comfort. This role will be further described below under 
Psychotherapeutic Procedures during Experimental Session. 
 
Sessions Employing the Experimental Intervention  
 Drugs and Dosing 
 
Twelve individuals will receive [ADDRESS_169588] a 60% chance of receiving [ADDRESS_169589] been well-tolerated in previous studies of MDMA in humans (Cami et al, 2000; 
Freedman et al. 2005; Grob et al, In preparation; Harris et al. 2002; Lester et a l. 2000; 
Mas et al, 1999; Tancer et al, 2001; Tancer et al. 2003; Vollenweider et al. 1998). The 
supplemental dose of 62.5 mg was chosen on the basis of prior reports of such doses 
extending potentially therapeutic effects of MDMA in psychotherapy (Stola roff 2004) 
and in an uncontrolled study (Greer and Tolbert 1986). The cumulative dose of 187.5 mg 
 MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in Chronic PTSD 9/24/0 3, revised -01/23/2009  19 
 Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_68020] C Mithoefer. Sponso r: MAPS   
has been exceeded by [CONTACT_147968] (Grob et al., unpublished see p. 52 of initial submission to FDA, IND #63,384). 
MDMA will be supplied by [CONTACT_147969], Ph.D., Department of Medicinal Chemistry 
and Pharmacognosy, Purdue University.  This MDMA is of confirmed identity and purity  
and has been used in all three Phase I clinical trials conducted in the United Stat es.   
 
Currently three studies of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy will use supplement al dosing. 
This includes two studies of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in people with PTSD. One  
study is to take place in Israel and has gained final approval from the Israe li Ministry of 
Health, an Israeli ethics committee, and the Israeli Anti-Drug Authori ty. The other study 
will take place in Switzerland. The protocol and informed consent have gained full 
approval from the local ethics board and the protocol design has obtained approval from 
the national health agency Swissmedic, with only the supply of MDMA remaining t o be 
approved.  Additionally, in December 2004, FDA permitted a study of MDMA-assisted 
psychotherapy in people experiencing anxiety as a result of advanced-stage  cancer and 
short estimated life expectancy that will use supplemental dosing. 
 
Condition assignment will be randomized. The first thirteen participants have been 
stratified prior to randomization according to whether or not they have been [CONTACT_148010]'s patients, but owing to the low likelihood of many other patients of [CONTACT_148010]’s being enrolled in the study, the last seven participants will not be s tratified. 
The blind will be broken for each subject upon completion of the study. If there is an 
adverse event or other emergency, the blind may be broken for an individual participant.   
 
All experimental (MDMA or placebo) sessions will begin at 10:[ADDRESS_169590] had nothing by [CONTACT_120576]-free liquids since 12:[ADDRESS_169591] consumed caffeine or nicotine for tw o 
hours before or six hours after drug administration. They will be asked to arrive at  9:[ADDRESS_169592] not recently ingested any medications (including herbal, over -the-
counter, or prescription) that are not approved by [CONTACT_147970].  After preliminary measurements (described in Monitoring for Acute T oxicity 
below) have been made and the researchers have discussed goals for this sess ion and 
general procedures, participants will ingest gelatin capsules containi ng drug or placebo 
along with a glass of water. Subjects will remain overnight in the clinic unti l after the 
non-drug psychotherapy session the next morning.  A subject’s decision to withdraw 
from the study at any time will be respected as is accepted practice in hum an research. In 
the event of withdrawal during an experimental session the subject will not be per mitted 
to leave the clinic until [CONTACT_148009] has assured that he or she is in a safe and st able 
condition.  Rules of withdrawal apply to the entire [ADDRESS_169593] in finding transport from the clinic.

 Measures during Experimental Intervention Session 
 
Measures made during the experimental sessions are primarily made for  safety 
monitoring and are described below for “Monitoring for Toxicity.”  In addition, the 
investigators will make audio and video recordings of each experimental sessi on.  
Comparison of information gathered from these recordings may be qualitatively or  
quantitatively examined in an attempt to gain a better understanding of the effect s of 
MDMA within a psychotherapeutic context, but the recordings themselves wil l not be 
treated as outcome measures. Audio and video recordings will be used for manual 
development and potentially for training therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147912]-assiste d therapy. 
For more details on audio and video recordings, see Appendix B. 
 Psychotherapeutic Procedures during Experimental Session 
 
The MDMA or placebo sessions will be supervised and facilitated by [CONTACT_1961], male investigator/psychiatrist (Michael C. Mithoefer MD.)  accompanied by 
[CONTACT_147971] (Ann T. Mithoefer.).  Both Michael a nd Ann 
Mithoefer will be present throughout the sessions. The sessions will be conducted 
following the principles developed by [CONTACT_147972], MD for LSD psychotherap y (Grof, 
1980, pp. 123-147) and for Holotropic Breathwork (Grof 2000: pp. 178-183) and adapted 
for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy by [CONTACT_147973] (Metz ner and 
Adamson 2001; Greer and Tolbert 1998).  Both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147913], and have years of experience wor king 
therapeutically with this model in non-drug Holotropic Breathwork sessions. The 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_147914].  More detail on the 
psychotherapeutic approach to be used in this protocol can be found in a treatment 
manual draft for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (Ruse et al. 2002).  The protocols wil l 
be exactly the same for each experimental session.  
 
At the beginning of the session, the researchers will discuss with the subject hi s or her 
intentions for the session, including intentions regarding working with psychological  
issues related to their PTSD. After the session begins, subjects will recline  in a 
comfortable position with eyes closed or wearing eyeshades if preferred. T hey will listen 
to a program of music designed to support their experience by [CONTACT_147974]. (Bonny and Savary 1990; Grof 2000: pp.186-191; Grof 1980; Unkefer 1990).  
After the first hour, if the participant has not spoken spontaneously, the investigators w ill 
check in with him/her about the nature of the experience. Approximately [ADDRESS_169594] in order to allow for the further 
unfolding of the inner experience.

Electrolyte containing fluids will be available ad lib throughout the session wi thin the 
limits described in “Monitoring for Toxicity."  Food will be available during t he latter 
part of the session.  Foods provided will include crackers or bread, fruit and vegetables , 
and soups. After the conclusion of the session, dinner will be made available by [CONTACT_147975], with breakfast offered the next morning. 
 
After approximately eight hours, if all medical parameters are accept able and the subject 
is alert, ambulatory and emotionally stable, the session will be ended.  During the la st 30 
- 60 minutes of the session, the attendant (an RN) will join the investigators and the 
subject in order to become familiar with the subject's state of mind, and any wis hes the 
subject might have in the way of food or activity during the evening.  If the subjec t so 
desires, an additional designated support person (a spouse, partner, relative or fri end) 
may join in this meeting.  After the researchers leave (when they have judged t he subject 
to be emotionally and medically stable), the subject will spend the rest of the evenin g and 
night in [CONTACT_148009]'s offices where he or she will have a private room to sl eep in. The 
room will be an office designated for that purpose and will be furnished with comfortabl e 
furniture and a sofa-bed. All records pertaining to the study and any other sensit ive 
material will be securely stored in a separate area of the clinic. The  attendant will be on 
duty during this time and will have a separate room in which to rest.  The clinic has  a 
kitchen with eating area, two bathrooms, several offices, and a yard with an outdoor  table 
and chairs.  Since the office is in a quiet, attractive area, the subject, accompa nied by [CONTACT_147975], may spend time in the yard, walk in the neighborhood to enjoy nature.  
Subjects will, however, be encouraged to use much of the time for rest and for a period of 
reflection and integration in a quiet atmosphere.  The subject may request that a spous e, 
partner or friend also remain with them during the night, but this must be approved by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Mithoefer after he has met this support person and has discussed the possible advantages  
and pi[INVESTIGATOR_147915]. 
 
During the night following the experimental session, [CONTACT_148009] will be at  home 
within ten minutes drive of the office, and the attendant will be instructed to call him  if 
the subject is experiencing emotional difficulties or any other problems.  [CONTACT_148011] thoefer 
will be willing to return to the office to meet additional needs or provide requested 
support to the subject, and will be available throughout the night of the experimental 
session.  (At all other times during the study the principal investigat[INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a c overing 
psychiatrist familiar with the study will be on call [ADDRESS_169595] with a pager number to call immediately if any problems occur.)   
 
When the researchers return to meet with the subject for the scheduled ninety-minut e 
therapy session occurring on the following morning, the attendant will go off duty.  A fter 
this psychotherapy session, a person previously selected by [CONTACT_147976]  a ride 
home. If the subject is unable to locate an individual willing or able to take them hom e, 
or if the designated person is unable to assist the subject due to unforeseen events, the  
investigators will assist the subject in finding an alternative means of re turning home. 
 
Starting on the day of the non-drug psychotherapy session following each experimenta l 
session, one of the investigators will contact [CONTACT_147977] a daily basi s for 
one week. The investigators will use clinical judgment to assess the psychologic al well-
being of the subject during this period of time.  If there are any indications of cont inuing

anxiety or distress, the investigators may arrange to work on reducing the  distress at a 
specially scheduled  non-drug therapy session, through continuing contact, or at the next  
regularly scheduled non-drug therapy session.  The subject may also initiate conta ct with 
the investigators at any time throughout the study.     
 Monitoring for Toxicity 
 
There is now a considerable body of information indicating that the likelihood of 
significant toxicity from the doses of MDMA used in this kind of setting is very low .  
Phase [ADDRESS_169596] failed to demonstrate 
toxicity (Cami et al. 2000; Grob et al. 1996; Harris et al. 2002; Lester et al. 2000; L iechti 
et al. 2001; Mas et al. 1999; Tancer and Johanson 2001; Vollenweider et al. 1998).  
Doses of up to 2.5 mg/kg were employed in one of the studies conducted in the US (Grob 
et al., In Preparation), with eight subjects receiving doses equal to or exceedi ng the dose 
of 125 mg proposed in this study. In another US Phase I study (personal communication, 
Tancer, 2001), over twenty subjects were administered doses larger than 125 mg.  
 
Likewise, psychiatrists in the US and Europe reported using MDMA in a large number  of 
patients before the drug was made illegal.  The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147916]-assisted psychotherapy  sessions 
(Adamson 1985; Greer and Tolbert 1986; Gasser 1994; Metzner and Adamson 2001; 
Widmer 1997).  
 
A controlled study of the effects of two doses of 100 mg MDMA given four hours apart 
failed to report any adverse events (Pacifici et al. 2002), and an uncontrolled 
psychotherapy study employed supplemental doses frequently half the size of a n initial 
dose (Greer and Tolbert). Anecdotal accounts of psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_147917]-assisted psychotherapy prior to its scheduling indicate that supplementa l dosing 
was used (Stolaroff 2004).  
 
Although serious untoward reactions are unlikely, the researchers will closel y and 
continuously monitor participants during experimental sessions. To date, there have bee n 
no adverse events requiring the assistance of an additional emergency medicine  physician 
occurring during any of the [ADDRESS_169597] five hours of each experimental session. The investigat or, 
assisting investigator, and emergency medicine nurse will provide a team of one  
experienced emergency physician and two registered nurses to respond in the unli kely 
event of a medical emergency.

Blood pressure and pulse will be measured at the outset of each experimental ses sion, 
once every [ADDRESS_169598] stabilized at a level judge d by [CONTACT_147978]. Body temperature will be measured at the outset an d then hourly 
for 6 hours.  The physician may also call for more frequent measurements in the event o f 
clinically significant changes.  The SUD (a brief self-report measur e of volunteer 
distress) will be repeated at 60-[ADDRESS_169599] 
emergency room.  The office will be equipped with a "crash cart" containing t he 
emergency drugs and equipment necessary to respond to any complications.  Bena dryl, 
injectable epi[INVESTIGATOR_147918]-site as a means of treating any potential allergic react ions or other medical 
emergencies.  Available emergency medications include antihypertensi ve agents (such as 
nitroprusside and labetolol), pressor agents, anxiolytics, and intravenous fluids. In 
addition to drugs, the crash cart will contain a defibrillator (with telemetry  capability), an 
oxygen tank, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) device, a suction device, a puls e 
oxometer, an IVAC pump and intubation equipment (including laryngoscope, and 
endotracheal tubes).  We will have equipment for placing an arterial line and m onitoring 
arterial pressure.  The researchers have established (in communication w ith the FDA) 
contingency plans for responding to those adverse events that appear most likely, bas ed 
on a comprehensive review of case reports of toxicity in illicit MDMA users re ported in 
the Investigator’s Brochure (See Appendix).  With these personnel and equipment , the 
researchers would be able to stabilize a subject in the office and then transport t hem by 
[CONTACT_147979][INVESTIGATOR_147919].  The researchers have contact [CONTACT_147980], in 2001, the averag e 
response time for an ambulance to arrive at a location in the sector where the r esearch 
will be conducted was [ADDRESS_169600] Cooper 
Medical Center Emergency Room should take no more than 10 minutes. 
 
An assay of the liver enzyme ALT will be performed at research follow-up four da ys 
after the second MDMA/placebo session so as to detect any change or decline i n liver 
function.  Participants will be closely monitored for any change in emotional or cog nitive 
function in the weeks following each session employing the experimental interve ntion.   
 
Written notice will be given to the IRB and the FDA within five days of the occurren ce 
of a life-threatening adverse event, and within [ADDRESS_169601] (DSMB) will be composed of three individuals, a t 
least one of whom is psychiatrist and another a psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. The DSMB will have  
scheduled meetings after the first five subjects have completed their fi rst experimental 
sessions, again after these same subjects have completed  their final follow -ups, after 
subjects 6-[ADDRESS_169602] 
completed their final follow-ups. DSMB meetings will also be held to review ever y 
report of a serious adverse event, or more frequently if the DSMB so chooses. After e ach

meeting, the DSMB will present a report to the sponsor, the IRB and the FDA 
recommending whether the study should be continued as is, modified, or halted. Any new 
findings deemed relevant to study participation will be communicated to each potentia l 
participant during informed consent. 
 
We feel that these precautions and the contingency plans described in the appendix  
represent a very cautious approach to the remote possibility of a serious compli cation. 
 
Research Follow Up  
 
The follow-up will begin [ADDRESS_169603] experimental (MDMA or pl acebo) 
session.  There will be a total of three research follow-up interviews.  The fir st two will 
be done [ADDRESS_169604] no involvement in the experimental sessions and will be blinded to what 
occurs during the sessions.  A research follow-up will also be done at two months aft er 
the second experimental session.  The measures of cognitive function administer ed 
during baseline (RBANS, PASAT and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure) will be 
administered again at the last research follow-up, and the measures of PTSD s ymptoms 
will be administered again.   
 
The research and experimental intervention aspects of this project will be kept a s separate 
and distinct as possible. [CONTACT_148012], the psychologist obtaining all information gat hered 
during research follow-up, will not be involved in monitoring the subjects during the 
experimental sessions, and will, therefore, be naïve to complaints of medication s ide 
effects.  He will also be blind to whether participants have been assigned to the M DMA 
or placebo condition.   
 
Participants will also be reassessed for psychological and physical sta tus by [CONTACT_24201]-investigator immediately following this session and weekly fo r at least 3 weeks 
after each session.   
 
Participants’ reasons for consenting to participate in the study, their exper ience during 
and after participation and perceived costs and benefits of participating will  be assessed 
during the final research follow-up through the RRPQ, a self-report measure  of responses 
to research participation.  Responses to this measure will be examined throughout the  
study to determine whether participants feel that they were unduly influe nced or coerced 
into participating, and further actions will be taken to reduce undue influence if it i s 
consistently detected through RRPQ responses.  
 
At the end of the study, participants will be asked to complete and sign a video recordin g 
permission form regarding whether or not they will allow people in sponsor's traini ng 
program for teaching MDMA-assisted therapy to view video recordings of their s ession, 
with our without identifying information.

Therapy Follow-up  
 
Participants will see the investigators one day after each of the two exper imental 
(MDMA or placebo) sessions.  During these 90-minute follow-up sessions, participants 
will be encouraged to describe their experiences during the experimental ses sions and to 
freely express any thoughts, feelings, questions or concerns they have.  The WAI , the 
measure of quality of working alliance administered during the second introductory  
session, will be administered again at each therapy follow-up session.  Partici pants will 
also be asked to indicate whether they believe they received MDMA or placebo at  each 
follow-up session.  The primary purpose of these sessions will be to support the 
participant in further processing, understanding and integrating of the experie nce.  It will 
also be an opportunity for the investigators to gather information, in an unstructured 
format, about the effects of MDMA or placebo and to provide data with which to 
evaluate after the conclusion of the study whether the blind was maintained for  subjects. 
 
Third Open-Label Experimental Session  
 
After each participant has completed the Visit [ADDRESS_169605], as per previous revisions of the protocol.  
 
• If a subject has received MDMA and has undergone both experimental sessions 
without any clinically significant adverse event, then the subject will be offer ed 
participation in a third, open-label, MDMA-assisted experimental session. 
Procedures for this third MDMA-assisted session will be the same as in the f irst 
two experimental sessions, except that all participants will receive MDM A. 
Subjects will undergo a therapy follow-up session 24 hours after the open-label 
MDMA-assisted therapy session identical to therapy-follow-up sessions oc curring 
after other experimental sessions. Subsequently there will be two additional non -
drug psychotherapy sessions scheduled to occur approximately one and two 
weeks after the MDMA-assisted session to facilitate integration of mat erial 
arising during the open-label session. These non-drug therapy sessions will foll ow 
procedures identical to those described for previous non-drug therapy sessions, 
except that participants will not complete the process measure of therapeutic  
alliance. All outcome measures will be administered two months after the open-
label MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session, including CAPS, IES and SCL90R. 
For the reasons detailed below, neurocognitive assessments will not be 
administered again.  
• Participants who receive placebo and enroll in the open-label continuation (“Stage 
2”) described below will be offered a third open-label session unless the 
investigators believe it is contraindicated or the participant declines. The t hird 
session will take place four to six weeks after the second open-label MDMA 
session. It will be preceded by [CONTACT_147981]-acquaint the 
participant with study procedures, and it will be followed by [CONTACT_105]-drug 
psychotherapy follow-ups [ADDRESS_169606] MDMA 
session. In both cases, PTSD symptoms will be assessed four to six weeks after 
the second MDMA session.”

Open Label Continuation for Placebo Subjects  
 
Participants who received placebo during the course of the study may enroll in an open-
label continuation of the study wherein they will undergo three MDMA-assisted 
psychotherapy sessions and a continued course of therapy follow-up sessions. 
Participants will give written informed consent to take part in this second stage  of the 
study, with consent given separately from the initial consent. If the parti cipant consents to 
take part in this open-label continuation (or “Stage 2”) of the study, he or she would 
undergo three experimental sessions with an initial dose of [ADDRESS_169607] and second MDMA experi mental 
sessions, and two non-drug psychotherapy sessions occurring within 3 weeks of the 
second MDMA experimental session. The final outcome measures from Visit 17 in the  
initial study would serve as baseline measures for the second stage (the ope n-label 
continuation), and outcome measures would not be repeated until two months after the 
second experimental session in the second stage of the study. An exception to this would 
be situations in which more than [ADDRESS_169608] passed between visit 17 and visit 18 (the 
first experimental session in the open-label continuation).  In this case outcome  measures 
would be repeated in visit 17.[ADDRESS_169609] experimental  
session. Non-experimental and experimental sessions will be recorded to audio and 
video. These recordings will be used for manual development and potentially for traini ng 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147912]-assisted therapy. Full names and addresses are  unlikely to 
appear on the video or audio tapes. However, if they do, they will be edited out. Face 
shots will not be excised from recordings viewed by [CONTACT_147982]. (For 
more details on recording, see Appendix B.) Due to generally high scores found so far  in 
participants completing Stage 1, the WAI, a process measure of therapeutic a lliance, will 
not be administered again during Stage 2. Since performing a third neurocognitive 
examination is costly, and three forms do not exist for the RBANS so performance c ould 
reflect a learning curve produced from prior experience with the measures, 
neurocognitive function will not be assessed for a third time on the final follow-up.  
 
If, after the second open-label session of Stage 2, the subject has undergone both 
MDMA-assisted sessions without any clinically significant adverse eve nts, then he or she 
will be offered participation in a third, open-label, MDMA-assisted experime ntal session. 
Procedures for this third session will be the same as for the previous two as descr ibed 
above. The third MDMA-assisted session will be scheduled four to six weeks after t he 
second MDMA-assisted session. Follow-up non-drug psychotherapy visits will also be  
identical in procedure to previous psychotherapy follow-ups, including a non-drug 
therapy session occurring 24 hours after the MDMA-assisted session, and two non-drug

psychotherapy sessions, as described above.  Repeat outcome measures will be 
administered two months after the third MDMA-assisted session.

Costs to Participants.   
 
There will be no costs to the study participants.  The sponsor will cover all costs of  study 
participation.  Charges for treatment of the participant’s condition that are  unrelated to 
the research study or any of its procedures will continue to be billed to the health 
insurance provider of the participant or to the participant him or herself.  It is anti cipated 
that there will not be any charges for treatment that is unrelated to the stud y except in the 
case of participants who previously received therapy from the principal inves tigator and 
who will continue to receive ongoing treatment that is not related to participating  in the 
study.   
 
Treatment and Compensation of Study Related Injury  
 
Treatment of a study-related emergency would first be billed to a partici pant’s health 
insurance provider.  The sponsor will cover any direct costs relating to the treat ment of a

Risks to Participants  
 Risks and Discomforts Associated with Drawing Blood 
 
Blood specimens will be obtained from the subjects during the evaluation and follow-ups 
as listed above. Temporary discomfort may arise as a result of sampling blood.   
Participants may experience temporary discomfort at the blood drawing site .  There is 
also a remote possibility of inflammation or infection at the blood drawing site .  Blood 
samples will be used for the most part to determine whether the participant is he althy and 
can safely take part in the study.  Hence the temporary discomfort is outweig hed by [CONTACT_147984], meet all inclusion criteria at s creening, and 
are not experiencing adverse effects after the MDMA or placebo sessions.   
 Risks and Discomforts Associated with Screening Procedure 
 
Medical data will be collected via history and physical examination, and via 
measurement of vital signs.  Submitting to a full medical examination may be ti me 
consuming, and may be distressing or uncomfortable for some.  Because medical 
examinations are part of the screening procedure, they cannot be omitted from the st udy 
design.   
 
Psychological and neuropsychological data will be obtained through interview s and 
neuropsychological testing.  Because these interviews require individuals to di scuss their 
condition, they may prove upsetting for some.  Because psychiatric interviews and 
discussion of PTSD symptoms are used during screening, they cannot be avoided.  The 
investigators have experience working with people with PTSD, and they will se ek to 
reduce anxiety and distress during these interviews.   
 
Risks and Discomforts Associated with Non-Experimental and Experime ntal 
Psychotherapy 
 
During non-drug and experimental sessions, participants will be asked to think about and 
discuss their thoughts and emotions relating to the traumatic event or events.  They m ay 
experience intense emotional responses to recalling and speaking about this ma terial.  
Even in a therapeutic context, thinking about and discussing the trauma, symptoms 
related to the trauma or the effects of PTSD on life function can produce distress dur ing 
and immediately after non-experimental and experimental sessions.  Psycho therapy is 
conducted as part of the research study, including the experimental intervention ( MDMA-
assisted psychotherapy), and people undergoing psychotherapy are expected to c onfront 
unpleasant thoughts, feelings and memories in the process of therapy.  Because 
psychotherapy is an integral part of the research study design, the potential di stress 
arising from psychotherapy is unavoidable.   
 Risks and Discomforts Associated with the Experimental Intervent ion 
 
In doses similar to those proposed for this study, MDMA produces sympathomimetic 
effects similar to the effects of a moderate dose of methamphetamine or other s timulants 
(Cami et al. 2000; Grob et al. In Preparation; Grob et al. 1996; Harris et al. 2002; Les ter 
et al. 2000; Liechti et al. 2001a; Tancer et al. 2002; Vollenweider et al. 1998).  The 
 MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in Chronic PTSD 9/24/0 3, revised -01/23/2009  30 
 Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_68020] C Mithoefer. Sponso r: MAPS   
amount of MDMA used in this study is not likely to produce changes in blood pressure or 
heart rate greater than 40% of resting values.  These changes should last no m ore than six 
hours.  These changes have been well-tolerated by [CONTACT_147985], who have been carefully screened for 
cardiovascular and related problems.  In less than 5% of volunteers, increases in blood 
pressure were higher.  Clinical intervention was not required in any of these ca ses.  
Nonetheless, careful monitoring of participants and predefined contingency plans w ill 
allow the researchers to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_147920] y. 
 
MDMA also may produce mild alterations in perception and altered perception of tim e 
(Cami et al. 2000; Vollenweider et al. 1998).  Women may be more sensitive to these 
effects of MDMA (Liechti et al 2001a).  Some participants receiving MDMA r eport 
experiencing periods of increased anxiety (Harris et al. 2002; Tancer and Johanson 2001; 
Vollenweider et al. 1998).  Psychological distress could arise at any time  after the onset 
of the effects of MDMA, from the first indications of drug effects until the la st effects 
have dissipated (approximately 3 to 5 hours after drug administration).  Anxiet y or 
distress may last for as little as [ADDRESS_169613] that dif ficult 
emotions, including grief, rage and fear or panic, may arise during the MDMA se ssions 
and should be understood as presenting an opportunity for addressing and dealing with 
these traumatic events.  If significant anxiety persists more than a few  hours after the 
expected end of the experimental session, contingency plans (described in appendix) 
include the continued presence of the investigators, support and assistance provided by [CONTACT_147986], and the possibility of administering anti-anxie ty 
agents. 
  
Side effects of MDMA are modest and generally have not been associated wi th serious 
discomfort by [CONTACT_147987] (Cami et al. 2000; Liechti et al 2001a; 
Tancer 2001; Vollenweider et al. 1998).  Decreased appetite, jaw clenching, and dry 
mouth are commonly reported during peak MDMA effects, while fatigue may be  felt up 
to several days afterward. Less commonly, mild anxiety and depressed mood ar e reported 
one and three days after MDMA administration (Harris et al. 2002; Liechti et a l. 2001a; 
Liechti et al. 2000b; Liechti and Vollenweider 2000a; b; Vollenweider et al. 1998).  
Some of these effects are very likely to occur, but proper preparation and follow-up 
support will reduce the difficulties participants might have with acute or sub -acute side 
effects, so that they will not be unduly troubled by [CONTACT_476].   
 
MDMA may produce modest changes in immune functioning, lasting two to three days. 
A research team in Spain has studied the immunological effects appearing af ter the 
administration of one or two doses of 100 mg MDMA (Pacifici et al. 2000; Pacifici et a l. 
2001).  They reported a decline in CD4 cells, smaller CD4/CD8 ratio, attenuated 
lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogen, and an increase in natural killer ( NK) 
cells, with effects diminishing but still detectable 24 hours after drug admi nistration.  
MDMA decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-2 and 
interferon-Gamma and increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, i ncluding 
IL-4 and IL-10.  Generally, MDMA appeared to decrease the concentration of T h1

cytokines and increase the amount of Th2 cytokines measured in blood. The mechanism 
of this MDMA-induced immunomodulation is unclear but may involve MDMA-induced 
glucocorticoid release or sympathomimetic activity.  Changes of simil ar magnitude and 
duration have been previously noted after ingestion of other psychoactive agents, such a s 
alcohol or cocaine (Pacifici et al. 2000; Pacifici et al. 2001). Because of their lim ited 
duration, these changes are not likely to have clinical significance beyond a poss ibly 
increased risk of the common cold or similar illness for several days.  Previous Phas e I 
studies have not reported any indication of increased risk of illness occurring afte r 
MDMA administration.  Individuals who are positive for HIV or have other 
immunocompromising diseases will be excluded from the protocol. 
 
MDMA may cause modest changes in cerebral blood flow lasting several weeks af ter 
drug exposure.  These changes have been hypothesized to be the result of short-term 
down-regulation of serotonergic receptors controlling cerebral vasodilatation ( Reneman 
et a. 2002; Reneman et al. 2000).  MDMA induced decreased regional and global 
cerebral blood flow (CBF) 10 to 21 days after administration (Chang et al. 2000), as 
reported in a study of 10 ecstasy users given two separate ascending doses of M DMA at a 
two-week interval, with comparisons made at baseline and after the administrati on of 
both doses.  Doses per administration in this study ranged from approximately 17 mg  
(0.25 mg/kg) to approximately 175 mg (2.5 mg/kg).  The authors did not find differences 
in regional or global CBF when 21 MDMA-experienced volunteers (with a reported 211 
± 340 exposures) were compared to 21 nonusers (data are presented in the same paper), 
suggesting that effects on CBF do not last indefinitely.  There are no known 
consequences of these changes and neurocognitive performance was not altered in thes e 
volunteers.  
 
Serious MDMA toxicity is rare even in uncontrolled settings, considering the m illions of 
users taking ecstasy of unknown identity, potency, and purity (Baggott, 2002; see 
Investigator’s Brochure). Many users routinely consume estimated MDMA  doses that are 
several times higher than those proposed in the current protocol without any appare nt 
toxicity. Under unsupervised and nonmedical conditions, the most common serious 
adverse event involves hyperthermia, which often appears to be influenced by [CONTACT_147988] (dancing) and other unsafe conditions of use, such as high ambient  
temperature. In addition to hyperthermic syndromes, other rare adverse events inc lude 
dysphoric responses, hyponatremia, and hepatotoxicity. In the proposed clinical s tudy, 
volunteers will be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of these unlikely eve nts.  
Contingency plans for responding to these events are described in an appendix.   
 
Risks posed by [CONTACT_147989].  One of two studies of ecstasy 
users suggests that use of ecstasy and other drugs during pregnancy may be associa ted 
with some abnormalities at birth, but the meaning of these findings are in dispute. 
Women who are able to bear children will be required to use effective contracept ion 
during the study and pregnant women will be excluded from participation, with 
pregnancy tests performed before each drug administration. 
 
MDMA is classified as a Schedule I compound, largely on the basis of its growing 
popularity at night clubs and parties in the early to mid-1980s.  Whether or not MDMA’s 
abuse potential will negatively affect people with PTSD exposed to MDMA when g iven 
along with psychotherapy is an open question for which there is no direct data.  Howeve r, 
instead of experiencing euphoria, people with PTSD undergoing MDMA-assisted

psychotherapy during the experimental sessions are likely to experience pa inful and 
frightening emotions and memories related to the original traumatic incident .  As a result, 
it seems unlikely that people with PTSD undergoing this emotionally challengin g 
experimental intervention will find the experience pleasurable or safe enough t o pursue 
MDMA use in unsupervised and uncontrolled settings.   
 
There is no evidence that MDMA-naïve healthy volunteers exposed to MDMA in 
previous Phase [ADDRESS_169614] been motivated to seek out and use MDMA in non-
medical settings.  For example, Liechti et al. (2001) reviewed the effects  of MDMA in 54 
male and 20 female volunteers who had participated in clinical studies.  Liechti a nd 
colleagues stated that “none of the participants expressed any interest in t aking MDMA 
as a recreational drug” after participation in an MDMA study.   
 
There is known to be significant comorbidity for substance abuse among individuals with 
PTSD, though specific data on the relationship between MDMA use and PTSD have not 
been reported. Currently, there is no definite evidence concerning the causal r elations 
between the two disorders, and it is unclear whether PTSD precipi[INVESTIGATOR_147921]-existing substance abuse are at greater ri sk for PTSD.  The 
most commonly accepted hypothesis for the relationship between PTSD and subst ance 
abuse is that of self-medication (Meisler, 1996).  Since individuals undergoing the 
proposed experimental intervention will be encouraged to confront traumatic events 
during the experimental intervention rather than defending against them or avoiding 
them, it seems likely that these individuals will subsequently be less incline d to choose to 
self-medicate through the self-administration of MDMA.  
 
In the currently proposed study, diversion is not an issue because MDMA will only be  
administered under supervision of a psychiatrist and no take-home doses will be 
permitted.  MDMA will be handled following all regulations pertaining to the ha ndling 
and dispensing of controlled substances within research studies.   
 Potential Neurotoxicity Associated with Ecstasy Use 
 
Extensive studies in animals indicate that high or repeated dose MDMA exposure ca n 
damage serotonergic axons originating in the dorsal raphe nucleus of the 
brainstem, probably as a result of oxidative stress, and this damage is associat ed with 
decreases in serotonin, serotonin metabolites, and serotonin transporter site densit y (See 
Baggott and Mendelson 2001; Green et al. 1995; O’Callaghan and Miller 1994 and 
Chapters 4 and 5 in the Investigator’s Brochure).  Although some regrowth occurs, 
seemingly permanent redistribution of axons was noted in a study with squirrel m onkeys 
(Hatzidimitriou et al. 1999).  Similar changes can be induced by [CONTACT_147990] (Miller and O’Callaghan 1996; Molliver et al. 1990; 
O'Callaghan and Miller 1994; Sabol et al. 1995; Seiden and Kleven 1989; Seiden and 
Sabol 1996). There is controversy over the extent to which analogous changes occur in 
humans. Imaging studies comparing ecstasy users with non-users have found evide nce of 
lower binding to serotonin transporter re-uptake (SERT) sites (McCann et al. 1998; 
Obrocki et al. 2000; Reneman et al. 2001a; Reneman et al. 2001b; Semple et al. 1999).  
Because these studies use novel experimental techniques to compare self-identif ied drug 
users and non-users, it is not always clear what is being measured or how apparent 
differences relate to MDMA exposure (Kish 2002).  More importantly, there has been no 
evidence of these changes in clinical studies.  Vollenweider and colleagues measured 
 MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in Chronic PTSD 9/24/0 3, revised -01/23/2009  33 
 Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_68020] C Mithoefer. Sponso r: MAPS   
serotonin transporter density using positron emission tomography (PET) with t he same 
radioligand employed in one of the previous studies [ 11 C]McN5652 (McCann et al. 
1998) before and after a clinical administration of approximately 105-120 mg (1.5-1.7 
mg/kg) MDMA (Vollenweider et al. 2001; 2000).  Comparisons were made in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_147922]-naïve healthy volunteers, and later in a second study with 
additional volunteers (n = 8).  Vollenweider and colleagues failed to find any las ting 
differences in scans made before and after MDMA administration.  These fi ndings 
indicate that it is unlikely that MDMA will produce significant serotonergic t oxicity at 
the dosage that will be used in the proposed study.   
 
If long-term serotonergic changes do occur in some humans, it is not known if these 
changes have clinically significant consequences.  Studies of illicit e cstasy users have 
suggested that repeated MDMA use may be associated with lowered neurocogniti ve 
performance, including measures of verbal memory (Bhattachary and Powe ll 2001; Bolla 
et al. 1998; Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al. 2000; McCann et al. 1999; Morgan 1999; 
Reneman et al. 2000; Rodgers 2000; Zakzanis and Young. 2001a) and executive function 
(Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al. 2000; Verkes 2000; Wareing et al. 2000; Zakzanis et al. 
2001b).  There is continuing controversy over whether these findings reflect pre-exis ting 
differences or the effects of other drug use (particularly cannabis) .   The possible 
decreases are clinically insignificant, and do not appear to disrupt the lives of  most 
ecstasy users examined in these studies.  As is also the case with imaging  studies, 
conclusions drawn from examining regular ecstasy users may be inappropriat ely applied 
to the administration of one or two doses of MDMA in a controlled environment.  A yet-
unpublished study failed to find decreased memory in ecstasy users reporting a li fetime 
dose of 20 to 40 tablets, with decreased memory function only appearing in ecstasy user s 
reporting a lifetime dose of 80 or more tablets (Gouzoulis-Mayfrank, data pres ented at 
the 2001 National Institute on Drug Abuse MDMA Conference).  A Phase I study 
comparing 14 ecstasy users at baseline and again after two separate adminis trations of 
MDMA, at doses per administration ranging from 0.25 mg/kg (approximately 17 mg ) to 
2.5 mg/kg (approximately 175 mg) (combined dose of 0.75-4.75 mg/kg, or approximately 
52.5-332.5 mg) in a controlled setting failed to find differences between performa nce on 
an extensive battery of neurocognitive tests given at baseline and after M DMA 
administration (Boone et al. In Preparation, also see Investigator’s Broc hure).  Measures 
employed in this study included assessments of verbal recall and executive f unction.  It 
would thus appear that while regular ecstasy use may be related to subtle decl ine in some 
areas of cognitive function, administration of MDMA at therapeutic doses does  not 
appear to produce differences in neurocognitive function.  Lastly, some recently  
published studies failed to find reduced memory function in ecstasy users when compared 
with cannabis user controls (Simon et al. 2002).  Based on the above data, and additional 
data listed in the Investigators Brochure, it appears very unlikely that two doses  of [ADDRESS_169615] on neurological functioning.  
 
Some researchers believe that MDMA is neurotoxic in humans even at doses used in 
clinical trials (McCann et al. 2001).  Relying on a commonly used calculation for 
estimating pharmacological effects across species and data from studie s in rats and 
monkeys, the researchers claim that humans should be even more sensitive to the eff ects 
of MDMA than smaller animals with higher metabolisms.  However, their use of  
interspecies scaling may be inappropriate in this case.  Interspecies sc aling models may 
not be suited for estimating effects of extensively metabolized drugs, and there  is some 
evidence that calculations using less than three different species are not as  accurate as 
 MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in Chronic PTSD 9/24/0 3, revised -01/23/2009  34 
 Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_68020] C Mithoefer. Sponso r: MAPS   
those using three or more species (Mahmood and Balian 1996).  Vollenweider et al. 
(2001) compare published pharmacokinetic data for humans and rats and conclude that 
human exposure to MDMA after [ADDRESS_169616] known 
consistently neurotoxic MDMA dose in Sprague-Dawley rats, 20 mg/kg, sc, (Batta glia et 
al. 1988; Commins et al. 1987).  At these doses, human MDMA plasma area under the 
curve (AUC) are approximately 30% of the rat AUC.  Similarly, human Cmax are  
approximately 10% of rat Cmax.  The same research team that has used interspec ies 
scaling to calculate a neurotoxic dose in humans has found no signs of neurotoxicity 
when 2.5 mg/kg was administered once every two weeks to squirrel monkeys over a 
period of four months (Vollenweider et al. 1999b, citing personal communication from 
Ricaurte to Swiss Federal Ethical Committee).  Taken together, these findings  suggest 
that the dose of [ADDRESS_169617] apparently been drawn by [CONTACT_86959], which has permitted this research and several Phase I c linical 
trials by [CONTACT_147991].  Moreover, a series of l etters in the 
journal Neuropsychopharmacology discussed the risks of neurotoxicity in MDMA 
studies (Gijsman et al. 1999; Lieberman and Aghajanian 1999; McCann and Ricaurte 
2001; Vollenweider et al. 2001; 1999a), leading two of the journal editors to conclude 
that there is no evidence that the MDMA exposures in the studies of Vollenweider and 
colleagues (similar to those currently proposed) were neurotoxic (Aghaja nian and 
Lieberman 2001).  A team of researchers in Spain have also been permitted to conduct 
human trials with MDMA in the treatment of PTSD associated with sexual assa ult 
(Bouso 2001).    
 
Nevertheless, the risks of neurotoxicity arising from MDMA administrat ion will be 
discussed with all participants prior to and during the informed consent process.  The  
investigators will monitor each participant for psychological and neurocogniti ve status 
throughout the study.   
 
Alternative treatments and procedures:  
 
The alternative to participating in the research study is to decide not to take  part in the 
study.  The decision not to participate in this research study will not in any wa y alter or 
compromise the care offered to individuals receiving therapy from the investiga tor or any 
physician involved in this research study.   
 
The investigators will discuss alternatives to study participation, including ot her available 
treatments, with all potential participants.   
 
There are a number of recognized treatments for PTSD. Treatment often inc ludes both 
psychotherapy and medication.  Most commonly recommended psychotherapeutic 
treatment for PTSD include anxiety management (stress inoculation training ), cognitive 
therapy, exposure therapy and psychoeducation.  Psychodynamic psychotherapy and Ey e 
Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing are also used to treat PTSD.

The only drugs that are currently FDA approved for treatment of PTSD are sert raline and 
paroxetine.  Sertraline has been shown to decrease the hyperarousal and avoidance 
symptoms, but not the re-experiencing symptoms, of PTSD.  Paroxetine has been shown 
to have an effect on all three categories of symptoms in approximately 62 % of pati ents.  
Other medications commonly used are other SSRIs, nefazedone, venlafaxine, tricy clic 
antidepressants, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331], zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_147923]. 
 
The alternative to having non-experimental and experimental sessions recorded to vide o 
is not to consent to have sessions recorded to video disc. While audiorecording of 
sessions is included as part of study methods in the informed consent, consent to session 
videorecording is made on a separate document. 
 
Confidentiality of Records  
 
Every effort will be made to strictly safeguard the confidentiality of al l participants.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], privacy cannot be guaranteed.  Data collected from each partic ipant will be 
identified only by [CONTACT_2299]'s initials on the source document and by a randomly 
generated numeric code on all secondary documents and databases.  Any materi als or 
questionnaires mailed to participants will be sent along with stamped envelopes us ing the 
office address of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_147924], a nd 
questionnaires will only be marked with a newly assigned subject number, and 
participants will be instructed not to place their name [CONTACT_148005]. The 
investigators will retain a key associating these new numbers with those a ssigned to 
participants upon study enrollment. All measures, records, audio and video recording s 
will be kept in a locked file drawer in a locked office.  Access to measures wil l be limited 
to regulatory agencies, researchers assessing the participant for chan ges in symptoms, 
and individuals analyzing data.  Researchers with access to data will not be provided w ith 
any information that would identify participants by [CONTACT_120651], such a s 
social security number.  
 
Participants will sign forms for the release of information to any of the indi viduals who 
will need to obtain this information.  Interested parties might include the prescr ibing 
physician or psychiatrist.   
 
Removing identifying information from data and restricting access to rese archers directly 
involved in assessing the participants should prevent the dissemination of confidential 
data, with or without identifying information.  Maintaining data in a secure environment  
will prevent the accidental or deliberate examination or removal of data.  While  it is 
possible that individuals may be identified on audiotape or video recording through 
means other than their names, restricting access to audiorecordings or vide o recordings 
greatly reduces the opportunity for identification.

Risk-Benefits Analysis  
 
While there are a number of available means for the treatment of PTSD, the se arch for a 
wider array of potential treatments is crucial.  Not all individuals with PTS D respond to 
the currently available treatments.  MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may pr ove to be yet 
another treatment option for people with PTSD.  If it is found to be safe and efficacious  
in this population, then a potentially greater number of people will be able to improve 
their quality of life through the reduction or alleviation of PTSD symptoms.   
 
Our participants will be individuals suffering from PTSD that is refractory  to treatment or 
who are unwilling or unable to attain or tolerate conventional PTSD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and the y 
will receive [ADDRESS_169618] in the development of a novel treatment for PTSD.   
 
There is good evidence that administering two doses of 125 mg MDMA in a clinical 
setting poses a low risk to the subjects.  Previous studies examining the effects  of MDMA 
in humans found that it has been well-tolerated, and no lasting toxicity has been repo rted 
in clinical trials with MDMA (Cami et al. 2000; Grob et al.; Grob et al. 1996; Lest er et al. 
2000; Tancer et al. 2001; Vollenweider et al. 1998).  There is no evidence for long-term 
changes in serotonin function or neurocognitive function after a small number of MDMA 
administrations conducted during a clinical trial (Boone et al., In Preparation;  
Vollenweider, 2001; 2000).  Case reports of therapeutic work carried out before the 
scheduling of MDMA indicate that MDMA can be safely administered to people  
reporting symptoms of PTSD (Adamson 1985; Gasser 1994; Greer and Tolbert 1986; 
Grinspoon and Bakalar 1986).  In conclusion, MDMA has been safely administered in 
numerous Phase I studies of MDMA and in therapeutic settings, and low risks are 
presented by [CONTACT_43602] a small number of doses of MDMA in a clinical 
setting.   
 
Reports and anecdotal accounts indicate that, before MDMA was placed in Schedule 1, 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147925]-assisted psychotherapy administered an additi onal dose of 
approximately one half the size of the initial dose to prolong the therapeutic effect s of the 
drug (Stolaroff 2000), and this procedure was well-tolerated. Participants i n an 
uncontrolled study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy were offered a supplemental dos e 
of MDMA during the course of therapy (Greer and Tolbert 1986). There is limited for mal 
data concerning the risks associated with the addition of a second smaller dose of 
MDMA, but studies of the effects of two doses of 100 mg, either administered four or 24 
hours apart (Farre et al. 2004; Pacifici et al. 2001) suggest that a smaller su pplemental 
dose would slightly elevate subjective and physiological effects. Prolonging t he therapy 
session is expected to offer the potential benefit of improving PTSD symptoms, sinc e 
there will be more time to rely on the anxiolytic and insight-fostering effe cts of MDMA.

The possibility of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a novel means of reducing or alleviating symptoms in 
treatment-refractory posttraumatic stress disorder outweigh the low r isks of three 
experimental sessions in a controlled laboratory setting, each administering 125 mg doses 
of MDMA with supplemental doses of 62.5 mg after 2 to 2.5 hours.

Appendix A: Procedures for Treating Serious Adverse Events 
 
Description of potential adverse events and procedures described to address these 
unlikely events are presented in order of relative likelihood.  Contingency plans for  
responding to these events were all negotiated with and approved by [CONTACT_1622], and are 
described below.   
 
Hypertension  
 
Thus far, hypertension is the only adverse event to have occurred after the administ ration 
of MDMA in a controlled, laboratory setting (Grob et al. In preparation; Mas et  al. 1999; 
Vollenweider et al. 1998).  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_147931], with blood pressure and heart rate returnin g to 
normal five hours after drug administration.  Clinically significant elevat ion in systolic 
blood pressure (30 mm Hg above baseline) has been recorded in less than 5% of 
volunteers across all human trials conducted so far.  Clinically significant inc reases in 
systolic blood pressure have lasted for up to two hours and have returned to normal 
without any intervention.  Clinically-significant elevation in blood pressure and hea rt rate 
usually begins [ADDRESS_169619]-certified emergency room physician and licensed emerge ncy room 
nurse who will be on standby [CONTACT_147995].  The investigator will make a clinical 
judgment about whether additional monitoring or treatment is required.  If a part icipant 
exhibits systolic > 220 or diastolic > 120, he or she will be considered to be in 
hypertensive crisis, and will receive immediate treatment to lower blood pre ssure.  
Reasons for transport to the intensive care unit  (ICU) would include, but not be limited 
to, severe headache in the setting of hypertension, or angina or neurologic def icits 
regardless of blood pressure.  A crash cart will be immediately available a nd will contain 
nitroprusside and other antihypertensives in addition to the usual resuscitation drugs and 
equipment.  This will allow treatment to be instituted without transferring the pa rticipant 
if that should become necessary.  The physician-investigator may, at any time , make a 
clinical judgment to transfer the participant to the ICU in the nearest local  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147932].   
 
Any participant who, during the first MDMA session, experiences sustained blood 
pressure of  > 220 systolic or > 120 diastolic or heart rate > 75% predicted maximum  will 
not be given a second experimental session.

Psychological distress  
 
Reports of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy conducted prior to the scheduling of MDMA 
indicate that some people receiving MDMA in a therapeutic context experienc ed periods 
of increased anxiety and even panic.  In the proposed study, participants will have the  
intention of confronting and working on their traumatic experiences and accepting and 
working through difficult and painful emotions.  Hence, signs of psychological distress , 
panic or other unpleasant psychological reactions are possible.  Psychological dis tress 
could arise at any time after the onset of the effects of MDMA until the las t effects have 
dissipated (approximately 3 to 5 hours after drug administration), with anxiety  or distress 
potentially lasting for as little as 15 minutes to as long as 5 hours.   
 
The potential for destabilizing psychological distress will be minimized by  [CONTACT_147996] (such as people diagnosed with bipolar 
affective disorder - 1 or with psychotic disorders), by [CONTACT_147997] t he 
experimental session, by [CONTACT_147998], 
by [CONTACT_101219], by [CONTACT_147999] a week afte r the 
experimental session, and by [CONTACT_148000]-drug integrative psychotherapy ses sions.  
Subjects will remain in the offices of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_147933].  The clinic will be staffed by a trained att endant (an RN) to 
respond to the needs of the subject. The attendant will be instructed to contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Mithoefer upon request or at the appearance of signs of a potential adverse event.  The 
overnight stay in a private room in [CONTACT_148009]'s clinic and the presence of the 
attendant should further reduce psychological distress.  
 
People diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder – [ADDRESS_169620]  that difficult 
emotions, including grief, rage and fear or panic, may arise during experiment al sessions.  
Every effort will be made to help participants resolve difficult symptoms and t o arrive at 
a more comfortable and relaxed state by [CONTACT_148001], including em pathic 
listening on the part of the investigators and performance of diaphragmatic bre athing by 
[CONTACT_4317].  
 
If, by [CONTACT_2671] 6 to 8 hour experimental session, the participant is still severel y 
agitated or experiencing great psychological distress, the following me asures will be 
taken:  
- If a subject is anxious, agitated, in danger of any self harm or is suicidal  at the 
end of the MDMA/placebo session, the investigators will remain with the subject 
for at least two more hours.  During this time, the investigators will employ a ffect 
management techniques described in the manual, will talk with the subject to hel p 
him or her gain cognitive perspective of their experiences, and will help them 
implement the self soothing and stress inoculation techniques they were taught in 
the introductory sessions.  If this situation should occur at the end of one of the 
ninety-minute follow-up sessions at least one of the investigators will be av ailable 
to stay with the subject for at least two additional hours.

- If a subject remains severely anxious, agitated or in danger of self harm or 
suicide, or is otherwise psychologically unstable at the end of this two hour 
stabilization period [CONTACT_148009] will decide between one of two options: 
 
A.  A psychiatric nurse, therapeutic assistant or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (whose

subject until the time of his or her appointment with investigators the next 
day.  The investigators will then meet with the subject daily until the 
period of destabilization has passed.  At any time during this process, [CONTACT_148010] may make the clinical judgment to proceed to option B. 
 
B.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147934] a severe panic reaction will be suspended fr om study 
participation until after recovery or stabilization, at which time the investi gator will 
carefully evaluate the subject's emotional status. If this response occ urs during the first 
experimental session, the investigator may elect to forego the second admini stration and 
drop the subject from the study.  This decision will be made after discussion with the da ta 
safety monitoring committee and the submission of a report to the IRB and the FD A. 
 
For those subjects engaged in an on-going therapeutic relationship, we will activel y 
involve their outside therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147935].   
 
In the event of a participant’s experiencing severe, persisting emotional  distress, such as 
panic attacks, severe generalized anxiety or insomnia following an MDMA ses sion, the 
investigator may prescribe a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_147936] a “rescue medicati on.”  If a 
participant should become psychotic or suicidal, arrangements will be made for him or  
her to be admitted to the nearest inpatient psychiatric facility of their choi ce.  Residual 
symptoms will be addressed during the frequent follow-up psychotherapy visits wi th the 
investigators.   
 
Angina or Myocardial infarction  
 
If a participant experiences ischemic type chest pain, whether or not it is ass ociated with 
hypertensive crisis, he or she will receive oxygen and an IV and will be monitore d as 
described above. He or she will be given nitroglycerin 0.[ADDRESS_169621] 
pain pending transport to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If further evaluation at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147937] t hat the 
participant has had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), he or she will be we ll within 
the time frame required for definitive therapy.  The American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the treatment of AM I recommend 
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) as the treatment of  choice when 
it can be performed within [ADDRESS_169622] 
EKG evidence of AMI (J Am Coll Cardiol 34:890, 1999). 
 
Stroke  
 
If any participant has neurologic deficits, whether or not they are associ ated with 
hypertensive crisis, he or she will receive oxygen and an IV and will be monitore d as

will be time to administer recombinant tissue plasminogen within the 3 hour time fr ame 
recommended in the American Academy of Neurology/American Heart Assoc iation 
guidelines (Neurology 47:835, 1996).   
 
Hyponatremia  
 
Hyponatremia (low blood sodium or high blood water) has occurred after use of ecst asy 
in uncontrolled settings, perhaps as a result of MDMA effects and user behavior 
(drinking excessive water in order to stave off dehydration) (Henry and Rella  2001).  A 
modest dose of MDMA (47.5 mg) has been demonstrated to induce arginine vasopressin 
(AVP) release in humans (Forsling et al. 2001).  Researchers and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147938].  However , 
hyponatremia has not been reported either in case reports of MDMA-assisted thera py 
conducted before the scheduling of MDMA or in recently conducted clinical trials .   
 
History of hyponatremia or detection of hyponatremia on initial physical ex amination 
will be cause for exclusion from the proposed study.  Participants will be given 
electrolyte solutions such as Gatorade instead of water in order to decrease  the likelihood 
of dilutional hyponatremia.  They will not be allowed to drink more than 3 L. of fluids, 
and fluid intake will be appropriately spread out across the session.  If there are a ny signs 
or symptoms of hyponatremia, a stat serum sodium will be drawn and fluids will be 
withheld until the results are obtained.  If the serum sodium is less than 125mEq/L, se rum 
and urine osmolality and sodium will be measured, and the subject will be transported t o 
the East Cooper Medical Center, where further intervention can be provided.  
 
Hyperthermia  
 
Cases of hyperthermia in ecstasy users are probably due in large part t o an interaction 
between drug effects, high ambient temperature found at some dance events and 
prolonged or vigorous exercise (Henry and Rella 2001).   No cases of hyperthermia have 
been reported in studies wherein MDMA was administered to humans in a controlled 
environment.  Hyperthermia is unlikely to arise in the proposed study because 
participants will not be exercising and will be in an environment with controlled ambie nt 
temperature, which will be kept comfortably cool.  
 
Body temperature will be taken every 60 to 90 minutes throughout each experimental 
session.  If temperature rises more than 1° C, attempts will be made to lower it b y 
removing blankets and layers of clothing, decreasing the ambient temperature  and, if 
necessary, directing a fan toward the subject.  If at any time the temper ature rises more 
than 1.5° C above baseline despi[INVESTIGATOR_120502], ice packs will be used, blood will be 
drawn for stat CBC, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, glucose, CPK, PT, PTT , platelets and 
liver enzymes, and urine will be collected for urinalysis.  If there ar e significant 
abnormalities in these tests, if the temperature continues to rise, or if an ele vated 
temperature is associated with delirium or muscle rigidity the partici pant will be 
transferred to the ICU at the East Cooper Medical Center.   
 
If, during the first MDMA session, a participant’s temperature rises more t han 1 ° C. and 
does not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_147939],

clothing, ambient temperature and ventilation, then that participant will not be give n a 
second experimental session.     
 
In order to avoid dehydration, participants will be encouraged to drink at least [ADDRESS_169623] been reported in ecstasy users, and in vitro studies s how that 
MDMA can impair liver cell viability, with effects possibly exacerba ted by [CONTACT_148002] 
(Carvalho et al, 1999), but their results suggest that this is very unlikely to occur  in the 
proposed clinical study.  The peak liver exposure to MDMA in the proposed clinical 
study should be approximately one-eleventh the concentration shown to impair cell 
viability in these in vitro studies.  Hepatotoxicity has not been reported to occur in an y of 
the clinical studies where MDMA was administered to research participants .   
 
Liver enzymes will be measured four days after the second experimental ses sion as a 
means of monitoring for any signs of potential hepatotoxicity.  Any participant w ho 
shows abnormalities on any of the liver enzyme determinations will receive fur ther 
evaluation and follow-up by a gastroenterologist.    
 
Reproductive/Developmental Toxicity  
 
One of two studies of polydrug-using ecstasy users found a possibly increased incidenc e 
of developmental abnormalities when pregnant women used illicit drugs including 
ecstasy (McElhatton et al. 1999).  There is some contention as to whether the 
developmental abnormalities reported in the study conducted by [CONTACT_148003], in fact, the result of ecstasy consumption.  Pregnant women will  be 
excluded from participation in the proposed study and urine pregnancy tests will be 
performed before each drug administration.

Appendix B: Procedures used for Audio and Video Recording 
 
Recording to video will be done with two unobtrusive cameras operated remotely by [CONTACT_4520], already present as co-therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147940] -drug 
psychotherapy sessions.  One camera will be adjusted to capture a fairly ti ght shot of the 
subject, including full-face shots and partial or full body shots.  The other will captur e a 
wider view including the subject and the two investigators.  Remote operation will 
include stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_147941], as with a foot-operated switch or pedal. Two 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_147942], one to be stored by [CONTACT_093] s, 
and the other by [CONTACT_456]. Both will be kept in locked cabinets in secure locations.  A 
third video tape copy will be made for any subject who requests it.   
 
Full names and addresses are unlikely to appear on the video or audio tapes. However, 
if they do, they will be edited out of the recording before the tape is seen by [CONTACT_148004].  Facial ima ges will 
not be removed from the copy of the video recording to be viewed by [CONTACT_147966] . However 
face shots will be obscured on any tapes used for training purposes unless the subject 
gives his or her written permission (via " Video and  Audio Use P ermission IC”) to retain 
face shots. 
 
Audio recording of experimental and non-drug psychotherapy sessions will be done using  
a laptop computer controlled by [CONTACT_54858], with control allowing him to 
stop or start recording.  The recordings will be written on an external hard drive  
connected to the laptop, not onto the laptop hard drive itself. The external hard drive will 
be kept in a locked office. The recordings will then be burned onto CDs in the 
investigators office. One copy will be stored by [CONTACT_83196] a l ocked cabinet, 
another copy will be sent to the sponsor if requested and will also be stored in a locked 
cabinet at the location of the sponsor.  During experimental sessions, but not during non-
drug psychotherapy sessions, an additional audio recording will be made with a portable  
cassette deck.  The purpose of this is to enable the participants to have a casset te 
recording for themselves at the end of each experimental session, rather tha n having to 
wait until the CDs are made by [CONTACT_473].   
 
The participants will be informed on the consent document that they have the right to 
require audio and/or video tapi[INVESTIGATOR_147943].   
 
At the end of the study, participants will be asked to complete and sign a video recordin g 
permission form regarding whether or not they will allow people in sponsor's traini ng 
program for teaching MDMA-assisted therapy to view video recordings of their s ession, 
with our without full facial images.

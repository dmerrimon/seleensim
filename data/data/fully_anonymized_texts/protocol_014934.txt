Title : Evaluation of two different methods of teaching self -management strategies to patients 
with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis  
 
Principal Investigator : [INVESTIGATOR_124]. James Wyss, MD  
 
Condition or Intervention to be studied : The condition being studied is self -manageme nt 
education for patients who have symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) and are scheduled for a 
hyaluronic acid (HA) injection.  
 
Research questions/specific aims : This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_597271] -management education  to patients receiving an HA injection for symptomatic 
knee OA. The main goal is to see if the study can be feasibly conducted. Feasibility will be 
determined by [CONTACT_597276]/residents to administer the assigned teaching method to 
the potent ial patient (if they are unavailable 70% of the time, then the study will be deemed to be 
not feasible). The other goals are to obtain information on the following:  
1. Patient satisfaction with their assigned teaching methods.  
2. Education methods that a re preferred by [CONTACT_1962].  
3. Provider (fellows and residents) satisfaction with their assigned teaching methods.  
4. Teaching methods that are preferred by [CONTACT_597277].  
 
Hypothesis : We hypothesize that the study can be feasibly conducted, and t hat patient 
satisfaction with assigned teaching method 2 (education handout + 5 -minute explanation) will be 
higher than patient satisfaction with assigned teaching method A (educational handout only, no 
explanation).  
 
Primary outcome :  
1. Patient satisfact ion with their assigned teaching method (0 -10 scale; 0=not satisfied; 
10=most satisfied) – assessed at [ADDRESS_789078] -injection  
2. Provider (fellow, resident) satisfaction with their assigned teaching method (0 -10 scale; 
0=not satisfied; 10=most sati sfied) – assessed at [ADDRESS_789079] -injection  
 
Secondary outcomes :  
1. Patient preference regarding teaching method – assessed at [ADDRESS_789080] -injection  
2. Provider preference regarding teaching method – assessed at [ADDRESS_789081] -injection care – assessed at [ADDRESS_789082] -injection  
4. PROMIS -10 – assessed at [ADDRESS_789083] -injection  
 
Background : Symptomatic knee OA is a condition that is characterized by [CONTACT_597278] 10 million adults in the [LOCATION_002].1 By [CONTACT_654] 60, the lifetime 
risk of being diagnosed with symptomatic knee OA is 9.29%.[ADDRESS_789084] doctor -to-patient teaching that may occur during an office visit (one -on-
one) or with a small gr oup. Others may rely on educational handouts or other forms of individual 
education that are given to patients. Some utilize both methods of teaching, and others rely on 
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_597272]. There are many other teaching methods, and variations of previous methods also exist.[ADDRESS_789085] been conducted.6 Both the content and delivery of educa tion materials are essential to 
having a successful method. Whether one method is effective depends largely on the patient’s 
self-efficacy, ability to understand the materials, and willingness to cooperate.7,[ADDRESS_789086] a patient’s outcomes.7 In the general 
OA population, Hansson et al. demonstrated an increase in self -perceived health in patients who 
partici pated in an OA -targeted patient education program (5 group sessions) compared to 
patients who did not participate in the program.[ADDRESS_789087] sizes were very small and likely not statistically 
significant in some cases.8 Again, many of these studies did not assess patient satisfaction.  
Recently, the development of video -based patient education tools was tested in patients with 
knee osteoarthritis (both symptomatic and not), rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. The 
results showed increases in disease knowledge, and patients appeared to be more aware about 
taking their medications.[ADDRESS_789088] step at evaluating two different methods of teaching: one involving a written handout that's 
given to the patient for him/her to read at home, and one involving the  same written handout that 
is explained to the patient by [CONTACT_13917]. Future studies will evaluate other commonly utilized 
methods of teaching, as well as longer periods of follow -up.

Study design : Randomized controlled clinical trial  
 
Enrollment target : 24 
 
Inclusion criteria : 
1. Age 18+  
2. Diagnosis of symptomatic knee OA  
3. Scheduled for an HA injection into the knee  
4. Fellow/resident is a vailable to administer assigned teaching method  
 
Exclusion criteria : 
1. Patients who are already enrolled in the study  
2. Non-English sp eaking  
 
Study procedures : Patients who have symptomatic knee OA and are coming in for an HA 
injection will be approached for the study. At the time of consent, patients will be told that they 
will be receiving educational materials, and that the study will be focu sing on outcomes in 
patients who receive educational materials. Details related to the two teaching methods will only 
be revealed to the patients  at the 3 -month follow -up, in order to prevent any bias in their 
responses. The primary investigator and research  assistant will be blinded to the randomization 
group.  
 
Enrolled patients will be randomized to receive one of two teaching methods:  
1. A written handout will be given to the patient, and the patient will be asked to read the 
handout at home and call back with any questions or clarifications.  
2. A written handout will be given to the patient, and key information will be explained to 
the patient  with time for questions and answers ( approximately  5 min).  
The written handout includes  a description of knee OA, treatment options for knee OA, and 
instructions for the self -management of knee OA.  
 
During the icing period post -injection, a fellow or resident will return to the exam room and 
administer either teaching method 1 or 2 to the pa tient (depending on the randomization 
assignment). The same written handout will be given to every patient . The explanation of key 
information will be standardized as much as possible to prevent against large variations in 
teaching methods among fel lows and residents.  
 
At 1 month following the educational handout/session, the fellows and residents will be surveyed 
regarding their satisfaction with the teaching  method and if they would have preferred to teach 
the information in a different man ner. 
 
At 1 month and 3 months following the educational handout/sessions, patients will be asked the 
following questions : 
1. On a scale of 0 -10, with 0=not satisfied and 10=most satisfied, please rate your 
satisfaction with the education you recei ved on the day of your injection.  
2. Would you have preferred a different method of receiving education? If yes, what 
method?  
3. Did the education you received help with the care of your osteoarthritis? If yes, please 
explain how it helped.  
4. PROMIS -10 questionnai re (also administered at baseline, after consent)  
 
Sample size analysis and statistical analysis plan : As recommended by [CONTACT_597279],[ADDRESS_789092] a sample size of 12 per group (24 total). If deemed feasible, results  from this study will 
be used to design larger, future studies.  
 
Descriptive statistics will be employed for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Patient/provider satisfaction results 
will be summarized as mean with standard deviation or median with 1st and 3rd quartiles. 
Patient/provider preferen ce results (yes/no) will be presented as counts and percentages. Whether 
the education helped with the patient ’s care of OA (yes/no) will also be presented as counts and 
percentages. PROMIS -[ADDRESS_789093] quartiles. Comparisons between continuous or categorical variables will be 
assessed using the Student ’s t-test or Chi -square test, respectively.

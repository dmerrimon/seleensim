larger clinical trial.    
2. Introd uction  
 A 2007 survey done by [CONTACT_636887] (CAM) in US determined that omega -[ADDRESS_851463] commonly used non- vitamin/non- mineral natural product 
consumed by [CONTACT_67022], and the second most commonly consumed supplement  by [CONTACT_7683]
1. 
Among the proportion of survey participants who had used natural products in the last 30 
days, 37% of adults and 31% of children had taken an omega -3 supplement for health reasons. 
Increasing evidence has indicated multiple health benefit of fish oil intake, including its ability to prevent heart disease, inflammation, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_636878]
2. The beneficial e ffects of fish oils appear to be due to long -chain omega -3 fatty 
acids, namely eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are 
similar in structure but different in their carbon backbone length and degree of unsaturation. EPA has 20 c arbon atoms and 5 double bonds (20:5), whereas DHA has a longer chain of 22 
carbon atoms and 6 double bonds (22:6). Their precursors, shorter -chain omega -3 fatty acids, 
primarily alpha -linolenic acid (18:3), are abundant in the diet, but only a very small percent  of 
these fatty acids are converted to the longer chain EPA and even less to DHA (Fig. 1)
3. The 
interconversion of DHA and EPA is also a very inefficient process, thus plasma levels of EPA and DHA are primarily derived from dietary sources, such as fish.

The intake of total omega -3 fatty acids in the [LOCATION_002] is relatively low at ~1.6 g/d 
(~0.7% of energy intake). Of this, alpha -linolenic  acid accounts f or ~1.4 g/d, and only 0.1 to 
0.2 g/d comes from EPA and DHA4. A variety of governmental, scientific, and international 
organizations have established recommended target or minimum consumption levels of fish 
and omega -[ADDRESS_851465] guidelines are for 
combined EPA+DHA and are based on primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in the general population
5-8. Generally, these  dietary  guidelines converge on a recommended 
minimum consumption of 250–500 mg/d of c ombined EPA+DHA, and even higher doses for 
the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. For example, American Heart Association (AHA) recommends ~1 g/d of combined EPA+DHA for patients with documented CHD, and 2-4 g/d of combined EPA+DHA for patient s with elevated triglycerides. However, most 
guidelines do not make separate specific recommendations about EPA versus DHA consumption.  
Fish oils can substantially vary in the amounts and ratios of EPA and DHA that they 
contain.  For example, tuna oil nat urally contains more DHA than EPA (Table 1). In contrast, 
blue-fin fish, such as anchovy and sardine, contain more EPA than DHA. Since most 
commercial fish oil/omega -[ADDRESS_851466] different EPA to DHA ratios, widely different ranges of 
EPA/DHA are commercially available, but most typi[INVESTIGATOR_29109] 0.7 to 1.4 (Table 2).

effects on nuclear receptors and transcription factors, metabolites, and lipid membrane function (Fig. 2). In general, long- chain omega -3 fatty acids are natu ral ligands of several 
nuclear receptors that regulate gene expression, including PPAR, hepatic nuclear factor, liver X receptors, and retinoid X receptors.  They also alter expression of transcription factors, such as sterol regulatory element binding -protein and carbohydrate response element binding-
protein (ChREBP)
10, which may contribute to the physiologic effects of omega -[ADDRESS_851471] of PPAR -
alpha than DHA, whereas DH A appears to more strongly regulate Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 
4-alpha (HNF -4-alpha), Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), and ChREBP11. Both EPA and 
DHA also give rise to resolvins, a newly described class of specialized pro -resolving mediator

 (SPM) that prote cts against prolonged inflammation and tissue injury in several animal 
models, including peritonitis and ischemia -reperfusion12. However, only DHA is metabolized 
to other classes of SPM, such as neuroprotectin -D1 and maresins, which may confer the 
unique i nflammation -resolving properties of DHA13,14. In animal models, neuroprotectin- D1 
promotes neuronal cell survival and may contribute to protective effects of DHA against 
ischemic stroke15. In addition, although both EPA and DHA alter lipid membrane propert ies, 
DHA appears to be especially effective in altering lipid membrane structure and function due 
to its longer hydrocarbon chain length and higher degree of unsaturation16. For example, in rat 
aortic endothelial cells, DHA incorporation increased membrane  fluidity more so than EPA17. 
In cultured mouse lymphocytes, DHA but not EPA modified the distribution and size of lipid rafts, specialized lipid domains in cellular membranes with major regulatory roles on protein 
function and signaling events

Fig. [ADDRESS_851472] evaluated the combined and separate effects of EPA and DHA 
supplementation on both TG -lowering and LDL -C raising. In a meta -analysis of 21 studies, it 
was concluded that b oth EPA and DHA decreased triglyceride levels, primarily by [CONTACT_636888]-acid catabolism via peroxisomal beta -oxidation, and also by [CONTACT_636889], and accelerating clearance of TG from the plasma

Recently, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a plasma protein 
produced in the liver and the intestine, has been identified as a major determinant of LDL -C 
levels and is now a promising therapeutic target  26,27.  PCSK9 binds to the  extracellular 
domain of the hepatic LDL -receptor causing its internalization and degradation, which leads 
to increased plasma levels of LDL -C.  New LDL -C lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_636879]9 to interfere with this process28.  We recently 
observed in apoE -knockout mice on a high fat diet treated for 13- weeks with the human 
equivalent to 4g/day of omega -3 fatty acids with an EPA:DHA ratio -1.5, a significant 
decrease in LDL -C and VLDL -C compared to untreated apoE -knockout mice on the same diet 
(Fig. 3A).  Both hepatic mRNA levels of PCSK9 and plasma PCSK9 protein levels were significantly decreased in mice receiving the omega -3 fatty acid supplement  (Fig. 3B) , which 
could possibly account for the observed beneficial changes in the serum lipoproteins.

3. Study Design and Methods  
3.1 Overview  
The study will be a prospective double -blind ed randomized crossover study (Fig. 4) . 
During the first visit, subjects will be screened by  [CONTACT_636890]/inclusion questionnaire and 
baseline clinical laboratory testing.  If not excluded, they may also be assessed for vascular compliance by C ardio -ankle vascular index  (CAVI) testing
31,[ADDRESS_851475]  to take either 
EPA - or DHA- rich fish oil capsules equivalent to 3g of EPA or DHA  for 6 ± [ADDRESS_851476] arm of the study and will return for a follow up . After a wash -out period of 8 ± [ADDRESS_851477] visit, they will receive the other fish oil supplement for 6 ± [ADDRESS_851478]  once  during each period to monitor compliance 
and any adverse events.  Subjects should also consent to be contact[CONTACT_5365] a future study. After 
completion of the second arm, results will be unblinded for each patient.

[ADDRESS_851479] study day will be the screening and 
baseline followed by [CONTACT_636891]. The study will 
be discussed in detail with interested subjects.  Any procedures needed to assess eligibility 
(i.e. blood laboratory tests, pregnancy test) will be performed after obtaining informed 
consent. Prior to the first visit a telephone call may be used to give general information about 
the study, to explain the exclusion/inclusion criteria and the tests that will be performed. This 
will not be considered a screening. In addition, phone calls may be used during the study to 
clarify any questions and to support compliance to the study. Any adverse event will be 
collected and repo rted as per item 12  of this proposal.  
Visit 1: At  the first visit (screening and baseline), the subjects will be consented and will 
be screened by [CONTACT_636890]/inclusion questionnaire , baseline  laboratory tests and a pregnancy 
test for female s. In addition, 10 mL of blood and a stool sample  (optional)  will be stored for 
research tests. The subject will have vital signs and Body Mass Index measured, and will undergo a history and physical examination. If not excluded, they will receive a  diet and 
exercise assessment to determine their nutritional status , a physical examination  and a Cardio -
Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI) test may be performed. Once eligibility is confirmed, subjects 
will be randomized by [CONTACT_636892] , will receive a 6-week  (or up to 7 weeks, if 
necessary)  supply of the first dietary supplement (DHA or EPA) , will be instructed to take 4 
tablets, 3 times a day, after meals, for 6 weeks  (12 tablets a day)  and will be schedule d to 
return for a second visit.  
Re-screening Visit as applicable:   Repeat laboratory values, including baseline research 
blood, may be needed to reassess eligibility within [ADDRESS_851480]

supplementation for 8 weeks.    
Visit 3:  The third visit will occur 1 4 weeks (+/ - 1 week) after starting supplementation.  
At this visit, the subject s will receive laboratory tests and a pregnancy test for female. In 
addition, 10 mL of blood  and a stool sample (optional)  will be stored for research tests. The 
subject will have vital signs and Body Mass Index measured, will undergo a brief physical 
examination, may receive a diet and exercise assessment to determine their nutritional status, and a Cardio -Ankle Vascular Ind ex (CAVI) test may be performed.   At the end of the 3
rd visit, 
subjects will receive a 6 week supply  (or up to 7 weeks, if necessary)  of the second dietary 
supplement (EPA or DHA) and will be instructed to take 4 tablets, 3 times a day, after meals, 
for 6 weeks (12 tablets a day).  
Visit 4:  The fourth, and final, visit will occur 6 weeks (+/ - 1 week) after starting  the 
second supplementation.  At this visit, the subject s will receive laboratory tests and a 
pregnancy test for female. In addition, 10 mL of blood and a stool sample  (optional) will be 
stored for research tests. The subject will have vital signs and Body Mass Index measured , 
will undergo a brief physical examination, may receive a diet and exercise assessment to 
determine their nutritional status, and a Cardio- Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI) test may be

visit, the subjects will be instructed to discontinue supplementation.     
Subjects will be encouraged to complete the seven day food record prior to the return  
visits, in order to facilitate the nutritional and exercise assessment.  However, if the subject 
does not complete, or only partially completed the seven day food record, the nutritional and 
exercise assessment will still take place and it will determine any changes in life- style.  
The supplement may be dispensed in full or in 2 different prescriptions.

5. Supplements  
Supplements will be stored, dispensed and disposed by [CONTACT_271580]. The 
supplements  that will be studied will be provided by [CONTACT_636895]  ® as EPA -rich fish 
oil and DHA -rich fish oil, omega -3 acid triglycerides .  The supplements will be  supplie d as a 
liquid -filled gel capsule for oral administration. Each capsule of EPA -rich fish oil contains at 
minimum  255 mg of EPA  and 110 mg of DHA from fish oils  (EPA to DHA ratio: 2.3). E ach 
capsule of DHA- rich fish oil contains at minimum  274 mg of DHA and 74 mg of EPA from 
fish oils  (EPA to DHA ratio: 0. 27). The participants will be instructed  to take study drug 
containing approximately either 3g  per day  of EPA or  3g per day of  DHA  in three divided 
doses  (4 capsules, 3 times a day after meals) . With each regimen, the total dosage of EPA plus 
DHA will be approximately 4g per day. The dosing is comparable  with  earlier clinical trials21-
25. They will also be advised to take the supplements provided immediately after meals,  as 
they are better absorbed with fat .

 Drug Interactions:  Clinical studies have not been done to thoroughly examine the effect 
of EPA - or DHA- rich fish oil supplement  with anticoagulants. Patients receiving these fish oil 
supplements  and an anticoagulant or other drug affecting coagulation should be monitored 
periodically (e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], NSAIDS, warfarin, coumarin).  
 
Stability :  EPA - or DHA -rich fish oil supplement  will be maintained and distributed as 
directed by [CONTACT_636897]. Lots will be dated 3 years from expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Capsules are not to be frozen. 
 
Off-label use:  Since EPA -rich fish  oil and DHA- rich fish  oil will be used as a dietary 
supplement and intended only to affect the structure or function of the body and not for a 
therapeutic purpose a IND is not needed. Considering the clinical investigation is de signed to 
study the relationship between a dietary supplement’s effect on normal structure or function in humans or to characterize the mechanism by [CONTACT_9444] a dietary supplement acts to maintain such 
structure or function this study would not need to be conducted under an IND.
 Under DSHEA, 
a dietary supplement is not considered a drug and is not subject to the premarket approval requirements for drugs if the intended use for which it is marketed is only to affect the 
structure or any function of the body (i.e ., not intended to be used for a therapeutic purpose). 
Similarly, whether an IND is needed for a clinical investigation evaluating a dietary supplement is determined by [CONTACT_636898]. If the clinical 
investigation is intended onl y to evaluate the dietary supplement’s effect on the structure or 
function of the body, an IND is not  required. 
  
However, in order to use a reliable source of EPA -rich fish oil and DHA -rich fish oil, since, 
most U.S. over the counter available supplements are not guaranteed to have EPA/DHA 
concentration intended to use in this study, Nippon Suisan Kaisha, Ltd has generously agreed 
to provide reliable EPA -rich and D HA-rich fish oil for this study, which is the same product 
available in the Japanese market, under a clinical supply agreement with NHLBI. Because the 
products are manufactured outside of U.S., FDA guidelines express the requirement of an 
IND, while the US DA requires a parallel approval for the importation of the supplements . 
6. Laboratory Methods

8. Monitoring of Subjects and Criteria for Withdrawal of Subjects   
8.1  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_107660]  
• A single epi[INVESTIGATOR_636882]  
• Moderate gastrointestinal symptoms that persists for more than [ADDRESS_851483] with the investigator  
• Pregnancy and breastfeeding 
• Anaphylactic reaction due to consumption of the fish oil supplement  
• New onset atrial fibrillation/flutter  
• Major bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]  
• Subjects taking less than 75% of the fish oil  supplement  
• Any other severe symptoms related to the treatment and as determined by [CONTACT_636899]. 
 
Subjects who are found to be pregnant or wish to breastfeed during the study will 
automatically be withdrawn. A pregnancy screening will be done for all female volunteers at the first visit and  subjects will be  excluded from the study if pregnant.  It is not known 
whether the omega- [ADDRESS_851484] milk. It is therefore not advisable for 
any breastfeeding woman to participate in this study. Adverse effects of omega -3 supplements  
may include atrial fibrillation. Patients that develop symptoms of atrial fibrillation (palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], rapid heart rate, fainting, shortness of breath, etc.) will be instructed to visit the emergency roo m and seek treatment immediately.  In order to prevent any future events, 
participants with atrial fibrillation will be withdrawn from the study.  Individuals that develop an allergy to fish  or shellfish may experience an anaphylactic reaction from the treatment and 
will also be required to visit the emergency room immediately and also withdraw from the study.

[ADDRESS_851486] Selection 
 
Subjects of all genders will be considered for inclusion in this study.  There will be no 
racial, ethnic, or gender discrimination.  Cognitively impaired and institutionalized persons 
will not participate in this study.  Criteria for exclusion or withdrawal from the study are based on the presence of other disease processes that may interfere with the interpretation of our results or situations that may be harmful to the health of subjects.  
10.2     Rationale for the Exclusion of Children  
Participant older than 18  will be considered for inclusion in this study. There is not 
sufficient supporting data to establish an upper limit or safe intake of fish oil/omega -3 fatty 
acids, however, the FDA has ruled that intakes of up to 3 g/d of marine omega -[ADDRESS_851487] be used by [CONTACT_636900]. Contraception use will be determined by a questionnaire given to the subjects at time of enrollment. 
10.4 Inclusion of NIH Sta ff 
NIH staff (employees, NIH contractors, special volunteers, guest researchers, and trainees) 
may voluntarily participate in this protocol.   
• If the individual requesting to participate in the protocol is a co -worker, the consent from the 
NIH staff member (co -worker) will not be obtained by [CONTACT_20782]’s direct supervisor 
but by [CONTACT_636901] a 
co-worker .

 • Neither participation nor refusal to participate as a subject in this protocol will have an 
effect, either beneficial or adverse, on the participant’s employment or position at NIH.   
• The consenting staff member will make th e NIH Information Sheet on Staff Research 
Participation available to staff members who are considering enrolling in research. ( SOP 
14F, Appendix C Appendix A  of the protocol ) 
• Employee subjects’ privacy and confidentiality will be respected by [CONTACT_636902].  However, all subjects 
will be made aware that there are limits to these protections.  
• Recruitment, enrollment and compensation of NIH employee subjects will be consistent 
with the Guidelines for the Inclusion of Staff in NIH Intramural Research Studies 
(December 2015) (SOP 14F, Appendix A) and NIH Policy Manual Chapter 2300- 630-
3,”Leave Policy for NIH Employees Participating in NIH Medical Research Studies” 
(HRPP SOP 14F, Appe ndix B). 
10.5    Evaluation of Benefits and Risks/Discomforts 
Benefits: There are no direct benefits to the patient . However , omega -[ADDRESS_851488] 
been shown to decrease triglyceride levels in several clinical trials.  These benefits may lead 
to a decreased risk of future cardiovascular events.  Routine clinical laboratory testing and disclosure of results will be available to all subjects.  Subjects are also entitled to being notified of res ults from the clinical cardio -ankle vascular measurement.  
 Risks/Benefit Analysis:  
As of June 25, 2019, this study is now closed to new subject accrual and continues in data  
analysis only and the level of risk is minimal.  
 
Risk (45 CFR 46.102 (h)(i)): The  research involves no more than minimal risk to subjects  
and 
no prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects, but likely to yield generalizable knowledge 
about the condition or disorder under study.  
 
Study Agent:  
EPA-  or DHA -rich fish oil, commercially available fish oil supplements have minimum 
risk to subjects.  
Generally, a dverse effects of omega -[ADDRESS_851489] between individuals receiving Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_87494] (Plavix).  
The most common side effects of f ish oil includ e taste perversion, and eructation 
(belching).  Participants will be notified of these effects in the informed consent document. Any subject exhibiting s ymptoms of this condition including palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], rapid heart rate, or 
shortness of breath will instructed to go to the emergency room immediately and be withdrawn from the study. Individuals with an unknown allergy to fish or shellfish not 
disclosed at screening may experience an anaphylactic reaction, which will also be instructed 
to go immediately to an emergency room and will require withdrawal from the study.  In rare 
cases, fish oil supplement  can trigger allergic reactions. Symptoms may include diffi culty 
breathing, swelling of the face, fever, or flu- like symptoms and a skin rash.  Some studies

 reported consumption of omega -3-fatty acids is associated with a prolongation of bleeding 
time. However, the prolongation of bleeding time has not been shown to surpass normal limits 
and did not result in clinically significant bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]35,36. Any patient currently treated 
with an anticoagulant will be excluded from this study.  
 Blood Draw: Subjects may feel lightheaded or dizzy after having blood drawn.  There 
may be pain at the vein puncture site and a slight risk of bruising.  To minimize this r isk, the 
routine blood- drawing protocol will be followed and pressure will be applied to the area.  
 The protocol will follow the NIH Clinical Center MAS policy M95 -9 guidelines for limits 
of blood drawn for research purpose in the Clinical Center. For adul ts, no more than 10.5 
mL/kg or 550 mL, whichever is smaller, will be drawn for research purposes over any 8- week 
period.  
 Cardio- Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI): Inflation of blood pressure cuffs may cause 
transient discomfort. Subjects with fragile skin may s uffer minor trauma (as per ABIs, related 
to usual BP measurements). This procedure involves the use of a VaSera VS -1500N system; 
an FDA approved vascular screening system.  
10.[ADDRESS_851490] will receive a signed copy of the informed consent document.  A copy will also be placed in the shadow chart.  A member of the protocol team will be available to answer questions about the study to be performed.   
An individual  who is an AI on the protocol but not a co-worker will obtain consent from NIH 
employees . NIH employees will be given the NIH Information Sheet on Employee Research 
Participation  to help them understand the possible consequences of participation.  
10.7   P atient Advocate  
A patient’s rights representative is available to patients on this protocol.  The 
representative can be reached at  [PHONE_2331] and is located in Building 10.  Patients may 
ask any questions about the study and may withdraw their consent at any time.

 17. APPENDIX A: NIH INFORMATION SHEET ON STAFF RESEARCH 
PARTICIPATION (DECEMBER 2015)  
As an NIH employee, contractor, Special Volunteer, Guest Researcher, or trainee, you  may  
participate in intramural research studies unless it is prohibited by [CONTACT_636907] 
(IC), or if you are excluded by [CONTACT_636908]. The 
inclusion of NIH staff in a particular protocol must also be approved by [CONTACT_36985]. You may be 
motivated by [CONTACT_107699], a commitment to research in your own or related fields, or want 
access to clinical trials of potential direct therapeutic benefit.  When deciding, you should 
make an informed decision about participation. This  information sheet offers some points to 
consider for NIH staff who are considering  research participation at NIH.  
 
First, similar to an y individual who is considering research participation, you should seek 
adequate information about the study purpose, what is required of you in terms of 
procedures, interventions and time, and the potential risks and benefits of participation.  For 
more information, see the NIH Clinical Center’s public website “Are Clinical Studies  for You?” 
at http://www.cc.nih.gov/participate/studies.shtml . 
 When you are thinking about participation in a research study that is being conducted by 
[CONTACT_107700], or others with whom you work closely in your laboratory, branch, or  unit, 
you should consider some additional factors:  
 A. Possible bias: Are you confident that you can be unbias ed about reporting  answers, side 
effects, or other information that could influence the study outcome  or risk to you?  
 B. Confidentiality: Are you comfortable sharing your medical history (including, for example, 
mental health history or STDs) and your soc ial history (e.g. substance  use) with study 
investigators who may be your coworkers, or with the possibility  of them discovering  
something about your health during the study (e.g.  pregnancy status or a new diagnosis)? 
Although every effort will be made to  protect your information and keep it private and 
confidential, your information will be available in medical records and it will be available to  
authorized users  outside of the study team, both in an identifiable and unidentified manner.   
 C. Pressure : Do you perceive any pressure or expectations from your supervisor  or 
colleagues regarding participation? Could that pressure influence your  decision or make it 
difficult for you to choose whether or not to participate?  Remember that it is your choice 
whether or not to participate and that your decision to participate or not should not have an 
effect, either beneficial or adverse, on your position at NIH.  
 D. Time and Compensation:  Can you take time off from work to complete the  study  
requirements or participat e solely during non- duty hours? Can you receive  compensation for  
your participation in this study? Will your supervisor give you  permission to participate

 during work hours? See the NIH Policy Manual [ADDRESS_851497] Policy for NIH Employees 
Participating  in NIH Medical Research  Studies.  
 
E. Consent Process:  Is the person obtaining your consent for the study your  supervisor, a 
subordinate, or co -worker? If so, is there an independent person monitoring the consent 
process? If the study PI [CONTACT_832] a supervisor and intends to  obtain consent from you, an 
independent person (e.g., through Bioethics or the  NIMH Human Subjects Protections Unit 
[HSPU], or others as approved by [CONTACT_36985]) must monitor the consent process. If the person 
obtaining consent from y ou is a co -worker then an independent person (e.g., through 
Bioethics or the NIMH  HSPU, or others as approved by [CONTACT_1201]) may be required to monitor 
the consent process, as determined by [CONTACT_107701].  
 
If you are thinking of enrolling as a subject at the NIH Clinical Center and you have any  
questions or concerns, please contact [CONTACT_167907] 
(OHSRP) at 301- 402-3444 and/ or the Patient Representative if you are  thinking of enrolling 
as a subject at the NI H Clinical Center on [ADDRESS_851498] local site leadership.

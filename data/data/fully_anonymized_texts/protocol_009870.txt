potential therapeutic benefits of XT -150 for the treatment of FJOA pain are:  
• Increased mobility for many weeks following a single dose of XT -150 
• Reduction in requirement for pain medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
• Reduction in pain symptoms for many weeks following a single dose of XT-150. 
4.4.2. Known Risks  
Intra -articular injection in the knee with XT -[ADDRESS_989369] commonly minor injection site reactions.  
4.4.3. Potential Risks  
Nonclinical studies and clinical studies with XT -150 are described in the IB. XT-150 posed 
minimal risk in these studies. General risks associated with IA injection are injection site 
reactions and infection, which will be explicitly captured in follow- up safety assessments.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety of DNA as a Therapeutic Agent 
DNA as a t herapeutic agent has been well tolerated. The main theoretical safety concerns 
regarding the clinical use of DNA are that they might integrate with the host/patient DNA, or that injection of foreign DNA might stimulate anti-DNA antibodies or an autoimmune reaction (Prazeres 2014 ).  
With both DNA vaccines and DNA plasmids, the risk of integration was repeatedly found to be low with years of research into the possibility ( FDA 2007; Prazeres 2014) . With plasmids, the 
potential for integration has been removed by [CONTACT_724740]. In fact, excluding these elements 
lowers the risk of plasmid integration to less than the rate of naturally occurring mutations (Prazeres 2014 ). XT-150 has been designed to transiently express a variant of human IL-10 
without integrating into the genome. 
Immunogenicity of DNA appears to be low ( Ferraro 2011) , and correlates to the lack of success 
of DNA agents (even pathoge nic bacterial sequences) as vaccines. No link has been found 
between plasmid DNA injections and any clinical markers of autoimmunity ( Prazeres 2014 ). In 
addition, DNA plasmids have been used in research and development for 25 years. Synthetic 
vectors share the non -infectious properties of viral vectors and elicit low immunogenicity and 
lower toxicity compared to viral vectors ( Xu 2011; Gôrecki 2006). 
Xalud Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol XT- 150-1- [ADDRESS_989370] reported IL-10 protein therapy to be safe in humans. The 
safety of IL -10 protein injections was studied in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 μg/kg. 
Details of these studies can be found in the IB.  
After injection in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 μg/kg, wild-type human IL- 10 protein 
was found to be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_724724] a half-life of 2.0 to 4.5 hours ( Chernoff 1995; Huhn 1996; 
Huhn 1997; Milligan, 2005). In the Huhn, 1997 study, after intravenous administration of high doses of IL-10 protein (100 µg/kg), 42% (15/36) of the volunteers experienced flu- like adverse 
effects, the mos t common of which were headache (11/36 participants, 31%), fever (5/36, 14%), 
and back pain (3/36, 8%). Pharmacodynamic effects from intravenous IL-10 treatment included transient increases in neutrophils and monocytes, and decreases in lymphocytes, which peaked around 6 hours after injection ( Chernoff, 1995) . When given intravenously, IL -10 was also found 
to inhibit production of the cytokines IL- 1β and tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF -α), and reduc e 
T-lymphocyte stimulation.  
Recombinant human IL -10 has been clinically tested as a therapy in humans in a number of 
indications without serious or irreversible side effects. In these trials, IL -10 injections of up to 25 
µg/kg were reported to be well tole rated. With chronic intravenous and high doses, statistically 
significant hematological changes were observed, as well as fever. Adverse events of 
neutrophilia, headache, injection site pain, anemia, and nausea were observed with daily dosages 
in patients with Crohn’s Disease.  
As an anti -inflammatory agent, the biological activity of IL -10 is different than that of other 
interleukins. Exogenous IL-10 is the only interleukin shown to be well tolerated. However, the anti-inflammatory activity of IL -10 treatme nt could mask latent infections ( Moore, 2001). Since 
IL-10 has been theorized to mask latent infections, any participant who has a current 
autoimmune condition or documented immunodeficiency, has a history of immunosuppression, or is currently receiving treatment with immunosuppressive agents is excluded from this study.  
Note that XT -150 is a sterile aqueous formulation of a plasmid designed to transiently express a 
proprietary variant of IL -10. XT-150 expression of the variant IL- 10 is expected to be safer than 
systemic injection of active IL -10 protein as therapy for the following reasons:  
• Rather than injections of IL -[ADDRESS_989371] transiently  and at a much lower concentration.  
• The IL-10v levels from XT-150 expression will be localized in the intra- articular joint 
space. Low systemic levels of IL -10 from XT -150 treatment may be present for short 
periods of time and if present are unlikely to l ead to adverse effects,  
. 
4.4.5. Possible Anticipated Adverse Events and Clinical Monitoring  
Anticipated AEs for which there will be specific safety monitoring in humans will be based on 
the preclinical studies  as well as the published reports of studies of 
IL-10 protein injections to healthy volunteers. In a publication of the incidence and 
characteristics of intra -articular facet joint injection by [CONTACT_455781], 2020, the incidence of major 
procedure- related complications, such as local injections site infection, was demonstrated to be

Version 3.0, 08Jun2022  Confidential  Page 43 of 65 10. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
10.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety will be assessed through the evaluation of AEs, vital signs, and serum laboratory data 
according to the Schedules of Assessments and Procedures presented in Table  1 and assessment 
of anti- IL-10 antibodies as described in Section  12. 
10.2. Adverse Events 
Medical history will be collected for all participants at the time of informed consent. After consent, all adverse events ( AEs)/serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be collected  through the 
last study visit on Day 270 . All AEs/SAEs that occur during or after the time of study drug 
treatment will be considered treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs). The Investigator will assess all 
AEs and SAEs and will record the following information on the appropriate CRF page and SAE 
Report Form (as applicable) : 
• Event term  
• Date of onset  
• Date of resolution or stabilization  
• Severi ty 
• Relationship to study drug  
• Action taken with study medication  
Medically indicated laboratory tests (emergency or unscheduled tests) should be conducted at the 
local laboratory. The Investigator should employ best medical judgment in determining how to 
manage AEs and SAEs. Any questions regarding AE or SAE management should be directed to 
the Medical Monitor.  
10.3. Adverse Event Reporting  
The Sponsor has obligations for expedited reporting of SAEs meeting specific criteria to worldwide regul atory authorities. Therefore, the Sponsor must be notified immediately regarding 
any SAE that occurs after informed consent.  
All SAEs must be reported to the Medical Monitor or C ontract R esearch Organization (CRO) 
Drug Safety Team  within 24 hours of the investigational site’s knowledge of the event. 
All SAEs and discontinuations due to AEs will be reported to the IRB based on the IRB’s 
reporting requirements. 
The study site will transmit a SAE report to the CRO Drug Safety Team by [CONTACT_477074]  
(email is preferred method) within [ADDRESS_989385] still be emailed or 
faxed within 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of the event. The study sit es will be provided with 
SAE report forms wherein the following information is requested. 
• Participant identification, Investigator name, and site number  
Xalud Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol XT- 150-1- 0302  
Version 3.0, 08Jun2022  Confidential  Page 44 of 65 • SAE information: event term, onset date, severity, and causal relationship 
• The outcome(s) attributable to the event (i.e., death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or significant 
disability or incapacity, or other important medical event[s])  
• A summary of relevant test results, pertinent laboratory data, and any other relevant 
medical history  
• The first and last dates of study drug administration. NOTE: as this is a double -blind 
study, SAE reports should not indicate specific study drug assignments 
• Indicate if the study drug was discontinued or the study drug administration schedule was modified  
• Supplemental information may include the following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]: laboratory 
results, radiology reports, progress notes, admission and emergency room notes, 
holding and observation notes, discharge summaries, autopsy reports, and death certificates  
In addition, relevant CRF pages should be appended to communicate relevant study drug and participant outcome information. The SAE report should be emailed or faxed  within 24 hours 
with as much of the above information as available at the time. The following minimum 
information is required for reporting an SAE: participant identification, reporting source, the 
event , and the causality assessed by [CONTACT_737] (or medically qualified designee) . 
Supplem ental information may be transmitted using a follow -up SAE report and should not 
delay the initial report. The Sponsor or designee may contact [CONTACT_724748].  
The Investigator must take  all therapeutic measures necessary for resolution of the SAE. Any 
medications or procedures necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded on the 
appropriate pages of the participant’s CRF.  
10.4. Definitions  
10.4.1. Adverse Event  
An AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, and does not imply any 
judgment about causality. An AE can arise with any use of the drug and with any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
Facet Joint Osteoarthritis -related events should not be considered or recorded as AEs or SAEs.  
Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs or SAEs unless they are associated with 
clinical signs or symptoms, or require medical interve ntion. However, each laboratory 
abnormality (e.g., clinically significant changes detected on hematology, or lab chemistries) independent from any underlying medical condition that requires medical or surgical intervention, or that leads to interruption of study drug infusion or discontinuation, must be 
Xalud Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol XT- 150-1- [ADDRESS_989386] be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they 
meet the definition of an AE (or SAE) as described above or in Section  10.4.4. 
10.4.2. Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction  
A suspected adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigational New Drug safety reporting, ‘‘reasonable possibility’’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship between the drug and the 
AE. Suspected adverse drug reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. 
10.4.3. Life-Threatening AE or Life -Threatening Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse drug reaction is considered ‘‘life threatening’’ if, in the view of 
either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or participant at immediate 
risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
10.4.4. Serious AE or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening AE – see definition above  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life fu nctions 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a participant who received study 
drug 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event Definition Clarifications 
• Death is an outcome of an AE, an d not an AE in itself  
• All deaths during study drug administration or up to the follow-up ( FU) visit on Day 
180, regardless of cause or relationship, must be reported  
Xalud Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol XT- 150-1- 0302  
Version 3.0, 08Jun2022  Confidential  Page 46 of 65 • “Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the participant is actively receiving study 
drug at the time of the event 
• “Life -threatening” means that the participant was at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred. This does not include an event that might have led to death, had it occurred with greater severity.  
• Complications that o ccur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98176]. If an AE prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is a SAE.  
• “Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” means the participant has been formally admitted to a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113979], for any length of time. This may or may not be 
overnight. It does not include presentation and care within an emergency department (although an emergency department visit may define a medically important event, 
which is also considered a SAE).  
• The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE or SAE, rather than as the individual signs or symptoms. 
10.4.5. Unexpected AE or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An AE or suspected ad verse drug reaction is considered “unexpected” if:  
• It is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed  
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_106117]) if an Investigator’s Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_131210]) if an Investigator’s Brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  
‘‘Unexpected,’’ as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that 
are mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
10.5. Adverse Event Classification  
10.5.1. Relationship to Investigational Drug 
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non -
serious) ( Table  5). An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an AE. 
Xalud Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol XT- 150-1- 0302  
Version 3.0, 08Jun2022  Confidential  Page 47 of 65 Table  5: Guidelines for Assessing Relationship of Event to Study Drug  
Unrelated  There is little or no chance that the Investigational Product caused the AE; other 
conditions, including concurrent illnesses, progression or expression of the disease 
state, or a reaction to a concomitant medication best explain the event  
Related  The association of the AE with the Investigational Product is unknown, however, the 
AE is not clearly due to another condit ion, or a reasonable temporal association exists 
between the AE and treatment administration and, based on the Investigator's clinical 
experience, the association of the AE with the Investigational Product seems likely  
10.5.2. Severity  
All AEs will be graded for severity to describe the maximum intensity of the AE based on 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 5.0) (National Cancer Institute, 2017). For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined in Table  6 . 
Table  6: Guidelines for Severity Assessments  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or non-invasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (e.g., preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money)  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self -care activities of 
daily living (bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden)  
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5  Death related to adverse event 
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide for determining 
the causal assessment. If the event is believed to be unrelated to study drug administration, then 
an alternative explanation should be provided. 
10.6. Adverse Event Follow -up 
All unresolved SAEs (“ongoing” at discharge) will be followed by [CONTACT_724749].  
10.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
10.7.1. Adverse Events of Noted Interest in IL -10 Protein Trials  
Safety will include the following reported IL -10 protein- associated toxicities as defined by 
[CONTACT_3989] (v5.0). Systemic levels of XT 150 produced IL-10 protein are expe cted to be more than 
1000-fold lower than when given as a protein solution ( Huhn, 1997); and XT -150 will be 
predominately localized to the facet joint space.  
• Grade 1 (unexplained) fever – 38.6°C to 39°C 
Xalud Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol XT- 150-1- 0302  
Version 3.0, 08Jun2022  Confidential  Page 48 of 65 • Grade 2 allergic, cytokine release, or infusion -related reactions - Therapy or infusion 
interruption indicated but responds promptly to symptomatic treatment (e.g., 
antihistamines, NSAIDS, narcotics, IV fluids); prophylactic medications indicated for 
≤24 hours  
• Grade 2 injection site reaction - Pain; lipodystrophy; edema; phlebitis 
• Grade 2 neutropenia - <1500 to 1000/mm3; <1.5 to 1.0 x109/L 
10.7.2. Localized Signs of Infection or Inflammation at the Injection Site  
Events that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], may represent localized signs of infection or inflammation at the XT -150 injection site (e.g., pain, erythema, swelling, pruritus, warmth, 
hematoma, induration) must be recorded as AEs on the CRF. In general, these events will be temporally related to the injection.  
10.8. Toxicity Management 
The Investigator should employ best medical judgment in determining how to manage AEs. Any questions regarding AE management should be directed to the Medical Monitor. 
10.9. Risks for Women of Childbearing Potential or During Pre gnancy 
The risks of XT -[ADDRESS_989387] they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual cycle). The Investigator must immediately notify the Medical Monitor or CRO Drug Sa fety Team of any female participant or 
female partner of any male participant that becomes pregnant at any time during study participation . All pregnancies must be reported to the Medical Monitor  or CRO Drug Safety 
Team using the Pregnancy Report Form with in 24 hours of the investigational site’s knowledge 
of the event. The Medical Monitor/CRO will ask the site to  obtain a separate consent from the 
female participant (or female partner of a male participant) using an IRB-approved template in order to  follow -up periodically during the pregnancy for ongoing health and safety information 
through the end of the pregnancy, as applicable.  
Any anomalies, complications, abnormal outcomes, or birth defect(s) observed in the child must 
be reported as a SAE using the SAE Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator or study 
personnel’s first knowledge. While elective and uncomplicated induced abortion not required for 
medical reasons does not constitute an AE or SAE (even if the patient or patient’s partner is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_724727]), spontaneous abortion is considered a fatal event and must be 
reported as an AE and SAE, as appropriate. 
All pregnancies will be reported to the IRB based on the IRB’s reporting requirements.

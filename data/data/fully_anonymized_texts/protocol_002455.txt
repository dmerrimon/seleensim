 Methodology:  
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double- blind, active controlled , 3-arm study in approximately 
[ADDRESS_42200] 2  cohorts. Both cohorts will enroll in 
parallel.  
 
Cohort 1 will enroll about 60 subjects undergoing bunionectomy to obtain information on PK profile, 
pharmacody namics (PD), efficacy, and safety. Subjects in this cohort will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive 
combined sciatic (in the popliteal fossa) and saphenous (in the adductor canal) nerve blocks with EXPAREL, 
EXPAREL admixed with 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974], or 0.25%  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]. Only select sites will enroll 
subjects for Cohort 1.  
 
Cohort 2 will enroll about 60 subjects to obtain information on efficacy and safety. Subjects in this cohort 
will receive combined sciatic (in the popliteal fossa) and saphenous (in th e adductor canal) nerve blocks. 
Subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive EXPAREL, EXPAREL admixed with 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974], 
or 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974], and will be stratified  by [CONTACT_40557][INVESTIGATOR_007].  
  
Subjects in Cohort [ADDRESS_42201] enrolled and provided complete 
assessment data for their primary efficacy outcome.  
 
Obtaining Informed Consent 
Potential subjects undergoing one of the eligible surgeries will be approached by [CONTACT_1755]/or the 
study staff for informed c onsent up to [ADDRESS_42202] to review the informed consent form (ICF)  
and have all the questions answered by [CONTACT_093]/study staff prior to providing informed 
consent .  
 
Screening  
Subjects may be screened up to [ADDRESS_42203] be completed after written informed consent is pr ovided and prior to surgery.  
 
The following screening procedures should be performed after the ICF is signed: explain study purpose and 
procedures, assess eligibility, record medical/surgical history, record prior and concomitant medications, 
record demographics and baseline characteristics including Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), record subject height and weight for body mass index ( BMI ) calculation, assess chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_40476] [ADDRESS_42204] adverse events  (AEs)/serious 
adverse events ( SAEs ) starting when the ICF is signed and record concomitant medications for treatment of 
AEs.   
 
Day of S urgery  
On the day of surgery, before administration of the block, the subject must record responses to the following 
pain assessments:  
• Pain intensity scores on the numeric rating scale (NRS) as “What was your worst pain in the last 
30 days?”  
• Pain intensity scores ( using the NRS) “What was your average pain in the last 30 days?”  
In addition, the following procedures will be conducted: conduct urine pregnancy test for women of 
childbearing potential , record changes to concomitant medications since screening , confirm eligibility and

Note: Cohort 1 will enroll bunionectomy subjects only.  
Breakthrough Pain Medication : 
All opi[INVESTIGATOR_40478] (pain medications) administered post- surgery through Post-operative Day 
(POD ) 14 should be recorded.  
Medications will be provided on a n as needed ( PRN)  basis in relation to the breakthrough pain intensity. The 
intent is to use the guide below  in a step -wise approach; acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory 
drugs ( NSAIDs ) should be used for the initial treatment of post- surgical pain and escalation to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (and 
subsequent increased dose of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) should be implemented if the initial pain treatment (and initial opi[INVESTIGATOR_40479]) is insufficient for pain relief . Opi[INVESTIGATOR_40480] a schedule . 
• For the initial treatment of post- surgical pain, subjects may receive either acetaminophen or 
NSAIDs without exceeding the maximum daily dose.

Duration of Subject Participation in Study : 
Participation will begin upon signing of the ICF. No more than 30 days should pass between signing the ICF 
and study drug administration. Study drug administration will be on the same day of surgery. A follow -up 
phone call will occur on POD  14 (±3 days). Therefore, each subject may participate in the study for up to a 
maximum of 47 days.  
Efficacy Assessments:  
• Pain intensity measured using the NRS as “How much pain are you experiencing right now?” will 
be assessed:  
o Upon arrival in the Post -anesthesia Care Unit (PACU)  (±5 min)  
o Every 15 minutes in the PACU  (±5 min)  
o At PACU discharge  (±5 min)  
o Every [ADDRESS_42215] -surgery: 6 h (±2 h), 12 h (±2 h), 
18 h (±2 h), 24 h (±2 h), 30 h (±2 h), 36 h (±2 h), 42 h (±2 h), 48 h (±2 h), 54 h (±2 h), 60 h 
(±2 h), 66 h (±2 h), 72 h (±2 h), 78 h (±3 h), 84 h (±3 h), 90 h (±3 h), and 96 h (±3 h)

• Pain intensity using the NRS once daily at 21:00 (±3 h) from POD  1 to POD  14 measured as “What 
was your average pain in the last 24 hours?”  
Subjects will be instructed to focus all NRS pain intensity ratings on the operative ankle/foot, and not other 
locations where they may be experiencing pain.  
In addition, subject satisfaction with pain management using 1 question from the International Pai n Outcome 
(IPO) questionnaire will be recorded at 96 hours (±3 h) post -surgery.

Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Assessments  (Cohort 1 bunionectomy subjects only) :  
Blood samples for PK assessment and the sensory/motor function assessments will be assessed at scheduled 
timepoints in C ohort 1 subjects only ( See Table 2). 
Pharmacokinetic Endpoint:  
The following model -predicted PK endpoints will be determined:  
• Area under the plasma concentration- versus -time curve (AUC)  
• Maximum plasma concentration (C max) and time of C max (Tmax) 
• The apparent terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2el) 
• Apparent clearance (CL/F)  
• Apparent volume of distribution (Vd)  
Pharmacodynamic Endpoint:  
The following pharmacodynamics endpoints will be determined:  
• Median time to onset of sensory block and motor block  
• Median duration of sensory block and motor block   
Statistical Methods:   
A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized for this study prior to database lock. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_40559]. Efficacy and safety endpoint analyses will be described in the SAP.  
 
Efficacy data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_21964] . Superiority of treatment with EXPAREL

main effect for the primary efficacy endpoint of AUC of the NRS pain intensity scores from [ADDRESS_42221] the model if deemed 
necessary . Other efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using ANOVA, logistic regression model, chi- square 
tests, and Kaplan -Meier and log -rank tests, as appropriate.  
 
Safety and pharmacokinetic endpoints will b e summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_40560]:   
The sample size was calculated based on the primary efficacy endpoint of the AUC of the NRS pain intensity 
scores from [ADDRESS_42222] -surgery  comparing EXPAREL to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] .  
 
The sample size for Cohort 1 was based on the number of subjects necessary to characterize the PK following

 7. INTRODUCTION  
7.1. Indication 
EXPAREL® was developed to extend pain relief with a single -dose administration without the use 
of indwelli ng catheters and to decrease the requirement for supplemental opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007].  
EXPAREL is indicated for single -dose infiltration in adults to produce postsurgical local analgesia 
and as an interscalene brachial plexus nerve block to produce postsurgica l regional analgesia.  
Effective postsurgical pain control is a critical element in subject recovery following surgery, as 
the majority of subjects may experience significant pain, particularly in the first few days . 
Improved postsurgical pain management co ntributes to better healing, faster subject mobilization, 
shortened hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], and reduced healthcare costs ( American Society of Anesthesiologists 
Task Force on Pain Management 1995 ). 
7.2. Current Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/Treatments  
Current modalities of postsurgical  analgesia include wound infiltration with local anesthetics 
combined with the systemic administration of analgesics (multimodal therapy). Multimodal 
therapy usually includes opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], which have considerable drawbacks, including time 
and resources required for monitoring opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related side effects. A reduction in the use of 
postsurgical  opi[INVESTIGATOR_40495] (AEs), such a s respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], nausea, vomiting, constipation, somnolence, pruritus, 
and urinary retention.  
With over 70 million surgeries performed annually in the US, postsurgical  pain is a ubiquitous 
condition among the US population. While it is a predictab le component of the postsurgical  
process, such pain is often poorly managed, resulting in clinical and physiological changes that increase morbidity and mortality (inability to ambulate early, etc.), diminish quality of life, and 
extend length of stay, the reby [CONTACT_40561][INVESTIGATOR_40496] ( Oderda 2007) and reducing subject 
satisfaction . Effective relief of acute pain with minimal opi[INVESTIGATOR_40497], on the other hand, 
may improve clinical outcomes, avoid complications (like del ay in regaining bowel function or an 
inability to tolerate liquid and solid oral [PO] intake, etc.), and conserve healthcare resources . As 
such, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations requires that all 
healthcare facilities pract ice adequate pain management and monitor opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related AEs 
(Apfelbaum 2003).  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_40498]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- only regimens are common and intravenous (IV) subject- controlled analgesia is 
a widely used delivery system for morphine sulfate . However, AEs related to opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499] 
(e.g., nausea, vomiting, ileus , confusion) represent one important reason that there is a need to 
develop opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- sparing strategies . Indeed, fear of gastrointestinal AEs, such as nausea and 
vomiting, as well as respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], present major limitations for the widespread use of  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467] ( Chernin 2001, Viscusi 2009 ). Furthermore, management of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related AEs 
often requires medical attention (e.g., opi[INVESTIGATOR_40500], antiemetic agents) and increased 
pharmacy/nursing time, which may raise healt hcare expenses ( Carroll 1994).

 7.3. EXPAREL (Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40494])  
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40501] -acting local anesthetics, but even so it has a limited duration of 
action after local administration, usually less than 8 hours . EXPAREL (Pacira Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc., [“Pacira”]) is a bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40469] . It consists of microscopic 
spherical, multivesicular liposomes (DepoFoam® drug delivery system) organized in a 
honeycomb- like structure compri sing numerous non- concentric internal aqueous chambers 
containing a bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40502] a concentration of 13.3 mg/mL . Each chamber is separated from 
adjacent chambers by [CONTACT_40562]. The lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], cholesterol, and triglycerides) 
are natur ally occurring or close analogs of endogenous lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] . Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40503] a complex mechanism involving reorganization of the barrier lipid 
membranes and subsequent diffusion of the drug over an extended period of time.  
EXPAREL was approved by [CONTACT_40563] 2011 for administration into the surgical site to 
produce postsurgical analgesia. The active ingredient (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) and inactive ingredient 
(DepoFoam) of EXPAREL are each contained, though separately, in FDA -approved products.  
• Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40473] (HCl) solution, a well -characterized anesthetic/analgesic, 
with more than 35 years of use in the US.  
• DepoFoam, a liposomal extended -release formulation contained in the marketed 
product DepoCyt® (1999). The form of DepoFoam used in EXPAREL has a slightly 
different mixture of liquid components than that used in DepoCyt. 
7.4. Summary of Human Experience with EXPAREL  
Pacira has conducted more than 36 clinical studies and one observational follow -up study to 
investigate EX PAREL. Across these studies, over 1800 human subjects received EXPAREL at 
doses ranging from 2 mg to 665 mg (equivalent to 2 mg to 750 mg bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]) administered 
by [CONTACT_40564]: local infiltration into the surgical site, subcutaneous, perineural ( or nerve block), 
and epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873]. EXPAREL has been generally well tolerated and, in active comparator studies, AEs 
occurred at a similar rate as the corresponding bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40504]. 
EXPAREL was initially approved by [CONTACT_40563] 2011 for single -dose administration into the 
surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia. The indication was amended and approved by [CONTACT_40565] 2018 to read: “EXPAREL is indicated for single -dose infiltration in adults to produce 
postsurgical local analgesia and as an interscalene brachial plexus block to produce postsurgical 
regional analgesia.” Since its approval, EXPAREL has been administered to approximately 5 million subjects in the US (Jan uary 2019). 
Following the initial approval of EXPAREL, numerous c linical studies were conducted in which 
EXPAREL was administered via various routes of administration, including interscalene nerve block ( Sternlicht 2014, Feierman 2014) .

 7.5. Rationale for the Study  
Pacira is investigating the pharmacokinetics (PK) , efficacy, and safety of EXPAREL administered 
as combined sciatic (in the popliteal fossa) and saphenous (in the adductor canal) nerve block in 
healthy adult subjects undergoing lower extremity surgeries .  
A dose of 20 mL (266 mg) EXPAREL  with 20 mL of saline or EXPAREL admixed with 20 mL  
(50 mg) 0.2 5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40506] 40 mL (100mg) 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40507] 20 mL 
volumes in sciatic nerve (in th e popliteal fossa) and the saphenous nerve (in the adductor canal) . 
8. OBJECTIVES  
The study objectives following  the administration of study drug as a combined sciatic (in the 
popliteal fossa) and saphenous (in the adductor canal) nerve blocks in subjects undergoing lower extremity surgeries are listed below.  
8.1. Primary Objective 
To compare the magnitude of the analges ic effect following a single dose injection of EXPAREL

 Cohort 1 will enroll about 60 subjects undergoing bunionectomy to obtain information on PK 
profile, pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy, and safety. Subjects in this cohort will be randomized 
(1:1:1) to receive combined sciatic (in the popliteal fossa)  and saphenous (in the adductor canal) 
nerve blocks  with EXPAREL,  EXPAREL  admixed with  0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39952] l, or 
0.25%  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]. Only select sites will enroll subjects for Cohort 1.  
Cohort 2 will enroll about 60 subjects to obtain information on efficacy and safety. Subjects in this 
cohort will receive combined sciatic (in the popliteal fossa)  and saphenous (in the adductor canal) 
nerve blocks . Subjects will be randomized ( 1:1:1) to receive EXPAREL, EXPAREL admixed with 
0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39952] l, or 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974], and will be stratified  by [CONTACT_40566][INVESTIGATOR_007].

 9.2.1. Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_40510], the investigator, or officials from regulatory authorities discover conditions during the 
study that indicate that the study or study site should be terminated, this action may be taken after 
Pacira has consulted with appropriate regulatory authorities and notified the investigator(s).  
The Pacira Medical Monitor and Pharmacovigilance team review all serious adverse events 
(SAEs) reported from Pacira clinical studies on an ongoing basis and in real time (i.e., as the events 
are reported) . The Medical Monitor is responsible for temporarily pausing the study if the type, 
frequency, or seriousnes s/severity of such events suggests a potential threat to the safety of the 
study subjects. If such action is taken, a thorough review of all available data will be performed. Based on the results of this review and discussions with investigators and/or reg ulatory authorities, 
the study may be restarted or permanently terminated  as warranted . 
This trial design also includes efficacy stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_40511]  15.8. 
In addition, any death will be thoroughly reviewed, and appropriate action taken.  
9.3. Discussion of Study Design 
This phase 3, multicenter, double -blinded, randomized, active controlled study will enroll 
approximately 120 subjects  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EXPAREL , EXPAREL  admixed 
with 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39952] l and 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40512] a combined sciatic 
(in the popliteal fossa)  and saphenous (in the adductor canal) nerve blocks , in subjects undergoing 
lower extremity surgeries.  
Only Cohort 1 subjects , 60 subjects all undergoing bunionectomy surgery, will provide blood 
samples for PK assessments. Subjects in this cohort will provide information on efficacy and safety 
of EXPAREL , EXPAREL  admixed with  0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39952] l, and 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] .  
Cohort 2 will assess the efficacy and safety of EXPAREL , EXPAREL  admixed with  
0.25%  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39952] l, and 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40513] 60 subjects undergoing lower extremity 
surgery.  
The three treatment arms of the study for Cohort 1 and 2 are as follows:  
• EXPAREL arm:  subjects randomized to th is treatment arm will receive 20 mL  
(266 mg) EXPAR EL mixed with 20  mL saline.  
• EXPAREL admix arm : subjects randomized to this treatment  arm will receive 
20 mL  (266 mg) EXPAREL  admixed with  20 m L (50 mg)  0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] . 
• Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40477] : subjects randomized to this treatment arm  will receive 40 mL 
(100 mg) 0. 25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39952] l.

Given the COVID- [ADDRESS_42253]'s recent or potential exposure 
to COVID- 19, or if the subject is not medically fit/cleared for surgery due to suspected COVID -
19 illness/symptoms, the subject must be  exclude d per Exclusion criterion #8. 
10.3. Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment  
Every reasonable effort will be made to maintain subject compliance and participation in the study. 
Reasons for discontinuation of any subject from the study will be recorded. 
If any clinically significant event or condition  is uncovered during the study period (e.g., excessive 
bleeding, acute sepsis) that might render the subject medically unstable or compromise the 
subject’s postsurgical  course, the subject should be withdrawn from the study and the event or 
condition shoul d be reported as an AE or SAE.  
If a subject withdraws from the study and has an ongoing AE, every effort must be made to follow up on such events until satisfactory resolution is obtained or further follow -up is otherwise no 
longer warranted.  
10.3.1. Withdrawal Se condary to Adverse Events 
If a subject experiences an AE that renders the subject incapable of continuing with the remaining assessments, the subject will be discontinued from further participation in the study. A final 
evaluation, including the End of Study assessments (see Section  10.3.3) , should be performed so 
that the subject’s study participation can be terminated in a safe and orderly manner.  
Any subject who discontinues because of an AE should be instructed to notify the study personnel 
of any abnormal symptoms and to come to the study site if medical evaluation is needed and the

case report form (CRF).  
In addition, the subject may be withdrawn from the study if the subject meets the following criterion during or after the surgery:  
Any clinically significant event or condition uncovered during the surgery (e.g., excessive bleeding, acute sepsis) that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], renders the subject medically unstable or complicates the subject’s postsurgical  course.  
10.3.2. Voluntary  or Study Investigator Withdrawal  
Subjects are free to discontinue from the study at any time, without prejudice to future treatment. A subject may be discontinued from the study if the subject refuses study treatment (i.e ., combined 
sciatic [in the popliteal fossa ] and saphenous [in the adductor canal ] nerve blocks ) or refuses to 
comply with study procedures. Subjects should be encouraged to complete the study safety assessments. Reasons for discontinuation from the study will be recorded.  
If a subje ct is discontinued by [CONTACT_40567], the subject will be asked to complete a final evaluation, including the early termination  assessments (see Section  10.3.3), so that the subject can be withdrawn in a safe 
and orderly manner . 
After termination from the study, the subject may be followed for safety including monitoring of AEs thro ugh POD  14.

 11. TREATMENTS  
11.1. Treatments to be Administered 
Cohort 1: PK, PD, E fficacy, and S afety  
The participants enrolled in Cohort 1 will provide blood samples  for PK  and measures for efficacy 
and safety. About 60 subjects undergoing bunionectomy will be enrolled in this cohort. On the  day 
of surgery, eligible subjects will be randomized ( 1:1:1) to receive EXPAREL (n=20), EXPAREL  
admixed with 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39912] (n=20), or 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] (n= 20) as a combined 
sciatic (in the popliteal fossa)  and saphenous (in the adductor canal) nerve blocks .  
Cohort 2: Efficacy and S afety  
The participants enrolled in Cohort 2 will provide measures for efficacy and safety. About 
60 subjects will be enrolled in this cohort. On day of surgery, eligible subjects will be randomized 
1:1:1 to receive EXPAREL (n= 20), EXPAREL admixed with 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] (n= 20), or 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] (n=20). All subjects will receive combined sciatic (in the popliteal fossa)  and 
saphenous (in the adductor canal) nerve blocks , by [CONTACT_40558][INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
Treatments for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2  
On the day of surgery, Cohort 1 and 2 subjects  will receive ultrasound -guided combined sciatic 
(in popliteal fossa) and adductor canal nerve block with one of the following treatments:  
• EXPAREL  arm: subjects randomized to this treatment arm will receive 20 mL 
(266 mg) EXPAREL mixed with 20 mL saline  
• EXPAREL admix arm : subjects randomized to th is treatment arm will receive 20 mL 
(266 mg) EXPAREL admixed with 20 mL (50 mg) 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]  
• Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40477] :  subjects randomized to this treatment arm will receive 40 mL 
(100 mg) 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40515] P rocedure:   
Subjects may be lightly sedated with 1  to 2 mg of midazolam IV before the block procedure. The 
study drug ( EXPAREL, EXPAREL admixed with 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39912], or 0.25%  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40516]) will be administered under  ultrasound guidance 90 mi n (±30 min) prior to surgery.  
For all arms, the total volume (40 mL) will be split such that 20 mL will be administered as the 
sciatic nerve block (in popliteal fossa) and 20 mL will be administered as the saphenous nerve 
block (in the adductor canal ).  
11.1.1. Study Drug Administration Considerations  
As described in the EXPAREL Ful l Prescribing Information  (November 2018), no agents are to 
be admixed with EXPAREL (e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], dexamethasone, clonidine) other than bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40516]. Lidocaine and other local anesthetics are not permitted to be locally administered during the 
surgery because they are known to interact with EXPAREL, resulting in the displacement of 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40517]. When a topi[INVESTIGATOR_40518], 
the solutions should not be allowed to come in contact [CONTACT_40568] (e.g., the area must be dry

 before EXPAREL is administered) . Upon discovering use of any prohibited therapy and/or 
medication during or after surgery, the investigator should document all events that led to the 
deviation, write a note to file, and notify t he Pacira Medical Monitor accordingly.  
EXPAREL may not be administered to a subject if the vial has been open for more than [ADDRESS_42255] be exercised to prevent incidental intravenous administration of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40519].  
11.2. Identity of the Investigational Products 
11.2.1. Description of EXPAREL  
EXPAREL (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40469]) is formulated as a sterile, non -pyrogenic , 
white to off -white, preservative -free homogenous suspension of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40520] (DepoFoam drug delivery system). Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40521] a nominal 
concentration of 13.3 mg/mL. For this study, EXPAREL will be provided in 20- mL, 1.3% 
(13.3 mg/mL) single -use, clear glass vials. EXPAREL v ials should be stored refrigerated at 2°C 
to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). 
11.2.2. Description of Reference Product  
The reference product is 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40522] (in popliteal 
fossa) and adductor canal nerve block. 
11.3. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment 
11.3.1. Randomization Scheme  
This is a randomized study. Cohort 1 will enroll approximately 60 total subjects  undergoing 
bunionectomy surgery  randomized 1:1:1 in the EXPAREL arm, EXPAREL admixed with 
0.25%  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40523] (“admix” arm) , and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40477] .   
Cohort 2 will enroll approximately 60 total subjects undergoing distal lower extremity surgery , 
20 subjects  in each treatment arm ; EXPAREL  arm, EXPAREL admix  arm, and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40524]. Subjects will be randomized 1 :1:[ADDRESS_42256] 
Pacira Pharmaceuticals , Inc.       402-C-333 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  [ADDRESS_42257] is identified as being qualified for the study in accordance with the eligibility 
criteria (see Section  10.1  and Section  10.2 ), the investigator or designee will obtain a 
randomization assignment  on the day of surgery . In rare cases, i f a subject has an early morning 
surgery and there would not be enough time to obtain study drug from the pharmacy, sites will be 
permitted to randomize the subject the day before  the surgery (after contact[CONTACT_40569]) . The e-diary may be activated during the screening 
period in order to perform set -up and training,  but no data entry may occur in the e -diary before 
the day of surgery. The subject will be considered randomized into the study once the study 
treatment assignment is assigned.  
11.3.3. Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw from the study before receiving study drug may be replaced. Once a subject 
number is assigned, subject numbers will not be reused; subjects enrolled to replace those who 
withdr aw will be assigned a unique subject number  and randomized to treatment according to the 
procedures outlined above . Subjects who are randomized but are withdrawn from the study before 
receiving study drug or do not undergo the surgical procedure may be replaced. Additionally, subjects may be replaced if insufficient and/or incomplete data are noted on PK  profiles  or efficacy 
endpoints . 
11.4. Selection of Doses in the Study  
During the clinical development of EXPAREL, single doses ranging from [ADDRESS_42258] shown that, for wound infiltration, a total 
dose of 266 mg (20 mL) of EXPAREL is safe and efficacious . Based on this experience, the FDA -
approved marketed dose of 266 mg was deemed appropriate for this study .  
As a part of the clinical developmental program, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_40525] -escalation study (402- C-122) 
evaluating the PK , PD, and safety of EXPAREL as a sciatic nerve block in the popliteal fossa in 
subjects undergoing bunionectomy was conducte d. The preliminary results for this study showed 
that compared to the EXPAREL 266 mg or 133 mg admixed groups , EXPAREL 266 mg had 
similar NRS pain scores, opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], and onset and duration of block, but produced lower 
PK concentrations of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40508]. Thus, a total dose of 266 mg was deemed appropriate for 
the current study population administered in two halves as 133 mg EXPAREL in each of the sciatic and saphenous nerve  blocks . 
Pacira Pharmaceuticals , Inc.       402-C-333 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  [ADDRESS_42259] safety warrants such unblinding. However, if possible, th e investigator 
should discuss the safety issues with the Pacira Medical Monitor before attempting such 
unblinding. Any unblinding will be documented through immediate notification of the Pacira study team and the investigator within the interactive respons e technology system used for 
randomization. The reason for unblinding will be documented. Any accidental unblinding events (i.e., through mishaps in the operating room or miscommunication among study staff) must be 
reported to Pacira immediately. Any unbli nding performed through the randomization system will 
be recorded as a transaction , and the appropriate study personnel will be notified that such a 
transaction occurred. Any incidence(s) of unblinding will be noted in the clinical study report with a full  discussion of the events leading to the decision to unblind. 
11.5.2. Blinding Procedure  
EXPAREL, EXPAREL admixed with 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] , and 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40526]; therefore, to maintain the double -blind study design, the individu als 
preparing and administering study drug, or transporting unblinded drug will not be allowed to 
perform any of the study assessments after randomization  (with the possible logistical exception 
of drawing blood in the  operating room ( OR) to be processed b y blinded staff for the PK 
assessments) or reveal the assigned study treatment to any other members of the study team at any 
time. Additionally, efforts will be made to prevent the subject from observing the study drug 
syringe . Syringes containing study dr ug will need to be gently inverted several times to re -suspend 
any settling of the study drug that may have occurred prior to administration. The administration 
of study drug will be recorded using the minimal amount of information necessary to avoid unbli nding staff who will be participating in blinded procedures.  
Staff members conducting study- specific, postsurgical assessments and the subjects will remain 
blinded to the assigned treatment throughout the study in part by [CONTACT_40570] .  
If a subject  experiences an SAE, Pacira will not automatically unblind the subject’s treatment, 
unless it is necessary to manage treatment of the SAE. Expedited SAEs will be unblinded by [CONTACT_40571].  
At each site, only the designated unblinded pharmacist will receive unblinded randomization 
assignments ; the designated unblinded pharmacist or administrator will  be responsible for 
preparing study drug. 
No crossover will be permitted between the blin ded and unblinded study site personnel throughout 
the study. The assignment of site monitors will also be segregated. Blinded monitors will review 
CRFs, clinic charts, and all other study -related documents that do not disclose the allocation of 
study treat ment. Care should be taken in recording and review of OR records to not record 
information in an unblinded fashion. Pharmacy or any other clinic records providing unblinded

 • For the  initial treatment of post-surgical  pain, subjects may receive either 
acetaminophen or NSAIDs without exceeding the maximum daily dose.  
• If the initial pain treatment (acetaminophen or NSAIDs ) is insuffici ent for pain relief, 
immediate release PO oxycodone may  be administered in a stepwise approach:  
− Initial dose of 5 mg oxycodone may  be offered ; 
− If the initial opi[INVESTIGATOR_40535], 10 mg oxycodone may be 
offered . 
• If a subject is unable to tolerate PO medication or the PO oxycodone pain relief is 
insufficient, IV morphine (initiated at 2 mg) or hydromorphone (initiated at 0.2 mg) may be administered.  
Post discharge, the subject may be provided with a prescription for oxycodone [ADDRESS_42263] 
may take acetaminophen, NSAIDs , or the prescribed oxycodone  and will be given instructions on 
which medication to take PRN based on the ir pain  intensity.  
11.8. Treatment Compliance 
Not applicable, since study drug (EXPAREL , EXPAREL admix,  or bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]) will be 
administered preoperatively by [CONTACT_5984].  
11.9. Accountability of Study Drug 
Any shipment of EXPAREL for the study will contain an invest igational drug transmittal and 
receipt form to assist the Investigator or designee (e.g., pharmacist) in maintaining current and 
accurate inventory records. At a minimum, the Investigator or designee will maintain accurate 
records demonstrating dates and units of drug received, lot numbers, subjects to whom drug was administered, and accounts of any drug destroyed accidentally or deliberately. The Investigator 
must retain vials containing used, unused, or expi[INVESTIGATOR_40536], as 
instructed by [CONTACT_40574], following confirmation of drug accountability data by [CONTACT_40575]. A record of drug return or destruction will be maintained and provided to Pacira. Inventory records must be readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_40576]. A copy of the inventory records, drug accountability information, and notice of return or destruction will be returned to Pacira at the end of the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  [ADDRESS_42270] scheduled assessment prior 
to surgery. For each sensory assessment performed, all 4 locations (as described in 
Appendix 4, Section  18.4) will be assessed for both light touch and cold (e.g., total of 
8 independent ratings will be performed for each sensory assessment).  
Onset of sensory block  (sciatic and saphenous nerve tracked independently ) will be 
defined as the earliest timepoint with loss of light touch sensation  and/or cold sensation  
along the d istribution of the target nerve distal to the site of the block . 
Offset of sensory block  (sciatic and saphenous nerve tracked independently) will be 
defined as recovery of light touch sensation and/or cold sensation along the distribution of 
the target nerve  distal to the site of the block  on 2 consecutive  assessments.  After offset of 
all sensory assessments  are noted (on 2 consecutive assessments  for all 4  areas for both 
touch and cold sensation ), no subsequent assessments will be conducted.  
Duration of sensory block  will be defined as the time between onset and offset of light 
touch sensory and/or cold sensation block for each nerve in dividually (see Appendix 4, 
Section  18.4 ). 
Assessment of motor function (onset and offset of motor block):  
• Motor function (onset and offset of motor block) will be assessed by [CONTACT_40580]. This will be used to determine the onset and duration of motor 
blockade. The motor function test will be performed at predose (up to 15 min before 
block), 15 min (±5 min), 30 min (±5 min), 45 min (±5 min), 1 h (±15 min), 2 h

(±3 h) from end of block procedure, or until full motor function has returned to predose 
levels in two consecutive evaluations.  Additiona l unscheduled assessments may be 
performed, particularly around the  surgery, if no onset of block is noted on the last 
scheduled assessment prior to surgery.  
Onset of motor block  (sciatic)  will be defined as the earliest timepoint with partial or no 
foot m ovement.  
Offset of motor block  (sciatic) will be defined as resolution of the motor block with 
complete foot movement on two consecutive assessments. After offset of motor block is noted (on 2 consecutive assessments), no subsequent assessments will be co nducted.  
Duration of motor block  will be defined as time between onset and offset of motor block 
(see Appendix  3, Section  18.3).  
12.8. Pharmacodynamic Endpoints (Cohort 1 only)  
The following pharmacodynamics endpoints  will be determined :

(operative side up). Place ultrasound probe in the popliteal fossa, 3 to 5 cm above the 
popliteal crease in the transverse orientation . 
• Identify the sciatic nerve where it splits into the peroneal and tibial nerves but still 
enclosed in the connective tissue sheath (paraneural sheath) . 
B: Insertion of needle into paraneural sheath:  
Pacira Pharmaceuticals , Inc.       402-C-333 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  47 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 • Use a 100 mm, 21- gauge insulated needle  
• Needle approach is from the lateral side  
• The needle should be advanced in pla ne until the needle tip has pi[INVESTIGATOR_40540] (paraneural sheath), (i.e. , advance needle underneath the peroneal nerve, 
and pop through the sheath that surrounds the tibial and peroneal nerves) . 
C: Hydrodissection of sciatic nerve block:  
• Never advance the needle tip directly at either nerve, but rather use small aliquots of 
saline (1 -2 ml) to hydrodissect and outline the nerves . 
D: Study drug administration:  
• Switch syringes and i nject 20 mL of the study drug admixture in the sheath, between 
the two nerves . 
13.3.2. Procedures for Adductor Canal Nerve Block  
A: Placement of ultrasound probe:  
• With the patient in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], place ultr asound transducer at the midpoint 
between the inguinal crease and the superior pole of the patella. The femoral artery 
should be visible directly beneath the sartorius muscle.  
• The saphenous nerve is frequently visible as a hyperechoic structure immediately  
lateral to the femoral artery . 
B: Insertion of needle into adductor canal:  
• From a lateral approach in plane using a [ADDRESS_42275] lateral to the femoral artery and under the saphenous nerve . 
• The injection will occur immediately lateral to the femoral artery , below the sartorius 
muscle.  
C: Saline injection of adductor canal nerve block:  
• Slowly start the saline injection to visualize the saphenous nerve so as not to injure it. 
The goal is to confirm  needle tip position, and no more than 1- 2 mL of saline should 
be required.  
D: Study drug administration:  
• Switch syringes and s lowly start injecting the remaining [ADDRESS_42276]-Block Assessments 
The following assessments will be conducted in Cohort 1 subjects only:  
• Assess sensory and motor function (onset and offset of block)

CONFIDENTIAL  51 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 14.1. Adverse Events 
14.1.1. Definitions  
Definition of Adverse Event : Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, whether or  not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse 
experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about 
causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use in combination with another 
drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended change in a body structure or body function. Adverse events include any clinically significant deterioration of a subject’s medical status. The AE may involve any organ or system and can be represented by [CONTACT_40584] 
a disease, a syndrome, a symptom, a physi cal sign, as well as by [CONTACT_40585]. Any medically relevant and untoward change after 
the subject signs the ICF, including frequency or pattern changes for a fluctuating condition (e.g., 
migraine) is considered an AE.  
An AE that occurs after the ICF is signed and before the start of the study drug administration is 
identified as a pretreatment AE (PTAE). An AE that occurs after the administration of the study 
treatment is considered a treatment- emergent adverse event ( TEAE) .  
Definition of Adverse Reaction : Any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
Definition of Suspected Adverse R eaction : Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. Suspected adverse 
reactio ns are a subset of all AEs for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the 
event.  
14.1.2. Recording Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to document all AEs (i.e., PTAEs and TEAEs) with an onset after the subject signs the ICF.  For the purpose of this study, all AEs that occur through 
POD [ADDRESS_42284] be documented as medical diagnoses (highest possible level of integration); otherwise, the AEs must be reported separately as individual signs or symptoms. Only one AE per line should be recorded in the AE CRF; for example, an AE of 
nausea and vomiting would be listed as two separate events: the event of nausea and the event of vomiting. If a diagnosis is established after symptoms are recorded on the AE CRF, the diagnosis must be recorded, and the symptoms collapsed (removed; i.e., lined through and initialed). 
Whenever possible, abnormal laboratory results must be reported as their clinical corollary (e.g., 
low potassium should be recorded as hypokalemia).  
Pacira Pharmaceuticals , Inc.       402-C-333 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  [ADDRESS_42285] signs the ICF will be listed as Medical History and is 
considered a pre -existing condition. If a pre -existing condition changes (i.e., becomes more severe 
or more frequent) at any time after the ICF is signed, or after study drug administration, it is considered an AE. Note: A change in treatment for a pre -existing condition (e.g., new high blood 
pressure medication), does not necessarily indicate an AE.  
Information recorded on the AE CRF will include the AE term, the date and time of onset, severity, 
seriousness, relat ionship to study drug, action taken with subject due to AE, and the outcome of 
the AE, including the date and time of resolution, if applicable. 
14.1.3. Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of an AE must be categorized using the following guidelines:  
Mild :  An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activities.  
Moderate:  An AE that is discomforting and interferes with normal everyday activities.  
Severe:  An AE that prevents normal everyday ac tivities.  
The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); however, the event itself, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache ). This is not the same as "serious," which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations.  
14.1.4. Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The Investigator must assess the relationship of the AE to study drug after careful medical 
consideration on a case -by-case basis. General guidelines are provided below.  
Unrelated : A causal r elationship between the study drug and the AE can be easily ruled out 
(e.g., based on the temporal sequence, absence of a reasonable pathophysiological mechanism, or direct evidence of actual cause).  
Unlikely : A clinical event with a temporal relationship to study drug administration which 
makes a causal relationship improbable and in which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide a plausible explanation;  
Possible : A clinical event with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the study 
drug but which could also be explained by a concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals;  
Probable : A clinical event with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the study 
drug unlikely to be attributed to a concurrent disease or other drugs or c hemicals 
and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge);

EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  53 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 Definite : The pharmacological properties of the study drug(s) or of the substance class, and 
the course of the AE after dechallenge and, if applicable, after rechallenge, and/or 
specific test indicate involvement of the study drug(s) in the occurrence/worsening of the AE, and no indication of other causes exists.  
14.1.5. Outcome of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will assess the outcome of the AE after careful medical consider ation, on a case -
by-case basis. General guidelines are provided below:  
Recovered/Resolved:  The event resolved and the subject recovered from the AE  
Recovered/Resolved 
with Sequelae:  The initial event resolved but has a continuing abnormal condition as a result of the AE  
Not Recovered/ Not Resolved:  At the time of last assessment, the event was ongoing, with an undetermined outcome. Note: ongoing AEs are not to be 
considered resolve d as a result of death  
Recovering/Resolving:  At the time of last assessment, the event was decreasing in frequency, severity, etc., and a resolution was expected  
Fatal:  The AE directly caused death  
Unknown:  There was an inability to access the sub ject or the subject’s 
records to determine the outcome (e.g., subject withdrew consent or was lost to follow -up)  
 
14.1.6. Action Taken with Subject Due to an Adverse Event  
The Investigator will provide any actions taken regarding the subject (e.g., treatment, di agnostic 
tests, laboratory tests, or therapy) for each reported AE.  
• None  
• Medication  
• Non-pharmaceutical therapy (The specific therapy used must be recorded in the CRF )  
• Discontinued from study  
• Other (The specific action taken must be recorded)  
14.1.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Based on review of all peripheral nerve blocks, the following conditions will be considered to be 
adverse events of special interest upon review of the AEs:

 • Persistent tingling  
• Persistent numbness  
• Persistent weakness  
• Hypersensitivity  
• Seizures  
• Tremors  
• Dizziness  
• Hematoma formation  
• Cardiovascular depression  
• Dyspnea  
• Cardiovascular arrest  
• Altered sensorium  
• Visual disturbances  
• Local anesthetic systemic toxicity  
Investigators, study coordinators , and patient study as sessors will be trained on adverse event 
ascertainment in general, with a special focus directed to signs and symptoms that may represent 
evidence of systemic toxicity. All AEs of special interest will be managed per standard of care and 
should be reported to the medical monitor and recorded in the database.  
14.2. Serious Adverse Events  
14.2.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
Definition of a SAE: An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Pacira, it results in any of the following o utcomes:  
• Death
1 
• A life -threatening AE2 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]3 
• A persistent or significant incapacity4 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect5 
• Medically significant6 
1Death : Any event resulting in a subject’s death must be reported as an SAE. However, death, in 
and of itself, is not an AE; it is an outcome. The cause of death is the AE. Therefore, the Investigator must make every effort to obtain and document the cause of de ath for all subjects who 
Pacira Pharmaceuticals , Inc.       402-C-333 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  [ADDRESS_42286] be 
documented as an “unspecified fatal event.”  
2Life-threatening:  An AE is considered life -threatening if, in the view of either the In vestigator 
or Pacira, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death.  
3Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: It should be noted that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], in and of itself, does not represent an 
SAE. It is the AE leading to the subject’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40541] “serious” when it requires inpatient care. Consequently, an SAE must not be reported in case of preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22037] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen during the study. However, any medical condition 
that delays a subject’s discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (i.e., prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) or requires the 
subject to be readmitted must be reported as an SAE.  
4Persistent or significant incapacity:  A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
5Congenital anomaly/birth defect : Report if you suspect that exposure to a medical product prior 
to conception or during pregnancy may have resulted in an adverse outcome in t he child.  
6Medically significant:  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may requi re medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medically significant events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or con vulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
14.2.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
Any SAE or death that occurs at any time after the subject signs the ICF through P OD 14, whether 
or not related to EXPAREL, must be reported by [CONTACT_40586] 24 hours of discovery by [CONTACT_40587] ([EMAIL_780]) or fax (858- 408-3588). In 
addition, the Investigator or designee is encouraged to contact [CONTACT_40588], as needed.  
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event before 
notifying Pacira Drug Safety or designee of the SAE. The fax or email report must be followed by 
a full written summary using the SAE Form detailing relevant aspects of the SAE in question. Where applicable, information from relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40542] -identifying information redacted prior to forwarding to Pacira. In the  event of a 
fatal or life -threatening SAE, any required follow -up must be provided to Pacira Drug Safety or 
designee immediately. The Investigator will follow all SAEs until resolved or the condition stabilizes, and further follow -up is not warranted.  
If the Investigator is made aware of any SAEs after Postsurgical  Day 14, these must also be 
reported to Pacira Drug Safety or designee provided the SAE is considered related to EXPAREL. The site would then provide a completed SAE form within 1 business day and the event would be 
followed until resolution, or until adequate stabilization is met.

 15. STATISTICAL METHODS  
A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized  for this study  prior to database 
lock. Demographic and baseline characteristics wi ll be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_40589]. Efficacy and safety endpoint analyses will be 
described in the SAP.  
Efficacy data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_21964] . Superiority of treatment with 
EXPAREL compared with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40491] 
(ANOVA) with treatment as main effect for the primary efficacy endpoint of AUC of the NRS 
pain intensity scores from [ADDRESS_42287] the model if deemed necessary. Other efficacy endpoints will be 
analyzed using ANOVA, logistic regression model, chi -square tests, and Kaplan -Meier and log-
rank tests, as appropriate.  
Safety and pharmacokinet ic endpoints will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_40590] . 
15.1. Study Hypothesis  
The primary null hypothesis is:  
H0: The AUC of the NRS pain intensity scores from [ADDRESS_42288] -surgery are not different 
between the EXPAREL and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40543].  
The alternative hypothesis is:   
HA: The AUC of the NRS pain intensity scores from [ADDRESS_42289] -surgery  for the EXPAREL 
treatment group is less than that of the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40544].  
15.2. Study Endpoints  
The endpoints to be assessed in this study are listed in Section  12.2  (Efficacy Endpoints), 
Section  12.6  (PK Endpoints) and Section  12.4  (Safety Endpoints).  
15.3. Determination of Sample Size 
The sample size was calculated based on the primary efficacy endpoint of the AUC of the NRS 
pain intensity scores from [ADDRESS_42290] -surgery  comparing EXPAREL to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40482].  
The sample size for Cohort 1 was based on the number of subjects neces sary to characterize the 
PK following administration.  
Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 subjects will be combined within treatment groups  for the efficacy and 
safety analyses; therefore, the overall sample size was based on the primary efficacy endpoint of 
the AUC of the NRS pain intensity scores from [ADDRESS_42291] deviation (SD) of [ADDRESS_42292] 90% power to detect a  true 
difference  of 150- units in the AUCs . Therefore, since Cohort [ADDRESS_42293] 60 subjects

 (20 EXAPREL, 20 EXPAREL admixed with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40475] 20 bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]), Cohort 
2 will need to enroll 60 subjects (20 EXAPREL, 20 EXPAREL admixed with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40545] 20 bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]) to meet the total requirements.  
An efficacy interim analysis will occur when approximately [ADDRESS_42294] enrolled and provided complete data for the primary efficacy outcome.  
15.4. Analysis Populations 
The following analysis se ts are planned:  
Safety : The safety analysis set will include all subjects who receive study drug. All analyses will 
be based on actual treatment received.  
Efficacy : The efficacy analysis set will include all randomized subjects who undergo the planned 
surgery. All analyses will be based on randomized treatment regardless of actual treatment 
received.  
Pharmacokinetic : The pharmacokinetic analysis set will include all subjects who receive study 
drug and who provide sufficient samples to allow for calculation of PK parameters required for analysis.  
Pharmacodynamic:  The pharmacodynamics analysis set will include all subjects who receive study 
drug and who provide sufficient data to allow for calculation of PD parameters required for analysis.  
15.5. Handling Subject Dr opouts and Discontinuations  
Methods for dealing with missing data for other endpoints will be described in the SAP.  
15.6. Statistical Analyses  
15.6.1. Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
15.6.2. Study Procedur e Compliance  
In each analysis set, the percentage and number of subjects who were screened and the percentage 
and number of subjects who failed to complete the study, including reasons for discontinuation, 
will be displayed by [CONTACT_1570].  
15.6.3. Efficacy Ana lyses  
All efficacy analyses will be based on the efficacy analysis set and will be analyzed according to 
the randomized treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint will be additionally analyzed by 
[CONTACT_40591] a sensi tivity analysis.  
For continuous measures of efficacy, summary statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, and maximum) will be shown by [CONTACT_1570]. For categorical measures of efficacy, 
number and percentage of subjects in each category will be shown by [CONTACT_1570]. For time to

CONFIDENTIAL  [ADDRESS_42295] data listings.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy Measure 
The primary efficacy measure is the AUC of the NRS pain intensity scores from [ADDRESS_42296]. Additional 
covariates may be included. Based on the model, the difference between treatment groups will be 
estimated along with the 2- sided 95% confidence intervals. The stratified sensitivity analysis will 
report similar statistics.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Efficacy Measures  
The secondary efficacy measures  are: 
• Total postsurgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_40489] (OMED) from [ADDRESS_42297] -surgery comparing EXPAREL to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]  
• Time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_40546]  
• The AUC of the NRS pain intensity scores from [ADDRESS_42298] -surgery comparing 
EXPAREL to EXPA REL admixed with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39912]  
• The duration of the motor block EXPAREL to EXPAREL admixed with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40547], opi[INVESTIGATOR_40548]. All  opi[INVESTIGATOR_40549] [ADDRESS_42299] will be used. Additional covariates may be included. Based on the model, the difference between treatment groups will be estimated alo ng with the 2 -
sided 95% confidence intervals.  
The time to event endpoints will be summarized with medians and Kaplan- Meier estimates. A log -
rank test will be used to compare EXPAREL to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]. Subjects that do not report any event will be censored  at their last valid assessment respective to the endpoint.  
For the endpoint AUC of the NRS pain intensity scores from [ADDRESS_42300] -surgery , 
EXPAREL will be compared to EXPAREL admixed with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39912].  
For the endpoint duration of the motor block , EXPAREL will be compared to EXPAREL admixed 
with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39912] .

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated from the PK analysis set, using plasma drug 
concentration -time profiles, where appropriate, by [CONTACT_105]- compartmental analysis.  
Actual sampling time will be used for all calculations of the PK parameters. If there is any doubt 
in the actual time a sample was taken, then the scheduled time will be used.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the PK parameters.  
15.6.4. Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be based on actual treatment received.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
Adverse event verbatim terms will be mapped to preferred terms and related system organ class 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Events that start prior to the 
start of study drug administration will be identified in a by -subject listings. Incidence rates of 
TEAEs and the proportion of subject prematurely withdrawn from the study due to a TEAE will 
be shown for each tr eatment group. Incidence rates will also be displayed for each treatment group 
for TEAEs by [CONTACT_40592]. If severity of an AE is not reported, then for 
tables of AEs by [CONTACT_926], the event will be classified as ‘Severe’ and will  be footnoted for the 
table to indicate this imputation. If relationship to study drug is not reported for an AE, then for tables of study- drug related AEs, the event will be assigned the relationship of ‘definite’ . Incidence 
rates of SAEs will also be sho wn for each treatment group. All incidence rates will be categorized 
and displayed by [CONTACT_6657] . 
15.7. Significance Testing 
All tests will be two -sided and based on a significance level of 0.05 unless otherwise specified . 
15.8. Interim Anal yses 
An unblinded efficacy interim analysis conducted by [CONTACT_40593] 60 subjects (20 in each arm) have been randomized, treated and provided their primary efficacy outcome. An interim analysis will be conducted to evaluate and compare the 
clinical efficacy between EXAPREL only and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40550]. Primary purpose of this 
interim analysis is to evaluate the sample size assumptions and evaluate futility. Full details on the planned or additional inte rim analysis will be covered in a prospective interim analysis plan.

 18. APPENDICES  
18.1. Appendix 1: Pain Intensity Scores using the Numeric Rating Scale 
(NRS)  
Pain intensity will be measured using the 11- point NRS. The subject will be asked to rate their 
worst or average pain on a scale of 0 (no pain) - 10 (worst possible pain) . Subjects will be instructed 
to focus all NRS pain intensity ratings on the operative ankle/foot , and not other locations where 
they may be experiencing pain.  
• Pain intensity using the NRS measured as “What was your worst p ain in the last 30 days?” 
and “What was your average pain in the last 30 days?” will be assessed at Baseline/Day of 
surgery  
• Pain intensity using the NRS measured as “How much pain are you experiencing right 
now?” ** will be assessed : 
− Upon arrival in the PA CU (±5 min)  
− Every 15 minutes in the PACU  (±5 min)  
− At PACU discharge  (±5 min)  
− Every [ADDRESS_42303] -surgery: 6 h (±2 h), 12 h (±2 
h), 18 h (±2 h), 24 h (±2 h), 30 h (±2 h), 36 h (±2 h), 42 h (±2 h), 48 h (±2 h), 54 h (±2 h), 60 h (±2 h), 66 h (±2 h), 72 h (±2 h), 78 h (±3 h), 84 h (±3 h), 90 h (±3 h), and 96 h (±3 h)  
− If a subject is asleep, the subject will not be awakened to assess pain. If the subject awakens within the assessment window, a pain score will be collect ed then 
− Subjects will be instructed not to complete the NRS pain intensity score after any 
physical activity, including the motor block assessment. If that is not possible, to assess pain intensity at rest, the subject should rest quietly in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_40554] 5- 10 minutes before entering the 
pain score using the NRS . Subjects will also be required to provide unscheduled pain 
assessments prior to consumption of any breakthrough pain medicati on 
− An unscheduled NRS assessment will be obtained immediately prior to 
administration of any breakthrough pain medication until [ADDRESS_42304] -surgery  
• Pain intensity using the NRS measured as “What was your worst pain in the last  
24 hours?” and “What was y our average pain in the last 24 hours?”  will be assessed:  
− Once daily at 21:00 (± 3 h) from POD  1 to POD 14

 18.3. Appendix 3: Motor  Function Test (Cohort 1 only) 
Motor function (onset and offset of motor block) will be assessed by [CONTACT_40596] . 
This will be used to determine the duration of the motor blockade. 
• The motor function test will be performed at predose (up to 15 min before block), 
15 min (± 5 min), 30 min (±5 min), 45 min (±5 min), 1 h (±15 min), 2 h (±30 min), 8 h 
(±30 min), 12 h (±30 min), 24 h (±1 h), 30 h (±1 h), 48 h (±1 h), 60 h (±2 h), 72 h 
(±2 h), 84 h (±2 h), 96 h (±3 h), 120 h (±3 h), 144 h (±3 h), and 168 h (±3 h) from the 
end of t he block procedure s, or until full motor function has returned to the baseline 
(pre-block)  level in two consecutive evaluations.  Additional unscheduled assessments 
may be performed, particularly around the  surgery, if no onset of block is noted on the 
last scheduled assessment prior to surgery.  
Motor Function Test  
The motor function test procedures are as follows:  
• The subject will be supi[INVESTIGATOR_40555] .   
• The level of foot movement will be noted as  either : 
• partial or no foot movement  
• complete foot movement

 18.4. Appendix 4: Light Touch Assessment and Cold Sensation 
Assessment  (Cohort 1 only)  
Sensory function  for light touch  will be assessed using a  wooden tongue depressor . Sensory 
function for cold sensation wi ll be assessed  using ice. The light touch assessment will be done 
first, followed by [CONTACT_40579] .  
• The wooden tongue depressor light touch assessment and the cold sensation assessment  
will be performed at predose (up to 15 min before block), 15 min  (±5 min), 
30 min  (±5 min), 45 min  (±5 min), 1  h (±15  min), 2  h (±30 min), 8  h (±30  min), 
12 h (±30 min),  24 h (±1  h), 30 h (±1 h), 48 h (±1 h), 60 h (±2  h), 72 h (±2  h), 84 h (±2  h), 
96 h (±3 h), 120  h (±3 h), 144  h (±3 h), and 168  h (±3 h) from the end of the nerve block 
procedure s, or until full sensory function has returned to baseline (pre -block)  levels in two 
consecutive evaluations. Each light touch area of assessment  will be rated independently.  
Each cold sensation assessment wi ll be rated independently. Additional unscheduled 
assessments may be performed, particularly around the surgery , if no onset of block is 
noted on the last scheduled assessment prior to surgery. For each sensory assessment 
performed, all 4 locations below will be assessed for both light touch and cold (e.g., total 
of 8 independent ratings will be performed for each sensory assessment).  
Sensory function assessment will  include the following four locations:  
1. Saphenous proximal -  Medial aspect  of the lower  leg (3-4 cm below the  knee)   
2. Saphenous distal -  Medial aspect  of the lower leg  (3-4 cm above  ankle)  
3. Sciatic proximal - Lateral aspect of the lower leg  (3-4 cm above ankle)  
4. Sciatic distal -  Sole of the foot  
The intent of applying the tongue depressor or ice to the contralateral leg is to establish a reference 
sensation to compare to the test area. The subject is to determine if the sensation on the 
contralateral leg is the sa me as the test area (“Yes” = the same) or if there is a decreased sensation 
or not the same sensation (“NO” = not the same).  
Tongue D epressor Assessment  
The tongue depressor assessment procedures are as follows:  
• The subject should be instructed to close their eyes before the application of the wooden 
tongue depressor . 
• Instruct the subject you will be touching the subject on both legs and they will be 
asked if the touch sensation is the same (YES) or not the same (NO) when comparing 
each side.  
• For the subject’s reference, the end of the tongue depressor is dragged over the 
contralateral assessment area with consistent light touch.  
• The end of the tongue depressor is then dragged over the corresponding test assessment area with consistent light touch.

 • The subject will be asked if the touch sensation of the tongue depressor is  the same 
(YES) or not the same (NO) when compar ing each side .  
• Record the subject’s response (YES or NO) to the touch sensation in the assessment 
area.  
• Proceed to test the other three areas as above.  
Ice Assessment  
The ice assessment procedures are as follows:  
• The subject should be instructed to close their eyes before the application of the ice 
(place ice in a small plastic  bag to avoid any wet sensation) . 
• Instruct the subject you will be touching the subject on both legs and they will be asked 
if the cold sensatio n is the same (YES) or not the same (NO) when comparing each 
side. 
• For the subject’s reference, the ice is placed on the contralateral assessment area.  
• The ice is then placed  on the corresponding test assessment area.  
• The subject will be asked if the cold sensation  is the same (YES) or not the same (NO) 
when comparing each side .  
• Record the subject’s response (YES or NO) to the cold sensation in the assessment 
area.  
• Proceed to test the other three areas as above.

  Version Date: 01/26/24 PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
Title Transdermal Buprenorphine for the Treatment of Radiation- 
Induced Mucositis Pain in Head and Neck Cancer Patients: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_224844], MD (Study PI) 
Clinical Trial Phase Phase II  
Study Population Stage IIV by [CONTACT_123510] 8th edition head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, candidate for curative 
intent or adjuvant radiation therapy 
Primary Objectives To investigate the efficacy of using FDA-approved doses of 
transdermal (TD) buprenorphine in combination with oral tramadol to 
provide adequate pain control in radiation induced mucositis.  
Secondary Objectives 1. Assess compliance of the study drug regimen.  
2. Assess use of off-protocol pain medications during treatment 
and follow-up period. 
3. Compare average weekly pain scores calculated by [CONTACT_224936] (OM) pain app with the average pain scores recorded 
by [CONTACT_55817] [INVESTIGATOR_200643].  
4. Correlate average weekly pain scores with physical activity as 
documented on symptoms and functional assessment tools like 
MDASI-HN.  
5. Assess use of nonopi[INVESTIGATOR_224845] (i.e., 
laxatives, antiemetics and oral anesthetics) in conjunction with 
the study drug combination during treatment and follow-up 
period. 
6. Assess gastrointestinal and cognitive side effect profile of study 
drug combination and its impact on cognition and quality of life. 
7. Evaluate safety of the study drug combination. 
Primary Endpoint Establish efficacy of study regimen by [CONTACT_224937] 33% of 
patients will achieve at least 30 percent decrease in visual analog scale 
(VAS) pain score of BPI [INVESTIGATOR_224846] 
[ADDRESS_270465] dose of study drug 
combination.  
3. Correlate cumulative mean weekly pain scores calculated by 
[CONTACT_224938] [INVESTIGATOR_200643]. 
4. Correlate average weekly OM Pain App scores and average 
weekly pain scores calculated from BPI [INVESTIGATOR_224847]: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       5     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/24 Anderson Symptom Inventory - Head & Neck (MDASI-HN), 
which is a head and neck symptom and function evaluation tool.  
5. Maintain a weekly log of use of other nonopi[INVESTIGATOR_224848], such 
as laxatives, antiemetics, and oral anesthetics in conjunction 
with the study drug combination during treatment and follow-up 
period through weekly questionnaires.  
6. Assess incidence and severity of gastrointestinal and cognitive 
adverse events measured by [CONTACT_224939]® (GI and 
cognition) questionnaires to better characterize the side effect 
profile of the drug regimen and its impact on quality of life.  
7. Safety: Assess incidence and severity of adverse events 
associated with study drug combination, using the CTCAE 
version 5. 
Main Inclusion 
Criteria   
1. Age >18 years. 
2. Histologically confirmed malignancies of Head and Neck 
involving Stage I-IV by [CONTACT_123510] 8th edition (oral 
cavity, oropharynx, nasal or paranasal sinuses, hypopharynx 
and larynx etc.) including both squamous and non squamous 
cell histologys (salivary gland carcinomas and carcinomas of 
unknown primary will be included)  
3. Undergoing a course of either definitive radiation (dose of at 
least 50 Gy to the head and neck region) with or without 
chemotherapy or adjuvant radiation (at least 50 Gy to the head 
and neck region) with or without chemotherapy (patients with a 
history of prior definitive course of radiation will be allowed).  
4. ECOG Performance status  2. 
5. Concurrent enrollment on an interventional trial is allowed. 
6. English speaking and literate. 
7. Patients will be allowed to take radiotherapy mix, viscous 
lidocaine or magic mouthwash-like agents that do not contain 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Tylenol® allowed for fever. 
8. Adequate organ function:  Minor dose adjustments for tramadol 
are required in cases of severe liver and renal impairment so 
we would only include patients with adequate organ function 
outlined in table below. No dose adjustment for renal or hepatic 
impairment is required for TD buprenorphine. Some other 
parameters like hemoglobin, platelets, and WBC are required 
for administration of standard-of-care chemotherapy, such as  
cisplatin along with radiation in treatment of HNSCC. They are 
not required for administration of buprenorphine or tramadol.

1. Patients found to be eligible for the study can be screened and enrolled anytime during first six weeks of radiation therapy. VAS 
pain scores will be recorded weekly using BPI [INVESTIGATOR_224854], as 
outlined in study calendar. Treatment with study regimen, collection of PROMIS®, MDASI, CTCAE and other assessments like 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_224855], as outlined in the study calendar will start once the patient develops mucositis and has VAS 4/10 pain 
score on the OM Pain App and BPI [CONTACT_63496] (question 3: your pain at its worst in last 24 hours). Patients usually develop 
mucositis by [CONTACT_224941], 
but it may start sooner if the patient develops mucositis and has VAS  4/10 pain. If a patient presents with radiation-induced 
mucositis pain on the day of enrollment, then, all study procedures, including PROMIS®, MDASI-HN, and CTCAE will be 
completed that day. Visit procedures that were performed as standard of care prior to consent (without the specific intent to 
make the subject eligible for the trial), may count toward screening tests and eligibility if they are within the screening window 
of two days. Clinician follow-up will be scheduled weekly (17) and then on weeks [ADDRESS_270470] withdraws, then they will be followed as per follow-up requirements. 
3. Serum chemistry values will include ALT/SGPT, AST/SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin (total, direct, and indirect) 
creatinine, LDH, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, BUN/urea, albumin, glucose,. 
Serum chemistry results obtained from unscheduled visits should be entered into the electronic database. Additional serum

weekly clinic visits. This will commence after starting treatment. a) Patients will document pain and supportive medication use 
data daily in their diariesbut that information will be verified and recorded by [CONTACT_1697]/research coordinator during weekly 
clinic visits in the electronic medical record(EMR). This data is currently being collected in a section of pain app. Patients 
average weekly VAS pain scores (question 3 of BPI [CONTACT_63496]) will also be documented in EMR during weekly clinic visits 
as per standard of care and can be used for study purposes.  
5. The Oral Mucositis (OM) Pain App will be evaluated by [CONTACT_64839] a daily basis through a real-time pain assessment 
tool in the mobile app. Patients can start using the OM Pain App before starting therapy to familiarize themselves with the 
instrument. b) Pain app readings will be recorded up to four times/day. The daily pain data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_224942] a weekly basis.  
6. All questionnaires/forms can be recorded on weekly in-person visi ts from weeks 17 then completed weekly through in-person/ 
telephone interviews by [CONTACT_224943] 812. Other assessments can also be done over phone during week 8, 10 and 
11. Window period of +/-3 days will be allowed for data collection. 
7. EKG will be done at screening and then on week 7 and 12 if the patient is on treatment with Buprenorphine patch.  
8. Digital photos will be taken to document mucositis on the day of enrollment, treatment initiation, then during week 9 and week 12 clinic visits.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the eighth most common cancer in the 
[LOCATION_002] with more than 53,600 new cases diagnosed annually.(1) Early-stage or locally 
advanced head and neck cancer patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_224863] a multimodality approach 
including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Mucositis-related pain and dysphagia are two of 
the most common primary toxicities associated with head and neck radiation. Around 80100% 
of head and neck cancer patients being treated with radiation therapy suffer from oral mucositis 
pain. Severe mucositis (WHO grades 3 and 4) occurs in 25% of patients when standard 
fractionated radiation (once-daily dose) is used as a single modality. The incidence of severe 
mucositis can be as high as 50%75% when radiation is used in conjunction with concurrent 
radio-sensitizing chemotherapy. (2, 3)

week of therapy, or after approximately 30 Gy of radiation has been delivered. It may develop 
earlier when concomitant chemotherapy is being given or if an altered fractionation schedule is 
used.(4) The vast majority of patients require treatment with strong pain relief medications like 
morphine, fentanyl, and oxycodone as they experience moderate -to-severe mucositis-related 
pain. Exposure to strong opi[INVESTIGATOR_224864]-term opi[INVESTIGATOR_224865].(5, 6) Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve patients are apprehensive about using this 
class of drugs because of fear of habit-forming properties and drug-related side effects. As a 
result, this causes reduced pain medication compliance and may also contribute to poor pain 
control.(7, 8) 
 
1.[ADDRESS_270482] profile and lower 
habit-forming potential compared to other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].(9, 10) It is a derivative of the thebaine, which 
has mixed opi[INVESTIGATOR_224866] (agonistic effect on µ opi[INVESTIGATOR_224867] L1 receptors but the 
antagonistic effect on kappa and delta opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328]).(11) Transdermal buprenorphine, with its 
active polymeric matrix, is superior to some of the other long-acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_224868]. Unlike other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], it has a ceiling effect, which means its effects 
increase until the person takes a certain amount; then, these effects level off, which limits 
euphoria, confusion, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341].(12)  Earlier studies have shown that 
buprenorphine suppresses opi[INVESTIGATOR_224869], and reduces illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].(13) 
Furthermore, it can safely be administered with no dose adjustments in patients suffering from 
chronic kidney disease or those who develop chemotherapy-related acute renal failure. This 
unique characteristic of buprenorphine makes it a good option for mucositis-related pain control 
in HNSCC patients being treated with commonly used cisplatin-based chemotherapy, which is 
often associated with acute kidney injury.(14) With appropriate education, patients may perceive 
buprenorphine to be less addictive than other opi[INVESTIGATOR_224870]. As a 
result, this may contribute to better pain control and compliance during treatment. Tramadol is a 
short-acting, weak opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], which works by [CONTACT_224944][INVESTIGATOR_224871]: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       18     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/24 synergistic activity with other long-acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].(15) It is associated with lower incidence of 
cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_224872].  
It can be used to treat breakthrough pain in combination with long-acting TD buprenorphine. 
Furthermore, it has been safely used in combination with both fentanyl and buprenorphine 
patches in earlier studies to alleviate cancer related pain.(9, 16) European studies have shown 
that buprenorphine patches used at higher doses (>35 µg/hour) in combination with Tylenol® or 
tramadol for breakthrough pain can provide adequate analgesia in cancer patients and is 
associated with fewer adverse effects compared to other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].(9) However, there is a paucity 
of similar studies with FDA-approved doses (5 µg to 20 µg/hour) of buprenorphine patches in the 
[LOCATION_002]. In fact, to our knowledge, there are no active or completed studies of FDA- 
approved doses of buprenorphine in the treatment of mucositis in head and neck cancer. The 
goal of this study is to show efficacy of using FDA-approved doses of buprenorphine patches with 
oral tramadol in providing adequate pain relief in patients suffering from moderate to severe 
radiation-induced mucositis pain. This is an innovative and timely study question as several head 
and neck cancer patients continue to suffer from opi[INVESTIGATOR_224873]-related toxicities.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_270483] utilized a combination of transdermal buprenorphine and oral tramadol for 
cancer-related pain.(17-19). In a study by [CONTACT_224945]., a group of 52 cancer patients with chronic 
pain were randomized 1:1 between two groups. Twenty-six patients were treated with a titratable 
dose of TD buprenorphine (35 µg/hour) with oral tramadol (200 mg/day) for breakthrough pain 
and 26 patients were treated with 60 mg/day of oral morphine. Final analysis of this study revealed 
that buprenorphine-based regimen was more effective in providing pain relief and was better 
tolerated than oral morphine. The incidence and severity of side effects were significantly lower 
in the buprenorphine arm compared to the morphine arm. Overall, common side effects reported 
in the buprenorphine arm of 26 patients were vertigo (12%), drowsiness (12%), headache (12%), 
constipation (8%), confusion (4%), and nausea (12%). No serious adverse event was 
observed.(9) In another 40-patient study of cancer patients, oral tramadol was safely used in 
combination with TD buprenorphine. Side effects, including nausea, buprenorphine patch 
insertion site pruritus and erythema, constipation, and headache were observed but were for the 
most part self-limiting.(18) Overall, there is some evidence in the literature to prove the safety of 
buprenorphine and tramadol drug combination regimen in cancer patients. However, there are no 
large randomized trials with this combination. Details on the dose justification of the study drug 
regimen are included in Section 5.2.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_270484] used and validated the MD Anderson Symptom 
Inventory (MDASI). This tool can be used in clinical and research settings. The Visual Analog 
Scale (010) measures symptom severity and interference with daily activities.(20-22) The 13-
core MDASI symptom items are based on an extensive evaluation related to cancer and cancer-

  Version Date: 01/26/[ADDRESS_270485] patients in completing it in the clinic or by 
[CONTACT_224946]. 
The instrument was developed in a manner that allows individuals to add items relevant to specific 
cancers and cancer treatments to patient-completed modules. The head and neck module 
(MDASI-HN) (21) was created with focus group input. These groups comprised head and neck 
cancer patients; surgical, medical, dental, and radiation oncology specialists; and symptom 
researchers. This instrument includes [ADDRESS_270486] 
five that do not appear in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Patients with Head 
and Neck Cancer (FACT-HN)  another commonly used quality of life tool. The coefficient alpha, 
a measure primarily used as a means of describing the reliability of multiitem scales, is highly 
reliable with the MDASI-HN. It  was validated in a cohort of more than 200 patients in multiple 
studies.(3, 23)  It  was validated in several languages. In our trial, we plan to use the   MDASI-HN 
tool to study the impact of radiation-induced mucositis pain on head- and neck-related symptoms 
and physical activity. 
1.5.2 Brief Pain Inventory  
The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) asks patients to rate their pain for the last week on a 0 to 10 scale 
at its worst, least, average and now.  The scales are presented on a 10-cm line with each 
number equidistant from the next. Each scale is bounded by [CONTACT_85900] no pain at the 0 end and 
pain as bad as you can imagine at the other. Patients are also asked to rate how pain interferes 
with several quality of life domains, including activity, walking, mood, sleep, work and relations 
with others. These scales are bounded by does not interfere at the 0 end and interferes 
completely at the other. Patients also are asked to estimate pain relief related to their pain 
treatment (by [CONTACT_150780]), to locate areas of pain on a human figure and to estimate pain cause 
(cancer disease, cancer treatment, or non-cancer). The patient can complete the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_224874], and the assessment is available in [ADDRESS_270487] been examined in detail.(24) In clinical trials where pain 
reduction (or prevention) represents primary or secondary outcome measures, professionals 
frequently use the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_224875]. As a pain assessment 
tool, it is the FDA standard. The typi[INVESTIGATOR_224876] worst pain in most cancer 
populations is 2.4. Therefore, the finding of a one-point difference in the worst pain item at 
different times or between two comparative groups is considered significant. We plan to use the 
Brief Pain Inventory to assess and quantify radiation-induced mucositis pain. 
1.5.3 MDASI and BPI [INVESTIGATOR_224877]-mentioned pain assessment tools measure oral mucositis pain, they only provide 
pain severity snapshots. In a head and neck cancer clinical trial, mucositis pain questionnaires 
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_224878]. Other pain assessment tools require the 
patient to rate pain by [CONTACT_224947], thereby [CONTACT_2359] a variable prone to 
inaccuracy.(22) Patients with severe oral mucositis experience unrelenting pain. It is often 
characterized by [CONTACT_224948], eating, 
talking, and with waning analgesic medication effects. The limitation of most pain assessment 
tools in failing to capture fluctuating pain is well recognized. Momentary self-reporting of chronic 
pain with an electronic diary has been shown to overcome this limitation without undue burden. 
Study Short Title: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       20     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/24 Pain questionnaires also fail to capture patterns of pain unique to the head and neck cancer  
population, such as pain related to the timing of radiation (early in the week versus later in the 
week versus weekend). Pain, occurring at night and interfering with sleep, is likewise not 
accounted for in typi[INVESTIGATOR_224879]. 
The difficulty of measuring radiation-induced oral mucositis pain under optimal conditions of a 
clinical trial is put into perspective by [CONTACT_224949]-research setting oncologists do 
not routinely use any assessment tools for measuring mucositis pain. This may be in part due to 
the shortcomings of the available tools described above. More likely, however, it is due to logistical 
restrictions  the availability of trained personnel to administer surveys, time constraints of the 
doctors office schedules and the difficulty of documenting paper surveys and integrating them 
into the electronic medical record. Instead, most commonly, patients simply are asked to verbally 
report an assessment of their pain, such as worst pain level or average level of pain. The head 
and neck cancer patient population is predisposed to specific problems that further limit the ability 
to assess pain, such as the ability to articulate and accurately describe pain, language and 
physical communication barriers, cultural influences, as well as fear of the appearance of drug-
seeking or difficult behavior. 
To address the difficulty of accurately monitoring patients mucositis pain, we developed a new 
method for assessing radiation-induced oral mucositis pain by [CONTACT_224950].  
1.5.4  Oral Mucositis (OM) Pain App   
Under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_224880] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), we are planning to use the OM Pain App in our study. 
The OM Pain App is a smartphone application that was designed to permit patients to key in pain 
severity, using a visual analog 010 scale (VAS) . The app is programed with an alarm to prompt 
the patient to record pain severity at prescribed intervals daily and through spontaneous patient 
input. Deidentified data collected on each patients smartphone will be backed up wirelessly to 
cloud storage where the data can be analyzed remotely or viewed on the device. The software 
can generate a time-weighted measure of pain, total area under the pain curve (AUC), a summary 
measure that integrates serial assessments of a patients pain over the duration of the study. The 
OM Pain App may be a significant improvement over the current standard of care, which is 
essentially nonexistent. The validated OM Pain App has the potential to significantly improve the 
management of pain in head and neck cancer patients. As noted, at the  Medical College of 
Wisconsin, we developed an oral mucositis pain app (OM Pain App) and implemented a clinical 
trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) to accurately assess pain requirements of head and neck cancer patients 
undergoing radiation. Preliminary data from [ADDRESS_270488] the quality of life of patients. A study 
by [CONTACT_224945]. showed that buprenorphine is associated with lesser gastrointestinal side effects 
compared to other conventional opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].(9) However, to our knowledge the gastrointestinal and 
Study Short Title: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       21     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/[ADDRESS_270489] profile of transdermal buprenorphine has not been studied extensively in 
patients being treated for mucositis pain in head and neck cancer patients. We plan to use a 
highly intuitive patient-reported outcome measurement information system tool called PROMIS® 
to assess the side effect profile of the study drug regimen. All scales of PROMIS® have been 
validated in cancer patients. PROMIS® is a set of person-centered outcome measures that 
evaluates and monitors physical, mental, and social health in adults and children. It is very 
sensitive, easy to use and available in multiple languages. Patients can also take assessments 
at home or through paper forms in clinic. Thus, there is less disruption to clinic flow with this 
methodology. We plan to use PROMIS® questionnaires to evaluate cognitive and gastrointestinal 
side effect profiles of the drug regimen and collect data to make appropriate and timely symptom-
related interventions. Both PROMIS® GI and PROMIS® Cognition scores have been validated in 
multiple studies. (25, 26). We plan to use PROMIS® scores to evaluate the gastrointestinal and 
cognitive side effects of the study regimen and its impact on the quality of life of patients. 
2. HYPOTHESIS, OBJECTIVES, AND ENDPOINTS 
We hypothesize that the use of long-acting transdermal buprenorphine (FDA-approved dose from 
5 mcg to 20 mcg/week) in conjunction with oral tramadol (50 mg to 400 mg/day) as needed for 
breakthrough pain will lead to a significant reduction in mucositis-related pain in locally advanced 
head and neck cancer patients being treated with radiation therapy by [CONTACT_224951]-up period of nine weeks.  
2.1 Primary Objectives  
To investigate the efficacy of using FDA-approved doses of TD buprenorphine in combination 
with oral tramadol to provide adequate pain control in radiation-induced mucositis.  
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives 
1. Assess compliance of the study drug regimen.  
2. Assess use of off-protocol pain medications during treatment and follow-up period. 
3. Compare the average weekly pain scores calculated by [CONTACT_224952] [INVESTIGATOR_200643].  
4. Correlate average weekly pain scores with physical activity as documented on symptom 
and functional assessment tools, such as the MDASI-HN.  
5. Assess the use of nonopi[INVESTIGATOR_224845] (i.e., laxatives, antiemetics, and 
oral anesthetics) in conjunction with the study drug combination during treatment and 
follow-up period. 
6. Assess gastrointestinal and cognitive side effect profiles of the study drug combination 
and their impact on cognition and quality of life. 
7. Evaluate safety of the study drug combination. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_270490] 33% of the patients will 
achieve at least a 30 percent decrease in the VAS pain score on the BPI [CONTACT_63496] 
(question 3: worst pain in last 24 hours) from baseline to the end of week [ADDRESS_270491] shown that the VAS pain score( 4/10) on the day of 
Study Short Title: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       22     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/24 treatment initiation may be used as the baseline in this setting and a 30% or higher reduction in 
the baseline pain score is a sign of a meaningful drug response.(27-29)   
2.5 Secondary Endpoint(s) 
1. Monitor compliance of the study drug regimen through the OM Pain App and medication 
diary. 
2. Identify study participants who require off-protocol opi[INVESTIGATOR_224881].  
3. Correlate the cumulative mean weekly pain scores calculated by [CONTACT_224953] [INVESTIGATOR_200643].  
4. Correlate the average weekly OM Pain App scores and average weekly pain scores 
calculated from BPI [INVESTIGATOR_224882]-HN. The cumulative average area under the curve (AUC) weekly pain scores are 
expected to be inversely proportion to MDASI-HN average weekly AUC physical activity 
scores.  
5. Maintain a weekly log of the use of other nonopi[INVESTIGATOR_224848], such as laxatives, 
antiemetics, and oral anesthetics in conjunction with the study drug combination during 
the treatment and follow-up period through weekly questionnaires. The average weekly 
use of laxatives and antiemetics is expected to decrease by [CONTACT_1008]-up 
period.  
6. Assess the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal and cognitive side effects of the study 
drug regimen and their impact on the quality of life as measured by [CONTACT_224939]® (GI 
and cognition) questionnaires. 
7. Safety: Assess incidence and severity of other adverse events associated with study drug 
combination, using the CTCAE version 5. 
 
2.6 Rationale for Outcome Measures Selection 
A. Primary objectives:  We plan to use the average daily and weekly pain scores determined 
by [CONTACT_224954] [INVESTIGATOR_224883]. Cancer and cancer therapy-
related pain estimates vary widely and there is a lack of standardization of pain 
assessment tools in this area. Studies have shown that real-time assessment of patient-
reported pain outcomes improves provider awareness and leads to better management of 
pain. Further, real-time assessment is very important for the head and neck cancer patient 
population as these patients are predisposed to specific problems, such as  difficulty in 
articulating and accurately describing pain due to severe mucositis. These issues can be 
resolved with real-time assessment of pain by a smartphone-based application. To our 
knowledge, app-based pain assessment of buprenorphine has never been studied on 
head and neck cancer patients suffering from radiation-induced mucositis pain. Our goal 
will be to use the VAS-based pain assessment tools on the OM Pain App and BPI [INVESTIGATOR_224884].  
Painful mucositis usually manifests by [CONTACT_224955]. Therefore, we decided to 
follow patients up to 12 weeks after they begin radiation therapy.(4, 17, 30) Mild-intensity 
mucositis pain can be effectively managed with low-potency pain medications like 
Tylenol®, NSAIDS, and oral lidocaine. Thus, we plan to initiate treatment with the tramadol 
Study Short Title: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       23     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/24 and buprenorphine combination once the patient develops mucositis and a VAS pain 
score   4/10.  Earlier pain management studies in radiation-induced mucositis have 
acknowledged that the pain curve follows a nonlinear pattern during radiation therapy and 
starts to peak by [CONTACT_224956]. It then plateaus and later 
drops to a lower level after initiation of long-acting effective pain medications, such as 
fentanyl or oxycodone. Hence, it is reasonable to use the pain score on the day of 
treatment initiation as our baseline pain score. (27, 29, 31) 
B. Secondary Objectives:  Adherence to the prescribed dose and frequency of pain 
medications is vital to symptom management of radiation-induced mucositis pain. Poor 
adherence is often associated with worse symptom control and inaccurate assessment of 
the potency of pain medications. Greater clinical support and research are needed to 
overcome the challenges of fragmentation in care from clinic to home, with specific 
attention to adherence and symptom management. We plan to use our pain app to make 
accurate and real-time assessments of compliance and efficacy of the pain regimen. We 
will also assess the use of off-protocol pain medications during study period.  
We plan to study the impact of radiation-induced mucositis pain on head- and neck-related 
symptoms and physical activity. This data will be further characterized and evaluated by 
[CONTACT_224957]-HN symptom and function tool. Use of other medication like laxatives and 
antiemetics in conjunction with the study drug combination during treatment can be used 
as surrogate markers of gastrointestinal side effects associated with the drug regimen. 
We plan to record these values on a weekly basis and expect its use to decrease by [CONTACT_224958]-up period. To study the gastrointestinal and cognitive side effect profile of 
transdermal buprenorphine and tramadol regimen, we plan to use a highly intuitive patient-
reported outcome measurement information system tool called PROMIS®. All PROMIS® 
scales have been validated in cancer patients. We plan to use PROMIS® questionnaires 
to evaluate the cognitive and gastrointestinal side effect profile of the drug regimen and 
its impact on quality of life of patients. Incidence and severity of adverse events associated 
with the study drug regimen, such as constipation, sedation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], and 
others will also be evaluated, using the CTCAE version 5. We will collect this data to make 
appropriate and timely symptom-related interventions. 
[ADDRESS_270492] the clinical usefulness of the 
smartphone pain app in recording and reporting radiation-induced mucositis pain. Additionally, it 
will also evaluate the role of symptom and function assessment tools, such as MDASI-HN and 
PROMIS® in identifying adverse effects related to the study regimen in the setting of 
chemoradiation therapy.   
3.2 Study Procedures  
Study Short Title: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       24     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/[ADDRESS_270493] 
six weeks of radiation therapy. VAS pain scores will be recorded weekly using the BPI 
[CONTACT_50205]. They will also be recorded daily, using the pain app from the day of enrollment 
as outlined in study calendar. Treatment with the study regimen, collection of data from the 
PROMIS®, MDASI, CTCAE evaluation, and other assessments, such as the opi[INVESTIGATOR_224885] >4/10 pain 
score on the OM Pain App and the BPI [CONTACT_63496] (question 3: your pain at its worst in last 
24 hours). Patients usually develop mucositis by [CONTACT_224959], but it can start sooner if 
the patient develops mucositis and has VAS4/10 pain. If a patient presents with radiation-
induced mucositis pain on the day of enrollment, then, all study procedures, including 
administering the PROMIS® and MDASI-HN questionnaires, in addition to CTCAE evaluation, 
will be completed on that day. Visit procedures that were performed as standard of care prior to 
consent (without the specific intent to make the subject eligible for the trial), may count toward 
screening tests and eligibility if they are within the screening window of two days. Clinician 
follow-up will be scheduled weekly (weeks 17) and then on weeks 9 and 12. Data can also be 
collected over phone during the follow-up period (weeks 812 from the start of radiation 
therapy). If a subject stops radiation therapy within the first 7 weeks, weekly visits will continue 
as scheduled if he/she is on treatment.   
3.[ADDRESS_270494] participation, 
found here: 
https://www.mcw.edu/HRPP/Policies-Procedures.htm  4.[ADDRESS_270495] statuses throughout the trial are defined as follows:   
 Prescreening: preconsent (subject considering trial or study staff considering a patient 
for the trial per institutional recruitment methods). 
 Screening: the period after the consent, but prior to eligibility confirmation. 
 Consented: consented, prior to eligibility confirmation. 
 Eligible: the local investigator confirms all eligibility criteria apply. 
 On study/enrolled: date eligibility is confirmed. 
 On arm: date of enrollment. 
 On treatment: first-day treatment with study drug regimen while undergoing radiation   
 Off treatment: last day of treatment with study drug regimen  
 On follow-up: from the last day of treatment to the end of the follow-up period. 
 Off study: follow-up period completed, with no additional data gathered.

A written signed informed consent form (ICF) and a Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization must be obtained before any study-specific 
assessments are initiated. A signed ICF copy will be given to the subject and a copy will be filed 
in the medical record (per local IRB policies and SOPs). The original will be kept on file with the 
study records.

drug regimen will commence once the patient develops mucositis and has a VAS pain score 
4/10 on the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_224886]. Additional data from PROMIS®, MDASI-HN, opi[INVESTIGATOR_224887], CTCAE evaluation, calorie requirements, the need for IV hydration, and 
other assessments will also be recorded as per study calendar.  
 
Based on earlier studies and our clinical practice, we anticipate that most patients will develop 
moderate intensity pain and require an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-based pain regimen by [CONTACT_224960].(4, 30) As we will be using the pain score on the day of treatment initiation and 
not the date of enrollment as our baseline, we dont expect that timing of initiation of drug 
regimen would have a significant impact on our results.

5 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Study Intervention  
 
The main objective of this study is to provide preliminary evidence that the FDA-approved dose 
of transdermal buprenorphine in conjunction with oral tramadol can provide adequate analgesia 
of radiation-induced mucositis pain during treatment and the follow-up period in head and neck 
Study Short Title: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       35     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/[ADDRESS_270515] defined adequate analgesia as VAS  3/10 for 72 hours. 
Inadequate analgesia is defined as VAS>3/10 for 72 hours and unbearable pain as VAS>3/10 
for 96 hours based on some prior studies and titratability requirements of a TD buprenorphine 
dose. (16, 17). Patients found to be eligible for the study can be screened and enrolled anytime 
during first six weeks of radiation therapy. Pain app data monitoring, BPI, base line labs, and 
medical history as outlined in study calendar will be collected on the day of enrollment. 
Treatment with study regimen, collection of PROMIS®, MDASI, and other assessment data, as 
outlined in the study calendar will start once the patient develops mucositis and has a VAS 
4/10 pain score on the OM Pain App and BPI [CONTACT_63496] (question 3: your pain at its worst 
in last 24 hours). Patients usually develop mucositis by [CONTACT_224966]. 
Therefore, we anticipate treatment would begin by [CONTACT_224967], but it can 
start sooner if the patient develops mucositis and has VAS 4/10 pain. If a patient presents with 
radiation-induced mucositis pain on the day of enrollment, then all study procedures, including 
administration of the PROMIS® and MDASI will be completed that day. 
 
The OM Pain App will be installed on their smartphone. Subjects who do not have a smartphone 
will be provided with a wifi-enabled device with a pre-installed OM Pain App. Treatment with the 
study regimen will commence once at least grade 1 radiation-related mucositis is observed and 
mucositis-related pain measured by [CONTACT_224968] (VAS) on BPI [CONTACT_63496]  
(4/10) anytime during radiation therapy. Pain scores will be evaluated according to the visual 
analog scale (VAS), with [ADDRESS_270516] pain, 13 indicating mild 
pain, 4[ADDRESS_270517] used Tylenol®, NSAIDS, and viscous lidocaine 
to manage mild pain and initiated long-acting pain medications like buprenorphine and fentanyl 
patch to treat moderate to severe pain. For the study purposes, we decided to start the 
treatment regimen once radiation mucositis pain  4/10 VAS pain score on the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_224899]. The study drug combination, including transdermal buprenorphine 5 mcg to 20 mcg/week 
with oral tramadol 50 mg to 400 mg/day as needed for breakthrough pain (details in Table 2),  
will be provided to the study population. Drug will be dispensed by [CONTACT_224969][INVESTIGATOR_224900]. Radiation-induced mucositis begins to heal approximately 
two weeks after the last dose of stomatotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy.(30, 32) We 
will assess a percentage decrease in pain score by [CONTACT_199487] [ADDRESS_270518] moderate to severe mucositis pain until 12 weeks of the follow-up period. 
Thus, we decided to monitor these patients for 12 weeks in our study.(32) Moreover, it would be 
easier to focus on the side effect profile of the study drug combination after completion of 
radiation therapy, as both chemotherapy and radiation may confound adverse event 
assessment of study drug regimen.  
 
We will quantify and evaluate mucositis-related pain through the serial VAS-based pain app and 
BPI [INVESTIGATOR_224901] a 12-week period (including first seven weeks of radiation and five weeks 
of the follow-up period). Real-time pain assessments will be done through the OM Pain App. The 
pain app will record pain readings up to four times daily. Pain scores will also be recorded through 
BPI [INVESTIGATOR_224902]. The clinical research coordinator or investigator will also record 
symptom severity and functional assessments through the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory- 
Head and Neck (MDASI-HN) questionnaires. PROMIS® gastrointestinal and cognitive 
questionnaires will be used to evaluate gastrointestinal and cognitive side effects of the study 
regimen. These assessments will be completed during weekly clinic visits as per study calendar. 
Study Short Title: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       36     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/24 Study assessments can also be completed virtually through a video/telephone visit during the 
post-treatment follow-up period (weeks 812). Dose titration of pain medications as per study 
protocol will be made over the telephone by [CONTACT_224970]-investigators. Patients will leave 
a MyChart message on EPIC (electronic medical record) if their pain remains uncontrolled on the 
prescribed dose of pain medications. These changes will be documented as a telephone 
encounter in the patients EMR.  
We expect  that adequate pain control will be achieved with a titratable dose of the (buprenorphine 
and tramadol) study regimen throughout the treatment and follow-up period of 12 weeks, using 
the above-mentioned pain assessment tools. We are planning to use a smartphone application 
(oral mucositis pain app) designed to permit patients to key in pain severity, using a visual analog 
010 scale in a real-time setting. Deidentified data collected on each patients smartphone will be 
backed up wirelessly to secure cloud storage where the data can be analyzed remotely. The 
software can generate a time-weighted measure of pain, total area under the pain curve (AUC). 
It also monitors drug compliance and use of rescue pain medications. Head and neck cancer 
patients being treated with radiation with or without chemotherapy endure maximum radiation-
related toxicities during first seven weeks of treatment. During this period, the pain curve often 
follows an unpredictable nonlinear pattern; hence, it is difficult to predict peaks and troughs of the 
pain curve of an individual during radiation. We will study the radiation-induced mucositis pain 
curve patterns during the therapy and follow-up period. We hypothesize that at least 33% of 
patients being treated with the drug regimen will have a 30% decrease from the highest baseline 
mean weekly AUC pain score by [CONTACT_224971] 9. Earlier studies have shown that a 30% drop in 
mean AUC pain score from baseline value was significant and suggestive of drug efficacy.(28, 
33). 
As noted earlier, radiation-induced mucositis begins to heal approximately two weeks after the last dose of stomatotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy.(30, 32) Hence, we will assess a 
percentage drop in pain score by [CONTACT_199487] [ADDRESS_270519] also shown that painful mucositis continues four to five weeks after the termination of 
radiation therapy. Thus, we plan to continue the study drug regimen up to 12 weeks. (17) (32) 
Recording of data will cease after [ADDRESS_270520] titratable doses of the drug regimen and plan to monitor the use off-
protocol pain oxycodone in our study.(17, 34) 
Details for the use and logistics of the OM Pain App, as well as the measure of the patients 
compliance to the use of the pain app are detailed below. This study will not interfere with or 
cause adjustments to the standard-of-care treatments each patient will receive as determined by 
[CONTACT_224972]. To this end, basic treatment descriptions and 
standards are briefly described as a reference to ensure proper patient selection and to verify that 
patients observed on the trial will be somewhat homogeneous from a treatment perspective. A 
short description of possible supportive treatments that could be needed during treatment is also 
included. All study interventions and treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis. 
Study Short Title: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       37     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/[ADDRESS_270521] reported that it lies somewhere between 75:1 to 100:1.(34) 
This makes finding the appropriate morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) for buprenorphine in 
controlling mucositis-related pain a challenging task. For our study, we used 75:1 equipotency 
ratio to calculate our morphine equivalent daily dose ( Table 1 ). As transdermal buprenorphine is 
a long-acting medication, we plan to allow tramadol 50 mg (total daily dose) as needed for 
breakthrough pain up to 400 mg/day (total daily dose), which roughly translates to [ADDRESS_270522]-of-care opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. There is no clear consensus 
definition of adequate and inadequate pain relief in this setting. However, it is well known that a 
VAS pain score of  3/[ADDRESS_270523] defined  adequate 
analgesia as VAS  3/10 for 72 hours, inadequate analgesia as VAS>3/10 for 72 hours,  and 
unbearable pain as VAS>3/10 for 96 hours.(16, 17) If patients have unbearable pain (VAS > 3/10 
x 96 hours) despi[INVESTIGATOR_224903], then,  we 
will switch from tramadol to oxycodone for breakthrough pain and continue treatment with 
buprenorphine. We will titrate this combination as needed for pain control until study completion.  
Some authors have also shown the benefit and safety of using immediate-release oxycodone in 
conjunction with transdermal buprenorphine for moderate to severe pain.(35)  If the pain is still 
uncontrolled >3/10 for 72 hours, even after using oxycodone 90 mg/day with buprenorphine 20 
g/hour, then, the patient will be taken off the study regimen. However, data monitoring will 
continue. Patients suffering intolerable side effects (severe constipation, vomiting, headache, 
pruritis, sedation, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], etc.) or those who wish to switch to standard-of-care 
oxycodone due to ineffective pain control or unclear reasons at any time during the study will be 
taken off study regimen. However, data monitoring through the pain app and questionnaires will 
continue. The dose titration schedule is illustrated in Table 2 .

Start TD buprenorphine 5 g/hour along with oral tramadol 50 mg to 150 mg (total dose over 24 
hours) as needed for breakthrough pain when mucositis related pain is 4/10 on VAS 
measured on OM Pain App and BPI. Further dose adjustments will be made through pain app. 
 If VAS is >3/10 for 72 hours on tramadol 150 mg (total dose over 24 hours) and 
buprenorphine 5 g/hour, then, increase tramadol to 250 mg (total dose over 24 hours).   
 If VAS is >3/10 for 72 hours, even with tramadol 250 mg (total dose over 24 hours) and

 If the pain persists VAS>3/10 for 72 hours on tramadol 250 mg (total dose over 24 
hours) and 10 g/hour, then, increase the dose of tramadol to 350 mg (total dose over 
24 hours).  
 If VAS pain is >3/10 x 72 hours with both tramadol 350 mg (total dose over 24 hours) 
and buprenorphine 10 g/hour, then, increase dose of buprenorphine to 15 g/hour.  
 If VAS pain >3/10 x 72 hours on tramadol 350 mg (total dose over 24 hours) and 15

(Post-radiation period)  T = 812 weeks:  if necessary, increase dose of buprenorphine up to 
20 mcg along with tramadol up to 400 mg/day as per titration schedule used in the first seven 
weeks until VAS is 3/10. If pain is well controlled (VAS 3/10 x 72 hours), start weekly 
tapering of buprenorphine by 5 mcg and tramadol by 50 mg daily. 
 
Special Circumstances 
If pain is uncontrolled with VAS >3/10 x 72 hours on 90 mg oxycodone (total dose over 24-hour 
period) and 20 g/hour of buprenorphine, then, buprenorphine patch can be taken off and other 
stronger pain medications can be started at clinicians discretion. If the patient is admitted and 
requires IV pain medication for pain control, then, the study drug regimen will be held, and data 
monitoring will stop for that time. The patient can be discharged on the study regimen (tramadol 
and buprenorphine) or a combination of oxycodone and buprenorphine patch or any other 
combination at clinicians discretion, and data monitoring will resume.

  Version Date: 01/26/24 5.5 Availability 
Both tramadol and buprenorphine are FDA approved and commercially available 
5.6 Usage of Concurrent/Concomitant Medications 
Use of all the medications mentioned below are allowed  
 Antidiarrheal like loperamide and Lomotil (atropi[INVESTIGATOR_224904]). 
 Antiemetics like prochlorperazine, steroids or serotonin antagonists may be used if 
clinically indicated. 
 Antihistamines. 
 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_178339]. 
 Anticoagulants. 
 Viscous lidocaine.  
 NSAIDS before starting study regimen.  
 Tylenol® before starting study drug regimen or any time for fever.   
 
CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers : Buprenorphine is mainly a substrate of CYP3A4, and the 
manufacturers and others advise caution in its concurrent use with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., 
cimetidine, clarithromycin, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, protease inhibitors), 
because it may cause decreased clearance of buprenorphine, which could lead to an increase 
in buprenorphine plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opi[INVESTIGATOR_9781]. If 
coadministration with TD buprenorphine is necessary, monitor patients for respi[INVESTIGATOR_224905]. Similarly, CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, 
phenytoin, rifampin) could reduce buprenorphine levels. These agents should be avoided during 
treatment with study regimen. If coadministration or discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer with 
TD buprenorphine is necessary, monitor for signs of opi[INVESTIGATOR_224906]. 
 
Anticholinergics:  Anticholinergics or other drugs with anticholinergic activity when used 
concurrently with opi[INVESTIGATOR_224907]/or 
severe constipation. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility 
when TD buprenorphine is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs.  
 
5.7 Prohibited Medications 
 
Alcohol, and use of other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], such as fentanyl or morphine or hydromorphone will not be 
allowed with study drug regimen. CNS depressants, such as benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], antidepressants, 
antipsychotics should be used with caution as concurrent use of these agents with any opi[INVESTIGATOR_224908], profound sedation and 
in rare cases even coma and death.

  Version Date: 01/26/[ADDRESS_270526] Compliance  
Study drug can be dispensed only to eligible patients under the supervision of the investigator or 
identified sub-investigator(s). The appropriate study personnel will maintain records of study 
drug receipt through WIPDMP website.  
5.9 OM Pain App  
5.9.1 Device Description/Overview 
The Oral Mucositis (OM) Pain App is a smartphone application that was designed to permit 
patients to key in pain severity using a visual analog 0[ADDRESS_270527] specific sleep/wake cycle preferences. 
Deidentified data collected on each patients smartphone will be transferred wirelessly to cloud 
storage.  Data transmitted wirelessly will use HTTP secure (HTTPS) sessions and JSON/XML 
protocols, such as the security used in online banking. Security measures and only deidentified 
data will be transmitted. Study participants will be encouraged not to update the  smartphone 
operating system during the conduct of the study. Study PIs and/or study coordinator will 
perform OM Pain App software updates on smartphones. 
Analysis of data collected from smartphones will be performed from cloud-stored data on 
deidentified sources only. This would be done in collaboration with our co-investigators at 
University of Wisconsin Milwaukee (UWM). The raw pain scores will be used to generate a time-
weighted measure of pain called total area under the pain curve (AUC). Average weekly pain 
scores will also be calculated. This is a summary measure that integrates serial assessments of 
a patients pain over the duration of the study. Architecture of the pain app is illustrated in 
figures [ADDRESS_270528] an active cellular phone service; but will 
have active wifi. Syncing of data from the phone will occur by [CONTACT_224973] (during initial 
testing) or by [CONTACT_224974] (later during software testing). The device will be collected from participants at 
the end of the study period.  
5.9.3 Daily Intervention 
Study Short Title: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       41     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/[ADDRESS_270529] week of radiation therapy, and no sooner 
than week 2, we dont expect to start data recording earlier than that. Recording of data will cease 
five weeks (week 12) after the end of radiation therapy at which time mucositis symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_224909] (see the schema). 
5.9.4 Avoiding Bias : A viewable graphic summary of pain scores will be a functionality of the app 
but will be disabled in this study to avoid bias of care provider or participant. For the feasibility 
phase, patients and providers will be blinded to the pain scores and symptoms will be managed 
with supportive treatments during routine weekly provider visits and symptom-initiated clinical 
visits.    
Study Short Title: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       42     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/24 5.9.5 Monitoring Compliance: The study coordinator will download data and check the 
equipment weekly for proper functioning and compliance. Patients will be interviewed weekly to 
assure the device is functioning correctly and that data are being recorded. Compliance with the 
device use will be assessed by [CONTACT_224975].  
5.10 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) 
To study the side effect profile of patients treated with transdermal buprenorphine and tramadol,  
we will use (PROMIS®) questionnaires. We will use PROMIS® cognition and gastrointestinal side 
effect assessment questionnaires for our secondary outcome analysis. For example, PROMIS® 
GI Symptom instrument has 60 items and assesses eight domains: gastroesophageal reflux (13 

Study Short Title: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       43     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/24 items), disrupted swallowing (seven items), diarrhea (five items), bowel incontinence/soilage (four 
items), nausea and vomiting (four items), constipation (nine items), belly pain (six items), and gas 
/bloating /flatulence (12 items). For the study purposes, we will only be using disrupted 
swallowing, constipation and nausea/vomiting forms. A higher score denotes more GI symptoms. 
Similarly, the PROMIS® Applied Cognition short form has four questions. A higher cognition score 
would denote more cognitive impairment. The recall period for PROMIS® GI Symptom items is 
around one week. We will be collecting PROMIS® data weekly through an in-person visit or 
through telephone interviews for up to [ADDRESS_270530] profile. (25, 26) The PROMIS® GI and cognition forms are included in appendix section of 
this protocol.  
5.[ADDRESS_270531] an electronic pain diary will be 
administered periodically by [CONTACT_9137], as per study calendar. The coordinator who is 
trained in using the WHO mucositis scale will grade mucositis weekly during radiation therapy. 
The Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire and MDASI-HN will also be administered weekly during 
radiation therapy and the follow-up period, as per study calendar. These questionnaires can also 
be administered through a telephone interview by a provider or CRC. All responses in the BPI 
(24) short form will be recorded, including severity of pain, impact of pain on daily function, location 
of pain, pain medications, and amount of pain relief in the past [ADDRESS_270532] week 
MDASI consists of 28 question items. Along with the core MDASIs 13 symptom items and 
six interference items, the MDASI-HN (21) also assesses nine symptoms relevant to head and 
neck cancer, such as mucus in the mouth and throat, difficulty swallowing or chewing, choking or 
coughing, difficulty with voice or speech, skin pain/burning/rash, constipation, problems with 
tasting food, mouth/throat sores and problems with teeth or gums. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_224910].

6 ADVERSE EVENTS: DEFINITIONS, COLLECTION AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
 
6.[ADDRESS_270534] a causal relationship with 
this treatment. (International Conference on Harmonization [ICH], E2A, E6). 
 
This study will utilize the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
5.0, located on the CTEP web site: 
Study Short Title: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       44     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/24 https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm 
Adverse events (AEs) may be spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an 
open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other 
diagnostic procedures. 
For the purpose of the study, only the adverse events related to the study intervention will be 
reported for regulatory oversight (e.g., related to OM Pain App, drug regimen of buprenorphine 
and tramadol, etc.).   
Adverse events related to anticancer therapy will not be reported, as these treatments are 
considered standard of care and are not the focus of investigation of this trial.   
Some patients who are enrolled in a therapeutic clinical trial may also be eligible for the present 
study. Adverse events related to cancer treatment in these patients will be reported under the 
umbrella of their active treatment clinical trial.   
For this study, adverse events may be defined as follows:  
 Loss of device (including theft,). AirWatch will be loaded on each mobile device that is 
provided to participants. MCW Information Service agrees to provide oversight and 
assistance to deactivate lost or stolen devices.  
 Loss of protected health information.  
 Established side effects of tramadol and buprenorphine for example: skin reaction to 
transdermal patch, central nervous system depression, respi[INVESTIGATOR_224913], prolonged QTc> [ADDRESS_270535]-of-care radiation and 
chemotherapy. For details, refer to Section 7.   
 
Radiation related Adverse Events  
 
Radiation toxicity data will be used to associate with OM pain data. All acute and late adverse 
events from radiation therapy will be recorded and scored for severity using the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. As noted, a copy of the CTCAE 
v5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP home page (  https://ctep.cancer.gov/ ). While radiation 
therapy side effects will be recorded, they will not be reported as adverse events for the purpose 
of the study, because its purpose is to evaluate the efficacy of the study drug regimen.  The 
radiation therapy will be delivered according to the standard of care and not directed by [CONTACT_47375].  
Chemotherapy Adverse Events  
Chemotherapy-related toxicity data will be used to associate with OM pain data. All acute and late 
adverse events from chemotherapy will be recorded and scored for severity using the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Toxicity data will be 
recorded because cumulative toxicity may have indirect effects on pain perception.   
Study Short Title: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       45     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/24 While chemotherapy side effects will be recorded, they will not be reported as adverse events for 
the purpose of the study, because the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 
buprenorphine and tramadol combination regimen.  
The investigator and his or her team will follow the Medical College of Wisconsin policies related 
to adverse event reporting. This information may be found on the Human Research Protection 
Program website.   
6.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that results in any of the 
following outcomes: 
 Death. Results in death. 
 Life-threatening . Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe). 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_109577] (see clarification in the paragraph below on planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]). 
 Disability/incapacity . Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
(Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a persons ability to conduct normal life 
functions). 
 Pregnancy  
 Medically important event . This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be 
immediately life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered serious 
when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or involves suspected 
transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent. Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse; any organism, virus, or infectious 
particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), 
pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. 
 
6.1.3 Attribution of an Adverse Event 
An assessment of the relationship between the adverse event and the medical intervention, using 
the following categories: 
Related : The AE is clearly related to the intervention . There is clear evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship, and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The AE is likely related to 
the intervention. There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The AE may be related to the intervention. There is some evidence to suggest 
a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the 
trial medication). However, the influence of other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., 
the subjects clinical condition, other concomitant events).  
 
Unrelated:  The AE is doubtfully related to the intervention. A clinical event, including an abnormal 
laboratory test result, whose temporal relationship to drug administration makes a causal 
Study Short Title: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       46     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/24 relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration 
of the trial medication) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides 
plausible explanations (e.g., the subjects clin ical condition, other concomitant treatments). The 
AE is clearly NOT related to the intervention.  The AE is completely independent of study drug 
administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology.  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_270536] for the study intervention. 
 
6.2 Collection and Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events and Serious Adverse   
      Events 
6.2.1 Collection of Adverse Events 
All adverse events (including SAEs) must be recorded in OnCore® and/or an adverse event log. 
All AEs required to be collected must be graded according to the CTCAE v5. When possible, 
signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one 
comprehensive event. Investigators or treating physicians assessment of AE attributions must 
also be documented.  
 
AEs will be collected from the time of initiation of drug regimen to the end of follow up period. AEs 
will be tracked and followed until resolution, subject withdraws consent, or is lost to follow-up 
(including subjects who discontinue early). All adverse events collected per the protocol will be 
followed with appropriate medical management until they are resolved, if they are related to the 
study treatment, or until the investigator deems the event to be chronic.  
 
Please see sections 6.1.1, 6.2.2 and Table 3 to identify the adverse events that need to be 
reported.  
 
6.2.2 Reporting of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Please refer to Table 3 below to identify adverse events that meet reporting requirements. All 
serious adverse events (SAEs) that occur after the subject has signed the consent form through 
[ADDRESS_270537] dose of study drug(s) will be reported. All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory 
resolution, or until the investigator deems the event to be chronic.  All serious adverse events 
(SAEs) must also be documented in OnCore®.

  Version Date: 01/26/[ADDRESS_270540] on kappa and 
delta opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328].(13, 36) It is also a low-molecular weight compound (467 g/mol), has a 
low melting point, is lipophilic and water soluble, making it an ideal candidate for transdermal 
administration. (37) 
7.1.[ADDRESS_270541] gives transdermal buprenorphine an edge over some of the other long-
acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], as there is less likelihood of side effects related to periodic plasma drug level 
surges associated with some of the other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. The longer half-life of buprenorphine and its 
high affinity to the µ-receptor make it longer lasting and up to 100 times more efficacious (per mg) 
as an analgesic than morphine. For usage as a transdermal patch, buprenorphine is incorporated 
into an adhesive polymer matrix (acrylate vinyl acetate), from which it is continuously released 
into the systemic circulation over a period of seven days. Buprenorphine transdermal patch (BTP) 
is available in three strengths  5, 10, and 20 mg  with a rate of drug release of 5, 10, and 20 
mg/h, respectively. Following removal of the patch, concentrations decrease to about one-half in 
12 hours, and then decline more gradually with an apparent half-life of about 26 hours.(38) 
Unlike other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], it has a ceiling effect, which means its effects increase until the person takes 
a certain amount; then, these effects level off. This limits euphoria and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]. 
7.1.3 Metabolism 
Buprenorphine is metabolized by [CONTACT_4852], via CYP3A4 (also CYP2C8 seems to be involved) 
isozymes of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system into norbuprenorphine (by N-dealkylation). The 
glucuronidation of buprenorphine is primarily carried out by [CONTACT_15924]1A1 and UGT2B7, and that of 
norbuprenorphine by [CONTACT_15924]1A1 and UGT1A3. These glucuronides are then eliminated mainly 
through excretion into bile. The elimination half-life of buprenorphine is 20 to 73 hours (mean 37 
hours). Due to the mainly hepatic elimination, there is no risk of accumulation in people with renal 
impairment.(39) One of the major active metabolites of buprenorphine is norbuprenorphine, 
which, in contrast to buprenorphine itself, is a full agonist of the MOR, DOR, and ORL-1, and a 
partial agonist at the KOR. However, relative to buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine has extremely 
little antinociceptive potency (1/50th that of buprenorphine), but markedly depresses respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] 
(10-fold more than buprenorphine). This may be explained by [CONTACT_224976]: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       49     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/[ADDRESS_270542] on respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide has no affinity 
for the MOR or DOR but does bind to the KOR (Ki = 300 nm.) and ORL-1 (Ki = 18 M). It has a 
sedative effect but no effect on respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].(40, 41) 
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_270543] 
may result in acute withdrawal (see "Monitoring"), thus, defeating the purpose of buprenorphine 
administration. Concurrent use of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], other CNS depressants and alcohol is 
prohibited. (42) 
 
7.1.5 Side Effects  
Common side effects (>5%) of buprenorphine include nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness, 
dizziness, headache, and sweating.  It may also cause central nervous system depression, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], and QT prolongation. Anticholinergic side effects like dry mouth, miosis, 
orthostatic hypotension, and urinary retention are also seen. Transdermal patches are also 
associated with contact [CONTACT_224977].  (42) If QTc prolongation of more than [ADDRESS_270544] milk.  HIV: 
Since many HAART drugs also affect the liver microsomal enzymes, healthcare workers should 
closely monitor liver function and drug levels in patients who have buprenorphine prescribed at 
the same time. In some patients, the dose of buprenorphine may require alteration. 
Hepatitis:  
Both hepatitis B and C are common comorbid conditions in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent patients. Since 
buprenorphine break down occurs in the liver, these patients should have their liver function and 
drug levels closely monitored. Clinicians should caution patients with hepatitis that intravenous 
use of buprenorphine has correlations with liver damage. 
Complete and updated information is available in the investigational drug brochure and/or product 
package insert.  
Study Short Title: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       50     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/24 Others:  Specific patient populations, such as the elderly, debilitated patients, or those with pre-
existing pulmonary disease are at greater risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_224914]. It 
should be used with extreme caution in these individuals.  
7.1.7  Dose Adjustments:  No dose adjustments for liver or renal impairment required for TD 
buprenorphine. Refer to Table 3.   
7.1.8  Drug Administration and Handling:  Instruct patients to apply it immediately after 
removal from the individually sealed pouch. Instruct patients not to use TD buprenorphine if the 
pouch seal is broken or the patch is cut, damaged, or changed in any way. See the instructions 
for use for step-by-step instructions for applying TD buprenorphine. TD buprenorphine can be 
applied to any of these sites, including the upper outer arm, upper chest, upper back or the side 
of the chest. These four sites (each present on both sides of the body) provide eight possible 
application sites. The patients should be advised as follows: Rotate TD buprenorphine among 
the eight described skin sites. After TD buprenorphine removal, wait a minimum of [ADDRESS_270545] patients or caregivers to wash the area 
with water and not to use soap, alcohol, or other solvents to remove the adhesive because they 
may enhance the absorption of the drug.  
 
Disposal Instructions:   Patients should refer to the instructions for use for proper disposal of 
TD buprenorphine. Dispose of used and unused patches by [CONTACT_224978]-Disposal Unit that is packaged with the TD buprenorphine patches. Alternatively, patients 
can dispose of used patches by [CONTACT_224979], then flushing the 
patch down the toilet immediately upon removal. Unused patches should be removed from their 
pouches, the protective liners removed, the patches folded so that the adhesive side of the 
patch adheres to itself, and immediately flushed down the toilet. Patients should dispose of any 
patches remaining from a prescription as soon as they are no longer needed.  
 
Rash Related to TD buprenorphine:  
Erythema and mild pruritis from TD buprenorphine are common. If localized erythema or rash is 
observed, then, the site of application of patch should be changed. In rare cases, if severe 
application site skin reactions with signs of marked inflammation including burn, discharge, 
and vesicles are noticed, then, the patch should be discontinued. If severe anaphylactic 
reaction, bronchospasm or angioedema occurs from the study drug regimen then it should be 
discontinued.

  Version Date: 01/26/24 7.2.6  Rationale for Using Oral Tramadol with Transdermal Buprenorphine   
Tramadol is being used for breakthrough pain as TD buprenorphine is long acting.  
 
7.2.7 Dose adjustments in renal failure 
No dose adjustment of tramadol is required for creatinine clearance >30ml/min. Creatinine 
clearance <30ml/min:  restrict maximum daily dose of tramadol immediate release to 200 mg/day.  
 
7.2.8 Dose Adjustment in Liver Failure 
 No dose adjustment is required in mild to moderate liver failure (Child Pugh class A and B). 
Restrict dose to 50 mg q12 in severe liver impairment . Refer to Table 4

8.[ADDRESS_270553] of all treated patients whose treatment followed 
without major protocol violations. This population will be used for sensitivity analyses. 
 
8.4 Determination of Sample Size and Accrual Rate  
 
Based on earlier studies (48) and the IMMPACT recommendations(28), a 30% or higher decrease 
in pain score from baseline to the end of the follow-up period is a sign of clinically meaningful 
efficacy of the drug regimen within a patient. A randomized trial of pregabalin for the treatment of 
radiotherapy-related pain in head-and-neck cancer patients (33) observed an at least 30% 
decrease in 33% of placebo-treated patients. This study will use a single-stage design to evaluate 
the hypothesis that patients treated with buprenorphine will achieve at least a 30% decrease in 
pain with probability exceeding 33%. Formally, the following hypotheses will be evaluated at a 
one-sided 5% significance level:  
 
H0: p ( 30% decrease) = 0.33  versus   H a p (30% decrease) > 0.33. 
 
With [ADDRESS_270554] 80% power to reject the null hypothesis if the 
probability of achieving at least 30% decrease in pain with buprenorphine is, in fact, 63%. The 
hypothesized effect is consistent with the efficacy seen with other active treatments. Specifically, 
Study Short Title: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       54     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/[ADDRESS_270555] 30% pain reduction. We will enroll 20 subjects to allow for 10% 
drop-out rate. 
8.5 Feasibility 
We will be able to complete protocol development and receive IRB approval in two months. Based 
on our previous experience, we normally see around 64 stage IIIV HNSCC patients annually 
who fulfill the eligibility criteria of the study. During [ADDRESS_270556] 25 subjects. Under an assumed 80% consent rate, 19 to 20 subjects will 
be enrolled into the study. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, we will end up with around 18 patients 
participating in our study. Since close to 100% patients develop mucositis and develop at least 
moderate intensity pain requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_224919], we do not 
anticipate any screen failures. However, if a screen failure occurs for some reason then we plan 
to replace those patients to ensure an evaluation of [ADDRESS_270557] that the pain curve follows a nonlinear pattern during 
radiation therapy, but it plateaus and later drops down to a lower level after initiation of long-acting 
effective pain medications. Hence, it is reasonable to use the pain score on the day of treatment 
initiation as our baseline pain score. (29, 31) Radiation-induced mucositis begins to heal 
approximately two weeks after the last dose of stomatotoxic chemotherapy or radiation 
therapy.(30, 32) We will assess a percentage drop in the pain score by [CONTACT_199487] [ADDRESS_270558] shown that a 30% drop in average weekly pain score by [CONTACT_224983]-up period is 
significant. (28). The recording of data will cease after 12 weeks, at which time mucositis-related 
pain symptoms substantially abate in many individuals. (32) 
 
The primary analysis will compare the proportion of patients achieving a 30% drop in pain scores 
to the null-hypothesis value of 33% at a one-sided 5% significance level using a binomial test. 
The number of patients using analgesic and non-analgesic medications, as well as the occurrence 
of adverse events, will be tabulated and presented as counts with percentages. The average 
weekly pain scores, MDASI-HN, and the PROMIS® measures will be reported with descriptive 
statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, and range). Patient level summaries of the pain 
score and PRO outcomes will be created by [CONTACT_224984] (AUC) of weekly 
averages. Scatterplots will be used to explore their relationship which will be quantified by 
[CONTACT_4532]s correlation coefficient. Further correlational analysis will be done by [CONTACT_224985].  
 
8.7 Rationale for not Having a Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020]: This is a supportive care pi[INVESTIGATOR_224920]: Buprenorphine- Mucositis Pain- HN Study       55     Version No.: 8 
  Version Date: 01/26/[ADDRESS_270559]-of-care pain 
medications, such as oral oxycodone in our study for patients who dont derive adequate pain 
relief from the study regimen. Hence, it is reasonable to exclude a formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_224921].  
8.8 Missing Data   
Missing data will be investigated, and multiple imputations will be used to account for 
missingness. Multiple imputations will be performed under the assumption that missing data are 
missing at random (MAR). If the validity of the MAR assumption is questioned, possible 
departures from MAR will be investigated by [CONTACT_224986]. 
 
8.9 Research Environment  
The study will be activated at the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) Cancer Center. The 
cancer center employs 57 full-time and two part-time staff. It is the only academic cancer center 
in Eastern Wisconsin, supporting more than 2.3 million people. The MCW Cancer Center Clinical 
Trials Office (CTO) will conduct the study and support all stages of the clinical trial process, 
including: protocol feasibility, regulatory support, compliance monitoring, consent development, 
IRB submission, budget development, contract negotiation, trial coordination and management, 
trial promotion and referrals, and patient screening, enrollment and consenting, data collection 
and management and results monitoring and reporting. The Division of Biostatistics at MCW will 
provide statistical support and perform analysis. As a recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22874] a clinical and translational 
science award from NIH, with a recent five-year, $20 million renewal, the Medical College of 
Wisconsin is representing a consortium of Milwaukee institutions (Clinical and Translational 
Science Institute of Southeast Wisconsin [CTSI]) working in collaboration to advance biomedical 
research, clinical care, and education.

This study will be conducted in compliance with: 
 The protocol. 
 Federal regulations, as applicable, including 21 CFR 50 (Protection of Human 
Subjects/Informed Consent); 21 CFR 56 (Institutional Review Boards) and 45 CFR 46 
Subparts A (Common Rule), B (Pregnant Women, Human Fetuses and Neonates), C 
(Prisoners), and D (Children), GCP/ICH guidelines, and all applicable regulatory 
requirements. The IRB must comply with the regulations in 21 CFR §[ADDRESS_270564] 
 
The protocol, the proposed informed consent form, and all forms of participant information 
related to the study (e.g., advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_182199]. Before obtaining MCW approval, the protocol 
must be approved by [CONTACT_224988]. The initial protocol and all protocol amendments must be approved by [CONTACT_176295].  
 
Informed Consent Process Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individuals agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout the individuals study  participation. Extensive discussion of risks 
and possible benefits of this therapy will be provided to the subjects and their families. Consent 
forms describing in detail the study interventions/products, study procedures, and risks are given 
to the subject and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting 
intervention/administering study product. 
Consent forms will be IRB approved and the subject (and legally authorized representative, if 
necessary) will be asked to read and review the document. Upon reviewing the document, the 
investigator will explain the research study to the subject and answer any questions that may 
arise. In accordance with [ADDRESS_270565] will sign and date the informed consent 
document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study.  
A witness should only sign when required, per FH/MCW IRB policy. If a witness signs the 
document when not required, the study staff should document in the legal medical record (or note 
to file) the relationship to the patient and why a witness signed. (i.e., Although not required, the 
subjects spouse was present during the consenting process and signed as the witness. Or 
Although not required, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_224924] a 
witness.)

  Version Date: 01/26/[ADDRESS_270566] at the next 
appropriate opportunity. Patients who require reconsenting will be defined in the IRB-approved 
amendment submission. The process for obtaining informed consent will again be performed. 
Study subjects will not be reconsented for continuing reviews. The MCWCC CTO will follow the 
MCW/FH IRBs policy for subjects who demonstrate limited English proficiency or limited literacy.  
After the subjects visit in which the consent is si gned, it is documented in the clinic chart that the 
consent has been signed and that all questions have been answered to the subjects satisfaction 
after adequate time for the review of the consent. It is also documented that a copy of the consent 
is given to the subject. The original consent is kept with the subjects study file, and a copy of the 
consent is sent to the OCRICC office, which will then submit to HIM a copy of the signed consent 
to be scanned into EPIC, the legal medical record. 
10.[ADDRESS_270567] Confidentiality and Access to Source Documents/Data 
Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_456]-investigator, participating 
investigators, and any staff, [and the sponsor(s) and their agents] (include bracketed portion if 
applicable). This confidentiality includes clinical information relating to participating subjects, as 
well as any genetic or biological testing. 
The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict 
confidence. No information concerning the study, or the data will be released to any unauthorized 
third party without prior written approval of the principal investigator. 
The conditions for maintaining the confidentiality of the subjects records are required for the life 
of the data. These rules apply equally to any and all MCWCC projects.  
One risk of taking part in a research study is that more people will handle the personal health 
information collected for this study. The study team will make every effort to protect the information 
and keep it confidential, but it is possible that an unauthorized person might see it. Depending on 
the kind of information being collected, it might be used in a way that could embarrass the subject 
or affect his/her ability to get insurance. 
While data are being collected and after all data have been collected but are still in the process 
of being analyzed, the subjects data/PHI are stored in the locked clinical research office in the 
Clinical Trials Office. Databases in which the study subject information is stored and accessed 
are password protected, allowing for limited access by [CONTACT_182201]. Data/PHI kept 
in the case report forms contain the study identifiers, subject initials, date of birth, and date of

10.5.2  Protection of Privacy 
As noted, patients will be informed of the extent to which their confidential health information 
generated from this study may be used for research purposes. Following this discussion, they will 
be asked to sign informed consent documents. The original signed document will become part of 
the patients medical records, and each patient  will receive a copy of the signed document.

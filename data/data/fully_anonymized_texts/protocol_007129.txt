study at 36 w PMA and 3 months corrected age.  Aim 1 will be observational, using physiological data to 
develop predictive mathematical models for outcomes. Aim 2 will determine if late (at or beyond postnatal day 14) mild permissive hypercapnia is associated with reduction in apnea, bradycardia, and hypoxemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_21232]. Aim 3 will determine if servo -controlled 
oxygen environment is associated with reduction in hypoxemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_21233], as compared to oxygen administered by [CONTACT_21293].

3.3. BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
 Aim 1:  
The respi[INVESTIGATOR_21240]. Preterm infants have irregular breathing due to immaturity of these brainstem circuits. The 
irregularity in breathing can be quantified by  [CONTACT_21295] (IBI), the time interval between 
breaths, and its variations in time around the mean (the IBI variability) ( 1, 2). The probability density 
distribution (P) of IBIs follows a power  law, P(IBI) ~ IBI-α, with the expo nent α indicating the relative risk 
of insufficient  breathing. With maturation, α increases from 2.6 +0.4 at 41+ 4 wk to 3.2+ 0.4 at 47 +6 wk 
PMA, indicating a decrease in apnea (p = 0.002)  (1, 2). Analysis of IBI in infants indicates stochastic 
characteristics (1) as well as deterministic dynamic characteristics (e.g. low frequency oscillations with 
periodic apnea) ( 3).  
The Analytical Core with Drs. Indic, Paydarfar, and Bloch -Salisbury has pi[INVESTIGATOR_21241], providing a 
framework for computing the instantaneous estimates of variability in breathing ( 2, 4). In this point 
process model, a lognormal parametric structure represents the stochastic nature of IBI and a higher p -
6 
order autoregressive (AR (p)) model describes the dynamic nature of IBI (2 ). The descriptors used to 
study the instantaneous characteristics of IBI 
include: 1) mean IBI, M; 2) variance of IBI, V; 
3) sk ewness of IBI, S; 4) kurtosis of IBI, K ; 5) 
mean respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], Mr ; 6) variance of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], Vr ; 7) spectrum, and 8) 
poles. These parameters and descriptors provide an innovative approach for the assessment of instability of breathing in neonates. Figure [ADDRESS_20174] step increases 
both prior and during the apnea event.  
Figure 2 indicates how both 
spectrum and predominant pole provides 
additional dynamic measures of IBI instability 
that precede apnea. Kolmogorov -Smirnov 
(KS) tests and autocorrelation plots indicate that the model is able to accurately capture the stochastic struc ture. Similar point process 
models have been developed for bradycardia and its severity.  Integrated power spectrum 
dynamics are larger following apneic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], indicating that apnea induces instability in IBI that is maintained for at least 
several minut es following apnea (which is 
familiar to clinicians, as one epi[INVESTIGATOR_21242]) ( Figure 3 ). 
  In preterm infants, cardio -respi[INVESTIGATOR_21243] -mediate d autonomic effects on the 
heart, although the exact relationship between heart rate variability (HRV) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_21244] (5
). The influence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_21245] (called “respi[INVESTIGATOR_21246]” or RSA) is detected by a peak in the power spectrum of HRV at the 
breathing frequency. This signature [CONTACT_21320] ~1 Hz (60/min) in a preterm neonate, but may not be observed due to irregularity in breathing. We have developed a new framework  for studying the interaction 
between heart rate variability and respi[INVESTIGATOR_21247] ( 6). We quantified cardio -respi[INVESTIGATOR_21248] 11 preterm infants using multivariate autoregressive analysis and calculated the 
coherence as well as gain using causal approaches. The significance of the interactions in each infant Figure 1: (a) Instantaneous time varying estimated µ 
and σ2 for the IBI data from a preterm infant with local 
likelihood window W= 120 s , time step Δt = 0.05, α =

by [CONTACT_21297], autocorrelation function, and KS analysis). (b)

was determined by [CONTACT_21298]. The method 
was tested in control conditions as well as in two 
different experimental conditions; with and without use 
of mild vibrotactile intervention.  Compared to traditional 
spectral techniques, this bivariate approach considers 
both the R -R interval and respi[INVESTIGATOR_21249] a single 
modeling framework and is able to separate the 
mutually directional causal interactions between RR and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. The  closed -loop causal formulation 
quantifies features otherwise not identifiable by [CONTACT_21299][INVESTIGATOR_21250] (
6). Of note, we found a large percentage 
of power in the LF (0.01 -0.015Hz) range due to pauses in 
breathing and slow frequency patterns in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_21251]. Our finding of a bidirectional interaction between 
HRV and respi[INVESTIGATOR_21252].    
  We have recently shown in a prospective cohort 
study of [ADDRESS_20175] survivors ( 7). It 
is possible that recurrent hypoxemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_21253]. This hypothesis will be rigorously tested in this Aim.  
 
Aim 2:  
Abnormal regulation of breathing is the underlying cause of apnea of prematurity. Gerhardt and 
Bancalari (8
) demonstrate d more than three decades ago that compared to gestational age, postnatal 
age and birth weight -matched control infants without apnea, infants with apnea had lower tidal 
volume  (4.4 + 1 vs 5.3 + 1.6 mL/kg) , lower alveolar ventilation  (96 + 21 v 129 + 33 m L/kg/min) , higher 
alveolar PCO 2 (45.4 + 8.5 vs 35.6 + 4.7 mm Hg) , lower esophageal pressure change (4.5 + 0.9 vs 6.0 + 1.8 
cm H 2O), and flatter slope of the CO 2 response curve (ΔVe/ΔPaco 2 (20.2 +/- 10.6 vs 40.7 +/- 19.9 
mL/min/kg/mm Hg CO 2). This impaired central chemosensitivity is improved by [CONTACT_21300]. Importantly, Carlo (UAB Co -Inv) et al. ( 9) 
demonstrated in healthy preterm infants using electromyograms (EMGs) and hyperoxic CO [ADDRESS_20176] muscles (e.g. genioglossus and alae nasi) have a higher CO [ADDRESS_20177] collapse and obstructive apnea.  
The baseline PaCO 2 in both preterm infants is only 1.3 mm Hg above the apneic threshold 
compared to 3 -4 mm Hg for adults ( 10) and this closeness suggests that small oscillations of PaCO 2 in 
response to carotid body hyperactivity, mild hyperventilation, stimulation, etc may lead to apnea. In 
preterm  infants , eupneic PaCO 2 was 38.6 +1 mm Hg, the pre - periodic breathing 
PaCO 2 apneic  threshold  was 37.3 + [ADDRESS_20178] -periodic PaCO 2 was 37.2 + 1.4 mm Hg, and the 
transition from eupneic PaCO 2 to PaCO 2 apneic  threshold  preceding periodic breathing was 
accompanied by a small increase in breathing frequency ( 10). Figure 3. (a) Average power 
spectrum in a ti me frequency 
representation for the IBI data from a 
preterm infant with apneic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
Zero on time axis represents the time of apnea event. (b) Average 
integrated power (black 
line) along 
with the 95% confidence interval (gray 
line). The average power is 
significantly different prior and post 
apnea events with p< 0.001 (From 
Indic et al. 2013).  
[ADDRESS_20179] shown earlier that a ventilatory strategy of mild permissive 
hypercapnia (PaCO 2 45-55 mm Hg) compared to normocapnia (35 -45 mm Hg) is associated with fewer 
very preterm infants on assisted ventilation during the first 96 hours after randomization, and without 
differences in mortality, air leaks, intraventricular hemorrhage, PDA or other complications ( 11). On the 
other hand, evaluation of a higher PaCO [ADDRESS_20180] 7 postnatal days suggested that clinical outcomes were not improved with the hypercapnia  maybe because the duration or ma gnitude of hypercapnia were not sufficient ( 12).  
In the SAVE study, to determine whether minimal ventilation (PCO 2 target >52 mm Hg) 
decreased death or BPD, compared to routine ventilation (PCO 2 target <48 mm Hg), preterm infants 
(birth weight 501 -1000g) and mechanically ventilated before 12h were randomly assigned to either 
minimal or routine ventilation strategies, along with a tapered dexamethasone course or placebo for 10 
days, using a 2x2 factorial d esign (13). After enrollment of 220 patients, the trial was halted because of 
nonrespi[INVESTIGATOR_21254] (spontaneous intestinal perforation). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_21255], an important finding was that ventilator support at 36 weeks was 1% 
in the minimal versus 16% in the routine group (p <0.01). However, there was no difference in 
BPD/death at 36w (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.77- 1.12, p=0.43)  due to the inclusion of moderate BPD and death 
in the outcome (13).  
More recently, in SUPPORT comparing CPAP and a protocol- driven limited ventilation strategy to 
early intubation, surfactant and conventional ventilation strategy, infants in the CPAP group had 
extubation criteria that included a PaCO2 <65 
mm Hg with pH>7.2  (14). On the other  hand, 
the surfactant group had extubation criteria 
that included a PaCO2 <50 mm Hg with 
pH>7.3 (14). The primary outcome of death or 
physiological BPD at 36w PMA was not 
significantly different, but better secondary 
outcomes were noted in the CPAP group (e.g. 
lower mortality in the [ADDRESS_20181] eroids) (14). 
However, apn ea and instability in oxygenation 
were not specifically evaluated in this trial. We 
performed a secondary analysis of PaCO 2 in 
relation to outcome in SUPPORT, and 
observed that severe IVH, BPD, and 
neurodevelopmental impairment were 
associated with hypercapnic infants 
(maximum PaCO [ADDRESS_20182] quartile) and 
fluctuators (infants with both hypercapnia and 
hypocapnia – with m aximum PaCO [ADDRESS_20183] 
quartile) (15). Maximum PaCO 2 was positively correlated with maximum FiO 2 (rs 0.55, p<0.0001) and 
ventilator days (r s 0.61, p<0.0001), generally considered markers of illness severity, suggesting that high 
PaCO 2 is a surrogate marker for respi[INVESTIGATOR_21256] ( 15). Of interest, the average PaCO 2 even in 
infants without severe IVH was ≥[ADDRESS_20184] two postnatal weeks with a relatively narrow IQR 
(∼10 mm Hg). Our data suggest clinical practices have evolved to maintain PaCO 2 in the  ‘permissive 
hypercapnia’ range (45 –55 mm Hg)(15). Figure 4: Trend view of heart rate (HR), oxygen 
saturation (SpO 2), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR), and 
transcutaneous PCO 2 (TcPCO 2;~15 mmHg above 
PaCO 2 in this infant) in a 2 week old preterm infant 
on low SIMV settings (rate 25, 15/4, FiO 2 0.21-
0.25) . SpO [ADDRESS_20185] week or two (when the theoretical risk of IVH due to 
higher PaCO 2 has also resolved) will keep the PaCO 2 above the apneic threshold PCO 2 (that is normally 
only 1 mm Hg below the baseline PaCO 2)(10) and lower the rate of apnea. Mild permissive hypercapnia 
may elevate the PaCO 2 sufficiently above the apneic threshold, improving stability of oxygenation. In our 
NICU, we frequently observe on trend analysis ([ADDRESS_20186], along with waveform 
and real- time values) that infants have fewer apnea and desaturations when they have a higher TcPCO2 
(Figure 4) but this phenomenon has not been systematically investigated.  
 
Aim 3:  
The goal of oxygen supplementation is to maintain stability of oxygenation, i.e., adequate 
oxygenation while minimizing epi[INVESTIGATOR_21257]. Preterm infants have respi[INVESTIGATOR_21258] ( 16). 
As a consequence, preterm  infants spend a considerable proportion of time outside (usually higher 
than) the targeted range ( 17). While avoiding hypoxemia is important, hyperoxemia can lead to 
oxidative injury. Intermittent hypoxem ia in preterm infants is associated with epi[INVESTIGATOR_21259]. Caregivers often increase FiO
2 during these epi[INVESTIGATOR_21260], leading to a pattern of intermittent hypoxemia alternating with hyperoxemia.  
inter mittent hypoxemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_21261]- term (e.g. increased 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], retinopathy of prematurity, and time to full feeds) (18) and longer -term outcomes 
(e.g. neurodevelopmental impairment or NDI) (16). Using data from a subset of 115 preterm infants 
enrolled in the SUPPORT trial, Di Fiore et al. (19) found that infants randomized to the lower SpO 2 target 
range (85 -89%) had more epi[INVESTIGATOR_21262] [defined as ≤ 80 % for ≥ 10 seconds and ≤ 
3 minutes] in the 12 days after birth and beyond 57 days after birth compared to infants randomized to the higher oxygen saturation (91 -95%) target range [p <0.05]. These epi[INVESTIGATOR_21263]. Di Fiore et al. (18) 
had previously found that hypoxemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_21264] [50 -100/day] in infants at the lowest 
gestations and increase until [ADDRESS_20187] II trials ( 20). Targeting higher SpO
2 [91-95%] increased the risk of severe retinopathy of 
prematurity [RR 0.74; 95 % CI, 0.59- 0.92] whil e targeting lower SpO 2 [85-89 %] increased the risk of 
death [1.41; 95 % CI 1.14- 1.74] and necrotizing enterocolitis [RR 1.25; 95 % CI 1.05 -1.49] (20). Rates of 
BPD [RR 0.95; 95 % CI, 0.86- 1.04] or other outcomes were not different between groups. Therefore, the 
higher oxygen saturation target (91 -95% or 90 -95% based on expert recommendations) is used at UAB.  
A prospective study followed 71 premature infants < 1500 g receiving O 2 until they reached 31 
weeks’ PMA (21). Infants on nasal cannulae sp ent more time above the target range compared to 
infants on NIPPV/CPAP [Mean ± SD, 60 ± 14 v 41 ± 17%; p<0.002] indicating that O [ADDRESS_20188] SpO 2 targeting. O 2 delivery at flows ≤ 1 liter through nasal cannulae, although common, is 
relative ly unstudied and many infants receive an effective FiO 2 <0.23 (22). Nasal cannulae allow 
entrainment of air with infant breaths ( 23, 24). The effective hypopharyngeal fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_5697] O 2 
[FiO 2] can be calculated using formulae incorporating FiO 2, cannula flow, and minute ventilation ( 24-27). 
However, effective O 2 concentration is affected by [CONTACT_21301], volume, and inspi[INVESTIGATOR_21265] ( 28). At our NICU, the incubators are fitted 
with a servo -controlled system (Giraffe incubator with a Servo Control Oxygen System and Giraffe 
Omnibed) for inspi[INVESTIGATOR_5697] O [ADDRESS_20189] termed “oxygen environment”. Oxygen is 
pumped into the incubator and titrated to a set FiO [ADDRESS_20190] able SpO 2 in preterm infants that are receiving O 2 therapy compared to nasal 
cannulae but this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested.  
Oxygen environment avoids the difficulty of needing to calculate effective O 2 concentrations as 
the set O 2 concentration is equal to the hypopharyngeal O 2 concentration and there is no change in 
hypopharyngeal O 2 concentration with mouth breathing or with fluctuations in respi[INVESTIGATOR_21266]. 
Oxygen environment and nasal cannulae are both commonly used methods of O 2 delivery at UAB and 
worldwide. If one method is found to be more effective at maintaining the stability of oxygen 
saturations and decreasing epi[INVESTIGATOR_21267].

[CONTACT_21304]), T CCO 2 (transcutaneous CO 2), r cSO 2 (near -infrared cerebral oximetry), r sSO 2 (near -
infrared somatic oximetry), and temperature. Data acquisition, band -pass filtering, and wavelet 
transforms of the signals will be done as described ( 2, 4, 6, 29).  
We will develop mathematical models of ventilatory patterns to predict apneic, 
hypoxemic and/or bradycardic epi[INVESTIGATOR_21235]. We will quantify 
the irregularity in breathing using the IBI and IBI variability as defined earlie r (2, 4). The normal 
IBI is around 1 second, but due to the irregular breathing pattern in preterm infants, this may vary from <1s to 20s or longer. For this study, we will define eupnea as IBI < 2s and apneic range 
as IBI>5s as done previously ( 29). The basic assumptions of the point pro cess model for 
breathing are that peak inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (maximal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_21270] -invasively) is a 
discrete event marked by [CONTACT_21305][INVESTIGATOR_21271]- forward loops modulating the respi[INVESTIGATOR_21272]. In addition to 
the respi[INVESTIGATOR_21273], we will develop models using the ECG and SpO
[ADDRESS_20194] developed point process models for the evaluation of bradycardia and its severity.  
 
Aim 2:  
(a) We will use the data from the [ADDRESS_20195] 24h of the data collection will be the baseline 
data. Over the next 72h, we will evaluate 3 interventions in a cross -over manner, with the initial 
intervention randomly assigned (computer -generated): Intervention 1  (24-48h of data), 
Intervention 2 (48 -72h), and Intervention 3 (72 -96h). For example, Intervention 1 may be to 
increase TcCO
2 by 5 mm Hg above baseline (at the time of capi[INVESTIGATOR_21274]) and maintain at 
that level (by [CONTACT_21306], by c linician decision) for 24h, and Intervention 2 
will be to decrease TcCO 2 by 5 mm Hg back to initial values (by [CONTACT_21307], 
by [CONTACT_21308]) for the next 24h. Intervention 3 will be to repeat Intervention 1 (to 
increase TcCO 2 by 5 mm Hg) to validate that results of Intervention 1 are due to increased PCO 2 
and less likely to be random fluctuations. On the other hand, if Intervention 1 is to decrease 
13 
TcCO 2 by 5 mm Hg (from baseline at time of capi[INVESTIGATOR_21274]) and maintain at that level (by 
[CONTACT_21307]) for 24h, and Intervention 2 will be to increase TcCO 2 by 5 mm 
Hg back to initial values (by [CONTACT_21309]) for the next 24h. Intervention 3 
will be to repeat Intervention 1. These interventio ns are chosen so that we will be able to 
evaluate the effects of altering PaCO 2 on respi[INVESTIGATOR_21275] 7.2, generally regarded as a safe threshold. At the conclusion of interventions and data collection, infants will be managed according to the Clinician’s preference.  
 
Aim 3:  
For infants on oxygen supplementation at 32w PMA, we will use the data from the 96 hours 
of intensive multiparametric physiologic monitoring at 32w PMA. For infants on oxygen supplementation at 36w PMA, we will use the 96 hours of intensive multiparametric physiologic 
monitoring at 36w PMA as well as data from the sleep study  
(b) The first 24h of the data collection will be the baseline data. Over the next 72h, we will 
evaluate 3 interventions in a cross -over manner: Intervention 1 (24 -48h of data), Intervention 2 
(48-72h), and Intervention 3 (72 -96h). Initial intervention will be by [CONTACT_21310] 
(computer -generated). For example, Intervention 1 may be to switch the infant to the servo -
controlle d O
2 environment at a range necessary to maintain the optimal SpO 2 (91-95%). As this 
may not be the same FiO 2 as that by [CONTACT_21311], we will calculate the effective hypopharyngeal 
FiO 2 using formulae incorporating FiO 2, cannula flow, and minute ventilation ( 24-27) and adjust 
from this FiO 2. The first 12h will be for identifying the appropriate FiO [ADDRESS_20196] 24h 
(unless the FiO 2 or clinical status had markedly changed in the previous 24h and adjustments 
are necessary), with analysis of data in the second 12h after stabilization. Intervention 3 will be 
switching back to the servo -controlled O 2 environment for 24h. Similarly, for infants for whom 
Intervention 1 is switching to a cannula, Intervention 2 will be back to the O 2 environment, and 
Intervention 3 back to the cannula. At the conclusion of interventions and data collection, infants will be managed according to the Clinician’s preference.  
 
 
4.2.5. Blinding/Masking  
 
This is an unmasked study.  
 
4.2.6. Control or M onitoring of Co- interventions  
 Medical interventions and ventilator management will be based upon clinician discretion. Evidence and consensus based guidelines are followed for uniformity in practice. No changes in management are required for this observational cohort study, except for the duration of the intensive multiparametric monitoring for 96 hours at 2 weeks postnatal age, 32 weeks PMA, and 36 weeks PMA, when interventions will be performed as described in Aims 2 (minor changes in TcCO2) or Aim 3 (Nasal cannula or Servo -controlled O2 environment).  
4.2.7. Primary Outcome

Infants will be monitored for severe apnea/bradycardia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (defined as requiring bag and mask ventilation for >[ADDRESS_20197] compression) associated with interventions in Aims 2 and 3.  No such 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_21277].  
 
4.2.10. Compliance Monitoring  
 No specific protocol exists for Aim 1 (observational study). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_21278]/stop or personally supervise the interventions in Aims [ADDRESS_20198] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21279] -up and instructions for follow -up at 3 months will be sent to parents/caregivers.  
 
4.2.13. Follow -up at 3 Months  
 Survivors to discharge will be followed- up at the 3 month follow -up visit for a sleep study 
(polysomnographic study)  at the Children’s of Alabama sleep center by [CONTACT_21313]. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_21280] (30) will be evaluated at the [ADDRESS_20199] infants enrolled in this study are eligible for follow -up by [CONTACT_21314] -Up clinic, and some are also eligible for follow -up by [CONTACT_21315] -
up clinic.   
4.3. POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS TO SUBJ ECTS  
 Potential Risks:  
15 
This study is primarily an observational study (Aim 1), and comparative effectiveness research 
(Aims 2 and 3), and is hence of low risk. Infants enrolled in this study are intrinsically at high risk, as they 
are born extremely preterm with a risk of death exceeding 20% and death or disability exceeding 50%, but participation in this study adds only minimally to the underlying risk.  
For Aim 1, we will collect physiologic data from patient monitors, and clinical data on patient 
charact eristics, illness severity, and outcomes from the medical records of the  [ADDRESS_20200] access to patient data before anonymization. No patient identifiers will therefore remain in the data set that will be transmitted to the Data Coordinating Cente r.  
For Aim 2, we will enroll a subset of infants from Aim 1 to determine if mild permissive 
hypercapnia (trying to increase blood carbon dioxide concentrations 5 mm Hg from baseline) leads to improved control of breathing in preterm infants. While extreme  hypercapnia associated with pH <7.15 
is generally avoided, mild hypercapnia with pH maintained >7.[ADDRESS_20201] centers, including UAB, and is considered safe. These infants will be monitored using continuous pulse oximetry 
and transcutaneou s CO
2 monitoring, and the fluctuations in blood carbon dioxide concentrations of 5 
mm Hg from baseline are expected to alter blood pH by [CONTACT_21316] 0.05, and these fluctuations are much 
less than normally noted in routine care (fluctuations of up to 30 mm Hg or more over a day are often seen). We will not include infants with extreme blood carbon dioxide concentrations (blood PCO
[ADDRESS_20202] recent blood gas analysis). This Aim is intent -to-treat, and it is 
possible that we will not see any statistical differences over time with regards to blood carbon dioxide concentrations despi[INVESTIGATOR_21281]  [ADDRESS_20203] and other clinical variables. Even more extreme transient elevations of blood carbon dioxide at 2 weeks of age are unlikely to cause 
clinical problems  as the risk period of IVH (the main concern with elevated blood carbon dioxide in 
preterm infants) is mainly in the first few days after birth. Hypocapnia or very low blood carbon dioxide 
concentrations may reduce brain blood flow, but we are evaluating infants with levels in the upper end of the normocapnia range or mild permissive hypercapnia, and excluding infants with more extreme values. Infants with hypocapnia generally have spontaneous hyperventilation rather than due to clinician intervention, as the goal is minimal ventilation and not overventilation.   
For Aim 3, we will evaluate the effects of oxygen administration using a servo -controlled oxygen 
environment as compared to nasal cannula on control of breathing and stability of blood oxygen levels . 
Both methods are in common use in our NICU, and are not known to have any major risks. Minor risks of using a nasal cannula include accidental dislodgement with movement of the infant. Minor risks of 
oxygen environment include a drop in oxygen concentrat ion if caregivers leave port -holes open for too 
long by [CONTACT_21317], allowing the oxygen to exit the incubator. However, as infants are being carefully 
monitored using continuous pulse oximetry and ECG monitoring, any desaturation or bradycardia epi[INVESTIGATOR_21282].  
We also plan to develop a biorepository using remnant samples, as required by [CONTACT_21318] (no invasive sampling will be done specifically for this study).  
There is no financial risk from participation in this study.  
A potential risk is of psychological harm to parents during the informed consent process, as they 
become aware of the high risk of death or handicap to their very preterm infant. However, this risk is the same, whether or not t he parents are in the study, as they all receive counseling regardless of being 
in this or other studies.  
Risk:                  Frequency            Severity                 Reversibility  
1. Loss of confidentiality and privacy         Very low (anonymized data)   Low      Not applicable  
16 
2. Mild increases or decreases in PCO2   Common (happens often routinely)   Low     Reversible  
3.  Nasal cannula dislodgement          Common (happens often routinely) Low   Reversible  
4. Oxygen environment open to air       Common (happens often routinely)   Low   Reversible  
5. Psychological harm to parents             Common (all parents at risk)       Low      Not applicable  
This study is an observational study (Aim 1) and comparative effectiveness study (Aims 2 and 3), and the 
risks  that the infants are exposed to are those that are normally present and happen often in usual 
neonatal intensive care. As this study involves more intensive monitoring than usual, the expectation is that these infants will be at even lower risk as compare d to infants who are monitored only using 
standard equipment. The minor risks in Aims 2 and 3 occur frequently in infants during usual intensive care, and are likely to be unchanged in this study compared to usual care, but harm may occur if nursing 
staff do not respond to monitoring alarms (as in usual care). The more intensive monitoring may help 
reduce these risks.  
 
Potential benefits:  
 There is a potential of direct benefit to study participants from participating as Aim [ADDRESS_20204] to follow -up.  
Primary Outcome:   
Hypoxemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (SpO2 <85% for > 10s) frequency  
Secondary Outcome(s)  
Frequency of Hypoxemia (SpO 2<85%), Bradycardia (HR<100/min), Bradycardia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (HR<100/min for 
>10s); Apnea (RR=0 for >20s, or RR=0 for >10s + SpO2 <85% or HR<100/min); BPD defined using 
physiologic definition at 36w PMA  
Aim 1: Statistical calculations will be performed using SPSS. Parametric tests will be used for analyses of 
all continuous variables except for comparisons involving the incidences of specified ranges of IBIs, 
which is a skew distribution. Nonparametric tests will also be used for analyses of ordinal datasets. The 
Kolmogorov- Smirnov (one -sample) and Friedman's and Wilcoxon signed -rank tests will be used for the 
nonparametric analyses. For factorial analyses of parametric data, separate repeated -measures ANOVAs 
will be used. For factors with more than two levels, the Greenhouse -Geisser correction will be used, and 
ε with unadjusted degrees of freedom will be reported. Where a main effect was observed for factors 
with more than two levels, post hoc tests using the Bo nferroni adjustment will be done. Values will be 
expressed as means and SD, and  p values (2 -tailed) of <0.[ADDRESS_20205] -moment correlation coefficient analysis will be used to establish the association between 
pathological pauses in breathing and breathing stability.  
Aims 2 and 3: As in Aim 1, we will quantify IBI and IBI variability as defined earlier ( 2, 4). Also as in Aim 1, 
other outcomes will include (i) hypoxemic time – the % time with SpO 2 <90%, (ii) moderate hypoxemic 
time with SpO 2 <80% and severe hypoxemic time with SpO 2 <60% (iii) bradycardic time – % time with HR 
<100, (iv) severe bradycardic time – % time with HR <60, (iv) hypoxemic, bradycardic, or apneic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] 
– the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_21283] 2 <90%, SpO 2 <80%,  SpO 2 <60%,  HR<100, HR<60, or RR=0, 
respectively, for >10 seconds, with the epi[INVESTIGATOR_21284], (v) cerebral hypoxemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (decrease in r cSO 2 <50% or of 20%  from baseline 
for >1 minute) and somatic hypoxemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (decrease of 20% from baseline in peri- renal area).  
 
5.2. SAMPLE SIZE AND POWER ESTIMATE S 
 
Aim 1:  A sample size of [ADDRESS_20206] a 20% change in a parameter related 
to an outcome using standard parametric or nonparametric tests (e.g. Wilcoxon signed -rank) at 80% 
power, α=0.05, with expected standard deviation of change of 50%. We plan to enroll 120 to account for  
attrition due to early death. Statistical power of 80% for detecting 20% difference in parameters is 
maintained even if the incidence of outcome (e.g. BPD) is only 20% of enrolled (24 of 120) infants if the 
standard deviation is 40% or less (as is expected to be, based on preliminary studies).  
Aim 2:  A sample size of [ADDRESS_20207] a 30% change in a parameter related to an 
outcome using standard parametric (e.g. paired t -test) or nonparametric tests at 80% power, α=0.05, 
with expected standard deviation of change of 40%. Hence, enrollment of 25 patients will be sufficient, even if there is attrition of up to 5 patients  due to death, and data from 4 patients has technical issues 
with usability . 
18 
Aim 3:  As in Aim 2, [ADDRESS_20208] a 30% change in a parameter related to an 
outcome by [CONTACT_21319] (e.g. paired t -test) or nonparametric tests at 80% power, α=0.05, with 
expected standard deviation of 40%. Hence, enrollment of [ADDRESS_20209] an estimated available population of 200 extremely preterm infants each year admitted to the RNICU. The limitation of sample size to 120 is due to costs associated with study (NIRS sensors, sleep studies) rather than with limitation in the number of available infants.  
5.4. PROJECTED R ECRUITMENT TIME 
 We plan to enroll at least 40 infants per year during years 2 -4 of the study (120 in total), with additional 
enrollment possible in early Year 5. As infants will require a sleep study [ADDRESS_20210].

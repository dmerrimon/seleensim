Protocol #771-0006, Rev. J TriVascular Proprietary Information Page 10 of 65 2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are the mo st commonly encounter ed aneurysm of the 
arterial system.  Several factor s are thought to contribu te to the development of AAA’s such as: 
advanced age, gender, previous family history of AAA, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
hypertension, smoking, connective tissue disorders and atherosclerotic disease.  Males are 
affected by [CONTACT_423239].   
The presentation of a AAA usually depends upon whether complications or symptoms have 
occurred.  Many asymptomatic patients are di agnosed with a AAA upon r outine examination by 
a physician for another problem or  as a result of increased patient awareness through public 
screening programs.  Symptoms such as acute onset  of abdominal, back, or flank pain are a result 
of expansion of the aneurysm.  Such symptoms can be an indication of  impending rupture which 
may follow at a time that is unpred ictable.  Rupture of a AAA is a life-threatening clinical event 
necessitating emergent interventi on.  Many patients with a ruptur ed AAA die before reaching the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Of the patients that  do reach the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], about ha lf of those patients survive.  
Fortunately, the rate of detecting and diagnosin g AAA has increased in recent years.  Improved 
imaging techniques and public screening programs for the aging population have contributed to 
this increase1.  
The overall objective in treating AAA is to preven t rupture and subsequent death.  The natural 
history of untreated AAA is to progressively enlarge and consequently rupt ure.  Although it is 
difficult to predict, it is genera lly accepted that the greater the diameter of a AAA, the greater the 
risk of rupture.  According to a study of 300 patients over a 6-year time period, Guirguis et al2  
determined that the risk of rupture of abdomina l aortic aneurysms with a diameter less than 5.0 
cm is significantly lower than the risk of rupture of AAA’s with a diameter  of 5.0 cm or more.  
More recently, Brewster et al3 reported in 2003 the risk of r upture for females having a 5 cm 
diameter AAA is equivalent  to that of a male ha ving a 6 cm diameter AAA. 
2.1 Conventional Treatment of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm 
The current (standard) treatments for abdominal aortic aneurysms includ e “watchful waiting,” 
surgical repair of the aorta using a fabric substitute, and endovascular repair of the aorta. 
2.1.[ADDRESS_534662] or 
MRI scan every 6 months to assess changes in  the size or shape of the aneurysm.  This 
method is usually used for aneurysms that are smaller than about 5 cm in diameter. 
If the AAA is large, grows quickly, or is causi ng symptoms, it will require prompt treatment 
to prevent rupture.  The active treatments fo r AAA are open surgical aneurysm repair and 
endovascular stent graft repair. 
2.1.2  Open Surgical Repair 
Until the early 1990’s, open surgical repair was the only standard treatment for AAA.  
Significant inherent mortality and morbidity risk s are associated with open surgical repair 
due to the invasive nature of this surgery.  The standard surg ical procedure involves resection 
of the diseased segment of the aorta and replac ement with a synthetic graft.  This surgical 
technique necessitates general anesthesia, aortic cros s-clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and significant blood loss 
with associated transfusions.   
Improvements in mortality and morbidity rates fo r open surgical repair have been noted in 
the last several decades4.  The rate of early operative mortal ity for open surgical repair varies 
TriVascular, Inc. Ovation™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
 
Protocol #771-0006, Rev. J TriVascular Proprietary Information Page 11 of 65 greatly, (between 3-6 %) throughout the published litera ture.  In a prior FDA Health 
Notification, the repor ted range for early mortality rate s in population-based series for 
elective open surgical repair was between 3-5% at 30 days1.  In a literature review study 
conducted in 2001 by [CONTACT_423240]5, the mortality rate for elective su rgical repair was noted to be 
approximately 5%, and approximately 50% for emergent surgical repair.  In a recent multi-
center AAA clinical tr ial evaluation of open versus endova scular treatment conducted by W. 
L. Gore & Associates, Matusmura6 reports the rates of major adverse events were 
significantly lower in the endovasc ular group (14%) than those in  the control group (57%).  
Patients in the endovascular treatment group expe rienced less blood loss,  a reduction in need 
for transfusions and a shorte r length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. 
Significant mortality and morbidity  have been associated with the surgical repair of AAAs, 
particularly in elderly patients with multip le comorbid medical conditions.  Surgical 
complications have mainly been associated with  the surgical incision, patient co-morbidities, 
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476], and anticoagulation.  Postoperative complications have included 
bleeding, renal insufficiency, paraplegia, stro ke, and the need for prolonged ventilatory 
support.  The literature demonstrates mortality  rates for elective surgery to be 0–6.1%, with 
2.7% as the average.  The following outlines  morbidities associ ated with elective 
conventional surgery. 
Complication Range Average*

heart failure, and new cardiac arrhythmias) 0.8 – 21% 12%

2.1.3  Endovascular Stent Graft Repair 
Since the early 1990’s, endovascular abdominal aortic repair (EVAR) has evolved as an 
alternative treatment for AAA.  In [ADDRESS_534663] been deve loped, improved upon, clinically tested, and 
approved by [CONTACT_240993].  The availability of this less invasive technique has 
TriVascular, Inc. Ovation™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
 
Protocol #771-0006, Rev. J TriVascular Proprietary Information Page [ADDRESS_534664] been 
developed, clinically tested, and approved for use.  At the present time, there are 
approximately five (Excluder, Zenith, Powerlink, Talent, AneuRx) devices approved for use 
in the [LOCATION_002], six to eight devices appr oved for use in Europe, and several devices 
approved for use in Australia.  The follo wing outlines morbidities associated with 
endovascular repair.  
Complication Range Average* 
All Cardiac (includes myocar dial infarction, congestive 
heart failure, and new cardiac arrhythmias) 0 – 12% 4.9% 
Pulmonary (includes pneumonia and pulmonary 
insufficiency, does not include atelectasis) 0 – 7.7% 2.6% 
Renal Failure (chronic and acute) 0 – 6.5% 3.0% 
Cerebrovascular Accident  0 – 2.8% 0.3% 
Paraplegia or Paraparesis 0 – 0.2% <0.1%

TriVascular, Inc. Ovation™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
 
Protocol #771-0006, Rev. J TriVascular Proprietary Information Page 13 of 65 The literature demonstrates mortality rates for endovascular repair to be 0–7.5%, with 3.4% 
as the average.  This rate is inflated, to some extent, by [CONTACT_941] u tilization of endovascular repair 
in patients who are not candidates for surgic al repair because of co–morbidities that 
dramatically increase the risk associated with  the surgical procedure.  For the systemic 
morbidities (cardiac, pulmonary, renal, cerebrovascular, and gastrointestinal), the rates for 
endovascular repair appear to be lower than for surgical repair.  The statistical significance of 
this observation, however, has not been assessed. 
During the clinical evaluation of the AneuRx St ent Graft System for AAA repair, patients in 
the endovascular repair group ha d lower blood loss, fewer days in the ICU, and a shorter 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423197].  The difference for 
each of these measures was statistically signific ant.  Similarly, the clinical evaluation of the 
ANCURE System demonstrated that the endovascular repair group experienced a statistically 
significant lower blood loss and a shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423198].

Protocol #771-0006, Rev. J TriVascular Proprietary Information Page 15 of 65 4.0 DEVICE DESCRIPTION 
The TriVascular Ovation™ Abdominal Stent Graft System is  a low-profile endovascular device 
delivered via catheter to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).   The stent graft is designed to 
reline the diseased vasculature, providing an alternate endovascular blood conduit for isolating 
the aneurysm from the high pressure flow of bl ood, thereby [CONTACT_423241].  The stent graft is a modular configuration comprised of  an aortic body section, iliac 
limbs, and iliac extensions as required (Figure 1).    The aortic section is compri sed of a proximal stent for s upra-renal fixation and a low-
permeability PTFE graft.  The stent is designed with small anchors to enable fixation to the aortic wall.  For delivery, the stents are in a co mpressed state within the ca theter.  When released 
from the compressed state, the stent expands to engage the vessel wall.  The nitinol stents are radiopaque and the implant contains radiopaque markers adjacent to the graft edges.  These 
markers serve as positioning aids during placeme nt of the device and allow the stent to be 
located so that it will not obstruct the renal arteri es.  To seal the proximal end of the graft and to 
provide support into which the iliac limbs ar e deployed, the graft body contains a network of 
inflatable rings that are filled with a liquid polymer which solidifies during the deployment procedure.  The graft has a fill port that connects the fill networ k of the graft to the delivery 
catheter.    The iliac limbs and extensions are comprised of n itinol stents encapsulated in PTFE.  The limbs 
are deployed into the limb section of the aortic  body.  Radiopaque markers allow the physician to 
visualize the appropriate iliac limb - aortic body overlap or ili ac extension – iliac limb overlap 
during a catheter-based deployment.  Stent radial  force provides both fixation and sealing of the 
interface between the aortic body and each iliac limb, between the i liac limb and iliac extension, 
and between the iliac limb/extension and its landing zone in the iliac artery. 
 
 
Figure 1. Schematic of Deployed Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft  System 
 
To facilitate device introduction into the access vessel, th e aortic body, the iliac limbs and the 
iliac extensions are preloaded into low-profile delivery cath eters (14F-15F OD, 13F–15F OD, 
and 13F-14F OD respectively; Figures 2 and 3).  The aortic body is deploye d via the aortic body 
delivery catheter.  The aortic body delivery cathete r has a lumen that allows for the use of a 
guidewire to help deliver the sten t graft to the deployment site.   
 During stent graft deployment, the device is positioned and the shea th is retracted.  The proximal 
stent is then deployed using release knobs on the handle.  The fill polymer is then delivered through the fill connector port using an auto injector (supplied).

The fill polymer is comprised of three components and is supplied in kit form as shown in Figure 
4.  Upon mixing and injection into the graft, the components form a robust radiopaque polymer 
network that is durable in vivo .  Once inside the PTFE  channels in the wa ll of the aortic body 
graft, the fill polymer forms conformable “gasket-like” sealing rings.  The fill polymer 
radiopacity dissipates over time and may not be visible on fluoroscopy beyond 1-[ADDRESS_534666]-
implant.

disconnected from the connection tube, slipped out of the syringe  support and co nnected to the 
fill polymer injection port on the catheter handle.  The syringe plunger is then inserted into the 
autoinjector (Figure 5) and the syringe given a quar ter-turn to lock it in place.  The autoinjector 
applies controlled pressure to in ject the fill polymer into the graft without requiring continuous 
attention from the operator.

8.9 Adverse Events 
An adverse event is any new, undesirable medical  occurrence or change (worsening) of a pre-
existing condition that occurs in a subject, whether or not considered to be associated with the 
product.  Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31643]-existi ng conditions (e.g., elective cosmetic procedures) 
are not adverse events.   
 Requirements for reporting AEs are dependent upon the reviewing IRB policy. Adverse events 
will be reviewed by a Clinical Events Committ ee (CEC).  The CEC will meet periodically, a 
minimum of annually.  Adverse Event information is recorded in the Adverse Event eCRF . 
For purposes of this study, the following events ar e not considered adverse events, because they 
are expected to occur in conjunc tion with the index procedure or are associated with customary, 
standard care of subjects undergoing endovascular AAA repair procedures: 
 Early post-operative pain (within 24 hours of index procedure) at the access site 
and/or related to position on procedure table 
TriVascular, Inc. Ovation™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
 
Protocol #771-0006, Rev. J TriVascular Proprietary Information Page 27 of 65  Post-anesthesia/conscious sedation emesis, nausea, or headache (within 24 hours of 
index procedure) 
 Electrolyte imbalance without clinical seque lae following index procedure, even if 
requiring correction 
 Low grade temperature increase (< 101.0 °F) 
 Hematocrit decrease from baseline of less th an 6 points (2 grams of hemoglobin) that 
remains above 30% and is not associated  with hemodynamic changes and does not 
require transfusion 
 Blood loss not requiring transfusion and not resulting in decreased hematocrit. 
 Minor, localized tenderness, swelling, induration, bruising, erythema, hematoma etc. 
at vascular access site that does not requi re surgical intervention, evacuation, 
transfusion, or antibiotics 
 Prophylactic administration of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
 Prophylactic pacing 
 Isolated, non-sustained PVCs/PACs 
 Non-sustained, arrhythmia not re quiring treatment or intervention 
 Hypotension or hypertension not requ iring treatment or intervention 
 Atelectasis not requiring treatment 
 
The Investigator and/or IRB may require that these events are reported as adverse events.  In this 
case, the Investigator should report these observations based on their medical judgment and 
requirements of the IRB.  
Device-related adverse events should be rep orted to the sponsor within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event.

Protocol #771-0006, Rev. J TriVascular Proprietary Information Page 32 of 65 10.0  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
10.1 Primary Endpoints and Hypotheses 
10.1.1  Primary Safety Endpoint and Hypothesis: Major Adverse Event Rates 
This study is designed to compare the rate of major adverse events following abdominal 
aortic aneurysm repair with the Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft System to a target 
performance goal.  The proporti on of subjects receiving the Ov ation Abdominal Stent Graft 
who experience one or more events meeting the definition of a major adverse event within [ADDRESS_534695].   The nu ll and alternative hypotheses are 
given below: 
 
H0: π T ≥ 21%   
 
H1: π T  <  21%  , where 
πT is the expected proportion of subjects undergoing AAA repair with the Ovation 
Abdominal Stent Graft System who experience a major adverse event at 30 days. The target 
performance goal rate of 21% is that based on the 11% rate (plu s 10% ”non-inferiority” 
margin) of major adverse events at 30 days  reported for the Medtronic Talent device 
(reported in the Medtronic Talent Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Data 2008). 
 
10.1.2  Primary Effectiveness Endpoint and Hy pothesis:  Treatment Success at [ADDRESS_534696].  The null and 
alternative hypotheses are as follows: 
 
H0: π  ≤ 80%   
 
H1: π  >80%, where 
 
π is the expected rate of treatment success.  The Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft is 
considered to be effective if this study’s result verifies that the lower limit of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for π  is above 80%. 
10.2 Statistical Sample Size Justifications for the Primary Study Phase  
Should the rate of major adverse events be 11%, n=150 primary study subjects would provide 
96% power to test the primary safety hypothesi s at the one-sided 5%  significance level. 
 
It is anticipated that attriti on through the 12 month visit may be  approximately 15%.  Hence 150 
primary study subjects less 15% attrition would yield approximately 130 subjects with data 
available to assess the primary effectiveness endpoint at 12 m onths. Should the rate for the 
primary effectiveness composite endpoint e qual 88.2%, then 130 subjec ts would provide 80% 
power to test the primary effec tiveness hypothesis at the one-sided 0.05 alpha level. Sample size 
calculations were performed using the nor mal approximation in nQuery Advisor 6.02.

Protocol #771-0006, Rev. J TriVascular Proprietary Information Page 33 of 65 10.3  Statistical Methods for Primary Endpoints 
10.3.1  Primary Safety Endpoint: Major Adverse Events: 
Let n be the sample size and z 1-α denote the upper (1- α) quantile of the standard normal 
distribution.  If the upper limit of  the one-sided confidence interval  for the true rate of Major 
Adverse Events is less than 21%, then the null hypothesis for safety will be rejected in favor 
of the alternative hypothesis.  Therefore, the primary safe ty endpoint will be considered met 
if the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval  for the measured value is less than the 
performance goal (21%), based on the major adverse event rate.  An accurate estimate of the 
upper limit of a binomial proportion is presen ted by [CONTACT_423255] (Agresti 1998).1 The 
Agresti-Coull upper limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval for the true rate of major 
adverse events is estimated by [CONTACT_46974] 1, where 
 
Formula 1:

 p is the observed rate of Major Adverse Events and Z
u is the upper u-th 
percentile of the standard normal distribution. Hence Z .05 = 1.645.  
 
10.3.2  Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Treatment Success 
Let n be the sample size and z 1-α denote the upper (1- α) quantile of the standard normal 
distribution.  If the lower limit of the one-sided confidence interval for the true rate for 
treatment success is greater than 80%, then the null hypothesis defined in Section 10.1.2 will 
be rejected in favor of the a lternative hypothesis.  Using the sa me approach to calculate the 
confidence interval as used for the primary safety endpoint, the corresponding formula for 
the lower limit of the confidence interval is: 
 
Formula 2: 
 
) ( 2) 1 ( 4 ) 2 (
[ADDRESS_534697]+− + − +=    , where 
 
p is the observed rate of treatment success and Z u is the upper u-th percentile of the standard 
normal distribution. Hence Z .05 = 1.645.   
10.4 Secondary Statistical Endpoints 
No hypothesis testing will be performed for secondary endpoints. 
 10.4.1  Secondary Safety Endpoints 
Rates for all-cause mortality, AAA related mortality, major adverse events, AAA rupture, 
and surgical conversion will all be calculated at 30 days and 12 months .  The Kaplan-Meier

Protocol #771-0006, Rev. J TriVascular Proprietary Information Page [ADDRESS_534702].  The mortality risk of open surgical repair of an AAA is greater for those 
subjects with significant surgical risk factors, such as age and comorbidities (e.g., cardiac, renal 
and pulmonary).[ADDRESS_534703] ors related to morbidities, reduced time for 
anesthesia, need for blood products, shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423212], as well as 
improved quality of life in the early postoperative period.   
 Risks to subjects are minimized initially by [CONTACT_423256]/institutions 
with endovascular experience to participate in the study.  In order for patients to participate in this study, they must agree to adhere to a stri ct follow-up schedule to co ntinuously monitor their 
long term safety.   The risks associated with the use of this study device are no t currently known.  Although the 
adverse events associated with the use of the Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft System may be less than for standard open surgical repair, inherent risks exist, as with ma ny medical procedures.  
However, risks that have been associated with repa ir of AAAs with this type of device in clinical 
trials or that are currently marketed include, but may not be limited to: 
•
 Cardiac events such as congestive heart failure (CHF), vol ume overload, arrhythmias, 
myocardial infarction (MI), chest discomfo rt or angina, eleva tions in creatinine 
phosphokinase (CPK), hypotension 
• Pulmonary events such as pulmonary insufficiency, pneumonia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_423213], pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism 
• Cerebral events such as cerebrovascular  accident (hemorrhagic or embolic), 
reversible ischemic neurologic deficit, transient ischemic attacks (TIA) 
• Acute and chronic renal insufficiency or failure, renal microembolism 
• Operative and post–operative bleeding disorders, hemorrhage and coagulopathy 
• Insertion and other vascular access site comp lications such as infection, bleeding, 
delayed healing, hematoma, dehiscence, seroma, nerve injury/damage, neuropathy, neuralgia, vasovagal response 
•
 Vascular injury including damage to bl ood vessels and surrounding tissues, vessel 
dissection, perforation, pla que dissection, collateral vessel occlusion, tissue loss, 
arterial fistula, limb loss, gangrenous dis ease, worsened or new onset claudication, 
edema 
• Neurological complications, such as paralysi s (temporary or permanent),  paraplegia, 
monoplegia, paresis, spi[INVESTIGATOR_334367], hemiplegia, bowel or bladder incontinence 
• Multi-system organ failure 
• Embolic and thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis , thromboembolism, 
microembolism, thrombophlebitis, phlebothrombosis, pulmonary embolism, air 
embolism 
• Gastrointestinal events such as ischemia, paralytic or adynamic ileus, obstruction, 
fistulas

 Potential benefits of the Ova tion Abdominal Stent Graft System  compared to open surgical 
aneurysm repair may include, but are not limited to: 
 Not having open surgery; 
 Less time under general anesthesia  and/or the ability to use other forms of anesthesia that 
do not require mechan ical ventilation; 
 Reduction of complications; and 
 Reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423214]. 
 Potential benefits of the Ovati on Abdominal Stent Graft System co mpared to other commercially 
available endovascular AAA re pair devices may include, but are not limited to: 
 More robust seal between the graf t and aorta, possibly  reducing the risk that the graft will 
develop Type I or III endoleak s or migrate over time and; 
 Lower risk of injury to the access vessels due to the low profile and mo re flexible delivery 
system compared to the comm ercially available devices.

American Society of Anesthesiologists Classification System 
 
The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA ) presents a graded scale assessing a patient’s 
risk of undergoing anesthesia.  Th e scale represents the significan ce of the patient’s underlying 
illnesses prior to anesthesia. 
 The following provides a description of the four grades of the ASA scale: 
 
ASA I 
Healthy individual without any systemic disease , undergoing elective surgery.  Patient not at 
extremes of age.  (Note: Age is sometimes ignored as a ffecting operative risk ; however, patients 
at either extreme of age are though t to represent increased risk.)  Some examples are a fit man 
with an inguinal hernia, and a fibroid uterus in an otherwise healthy woman. 
 
ASA II 
Individual with one system, well -controlled disease.  Disease does not affect daily activities.  
Other anesthetic risk factors, including mild obesity, alcoholism, and smoking can be 
incorporated here.  Examples include non-limiting or  only slightly limiting organic heart disease, 
essential hypertension, anemia, or mild diabetes.  
ASA III 
Individual with multiple system disease or well controlled major system disease .  Disease does 
limit daily activities.  No immediate danger of death from any individua l disease.  Examples 
include severe organic heart dise ase, severe diabetes with vascular complications, moderate to 
severe degrees of pulmonary insufficiency, angina or healed m yocardial infarction. 
 
ASA IV  
Individual in imminent danger of d eath.  Surgery is viewed to be last resort at salvaging life.  
Individual not expected to live through the next 24 hours.  In some cases, the individual may be 
healthy prior to catastrophic event that led to the current medical condition.  Examples include 
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm with prof ound shock, major cerebral trauma with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_423220], massive pulmonary embolus.

WHAT IS INFORMED CONSENT? 
When researchers ask for your consent, they are asking for your voluntary agreement to take part 
in a test, procedure, or clini cal research trial.  Informed consent means more than signing a 
printed consent form.  To be informed, you need to  know about benefits and risks of the clinical 
research trial and how it may a ffect you, your family, and society.  The following document is 
called a consent form and describes the clinical research trial and what your role will be as a 
study participant. 
 
This consent form may contain words that you  do not understand.  Please ask the doctor in 
charge of the study, your own doctor, or the staff involved with the clinical research trial to 
explain any words that you do not understand before signing this form.  You may also contact 
[CONTACT_423269] “Persons To Contact [CONTACT_423270]” for any questions you may have regardi ng this research study.  You will be given a 
copy of the signed consent form. 
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY 
You have been asked to consider participating in a clinical research study designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of the Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft System, an investigational device used in the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).  This study will be conducted at approximately 40 clinical sites and will enroll up to 150 subjects during the initial study phase with an additiona l 100 subjects enrolled during the continued access phase. 
 An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the ao rta (the main artery leaving the heart) caused 
by a weakening in the artery wall.  If left untreat ed, this bulge may continue to grow larger and 
ultimately rupture (break open), resulting in serious  internal bleeding.  The information collected 
TriVascular, Inc. Ovation™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
 
Protocol #771-0006, Rev. J TriVascular Proprietary Information Page 54 of 65 from this study will be used to evaluate how well patients do when treated with the Ovation 
Abdominal Stent Graft System both immediately af ter surgery and over a long period of time.  If 
you decide to participate in this study, your medical condition will be carefully monitored. 
 
Treatment of your AAA with the Ovation Abdomi nal Stent Graft System involves the placement 
of specially designed grafts (fabri c tubes) in your aorta.   The main graft looks  like a pair of pants 
with very short legs.  The top of the pants w ill be placed in your aorta.  Then, two or more 
smaller grafts are used to extend from the main graft into your iliac arteries (the main arteries supplying blood to your abdomen and legs) to form the legs of the pair of pants.  Each graft is 
enclosed in a small catheter (a long, flexible tube) th at is inserted  into your aorta through the 
femoral artery in your groin (top of  your leg).  The grafts are then placed in the correct position 
in your aorta by [CONTACT_423271].  Once the gr afts are attached inside your 
aorta, they will reinforce the area of your aorta that is w eakened and bulging from your 
aneurysm.  This procedure is called an endovas cular aneurysm repair because the grafts are 
delivered through your blood vessels.    In standard surgical aneurysm repair, the surg eon makes a large incision in your abdomen and 
actually cuts into your aorta and sews a graft in place.  There are other endovascular AAA repair 
devices that are approved for use by [CONTACT_941] F ood and Drug Administratio n (FDA) in the United 
States (U.S.).  You have the choice of having your treatment with the investigational Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft System or with any other AAA repair device which is already FDA 
approved.  You also have the choice of having your treatment with standard surgery or choosing 
to have no treatment for your aneurysm.  
EXPLANATION OF PROCEDURES 
In preparation for this research study, you will  have a physical examina tion by [CONTACT_39635], 
an evaluation of your medical hi story and any risk factors, and a check of the blood pressures in 
your arms and legs.  You will also have appr oximately 2 tablespoons, or  30 milliliters, of blood 
drawn from a vein using a needle, so that tests of your kidney function and your body’s blood-clotting abilities can be performed.  If you are a female with child bearing potential, you will also 
have a blood pregnancy test perf ormed to make sure you are not pregnant. Since your doctor has 
already diagnosed your aneurysm, you may have al ready had a special x-ray, called a CT scan.  
If you have not had a CT scan, or if the CT s can information is not detailed enough to let your 
doctor evaluate your aneurysm, you will be required  to have a CT scan. These same tests would 
be done if you were scheduled to undergo standard  surgery to repair your  aneurysm or if you 
were going to have an endovascular  AAA repair using another device. 
 As the procedure begins, you will receive a drug in your hand or arm to help sedate you, or you 
might receive general anesthesia depending upon your particular circumstance.  Your surgeon 
will clean your skin and shave hair around the pl ace where the device will be inserted through a 
catheter (flexible tube) into your body.  Your surgeon will then make an incision (cut) into the 
skin in order to get access to the femoral artery in your groin (top of leg). Your surgeon will then 
thread a very thin wire into your artery to guide it to the aneurysm. Because you have no nerve 
endings inside your arteries, you will not feel th e wires or catheters as they move through your 
body. You may feel a slight pressure or a sens ation of mild tugging during this part of the 
procedure.

approximately 2 tablespoons, or 30 mill imeters, of blood to be drawn.  
FOLLOW-UP EVALUATIONS 
If you decide to participate in this research study, you will be required to return to your doctor 
for follow-up evaluations at one (1) month, six (6) months, and twelve (12 months) after the procedure, as well as every year thereafter  until five (5) years after the procedure. 
 At each of the follow-up visits, you will have  a physical exam, CT scan, X-Ray of your 
abdomen, and blood tests that will require approximately [ADDRESS_534717].  The procedure with a commercially 
available endovascular AAA repair device is very similar to  the procedure with the Ovation 
Abdominal Stent Graft System, by [CONTACT_423272] (femoral) arteries. 
RISKS 
The risks associated with the use of this study device are no t currently known.  Although the 
adverse events associated with the use of the Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft may be less than for standard open surgical repair, inherent ri sks exist, as with many medical procedures.  
However, risks that have been associated with repa ir of AAAs with this type of device in clinical 
trials or that are currently marketed include, but may not be limited to: 
 hematoma (deep bruise) or lymphatic problems (i nfection) at the access sites in the groin;  
 damage to the iliac or femoral ar teries during devi ce deployment;  
TriVascular, Inc. Ovation™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
 
Protocol #771-0006, Rev. J TriVascular Proprietary Information Page 56 of 65  fracture of the metallic components of the implant; 
 endoleak (leakage of blood around the graft in to the aneurysm sac a nd/or blood flow into 
the aneurysm sac from vessels  connected to the aorta); 
 continued enlargemen t of your aneurysm; 
 failure to deploy the graft resulting in the need to stop th e procedure and/ or convert to 
open surgical repair; 
 twisting of the implanted graft; 
 migration of the some or all of the device parts; 
 separation of im plant parts; 
 aortic occlusion (blockage or the blood flow in your aorta) from blood clots;  
 kinking or twisting of the graft and iliac artery occlusion (blockage of blood flow in the 
blood vessels that supply blood to  your legs) from blood clots,  kinking or twisting of the 
legs of the graft; and 
 allergic reaction to the device fi ll material, if injected into the bloodstream, as well as 
device materials. 
 
Complications common to all pa tients undergoing standard su rgical aneurysm repair or 
endovascular repair include, but  may not be limited to:  
 allergic reaction to x-ray contrast dye; 
 procedural bleeding; 
 post-procedure bleeding;  
 hematoma (deep bruise);  
 bleeding disorders;  
 respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399];  
 pneumonia;  
 pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lung);  
 myocardial infarction;  
 congestive hear t failure;  
 irregular heart beat requiring therapy;  
 kidney failure; w ound infection;  
 bowel complications such as pa ralysis of the bowel; blockage of the bowel; or decreased 
blood flow to the bowel tissue; 
 mild or severe blockage of blood flow to your legs or arms due to blood clots or damage 
to the blood vessels;  
 amputation;  
 stroke;  
TriVascular, Inc. Ovation™ Abdominal Stent Graft System  
 
Protocol #771-0006, Rev. J TriVascular Proprietary Information Page 57 of 65  impotence;  
 blood clots or infection in the graft; graft dila tation (stretching);  
 development of a hole between th e aorta and the intestines or the aorta and the vena cava 
(major blood vessel carryi ng blood to the heart);  
 separation of the wall s of the aorta;  
 a false aneurysm developi[INVESTIGATOR_423225] e fixation point of the graft; 
 re-operation (a dditional surgery); and  
 death.   
Your doctor will make every effort to minimize the risks and discomforts of the procedures.  
Most of the complications and discomforts liste d above can be treated with medications or 
surgery that can be given to you if your doctor f eels it is needed.  In the event of a serious 
complication or injury, it may be necessary to surgically remove the study de vice. In that case, 
TriVascular requests that the removed study devi ce be returned to them for examination. 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS 
Potential benefits of the Ova tion Abdominal Stent Graft System  compared to open surgical 
aneurysm repair may include, but are not limited to: 
 Not having open surgery; 
 Less time under general anesthesia  and/or the ability to use other forms of anesthesia that 
do not require mechan ical ventilation; 
 Reduction of complications; and 
 Reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423214]. 
 
Potential benefits of the Ovati on Abdominal Stent Graft System co mpared to other commercially 
available endovascular AAA re pair devices may include, but are not limited to: 
 More robust seal between the graft and your aorta, possibly reducing the risk that the graft 
will develop leaks or move over time and; 
 Lower risk of injury to  the vessels in your legs because this cathe ter is smaller and more 
flexible than the commercially available devices. 
Any potential benefits cannot, however, be guaranteed. There may be no direct benefit to you from your participation in this  study, but it is hoped that th e information gained from your 
participation in this study may benefit others with a condition similar to yours.

Explant During Surgical Conversion 
The objective of device removal is to minimize tr auma or damage to the device at the time of 
surgical excision from the subject, while maintaini ng the subject’s safety.  It is also important to 
minimize surrounding tissue disturbance so that a thorough pathological ev aluation can be made. 
1. If possible, a swab should be us ed to obtain material for microbi al culture prior to removal of 
the explant. 
2. Attempt to identify all components including their orientation so that th ey may be maintained 
in the same relative position as they were in situ . 
3. Attempt to remove the specimen en bloc from superior to the proximal sten t to inferior to the 
distal stent. 
4. The residual blood should be rinsed from the explant surfaces u tilizing physiological 
solutions such as Ringer’s lactate or normal sa line avoiding disturbance to the inside surface 
of the explant. 
5. All samples should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. 
6. Prior to the explant, please contact [CONTACT_423279][INVESTIGATOR_3931]. 
7. Please alert the sponsor within  24-hours of the explant and the shipment of the device. 
8. Explant case report forms shoul d be completed at this time 
9. An operative report and a separate  report from the examining pa thologist should be sent to 
the sponsor, if available. 
 
Explant During Autopsy 
The objective of device removal is to excise en bloc from superior to the proximal stent to 
inferior to the distal stent.  The abdominal aorta and iliacs should not be opened nor should any 
endovascular device manipulation be  done.  Photos should be taken in  anterior-posterior as well 
as oblique and lateral views.  The external ch aracteristics and the re lationship to surrounding 
viscera should be noted based on the guidelines on the case report forms.  Adhesions to viscera 
as well as evidence of fistula formation by [CONTACT_423280].  Any problems or abnormalities of this type should be photographed in situ , if 
possible. 1.
 If possible, a spi[INVESTIGATOR_423232] 3-D rec onstruction should be obtained of the endograft 
prior to explantation of the device.  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_423233]. 
2. Attempt to identify all components including their orientation so that th ey may be maintained 
in the same relative position as they were in situ.  
3. Attempt to remove the specimen en bloc from superior to the proximal sten t to inferior to the 
distal stent. 
4. All samples should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. 
5. Prior to the explant, please contact [CONTACT_423279][INVESTIGATOR_3931]. 
6. Please alert the sponsor within  24-hours of the explant and the shipment of the device. 
7. An autopsy report and a separate report from th e examining pathologist should be sent to the 
sponsor, if available.

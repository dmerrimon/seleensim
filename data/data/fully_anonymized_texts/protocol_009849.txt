Protocol Title  
A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (Phase 1) Study  to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Combin ation Checkpoint Blockade 
(Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_404274]) Plus  External Beam Radiotherapy  in Subjects with Stage IV 
Melanoma  
 
Objectives and Synopsis  
This is an open -label, multicenter pi[INVESTIGATOR_42751] 1 study of the checkpoint antibodies ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871174]  (RT) in [ADDRESS_1216581] s will receive concurrent  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (3 mg/kg) and nivolumab (1 mg/kg) every 3 weeks for 4 
doses, followed by [CONTACT_53930] ( 240 mg every 2 weeks ). Note: per Amendment 5, 
nivolumab monotherapy continuing after Week [ADDRESS_1216582] been 
accrued to Cohort  A and completed  the concurrent ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871175], if ≤  [ADDRESS_1216583] s will be accrued to  Cohort B  (see exception in Section 3.1 , i.e., 
asymptomatic amylase and lipase abnormalities are not included) . Subjects in Cohort B  will receive the 
high -dose hypofractionated RT for which t reatment of a target lesion will comprise a total palliative 
dose of 27  Gy delivered over 2 weeks in 3 fractions of 9  Gy each.  
The primary objective is the assessment of safety according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Terminology Criteria for Advers e Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03. 
The secondary objectives  are to evaluate: (1) objective response rate (ORR) at Weeks 12 and 18, (2) 
disease control rate (DCR) at Weeks 12 and 18, (3) duration  of response, (4)  progression -free survival 
(PFS), and (5) overall survival (OS) . 
The exploratory objectives  are to perform correlative studies investigating the immunological effects of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871176].  
Assessment methods include  the NCI  CTCAE  (Version 4.03 ) for safety  and the modified Response 
Evaluation Criteria for Soli d Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 (primary) and  immune- related RECIST (irR ECIST; 
secondary)  for clinical efficacy .

1.1 Melanoma  
The incidence of malignant melanoma is rising and the mo rtality rate is increasing .(1) These 
concerning trends are occurring despi[INVESTIGATOR_871179]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_871180], the overall survival (OS) for all patients diagnosed 
with melanoma has improved for early stage tumors because of early detection an d improved 
surgical treatment. Nonetheless, man y patients who undergo curative -intent surgical treatment 
of high -risk disease ultimately recur, and re current and/or metastatic melanoma remains a 
largely fatal disease , with a median s urvival of 3 to 11 month s.(2) 
The only adjuvant treatment approved by [CONTACT_871228] -risk melanoma is 
IFN-α. Unfortunately , treatment with high -dose IFN -α is associated with significant side effects, 
and its ro le in pro longing survival is not clear. One study showed an OS benefit, but this was not 
confirmed in a pooled analysis with longer follow -up.(3, 4) 
Until 2011, dacarbazine and interleukin -2 (IL -2) were the only US FDA approved treat ments for 
metastatic melanoma. Dacarbazine provides an objective tumor response in only 5% to 20% of 
subjects, and these responses are short -lived (median duration of re sponse is 6 months) . 
Dacarbazine has also never been shown to improve OS .(2)  IL-2 was approved by [CONTACT_34033] 
1998 for treatment of metastatic melanoma . The FDA approval was based on data suggesting a 
16% overall objective response rate with a 6% complete response. However, toxicities of high 
dose IL -2 therapy were severe (e. g., capi[INVESTIGATOR_7946], sepsis, and hypotension), and 2% of subjects 
died from such associated adverse event s (AEs). (5)  
Since 2011, many new treatments have been approved for patients with melanoma.   For 
patients with BRAF mutations, the BRAF inhibitors dabrafenib and vemurafenib have led to dramatic results with recent demonstration of an overall survival b enefit of combining the BRAF 
inhibitor, dabrafenib with the MEK inhibitor, trametinib .(6)  Immunotherapy with immune 
checkpoint blocking antibodies has similarly led to remarkable advances in advanced melanoma with 3 currently FDA -approved drugs: Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], nivolumab, and pembrolizumab .(7-9) 
1.2 Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871181] T cell function, cytotoxic T -lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA -4) and has demonstrated a survival benefit for 
subject s with advanced melanoma in two Phase 3 trials .(10, 11)  Though ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871182] -term tumor control ,(12) unfortunately only a subset of patients benefit.  
Responses to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871183] . The unique pattern of disease response seen in subject s with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871184] a 
retrospective study an alyzing subject s treated across several Phase 2 trials .(13)  In this 
evaluation, improved survival was associated with a variety of disease response patterns such as subject s who initially appeared to have progressive disease but later achieved response and 
those who had prolonged stable disease.  
Though ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871185], a unique set of side effects, termed immune -
related adverse events (irAEs) has been seen during its clinical development . The most severe 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
SOP -C01-TMP -3 version 3  
LUD2015- 006 Protocol Amendment 5 (Final, 12-JUN-2018 ) Page 6 of 70 irAE is generally considered to be an inflammatory entero colitis which requires prompt 
treatment with steroids and, in some cases, anti -TNF-alpha therapy . Unfortunately , a 
randomized trial evaluating the role of prophylactic budesonide in decreasing the rate of 
inflammatory colitis showed no benefit to this approa ch.(14)  Other common severe side effects 
relate d to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871186], dermatitis (including toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194]), 
neuropathy, and endocrinopathy . The following clinically significant immune -mediated adverse 
reactions were seen in less than 1% of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -treated subjects in one stu dy: nephritis, 
pneumonitis, meningitis, pericarditis, uveitis, iritis, and hemolytic anemia. (7)  
1.3 Nivolumab  
Nivolumab enhances antitumor immunity by [CONTACT_871229], programmed cell death -1 (PD -1) and has demonstrated high response rates in a number of 
malignancies and improved OS  in subject s with melanoma. (15-17)  Since both ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871187], several studies are now investigating the combination of both ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45762]. Impressive early efficacy was seen with an acceptable safety profile in one Phase 1 study .(18)  Impressive efficacy has also 
been seen in phase 2 and 3 trials where the combination of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871188] t o improve response rates and progression free survival compared to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_310946] .(19, 20) 
1.4 Radiotherapy for Melanoma  
Radiotherapy (R T) is commonly used to palliate symptoms arising from sites of metastatic 
melan oma .(21)  In one study, [ADDRESS_1216593] 
56 months after RT. (22)  RT for melanoma has also been shown to improve symptoms and 
prevent impending complications from metastatic disease . One prospective study evaluated 
palliative endpoints for [ADDRESS_1216594] s with renal cell carcinoma and melanoma who underwent  
palliative RT . Improvements in two -thirds of the painful bone or soft tissue lesions were noted 
by [CONTACT_431] .(23)  
The most effective dose and schedule of RT for subject s with metastatic melanoma, however, is 
not completely clear. In a study conducted by [CONTACT_871230]., there was no difference in 
response rate betwe en subject s receiving [ADDRESS_1216595]  numbers were small. (24)  In anoth er study, Sause et al. 
reported the results of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial [ADDRESS_1216596] s with melanoma to 8  Gy per fraction delivered once weekly for 4 fractions or 2.5 Gy per 
fraction delivered 5 days per week for 20 to tal fractions .(25)  The response rates for both 
treatment arms were not statistically significantly different . These results  differed slightly from a 
retrospective analysis of [ADDRESS_1216597] s conducted at the Mayo Clini c, which indicated that  higher 
doses of RT were associated with improved palliation and improved survival. (26)  Import antly, 
dose per fraction and location of the irradiated lesions did not appear to correlate with the effectiveness of RT in this study . 
It is generally believed that high -dose palliative RT is feasible for subject s with metastatic 
melanoma,( 24) but no rigorous evaluation of dosing schemes has been tested in large, 
randomized studies . The dose and fractionation may have immunologic implications . Schaue et 
al. found that immunologic effects an d tumor control in a B16 murine melanoma model 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
SOP -C01-TMP -3 version 3  
LUD2015- 006 Protocol Amendment 5 (Final, 12-JUN-2018 ) Page 7 of 70 depended  upon dose and schedule of RT .(27)  Tumor co ntrol was most effective and 
immunologic effects were most profound when RT was delivered via 7.5  Gy per fraction . In 
another study, when RT was delivered with anti -CTLA4 therapy, synergy was not seen when a 
single fraction of 20  Gy of RT was delivered .(28)  A third preclinical study showed that 
conventionally fractionated RT abrogated the immunologic effects of RT .(29)  Many radiation 
oncologists feel that a higher dose per fraction approach may be pr eferable, thoug h prospective 
clinical evaluation of dose and schedule of RT in subject s with metastatic melanoma is 
necessary.

SOP -C01-TMP -3 version 3  
LUD2015- 006 Protocol Amendment 5 (Final, 12-JUN-2018 ) Page [ADDRESS_1216598] started combining checkpoint antibodies  with other therapeutic modalities , such as 
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and other immunotherapy. One additional , similarly promising 
approach involves combining checkpoint antibodies  with RT.  In a Phase 1/2 study in metastatic 
castration -resistant prostate cancer, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871189]. (30)  Other clinical trials exploring RT and  checkpoint 
antibodies are ongoing.  
Conceptually, all of these additional therapeutic modalities, including localized RT, could result 
in increased tumor destruction, releasing tumor antigens that provide further stimulus to T cells 
disinhibited by [CONTACT_871231] . It is also 
possible that RT may alter the tumor microenvironment and render the tumor cells more 
susceptible to immunologic -mediated disease regression.  
In preclinical models, RT has been shown to enhance antitumor immune responses through multiple mechanisms , including increased antigen present ation in tumor draining lymph nodes 
and enhanced effector cell migration to the irradiated tumor. (29, 31)  In one study, tumors that  
received RT had improved localization of inflammatory cells into the tumor microenvironment 
following adoptive cell transfer, which  was associated with upregulation of vascular cell 
adhesion molecules in the tumor microvasculature that  may have played a mechanistic role . RT 
has also been shown to increase MHC -I expression and increase the efficacy of adoptive cell 
transfer. (32) 
In addition to RT’s direct immunologic effects, preclinical evaluation has demonstrated synergy 
with other immunotherapeutic app roaches . Specifically, when RT was combined with the 
immunostimulatory cytokine, FMS -like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3), in a lung cancer model, only mice 
who received RT with Flt3 had improved survival .(33)  This survival was associated with the 
reduced development of distant pulmonary metastatic disease . A functional immune system 
appeared to be important as the effect was not seen in mice with defici ent T cells . Regression of 
tumors outside of the irradiated field was also seen when Flt3 was combined with RT in a murine breast cancer model but not in mice treated with either modality alone. (34) 
The immunologic effects of RT may be further enhanced by [CONTACT_871232] -CTLA -4 or anti -PD-
1/PD -L1 therapy . In mouse models , CTLA -4 blockade alone resulted in no significant tumor 
growth inhibition, but when localized RT was administered in combination with CTLA -4 
blockade, antitumor effects were seen outside of the irradiated field —a phenomenon known as 
the abscopal effe ct.(28, 35)  Though the precise mechanisms involved in the abscopal effect are 
not completely clear, T cells appear to play a cen tral role .(34)  This phenomenon has been 
replicated in multiple solid tumor murine models (Susan Knox, personal communication).  RT and 
PD-1/PD -L1 blockade have also demonstrated synergy in preclinical models. (36, 37)  The triple 
combination of CTLA -4, PD -1, and RT has also been explored in preclinical models and suggests 
even greater efficacy when all three modalities are combined .(38) 
 
CONFIDENTIAL

LUD2015- 006 Protocol Amendment 5 (Final, 12-JUN-2018 ) Page [ADDRESS_1216599] s with multiple solid tumors combining RT and 
granulocyte -macrophage colo ny stimulating factor (GM -CSF) . They reported that  [ADDRESS_1216600] s (30%) experienced an abscopal response, defined as a partial response of at 
least 1 lesion outside of the treatment field .(39)  Though subject  numbers were low, recent data 
have additionally shown an unusually high systemic response rate when RT was combined with 
IL-2 therapy .(40)  
Other case reports have suggested synergy between radiotherapy and immunotherapy .(41-44)  
Retrospective analysis of subject s treated with palliative R T during their induction course of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 3  mg/kg indicates th at combination treatment is not associated with a higher rate 
of irAEs . Only one subject  experienced a grade ≥  3 event (diarrhea) , which  resolved after 
infliximab therapy . This side effec t could have been related to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_165] .(45) 
Whether the dose or sch edule of RT in combination with immunotherapy is relevant remains 
unknown.  Relatively low doses of conventionally fractionated RT (e.g., 30 Gy in 10 fractions) 
have been shown to be effective palliative therapy for melanoma. (23)  Higher doses of 
hypofractionated RT (e.g., 24 Gy in 3 fractions) are also frequently used in melanoma because of 
perceived “radio -resistance” due to high levels of sublethal DNA damage repair in melanoma 
cell lines, although prospective randomized clinical studies have never confirmed this .(24)  
However, the dose and fractionation of RT may have immunologic con siderations relevant for its 
combination with immunotherapy.  Preclinical studies of CTLA -[ADDRESS_1216601] rates of complete tumor 
response with a dose of 24 Gy in 3 fractions (v ersus 20 Gy in 1 fraction or 30 Gy in 5 
fractions). (28)  Another study analyzing the effect of single dose s of radiation from [ADDRESS_1216602] proportion of tumor -reactive T cells to 
regulatory T cells. (27)  Most  importantly, these findings are consistent with our anecdotal 
clinical observations of abscopal effects in patients undergoing RT (both patients were treated 
with approximately 27 Gy in 3 fractions) during ipi[INVESTIGATOR_430164].    
Additional study of t he relationship between RT dose and fractionation is warranted, particularly 
when considering the best strategy to combine with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871190].   This information would be beneficial for subsequent studies involving comb inations 
of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62607] a variety of diseases and therapeutic settings.  
This proposed study is therefore b ased upon the preclinical evidence suggesting synergy 
between RT and immunomodulatory therapy and early promising clinical experiences .  The 
current study is designed  to be the first prospective evaluation  of the combination of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], nivolumab, and RT .

3.1 Study Design  
This is an open -label, multicenter pi[INVESTIGATOR_25093] 1 study of the checkpoint antibodies ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871191] 18 subjects with unresectable Stage IV melanoma. All 
subjects will receive  concurrent  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (3 mg/kg) and nivolumab (1 mg/kg) every 3  weeks 
for 4 doses  (Weeks 1 through 10) , followed by [CONTACT_871233] ( 240 mg  every 2  weeks ) 
through Week 18, with optional extended treatment with nivolumab as described in Section 
3.1.12 . (Note: per Amendment 5, nivolumab monotherapy continuing after Week 18  may be 
given as 480  mg every 4 weeks , starting on Week 2 0, followed by [CONTACT_41585] 24, 28, etc. ).  
Radiotherapy  will be initiated after the first dose and before the second dose of 
immunothe rapy.  
There will be  2 cohorts in the study:  
Cohort A :  
Subject s in Cohort A will initially receive a conventional total RT palliative dose of [ADDRESS_1216603] been accrued to 
Cohort A and completed the concurrent  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871192], if ≤  [ADDRESS_1216604] s will be accrued to Cohort B.  
Note: Grade 3 or 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with  clinical 
symptoms will not be included in the Cohort A safety assessment described above.  
Cohort B:  
Subjects in Cohort B will receive the  high -dose hypofractionated RT  for which t reatment of a 
target lesion will comprise a total palliative dose of [ADDRESS_1216605] after  6 additional weeks at W eek 18. Subjects with symptomatic progression will be

4.1 Safety and Tolerability  
The safety and tolerability of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871202] . Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_871236], based on data review and regular conference calls with the investigators.  
4.1.1  Endpoints & Assessment Methods  
Clinical laboratory tests, vital sign m easurements, physical examinations, and subject interviews 
will be performed to detect new abnormalities and deteriorations of any pre -existing conditions. 
The investigator will evaluate any laboratory abnormalities for clinical significance, and clinically 
significant abnormalities will be recorded as AEs . All treatment- emergent, clinically significant 
abnormalities and deteriorations from the time of informed consent to the End of Study Visit 
should be recorded in the eCRFs  as AEs and graded according to the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (C TCAE ), Version 4.03.  
4.1.[ADDRESS_1216636] Evaluation & Statistics  
The Intent- To-Treat (ITT) Population  for safety and tolerability is defined as all subjects who 
receive at least one dose of study drug or RT.  The Per-Protocol (PP) P opulation for safety and 
tolerability is defined as all subjects  who received at least 75%  of the scheduled doses of study 
drugs and RT over the first 2 cycles, as well as , respective safety assessments  (up to and 
including the pre -dose assessments scheduled for Cycle 3)  without maj or protocol violation s 
over the entire Cohort A concurrent  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871203] (as defined in 
Section  3.1.9) .   
For both cohorts, the overall analysis of safety and tolerability will be based on the ITT Population.  
Appropriate summaries of AEs, laboratory data, and vital sign data will be presented .  AEs will be 
listed individually per subject according to the NCI CTCAE , Version 4.03, and the number of 
subjects experiencing each AE will be summarized using descriptive statistics.

4.2.1  Endpoints & Assessment Methods  
Clinical efficacy will be  determined by [CONTACT_20363] (ORR), disease control rate ( DCR), 
duration of response, p rogression -free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).  The primary 
method of assessment of tumor response will be the Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid 
Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1, and the  secondary method of response evaluation will be irRECIST ( see 
Section  8.4) 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor Response and Overall Response Rate  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Tumor Response o utside the Irradiated Fields  
ORR will be evaluated at Weeks 12 and 18 as a secondary endpoint of this study.  
Tumor imaging assessments (e.g. , CT, MRI, PET, etc.) of chest, abdomen, pelvis, and CNS for 
assessment of tumor size and distribu tion may be employed as deemed appropriate by 
[CONTACT_431]. Every attempt should be made to use whichever imaging technique(s) test(s) are 
used initially for repeat eva luations throughout the study. End of study tumor assessment will 
be 6 weeks from prior  assessment, at the Investigator’s discretion, and in accordance with the 
appropriate evaluation method.  
Radiographic imaging evaluations are considered standard of care for subject s treated with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] /nivolumab . Subject s treated off protocol with apparent progressive disease at 
Weeks 12 or 18 are encouraged to undergo a repeat radiographic assessment of disease 
approximately 4  to 6 weeks later to confirm progression.  
Study radiologists will be informed as to which lesio ns are intended to undergo RT. The lesions 
undergoing RT will not be included in the total tumor burden assessment. A separate calculation 
of response within the irradiated field will be determined as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Tumor Response within  Irradiated Fields  
Since the lesions that undergo RT are not included in the overall tumor burden for purposes of overall response assessments, response within the irradiated field will be separately 
determined.   
The determination of response within the irradiated tumor burden is an independent calculation from the determination of response overall for the tumor burden that does not receive RT.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Disease Control Rate  
Disease Control Rate ( DCR ) will be evaluated at Weeks 12 and 18 as a secondary endpoint of this 
study. DCR is defined as the percentage of evaluable subjects with SD, PR, or CR . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Duration of Response  
Duration of r esponse will be determined for each subject  with time origin at the first occurrence 
of response until the first occurrence of progression or date of death if the subject  dies due to

they discontinue the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Progression -free Survival  
PFS will be defined as the number of days from the date of  the first dose of study drug to the 
date of earliest disease progression based on the appropriate response evaluation method , or to 
the date of death, if disease progression does not occur.  Subjects who do not progress and are 
still alive will be censored on the date of last follow -up or start of new treatment, whichever 
comes first . Every effort will be made t o follow subjects  for progression after they discontinue 
the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overall Survival  
OS will be measured for each subject  from the date of the first dose of study drug  until the 
recorded date of death or last follow -up. Subjects who are  still alive will be  censored on the date 
of last follow -up. Every effort will be made to follow subject s for OS  after they discontinue the 
study.  
4.2.[ADDRESS_1216637] Evaluation & Statistics  
The Intent- To-Treat (ITT) Population for clinical efficacy is defined as all subjects who receive  at 
least one dose of study drug or  RT.   
The Per -Protocol (PP) Population for clinical efficacy is defined as all subjects who received at 
least 75% of the scheduled doses of the study drug and RT over the first 2 cycles, as well as, 
respective disease as sessments, without major protocol violations.   
The analysis will be based on both ITT and PP populations.  
Tumor Response will be summarized and analyzed descriptively for each cohort and analysis 
population .  
Tumor response rates will be assessed overall and for each cohort and tabulated with the 95% 
confidence intervals assuming binomial distribution.  
For time -to-event analyses, Kaplan -Meier methodology will be implemented to estimate the 
median duration of response, median PFS, and median OS at W eeks 12 and 18.  
4.3 Antitumor Immunity  
4.3.1  Endpoints & Assessment Methods  
Exploratory immunologic objectives will be assessed from peripheral blood and tumor biopsy sample s according to the schedule in Section 3.2 to ass ess the influence of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871204], which may include but  may  not be limited to the following:  
• Lymphocyte phenotype using markers such as ICOS, PD -1, and CD25;

6.1.2  Nivolumab Preparation and Administration  
For details regarding nivolumab preparation, storage, and administration please refer to the pharmacy reference sheets/Investigator Brochure.  
1. Visually inspect the drug product solution for particulate matter and discolor ation prior to 
administration. Disca rd if solution is cloudy, if there is pronounced discoloration (solution 
may have a pale -yellow color), or if there is foreign particulate matter other than a few 
translucent -to-white, amorphous particles.   Note: Mix by [CONTACT_645417]. Do 
not shake.  
2. Aseptically withdraw the required volume of nivolumab solution into a syringe, and dispense 
into an IV bag. If multiple vials are needed for a subject, it is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each vial to prevent problems such as dulling of needle tip, 
stopper coring, repeated friction of plunger against syringe barrel wall. Do not  enter into 
each vial more than once. Do not  administer study drug as an IV push or bolus injection . 
3. Add the approp riate volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection solution or 5% Dextrose 
Injection solution. It is acceptable to add nivolumab solution from the vials into an 
appropriate pre -filled bag of diluent . 
4. Note:  Nivolumab infusion concentration must be at or above  the minimum allowa ble 
concentration of 0.35 mg/mL . 
5. Note:  It is not recommended that so -called “channel” or tube systems are used to transport 
prepared infusions of nivolumab.  
6. Attach the IV bag containing the nivolumab solution to the infusion set and filter . 
7. At the end of the infusion period, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of approved diluents.  
Additional information: 
1. The administration of nivolumab infusion must be completed within 24 hours of 
preparation . If not used immediately , the infusion so lution may be stored under 
refrigeration conditions (2°C to 8°C, 36°F to 46°F) for up to 24 hours, and a maximum of 8

Therapy, and ICRU Report #71:  Prescribing, Recording and Reporting Electron Beam Therapy.  
The target lesion for RT  will be defined as the gross tumor volume (GTV). The clinical target 
volume (CTV ) will be the same as the GTV. The plannin g target volume (PTV) will be a minimum 
volumetric expansion of the GTV by 2 mm (5 mm recommended), but ultimately will be left to the discretion of the attending radiation oncologist.  
CT simulation will be performed for planning purposes. Details of the C T simulation (4D CT, 
gating, use of contrast, immobilization) will be left to discretion of the attending radiation oncologist.  
RT will be planned in 3 -D and may be delivered using conventional, IMRT or rapid arc 
methodology. 6-18 MV photons and/or electro n beam RT  will be used as determined by t he 
specific clinical situation.  95% of the PTV should receive th e prescription radiation dose. Normal 
tissue constraints (see  Section  8.5) will not be exceeded during the planning process.  
When photon therapy is used, portal imaging, cone beam CT, or 2D kV on board imaging for QC 
will occur for each treatment.  When electron therapy is used, light field verification of the targ et 
will occur at the start of treatment.  
6.3 Drug Overdose Management  
Any overdoses with the study drugs should be managed according to the appropriate package 
inserts. All overdoses (excess of 10% or more) must be reported, with or without associated

7.1 Documentation and Reporting of Adverse Events  
7.1.1  General AE/SAE Definitions per ICH Guidelines  
An Adverse Event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
N.B.:  The definition above, prov ided for in the GCP -ICH Guideline E6, is being extended for the 
purpose of LICR studies to include any events, intercurrent diseases and accidents observed 
while the subject  is on study, i.e., during the actual treatment period, as well as during drug -
free, pre - and post -treatment periods .,  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
1. Results in death,  
2. Is life -threateningA, 
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
4. Results in persistent or sig nificant disability or incapacity,  
5. Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect or  
6. Is another medically important conditionB. 
A The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
patient/ subject  is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
B Medically important conditions that may not result in death, be immediately life -
threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218402], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient/ subject  or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes l isted in the definition above. Examples of such 
events are intensive treatment in an emergency room  or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
N.B.:  The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of an event (such as: 
mild, mod erate, or severe, e.g., pain). The event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious”, which is based on 
subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events  that pose a threat to 
subject ’s life or vital functions.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations.

1. Pregnancy . 
2. Overdose  (as defined in Se ction 6.3). 
3. Potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI) . 
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver- related laboratory abnormalities 
should occur prior to the report ing of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential 
DILIs, meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs . Potential DILI is defined as:  
• ALT or AST elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN); AND  
• Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_1216660], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase) ; AND  
• No other immediately apparent possible causes of AST/ALT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or 
acute liver disease, or the administration  of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.  
4. Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e .g., pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the 
study drug.  
7.1.3  Severity of an Adverse Event  
The severity of all serious and non -serious AEs should be assessed according to th e NCI CTCAE 
Scale ( Version 4.03).  
7.1.4  Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The relationship of all serious and non -serious AEs to the investigational agent(s) will be 
determined by [CONTACT_218450], using one of the following 
terms (in accordance with NCI Guideline “Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Requirements for NCI Investigational Agents”, NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, January 2001):  
Definitely related  (The AE is clearly related to the investigati onal agent)  
Probably related  (The AE is likely related  to the investigational agent)  
Possibly related  (The AE may be related to the investigational agent)  
Unlikely related  (The AE is doubtfully related to the investigational agent)  
Unrelated  (The AE is cle arly not related  to the investigational agent)  
N.B.:  When making the assessment on causality, it should be taken into consideration that 
immune -therapeutic agents have the potential to cause very late and/or permanent effects on 
the immune system, i.e., a causal relationship could exist despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a lack of apparent temporal 
relationship. Information provided in the IB and/or in Section  1 (Background) of this protocol 
may support these evaluations.

Treatment of Nivolumab-  or Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]- related I nfusion Reactions  
Since nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871218], it is 
unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. However, if such a reaction were to occur, it might manifest with feve r, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritus , 
arthralgia, hypo - or hypertension, b ronchospasm, or other symptoms.  
All Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions should be reported as an SAE if criteria are met. Infusion reactions should b e graded according to NCI CTCA E, Version 4.0 3 guidelines.  
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate:  
For Grade 1 symptoms:  (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indic ated)  
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. The following prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol (acetaminophen) [ADDRESS_1216718] 30 minutes before 
additional nivolumab /ipi[INVESTIGATOR_641506].  
For Grade 2 symptoms:  (Moderate reaction ; requires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [e. g., ant ihistamines, non -steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs,  narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic 
medications indicated for 24 hours).  
Stop the nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_182], begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent ) and/or paracetamol (acetaminophen) 
325 to 1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. I f the 
infusion is interrupted, restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% 
of the original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur then no further 
nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871219]. Administer diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_1216719] be recorded on the eCRF. The following prophylactic premedication s 
are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol (acetaminophen) [ADDRESS_1216720] 30 minutes 
before additional nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45782]. If necessary, corticostero ids 
(recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.

Immediately disc ontinue infusion of nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Begin an IV infusion of normal 
saline, and treat the subject as follows. Recommend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 s olution 
injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab or ip ilimumab will be 
permanently discontinued. Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. In the case of late- occurring hypersensitivity sympt oms (e .g., appearance of a 
localized or generalized pruritus  within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may b e 
given (e .g., oral antihistamine  or corticosteroids).  
For subjects who are expected to require more than 4 weeks of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants to manage AEs, the following recommendations should be considered.  
• Administer antimicrobial/antifungal prophylaxis per institutional guidelines to prevent 
opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jiroveci and fungal infections . 
• Early consultation with an infectious disease specialist should be considered. Depending on 
the presentation, consultation with a pulmonologist for bronchoscopy or a gastroenterologist for endoscopy may also be appropriate.  
• In subjects  who develop recurr ent AEs in the setting of ongoing or prior immunosuppressant 
use, an opportunistic infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

LUD2015- 006 Protocol Amendment 5 (Final, 12-JUN-2018 ) Page [ADDRESS_1216722] Guidelines  
The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines were  revised in [ADDRESS_1216723] 1.1. (47) These guidelines have been the widely accepted criteria to assess response and 
progre ssion in solid tumors ; however, limitations have been noted in the use of RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1216724] shown that complete 
response, partial response, or stable disease status can still be achieve d after an initial increase 
in overall tumor burden, and regression of initial lesions may occur despi[INVESTIGATOR_871220].  The Immune -related Response Criteria (irRC) were developed to address the need for 
response criteria in an immunotherapy se tting. (13)  The main difference with irRC was that it 
considered the subject's total tumor burden  at each subsequent assessment and required 
confirmation of suspected disease progression with subsequent imaging, approximately four 
weeks later.  In addition, a greater number of lesions (10 vs. 5) were measured in a 
bidimensional manner instead of  unidimensionally  as in RECIST 1.1 .  In 2013, Nishino et al. 
demonstrated that immune -related response criteria using unidimensional measurements were 
highly concordant with the bidimensional results of irRC, but with less measurement 
variability. (48)  Based on t hese findings and in order to utilize both the established criteria of 
irRC and RECIST 1.1, the two systems have been adapted, modified, and combined into the 
Immune -related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) .(49)  The adapted 
irRECIST criteria are modifications to the irRC, incorporating the findings of Nishino et al. and the advantages of RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1216725] 1.1 guidelines as published ( 47) and as summarized by 
[CONTACT_299649] -involved clinical trials .   
I. Disease Parameters for RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1216726] diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1216727] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as > [ADDRESS_1216728] x -ray, as >[ADDRESS_1216729] scan, or >[ADDRESS_1216730] be 
recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Note:  Tumor lesions tha t are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable.  If the investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, the conditions 
under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol . 
NOTE for irRECIST: During target lesion selection the radiologist will consider information on 
the anatomical sites of previous intervention (e.g. previous irradiation,  RF-ablation, TACE, 
surgery, etc.). Lesions undergoing prior intervention will not be selected as target lesions 
unless there has been a demonstration of progress in the lesion.

recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and i n follow -up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed.  
Non -measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -measurable.  
Note:  Cys tic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.   ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be 
considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection 
as target lesions.  
NOTE for irRECIST:  
Lesions  that are partially cystic or necrotic can be selected as target lesions. The longest 
diameter of such a lesion will be added to the Total Measured Tumor Burden (TMTB) of all 
target lesions at baseline. If other lesions with a non- liquid/non- necrotic compo nent are 
present, those should be preferred.  
Brain lesions detected on brain scans can be considered as both target or non- target lesions 
depending on the protocol definition.  
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded 
and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative  of all involved organs, but in addition should be 
those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next l argest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A 
sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes  are to be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non -target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any non -measureable as well 
as measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified a s non -target 
lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not  
required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be 
noted throughout follow -up.

LUD2015- 006 Protocol Amendment 5 (Final, 12-JUN-2018 ) Page 52 of 70 II. Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to character ize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
Clinical lesions :  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_164943], including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x- ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional C T and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1216733] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, wh ich greatly 
impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  
Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at 
baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST gu idelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters 
for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET- CT is 
not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However , if the 
site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET- CT is of identical diagnostic quality to 
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for 
RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably wi th conventional CT in accurately 
measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
Ultrasound:   Ultrasound is not use ful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed tha t the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to

SOP -C01-TMP -3 version 3  
LUD2015- 006 Protocol Amendment 5 (Final, 12-JUN-2018 ) Page [ADDRESS_1216734] in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are ob tained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence 
following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor markers:   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in 
complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian 
cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published .(50-52)  In 
addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -[ADDRESS_1216735] -line trials in ovarian 
cancer .(53)  
Cytology, Histology:   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) a nd progressive disease.  
FDG -PET:   While FDG- PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG- PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of 
FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a) Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG- PET at follow -up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion.  
b) No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at  follow -up:  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If the 
positive FDG- PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional 
follow -up CT scans are needed to determine  if there is truly progression occurring at 
that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG- PET scan).  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT 
that is not progressing on the ba sis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
c) FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in 
cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring.  The use of FDG- PET in this circu mstance should be prospectively described in 
the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical literature for the indication.  
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR 
due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy  resolution/sensitivity.

twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
III. Response Criteria for RECIST 1.1  
A. Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.    
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study  
B. Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalizat ion of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis)  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non -CR/No n-PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits  
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions.  Unequiv ocal progression should not normally trump 
target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.   
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871221], and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
C. Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment 
will depend on the achievement of bot h measurement  and confirmation criteria.

advised.  
 
D. Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recor ded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measure d from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

LUD2015- 006 Protocol Amendment 5 (Final, 12-JUN-2018 ) Page [ADDRESS_1216736] (irRECIST) guideline s according to Bohnsack et al. ( 49) are presented 
below.  
I. Baseline Assessments in irRECIST  
In irRECIST, baseline  assessment and measurement of measurable/non -measurable and 
target/non -target lesions and lymph nodes are in line with RECIST 1.1.  One new definition is 
added: If a subject has no measurable and no non -measurable disease at baseline the radiologist 
will assign ‘No Disease’ (irND) as the overall tumor assessment for any available follow -up time 
points unless new measurable lesions are identified and contribute to the total measured tumor 
burden ( TMTB ).  irND is a valid assessment in studies with adjuvant s etting where the protocol 
and study design allow the inclusion of subjects with no visible disease  
II Follow -up Assessments  in irRECIST  
A. Follow -up recording of target and new measurable lesions  
A key difference in irRECIST is that the appearance new lesions do es not automatically 
indicate progression .  Instead, all measured lesions (baseline -selected target lesions and new 
measurable lesions) are combined into the total measured tumor burden (TMTB)  at follow up.   
Baseline -selected t arget lesions and new measurable lesions are  NOT assessed separately. 
Measurements of those lesions ar e combined into the TMTB, and one combined assessment 
provided.  
In order to be selected as new measurable lesions  (≤ 2 lesions per organ, ≤ 5 lesions total, per 
time point ), new lesions must meet criteria as defined for baseline target lesion selection and 
meet the same minimum size requirements of [ADDRESS_1216737] 1.1 definitions for assessment of non -target lesions apply.  The response of non -target 
lesions primarily contributes to the overall response assessments of irCR and irNon -CR/Non -PD 
(irNN). Non -target lesions do not affect irPR and irSD assessments. Only a massive and 
unequivocal worsening of non -target lesions alone, even without progress in the TMTB is 
indic ative of irPD .  In alignment with RECIST 1.1, baseline selected non -target lesions can never 
convert to measurable lesions, not even if they increase in size at subsequent time points and 
become measurable. Only true new lesions can be measured and contribute to the TMTB
. 
C. Follow -up for New Non -Measurable Lesions  
All new lesions not selected as new measurable lesions are considered new non -measurable 
lesions and are followed qualitatively. Only a massive and unequivocal progression of new non -
measurable lesions leads to an overall assessment of irPD for the time  point. Persisting new 
non-measurable lesions prevent irCR.

LUD2015- 006 Protocol Amendment 5 (Final, 12-JUN-2018 ) Page [ADDRESS_1216738] diameters (SumD) of all target lesions  (up to 2 lesions per 
organ, up to total 5 lesions) is  measured.   At each  subsequent tumor assessment  (TA), the SumD 
of the target lesions and of  new, measurable lesions  (up to 2 new lesions per organ, total 5 new 
lesions) are added  together to provide the total measurable tumor burden (TMTB) . 
Overall Assessments by [CONTACT_299650] 
(irCR)  Complete disappearance of all measurable and non- measurable lesions. Lymph 
nodes must decrease to < 10 mm in short axis.  
Partial Response 
(irPR)  Decrease of ≥ 30% in TMTB relative to baseline, non -target lesions are irNN, and 
no unequivocal progression of new non- measurable lesions  
• If new measurable lesions appear in subjects with no target lesions at 
baseline , irPD will be assessed. That irPD time  point will be considered a new 
baseline, and all subsequent time points will be compared to it for response assessment. irPR is possible if the TMTB of new measurable lesions decreases 
by ≥ 30% compared to the first irPD documentation  
• irRECIST can be used  in the adjuvant setting , in subjects with no visible 
disease on CT/MRI scans. The appearance of new measurable lesion(s) 
automatically leads to an increase in TMTB by 100% and leads to irPD. These 
subjects can achieve a response if the TMTB decreases at follow -up, as a sign 
of delayed response.  
• Based on the above, sponsors may consider enrolling subjects with no 
measurable disease and/or no visible disease in studies with response related 
endpoints . 
Stable Disease (irSD)  Failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR in the absence of irPD 
Progressive Disease (irPD)  Minimum 20% increase and minimum [ADDRESS_1216739] irPD assessment. An 
irPD confirmation scan may be recommended for subjects with a minimal TMTB 
%-increase over 20% and especially during the flare time -window of the first 12 
weeks of treatment, depending on  the compound efficacy expectations, to 
account for expected delayed response.  
• In irRECIST a substantial and unequivocal increase of non- target lesions  is 
indicative of progression.  
• IrPD may be assigned for a subject with multiple new non -measurable lesion s 
if they are considered to be a sign of unequivocal massive worsening  
Other  irNE:  used in exceptional cases where insufficient data exist.  
irND:  in adjuvant setting when no disease is detected  
irNN:  no target disease was identified at baseline, and at follow- up the subject 
fails to meet criteria for irCR or irPD

Bowel and stomach (prior dose >40 Gy within 3 cm of target)  
 
The target should be one that is not exclusively within bone ( i.e., a bone metastasis with no 
extraosseous soft tissue component), and therefore cannot be assessed fo r radiographic 
response by [CONTACT_990] -defined criteria.   
Priority should be given to irradiating symptomatic metastases.   
If multiple symptomatic targets are present, the largest target that can safely be irradiated 
should be chosen.   
More than one target  can be irradiated, but at least one site of measurable disease must be not 
be irradiated for response assessment purposes (see protocol).  
The radiotherapy target should be described categorically as one of the following:  
Lymph node  
Bone  
Skin Lung Liver  
Gastrointestinal tract  
Muscle  
Other  
 
The target for radiation therapy should be anatomically described (including laterality) in order to aid in radiographic response determination by [CONTACT_30573].

8.5.5  Beam selection and geometry, planning technique and treatment delivery 
In general, beams should be chosen to preserve OAR constraints and provide adequate PTV 
dosing (D95 ≥95% of the prescription dose), while respecting mechanical constraints of 
equipment.  No minimum number of beams is necessary.   Coplanar and non -coplanar beams 
are permitted.  
Any form of external beam radiotherapy is acceptable (high energy photons, electrons, or protons), provided the dose is expressed in cobalt -Gy equivalent (CGyE) or Gy equivalent.  Beam 
energy should be chosen in consideration of penetration depth, neutron contamination, etc.  To 
accoun t for the radiobiologic effectiveness of electrons, investigators are encouraged to 
prescribe the radiation dose to the 90% isodose line that encompasses the PTV.   
Radiotherapy must be planned in 3 -dimensions, and dose -volume analyses are required to 
ensu re OAR constraints and PTV coverage is adequate.  For 3D conformal planning, both 
physical and dynamic wedges can be used.  Both MLC and block could be used for beam confinement when using photons.  
Planning and treatment delivery can be carried out using any technique (non -conformal, 
conformal, intensity -modulated, volume modulated arc, etc) using any mechanism of external 
beam radiation delivery (linear accelerator, CyberKnife™, etc).  
Use of tissue equivalent bolus to ensure adequate build -up is permitted for the treatment of 
superficial targets.  
Verification of accurate subject  positioning for treatment must occur through the generation 
and assessment of imaging (MV port films, kV images, cone beam CT, etc) or direct inspection of light fields (for electron beam therapy).  Conventional subject setup with skin tattoos or optical 
surface imaging can only be used as initial subject  alignment, but not final positioning.  
8.5.[ADDRESS_1216747] s receiving 27 Gy in 3 fractions should be scheduled to receive treatment on non -
consecutive weekdays, no more than 2 days/week,  over no more than 14 days.  Ideally, 
treatment will be given with 2 days between treatment (Monday/Thursday/Monday, Tuesday/Friday/Tuesday, Monday/Friday/Tuesday, or Tuesday/Friday/Wednesday schedule).  
Subject s receiving 30 Gy in 10 fractions should be sc heduled to receive treatment on 
consecutive weekdays, no more than 5 days/week, over no more than 14 days.  
Dose modifications for radiotherapy as a result of toxicity  are allowed per the Investigator’s 
assessment.

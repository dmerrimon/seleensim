 CONFIDENTIAL  CLINICAL STUDY PROTO COL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Phase 3, Randomized, 3 -Part Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of 
Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725708] 
(EoE)  
Site Location(s)  Global  
Objective(s)  Primary Objectives  
This study consists of three parts:  Part A and Part B are 24 -week treatment, 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study phases and Part C is a 
28-week, extended active treatment phase that will enroll patients from Part A 
and Pa rt B. 
The primary objectives by [CONTACT_725819]:  
• Part A: To determine the treatment effect of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725709] 24 weeks 
of treatment as assessed by [CONTACT_725820]/confirm the final sample size determination for Part B.  
• Note:  Patients enrolled in Part A may not participate in Part B.  
• Part B: To demonstrate the efficacy of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725710] r 24 weeks 
of treatment as assessed by [CONTACT_725821].  
• Part C: To assess the safety and efficacy of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725711] 52 weeks of 
treatment as assessed by [CONTACT_725822].  
Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725712] 52 weeks in adult and adolescent 
patients with EoE  
• To explore the relationship between dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725713], using 
descriptive analyses  
• To evaluate the effects of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24733] 2 inflammation  
• To demonstrate the efficacy of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725714] [ADDRESS_990770] previously received 
swallowed topi[INVESTIGATOR_725715] A  
Screening (Up to 12 Weeks)  
After obtaining informed consent/assent, patients will initially be assessed for 
study eligibility at visit 1.  
Study participants are required to have a conﬁrmed diagnosis of EoE which 
may be established either by a prior historical biopsy or by [CONTACT_725823].  
All patients meeting clinical and laboratory eligibility criteria will undergo 
endoscopy with biopsies at visit 2 to establish a baseline reference measure . For 
patients without a historical biopsy, the visit 2 biopsies will serve as both 
confirmation of EoE diagnosis and the baseline reference measure . All biopsies

 CONFIDENTIAL  performed during this study will be evaluated by [CONTACT_24967] a central 
pathology laboratory who will be blinded to treatment assignment.  
After confirmation of EoE diagnosis, patients will be given an electronic diary 
(eDiary) to begin recording dysphagia symptoms on a daily basis.  
Randomization  
At the baseline visit (visit 3), patients who continue to meet eligibility criteria 
will enter the 24 -week placebo -controlled, double -blind treatment period and 
will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300  mg once weekly (QW) or 
placebo administered subcutaneously (SC).  
Placebo -Controlled Double -Blind Treatment Period (24 Weeks)  
The co -primary endpoints will be assessed at week 24, one week after the last 
dose of study drug du ring the double -blind treatment period to inform/confirm 
the final sample size determination for Part B.  
At the end of the double -blind treatment visit (week 24), eligible patients in 
Part A may enter a 28 -week extended active treatment period (Part C) . Patients 
not participating in Part C will enter a [ADDRESS_990771] patient is enrolled 
in Part A.  
Screeni ng (Up to 12 Weeks)  
The screening procedures for Part B are identical to those described above for 
Part A.  
Randomization  
At the baseline visit (visit 3), patients who continue to meet eligibility criteria 
will enter the 24 -week double -blind treatment perio d and will be randomized 
in a 1:1:1 ratio to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg QW, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg once every two 
weeks (Q2W), or placebo administered SC.  
Placebo -controlled Double -Blind Treatment Period (24 Weeks)  
Procedures for Part B are identical to those for Part A.  
At the end of the double -blind treatment visit (week 24), eligible patients in 
Part B may enter a 28 -week extended active treatment period (Part C) . Patients 
not participating in Part C will enter a 12 -week follow -up period.  
Part C (28 -Week Extended Active  Treatment Period)  
At the end of the double -blind treatment visit (week 24), eligible patients in 
Part A and Part B may enter a 28 -week extended active treatment period where 
all patients will receive active treatment with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725716] B will be blinded to treatment regimen in Part C.  
Patients from Part A who are randomized to placebo during the double -blind 
treatment period will receive dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg QW during Part C . Patients 
from Part A who are randomized to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg QW during the 
double -blind treatment period will continue to receive dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg QW 
during Part C.  
Patients from Part B who are randomized to placebo during the double -blind 
treatment period will be re -randomized in a 1:1 ratio to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg QW 
or dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg Q2W .  
Patients randomized to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg Q2W will also receive matching 
placebo administered Q2W alternating with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725717] -blinding purposes . All other

 CONFIDENTIAL  patients will remain on the same dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725718] -blind treatment period.  
Follow -up Period (12 Weeks)  
All patients will be followed up for an additional 12 weeks after completing 
Part C or, if ineligible for Part  C, immediately following Part A or B.  
Rescue Treatment  
If medically necessary, rescue medications (systemic and/or swallowed topi[INVESTIGATOR_030]) or emergency esophageal dilation are allowed in study patients 
in Parts A, B and C . An endoscopy with bi opsies will be performed prior to the 
initiation of rescue therapy unless COVID -19 restrictions prohibit this 
procedure. If the endoscopy with biopsies cannot occur due to COVID -19 
restrictions, rescue treatment should not be delayed, and these patients wi ll be 
eligible for Part C . Part C treatment will be initiated per the schedule of events 
and only at an in -clinic visit . Patients receiving rescue therapy may continue to 
receive study drug . They will remain blinded and will be asked to return to the 
clinic for all remaining study treatment visits and participate in all study 
assessments according to the schedule of events . However, they will not 
undergo any scheduled endoscopy/biopsies subsequent to the date of rescue.  
Study Duration  The duration of the study for a patient (excluding the screening period) is 
approximately [ADDRESS_990772] patient in the study.

Procedures and Assessments  Efficacy assessments  include the following:  
• Esophageal endoscopy with biopsies:  Biopsies will be obtained for 
histologic assessments including intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_725723] (EoE Grade Score and EoE Stage Score) . Biopsies will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_24967] a central pathology laboratory who will be 
blinded to treatment assignment.  
• For Part A enrolle d patients, EoE -EREFS scoring will only be performed at 
the time of the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_313528] A and Part C by [CONTACT_725826][INVESTIGATOR_014] (prior to biopsies) . For Part B enrolled 
patients, EoE -EREFS scoring will be performed by [CONTACT_725827][INVESTIGATOR_313528] B and Part C as well as a centralized 
reading center. The centralized reading will be used for analysis, if available. 
If the centralized reading is not available, the EoE -EREFS performed by [CONTACT_725828].  
• For all endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the investigators will assess minor esophageal features 
including mucosal inflammatory and remodeling features. DSQ will be 
completed daily by [CONTACT_725829].  
• The EoE -IQ, a disease -specific measure of health -related QOL in EoE 
patients, will be completed by [CONTACT_725830].  
• The EoE Symptom Questionnaire, a questionnaire measuring the frequency 
and severity of symptoms other than dysphagia and swallowing pain, will 
be completed by [CONTACT_725830].  
• The endolumenal functional lumen imaging probe (EndoFLIP) procedure 
to measure esophageal distensibility may be performed during the 
esophagogastroscopy procedures at se lected North American sites in 
approximately 150 adult patients.  
Safety and tolerability  will be assessed by [CONTACT_31029], vital signs, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests, and clinical evaluations . 
Patients will be asked to repor t all adverse events (AEs) experienced from the 
time of informed consent until their last study visit.  
Pharmacokinetics (PK) :  Serum samples will be collected at specified time 
points for assay of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24762].  
Anti -drug antibody (ADA) :  Serum s amples will be collected at specified time 
points for assay of ADA and exploratory analyses.  
Statistical Plan  Sample Size   
Part A:   The planned sample size for Part A is approximately 40 patients in 
each treatment group.  
Part B:   Based on the Part A study results, the planned sample size for Part B 
is approximately 70 patients in each treatment group such that for the 
comparison of each dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725724]:  
• This sample size will yield >99.9% power to detect a treatm ent difference 
of 55.4%  in the proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal 
intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_24759] ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 between placebo 
(5.1% ) and the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24771] ( 59.5% ) at a 2 -sided 
significan ce level of 5% using Fisher’s exa ct test.

 CONFIDENTIAL  • This sample size will provide >99.9% power to detect a treatment 
difference of -12.3 points in the mean change from baseline in the total 
DSQ score to week 24 at a 2 -sided significance level of 5% using a two -
sample t -test, assuming a common stand ard deviation (SD) of 15.0 13.0. 
Therefore, the sample size of  70  patients/arm will provide an overall power 
of >99.9%  (99.9% × 99.9%) for the co -primary endpoints, assuming no 
negative correlation between the two endpoints. In Part B, the same treatment 
effect for the two 300 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725725] (ie, QW and Q2W) is 
assumed.  
Efficacy Analysis Sets  
For Part A and Part B, the efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the 
study -part-specific full analysis set (FAS) that includes all randomized patients 
in the corresponding study part.  
The efficacy endpoints in Part C (the extended active treatment period) will be 
summarized for all patients who received any extended active treatment study 
drug in that part.  
Safety Analysis Set  
For Part A and Part B, the study -part-specific safety analysis set (SAF) includes 
all randomized patients who received any study drug in the corresponding study 
part; it is based on the treatment received (as treated) . Treatment 
compliance/administration and all clinical safety vari ables will be analyzed 
using the SAF.  
For safety analyses of the Part C extended treatment period, only a subset of 
SAF will be included, which is defined as those patients who received at least 
1 dose of Part C study drug.  
Statistical Analysis  
All statis tical analyses will be conducted separately for Part A and Part B.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis (Part A and Part B):  
The co -primary endpoint of proportion of patients achieving a histologic 
response of peak esophageal intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_24759] ≤6 eos/hpf at 
week  24 will be analyzed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test to 
assess the difference in the proportion of responders in the FAS, adjusting for 
the randomization stratification factors.  
The co -primary endpoint of absolute change from ba seline in the DSQ total 
score at week 24 will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model for the FAS with treatment group, randomization stratification factor, 
and relevant baseline measurement as covariates included in the model.  
To accoun t for use of rescue treatment in the primary analysis, for peak 
esophageal intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_24764] ≤6 eos/hpf, patients will be 
considered as non -responders after the use of rescue treatment. For absolute 
change from baseline in the DSQ total s core, data will be imputed using 
multiple imputation (MI) for all time points subsequent to the use of rescue 
treatment.  
If a patient has missing value for the  histological response (peak esophageal 
intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_24759] ≤6 eos/hpf) at week 24,  the patient will be 
classified as a non -responder at week 24.  
If a patient has missing value for the DSQ total score at week 24, the missing 
data will be imputed by [CONTACT_725831]. Similarity is based on randomized 
                                        VV-RIM-00127522-1.0 Approved - 05 Nov 2020 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_990778]-rescue to missing.  
Secondary Efficacy Analysis (Part A and Part B):  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed in the same fashion as the 
co-primary endpoints depending on the type of data, unless otherwise specified.  
For continuous efficacy data that are scheduled to be measured only once 
post-baseline at week 24, mis sing values at week 24 will be imputed with 
patient’s baseline value or the available post -baseline value, whichever is 
worse, ie, a worst observation carried forward (WOCF) approach.  
Subgroup analysis (eg, by [CONTACT_551]) will also be performed.  
Secondary E fficacy Analysis (Part C):  
Efficacy endpoints in Part C will be summarized with descriptive statistics by 
[CONTACT_94309] C. Inferential statistics will only be provided as 
needed.  
Multiplicity Considerations:  
Part A and Part B will have separa te and independent 2 -sided alpha level of 
0.05.  
Part A:  Statistical significance of the co -primary endpoints at the 2 -sided 
Type  I error rate of 5% will be required before drawing inferential conclusions 
about any secondary efficacy endpoints.  
Part B:  T he co -primary endpoints will be tested for the comparison of 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725726], the testing will proceed to the co -primary endpoints of 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q2W, or the secondary endpoints o f dupi[INVESTIGATOR_710187], with the exact 
order to be specified in Part B statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
Safety Analysis:  
Safety analysis will be based on the SAF. This includes reported 
treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) and other safety data (ie, clinical laboratory 
evaluations, vital signs, and 12 -lead ECG results). A descriptive summary of 
safety results will be presented by [CONTACT_24970].

 CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, inflammatory, allergic/immune -mediated disease of 
the esophagus . The disease is characterized by [CONTACT_725832] (Furuta, 2017 ) (Liacouras, 2011 ) (DeBrosse, 2011 ) 
(Falk,  2014 ). Although considered a rare disease, the current prevalence is estimated at 22.7 per 
100,000 worldwide  (Arias, 2016 ) and appears to be on the increase  (Dellon , 2014a ). Eosinophilic 
esophagitis has been reported in all ages; however, most cases are in children and adults younger 
than 50 years (Dellon, 2014a ) (Dellon, 2014b ) (Dellon, 2007 ) (Kapel, 2008 ) (Liacouras, 2011 ) 
(Spergel, 2009 ). Gender differences in EoE have been consistently reported, with males affected 
3 to 4 times more often than females  (Dellon, 2014a ), but there are no gender -related differences 
in the clinical symptoms (Kapel, 2008 ) (Prasad, 2009 ) (Veerappan,  2009 ) (Hruz, 2011 ) 
(Ally, 2015 ). 
The primary clinical manifestations of EoE in both adults and children over 10 years of age are 
dysphagia and food impaction (Lucendo, 2017 ). These symptoms lead to substantially impaired 
quality of life (QOL) (DeBrosse, 2011 ) (Falk, 2014 ) (Straumann, 2008 ) (Straumann, 2003 ). 
Endoscopic findings are related to the inflammation in the esophagus and consist of fixed or 
transient concentric rings, longitudinal furrows, white plaques, reduced mucosal vascularity, 
fragile or crepe -like mucosa, and strictures . Rings  and furrows are the most common, seen in nearly 
half of patients (Singla, 2016 ). 
Growing evidence suggests that a Type [ADDRESS_990787] 
cell, T cell, and lymphocyte -induced inflammation via cytokines known to regulate eosinophilic 
accumulation in the esophagus, such as interleukin (IL) -4, IL -5, IL -13, and eotaxin -1, -2, and -3 
(Abonia, 2010 ) (Abonia, 2012 ) (Blanchard, 2006 ) (Blanchard, 2008 ) (Blanchard, 2010 ) 
(Bullock,  2007 ) (Mishra, 2003 ) (Mishra, 2009 `) (Straumann, 2001 ). Th2 cells are a subgroup of 
the T cells that regulate the activity of other immune cells by [CONTACT_725833] 2 cytokines . IL-13 
has been found to be upregulated in the esophageal epi[INVESTIGATOR_725728]  (Blanchard, 2007 ). 
The induction of eotaxin -3, an eosinophil chemoattractant, is thought to be an important factor in 
EoE pathogenesis (Blanchard, 2006 ) (Blanchard, 2007 ). The [ADDRESS_990788] up -regulated genes in 
esophageal biopsies from EoE patients (compared to normal controls) encode eotaxin -3 and 
periostin, another protein induced by [CONTACT_39764] 2 cytokine s and thought to promote inflammation and 
remodeling (Blanchard, 2006 ) (Blanchard, 2008 ). Furthermore, esophageal biopsies and blood 
samples of patients with active EoE have increased levels of cy tokines and chemokines associated 
with Type 2 inflammation, including IL -4 and IL -13, thymic and stromal lymphopoeitin (TSLP), 
and eotaxin -3 secreted by [CONTACT_149712][INVESTIGATOR_725729]:  T cells, mast cells, 
basophils, invariant natural  killer T cells (iNKTs), and esophageal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] . Mutations in 
the eotaxin -[ADDRESS_990789] been 
associated with EoE risk  (Cianferoni, 2016 ). 
Impaired barrier funct ion of the esophageal epi[INVESTIGATOR_725730] a role in EoE 
pathogenesis . Several genes in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_725731], known to be down -regulated 
by [CONTACT_39764] 2 cytokines with resultant barrier dysfunction of the skin, are also down -regulated i n 
primary esophageal epi[INVESTIGATOR_78073] . Furthermore, decreased mRNA expression of the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_725732] (FLG), and the esophagus -specific esophagin

 CONFIDENTIAL  (small proline -rich protein 3 [SPRR3]), was observed in esophageal bi opsies from EoE patients 
compared to normal controls (Blanchard, 2010 ). The increased frequency at which FLG null alleles 
were found in EoE patients compared to controls provides further evidence of the barrier 
hypothesis in E oE (Blanchard, 2010 ). It is also known that FLG mRNA expression is directly 
suppressed by [CONTACT_8668] -4 and IL -13 in keratinocytes  (Howell,  2007 ). The data suggest that Type [ADDRESS_990790] high rates of comorbid allergic diseases which are also associat ed with enhanced IL -4 
and IL -13 signaling, especially food allergies, atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma, and allergic rhinitis 
(Arora, 2012 ) (Assa’ad, 2008 ) (Liacouras, 2011 ) (Moawad, 2010 ) (Roy-Ghanta, 2008 ) 
(Weinbrand -Goichberg, 2013 ).  
The inflammatory damage to the esophageal epi[INVESTIGATOR_725733], such as d ysphagia . Chronic inflammation of the esophagus may also lead to 
remodeling, stricture formation, and fibrosis (Hirano, 2014 ). The fibrotic aspect of progressed 
disease is not well understood, and whether or not this can be re versed  with treatment is unknown.  
Current therapeutic approaches include chronic dietary elimination, swallowed topi[INVESTIGATOR_725734] (not approved for the treatment of EoE outside the European Union [EU]), and 
esophageal dilation . Emergency endoscopy for prolonged and/or painful food impaction is 
associated with a risk of severe esophageal injury and does not alter the underlying pathogenesis 
or progression of the disease . Although swallowed topi[INVESTIGATOR_725735], they are not uniformly 
effective and can be associated with fungal infections as well as disease recurrence after 
discontinuation.

and IL -13 signaling by [CONTACT_125438] -4 receptor alpha (IL -4Rα) subunit shared by

 CONFIDENTIAL  3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
The study is divided into 3 parts:   
• Part A consists of a screening period of up to 12 weeks, followed by a randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled, 2 -arm, parallel -group, 24 -week treatment period . 
Patients who complete Part A will either enter Part C or continue to a 12 -week follow -
up period (for patients who do not go on to Part C).  
• Part B c onsists of a screening period of up to 12 weeks, followed by a randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled, 3 -arm, parallel -group, 24 -week treatment period . 
Patients who complete Part B will either enter Part C or continue to a 12 -week follow -
up period (f or patients who do not go on to Part C) . Enrollment in Part B will begin 
immediately after the last patient has been randomized in Part A.  
• Part C is an extended active treatment period and consists of a 2 -arm, 28 -week 
treatment period . Patients who complet e Part C will continue to a 12 -week follow -up 
period.  
The co -primary endpoints selected for Parts A and B of the study (proportion of patients achieving 
peak esophageal intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_24764] ≤6 eos/high power field [hpf] at week 24 and 
change  in DSQ score from baseline to week 24) assess important clinical and histological measures 
of dysphagia symptoms and disease activity and progression . Eosinophilic infiltration of the 
esophageal mucosa is the hallmark of the disease and, in conjunction wi th characteristic clinical 
symptoms of esophageal dysfunction (solid food dysphagia, food impaction), is considered 
pathognomonic for EoE.  
Solid food dysphagia is the most common presenting symptom of EoE and food impaction 
necessitating endoscopic bolus removal occurs in 33% to 54% of adult EoE patients 
(Dellon,  2013 ). The DSQ is a daily patient -reported outcome (PRO) measure that has been 
validated for the measurement of dysphagia frequency and severity in patients with EoE  
(Dellon,  2013 ) (Hudgens, 2017 ). The questions ask whether solid food has been eaten; whether 
food has gone down slowly or become stuck; and what, if any, measures have been taken to achieve 
relief. 
Since the gross appearance of the esophageal mucosa assessed by [CONTACT_725837], EoE -EREFS is a key secondary endpoint . The 
EoE-EREFS is a validated classiﬁcation and grading system designed to standardize nomenclature 
for the major endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_107953]ﬁed esophageal features of EoE (edema, rings, exudates, 
furrows, and strictures) (Hirano, 20 13). Recent studies have demonstrated the clinical relevance 
of endoscopic severity assessment in EoE . The severity of each of the EoE -EREFS subscores has 
been shown to be associated with patient -reported global symptom activity (Schoepfer, 2014 ). The 
use of a visual endoscopy score is consistent with the emphasis on endoscopic mucosal healing as 
a primary endpoint of therapeutics in inflammatory bowel disease, peptide ulcer disease and 
GERD (Hirano, 2017 ).

Clinical Study Protocol   R668 -EE-1774 Amendment 5

 CONFIDENTIAL  The study will include adolescents ≥12 years of age . The primary clinical manifestation of EoE in 
children and adolescents ≥10 years of age is dysphagia and food impaction, similar to adult patients 
(Lucendo, 2017 ). In addition, the disease appears to have the same underlying pathophysiology 
regardless of age; similar high rates of atopy as well as a genetic predisposition have been 
demonstrated in both the pediatric and adult populations . A unique genetic signature [CONTACT_725890], suggesting the biological 
manifestations of disease are the same across all age groups  (Blanchard, 2006 ). Additional work 
demons trated that a transcriptome of 96 genes in EoE patients was similar between both adults and 
children  (Wen, 2013 ). 
Study treatment will be administered for approximately 24 weeks in the double -blind, placebo -
controlled phase to adequat ely assess the risk/benefit profile of a drug intended for chronic use . In 
the phase 2, multicenter, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study in patients with EoE 
(R668 -EE-1324), a plateau in clinical effect had not been observed by [CONTACT_5875] 12 with a dose of 300 
mg once weekly (QW) . An additional 28  weeks of extended active treatment in Part C for an 
overall exposure of approximately 52 weeks will provide data on the long -term efficacy and safety 
of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725749].  
There are several j ustifications for the inclusion of a placebo control group in this study . Although 
there is an approved swallowed topi[INVESTIGATOR_725750], it is only indicated for 
short -term use in adults, not for chronic treatment or treatment of pedi atric patients  (EMA Jorveza 
Assessment Report, 2017 ). Furthermore, it is only approved in this region and thus considered 
inappropriate for use in a global study . Studies show that patients with EoE frequently relapse, 
even while maintained on long -term topi[INVESTIGATOR_110830]  (Eluri, 2017 ). Furthermore, although 
studies have shown that a prolonged delay in the diagnosis and treatment of EoE increases the risk 
of stricture formation in a time -dependent manner, the median delay in EoE diagnosis in these 
studies was 6 years, and duration of follow -up was over 20 years (Schoepfer, 2013 ). It is unlikely 
that a [ADDRESS_990792] a patient’s long -term prognosis . In addition, rescue treatment (including swallowed steroids 
and dilation) is allowed f or any patient who experiences intolerable symptoms during the study . 
Finally, study patients will be offered the opportunity to participate in the [ADDRESS_990793] benefit, even for patients initially enrolled 
in the placebo treatment arm.  
3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
Patients in Part A will receive either 300 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725751] (SC) . In the phase 2 study R668 -EE-1324, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg QW was 
demonstrated t o be efficacious with clinically significant improvements in histologic, endoscopic, 
and patient -reported symptoms after 12  weeks of treatment . Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725752] a 
favorable profile with no particular safety signal associated with use in th e EoE patient population .  
Patients in Part B will receive 300 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725753] (Q2W), 300 mg 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725754] . The 300 mg Q2W was chosen to provide dose -ranging 
information . Based on pharmacokinetic (PK) considerations,  this dose is expected to achieve 
target -saturating concentrations over the dosing interval, and hence provide clinical benefit . The 
approved dose regimen for treatment of AD is 300 mg Q2W . In addition, this dose regimen 
                                        VV-RIM-00127522-1.0 Approved - 05 Nov 2020 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_990794] a well un derstood and favorable safety profile . 
Approximately 2500 AD patients were exposed to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]; [ADDRESS_990795] been exposed 
to 300 mg QW for ≥[ADDRESS_990796] been exposed to 300 mg Q2W for ≥364 days as of the 
27 April 2016 biologics license ap plication cut -off. In completed/unblinded Phase 2/3 studies of 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_328660] (as of 30 September 2017), 2649 asthma patients were exposed to 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]; [ADDRESS_990797] been exposed to 300 mg Q2W for ≥[ADDRESS_990798] been 
exposed  for ≥1.[ADDRESS_990799] been exposed for ≥[ADDRESS_990800] significant covariate affecting the PK of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], with patients of a lower 
body we ight achieving higher concentrations of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] . In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 studies in AD 
(R668 -AD-1334, R668 -AD-1416, and R668 -AD-1224), adults with body weights of 41 kg or more 
received dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725755] 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW, which were found to be w ell tolerated 
for 16 to 52 weeks . In Study EFC13579, 33 adolescent patients with asthma (median age of 
14 years with a range of 12 to 17 years; median weight 55 kg) received dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg Q2W; 
a similar PK profile was observed between adolescent and adult patients with asthma.  
As dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg QW has not been studied in lighter patients, subjects (adults or adolescents) 
with body weight <40 kg will be excluded from the study.  
3.2.3.  Risk/Benefits of Participating in the Study  
Recognizing that the “Coronav irus Disease 2019” (COVID -19) pandemic will have an impact on

As of  [ADDRESS_990803] been enrolled into the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725757], asthma, chromic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp s (CRSwNP) , 
grass allergy,  peanut allergy, bullous pemphigoid, and EoE (Investigator's Brochure Version 14). 
Based upon currently available data, 1 important identified risk, “Systemic Hypersensitivity 
(including those events associated with immunogenicity),” has been established . One serious case 
each of serum sickness and serum sickness -like reaction (both associated with high anti -drug 
antibody [ADA] titers) were reported in adult AD studies, however none were seen in the asthma 
development program . Additionally, there has been o ne report of anaphylaxis considered related 
to study drug by [CONTACT_725838].  Based on the review of post -marketing data, 
signals of anaphylactic reaction and angioedema were confirmed and considered as adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs).  
A higher incidence of Injection Site reactions (ISRs) has been observed in the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] -treated 
subjects, consistent with the SC injection of a protein biologic . Most ISRs were mild to moderate 
in intensity, and less than 2% were severe or led to treatment discontinuation . The proportion of 
patients experiencing ISRs diminished over time during the treatment period.  
Conjunctivitis, Conjunctivitis Allergic, Conjunctivitis Bacterial, Blepharitis, Dry Eye, Eye 
Pruritus, Herpes Simplex (primarily mucocutaneous i n nature), and Oral Herpes have been 
identified as adverse drug reactions for the AD indication . There was no increase in incidence of 
these events observed in the completed asthma study. Conjunctivitis was also observed in the 
completed CRSwNP studies but  with lower incidence than in the AD studies and without keratitis 
or increase in other ophthalmic events. Most events were mild in intensity and transient in nature, 
and did not necessitate treatment discontinuation.  Based on the post -marketing safety dat a, events 
of angioedema, arthralgia, keratitis and ulcerative keratitis are now considered as ADRs.

 CONFIDENTIAL  5.1.1.  Part A  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Screening (Up to 12 Weeks)  
After adult patients provide informed consent and adolescent patients and/or their legal 
parents/legal guardians provide informed consent and informed assent (as appropriate), patients 
will be assessed for study eligibility at visit [ADDRESS_990811] a conﬁrmed diagnosis of EoE which may be established 
either by a prior historical biopsy showing ≥15 intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_725763] -power ﬁeld 
(eos/hpf) from at least one esophageal region after at least 8 weeks of treatment with a high -dose 
proton pump inhibitor (PPI) using any approved PPI [INVESTIGATOR_725764] s performed after approximately 
8 weeks of high -dose PPI [INVESTIGATOR_24859], 
which demonstrate ≥15 intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_725765]/hpf in at least 2 out of 3 esophageal regions (proximal, 
mid, and distal); see Figure  3 for endoscopy/biopsy procedure flow chart . Patients who are on PPIs 
during the screening period and are eligible to enroll in the study must continue  a high -dose PPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_725766] (see details in Section  7.2). Patients are allowed to switch among the 
approved background therapy options for high -dose PPI [INVESTIGATOR_725767].  
All patients who meet the other clinical and laboratory eligibility criteria will undergo endoscopy 
with biopsies at visit 2 (day -21±7) to establish a baseline reference measure . For patients without 
a historical b iopsy, the visit 2 biopsy will serve as both confirmation of EoE diagnosis and the 
baseline reference measure.  
All biopsies performed during this study will be evaluated by [CONTACT_24967] a central pathology 
laboratory who will be blinded to treatment assignment.  
Note:  Biopsy specimens from the stomach and/or duodenum will be obtained in all patients 
<18 years of age to rule out alternate etiologies of esophageal eosinophilia . Targeted, stomach, 
and/or duodenal biopsies will be obtained in adults only in the event of abnormal endoscopic 
findings (other than typi[INVESTIGATOR_725768]) or clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_725769] . All 
randomized patients found to have stomach and/or duodenal abnormalities at baseline will have 
follow -up stomach and/or duodena l biopsies at week 24 and week 52.  
After confirmation of EoE diagnosis, patients will be given an electronic diary (eDiary) to record 
dysphagia symptoms on a daily basis during the 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit (visit 3).  
Patients may be re -screened once if they fail the screening evaluation, unless the reason for screen 
failure is related to histologic or clinical disease severity inclusion criteria. The baseline endoscopy 
with biopsy and EoE -EREFS scoring will not be repeated for re -screened patient s. These results 
will continue to be valid baseline data . Re-screening must occur within 6 months of the screen 
failure.  
For patients whose DSQ diary compliance does not meet eligibility requirements within the 21 -day 
interval between Visit 2 and Visit 3 ( at least 11 daily entries during the 14 days immediately 
preceding the planned randomization date), randomization may be postponed as long as the total 
duration of the screening period does not exceed the 85 -day maximum.

A patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.  
The investigator and/or sponsor have the right  to withdraw a patient from the study if it is no longer 
in the interest of the patient to continue in the study, or if the patient’s continuation in the study 
places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a patient does not or cannot follow s tudy 
procedures) . An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided.

cap delivers 300  mg of study drug (2.0 mL of a 150 mg/mL solution)  
Placebo matching dupil umab is prepared in the same formulation without the addition of protein 
(ie, active substance, anti -IL-4Rα monoclonal Ab).  
In the double -blind placebo -controlled Parts A and B, as well as Part C, all patients will receive 
QW SC injections . For the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_81222] 300 mg SC Q2W group, in order to maintain the blind, there 
will be an SC injection of placebo in between dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725780] 2  groups (dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725781]) (see randomization/treatment assignment

If medically necessary (eg, for treatment of intolerable EoE symptoms), rescu e medications 
(systemic and/or swallowed topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930]) or emergency esophageal dilation are allowed 
for study patients in Parts  A, B, and C . An endoscopy with biopsy will be performed prior to the 
initiation of rescue therapy . Patients who under go an endoscopy with biopsy due to the initiation 
of rescue therapy will not undergo the scheduled end of treatment visit endoscopy/biopsy at weeks 
24 and 52 . Patients who receive rescue treatment during the double -blind period of the study will 
not be eli gible for the extended active treatment period unless an endoscopy with biopsy is 
performed prior to the initiation of rescue treatment. However, if the endoscopy with biopsies 
cannot occur due to COVID -19 restrictions, rescue treatment should not be delay ed, and these 
patients will be eligible for Part C. Part C treatment will be initiated per the schedule of events and 
only at an in -clinic visit .  
Patients receiving rescue therapy may continue to receive study drug . They will remain blinded 
and will be as ked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits for the double -blind treatment 
period and the follow -up period, and participate in all assessments for these visits according to the 
schedule of events specified in Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3, except for endoscopy/biopsy, as 
noted above . For the purpose of efficacy analyses, patients who receive rescue treatment during 
the study will be considered treatment failures.  
7.4. Dose Modifica tion and Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules  
7.4.1.  Dose Modification  
Dose modification for an individual patient is not allowed .  
7.4.2.  Study Drug Discontinuation  
Patients  who permanently discontinue from study drug during the double -blind treatment period 
will be a sked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits for the double -blind treatment 
period and follow -up period per the visit schedule.  
Patients  who permanently discontinue from study drug during the extended active treatment period 
will be asked to  return to the clinic for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule.  
Patients  who permanently discontinue from study drug and who opt to withdraw from the study 
will be asked to complete an early termination (ET) visit, per Section  8.1.2 . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug dosing will be permanently stopped in the event of:  
• Evidence of pregnancy  
• Anaphylactic reaction or other severe systemic reaction deemed related to study drug  
• Diagnosis of a malignancy during study, excluding carcinoma in situ of the cervix or 
squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin . Patient must be withdrawn for these lat ter 
malignancies if they cannot be adequately treated by [CONTACT_109413].

confirmed Gilbert’s Syndrome  
− Confirmed AST and/or ALT >5 × ULN (for more than 2 weeks)  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reasons for Temporary  Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug dosing may be temporarily discontinued in the event of:  
• Severe laboratory abnormalities (as noted in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) where a causal 
relationship to study drug can be reasonably excluded, (ie, an alternative cause is 
evident):  study drug will be discontinued but may be resumed when the laboratory 
abnormality is sufficiently normalized . At minimum, the laborat ory value(s) must 
return to a level that no longer meets the specified criteria for discontinuation, as 
defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . A decision to re sume study treatment will be made jointly 
by [CONTACT_173875] (medical monitor’s written approval is 
required).  
• An infection that requires parenteral treatment with antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral, 
antiparasitic, or antiprotozoal agen ts, or requires oral treatment with such agents for 
longer than 2 weeks  
• Other intercurrent illnesses or major surgery which could, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], present an unreasonable risk to the patient as a result of his/her continued 
participatio n in the study  
After the condition leading to suspension of dosing normalizes sufficiently, study treatment may 
resume at the discretion of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_197437].  
A decision to temporarily discontinue study dru g and/or to reinstitute study treatment should be 
discussed with the medical monitor . The investigator may suspend study treatment at any time, 
even without consultation with the medical monitor if the urgency of the situation requires

 CONFIDENTIAL  7.5. Method of Treatment Assignment  
In Part A, approximately 80 patients (40 per group) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg QW or placebo according to a central randomization scheme provided by [CONTACT_100689]/IWRS to the designated study pharmacist (or qualified designee) . 
In Part B, approximately 210 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 
300 mg QW, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg Q2W,  or placebo (approximately 70 patients per group) according 
to a central randomization scheme provided by [CONTACT_54537]/IWRS to the designated study pharmacist 
(or qualified designee).  
Randomization for both Part A and Part B will be stratified according to age at the time of the 
screening visit (≥12 to <18 years of age vs. ≥18 years of age) and use of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_725787] (yes 
vs. no).  
For patients entering Part C from Part B, those who are randomized to placebo during Part B will 
be re -randomized in a 1:1 ratio t o receive dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg QW or dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg Q2W 
(with matching placebo alternating with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725788] -blinding purposes) in Part C, and those who are randomized 
to one of the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725789]  B will remain on the same dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725790] C . Patients who received 300 mg Q2W in Part B will also continue with matching placebo 
alternating with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725791] r both groups for 
regimen -blinding purposes . Treatment assignment in Part C for all patients from Part B, regardless 
of their previously assigned treatment in Part B, will be managed by [CONTACT_54537]/IWRS to maintain 
blinding.  
7.5.1.  Blinding  
Study patients, the principal investigators, and study site personnel will remain blinded to all 
randomization assignments throughout the study . The blinded Regeneron Medical/Study Director, 
Study Monitor, and any other Regeneron and contract research organization (CRO) perso nnel who 
are in regular contact [CONTACT_725840].  
All study personnel will be blinded to data during each study part until the respective database 
lock. Part A will be unblinded while Part B i s ongoing.  
Blinded study drug kits coded with a medication numbering system will be used . In order to 
maintain the blind, lists linking these codes with product lot numbers will not be accessible to 
individuals involved in study conduct.  
Anti-drug antibody , drug concentration results, and any post -treatment tissue eosinophil counts 
and histologic results, and biomarker results (eotaxin -3, thymus and activation -regulated 
chemokine [TARC], total IgE and allergen -specific IgEs) will not be communicated to the sites, 
and the sponsor’s blinded operational team will not have access to results associated with patient 
identification until after the database is locked for the respective study part .

 CONFIDENTIAL  7.5.2.  Emergency Unblinding  
Unblinding of treatment assignment for a patient  may be necessary due to a medical emergency or 
any other significant medical event (eg, pregnancy).  
• If unblinding is required:  
− Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment.  
− Only the affected patients will be unblinded.  
− The designated study pharmacist(s)/designee at the study site will provide the 
treatment assignment to the investigator . If there is no study pharmacist, the 
investigator for the site will unblind the patient.  
− The investigator will notify Regeneron and/or designee as soon as possible after 
unblinding the patient.  
Treatment assignment is not to be provided to site personnel, other than the unblinded study 
pharmacist (when applicable), at any time during the conduct of the study, except in the case of a 
true emergency . In the event that there is no study pharmacist, the individual at the site fulfilling 
that role will be the only unblinded member of the site personnel.  
7.5.3.  Unblinding for Regulatory Reporting Purposes  
Treatment assignments for certain patients may be unblinded to Pharmacovigilance personnel for 
the purpose of regulatory reporting of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) 
to health authorities in accordance with local regulations.  
7.6. Treatment Logistics and Accountability  
7.6.1.  Packaging, Lab eling, and Storage  
A medication numbering system will be used to label blinded investigational study drug . Lists 
linking medication numbers with product lot numbers will be maintained by [CONTACT_25006] (or 
companies) responsible for study drug packaging . In or der to maintain the blind, these lists will 
not be accessible to individuals involved in study conduct.  
Study drug will be stored at the site at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC; storage instructions will be 
provided in the pharmacy manual.  
7.6.2.  Supply and Disposit ion of Treatments  
Study drug will be shipped at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC to the investigator or designee at regular 
intervals or as needed during the study . At specified time points during the study (eg, interim site 
monitoring visits), at the site clos e-out visit, and following drug reconciliation and documentation 
by [CONTACT_25007], all opened and unopened study drug will be returned to the sponsor or designee 
for destruction, unless it’s specified that the site may perform their own destruction.

1. For patients without a satisfactory prior endoscopy/biopsy (eg, histological criteria were 
not met, or the biopsy was not performed while patient was on at least 8  weeks of high -dose 
PPI [CONTACT_221062]), the screening period will be extended for up to 12  weeks (day  -85) to allow 
for at least 8 weeks of high -dose PPI [INVESTIGATOR_725793]/biopsies . 
For all other patients, the screening period will be shorter, with sufficient time t o allow 
screening assessments and laboratory test results to be available prior to the baseline 
endoscopy/biopsies.  
2. The endoscopy/EoE -EREFS /biopsy procedures should be performed after all other 
efficacy and safety assessments.  
a. The baseline endoscopy with b iopsies should be performed at approximately 
day -21±7  days to allow for availability of the intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_725794]  1. For patients without a 
satisfactory prior historical endoscopy/biopsy , the baseline endoscopy/biopsies must 
be performed after at least 8 weeks of high -dose PPI . Patients may be randomized as

confirmation of menopausal status) and serology tests (HIV Ab, HBsAg, HBcAb, HCV Ab, and 
TB). Tuberculosis testing will be performed on a country -by-country basis according to local 
guidelines if required by [CONTACT_25016] . 
8.2.2.  Efficacy Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Endoscopy with EoE-EREFS  and Biopsies, and Photographs  
During the endoscopy procedure, EoE -EREFS and biopsies will be performed in the  listed order . 
Training will be provided to study sites on performing this procedure . All biopsies performed 
during this study will be evaluated by a qualified central histology laboratory . Photographs and/or 
video may be taken as part of the endoscopic pr ocedure and biopsy collection. For Part B enrolled 
patients, video imaging should be collected for EoE -EREFS analysis and scoring by a centralized 
reading center.  
The endoscopy/EoE -EREFS/biopsy procedure will be performed per the Schedule of Events in 
Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3. 
EoE-EREFS  
The EoE esophageal characteristics will be analyzed based on the EoE -EREFS, a validated scoring 
system for inflammatory and remodeling features of disease using  both overall scores and scores 
for each individual characteristic  (Hirano, 2013 ). The proximal and distal esophageal regions will 
be scored separately; the score for each region ranges from 0 to 9 and the overall score ranges  from 
0 to 18 . The major esophageal features include:   
• Edema (absent, present)  
• Rings (absent, mild, moderate, severe)  
• Exudates (absent, mild, severe)  
• Furrows (absent, mild, severe)  
• Stricture (absent, present)  
EoE-EREFS should be completed by [CONTACT_725849]. 
For Part B enrolled patients, EoE -EREFS will be performed by [CONTACT_725850][INVESTIGATOR_725795] a centralized reading center who will provide EoE -EREFS analysis and 
scoring from  endoscopy imaging. The centralized reading will be used for analysis, if available. If

 CONFIDENTIAL  In addition to the major features above, data for the following minor features will also be captured 
by [CONTACT_725852]:  
• Crepe paper esophagus (mucosal fragility or laceration upon passage of diagnostic 
endosc ope): absent, present  
• Narrow caliber esophagus (reduced luminal diameter of the majority of the tubular 
esophagus): absent, present  
• Stricture diameter  
Mucosal changes associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease will also be recorded using the 
Los Angeles classification system for erosions (No Erosions or Grade A, B, C, or D).  
Biopsies  
Biopsies will be obtained by [CONTACT_25031] (visit 2, day -21 ± 7), week  24 
and week 52 visits, and immediately prior to start of rescue medi cation or procedures during the 
double -blind treatment period . The screening endoscopy should be performed at a time during the 
screening period that will allow results to be available prior to day -1 for assessment of eligibility . 
A total of 9  mucosal pin ch biopsies will be collected at each time point from 3 esophageal regions:  
3 proximal, 3  mid, and 3  distal . Two samples from each region will be used for the histology 
(needed for study inclusion criteria, as well as endpoint assessment) and other tissue  analyses (may 
include but not limited, to immunohistochemistry [IHC], RNA scope (in situ hybridization), and 
RNA sequencing) . To participate in the study, patients must have a peak intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_725796] ≥15 eos/hpf (400×) in at least [ADDRESS_990845] sample from each region will be 
processed for RNA analyses .  
In addition, biopsy specimens from the stomach and/or duodenum will be obtained at visi t 2 in all 
patients <18  years of age to rule out alternate etiologies of esophageal eosinophilia . Targeted, 
stomach and/or duodenal biopsies will be obtained in adults only in the event of abnormal 
endoscopic findings (other than typi[INVESTIGATOR_725768]) or c linical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_725769] . 
Gastric biopsy samples should include [ADDRESS_990846] stomach and/or duodenal abnormalities at

required by [CONTACT_25032], biopsy samples will be processed and analyzed by [CONTACT_27396], and the processed specimen will be sent to the central pathology laboratory for central 
reading . These samples will be assessed for peak eos per hpf and Eo E Grade Scores and Stage 
Scores will be assigned . EoE Grade and Stage Scores evaluate eight features: eosinophil density, 
basal zone hyperplasia, eosinophil abscesses, eosinophil surface layering, dilated intercellular 
spaces, surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_64633] , dyskeratotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], and lamina propria fibrosis 
(absent/present). Additional analyses on these data may also be performed.

EndoFLIP  
A substudy of esopohageal distensibility utilizing the endolumenal functional lumen imaging 
probe (EndoFLIP, Medtronic, [LOCATION_003]) may also be performed at selected North American sites  in 
approximately [ADDRESS_990847] be 
performed before biopsies are collected. Procedural order should be: EREF S/imaging, EndoFLIP, 
then biopsies . The EndoFLIP device is a catheter -based procedure that measures the cross -
sectional area at multiple sites along the esophagus with simultaneous intraluminal pressure 
recordings during volumetric distension of the esopha gus. The analyses of cross sectional area 
versus pressure relationships of the esophagus allow for determination of esophageal compliance 
as well as the distensibility plateau. The distensibility plateau has been shown to be significantly 
reduced in adult patients with EoE compared to healthy controls ( Kwiatek, 2011 ). Moreover, the 
esophageal distensibility has been associated with outcomes of both food impaction and need for 
esophageal dilation ( Nicodème, 2013 ). De tails of the EndoFLIP procedure will be provided in the 
study regulatory binders.  
Photographs and/or Video  
Photographs and/or video may be taken by [CONTACT_725853] . A copy of these photographs and/or video  will be requested from the study sites . Details

and scoring by a centralized reading center.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) - Patient -reported Outcome (PRO)  
The DSQ is a validated PRO that has been used in clinical studies to measure the frequency and 
intensity of dysphagia ( Hudgens, 2017 ). For patients  who respond “No” to Question 1 (“Since you 
woke up this morning, did you eat solid food?”), a modification was made to the DSQ by [CONTACT_7939] 
a follow -up question to probe if patients avoided solid food due to their problems with swallowing 
solid food . This mo dified DSQ will be completed by [CONTACT_725854] . A copy of the DSQ is provided in the study regulatory 
binders.  
The DSQ uses a daily recall period and comprises [ADDRESS_990848] eaten solid foods 
(‘Yes’ to question 1: “Since you woke up this morning, did you eat solid food?”) in order to 
proceed with the questionnaire . If a patient ans wers “No” to question 1, the remaining items on 
the DSQ are not scored . Patients who respond “No” to question 2 (“Since you woke up this 
morning, has food gone down slowly or been stuck in your throat?”) are given a score of zero, and 
do not go on to answe r question 3 (the diary is recorded as completed for that day) . Those who

 CONFIDENTIAL  respond ‘Yes’ to questions 1 and 2 move on to question 3, which is scored on a 5 -point scale that 
infers severity of dysphagia based on the patient’s action to alleviate symptoms, ra nging from no 
action to seeking medical attention . The DSQ scoring algorithm is therefore constructed from the 
responses to questions 2 and 3, to ensure that the final score is driven by [CONTACT_725855] . To calculate the DSQ score, a minimum of 8  diary entries is required for each 14 -day 
period to derive a standardized total score based on the cumulative scores through 14 days . DSQ 
scores can theoretically range from 0 to 84, with a lower score indicating less -frequent or less -
severe  dysphagia.  
Although Question 4 related to pain was included in the DSQ, it is considered as a standalone item 
for exploratory analysis.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  EoE Impact Questionnaire (EoE -IQ) 
The EoE -IQ is a disease -specific measure of health -related QOL in EoE patients deve loped by [CONTACT_103] . The EoE -IQ measures EoE impact on emotional, social, work and school, and sleep 
aspect of a patient.  
This assessment will be recorded by [CONTACT_725856]  1, Table  2, and Table  3. A copy of the EoE -IQ is provided in the study regulatory

[IP_ADDRESS].  Type 2 Inflammatory and Disease -Related Circulating Biomarkers  
Eotaxin -3, Thymus and Activation Regulated Chemokine (TARC), and IgE (total and specific) are 
measures of type 2 inflammation, and are known pharmacodynamic markers for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24918], 
asthma, and nasal polyposis.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Eotaxin -3 
Eotaxin -3 (also known as CCL26), an eosinophil chemokine, is up -regulated in esophageal mucosa 
of EoE patients relative to controls (Blanchard, 2006 ), and variants in the gene have been 
associated with disease risk . Eotaxin -3 mRNA expression in skin is down -regulated by [CONTACT_24983][INVESTIGATOR_24920] (Hamilton, 2014 ). Circulating concentrations have been shown to decrease in asthm a and 
nasal polyposis patients treat ed with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] . Eotaxin -3 will be measured in heparinized plasma

9.4.4.  Reporting Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from the Study  
All AEs that lead to a patient’s withdrawal from the study must be reported to the sponsor’s 
Medical/Study Director within [ADDRESS_990868] finding should be reported as an 
AE include:  
• The test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
• The test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or  
• The test result leads to a change in dosing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments), discontinuation from the study, sig nificant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other therapy  
Contact [CONTACT_22951]/Study Director in the event the investigator feels that an abnormal test finding 
should be reported as an AE, although it does not meet any of the above criteria.  
Repeatin g an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE.  
Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalities will be assesse d according to the scale outlined 
in Section  9.5.1 . 
9.4.6.  Follow -up 
Adverse  event information will be collected until the patient’s last study visit.  
Serious adverse event information will be followed up until the event is resolved or considered 
chronic and/or stable.  
9.5. Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
9.5.1.  Evaluation of Severity  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  
Mild:  Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient’s normal functioning level . It 
may be an annoyance . Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptoms, but may 
be given because of personality of the patient.  
Moderate:   Produces some  impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health . It is 
uncomfortable or an embarrassment . Treatment for symptom may be needed.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Severe:   Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a definite hazard 
to the subject’s hea lth. Treatment for symptom may be given and/or patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity should be based on the degree of 
physiological impairment the value indicates.  
Injection Site Reactions  
The severity of ISRs will b e graded according to the following scale (semi -colon indicates “or” 
within description of grade):  
Mild :  Pain that does not interfere with activity; mild discomfort to touch; <5 cm of erythema or 
induration that does not interfere with activity  
Moderate :  Pain that requires repeated use of non -narcotic pain reliever >24 hours or interferes 
with activity; discomfort with movement; 5.1 cm to 10 cm erythema or induration or induration 
that interferes with activity  
Severe :  Pain that requires any use of narco tic pain reliever or that prevents daily activity; 
significant discomfort at rest; >10 cm erythema or induration; prevents daily activity; requires ER 
visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis  
9.5.2.  Evaluation of Causality  
Relationship of Adve rse Events to Study Drug:  
The relationship of AEs to study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_73486], and will be a 
clinical decision based on all available information . The following question will be addressed:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_5257]?  
The possible answers are:  
Not Related:  There is no reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_5257].  
Related:  There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been cau sed by [CONTACT_50464].  
The investigator should justify the causality assessment of each SAE.  
A list of factors to consider when assessing the relationship of AEs to study drug is provided below . 
Please note that t his list is not exhaustive.  
Is there a reas onable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_5257]?

The sponsor will request information to justify the causality assessment of SAEs, as needed.  
9.6. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study patient at his/her site(s) as per the req uirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP) . Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion . The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites . The Medical/Study  Director will have primary responsibility 
for the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by [CONTACT_25047] (eg, 
Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management (PVRM); Biostatistics and Data Management) . Safety 
monitoring will be performe d on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on a 
periodic cumulative aggregate basis.  
In addition, the DMC will conduct safety reviews for all dupi[INVESTIGATOR_161267] (see details in 
Section  5.3.1 ).

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.7. Investigator Alert Notification  
Regeneron (or designee) will inform all investigators participating in this clinical trial, as well as 
in any other clinical trial using the same investigati onal drug, of any SAE that meets the relevant 
requirements for expedited reporting (an AE that is serious, unexpected based on the reference 
safety information in the Investigator’s Brochure, and has a reasonable suspected causal 
relationship to the study drug).  
10. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the basis for the SAPs for the study . The part -specific SAP(s) may be revised 
during the study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make changes 
to adapt to unexpected issues in study  execution and data that may affect the planned analyses . 
The final SAP(s) will be issued before the database is locked for respective part.  
Analysis variables are listed in Section  4. 
Results from different parts of this study will be summarized and/or analyzed separately unless 
otherwise specified.  
10.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
For comparisons of each of the 2 d upi[INVESTIGATOR_725804],  the fol lowing hypotheses 
of the co-primary endpoint s will be tested, where pd is the true proportion of patients achieving 
peak esophageal intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_24764] ≤6  eos/hpf at week 24 and μ d is the true mean 
change from baseline in the DSQ total score at week 24 in each of the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24769] ; and p p 
and μp are the corresponding true values in the placebo group.  
• Null hypothesis (H 0):  p p = p d or μp = μ d, ie, the proportion of patients achievi ng peak 
esophageal intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_24764] ≤6 eos/hpf at week  24 OR the mean 
change from baseline in the DSQ total score at week 24 is the same between the 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_611196].  
• Alternative hypothesis (H 1):  p p ≠ pd and μp ≠ μd, ie, the proportion of patients 
achieving peak esophageal intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_24764] ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 
AND  the mean change from baseline in the DSQ total score at week 24 is different 
between the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_611196].  
10.2. Justifi cation of Sample Size  
The assumptions used in sample size calculations for Part A are based on results from a phase 2 
study of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (R668 -EE-1324) and reported data of a phase 2 study of budesonide 
(Dellon,  2017 ) in patients  with EoE as follows:  
• In the study of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], a treatment difference of 65.2% was observed in the 
proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_24764] 
≤6 eos/hpf after 12 weeks of treatment (placebo 0% vs. dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 65.2% ). DSQ was 
not assessed in this study . The overall dropout rate was 8.5% during the 12 -week 
treatment period.

 CONFIDENTIAL  • In the study of budesonide oral suspension, a treatment difference of 36% was observed 
in the proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal int raepi[INVESTIGATOR_697693] ≤6 eos/hpf after 12 weeks of treatment (placebo 3% vs. budesonide 39%) . The mean 
(standard deviation [SD]) of change from baseline in DSQ total score at week 12 
was -7.5 (10.7) in placebo and -14.3 (13.0) in the budesonide group, corresponding to 
a treatment group difference of -6.8. The overall dropout rate was 6.5% during the 
12-week treatment period.  
With the consideration that a higher dropout rate may be observed for a longer treatment period, a 
dropout rate of 15% is a ssumed for all sample size calculations provided below.  
Part A  
The planned sample size for Part A is approximately 40 patients in each treatment group such that 
for the comparison of each dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725724]:  
• This sample size will yield >99% power to detect a treatment difference of 62% in the 
proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_24764] 
≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 (placebo 3% vs. dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 65%) at a 2 -sided significance level 
of 5% using Fisher’s exact test .  
• With respect to the treatment group difference in the mean change from baseline in 
DSQ total score, assuming a common SD of 13.0, this sample size is expected to 
generate a 95% confidence interval whose half -width is 5.7 . If the true treatment 
difference is -9.0 points, the statistical power for the co -primary endpoint of DSQ will 
be 80% using a two -sample t -test. 
Part B  
The study includes two double -blind placebo -controlled randomized parts: Part A and Part B . An 
objective  of Part A was to evaluate the Part B sample size. Part A database lock occurred on 
20 May 2020 and the study results for the co -primary endpoints from Part A are below:  
• The proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_697693] ≤6  eos/hpf at 24 weeks was 5.1% in placebo group and 59.5% in dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300mg 
QW group with a treatment difference of 55.4%  
• The mean (standard deviation [SD]) of change from baseline in DSQ total score at week 
24 was -9.6 (15.2) in placebo and -21.9 (14 .6) in the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300mg QW group with 
a treatment group difference of -12.3.  
Based on the Part A study results, the planned sample size for Part B is approximately 70 patients 
in each treatment group such that for the comparison of each dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725724]:  
• This sample size will yield >99.9% power to detect a treatment difference of 55.4% in 
the proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_24764] 
≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 between placebo (5.1% ) and each dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725805] 
(59.5%) at a 2 -sided significan ce level of 5% using Fisher’s exact test.  
• This sample size will provide >99.9% power to detect a treatment difference of -12.3 
points in the mean change from baseline in the total DSQ score to week 24 at a 2-sided 
significance level of 5% using a two -sample t -test, assuming a common SD of 15.0.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Therefore, the sample size of 70  patients/arm will provide an overall power of >99.9% (99.9% × 
99.9%) for the co -primary endpoints, assuming no negative correlatio n between the two endpoints. 
In Part B, the same treatment effect for the two 300 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725725] (ie, QW and 
Q2W) is assumed.  
Sample size calculations were made using nQuery Advisor 7.0.  
10.3. Analysis Sets  
10.3.1.  Efficacy Analysis Sets  
Part A and Part B  
For Part A and Part B, the efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the study part -specific full 
analysis set (FAS) that includes all randomized patients in the corresponding study part . Efficacy 
analyses for these 2 parts will be based on the treatment al located by [CONTACT_725869] . Analysis on the FAS will be considered to be primary.  
The study -part specific per protocol set (PPS) will include all patients in the corresponding FAS 
except for those who are excluded due to important protocol violations.  
All efficacy endpoints will be evaluated on the FAS; the co -primary endpoints will also b e 
evaluated on the PPS .  
Part C  
The efficacy endpoints in Part C (the extended active treatment period) will be summarized for all 
patients who received any extended active treatment study drug in that part.  
10.3.2.  Safety Analysis Set  
For Part A and Part B, the s tudy part -specific safety analysis set (SAF) includes all randomized 
patients who received any study drug; it is based on the treatment received (as treated) . Treatment 
compliance/administration and all clinical safety variables will be analyzed using the SAF.  
For safety analyses of the Part C extended active treatment period, only a subset of SAF will be 
included, which is defined as those patients who received at least [ADDRESS_990869] dose of study drug.  
10.4. Statistical Methods  
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics will include the following information:  the number 
of patients reflected in the c alculation (n), mean, median, SD, minimum, first and third quartiles, 
and maximum .

10.4.1.  Patient Disposition  
The following will be provided:  
• The total number of screened patients: met the inclusion criteria regarding the target 
indication and signed the ICF  
• The total number of randomized patients:  received a randomization number  
• The total number of patients in each analysis set (eg, FAS, provi ded in Section  10.3)

Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_17673], 
and by [CONTACT_25048] .  
10.4.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The co -primary endpoint of proportion of patients achieving a histologic response of esophageal 
intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_24764] ≤6 eos/hpf at week 24 visit will be analyzed using the Cochran -
Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test to assess the difference in the proportion of responders in the FAS 
adjusting for the randomization stratification factors . In anticipation of sparse responders in the 
placebo group, the Fisher’s exact test will  be performed as a supportive analysis to confirm the 
results from the CMH test.  
The co -primary endpoint of absolute change from baseline in the DSQ total score at week 24 will 
be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model for the FAS with tre atment group, 
randomization stratification factor, and relevant baseline measurement as covariates included in 
the model . The cumulative proportion of responders over the entire range of possible cut -off points 
will be graphed to present the between -treatm ent-group differences at any responder level.  
The intercurrent events, strategies, and the corresponding missing data handling approaches for 
the primary estimands of interest for the co -primary endpoints are provided in Table  4.

 CONFIDENTIAL  If a patient has missing value for the histological response (peak esophageal intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_24758] ≤6 eos/hpf)  at week 24 visit due to reasons not related to COVID -19, the 
patient will be classified as a non -responder at week 24. Multiple imputation (MI) will be used for 
missing histological response due to COVID -19. 
If a patient has missing value for the DSQ tota l score at week 24, their missing data will be imputed 
by [CONTACT_111012] (MI) based on similar patients who remained in the trial with observed 
values relevant to analysis . Similarity is based on randomized treatment group, baseline value, 
stratificat ion factors, and available post -baseline values . To account for the uncertainty in the 
imputation, missing data at week 24 will be imputed 50 times to generate 50  complete datasets by 
[CONTACT_725870] (SAS) .  
MI will follow the 2 steps below using a random seed number of 6681774 in both steps:  
• Step 1:  Use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to fill in intermittent 
missing values (ie, those missing values followed by [CONTACT_725871]) so that  a monotone missing pattern will be formed.  
• Step 2:  Using the datasets from step 1, missing data through week [ADDRESS_990870] -baseline measurement up to week 24 included 
in the  regression model.  
Once imputations are made, the week 24 data of each of the complete datasets will be analyzed 
using ANCOVA . The results from the 50 analyses on the complete datasets will be combined to 
generate a valid overall statistical inference acc ording to Rubin’s formula (Rubin, 1987 ) using the 
SAS MIANALYZE procedure.  
Sensitivity analyses will assess alternative methods to impute missing data under the assumption 
of missing at random or missing not at random . For the esophageal -intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_018] -eosinophil 
responder analysis, alternative methods may include utilizing peak esophageal intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_725807] . For the analysis of change 
from baseline in the DSQ total score, alternative methods may include mixed -effect model for 
repeated measures (MMRM), last observation carried forward (LOCF), and tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275] . 
Sensitivity analyses will also include an analysis without setting data post -rescue to mi ssing. 
Sensitivity analyses may include but are not limited to the methods specified above. Details will 
be specified in the SAP.  
Handling of missing data or delayed procedures due to COVID -[ADDRESS_990871] will be 
detailed in the SAP.

 CONFIDENTIAL  eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf, including the method to handle missing data and planned 
sensitivity analyses.  
Continuous endpoint s: 
For Part A enrolled patients, EoE -EREFS assessed by [CONTACT_725872] (no 
centralized readings available). For Part B enrolled patients, the primary analysis of EoE -EREFS 
will be based on centralized readings, if available. If t he centralized reading is not available, the 
EoE-EREFS performed by [CONTACT_725873].  
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints at week [ADDRESS_990872] -baseline up to week 
24 (eg, percent change in DSQ score from baseline to week 24), missing data will be imputed by 
[CONTACT_725874] -primary endpoint . Sensitivity 
analyses similar to those specified for the DSQ co -primary endpoint will be conducted.  
For continuous efficacy data that are to be measured only once post -baseline up to week 24 
(eg, percent change in peak eos/hpf from baseline to week 24), missing values at week 24 will be 
imputed with patient’s baseline value or the available post -baseline value, whichever is worse, 
ie, a worst observation carried forward (WOCF) approach . MI approach is not suitable for 
handling missing data in this case due to the fact that the complete case patients will not have 
measurements available at the time points when measurements are obtained for ET patients 
(designed to be at their ET visits) to enable the imputat ion of week 24 missing values for early 
terminated patients . A sensitivity analysis, using the LOCF approach to impute missing values at 
week 24, will be performed.  
To account for use of rescue treatment, data will be imputed by [CONTACT_725875] 24

EoEHSS from baseline 
to week 24  EoE will be included in 
the analyses.  
Treatment discontinuation  Treatment policy 
strategy: Data collected 
after the patient 
discontinued treatment 
will be included in the 
analyses.  
Sensitivity analyses will also include an analysis without setting data post -rescue to missing.  
Subgroup analysis (eg, by  [CONTACT_551]) will also be performed  and details will be specified in SAP . 
For transcriptome endpoints, the Wilcoxon rank -sum test will be used to test if the difference in 
median NES of the relative change from baseline to week 24 between the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24939]. P -values will be reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints in Part C  
Efficacy variables measured in Part C will use the last non -missing value prior to the first dose of 
extended active treatment study  drug as their baseline assessments . These efficacy variables will 
be summarized with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_725877] C . Inferential statistics will 
only be conducted as needed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Multiplicity Considerations  
Part A and Part B will be car ried out as [ADDRESS_990873] separate and independent 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05. In the 
event that sample size of Part B is changed based on observed data from Part A, there will be no 
alpha adjustment as data from Part A are considered external information to Part B.  
To demonstrate efficacy for a dupi[INVESTIGATOR_197460], both of the individual co -primary 
endpoints need to be statistically significant at the 2 -sided 0.05 level for that  dose regimen.  
Part A : Statistical significance of both co -primary efficacy endpoints will be required before 
drawing inferential conclusions about any secondary efficacy endpoints . The hierarchical order of 
secondary endpoints will be specified in Part A  SAP.  
Part B : Type I error rate will be controlled using a hierarchical testing procedure . The co -primary 
endpoints will be tested for the comparison of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725810], the tes ting will proceed to the co -primary endpoints of 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q2W, or the secondary endpoints of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_710187], with the exact order to be 
specified in Part B SAP.  
As Part C data will be summarized using descriptive statistics, there is no multiplicity issue.

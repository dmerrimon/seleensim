 3. INTRODUCTION AND RAT IONALE  
  
3.1. Introduction  
 
Eyenovia, the Sponsor of this study, is a specialty pharmaceutical company pursuing development of a 
variety of ocular topi[INVESTIGATOR_5910] , including a pupil dilation medication with a fixed combination 
formulation of phenylephrine 2.5% and tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% , for microdose delivery.  Eyenovia’s drug 
formulations are administered  using a proprietary system called the Microdose Delivery Dispenser 
(MiDD) , which is designed to accurately deliver precise low -volume doses of topi[INVESTIGATOR_401030] .  
 
Phenyle phrine is an α 1-adrenegic receptor sympathetic agonist that has been used for more than 70  years 
to dilate the pupil for diagnostic, therapeutic, and surgical procedures. Systemically, phenylephrine , when 
administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_401031], is known to cause serious cardiovascular reactions 
including ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and elevated blood pressure in some patients1,2. 
These risks are especially relevant when more  mydriasis is required,  and phenylephrine  10% is used , 
rather than  the lower 2.5% concentration.   Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_401032] a synthetic derivative of tropic acid that 
became available for ocular use in [ZIP_CODE].  It is an anticholinergic mydriatic agent that acts by [CONTACT_401063].  As an anticholinergic related to 
atropi[INVESTIGATOR_401033], systemically absorbed tropi[INVESTIGATOR_401034] p otential to cause 
rare but potentially serious adverse events, particularly in the pediatric population.  
 
Eyenovia’s formulation ( fixed combination phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ) is a proprietary 
investigational product that utilizes microdosing technology to facilitate accurate topi[INVESTIGATOR_401035] a controlled quantity of mydriatic agents in a precise manner  to maximize therapeutic control and 
minimize systemic absorption and loss to washout.  
 
3.2. Pupil Dilation  
 
A variety of ophthal mic evaluations require pupil dilation to provide an unobstructed view of the lens, 
retina, and optic nerve. The degree of pupil dilation required depends on the procedure being performed.   
For r outine diagnostic procedures , and in conditions where short term pupil dilation is desired, the goal is 
to achieve adequate mydriasis for visualization with minimal cycloplegic effect.

 3.3. Existing Mydriatic Options  
 
Dilation of the pupil is currently produ ced with parasympathetic anticholinergics  such as tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] , 
cyclopentolate, homatropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050] ; or with sympathetic agonists (sympathomimetics) such as 
phenylephrine4. 
 
Parasympathetic antagonists block acetylcholine activation of muscarinic receptors, thereby [CONTACT_401064]. The result is an enlarged pupil; however, at the same time , the ciliary muscle 
that regulates visual accommodation can be paralyzed, resulting in blurry vision that can persist for hours. 
Additionall y, rare but serious systemic side effects have been observed after ocular administration of 
anticholinergics such as tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424], particularly in infants and children5,6. 
 
Sympathetic agonists produce dilation by [CONTACT_401065]. Although phenylephrine does not induce blurry vision, at lower concentrations ; e.g., 2.5%, 
it generally does not dilate the pupil as well as parasympathetic agonists. Where full mydriasis is required, 
higher concentratio ns of phenylephrine ; e.g., 10%, are required.  Higher concentration phenylephrine , 
however, has been known to cause cardiovascular effects after systemic absorption , which include  
hypertension, tachycardia, and more rarely, arrhythmia and stroke, especiall y in patients with pre -existing 
heart conditions7.  
 
To maximize dilation efficacy and minimize side effects, most ophthalmologists employ a combination of 
both classes of mydriatic agents.  
 
3.4. Phenylephrine and Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_401036] f or Pupil Dilation  
 
Eyenovia’s MiDD  is designed to deliver precise microvolumes of topi[INVESTIGATOR_401037] a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_401038] -generated microdroplet spray. When the dispenser is actuated, a precisely calibrated single 
microdose is delivered.  It is anticipated that microdosing of ophthalm ic drugs will enhance drug 
bioavailability and efficacy while minimizing systemic absorption and any associated side effects.  
 
Phenylephrine ophthalmic solution is currently marketed with 2.5% and 10% concentrations  (Paragon 
BioTeck; Akorn , Inc.) for dilation of the pupil.  Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_401039] 0.5% and 1.0% concentrations (Alcon Laboratories; Bausch & Lomb; Akorn, Inc.).  
Eyenovia’s fixed combination phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution formulation uses 
US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )-approved formulations of phenylephrine  2.5% and tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 
1.0%.  The drug is administered in approximately [ADDRESS_505672] and intraocular lens surgery:

 containing a combination of phenylephrin e and tropi[INVESTIGATOR_401040] (Mydrin -
P, Japan; Phenyltrope, Canada) ; no similar drugs are formulated for microdosing.  
 
Ocular microdosing with the MiDD  has been evaluated in humans using phenylephrine  2.5%, 
phenylephrine  10%, and tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1.0% solutions , individually.   
 
3.5. Ophthalmic Microdosing  
 
The rationale for Eyenovia’s fixed combination phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution  
development is the desire to optimiz e mydriasis while reducing systemic side effects, improving local 
tolerability, and decreasing the amount of medication lost to drainage from increased tear turnover rate.  
 
The average tear volume of an adult eye is 6−7  μL8,9. The estimated maximum volume of eyedrops that 
the cul de sac can contain, albeit momentarily, is approximately 30 μL ; this is reduced to 10 µL with 
normal blinking10.  The typi[INVESTIGATOR_401041] (either unit dose or multidose) , however,  provides drops that 
range from 25  μL to >  [ADDRESS_505673]. Ophthalmol.

effects, improve patient comfort, and minimize drug dilution and spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]. Studies comparing microdosed 
phenylephrine and cyclopentolate to traditional eyedrops (26  ‒ 30 µL  drop size) in premature babies18 
and in full -term infants19 have shown equivalent pupil dilation with drop sizes ranging from 5  ‒ 8 µL20,21 
while reducing systemic levels by [CONTACT_726] 50%22. 
 
Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424]  1.0% spray application caused similar pupil dilation as the sa me solution delivered as an 
eyedrop, but with less discomfort23 .  The main reason microdosing has not become the accepted method

EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN -MYD -TP-[ADDRESS_505678] DESCRIPTION  
 
This study  will evaluate the  safety and efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_401046] a fixed 
combination of phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1%  ophthalmic solution for mydriasis in routine 
diagnostic procedures and in conditions where short -term pupil  dilati on is desired.  
 
4.1. Findings from Non -Clinical and Clinical Studies  
 
Detailed information on nonclinical and clinical studies of fixed combination phenylephrine 2.5% -
tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1%  ophthalmic solution is pro vided in the Investigator Brochure  (EYN -MYD -TP-
31/32) . 
4.2. How Provided  
Eyenovia’s fixed combination phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution  is contained 
sterile in the Eyenovia MiDD , which i s designed  to accurately deliver precise low -volume doses of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_401047].  As shown in Figure 2, t he MiDD is composed of a “cartridge 
assembly” (shown in white in the the image below) and the base unit (shown in gray in the image 
below) .   
 
 
 
Figure 2: Eyenovia MiDD  Front (L) and Back (R) View  
 
Figure 3 shows a diagram of the MiDD base unit and cartridge assembl y.  The cartridge assembly is the 
primary container closure system, which contains a vial filled with sterile fixed combination 
phenylephrine 2.5% - tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution.  At the time of initial MiDD actuation, the 
seal on the vial is punctured t o allow the drug to flow to the MiDD delivery system.  The cartridge 
assembly also contains a pi[INVESTIGATOR_401038] -delivery system designed to drive delivery of the drug through the Spray 
Nozzle in discrete pulses repeated in a discrete cycle of duration ≤ 100 millisecon ds, which is the average 
involuntary blink response time.

Prior to initial MiDD  use, fixed combination phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% solution is aseptically 
transferred from the 2R vial in which it is received into the MiDD vial, the MiDD vial is inserted into the 
cartridge assembly, the cartridge and base are clipped together , and the seal on the vial containing the 
drug is punctured  by [CONTACT_401067] .  Puncture of this seal creates a fluid path for the 
drug.  Depression and release of the Load Button 5 times primes the system for drug delivery.  At the time 
of dosing, the Load Button is again pressed and released to activate the pi[INVESTIGATOR_401048].  When the Dose Button  is pressed, approximately 8 µL of the drug is delivered 
through the Spray Nozzle to the cornea.   
4.3. Route of Administration, Dosage, Regimen, Treatment Period( s) 
The study medication will be administered in accordance with the treatment assignment schedule on a 
single day in the clinic by [CONTACT_401068].  Two sprays of fixed combination phenylephrine

EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN -MYD -TP-[ADDRESS_505687] be used for administration of informed consent.  Dependent on IRB 
requirements for subjects under 18 years of age , an IRB -approved study assent form may be supplemental 
to the study ICF.   
 
The investigator or designee will explain  the study purpose, procedures and responsibilities to the 
potential participant and provide sufficient opportunity to ask questions, while allowing adequate time for 
consideration of the information provided.  Written consent  (and assent, if applicable)  for study 
participation must be present prior to initiation of any study -specific procedure ; subjects will be 
considered enrolled in the study upon their (and/or their parent’s/guardian’s, if applicable) signature [CONTACT_401100](s) .  It is the responsi bility of the Investigator to complete the informed consent process, 
maintain a copy of the signed consent/assent forms  in the subject’s medical records, and provide each 
subject with a copy of their fully -executed consent documents . 
 
9.2. Subject Selection and Screening Procedures  
 
Study participants will be recruited from the Investigator’s  patient population, referrals, or other outreach 
methods .  Written recruitment materials directed to potential study participants must be approved by [CONTACT_5040].    
 
Where p ossible, candidate participants  may be pre -screened via review of their medical charts to evaluate 
potential eligibility based on study inclusion/exclusion criteria.   During the informed consent discussion, 
the potential participant’s willingness and abili ty to meet the follow -up requirements will be evaluated.  
Those  who elect to sign the study consent form(s)  will be considered enrolled in the study and given a 
study identification code.   At/after the time of enrollment, t he subject will be evaluated  at the Screening 
Visit  for study eligibility  based on inclusion/exclusion requirements established in Sections 8.1 and 8.2.  
Subjects who fail to qualify for the study will be considered “screen failures” and exited from the study.  
Subjects who successfully complete the Screening Visit will be scheduled for their next visit at which the 
first study medication will be adminis tered.   
 
9.3. Randomization to Study Drug Administration Sequence   
 
Each eligible subject will be randomly assigned to receive one of [ADDRESS_505688] of the study.  The  drug assignment 
sequence (Study Drug A, B or C) will be provided in paper format contained in a sealed envelope for each 
subject who randomized to treatment .

EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN -MYD -TP-[ADDRESS_505689], the investigator , and study staff  
administering the drug and/or  performing clinical assessments.  The Sponsor (or designee) involved in 
day-to-day study management will also be masked to study drug  assignments.   
 
9.3.1.  Procedure for Unmasking Study Drug  Assignment Code  
 
Unmasking of study drug  assignments can only occ ur in the event of a medical emergency or occurrence 
of an AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], warrants such action .  In the absence of medical need, the 
study drug  assignment code will not be available to the investigator , site staff , or Sponsor (or designee) 
representative involved in day -to-day study management u ntil study completion and database lock.  
 
In the event  an investigator considers unmasking of a subject’s study drug  assignment to be necessary, 
he/she must first contact [CONTACT_40862]  (or designee ) to discuss the case .  Only after 
consultation with the study Medical Monitor will the decision be made regarding  unmasking . Study drug  
assignment s will be revealed on ly for the subjects approved for unmasking , thus leaving mas king on 
remaining subjects intact.  
 
9.4. Study Drug  Packaging , Labeling  and Storage  
 
Three drugs , each delivered in microdose form using the Eyenovia MiDD, will be evaluated in this study .  
Each of the drugs must be aseptically transferred by a licensed pharmacist affiliated with the study site 
from the container in which they are received to the sterile vial provided with the MiDD cartridge.  After 
aseptic transfer, the filled vial is re -inserted into the MiDD cartridge.   
 
To maintain masking of the study drug assignments for staff administering investigational product and/or 
performing clinical evaluations, study inventory storage and management will be performed by a 
pharmacy associated  with the study site.  The Sponsor, or designee, will ship study drug kits to each site 
pharmacy.  Each kit will be labeled with the study protocol number, study drug code, product storage 
requirements, and the Caution – New Drug – Limited by [CONTACT_4496] (US) Law to Investigational Use label.  
 
Instructions regarding study medication preparation are included in APPENDIX 2:  STUDY 
MEDICATION PREPARATION  PROCEDURE .  Each designated site pharmacist will be trained and 
certified by [CONTACT_1034], or designee, prior to study medication preparation.   
 
Prior to use, study medication must be stored in a secure area.  To maintain product stability, store at 20° 
to 25° C  (68° to 77° F).  Protect product from light and excessive heat.   
 
New MiDD s must be prepared by [CONTACT_401070].  To 
maintain masking of site personnel, the MiDD  containing  each of the 3 study drugs  will be  labeled with 
the appropriate study randomization code , pharmacy preparation date and “use by ” date, then forwarded 
to site personnel for use.   The date on which the MiDD  is used will be added by [CONTACT_8786] .  At the 
end of the treatment day,  each MiDD  provided  will be returned to the pharmacy  for storage . Please note 
that each MiDD  prepared must be used on the d ay of preparation; the MiDD  may not be re -used on 
subsequent days.

terminated from the study and considered lost to follow -up. 
 
9.7. Study Exit  
 
9.7.1.  Subject Termination  
 
Subjects may be terminated from the study  due to:  
 
• Failure to meet protocol eligibility criteria  
• Investigator decision that termination is medically indicated  
• Voluntary withdrawal from the study  
• Loss to follow -up 
• Other administrative reasons  (e.g., study terminated by [CONTACT_2728], technical problems , non -
compliance with study medication administration or other study requirements, etc.)  
 
Subjects who terminate due to the occurrence of an AE will be followed until resolution or stabilization of 
the event.  
 
Subjects who exit the study due to failure to meet eligibility criteria  may be replaced.  Subjects who exit 
the study prematurely for other reasons will not be replaced.  The Sponsor  (or designee)  should be 
promptly notified of a subject’s early termination, and information regarding the termination ( e.g., date 
and reason) should be documented in the source records and on the Study Exit eCRF.

EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN -MYD -TP-[ADDRESS_505701] of the AE definitions provided are published in either CFR 312.32 – IND Safety Reporting  or 
ICH E6 – Good Clinical Practice:  Consolidated Guidance.   Because of the differing sources  for these 
definitions , some terminology ; e.g., “adverse event”, “adverse reaction”, and “adverse experience”, 
differs.  For this study, these terms should be considered  equivalent.  
 
10.1.1.  Adverse Event  (AE)  
 
Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not  considered 
drug-related.30    
 
10.1.2.  Adverse Drug Reaction  (ADR)  
 
Any noxious and unintended response  to a medicinal product administered at a ny dose .  A reasonable 
possibility must exist that the adverse reaction is related to the medicinal product administered.31 
 
10.1.3.  Unexpected  Adverse  Event  or U nexpected  Suspected  Adverse  Reaction   
 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the Investigator 
Brochure  (IB) or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if a n IB is not 
required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational 
plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amende d.  "Unexpected," as used in this definition, also 
refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of 
drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug but  are not specifically menti oned 
as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.32 
 
10.1.4.  Suspected  Adverse  Reaction  
 
Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event. For the purposes of 
Investigational New Drug ( IND) safety reporting, "reasonable possibility" means there is evidence to

degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.33  
 
10.1.5.  Life-Threatening Adverse Event or Life -Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death.  Life -threatening 
AEs do not include AEs or suspected adverse reactions that, had they occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.34 
 
10.1.6.  Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
An AE or  suspected adverse reaction that, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, results in any 
of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• Is life -threatening35  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29350]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity, meaning there is a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34502], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  in this 
definition.36  
 
10.1.7.  Serious Ocular Adverse Events  
 
Serious ocular AEs include, but are not  limited to:  
 
• A decrease in BCDVA  of ≥ 30 total letters read (TLR) or ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_505703] recent 
previous measurement of BCDVA  
• A decrease in BCDVA  to light perception  (LP) or worse  that lasts > 1 hour  
• An ocular event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], requires medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent permanent loss of sight  
• Severe intraocular inflammation; e.g., 4+ anterior chamber cell/fl are or 4+ vitritis

An AE not present prior to drug therapy, or an already present event that worsens either in intensity or  
frequency following initiation of therapy .  
 
10.2. Adverse Event Assessment  and Documentation  
 
All AEs that occur  from the time the subject receives the first dose of study drug37 until study 
participation  has been completed (e.g., TEAEs)  must be documented.   Any medical condition present 
prior to the first study drug dose that remains unchanged or improves will not be recorded as an AE; 
however, a worsening of the condition after dosing with the study drug, will be considered an AE.   
 
Adverse events  may be de termined by [CONTACT_401072] : 
 
• Observed or volunteered  problems  
• Complaints  
• Physical signs and symptoms   
• The occurrence of a m edical condition during the study, which was absent at baseline  
• The worsening of a baselin e medical condition during the study  
 
Treatment -emergent AEs , regardless of causal relationship, must be assessed by [CONTACT_401073].  Each AE must be described as ocular or 
non-ocular along with the following information:  date of onset, date of resolution, severity, frequency of 
the event (single epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], intermittent, continuous), action taken (none, medical and/or surgical), 
relationship to study drug, and seri ousness criteria .  Any medication necessary for the treatment of an AE 
must be recorded on the Concomitant Medication eCRF and any surgical intervention necessary for AE 
treatment must be recorded on the Concomitant Procedure eCRF.  If more than one distin ct AE occurs, 
each event should be recorded separately.  
 
Adverse events will be documented  beginning  at the time of onset, and documentation must  continue 
until recovery is noted.  Events that are ongoing at the time of study exit must be followed until re solution 
or stabilization.

10.2.2.  Adverse Event Relationship to Study Drug  
 
The relationship of the AE to study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_130691]:  
 
Not Related  Evidence exists that the AE has a cause other than the study 
drug (e.g. pre -existing condition or underlying disease, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication) and does not 
meet any othe r criteria listed.  
  
Possibly Related  A temporal relationship exists between event onset and 
administration of study drug.  Although the AE may appear 
unlikely to be related to the study drug, it cannot be ruled out 
with certainty; and /or the event cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Probably Related  A temporal relationship exists between the event onset and 
administration of study drug ; it appears with some degree of 
certainty to be r elated based on known therapeutic and 
pharmacologic actions of the study drug.  It cannot be readily 
explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or concomitant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Definitely Related  Strong evidence exists that the study drug caused the AE.  
There is a temporal relationship between the event onset and 
administration of the study drug.  There is strong therapeutic

• To facilitate Investigator reporting of unanticipated problems involving risk to human subjects to 
the IRB/ EC; and  
• To enable the Sponsor to fulfill the reporting requirements to the appropria te regulatory authority.

 11. STATISTICAL METHODS  
 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of  Eyenovia’s  fixed combination 
of phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1%  ophthalmic solution  administered with the MiDD  for dilation of  
the pupil as compared to the individual components.  
 
11.1. Efficacy Endpoint s 
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: An efficacy analysis will be conducted to compare fixed combination of 
phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1%  microdose ophthalmic solution  administered against its individual 
components with the following endpoint:  
 
The primary performance endpoint is m ean change  per visit  in pupil diameter at 3 5 minutes versus 
baseline, as measured by [CONTACT_401062][INVESTIGATOR_401028] s.  The highly photopic 
condition will be established using a fully -charged transilluminator (muscle light) at the brightest setting.  
 
Additional Efficacy Analyses:  
• Proportion of eyes achieving pupil diameter  of 6.0 mm or greater at 35 minutes  
• Proportion o f eyes achieving pupil diameter  of 7.0 mm or greater at 35 minutes  
• Mean change in pupil diameter at other timepoints ( 20, 50, 65, 80  120, and 180 minutes)  
• Distribution of pupil diameter s at 20, 35, 50, 65, 80 , 120, and 180 minutes  
• Time from baseline to maximal pupil dilation  
 
These additional efficacy analyses  will also be measured using digital pupi[INVESTIGATOR_401029].

Power calculations are provided for additional exploratory outcomes below on an informational basis.  
 
When the sample size is 54, a two -sided 95% exact confidence interval for a single proportion will have a 
half-width of 13.9% or less.  
 
• For evaluation of the proportion of eyes achieving pupil size of 6.0 mm or greater at 35 minutes: if 
the observed propo rtion in the fixed combination treatment is 70.4% (38/54), then the exact 95% 
confidence interval for the proportion will be [56.4%, 82.0%], with a half -width of 12.8%.  
 
• For evaluation of the proportion of eyes achieving pupil size of 7.0 mm or greater at 35 minutes: if 
the observed proportion in the fixed combination treatment is 40.7% (22/54), then the exact 95% 
confidence interval for the proportion will be [27.6% 55.0%], with a half -width of 13.7%.  
 
11.3. Safety Outcomes  
 
A safety analysis will be conducted to compare fixed combination of phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1%  
µD against 2 control therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (individual components) for the following outcomes:  
 
• Slit-lamp examination findings  
• Occurrence of AEs 
• IOP measured at [ADDRESS_505710] -administration * 
• Visual acuity changes*  
 
*IOP and VA line listings will be provided for pediatric subjects because of the variable testing  methods 
appropriate for this sub -group   
 
11.4. Analysis Populations  
 
Subjects who are missing efficacy assessments at any of the time points or are otherwise unevaluable for 
efficacy considerations will not be replaced.   
 
11.4.1.  Intent to Treat Population  
 
The intent to treat ( ITT) population will consist of all randomized subjects who received a dose of study 
medication .   Subjects will be analyzed according to the planned sequence of treatments.

CONFIDENTIAL  - PAGE 36 OF 62 
21 SEPTEMBER 2018  
 11.4.2.  Per Protocol Population  
 
The per protocol (PP)  population will consist of all ITT subjects who completed all planned assessments 
without major protocol  violations.  Subjects to be excluded from the PP population will be selected prior 
to unmasking study drug  assignment.  Subjects will be analyzed according to the sequence of treatments 
received . 
 
11.4.3.  Modified Per Protocol Population  
 
The modified per protocol (MPP) population is defined similarly to the PP population, except that 
classification will be made for each subject at the individual treatment level, rather than at the subject 
level. Unlike the PP population, subjects who only complete [ADDRESS_505711] of all ITT subjects.  Subjects will be analyzed according to the 
sequence o f study drugs  received . 
 
11.5. General Statistical Considerations  
 
Primary efficacy analyses will be conducted on the PP population.  Safety analyses will be performed 
using the safety analysis set.  All primary analyses will be performed using data from  both eyes.   The 
pupil diameter measurement at each corresponding time point after administration  will be compared 
between  drugs . 
 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize continuous outcomes (number of subjects [N], mean, 
standard deviation or sta ndard error of the mean, median, maximum, and minimum) and categorical 
variables, i.e. race, sex, iris color (frequency and percentage) at each assessment time point.  
 
The balanced  crossover design used in this study allows for within -subject (i.e. within -eye) estimates of 
all study drug  effects  (A, B, and C ) and  all cross -drug first-order  carryover  effects ( AB, AC, BA, BC, CA, 
CB).  Thus , there is no need to include random effects for subject or eye in the analysis model, we will 
use fixed effects ANOVA to analyze these data (Jones and Kenward, 2015, section 5. 2) and tests will be 
based on within -eye variances.   A SAS REPEATED statement will be used to allow  for correlation 
between fellow eyes.  
 
This study has both a “pre -randomization” covariate (iris color) and a “period -dependent” covariate 
(baseline pupil measurement) as discussed in Jones and Kenward ( 2015, section  5.4.4).  We are assuming 
PHENYLEPHRINE 2.5% -TROPI[INVESTIGATOR_383219] 1% MICRODOSE OPHTHALMIC SOLUTION

21 SEPTEMBER 2018  
 that the time between visits is sufficiently long that the baseline pupil measurement at each visit is 
unaffected by [CONTACT_401076].  
 
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all statistical tests and confidence intervals will be two -sided, alpha = 
0.05.  
11.5.1.  Analysis of Primar y Efficacy  
 
All time points for pupil diameter will be analyzed separately; however, only the 35 -minute time point 
will support statistical inference.  Success is defined as the fixed combination being statistically 
significantly better than each individua l component.   
 
The null and alternative hypotheses for comparison of Eyenovia’s fixed combination phenylephrine 
2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution with the first individual component, phenylephrine 2.5% 
ophthalmic solution, based on the primary variable, is defined as follows:  
 
• H0: The mean change per visit in pupil diameter at 35 minutes versus baseline, as measured by 
[CONTACT_401062][INVESTIGATOR_401051], is not different between Eyenovia’s fixed 
combination phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution and phenylephrine 2.5% 
ophthalmic solution  
• HA: The mean change per visit in pupil diameter at 35 minutes versus baseline, as measured by 
[CONTACT_401062][INVESTIGATOR_401051], is different between Eyenovia’s fi xed 
combination phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution and phenylephrine 2.5% 
ophthalmic solution  
 
The null and alternative hypotheses for comparison of Eyenovia’s fixed combination phenylephrine 
2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution with  the second individual component, Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% 
ophthalmic solution, based on the primary variable, is defined as follows:  
 
• H0: The mean change per visit in pupil diameter at 35 minutes versus baseline, as measured by 
[CONTACT_401062][INVESTIGATOR_401052], is not different between Eyenovia’s fixed 
combination phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution and Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% 
ophthalmic solution  
• HA: The mean change per visit in pupil diameter at 35 minutes versus baseline, as measured by 
[CONTACT_401062][INVESTIGATOR_401051], is different between Eyenovia’s fixed 
combination phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution and Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% 
ophthalmic solution  
 
Both  null hypotheses must be rejected in order to claim succ ess for the study.  
 
Comparisons among drugs on mean pupil diameter will be based on a fixed -effects analysis of variance 
model.  The model will contain an effect due to subject, eye, subject x eye, period (1, 2, or 3), direct 
effect of drug, first order ca rryover, baseline pupil diameter, and iris color (dark vs light).  The SAS 
PROC MIXED procedure will be used to fit the ANOVA model.  Hypothesis tests will be based on

estimates, in such a setting the missing observations are ignorable if data are missing at random (MAR).   
 
11.5.2.  Additional Efficacy Analyses  
 
The proportion of eyes achieving pupil size of 6.[ADDRESS_505712]-dose will be summarized by [CONTACT_401078].  
 
For each of these proportions, p airwise comparisons of the fixed combination of phenylephrine 2.5% -
tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% microdose ophthalmic solution administered against its individual components will be 
conducted with a generalized estimating equation (GEE) mo del for binomial outcome,  allowing for 
correlation between eyes.   
 
The SAS PROC GENMOD procedure will be used to fit the model, using the same fixed effects as the 
primary analysis.  Once again, comparisons between treatment groups will be based on SAS LS MEANS 
for the pairwise differences.  Details are provided in the statistical analysis plan.  
 
In addition, a cumulative proportion of responders  analysis (CPRA) will be created to graphically display 
the proportions of subjects with a pupil size at [ADDRESS_505713] -dose over the entire range of possible 
pupil size cut -offs (Farrar 2006), with separate lines for each treatment and eye combination.  
 
The endpoints expressed as proportion of responders will be compared among drugs  using the Mantel -
Haenszel statistic stratified on iris color.  The Mantel -Fleiss criterion will be employed to assess the 
appropriateness of the chi -square approximation for the Mantel -Haenszel statistic.  
 
The distribution of time to maximum pupil diameter  will be described by [CONTACT_5263] -Meier plots.    
 
11.5.3.  Sensitivity Analyses  
 
The primary efficacy analysis described above will be rerun using  the MPP population as a sensitivity 
analysis.  
 
As a further sensitivity analysis, multiple imputation based on reference -based multiple imputation will be 
used to impute missing data at the 35 -minute time point based on a missing not at random (MNAR) 
assumption. Since the PP population contains only subjects with non -missing values, this analysis will be 
conducted using the ITT population, which may contain subjects who have only partially available 
information. Placebo treatment will serve as reference g roup for this approach. Each subject will be 
included for all three treatment visits for this approach, regardless of how many treatment visits were 
actually completed.   Details are provided in the statistical analysis plan.

  Each kit will be labeled with the following information:  
• Study protocol number  
• Study drug code (A, B, or C)  
• Statement that kit contains either phenylephrine 2.5% -tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% , or phenylephrine 2.5% , or 
tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution  
• Product storage requirement  
• Caution – New Drug – Limited by [CONTACT_4496] (U S) Law to Investigational Use  
 
The MiDD base unit and cartridge are supplied in separate b oxes within each study drug kit.  The MiDD 
base unit is contained in a polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) plastic tray inside the box.  The 
MiDD cartridge, which includes the empty vial into which the drug is transferred, is supplied sterile in a 
PETG plastic tray with a peel lid.   Prior to initial MiDD use, the relevant study ophthalmic solution must 
be aseptically transferred from the container in which it is received  into the MiDD vial.  The vial is then 
inserted into the MiDD cartridge assembly, the cartridge and base are clipped together, and the seal on the 
vial containing the drug is punctured  by [CONTACT_401084].  Puncture of this seal creates 
a fluid path for the drug .  Depression and release of the Load Button [ADDRESS_505722] be prepared for each treatment day.  MiDD cartridges containing each of 
the 3 study drugs and labeled with the appropriate study drug code, pharmacy preparation date and “use 
by” date will be forwarded  with the accompanying base unit  by [CONTACT_401085].   
 
Site personnel will assemble the cartridge and base unit for each study drug to be used that day and the 
“date used” for the MiDD  will be added to the product preparation/use label by [CONTACT_8786].  At the end 
of the treatm ent day, each MiDD  provided will be returned to the pharmacy for storage . Please note that 
each MiDD  prepared must be used on the day of  preparation; the MiDD  may not be re -used on 
subsequent days .

  APPENDIX 3:  STUDY MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION  PROCEDURE  
 
This study will be double -masked so that there are no differences in presentation (Eyenovia’s fixed 
combination mydriasis agent is formulated as a multi -dose microdroplet spray and the components are 
also administrated as a microdroplet spray).  Site perso nnel designated to administer study medication 
will be trained by [CONTACT_401086]. In 
order to reduce the potential for operational bias, study personnel who administer study medication on a 
given day will not be allowed to perform post -study drug administration  ophthalmic assessments on that 
day.  Study drug must be administered in location unattended by [CONTACT_401087].  
 
For each treatment day, one or more new MiDD  base units and cartridges  containing the study drug(s) to 
be administered  will be provided by [CONTACT_401088].  Each MiDD  will appear the same  except for a 
label indicating the study drug code.   Study site pers onnel will assemble the cartridge and base unit, then 
add the study drug administration  day to the MiDD  label  and prime the system for use by [CONTACT_401089] , then depressing and releasing the Dose Button.  This sequence must be 
performed 5 times  to complete the priming process .   
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Eyenovia MiDD  Front (L) and Back (R) View  
 
At the time of study medication administration, the following steps should be followed sequentially:  
 
1. Load MiDD  dose by [CONTACT_401090] . 
2. Hold MiDD  such that that the thumb and 3rd finger are positioned on each side of the cartridge 
and index finger is positioned on DOSE BUTTON at the back of  the MiDD.  Note:  Holding 
MiDD with fingers around the front of the device may affect dispenser alignment with the eye, 
resulting in spray administration outside of the targeted corneal area.

  3. Begin to position the MiDD over the patient’s eye such that t he SPRAY NOZZLE is facing the 
cornea and the DOSE BUTTON is facing the medication administrator .  While positioning, it is 
suggested to use the little finger of the hand holding the MiDD to open the lower lid and the 
thumb of the opposite hand to hold the upper lid open.  
4. Lower the MiDD toward the eye such that it is almost touching the patient’s brow and cheek.  
The MiDD may be rotated sl ightly to avoid interference that might affect stability during spray 
administration; however, it is important that the SPRAY NOZZLE be aligned directly toward the 
patient’s cornea.  
5. Ask patient to first look up, then look at the blue light around the SPRAY  NOZZLE  
6. When blue light is centered on the patient’s iris, depress, then quickly release DOSE BUTTON to 
administer medication.  Visually confirm medication delivery to the cornea.   
7. If medication delivery missed the cornea, withdraw MiDD from eye, then rel oad by [CONTACT_401091] 1-6. 
8. Repeat steps 1 -7 for the contralateral eye.

  APPENDIX 4 :  EXAMINATION PROCEDU RES  
 
All study personnel conducting ophthalmic assessments will be masked to the study drug  administered.  
 
1. Visual Acuity  
 
The e valuation of VA should be performed before the subject’s pupi[INVESTIGATOR_401055].   Distance VA 
measurements should be obtained at a testing distance of [ADDRESS_505723] be between 80 cd/m2 and 160 cd/m2, 
inclusive (85 cd/m2 is recommended).    
  
Adult subject s’ BCDVA  will be determined using subjective manifest refraction.  
 
The subject  should be seated so that the distance from the  subject 's eyes to the ETDRS chart (Chart 1 for 
right eye and Chart 2 for left eye) is 4 meters (157.5 inches).  The middle line of letters to approximately 
one-third of the distance from the top line of letters should be at eye level for the subject .  The  subject  
should be asked to start reading letters at the top line of the chart.   Document the number of letters 
correctly read the line.  Move to the next line down if 4 or more letters are read correctly and document 
the number of letters correctly read on this line.  Continue moving down the lines (documenting the 
number of letters read for each line) until the subject  reads 2 or more letters incorrectly, then stop.  Note:  
If the total number of letters read (TLR) correctly is less than [ADDRESS_505724]  1 meter from 
the chart and add +0.[ADDRESS_505725]  should be tested to determine if 
vision is count fingers (CF), hand motion (HM), light perception (LP), or no light perception (NLP).   All 
visual acuities will be expressed in logMar units.  
 
For younger pediatric subjects, uncorrected distance visual acui ty UCDVA should be measured using 
age-appropriate methods per the Investigator’s usual practice.  
 
2. Pupil Diameter Measurement

EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN -MYD -TP-[ADDRESS_505727] should be asked to focus straight ahead at a target placed at 3  
meters  to avoid accommodation.  A fully -charged transilluminator, or muscle light, will be shone 
into one eye while the pupil diameter in the fellow eye is measured . For o ptimal accuracy, take 
the measurement at the patient’s eye level and repeat each measurement 2-3 times to ensure the 
result is consistent .  The pupil diameter recorded should be either the mean (if 2 measurements 
are taken) or the median (if 3 measurements  are taken) values.

response will be recorded on a scale ranging from 0 (non -responsive) to 3 (brisk).  
 
4. Intraocular Pressure  Measurement   
 
After completion of slit lamp biomicroscopy, local anesthetic will be applied to facilitate IOP 
measurements with the Goldmann Applanation Tonometer. Recent tonometer calibration must be 
documented.  
 
Two consecutive IOP measurements of each  eye must be obtained. If the [ADDRESS_505728] be obtained. IOP will be analyzed as the mean of these 2 
measurements, or as the median of the 3 measurements . 
 
For pediatric subjects, IOP should be measured  using age -appropriate methods per the Investigator’s 
usual practice.  
 
5. Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy  
 
The eyelids, conjunctiva, sclera, cornea, anterior chamber, lens , iris and anterior vitreous of the eye will 
be examined with the aid of a table -mounted binocular microscope, called a slit lamp.  The patient will be 
seated during this examination and fluorescein dye should be instilled into the ocular cul -de-sac to 
facilitat e the examination.  For pediatric subjects who cannot cooperate with a traditional SLE, a portable 
slit lamp model may be used according to the Investigator’s usual practice.  Grading will be assigned as 
follows:

  APPENDIX  6:  WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCI ATION DECLARATION OF  HELSINKI  
 
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects  
 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by [CONTACT_941]:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_505732], Republic of South Africa, October 1996  
52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000  
53th WMA General Assembly, Washington 2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 added)  
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added)  
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008  
 
A.  INTRODUCTION  
 
1.  The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of 
ethical principles for medical re search involving human subjects , including research on identifiable 
human material and data. The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent 
paragraphs should not be applied without consideration of all other relevant paragrap hs. 
 
2.  Although the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages other 
participants in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.  
 
3.  It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health o f patients, including those who are 
involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the 
fulfillment of this duty.  
 
4.  The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my 
patien t will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, “A 
physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing medical care.”  
 
5.  Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studi es involving human subjects. 
Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to 
participation in research.  
 
6.  In medical research involving human subjects, the well -being of the individual research subject must 
take precedence over all other interests.  
 
7.  The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, 
development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions 
PHENYLEPHRINE 2.5% -TROPI[INVESTIGATOR_383219] 1% MICRODOSE OPHTHALMIC SOLUTION

  (methods,  procedures and treatments). Even the best current interventions must be evaluated 
continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
 
8.  In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and  
 burdens.  
 
9.  Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human subjects and 
protect their health and rights. Some research populations are particularly vulnerable and need special 
protection. These incl ude those who cannot give or refuse consent for themselves and those who may 
be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence.  
 
10. Physicians should consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research 
involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and 
standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or 
eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
 
B.  PRINCIP LES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH  
 
11. It is the duty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, 
integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research 
subjects.  
 
12. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles, 
be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, 
and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal e xperimentation. The welfare of animals used for 
research must be respected.  
 
13.  Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of medical research that may harm the 
environment.  
 
14. The design and performance of each research study involving human  subjects must be clearly 
described in a research protocol. The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerations 
involved and should indicate how the principles in this Declaration have been addressed. The protocol 
should include  informati on regarding funding , institutional affiliations, other potential conflicts of 
interest, incentives for subjects and provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are 
harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study. The protocol s hould describe 
arrangements for post -study access by [CONTACT_401095].  
 
15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance an d approval to a 
research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be independent of the 
researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence. It must take into consideration the laws and

EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN -MYD -TP-[ADDRESS_505733] of the study on their physical, mental and 
social integrity.  
 
PHENYLEPHRINE 2.5% -TROPI[INVESTIGATOR_383219] 1% MICRODOSE OPHTHALMIC SOLUTION  
EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN -MYD -TP-[ADDRESS_505734]’s freely -given informed consent, preferably in writing. 
If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non -written consent must be formally documented 
and witnessed.  
 
25. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, physicians must normally seek 
consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may be situations where consent 
would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research or would pose a threat to the validity 
of the research. In such situations the research may be do ne only after consideration and approval of a 
research ethics committee.  
 
26. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should be 
particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the  physician or may 
consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent should be sought by [CONTACT_11274].  
 
27. For a potential research subject who is incompetent, the physician must seek informed consent from 
the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included in a research study that 
has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the health of the population 
represented  by [CONTACT_11275], the research cannot instead be performed with competent 
persons, and the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden.  
 
28. When a potential research subject who is deemed incompetent is able to give assent to decisions about 
participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to the consent of the legally 
authorized representative. The potential subject’s dissent should be respected.  
 
29. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally i ncapable of giving consent, for example, 
unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving 
informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. In such circumstances the 
physician should s eek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no such 
representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without 
informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a c ondition that 
renders  them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study 
has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research should be 
obtained as soon as possible from the subject o r a legally authorized representative.

EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN -MYD -TP-[ADDRESS_505735] c urrent proven intervention, except in the following circumstances:  
• The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current proven intervention 
exists; or  
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of  placebo is 
necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive 
placebo,  or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious or irreversible harm. Extreme 
care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
 
33. At the conclusion of the study, patients entered into the study are entitled to be informed about the 
outcome of the study and to share any benefits that result from it, for example, access to interventions 
identified as beneficial in the study or to o ther appropriate care or benefits.  
 
34. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the research. The 
refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study must 
never in terfere with the patient -physician relationship.  
 
35. In the treatment of a patient, where proven interventions do not exist or have been ineffective, the 
physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the patient or a legally authorize d 
representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the physician's judgment it offers hope of 
saving life, re -establishing health or alleviating suffering. Where possible, this intervention should be 
made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information 
should be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

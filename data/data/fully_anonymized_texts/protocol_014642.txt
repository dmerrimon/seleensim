2.1 Background and Study Rationale
Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) is sudden, unexpected deat h often caused by [CONTACT_399779] (SCA),
an abrup
t loss of heart function with no sign of blood circulation, and is the leading cause of na tural
death 
in the US, resultin g in about 325,000 adult deaths each year.(1) SCA is most often caus ed by
[CONTACT_399780][INVESTIGATOR_399753]. Ventricular Fibrillation (VF), which is an erratic, disorgan ized firing of impulses from the
ventricl
es is the most common life-threatening arrh ythmia. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), in which the
ventricl
es of the heart rapi[INVESTIGATOR_399754], can also potentially be life
threate
ning.
While 
the Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) is typi[INVESTIGATOR_399755]-term prevention of
SCA in high-risk populations, there are temporary periods of time when ICD implantation is commonly
deferred. Examples include the initial 40 days after myocardial infarction (MI), the initial 90 days after
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coro nary artery by
[CONTACT_15806] (CABG), or after I CD
explan
tation. The WCD has become a viable option to treat these temporary periods of elevated risk  for
SCA. Patien
ts are typi[INVESTIGATOR_399756] a W CD 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for 40 to 90 days or
longer u
ntil a medical decision is made on whether to implant an ICD.(2)
Time
 to defibrillation is the single most critical dete rminant of survi val in SCA. Survival rates after VF
decrease approximately se
ven to ten percent with every minute that defibrillation is delaye d. (3) While
rapid de ﬁbrill
ation with an Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) by [CONTACT_399781]-of -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164132], the time period be tween arrest and succ essful resuscitation
must 
be short and the cardiac arre st must be witnessed. The development of a wearable cardioverter
de
ﬁbrillator has provided a new therapy option for patien ts who are at high risk of SCA, and may require
a defibrillation shock without the 
assistance from a by[CONTACT_112815].
The 
Jewel Patch Wearable Cardioverter Defibrillator is  an automatic external cardioverter defi brillator
that 
monitors patients at risk for SCA and provides a therapeutic shock if needed . It is intended to be
worn at ho
me or in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399757].
To date, only
 one manufacturer has a commercial pr oduct approved as a wear able automated external
defibrillator. The ZOLL LifeVest WCD is currently availa ble in the [LOCATION_002], Europe, Austra lia, Israel,
Japan, and
 Singapore.
The clinical efficacy of external defibrillation shoc k waveforms used in the ZOLL LifeVest WCD  and other
AEDs has be
en well studied in the controlled environmen t of the electrophysiology (EP) lab. For example,
with the
 replacement of monophasic damped sine waveforms with lower energy biphasic truncated
exponential 
waveforms, clinical efficacy was compared  by [CONTACT_399782]
g electrophysiologic testing. (3) With th e ZOLL LifeVest WCD, clinical efficacy was also
evaluated as 
part of a routine EP procedure in whic h ten (10) patients were induced into VF a nd the
LifeVest was 
used to deliver a single defibrillation shock.  (4) In this study, special WCD units were used
that were manually charged and discharged by [CONTACT_399783][INVESTIGATOR_85712] a  relatively
short time period (mean 
duration of 32 seconds per epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]).
The 
Jewel delivers a salvo of up to 5 shocks (150,  162, 162, 162, 162 joules) using a biphasic truncat ed
exponen
tial waveform that is adjusted based on th e transthoracic impedance of the patient . In this
clini
cal study, the objective is to demonstrate the sa fety of the Jewel and to collect efficacy da ta on
termina
tion of potentially lethal arrhythm ias, such as life-threatening VT or VF .

PR-[ADDRESS_503792] the potential to convert a life-threatening cardiac rhythm and prevent SCA in this at-risk 
population. The results of this study may help other people to gain access to the Jewel, which may 
result in the prevention of SCD. 
2.2.3 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits 
The Jewel has been developed and tested thorough ly to meet the electrical safety standards 
published by [CONTACT_399784] (IEC). The device is battery powered 
and operates at low levels of electrical current, except when delivering a defibrillation shock. The 
electrodes are attached to sticky, adhesive pads, which consist of materials that are widely used in 
commercially available medical adhesives. The patient population being evaluated is at risk for 
SCA, and the device being tested has the potent ial to convert life threatening rhythms in this 
population who would otherwise be dependent on  by[CONTACT_399785] a life-saving therapy in a ti mely fashion. The results of Element Science’s 
simulated human use and preclinical testing, combin ed with the risk analysis of the Jewel System, 
indicate that the risk-to-benefit profile of the Jewel is favorable for the patient. With a better patient experience, the Jewel is anticipated to have significantly better compliance, and therefore has potentially greater effectiveness than the current standard WCD, with an equivalent safety profile to the standard WCD.

3.1 Objective
The objective of this study is to demonstrate the sa fety and clinical effectiv eness of the Jewel P-WCD.
3.2 Endpoints
3.2.1 Primary Effectivenes s Endpoint
To demons
trate an observed inappropriate shock ra te of no more than 2.0 inappropriate shocks 
per 100 patient-months using a one-sided upper 97%  confidence interval and >83% power at the 
interim analysis; and a 98% confidence interval and >98% power for the final analysis.  
An inappropriate shock is defined as a shock delivered during a period where the study subject is 
not experiencing life threatening VT or VF. Only  first inappropriate shocks will contribute the 
analysis of this endpoint. All inappropriate shocks will be reviewed and adjudicated by a Clinical 
Events Committee (CEC) and reported throughout the prescription period. 
3.2.2 Primary Safety Endpoint 
The primary safety endpoint is to observe a rate of subjects experiencing a clinically significant 
cutaneous Adverse Device Effects of <15%.  
For the purpose of endpoint calculation, a cutaneous ADE will be considered clinically significant if 
it causes the subject to be permanently withdrawn from the trial by [CONTACT_737]. 
All Adverse Device Effects and device-related Seri ous Adverse Events (SAE) will be tabulated and 
presented along with duration and severity. The proportion of subjects experiencing an ADE or SAE 
will also be presented. All device-related events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_399786] (DSMB).  
3.2.[ADDRESS_503793] one shockable rhythm 
with a salvo of up to five (5) shocks.  
A shock is considered appropriate if the shock is delivered during a period where the subject is 
experiencing VF or a VT that is considered “life threatening” as defined in the CEC Charter and as adjudicated by [CONTACT_15741]. If multiple successful co nversions occur in a single subject, conversions will 
be counted as separate events only if the rhythm returned to a non-shockable rhythm between 
conversions (i.e. the Jewel returns to Monitor Mode).  All successful conversions will be included in 
the secondary endpoint analysis. All appropri ate shocks and attempted conversions will be 
reviewed and adjudicated by [CONTACT_399787].  
The second secondary endpoint is to observe a compliance rate of subjects wearing the Jewel of 
greater than 14.[ADDRESS_503794] compliance with using the Jewel system will  be evaluated, including average weekly wear. 
Detection of Ventricular Arrhythmias 
An analysis of all events that trigger the alar m cycle after three (3) consecutive segments of 
shockable rhythm (~24 seconds in total) will be performed.

5.3 Lifestyle Considerations 
During this study, subjects are asked to: 
• Prepare their skin prior to each Jewel applic ation. Preparation includes using the provided 
supplies for skin cleansing and any needed hair trimming. 
• Use provided adhesive remover to remove the Jewel from the body and return the used study 
devices and supplies to the Sponsor using the provided pre-paid shippi[INVESTIGATOR_179269]. 
• Wear the Jewel at all times and following instru ctions for interacting with the device, paying 
attention to and responding to audio, visual, and vibratory commands. The Jewel should be removed, the Patch Unit replaced, and the Jewel reapplied approximately once per week or as the device directs the subject. 
• Try to keep the Jewel out of direct water spray when showering. Study subjects will be told not 
to submerge the Jewel (i.e., no ba ths, swimming, hot tubs, etc.).  
• Avoid exposing Jewel patches to direct sunlight for more than 5 minutes. 
• Avoid operating the Jewel System in hot enviro nments (greater than 50°C /122°F) and cold 
environments (less than 10°C / 50°F). 
• Avoid storing the Jewel System in hot environments (greater than 30°C /86°F) and cold environments (less than 15°C / 59°F). 
• Minimize activities that include excessive stretc hing of the torso or profuse sweating, as such 
activities will reduce the ability of the device to remain on the skin and may result in the need to replace the Jewel early. 
• Bring a back-up Patch Unit and the Placement Accessory when traveling for more than 24 hours. 
• Keep cell phones at least [ADDRESS_503799] from Jewel. 
5.4 Screen Failures 
Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to  participate in the clinical trial, but who do not 
subsequently wear a Jewel (Jewel does not enter Monitor Mode). These subjects will not be included in any study analyses. A minimal set of screen failure in formation will be captured, including demographics, 
screen failure details, and eligibility criteria.
 
5.5 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention 
Subjects will be recruited from inpatients who are nearing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], or from patients discharged in the previous five (5) days, who meet the study inclusion criteria and have none of the 
exclusion criteria. Site staff will be responsible for id entifying eligible patients  within their respective 
clinical practices. Any subject who becomes a member of a vulnerable po pulation during the clinical trial 
will be exited from the study.

6.1 Study Intervention Administration 
6.1.1 Study Intervention Description 
Element Science, Inc. (“Element Science”) has developed the Jewel for patients who are at risk for 
SCA. The Jewel monitors a patien t’s cardiac rhythm continuously, and if a patient experiences a 
life-threatening epi[INVESTIGATOR_399758], the Jewel is able to deliver a therapeutic shock to convert a 
patient to normal sinus rhythm. By [CONTACT_399789] a patch wearable 
adhesive system, the Jewel provides a patient -centric design that improves the comfort and 
convenience of wearing a WCD. Throughout the wear period, the Jewel does not need to be 
removed for any typi[INVESTIGATOR_399759], which ensures that  the patient is protected continuously during 
common daily activities, including cardiac rehabilitation, showering, and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
The Jewel P-WCD includes the following components: Upper Adhesive Electrode Patch, the 
Monitoring and Defibrillation Unit with Lower Adhesive Electrode Patch, and a Connection Cable. A 
schematic is shown below in Figure [ADDRESS_503800]’s torso and pectoral area in an anterior-api[INVESTIGATOR_399760]. Removal Accessories are also provided 
to aid in removing the Jewel and cleaning the skin area.

Upper Adhesive Electrode 
Patch Conformable adhesive patch containing ECG electrodes and a defibrillation electrode. 
Defibrillation Unit with Lower Adhesive Electrode Patch Conformable adhesive patch containing ECG electrodes and a defibrillation electrode.  
All electronics are contained within the Defibrillation Unit, which 
is connected to the Lower Adhesive Electrode Patch and Battery 
Unit. 
Control Buttons are located on the Defibrillation Unit. 
Connection Cable Multi -conductor cable assembly connecting the Upper Adhesive 
Electrode Patch to the Defibrillation Unit with Lower Adhesive 
Electrode Patch. 
The 
Upper Adhesive Electrode Patch is applied to the skin above the right pectoral muscle, and the 
Lower Adhesive Electrode Patch is applied such that  the defibrillation pad area is located along the 
left mid -axillary line. The Jewel can be worn continuously, 24 -hours per day for up to eight (8) 
days, until the Jewel is removed, disassembled, reassembled on a new Patch Unit, and reapplied. This process continues through the end of the prescription period. Figure 2 shows a depi[INVESTIGATOR_399761] a patient.

6.1.2 Therapy and Administration 
The MADIT -RIT study results demonstrated a reduction in inappropriate therapy and all-cause 
mortality when ICDs were programmed to deliv er therapy for tachyarrh ythmias of 200 bpm and 
higher.(5) The Jewel algorithm was designed wi th the MADIT-RIT rate cut-off as a guide for 
determining if a rhythm is life-threatening, requiring therapy.  The Jewel continuously monitors 
sensor data and classifies ECG segments as lif e-threatening or not life-threatening based on 
multiple features. It is designed to recognize lif e-threatening VT or VF and automatically deliver a 
therapeutic shock within 60 seconds of detection of these rhythms. As the Jewel uses multiple 
CONTROLLED COPY - Maintained by [CONTACT_399772] & Effective
Jewel IDE Study 
PR-2053 Rev. E
Confidential   Page 19 of 38 inputs in addition to rate to classify ECG segm ents, it does not allow the physician to program 
heart rate detection thresholds. 
During the prescription period, the Jewel monitors a patient’s ECG through five (5) electrodes 
located on the Adhesive Electrode Patches. The Jewel employs a proprietary algorithm to detect and classify VT or VF that is deemed to be life -threatening (“shockable”) versus cardiac rhythms 
that are non -life threatening (“non -shockable”). In the event of a shockable rhythm, the Jewel 
firmware initiates the charge cycle of the capacito rs and in parallel, the Jewel initiates an alarm 
sequence to alert the patient that the device is preparing to deliver a shock. If the patient is conscious, the patient is instructed to press bo th Control Buttons simultaneously to stop the 
alarms and prevent shock delivery. If the pati ent does not respond and the shockable rhythm 
continues, the Jewel will continue to alarm and will give a verbal warning to by[CONTACT_399790] a 
shock will be delivered and to avoid touching the patient.  
The Jewel delivers the initial therapeutic shock wi th a fixed energy of approximately 150 joules 
using a biphasic truncated exponential defibrillation  waveform using a consta nt energy pulse that 
is adjusted based on the measured transthoracic impedance (TTI) of the patient at the time of 
therapy delivery. Using a cardioversion algorithm, the Jewel attempts to cardiovert the rhythm and 
synchronize the shock with the R -peak of the QRS complex. This automatic synchronization 
delivers a cardioversion shock to a patient if R -peaks are detected, suggesting that the rhythm is a 
life-threatening VT instead of VF. If the cardioversio n algorithm is not able to identify a regular R -
peak during the ventricular arrhythmia, the Jewel delivers an asynchronous defibrillation shock. If 
the Jewel continues to detect a shockable rhyt hm after the initial shock of approximately 150 
joules, the Jewel re -initiates the alarm sequence and verbal warnings, and continues to deliver a 
salvo of up to four (4) additional shocks of a pproximately 162 joules, totaling five (5) consecutive 
shocks (150, 162, 162, 162, 162 joules). If the shoc kable rhythm is successfu lly converted to a non-
shockable rhythm, the Jewel will ‘reset’ and continue monitoring for the occurrence of a new shockable rhythm epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. After delivery of all 5 sh ocks in a salvo or if the Jewel detects asystole, 
the Jewel will play an alarm directing by[CONTACT_399791] 911 and start CPR. 
6.2 Jewel Storage and Accountability 
6.2.1 Acquisition and Accountability 
Subjects will receive the initial Jewel System dire ctly from the site staff or from the Sponsor’s 
representative. The subject will have the initial Jewel applied during training and will return home with one (1) additional Patch Unit. Subjects are expected to replace the Patch Unit on a regular 
basis and as instructed. Used Patch Units shall be  returned directly to the Sponsor using the pre-
paid shippi[INVESTIGATOR_399762]. Patch Units are returned individually as they are removed from the body. When the Sponsor is notified that a subject requires an additional Jewel or additional Patch Units, the Sponsor will send more product directly to the subject’s home. At 
the end of the prescription period, the Jewel device and all supplies will be returned to the Sponsor. 
All Jewel Defibrillation Units are controlled by [CONTACT_399792] (SN) and lot number (LN). Patch Units 
are controlled by [CONTACT_241037] (LN). The Sponsor and site will maintain device accountability logs 
indicating the location of each Jewel. The study site and the Spon sor will maintain logs of serial 
number for all Jewel Defibrillation Units used by [CONTACT_6992].

6.5 Concomitant Therapy 
It is anticipated that subjects will be prescribed me dications for their medical condition(s). For this study, 
a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be prescribed only by a properly 
authorized/licensed clinician. Medications to be re ported on the Case Report Forms (CRFs) include 
concomitant prescription medications and over the counter medications. In addition, medical procedures and other diagnoses occurring during the st udy will be reported. Sites will be responsible for 
collecting information about medications, procedures , and other diagnoses at the time of enrollment, 
and for updating this information as appropriate at each contact [CONTACT_399793].  
7. STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND SUBJECT WITHDR AWAL
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention
Subjects may remove the Jewel if required for situat ional circumstances as listed in the Patient Guid e.
Examp
les include but are not limited to: undergoing a medical procedure (for example, MRI, CT, or with
the use of diathermy), or submerging of the body. Subjects will be counseled  that Jewel re moval for
these reasons should be done as infrequently
 as possible, and only as absolutely required. Th ese
situational 
circumstances do not constitute discontinuation or withdrawal.
Subjects may discontinue use of the Jewel, either temp orarily or permanently, if advised to do so by [CONTACT_33316]. In cases where a subj e
ct discontinues use of the Jewel on their ow n (that is, without
instruction fr
om the Investigator),  a protocol deviation should be filed. Discontinuation based on
Investigator 
orders does not constitute a protocol de viation.
If th
e discontinuation is temporary and does not meet  non-compliance criteria for study discontinuation,
the subject may continue in the study through the dura tion of the prescription period, restarting use of
the 
Jewel either independently or when advised by [CONTACT_3433] e Investigator. Any new clinically releva nt finding

8.1.[ADDRESS_503807] training will occur at the study site as s oon as possible, but no longer than seven (7) days 
after the subject provides informed consent.  
As part of training, a model device will be on  hand to familiarize the subject with the Jewel. 
Subjects will be shown the different alarms that may be heard and trained on how to respond to 
each one. The model device will mimic the initiati on of the VT/VF alarm for the subject to practice 
therapy deferral. Other device interactions including Status Checks, the Press and Hold Alerts, 
battery replacement alerts, and Removal Mode initiation will also be demonstrated. The subject will practice responding to the different alarms and alerts. 
The subject will be shown how to use the Placemen t Accessory to place a Jewel and will practice 
loading the model device into the Placement Acce ssory, putting the Placement Accessory on their 
body and correctly using the alignment markers. The subject will also be shown how to disassemble the Defibrillation Unit from current Patch Unit 
and assemble it to a new Patch Unit. During training, the site personnel, with assist ance from the Sponsor representative, will assess 
the cognitive and physical capabilities of the subj ect. If the subject does  not have the cognitive 
ability to understand the written and verbal instructions or has physical impairments that would 
limit the subject’s ability to feel, see and hear the device notifications, defer a defibrillation shock, 
or apply the device to their body, the subject w ill be considered as having an Exclusion Criteria, 
and will not be enrolled in JEWEL.

representative will educate the subject on the Jewe l to ensure safe and effective use throughout 
the prescribed duration. If present, caregivers w ill be invited to participate in all aspects of the 
training. This training will be perf ormed in a clinical environment.  
As part of the training curriculum, the Patient Guide and the Quick Guide, which the subject will 
take home with him/her, will be utilized to walk  a subject through different aspects of the device 
interaction and care. The Placement Accessory will be  custom fit to the subject to aid in applying 
the device in the correct location. Once the Pl acement Accessory is fit to the subject, the 
dimensions are maintained with mechanical rivets  and Velcro fasteners which are not intended to 
be modified by [CONTACT_423]. In the event a subject gains/loses weight, they can contact [CONTACT_399799] - Maintained by [CONTACT_399772] & Effective

During the wear-time portion of the study, any delivered shocks should be immediately reported 
to the site staff by [CONTACT_392337]/caregiver. Any aborted shocks (i.e. shocks that were 
deferred by [CONTACT_399801] s on the Defibrillation Unit) should also be 
immediately reported to site staff. If the subjec t has an iPhone with the Jewel Mobile App running, 
the App will tell the study site when the subject re places a Patch Unit. If the subject has access to 
the internet, the subject will report the Exchange  using a secure, dedicated weblink. The subject 
will enter changes to her/his health status, any ad verse events, any shocks (deferred or received), 
compliance, needs for assistance, training, or supplies from Element Science, and changes to cardiac, medical, or medication history. If the subject does not have access to the internet, when 
the subject replaces the Patch Unit, the subject will call the site to report the Patch Unit replacement within [ADDRESS_503811]’s health 
status, any adverse events, any shocks (deferred or received), compliance, needs for assistance, training, or supplies from Element Science, and changes to cardiac, medical, or medication history.  
If the subject does not replace a Patch Unit (if the subject has the App), does not report an 
Exchange, or does not contact [CONTACT_399802] a period of ten (10) days or longer since the last date of 
contact, the site staff will contact [CONTACT_399803]-person follow-up visits to 
assess compliance with wearing the Jewel, the need for additional Patch Units or supplies, and to assess any adverse events, any shocks (deferred or  received), compliance, needs for assistance, 
training, or supplies from Element Science, and changes to cardiac, medical, or medication history.  
Data for Any Shock(s) 
If a subject receives a shock or a salvo of shocks  and has the Mobile App, the shock data will be 
sent to the ES Cloud where a Therapy Report will be generated and sent to the Site. If the subject 
does not have the Mobile App, a Sponsor represen tative will go to the subject and download the 
data from the device to generate the Therapy Report.

8.2.1 Definitions 
Adverse Event (AE) 
An Adverse Event is any unfavorable and uninte nded sign, symptom, or disease, temporally 
associated with the use of the Jewel, whether or not it is related to the Jewel. No causal relationship with the clinical trial product is implied by [CONTACT_3794] “Adverse 
Event”. Exacerbations of a pre-existing condition/illness that are defined as a “more frequent occurrence” or as “an increase in the severity of the pre -existing conditions” are considered AEs. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in th e view of either the Investigator, Sponsor, or 
DSMB, it: 
•Results in death;
•Is considere
d life-threatening (meaning that its occurrence places the subject at
immed
iate risk of death. It does not incl ude an adverse event or suspected ad verse
reaction 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.) ;
•Requir
es inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
•Results in persistent or significant incapacity or disability; or
•Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  
An adverse device effect is any AE that is relate d to the Jewel. All ADEs are further categorized as 
anticipated or unanticipated by [CONTACT_1034].  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
As defined in 21 CFR §812.3, a UADE is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-
threatening problem or death caused by, or associat ed with, a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severi ty, or degree of incidence in the investigational 
plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relate s to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
Device Deficiency 
A device deficiency is an inadequacy of a medical device related to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance, such as a ma lfunction, misuse or use error, and inadequate 
labeling. 
8.2.2 Classification of an Adverse Event 
Severity of Event 
All AEs will be assessed for severity by [CONTACT_399804]: 
•Mild – The AE does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject’s normal
functioning
 level and requires minimal or no treatment.
•Moderate –  The AE produces some impairment of function, but is not hazardous to health.
•Severe – The AE produces significant impairment of  function or incapacities an d/or is a
hazard to
 the subject. These events may require systemic therapy or other tr eatment.
CONTROLLED COPY - Maintained by [CONTACT_399772] & Effective
Jewel IDE Study 
PR-2053 Rev. E
Confidential   Page 25 of 38 Relationship to Study Device 
All AEs will be assessed for relationship to th e Jewel by [CONTACT_399805], based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The 
degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below: 
•Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other
possible contributin
g factors can be ruled out. The clinical event occurs in a plau sible
time
 relationship to use of the study device and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_399806].
•Pro
bably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and  the
influence of other factors is un like
ly. The clinical event occurs within a reasonable time
after use of the study device, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or othe r
drugs or 
chemicals.
•Potentially Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship,
however, oth
er factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participan t’s
clini
cal condition, other concomitant even ts). Although an AE may rate only  as
“possibly related” soon after discovery, 
it can be flagged as requiring more inform ation
and later
 be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate.
•Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test re sult,
whose temporal relationship to 
use of the study device makes a causal relationship
improbable
 (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after use of th e
study d
evice) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provid es
plausible expl anations.
•Not Rela
ted – The AE is completely independent of use of the study device, and/ or
evidence e
xists that the event is definitely  related to another etiology. There must be
an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].
Expectedness 
The DSMB will be responsible for determining whether a given AE is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention in the product risk management documentation, device labeling,  protocol, and/or informed consent document. 
In addition to the Potential Risks in Section 2.2.1, the following are anticipated with use of the Jewel: 
•Failure to sense and detect a treatable arrhythmia
•Unsuccessful cardioversion or defibrillati
on
•Inappropriate shock
•Improper, ineffective, or 
non-operation of the device
•Device failure
•Ineffective

AEs and/or SAEs may come to the attention of study personnel during study follow-up phone calls, 
when the subject presents for office visits/medical  care, or upon review of source documents by a 
study monitor.  
All AEs, including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SA Es, will be captured on 
the appropriate CRF. Information to be collected  includes event description, date of onset, 
clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to  the Jewel, and resolution/stabilization of the 
event. All AEs occurring during the study must be documented appropriately, regardless of 
relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution or will be marked as ongoing at the time of study exit.  
Any medical condition present at the time the subj ect is screened will be considered as baseline 
and not reported as an AE. However, if the subjec t’s condition deteriorates at any time during the 
study, that condition’s deterioratio n will be recorded as an AE.  
Changes in severity of an AE will be documented to allow for an assessment of the duration of the

A formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) provides  details of the statistical analyses separately. 
9.1 Statistical Hypotheses 
Primary Effectiveness Endpoint:  
The primary effectiveness endpoint is the rate of inappropriate shock. A one-sided upper 98% 
confidence limit will be calculated for the inappropriate shoc k rate per [ADDRESS_503818] inappropriate shock will not be used. 
The formal hypotheses are: 
H0: Inappropriate shock rate ≥ 2.0 per 100 patient-months 
Ha: Inappropriate shock rate < 2.0 per 100 patient-months. 
Primary Safety Endpoint: 
The primary safety endpoint is the rate of subjects experiencing a clinically significant ADE. The primary 
safety endpoint will use a one-sided, exact 95% upp er confidence bound which will be compared to the 
performance goal of 15%.  The hypoth eses tested will be as follows: 
H0: π ≥ 0.15 
Ha: π < 0.15

10.1.6 Safety Oversight 
All delivered shocks, both appropriate and inappr opriate, will be reviewed and adjudicated by a 
CEC. The CEC will meet regularly, a nd may meet on-demand, as needed. 
Safety oversight will be provided under the dire ction of a DSMB composed of individuals with 
appropriate expertise, including interventional cardiology and/or electrophysiology. Members of the DSMB will be independent from the study conduct and free of conflict of interest, or measures 
will be in place to minimize perceived conflict of  interest. The DSMB will meet regularly to assess 
safety and study conduct. The DSMB will operate under the rules of an approved charter that will 
be written and reviewed at the organizational meeting of the DSMB. At that time, each data element that the DSMB will assess will be clearly defined. The DSMB will provide its input to the 
Sponsor.

of a combination of on-site monito ring visits and centralized reviews of data on an ongoing basis. 
Before acceptance of the clinical data, the Sponso r will review the data entered on electronic case 
report forms (eCRFs) for completeness and adhe rence to the protocol based upon source 
documentation verification (SDV). Procedures to be  followed and the data to be fully monitored to 
SDV will be described in detail in the Clinical Moni toring Plan (CMP). For example, all safety data 
and primary and secondary endpoint measures as defined by [CONTACT_399819] 100% monitored 
against the source data. 
The Sponsor will qualify investigative sites thro ugh review of the adequacy of the subject 
population, facilities, equipmen t and resource needs of the study, and will familiarize the 
Investigator with the study protocol. 
At the time of enrollment, the Sponsor will meet wi th the Investigator to ensure that subjects will 
be properly selected, consented, and enrolled, that the study protocol is thoroughly understood,

Assigned Clinical Monitors of the Sponsor may visit the site(s) periodically during the study to 
perform SDV. Visits may also be performed remotely. The Investigator and Institution must guarantee direct access to all relevant medical re cords by [CONTACT_399820]. 
The study may be subject to a quality assurance audit by [CONTACT_399821]. It is important that the Investigat or and the assigned authorized study personnel are 
available during monitoring visits and possible audits , and that sufficient time is dedicated to the 
process. The site will provide di rect access to all trial related si tes, source data/ documents, and 
reports, for monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_19457], and for inspection by [CONTACT_90471]. In the event of a local or regulatory au thority audit, the site is expected to immediately 
notify the Sponsor of the audit.  
The Sponsor will be responsible for coordinating an d conducting the handling of clinical study data. 
Procedures will be described in detail in the Data  Management Plan and the Statistical Analysis 
Plan. Data quality control checks will be run on th e database on a regular basis. Any missing data, 
anomalies, or questionable fields will be communi cated to the site for clarification/resolution.

eCRF derived from source documents should be co nsistent with the data recorded on the source 
documents.  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the quality and accuracy of the data reported. All data 
generated at the site deemed related to the clin ical trial will be entered into an eCRF via an 
electronic data capture (EDC) system . eCRF data is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the 
site, at the discretion of the PI. Data related to Investigational Produc t accountability and data 
from Jewel that is entered in the EDC will be done via API (Application Programming Interface). 
The EDC will be [ADDRESS_503831] protection and internal quality checks, su ch as automatic range checks, to identify data 
that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate . Clinical data will be entered directly into the 
EDC from the source documents, and within se ven (7) days of data collection if possible. 
Jewel Device Data  
All Jewel devices will be collected by [CONTACT_399822], and the electronic records will be ex tracted and archived as source data. Primary and 
secondary endpoint data will be co llected from analysis and relevant CEC review of the source 
data. For each wear duration, the Jewel records the electrocardiogram, trans-thoracic impedance, 
defibrillation data, algorithm results for every time the shockable rhythm classification algorithm is 
run, all button presses and all alarms. Each  of these data points are time stamped. 
If a subject receives a delivered shock (either appropriate or inappropriate) a report of the 60 seconds preceding and 30 seconds following the shoc k will be provided to the Investigator.

investigation site team. However, if an event is adjudicated by [CONTACT_399824] a cardiac rhythm of interest is observed, the CEC will inform the Inve stigator and provide the relevant supporting data. 
Study Records Retention 
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of two (2) years after the last approval of a marketing application or until at least two (2) ye ars have elapsed since th e formal discontinuation 
of clinical development of the Jewel. These do cuments should be retained for a longer period, 
however, if required by [CONTACT_427]. No re cords will be destroyed without the written consent

TITLE:  Bilateral Continuous Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_146764]-Sternotomy Pain Management: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]  A. Specific Aims/Objectives:  Overall Aim: To evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits of investigating bilateral continuous erector spi[INVESTIGATOR_146766] (BESB) for postoperative pain management in a small cohort of children undergoing surgical sternotomy prior to planning an appropriately powered, randomized, controlled trial of the same. Hypothesis: The investigators’ primary hypothesis is that utilizing bilateral erector spi[INVESTIGATOR_146767]-sternotomy pain is a feasible intervention for consideration in a larger trial by [CONTACT_5024] a 75% or greater successful intervention completion rate without any major adverse outcomes. B. Background and Significance:  Regional anesthesia—and  pediatric regional anesthesia in particular—is a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_146768]-term effects. Regional anesthetics can provide targeted, continuous analgesia to select dermatomes with minimal additional patient risk and as such have become routine components of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-sparing intraoperative and postoperative pain management plans for surgical patients at BCH. In addition to the postulated benefit of reducing overall opi[INVESTIGATOR_146769], regional anesthetics may allow for earlier extubation after selected surgeries, shorter ICU, PACU and inpatient admissions, earlier mobilization, fewer gastrointestinal complications, and improved patient satisfaction scores. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a robust literature supporting the safety and efficacy of regional anesthesia for postoperative pain control across a broad range or surgery types, patient demographics and underlying comorbidities, there are certain classes of surgeries that 

Document date: 2/16/[ADDRESS_167905] (to date) not benefitted from the advantages that regional anesthetics may provide, most notably spi[INVESTIGATOR_146770]. Concerns have been expressed with regard to regional anesthetics for cardiac surgeries in particular (this being the primary surgical type associated with sternotomies in a pediatric populations), given that most patients are pharmacologically anticoagulated to some extent during their procedures and are thus at increased risk for bleeding.1-[ADDRESS_167906] particularly reliable neurological exams in the setting of neuraxial regional anesthetics—potentially resulting in unrecognized acquired neurological defecits. While there is emerging evidence of improved outcomes with neuraxial regional anesthetics in adult cardiac surgery patients,[ADDRESS_167907] important outcome measures when considering perioperative medicine. These include: overall pain management, surgical healing, functional recovery, long term pain symptoms, and emotional/behavioral outcomes after surgery.  Recently, the erector spi[INVESTIGATOR_146771] (ESB) has become popular for providing analgesia after a number of anterior chest and abdominal procedures.7-[ADDRESS_167908] and/or abdominal wall analgesia.[ADDRESS_167909] (BESP) blocks compared with conventional treatment for pain after cardiac surgery in adult patients was published recently (2018) with promising results.[ADDRESS_167910] block in a compressible anatomical space, the ESB is thought to be safe in anticoagulated (or recently anticoagulated) patients.[ADDRESS_167911] becoming a preferred anesthetic option for these pharmacologically or otherwise coagulopathic patients as opposed to neuraxial (e.g. epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873]) and paraneuraxial blocks (i.e. paravertebral) nerve blocks, which are largely contraindicated in this setting.  Given the ESB’s potentially favorable risk profile versus the other blocks that would subserve the same dermatomes (i.e. it is technically less challenging, more distant from critical structures, and thought to be safe in anticoagulated patients) it could provide both a safer and easier to perform regional anesthesia option for many 
Document date: 2/16/2021 3 patients.12  In particular, it offers a new option for a subset of anticoagulated patients for whom other regional techniques (epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873], paravertebral) are contraindicated. This is particularly true for the populations of pediatric cardiac surgical patients at BCH if used bilaterally. Indeed, given the current information available related to the ESB, the regional anesthesia service at BCH has begun employing it when possible in circumstances when a neuraxial or paravertebral block(s) would commonly be used but is/are relatively or absolutely contraindicated. Patients undergoing thoracotomies while anticoagulated for cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476], aortic clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], etc. have been successfully managed with unilateral continuous ESBs.18   In addition, thoracotomies in patients with acquired (e.g. dilutional) and other pathologic coagulopathies have been managed with ESBs. As such, the ESB has been adopted for routine use in specific patient populations at BCH and has even occasionally been utilized in lieu of the more longstanding routine PVBs or epi[INVESTIGATOR_146772]. Retrospective review of BCH outcomes data for [ADDRESS_167912] known and described advantages associated with regional anesthetics for postoperative pain management, it would be prudent to evaluate these blocks in a controlled, randomized, trial. Prior to such a trial, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_146773] a trial is warranted. As such, we propose to evaluate the feasibility of investigating bilateral continuous erector spi[INVESTIGATOR_146766] (BESB) for patients undergoing surgical sternotomy by [CONTACT_3553] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. For this study, ‘feasibility’ will be defined primarily as a successful intervention completion rate of 75% or greater of all subjects with no major adverse outcomes. Secondary measures of feasibility will include aggregate ‘data integrity’ as defined by [CONTACT_146811] 75% or greater of all possible data points for successfully completed subjects as well as ‘efficient intervention duration’ as evaluated by [CONTACT_146812] [ADDRESS_167913] surgery19, shoulder surgery20, thoracotomy/thoracoscopic surgery9,21, thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_61691],22 and ventral abdominal surgery7.

Document date: 2/16/[ADDRESS_167914] one published prospective study in adults,16 but similar studies in pediatric patients are yet to be undertaken. IN general, there is much less published evidence in children; however there are case reports and case series describing its use for patients undergoing thoracic and abdominal surgery12,24-26.   Large retrospective analyses of multiple pediatric regional anesthesia registries do exist and consistently report a very favorable safety profile for the provision of regional anesthetics in the pediatric population. A recent (2015) consensus statement from the American and European Societies of regional anesthesia (ASRA and ESRA) reported the risk profile of administering regional anesthetics to anesthetized children, citing a risk of postoperative neurologic symptoms of 0.93/1000 cases (>90% of which resolve completely within 1 month) and a rate of local anesthetic systemic toxicity of 0.08/[ADDRESS_167915] recently been accepted for presentation at the major regional anesthesia conference in the US.29,30  D. Design and Methods  (1) Study Design We propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. This will be a 10-patient pi[INVESTIGATOR_146774] (BESB) for patients undergoing surgical sternotomy. ‘Feasibility’ will be defined primarily as a successful protocol completion rate of 75% or greater of all subjects with no major adverse outcomes. Secondary feasibility outcomes will include aggregate ‘data integrity’ as defined by [CONTACT_146811] 75% or greater of all possible data points for successfully completed subjects as well as ‘efficient intervention duration’ as evaluated by [CONTACT_146812] 40 minutes.  Children and adolescents aged 3-21 years of age will be recruited from [LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  (2) Patient Selection, Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria and Recruitment Method  Patients from BCH who meet the criteria below will be considered for recruitment: 
Document date: 2/16/2021 5 Inclusion Criteria:  1. Scheduled as part of the cardiac surgical ERAS program. 2. Scheduled for a primary sternotomy. 3. Ages 5-21 years. Exclusion Criteria:  1. Patients undergoing reoperative procedures. 2. Significant scoliosis or other anatomic contraindications to ESB.  3. History of bleeding or current therapeutic dose anticoagulant use. 4. Significant intraoperative hemodynamic instability or bleeding, as ascertained by [CONTACT_146813]. 5. Patients with severe neurodevelopmental delays.  6. Patients with previous chronic pain syndromes.  7. Patients with a history of opi[INVESTIGATOR_146775] 2 months prior to surgery.  8. Lack of parental consent and/or child assent. Recruitment Method: We plan to include national and international pediatric patients who are scheduled for in-patient surgery at BCH over a period of 1 year. Patients will be recruited by [CONTACT_146814]. Each morning, a designated member of the study staff will review the upcoming surgical schedule to identify pediatric cases that fit the study criteria (procedure type and age). If these criteria are met, the case will be sent to an investigator for further clinical review. A final eligibility decision will be made by [CONTACT_978]. 1. Outpatients with procedures scheduled >2 weeks from identification: Patients will be sent information on the study (cover letter, brochure, consent form) up to 2 weeks prior to their surgery or scheduled preoperative visit.  This will be sent either by [CONTACT_146815] e-mail is on file. 2. Outpatients with procedures scheduled 2 weeks or less from identification: Patients will be contact[CONTACT_146816]/or given informational materials at their preoperative visit if we are unable to send mailers reliably VIA USPS.  We will allow at least a day for them to consider participating in the study. 3. Outpatient telephone follow-up: Patients sent information packets either by [CONTACT_146817] (the next week for USPS and no sooner than 1 day following email). If materials have not been received, patients will be given the opportunity to have those materials sent or be contact[CONTACT_6811] a preoperative visit.  4. Inpatients with no planned discharge and/or preoperative clinic appointments: Patients who are already inpatient will be approached on the patient floor or other inpatient encounter with study information. We will approach as soon as we have confirmed eligibility and will provide them with recruitment materials 
Document date: 2/16/[ADDRESS_167916] 24 hours for a decision to be made.  5. International patients: For international patients, recruitment materials will not be mailed internationally. If an e-mail is available for an eligible international patient, a secure e-mail via BCH server will be sent if the family is noted to be English-speaking. The e-mail will include all approved recruitment documents. If we are unable to reach an international family via e-mail, eligible international patients and their families will be approached and provided materials in the preoperative clinic. At this time we will provide information about the study, answer all questions and allow at least [ADDRESS_167917] in participation.    (3) Description of Study Treatments or Exposures/Predictors   Participants will have their medical record reviewed following enrollment for demographic information including: gender, age, weight and height, procedure, surgeon, laterality (if applicable), and current and historical medication use.   Enrolled patients will have bilateral erector spi[INVESTIGATOR_146766] (with catheters for postoperative local anesthetic infusion) placed by [CONTACT_83196] a sterile fashion after of the surgical procedure is complete as follows:  • The patient is placed in a lateral decubitus position (left or right), with all pressure points padded in routine fashion. • The area for intervention is prepped with a chlorhexidine solution, and sterile drapes are applied to demarcate the block placement area. • The T4/5 transverse process on one side is identified with the ultrasound transducer in a parasagittal orientation. • An 18g Tuohy needle is advanced to the target area under direct ultrasound visualization. The needle tip is advanced until it contacts the transverse process, just below the erector spi[INVESTIGATOR_146776]. • Normal saline is injected to confirm appropriate needle tip position.  The erector spi[INVESTIGATOR_146777] • With confirmation of appropriate needle tip position, the initial local anesthetic bolus is injected using a weight-based dosing protocol (generally 0.75ml/kg of straight 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]).  • Following the bolus injection, a catheter is threaded into the space occupi[INVESTIGATOR_146778]. 
Document date: 2/16/2021 7 • Catheter tip position is verified by [CONTACT_10980]: ultrasound visualization of the catheter tip, ultrasound visualization of instilled normal saline and/or ultrasound visualization of a small hyperechoic (i.e. bright on ultrasound) injection of air. • With the catheter tip position identified, the catheter is tunneled to a cutaneous exit point approximately 2-3cm from the incision using a Crawford needle. • The catheter is dressed in standard fashion with an adhesive catheter anchor, Dermabond, Mastisol, Tegaderm and tape. • This is repeated for the contralateral side. To the extent possible, this will be done without repositioning in a contralateral decubitus position. • A label indicating that each catheter is a nerve-block catheter with its laterality and date of placement noted is applied to each catheter. • Catheter placement is complete. • Postoperative infusion of local anesthetic (per weight based protocol) via the nerve block catheter is initiated (the standard infusion is straight 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] @ 0.25ml/kg/hr with a usual combined max rate of 15ml/hr).  All patients will have access to rescue opi[INVESTIGATOR_146779]/NCA demand protocols utilized at BCH.  In addition, all patients will be followed by [CONTACT_146818], enabling access to additional assessment, catheter and infusion management and opi[INVESTIGATOR_146780] 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Floor/ICU nursing personnel are encouraged to call the Acute Pain Service if they feel pain management is not adequate in any case – this will be reinforced for patients included in this trial. In addition, one of the primary investigators will be available for consultation 24 hours a day to the Acute Pain Service for any desired consultation on study patients.   E. Definition of Primary and Secondary Outcomes/Endpoints   Feasibility: Primary: • Feasibility: ‘Feasibility’ will be defined primarily as a successful intervention completion rate of 75% or greater of all subjects with no major adverse outcomes.  Secondary: • Data integrity: Data integrity will be considered satisfactory if there is successful collection of 75% or greater of all collectible catheter follow-up data points, in aggregate, for successfully completed subjects. • Efficiency: The treatment will be considered to have an ‘efficient intervention duration’ if the intervention completion time is found to be less than 40 minutes.

While in the OR, the time required for installing and dressing the catheters, functional assessments, and any complications during placement will be recorded. The surgical procedure and the total surgical time will also be recorded along with any relevant surgical complications. Each subsequent day of the study (Day 1=24 hours, Day 2 =48 hours), the catheter will be assessed for following adverse events: Presence or absence of catheter dislodgement (catheter out or no longer in a clinically effective position), catheter occlusion, catheter leakage (presence of local anesthetic under occlusive dressing), skin irritation (presence of hyperemic cutaneous reaction not present at dressing placement), and catheter infection (presence of purulent material) by a member of the study team. Intubation status (including extubation time, where indicated), catheter boluses and catheter rate adjustments (if present) will be recorded. Patients’ costs and charges will be collected electronically in order understand the healthcare value of this novel pain management strategy Research information collected on paper (or other physical media) during the study will be stored in locked cabinets with access limited to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_146781]. Information that has been generated as, or transferred to, electronic media will be kept on password protected, secured data servers. All health information is protected by [CONTACT_2373] (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and all health records will be kept confidential. Patients’ birthdate, name, and all other identifying information will be removed when analyzing and reporting the data. Any personal identifying information will be stored separately from the other information provided by [CONTACT_146819]. Identifying information will be kept in a password protected, secure file with limited access by [CONTACT_2710]. Once data collection is complete, identifying information will be destroyed.  G. Data Management Methods All relevant information retrieved from the electronic medical record, by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or a member of the research team will be translated into an electronic form. Data collected in paper case report forms will be entered into a standard, secured database for intake and checking, and will be protected by [CONTACT_146820]. Only authorized users are permitted access to the data files, and daily server back-up activities are executed to ensure data safety. All data will be stored on a password-
Document date: 2/16/[ADDRESS_167919] protected.  Procedures to ensure accurate and reliable data collection will include well-designed data forms and training.   H. Study Timeline We plan to enroll a total of 10 patients in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  We will then match enrolled patients from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_146782] (ERAS Cardiac) program (IRB # P00029161) in a 1:2 ratio for a total of 30 patients altogether. All patients in this study will already be part of the enhanced recovery after cardiac surgery clinical program (a quality improvement program). We anticipate that it would take approximately 8 months to complete enrollment and data collection for this study.  I.  Adverse Event Criteria and Reporting Procedures  Adverse or unanticipated events will be reported as required to the [LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_146783]. An Adverse Event refers to any untoward medical occurrence whether or not it is considered intervention-related. As noted above, analysis of the retrospective outcomes data for the [ADDRESS_167920] little prospective outcomes data related to the ES block, we will implement a rigorous system to follow and report any adverse events, including interim analyses by a non-blinded statistician, as described below:  Adverse Event Monitoring: Adverse outcomes will be carefully tracked for all patients enrolled in the study.   Enrollment will be halted and the IRB informed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_146784]:  • 1 of any of the following serious adverse events: o Patient death. o Pneumothorax o Hematoma at the site of the catheter/block—causing pain or any neurological symptoms for the patient. o Persistent neurologic symptoms lasting more than 3 days after a single shot block or catheter is removed. 
Document date: 2/16/2021 10 o Local anesthetic systemic toxicity (any symptoms leading to this diagnosis by a study team participant)  •  >2 of any of the following minor/moderate adverse events in aggregate: o Persistent bleeding at the site of the catheter insertion or block placement.  o Leakage of local anesthetic from the catheter insertion site that leads to discontinuation of the catheter infusion. o Redness or superficial infection of the catheter site or site of the block placement.  o Skin irritation at the site of the catheter insertion or block placement that results in greater than [ADDRESS_167921]. Reports will be done in an aggregated fashion.   Special note regarding ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]: Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_146785]. It is routinely used at BCH for all nerve blocks and regional anesthetics. Known potential adverse advents of this mode of delivery of this medication include hypersensitivity, allergic reaction, hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias if injected intravascularly. The presence of any of these will be assessed by [CONTACT_146821]. Any occurrence of a possible adverse event or events will be documented and reported to the DSMB, the IRB and the Department of Anesthesia Quality Assurance Physician as appropriate. In the event of a serious adverse event, it will be reported to the DSMB and IRB immediately and the study halted until a thorough investigation into the cause can be made. The relative safety of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_146786] (PRAN) database. The PRAN is a consortium of major pediatric centers in North America that manages a prospective data registry on pediatric regional anesthesia. From their database, which at this time comprises more than 130,000 pediatric regional anesthetics from numerous major centers in the US and Canada, ropi[INVESTIGATOR_146787] 85% of pediatric regional with a safety profile at least equivalent to, if not better than, bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].31  Further, ropi[INVESTIGATOR_146788]. There is an extensive body of prospective clinical trials and clinical outcomes studies on ropi[INVESTIGATOR_146789], safety and clinical outcomes from infancy through adolescence.   Our prescribing practices at BCH in the Regional Anesthesia and Acute Pain Services are derived from that body of PK information and consensus recommendations.   
Document date: 2/16/[ADDRESS_167922], secure database and merged into Statistical Analysis Systems 9.3 (or more recent) for purposes of analysis. Missing data will be accounted for when the data is coded into respective variables. Descriptive statistics will be generated in order to summarize demographic characteristics of patients enrolled. Data will be evaluated subsequently with regard to the above-mentioned criteria for ‘feasibility.’    Adverse events and complications (if any) associated with the blocks will be recorded and categorized. Matched groups will be compared for demographic data, Patients costs and charges, risk factors, diagnosis, procedure, and cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_146822]. Once data collection is complete, identifying information will be destroyed.  L.  Sample Size Considerations  As this is not a powered study but rather a pi[INVESTIGATOR_108605] a protocol, no power analysis has been performed. The investigators believe, given their experience with this block in other surgical populations, that a cohort of 10 patients will be satisfactory to assess the primary outcome of ‘feasibility.’ However, the investigators recognize that the sample size is such that no statistically significant conclusions related to potential benefits may be realizable. Nevertheless, such data should be sufficient to power a more formal study.  M.  Study Organization  Drs. Morgan Brown, Roland Brusseau, Andrea Gomez Morad, Viviane Nasr and Nathalie Roy will serve as principal investigators. Patient screening, recruitment,

stent diameter 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.0, 3.25, 3.5 and 4.0 mm; stent 
length 8, 12, 15, 18, 23, 28, 33, and 38 mm. Stent lengths 33 
mm and 38 mm are not available for 2.25 mm diameter stent. 
• XIENCE Sierra Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System: 
stent diameter 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.0, 3.25, 3.5 and 4.0 mm; stent 
length 8, 12, 15, 18, 23, 28, 33, and 38 mm. 
The above listed  XIENCE stent s will hereinafter be called 
“XIENCE” in this trial .  
Objective  The objective of this trial is to evaluate safety of 1 -month  (as short as 
28 days) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in subjects at high risk of 
bleeding (HBR) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI) with XIENCE.  
 
Primary Objective:  to show non- inferiority of the primary endpoint 
of all death or all MI (modified ARC) from 1 to 6 months following XIENCE implantation in HBR subjects  treated with  1-month DAPT 
compared to a historical control after propensity score adjustment.   
Secondary Objective : to show superiority of the major secondary 
endpoint of major bleeding ( Bleeding Ac ademic Research 
Consortium [BARC]  type 2-5) from 1 to 6 months following 
XIENCE implantation in HBR s ubjects treated with 1 -month DAPT 
compared to a historical control after propensity score adjustment.   
                                                 
1 For each geography included in the trial  (US and Canada) , only approved and commercially  available 
XIENCE stent(s) in that geography will be used.  
Abbott Vascular  Version A  
XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study #ABT -CIP-[ADDRESS_233382] 
registration is capped at 75 per site.   
Clinical Trial 
Design  A prospective, single arm, multi -center, open label, non -randomized 
trial to eva luate the safety of 1 -month ( as short as  28 days) DAPT in 
HBR subjects undergoing PCI with XIENCE . 
Primary Endpoint  The primary endpoint is a composite rate of all death or all 
myocardial infarction (modified 2Academic Research Consortium 
[ARC]) from 1 to 6 months 
Major Secondary 
Endpoints  Major bleeding rate (BARC type 2 -5) from 1 to 6 months.  
Secondary 
Endpoints  The following endpoints will be assessed from 1 to 6 months:  
• Stent thrombosis (ARC definite/probable, ARC definite)  
• All death, cardiac death, vascular death, non-cardiovascular death 
• All myocardial infarction (MI) and MI attributed to target vessel 
(TV-MI, modified ARC)  
• Composite of cardiac death or MI (modified ARC) 
• Composite of all death or all MI (modified ARC) 
• All stroke, ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic str oke  
• Clinically -indicated target lesion revascularization (CI- TLR)  
• Clinically -indicated target vessel revascularization (CI -TVR)  
• Target lesion failure (TLF, composite of cardiac death, TV -MI 
and CI- TLR)  
• Target vessel failure (TVF, composite of cardiac d eath, TV- MI 
and CI- TVR)  
• Major b leeding defined by [CONTACT_196552] (BARC) type 3-5   
The primary endpoint and major secondary endpoint, as well as the above secondary endpoints will also be assessed from 6 months to 12 
months and from 1 month to 12 months. 
                                                 
2 Patients present any of the following clinical or imaging evidence of ischemia (symptoms of ischemia;  ECG 
changes  indicative of new ischemia -  [new ST -T changes or new LBBB],  development of pathological Q 
waves;  or  imaging evidence of a new loss of  viable myocardium or a new regional wall  motion abnormality), 
AND confirmed with elevated cardiac biomarkers  per ARC criteria  (periprocedural MI: CK -MB > 3x URL or 
Troponin > 3x UR L within 48 hours after PCI; CK -MB > 5x URL or Troponin > 5x URL within 72 hours after 
CABG; Assessment of CK -MB is preferred over troponin for the diagnosis of periprocedural MI, if possible. 
For spontaneous MI:  CK-MB > URL or Troponin > URL) (Circulation  2007; 116: 2344 -2351)   
Abbott Vascular  Version A  
XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study #ABT -CIP-[ADDRESS_233383] index procedure, upon confirmation 
of the following:  
• Signed informed consent has been obtained;  
• Subject has met all the inclusion and none of the exclusion 
criteria (including both general and angiographic criteria). 
Subject Follow -
Up Subjects registered in the trial will receive the following clinical 
follow-up: 
• 1 month (28-35 days ): office visit  (Note: a formal office visit is 
required at 1-month follow-up to ensure a thorough clinical evaluation. A telephone contact [CONTACT_196553]-up due to being unable to 
complete an office visit , but a formal follow- up visit is still 
preferred at 1-month.) 
• 3 months (90 ±  7 days): office visit/ telephone contact (office 
visit is strongly recommended whenever possible) 
• 6 months (180 ±  14 days): office visit/telephone contact (office 
visit is strongly recommended whenever possible) 
• 12 months (365 ±  28 days): office visit/telephone contact (office 
visit is strongly recommended whenever possible)  
Primary Analysis 
Sample Size 
Justification  To evaluate the safety of 1 -month DAPT, non-inferiority (NI) will be 
tested comparing 1 -month DAPT to XIENCE V [LOCATION_003] historical 
control for the primary endpoint of all death or all all MI (modified 
ARC) from 1 - to 6-month follow-up in a “1-month clear” population 
(defined as subjects who are free from myocardial infarction [modified ARC], repeat coronary revascularization, stroke, or stent 
thrombosis [ARC definite/probable] within 1 month (prior to 1-
month visit but at least 28 days) after stent ing AND have been 
compliant with 1 -month DAPT without interruption of either aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34311]/or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for > 7 consecutive days).  
 
This analysis will be stratified by [CONTACT_196554]: 
 
• True event rate for the primary endpoint is assumed to be 
approximately 4.3% for both arms 
• One-sided alpha = 0.025 
• Attrition rate of 10%  
• Sample size:

XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study Protocol Version A  December 4, 2018 − Test arm:  a total of ~1600 subjects pooled from the XIENCE 
28 [LOCATION_003] Study  and the XIENCE 28 Global Study  * 
− Historical control: ~1400 “1 -month clear” subjects from  the 
XIENCE V [LOCATION_003]  
• Non-inferiority margin = 2.5% 
• Approximately 90% power  
* XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] will contribute a minimum of 40% out of the 
total [ADDRESS_233384] of major  bleeding rate ( BARC type 2 -5) from 1- to 
6-month follow- up will be tested against XIENCE V [LOCATION_003] historical 
control stratified by [CONTACT_196555].  
 
Details of the major secondary analys is can be found in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Antiplatelet 
Medication  Antiplatelet Medication  Loading Dose:  
• Subjects must receive a loading dose of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251]/or a P2Y12 
inhibitor (Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], Prasugrel or Ticagrelor). The dosages of 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251] P2Y12 inhibitor shall be determined by [CONTACT_196556] g dose usage. The 
choice of P2Y12 inhibitor is per site standard of care, but clopi[INVESTIGATOR_196510]. The 
loading of P2Y12 inhibitor can be omitted only if the subject is 
on chronic usage (≥ 7 days). Subjects that are not on chronic 
usage must be loaded with P2Y12 inhibitor. It is recommended 
that the subject be loaded with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], even if the subject is on 
chronic usage of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (≥ 7 days) .  
Antiplatelet Medication Post -Procedure Daily Dose:  
• All subjects must receive ≥75 to ≤[ADDRESS_233385] maintain a minimum of 75 mg of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_196511] 5 or 10 mg of prasugrel daily ([ADDRESS_233386] subjects*) or 90 mg twice daily of ticagrelor 
for 1 month (as short as 28 days)  following the procedure.

XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study Protocol Version A  December 4, 2018 − The choice of P2Y12 inhibitor is per site standard of care, 
but clopi[INVESTIGATOR_196512].  
− For subjects taking chronic anticoagulants, dual therapy 
(oral anticoagulant and a P2Y12 inhibitor, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_196513]) may be considered within the first month  post 
index procedure per investigator’s discretion.  
• At 1-month follow up, subject will be assessed for their 
eligibility of P2Y12 inhibitor discontinuation. Eligible subjects 
will discontinue P2Y12 inhibitor as early as 28 days and receive 
≥75 to ≤100 mg of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_196514] 1- year follow -up during 
the trial if they are “1 -month clear”, defined as subjects who are 
free from myocardial infarction (modified ARC), repeat coron ary 
revascularization, stroke, or stent thrombosis (ARC 
definite/probable) within 1 month (prior to [ADDRESS_233387] 28 days ) after stenting AND have been compliant with 1-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) without interruption of 
either asp irin and/or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for > [ADDRESS_233388] month (anticoagulant and a P2Y12 inhibitor) will discontinue the 
P2Y12 inhibitor after 1 month if they are assessed as “1-month 
clear”. These subjects will start aspi[INVESTIGATOR_196515]. 
If a subject was event -free and DAPT compliant (as defined 
above) during the first month, but does not stop P2Y12 inhibitor 
after the 1 -month visit, due to physician’s or subject’s decision, 
this subject will be considered as “1 -month not clear”.  If the 
physician judges that a 3-month DAPT duration, instead of 1-
month duration, would be more appropriate for the subject, the 
physician has the option to transfer the subject to the XIENCE [ADDRESS_233389] to provide consent prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_196516] 3 days after the index procedure, only if the site confirms that the protocol required 
DAPT regimen is site’s standard of care.  
− Peri-procedural MI (occurred within [ADDRESS_233390] index 
procedure) without any clinical symptoms will not be 
considered exclusionary event for the definition of “1-
month clear”.

XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study Protocol Version A  December 4, 2018 − Dual therapy (oral anticoagulant and a P2Y12 inhibitor, 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_196517]) within the first month post index 
procedure for subjects who are on chronic anticoagulants 
is acceptable for the definition of “1 -month clear”.  
• Subjects who are not “1 -month clear” are NOT eligible for 
P2Y12 inhibitor discontinuation at 1 -month. These subjects will 
be treated per the investigator's discretion and will continue to be 
followed up through 12 months. 
*For prasugrel subjects < 60 kg in weight or ≥ 75 years of age, a 
maintenance dose of 5 mg per day is allowed .  
Cardiac 
Biomarker 
Collection  Cardiac biomarker CK, CK -MB and/or troponin collection shall be 
done per site’s standard of care.   
Key Inclusion 
Criteria  General Inclusion Criteria  
1. Subject is considered at high risk for bleeding (HBR), defined as 
meeting one or more of the following criteria at the time of 
registration and in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_117751], the risk

a) ≥ 75 years of age.  
b) Clinical indication for chronic (at least 6 months) or 
lifelong anticoagulation therapy.  
c) History of major bleeding which required medical 
attention within 12 months of the index procedure.

platelet count <100,000/mm3, or any known coagulation 
disorder associated with increased bleeding risk).  
g) Anemia with hemoglobin < 11g/dl. 
2. Subject must be at least [ADDRESS_233391] (IRB)  of the respective clinical 
site prior to any trial related procedure.

XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study #ABT -CIP-[ADDRESS_233392] is transferred to the XIENCE 90 study after 
the 1- month visit assessment  
 
Angiographic Inclusion Criteria  
1. Up to three target lesions with a maximum of two target lesions 
per epi[INVESTIGATOR_196518]. Note:  
• The definition of epi[INVESTIGATOR_196519] ( LAD), left circumflex coronary 
artery (LCX) and right coronary artery (RCA) and their 
branches. For example, the subject must not have >2 lesions 
requiring treatment within both the LAD and a diagonal 
branch in total.  
• If there are two target lesions within the same epi[INVESTIGATOR_196520], the two target lesions must be at least 15 mm apart per 
visual estimation ; otherwise this is considered as a single 
target lesion.  
2. Target lesion must be located in a native coronary artery with 
visually estimated reference vessel diameter between 2.25 mm 
and 4.25 mm.  
3. Exclusive use of XIENCE family of stent systems during the

4. Target lesion has been treated successfully , which is defined as 
achievement of a final in -stent residual diameter stenosis of 
<20% with f inal TIMI -3 flow  assessed by [CONTACT_196557], with no residual dissection 
NHLBI grade ≥ type B, and no transient or sustained 
angiographic complications (e.g., distal embolization, side branch 
closure), no chest pain lasting > [ADDRESS_233393] segment 
elevation  > 0.5mm  or depression lasting > [ADDRESS_233394]-
segment elevation MI (STEMI) .  
Abbott Vascular  Version A  
XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study #ABT -CIP-[ADDRESS_233395] has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], heparin/bivalirudin, P2Y12 inhibitors 
(clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]/prasugrel/ticagrelor), everolimus, cobalt, 
chromium, nickel, tungsten, acrylic and fluoro polymers or 
contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately pre -medicated.  
3. Subject with implantation of another drug- eluting stent (other 
than XIENCE) within [ADDRESS_233396] has a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)

5. Subject judged by [CONTACT_196558] P2Y12 inhibitor use at [ADDRESS_233397].  
Note : Female subjects of childbearing potential should be 
instructed to use safe contraception (e.g., intrauterine devices, 
hormonal contraceptives: contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], implants, 
transdermal patches, hormonal vaginal devi ces, injections with 
prolonged release.) It is accepted, in certain cases, to include 
subjects having a sterilised regular partner or subjects using a 
double barrier contraceptive method. However, this should be 
explicitly justified in special circumstance s arising from the trial 
design, product characteristics and/or trial population  
10. Presence of other anatomic or comorbid conditions, or other 
medical, social, or psychological conditions that, in the 
investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], could limit the subject’s ability  to 
participate in the clinical investigation or to comply with

2. Target lesion is located within an arterial or saphenous vein 
graft.  
3. Target lesion is restenotic from a previous stent implantation.  
4. Target lesion  is a chronic total occlusion (CTO, defined as 
lesion with  TIMI flow [ADDRESS_233399] 3 months). 
5. Target lesion is implanted with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_196521], whether 
planned or for bailout. 
 
Note: If there is more than one target lesion, all target lesions must 
satisfy the angiographic eligibility criteria. Non-target lesion (i.e., 
lesions that do not meet the angiographic criteria listed above) 
treatments are not allowed during the index procedure.  
Index Procedure  • Only XIENCE stent can be used for target lesion(s). Stent

the primary and major secondary analyses. 
 
1.0 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Trial Design  
XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study is a prospective, single arm, multi-center, open label  trial to evaluate 
the safety of 1-month (as short as 28 days) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in subjects at 
high risk of bleeding (HBR) undergoing percutaneous coronary i ntervention (PCI) w ith the 
approved XIENCE family of coronary drug- eluting stents . 
The XIENCE family s tent systems include FDA approved XIENCE Xpedition Everolimus 
Eluting Coronary Stent System (EECSS), XIENCE Alpi[INVESTIGATOR_196524], Inc.  The above listed XIENCE 
stent s will hereinafter be called “ XIENCE ” in this trial. For each geography included in the 
trial (US and Canada), only approved and commercially available XIENCE stent(s) in that geography will be used. 
A minimum of 640 subjects to a maximum of  800 subjects fr om approximately 50 sites in 
the [LOCATION_002] (US) and Canada will be registered  in this trial. Subject registration is 
capped at 75 per site.  Trial  population consists of non-complex HBR subjects  with up to three  
native coronary artery lesions (a maximum of two lesions per epi[INVESTIGATOR_196518] ) with 
reference vessel diameter between 2.25  mm and 4.25 mm . Eligibility of P2Y12 receptor 
inhibitor discontinuation will be assessed at 1-month follow-up. Subjects who are free from 
myocardial infarction (modified ARC), repeat coronary revascularization, stroke, or stent thrombosis (ARC definite/probable) within  1 month ( prior to 1-month visit but at least 28 
days) after stenting AND have been compliant with 1-month DAPT  without interruption of 
either aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251]/or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for > 7 consecutive days are considered as “1-month clear”, and will discontinue P2Y12 receptor inhibitor as early as [ADDRESS_233400] index procedure.  
The data collected from the XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study  will be pooled with the data from the 
XIENCE 28 Global Study (Protocol #  ABT -CIP-[ZIP_CODE]) to compare with the his torical 
control of non- complex HBR subjects treated with standard DAPT duration of up to [ADDRESS_233401]-approval study to evaluate the 
safety of XIENCE V EECSS in “all -comer” population under real-world setting . The 
XIENCE V [LOCATION_003] Study has been completed with a total of 8040 subjects enrolled, of which, ~[ADDRESS_233402] 800 subjects globally outside US . The XIENCE 28 Global Study 
and the current XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study share similar study design regarding inclusion/exclusion criteria, DAPT treatment strategy and follow up schedule, which supports the pooling of the two trial results.

XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study Protocol Version A  December 4, 2018 1.2 Trial Objective  
The objective of this trial is to evaluate safety of 1 -month (as short as 28 days)  dual 
antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in subjects at high risk of bleeding (HBR) undergoing 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with XIENCE.  
 
Primary Objective:  to show non- inferiority of the  primary endpoint of all death or all MI 
(modified ARC) from 1 to 6 months following XIENCE implantation in HBR subjects  
treated with  1-month DAPT compared to a historical control after propensity score 
adjustment.  
Secondary Objective : to show superiority of the major secondary endpoint of major 
bleeding ( Bleeding Academic Research Consortium [BARC]  type 2-5) from 1 to 6 months 
following XIENCE implantation in HBR s ubjects treated with 1 -month DAPT compared to a 
historical control after propensity score adjustment.   
2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
2.1 Background and Rationale 
Long- term dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) is known to increase the risk of bleeding.  
Multiple studies have demonstrated the relationship between bleeding and an increased risk 
of short- and long- term mortality3,4, with major bleeding being identified as an independent 
predictor of mortality with a weight similar to or even greater than myocardial infarction (MI)
5.  A recent meta-analysis by [CONTACT_196559] 12 trials comprising > 34,[ADDRESS_233403] important benefit with short- term DAPT, which is especially relevant for 
patients who are at high risk of bleeding (HBR).  
HBR patients represent a pproximately 15% or more of the current percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) population.7,[ADDRESS_233404] -2 (randomized evaluation of PCI

XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study Protocol Version A  December 4, 2018 underrepresented from traditional drug eluting stent (DES) trials.  The optimal duration of DAP T for HBR sub jects is yet to be determined . For some HBR patients, prolonging DAPT 
even beyond one month may be detrimental and hazardous. This is a challenging patient 
cohort requiring a trial designed to further optimize  their therapy needs for DAPT after 
coronary revascularization.  Given  the lack of specific data in this arena for DES, the current 
ACC/AHA guideline s recommend use of bare metal stent ( BMS) with 1 -month DAPT
 9. 
While this strategy aims to minimize the risk of bleeding in such patients, the use of BMS 
poses a higher risk of restenosis and re- intervention. Therefore, stenting with a DES followed 
by a shortened course of DAPT may represent a more favorable treatment option if there is 
no significant increase in ischemic events.  
There is limited clinical data with 1 month DAPT after DES  in HBR population.  The 
LEADERS FREE study is a randomized, double-blind trial evaluating BioFreedom combined 
with 1 month of DAPT for treating HBR patients undergoing PCI as compared to BMS.10  A 
total of 2,466 HBR patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to BioFreedom or a similar BMS (Gazelle).  The primary safety endpoint, tested for both noninferiority and superiority, was a composite of cardiac death, MI, or stent thrombosis (definite/probable).  The pri mary efficacy 
endpoint was clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD -TLR).  At 1 year, the rate 
of the composite endpoint of cardiac death, MI, or stent thrombosis was significantly lower in the BioFreedom group than in the BMS group (9.4% (112/1221) vs. 12.9% (154/1211); p < 0.001 for noninferiority and p=0.005 for superiority).  The 1- year rate of CD -TLR was also 
significantly lower in the BioFreedom group than in the BMS group (5.1% (59/1221) vs. 9.8% (113/1211), p <0.001).  There was also a significant reduction in the 1- year rate of MI 
with BioFreedom compared with BMS (6.1% vs. 8.9%, p = 0.01), whereas no differences in the 1-year rates of stent thrombosis were observed between the two groups (2.0% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.75).  Consistent results were also demonstrated in a pre-specified HBR subgroup analysis from ZEUS trial with 1 -month DAPT, which showed favorable outcomes with Endeavor 
group versus BMS group. In this HBR substudy, MACE (death, MI, or target vessel revascularization) occurred in 22.6% of the Endeavor group and 29% of the BMS group with a hazard ratio 0.75 (p=0.033)
 11. The definite or probable ST was also significantly reduced in 
the Endeavor group (2.6% vs. 6.2%, p=0.016). Results from both ZEUS and LEADER FREE suggest that DES can be a safer choice for HBR patients than BMS with short duration of 
DAPT .  Based on these data, the most recent 2017 ESC guideline recommended 3-month 
DAPT  (Class IIa) in high bleeding risk patients with stable CAD  and 1-month DAPT (Class 
IIb) for those patients in whom 3-m onth DAPT poses safety concerns.
12 
The second generation XIENCE everolimus-eluting stent (EES) has been the subject of extensive clinical studies . Consistently low late and very late stent thrombosis rate s have been 
reported with EES fr om randomized controlled studies as well  as real -world registry studies. 
Results from several  recent large scale meta- analyses demonstrated th at EES has a better

XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study Protocol Version A  December 4, 2018 safety profile than BMS and other DES,13,14 even in complex patient groups who are known 
at high risk of ischemic events such as diabetes and STEMI.15,16 17 The excellent safety 
profile of XIENCE is likely attributed to the unique combination of its thin struts (81 µm), 
the thromboresistant nature of the biocompatible fluoropolymer, and a low loading dose and release kinetics of the anti -proliferative agent, everolimus. The unique combination of the 
specific design features in XIENCE may lead to a more rapid endothelial coverage of strut surface and faster arterial healing compared with the other DES.  Pre-clinical studies of 
endothelialization demonstrated that  XIENCE V had a faster rate of strut coverage following 
stent implantation than Endeavor,
18 and was equivalent to BioFreedom.19  The rapid strut 
coverage by [CONTACT_196560] V was confirmed in humans in an optical coherence tomography (OCT) cohort of the MECHANISM -Elective study
20, which showed 93.6% strut 
coverage at 1 month and 98% strut coverage at [ADDRESS_233407] safety profile among the coronary stents, even when compared to BMS and biodegradable polymer DES. The benefit versus risk of 1 -month 
DAPT following XIENCE implantation in this population has not been prospectively evaluated . The XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study  will evaluate this important clinical question in a 
carefully controlled study setting. The results of the trial could potentially provide a definitive answer for the physicians as to the treatment of HBR patients with a safe and effective DES 
option.

eligibility criteria. Non-target lesion (i.e., lesions that do not meet the angiographic criteria 
listed above) treatments are not allowed during the index pr ocedure.  
5.[ADDRESS_233423] registration will occur after completion of successful index procedure (see 
“Angiographic Inclusion Criteria” above for definition of successful treatment of target lesion)  but prior to discharge and up to [ADDRESS_233424] index procedure, upon confirmation of the 
following:  
• Signed informed consent has been obtained ;  
• Subject has met all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria (including both 
general and angiographic criteria). 
5.[ADDRESS_233425] shall remain in the trial until completion of the required follow -up 
period; however, a subject’s participation in any clinical trial is voluntary and the subject has 
the right to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefit.  Conceivable reasons for 
discontinuation may include, but not be limited to, the following: 
• Subject death  
• Subject voluntary withdrawal  
• Subject withdrawal by [CONTACT_26139] -indicated  
• Subject lost -to follow-up as described below  
• Subject’s follow -up is terminated according to S ection 3.[ADDRESS_233426] be notified of the reason(s) for subject discontinuation. The site will record 
this information on the eCRF and source documents and provide this information to the Sponsor. Investigators must also report this to their respective IRB as defined by [CONTACT_9999]’s procedure(s).  
No additional follow–up will be required or data recorded from subjects once withdrawn from the trial, except for the status (deceased/alive).  
However, if a subject withdraws from the trial due to problems related to the device safety or performance, the investigator shall ask for the subject's permission to follow his/her status/condition outside of the clinical trial. 
Lost -to-Follow -up:   
If the subject misses two consecutive scheduled follow up time points and the attempts at 
contact[CONTACT_150744], then the subject is considered lost -to 
follow- up. Site personnel shall make all reasonable efforts to locate and communicate with 
the subject (and document these efforts in the source documents), including the following, at each contact [CONTACT_7206]:

• If these attempts are unsuccessful, a letter (certified if applicable) should be sent to the subject. 
• If a subject misses one or more non -consecutive follow -up contact [CONTACT_196565] a missed visit. The subject may  then return for subsequent visits. If the subject 
misses two consecutive time points and the above -mentioned attempts at communicating 
with the subject are unsuccessful, the subject will be considered lost -to-follow-up.  
Note : Telephone contact [CONTACT_196566], non- trial cardiologist or relative without 
presence of subject or indirect documentation obtained via discharge letters will not be considered as subject contact . 
Missed Visits:  
• If a subject misses one or more non -consecutive follow -up contact [CONTACT_150746], the visit 
will be considered a missed visit and subject is not lost -to-follow -up.   
• If subject responds via written communication (including email correspondence), providing the  protocol required data, these data will be collected in the case report form 
and the visit will not be considered a missed visit.   
5.[ADDRESS_233428]’s Participation  
The expected duration of each subject’s participation in this clinical trial is approximately [ADDRESS_233429] be completed when: 
• the subject is considered lost to follow-up per the above definition or  
• the subject withdraws from the c linical t rial or

6.0 TREATMENT AND EVALUATION  
6.1 Baseline and Pre -procedure  
6.1.1 Laboratory Assessments  
Baseline 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and l aboratory assessments (such as blood counts, 
chemistry panel and lipid panel, cardiac enzymes, etc)  should be obtained per site’s standard  
of care. Baseline laboratory results related to inclusion/exclusion criteria should be available 
and reviewed prior to the index procedure for screening. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_233431] demographics (age, gender, race), height, weight, family history of coronary artery 
disease (CAD) , smoking status, cardiac history  (myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and previous PCI /CABG information) , subject’s current 
cardiac status ( presentation of CAD and multivessel disease)  and indication of high bleeding 
risk (per criteria specified in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) will be obtained and recorded in electronic case 
report form (eCRF).   6.1.[ADDRESS_233432] receive a loading dose of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251]/or a P2Y12 inhibitor (Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], 
Prasugrel or Ticagrelor). The dosages of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251] P2Y12 inhibitor shall be determined by [CONTACT_196567]. The choice of P2Y12 inhibitor is per site standard of care, but clopi[INVESTIGATOR_196510].  The loading of P2Y12 inhibitor can be omitted only if the subject is on chronic usage (≥ 7 days). Subjects that are not on chronic usage must be loaded with P2Y12 inhibitor. It is recommended that the subject be loaded with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], even if the subject is on chronic usage of asp irin (≥ 7 days).  
The details of the antiplatelet loading dose, including type of drug, dosage, date and time, will be recorded in eCRF. In addition, whether the subject is taking oral anticoagulants will also be collected.  
6.2 Index Procedure 
Only XIENCE s tent can be used for target lesion(s).  Stent implantation procedure should be 
performed according to the instruction for use (IFU) of the XIENCE family stent used . If 
XIENCE stent is delivered beyond the guide catheter but not implanted, the subject cann ot be 
registered  in the trial. If other DES was implanted, the subject can not be registered in the 
trial.  
In this trial, a  maximum of three  target lesions may  be treated  with a maximum of two target 
lesions per epi[INVESTIGATOR_196518] . Non -target lesion  (i.e., lesions that do not meet the angiographic 
eligibility criteria) treatments are not allowed during the index procedure.  
Subjects may  receive appropriate anticoagulation and other therapy according to standard 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13707].

received overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_196530]. According to XIENCE IFU, the 
maximal lesion length that may be treated is 32mm for a single XIENCE stent.  
Bifurcation lesions  are allowed in this trial. However, subjects treated with double stenting of 
both the main vessel and the side branch  cannot be registered in this trial.  
Planned staged procedures are not allowed.  
Lesion characteristic s (lesion location, % diameter stenosis, TIMI flow, RVD, lesion length, 
thrombus presence, bifurcation or not, lesion complexity), device (device name, size, number of device implanted, bailout usage, overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_196523]) and procedural information (procedure time, access site, procedural anticoagulant and anti -thrombotic medications, any procedure 
complications)  will be collected  and recorded in eCRF .  
6.[ADDRESS_233433]–procedure  
6.3.[ADDRESS_233434]-procedure ECG and cardiac enzymes are not mandatory in the trial, and shall be 
performed per site’s standard care.   
6.3.2 Antiplatelet Medications during Follow- up  
• All subjects must receive ≥75 to ≤[ADDRESS_233435] maintain a minimum of 75 mg of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_196511] 5 or 10 mg of 
prasugrel daily ([ADDRESS_233436] subjects*) or 90 mg twice daily of ticagrelor for 
1 month (as short as 28 days) following the procedure.  
− The choice of P2Y12 inhibitor is per site standard of care, but clopi[INVESTIGATOR_196531]. 
− For subjects taking chronic anticoagulants, dual therapy (oral anticoagulant and a 
P2Y12 inhibitor, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_196517]) may be considered within the first month post 
index procedure per investigator’s discretion.  
• At 1-month follow up, subject will be assessed for their eligibility of P2Y12 inhibitor 
discontinuation. Eligible subjects will discontinue P2Y12 inhibitor as early as 28 days  
and receive ≥75 to ≤100 mg of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_196514] 1- year follow -up during the trial if 
they are “1 -month clear”, defined as subjects who are free from myocardial infarction 
(modified ARC), repeat coronary revascularization, stroke, or stent thrombosis (ARC 
definite/probable) within 1 month ( prior to [ADDRESS_233437]  28 days ) after 
stenting AND have been compliant with 1-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) without interruption of either aspi[INVESTIGATOR_196532]/or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for > [ADDRESS_233438] month (anticoagulant and a P2Y12 inhibitor) will discontinue the P2Y12 inhibitor after 1 month if they are assessed 
as “1 -month clear”. These subjects will start aspi[INVESTIGATOR_196533].  
If a subject was event -free and DAPT compliant (as defined above) during the first 
month, but does not stop P2Y12 inhibitor after the 1-month visit, due to physician’s or subject’s decision, this subject will be considered as “1 -month not clear”.  If the physician

XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study #ABT -CIP-[ADDRESS_233439] 
to provide consent prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_196516] 3 days after the index procedure, 
only if the site confirms that the protocol required DAPT regimen is site’s standard of 
care.  
− Peri-procedural MI (occurred within [ADDRESS_233440] index procedure) without any 
clinical symptoms will not be considered exclusionary event for the definition of “1-
month clear”.  
− Dual therapy (oral anticoagulant and a P2Y12 inhibitor, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_196517]) within 
the first month post index procedure for subjects who are on chronic anticoagulants is 
acceptable for the definition of “1-month clear”. 
• Subjects who are not “1 -month clear” are NOT eligible for P2Y12 inhibitor 
discontinuation at 1 -month . These subjects will be treated per the investigator's discretion 
and will continue to be followed up through 12 months. 
*For prasugrel subjects < 60 kg in weight or ≥ 75 years of age, a maintenance dose of 5 mg 
per day is allowed .   
The use of the above antiplatelet medications, including the start and stop date, any changes, as well as the reason to stop, will be documented in the eCRF. 
6.3.3 Other Chronic Concomitant Medications  
Administration of concomitant medications other than any approved P2Y12 inhibitors and 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_196534]. Subjects may receive other medications as needed per physician’s discretion.  
6.4 Clinical Follow -up for All Subjects  
Subjects registered in the trial will receive the following clinical follow -up: 
• 1 month (28-35 days): office visit  (Note: a formal office visit is required at 1-month 
follow-up to ensure a thorough clinical evaluation. A telephone contact [CONTACT_196568]-up due to being unable to 
complete an office visit , but a formal follow- up visit is still preferred at 1-month.) 
• 3 months (90 ±  7 days): office visit/telephone contact  (office visit is strongly 
recommended whenever possible) 
• 6 months (180 ±  14 days): office visit/telephone contact  (office visit is strongly 
recommended whenever possible) 
• 12 months (365 ±  28 days): office visit/telephone contact (office visit is strongly 
recommended whenever possible)  
Clinical follow -up visits should be conducted by [CONTACT_196569]. At 1-month follow-up visit, the investigator or designee will 
Abbott Vascular  Version A  
XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study #ABT -CIP-[ADDRESS_233441] is “1-month clear” and eligible for P2Y12 inhibitor discontinuation 
per criteria defined in Section 6.3.2.  
All registered subjects will be followed up through 12 months, regardless of eligibility to 
discontinue P2Y12 inhibitor.  
The following information will be collected at each of the time points: 
• Any adverse events  
• Use and compliance of protocol required antiplatelet medication  
• Details of any subsequent coronary interventions (e.g., repeat PCI or CABG). 
Note that information obtained through i ndirect contacts with a subject’s healthcare provider 
or immediate family member will NOT  be considered as a trial visit . 
6.[ADDRESS_233442] visits, such as unscheduled visits, may occur as clinically warranted. The following information will be collected  and recorded in eCRF :  
• Any adverse events  
• Use and compliance of protocol required antiplatelet medication  
• Details of any subsequent coronary interventions (e.g., repeat PCI or CABG). 
If an unscheduled visi t is conducted due to a suspected ischemic cardiac event, cardiac 
enzymes and ECG may be performed per site’s standard care .  
All efforts must be made to obtain follow -up information on subjects who have undergone 
procedures or have been treated for advers e events in a non -trial-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307](s).  
7.[ADDRESS_233443] definitions and reporting timelines to be used and adhered to by [CONTACT_473]. 
7.1 Definition  
7.1.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or 
untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other 
persons, whether or not related to the medical device.  
Note 1 : This definition includes events related to the medical device or the comparator. 
Note 2 : This definition includes events related to the procedures involved. 
Note 3 : For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to medical 
devices.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.

XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study Protocol Version A  December 4, 2018 7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
If the AE meets any of the criteria below, it is regarded as a serious adverse event (SAE).  
a) Led to a death,  
b) Led to a serious deterioration in health that either:  
1) Resulted in a life- threatening illness or injury, or 
2) Resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or 3) Required in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or 4) Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function. 
5) Resulted in c hronic disease  
c) Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth d efect.  
d) An important medical event that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49200], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject and/or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Note 1 : This includes device deficiencies that might have led to a serious adverse event if a) 
suitable action had not been taken or b) intervention had not been made or c) if circumstances had been less fortunate. These are handled under the SAE reporting system. 
Note 2 : A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912]-existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_196570], without a serious deterioration in health, is not considered to be a serious 
adverse event.  
7.1.3 Device Deficiency/Device Malfunction  
Device deficiency (DD) is defined as an inadequacy of a medical device related to its 
identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance, such as malfunction, misuse or use error and inadequate labeling. This includes the failure of the device to meet it s 
performance specifications or otherwise perform as intended. Note : Performance 
specifications include all claims made in the labeling of the device.  
A device malfunction (DM) is the failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or otherwise perform as intended, when used in accordance with the instructions for use or the trial protocol. 
7.[ADDRESS_233444] or device caused or 
contributed to an AE is to be determined  by [CONTACT_196571]. For clinical endpoint events that are sent to the CEC for adjudication, 
event relatedness to the study device will also be adjudicated by [CONTACT_15741]. The CEC members will be trained on the criter ia used for determination of device relationship . Determination 
should be based on assessment of temporal relationships, evidence of alternative etiology, and medical/biologic plausibility .

Unanticipated (serious) adverse device effect [U(S) ADE ] refers to any serious adverse effect 
on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the study plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
7.[ADDRESS_233445]’s vasculature. All AEs will be collected through 6 -month follow-up visit.  After 6 months, only 
the fol lowing will be collected in those subjects:  
• All serious AEs 
• All cardiovascular events regardless of seriousness or device relationship  
• All trial device -related events and events for which the relationship to the trial device is 
unknown  
• All Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA)  and bleeding complications 
Unchanged, chronic, non- worsening or pre -existing conditions are not AEs and should not be 
recorded on the AE eCRF page.  
Non-cardiac related abnormal laboratory values will not be considered AEs unless:  
1) the investigator determined that the value is clinically significant,  
2) the abnormal lab value required intervention, or  3) the abnormal lab value required subject termination from the trial. The Investigator will monitor the occurrence of AEs  for each subject during the course of the 
clinical trial and report as required by [CONTACT_196572] S ection [ADDRESS_233446]’s 
vasculature on the appropriate AE eCRF form. Additional information with regards to an 
adverse event should be updated within the appropriate case report form.  A fax form ( TPT2117940) will be made available to allow the investigator to report SAEs in 
the event the entry cannot be made in the EDC. This does not replace the EDC reporting 
system. All information must still be entered in the EDC system as soon as feasible.  
The investigator should report all SAEs to the Sponsor as soon as possible but no later than outlined below.  
Trial  site Reporting timelines  
All Trial Sites  SAEs must be reported no later than 3 calendar days from the day the trial personnel became aware of the event or as per the trial site’s local

documented in CEC Manual of Operations (MOPs).  
9.0 STATISTICAL ANALYS ES  
9.1 Statistical Overview  
The XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study is powered based on primary endpoint of all death or all 
myocardial infarction  [modified ARC] (Death/MI) from  1- to 6-month follow-up.  
Primary endpoint analysis for 1- month DAPT  
The primary endpoint of Death/MI between  1-month and 6-month follow-up will be 
evaluated  based on the “1-month clear” population (as defined in section 9.2) pooled from the 
XIENCE [ADDRESS_233450] is designed for  
non-inferiority of 1-month DAPT arm compared to XIENCE V [LOCATION_003] historical control for the 
primary endpoint with one-sided alpha of 0.025 after propensity score stratification . The null 
(H0) and alternative (H A) hypothesis are of the following form: 
                        H 0: Death/MI 1m-DAPT  -  Death/MI Xience V [LOCATION_003]   ≥ δ 
HA: Death/MI 1m-DAPT  -   Death/MI Xience V [LOCATION_003]  < δ 
A stratified statistical  method through propensity score will be performed to test non-
inferiority (NI) of 1-month DAPT to X IENCE  V [LOCATION_003] historical control.  
The trial success is defined as passing the non-inferiority test on the primary endpoint of 
Death/MI for the “1-month clear” population.  
9.2 Analysis Populations  
The primary analysis population includes “1-month clear” population, defined as subjects 
who are free from myocardial infarction (modified ARC), repeat coronary revascularization, stroke, or stent thrombos is (ARC definite/probable) within 1 month ( prior to [ADDRESS_233451]  28 days ) after stenting AND have been compliant with 1-month dual antiplatelet 
therapy (DAPT) without interruption of either aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251]/or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for > [ADDRESS_233452] was event -free and DAPT compliant (as defined above) during the first month, 
but does not stop P2Y12 inhibitor after the 1-month visit, due to physician’s or subject’s decision, this subject will be considered as “1-month not clear”.

Upon receiving IDE approval from the FDA, this clinical trial will be registered on Clinica lTrials.gov. A full report of the pre-specified outcomes, including any negative 
outcomes, will be made public through the ClinicalTrials.gov website no later than 12-months after clinical trial completion, as required by [CONTACT_68979] [ADDRESS_233468] to HBR patients  which represent approximately 15% or 
more of patients undergoing PCI. The  default management of care for HBR patients who 
undergo PCI is often stenting with BMS followed by 1 month of DAPT. The updated 2016 ACC/AHA guideline also provided a class IIb recommendation of 3- month DAPT in SIHD 
patients with high risk of bleeding following DES implantation
22. The most recent 2017 ESC 
guideline recommended 3-mont h DAPT (Class IIa) in high bleeding risk patients with stable 
CAD and 1 -month DAPT (Class IIb) for those patients in whom [ADDRESS_233469] safety profile among the coronary stents, ev en when compared to BMS. However, the benefit/risk ratio of a shorter duration of 
DAPT following XIENCE implantation in th e HBR  population has not been thoroughly 
evaluated. There is clearly an unmet medical need to be addressed  for the HBR patient 
population as the possible benefits of extended DAPT therapy to prevent late stent thrombosis and the progression of atherosclerotic disease need to be weighed against the increased risk of bleeding in an individual patient. Therefore, the XIENCE [ADDRESS_233470] udy is 
designed to prospectively evaluate the safety of XIENCE followed with  1-month (as short as 
28 days) DAPT in  HBR patients .

month DAPT may decrease the risk of bleeding in HBR subjects. Participation of this trial contributes to defining the optimum duration of DAPT in HBR subjects treated w ith 
XIENCE . 
15.2 Foreseeable Adverse Events and Anticipated Adverse Device Effects  
Observed and potential adverse events occurring with the XIENCE family of stents are listed in the IFU s. The incidence of these adverse events is comparable to other PCI devices. There 
may be risks related to the device that are unknown at present. 
Please refer to the drug labelling (most recent ve rsions available at at www.fda.gov
 – drugs - 
drugs@fda), and published guidelines on PCI and DAPT use for information on bleeding and 
other risks associated with DAPT use.  
One-month DAPT may decrease the risk of bleeding in HBR subjects , but may increase the 
risk of late stent thrombosis and progression of atherosclerotic disease.  
15.3 Residual Risks Associated with the Device, as Identified in the Risk  Analysis 
Report  
The XI ENCE Risk Assessment Report24 utilizes the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis 
(FMEA) tool to systematically identify potential hazards associated with the process, design, 
components, and use of the XI ENCE product family. Based upon preclinical, clinical, bench 
data, and commercial post -production data, all residual risks are appropriate and acceptable. 
The benefit of treatment from the XI ENCE outweighs the potential risks to the patient. 
Comprehensive analysis of product level clinical data, including clinical trial, post-marketing, and literature data, confirms that any undesirable risks identified are outweighed by [CONTACT_196587]
[ADDRESS_233471] received 
appropriate training on how to use the device. This statement is interpreted to mean that the physician users are expected to be aware of the known and foreseeable safety risks associated with the use of the devices including the surgical and/or non- surgical treatment of these 
conditions.

 Vascular death:  
Deat h due to non- coronary vascular causes such as cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary 
embolism, ruptured aortic aneurysm, dissecting aneurysm, or other vascular cause.    
Non-cardiovascular death:  
Any death not covered by [CONTACT_196590], malignancy, 
sepsis, pulmonary causes, accident, suicide or trauma.

• Based on Q -Wave 
o Q-wave MI [QMI]  
 Development of new pathological Q waves in [ADDRESS_233475] MI [NQMI]  
 All MIs not classified as Q waves.  
 
• Relation to the Target Vessel  
All infarcts that cannot be clearly attributed to a vessel other than the target vessel will be considered related to the target vessel.  
 WHO MI Definition  
 Myocardial infarctions will also be adjudicated based on the following definition:  
 Q wave MI : Development of new, pathological Q wave on the ECG  
 
 Non-Q wave MI: Elevation of CK levels to ≥  two times the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
with elevated CK -MB in the absence of new pathological Q waves

Acute stent thrombosis*:   [ADDRESS_233476] stent implantation  Subacute stent thrombosis*:   >[ADDRESS_233477] stent implantation  Late stent thrombosis†:   [ADDRESS_233478] stent implantation  
Very late stent thrombosis†:   >[ADDRESS_233479] stent implantation  
 *  Acute/subacute can also be replaced by [CONTACT_196591]. Early stent thrombosis (0 - 30 days) - this definition is currently used in the community.  † Including “primary” as well as “secondary” late stent thrombosis; “secondary” late 
stent thrombosis  is a stent thrombosis after a target segment revascularization.  
 Categories ( Definite, Probable, and Possible) : 
 Definite stent thrombosis  
Definite stent thrombosis is considered to have occurred by [CONTACT_196592]. 
  Angiographic confirmation of stent thrombosis*  
The presence of a thrombus
† that originates in the stent or in the segment [ADDRESS_233480] 1 of the following criteria within a 48-hour time window :  
• Acute onset of ischemic symptoms at rest  
• New ischemic ECG changes that suggest acute ischemia

XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study Protocol Version A  December 4, 2018 • Typi[INVESTIGATOR_196543] (refer to definition of spontaneous MI)  
• Non-occlusive  thrombosis 
o Thrombus Intracoronary thrombus is defined as a (spheric, ovoid, or irregular) non -calcified filling defect or lucency surrounded by [CONTACT_196593] (on 3 sides or within a coronary stenosis) seen in multiple projections, or persistence of contrast material within the lumen, or a visible embolization of intraluminal material downstream.  
• Occlusive thrombus  
o TIMI [ADDRESS_233481] adjacent proximal side branch or main branch (if originates from the side branch).  
 Pathological confirmation of stent thrombosis   
Evidence of recent thrombus within the stent determined at autopsy or via examination of tissue retrieved following thrombectomy.  
 
    * The incidental angiographic documentation of stent occlusion in the absence 
of clinical signs or symptoms is not considered a confirmed stent thrombosis (silent occlusion).  
     † Intracoronary thrombus.  
Probable stent thrombosis  
Clinical definition of probable stent thrombosis is considered to have occurred after intracoronary stenting in the following cases: 
• Any unexplained death within the first 30 days
‡  
• Irrespective of the time after the index procedure, any MI that is related to 
documented acute ischemia in the territory of the implanted stent without 
angiographic confirmation of stent thrombosis and in the absence of any other obvious cause  
     ‡ For studies with ST -elevation MI population, one may consider the exclusion 
of unexplained death within [ADDRESS_233482] occurred with any unexplained death from 30 days after intracoronary stenting until end of trial follow-up.

XIENCE 28 [LOCATION_003] Study Protocol Version A  December 4, 2018 • Hemorrhagic Stroke: An acute symptomatic epi [INVESTIGATOR_196546] a non- traumatic intraparenchymal, intraventricular, or 
subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
• Undetermined Stroke: A stroke with insufficient information to allow categorization as ischemic or hemorrhagic.  
 
Note: an event that last < 24 hours may be adjudicated as a stroke if the following treatments were used:  
• Pharmacologic, i.e., thrombolytic drug administration, or 
Non-pharmacologic, i.e., neurointerventional procedure (e.g., intracranial angioplasty) 
 
 
BLEEDING ( Per BARC, Circulation 2011; 123: 2736-2747) 
Bleeding will also be adjudicated per Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC)  
definitions : 
• Type 0: no bleeding 
• Type 1: bleeding that is not actionable and does not cause the patient to seek 
unscheduled performance of studies, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or treatment by a healthcare 
professional; may include epi[INVESTIGATOR_15664]-discontinuation of medical therapy 
by [CONTACT_15743] a healthcare professional 
• Type 2: any overt, actionable sign of hemorrhage (eg, more bleeding than would be 
expected for a clinical circumstance, including bleeding found by [CONTACT_3868]) that 
does not fit the criteria for type 3, 4, or [ADDRESS_233483] one of the following 
criteria: (1) requiring nonsurgical, medical intervention by a healthcare professional, 
(2) leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3820], or (3) prompting evaluation 
• Type 3 
o Type 3a 
 Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop of 3 to < 5 g/dL* (provided 
hemoglobin drop is related to bleed) 
 Any transfusion with overt bleeding 
o Type 3b 
 Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop ≥  5 g/dL*(provided hemoglobin 
drop is related to bleed) 
 Cardiac tamponade  
 Bleeding requiring surgical intervention for control (excluding 
dental/nasal/skin/hemorrhoid) 
 Bleeding requiring intravenous va soactive agents 
o Type 3c 
 Intracranial hemorrhage (does not include microbleeds or hemorrhagic 
transformation, does include intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]) 
 Subcategories confirmed by [CONTACT_15745] 
 Intraocular bleed compromising vision

bleeding 
o Transfusion of ≥  5 U whole blood or packed red blood cells within a 48-h 
period† 
o Chest tube output ≥  2L within a 24-h period

o Type 5b 
 Definite fatal bleeding; overt bleeding or autopsy or imaging 
confirmation  
CABG indicates coronary artery by[CONTACT_9292]. Platelet transfusions should be recorded 
and reported but are not included in these definitions until further information is obtained 
about the relationship to outcomes. If a CABG- related bleed is not adjudicated as at least 
a type 3 severity event,  it will be classified as not a bleeding event. If a bleeding event 
occurs with a clear temporal relationship to CABG (ie, within a 48 -h time frame) but does 
not meet type 4 severity criteria, it will be classified as not a bleeding event.  
* Corrected for transfusion (1 U packed red blood cells or 1 U whole blood=1 g/dL 
hemoglobin).

  REVASCULARIZATION (Per ARC Circulation 2007; 115: 2344 -2351) 
 Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR)  TLR is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention of the target lesion or by[CONTACT_196595]. All TLR should be classified prospectively as clinically indicated [CI] or not clinically indicated by [CONTACT_196596]. The target lesion is defined as the treated segment from 5 mm proximal to the stent and to 5 mm distal to the stent. 
Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR)  
TVR is defined as any repeat percutaneous interventio n or surgical by[CONTACT_196597]. The target vessel is defined as the entire major coronary vessel proximal and 
distal to the target lesion  which includes upstream and downstream branches and the target 
lesion itself  
Non Target Les ion Revascularization (Non- TLR)  
Any revascularization in the target vessel for a lesion other than the target lesion is considered a non- TLR.  
Non Target Vessel Revascularization (Non -TVR)  
Revascularization of the vessel identified and treated as the non -target vessel at the time of 
the index procedure.

A revascularization is considered clinically indicated if angiography at follow -up shows a 
percent diameter stenosis ≥ 50% and if one of the following occurs:  
• A positive history of recurrent angina pectoris, presumably related to the target vessel;  
• Objective signs of ischemia at rest (ECG changes) or during exercise test (or equivalent), presumably related to the target vessel;  
• Abnormal results of any invasive functional diagnostic test (e.g., Doppler flow velocity reserve, fractional flow reserve);  
• A TLR/TVR with a diameter stenosis ≥70% in the absence of the above mentioned 
ischemic signs or symptoms.

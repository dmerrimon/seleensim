RANDOMIZED PHASE  II TRIAL OF SIPULEUCEL T IMMUNOTHERAPY PRECEDED BY 
[CONTACT_511311] -T ALONE IN PATIENTS WITH 
CASTRATE RESISTANT METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER  
Brief Protocol Title for the Lay Public (if applicable):  
Sipuleucel -T preceded by [CONTACT_511312]:  
Phase II  
Participating Sites:  
City of Hope Cancer Center  
City of Hope South Pasadena  
Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah  
Rationale for this Study:  
The combination of radiation therapy and immunotherapy holds promise as a strategy for cancer 
treatment. Preclinical studies have shown that radiation may act synergistically with immunotherapy 
to enhance or broaden antitumor immune responses, in p art, because of radiation -induced phenotypic 
alterations of tumor cells that render them more susceptible to immune -mediated killing(1). Clinical 
trials utilizing the combination of therapeutic vaccines with radiation have supported many of these 
findings,  and other clinical trials are both ongoing and planned. Sipuleucel -T is an active cellular 
immunotherapy approved for treatment of patients with castrate - resistant, asymptomatic or 
minimally symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer (2). Our proposal is ba sed on the hypothesis that 
applying sensitizing radiotherapy to selected metastatic site prior to immunotherapy will enhance 
immune response in patients treated with Sipuleucel -T. 
Objectives:  
Primary Objective : 
To assess the feasibility, based on percent  able or willing to receive all three infusions  of 
Sipuleucel -T immunotherapy, when  combining Sipuleucel -T with radiation therapy to a single  
site of  metastasis delivered one week prior to beginning of Sipuleucel -T therapy  
Secondary Objectives:  
1.      To assess the effect of radiation therapy to single metastasis on immune response (antibody 
and T -cell proliferation to prostate acid phosphatase PAP and fusion protein PA2024) 
generated by [CONTACT_511313] -T immunotherapy.  
2.      To assess the effect of external  beam radiotherapy to single metastasis on PSA response to 
therapy with Sipuleucel -T.  
3.      To assess the effect of external beam radiation therapy to single metastasis on radiographic 
response rate to therapy with Sipuleucel -T.   
4.      To asses s the time from the onset of therapy with Sipuleucel -T +/- radiation to the need for 
subsequent therapy for prostate cancer.    
5.      To assess the toxicity associated with Sipuleucel -T +radiation.

Study Design:  
Eligible patients will meet the st andard criteria for approved use of Sipuleucel -T. Patients will be 
randomized to receive standard Sipuleucel -T regimen (Arm A) or Sipuleucel -T preceded by [CONTACT_511314] (Arm B). In patients assigned to Arm B one me tastatic site 
will be selected for radiation based primarily on the safety of radiation in that location. Radiation to 
bone metastases from L3 down to pelvis and femurs will be excluded provided that patients have 
other areas of metastases. Patients who ha ve metastases only in the above locations (L3 down to 
pelvis and femurs) will be allowed provided that they have normal WBC and they will not receive 
radiation to more than 20% of the bone marrow.  Patients will be treated with 300 cGy/day to  3000 
cGy.  Approximately 7 days after completion of radiation therapy patients will begin therapy with 
Sipuleucel -T autologous vaccine.  
 
Endpoints:  
Primary Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint in this trial will be percent of patients able to receive all three infusions of  
Sipuleucel -T following radiation therapy . This endpoint reflects both tolerability and the ability to 
collect adequate numbers of CD54+ cells for the generation of Sipuleucel -T.  
Secondary Endpoint:  
Secondary endpoints will include measurements of immune  responses to PAP, PA2024 and PSA 
and radiologic responses to therapy with Sipuleucel -T +/- external beam radiation therapy to single 
metastasis.     Toxicity comparison between the two arms is also a secondary endpoint.  
 
 
Sample Size:  
Total Sample size  is 50 randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_661321] Eligibility Criteria:  
Inclusion Criteria:  
Patients with metastatic castration -resistant p rostate cancer who are candida tes for Sipuleucel -T 
immunotherapy . Metastatic, minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic disease, ECOG PS 0 -2 
Exclusion Criteria:  
Liver metastases, known brain metastases, > 2 prior chemotherapy regimens

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]   Version Date:  10/24/2017 Version:  [ADDRESS_661322] Dosage and Administration:  
Not Applicable. Radiation therapy constitutes investigational component of this study  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical Observations and Tests to be Performed:  
Evaluation for toxicity will be performed at week 4, 6, 8, 12 and every 12 weeks  thereafter. PSA will 
be performed at week  4 and 12, radiologic evaluation will be performed at week 12, and immune 
assays will be performed at week 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60  
 
Statistical Considerations:  
This is a randomized Phase II study .  The primary end point in this trial will be the ability to safely 
combine Sipuleucel -T with radiation therapy and collect adequate numbers of CD54+ cells for the 
generation of Sipuleucel -T.  This is measured by [CONTACT_511315] o f Sipuleucel -T. Secondary endpoints will include  toxicity, and  measurements of immune 
responses to PAP, PA2024 and PSA and radiologic responses to therapy with Sipuleucel -T +/- 
external beam radiation therapy to single metastasis.

2.0 Background 
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development 
Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-
related death in men in the [LOCATION_002]1.  Androgen deprivation therapy is effective in the initial 
management of advanced prostate cancer but eventually cancer evolves into the aggressive phenotype 
referred to as castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) which is usually fatal within 12-22 months2.  
Sipuleucel-T is an active cellular immunotherapy consisting of autologous, peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMC’s), including antigen presenting cells (APC’s) that have been activated in vivo with a 
recombinant fusion protein (PA2024).  PA2024 consists of a prostate antigen, prostatic acid phosphatase 
(PAP) that is fused to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), an immune cell 
activator3.  
Sipuleucel-T was evaluated in a randomized placebo-controlled Phase III trial in patients with 
asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic CRPC and demonstrated statistically significant survival 
advantage of 4.[ADDRESS_661326] PA2024 that exceeded 400 at any time after baseline were 
observed in 66.2 % of patients in the Sipuleucel-T and 2.9% in the placebo group. Patients with positive 
antibody titer against PA2024 had improved survival as compared to patients who did not generate such 
response. Antibodies against PAP were observed in 28.5% of patients treated with Sipuleucel-T and 1.4 
% in patients in a placebo group. At week 6 , T-cell proliferation responses (stimulation index>5) to 
PA2024 were seen in 73% of patients in the Sipuleucel-T group and 12.1% in the placebo arm. Responses 
to PAP were observed in 27.3 % in the Sipuleucel-T group and 8.0% in the placebo group. Based on the 
results of this trial Sipuleucel-T was approved by [CONTACT_511316].  
The combination of radiation therapy and immunotherapy holds promise as a strategy for cancer 
treatment. Preclinical studies have shown that radiation may act synergistically with immunotherapy to 
Page 12 of 50 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]   Version Date:  10/24/2017 Version:  [ADDRESS_661327] of immunotherapy and radiation in murine model utilizing anti-
CEA antibody ([CONTACT_511341]-personnel communication.)  Clinical trials utilizing the combination of 
therapeutic vaccines with radiation have supported many of these findings, and other clinical trials are 
both ongoing and planned. Our proposal is based on the hypothesis that applying sensitizing radiotherapy 
t
o selected metastatic site prior to immunotherapy will enhance immune response in patients treated with 
Sipuleucel- T.   
2.2
 Overview of Proposed Study 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the 
applicable regulatory requirements. Sipuleucel-T (APC8015, Provenge ®) is an autologous cell product 
consisting of antigen presenting cells (APCs) loaded with prostate antigen PA2024, a recombinant 
fusion protein composed of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) linked to granulocyte-macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF acts as a targeting molecule that directs the PAP 
antigen to APCs and promotes antigen uptake and processing. A dose of sipuleucel-T is prepared 
from cells from a single leukapheresis procedure, with a minimum of 20 million CD54 + cells (the 
biologically active component of sipuleucel-T), which is administered via a single intravenous 
infusion at Weeks 0, 2, and 4. Sipuleucel-T has been approved based on the demonstration of 4.[ADDRESS_661328] Sipuleucel-T regimen (Arm A) or Sipuleucel-T preceded by [CONTACT_511314] (Arm B). In patients assigned to Arm B, one metastatic site 
w
ill be selected for radiation based primarily on the safety of radiation in that location. Radiation to bone 
metastases from L3 down to pelvis and femurs will be excluded provided that patients have other areas of 
metastases.  Patients who have metastases only in the above locations (L3 down to pelvis and femurs) 
will be allowed provided that they have normal WBC and they will not receive radiation to more than 
20% of the bone marrow.  Patients will be treated with following fractionation schemes: 1) 300 cGy/day 
to 3000 cGy. Approximately 7 days after completion of radiation therapy, patients will begin therapy with 
Sipul
eucel-T autologous vaccine. 
2.3 Preclinical Studies 
Sipuleucel-T-Pre-clinical studies in rats demonstrated that APCs loaded with a fusion protein consisting 
of rat prostatic acid phosphatase (rPAP) coupled to a targeting molecule, rat granulocyte-macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF), induced strong cellular immune responses in vivo to tissues and 
tumors that express PAP (Laus 2001). Based on these observations, an APC product, designated 
APC8015 (sipuleucel-T), was developed for the treatment of men with prostate cancer 
2.4 Human Studies 
Sipuleucel- T Separate Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials of sipuleucel-T were performed at the University of 
[LOCATION_004], San Francisco (UCSF) (Small 2000) and the Mayo Clinic (Burch 2000, Burch 2004). Data 
from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials demonstrated that intravenous infusions of sipuleucel-T were 
generally well tolerated and effectively stimulated T cell responses to the immunogen. In addition, 
following therapy with sipuleucel-T, several subjects had decreases in PSA levels or objective tumor 
regressions suggesting anti-tumor activity. A dose of 3 million CD54+ cells was adequate to generate an 
immune response. There were no apparent dose related or dose limiting toxicities, warranting the 
conclusion that the maximum cell dose that could be manufactured from a single leukapheresis product 
was safe. PR-0292.08, 03 JAN 2008 Page 14 of 55 Dendreon Corporation Sipuleucel-T (APC8015)

A
 randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial (D9901, n = 127 subjects) was subsequently conducted. 
A statistically significant survival benefit was demonstrated, with the relative risk of death 70% greater 
for subjects randomized to placebo ( P = 0.010, 2-sided log rank; HR = 1.71). The median survival was 
25.9 months for subjects randomized to sipuleucel-T compared to 21.4 months for those randomized to 
placebo. At 36 months from randomization, the survival rate for subjects receiving sipuleucel-T was 3.1 
times higher than the survival rate for subjects receiving placebo (34% vs. 11%; P = 0.0046, chi square) 
(Small 2006). In addition, when the Kaplan-Meier curves for time to disease progression were compared, 
there was a delay in the time from randomization to disease progression in the sipuleucel-T group 
compared with the placebo group (HR = 1.45 [95% CI: 0.99, 2.11], P = 0.052). A second smaller, 
randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial (D9902A, n = 98 subjects) with the same design as D9901 
demonstrated a 20% improvement in median survival for subjects who were randomized to receive 
sipuleucel-T compared to placebo. Furthermore, at the 3-year follow-up, the percentage of subjects alive 
in the sipuleucel-T treated group was substantially greater than the percentage of subjects alive who 
received placebo. The results from this study did not reach statistical significance based on the log rank 
test. A secondary analysis using a Cox multivariable regression analysis of overall survival, which 
adjusted for prognostic factors known to influence survival, met the criteria for statistical significance. 
The HR observed in this Cox multivariable regression analysis was similar to that seen using the same 
analysis in D9901. The overall AE profile observed in Phase 3 studies (D9901 and D9902A) was similar 
to that observed in the Phase 2 studies, although infusion-related fevers and rigors appeared to be more 
common. The following infusion-related AEs occurred more frequently ( P ≤ 0.05) in subjects treated with 
sipuleucel-T than those treated with placebo: chills, pyrexia, headache, asthenia, dyspnea, vomiting, and 
tremor. However, these events generally resolved within 1 to 2 days. 
Sipuleucel-T was subsequently evaluated in a randomized placebo-controlled Phase III trial in patients 
with asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic CRPC (IMPACT Trial) and demonstrated statistically 
significant survival advantage of 4.[ADDRESS_661329] PA2024 that exceeded 400 at any time 
after baseline were observed in 66.2 % of patients in the Sipuleucel-T and 2.9% in the placebo group. 
Patients with positive antibody titer against PA2024 had improved survival as compared to patients who 
did not generate such response. Antibodies against PAP were observed in 28.5% of patients treated with 
Sipuleucel-T and 1.4 % in patients in a placebo group. At week 6, T-cell proliferation responses 
(stimulation index>5) to PA2024 were seen in 73% of patients in the Sipuleucel-T group and 12.1% in 
the placebo arm. Responses to PAP were observed in 27.3 % in the Sipuleucel-T group and 8.0% in the 
placebo group. Based on the results of this trial Sipuleucel-T was approved by [CONTACT_511317]. 
2.5 STAT3-Activity 
STAT3 activity in tumor-associate myeloid cells is known to orchestrate tumor angiogenesis (Kujawski 
JCI 2008). Our recent studies assessed whether STAT3 activity in the tumor microenvironment can limit 
the antitumor effect of the local tumor irradiation. We observed that tumor irradiation can enhance, rather 
than interrupt, STAT3-mediated crosstalk between cancer and myeloid immune cells. The radiation-
induced cell death led to release of endogenous TLR agonists for TLR9, including mitochondrial DNA 
(mtDNA), which in turn sustain high STAT3 activity in myeloid cells. We demonstrated that STAT3 
activation post-irradiation is mostly TLR9-mediated and depends on rapid expression of cytokines 
inducing Jak/STAT3 signaling, such as IL-6. Cancer cell repopulation was significantly delayed in TLR9-
deficient mice compared to wild-type animals, which correlated with reduced STAT3 activation in tumor-
infiltrating myeloid cells and impaired reconstitution of tumor blood vessels. In addition, lack of TLR9 
Page 14 of 50 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]   Version Date:  10/24/2017 Version:  09   expr
ession correlated also with decreased numbers of lung metastases suggesting the role of TLR9 
signaling in tumor dissemination. We further verified the negative role of STAT3 for the efficacy of 
radiation therapy using conditional STAT3 gene deletion in myeloid cells as well as STAT3 silencing 
using CpG-STAT3siRNA. Both approaches confirmed that elimination of tumorigenic TLR9/STAT3 
signaling axis in tumor-associated myeloid cells prevents cancer recurrence following the local tumor 
irradiation. Targeting STAT3 using immune cell-specific CpG-siRNA strategy is likely to provide a 
future therapeutic approach to support cancer radiotherapy. In this study we will perform the exploratory 
analysis of the effect of radiation therapy on the levels of pSTAT3 in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells 
(PBMCs) and serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines and TLR9 ligands.

dverse event (AE)  - An adverse event is any untoward medical experience or change of an existing 
condi
tion that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not it is considered to be related to the protocol 
intervention.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event [21 CFR 312.32 (a)  – An adverse event is unexpected if it is not listed in the 
i
nvestigator’s brochure and/or package insert; is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed; is not consistent with the risk information described in the protocol and/or consent; is not an 
expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of 
the research participant experiencing the adverse event. 
 
Expected Adverse Event  - Any event that does not meet the criteria for an unexpected event OR is an 
expe
cted natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of 
the research participant experiencing the adverse event. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) [21 CFR 312.32]  is defined as any expected or unexpected adverse event 
that results in any of the following outcomes: 
 De ath 
 I s life-threatening experience (places the subject at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred) 
 Unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ( equal to or greater than 24 hours) or prolongation of 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 A pe rsistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 A c ongenital anomaly/birth defect 
 S econdary Malignancy 
 Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above (examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or 
at home, blood dyscrasisas of convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
 
Unanticipated problem (UP) – Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all three of the 
following criteria: 
1. Unexpected (in term nature, severity, or frequency) given the following: a) the 
research procedures described in the protocol-related documents such as the IRB 
approved research protocol, informed consent document or Investigator Brochure 
(IB); and b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND  
2. R elated or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcomes may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_36923], devices or procedures involved in the research); AND  
3. S uggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than previously 
known or recognized.

he guideline is to provide a procedure for accurate and timely reporting of serious adverse events 
(SAEs) from the participating institution to the FDA, to the Principal Investigator (PI) at City of Hope 
(COH) as well as to Dendreon.  The participating institution, participating institution PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or study 
coordinators are responsible for reporting all serious adverse events immediately (within 24 hours after 
learning of the event) to their local IRB, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_149607], the Data Coordinating Center at COH and 
to Dendreon. 
The participating investigator must report each serious adverse event, regardless of attribution, to the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_511302] 24 hours of learning of the occurrence. In the event that the 
participating investigator does not become aware of the serious adverse event immediately (e.g., 
participant sought treatment elsewhere), the participating investigator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_661350] awareness of the adverse event.

8.0 Agent Information and Risks 
8.1 Sipuleucel –T (Provenge®) 
8.1.1 Sipuleucel-T overview 
Sipuleucel- T (Provenge ®) is commercially available autologous therapeutic cancer vaccine made of 
recombinant fusion protein consisting of human PAP and GM-CSF. GM-CSF acts as a targeting molecule 
that directs the PAP antigen to APCs and promotes antigen uptake and processing. PAP is a tissue-
specific target antigen rather than a tumor-specific target antigen. Studies with specific monoclonal 
antibodies and RNA probes indicate that the antigen is strictly prostate-specific. Immunohistochemical 
studies reveal that the antigen is expressed by [CONTACT_511331], and > 90% of all prostatic 
adenocarcinomas, but is not expressed by [CONTACT_511332] (Goldstein 2002). PAP is secreted by [CONTACT_511333], and an elevated serum level is found in most subjects with advanced prostate cancer 
(Kuriyama 1982). The cDNA for PAP has been isolated. Analysis of sequence homology with other 
known proteins reveals a low risk of cross-reactivity of immune responses. GM-CSF is a multilineage 
factor that may also activate mature granulocytes and macrophages, and may activate quiescent APCs. 
Sipuleucel-T is an autologous cell product consisting of APCs loaded with prostate antigen PA2024. 
Preparation of sipuleucel-T entails isolating quiescent APCs from a subject’s peripheral blood 
leukapheresis product by [CONTACT_511334] 2 days in 
the presence of PA2024. The culture medium does not contain serum or exogenous cytokines. During the 
culture process, APCs specifically and selectively pi[INVESTIGATOR_511303] (PA2024) and differentiate into antigen 
loaded APCs capable of presenting antigen to T cells. These APCs thus represent the cells responsible for 
the biological activity of sipuleucel-T. Other cell populations in sipuleucel-T co-purify with APCs during 
buoyant density centrifugation, but do not incorporate or present antigen, and are therefore referred to as 
“non-APCs.” After the culture period, the cells are washed and suspended in Lactated Ringer’s Injection, 
USP. The final preparation of PA2024-loaded APCs is designated sipuleucel-T. Sipuleucel-T is placed in 
a refrigerated package and transported to the clinical site for infusion.

mononuclear cells (PBMCs; primarily lymphocytes and monocytes). Prior mobilization with a colony-
stimulating factor is not performed. Immediately after collection, the leukapheresis product is transported 
to a regional manufacturing facility 
8.1.3 Quality Testing  
Quality control (QC) testing is performed at several time points during the manufacturing process and on 
samples of the final product. If the final product passes all required release tests, an approval to infuse the 
product (Cell Product Disposition Form) is faxed to the infusion center. If a cell product does not meet 
Dendreon quality specifications, Dendreon will contact [CONTACT_511335].

infusion is administered over approximately 60 minutes through an intravenous (IV) line suitable for 
blood transfusion (without a cell filter). Subjects are observed for at least [ADDRESS_661353] all (98.3%) patients in the Sipuleucel-T group and 96.0% in the control group reported an adverse 
event. The most common adverse events, reported in patients in the Sipuleucel-T group at a rate ≥ 15%, 
were chills, fatigue, fever, back pain, nausea, joint ache, and headache. In 67.4% of patients in the 
Sipuleucel-T group, these adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Severe (Grade 3) and life-
t
hreatening (Grade 4) adverse events were reported in 23.6% and 4.0% of patients in the Sipuleucel-T 
group compared with 25.1% and 3.3% of patients in the control group. Fatal (Grade 5) adverse events 
were reported in 3.3% of patients in the Sipuleucel-T group compared with 3.6% of patients in the control 
g
roup. The most common (≥ 2%) Grade 3-5 adverse events reported in the Sipuleucel-T group were back 
pain and chills.  
Serious adverse events were reported in 24.0% of patients in the Sipuleucel-T group and 25.1% of 
patients in the control group. Serious adverse events in the Sipuleucel-T group included acute infusion 
reactions, cerebrovascular events, and single case reports of eosinophilia, rhabdomyolysis, myasthenia 
gravis, myositis, and tumor flare.  
Sipuleucel-T was discontinued in 1.5% of patients in Study [ADDRESS_661354] leukapheresis procedure approximately 3 days prior to the 
infusion. Adverse events that were reported ≤ 1 day following a leukapheresis procedure in ≥ 5% of 
patients in controlled clinical trials included citrate toxicity (14.2%), oral paresthesia (12.6%), paresthesia 
(11.4%), and fatigue (8.3%).

Radiation therapy 
8.2.1 Treatment Plan: 
In patients assigned to Arm B one metastatic site will be selected for radiation based primarily on the 
safety of radiation in that location. Radiation to bone metastases in L3-S5, pelvis and femurs will be 
excluded provided that patients have other areas of metastases. Patients who have metastases only in the 
above locations (L3-S5, pelvis and femurs) will be allowed provided that they have normal WBC and 
they will not receive radiation to more than 20% of the bone marrow. The gross tumor volume (GTV) 
will be defined as the radiological dimensions of the lesion as identified by [CONTACT_76964]/or MRI. The planning 
tumor volume (PTV) is defined as the GTV plus 1 cm. For lesions that move with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (Rib and 
lung parenchymal lesions for example) CT simulation will be performed at inspi[INVESTIGATOR_511304]. The GTV will be defined based on lesion position 
during the respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126]. Radiation treatment fields will arranged to minimize dose to the marrow and 
whole body. Conventional AP/PA technique will be used. Field will be limited to 10 by 10 cm.Patients 
will be treated with 300 cGy/day to 3000 cGy; Approximately 7 days after completion of radiation 
therapy, patients will begin therapy with Sipuleucel-T autologous vaccine. 
8.2.2 Toxicity: 
The risks of radiation therapy depend on the part of the body being treated. These side effects are 
generally mild and expected to resolve 1-2 weeks after radiation is completed:  
-fatigue,  
-anorexia 
-gastroesophageal reflux 
-diarrhea 
-nausea 
-dysuria 
-urinary frequency 
-pain flare 
-skin rash,  
-neutropenia,  
-thrombocytopenia,  
-anemia 
Long term effects of radiation also depend on the specific location being treated and include:  
- pneumonitis  
- cystitis  
- hematuria 
- secondary malignancy 
- chronic diarrhea 
- bowel perforation

coated with either PA2024, PAP or Tetanus (an assay control, and measure of 
immunocompetence) overnight, after which time plates are blocked with PBS/casein and 
then washed with PBST.  Serially diluted serum is then added in duplicate to each set of 
plates and incubated at room temperature for [ADDRESS_661359] and then incubated with a mixture of anti-IgM and anti-IgG (Jackson 
Immunoresearch) for an hour.  After this time plates are washed again with PBST and

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]   Version Date:  10/24/2017 Version:  09   11.0 Endpoint Evaluation Criteria/Measurement of Effect 
 
11.1 Measurability of lesions 
a.  Measurable disease :  Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension by 1) medical 
photograph (skin or oral lesion), palpation, plain x-ray, CT, MRI or other conventional technique with 
longest diameter [ADDRESS_661363] (bone lesions not included), or 2) spi[INVESTIGATOR_511307] 1 cm or greater.  Ultrasound is suitable only for superficial disease (superficial palpable 
nodes, subcutaneous lesions, thyroid nodules). 
Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_661364] should be performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm. 
b.  Non-measurable disease :  All other lesions including lesions too small to be considered measurable, 
pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, bone disease, inflammatory breast disease, leptomeningeal 
disease, lymphangitis, pulmonitis, abdominal masses not confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_15218], 
cystic lesions or disease documented by [CONTACT_52311] (e.g., by [CONTACT_202752]), previously radiated 
lesions that have not progressed. 
11.2 Objective status    
Objective Status is to be recorded at baseline, at week 12  (or at the time of disease progression if it 
happened earlier than 12 weeks)  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_661365] be noted for non-target measurable and non-measurable disease. 
a.   Complete Response (CR) :  Complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable disease.  
No new lesions.  No disease related symptoms, normalization of disease-related abnormal lab values. 
Normalization of PSA marker to ≤.0.2 in patients who had prior prostatectomy. In patients who had 
primary radiation therapy to prostate gland  PSA decrease to  < nadir +2. All disease must be assessed 
using the same technique as baseline. 
b.   Partial Response (PR) :  Radiographic PR applies only to patients with at least one measurable 
lesion.  Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of longest diameters of all 
target measurable lesions.  No unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease.  No new lesions.  
All target measurable lesions must be assessed using the same techniques as baseline. PSA PR refers 
to PSA decline by >50% from baseline and confirmed at least 3 weeks later.  
c.   Stable:  Does not qualify for CR, PR, Progression or Symptomatic Deterioration.  All target 
measurable lesions must be assessed using the same techniques as baseline. 
d.   Progression :  One or more of the following must occur:  20% increase in the sum of longest 
diameters of target measurable lesions over smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease 
during therapy) using the same techniques as baseline.  Unequivocal progression of non-measurable 
disease in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021] (an explanation must be provided).  Appearance of any 
new lesion/site.  PSA increase by 25 % form baseline or nadir (whichever was smaller) and by ≥ 2 
ng/mL at 12 weeks. Death due to disease without prior documentation of progression and without 
symptomatic deterioration.  
Page 36 of 50 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]   Version Date:  10/24/2017 Version:  09   e.    Symptomatic deterioration :  Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of progression.  Efforts should be made to obtain objective 
evidence of progression after discontinuation. 
f.    Assessment inadequate, objective status unknown :  Progression or symptomatic deterioration has 
not been documented, and one or more target measurable lesions have not been assessed or 
inconsistent assessment methods were used. 
g.   Objective status notes: 
1.   Non-measurable and non-target measurable disease do not affect objective status except in 
determination of CR (must be absent --a patient who otherwise has a CR, but who has non-
measurable or non-target measurable disease present or not assessed, will be classified as having 
a PR), and in determination of progression (if new sites of disease develop or if unequivocal 
progression occurs in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021]).  
2. An objective status of PR or stable cannot follow one of CR.  Stable can follow PR only in the 
rare case that tumor increases too little to qualify as progression, but enough that a previously 
documented 30% decrease no longer holds. 
3. In cases for which initial flare reaction is possible (hypercalcemia, increased bone pain, erythema 
of skin lesions), objective status is not progression unless either symptoms persist beyond [ADDRESS_661366] progressed.  
5. For bone disease documented on bone scan only, increased uptake does not constitute 
unequivocal progression. 
6. Appearance or worsening of pleural effusions does not constitute unequivocal progression unless 
cytologically proven of neoplastic origin. 
7. If CR determination depends on a lesion for which the status is unclear by [CONTACT_511339], it is 
recommended the residual lesion be investigated with biopsy or fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. 
12.0 Data Reporting/Protocol Deviations 
12.1 Confidentiality and Storage of Records 
The original data collection forms will be stored at the originating institution in a secure location. Study 
data will be entered into an electronic case report form (eCRF) using an encrypted, password protected, 
secure electronic data capture (EDC) application that meets all HIPAA requirements.  When results of 
this study are reported in medical journals or at meetings, identification of those taking part will not be

12.4 Protocol Deviations 
12.5 Deviation Policy 
This protocol will be conducted in accordance with COH’s “Clinical Research Protocol Deviation Policy” 
located at http://www.coh.org/dsmc/Documents/Institutional%20Deviation%20Policy.pdf . 
Deviations from the written protocol that could increase patient risk or alter protocol integrity require 
prior IRB approval of a single subject exception (SSE) request.  In addition, if contractually obligated, the 
sponsor must also approve the deviation.  IRB pre-approved SSE protocol modifications are considered 
an amendment to the protocol and not a deviation.  The submission of a deviation report is not required. 
Brief interruptions and delays may occasionally be required due to travel delays, airport closure, 
inclement weather, family responsibilities, security alerts, government holidays, etc.  This can also extend 
to complications of disease or unrelated medical illnesses not related to disease progression.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_511308].  Examples include, but are not limited to:  a) dose 
adjustments based on excessive patient weight; b) alteration in treatment schedule due to non-availability 
of the research participant for treatment; c) laboratory test results which are slightly outside the protocol 
requirements but at levels that do not affect participant safety.  These instances are considered to be 
deviations from the protocol.  A deviation report will be submitted to the DSMC/IRB within five days. 
12.5.[ADDRESS_661369] to report to 
the IRB following review. 
12.5.2 Resolving Disputes 
The COH Investigational Drug Service (IDS) cannot release a research agent that would cause a protocol 
deviation without approval by [CONTACT_978].  Whenever the protocol is ambiguous on a key point, the IDS 
should rely on the PI [INVESTIGATOR_177380].

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]   Version Date:  10/24/2017 Version:  09   I
n situations where there is misperception or dispute regarding a protocol deviation among the persons 
involved in implementing the protocol, it is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_511309] (or designee) to arrive at resolution.

numbers of CD54+ cells for the generation of  Sipuleucel-T, and tolerability reflected in the patient’s 
willingness or ability to receive the three infusions.     Secondary endpoints will include toxicity, and 
measurements of immune responses to PAP, PA2024 and PSA and radiologic responses to therapy with 
Sipuleucel-T +/- external beam radiation therapy to single metastasis.      
13.2 Sample Size Accrual Rate 
Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who are candidates for Sipuleucel- T 
immunotherapy.  Total Sample size 50.  Anticipated accrual is 2-3 patients a month. Likely duration of 
the study is 2 years.  Randomization is 1:1.  
13.3 Statistical Analysis Plan 
Primary Endpoint: Previous publications suggest 8% were unable or unwilling to receive all three 
infusions of Sipuleucel-T.  We will stop accrual at any time if more than 2 patients are unable to receive 
all three infusions and more than 30% of the patients are unable to receive all three infusions.  This rule 
has a 4% of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_223854] 8% are unable or unwilling to receive all three infusions, and a 82% chance of 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_511310] 33% are  unable or unwilling to receive all three infusions (based on 1000 simulations). 
In addition, if [ADDRESS_661371] 10 are unable to initiate Sipulecel-T immunotherapy on Arm B, the 
study will hold accrual pending review by [CONTACT_511340], sponsor and PI. This slightly increase the 
chance of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (3 of 10 is not “more than 30%” but equal to 30%).    Previous publications 
suggest only 2% of patients are unwilling or unable to begin Sipuleucel-T immunotherapy. 
In addition, to the above stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74239], there will be a safety review of the toxicities after [ADDRESS_661372] to limit patient exposure to arm B if it proves poorly tolerated or too toxic. 
Secondary Endpoint: 
From the IMPACT study, titers of antibodies against prostatic acid phosphatase exceed ed 400 in 28.5% of 
t
he patients treated with Sipuleucel-T.  By [CONTACT_7661] a control group, a Fisher's exact test with a 0.[ADDRESS_661373] 86% power to detect the difference between non-radiation proportion, 
0.285 and a radiation-treated group proportion of 0.570 when the sample size in each group is 25. Also, 
with 25 patients, if the true proportion about 400 is 28.5% in the control arm, and 48.5% in the radiation 
arm, there is less than a 5% chance (~1% if the radiation proportion is 57%) that the observed proportion 
will be higher in the control arm, and there is an 85% chance that difference will exceed 8% between the 
two arms.  In addition, secondary endpoints will include measurements of immune responses to PA2024 
and PSA and radiologic responses to therapy with Sipuleucel-T +/- external beam radiation therapy to 
single metastasis.      
As a result, by [CONTACT_7661] a concurrently randomized control arm, initial comparisons of Arm A and Arm B 
including the influence of radiation on PSA kinetics and response, toxicity and tolerability will help

otivate future studies.  For this exploratory secondary analysis, we will not include patients (if any) who 
do not start Sipuleucel-T immunotherapy, but will include all patients who start.  A subset analysis of 
patients able to complete the planned three infusions will also be conducted.

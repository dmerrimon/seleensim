 Single site study conducted at : Retina Foundation of the Southwest  
     [ADDRESS_352043] -rebalanced dichoptic movies (with fellow eye contrast reduced)  have been 
shown to be an effective binocular treatment for amblyopia in a laboratory setting. Yet, 
at-home therapy is a more practical approach. While c ontrast -rebalanced binocular 
tablet games  have been shown to be an effective at-home t reatment for amblyopia,  the 
games can be challenging for some of the youngest children  with amblyopia.  To 
address this need, we will compare  dichoptic movies, streamed at -home on a handheld 
3D-enabled game console, versus patching as amblyopia treatment for children aged [ADDRESS_352044] -of-care 2  hours/day patching. A secondary objective  is to 
determine whether amblyopic eye visual acuity improvement at the 2 -week visit is 
significant in each of the treatment groups.
 Fifty-six amblyopic children ( aged 3-7 years ) 
will be randomly assigned to patching (2 h ours/day, 7 days/week; 28 hours total ) or 
binocular treatment (3 dichoptic movies per week; 9 hours total ). In the context  of prior 
amblyopia treatment results with at -home contrast -rebalanced tablet g ames and with in -
lab contrast -rebalanced movies, we anticipate that dichoptic movies, streamed at -home 
on a handheld 3D -enabled game console  will be more effective than patching.  
 Rationale and background  
Contrast -rebalanced binocular tablet games (with fellow eye contrast reduced) have 
been shown to be an effective treatment for amblyopia.

as an effective treatment for children aged 4 to 12 years with amblyopia.3 With as little 
as 9 hours of vie wing time, mean improvement of visual acuity of the amblyopic eyes 
was 1.5 to 2.0 lines.4,5 There is evidence that younger ch ildren (<7 years) are more 
responsive to amblyopia treatments,6,[ADDRESS_352046] -of-care patching treatment.

Methodology  
Children aged 3 to 7 years who are diagnosed by [CONTACT_288761], anisometropia, or both (combined mechanism) are 
eligible. Diagnoses, alignment, prior treatment, and visual acuity for visits prior to enrollment w ill be extracted from the referring doctor’s medical records.  
 Inclusion criteria  
-Amblyopic eye visual acuity of 0.2 to 0.8 logMAR  
-Fellow eye visual acuity of -0.1 to 0.2 logMAR  
-Interocular visual acuity difference of >0.2 logMAR  
-Anisometropia or corrected strabismus (<5pd) 
-Wearing glasses for at least [ADDRESS_352047] be able to see the full movie screen (both amblyopic and fellow eye components) 
with fellow eye contrast set to 20%.  
 
Exclusion criteria  
-Prematurity of 8 w eeks or more  
-Coexisting ocular or systemic disease  
-Developmental delay  
-Significant ocular misalignment (>=5 pd).  
 Study Design  
This study is a randomized clinical trial (parallel group design). At the baseline visit, 
eligibility will be  ascertained and  vision assessments conducted. Children will be 
randomly assigned to watch contrast -rebalanced dichoptic animated movies 
(experimental treatment) or to patch the fellow eye 2 hours/day every day (standard -of-
care amblyopia treatment) for 2 weeks. Randomiza tion will performed through the 
website www.randomization.org  with a coded distribution of a 1:[ADDRESS_352048] access to the randomization assignment  (sealed in a 
numbered envelope)  only after the child is enrolled.  
 
At the [ADDRESS_352049]  the option to continue with 
movies for an additional 4 weeks (up to 6 weeks of movies for both groups). Children 
who continue  will have follow -up visits with vision assessments every 2 weeks (14±3 
days).  
 
Dichoptic Movies  
Eighteen popular animated feature films were modified using custom MATLAB software to allow dichoptic presentation on a New Nintendo 3DS XL platform (Nintendo 
Corporation, Kyoto, Japan), which will be loaned to the child for the duration of the study  
so that movies can be watched at home. This Nintendo device allow s for dichoptic 
viewing without the need for anaglyphic, polarized, or shutter glasses or a VR headset.  
The movies ha ve the same design as in our recent prospective study of contrast -
rebalanced movies in which children came into the laboratory to watch movies on a 
passive 3D display.

seen by [CONTACT_288762]. Because the blobs had Gaussian edges, 
the edges of the blobs overlap and are seen by [CONTACT_288763], 
preventing any significant rivalry. The sha pe and location of the blobs are varied 
dynamically every [ADDRESS_352051] start s at 20% for the first movie and 
increment s by 10% for each subsequent movie (i.e., 20%, 22%, 24%, 26%, 29%, …). 
Movies have been uploaded to our Amazon Web Services (AWS; Seattle, WA, [LOCATION_003]) 
streaming service in two -week packets, each containing 6 movies that preserve the 
order of fellow eye contrasts from low to high.  
 
Study Protocol  
Children allocated  to the dichoptic movie arm will be  asked to watch 3 movies per  week 
(about 4.5 hours per week) during each [ADDRESS_352052] of 
movies 1 -6 increment from 20% to 32% during the first 2 weeks, movies 7 -12 increment 
from 35% to 57% during weeks 3 and 4 and, finally, movies 13 -18 increment from 63% 
to 100% if children participate  in the optional weeks 5 and 6.  Children allocated  to the 
patching arm will be  supplied with patches and asked to patch two hours per day for two 
weeks. At the 2 -week visit, children in the patching group will be loaned a Nintendo and 
begin watching movies, starting with 20% fellow eye contrast for the next two weeks, 
and have the o ption of completing up to [ADDRESS_352053] -corrected visual acuity (BCVA) will be tested at 
each visit using the Amblyopia Treatment Study HOTV protocol for [ADDRESS_352054];  stereoacuity w ill be converted to log arcsec for 
analyses; nil stereoacuity w ill be arbitrarily assigned a value of 4.0.[ADDRESS_352055] at 7 
distances (3m, 2m, 1m, 0.67m, 0.5m, 0.33 m, and 0.16m); the farthest distance at which the ch ild report s 4 dots will be  converted to the area of suppression scotoma in log 
degrees.  
15 Depth of suppression will be evaluated using a dichoptic eye chart that 
identifies the non -preferred eye/preferred eye contrast ratio (i.e., balance point) at which 
the child can overcome suppression and report letters presented to each eye with equal likelihood (Contrast Balance Index; CBI).

treatment for amblyopia,
4,5  we anticipate a 0.15±0.10 logMAR (7.5 letters) improvement 
in visual acuity at the 2 -week primary outcome visit for children assigned to the 
dichoptic movie arm.  For children assigned to the patching group, we anticipate a 0.07±0.10 logMAR (3.5 letters) i mprovement at [ADDRESS_352057] -rebalanced dichoptic game as a treatment for 
amblyopia.
2 With these expected means, a sample size of 28 per group (56 total) w ill 
provide 85% power to declare that the two groups have significantly different means, using a two -sided p -value of less than 0.05. We will e nroll and randomize  62 children 
(31 per group) to account for potential 10% loss to follow -up. 
 
 
Expected Outcome s 
Results will be disseminated at the annual meetings of the Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology & Strabismus and the Association for Research in Vision & 
Ophthalmology and submitted for publication in a leading medical/scientific journal.  
 If this novel at -home binocular movie treatment is effective in improving  amblyopic eye 
visual acuity, it will provide  an additional treatment option for amblyopia  in young 
children .

Phenylephrine Versus Upper Eyelid Tapi[INVESTIGATOR_594336]'s Muscle -
Conjunctival Resection Evaluation  
2) Objectives  
In this study, we will be assessing whether Phenylephrine 2.5% ophthalmic solution eye drops better demonstrate surgical need when  
compared to traditional upper eyelid tapi[INVESTIGATOR_594337]’s  muscle-conjunctival resection.  
 
3) Background 
Prior research has quantified the loss of superior visual field (SVF) and degree of impairment attributed to ptosis
18, 19, 23, 2 9. Loss of vision due to 
ptosis can lead to difficulty performing activities of daily living, and surgical intervention has been demonstrated to significantly improve quality of life
2, 4, 10, 11, 25. The goal of surgical repair is to improve vision 
by [CONTACT_594353]1. Various 
procedures can be performed to accomplish this including external l evator 
resection, Muller’s muscle and conjunctival resection or frontalis suspension
1,2,5,10. To assess whether the patient’s ptosis is affecting their 
peripheral vision, SVF  testing  is routinely performed on the ptotic eye first 
at baseline, then after manual tapi[INVESTIGATOR_594338]1,6,11,12. Tapi[INVESTIGATOR_594339]. Baseline visual field testing is performed with the eyelid and brow in the resting position, and  patients must be documented as having a baseline superior 
visual field of [ADDRESS_784125] 12 degrees over baseline with eyelid and brow elevation
1,6,7, 27, 30.  
 In a recent study, less than half of patients evaluated with ptosis alone met insurance criteria for visual field improvement after eyelid tapi[INVESTIGATOR_594340], who met criteria in all cases after tapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]
21. This prompted the question of whether manual 
tapi[INVESTIGATOR_594341]. Unlike with dermatochalasis (excess skin) or brow ptosis (droopi[INVESTIGATOR_594342]), ptosis (droopi[INVESTIGATOR_594343]) requires direct tapi[INVESTIGATOR_594344]
20. In addition, direct tapi[INVESTIGATOR_594345], which can blur vision. Prior research has demonstrated the difficulties associated with manual upper eyelid tapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and  alternative  tapi[INVESTIGATOR_594346]
20. 
 This study will evaluate whether Phenylephrine 2.5% ophthalmic solution can more accurately measure ptosis severit y as compared to  manual  upper 
eyelid  tapi[INVESTIGATOR_594347] r. 
Phenylephrine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist and works to elevate the 
 Page 3 of 14  Revis ed: June 24, [ADDRESS_784126] intervention outcomes, and as a tool in 
planning surgical procedures5, 8, 13, 14, 22, 24, 26. In particular, the so -called 
“Phenylephrine Test” has been used by [CONTACT_594354] c onjunctival Mullers muscle resection s2, 5, 13, 16. To our 
knowledge, this is the first study to directly compare Phenylephrine ophthalmic solution to traditional eyelid tapi[INVESTIGATOR_594348].

- Photography: 
o Photographs will be taken prior to testing, with the eyelids taped prior to visual field testing, and with phenylephrine eye drops applied prior to visual field testing. These photographs are standard of practice when submitting documentation to insurance.  
o The participant may decline the publishing of these photographs and still be included in the study.  
- Patient recruitment and consent : 
o Patients will be recruited from the waiting area and during clinic visits at the ophthalmic plastic surgery department at  the Bascom Palmer Eye 
Institute . 
o Patients will be given verbal and written information about the study  and all 
questions will be answered  to ensure comprehension and willingness  to 
participate.  
o Patients will sign the physical  study consent form  prior to the study 
(Appendix II). A copy of this consent form will be provided to the 
participant upon request.  
- Research procedure:  
o The researcher will evaluate the MRD1 (Margin to Reflex Distance, 
specifically the distance in millimeters from the light reflex at the center of the eye to the center of the upper eyelid), then the participant will undergo superior visual field testing using the tangent screen method.  
o These two measures will be evaluated with the ptotic eye in three distinct 
conditions, all patients will be measured in all three conditions, as outlined in the following diagram: 
 
 First, MRD1 and superior visual field will be analyzed at baseline with no manual tapi[INVESTIGATOR_594349].  

 Page 6 of 14  Revis ed: June 24, 2025  Next, the evaluation will occur with the ptotic upper eyelid 
manually lifted and taped.  
 Lastly, the upper eyelid will be released, and one drop of phenylephrine 2.5% ophthalmic solution will be placed in the conjunctival fornix of the ptotic eye by [CONTACT_594356]. The analysis  will begin 10 
minutes after drop instillation to ensure maximum eyelid 
elevation
3.   
 Participants will be provided with breaks in between each of the three conditions as needed.  
o The entire study should take no more than 60 minutes. 
 There are numerous tests that can be used to assess visual field including Tangent screen, Goldmann perimetry, and Humphrey visual field. Tangent screen has been found to be the fastest modality of the three. In one study, testing duration of both eyes with the eyelids in the natural and taped positions took on average 12:10 by [CONTACT_594357] 18:[ADDRESS_784128], tangent screen testing was found to take an average of 6:23 to evaluate both eyes in both conditions
1.   
o There will be no additional testing or follow- up once the above research 
procedure has been completed.  
6) Data and Specimen Banking  
This section is not applicable.  This research is not banking data or specimens for 
future use.  
 
7) D
ata Management 
The data will be collected and stored in Box, a secure and HIPAA -
compliant cloud storage platform . Any paper records will be kept under 
lock and key in the PI’s office. The records kept in the PI’s office will not be linked to the patient’s name [CONTACT_594364]-identified according to HIPAA requirements. The key that links the study numbers to the patient identifiers will be kept separately under lock and key. Only study team members, members of the patient’s clinical care team members and people in departments or on committees responsible for overseeing the research will have  access to the data collected.  
 Statistical procedures will include paired  t-test comparing MRD1 values 
between control  and phenylephrine, and McNemar’s test to evaluate the 
proportion of eyes that meet insurance criteria between tapi[INVESTIGATOR_594350]. Spearman correlation  analysis  will be used to assess any 
correlation between changes in MRD1 and VF performance after phenylephrine. Additionally, a paired t- test will compare patient 
satisfaction scores after tapi[INVESTIGATOR_594350].  
8) Risks to Subjects  
- Privacy  
 Page 7 of 14  Revis ed: June 24, 2025 o We anticipate that this study will entail minimal psychological/social 
stress related to privacy and confidentiality. Investigators will minimize the risk of loss of confidentiality by [CONTACT_594358], and by [CONTACT_594359]-identifying information in summary format. Personal information will be protected to the fullest extent allowed according to federal regulations.  
- Adverse Events & Serious Adverse Events   
o An adverse event  will be defined as any event that may harm the subject 
or require the subject to seek medical attention, and a serious adverse event  will be defined as adverse events that require the subject to seek 
medical attention and may be life threatening.   
o Adverse Events  
 Adverse events include falls during or immediately after taking the visual field test. Individuals without a fall risk will be chosen for the study. In addition, they will be given clear instructions and training to prevent falls.   
 This protocol calls for three iterations of tangent screen visual field testing which requires focus and can lead to patient fatigue. Prolonged, uninterrupted superior visual field testing will be avoided, and breaks of 5 minutes will be afforded to the pa tient 
between tests as needed.  
o Serious Adverse Events   
 A serious fall during or immediately after taking a visual test constitutes a serious adverse event. The same precautions as mentioned above will be taken to prevent this.   
 Phenylephrine can potentially cause nausea, vomiting, headache, and can lead to exacerbations of underlying cardiovascular disease
28. However, the amount of phenylephrine available 
systemically following ophthalmic application is generally less in comparison to oral or IV doses. Additionally, this study will not include patients with serious underlying cardiovascular disease. 
 Phenylephrine can also cause blurring of vision impacting activities of daily living such as driving
15. To minimize risk, study 
team members will set expectations about the testing procedure and associated risks (including cautioning against driving or operating machinery immediately following dosing) prior to 
testing in the clinic.   
 Risks of Muller's Muscle -Conjunctival Resection may include 
over-exposure of the eye, an asymmetry between eyes, inward or 
outward-turning eyelid, eyelash loss, infection, bleeding, or changes in vision.  
 
9) Potential Benefits to Subjects  
- The study will ultimately provide information for future patients by 
[CONTACT_104407] a better understanding of whether phenylephrine 2.5% ophthalmic 
 Page 8 of 14  Revis ed: June 24, 2025 solution can be used as a more effective criteria for surgical ptosis repair 
evaluation .

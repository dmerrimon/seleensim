SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA209374
Protocol Title:  A Phase 3b/4 Safety Trial of Nivolumab (BMS -936558) in Subjects with Advanced or Metastatic 
Renal Cell Carcinoma 
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s):  Nivolumab (BMS -936558), 240 mg every two weeks as a 30 minute (minutesIV infusion. 
Subjects may continue to receive treatment for a maximum of 24 months or until confirmed disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal of informed consent or the study  is discontinued by [CONTACT_1034] . Treatment can 
continue beyond initial assessment of progression as specified in Section 4.5.3.  
Study Phase:  3b/4
Research Hypothesis:  The frequency of high grade (CTCAE vs 4.0 Grade 3-5) immune-mediated adverse events 
(IMAE s) observed in patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma who are treated with nivolumab
monotherapy will not differ from historical adverse event data in this patient population .
Objective:  
Primary Ob jective: 
To assess the incidence of high grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3 -4 and Grade 5) IMAEs in subjects with advanced 
or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who are treated with nivolumab monotherapy .
Secondary Objective: 
To characterize the outcome of all high grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3 4 and Grade 5) IMAEs in subjects with 
advanced or metastatic RCC who are treated with nivolumab monotherapy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study Design:  
This is a Phase 3b/[ADDRESS_608632] dose. Approximately 150 eligible subjects will be treated with 
240mgnivolumab IV, over 30minutes (minutesevery 2weeks. Each 28-day dosing period will constitute a 
cycle.
Subjects will be enrolled into 1of 3treatment groups as follows:
Group 1: Subjects with predominant clear cell histology :  75 subjects (approximate )

Group 2: Subjects with non-clear cell histology:  50 subjects (approximate , with a minimum of 50 
subjects with non -clear cell histology ).
Group 3: Subjects with brain metastases regardless of histology: 25 subjects (approximate) .
Note:  If enrollment of 25 patie nts with brain met astases cannot be reached, the number of patients with non-clear 
cell (preferred) or clear cell histology group willbe increased .
Subjects who are found on screening CT/MRI to have brain metastases will be enrolled to Group 3,if they do no t 
require active treatment (radiation treatment/corticosteroids). Sub jects who are found on screening CT/MRI to have 
brain metastases that require immediate treatment with radiation treatment/corticosteroids will be re-enrolled to 
Group 3 after completing active treatment. Subjects who develop brain metastases while on treatment with 
nivolumab will not be re-assigned to Group 3 but will remain in the group assigned at enrollment (See 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for recommendations on palliative brain radiotherapy  and resumption of treatment with nivolumab.) 
Brain lesions will be assesse d only  as non- target lesions.
After screening and enrollment, subjects will be treated for a maximum of [ADDRESS_608633] treatment (LPFT).  
Subjects treated in the study who continue to derive benefit from the study treatment after [ADDRESS_608634] of care foll owing completion of the study.

Study Population :  The study will enroll subjects with a dvanced ( i.e., not amenable to curative surgery  or radiatio n 
therapy) or metastatic (AJCC Stage IV) RCC with histo logical confirmation of predominant clear -cell or non-clear 
cell (papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396] , chromophobe , translocation associated or unclassified ) RCC as defined in Appendix 4.  Subjects with 
brain metastases are eligible if they are asymptomatic, without edema, and not on corticosteroids or receiving 
radiation treatment. Subjects with favorable, intermediate and poor risk categories per MSKCC Prognostic Score
(Appendix 5)areeligible for the enrollment.
Eligible subjects with clear cell histology must have received at least 1but no more than 2 prior anti-VEGF 
therap iesin the advanced metastatic setting , and no more than 3prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , which may include an 
mTOR inhibito r per Ame ndment 02 . Subjects with non -clear cell histology  are eligible with up to 3prior systemic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including m-TOR inhibitor) orwith no prior systemic therapy .
No prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy is allowed for subjects with either RCC histology .   
 
 
 
Subjects with uncontrolled adrenal insufficiency , known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) ,known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) , or any positive test for Hepatitis B or Hepatitis 
C virus indica ting acute or chronic infection are not eligible for this study.
Study Drug: includes both Investigational [Medicinal] Products (IP/IMP) and Non-investigational 
[Medicinal] Products (Non -IP/Non-IMP) as listed:
Study Drug for CA209374
Medication Potency IP/Non -IP 
Nivolumab ( BMS -936558 )
Solution for Injection100 mg (10 mg/mL) IP
Study Assessments:  
Assessments for safety include contin uous monitoring for all adverse events using NCI CTCAE v. 4.0, including the 
IMAEs specified in Section 8.3.1.  Additio nal safety  assessments include vital signs and oxygen saturation, physical 
measurements and target physical exam, performance status, laboratory  evaluat ions (complete blood counts ,serum 
chemistry , liver function, thy roid functio n)and pregna ncy test as applicable and review of concomitant medications. 
To assess tumor response, CT/MRI will be performed at baseline and throughout the treatmen t and follow up 
periods as specified in Section 5. Additional study procedures include assessments for biomarkers, patient reported 
outcomes as evaluated by [CONTACT_475032] -19 and EQ -5D, and healthcare resource utilizat ion.  
All study procedures /assessments performed during screening, during treatment with nivolumab and during follow 
up must be completed in accordance with Table 5.1 -1, Table 5.1 -2,and Table 5.1 -3.
Statistical Considerations: 
Sample Size:  Approximately 150subjects will be treated with niv olumab in this study . This sample size 
will allow for estimating an incidence rate of 0.67% (n=[ADDRESS_608636] with events) with a 95% CI (confidence 
interval) of (0. 02%, 3.7%), or an incidence rate of 2% (n= 3subjects with events) with a 95% CI of (0. 4%, 
5.7%).Furthermore, the sample size will allow for enough events to compare incidence with historical 
adverse event data.

Endpoints:   
Primary Endpoint: The primary  objective of the study will be assessed by [CONTACT_475033] (Grade 3 -4 and Grade 5) IMAE s. 
The IMAEs are the following: skin, endocrinopathy, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, and 
neurologic adverse events .
Secondary Endpoint s: The secondary objective of the study will be assessed by [CONTACT_22097]:
 medi an time to onset, median time to resolution (Grade 3 -4)IMAEs.
 percentage of subjects who received immune modulating medication (e.g. corticoidsteroids, 
infliximab, cyclophosphamide , IVIG, and  mycophenolate mofetil), or hormonal replacement 
therapy , the p ercentage of subjects who received ≥ 40 mg prednisone equivalents, total duration of 
all immune modulating medications given for the immune -mediated event.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Analyses:
Demographics, baseline disease characteristics and baseline laboratory  results will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics for all treated subjects and all s ubjects in Groups 1, 2, and 3 .
Primary Endpoint : The number and percentage of subjects who report high grade (Grade 3-4 and 
Grade 5) IMAEs will be summarized for all treated subjects. High grade (Grade 3-4 and Grade 5) IMAEs
will be tabulated using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v4.0 criteria by [CONTACT_102458] (MedDRA) preferred term.
Second Endpoint s:  Additional descriptive statistics for high grade (Grade 3 4 and Grade 5) IMAEs will 
include median values using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) product -limit method with 95% CI using Brookmeyer 
and Crowley of time to onset and time to resolution of IMAEs , and will be presented for all treated subjects 
in Groups 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_608637] date.
Management of high-grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3-4 and Grade 5) IMAEs will be characterized by 
[CONTACT_475034] (or ho rmonal replacement 
therapy ), percentage of subjects who received ≥ [ADDRESS_608638] experience high -grade 
(CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3 -4 and Grade 5) IMAEs and all subjects in Groups 1, 2, and 3.

1.7 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
Subjects wi th advanced or metastati c renal cell  carcino ma with clear cell histol ogy who progress 
after prior anti-VEGF therapy andsubjects wit h non -clear cell histology with prior treatment or no 
prior treatm entrepresent a continued unmet medical need as progression free survival  remains 
modest with subsequent or first-line therapi [INVESTIGATOR_475022]-
angiogenic therapy .11The clinical activi ty of nivol umab observed to date in RCC suggests the 
potenti al for improved clinical  outc omes as monothe rapy. Nivol umab does have the potenti al for 
clinically- relevant adverse events including liver toxicit ies, thyro iditis, pneumo nitis, and diarrhea. 
However, the activit y and manageable AEs profile observed with nivolumab supports the 
treatm ent of patients w ith advanced or metastatic renal cell carcino ma.

In situat ions where consent cannot be given to subjects, their legally acceptable representatives (as 
per country guidelines) are clearly and fu lly informed about the purpose, potential risks, and other 
critical issues regarding clinical s tudies in which the subject volunteers to participate. 
BMS will provi de the invest igator with an appropri ate (ie, Global or Local) sample informed

level. The durati on of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The durati on of
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the invest igators should use their judgment  
in checking serum  FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is >40 mIU/ml at any time during the 
washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal:
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as lo ng as 6 months.

4.5.1 Management Algorithm for Nivolumab related adverse events
Immuno-oncol ogy (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severit y and durati on 
from AEs caused by [CONTACT_53970] c classes. Nivo lumab is considered an immuno -oncol ogy 
agent in this protocol . Early recogni tion and management of AEs associ ated with 
immuno -oncol ogy agents m ay mit igate severe toxicit y.
Management Algorithms have been devel oped to assist invest igators in assessing and managing
the following groups of AEs:
Gastrointestinal
Renal
Pulm onary
Hepati c
Endocrinopathy
Skin
Neurol ogical
The above algorithms are found in the nivo lumab Investigator Brochure, and can also be found in 
Appendix 6of this protocol .
For subjects expected to requi re more than 4 weeks of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants 
to manage and adverse event, consider recommendations provided in Adverse Event Management 
Algori thms in Appendix 6.
4.5.2 Dose Delay Criteria
Tumor assessments for all subjects should continue as per protocol even if dosing is delayed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Nivolumab Dose Delay Criteria
Nivo lumab administration should be delayed for the fo llowing:
Any Grade 2 non -skin, drug- related adverse event, with the fo llowing except ions:
Grade 2 drug-related fat igue or laboratory abnormalit ies do not require a treatment delay
Any Grade 3 skin, drug- related adverse event
Any Grade [ADDRESS_608679], ALT, or total bilirubin:
Grade 3 lymphopenia or leukopenia does not require dose delay
If a subject has a baseline AST, ALT or total  bilirubin that is within norm al limit s, delay 
dosing for drug- related Grade 2 toxicit y
If a subject has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 1 toxicity range, 
delay dosing for drug -related Grade 3 toxicit y
Any adverse event, laboratory  abnormalit y, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the invest igator, warrants delaying the dose of study medicat ion.

For the subjects who continue nivolumab study  therapy beyo nd progressi on, further progressio n 
is defined as an additional 20% increase in tumor burden volume from time of initial PD. This 
includes an increase in the sum of all target lesions and/ or the development of new measurable 
lesions. Treatment shoul d be discont inued permanent ly upon docum entati on of further disease 
progression
New lesions are considered measureable at the time of initial progressi on if the longest diameter 
is at least 10mm (except for pathol ogical lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 
15mm). Any new lesion considered non-measureable at the time of initial progressi on may 
beco me measureable and therefore included in the tum or burden volume if the longest diameter 
increases to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of 
at least 15 mm).
Subjects withglobal deteri oration of  heal th status (as determined by [CONTACT_3170]) who requir e 
discontinuat ion of treatment without objective evidence of disease progressi on at thetime of

Retesting of laboratory parameters and/or other assessments within any single Screening or Lead -
in peri od will be permitted (in addit ion to any  parameters that require a confirmatory  value).
Any new result will  override the previ ous resul t (i.e., the m ost current resul t prior to first dose of 
study  drug ) and is the value by [CONTACT_109419], as it represents the subject’s 
most current, clinical state.
Retesting must be completed in accordance with Table 5.1 -1.
5.2 Study Materials
The fo llowing m aterials will  be provi ded at study  start:

5.4 Efficacy Assessments
5.4.1 Screening (Baseline visit) and On -Study Efficacy Assessments
Study  evaluati ons will take place in accordance with Table 5.1-1andTable 5.1-2, according to 
RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_608712] with oral/intravenous contrast or contrast -enhanced 
MRI is the preferred imaging modalities for assessing radiographic tumor response. If a subject  
has a known allergy  to contrast material, please use local prophylaxis standards to obtain the 
assessment with contrast if at all possible, or use the alternate modalit y. In cases where contrast is 
strictly contraindicated, a non-contrast scan will suffice. Screening assessments shoul d be 
perfor med within 28 days of start of study  treatment. Brain MRI is the preferred imaging method 
for evaluat ing CNS metastasis, and assessment is required during screening in all eligible subjects. 
All known or suspected sites of disease (including CNS) should beassessed at screening and at 
subsequent assessments using the same imaging method and technique. If more than one method 
is used at screening, then the most accurate method according to RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_608713]

5.7 Outcomes Re search Assessments
Patient reported outcom es will be captured through the use of 2 validated self-reported 
questionnaires: the NCCN Funct ional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Kidney Symptom  Index 
(FKSI -19) and the five dimensio n (EQ -5D) and visual analog sca le (EQ -VAS).
The NCCN FKSI -19 is a 19-item scale that measures tumor specific HrQoL in kidney cancer 
patients. The FKSI -19 uses five Likert -type response categori es that range from “not at all” to 
“very much”. Patients are asked to circle the response category  that best characterizes their 
response over the last 7 days on 19 items that include symptom s such as lack of energy, fatigue,  
appeti te, coughing, shortness of breath, pain, nausea and abilit y to work. 
General health status will be measured using the EQ -5D. The E Q-5D is a standardized instrument 
for use as a measure of self-reported general health status. The EQ-5D comprises 5 dimensions 
(mobilit y, self -care, usual act ivities, pain/discomfo rt, and anxiet y) and a visual analog rating scale 
(VAS). The utilit y data generated from the EQ-5D is recommended for and commo nly used in 
healt h econo mics research analysis.
5.8 Other Assessments 
In addition, healt hcare resource utilizat ion (HRU) data (e.g., hospi [INVESTIGATOR_24509], non-protocol 
specified medical visits, etc) will be collected for all enrolled or treated subjects. Specifically, 
healt hcare resource utilizat ion is evaluated based on the number of medical care encounters such 
as hospi [INVESTIGATOR_475029], outpati ent visits, diagnosti c tests and procedures, 
concom itant medicat ions and reasons for the encounters.
5.9 Results of Central Assessments
Not applicable.
6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condit ion in a clinical invest igation subject administered study  drug and that 
Revised Protocol No.: 03
Date: 31-Oct-[ADDRESS_608715] a causal  relationship with this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory  finding), symptom , or disease 
temporally  associ ated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relat ionship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE). The ca usal relati onship can be one of the fo llowing:
Related: There is a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug 
administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relat ionship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship.
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluat ion of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regardin g the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose : 
resul ts in death
is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothet ically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
requi res inpat ient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475030] (see NOTE
below)
resul ts in persistent or signi ficant disabilit y/incapaci ty
is a congenital ano maly/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -
threatening or resul t in death or hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3092], based upon appropriate medical and 
scien tific judgment, may jeopardi ze the subject or may requi re intervent ion [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limi ted to, intensive treatm ent in an emergency room  or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_28689].) Potenti al drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  drug 
is an SAE .
Although pregnanc y, ove rdose , cancer ,and potent ial drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_186770], these events mustbe handled as SAEs. (See Section 6.1.1
for reporting pregnancies).

6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Secti ons 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safet y 
Inform ation to determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting. 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associ ated with protocol -
specified procedures. All SAEs must be co llected that occur during the screening period and within 
[ADDRESS_608716] be collected that relate to any later 
protocol -specified procedure (eg, a fo llow-up skin biopsy). 
The invest igator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study  drug or protocol -specified procedure. 
An SAE report should be co mpleted for any  event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the invest igator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the 
condi tions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complicat ion of a  study 
procedure), the relat ionship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies ,must be reported to BMS (or 
designee) within [ADDRESS_608717] be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on a 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form  (electroni c or paper forms). The preferred method for SAE data 
reporting collect ion is through the eCRF.  The paper SAE/pregnancy surveillance forms are only 
intended as a back-up option when the eCRF system  is not functioning.  In this case, the paper 
forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmissio n to:

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
In general, for nivolumab monotherapy , the safety profile to date is similar across tumor types, 
while IMAEs of high grade (Grade 3 -4) are rather unco mmo n. Their overa ll incidence was 6% in 
a previous Phase 1 trial that tested nivolumab at doses between 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg in 306 
subjects wi th different recurrent or refractory  malignancies (MDX -03).36,37
In order to further characterize the frequency and outcom e of such apparent ly infrequent safet y 
events, the current study  will treat approximately 150 subjects with nivolumab. This sample size 
will allow for estimat ing an incidence rate of 0.67% (n=[ADDRESS_608729] with events) with a 95% CI 
(confidence interval) of (0. 02%, 3.7%), or an incidence rate of 2% (n= 3subjects with events) wit h 
a 95% CI of (0. 4%, 5.7%). Furthermore, the sample size will allow for enough events to compare 
incidence in large co mmunit y pract ice wit h historical adverse event data.

The number of subjects who are evaluable for AEs in the study will be150. We make the 
conservative assumpti on based on Motzer29that the rate of IMAEs of grades 3-5 is 13%. The 
primary  goal  of the present study  is to address whether the rate is consistent with the rate reported 
in the Motzer study in the sense that th e final 95% confidence interval is wholly less than 20%. As 
indicated in Table 8.1 -1, this would happen if the observed rate is less t han 1 3.3% or l ess (20/150 
or fewer grade 3-5 IMAEs ). The trial has 61% power to demonstrate consistency of rates in the 
sense that the probabilit y is 61% of showing the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval is 
less than 20% when the true rate is 13%.   The trial has 80% power to demonstrate the consistency 
of rates when then true rate is 11.5%
The observed rate may be somewhat larger than 13.3% and will still be consistent with 
expectati ons regarding safet y, although it may raise concerns that the present popul ation may be 
different fro m that of the Motzer study or that the assessment of AEs is different in the two studies. 
Only if the 95% confidence interval extends beyond 25% would the resul ts of the study  raise 
Revised Protocol No.: 03
Date: 31-Oct-[ADDRESS_608730] 18% (27/150 or more 
grade 3-5 STRAEs) ,seeTable 8.1-1. Again assuming that the true rate is 13%, the power of  the 
study , the probabilit y that the 95% confidence interval is wholly less than 25% (and so the 
observed rate is less or equal  to18%) i s 95%. Also, if the true rate in the present study  is actually
15%, the probabilit y of showing that the 95 % confidence interval is who lly less than 25% is 82%.
8.2 Populations for Analyses
All enrolled subjects: all subjects who signed an informed consent form and were registered

The number and percentage of subjects who report high grade (Grade 3-4 and Grade 5) IMAEs 
will be summarized for all treated subjects. High grade (Grade 3-4 and Grade 5) IMAEs will be 
tabul ated using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v4.0 criteria by [CONTACT_475044] (MedDRA) preferred term.
Revised Protocol No.: 03
Date: 31-Oct-[ADDRESS_608732] ics of high grade (Grade 3 -4 and Grade 5) IMAEs will include media n 
values using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) product -limit method with 95% CI using Brookm eyer and 
Crowl ey method of time to onset and time to resol ution, and will be presented for all treated 
subjects in Groups 1, 2, and 3. Time to onset is calculated from first dosing date to the event onset 
date. The IMAEs of interest are the following: skin, endocrinopathy , gastrointestinal, hepat ic, 
renal, pulm onary, and neuro logical adverse events .If a subject never experienced the given AE, 
the subject will  be censored at the last contact [CONTACT_568]. Time to resol ution is calculated from the AE 
onset date to AE end date. If an AE is ongoing at the time of analysis, the time to resol ution will 
be censored at the last contact [CONTACT_568].
Management of high-grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3-4 and Grade 5) IMAEs will be characterized 
by [CONTACT_475045] (or horm onal 
replacement therapy ), percentage of subjects who received ≥ [ADDRESS_608733] experience high -grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3 -4 and Grade 5) IMAEs and all subjects in

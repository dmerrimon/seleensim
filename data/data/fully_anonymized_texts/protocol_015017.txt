Purpose of the Study: 
Our long- term goal is to improve outcomes from septic shock by [CONTACT_320960]. In other condition s for which treatment time affects outcomes --  
including trauma, stroke, and myocardial infarction -- system- and provider -level influences are important 
and well studied. By [CONTACT_22242], only limited data exist to guide early resource allocation in sepsis. The 
potential effect of reorganization of very early care for sepsis  is unknown.  The overall objective of the 
proposed project is  therefore to improve our understanding of  how emergency department (ED) care 
reorganization influences  time from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320952].  We propose to accomplish this goal by [CONTACT_320961] : 
 
Hypothesis/Research Questions: 
 Aim:  Determine whether multidisciplinary coordination of the initial patient evaluation in the 
emergency department influences door -to-antibiotic time for septic  patients . 
Hypothesis :  ED care reorganization (the “swarming” intervention implemented in the  
intervention  ED beginning May 1, 2016) resulted in faster door- to-antibiotic times 
for patients with sepsis or septic shock present on ED arrival. 
 Background and Significance:  Sepsis, the combination of infection, systemic inflammation, and acute organ dysfunction, is an 
increasingly common and highly morbid syndrome.
1-3 Severe sepsis and septic shock kill 20% of the 
700,[ADDRESS_396114] the U.S. medical system $24.[ADDRESS_396115] of care for sepsis.6-8 Timely administration 
of effective antibiotics is particularly important: survival suffers for  every hour’s delay.9-11 However, while 
recommending antibiotics within an hour of patient recognition, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign acknowledged a lack of data supporting the feasibility and acceptability of this target.
12  
 Upon arrival to the ED, patients perceived to need “ immediate life -saving intervention ” are assigned the 
highest triage acuity score
13 and receive  immediate evaluation by a multidisciplinary team. However, even 
among sepsis patients ultimately admitted to an Intermountain ICU, only about 5% are assigned a level [ADDRESS_396116] sepsis patien ts are assigned a lower triage priority and therefore receive sequential 
evaluation by [CONTACT_320962]. To help expedite care for the patients in this latter group, the ED at the 
intervention hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320953] 2016 to facilitate simultaneous initial evaluation by [CONTACT_320963], nurse and patient care associate  for patients with triage . This approach, termed “swarming,” 
has been associated with shorter ED length of stay and shorter time between ED arrival and physician evaluation. The impact  of this care reorganization on other important care processes, however, has not 
yet been evaluated.  
 Data set : Retrospective cohort study  
• Inclusion criteria (e xpected N=1800 , maximum expected N=3500): Adult patients age ≥18 years 
presenting to the ED  of a study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320954] 16, 2015 and 
April 15 , 2016 (pre -implementation cohort) or May 16 , 2016 and February 15, 2017 (post -
implementation cohort). Sepsis is defined as Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)  score 
≥2 poi nts above baseline in the ED plus antibiotics initiation within 24 hours of ED arrival.  
o Institutions: Alta View Medical Center, LDS Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Riverton Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
o Time frame: Patients admitted in the  months before and after implementation with a [ADDRESS_396117] “wash -in” 
 Preimplementation cohor t: May 16 , 2015 through April 15 , 2016 ( 11 months)  
 “Wash -in” period: April 16 -May 15, 2016  
 Post -implementation cohort  for potential sensitivity analysis : May 16- November  
15, 2017  ([ADDRESS_396118] -implementation)  
 Post -impl ementation cohort  for potential sensitivity analysis : May 16- February  
15, 2017  (9 months, end date due to iCentra  activation at control hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] ) 
• Exclusion criteria: Age <18 years, no antibiotics within 24 hours of ED arrival  
 
 
Outcomes:  
• Primary: Time from ED arrival to administration of first dose of antibiotics  
• Secondary: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], ED length of stay , door -to-physician evaluation time, door- to-
diagnostic testing time , door -to-lactate time  
 Primary exposure:  Arrival to intervention  ED after implementation of “swarming” protocol  
 Data collection: All patients arriving to an eligible Intermountain ED during the study timeframe will be 
evaluated electronically for meeting Sepsis III criteria (initial SOFA ≥2 above baseline and antibiotics 
started within 24 hours) . Identified subjects will have ED data  stored in the EMR and Intermountain 
Electronic Data Warehouse merged with additional data obtained by [CONTACT_320964]. Manual review of the electronic health 
record will be used to fill in missing data as needed. The patient information in the dataset will be linked to ED census , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320955],  and staffin g data  and to long- term mortality data provided from 
Utah state and the federal Social Security Death Index.  
 
Methods/Procedures:  
• Study design: Retrospective cohort study  
• Interventions: None  
• Interaction with subjects: None  
• Procedures:  Eligible subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_320965], who will generate a dataset specific to the proposed study by [CONTACT_320966]. Manual chart review will be employed as needed to supplement 
electronically -available data. This encounter level data will be linked to additional data on 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320955], physician and nurse staffing.  Long- term mortality data will be obtained 
through linkage to Utah state death records and/or the federal Social Security Death Index.  
• Outcomes:  
o Primary: Time from ED arrival to administration of first dose of antibiotics  
o Secondary: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], ED length of stay , door -to-physician evaluation t ime, 
door -to-diagnostic testing time  
• Analysis:  
o Primary analysis: Among patients with sepsis present on arrival to the ED (defined by 
[CONTACT_320967] ≥2 above baseline), a triage acuity score of 2-5, and ED arrival from May 16, 2015 to April 15, 2016 (pre -implementation cohort) or 
May 16 to November 15, 2016 (post -implementation cohort), assess change in door -to-
antibiotic time for septic ED patients at the intervention hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320956] “swarming ” protocol in May 2016 using a differences -in-differences  
linear regression  model , adjusted for confounding factors, comparing the change in 
door -to-antibiotic time before/after swarming intervention at the intervention  ED to the 
change in door -to-antibiot ic time before/after swarming intervention at other nearby  
[CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_200322].  
 Difference -in-differences model: The multivariable linear regression models will 
compare the difference  between  intervention and non -intervention hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]’ 
differences  in outcome before/after swarming intervention

variable for care at the intervention hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320957]. other site, ERA is a binary 
indicator variable for ED arrival date before/after institution of swarming 
intervention, Z is a vector of covariates and ε  is the error term.  The ß3 
parameter — with its associated 95% interval and p value — provides the 
difference -in-difference estimate and significance tests for swarming ’s influence 
on the outcome of interest.  
 Adjustment variables: mode of arrival (ambulance vs walk -in), initial sy stolic 
blood pressure, initial GCS, initial temperature,  triage acuity score, Charlson 
comorbidity score,15,16 sex, age 
o Secondary analyse s: Using a similar confounder- adjusted model (substituting logistic 
regression for binary outcomes as needed), assess change in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], ED 
length of stay, door -to-physician evaluation time, door- to-diagnostic testing time

both groups at the control hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (total N=1100 patients), a [ADDRESS_396120] -intervention period at the control hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], a type I error rate of 5%, 
and 80% power, the minimum detectable difference due to the intervention will be 
approximately [ADDRESS_396121] copy case report forms will only include study identification numbers, and 
will be stored in a locked file cabinet.  
 
Waiver of Informed Consent  and HIPAA Authorization: 
We are requesting a waiver of informed consent and HIPAA authorization for this study.  The proposed 
study involves retrospective review only of  data previously recorded in existing medical records and 
institutional data on patient census and  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/ED resources and staffing. The research involves no 
more than minimal risk to the subjects; the only potential risk is a breach of confidentiality, and protections are in place to safeguard the data.   
 Retrospective analysis of previously -collecte d and previously -recorded data should have no influence on 
the welfare of study subjects. Because risk is minimal given this design,  the waiver of consent  and 
authorization  will not adversely affect the rights or welfare of subjects.  
 
The research could no t practicably be carried out without the waiver of consent and authorization. We 
anticipate we will include up to 2000  charts/records in the dataset. The sample size for this 
retrospective chart review is large enough that including only those data for which consent could be 
obtained would prohibit conclusions to be drawn and would compromise the scientific validity of the 
study, as a large proportion of the data would be eliminated if obtaining consent were a requirement. 
The subjects whose records will be  reviewed are no longer followed and may be lost to follow up. The 
proportion of subjects who have relocated or have passed away may be a significant percentage of the 
subject population, and so the research results may not be meaningful and would lose sta tistical power 
if obtaining consent were a requirement. We feel that for these reasons, the research could not 
practicably be carried out without the waiver.  Since in the current protocol  there will be  no contact [CONTACT_320968], the risk for breach of confidentiality would be substantially greater in order to make contact [CONTACT_320969].  
 
Only data necessary for the completion of the study will be collected. Safeguards will be in place to 
protect subject identity. The data will only be accessible to members of the research team, and all 
members of the research team have completed Human Subjects Protections and understand the 
importance of protecting subject privacy and confidenti ality. No PHI will be recorded on the CRFs for the 
study dataset.  
 It is not possible  to provide subjects with information about the study as there is no feasible mechanism 
by [CONTACT_320970], attempting to do so would substantially increase the risk of a confidentiality breach, and because the information that is found will have no impact on subjects’ clinical care.  
 
Only data necessary for the completion of the study will be collected.   The patient name, subject ID and 
encounter ID are necessary  to allow identification of the specific patient encounter for supplemental 
data abstraction. The elapsed time related to various patient management actions include the primary outcome and otherwise  represent potential important factors influencing our out comes of interest.  
 
Safeguards will be in place to protect subject identity. The data will be protected from improper use or disclosure.  The study data will be kept on encrypted, password -protected computers. These computers 
are Intermountain Healthcare devices, which are routinely used for storage of patient data and research 
data including subject identifiers. No PHI will be recorded on t he CRFs for the study dataset.  Minimal 
identifiers will be maintained linked to  the data. Maintaining minimal identifiers linked to  the data is 
necessary to allow (1) manual abstraction of additional data from the electronic medical record and (2) potentia l future linkage – with IRB approval -- of the data to additional datasets. No individual subject 
data will be presented in any presentation, publication or report related to this research. Data will be 
presented only in aggregate or as results of statistical analyses and will not include any individual- level 
data that could be traced to a particular subject.  
 
Risks:  The only risk involved with this retrospective data study is a potential breach of confidentiality.  
There is a minimal risk of a privacy and confidentiality breach; however, this risk is low given the secured 
databases and computers that will be employed for data storage.  
 
Benefits:  There are no foreseeable direct benefits for the individual patient or provider subjects. 
Improved understanding of factors affecting early detection and management of sepsis could improve treatment of this syndrome thereby [CONTACT_320971], severe sepsis, and septic shock.

February 01, [ADDRESS_23970] common cause of death in the 30 days after non -cardiac 
surgery. Hypothermia increases sympathetic activation, promotes tachycardia, and 
causes hypertension — all of which may increase the risk of myocardial injury. Only one 
small study evaluated  the relationship between moderate hypothermia  and myocardial 
infarction, and was unable to make definitive  conclusions. Moderate perioperative 
hypothermia is now uncommon , but mild hypothermia (≈35.5°C) remains common . 
Whether aggressiv e warming to a truly normothermic level (≈37°C) improves outcomes 
remains unknown.  We therefore propose to test the  primary  hypothesis that aggressive 
warming reduces the incidence of major  cardiovascular  complications . Up to 5, 058 
patients will be randoml y assigned to routine care  (core temperature ≈35.5°C)  or 
aggressive warming (>37°C  core temperature ) in a multi -center trial . Patients will be 
randomly: 1)  routine thermal management  with rescue intraoperative forced -air 
warming to prevent core temperature  from decreasing to less than 35.5°C; or, 
2) aggressive  warming  to a target final intraoperative core temperature between  37 and 
37.5°C. The primary outcome  will be a composite of myocardial injury  (troponin 
elevation, apparently of ischemic origin ), non -fatal cardiac arrest, and all -cause mortality 
within 30 days of surgery. Secondary outcomes , also within 30 days,  will include: 1)  30-
day deep or organ -space surgical site infection, as defined by [CONTACT_24690] ; 2) intraoperativ e transfusion requirement, defined as units of red blood cells 
transfused; 3)  duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; and, 4) readmission within a month of surgery.

February 01, [ADDRESS_23973], remains substantial. Overall 30 -day postoperative mortality is about 1% in the 
[LOCATION_002], and about 2% amongst inpat ients (outpatients die much less frequently).3,[ADDRESS_23974] leading cause of death in the [LOCATION_002].5 Roughly a quarter 
of all 30 -day postoperative deaths are cardiovascular, or consequent t o cardiovascular 
events — with myocardial injury being by [CONTACT_24691].6  
Worldwide, 8% of surgical inpatients >[ADDRESS_23975] a postoperative 
myocardial injury  as defined by a troponin elevation that is due to an ischemic etiology, 
with only 22% of these events fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of the universal definition of 
myocardial infarction .7 Only 7% of patients experiencing a perioperative  myocardial 
infarction will have  chest pain, and 65% are entirely clinicall y silent which means that they 
will go undetected without routine troponin screening.6-9 
It is tempting to dismiss asymptomatic biomarker elevation as “troponitis” and 
assume that it is inconsequential; however, this would be a mistake because  30-day 
mortality in patients with elevated postoperative troponin is significantly and substantially 
increased with and without  symptoms.10 The term Myocardial Injury after Non -cardiac 
Surgery (MINS) recognizes that troponin elevations without a non -ischemic explanation 
(e.g., sepsis, pulmonary embolus) are clinically important — even in patients whose 
symptoms and signs do not meet the formal definition of a myocardial infarction.11  
Mortality at 30 days in patients with MINS is a concerning 10%,  which represents 
a five-fold increase  from background risk . Mortality increases exponentially as a function 
of peak postoperative troponin concentration , ranging from 9% for fourth -generation 
troponin T plasma concentrations of 0.03 -0.29 ng/ml to 17% for concentrations ≥0.3 ng/ml. 
Moreover, it is not just mortality that is increased: a composite of nonfatal cardiac arrest, 
congestive heart failure, stroke, and death occurred at a rate of 2.4% in patients without 
MINS and 18.8% amongst those with MINS, a factor -of-eight increase.10 The 
corresponding thresholds for generation five, high -sensiti vity troponin T are ≥20  ng/L with 
at least a 5  ng/L increase from baseline, or troponin ≥65  ng/L with or without an increase 
from baseline. When postoperative troponin concentrations are between 65 and 1,000 
ng/L, mortality is increased 70 -fold.7  
It is thus reasonable to ask what perioperative factors might contri bute to MINS. 
Among the likely candidates is hypothermia. Moder ate perioperative hypothermia  
(e.g.,  34.5°C)  has been shown to cause surgical site infection,[ADDRESS_23976] and 
one had a myocardial infarction versus  none in the normothermic group (36.7°C). Ten 
hypothermic patients experienced cardiovascular events  versus  two in normothermic 
patients. These fragile results, based on fewer than ten outcome events, are nearly as 
likely to be wrong as right,22 and a poor basis for health policy.  The other relevant s tudy 
had only 100 patients and was thus even more fragile.23   
An additional limitation of Frank et al21 is that diagnosis was primarily based on 
Holter ECG finding rather than troponin concentrations which are much more sensitive. 
Consequently, the overall myocardial infarction rate was <1% where the true rate is no 
less than 10% in vascular s urgery patients. It is highly questionable whether any 
conclusion about hypothermia and myocardial outcomes can be derived from a study that 
missed 90% of the presumed myocardial events.  The only other relevant trial was 
restricted to just [ADDRESS_23977]  of moderate 
hypothermia on cardiovascular  outcomes.  
An additional issue  is that perioperative normothermia is often defined as a core 
temperature ≥36°C. The difficulty is that 36°C is never  a normal temperature  in humans . 
Even at the circadian nadir , usu ally about 3:00  AM, core temperature is not normally 
below 36.5°C; and at  about  3:00 PM , core temperature is typi[INVESTIGATOR_24671] 37.5°C.24 On 
average, then, normal body temperature in humans is about 37°C, not the 36°C that is 
widely accepted as suitable for perioperative patients.20,25  
At any  given  time of day , core temperature is actively controlled by [CONTACT_24692].26 In other words, circadian temperature changes  are no t 
passive responses to  environmental perturbations  — which suggests that humans 
function best at temperature near 37°C . Consistent with this theory, randomized trials 
have shown that mild pe rioperative hypothermia causes coagulapathy,13,[ADDRESS_23978] the hypothesis that  aggressive warming to >37°C  
core temperature, versus typi[INVESTIGATOR_24672]  (≈35.5°C)  prevents  major adverse 
cardiac ev ents, defined as  30-day myocardial injury (troponin elevation) , non -fatal cardiac 
arrest, and all -cause mortality . Secondary outcomes will include infection,  transfusion,  
duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24673]-admission  within 30 days .  
February 01, 2021  
 6  Methods  
This will be  a multicenter, international, randomized clinical trial. The trial will be 
coordinated by  [CONTACT_24693], Ohio, [LOCATION_003]. 
About 200 people will be enrolled at the Cleveland Clinic.  About 5,058 patients will

Protocol  
Patients will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_23979] 
practical moment.   
The treatments will be: 1)  routine thermal management  with rescue 
intraoperative forced -air warming to prevent core temperature from decreasing to less 
than 35.5°C; or, 2)  aggressive  warmi ng to a target intraoperative core temperature 
≥37°C.  Patients will not be told to which group they are assigned . 
February 01, 2021  
 7 Patients assigned to routine thermal management will not be pre -warm ed and 
ambient intraoperative temperature will be maintained near 20°C  per routine . Only 
transfused  blood will be warmed.  An upper - or lower -body forced -air cover will be 
positioned over an appropriate non -operative site, but will not initially be activated. Should 
core temperature decrease to 35.5°C, the warmer will be activated as necessary to 
prevent core temperature from  decreasing further.  
Patients assigned to aggressive warming will be pre-warm ed with a full -body 
forced -air cover  for ≈30  minutes  before induction of anesthesia. The warmer will initially 
be set to “high” which corresponds to ≈43°C. It will subsequently a djusted to make 
patients feel warm, but not uncomfortably so. Patients will be  aggressively warmed during 
surgery  to a target  intraoperative  core tempe rature between 37 and 37.5 °C, using two 
forced -air covers when clinically practical . All intravenous flui ds will be warmed to body 
temperature.  There is no need to control ambient temperature since ambient temperature 
has little effect on core temperature in patients warmed with forced air (Pei, et al. 
unpublished).    
In nearly all countries except the Unite d States, this  approach  can be considered 
a randomization to routine care versus  extra warming.29 Numerous randomized trials 
demonstrate that pre -warming ameliorates  redistribution hypothermia30-36 which is 
otherwise the major cause of hypothermia during the initial hour of general37 or neuraxial38 
anesthesia. About 30  minutes of pre -warming is needed for a  clinically important benefit.39 
Fluid warming does not warm patients, but infusion of unwarmed fluids decreases body 
heat content and core temperature.40  
Measurements  
Baseline demographic and morphometric characteristics will be recorded, 
including height , weight , and sex . Cardiovascular risks will be recorded, including 
hypertension requiring treatment, diabetes requiring oral medications or insulin, end -
stage renal disease requiring dialysis, history of previous myocardial infarction,  
congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,  and smoking status.  
Cardiovascular medications will be similarly recorded, including beta blockers, 
angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitors , angiotensin  receptor blockers, and statins.  
Type of surgery will be characterized as orthopedic, laparoscopic, open abdominal, 
neurosur gical (including spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), and other. Timing will be characterized as elective, urgent, 
or emergent. To characterize the risk of surgical site infection, we will record whether the 
operation involved colon resection, rectal resection, other abdominal surgery , and 
whether the wound was contaminated or dirty -infected.   
Intraoperative core temperature will be measured in the distal esophagus, 
nasopharynx ([ADDRESS_23980] the nares), or pulmonary artery. Temperature will be 
recorded at 15 -minute intervals througho ut surgery. Mean -arterial pressure and heart rate 
will also be recorded at 15 -minute intervals throughout surgery. Mean arterial pressure 
and heart rate will also be recorded at 15 -minute intervals for the initial postoperative hour.  
February 01, 2021  
 8 It will be impossible  to blind patients to prewarming and intraoperative clinicians 
and investigators to group assignment. However, all postoperative measurements will be 
made by [CONTACT_24695]’ group assignment and intraoperative 
management. The study will thus be assessor blinded . To maintain blinding, the 
anesthesia record will be sealed in an opaque envelope before patients leave the post -
anesthesia care unit. The envelope will be marked “Do not open until [date 35 days after 
surgery].” Some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24674]; in those cases, we will ask 
investigators evaluating postoperative outcomes not to access the anesthesia record.   
Blood for g eneration 4 or 5 troponin  T, or troponin I (per clinical routine)  will be 
recorded  preope ratively  up to [ADDRESS_23981], neck, or arm pain. 
Blood troponin concentrations exceeding site thresholds (depending on  individual types 
of troponin tests) should prompt  cardiology consultation, an electrocardiogram, and if 
possible, and echocardiogram.  Hemoglobin will also be obtained on the first postoperative 
morning. Other preoperative laboratory values and relevant testing will be recorded if 
available (but are not required per protocol), including hemoglobin, creatinine, and blood 
troponin concentrations after the  mandated  initial two postoperative days.   
Quality -of-recovery [ADDRESS_23982] 
postoperative day, attempts will be made on the fourth postoperative day.  Patients will 
also be evaluated for various outcomes on the day of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5514] 30 days 
after surgery , with a +[ADDRESS_23983] patients w ill begin about 
day 30 and continue through postoperative day 35.  The study will be censored at day 30, 
even if patients remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
The primary outcome  will be  a composite of  myocardial injury  after non -cardiac 
surgery (MINS) , non -fatal cardiac arrest,  and all-cause mortality  within [ADDRESS_23984] two postoperative day  troponin  values crossing site specific thresholds for MINS so 
long as patient s remai n hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. Abnormal troponin concentrations  will be evaluated  
as clinically  indicated  with ECG, echocardiography, and clinical symptoms; the resulting 
values will be recorded , as will o ther cardiovascular  interventions such as angioplasty. 
MINS will b e diagnosed by  [CONTACT_24696] (e.g.,  no other obvious cause for artifactual elevation). Myocardial 
infarction  will also be centrally adjudicated and require both MINS and at least one 
symptom (e .g., chest pain or shortness of breath) or sign (e.g.  ECG or echocardiogram 
abnormality).    
We will consider all patients who had an elevated serum troponin concentration 
anytime during the first 30 days after surgery and determine the presence of any ischemic 
features ( i.e., whether patients fulfilled the universal definition of myocardial infarction),[ADDRESS_23985] occurred during or after 
surgery ( i.e., no evidence to support it was due to a preoperative event).  
Myocardial injury will be considered when a postoperative troponin concentration 
is elevated and believed to be consequent to myocardial ischemia. The thresholds differ 
depending on the assay generation and typ e. We will use the following thresholds based 
on available literature:  
1. non-high-sensitivity (fourth -generation) troponin T ≥0.03 ng/ml ;  
2. high-sensitivity  troponin T ≥65 ng/L; or high-sensitivity troponin T 20-64 ng/L and 
an increase  ≥5 ng/L from baseline ;  
3. high-sensitivity troponin  I (Abbott assay) is ≥75  ng/L44; 
4. high-sensitivity troponin I (Siemens assay) is ≥60  ng/L (Borges, unpublished);  
5. troponin I (other assays) is at least twice  local 99th percentile s; 
6. an increase of at least 20% in patients who have preoperative  high-sensitivity 
troponin concentrations that exceed 80% of the relevant thresholds in items [ADDRESS_23986] be a 20% rise 
beyond the chronic troponin value or beyond the last measurement of the acute 
preoperative myocardial injury that was clearly demonstrated to have peaked and was 
coming down. Patients meeting diagnostic criteria for MINS  will be evaluated for 
myocardial infarction  with EKG  and ECHO with cardiac consultation , which  will help us 
detect all infarctions and increase the baseline incidence.  
Secondary outcomes  will include :  
1) 30-day deep or organ -space surgical site infection, as defined by [CONTACT_24697] *;  
2) Intraoperative transfusion requirement , defined as units of red  blood  cells 
transfused ;  
3) Duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (censored at 30 days ); 
4) Readmission within a month of surgery ; 
 
Exploratory outcomes will be : 
1) Estimated  intraoperative  blood loss ; 
2) The change in blood hemoglobin from preoperatively to the first 
postoperative morning;  
3) 30-day superficial surgical site infection ; 
4) Quality -of-recovery [ADDRESS_23987] postoperative day  in person or by [CONTACT_24698] ;41 
5) 30-day myocardial infarction  meeting requirements of  the Third Universal 
Definition .43 
*Definitions of surgical site infections, modified from 1990 CDC criteria: 
http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/SSI/table1 -SSI.html . 
1. Superficial infection  
February 01, [ADDRESS_23988] one of the following:  
 Purulent drainage  from the superficial incision.  
 Organisms isolated from culture of fluid or tissue from the superficial 
incision.  
 At least one of the following signs or symptoms of infection: pain or 
tenderness, localized swelling, redness, or heat and superficial incision  is 
deliberately opened by [CONTACT_7995], unless  incision is culture -negative.  
 Diagnosis of superficial incis ional SSI by [CONTACT_24699].  
 
2. Deep infection  
Infection appears to be related to the operation  and infection involves deep 
soft tissues (e.g., fascial and muscle layers) of the incision  and at least one 
of the following:  
 Purulent drainage from the deep incision but not from the organ/space 
component of the surgical site.  
 A deep incision spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened by a 
surgeon when the patient has at least one of the following signs or  
symptoms: fever (>38°C), localized pain, or tenderness, unless site is 
culture -negative.  
 An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision is 
found on direct examination, during r eoperation, or by [CONTACT_24700].  
 Diagnosis of a deep i ncisional SSI by a surgeon or attending physician.  
 
3. Organ -space infection  
Infection  involves any part of the anatomy (e.g., organs or spaces), other 
than the incision, which was opened or manipulated during an 
operation  and at least  one of the following:  
 Purulent drainage from a drain that is placed through a stab wound‡ into the 
organ/space.  
 Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue in 
the organ/space.  
 An abscess or other evidence of infection involving the organ/space tha t is 
found on direct examination, during reoperation, or by  [CONTACT_24701].  
 Diagnosis of an organ/space SSI by a surgeon or attending physician.  
Outcomes will be centrally adjudicated by [CONTACT_24702].  
Data will be recorded on case -report forms and directly entered via a web site into 
a secure REDCap database (i.e., with a tablet computer). All HIPAA rules will be followed; 
no identified data from remote sites will be entered into REDCap , and no Clinic data will 
be sent elsewhere.  We will request a copy of the anesthesia record, redacted for 
February 01, [ADDRESS_23989] redacted 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_24675].    
Statistical Plan  
Reported temperatures will include time -weighted average, minimum, and final 
intraoperative core temperatures.  
Analyses will be modified intent -to-treat, including all randomized patients who 
received treatment (i.e., patients randomized but not receiving treatment will not be 
included in any analyses). Randomized groups will be compared on baseline and 
demographic  characteristics using absolute standardized difference, defined as the 
absolute difference in means, mean ranks, or proportions divided by [CONTACT_24703]. All analyses will adjust for any imbalanced baseline characteristics between 
randomiz ed groups, defined as the maximum of 0.10 and absolute standardized 
difference > 1.96×√1
𝑛1+1
𝑛2.  
Missing outcomes will be imputed using an appropriate method, after examining 
the missing mechanism and drop -out rates.  If less than 5%  of data are missing , we will  
assign worst outcome to the active treatment group and best outcome to the control group 
for patients missing  all records of  MINS, non-fatal cardiac arrest  and mortality ; we will  
apply  the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method for patients missing 30 -day 
follow -up data but having discharge assessment.  If missing is 5~20%, we will use the 
multiple imputation method.  
Primary analysis   
      We will assess the effect of warming strategy on the binary -event  composite of 
myocardial injury, non -fatal cardiac arrest, and all -cause mortality within 30 days of 
surgery, using a multivariate generalized estimating equations (GEE) method.44,[ADDRESS_23990] of aggressive warming 
across the three categories of complications, using a GEE ‘distinct effects’ model with an 
unstructured working correlation matrix. This method is not driven by [CONTACT_24704] a lower p ower c ompared to common effects model  
because one complication has a lower  expected incidence. Regardless of the existence 
of the interaction, we will report the treatment effect of aggressive warming for each 
complication. The significance criterion will be 0.017 for each association (i.e., 0.05/3, 
Bonferroni).  
Secondary analyses  
February 01, [ADDRESS_23991] per -protocol 
analysis for primary outcome by [CONTACT_24705] . This analysis is 
expected to be biased in f avor of the preferred treatment and therefore no inference will 
be made about results.   
Exploratory analyses  
 Groups will be compared on estimated intraoperative blood loss ; the change in  
blood hemoglobin from preoperatively until  the first postoperative morning , adjusted for 
interim transfusions ; and quality -of-recovery [ADDRESS_23992] or multivariable logistic regression model.   
          Moreover, the association between the time -weighted intraoperative core 
temperature and the prima ry outcome will be assessed using a multivariable logistics 
regression model, adjusted for all potential confounders.  
We will use an overall alpha of 0.05 for each of the primary, secondary, and tertiary 
analyses. Specifically, the significance criterion i s 0.05 for primary analysis, 0.0125 for 
each secondary analysis (i.e., 0.05/4, Bonferroni ). Holm -Bonferroni correction will be 
used for the exploratory analysis . 
Sample -size Estimate  
Amongst 10,[ADDRESS_23993] -operatively were 10%, 0.1% and 1% respectively.46,[ADDRESS_23994] a 30% or more relative reduction in the primary outcomes, comparing routine 
February 01, [ADDRESS_23995] GEE model with unstructured covariance matrix, assuming a 
correlation of 0.1 between outcomes. We estimated sample size using the MULTBINPOW 
SAS macro [Mascha EJ Power Calculation for Tests on a Vector of Binary Outcomes], 
which can estimate the power for multivariate GEE model given varying correlation and 
sample size.  
After accounting for interim analysis at each 25% of the maximum enrollment 
(3 interim analyses and a final analysis, as needed), a maximum of 4802 patients would  
be needed (2401 per group) for the analysis .  
For the primary analysis, we will use a group sequential design with a nonbinding 
beta boundary, employing a gamma spending function with parameter gamma of -4 for 
efficacy and 0 for futility, thus spending be ta (for futility monitoring) considerably faster 
than alpha (for efficacy monitoring). Boundaries for efficacy (futility in parentheses) at the 
each interim and final analyses are P  ≤ 0.001  (P > 0.880 ), P ≤ 0.005  (P > 0.525 ), P ≤ 
0.014 (P >  0.169), and P ≤  0.044 (P  > 0.044 ), respectively , based on an anticipated 30% 
treatment effect . Figure  1 shows the z -statistic boundaries for efficacy and futility at each 
interim look.

In addition to  the planned 4 ,802 patients, we will enroll an additional 250 patients 
to accounting for an expected maximum 5% dropout rate (lost to follow -up and failure to 
receive any treatment). Therefore, we anticipate to enroll a maximum of 5,[ADDRESS_23998] interim analysis

be calculated from accruing data and pre -planned sample size. If the conditional power 
is within a promising zone from 0.[ADDRESS_23999] we would consider in the adaptive design 
is 15% reduction in the composite outcome. The effect size  from the accrued unblinding 
data will be used for planning adaptive design . The magnitude of the sample size increase 
will be determined by [CONTACT_24706] 0.9, subject to a cap of 
10,[ADDRESS_24000] , combining the results from all 
stages (pre and post adaptation) . If the adaptation is followed by a single stage  analysis, Effect  Expected  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_24679] [ADDRESS_24001] [Niklas Hack and Werner Brannath, 201 5] will 
be used for the analysis.   
 
     Decision s on an adaptive exte nsion of the trial will be done in conjunction with the 
statistician(s) and the study executive committee, and without unblinding site 
investigators as to the actual treatment effect observed on the intervention for which the 
extension is planned.  If, for product or budgetary reasons, sponsor participation is 
required in the adaptive decision -making, then a sponsor member may participate  in the 
study executive committee discussion of the adaptive design under the condition that 
specifics of interim results would not be shared with the rest of the sponsoring 
institution(s) or anyone outside of the deliberating group.  Trial results for an i ntervention 
for which there is an adaptive extension  will not be made public or published in any 
fashion until the adaptive portion of the study is also complete.  
 
 
Significance  
Hypothermia has been proposed as a cause of morbid myocardial outcomes. But 
whether very mild hypothermia (i.e.,  0.5°C) provokes myocardial complications has yet to 
be convincingly demonstrated because both existing stud ies are  seriously under -powered, 
with fragile results based on fewer than ten outcome events. The proposed large t rial will 
determine whether the results of the single existing under -powered trial are valid.  
Mild hypothermia remains common in nearly every country except the United 
States.  Unwarmed patients having major surgery typi[INVESTIGATOR_24680] 34.5°C.  Inadequately warmed surgical patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_24681] 
35.5°C at the end of surgery. Even in the [LOCATION_002], many surgical patients have final 
intraoperative core temperatures near 35.5°C.  More serious core hypothermia 
(i.e., 34.5°C) has been shown to provoke major complications, especially bleeding and 
surgical wound infections.  Whether aggressive warming to a truly normothermic 
temperature (e.g.,  37°C) is preferable to routine management remains unknown.   
Limitations  
Validi ty of the trial depends critically on achieving the target temperatures. There 
is little doubt that most unwarmed patients having major surgery will decrease to a core 
temperature near 35.5°C in a cool ambient environment . More challenging will be 
reaching  a core temperature between 37 and 37.5 °C by [CONTACT_24707]. Even with 
pre-warming, a high ambient temperature, and aggressive forced -air warming,  core 
temperatures in  some patients may not exceed 37°C  by [CONTACT_24707] . Realistically, 
we hope to h ave at least 1°C difference in final intraoperative core temperature across 
the study population. Smaller differences are unlikely to cause outcome differences and 
would cause the study to fail on technical grounds.  
February 01, [ADDRESS_24002] as a 
consequence. The primary outcome (a composite  of myocardial injury, non -fatal cardiac 
arrest, and all -cause mortality) is objective and unlikely to be influenced by [CONTACT_24708]. Most of the secondary outcomes are also objective  or unlikely to 
be influenced by [CONTACT_24709].   
 
Hum an Subjects  
Based on an early recommendation,51 a final core temperature of ≥36°C is widely 
considered “normothermic” and has been incorporated into  various guidelines. For 
example, the  Surgical Care Improvement Project  (recommendation #10) suggested  a 
final intraoperative temperature or 36°C and/or  use of active over-body warming whether 
or not core temperature reached 36°C.[ADDRESS_24003] for maintenance of core temperature. Perh aps 
as a consequence , many — but hardly all52 — surgical patients are actively  warmed in 
the [LOCATION_002]. Warming is relatively uncommon even in other western countries.29 In 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696], few patients are  actively warmed.  For example, a 2015  cross -
sectional survey of Beijing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24682] 11% of surgical patients were actively 
warmed , and that more than a third of all patients having operations lasting at least [ADDRESS_24004] shown that moderate hypothermia (≈34.5°C) causes complications relative to 
≈36.5°C. For example, mild perioperative hypothermia cause s surgical site infection,[ADDRESS_24005] documented  in many  individual studies and 
a meta -analysis .13 As little as 1°C hypothermia detectably increases surgical blood loss. 
But w hether smaller temperature differences matter is less obvious. The only study to 
ever demonstrate an outcome difference from just 0.5°C of hypothe rmia showed a slight 
increase in blood loss, with no significant difference in transfusion requirements.54 
Consequently , 0.5°C is widely  used as the non -inferiority “delta” in trials of warming 
systems55 and validations for clinical thermometers.56 Not a single outcome study has 
evaluated perioperative temperatures of 37°C or greater.   
There is thus  little evidence to support 36°C as the optimal  perioperative  target 
temperature . A slightly  lower temperature such as  35.5°C  may be equally safe, or a higher 
temperature might be better.  It would be well worth knowing  if 35.5°C is safe because  
that temperature can often be maintained  without the cost and effort of active warmin g 
— at least in patients having small operations in a warm operating room . In contrast, 
reliably warming patients to ≥37°C usually requires  30 minutes of  pre-warming , two 
intraoperative forced -air warming covers , and a fluid warmer . (Intraoperative core 
temperature using a single intraoperative forced -air cover, the conventional  approach,  
averages only 36°C .57) Thus while it is possible to warm most patients to ≥37°C, doing so 
February 01, [ADDRESS_24006], and difficulty of maintaining intraoperative core temperature 
≥37°C would be well worth  investing  if it reduced  major complications, especially 
myocardial injury. But whether it does currently  remains unknown . We pro pose to  
compare an inexpensive (or cost-free) approach  that might be equally safe with a more 
expensive approach that potentially disrupts clinical routine  but might reduce 
complications.  Because the outcome of the trial is impossible to predict, there is thus full 
equipoise between the two temperature management strategies that we will evaluate.           
Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be approached about participating by [CONTACT_3725] -

to allow the patient to participate in the informed consent proce ss to the extent that he/she

 24 PROTOCOL AMMENDMENT LOG : 
5/1/[ADDRESS_24014] protocol. Specifically, we need ed to get a preoperative troponin, but 
then only for two days afterwards. The preoperative troponin c ould be obtained 
any time before surgery, including in a preoperative assessment clinic or on the 
morning of surgery. As before, we'd like to know about any troponin measurements 
after the first two postoperative days, but measurements are not required after the 
first two days.   
9/26/2017 – Generation –four Troponin T, generation –five Troponin T or Troponin I will be 
used to screen for MINS depending upon site preference. Threshold values for 
generatio n-five Troponin T listed as absolute change ≥5ng/L or postoperative 
values ≥ 65ng/L will be used to diagnose MINS.  
10/12/2017 – “up to 2 weeks prior to day of surgery” added to page 9 paragraph 2. 
Troponin tests up  to 2 weeks prior to day of surgery will be considered as pre -
operative troponin.  
11/02 /2017 – Definition of MINS using generation five Troponin T was updated based on 
VISION 2 cohort study. A n increase of ≥[ADDRESS_24015] 20 ng/L would be 
considered as MINS and required evaluation with EKG, ECHO or Cardiac Consult.  
12/03/2017 – Page 10 paragraph 2 line 1-4: Diagnostic criteria for MINS based upon 
generation four Troponin T, generation five Troponin T and Troponin I was 
rephrased for clarity. Page 10 paragraph 2 line 5-6: either EKG, ECHO or Cardiac 
Consultation changed to EKG and EC HO with cardiac consultation.  
10/26/18 — Edward Mascha removed from the Executive Committee.  
11/4/18 — Inclusion criterion changed from “ peripheral vascular surgery” to “peripheral 
arterial surgery.”  Chi Cheung from Queen Ma ry hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24689].  
12/10/18 — Jens -Urlik Jensen substituted for Brian Ilfeld as Chair of the DSMB. [CONTACT_24713] 
declined  after better understanding the requirements.  
1/17/19 — Changed management from “ aggressive  warming  to a target final 
intraoperative core temperature ≥37°C” to “ aggressive  warming  to a target 
intraoperative core temperature ≥37°C.”  
5/27/2020 — “Bair Hugger and Bair Paws” changed to “forced -air” because 3M withdrew 
funding for the trial.  
10/29/2020 — Because the trial is enrolling quickly and well, the Executive Committee 
decided to skip the third interim and analysis. That is,  we plan  to complete the trial  
without an interval assessment with the goal of  shrinking  the confidence intervals 
around whatever  the findings might be. This decision was made without any 
access to by -group results.  
February 01, 2021  
 25 02/01/2021 --- The following was deleted Page 9, second Paragraph  
 
Myocardial injury after non -cardiac surgery will be defined as having a generation -four 
troponin T of ≥ 0.03 ng/ml, peak post -operative generation -five troponin T of ≥ 65ng/L, 
peak post -operative generation -five troponin T ≥ 20ng/L with change of ≥  5ng/L f rom 
baseline and values exceeding local 99th percentile for troponin I.  
 
The following was added P9  
 
 
Myocardial injury will be considered when a postoperative troponin concentration is 
elevated and believed to be consequent to myocardial ischemia. The thr esholds differ 
depending on the assay generation and type. We will use the following thresholds based 
on available literature:  
1. non-high-sensitivity (fourth -generation) troponin T ≥0.03 ng/ml;  
2. high-sensitivity troponin T ≥65 ng/L; or high-sensitivity tropo nin T 
20-64 ng/L and an increase ≥ 5 ng/L from baseline;  
3. high-sensitivity troponin  I (Abbott assay) is ≥75  ng/L44; 
4. high-sensitivity troponin I (Siemens assay) is ≥60  ng/L (Borges, 
unpublished);  
5. troponin I (other assays) is at least twice local 99th percentiles;  
6. an increase of at least 20% in patients who have preoperative  high-
sensitivity troponin concentrations that exceed 80% of the relevant 
thresholds in items [ADDRESS_24016] be a 20% rise beyond 
the chronic troponin value or beyond the last measurement of the acute preoperative 
myocardial injury that was clearl y demonstrated to have peaked and was coming down.

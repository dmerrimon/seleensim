 Introduction  and Study Rationale  
 
6.0 Overview  and Schema  
 
There is great need for more accurate staging of extraprostatic disease at the time of initial diagnosis  to 
guide therapy and thereby [CONTACT_613641] . 
We propose to develop an optimized simultaneous PET/MRI protocol for local, regional and whole body 
pre-therapeutic initial staging of locally metastat ic prostate cancer in a single imaging session using the 
amino acid PET tracer, [68Ga]PSMA -11. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_472518], the pretreatment staging of men with prostate carcinoma (PCa ) is currently problematic. 
Conventional imaging is falsely negative for regional lymph node metastases in a substantial fraction of 
men. To address this unmet need, we will determine utility of positron emission tomography (PET) using 
68Ga-labeled PSMA -11 combined with simultaneous PET/MRI (PSMA -PET/MRI) in men with 
oligometastatic prostate cancer to detect regional metastases and plan radiation therapy to boost dose 
to lymph node metastases not identified with CT and/or MRI alone. 
Although not the aim of the current study, this could lead to a 
larger study to evaluate efficacy and outcomes in men undergoing 
PSMA -PET/MRI based radiotherapy planning when compared to 
standard -of-care pelvic radiotherapy. We will compare MRI alone 
to simultaneous PSMA -PET/MRI in terms of lesion detection in 
pelvic nodal stations.  Subsequently, patient -specific radiation 
therapy plans will be developed utilizing the results of the PSMA -
PET/MRI and additional radiation will be delivered to suspi[INVESTIGATOR_613625]. If this preliminary study suggests a benefit of PSMA -
PET/MRI in the pretreatment setting, additional larger studies will 
be designed based  on these results.  
 
This clinical feasibility study will investigate the use of PSMA -
PET/MRI to guide radiation treatment planning and delivery in 
patients with known or suspected locally metastatic prostate 
cancer at the time of diagnosis. The patients wi ll undergo a single 
PSMA -PET/MRI (or PET/CT in some circumstances) prior to 
initiation of treatment. Following development of a PSMA -PET 
guided radiation treatment plan, therapeutic radiation will be 
delivered  per standard -of-care parameters  and assessment s of feasibility and tolerability will be 
performed. A total of 10 patients will be enrolled in this study.  If the PET/MRI demonstrates a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_613626] a patient ineligible for radiation therapy, the treating clinician (including urology  
and radiation oncology) will be alerted, and the decision to pursue biopsy and/or alter the patient ’s 
treatment plan will be based on standard of care imaging and consensus after presenting the case at the 
GU tumor board.

 in males in the [LOCATION_002] with over 3 mil lion men currently living with prostate cancer in the United 
States.[1] There is a substantial minority of patients with high -risk prostate adenocarcinoma that are at 
significant risk for regional nodal and distant metastases at the time of diagnosis.  In contrast to localized 
disease, the 5 -year survival for patients with distant metastatic disease is 29%.  
 
There is great need for more accurate staging of extraprostatic disease at the time of initial diagnosis to 
guide therapy and thereby [CONTACT_613642]. 
To address this unmet need, we will determine utility of positron emission tomography (PET) using 68Ga -
labeled PSMA -11 combined with simultaneous PET/MRI (PSMA -PET/MRI) in men with oligometastatic 
prostate cancer to detect regional metastases and plan radiation therapy to boost dose to lymph node 
metastases not identified with CT and/or MRI alone. Although not the aim of the current study, this could 
lead to a larger study to evaluate efficacy and o utcomes in men undergoing PSMA -PET/MRI based 
radiotherapy planning when compared to standard -of-care pelvic radiotherapy.  
 
The utility of conventional anatomic imaging for staging is limited. Disease control outcomes for men with 
high -risk prostate cancer remain suboptimal, with 10 -year biochemical failure rates on the order of 25% -
40% in modern trials of dose -escalated radiotherapy and long -term androgen suppression.[2, 3] 
Additionally, the 5 -year disease -free survival rate drops from 85% of patients with no nodal metastases 
to 50% in those patients with nodal metastases. This is thought to be due to lack of detection of small 
volume metastatic disease and small volume locoregionally invasive disease not identified on 
conventional pretreatment imaging.  
 
Prostate MRI is essential for cancer staging within the gland, but limited in detection of nodal metastases. 
While prostate MRI is valuable for the staging of the known cancer, its sensitivity and specificity for the 
detection of pelvic lymph node metastases  is limited by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 criteria and nodal morphology. 
Molecular imaging has great potential to supplement MRI and increase diagnostic accuracy, and 
simultaneous PET/MRI can provide both dedicated pelvic PET and MRI imaging for regional staging as well 
as whole body staging in a single imaging session.  
 
PSMA PET ligands show great promise for detection of both intraprostatic and extraprostatic disease. 
Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane cellular receptor that is overexpressed 
in prostate cancer cells. Recently, small molecules have been developed that bind to the extracellular 
component of the transmembrane PSMA receptor. These agents have been tagged with both 18F and 68Ga 
for imaging and 90Y and 177Lu for therapeutic purposes. Restaging accuracy of fluciclovine and PSMA -
PET/CT are superior to choline compounds, particularly at low PSA levels, and a single 10 patient case 
series suggests superiority of PSMA PET over fluciclovine.[4, 5]  A limitation of PSMA ligands is that 
approx imately 10% of prostate carcinoma and nodal metastases are PSMA negative.1-4  
 
PET imaging has be en shown to alter radiation treatment planning in patients with recurrent prostate 
cancer. The concept of PET guided radiation therapy is well -established and utilizes standardized uptake 
values (SUV) within lesions to automatically segment target volumes. [6-8] The technique has been 
evaluated previously in recurrent prostate cancer with use of [11C]choline and [18F]fluorocholine PET/CT 
with increases in detected gross tumor volume.[9, 10] PSMA -PET/CT has been demonstrated to be 
superior to [11C]choline PET /CT in recurrent prostate cancer in both sensitivity and specificity and has 
been shown to alter radiation therapy management in a substantial fraction of patients.[11 -14] Therefore, 
we expect that PSMA -PET/MRI will be valuable in the initial staging and r adiation treatment planning in 
patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer and that target lesion segmentation is feasible utilizing SUV 
thresholding.

PET/MRI is likely the optimal modality to image patients for pretreatment staging of prostate carcinom a. 
In one study, a patient can undergo a multiparametric prostate MRI for characterization of the primary 
lesion and the extent of regional extraprostatic disease along with a molecular imaging study to improve 
the accuracy of regional staging and provide whole body staging. In addition, simultaneous acquisition of 
PET and MRI data allows for more accurate coregistration of MRI and PET data which may be difficult to 
achieve with software fusion, a key to detecting non -enlarged lymph nodes and other small le sions.  
 
6.2 Study Objectives  
 
Specific Aim #1:  Determine the concordance of imaging findings for PSMA -PET/MRI and MRI of the pelvis 
and prostate gland.  
 
Hypothesis #1: PSMA -PET/MRI will identify more region al lymph node metastases than MRI alone.  
 
There have been numerous prior studi es demonstrating the value of MRI for the locoregional staging for 
PCa. We expect the simultaneous acquisition of MRI and PSMA  PET data to provide valuable preoperative 
staging information, with PSMA  PET detecting metastatic diseas e in subcentimeter pelvic lymph nodes 
not id entified with MRI alone. Additionally, PSMA -PET/MRI provides whole body stagin g in regions not 
evaluated by [CONTACT_613643].  
 
Specific Aim #2: Establish feasibility and ass ess acute toxicity of PSMA -PET/MRI directed pelvic 
radiotherapy . 
 
Hypothesis #2: PSMA -PET/MRI directed radiation therapy will be feasible in the vast majority of patients 
(>90%) and can be safely administered without increased acute radiation toxicities.  
 
The primary goal of Specific Aim 2 is to provide preliminary information to confirm the feasibility of 
radiation dose escalation to the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_613627] -PET/MRI. If results from this trial are 
supportive, this will lead to a larger clinic al trial evaluating efficacy and disease outcomes between 
patients who have undergone PSMA -PET/MRI directed radiotherapy versus standard -of-care pelvic 
radiotherapy.  
 
6.3 Investigational Plan  
 
6.3.1 Study Design  
 Prospective IRB -approved study enrolling 10 patients with locally metastatic  prostate cancer for 
pretreatment PSMA -PET/MRI prior to the initiation of treatment  
 All patients will undergo standard -of-care clinical evaluation and imaging workup with nuclear 
medicine bone scan and either CT of the abdo men and pelvis or MRI pelvis  
 Patients will undergo standard -of-care androgen deprivation therapy following PSMA -PET/MRI 
and prior to radiation therapy  
 If study PET/MRI demonstrates a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_472520] a patient radiation 
therapy , the treatment team will be alerted to potentially investigate the finding further (i.e. 
additional imaging or biopsy)  
 Acute radiation toxicities will be assessed at standard -of-care intervals  
 
Page 6 of 21 
Version 04/15/2021  
 6.3.2 Study Population  
 Men with treatment -naïve prostate cancer with metastatic disease localized to the pelvis  
 
6.3.3 Inclusion Criteria  
 Biopsy -proven treatment -naïve prostate adenocarcinoma with pelvic metastases known to 
suspected on standard -of-care staging imaging  or a nomogram -based risk of lymph node 
metastases greater tha n or equal to 20%  
 Eligibility and plan to undergo definitive radiation therapy for prostate cancer per established 
standard -of-care radiation oncology clinical guidelines  
 Be at least 18 years of age.  
 
6.3.4 Exclusion Criteria  
 Inability to tolerate or undergo PET /MRI  or PET/CT  
 Previous or current hematologic or lymphatic disorder (including leukemia, lymphoma, 
Castleman’s disease, etc.)  
 Recurrent prostate adenocarcinoma  
 Known distant metastatic disease  
 Current or prior treatment for prostate cancer  
 
6.3.5 Withdrawal Criteria  
 Given that enrollment in this study will involve a single  imaging exam, no withdrawal criteria will 
be used  
 
6.3.6 Replacement of Patients  
 Given that enrollment in this study will involve a single  imaging exam, no replacement of 
patients will be used  
 
6.3.7 Study Duration  
 Study enrollment and imaging will take place over 24 months  
 
6.3.8 Safety Monitoring  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
Patients will be informed of the extent to which their confidential health information generated 
from this study may be used for research purposes. Following this discussion, they will be asked 
to sign the HIPAA form and informed consent documents. The ori ginal signed document will 
become part of the patient’s medical records, and each patient will receive a copy of the signed 
document. The use and disclosure of protected health information will be limited to the 
individuals described in the informed consen t document. PET/MRI scans will be loaded into a 
separate password -protected image storage system that will not appear on the PACS utilized in 
clinical practice.  
 
6.3.9 Ethical Considerations  
 
Given that the study involves a single  imaging session with PET/MRI a nd the expected age of the 
enrolled adult patients, ethical concerns regarding additional radiation exposure are minimal. 
Page 7 of 21 
Version 04/15/2021  
 The only ethical consideration was the availability of the results of the study PET/MRI to the 
clinicians. Although  the PET radiopharm aceutical used ( [68Ga]PSMA -11) is not currently FDA-
approved , it has been extensively studied and used in Europe with excellent correlation 
between radiotracer activity and metastatic disease . Therefore, a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_613628]/MRI is expected to correlate with metastatic disease. Therefore, if the PET/MRI 
demonstrates a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_98868], the treating clinician (including urology and radiation 
oncology) will be alerted, and the decision to pursue biopsy and/or alter the patients treatment 
plan will be based on standard of care imaging and consensus after presenting the case at the 
GU tumor board.   
 
6.[ADDRESS_813747].  
 
6.4.3 Initiation of Study  
The PET tracer [68Ga]PSMA -[ADDRESS_813748] . [68Ga]PSMA -11 is an investigational new drug (IND) and the study will be initiated 
only after approval of UAB Radiation Safety  Committee , UAB IRB and FDA.  
 
6.4.4 Drug Information  
[68Ga]PSMA -11 is an investigational  PET radiopharmaceutical that has been used extensively in 
clinical trials for  patients with newly diagnosed and biochemically recurrent  prostate cancer. The  
radiopharmaceutical  targets the PSMA transmembrane protein, which is over expressed  in prostate 
cancer cells. The target dosage of radiopharmaceutical  administered to the patient is  185 MBq ( 5 
mCi) ±10% given intravenously. This result s in an effective dose of approximately 3  mSv  to the 
patient, which is equal to 1 years of natural background radiation exposure  (3 mSv/yr ).  
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_813749] -
of-care procedures per the treating physician (urology, radiation oncology, etc.). For initial staging of 
prostate cancer, this will include a nuclear med icine bone scan and either a CT abdomen and pelvis 
or MRI of the pelvis per NCCN guidelines. If a patient is determined  to be eligible for the  study , the 
research coordinator in this study will be asked to come to the clinic to discuss potential enrollment  
in the study.

 6.4.6 Imaging Information  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  [68Ga]PSMA -11 PET Preparation and Injection  
The injected dose of PSMA will be 185 MBq ( 5 mCi)  followed by [CONTACT_613644] 50 -100 
minutes .5 The patient will be instructed to avoid strenuous exercise for 24 hours prior t o 
injection and to avoid caloric intake for 4 hours prior to injection.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  [68Ga]PSMA -11 PET/MRI  and PET/CT Protocol  
 
Whole body imaging  
Positron Emission Tomography Acquisition: The patient will be placed on the PET/MRI scanner 
in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. Initial localizer images will be obtained. Subsequently, static whole body 
images will be acquired from pelvis to skull base utilizing approximately eight 14 cm detector beds 
for 5 m inute acquisitions per bed position. Correction for randoms, scatter, attenuation and 
reconstructions will be performed per the manufacturer’s recommendations.  
 
Whole Body MRI: Sequences performed will include MR attenuation correction (MRAC), axial and 
coronal T2 single shot fast spin echo, sagittal T1 turbo spin echo for skeletal evaluation, and whole 
body Dixon -derived sequences.  
 
Following whole body PET imaging, a routine noncontrast MRI of the prostate gland will be 
performed at UAB in the PET/MRI sc anner per institutional protocol, which includes high b -value 
diffusion -weighted imaging (b2000)  and small field -of-view T2 imaging . Dynamic -contrast 
enhanced and post -contrast T1 images will be omitted from the protocol to reduce scan time and 
due to less  impact on scan interpretation for patients presenting for staging of known prostate 
cancer . An additional static pelvic PET acquisition will be performed concurrently.  
 
PET/CT Acquisition:  If a patient is unable to undergo PET/MRI secondary to technical failure of 
the PET/MRI scanner, MRI -incompatible metallic implant, or severe claustrophobia, a PET/CT 
may be performed instead at the Primary Investigator’s discretion. The patient will be p laced on 
the PET/CT scanner in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. Initial localizer images will be obtained. 
Subsequently, static whole body images will be acquired from pelvis to skull base utilizing 
approximately eight 14 cm detector beds for 5 minute acquisitions per  bed position. Correction 
for randoms, scatter, attenuation and reconstructions will be performed per the manufacturer’s 
recommendations.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  PET/MRI Imaging Interpretation and Storage  
Images from the PET/MRI will be  stored and  reviewed using a commercially a vailable software 
package ( MIM Encore, Cleveland, OH) and not be available for viewing in the institutional PACS 
or patient’s medical record. This is in an effort to blind the treating physicians from making 
clinical decisions on an experimental imaging te chnique. The prostate MRI images will be sent to 
clinical PACS and the medical record as part of standard -of-care imaging and can be used in the 
clinical -decision making process. No formal interpretation will be generated for the  [68Ga]PSMA -
PET portion of the PET/ MRI study , but the prostate MRI will have a clinical interpretation by a 
dedicated abdominal radiologist who will also be blinded to the patient enrollment in the study. 
Dedicated study readers from both abdominal imaging and molecular imaging will  interpret first 
the prostate MRI alone, and then the fused PET/MRI to assess potential added value from the 
PET/MRI. The study readers will be blinded to the results of any additional standard -of-care 
Page 9 of 21 
Version 04/15/[ADDRESS_813750] kno wledge that the patient has biopsy -proven 
prostate cancer.  
 
Assessment of the prostate MR primary lesion location, extracapsular extension (ECE), seminal 
vesicle invasion (SVI), and metastatic disease will be evaluated utilizing a Likert scale from 1 -5 to 
indicate reader confidence utilizing PI -RADS v2.0 criteria. The PSMA -PET/MRI will be evaluated 
with the same 1 -5 Likert scale utilizing the PSMA -RADS v1.0 criteria.[16]  The number of pelvic 
nodal metastases detected at each lymph node station will be recorded. Exams will be interpreted 
by [CONTACT_408505]/nuclea r medicine physicians to evaluate interreader agreement with 
disputes resolved by [CONTACT_21128].  
 
MRI Data Analysis: The MRI images will be qualitatively analyzed.  
 
Qualitative analysis:  A visual evaluation of the pelvic lymph nodes with suspected metastatic 
disease will be performed. The number of positive metastatic lymph nodes and their nodal 
stations will be recorded. Nodal stations that will be examined include right and left common iliac, 
internal iliac, external iliac, obturator, inguinal, and retroperitoneal (total of 11 stations per 
patients).  
 
MRI Images  
1 = Normal lymph nodes  
2 = Mild prominence not meeting RECIST criteria for adenopathy (low suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798])  
3 = Borderline enlarged b y RECIST criteria (intermediate suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798])  
4 = Definitely abnormal size or morphology, probable  metastasis ( high  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798])  
5 = Markedly abnormal size and morphology, definite  metastasis ( very high  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798])  
 
Note: In cases of nonhomogenous intensity on MRI images, the grade will be determined on the 
basis of the most suspi[INVESTIGATOR_134425].  
 
PET Data Analysis:  The PET images will be qualitatively and quantitatively assessed. The scoring 
will be based primarily on the PET data, but the reader will have access to  the MRI data for 
anatomic correlation and characterization of lymph node morphology. For PET data analysis, a 
lymph node positive based on MRI criteria but negative based on PSMA -PET criteria will be scored 
as negative.  
 
Qualitative analysis:  A visual eva luation of the pelvic lymph nodes with suspected metastatic 
disease will be performed  utilizing PSMA -RADS version 1.0 criteria (Table 1). The number of 
positive metastatic lymph nodes and their nodal stations will be recorded.  
 
Quantitative analysis:  Nodes scored as intermediate or higher suspi[INVESTIGATOR_613629]/or 
PET will undergo further quantitative analysis.  
 
Standardized uptake values (SUVs):  The maximum SUV will be measured. Additionally, the 
mean SUV and metabolic tumor volume will be measu red based on a 40% isocontour.

 6.4.7 Safety Monitoring  
Vital signs will be assessed immediately before and after injection of [68Ga] PSMA -11 (HR and supi[INVESTIGATOR_613636]).  Patients will be monitored for adverse events during injection and after completion of the 
imaging study . Additionally, patient’s vitals (HR and supi[INVESTIGATOR_30991]) will be checked at the completion of 
the imaging study prior to leaving the im aging center.  
 
6.4.8 Patient Follow -Up 
Patients will be called within 24 hours of [68Ga]PSMA -[ADDRESS_813751] simulation for radiotherapy planning will be performed within 8 weeks of the initiation of 
neoadjuvant androgen suppression (per standard -of-care clinical guidelines) and within [ADDRESS_813752] scan will extend from the L1/L2 to mid -femur and will 
utilize ≤3mm slice thickness. Intravenous iohexol contrast will be utilized to improve visualization of 
lymph nodes.  All CT simulation parameters and patient preparation is per standard -of-care  clinical 
guidelines.  
 
6.5.2 RADIOTHERAPY TARGET VOLUME DELINEATION (Figure 1)  
 
Varian Eclipse software (Varian Medical Systems LLC, Palo Alto, CA, [LOCATION_003]) will be used for radiotherapy 
target delineation and treatment planning. For all patients we will initi ally define traditional standard -
of-care clinical target volumes for the treatment of high risk prostate cancer:  
 
CTV P+SV will contain the entire prostate gland and portion of the seminal vesicles at risk for tumor 
involvement. At least the proximal 1cm of  the seminal vesicles. In cases where gross seminal vesicle 
invasion is identified the entire seminal vesicles will be included.  
CTV eLN will contain the elective lymph node target volumes. Elective nodal regions will be delineated 
in accordance with publis hed consensus guidelines7 and will include the obturator, internal iliac, 
external iliac, and distal common iliac chains.  
Page 12 of 21 
Version 04/15/[ADDRESS_813753] scan. Rigid co -
registration is preferred for two specific reasons: (1) we recognize that 8 -10 week s of androgen 
suppression between PSMA -PET/MRI and radiotherapy simulation may lead to in changes in LN size 
that may lead to error in deformable registration, and (2) prior experience with PSMA -PET/MRI co -
registration in the biochemical recurrence setting  indicates that rigid co -registration results in good 
anatomic agreement in the majority of cases8. Using the registered PSMA -PET/MRI we will delineate 
an additional CTV:  
 
CTV LN BOOST  will contain LNs with m aximum SUV greater than 1.3 times the blood pool reference. The 
LNs will be segmented on the MRI portion of the PSMA -PET/MRI and superimposed on the co -
registered CT simulation scan. The resulting structure will be edited to create CTV LN BOOST by [CONTACT_613647] (e.g. muscle or bone). We note that suspi[INVESTIGATOR_613637], but CTV LN 
BOOST will not be further reduced so as to account  for potential microscopic tumor extension. This 
concept is analogous to involved node radiotherapy utilized for post -chemotherapy consolidation of 
lymphoma9.  
 
Planning target volume (PTV) expansions for CTV P+SV will be 4mm posteriorly and 7mm in all other 
direct ions. PTV expansions for CTV eLN and CTV LN BOOST  will be 8mm in all directions.

6.5.4  RADIOTHERAPY ASSESSMENTS  
 
Clinical toxicity during and after radiation therapy will be scored using the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0). Response to therapy will be assessed with 
interval PSA measurement. All of these measures will be assesse d per standard -of-care intervals for 
all patients undergoing radiation therapy for prostate cancer. We will utilize a batter y of validated 
measures:

6.5.5  Study Variables and Key Endpoints  
For specific aim 1, we will assess the concordance between prostate MRI and PSMA -PET/MRI for the 
detection of seminal vesicle invasion and pelvic metastatic disease. The total number of pelvic nodal 
metastases detected on MRI and PSMA -PET/MRI will be compa red. The confidence in detection of 
seminal vesicle invasion on a 0-3 Likert scale will also be compared between MRI and PSMA -PET/MRI. 
The primary endpoint for specific aim [ADDRESS_813760] metastases 
on PSMA -PET/MRI that were  not detected on conventional anatomic imaging. We expect at least 25% 
of patients to demonstrate pelvic LN metastases that were not detected on conventional anatomic 
imaging.  
 
For specific aim 2, study participants who remain eligible for pelvic radiation  therapy (e.g. no distant 
metastases) will be subdivided into two cohorts: those without suspi[INVESTIGATOR_613638] -PET/MRI and those whose PSMA -PET/MRI demonstrates suspected seminal vesicle invasion 
and/or pelvic nodal metastatic disease.  Those without suspi[INVESTIGATOR_613639] -of-care radiation therapy. Patients with positive PSMA -PET/MRI scans will undergo radiation 
treatment planning with a boost given to the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_148352]. The primary endpoint of speci fic aim 
2 is to assess the number of patients with positive PSMA -PET/MRI scans where the radiation boost is 
feasible. We expect that the radiation treatment planning will be feasible in at least 90% of patients 
with positive PSMA -PET/MRI scans. A secondary  endpoint is to compare the frequency of acute 
radiation toxicities between the cohorts. We expect that less than 15% of patients who undergo 
PSMA -PET/MRI directed LN radiotherapy boost will experience CTCAE v5.0 grade 3+ genitourinary or 
gastrointestinal toxicities and that no patient will experience a grade 5 genitourinary or 
gastrointestinal toxicity. All grade 3 toxicities will be reviewed by [CONTACT_613649] -
investigator.  If any grade 4 or 5 events occur, the cases will be reviewed among mem bers of the study 
team and the study will potentially be paused/terminated if there is concern that deviation from 
standard of care radiation therapy has caused undue harm to the patient.  
 
6.5.6  Study Termination  
The study will stop enrolling patients once  the target number has been reached.

For the primary analysis in Aim 1, the number of patients who are identified with lymph node 
meta stases (positive nodal) will be counted, and percentage and 95% exact confidence interval will 
be calculated using the Clopper -Pearson method for PSMA -PET/MRI and MRI respectively. 
Concordance and agreement between two methods will be evaluated using Cohen 's kappa statistic,

PSMA -PET/MRI and MRI will be determined using the Bland -Altman plot analysis in addition to 
descriptive analysis. Safety analysis of acute  radiation toxicities related AE/SAE in Aim [ADDRESS_813762] their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki as stated in 21 CFR §312.120(c)(4); consistent with GCP and all applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
Before initiating this trial, the Investigator will have written and dated approval from the Institutional 
Review Board for the protocol, written informed consent form, subject recruitment mat erials, and any 
other written information to be provided to subjects before any protocol related procedures are 
performed on any subjects.   
 
The clinical investigation will not begin until either FDA has determined that the study under the 
Investigational  Drug Application (IND) is allowed to proceed or the Investigator has received a letter 
from FDA stating that the study is exempt from IND requirements.  
6.7.[ADDRESS_813763] Approval  
The protocol, the proposed informed consent form, and all forms of participant information related 
to the study (e.g. advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_613650]. Prior to obtaining IRB approval, the protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_613651] (PRC).  The initial protocol and all 
protocol amendments must be approved by [CONTACT_14226].

Version 04/15/[ADDRESS_813765] then notify the IRB in writing within five (5) working days after implementation.   
6.8 Adverse Event Reporting  
As with many IV administered agents, [68Ga]PSMA -11 could cause an allergic reaction that could 
potentially pose a threat to life (anaphylaxis).  This has not been observed in limited human exposure to 
date.  Reasonable precautions should be taken, consiste nt with normal radiologic and clinical facility 
practice.  The patient should be monitored until the PET procedure is completed, and trained personnel 
and emergency equipment should be available per facility standards.  
 
Qualifying Adverse Events (AEs), inc luding Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), as defined herein, will be 
reported via the FDA Adverse Event Expedited Reporting System (AERS). For the [68Ga]PSMA  IND we will 
report adverse events based on the FDA final rule for IND safety reporting requirements under 21 CFR 
part 312 published on September 29, 2010 and implemented on March 28, 2011.  This investigational 
study is not a BA or BE study so 21 CFR part 320 is not applicable.  Adverse events will also be reported 
to the UAB IRB according to their requi rements . 
 
6.8.1 General Definitions (from 21 CFR 312.32 (a))  
Adverse Event (AE): An Adverse Event is an untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of 
the drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. For this study, the drug is [68Ga]PSMA  
and adverse events would include any events experienced by a study participant during the Adverse 
Event rep orting period defined in Table 1  whether or not it was considered to be related to the 
[68Ga]PSMA .   At the conclusion of the imaging study, the imaging technologist will observe the 
patient and also inquire if they are back to their usual state of health.  If a negative answer is 
received, then the physician will be called to investigate this report as a possible adverse reaction.  
 
Adverse Reaction:  An A dverse Reaction is any adverse event caused by a drug. In this study, the 
drug is [68Ga]PSMA . 
 
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the IND drug caused the adverse event.  For the purposes of I ND safety reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which m eans any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an 
investiga tor brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application.  
 
Page 17 of 21 
Version 04/15/2021  
 An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the  view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening adverse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include: 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treat ment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if,  in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused d eath.  
 
Investigational Agent:  An investigational agent is any agent held under an Investigational New Drug 
(IND) application.  For purposes of this study, [68Ga]PSMA  is the investigational agent.  
 
6.8.2 AE Reporting Requirements  
The investigators on this protoc ol will report any suspected adverse events that occur after 
[68Ga]PSMA  administration and within the specified follow -up period to [CONTACT_472550] and they will 
work together to determine whether there was an adverse event or adverse reaction and the 
severity  of the adverse event or reaction.  
 
All AEs will be followed by [CONTACT_613652], stabilization, scientifically and clinically 
satisfactory explanation as to attribution and etiology is achieved, or until subject is lost to follow 
up.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CAEPR/ASAE for [68Ga]PSMA  
The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764]. The Agent Spe cific Adverse Event List (ASAEL) would 
include the expected adverse events associated with the use of [68Ga]PSMA . At this time, there 
have rare reported AEs associated with the use of a [68Ga]PSMA  in clinical studies (≤1% of 
patients) . The most common adve rse reactions were injection site pain  and injection site 
erythema.  We will continue to update our CAEPR and ASAE lists as this study progresses, 
including by [CONTACT_472544] -house data safety monitoring.  If any are found, 
we will begin an ASAE list.  Any information on reported AEs for [68Ga]PSMA  will be provided by 
[CONTACT_472545].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Potential but Unexpected AE for [68Ga]PSMA  
There have rare reported AEs associated with the use of a [68Ga]PSMA in clinical studies (≤1% of 
patients). The most common adverse react ions were injection site pain  and injection site 
erythema.   
 
Other general risks for PET/MRI imaging include:  
Page 18 of 21 
Version 04/15/2021  
  The injection site may become infected.  
 The dose might be extravasated into tissues surrounding the vein catheter leading to localized 
pain/discomfort.  
 
Radiation risks: [68Ga]PSMA injection contributes to lifetime radiation accumulation.  The 
smallest dosage for imaging and safe handling are used for these protocols. The organ and total 
body doses associated with [68Ga]PSMA imaging are c omparable to those associated with other 
widely used clinical nuclear medicine procedures.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Review of Safety Information  
As required by 21 CFR 312.32(b), the physician investigators will promptly review all information 
relevant to the safety of the drug. T he physician investigators will also be providing much of this 
information to the local IRB as well for data safety and review monitoring.  The review will 
include determining whether there is a safety event over time and the causality.  Reporting  will 
be as described in Table 4 . 
 
Characterization of the severity of an Adverse Event:  Adverse events will be graded as below.  
 
Grade:  Grade denotes the severity of the AE.  An AE is graded using the following categories:  
 Mild  
 Moderate  
 Severe  
 Life-threatening or disabling  
 Fatal  
 
NOTE:  Severity is graded on the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) based scale for each adverse event. For 
example, an abnormal hemoglobin value is graded for severity from 1  to 5 [death] based upon 
where that value falls on the CTCAE scale of abnormal hemoglobin values.  “Severity” is NOT the 
same as “Seriousness.” All appropriate clinical areas should have access to a copy of the most 
current CTCAE and a copy of the CTCAE ca n be downloaded from ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
Attribution of cause: The physician investigators will determine whether an adverse event was 
related to a medical treatment or procedure.  Definitions taken from our work with CTEP and 
NIH give the following definitions for “Attribution” that we will adopt for this IND study:  
Attribution is a clinical determination, by [CONTACT_093], as to whether an AE is related to a 
medical treatment or procedure.  Attribution c ategories are:  
 Definite:     The AE is clearly related to a treatment or procedure   
 Probable:   The AE is likely related to a treatment or procedure  
 Possible:    The AE may be related to a treatment or procedure  
 Unlikely:     The AE is likely unrelated to a treatment or procedure  
 Unrelated:  The AE is clearly not related to a treatment or procedure  
 NOTE:  Attribution is part of the assessment of an adverse event.  Determining that an event is 
‘unlikely related’ or ‘unrelated’ to a study agent or procedure d oes NOT make the event 
unreportable, or disqualify the event as an AE.  As defined above, an AE is reportable as 
specified herein if it occurred:  “during the Adverse Event reporting period defined in the 
protocol , or by [CONTACT_472546], regulation, or policy.”

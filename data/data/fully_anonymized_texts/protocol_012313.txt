TITLE  68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT  for detection of recurrent prostate cancer 
after initial therapy in patients with elevated PSA  
STUDY PHASE  Phase 2-[ADDRESS_1260285]  68Ga-PSMA -11;  also known as:  
• DFKZ -11 
• HBED -CC PSMA  
• The “Heidelberg  compound ” 
PRIMA RY OBJECTIVE  To evaluate 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT  for detection of recurrent 
prostate cancer after initial therapy in patients with elevated PSA  
SAMPLE SIZE  [ADDRESS_1260286] 30% of t hese patients will have one or more lesions 
detected on 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT . 
2. 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT  will have sensitivity and specificity of at 
least 70% in this context.  
STATISTICAL TEST  
We will calculate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for:  
1. Percentage of patients who had true lesions.  
2. Sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT . 
STATISTICAL POWER AND SAMPLE SIZE  
We expect to recruit 200  patients over the course of this trial.   The 
number of lesions cannot be predicted at this tim e, however,  if our 
expectation of a 30% discovery rate is correct, the resulting 
confidence interval would be roughly +/ - 7 percentage points, and 
confidence intervals for specificity/sensitivity would be roughly

Specific Aim  
To evaluate 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT  for detection of recurrent prostate cancer after initial 
therapy in patients with elevated SA.  
2. BACKGROUND  
2.[ADDRESS_1260289] mortality (after lung) wi th 27,540 
estimated deaths (1).  Subsequent treatment is multifaceted and may involve observation, 
surgery (prostatectomy), radiation therapy (external beam or brachytherapy), hormonal 
therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these (2-4).   
Up to 40% of the patients with prostate cancer develop biochemical recurrence within 10 
years after initial treatment (5).  Usually an increase of the PSA -level precedes a clinically 
detectable recurrence by [CONTACT_30770] (6).  However, it cannot differentiate between 
local, regional or systemic disease with the necessary precision that is essential for further 
disease management (7).   
Morphological imaging methods exhibit considerable limitations :  sensitivity ranges between 
25% and 54% for the detection of local recurrence by [CONTACT_590174] (TRUS) or 
contrast -enhanced CT and is moderately improv ed by [CONTACT_667809] (7-9).  
The sensitivity for detection of lymph node metastases of CT or MRI is reported to be 
30-80% (10).  Ultra -small particles of iron oxides (USPI[INVESTIGATOR_580185]) proved to be very effective, but 
are yet to be approved by [CONTACT_12721] (11).  Bone metastases presenting as 
osteoblastic lesions can be effectively detected by [CONTACT_667810], PET, CT and MRI (12, 
13). 
Various targets have been addressed by [CONTACT_899058] .  PET tracers such as 18F- or 11C-labeled choline and 11C-acetate 
have been investigated for the diagnosis of recurrent (14-16) prostate cancer .  Their 
feasibility in primary diagnosis is limited be cause of uptake in benign tissue such as benign 
prostatic hyperplasia or inflammatory lymph nodes (9, 17).  In addition, fluorinated versions 
are not available in the [LOCATION_002], while 11C-labeled tracers cannot be widely used due 
to the requirement for an on -site cyclotron due to the short half -life.  18F-FACBC, a new 
synthetic amino acid, might be superior when  compared to 11C-choline PET/CT (18).   
However, recent work indicates that 18F-FACBC uptake in prostate cancer is similar to that 
in BPH nodules (19).  Prostate -specific membrane antigen (PSMA) continues to elicit high 
interest .  This cell surface protein is significantly overexpressed in prostate cancer cells 
when compared  to other PSMA -expressing tissues such as kidney, proximal small intestine 
or salivary glands .  It therefore provides a promising target for prostate cancer -specific 
imaging .  Recently methods have been developed to label PSMA ligands with 68Ga and 18F.  
Initial experience suggests that these novel tracers can detect prostate cancer relapses and 
IRB-[ADDRESS_1260290] by [CONTACT_667814], followed by 
[CONTACT_667813] (20, 21).  However, these promising agents do not detect all recurrences.  
Although choline -based PET/CT is widely used outside the US for imaging prostate cancer, 
there have  been numerous studies reporting a low sensitivity and specificity, especially at 
low prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels (22, 23).  Consequently, improved imaging of 
prostate cancer is necessary .  One novel promising method is PET imaging with 
18F-FACBC, a new synthetic amino acid .  Recent evaluations by [CONTACT_899059] .  indicate that 
this tracer might be superior when compared to choline PET/CT (24).  However, recent work 
indicates that 18F-FACBC uptake in prostate cancer is similar to that in BPH nodules (25). 
In addition, prostate -specific membrane antigen (PSMA) recently has received increased 
attention (26).  This cell surface protein is significantly overexpressed in prostate cancer 
cells when compared to other PSMA -expressing tissues such as kidney, proximal small 
intestine or salivary glands (27).  It therefore provides a promising target for prostate 
canc er-specific imaging (28).  Recently methods have been developed to label PSMA 
ligands with 68Ga enabling their use for PET imaging and therapy (29).  Initial experience 
with PET/CT using Glu -NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx) -[68Ga(HBED -CC)] (68Ga-PSMA -11) as a 
68Ga-labelled PSMA ligand suggests that this novel tracer can detect prostate cancer 
relapses and metastases with high contrast by [CONTACT_899060] g to the extracellular domain of PSMA, 
followed by [CONTACT_667813] (30).  Improved detection of occult metastatic disease will improve 
treatment efficacy by [CONTACT_899061].  
We conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_186349] 68Ga-PSMA -[ADDRESS_1260291] University.  Ten men (age ra nge:  67  to 83 year -old; mean  ± SD:  
73.1 ± 5.7) with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer (PSA range:  2.6 -36.4; 
mean  ± SD:  12.4  ± 10.6) were enrolled.  PET/CT images were acquired at 51  to 68 minutes 
(mean  ± SD:  57.4  ± 6.3) after injection of 3.7  to 4.0 mCi (mean  ± SD:  3.8  ± 0.1) of 
68Ga-PSMA.  The uptake of 68Ga-PSMA -[ADDRESS_1260292] of care imaging studies (CT, MRI, 18F-FDG PET/CT, 
18F-NaF PET /CT, 99mTc MDP bone scan) prior to enrollment that were non -contributory, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_899053].  The participants did not receive treatment in this interval as they 
were managed under a wait and watch strategy due to no identifiable disease.  The inte rval 
from biochemical recurrence to the 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT scan ranged 5  to 75 months 
(mean  ± SD:  30.8  ± 20.4).  
Biodistribution and localization of 68Ga-PSMA -11 
All participants tolerated the procedure withou t immediate or delayed (up to 7  days) 
complain ts or complications .  The areas with the highest 68Ga-PSMA -11 accumulation are 
the lacrimal grand (mean SUV max:  9.3 ± 3.3 [range :  4.6 to 14.9] and SUV mean:  5.2 ± 2.3 
[range :  2.5 to 8.8]), the parotid grand (mean SUV max:  14.2 ± 2.6 [range :  9.9 to 19.1] and 
SUV mean:  11.8 ± 2.6 [range :  7.2 to 16.1]), the submandibular grand (mean SUV max:  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 7 of 25 CONFIDENTI AL Amendment  3, 12 July 2018  16.8 ± 3.3 [range :  12.3 to 22.7] and SUV mean:  13.5 ± 2.9 [range :  9.8 to 18.1]), small 
intestine (mean SUV max:  14.6 ± 4.6 [range :  8.2 to 23.4] and SUV mean:  11.0 ± 3.9 [range :  
5.6 to 18.5]), kidney (mean SUV max:  35.1 ± 9.9 [range :  14.4 to 46.2] and SUV mean:  
25.8 ± 7.5 [range :  12.0 to 36.0]) and bladder (mean SUV max:  35.0 ± 24.7 [range :  
9.6 to 78.5] and SUV mean:  26.5 ± 17.4 [range :  7.8 to 67.9]), while mode rate uptake was 
noted in the sublingual grand (mean SUV max:  5.0 ± 2.4 [range :  1.9 to 10.6] and SUV mean:  
3.3 ± 1.6 [range :  1.5 to 7.1]), liver (mean SUV max:  6.0 ± 1.3 [range :  4.1 to 9.0] and 
SUV mean:  4.1 ± 0.8 [range :  3.2 to 5.7]) and spleen (mean S UVmax:  8.0 ± 3.3 [range :  
2.6 to 12.3] and SUV mean:  6.4 ± 2.7 [range :  2.0 to 10.5]) .  Other tissues analyzed had low

IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 8 of 25 CONFIDENTI AL Amendment  3, 12 July 2018  2.2 Study Agent  
We will use 68Ga-PSMA -11 as the PET radiopharmaceutical.  This agent has previously 
been identified as DFKZ -11;  HBED -CC PSMA ;  or the “Heidelberg  compound .”  This is not  
an FDA -approved product .  This protocol is submitted to IND  128379.  
2.[ADDRESS_1260296].  
2.4 Rationale  
In this stud y, we propose to use a well -established PET isotope, Gallium -68 (68Ga), bound 
to a PSMA  ligand, (ie, 68Ga-PSMA -11), which has high affinity for prostate specific 
membrane antigen .  68Ga-PSMA -11 has been shown to be superior to other PET tracers 
used in pro state cancer such as 18F-Fluoroethylcholine (FECH) and 
18F-Fluoromethylcholine (31, 32).  Therefore, we propose the following aim :  to evaluate 
68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT  for detection of recurrent prostate cancer after initial therapy in 
patients with elevated PSA .   
A prior first -in-human study investigated the  biodistribution of 68Ga-PSMA -[ADDRESS_1260297] lesions .  Thirty -seven men with prostate cancer underwent whole -body PET/CT 
after an intravenous injection of 68Ga-PSMA -11 (median 121.0 MBq, range 52 –212 MBq) .  
Within healthy organs, kidneys and salivary glands demonstrated the highest radiotracer 
uptake .  Lesions suspi[INVESTIGATOR_899054] [ADDRESS_1260298]-injection with high detection rates even at low PSA levels (30).  In another study, a total 
of 78 lesions characteristic for prostate cancer were detected in 32 patients using 
68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT  and 56 lesions were detected in 26 patients using choline PET/CT 
(32).  The higher detection rate in 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT  was statistically significant 
(P = 0.04) .  All lesions detected by 18F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT were also seen by 
68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT .  In conclusion, 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT  can detect prostate cancer 
lesions with improved contrast when compared to 18F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT, 
especially at low PS A levels .

one patient with a very high PSA of 1170 ng/mL, the mean PSA at time of scan was 7.3 
ng/mL. 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET detected sites of recurrence in 24/32 (75 %) patients, including 
8/12 (66.7%) patients with PSA below 1 ng/mL, and t he lowest PSA value associated with a 
positive scan was 0.21 ng/mL .  An example is shown in Figure  3.

This is a phase  2-3 study with  a total of 200 participants with biochemically recurrent 
prostate cancer .  Eligible participants will undergo baseline assessments at enrollment .  
Study participants will receiv e 68Ga-PSMA -11 and undergo a PET/CT .  All patients will first 
be seen by a Stanford Cancer Institute physician and then referred if appropriate on clinical 
grounds to [CONTACT_152421] or his colleagues for this study .  The following steps will take place.  
1. After s igned the informed consent document, p articipants will be given a copy of the 
signed form . 
2. Participant will be asked to drink 1  to 2 glasses of water before arrival at the clinic  
3. Participants will be weighed and vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, res pi[INVESTIGATOR_862], pulse oxymetry) will be recorded  
4. Study personnel (eg, technologist) will verify subject identify;   radiopharmaceutical 
identity;  dose;  and administration route.  Participant will be injected IV  with [ADDRESS_1260301] will be obtained from vertex to 
mid-thighs; this will use [ADDRESS_1260302] scan and without reinjecting 
68Ga-PSMA -11, a second PET/CT will be acquired to compare standard vs digital 
PET/CT.  The CT will be done for attenuation correction only.  
9. Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pulse oxymetry) will be 
recorded again at the completion of the study.  
10. Participants be dismissed.  
11. Participants will be contact[CONTACT_6811] 24  to 72 hours following the scan in order to capture 
potential late occurring Adverse Events.  
12. Clinical follow -up of participant at 3  to 12 months following the scan in order to analyze 
secondary endpoints.  
The 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT  may be repeated at the completion of treatment to evaluate 
response to therapy, if requested by [CONTACT_1963] .

4. IMAGING AGENT INFORMATION   
4.1 Study Agent  
The administered dosage is 111  to 259 MBq (3 to 7 mCi) IV.  We will use 68Ga PSMA -11 as 
the PET radiopharmaceutical. There ar e 2 publications on dosimetry for 68Ga-PSMA -11 
(PMID: 27260521 ; 28012435).  The first  lists 0.0236  mSv/MBq for the mean effective dose, 
while the other indicates 0.0258  mSv/MBq.  We used the maximum potential administered 
activity of 7  mCi and the higher o f the reported dosimetry values.  Therefore, 
259 MBq x 0.0258  mSv / MBq = 6.68 mSv.  
To summarize the results of the published human studies, there were no observed adverse 
events to the radiopharmaceutical.  The measured dosimetry showed that the critical organ 
with 68Ga-PSMA -11 is the spleen, followed by [CONTACT_152414], pancreas and bladder wall.  
The effective dose of 68Ga-PSMA -11 reported (0.0 258 mSv/MBq) is similar to those of 
68Ga-DOTA -TOC (0.023  mSv/MBq) ;  68Ga-DOTA -NOC (0.025  mSv/MBq) ;  
68Ga-DOTA -TATE (0.021  mSv/MBq) ;  and 68Ga-NOTA -RGD (0.022  mSv/MBq) (36-39).

10. MEASUREMENTS  
10.1 Outcome Measure s 
The principal goal of this study is to compare , in the setting of suspected prostate cancer 
recurrence,  the diagnostic performance o f 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT in cases where 
conventional imaging for detecting recurrent prostate cancer is likely to have false 
negatives.  Sites  of suspected disease  will be evaluated by  68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT and 
conventional imaging by [CONTACT_899063].  Specifically, it is hypothesized that the 
diagnostic performance of the  68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT will be superior to anatomic al 
imaging , and that 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT will provide complementary information.

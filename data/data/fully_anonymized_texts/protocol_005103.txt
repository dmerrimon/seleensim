Section 5.2, Exclusi onCriteria, criterion #15 has been 
revised to lower the s ystolic and diastolic blood pressure 
eligibility  criteria.  
Rationale: The cut off for blood pressure has been 
lowered to a more conservative level to optimize blood 
pressure control prior to study entry.
Section 5.3.1, Dietary  Restrictions has been revised to 
clarify  that fasting is required prior to body  weight (also 
a revision to Section 8.6.1 and Appendix 9) but is not 
required prior to post dose PK samp le collection.  
Additionally , the requirem ent to withhold blood 
pressure and lipid modify ing medications prior to site 
has been removed.
Rationale: Aligns with updates to Section 8.6.[ADDRESS_214622] dose PK sample collection has 
been included given PF-06882961 is dosed with food.  
Blood pressure and lipid modify ing medications may  be 
taken prior to site visits to ensure blood pressure and 
lipid management is maintained in partici pants requiring 
these medications.  
Section 6.4, Study  Intervention Compliance has been 
updated to provide an example of how man y doses may 
be missed for the placebo run
-in duration, depending on

to clarify  that the same arm for BP and PR should be 
used throughout the study, when possible.
Rationale: These revisions are made for clarification.
Section 8.3: ( 1) 8.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for 
Collection AE and SAE Information has been rev ised to 
remove the requirement for medical occurrences that 
begin before the start of study intervention but after 
obtaining informed consent to be recorded on the 
Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of 
the CRF; ( 2) [IP_ADDRESS] Recording Nonser ious AEs and 
SAEs on the CRF has been updated to reflect current 
sponsor language.
Rationale: This revision aligns with the requirement to 
collect and record all AEs and SAEs from the time 
informed consent is provided. It also aligns with current 
sponsor 
language regarding the recording of AEs and 
SAEs on the CRF.
Section [IP_ADDRESS], Electrocar diogram Analy ses, has been 
revised to remove summarization of the number of 
participants with uncorrected QT values >500 msec.
Rationale: Safet y anal yses and summaries will be based 
on QTcF intervals, not QT intervals.
Section 9.4.3, Other Analyses has be en revised to clarify  
that results from an y future anal yses from 
pharmacogenomic or biomarker data from banked 
biospecimens are not planned to be included in the CSR.
Rationale: These results are not routinel y included in 
CSRs.
Protocol Appendix 4, Section 10.4.2, Female Participant 
Reproductive Inclusion Criteria the requirement of 
females to not donate eggs has been removed.

Glucagon -like peptide- 1 (GL P-1) is a neuroendocrine hormone that i s predominantly  
released from the small intes tine in response to food intake.1  GLP-1 activation of the GL P-1 
receptor (GLP -1R) stimulates insulin release, inhibits glucagon secretion in a 
glucose -dependent mann er, and delays gastric empty ing.2,[ADDRESS_214630] a pproved for the treatment of ty pe2 diabetes 
mellitus ( T2DM ).PF-06882961 is in Phase 2 development for the treatment of adults with 
T2DM.  Investigation ofthe efficacy , safet y, and tolerability of PF-06882961 for weight loss 
in adult swith obesity is also being evaluated.
2.1.Study Rationale 
The purp ose of this multicenter, Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, sponsor -open,
placebo- controlled, parallel -group study  is to assess the tolerability , safety , and 
pharmacod ynamic (PD) data for PF -[ADDRESS_214631] more than 424 million people 
worldwide,6and the preva lence of T2DM within the [LOCATION_002] (US) is estimated to range 
from 12 to 14%.7T2DM is characterized b y insulin resistance, a disorder in which cells do
not respond effectivel y to insulin, resulting in higher blood glucose levels.  Elevated blood 
glucose levels and increasing severity  of insulin resistance result in the need for mor e insulin 
over time, eventuall y resulting in progressive pancreat ic -cellfailure .[ADDRESS_214632] an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_181852], including nephropath y, neuropathy , retinopath y,

number of patients who do not achieve target gl ycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, 
suggesting a need for additional t herapeutic options.

PF-[ADDRESS_214634] been completed in cynomolgus monkeys up to 6 months in 
duration (with a 3-week lead-in and 1-month recovery) and in rats up to 6 months in duration (with a 1-month recovery).  The exposure limits for plasma concentrations of PF-[ADDRESS_214635] level (NOAEL) dose of 250 mg/kg/day in the 6-month w ith 1-month recovery toxicology study in

Page 20At the NOAEL dose of 150 mg/kg/day in the 13-week study with 3-week lead-in, exposure 
margins were 6.2- and 4.5-fold for C max(free) in males and females, respectively, and were 
5.1- and 4.7-fold for AUC 24(free) in males and females, respectively, at the highest projected 
mean exposure of PF-06882961 in this study (200 mg BID in T2DM participants).
Embryo-fetal developmental studies were completed in rats and rabbits.  Based on the lack of 
maternal toxicity or adverse effects on embryo-fetal development, the NOAEL for maternal and developmental toxicity in rats was 500 mg/kg/day (highest dose evaluated).  
 
In embryo-fetal studies conducted in rabbits, the NOAEL for maternal and developmental 
toxicity was 250 mg/kg/day.  
PF-06882961 was negative in genetic toxicity testing and photosafety endpoints.  A risk 
assessment of the target organ toxicities noted in  the repeat-dose toxicity studies is provided

To date, [ADDRESS_214636] been completed with 
PF-06882961. In C3421001 and C3421003, healthy participants were randomized to receive single oral doses of PF-06882961 (or matching placebo).  In C3421002, adult participants with T2DM were randomized to receive oral doses of PF-06882961 (or matching placebo) for 28 days, and safety results from this study are provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Refer to the 
investigator’s brochure (IB) for more details on these studies and the known drug class effects on marketed injectable GLP-1R agonists.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Safety
Clinical data from the completed C3421001, C3421002 and C3421003 studies are provided 
in the IB for PF-06882961.
In the C3421002 study, PF-06882961 doses ranging from 10 mg BID to 120 mg BID were
generally safe and well tolerated. A total of 98 participants with T2DM on a background of 
metformin were randomized to receive PF-06882961 or matching placebo in a 3:1 randomization ratio for 28 days, and 92 participants completed the study. Six (6) participants discontinued from the study, of which 2 withdrew from the study due to adverse events and 4 withdrew during the treatment or follow up period for non-treatment related reasons.

addition, there was 1 symptoma tic hy poglycemic adverse event (AE) that was reported in 
1subject in the 120 mg BID group. This AE was non- fasting, mild in severity  and of limited 
duration.
No deaths occurred in the C3421002 study .  Two (2) participants experienced 2 severe 
TEAEs durin g the study , 1 of which occ urred in the dosing period and was considered 
treatment related, and the other occurred during the follow -up period and was not consi dered 
treatment related.  The latter participant experienced 2 non- treatment -related serious adverse 
events (SAEs), 1 of wh ich occurred in the follow -up period and was a T EAE of severe 
intensity , and the other SAE occu rred outside of the study  reporting pe riod.
While there were isolated values for laboratory  tests, vital signs and electrocardiogram 
(ECG )intervals outside of t he reference ranges, no clear adverse trends were apparent in 
these parameters.  As has been re ported for marketed GL P-1R agonists,10,11increa ses in heart 
rate have been observed, with mean increases ranging from 5 to 15 beats per minute ( bpm)
across doses adminis tered to date, and most heart rate values within the normal range.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Pharmacokinetics
The clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) of PF -06882961 in adult participa nts has been evaluated 
in three completed studies: C3421001, C3421002, and C3421003.  The resul ts of these 
completed studies are summarized in the PF -06882961 IB.

2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment
Based on the clinical history of injectable GLP-1R agonists, an oral GLP-1R agonist is 
expected to improve glucose control, reduce HbA1c levels, diminish food intake, and decrease body weight in patients with T2DM, while avoiding the requirement for subcutaneous injections that accompanies currently available peptidic GLP-1R agonists.
In line with the clinical profile of marketed GLP-1R agonists,
12,17,18the most frequently 
reported AEs with PF-[ADDRESS_214640] heart rate values within the normal range.
Considering all available clinical and nonclinical data, the benefit-risk profile of 
PF-06882961 is favorable and supports continued clinical development in patients with T2DM.
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected AEs of PF-06882961 may be found in the IB which is the single reference safety document (SRSD) for this study. CCI

4.1.Overall Design
This Phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, sponsor -open, placebo- controlled, 
parallel -group, stud y will assess tolerability , safet y, and pharmacod ynamics (PD) of BID 
administrati on of PF -06882961 in adult participants with T2DM who are treated with 
metformin. In addition, participants with obesity , without T2DM, will be enrolled toexplore 
differences in tolerability, safet y,pharmacokinetics and pharmacod ynamics between 
participa nts with T2DM and participants without T2DM and to support clinical development 
in both T2DM and obesity .
For participants w ith T2DM, t he metformin dose ( at least 500 mg/day) must have been stable 
for at least 60 days prior to the screening visit (Visit 1) and should remain the same until the 
first follow- up visit (ie, Visit 10, Week 13-14), excep t in circumstances where a dose change 
is deemed medicall y necessary .

Page 264.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design
This study is designed to assess the tolerability, safety, and PD of PF-06882961 in 
participants with T2DM and in non-diabetic participants with obesity over 12 weeks of dosing.  A single-blind placebo-run-in period (Visit 2 to Visit 3) is included in this study to familiarize participants with the study treatment regimens and to exclude those who are not compliant with blinded placebo dosing prior to randomization.  Study intervention compliance is described in Section 6.4 .  Clinical laboratory tests, assessment of vital signs 
and 12-lead ECGs, physical examination, and AE monitoring will provide data to evaluate the tolerability, safety, and PD of PF-06882961.
This study will assess tolerability of PF-06882961 at different starting doses (5 mg BID vs 
10 mg BID), as well as tolerability of PF-06882961 at different duration of each titration step (1 week vs. 2 weeks), and the tolerability of different target doses (80 mg BID, 120 mg BID and 200 mg BID).  The placebo arm is added to facilitate blinding to active treatment and to mitigate bias in reporting of AEs.  
 
 
 
  Therefore, to compare tolerability, 
safety and PK exposures directly in this study, the study population includes participants with obesity without T2DM, to target a similar BMI range as patients with T2DM and to support clinical development in T2DM and obesity.  
Published data from marketed GLP-1R agonists suggests that gastrointestinal (GI) 
tolerability may be different between men and women, therefore randomization will be stratified based on biological sex.

PF-[ADDRESS_214643] been shown to increase with marketed GLP-1R agonists.
12In addition, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], 
coagulation profile and total bile acids (TBA) will be assessed, based on non-adverse findings in the nonclinical studies with PF-06882961. Assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior by [CONTACT_941] C-SSRS
19and PHQ-920will also be performed based on the potential risk 
related to the product labeling for the injectable GLP1R agonist liraglutide for obesity.21
While GLP-1R agonists typi[INVESTIGATOR_177248]-administered with anti-diabetic agents th at can cause hypoglycemia (such as insulin or 
sulfonylureas), blood glucose concentrations will be monitored throughout the study via glucometer, and monitoring of symptomatic hypoglycemic AEs (HAEs) will be performed.  
Body weight will be measured in duplicate at all study visits, except Visit 11, as GLP-1R
agonists have been shown to decrease food intake and body weight. The collection of blood samples, specifically fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c will assist in the time- and dose-related PD response.  
Both females of childbearing potential, as well as those who are of non-childbearing 
potential, will be enrolled given the availability of embryo fetal developmental (EFD) toxicity studies with PF-06882961.  However, as marketed GLP-1R agonists are listed as contraindicated in pregnancy, the use of a highly effective method of contraception is required and measures will be taken to limit the risk of pregnancy in the female population enrolled (see Schedule of Activities and Appendix 4 re: contraception) for additional 
information regarding contraception use and monitoring.
The potential risk of exposure to PF-06882961 in a sexual partner of a male participant in 
this study via ejaculate is low, and therefore no contraception (condom) use in male participants is warranted.  The calculated safety margin is ≥100-fold between the estimated 
partner exposure due to seminal transfer and the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL)for serious manifestations of developmental toxicity in nonclinical studies.  The safety 
margin of 100-fold is based on applying a 10-fold safety factor for interspecies extrapolation 
and a 10-fold safety factor for susceptible populations.

Banked biospecimens will be collected for exploratory pharmacogenomic/genomic/biomarker analyses and retained in the Biospecimen Banking System (BBS), which makes it possible to better understand the investigational product’s mechanism of action and to seek explanations for differences in, for example, exposure, tolerability, safety, and/or efficacy not anticipated prior to the beginning of the study.CCI

Page 284.3. Justification for Dose
The target doses (planned dose at end of study) in the C3421008 study of 80 mg BID 
(Arms 3 and 4)and 120 mg BID (Arms 1 and 2) represent the 2 top doses being assessed in the Phase 2b dose ranging study in T2DM with PF-06882961.  As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , more AEs were observed in the [ADDRESS_214644] of PF-06882961 is expected to be similar to that of marketed GLP-1R agonists.   
 
Although doses of >120 mg BID are not anticipated to be needed for glycemic efficacy in 
T2DM participants, based on experience from marketed GLP-1 agonists, doses needed to maximize weight loss are generally higher than what are needed for glycemic efficacy.  For this reason, a higher dose of PF-06882961 is being assessed in this study (200 mg BID, Arm 6) to assess the tolerability of this dose following an extended titration scheme of 10 weeks. The starting dose and titration scheme for Arms 6 and 7 is similar to Arm 2 (Figure 1 ), but the titration scheme continues at a 1-week interval over a longer duration to 
achieve a higher target dose.  This additional 200 mg BID arm in T2DM may facilitate development of PF-06882961 for treatment of obesity in participants with T2DM.
Although the steady-state exposures of PF-06882961 at 200 mg BID in T2DM participants 
are expected to be higher than that encountered in previous clinical studies (120 mg BID in C3421002), reasonable tolerability of this dose may be expected based on the extended 12-week titration scheme.  Moreover, the predicted exposure at [ADDRESS_214645] a 27- and 14-fold margin under the unbound NOAEL for the 6 month rat toxicology study for C
maxand AUC, respectively 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
 
 
  Inclusion of a cohort of participants 
with obesity and not T2DM has been included at the highest dose (200 mg BID) to compare PK, PD and tolerability between the [ADDRESS_214646] doses over a 10-week duration, which is expected to improve the tolerability of PF-06882961, and therefore doses of up to 200 mg BID are viewed asappropriate for assessment in this study.

Morning d osing will occur with the food at the si te at Visit 2 through Visit 9.  Participants 
will be instructed to arrive at the site in the fasted state , bring their IP with them and to delay  
self-administration of IP and concomitant medications , if appr opriate ( as described in 
Section 5.3.1), on scheduled visit day s until they  arrive for their outpatient clinic visit.
Participants should be instructed that if they  forget to take their morning dose at their usual 
time, they  should take the mi ssed dose as soon as possible (with food) on the day  it was 
missed; however, there must be at least an [ADDRESS_214656] they  were 
dispensed previousl y.
6.2.Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
1. The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have 
been maintained d uring transit for all study  interventions received and any  
discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study  intervention, as 
applicable for temperature -monitored shipments. 
2.Only  participants enrolled in the study  may  receive study  intervent ion and on ly 
authoriz ed site staff may  supply  or administer study  intervention.  All study 
interventions must be stored in a secure, environmentally  controlled, and monitored 
(manual or automated recording) area in accordance with the labeled storage 
condi tions with access lim ited to the investigator and authorized site staff.  At a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations 
must be documented and available upon request.  Data for nonworking days must 
indicate the minimum and maxim um temperat ure since previousl y documented for all 
site storage locations upon return to business.
3.The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) 
is responsible for stud y intervention accountability, reco nciliation , and recor d 
maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  All study  
interventions will be accounted for using an IP accountability  form/record.  All I P 
that it taken home by  [CONTACT_2299], both used and unused, mus t be retur ned to the 
investigator b y the participant.
4.Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study  
interventions are provided in the investigational product (I P) manual.
5.Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD will be supers eded b y the storage 
conditions stated on the product label. 
6.Study  interventions should be stored in their original containers and in accordance 
with the labels. 
7.Site staff will instruct participants on the proper storage requirements for take -home 
study  intervention. 
8.Any excursions from the study  intervention label storage conditions should be 
reported to [COMPANY_007] upon discovery  along with an y actions taken.  The site should 
activel y pursue options for returning the stud y intervention to the sto rage condit ions 
described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Once an excursion is identified, the 
study  intervention must be quarantined and not used until [COMPANY_007] provides permission 
to use the study  intervention.  I t will not be considered a protocol deviation i f [COMPANY_007] 
approves the use of the study  intervention after the temperature excursion. Use of the 

PF-[ADDRESS_214657] (IP manual ).
9.The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused study  
intervention (eg, at the site).  If destruction is authori zed to take place at the 
investigator site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destro yed in 
compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy , and any  
special instructions provided by  [CONTACT_4618], and all des truction mu st be adequately  
docu mented.
Additional details about accountability , storage, destruction, and excursion reporting can be 
found in the I P manual.
6.2.1. Preparation and Dispensing
The 2-week single -blind placebo run -in tablets will be dispensed at Vis it1 using an 
interactive respon se technology  (IRT) drug management sy stem.  The same I RT drug 
management s ystem will be used to dispense the IP from Visit [ADDRESS_214658] udy visit.
6.3.Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
6.3.1. Allocation to Investigational Product
Allocation of participants to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an IRT) s ystem 
(interactive Web -based response [I WR]).  
A randomization c ode using t he method of random p ermuted blocks will be utilized to 
randomize eligible participants with T2DM treated with metformin in a 4:4:4:4:4:3 ratio (1 of 
5 active dosing regimens of PF- 06882961 or placebo) and non-d iabetic participants with 
obesity  in a 4:1 ra tio (1 active dosing regimen of PF -06882961 or placebo) prior to the first 
dose of IP.  
Participants will be stratified at randomization (Day 1) by [CONTACT_66067] (T2DM vs. 
non-diabetic ) and by [CONTACT_181871] (men vs. wome n).
The site personnel (stud y coordin ator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select 
information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the 
protocol number, and the participant number.  The site personnel will then be provided with a 
treatmen
t assig nment, randomization number, and dispensable unit (DU) or container number 
when IP is being supplied via the I RT s ystem.  The I RT s ystem will provide a confirmation 
report containing the participant number, rando mization number, and DU or container 
numbe r assigned.  The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. 

PF-[ADDRESS_214659] information 
and further details on the use of the IRT s ystem.
6.3.2. Breaking the Blind 
The I RT will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. In case of an emergency , the 
investigator ha s the sole responsibility  for determining if unblinding of a participant’s 
treatment assignment is warranted. Participant safety  must alway s be the first consideration 
in making such a determination. If the investigato r decides that unblinding is warrant ed, the 
investigator should make every  effort to contact [CONTACT_1152] a 
participant’s treatment assignment unless this could delay  further management of the 
participant. If a participant’s treatment a ssignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified 
within [ADDRESS_214660] 
be recorded in the source documentation and case report form (CRF).
The study -specific I RTreference manual and IP manual will provide the contac t information 
and further details on the use of the IRT s ystem.
6.4. Study Intervention Compliance
Participant compliance with IP will be assessed at each visit as noted in the SoA.  
Compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_181872].  Through Visit [ADDRESS_214661] iance ;however ,the 
cards should remain in the possess ion o f the participant.  Compliance (as assessed b y tablet 
count) will be defined as self -administration, by  [CONTACT_3038], of:
≥89% of the study -
supplied placebo administered during the single- blind placebo 
run-in period.  Based on the visit window, fo r a placebo run- in that is 11-13 days, up 
to 2missed doses are allowed, and for a placebo run- in that is 14-17 days, up to 
3missed doses are allowed. Participants who do not meet this compliance threshold 
are not eligible to be randomized into the study (See Section 5.2).
≥80% of th
e study -supplied I P from Day 1 (Visit 3) through Week 12 (Visit 9), 
inclusive.  I nvestigators must closely  follow non- compliant, randomized, participants 
to enhance their adherence to treatment.  Any participant who fails to meet the 
criterion of ≥80% comp liance will be re- educated by  [CONTACT_181873].
Deviation(s) from the prescribed dosage regimen should be recorded in the CRF.

PF-[ADDRESS_214662] the sponsor should there be questions as to whether a medication is 
permitted or prohibited.
Hormonal contraceptives that meet the requirements of this study  are allowed to be used in 
participants who ar e wo men of childbearing potential (WOCBP) (see Appendix 4 ).
6.5.1. Metformin
All participants with T2DM are required to be taking metformin monotherapy  prior to 
inclusion in this study  as listed in Section 5.1.  Participants must have bee n taking a stable 
dose of metformin ( ≥500 mg/day ) for at least 60 days prior to the screening visit (Visit 1).  
Participants will continue taking their own metformin at the same total daily dose that was 
prescribed prior to study  entry  through the first fo llow-up visit (ie, Visit 10, Week 13-14), 
except in circumstances where a change in dose is deemed medically  necessary .  For stud y 
visit day s, participants should be instruc ted to refrain from taking morning doses at home and 
to bring the metformin to the site for dosing at the same time as their blinded I P.  For 
participants taking metformin more than once a day , the timing should be approximately  the 
same on each day .
6.5.2. Medic ations for Glycemic Control
Aside from metformin, the use of other medications for glycemic control is not permitted in 
this study  unless the participant meets the protocol defined gl ycemic rescue criteria (see

In rare instances, it may  be necessary  for a particip antto permanentl y discontinue IP.  If a 
safet y or tolerability concern arises, in particular if not responsive to s ymptomatic 
management, dosing with double -blinded I P may  be stopped in an individual participant at 
investigator discretion.  
If IPis perm anently  discontinued, the participant remains in the study  and continues to
follow all protocol specified visits and procedures according t o the SoA. 
The site should notify  the Sponsor Medical Monitor or Sponsor Clinician if the below criteria 
for permanent discontinuation a re met.
Note that discontinuation of IPdoes not represent withdrawal from th e study.
See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of intervention discontinuation an d follow -up 
and for an y further evaluations that need to be com pleted.
7.1.1. Criteria for Discontinuation
Discontinuation of I P must occur for a pa rticipant meeting any  of the following conditions: 
Criteria for a potential Hy ’s law case are met ( see Appendix 6 ).
Intent to become pregn ant or pregnancy  confirmed by  [CONTACT_95484] ( -hCG) testing.  
Based on mental health assessment as outlined in Section 8.2.7, should be 
discontinued from dosing at the discretion of the invest igator.
7.2.Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the Study 
A participant may  withdraw from the study  at an y time at his/her own request, or may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the inv estigator for safety , behavior al, compliance, 
or admini strative reasons.
At the time of discontinuing from the stud y, if possible, an earl y termination visit should be 
conducted.  See the SoA for assessments to be collected at the time of early termination and 
follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. 

PF-[ADDRESS_214664] awsfrom the study , he/she may  request destr uction of any  remaining 
samples, but dat a alread y generated from the samples will continue to be available, and may 
be used to protect the integrity  of existing anal yses.  The investigator must document any  
such requests in the site study  records.
If the p articipant withdraws from the study  and also withdraws consent (see below) for 
disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed and no 
additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to use any  data 
collected before such withdrawal of consent .
When a participant withdraws from the stud y because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded 
on the CRF and reported on the Clinical Trial (CT) SAE Report.
Lack of completion of all or an y of the withdrawal/earl y termin ation procedures will not be 
viewed as p
rotocol deviations so long as the participant’s safet y was preserved.
Withdrawal of Consent: 
Participant s who request to discontinue receipt of study  treatment will remain in the study  
and must continue to be follow ed for protocol -specified follow -up proc edures.  The onl y 
exception to this is when a participant specificall y withdraws consent for any further contact 
[CONTACT_78258].  Parti cipant s should notify  the investigator i n writing of the decision to 
withdraw consent from future follow- up whenever possible.  The withdrawal of consent 
should be explained in detail in the medical records by  [CONTACT_093], as to whether the 
withdrawal is only  from further receipt of IP or also from study  procedures and/or 
post-treatment study  follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page.  I n the event that 
vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly  availab le 
information should be used to determine vital status only  as appropriatel y directed in 
accordance with local law.
7.3.Lost to Follow -up 
A participant will be considered lost to follow- up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y the study  site.
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study  visit:

Page 45The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_181874] d counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or 
should continue in the study ;
Before a participant is deemed los t to follow -up, the investigator or designe e must 
make every  effort to regain contac t with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing 
address or local equivalent methods).  These contact [CONTACT_181875]’s medical record;
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study. 
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study  as a whole is handled as part of Appendix 1.
8.STUD Y ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
The investigator (or an appropriate delegate at the investigator site) must obtain a signed and 
dated ICD before performing an y stud y-specific procedures.  
Study  procedures and their tim ing are summarized in the SoA.  Protocol waivers or 
exemptions are not allowed.
Immediate safety  concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately  upon 
occurrenc e or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study  
intervention.
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential 
and required for stu dy conduct.
All screening evaluation s must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility  criteria.  The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibi lity or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.
Every  effort should be made to ensure that protocol -required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances outside the control of the investigator tha t may  make it unfeasible to perform 
the test.  I n these cases, the investigator must take all steps necessary  to ensure the safet y and 
well-being of the participant.  When a protocol- required test cannot be performed, the 
investigator will document the rea son for the missed test and an y corrective and p reventive 
actions that he or she has taken to ensure that required processes are adhered to as soon as 
possible.  The study  team must be informed of these incidents in a timely  manner.

PF-[ADDRESS_214665] iontimes of blood sampling may  change.  Additional blood 
samples may  be taken for safet y assessments at times specified b y [COMPANY_007], provided the total 
volume taken during the study  does not exceed 550 mL during an y period of 60 consecutive 
days.
8.1.Efficacy A ssessments
Not applicable.
8.2.Safety Assessments
Planned time points for all safety  assessments are provided in the SoA.  Unschedule d clinical 
laboratory  measurements ma y be obtained at an y time during the stud y to a ssess any  
perceived safety  concerns.
8.2.1. Physical Examinations
Physical examinations are performed as indicated in the 
SoA.
Physical examinations may  be conducted by  a ph ysician, trained ph ysician’s assistant or 
nurse practitioner as acceptable and according to local regulation.  A complete phy sical 
examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the head, ears, ey es, nose, mouth , 
skin, heart and lung examinations, l ymph nodes, and gastrointestinal, musculoskele tal and 
neurological s ystems.  
Height will be measured at screening onl y.
A limited phy sical examination is performed at the follow -up visit and may  be performed at 
non-specified visits if there are findings d uring the previous phy sical examination or 
new
/open AEs, if appropriate and at investigator discretion.  The limited phy sical 
examination will be focused on general appearance, lungs, cardiovascular system, and 
partici pant reported s ymptoms.
Investigators should pay  special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.

Page 478.2.2. Vital Signs
[IP_ADDRESS]. Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate
In this stud y, assessment of vital signs (systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, and pulse 
rate)will occur at the nominal time points specified in the SoA per the following 
specifications:
At screening, the participant’s arm circumference should be measured (eg, using a 
flexible anthropometric tape) at the midpoin t of the length of the upper arm and the 
appropriate cuff selected and used througho ut the study . 
Note: Participants with arm circumference greater than the largest cuff size 
available at the site or >52 cm are not eligible.   
BP and puls
e rate will be me asured via an automated device using an oscillometric 
method (not auscultation).
Assessment of BP and pulse rate can be manual (rather than using an automated 
device), only if an automated device is not available; however when done 
manuall y pulse rate must be measured in the brachial/radial artery  for at least 
30seconds.
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_181855]’s arm supported at the 
level of the heart, and recorded to the nearest mm Hg, following a rest of at least 
5minutes.  The assessment at Visit 3 (Day 1) will serve as the participant’s baseline.  
Triplicate assessments will be measured at screening, and pre -and post -dose times at 
Visit 3, Visit 6 and Visit 9 with a brief interval (eg, 2-4minutes) between succe ssive 
triplicate assessments.
Same arm (preferabl y the dominant arm) will be used for BP and pulse ra te 
assessments throughout the study , whenever possible .
Participants should be instructed not to speak during BP and pulse rate measurements.
See Appendix [ADDRESS_214666] 12-Lead E CGs should be collected at times specified in the SoA section of this
protocol using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures 
pulse rate ( PR),QT, and QTc intervals and QR S complex.  All scheduled ECGs should be 
performed after the participant has rested quietly  for at least [ADDRESS_214667] -dose times at Visit 3, Visit 6, and Visit 9 as 
specified in the SoA.
If a postdose QTc interval remains ≥30msec from the baseline andis >450 msec; or an 
absolute QTc value is ≥500 msec for an y scheduled ECG for greater than 4 hours (or sooner ,
at the discretion of the investig ator) ,or QTc intervals get progressivel y long er, the participant
should undergo continuous ECG monitoring.  A cardiologist should be consulted if QTc 
intervals do not retu rn to less than the criterion listed above after 8 hours of monitoring (or 
sooner , at the discretion of the investigator). 
In som e cases, it may  be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placem ent as contributing to the ECG abnormal ity.  It is important that leads beplaced in the 
same positions each time to achiev e precise ECG recordings.  If a machine- read Q Tc value is 
prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements may  not be necessary  if a qualified 
medical provider ’s interpreta tion determines that the QTc values are in the acceptable range.
ECG values of potential clinical concern are listed in Appendix 7.
8.2.4. Management of Glycemic Control
HAEs and fasting plasma glucose will be routinel y monito
red during participation in the 
study .
Based on this information, as well as review of the results reported by  [CONTACT_2237] , 
an assessment of an y symptomatic and asymptomatic occurrence of h ypo-or hyper-glycemia 
must be undertaken.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Home Glucose Monitoring
A
ll participants will be provided home glucose monitoring supplies includ ing a 
Sponsor -provided glucometer, instructions on the use of the glucometer and 
accompan ying supplies.
Home glucose monitoring logs w ill be provided to participants for completion at 
home and brought to each outpatient visit to the site along with the glu cometers .  
For participants with T2D M, investigators must review the home glucos e monitoring 
logs completed b y the participants and the readings stored in the glucometer device at 
each visit to the site after the single -blind placebo run -in visit (V isit2).

Page 49For participants with obesity  only , the review of the glucometer and glucose log 
should be completed if participants have signs or symptoms of hy pogly cemia. 
Otherwise, regular glucometer monitoring at home is not required.
Participants with T2DM must p erform h ome glucose monitoring at least [ADDRESS_214668]
an 8-(preferabl y 10-) hour fast (except water).  However, 
the investigator may  recommend more frequent home glucose monitoring if needed.
Less frequent glucose monitoring in partici pants wi th T2DM will NOT be considered 
a protocol deviation unless the pa rticipant fails to monitor his/her glucose for 3 or 
more day sper week.
If aparticipant experiences sy mptoms of hy poglycemia, home glucose monitoring 
should be performed, and these s ympt
oms, along with the glucometer measurement, 
should be captured on the home glucose monitoring log.
If a participant useshis/her own glucometer, and not one provided b y the Sponsor, a 
protocol deviation will NOT be recorded provided the investigator i sstill able to 
monitor the participant’s daily  glucose values ac cording to the criteria stated above. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Management of Hypoglyc emia
Any epi[INVESTIGATOR_181856] (HAE) Form CRF.  For the definition of 
a hypoglycemic e pi[INVESTIGATOR_95461] y categorization see Section [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_214669] a fasti

the definition of hy poglycemia must be instructed to repeat th e measurement the next day  
(following at least an 8 - [preferabl y 10-] hour fast, except water).  If the second measurement 
also meets th ebelow definition, participants must be asked to return to the site within 
1to3days (following at least an 8 - [prefe rably 10-] hour fast, except water) and have blood 
collected and sent to the central laboratory  for analy sis of fasting plasma glucose.
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Definition and Severity of Categorization of Hypoglycemic Adverse Event 
(HAE)
Based on review of the participant complet ed hom e glucose monitoring log at each site visit, 
as well as results reported by  [CONTACT_2237] , the investigator must assess t he glucose 
values as well as an y symptoms documented.
HAE is defined as 1of the following:
1.Asymptomatic hypoglycemia: An even t notaccompanied by  [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_107062] a blood  glucose value of <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmoL /L) using either glucometer 
(fingers tick blood glucose) or sponsor- identified central laboratory  (plasma glucose).

using glucometer (fingerst ick blood glucose) or sponsor -identified central laboratory
(plasma glucose ) and the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_181857], 
subcutaneous glucagon, or intravenous ( IV)glucose .
3.Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia: An event during which symptoms of HAE 
are not accompanied b y a glucose determination but was presumabl y caused by a 
blood glucose concent ration of <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), and the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_181858], subcutaneous glucagon, or IVglucose .
Each epi[INVESTIGATOR_95465] y.  Tocharacterize the event 
as severe, all 3criteria below must be met:
1.The participant was unable to treat him/herself.  Neurologic impairment, and not the 
age of the participant, is the explanation for why  the participant could not treat 
him/herself and required the assistance of another person.
2.The p articipant s exhibit at least one of the following neurological s ymptoms:
Memory  loss;
Confusion;
Uncontrolled behavior;
Irrational behavior;
Unusual difficulty  in awakening;
Suspected seizure;
Seizure;
Loss of consciousness.
3.Either:
If blood glu cose was measured and was ≤54mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L) using 
glucometer (or central laboratory ); or
If blood glucose was not measured, the clinical manifesta tions were reversed by

Events that do not meet all criteria above for severe HAE are characterized as mild or 
moderate in severity .

PF-[ADDRESS_214670] be captured on the HAE CRF.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Manag ement of Hyperglycemia
Hypergl ycemia is defined as the following:
Fasting 
blood glucose ≥ 270mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) using glucome ter (or central
laboratory ).
After randomization, participants noted to have a fasting blood glucose value (during home 
glucose monitoring) meeting the above definition of hy pergl ycemia must be instructed to 
repeat the measuremen t the next day  (following a t least an 8 -(preferabl y10-) hour fast, 
except water).  If the second measurement also meets the above definition, participants must 
be asked to return to the site a day  later (following at least an 8 -(preferably 10-) hour fas t, 
except water) and have b lood collected for fasting plasma glucose (and shipped to the central 
laboratory  for anal ysis).
The investigator should determine if the participant collected the samples after an adequate 
fasting period; and if the pa rticipant i s following recommended die tary guidelines.  Proper 
dietary  and collected procedures should be reinforced with the participant.
If the results from the central laboratory  confirm the readings using glucometer, the 
participant should receive gl ycemic rescue medication at the discreti on of the investigator 
(seeSection 6.5.3 ).
8.2.5. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
See Appendix [ADDRESS_214671] an y 
clinically  relevant changes occur ring during the study  in the AE section of the CRF.  
Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings are those which are not associated with 
the underl ying disease, unless judged by  [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator to be more severe than expected for 
the participant's condition.
All laboratory  tests with values considered clinically  significantl y abnormal during 
participation in the study  or within [ADDRESS_214672] dose of stud y intervention 
should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline o r are no longer considered 
clinically  significant b y the investigator or medical monitor.
If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by  
[CONTACT_20603], the etiology  should be identified and the sponsor notif ied.
All protocol -required laboratory  assessments, as defined in Appendix [ADDRESS_214673] be conducted 
in accordance with the laboratory  manual and the SoA.

results must be recorded in the CRF.
8.2.6. Pregnanc y Testing
Pregnancy  tests will be both urine and serum tests, and must have a sensitivity  of at least 
25mIU/mL.  Serum pregnancy  test will be required for eCRF collection.  Urine pregnancy  
test will be used for site r eference until serum pregnancy  result becomes available.  
Pregnancy  tests will be performed in all females at the times listed in the SoA.  Following a 
negative pregnancy test result at screening, appropriate contraception must be c ommenced 
and a second negative pregnan cy test result will be required at the baseline visit prior the 
participant’s receiving the I P.  Pregnancy  tests will also be done whenever one menstrual 
cycle is missed during the active treatment period (or when pote ntial pregnancy  is otherwise 
suspected) and at the end of the study .  Pregnancy  tests may  also be repeated if requested b y 
institutional review boards (I RBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if requir ed by  [CONTACT_13125].  
8.2.7. Mental Health Questionnaires
[IP_ADDRESS]. Columb ia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C- SSRS)
The C -SSRS is an interview- based rating scale to sy stematically  assess suicidal ideation and 
suicidal behavior.19  The “baseline/screening” version of the C -SSRS will be administered at 
V1.  The “since last v
isit” version of the C -SSRS will be administered at the other visits 
specified in the SoA.  The C -SSRS will be administered by  [CONTACT_181876]. Participants who respond “y es” to questions 4 or 5 
(indicating suicidal ideation), or to any suicidal behavioral question on the C- SSRS at V1 , V2 
or V3 will not be permitted in the study .
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Rater Qualifications
For specific rating assessments, only qualifi ed raters will be allowed to evaluate and/or rate 
participants in this study .  The minimum qualifications a rater must meet will be outlined in a 
guidance document provided to each participating site.  The level of experience with the 
target population (or equivalent), specific scale experience (or equivalent), and certification 
required (if applicable) will be listed and used to determine whether a rater is approved for a 
given assessment.  The rater must become certified to perform selected s tudy assessments 
before he or she can participate in the conduct of the study .  For specifically  defined 
assessments, rater training and standardization exercises may  be conducted, and written and 
signed documentation will be provided by  [CONTACT_22821]’s certi fication.  I n return, 
each site will b e provided written and signed documentation outlining each rater’s 
certification for specific study  assessments.  Recertification may  be required at periodic 
intervals during the study.  The raters who adm inister speci fic stud y assessments will be

PHQ -9 will be completed by  [CONTACT_181877] b y site staff at the pre -defined time 
points outlined in the SoA.  A PHQ- 9 score of ≥15 at V1 , V2 or V3 indicates cl inically  
significant depression and serves as an exclusion criterion for this stud y.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Referral to a Mental Health Professional
A participant should be referred to a MHP for the following reasons:
Response of “y es” to question 4 or 5, or o n any behavioral que stion on the C -SSRS;
A score of ≥15 on the PHQ -9;
In the investigator’s judgment a risk assessment or exclusion is required.
A clinically -qualified MHP is a MHP with appropriate training in the assessment of suic ide 
risk, according to l ocal clinical practice standards and regu lations, who would normally  
evaluate the risk for suicidal ideation and behavior in a patient.
Participants who have recurrent suicidal ideation or behavior during the study  should be 
discont inued from the study  and treated appropriately . If a stud y parti cipant endorses a [ADDRESS_214674] active suicidal ideation or behavior on both occasions b y a risk 
assessment cond ucted b y a qualified MHP, then the partic ipant should be discontinued from 
the study  and treated appropriatel y.
Participants who meet criteria for referral to a MHP, but refuse evaluation and/or treatment 
by a MHP, must be assessed by  [CONTACT_43073] d etermine if the participant should be 
discontinued from dosing or from the stud y. 
8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE and an SAE can be found in Appendix 3 .
AEs will be reported b y the participant (or, when appropriate, b y acaregiver, surrogate, or 
the participant's legall y authorized representative).
The investigator and an y qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events t hat meet t he definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible to pursue 
and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether it 
meets the criteria for classification as an SAE or that caused the participant to discontinue th e

Page 548.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The time period for activel y eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each participant begins from the time the participant provides info rmed consent, 
which is obtained before the particip ant’s participation in the study  (ie, before undergoing 
any study -related procedure and/or receiving IP), through and including a minimum of 
28calendar day s, except as indicated below, after the last admi nistration of the I P.
For participants who are scre en failures, the active collection period ends when screen failur e 
status is determined.
Follow -up by  [CONTACT_74095] a level acceptabl e to the investigator, and 
[COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs after conclusion of the study  
participation .  However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, including a death, at an y time 
after a participant has been discharged from the study , and he/she cons iders the event to be 
reasonabl y related to the study  intervention or study  participation, the investigator must 
promptly  notify  the sponsor.
[IP_ADDRESS].
Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_007] Safety
All SAEs occurrin g in a participant during the active collection period are report ed to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form i mmediatel y and under no circumstance should this 
exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3 .  The inve stigator will submit any  updated SAE 
data to the sponsor within 2 4 hours of it being available.
SAEs occurring in a participant after the active collection period has ended are reported to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety  if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minim um, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reaso nable possibility  of being related to IPmust be 
reported to [COMPANY_007] Safet y.

nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AEoccurrences.
8.3.3. Follow -
up of AEs and SAEs
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactive ly follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts.  For each event, the investigator must pursue and 
obtain adequate information until re solution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, 
or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined i nSection 7.3 ).
In general, follow -up information will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical asses sment of the case and independent determination of 
possibl e causality .  An y information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications 
and illnesses, must be provided.  In the case of a participant death, a summary  of available 
autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] Safety . 
Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3 .
8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Require ments for SAEs
Prompt notification by  [CONTACT_181878] e thical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safet y of a 
study  intervention under clinical investigation are m et.
The sponsor has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the loc al regulatory  authority  and other 
regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a stud y intervention under clinical investigation.  The 
sponsor will comply  with country -specific regulatory  requirem ents relating to safet y 
reporting to the regulatory  authorit y, institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees 
(ECs)
, and investigators.
Investigator safety  reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) according to local regulatory  requirements and sponsor policy  and 
forwarde d to investigators as necessary .
An investigator who receiv es an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safet y information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sp onsor will review 
and then file it along with the investigator’s brochure and will notify  the IRB/EC, if

interve ntion and until [ADDRESS_214676] administration of IP.
If a pregnancy  is reported, the investigator should in form the sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy  and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 4 .
Abnormal pregnancy  outcomes (eg , spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAEs.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of 
an associated SAE, to [COMPANY_007] Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the 
CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] 
drug specifically  approved f or use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in 
accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such 
a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, 
using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated 
SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a participant enrolled in the s tudy, the 
information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.3.6. Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result from the administration or consumption of the IPby [CONTACT_181879], or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.
Exposures to the IPunder study  may occur in clinical trial settings, such as medication 
errors.

8.5.Pharmacokinetics
In this stud y, blood samples ( approximately  3mL, each) t o provide sufficient plasma for PK 
analysis will be collected int o appropriatel y labeled tubes containing dipotassium edetic acid 
(ethy lenediaminetetraacetic acid) - K 2EDTA, at times defined in the SoA – with collections 
occurring prior to dosing with IP on the given scheduled visit and between [ADDRESS_214680] dose on 3 different visits: Visit 3, Visit 6 and Visit 9.  The date/time of the blood 
collection and the date/time of the previous 2doses of blinded IP prior to each of the blood 
collections related to PK (both pre- andpost-dose sampl es)should be noted in a dosing diary  
(or similar) b y the participants and captured in the CRF.  
The PK samples must be processed and shipped as indicated in th e study -specific 
laboratory  manual provided to the investigator site, prior to initiation of st udy, to 
maintain sample integrit y:
Any deviations from the PK sample handling procedure (eg, sample collection 
and processing steps, interim storage or shippi[INVESTIGATOR_19944]), including any 
actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor. On a
case-by-case basis, the sponsor may  make a determination as to whether sample 
integrit y has been compromised.  Any deviation from the specified sample 
handling procedure resulting in comprom ised sample integrit y will be considered 
a protocol deviation;
Any scheduled pre-dose collection [ie,trough concentration ( Ctrough)]obtained 
post dose orany post dose samples not collected within the [ADDRESS_214681] dose 
interval, will be captured as a p rotocol deviation even if results are deemed 
evaluable.
As part o f understanding the PK of the I P, samples may  be used for metabolite 
identification and/or evaluation of the bioanal ytical method, as well as for other 
internal exploratory  purposes.  These d atamay not be included in the clinical report.
Samples will be ana lyzed using a validated anal ytical method in compliance with [COMPANY_007] 
standard operating procedures.

Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
10.3.1. Definition of AE
AE Definition
An AE is an yuntow ard medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study  
participant, temporall y associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not 
considered related to the study  intervention.
NOTE: An AE can therefo re be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of study  intervention.
Even ts Meeting the AE Definition
Any abnormal laboratory test result s (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinalysis) 
or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital sign measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered cli nicall y significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to prog ression of 
underly ing disease).
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensit y of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after study  intervention administration even 
though it may  have been present before the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
intervention or a concomitant me dication.  Overdose per se will not be reported as 
an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self
-harming intent.  Such overdoses should be reported regardless of 
sequelae.

PF-06882961
Protocol C3421008

PFIZER CONFIDE NTIAL
Page 79Events NO TMeeting the AE Definition
Any clinical ly significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal safet y 
assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by  [CONTACT_181887] t’s condition.
The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
participant’s condition.
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that 
leads to the proce dure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) pre sent 
or detected at the start of the stud y that do not worsen.
10.3.2. Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met (e g, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/sy mptoms of the disease under study ,death 
due to progression of disease).
AnSAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
The term “life -threatening” in the defini tion of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the even t.  It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_181860], hospit alization signi fies that the participant has been detain ed (usually  
involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19950]/or treatment that would not have been appropri ate in the ph ysician’s office or 
outpatient settin g.  Complicatio ns that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084].  If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is 
serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary , the AE 
should be considered se rious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_181861] a preexisting condition that did not worsen from

d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity
The term disab ility means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to con duct 
normal life functions.
This definiti on is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) whi ch may  interfer e with or 
prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f.Other situations:
Medical or scientific judgment should be exe rcised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is approp riate in other situations such as important medical even ts that 
may not be immediatel y life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_181862].  These events 
should usually  be considered serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment 
in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or develo pment of drug 
dependency  or drug abuse.
Suspected transmission via a [COMPANY_007] product of an infectious agent, pathogenic or 
non-pathogenic, is consider ed serious.  The event may  be su spected from clinical 
symptoms or laboratory  findings indicating an infect ion in a patient exposed to a 
[COMPANY_007] product.  The terms “suspected transmission” and “transmission” are 
considered s ynon ymous.  These cases are consi dered unexpected and handled as 
serious expedited cases by [CONTACT_181888].  Such cases are al so 
considered for reporting as product defects, if appropriate.
10.3.3. Recording/Reporting and Follow -up of AEs and/or SAEs
AE and SAE Recording/Reporting
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording advers e events on the CRF and 
for reporting ser ious adverse events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE) Report Form to [COMPANY_007] Safety .  These requirements are delineated for 3 typesof 
events: (1) SAEs; (2) nonserious adverse events (AEs); and ( 3) exposure to the IP under

occupational exposure.
When an AE/SAE o ccurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports , and diagnostic 
repor ts) related to the event.
The investigator will then record all r elevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.
Itis notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s 
medical records to [COMPANY_007] Safety  in lieu of completion of the CT SAE Report 
Form/AE/SAE CRF page.
There may  be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_181863] d by [CONTACT_181889] .  In this case, all participant identifiers, with the 
exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_19953] .
The inve stigator will attempt to establish a diag nosis o f the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  Whenever possible, the diagnosis 
(not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.

PF-06882961
Protocol C3421008
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 23September 2020
PFIZER CONFIDE NTIAL
Page 82Assessment of Intensity
The i nvestigator will make an assessment of in tensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: 
Mild: An event that is easily  tolerated by  [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities.
Moderate: An event t hat causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal 
every day activities.
Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities.  An AE tha t is assessed 
as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Seve re is a category  utilized for 
rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined ou tcomes 
as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is r ated as severe.
Assessment of Causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y intervention 
and each occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A “reasonable possibility” o f a relationship convey s that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or a rguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out.
The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other 
risk fac tors, as wel l as the temporal relationshi
p of the event to stud y intervention 
administration will be considered and investigated.
The investigator will also consult the investigator’s brochur e (IB) and/or product 
information, for marketed products, in his/her assessme nt.
For each AE/SAE, the inve stigator must document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality .
There may be situations i n which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal info rmation to include in the initial report to the sponsor.  However, it is 
very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality 
for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor.
The investigator may  change his/her opi [INVESTIGATOR_19954] -up 

PF-06882961
Protocol C3421008
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 23September 2020
PFIZER CONFIDE NTIAL
Page 83information and send an SAE follow- up report with the updated causality  
assessment.
The causality  assessment is one of the criteria used wh en determining regulatory  
reporting requirements.
If the investig ator does not know whether or not the I P caused the event, then the 
event will be handled as “related to IP” for reporting purposes, as defined by  [CONTACT_103].  I n addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with 
study  procedures, th
e investigat or must record this causal re lationship in the source 
documents and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the 
CT SAE Report Form and in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
The investigator is obligated to perform or arr ange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically  indicated or as requested by  [CONTACT_55900] /or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as 
possible.  This may  include additional laboratory  tests or inve stigations, 
histopathological examinations, or consultation with other healthcare professionals.
If a participant dies during participation in the stu dy or during a recognized 
follow -
up period, the investigator wi llprovide [COMPANY_007] Safet y with a cop y of any
postmortem findings including histopathology .
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally  completed CRF.
The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours 
of recei ptof the information.
10.3.4. Reporting of SAEs
SAE Reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safety via an Electronic Data Collection Tool
The primary  mechanism for reporting an SAE to [COMPANY_007] Safety  will be the electron ic 
data collection tool.
If the electronic s ystem is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE dat a 
collection tool ( see next section) to report the event within 24 hours.
The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as the data 
become available.
After the stud y is completed at a given sit e, the electronic data collection tool wi ll 

PF-06882961
Protocol C3421008
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 23September 2020
PFIZER CONFIDE NTIAL
Page 84be taken off -line to prevent the entry  of new data or changes to existing data.
If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study  participant or receives updated 
data on a previously  reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been 
taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see 
next section) or to [COMPANY_007] Safety  by [CONTACT_756].

10.4.1. Male Participant Reproductive Inclus ion Criteria
No contraception methods are required for male participants in this study , as the calculated 
safet y margin is ≥100- fold between the estim ated maternal exposure due to semi nal transfer 
and the NOAEL for serious manifestations of developmental t oxicity  in nonclinical studies.
10.4.2. Female Participant Reproductive Inclusion Criteria
A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregn ant or breastfeeding, and at 
least 1 of the following conditions applies:
Is not a WOCBP (see definitions below in Section 
10.4.3).
OR
Is a WOCBP and using a 
contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure 
rate of <1% per year), preferably with low user dependency , as described below,
during the intervention period and for at least [ADDRESS_214700] dose of study  
intervention, which corresponds to the time needed to eliminate any study  
intervention(s).
The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in 
relationship to the first dose of study  intervention.
The investigator is responsible for review o f medical history , menstrual history , and recent
sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman wi th an earl y undetected 
pregnancy . 
10.4.3. Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal 
unless permanentl y sterile (see b elow).
If fertility  is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cy cle cannot 
beconfirmed before the first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be 
considered.
Women in the following categories are not consider ed WOCBP:
1.Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
Documente d hysterectomy ;
Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] ;
Documented bilateral oophorectom y.

Page 86For individuals with permanent infertility  due to an alternate medical cause other than 
the above, (eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity ), investigator discret ion 
should be applied to determining stud y entry .
Note: Documentation for any  of the above categories can come from the site 
personnel’s rev iew of the participant’s medical records, medical e xamination, or 
medical history  interview.   The method of documentation should be recorded in the 
participa nt’s medical record for the stud y.
2.Postmenopausal female:
A postmenopausal state is defined as age 60 years or older or no menses for 
12months withou t an alternative medical cause. 
A high follicle -stimulating horm one (FSH) level in the postmenopausal ran ge 
may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormon al 
contraception or hormone replacement therap y (HRT). 
Females on HRT and w hose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to 
use one of the nonestrogen hormonal highl y effectiv
e contraception methods 
if they  wish to continue their HRT during the stud y.  Otherwise, they  must 
discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopa usal status before study  
enrollment.
10.4.4. Contraception Methods
Highly Effective Methods That Have Low User Dep endency 
1.Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception associated wit h inhibition of 
ovulation.
2.Intrauterine device (IUD).
3.Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS).
4.Bilateral tubal occlusion.
5.Vasectomized pa rtner.
Vasectomized partner is a highl y effective contraceptive method provided that the 
partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has 
been confirmed.  If not, an additional highl y effective method of contraception 
should be used.  The spermatogenesis cy cle is approximately  90days.

6.Combin ed (estrogen- and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation:
oral;
intravaginal;
transdermal;
injectable.
7.Progestogen -only hormone contra ception associated with inhibition of ovulation:
oral;
injectable.
8.Sexual abstinence:
Sexual abstinence is considered a highl y effective method only  if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated 
with the study  intervention.  The reliability  of sexual abstine nce needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the stud y and the preferred and usual 
lifesty le of the participant.
Collection of Pregnancy Information
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy (EDP) occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or havin g been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposur e) to the IP; or the female 
becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the 
IP;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contac t 
with a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
IPprior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s 
pregnancy .

Page 88If aparticipant or participant’s partner bec omes or is found to be pregnant during the 
participant’ s treatment with the IP, the investigator must report this information to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of wh ether an 
SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding 
environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a participant reports 
that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by  [CONTACT_181891][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety  using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether 
an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The inform ation 
submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related 
to term ination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outco me.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and noti fy [COMPANY_007] Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural 
integrit y of the neo nate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a ter mination, the 
reason(s) for termination s hould be specified and, if clinically  possible, the str uctural 
integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless
preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anoma ly and the findings are 
reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or co ngenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus , an int rauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal dea th]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported to [COMPANY_007] Sa fety as SAEs 
follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_214701] 
to causality , as SAEs.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as 
SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as relate d or possibly  related to 
exposure to the IP. 
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be re quested by  [CONTACT_456].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposu re, the 
investigator will provide the participant with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information 
Form to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that 
the participant was giv en the Pregnant Partner Release of Inform ation Form to provide to his 
partner.

Use/Analysis of DNA
Genetic variation may  impact a participant’s response to study  intervention, 
susceptibility  to, and severity  and progression of disease.  Therefore, where local 
regulations and IRBs/ECs allow, a blood sample will be collected f or DNA anal ysis.
Genetic research may  consist of the analy sis of 1 or more candidate genes or the 
analysis of genetic markers throughout the genome or anal ysis of the entire genome 
(as appropriate).
The sam ples may  be analy zed as part of a multi study  asse ssment of genetic factors 
involved in the response to PF -06882961 or study  interventions of this cla ss to 
understand treatments for the disease(s) under study  or the disease(s) themselves.
The results of ge netic analy ses may  be reported in the clinical study  report (CSR) or 
in a separate study  summary , or may  be used for internal decision making without 
being included in a study report.
The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with ad equate 
measures to protect confidentiality . 
The samples will be retained as indicated:
Samples for specified genetic anal ysis (see Section 8.6.1 and Section 8.8.2 )will 
be stored indefinitel y or other period as per local requirements .
Participants may  withdraw their consent for the storage and/or use of their banked 
biospecimens at an y time by  [CONTACT_7328] a request to the investigator; in this case, an y 
remaining material will be destro yed.  Data already generated from the samples will 
be retained to protect the integrit y of existing anal yses.
Banked biospecimens will be labeled with a code.  The key  between the code and the

Page 9010.6. Appendix 6: Liver Sa fety: Suggested Actions and Follow -up Assessments 
Potential Case s of Dr ug-Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury  (as determined by  [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt 
are termed “adaptors.”  In some particip ants, t ransaminase elevations are a harbi nger of a 
more serious potential outcome.  These participants fail to adapt and therefore are 
"susceptible" to progressive and serious liver injury, c ommonl y referred to as drug -induced 
liver injury (DILI).  Partici pants w ho experience a transaminase eleva tion above 3 ×ULN 
should be monitored more frequently  to determine if they  are an “adaptor” or are 
“susceptible.”
In the majority  of DILI cases, eleva tions in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotra nsferas e (ALT) precede total bilirubin (T Bili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by  [CONTACT_74097].  The increase in TBili ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated 
above 3 ×ULN (ie, A ST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same laborato ry 
sample).  In rare instances, by  [CONTACT_177279], AST/AL T values might 
have decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal 
elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteri a outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury  
have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalit ies for a potential DILI case depe nds on the 
participant’s individual baseline values and underlying conditions.  Participants who present 
with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI 
(Hy’s law) cases to definit ively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory  values:
Participants with AST/ALT and TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently  present with AST OR AL T val ues >3 × ULN AND a TBili value 
>2×ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 
<2×ULN or not available.
For participants with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the defin ition mentioned above, as needed, 
depen ding on which values are a bove the ULN at baseline:
Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 ×ULN; or >8 ×ULN (whichever is 
smaller).
Preex isting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increa sed from 
baseline value b y an amount of a t least 1 × ULN orif the value reaches 
>3×ULN (whichever is smaller).

PF-[ADDRESS_214702]/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be asses sed 
individually  based on clinical judg ment; an y case where uncer tainty  remains as to whether it 
represent s a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor.  
The participant should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_214703] and AL T and TBili for suspected cases o f 
Hy’s law, additional laboratory  tests should include albumin, c reatine kinase (CK), direct and 
indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international 
normalized ratio (INR), total bile acids, and alkaline phosphatase.  Consideration should also 
be given to d rawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for 
further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous anal yses at the time of the recognized 
initial abnormalities to determine etiolog y.  A detailed history, including relevant 
information, such as r eview of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y itself or as a coformulated 
product in prescription or over -the-counter medications) , recreational drug, supplement 
(herbal) use and consumption, fa mily history , sexual history , travel hi story, history  of contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , blood t ransfusion, history  of liver or allergic disease, and 
potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected.  Further testing for acute 
hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliar y tract) and collection of 
serum sample f or acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels may  be warranted. 
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria of A ST/AL T and 
TBili elevation defined abov e should be considered pot ential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the liver function test (LFT) abnormalities has y et been found.  Such 
potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespect ive of availability 
of all the results of the investigations perf ormed to determine etiology of the LFT 
abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and hav e excluded an alternative etiology .

 Is the rationale for the study clearly stated and is the rationale scientifically 6 
sound?  7 
 8 
The emerging evidence of the relationship between working memory (WM) and naming [ADDRESS_1061695] current stimulation (tD CS) is a 11 
non-invasive neuromodulation tool that presents a low current that induces bi -directional 12 
polarity -dependent changes in the cortex to facilitate focal, prolonged shifts in cortical 13 
excitability at or around the time stimulation is provided 1, 2. Anodal tDCS (a -tDCS), in which 14 
the positively charged electrode is placed over the targeted cortical region, has been shown 15 
to increase cortical excitability (upregulation), similar to long -term potentiation (LTP)1-5. 16 
Combining a -tDCS with behavioral -based approaches has been suggested to enhance the 17 
learning process and increase the likelihood of retention6.  Although the re is no specific 18 
neurophysiologic evidence to identify suppression of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) [ADDRESS_1061696] been no investigations using a-tDCS to the DLPFC to  influence naming 22 
skills in non-fluent aphasia. The overarching goal of this study is to explore the relationship 23 
between WM and naming by [CONTACT_773223] a -tDCS to left DLPFC on naming 24 
accuracy and naming reaction times (RTs) in non -fluent aphasia. The primary purpose of this 25 
study is to 1) establish feasibility and safety of applying a -tDCS to the left DLPFC in patients 26 
with Broca’s aphasia combined with behavioral naming treatment.   27 
 Are the aims and corresponding hypothesis clearly stated?  28 
 29 
Aim 1:  Determine  feasibility and safety of ap plying a -tDCS to the left DLPFC in Broca’s aphasia. 30 
Two conditions: 1) a-tDCS (2mA for 20 minutes) will be applied over the left DLPFC followed 31 
immediately by [CONTACT_773224] 2) sham tDCS followed immediately by 32 
behavioral naming therapy will be presented to participants with non -fluent aphasia .  Hypothesis 33 
1: no adverse events will be reported during or following this treatment  and all participants will 34 
complete the study .   35 
 36 
Aim 2: Identify effectiveness of a -tDCS to the left DLPFC combined with behavioral naming 37 
treatment in Broca’s aphasia and e stablish a sample  size for future investigations of this nature. 38 
A small sample size will be used in this study to investigate effectiveness  of the use of a -tDCS 39 
to the left DLPFC with behavioral therapy to target naming in non -fluent aphasia. Hypothesis 2:  40 
Improvements in working memory, naming reaction time and naming accuracy will be observed 41 
after the real a -tDCS condition but  not after the sham a -tDCS condition.  42 
 43 
 44

  Is the primary outcome (and secondary outcomes, as appropriate) clearly 1 
defined?  2 
Primary outcomes include: naming accuracy on treated and control items, naming RTs  on 3 
treated and control i tems,  performance on WM tasks , and motor speech tasks .    4 
 Are there adequate preliminary data in the literature (or from the investigator) to 5 
justify the proposed research? Has an adequate literature review been done to 6 
support this study?  [ADDRESS_1061697] name. 23 
Within this context, it may be that subvocal rehearsal systems might be crucial during pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] 24 
naming processes as it functions to preserve and refresh information, facilitating convergence of 25 
activation onto targeted representation s. This becomes a useful compensatory strategy when 26 
there are lexical access and retrieval failures. However, the ability to engage in subvocal 27 
rehearsal processes are likely deficient in individuals with aphasia14 15, which impacts not only 28 
immediate treatment effects, but also long -term treatment effects since cue self -generation as a 29 
compensatory strategy would be  limited.   30 
The application of a -tDCS to the language regions in combination with behavioral -based 31 
approaches has resulted in improved language outcomes in individuals with aphasia 22-26. In 32 
addition, a -tDCS applied to the left DLPFC  has resulted in improved performance on WM tasks 33 
in healthy individuals 27, individuals with Parkinson’s Disease [ADDRESS_1061698] been 36 
no investigations to date using neuromodulation techniques to the DLPFC to target naming 37 
skills in ap hasia.  38 
 39 
 Is the question or hypothesis being tested providing important knowledge to the 40 
field?  [ADDRESS_1061699] 3 
linguistic performance 14, 34.  The addition of a -tDCS as a neuromodulation tool to increase 4 
cortical excitability (upregulate) the working memory center to target naming is a novel 5 
approach  in aphasia .  These findings, , will provide valuable information regarding the role 6 
WM plays in naming and the potential benefit of using neuromodulation to the DLPFC to 7 
influence naming in aphasia.    8 
 9 
 Is the design of the study appropriate for the questions that are posed?  10 
 11 
Treatment Design:   [ADDRESS_1061700] cross -over design with a 4 week wash out period will be used. Two treatment 13 
conditions will be presented.  The sham (SHAM) condition will consist of presentation of sham 14 
tDCS for 20 minutes followed by [CONTACT_773225]. The rea l treatment condition 15 
(REAL) will consist of 20 minutes of a -tDCS to the left DLPFC followed by [CONTACT_773226] 16 
treatment. The length of behavioral naming treatment will depend on how long each participant 17 
takes to go through the treatment stimul i twice.  A SHAM -REAL sequence will be used across all 18 
participants . Although order effects may be introduced using the same sequence across 19 
participants, the small number of participants makes it difficult to interpret any data that comes 20 
from using a counterbalan ced presentation of treatment.    21 
Treatment will be provid ed over five consecutive days. A minimum of a one -month washout 22 
period will be provided between the two conditions ( Figure 1).  Prior to initiating the REAL [ADDRESS_1061701] during the pre-treatment 24 
testing period (pri or to the initiation of the SHAM  condition) will be compared to the nam ing RTs 25 
obtained after the  washout pe riod.  RTs will be analyzed to e nsure that no lasting treatment 26 
effects remai n after the  SHAM  condition.  If performance on naming RTs is +/- [ADDRESS_1061702] 27 
deviation from the individual’s benchmark mean, the REAL treatment condition will begin. If 28 
performance on naming RTs is > +/ - [ADDRESS_1061703] deviation from the individual’s benchmark 29 
mean, REAL treatment will be postponed until the mean RTs fall within +/ - [ADDRESS_1061704], 32 
the REAL  treatment will be initiated.   33 
 34 
Outcome measures :   [ADDRESS_1061705] lists will be generated;  a different list will be used for each treatment [ADDRESS_1061706].Pretreatment testing  outcome measures  will 37 
be recorded  for 5 consecutive days  for each outcome measure including: 1) naming accu racy 2) [ADDRESS_1061707] lists 3) performance on motor speech tasks and 4) performance on 39 
working memory tasks. Stability of baseline performance, defined as no more than 20% [ADDRESS_1061708] at  the Clinical Translational Science Institute  (CTSI ) on Delaware Street on the Univer sity [ADDRESS_1061709] at the University of MN Clinical Translational Science 7 
Institute .   Each participant will be seated comfortably in a chair. A swim cap will be placed on 8 
the participant’s head to identify cranial landmarks for accurate electrode placement. The area 9 
referred to as F3 by [CONTACT_410014] 10/20 system for electroencephalogram electrode 10 
placement35 has been established as the optimal locatio n for targeting the left DLPFC8, 9, 28, 36. 11 
The F3 region will be located by [CONTACT_773227] (the  midpoint between left and right tragus 12 
and midpoint between nasion and inion), measuring the head circumference. When these 13 
measurements are entered into the Beam F3 Locator Software37, additional values are provided 14 
to reliably identify the location of F3. Once F3 has been established, two saline soaked surface 15 
sponge electrodes (352cm) will be prepare d and placed. For optimal anodal stimulation to the 16 
DLPFC, the anode will be placed over F3 and the cathode will be placed over the right 17 
supraorbital region7-9, 27. A current of 2mA will be delivered for 20 minutes 7 by a multichannel 18 
transcranial current stimulator (Starstim, Neuroelectrics Corporation; Cambridge, MA). a -tDCS 19 
will be applied before and during behavioral treatment in the design specified below.  20

Stimuli.  Eighty black -and-white line drawings will be obtained from on -line clip art websites.  27 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_773212] -speaking volunteers who will be asked to 28 
provide the names of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_499].  Cues words will be paired wi th the pi[INVESTIGATOR_773213] 29 
represent an associative or thematic relationship.  Therefore, the words will be chosen that 30 
represent a concrete attribute (e.g., the pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], SHARK, is paired with the cue word teeth ), 31 
location (e.g., the pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], SHARK, is p aired with the cue word ocean ), and either function or 32 
category (e.g., the pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], SHARK, is paired with the cue word, fish).  The selection criteria for 33 
choosing these particular attributes is based on a classification criteria of thematic relations 38.  34 
Moreover, there is empi[INVESTIGATOR_773214] a 35 
naming treatment paradigm 39.  Commonly used phrases (e.g., great white shark ) or compound 36 
words (e.g., bluefin shark ), synonyms or antonyms  will be excluded .  These cue words will be 37

 Have the validity and reliability of measures been established or are there 2 
methods proposed for establishing validity and reliability?  3 
 4 
Approximately 20% of each of the participant’s behavioral treatment sessions will be 5 
observed by [CONTACT_22888]-investigator in order to obtain procedural integrity.  Steps of th e treatment 6 
protocol will be scored using a binary (+/ -) coding system.  Point -by-point agreement will be [ADDRESS_1061714] common aphasic naming errors, definitions  and examples of each error type.  9 
Point -by-point agreement will be obtained.  10 
 11 
 Is the proposed subject population appropriate?  12 
Participants will be recruited via emails sent to Twin Cities metro area hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491] 13 
aphasia/stroke support groups.  Potential participants will then be screened for eligibility for 14 
the study.  15 
Screening. Potential p articipants will be seen for 2 -3 sessions to undergo comprehensive 16 
cognitive -linguistic assessment to determine eligibility for the study. This assessment will 17 
take pla ce within the participant’s home to provide a comfortable, natural environment for the 18 
potential participant.  Behavioral assessment measures will include  the Western Aphasia 19 
Battery ( WAB ) 43 which will be used to obtain overall language function via the  WAB Aphasia 20 
Quotient (WAB AQ), the [LOCATION_011] Naming Test (BNT) in order to obtain naming function, 44, 21 
Apraxia Battery for Adults (ABA -2) [ADDRESS_1061715] meet the following inclusionar y criteria : 25 
 a diagnosis of moderate -moderately severe non -fluent apha sia based on 26

Individuals who meet the inclusionary/ex clusionary criteria and who are still interested in [ADDRESS_1061717] been identified as eligible and consented for the study, recruitment will 5 
stop.  6 
 Are statistical considerations, including sample size and justification, estimated 7 
accrual and duration, and statistical analysis clearly describe d and adequate to 8 
meet the study objectives?  [ADDRESS_1061718] analysis techniques will be used such as visual inspection, graphica l 15 
analysis and confidence interval comparison.  16 
 17 
Aim 1 . To address the feasibility and safety aim, t he number and type of adverse events for 18 
each patient will be recorded and presented . In addition, t he number of participants who  failed 19 
to complete  the stu dy will be recorded and factors recorded. To the extent possible, the 20 
participants will be asked to continue to participate in the assessments to allow a consideration 21 
of intent to treat analysis.   22 
 23 
Aim 2 . Means and 95% confidence intervals will be plotted and used for comparison of naming [ADDRESS_1061719] (Deng, et al. 2013).   Naming accuracy performance will be analyz ed using  d [ADDRESS_1061720] size will be 27 
interpreted using benchmarks proposed by [CONTACT_719056] (2006) for lexical retrieval 28 
treatments:  small ES = 4.0, medium ES = 7.0, large ES = 10.146.  Naming RT mean and 29 
confidence intervals will be analyzed for changes within and across treatment conditions using 30 
visual inspection.   31 
 32 
 Are all the proposed tests or measurements requested necessary to answer the 33 
scientific question?  34 
Yes.  T he proposed measures will allow investigators to report the  feasibility  and safety  of 35 
the use of a -tDCS The measures will also allow investigators to identify individual treatment 36 
effects of a-tDCS to left DPFC combined with behavioral naming therapy on naming in non- 37 
fluent aphasia and through visual inspection and graphical analysis, compare effects to sham  38 
treatment. Naming RT and accuracy are sensitive  measure s of the participant’s retr ieval and 39 
learning of treated items. Motor speech performance  will allow us to track changes in motor 40 
planning and sequencing abilities, which can influence naming RT and na ming accuracy. 41 
And, performance on working memory tasks will allow for investigation of the influence of 42 
WM on naming and to provide additional evidence that a -tDCS to the left DLPFC may 43 
influence WM in individual participants.   44 
 45 
 Are the investigators well qualified to conduct this study?  [ADDRESS_1061721]. Hashimoto’s research interest involves the examination of lexical -semantic 15 
deficits in individuals with aphasia. The deficits found in these individuals are interpreted within 16 
the context of a cognitive n europsychology approach. Methodologies such as on -line measures 17 
and the more traditional assessment batteries are used to examine how various aspects of the 18 
lexical -semantic (word meaning) system operates in the brains of neurologically intact [ADDRESS_1061722]. Kimberley has  expertise in 27 
neurophysiologic mechanisms and neuromodulation (including tDCS) in healthy  individuals  and [ADDRESS_1061723] year graduate student from the Department of Communicative Disorders will be selected 12 
as a research assistant based on GPA, clinical performance and experience with patients with 13 
aphasia. The research assis tant will provide behavioral naming therapy (naïve to the treatment 14

scheduled study visit. Subjects may use analgesics after the questionnaires are completed at the study visit.  
k Sample for PK will be collected predose. See Table 5 for PK and ADA sample collection time points. 
l Tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_512187] (not optional). Tape strips will be collected from non-lesional and lesional 
skin at Day 1 and Week 16 and from lesional skin at Week 4 and Week 32. Drainage fluid may be collected (optional) at any visit after screening in which HS 
lesional drainage is present, and stored for future biomarker analysis. 
m Photography (of representative lesion[s], fistulas, and scarring) is an optional procedure for all subjects at each of the specified visits at selected site. Two 
images from two distinct regions of highest density inflammatory nodules/abscesses/fistulas should be taken at baseline if possible. The anatomic regions 
should be identifiable from the images. These regions should be recorded and consistently photographed throughout the duration of the study if possible. 
n Starting at Day 113 (Week 16), subjects who received placebo during the placebo-controlled period will be randomized 1:1 to receive imsidolimab at 1 of 
2 different regimens. Subjects who received imsidolimab during the placebo-controlled period will not be randomized at the Week 16 visit. 
o During the placebo-controlled period, subjects will receive either imsidolimab or placebo SC administered as follow according to randomization arm:1) 
400-mg dose of imsidolimab on Day 1; followed by 200-mg dose of imsidolimab on Days 29, 57, and 85; 2) 200-mg dose of imsidolimab on Day 1; followed 
by a 100-mg dose of imsidolimab on Days 29, 57, and 85; 3) placebo. The placebo-controlled period ends at the Day 113 (Week 16) visit, before study 
treatment administration. During the extension period, subjects assigned to imsidolimab during the placebo-controlled period will continue to receive the same 
maintenance dose of imsidolimab, 200 mg or 100 mg. Subjects assigned to placebo during the placebo-controlled period will receive either a 400-mg dose of 
imsidolimab on Day 113, followed by 200-mg doses of imsidolimab on Days 141, 169, and 197; or a 200 mg dose of imsidolimab on Day 113, followed by

(TEAEs) reported in subjects receiving imsidolimab or placebo, 29 subjects (81%) and 11 
subjects (92%), respectively. The most frequently reported AEs were upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4348] (URTI; 10 [28%] imsidolimab; 6 [50%] placebo), headache (10 [28%] imsidolimab; 
3 [25%] placebo), and viral URTI (4 [11%] imsidolimab; 1 [8%] placebo). Additionally, multiple 
doses of imsidolimab up to 300 mg administered by [CONTACT_512202] 4 weeks to 
18 healthy adults were also well tolerated. Overall, TEAEs occurred in 16 subjects (89%) 
receiving imsidolimab and in 3 subjects (50%) receiving the placebo. The most common AEs 
were headache (7 [39%] imsidolimab; 1 [17%] placebo) and URTI (3 [17%] imsidolimab; 1 
[17%] placebo). 
In ANB019-005, single doses of imsidolimab up to [ADDRESS_662509] 
common TEAEs were alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (3 subjects [9.4%]) and 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (2 subjects [6.3%]).  
One serious adverse event (SAE) of sepsis was reported in the recently completed ANB019-002 
study in subjects with GPP; the SAE was considered possibly related to the study drug. The 
subject had a medical history of sepsis and experienced the SAE after the [ADDRESS_662510] 
recovery. A second SAE of COVID-19 infection which was unrelated to imsidolimab was also 
reported. Further details of imsidolimab clinical studies are in the IB. 
As allergic or anaphylactic reactions may occur in any subjects treated with mAbs, subjects 
should be observed during study drug administration and for a period of 30 minutes after each 
SC drug administration. Subjects with true allergic/anaphylactic reactions should not receive 
further doses of the monoclonal antibody. Symptoms of an apparent allergic reaction to the drug, 
also known as ‘cytokine release syndrome’, vary dramatically but can include:  
 Mild to moderate fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting 
 Moderate to severe symptoms such as edema, hypotension, and pulmonary infiltrates (eg, 
blood and mucus in the lung) 
Such reactions should be managed as clinically indicated and according to standard clinical 
practice. 
 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Subjects with HS may or may not receive direct benefit from participating in this study. An 
improvement in the condition as a result of participating in the study may be observed since all 
subjects will receive the active treatment at some point during the study.

 PATIENT GLOBAL IMPRESSION OF CHANGE  
The PGIC will be assessed at the visits specified in the SoA (Section 1.3 ). The PGIC is a 
single-item, self-administered questionnaire, which asks the subject to rate the change in their 
symptom severity (“Very much better” to “Very much worse”). 
The PGIC will be completed by [CONTACT_1175] a worksheet prior to any safety and efficacy 
evaluations. The questionnaire is self-explanatory and handed to the subject who is asked to fill it 
in without the need for a detailed explanation. The PGIC (modified from Yalcin 2003 ) is 
presented in Appendix 5. 
 HIDRADENITIS SUPPURATIVA PATIENT’S GLOBAL ASSESSMENT  
The HS-PtGA asks the subject to assess how HS has influenced their quality of life. Scores are 
on a 5-point scale from ‘not at all’ to ‘extremely’, with higher scores indicating more severe 
impact on quality of life ( Kirby 2021 ). The HS-PtGA is shown in Appendix 6.  
 DERMATOLOGY LIFE QUALITY INDEX QUESTIONNAIRE 
The DLQI questionnaire will be assessed at the visits specified in the SoA (Section 1.3 ). It is a 
simple 10-question validated questionnaire (Finlay 1994; Lewis-Jones 1995 ). The DLQI score 
ranges from 0 (no effect on the subject’s life) to 30 (extremely large effect on the subject’s life), 
with higher score indicating greater impairment of quality of life.  
The DLQI will be completed by [CONTACT_1175] a worksheet prior to any safety and efficacy 
evaluations. The questionnaire is self-explanatory and will be filled in by [CONTACT_512208] a detailed explanation. The DLQI is presented in Appendix 7.  
 
 
 
 AnaptysBio, ANB019 IND 136145, SN [ADDRESS_662520] ( Kirby 2020 ). Each domain may also be scored on the following 
subscores: symptoms (0-16), activity-adaptation (0-32) and psychosocial (0-20). The 
questionnaire is presented in Appendix 8.  
The HiSQOL will be completed by [CONTACT_1175] a worksheet prior to any safety and efficacy 
evaluations. The questionnaire is self-explanatory and will be filled in by [CONTACT_512208] a detailed explanation. 
 HIDRADENITIS SUPPURATIVA PHYSICIAN’S GLOBAL ASSESMENT  
The HS-PGA (refer to Appendix 9) documents the physician’s assessment of the subject’s overall 
HS activity at a given timepoint based on the presence and relative number of HS lesions, 
drainage and pain and/or tenderness across all HS involved areas. Using the descriptors provided 
for each distinct category, the subject’s HS is assessed as inactive (0), almost inactive (1), mild 
(2), moderate (3), or severe (4). A higher score indicates more severe disease. 
 HURLEY STAGES OF HIDRADENITIS SUPPURATIVA 
The Hurley system describes 3 clinical stages of HS ( Hurley 1989; Kimball 2014 ): 
 Stage 1 – abscess formation, single or multiple, without sinus tracts and cicatrization 
 Stage 2 – single or multiple, widely separated, recurrent abscesses with tract formation 
and cicatrization 
 Stage 3 – diffuse or near-diffuse involvement, or multiple interconnected tracts and 
abscesses across the entire area. 
The participant is assigned Hurley Stage corresponding to the Hurley Stage of his or her worst 
involved anatomic region. 
 ABSCESS, INFLAMMATORY NODULE, AND DRAINING FISTULA 
COUNT 
Abscess (fluctuant, with or without drainage, tender or painful), inflammatory nodules (tender, 
erythematous, pyogenic granuloma lesion), draining fistulas, sinus tracts with communications to 
skin surface, draining purulent fluid, and other lesions (noninflammatory nodules, non-draining 
fistulas) will all be individually counted on the entire body at each visit. The AN count will be 
calculated based on the sum of the abscesses and inflammatory nodules. See the Study Manual 
for additional details. 
The location of existing lesions and draining fistulas and new occurrences should be documented 
in the eCRF.

an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, 
symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE 
if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  EVENTS NOT MEETING THE ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITION 
Events not meeting the AE definition include: 
 Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_152889]’s condition. 
 The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s 
condition. 
 Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE. 
 Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
 Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
[IP_ADDRESS] DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or AnaptysBio, it results, at any dose, in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death 
 Life-threatening adverse event  – The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of 
“serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the 
event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it 
were more severe. 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  – In general, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_512192] (usually involving at least an 
overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that 
would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. 
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious. When in doubt as 
to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered 
serious. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not 
worsen from Baseline is not considered an AE. 
 Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  – The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s 
ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include AnaptysBio, ANB019 IND 136145, SN 0059

nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which 
may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption. 
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Other important medical events  – Events that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples 
of such medical events include invasive or malignant cancers, allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
[IP_ADDRESS] CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT [IP_ADDRESS].1  SEVERITY OF EVENT 
The intensity of an AE is an estimate of the relative severity of the event. The Investigator will 
make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study based on his or 
her clinical experience and familiarity with the literature. The following definitions are to be 
used to rate the severity of an AE: 
 Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment, are easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], 
causing minimal discomfort, and do not interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
 Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning and sufficient 
discomfort to the subject. 
 Severe – Events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or 
incapacitating. Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”. An AE 
that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity of an event, and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as 
severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined 
outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_662521] based on temporal relationship and his or her clinical 
judgment. Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be 
considered and investigated. The Investigator will also consult the IB in his or her assessment. 
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical 
study, the study treatment must always be suspect.  AnaptysBio, ANB019 IND 136145, SN 0059

Protocol ANB019-208 24 September 2021 
Confidential and proprietary. Permission should be obtained before any reproduction.   68  Unrelated  – Clinical event incontrovertibly not related to the study treatment.  
 Unlikely to be related  – Clinical event with an incompatible time relationship to study 
treatment administration which makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which an 
underlying condition or other drugs or chemicals provides plausible explanations.  
 Possibly related  – Clinical event with a reasonable time relationship to study treatment 
administration, and that is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent condition or other drugs 
or chemicals.  
 Related – Clinical event with plausible time relationship to study treatment 
administration and that cannot be explained by [CONTACT_383056].  
For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must document in the medical notes that he or she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred, and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the pharmacovigilance unit. However, it is very 
important that the Investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to the pharmacovigilance unit within 24 hours of awareness 
of the event. 
The Investigator may change his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information and 
send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment. 
The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  EXPECTEDNESS  The pharmacovigilance unit will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or 
unexpected as interpreted through the IB. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, 
severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously 
described for the study treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study 
visits and interviews of a study subject presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study 
monitor. 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions will be captured on the appropriate eCRF. 
Information to be collected includes event description, date of onset, clinician’s assessment of 
severity, seriousness, relationship to study treatment (assessed only by [CONTACT_10263] a diagnosis), action taken, and outcome of the event. All AEs occurring 
while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship (see Section 
[IP_ADDRESS].2). All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution or stabilization. AnaptysBio, ANB019 IND 136145, SN [ADDRESS_662522]’s medical condition(s) 
present prior to the informed consent signature [CONTACT_178491]. During the study, study site personnel will note any change in the condition(s) and the 
occurrence and nature of any AE. Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs 
and/or SAEs. Open-ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred 
method to inquire about AE occurrences. 
Should a subject experience an AE at any time after the screening visit informed consent 
signature [CONTACT_512248], the event will be recorded as an AE in the 
source document and eCRF. Any SAE related to the study participation (eg, screening procedure) 
will be recorded in the source document and eCRF from the time consent is given to participate 
in the study until the end of participation in the study (EOS/ET visit).  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after conclusion of the study 
participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after 
a subject has been discharged from the study, and he or she considers the event to be reasonably 
related to the study treatment or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the 
pharmacovigilance unit.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened will be considered 
as medical history and not reported as an AE. However, if the study subject’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE/SAE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
The Investigator is responsible for appropriate medical care of subjects during the study. After 
the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each subject at 
subsequent visits/contacts. The Investigator also remains responsible for following through with 
an appropriate health care option for all AEs that are ongoing at the end of the study. The subject 
should be followed until the event is resolved or stable. If an AE is ongoing at the end of study, 
the follow-up duration is left to the discretion of the Investigator. Follow-up frequency will be 
performed at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Whenever possible, clinically significant abnormal laboratory results are to be reported using the 
diagnostic that resulted in the clinically significant abnormal laboratory results and not the actual 
abnormal test. 
[IP_ADDRESS] ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all documentation 
(eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. 
The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information (including event term, start 
and stop dates, severity, relationship to study treatment, outcome, if serious or non-serious) in the 
eCRF. Each event must be recorded separately. AnaptysBio, ANB019 IND 136145, SN [ADDRESS_662523]’s medical records to

There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_512193]. In this case, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the subject 
number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_512194]. 
The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual 
signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. 
The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_512209]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as 
possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. 
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  Prompt notification by [CONTACT_512210] a 
study treatment under clinical investigation are met. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to 
the pharmacovigilance unit within [ADDRESS_662524] been met. 
AnaptysBio or designee has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority 
and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation. 
or designee will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/EC, and Investigators. 
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected SAEs according to local 
regulatory requirements and pharmacovigilance unit policy, and forwarded to Investigators as 
necessary. 
An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the pharmacovigilance unit will review 
and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/EC, if appropriate according to local 
requirements.  AnaptysBio, ANB019 IND 136145, SN [ADDRESS_662525] dies while participating in the study, the Investigator will provide the 
pharmacovigilance unit with a copy of any postmortem findings.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  REPORTING VIA AN ELECTRONIC DATA COLLECTION TOOL  
The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to the pharmacovigilance unit will be the 
electronic data capture (EDC) clinical database. 
If the electronic system is unavailable, then the study site will use the back-up paper SAE Report 
Form. The study site will then enter the SAE data into the EDC system as soon as it becomes 
available. 
After the study is completed and the database is locked, the tooled system will be taken off-line 
to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. 
If a study site receives a report of a new SAE from a subject or receives updated data on a 
previously reported SAE after the EDC system is locked, then the study site can report this 
information on a paper SAE form and email the form to the pharmacovigilance unit. 
Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in SAE form and Safety Reporting Instructions that 
will be provided to the study sites.

Not applicable. 
[IP_ADDRESS] REPORTING OF PREGNANCY  
If a female subject or a female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the study and 
up to [ADDRESS_662527] should inform the study site as soon as 
possible. 
If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the pharmacovigilance unit within 
24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 1 . 
If a pregnancy occurs, it will be followed up to determine the outcome, but no longer than 6 to 
8 weeks after the estimated delivery date, where consent has been obtained to do so. AnaptysBio, ANB019 IND 136145, SN 0059

[IP_ADDRESS] TREATMENT OF OVERDOSE  
For this study, any dose of imsidolimab or placebo administered in a volume exceeding the 
planned dosing detailed in Table 3 (Dose Strength[s]/Dosage Level[s]) will be considered an 
overdose. 
In the improbable event of a suspected overdose, the following procedures should be executed: 
 Administration is to be discontinued. 
 The subject is to be monitored clinically. 
 Supportive measures are to be undertaken as clinically indicated. 
 Electrocardiography and clinical laboratory evaluations (ie, blood glucose, hepatic 
enzymes, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase (CK), and complete blood 
count) are to be performed and followed until all values return to Baseline levels and AEs 
subside, if applicable. 
No information on overdose, maximum tolerated dose, or dose-limiting toxicities for 
imsidolimab has been established at this time and since there are no known antidotes for 
imsidolimab, the treatment of overdose is at Investigator’s discretion. 
In the event of an overdose, the Investigator should: 
1. Contact [CONTACT_27465]. 
1. Closely monitor the subject for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities and follow-up 
until resolution. 
2. Obtain a serum sample for PK analysis soon after the dose for SC administration. 
3. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in the 
eCRF. 
Decisions regarding dose interruptions will be made by [CONTACT_512211]. 
 HEIGHT AND WEIGHT 
Height (cm) and weight (kg) will be collected to calculate the body mass index (BMI). Height 
and weight will be measured at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 1.3 ). 
 CHEST X-RAY 
Bidirectional posterior-anterior and lateral view chest X-ray will be performed at screening 
(Section 1.3 ). If a chest X-ray was performed within 6 months of screening and no clinically 
significant abnormality was observed, it can be skipped at screening.

 PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS 
Complete physical examinations will be performed at the time points indicated in the SoA 
(Section 1.3 ). 
A complete physical examination will include assessments of general appearance; skin; 
head/neck; pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, lymphatic, and musculoskeletal system; 
extremities; eyes; nose; throat; and neurologic status. The indication under study, hidradenitis 
suppurativa, should not be reported as part of the physical examination. 
A detailed examination of the skin should be performed at the time points indicated in the SoA 
for the efficacy assessments (eg, AN count). 
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 
 VITAL SIGNS 
Body temperature (°C), pulse rate (bpm), blood pressure (mmHg), and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] 
(breath/min) will be assessed at the time points specified in SoA (Section 1.3 ). 
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be assessed in a seated position with a completely automated 
device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. 
Assessments should be preceded by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_662528] in a quiet setting 
without distractions (eg, television, cell phones). 
Vital signs including body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and pulse rate (after at least [ADDRESS_662529]) should be measured once. Arterial blood pressure should be measured once, using a 
validated device, and recorded in the eCRF. 
 ELECTROCARDIOGRAMS 
A single 12-lead ECG will be obtained at the time points specified in the SoA (see Section 1.3 ) 
using a validated ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures RR, PR, 
QRS, QT, and QTcF intervals. 
Additional information will be provided in a separate manual. 
The ECG will be reviewed by [CONTACT_512212]. 
The ECG individual data (including clinical significance that will be reported as AE) will be 
entered into the electronic data capture (EDC).

The measurement of the concentrations of imsidolimab will be performed using a validated assay 
method under the supervision of AnaptysBio. The analytical methods used to measure 
concentrations of imsidolimab will be described in a separate bioanalytical report. 
Only samples within the stability window of the assay will be analyzed.   
While PK samples must be collected from subjects randomized to the placebo arm to maintain 
the blinding of treatment assignment, PK assay results for these subjects are not needed for the 
safe conduct or proper interpretation of this study. These samples may not be analyzed unless 
needed to investigate if a dosing error has occurred. Personnel at the bioanalytical laboratory 
performing PK assays will be unblinded, the clinical study team members, and study site staff 
(with the exception of the unblinded Pharmacist) will remain blinded to treatment for the 
duration of the study. Data may be de-identified for quality review. Additional details on de-
identification or unblinding of the PK data, if applicable, will be described in a separate plan. 
Drug concentration information that may unblind the study will not be reported to study sites or 
blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded.

The detection and characterization of antibodies to imsidolimab will be performed using a 
validated assay method by [CONTACT_512214].  
Serum samples will be tested in a multi-tiered approach. A validated screening assay for 
antibodies binding to imsidolimab initially will be used to assess serum samples. Samples that 
are determined putative positive in the screening assay then will be subjected to a confirmatory 
assay to demonstrate that antibodies are specific to imsidolimab. Samples that are identified as 
positive in the confirmatory assay will be further characterized in a validated titer assay and the 
titer of confirmed positive samples will be reported. Other analyses may be performed to verify 
the stability of antibodies to study treatment and/or to further characterize the immunogenicity of 
study treatment.  
Samples that are confirmed positive for antibodies binding to imsidolimab may be further 
characterized for their ability to neutralize the activity of the study treatment using a validated 
neutralizing antibody assay method and the presence and/or titer of ADA may be correlated to 
safety and PK data.

A tabular presentation of the subject disposition will be provided. It will include the number of 
subjects screened, randomized, treated, completed as well as the number of dropouts with 
reasons for discontinuation, and major protocol deviations or violations. 
A listing will be presented to describe dates of screening, assigned treatment, screen failed with 
reason, completion or early withdrawal, and the reason for early discontinuation, if applicable, 
for each subject. A list of protocol deviations/violations will be identified and discussed with the 
Investigator/AnaptysBio in dry run to categorize as major or minor with decisions of exclusion 
from analysis sets prior to unblinding. 
During the COVID-[ADDRESS_662532] characteristics obtained at Baseline will be summarized for all subjects taking 
imsidolimab or placebo. 
Summaries will include descriptive statistics for continuous variables (sample size [n], mean, 
SD, median, minimum, and maximum) and for categorical variables (n, frequency, and 
percentage). 
Medical history will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
latest version and listed for all subjects.

To handle the issue of rescue medication use, the efficacy data on and after the use rescue 
medication will be set to missing in the efficacy analysis. 
 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from Baseline in AN count at Week 16.  
The primary estimand, comprising four components, is defined as follows: 
a) The target population consists of subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa who are eligible 
to be included in the clinical trial based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria in the protocol. 
The ITT analysis set will include all randomized subjects. For the analysis, treatment will 
be assigned based upon the treatment arm to which subjects are randomized regardless of 
which treatment they receive.  
b) The primary variable is the change from baseline in AN count of an individual subject at 
Week 16.   
c) To handle intercurrent events such as use of rescue medications, the hypothetical strategy 
for estimand will be used. Data collected following receipt of rescue medication (if any) 
will be considered missing in the analysis.  
d) The population-level summary measures will be the population mean differences in the 
primary variable between each dose of imsidolimab and placebo at Week 16. 
A general linear mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis will be used to 
estimate the least squares means (LSM) and associated standard errors for the change from 
Baseline in AN count to Week 16. The model will include change from Baseline in AN count at 
Week 16 as the dependent variable, fixed effects for treatment arm, categorical time point, and 
the treatment by [CONTACT_101839], and the Baseline AN count and stratification factor (ie, 
Hurley Stage at baseline (Stage II or III)) as covariates. An unstructured covariance structure will 
be used. The difference between LSMs (imsidolimab – placebo) at Week 16 will be presented 
along with the associated 90% CI and p-value. The ITT analysis set will be used for the primary 
efficacy analysis. 
 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS 
The ITT analysis set will be used for analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints. Following are the 
secondary efficacy endpoints: 
 Percent change from Baseline in AN count at Week 16 
 Proportion of subjects achieving HiSCR50 at Week 16

between treatments (imsidolimab – placebo) will be presented along with exact 90% CIs. 
Treatment arms will be compared using Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel chi-squared test, adjusted for 
stratification factor (Hurley Stage at baseline (Stage II or III)). 
[IP_ADDRESS] CONTINUOUS ENDPOINTS Summary statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_78488]. A by-subject listing will be 
presented for each assessment, by [CONTACT_765]. Mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) method 
for longitudinal continuous data will be used for testing, with treatment group as main effect, 
with visit and interaction of treatment by [CONTACT_512218], and with baseline values and 
stratification factor (Hurley Stage at baseline [Stage II or III]) as covariates.

the subjects who entered the extension period will also be analyzed by [CONTACT_512219]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
A TEAE is defined as: 
 A new event that occurs during or after first dose of study treatment or, 
 Any event present at Baseline that worsens in either intensity or frequency after first dose 
of study treatment. 
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA and only TEAEs will be summarized. Number 
of events and percentage will be tabulated by [CONTACT_11702] (PT) and primary system organ class 
(SOC). Multiple occurrences of an AE for a subject will only be counted once per primary SOC 
and PT. Percentages will be determined relative to the subjects in the Safety Analysis Set for the 
given treatment arm. 
If the intensity or seriousness of the AE changes, the overall intensity or seriousness will be the 
maximum intensity or seriousness of the multiple occurrences. The TEAEs, SAEs, TEAEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation, and TEAEs leading to withdrawal of subject will be 
tabulated for each treatment arm. 
All AE data will be listed for each subject. 
Summaries over SOC and PT of TEAEs, TEAEs leading to death, SAEs, and TEAEs that led to 
discontinuation from the study or study treatment will be presented by [CONTACT_3148]. Summaries will 
also be presented by [CONTACT_512220]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] 12-LEAD ELECTROCARDIOGRAM, VITAL SIGNS, AND CLINICAL SAFETY LABORATORY TESTS 
Summaries and listings of data for vital signs and safety laboratory tests result (hematology, 
biochemistry, and urinalysis) will be presented. Appropriate descriptive statistics will be 
summarized for the observed value at each scheduled assessment and for the corresponding 
change from Baseline. 
For hematology and biochemistry tests, listings of subject data will also flag up any abnormal or 
out-of-range values. Clinically significant changes in the laboratory test parameters will be 
summarized and listed. Hematology and biochemistry data will be reported in System 
International units. AnaptysBio, ANB019 IND 136145, SN [ADDRESS_662534] results.

All ECG data results (normal/abnormal) will be summarized using frequency and percentage, 
and parameter values will be summarized descriptively. Clinically significant abnormalities will 
be presented in by-subject listings. 
 PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES 
Limited imsidolimab PK analysis will be evaluated by [CONTACT_512221]. These drug concentrations will be listed and summarized for each sampling time point 
using appropriate descriptive statistics. Due to limited PK sampling, noncompartmental analysis 
(NCA) will not be conducted in this study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] DERIVATION OF PHARMACOKINETIC PARAMETERS Due to limited PK sampling, NCA will not be conducted in this study. Thus, PK parameters will 
not be derived. 
[IP_ADDRESS] PHARMACOKINETIC CONCENTRATION DATA ANALYSIS 
A subject listing of all concentration-time data following SC injections will be presented by 
[CONTACT_512222]. 
Concentration data of imsidolimab will be summarized by [CONTACT_512223], arithmetic mean, SD, CV, minimum, median, maximum, and geometric 
mean. 
Graphs for mean concentration-time data following SC administration will be presented. 
Individual subject concentration-time plots will also be presented. 
Mean trough concentrations-time data will be graphically displayed for samples collected at the 
visits specified in the SoA (Section 1.3) to visually assess time to attainment of steady state. 
Time to steady state may also be explored by [CONTACT_512224], if deemed appropriate. 
Other presentations of data may be added at the discretion of the PK scientist, as appropriate, and 
will be described in detail in a separate analysis plan. 
[IP_ADDRESS] PHARMACOKINETIC PARAMETER DATA ANALYSIS No analysis will be performed on PK parameters. 
[IP_ADDRESS] POPULATION PHARMACOKINETICS ANALYSIS 
Pharmacokinetic data from the study may also be used for population PK and/or exposure-
response analyses. The data may be combined with PK data from other ANB019 studies, if  AnaptysBio, ANB019 IND 136145, SN [ADDRESS_662535] the population PK analysis. If done, a separate analysis plan will be prepared, 
and results will be reported separately from the Clinical Study Report. 
[IP_ADDRESS] IMMUNOGENICITY ANALYSES 
Observed values for ADA levels/status will be listed by-subject and summarized with descriptive 
statistics based on the Safety Analysis Set. If data permits, potential correlation may be analyzed 
between ADA levels, serum concentration, and safety and efficacy endpoints. 
 In addition, ADA incidences (overall, treatment-emergent, and treatment-boosted) will be listed 
and summarized. 
 BIOMARKER ANALYSES 
Tape strip biomarkers (including but not limited to IL-36R and Th-17 cytokine) analysis will be 
performed by a third party designated by [CONTACT_512216]. A separate analysis plan will be created for 
the biomarker analyses. 
 PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSIS  
Interim analyses (IA) may be performed for assessment of all primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints, and evaluation of all safety data available.  
The rationale for these analyses is to assist in making decisions for potential future development 
of this treatment. No adjustments to the current protocol are planned as a result of the interim 
analyses; therefore, overall alpha in the analyses of the primary analysis is expected to be 
maintained at 0.10, two-sided.

Institutional Review Board regulations [US 21CFR, Part 56.103]).  
Access to all records, both during the study and after study completion, should be made available 
to AnaptysBio at any time for review and audit to ensure the integrity of the data. The 
Investigator must notify AnaptysBio immediately if the responsible IRB/EC has been 
disqualified or if proceedings leading to disqualification have begun.  
The Investigator must conduct the protocol in accordance with applicable GCP regulations and 
guidelines; applicable informed consent regulations (US 21CFR, Part 50); and in compliance 
with the Declaration of Helsinki. Every attempt must be made to follow the protocol and to 
obtain and record all data requested for each subject at the specified times. If data are not 
recorded per protocol, the reasons must be clearly documented on the eCRF/records.  
Before study initiation, at a study site initiation visit or at a meeting with the Investigator(s), a 
representative from AnaptysBio will review the protocol and study eCRFs with the 
Investigator(s) and their staff. During the study, the study monitor will visit the study site 
regularly to check the completeness of subject records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, the 
adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that consent is 
being sought and obtained in compliance with applicable regulations, and that the study drug is 
being stored, dispensed and accounted for according to specifications.  
The Investigator and key study personnel must be available to assist the monitor during these 
visits. The Investigator must give the monitor access to relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_893], to 
confirm their consistency with the eCRF entries. No information in these records about the 
identity of the subjects will leave the study site.  
Monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and the recording of primary efficacy 
and safety variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the eCRFs will 
be performed according to the study-specific Monitoring Plan.  
The Investigator must promptly complete the eCRFs after the subject’s visit. The monitor is 
responsible for reviewing them and clarifying and resolving any data queries. A copy of the 
eCRFs will be retained by [CONTACT_512228] a secure place 
with other study documents, such as the protocol, the IB, and any protocol amendments.

 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
[IP_ADDRESS] DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
All protocol-specified data will be recorded in site source documents. Study data will be entered 
within the clinical database eCRFs from the original source documents. Upon each subject’s 
completion of the study, the Investigator is required to sign and affirm the data entered in the 
subject CRF along with a statement attesting that all pages of the subject’s case report have been 
reviewed. All Investigator data attestation signatures will be made through the 21 CFR Part 11 
compliant EDC system. Signature [CONTACT_78670] “per signatures” are not acceptable. 
It is AnaptysBio’s policy that study data be verifiable with the source data which necessitates 
access to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and other records for each subject. The 
Investigator must therefore agree to allow access to subjects’ records, and source data must be 
made available for all study data. Subjects (or their legal representatives) must also allow access 
to their medical records. Subjects will be informed of the importance of increased record access 
and permission granted by [CONTACT_512229].  
Checks will be performed to ensure quality, consistency, and completeness of the data. Instances 
of missing or uninterpretable data will be resolved with the Investigator or study coordinator. 
Data queries, documented within the clinical database, will be accessible to the research facility 
through the EDC system. Study site personnel will be responsible for providing resolutions to the 
data queries and for correcting the eCRFs, as appropriate. 
The Investigator must keep written or electronic source documents for every subject participating 
in the clinical study. For the appropriate document retention period. The subject file that 
identifies the study in which the subject is participating must include the subject’s available

In addition, male subjects must refrain from donating sperm for the duration of the study and for 
220 days (which includes the duration of relevant exposure plus the duration of sperm cycle) 
after the last dose of study treatment. 
Male subjects with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from 
penile-vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each epi[INVESTIGATOR_512196] 220 days (which includes the duration of relevant exposure plus 
the duration of sperm cycle) after the last dose of study treatment. 
Female subjects 
Female subjects of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use highly 
effective methods of contraception consistently and correctly as described in the table below and 
during the protocol-defined time frame in Section 5.[ADDRESS_662544] be used 
without schedule changes and in steady doses during the study treatment. Starting hormonal

Vasectomized Partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that the partner is the sole 
male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional 
highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
Sexual Abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the subject.

with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for subjects participating in clinical studies.   
Pregnancy Testing: 
Women of childbearing potential should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period and 
a negative highly sensitive serum pregnancy test at screening and urine pregnancy test on Day 1 
(prior to study treatment administration). 
Additional pregnancy testing should be performed as mentioned in the SoA (Section 1.3 ). 
Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is 
otherwise suspected. Positive urine pregnancy test result should be confirmed with serum test. 
Collection of Pregnancy Information AnaptysBio, ANB019 IND 136145, SN [ADDRESS_662545]’s female 
partner who becomes pregnant while the male subject is in this study. This applies only to male 
subjects who receive study treatment. 
After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner directly, 
the Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate pregnancy form and 
submit it to the pharmacovigilance unit within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. 
The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information 
on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to AnaptysBio. Generally, the follow-up 
will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the 
pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or 
indication for the procedure.  
Any SAEs associated with the pregnancy in the male subject’s partner should also be reported to 
the pharmacovigilance unit within [ADDRESS_662546]’s 
pregnancy. The subject will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
Investigator will collect follow-up information on the subject and the neonate and the 
information will be forwarded to AnaptysBio. Generally, follow-up will not be required for 
longer than 6 to 8 weeks after the delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, 
regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is 
always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. 
Any poststudy pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the study treatment by 
[CONTACT_512239] [IP_ADDRESS] . While the 
Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former subjects, he or she may 
learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.

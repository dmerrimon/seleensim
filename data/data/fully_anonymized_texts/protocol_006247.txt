Objectives  This study will assess the efficacy of the oral, small molecule, multi -
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor MGCD516 in patients with 
unresectable or metastatic well-differentiated and de -differentiated 
liposarcoma  by [CONTACT_436115] [ADDRESS_552344] of such changes on  drug

Statistical 
Methodology  The primary endpoint is the progression free rate (PFR) at 12 weeks. 
This corresponds to the number of patients who are alive and without 
evidence of disease progressio n at 12 weeks  out of all evaluable 
patients . On the basis of historical controls  (see s ection 15),  a PFR 
greater than 40% at 12 weeks is associated with active second line  
agents in sarc oma and considered promising , whereas a PFR less tha n 
20% at [ADDRESS_552346] stage, the study will be expanded 
to a total of 29  liposarcoma  patients. If a total of 9 or more liposarcoma 
patients demonstrate the PFR  endpoint, the agent will be considered 
promising in liposarcoma  and worthy of further study . This design 
provides for a type 1 error o f 0.10 and type 2 error of 0.14. The study 
design has a power of 85% to  detect a difference between a PFR  of 
20% versus 40% at [ADDRESS_552347] Recruitment  ................................ ................................ ............................... 39

MGCD516 Sarcoma Phase II  13 1.INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be  conducted according 
to US and I nternational standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and 
International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and 
Columbia University Medical Center i nstitutional resear ch policies and procedures.  
1.[ADDRESS_552351] common subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma include gastrointestinal stromal tumor 
(GIST), liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath 
tumor (MPNST). The more c ommon bone tumors include osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma  and 
the Ewing’s family of  tumors . The primary management for most localized sarcomas is surgical 
resection  when feasible . Unfortunately, therapeutic options for patients with metastatic or 
unresectable disease remain limited. The various subtypes of sarcoma differ greatly in their 
clinical and molecular characteristics as well as response to traditional cytotoxic agents and 
radiotherapy.  Outcomes  are generally poor  in advanced disease , with doxorubicin or the 
combination of gemc itabine and docetaxel eliciting objective responses i n about 25% of patients, 
with median overall survival from the diagnosis of metastatic dis ease limited to [ADDRESS_552352], and amplification of CDK4 and MDM2 in well -differentiated/de -differentiated 
liposarcomas5. However, f or the majority of patients with advanced sarcomas, outc omes remain  
disappointing, and new approaches are urgently needed.  
Complex organisms rely on cell -cell communication, largely conveyed by [CONTACT_436117], to convey critical messages, including those related to growth, division, survi val, 
motility and changes in cell shape. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play the critical role in 
transducing these extracellular signals into the cell where they elicit an array of biologic 
responses. The prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_436079] N terminal domain e xtending into the extracellular 
space which functions in ligand binding. The middle segment of the RTK protein contains a 
transmembrane domain composed of hydrophobic amino acids. The C -terminal domain extends 
into the cytoplasm and contains the RTK’s tyro sine kinase activity, which phosphorylates 
tyrosine residues on various cytoplasmic proteins, resulting in activation of various signaling  
pathways and downstream processes. Most RTKs function as heterodimers or homodimers, with 
dimerization often induced by [CONTACT_436118]. The cytoplasmic kinase domains then 
phosphorylate each other resulting in a change in the conformation of the catalytic cleft, allowing 
substrates to bind.  
RTKs may be dysregulated by [CONTACT_436119], point mutations, increased transcription or 
MGCD516 Sarcoma Phase II  [ADDRESS_552353], 53% of patients 
demonstrated objective tumor shrinkage7 and, f ollow ing the introduction of imatinib, median 
overall survival in advanced GIST improved from 11 to 57 months8. Patients progressing on 
imatinib benefit when treated with the multi -targeted RTK inhibitor sunitinib, which acts on 
vascular endothelial growth fac tor receptor ( VEGFR ), platelet derived  growth factor receptor  
alpha (PDGFR a), c-KIT and FLT39.  
The RTKs VEGFR and PDGFR play an important role in angiogenesis, and are often 
dysregulated by [CONTACT_436120]. 
Moreover, PDGFR plays an important role in normal cells of mesenchymal origin. A number of 
studies have documented  VEGF and VEGFR overexpression in various sarcomas and expression 
often correlates with clinical outcomes10. Bevacizumab , a mo noclona l antibody against VEGFR , 
has received regulatory approval for its activity  in various settings, including advanced colon 
and lung cancers. Solitary fibrous tumor, previously termed hemangiopericytoma, is an 
uncommon soft tissue sarcoma that characteristic ally demonstrates prominent ectatic  blood 
vessels and is traditionally resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy. A phase II study of the 
combination of bevacizumab  and temozolomide demonstrated favorable results in this sarcoma 
subtype, with a median progression free survival of [ADDRESS_552354] been implicated in tumorigenesis across 
MGCD516 Sarcoma Phase II  15 the various soft tissue and bone sarcomas, including IGF1 -R, MET , Axl, RET  and others. The 
role of RTKs in sarcoma has been reviewed in detail elsewhere13. In numerous cases, 
overexpression of these various RTKs correlates with worsened clinical outcomes. In 
undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, for example, overexpression of MET has been obse rved 
in up to 40% of tumors and dysregulation of the downstream targets MEK and AKT is 
associated with worse survival14. Using expression profiling and tissue microarray validation 
linked to patient clinical data, expression of RET, IGF -1 and IGF -2 was fou nd to correlate with 
clinical outcomes in myxoid liposarcoma.15 Phosphorylated forms of KIT and PDGFRb are 
overexpressed in synovial sarcoma16. The role of IGF -1R in bone tumors, such as osteosarcoma 
and Ewing sarcoma, has been supported by [CONTACT_436121] o and in vivo models17. Axl has 
recently been shown to be overexpressed in Ewing sarcoma where this RTK  plays  a role in cell 
viability and migration18. Furthermore, Axl, EphB2, FGFR2 and RET were recently implicated 
in osteosarcoma pathogenesis in additio n to established roles for PDGFR and VEGFR.19 In clear 
cell sarcoma, the EWS -ATF1 fusion gene has been shown  to activate transcription of MET, and 
MET inhibition has shown  important clinical effects  in preclinical models20.  
One recent study attempted to identify a role for driver receptor tyrosine kinases in sarcoma cell 
lines and xenografts using a novel phosphoproteomics strategy21. Phosphotyrosine peptide 
immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_436080]/MS to identify phosphoryla ted tyrosine kinases in 
a collection of sarcoma cell lines including osteosarcoma (MNNG, U2OS, MG63, Saos2), 
rhabdomyosarcoma (RD18, A204), leiomyosarcoma (SK -LMS1), fibrosarcoma (HT1080), and 
Ewing’s sarcoma (RD -ES and A673). In this analysis, numerous ph osphorylated receptor 
tyrosine kinases were identified including EGFR, several Ep h and FGFR receptors, IGF -1R, 
KIT, MET and PDGFRa, among others, with expression levels confirmed by [CONTACT_27187]. A 
panel of existing TKIs was then used against particular ce ll lines based on the 
phosphopro teomics results and siRNA techniques were used to  demonstrate the driver role for 
the proposed kinases. Using this approach, PDGFRa was imp licated in rhabdomyosarcomas, 
MET in osteosarcomas, and IGF -1R in Ew ing’s sarcoma.  
Nonetheless, antibodies and small molecule inhibitors of RTKs have not always been successful 
in clinical trials  in sarcoma . In a single center study of 36 patients with advanced soft tissue or 
bone sarcoma treated with the anti -EGFR monoclonal antibody ce tuximab, progression -free 
survival (PFS) was poor, even in the subgroup of patients demonstrating  EGFR overexpression 
by [CONTACT_9064], where [ADDRESS_552355] 4%22. In a multi -arm phase II study 
cohorted by [CONTACT_436122] a Simon two-stage design, clinical activity of sorafenib 
was suggested only in angiosarcomas, with minimal evidence of activity in other sarcoma 
subtypes23. The use of anti -IGF-1R agents, including the monoclonal antibodies cixutumumab 
and R1507, have also de monstrate d unimpressive results24.  
Explanations for  these modest results likely  include the activation of compensatory pathways to 
overcome inhibition by a narrowly targeted  RTK  inhibitor and failure to select for a subgroup of 
tumor types mo st likely to respond to the targeted agent. This experience suggests that a more 
broadly targeted agent demonstrating clinically relevant inhibition of a selected group of RTKs 
strongly implicated in tumorigenesis  may be more clinically effective, and also reinforces the 
need for correlative studies to understand mechanisms of drug action and resistance.  
MGCD516 Sarcoma Phase II  [ADDRESS_552356] several clinically relevant MET mutants. The drug did 
not show signifi cant inhibitory activity of  intracellula r tyrosine kinases or  serine t hreonine 
kinases.  
The anti -tumor efficacy of MGCD516 was studied in 17 human tumor xenograft models in 
human cancer types with dysregulation of  receptor tyrosine kinases . The drug showed  tumor 
growth regression or inhibition as compared vehicle control in all of these models evaluated at 
doses ranging from 1 .25 to 20 mg/kg/day, with all dose levels well tolerated . Drug efficacy 
ranged from partial growth inhibition to robust cytoreduction. At the 20 mg/kg/day dose, near 
complete tumor  growth inhibition  was seen in several models , several  of which had  underlyi ng 
genetic alterations  in at least one of the drug’s targets. Anti -tumor efficacy and frank regression 
were  also observed a t lower dose levels.  
1.[ADDRESS_552357] aimed to identify RTKs 
highly expressed in common sarcoma subtypes, followed by [CONTACT_436123]516 both in 
vitro and in vivo.  In an initial analysis, basal expression of a set of receptor ty rosine kinases was 
assessed by W estern immunoblotting in a subset of sarcoma cell lines. These sarcoma cell lines 
included osteosarcoma (Saos2), Ewing sarcoma (A673, CHP100), dedifferentiated liposarcoma 
(DDLS, LS141), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and synovial sarcoma 
(SYO -1).  
A range of RTKs were tested for basal expression and includ ed Axl, PDGFR, IGF -1R, FGFR2, 
KIT, Eph, VEGFR, RET and MET, among others. Basal expression levels are  shown in figure 
1A across the cell types . Based on basal expression patterns, five cell lines were chosen for 
further study based on their expression of the most RTKs: A673, DDLS, LS141, MPNST and 
Saos2. All of these five cell lines showed expression of EphA 1, EphB4 and VEGFR1, but 
expression of the other tested RTKs varied by [CONTACT_436124]. For example, DDLS, LS141 and Saos2 
appeared to showed relatively high levels of IGF -1R expression, MPNST showed significant 
levels of PDGFRa. LS141, and to a lesser extent, A [ADDRESS_552358] showed evidence of phosphorylated EGFR.  
Figure 1 A (left) and B  (right)  
The antiproliferative activity of MGCD516 was then explored in the five chosen cell lines: 
A673, DDLS, LS141, MPNST and Saos2.  All cell lines were found to be sensitive to the drug in 
a concentration -dependent manner (figure 2a). IC 50 values for the three sensitive cell lines 
(DDLS, MPNST, and LS141) ranged from 250 -750 nmol/L, and for the less sensitive cell lines 
(A673 and Saos 2) ranged from 1.5 -2.0 micromolar/L.

MGCD516 Sarcoma Phase II  19 This inhibition of phosphorylation of target kinases was also confirmed by [CONTACT_51213] -RTK 
proteome profiler analysis (figure 3). Again, MGCD51 [ADDRESS_552360] imatinib and crizotinib, two other multi -
kinase in hibitors with some target RTK  overlap with MGCD516 (figure 4). MGCD516 was 
evaluated as compared these agents in the DDLS, LS141 and MPNST cell lines using [ADDRESS_552361] profound differences seen in the dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell line  (figure 5) . 

MGCD516 Sarcoma Phase II  21 Figure 5  
To demonstrate a driver role in tumorigenesis  for the proposed kinases, siRNA mediated kinase 
knockdown was carrie d out in the various cell lines and compared with the effects of MGCD516 
itself (figure 6 ).  
DDLS and MPNST showed higher basal levels of MET and PDGFRb, whereas the LS41 cell 
line showed higher basal levels of IGFR -[ADDRESS_552362] imatinib and crizotinib. The treatment resulted in no toxicity to 
the animals as m easured by [CONTACT_330063] (figure 7b and 7 c). In both xenograft models, treatment 
with MGCD516 resulted in  profound suppression of tumor growth as compared vehicle and also 
resulted in enhanced anti -proliferative effects as compared imatinib  and crizotinib (figure 8a and 
8b). Tumor tissue was analyzed by [CONTACT_436125] [ADDRESS_552363] also chosen to focus this study 
on liposarcoma because:  
(1) Liposarcoma is the most common sarcoma subtype. This would facilitate accrual of the study 
and enhance the clinical utility of the agent if found to be active.  
(2) Liposarcoma is in urgent need of active therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. There are only  [ADDRESS_552364] limited 
clinical activity and considerable toxicity.  
(3) There is currently no approved receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor for liposarcoma. Pazopanib, 
a small molecule  receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, wa s approved in non-adipocytic sarcomas  
and phase II studies  found the drug ineffective in liposarcoma. Our correlative studies may help 
elucidate the basis for the variable sensitivity of liposarcoma to pazopanib. Our preclinical data, 
and work by [CONTACT_2312], suggests that liposarcoma depen ds upon MET, IGF1 -R and PDGF R 
signaling ; notably, pazopanib is inactive against the first two of these RTKs, whereas MGCD516 
has considerable activity. The broader profile of MGCD516 targets may also abrogate activation 
of compensatory signaling  pathways, a well characterized mechani sm of resistance to RTK 
inhibitors.  
Preclinical studies  at CUMC and Mirati have suggested efficacy for MGCD516 in  numerous 
other sarcoma subtypes  aside from liposarcoma . In view of this and the limited resources 
available for clinical trials in sarcoma , we have proposed a Simon [ADDRESS_552365] sensitive to MGCD516 in cell 
line viability assays  (figure 2A above) and treatment of an MPNST xenograft with MGCD516  
showed complete suppression  of tumor growth (figure 8A above) and compared favorably with 
imatinib and crizotinib, RTK inhibitors of KIT/PDGFR and MET, respectively. Synovial 
sarcoma cell lines were also responsi ve to MGCD516 (figure 2A above).  
MGCD516 Sarcoma Phase II  [ADDRESS_552366] sensitive sub types (lowest IC50 values and  greatest degree of lethality) were comprised 
of liposarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarc oma, alveolar soft part sarcoma, and malignant 
peripheral nerve sheath tumor derived cell lines. In contrast, leiomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and 
Ewing’s sarcoma were among  the more  resistant subtypes  in the Mirati studies . Alveolar 
rhabdomyosarcoma and alve olar soft part sarcoma are thus included on the basis of the Mirati 
studies.   
1.[ADDRESS_552367] stage, the study 
will enroll additional patients with other sarcoma subtypes found promising on the basis of 
preclinical data in a n exploratory  cohort.    
2.1 Primary Objective

biomarkers . 
2.3.[ADDRESS_552369] been implicate d in numerous processes that support a 
malignant phenotype in human cancer.  
3.1 Preclinical Data  
MGCD516 has been extensively studied in the preclinical setting. The following information is 
referenced  from the Investigator’s Broc hure for MGCD516, version 2.0, as provided by [CONTACT_436129], unless otherwise referenced.  
3.1.1 Pharmacokinetics, Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion  
The pharmacokinetics, distribution and metabolism of MGCD51 6 were examined in vitro and in 
mice, rats and dogs in non -good laboratory practice ( GLP ) pharmacokinetic studies. Plasma 
pharmacokinetics were determined after single intravenous and oral administration of the agent 
to mice, rats and dogs across a range o f dose levels. After IV administration of MGCD516 at 2.5 
mg/kg in mice, 5 mg/kg in rats and 1 mg/kg in dogs, the volume of distribution was 6.28, 0.980 
and 11.1 L/kg, respectively. Total clearance values wer e 1.38, 0.279 and 1.49 L/h/kg. The h alf-
life of e limination was 6.23, 3.5 0 and 7.11 hours in mice, rats and dogs, respectively. Mean C max
and AUC generally increased in a dose -dependent  fashion. After oral administration  of 2, 5 and 5 
mg/kg to mice, rats and dogs, respectively, the drug was systemically absorbed with absolute 
bioavailability values of 72.2%, 19.6% and 56.4%, respectively.  
Repeat dose pharmacokinetics were conducted by [CONTACT_436130] 7 
days (12.5 -75 mg/kg/day) or 4 weeks (2.5 -25 mg/kg/day) and in dogs for 7 days (1 -8 mg/kg/day) 
or 4 weeks (0.3 -3 mg/kg/day). The T max ranged from 4 to 12 hours in rats and 2 to 6 hours in 
dogs. Mean t 1/2 was 3 to 9 hours in rats and 3 to 6 hours in dogs. Increases in C max and AUC 0-24 
were generally dose proportional. There was no  evidence of accumulation in any of these studies. 
3.1.2 Plasma protein binding  
The binding of MGCD516 to human, mou se, rat  and dog plasma proteins was assessed using an 
ultracentrifugation approach with frozen K 3EDTA plasma  for all species . The percentage of 
MGCD516 bound to protein was 99% in mouse plasma, 99.5% in rat plasma, 99.3% in dog 
plasma and 98.6% in human plasma. R esults from the positive control, warfarin, indicated 
acceptable performance for this assay. The effects of plasma from multiple species on inhibition 
of MET phosphorylation by [CONTACT_297021]516 in MKN45 (gastric cancer) cells was studied. The 
presence of 100% plasm a increased  the concentration of MGCD516 needed to achieve 50% 
MET inhibition as compared 10% plasma by a factor of 1.4 to 8.8 across species and by 1.45 in 
humans .  
29 
MGCD516 in Sarcoma Phase II  3.1.3 Metabolism  
In-vitro metabolic profiling studies were performed in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human 
hepatocytes and 8 putative metabolites were identified, with none unique to humans. After 120 
minutes of incubation with human hepatocytes, 88% of the drug remained. Phen otypi[INVESTIGATOR_436081] P450 enzymes suggested that multiple 
enzymes contributed to the metabolism of MGCD516  including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, C YP2E1 and CYP3A4. In rat and dog st udies, n o phase II 
metabolites were detected.  
3.1.[ADDRESS_552370] inhibition of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 with IC 50 values of 2.9, 11, 10, 1.9 and 11 micromolar, 
respectively. About 50% direct inhibition of CYP2B6 was observed with  [ADDRESS_552371] is receptor tyrosine kinase t argets is generally less 
than 0.1 micromolar, it is unlikely that MGCD516 at therapeutic levels will result in clinically 
significant inhibition or induction of the cytochromes at dosing that will be clinically used.   
3.1.5 Toxicology  
Toxicology  of MGCD516 wa s evaluated in 7 -day dose range -finding studies and 4 -week oral 
toxicity and toxico kinetic  studies (followed by 2 week recovery period) in both rats and dogs. 
Studies in rats  
In a 7-day repeat dosing study, rats were administered MGCD516 at doses of 0, 12.5, 25, 50 and 
75 mg/kg/day by [CONTACT_16759]  (3/sex/group for control, 9/sex/group for treated) . One male 
administered a dose of 75 mg/kg was found dead on day 7 with autopsy evidenc e of adrenal 
cortical hemorrhage. Pathologic findings were evaluated at the 12.5 mg/kg and 75 mg/kg dose 
levels . At the 12.5 mg/kg dose level, findings were of minimal to slight severity  and included : 
adrenal cortex ( congestion /hemor rhage), duodenum ( villi blunting/fusion), bone marrow 
(osteodystrophy, congestion/hemorrhage), and thymus (apoptosis/necrosis). These findings were 
also seen in animals administered 75 mg/kg/day but with increased frequency and severity and 
further  included kidney (tubular  necro sis) and pancreas ( apoptosis , increased lymphocytes).  
30 
MGCD516 in Sarcoma Phase II  For the 4 week toxicity and toxico kinetic study, male and female rats were assigned to four 
groups (15/sex/group) and doses administered via oral gavage for 29 days followed by a 14 day 
recovery perio d. Doses of 2.5, 10 or 25 mg/kg/day in control article or a control article alone 
were evaluated. Effects were studied on the respi[INVESTIGATOR_129521]. In summary, the 
dose level of 25 mg/kg/day was not tolerated and resulted in mortality, adverse c linical 
observations and considerable changes in body weight. The no observed adverse effect level  was 
found to be 2.5 mg/kg/day. Two animals given 10 mg/kg/day and 9 animals given 25 mg/kg/day 
were sacrificed  in moribund condition during the dosing phase,  with the cause of death assessed 
as adrenal hemorrhage in  at least  8, and septicemia in 1.  There were no changes in hematologic, 
coagulation or chemistry parameters of significance. Autopsy demonstrated findings generally 
consistent with other studies of anti-angiogenic compounds, and most such findings were 
reversible. Organs with changes that did not reverse at the recovery sacrifice  included changes in 
the kidney, ovary, testes and epi[INVESTIGATOR_4046] . No effects were seen on the respi[INVESTIGATOR_436082].   
Studies in d ogs 
In a 7 -day dose range -finding study in dogs, MGCD516 was administered at 0, 12.5, 25, 50 or 
100 mg/kg/day, but was not tolerated at any dose level . Therefore, a second study was conducted 
in dogs at doses of 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg/day. The 8 mg/kg/day was not tolerated requiring 
sacrifice  of 3 animals in moribund condition , with weight loss and liquid/mu coid feces observed 
in a fourth . No adverse micr oscopic changes were seen  at a dose of 4 mg/kg/day , but a decrease 
in body we ight and food consumption was observed at this dose level.  
A toxicity and toxico kinetic  study was carried out in dogs. Animals received a control article or 
MGCD 516 at doses of 0.3, 1 or 3 mg/kg/day daily for 4 weeks  by [CONTACT_436131] a 2 -
week recovery phase. All animals survived to scheduled sacrifice . One animal administered 3 
mg/kg/day had dosing discontinued  on day 8 due to anorexia, dehydration, liquid feces, vomit 
and marked body weight loss. Other clinical observations were limited to thin appearance and 
discolored or liquid feces in  animals given 3 mg/kg/day. No adverse changes in hematology, 
chemistry, coagulatio n or urinalysis  were seen. There were no ef fects on  ophthalmic  or 
electrocardiogram studies and there were no  adverse macroscopic or microscopic findings . In 
summary, t he 3 mg/kg/day dose was not tolerated and the no adverse effect level  was felt to be 1 
mg/kg/day.  
3.1.6 Cardiovascular E ffects  
Telemetry -instrumented male beagle dogs were administered MGCD516 at doses of 0, 0.5, 1 and 
4 mg/kg by [CONTACT_436132] a Latin square dosing design. No qualitative ECG abnormalities were 
observed at any dose level. Significantly higher systolic (up to 12 mm Hg), diastolic (up to 14 
mmHg) and mean arterial (up to 14 mmHg) pressures were seen with doses above 1 mg/kg 
which persisted fifteen hours post dose. At the 4 mg/kg dose level, heart rates were significantly 
lower, which persisted through [ADDRESS_552372] 
level  was determined as  4 mg/kg.  
3.1.[ADDRESS_552373] ed at dose levels of 
0, 375, 750 and 1500 mg/kg/day and the  agent was negative for inducing micronuclei in the bone 
marrow of male Sprague -Dawley Rats.  
3.1.[ADDRESS_552374]-in-human study, 516 -001, a multi -center , open -label  
phase 1/1b clinical trial evaluating the safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of this agent in patients with advanced solid tumors. The phase 1 portion of 
this study is a dose e scalation study in unselected patients using a modified toxicity probability 
interval design. Key inclusion criteria include advanced metastatic or unresectable solid tumor 
malignancies, an ECOG  performance status  of 0 or 1 and no history of symp tomatic or  
uncontrolled brain metastases. The initial starting dose was MGCD516 at 10 mg once daily, 
based on one -tenth of the severely toxic dose  observed in 10% of animals , derived from  the 4 
week toxicology study in rats  described in section 3.1 . Cohorts of 3 -5 patients were enrolled per 
dose level.  
As of 11/2015, a  total of 32 unselected patients had been accrued to the phase 1  dose escalation 
phase, including 5 with soft tissue sarcoma. 6 dose cohorts were evaluated ranging from 10  mg 
to 200  mg orally daily. Dose escalation proceeded through three dose levels (10, 20 an d 40 mg) 
without a dose limiting toxicity. At the 80  mg level, one dose limiting toxicity of grade 3 palmar 
plantar erythrodysesthesia was noted. Subsequently, 3 additional pati ents were added with no 
further DLTs observed . The dose was escalated to 200 mg with no dose lim iting toxicities seen 
at 110 or  150 mg. However, at the 200  mg dose level, 3 DLTs  were observed : grade 2 intolerable 
neuropathy, fatigue and stomatitis, each in  1 of 3 patients treated  at this dose level. The patient 
who experienced neuropathy  had been previously treated with  the chemotherapy agent docetaxel . 
A maximum tolerated dose /recommended  phase 2 dose  of 150 mg orally daily was established.  
34 
MGCD516 in Sarcoma Phase II  Single dose pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in 24 patients, and steady state 
parameters in 20 patients. Plasma samples for pharmacokinetic analyses were collected over a 
168-hour period following single dose administration and a 24-hour period following repeat dose 
administration. Drug concentrations were determined using a validated LC MS/MS method. 
After single administration, the drug reached peak concentration over a median time of 3 to 9 
hours. Plasma exposure levels were found to increase in a dose proportional fashion.  Mean 
elimination half-life varied between 40 and 53 hours. Steady state pharmacokinetics were 
reached in 11-15 days. Drug accumulation was observed following multiple dosing, averaging 
4.2-fold for C max and 4.7-fold for AUC 0-24. Mean value for peak to trough fluctuation was 
53.8%. At the 100 mg dose level, mean steady state C avg was 123 ng/mL, C max was 151 ng/mL 
and AUC 
was 2590 ng*h/mL.  
On 2/6/2018, Mirati Therapeutics provided updated guidance to investigators participating on the 
industry sponsored phase 1/1b study of Sitravatinib in solid tumors. In this study, Sitravatinib 
appeared to have improved long -term tolerability at a dose of [ADDRESS_552375] plasma concentrations for 
Sitravatinib are comparable at the 120 and  150 mg dose levels. Therefore, the recommended 
starting dose of Sitravatinib for the phase 1 /1b study was modified to 120 mg, which has also 
been adopted in this study effective in 5/2018. Patients already enrolled on this study may 
continue at the [ADDRESS_552376] one prior systemic t herapy and 
demonstrate evidence of disease progression prior to study enrollment . If the study fails to reach 
its endpoint in the stage I liposarcoma cohort , it will enroll additional patients with other sarcoma 
subtypes  which  may be responsive on the basis of preclinical data as a n exploratory  cohort  which 
may inform future clinical studies.   
The study will be conducted at two institutions . All subjects will be treated with the same agent 
and dose , MGCD516 , at 120 mg in continuous 21 day cycles . Patients will receive treatment at 
the discretion of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_436083], unacceptable toxicity or 
adverse event(s) or withdrawal  of consent.  
The primary endpoint is  the progre ssion free rate (PFR)  at [ADDRESS_552377] historical controls for active and inactive agents in sarcoma. Secondary endpoints include 
overall survival, progression free survival, overall response rate and safety profile . Correlative 
science endpoints wil l be exploratory and hypothesis generating. A subset of liposarcoma 
patients will undergo baseline and on -treatment tumor biopsies. Reverse phase protein arrays 
will be used to assess for changes in total and phospho -protein RTK targets of the drug between  
these biopsies. In another correlative study, all liposarcoma patient’s existing tumor specimens 
[ADDRESS_552378] 
stage, the study will be expanded to a total of 29  liposarcom a patients. If a total of 9 or  
liposarcoma  more patients demonstrate the PFR  endpoint, the agent will be considered promising 
in liposarcoma. This design provides for a type 1 error of 0.10 and type 2 error of 0.14. The 
study has a power of 85% to detect a  difference between PFS of 20% versus 40% at [ADDRESS_552379], synovial 
sarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcom a, to evaluate for potential 
signs of efficacy in those subtypes  as part of a n exploratory  cohort  which may inform the design 
of future phase 2 studies .

MGCD516 in Sarcoma Phase II  7.   TREATMENT PLAN  
7.1  Agent Administration  
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient  basis.  Reported adverse events and potential 
risks for MGCD516  are described in Section 10 .  Appropriat e dose modifications for MGCD516  
are described in Section 9 .  No investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_278563]'s malignancy.  
REGIMEN DESCRIPTION  
Agent  Premedications;  
Precautions  Dose  Route  Schedule  Cycle 
Length  
MGCD516  None [ADDRESS_552392] 2 hours aft er the previous meal, and 1 
hour before the next meal. The capsules  will be taken in the morning hours ( [ADDRESS_552393] or 1 hour before lunch ). The s tudy capsules will be taken wit h at least 200 mL (1 cup) 
of water. No predefined prophylactic or supportive  care medications will be administered  with 
the study agent  for patients newly starting therapy . However, prophylactic or supportive care 
may be initiated in the event of toxicity a s described in section 9.  
7.[ADDRESS_552394] a narrow therapeutic index should be used with caution  during treatment with 
MGCD516. An alternative agent should be employed if possible; otherwise, patients should be 
monitored at each study visit for signs or symptoms suggestive of subtherapeutic or 
supratherapeutic levels of these agents. A list of  substrates for CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2D6 and 
CYP3A4 which are either sensitive substrates or have a narrow therapeutic index  is provided in 
Appendix [ADDRESS_552395] of such 
medications is provided in Appendix 1.   
7.2.2 Medications affecting gastric pH  
The solubility  of MGCD516 is pH dependent , therefore medications that are associated with a 
sustained increase in gastric pH should be avoided . Upon registration to the study, patients on 
PPIs or H2 agonists should attempt to discontinue use of these agents. Patients should pursue 
lifestyle modifications and may switch to the use of as needed antacids  (including gaviscon) 
and/or carafate. If patients continue to experience significant GERD symptoms, a PPI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] H2 
blocker may be reinstituted at the discretion of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_436085] [ADDRESS_552396] cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) and P-glycoprotein ( P-
gp) transporters based on in vitro studies. Therefore, m edications that are known substrates for 
the BCRP or P -gp transporters  with a sensitive and/or narrow therapeutic index are  prohibited . A 
list of such medications is provided in Appendix 1.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_552397] of medications to be avoided and used with caution 
in this setting.  
7.3  Duration of Therapy  
Treatment with the study drug will continue until one of the following applies: 
•Disease progression
•Intercurrent illness that prevents furt her administration of treatment
•Unacceptable adverse event
•Patient’s decision  to withdraw from the study
•General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient  unacceptable for
further treatment in the judgment of the investigator
Patients whose disease status remains complete response, partial response or stable disease may 
[ADDRESS_552398] .  
Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will  also be followed for 
information on resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  
7.5  Criteria for Removal f rom Study  
Patients will be removed from the study when any of the criteria listed in Section 7.3 applies.  
The reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed will be documented in the 
Case Report Form.  
7.6 Approach to COVID -19 Related Treatment Interrupt ions 
Patients whose protocol treatment is interrupted because of COVID -19 infection and/or COVID -
19-related effects on the conduct of this study may resume resume treatment at the discretion of 
the treating investigator if the investigator believes the po tential benefits outweigh risks. In this 
situation, the patient’s clinical situation, previous benefit from study treatment, and other 
available treatment options should be considered.  
This applies to subjects whose treatment is delayed beyond the protco l allowed timeframe of 28 
days and also to subjects whose study -specified restaging imaging performed around the time of 
treatment interruption shows disease progression, and this progression can reasonably attributed 
to the period treatment was withheld.  
In these situations, the treating investigator will document the specifics of the situation and 
consideration of risk/benefit in the electronic medical record.  
8. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS
This section provides guidance on the management of adverse events and on dose delays and 
modifications for MGCD516. In the event of adverse events attributed to MGCD516 and deemed 
intolerable to the investigator, treatment may be temporarily or permanentl y discontinued. For 
patients who temporarily discontinue treatment, treatment may resume following resolution of 
treatment -related adverse events to grade 1 or baseline at a reduced dose level. Recommended  
dose modification algorithms  are included for comm only observed adverse events.  Adverse 
events are classified and graded according to CTCAE version 4.0. The following guidelines 
should also be observed:   
45 
MGCD516 in Sarcoma Phase II  •If a patient experiences multiple adverse events and there are conflicting
recommendations  as to management , the investigator should use the recommended dose
adjustment that reduces the dose to the lowest level  of the available options.
•Any patient who requires a delay in therapy exceeding 28 days should be removed from
the stu dy. Any patient who requires more than three  dose reductions  should also be
removed from the study.
•Patients should receive all relevant supportive care during the study, including, but not
limited to : blood product support, antibiotic treatment, and man agement of other newly
diagnosed medical conditions. All blood products an d concomitant medications (such as
antiemetics, analgesics, antidiarrheals) received from the first day of study drug treatment
until [ADDRESS_552399] be recorded.
•Patients who require radiation therapy while on study must  be removed from the study.
•Patients who require surgery while on study may proceed with surgery provided resection
or removal of sarcoma is not part of the surgery. Howev er, if a dose delay of more than
[ADDRESS_552400]  be removed from the study.
•Blood products and growth factors should be us ed as clinically warranted and in
accordance with institution al policy at the institution where the patient is being treated.
Specifically, the use of erythropoietin is permitted at the discretion of the treating
physician. The use of filgrastim and related medications  to avoid dose reductions or
delays is discouraged . The use of these agents in the setting o f complications from
therapy, such as severe infection, is permitted and must be documented.

MGCD516 is a small molecule multi -receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of a range of RTKs. As 
such, it may share some similar properties with other small molecule RTK inhibitors, although 
adverse events associated with the drugs are likely to vary based on t he particular RTKs 
selectively inhibited.  
9.2 Definitions  
Adverse Event : An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a 
human subject, including abnormal sign, symptom or disease, temporally associated with the 
subject’s partici pation in research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation 
in the research. Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if 
the abnormality , results in study withdrawal , is associated with a seriou s adverse even t, is 
51 
MGCD516 in Sarcoma Phase II  associated with clinical signs or symptoms , leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic 
tests, is considered by [CONTACT_309724] : Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious 
adverse event  is any AE that is:  
•fatal
•life-threatening
•requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298],
unless: (1) routine treatment  or monitoring of the  studied indication, not
associated with any deterioration in condition (procedures such as central line
placements, paracentesis, pain control); (2) elective or pre -planned treatment
for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under s tudy and
has not worsened since the start of study drug; (3) treatment on an emergency
outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of an SAE
given above/below and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186993]; (4) social
reasons and res pi[INVESTIGATOR_064]’s
general condition
•results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
•a congenital anomaly or birth defect
•an important medical event . An important medical event is one that may not be
immediately life threatening but is clearly of major clinical significance. It may
jeopardize  the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other
serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure
that did not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of
bronchospasm in an emergency  department would all typi[INVESTIGATOR_436088].
Unanticipated Problem : An unanticipated problem is any incident, experience or outcome 
involving risks to subjects or others in any human subjects research that meets all of the following 
criteria:  
•unexp ected (in terms of nature, severity or frequency) given (a) the research
procedures that are described in the IRB -approval protocol and informed
consent document, and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being
studied;
•related or possibly rel ated to participation in such research (e.g., there is a
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience or outcome may have been
caused by [CONTACT_187038]); and
52 
MGCD516 in Sarcoma Phase II  •suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm
(including physical, psychological, economic or social harm) than was
previously known or recognized.
Adverse Event Reporting Period : The study period during which adverse eve nts must be 
reported is normally defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures  (after the 
first dose of study treatment)  to the end of the study treatment (last dose of study treatment) and 
follow -up.  For this study, the study treatment follow -up period is defined as [ADDRESS_552409] administration of study treatment . 
Baseline/ Preexisting Condition : A baseline/ preexisting condition is one that is pres ent at the 
start of the study. A preexisting condition shou ld be recorded as an adverse event if the 
frequency, intensity, or if the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
General Physical Examination Findings : At screening, any clinically significant abnormality 
should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically 
significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be 
recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
Post-study Adverse Event : All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_436135], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is 
otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to 
report any subsequent  event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes 
might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
Abnormal Laboratory Values : A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an 
adverse event if any one of the  following  conditions is met:   
•The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm
the abnormality
•The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity
•The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management (e.g., change of
dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further
diagnostic investigation, etc.).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_146706] : Any adverse event that results in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_436089] a serious 
adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition 
responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the conditi on meets the 
criteria for an  adverse event.   
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances:  
•Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_436090] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an
53 
MGCD516 in Sarcoma Phase II  outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or 
diagnostic and the outc ome was uneventful.  
•Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_436091].
•Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_436092], unless it is a worsening or increase in fr equency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_436093].
9.3 Recording of Adverse Events  
Signs or symptoms of the patient’s cancer diagnosis and/or comorbidities at baseline will be 
recorded beginning on day 1. At each contact [CONTACT_1155], the investigator must seek 
information on adverse events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate , by [CONTACT_5148].  
Assessment of adverse events will include type, incidence, severity (as graded by [CONTACT_436136] 4), timing, seriousness, and relatedness to study treatment.  For each adverse event, the 
investigator will determine and document whether the re exists a reasonable possibility that the 
study drug treatment caused or contributed to the adverse event. When the investigator does not 
know whether or not the study treatment is causally -related to the event, reporting for study 
purposes will be as “r elated” to study treatment.  
Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and 
also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related 
signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagno stic procedures results should recorded in the source 
document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of 
each event should be followed until resolution, st abilization, or until it has been determined that 
the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing 
at the end of the study period must be followed  to determine the final outcome.  Any serious 
adverse eve nt that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the 
study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  
9.4  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
9.4.1 IRB Notification by [CONTACT_2728] -Investigator  
Reports of all events (including follow -up information) that meet the definition of an unanticipated 
problem posing risk to subjects or others must be submitted to the IRB within one week (5 business 
days)  following the occurrence of the unanticipated prob lem or the principal investigator’s 
acquiring knowledge of the unanticipated problem  in accordance with IRB policy . Additionally, 
the sponsor -investigato r will submit a summary of all u nanticipated problems that occurred since 
the beginning of the study a t the time of continuing review.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_436094].

determines that the information qualifies for reporting
•Any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse
reactions  over that listed in  the protocol or Investigator Brochure
•Expected SAEs and AEs will be included in the IND Annual Reports.
Follow -up information to a safety report should be submitted as soon as the relevant information 
is available.  However, if the results of a sponsor’s investigation show that an adverse drug 
experience not initially determined to be reportable are so reportable, th e sponsor  investigator 
must report such experience as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days after the 
determination is made.  
All other  serious unexpected  experiences  associated  with the use of the  study  treatment will be 
reported  to FDA as soon as possible  but in no event  later than 15 calendar  days after initial

event of dose delays/holds, imaging studies should still be obtained at the scheduled tim epoints 
as determined from registration, without delays to account for the dose delays/hold s. 
Confirmatory scans must be obtained at least 4 weeks after the documentation of an objective 
response  as discussed in section 12 . It is acceptable to perform confirmatory assessments at the 
next appointed evaluation per protocol.   Response assessment sh ould include assessment of all 
sites of disease and use the same imaging method as used at baseline  whenever possible .

at end of treatment.    
12. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
12.[ADDRESS_552426] – Solid Tumors  
For the purposes of this study, patients will be re -evaluated for response every 6 weeks.  In 
addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4 weeks following initial 
documentation of objective response.  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 
criteria.  
12.1.1  Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity : All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time  of their first 
treatment with MGCD516.  
Evaluable for objective response:  Only those patients who have measurable disease present at 
baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will 
be considered evaluable for response.  These patients  will have their response classified 
according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease 
progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response : Patients who  have lesions present at baseline that are 
evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle 
of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -target 
disease.  The respo nse assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression 
of the lesions.  
12.2 Disease Parameters  
Measurable disease : Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non -nodal lesions and short axis for 
nodal lesions) as >[ADDRESS_552427] x -ray, as >[ADDRESS_552428] scan, or >[ADDRESS_552429] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).  
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable.  If the investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, the conditions 
under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol.  
Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be >[ADDRESS_552430] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will 
be measured and followed.  
Non-measurable disease : All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small l esions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory b reast disease, and abdominal masses 
(not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -measurable.  
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor  non-measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], si mple cysts. Cystic lesions  thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered 
as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if 
non-cystic lesions are pr esent in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  
Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded 
and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions 
with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be 
those that lend themselves to repro ducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which 
circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A 
sum of the dia meters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The b aseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  
Non-target lesions : All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions  and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout  follow -up.  
12.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All 
62 
MGCD516 in Sarcoma Phase II  baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred t o evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
Clinical lesions : Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable  lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x -ray: Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI : This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_552431] slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickne ss.  
MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. , for body scans).   
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which great ly 
impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of 
MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluatio n of the type and site of disease.  
Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at 
baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond 
the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all 
scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the 
image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans 
shoul d be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
PET-CT: At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET -CT is 
not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if 
the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be 
used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conven tional CT in 
accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially 
performed.   
Ultrasound : Ultrasound is not useful in as sessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the sam e technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the 
 
 
[ADDRESS_552432] in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy/ Laparoscopy : The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological 
response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following 
complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Tumor markers : Tumor markers will not be used in this study.  
 
Cytology/ Histology : These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as 
germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confi rmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET: While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly  possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of 
FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign 
of PD based on a new lesion.  
• No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], 
this is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site 
of disease on CT, addit ional follow -up CT scans  are needed to determine if 
there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the 
date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of  disease on CT that is not 
progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
• FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to 
represent fibros is or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should 
be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific 
medical literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that 
both approaches may lead to false pos itive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET 
and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
64 
MGCD516 in Sarcoma Phase II  than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
12.4 Response C riteria  
12.4.1  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in  the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progressio ns). 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
12.4.2  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considere d in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progressi on of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not normally trump 
target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase.  Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only  is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_343], and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
12.4.[ADDRESS_552433] response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assig nment will 
depend on the achievement of both measure ment and confirmation criteria.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported 
as “symptomatic  deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
 
 
12.5 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response : The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment  started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease : Stable disease is measured from the start of t he treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

13.  CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
The correlative studies described below will be per formed in liposarcoma patients only.  
 
13.1 Proteomic s studies  
 
Introduction  
 
Reverse phase protein array (RPPA)  is a functional proteomics technology capable of profiling 
protein lev els and post -translation al modifi cations, including  phospho rylation, across various 
biolo gical specimens, including  human tissue,  using a miniatu rized analyte-down  dot-blot 
immuno assay.[ADDRESS_552438] oft en nitro cellulose, and probed with 
an affinity reagent, usu ally a high-affinity validated antibo dy. The technology is particularly well 
suited  for profiling the state of cell signaling networks owing to  small sample requirement s, high 
sensitivity in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_436097] v ariance < 
15%.  RPPA h as been used in a range of preclinical and clinic research applications for  
identifi cation of  novel therapeutic  targets and  predictive bioma rkers, pharmacodynamic analysis 
and monitoring  of therapeutic respons e.[ADDRESS_552439] oy RPPA to analyze changes in to tal and phosphop rotein RTK s between baseline 
and on-treatment tumor biop sy specimens in or der to d emonstr ate pharmacodynamic evidence of 
on-target activity by [CONTACT_297021]516 , evaluate drug effects  on activation /suppression  of downstream 
signaling  pathway components  and assess for possible compensatory upregulation of alternative 
RTKs  and signaling  pathway components as a mechanism of acquired resistance . Specifically, we 
will stu dy changes in total and phosphop rotein lev els for  the following proteins : 4E-BP1, Akt, 
AXL, EGFR, Eph family, ERK 1/2, FGFR2, IGF1 -R, KIT, MEK 1/2, MET, p70 S6 kinase, RET, 
RYK, PDGFRa, PDGFRb and VEGFR1 -2. Significant changes in total and phosphoRTKs will  
then be confirmed by [CONTACT_436139].  
 
Prior Clinical Studies Employing RPPA  
 
RPPA h as been employed as a component of  numerous  clinical trials for a simil ar purpose, 
demonstr ating the feasibility of this m ethod in human tumor sp ecimens obtained in a clinical trial 
setting. One  of the earliest clinic al trials to employ  RPPA was a phase II trial of  gefitinib in 
patients with r efractory or recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_76296]28. Core  needle tumor biopsi es were 
obtain ed before treatment and after [ADDRESS_552440] age. Interestingly, how ever, 
RPPA sug gested potential reasons for  the d rug’s lack of efficacy. A reduction in  EGFR 
activation and downstr eam pAKT  was demonstr ated by [CONTACT_436140], despi[INVESTIGATOR_436098]2 at baseline, no modul ation of  that tar get was seen across any of the 
paired biopsies. This w as corroborated further by [CONTACT_436141] c irculating  VEGF 
levels in pl asma. 
 
In another  study, RPPA was used in p reclinical mod els (cell lines and  xenografts) treated with 
the selective AKT inhibitor  GDC-[ADDRESS_552441] cancer, a randomi zed phase II trial was conducted in 50 p atients ev aluating 
 
 
68 
MGCD516 in Sarcoma Phase II  neoadjuvant chemoth erapy with or w ithout everolimu s30. RPPA was used to me asure molecular 
changes in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR p athway at baseline and at  [ADDRESS_552442] 10 liposarcoma patients  enrolled on the stu dy (beginning  with the 
first patient enrolled in st age I) with tissue  suitable  for biopsy will particip ate, regardless of the 
site at which the patient is accrued . If the study fails in s tage I and proceeds to the  exploratory 
cohort  of various tumors , no further RPPA analyses will be  performed. However, if the study 
proceeds to stage 2 in liposarcoma, and addit ional patients are needed to reach a total sample size 
of 10 for this correlative, further liposa rcoma patients will participate to accrue a total of 10 
liposarcoma patients with paired tissue  biopsies .   
 
Paired (pre-treatment and on-treatment) core biopsy specimens will be  obtained. The  baseline 
biopsy specimen will be  obtain ed at any point b etween day -[ADDRESS_552443] treatment 
with the  study drug (cycle 1, day 1) provided consent is obtained and the other eligibility criteria for 
the study are met. The on-treatment biop sy specimen will be performed with a target timepoint of 
cycle 1 d ay 15 (with a window of  cycle 1 days 15 throu gh 20). 
 
The same  tumor  lesion should be biopsi ed at both time points  whenever possible . Specimens are 
obtain ed usi ng a 16-[ADDRESS_552444] 4 cores are obtain ed, and up to 6-8 cores if feasible 
(with safety of the procedure prioritized in all cases) . The first 4 cores are placed in FFPE and 
the subsequent 2 -4 cores are cryopreserved and flash frozen. From the  FFPE material , an H&E 
section sho uld be cut for confirmation/ diagnostic purposes, to be reviewed at the institution 
collecting the sample  as per standard of care . These following specifications apply:  
 
(1) A 16 to 18 gauge needle is satisfactory;  
 
(2) Time from core needle  biopsy (CNB)  removal to initia tion of fixation should be < 30 min ; 
 
(3) CNB  material  should be immersed in sufficient volume of 10% neutral buffered formalin to  
ensure adequate fixation ( >15 to 20 times greater than estimated volume of CNB);  
 
(4) Formalin fixation to last between 6 -72 hours at room temperature; and  after fixation, proceed 
 
 
69 
MGCD516 in Sarcoma Phase II  to paraffin embedding.  Tissue blocks should be stored at ambient conditions.  
 
(5) Material should be labeled, accessioned and stored consistent with standard of care policies 
and procedures at the participating institution.  
 
Disposition of FFPE tissue:  
 
Following the biopsy, material will be accessioned to the pathology department at the institution 
obtaining the material as per institutional standard of care guidelines. FFPE tissue blocks should 
be stored at ambient conditions. Once all samples have been obtained and only when directed 
by [CONTACT_473], s ections  from the pre -treatment and on -treatment biopsies for all study 
participants will be made  as described below , appropriately labeled,  and sent to Theralink 
Technologies  where RPPA  studies will be performed. Specifically, the following steps will be 
taken:  
 
(1) Since tissue sections that are older than 6 weeks should not be used for RPPA analysis, 
prepared tissue sections should be prepared  and shipped within 2 weeks to allow for 
transportation and on -site sample preparation before the 6 week expi[INVESTIGATOR_320].  Thus this 
process should only be initiated when directed by [CONTACT_473].  
 
(2) The initial, uppermost tissue section that had be en exposed to air should either be discarded, 
or used for a non -RPPA purpose such as H&E staining.  
 
(3) Six (6) sections should be prepared to a five (5) µm thickness and air -dried at room 
temperature. Do not bake . Alternatively, five (5) tissue sections and one (1) H&E -stained tissue 
section can also be supplied.  Sections should be mounted onto either Fisherbrand ™ Superfrost ™ 
Excell ™ Microscope Slides (cat# 22 -037-247); or uncharged slides with no adhesives/treatment 
(e.g. poly -L-lysine).  Each slide should be labeled with the study participant identification 
number and the timing of the biopsy (e.g. baseline/pre -treatment or on -treatment) . This 
information will be provided by [CONTACT_436142].  
 
(4) FFPE samples should be shipped  with cold packs to Theralink Technologies , Inc.  at the 
address shown below. Please provide notification of all incoming shipments to include the name

Disposition of flash frozen tissue:  
 
Cryogenic vials for flash frozen tissue should be labeled with the study number, study -assigned 
patient identification number, patient date of birth, and date and time at which the specimen was 
acquired. This tissue should be immediately placed into the la beled cryogenic vials. Tumor cores 
should be frozen individually in separate cryovials, as collected, in order to minimize the time 
between removal and freezing. Vials with tissue should be placed in liquid nitrogen for [ADDRESS_552446]. Gary 
Schwartz where the material will be stored at -80°C until ready for further analyses . If obtained 
at a study site other than CUMC, the material should be stored at -80°C and , at the earliest 
convenience , packed on dry ice and sent by [CONTACT_99718][INVESTIGATOR_436099]. Gary

Analytic Procedures  
 
RPPA Tissue Study Procedures:  
 
The following  procedures and  analysis will be  performed by [CONTACT_436144] , Inc. . 
Sections are analyzed for  adequacy by a pathologist and sp ecimens with pr edomin ant necrosis or 
lympho cytic infiltr ation are not us ed. Tumor cells an d/or stro mal cells are microdiss ected using  
an Arcturus Pi [INVESTIGATOR_436101] (Invitrog en, Life Technologies, Grand Island,  NY). Mi crodiss ected c ells 
are stored at –80C prior  to reverse ph ase protein mic roarray printin g. Microdiss ected cells are 
subject to lysis with a 10%  (v/v) solution of T ris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine  (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_835], Rock ford, 
IL) or a 2.5% solution of  2- mercaptioethanol  (Sigma) in Tissue Prot ein Extraction Re agent (T-
PER™, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_835])/Tris-glycine 2X SDS buf fer (Invitrog en). Cell lysates are stored at –80C prior  to 
microarray constru ction. 
 
Cellular  lysates are printed on glass ba cked nitroc ellulose array slides (FAST Slides, Wh atman, 
 
 
71 
MGCD516 in Sarcoma Phase II  Florham Park, NJ) using  an Aushon 2470 arrayer (Aushon BioSystems,  Burlington, MA) 
equipped with 350 -μm pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]. E ach array consis ts of microdiss ected tumor s amples. The 
before/after pair for each patient are printed on the  same  array for most sp ecimens. Samples are 
printed in duplic ate in [ADDRESS_552449] ainer per manuf acturer’s instru ctions  (CSA kit, D ako, Carpi[INVESTIGATOR_436102], CA). Each slide 
is incub ated with a single prim ary antibo dy at room temperature for  30 m inutes. Rev erse phase 
protein mi croarray analysis of p hospho rylated/total protein endpoints  is then condu cted for the 
RTK t argets des cribed in section 13.1. 1. Antibodi es were validated by [CONTACT_436145]. The 
negative control slide is incub ated with antibo dy diluent as a  substitute for the p rimary antibo dy. 
Secondary antibo dy is goat anti-rabbit IgG H+L (1:7,500) (Vector Labs, Burlingame, C A) or 
rabbit antimouse  IgG (1:10) (Dako). Subse quent signal detection is amplifi ed via ho rseradish 
peroxidase  medi ated bioti nyl tyramide  deposition  with ch romogenic  detection per 
manu facturer’s instru ctions (Dako). Ar ray slides are scanned at 600dpi [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a  flatbed scanner 
(UMAX  PowerLook) and saved in a tiff  format (Adobe Photoshop).  Spot intensi ty is analyzed 
using ImageQuant ver 5.2 (GE He althcare). Total protein p er microarray spot is determined with 
a Sypro Ru by [CONTACT_436146] (Invitr ogen/Mole cular Prob es) per manufacturer’s directions and 
imaged with a CCD camera (NovaRay, Alp ha Innotech, San Leandro, CA ). 
 
Data compi[INVESTIGATOR_436103]. The  mean loc al area background  of each spot is used to assess spot intensi ty 
values g reater than 2 S. D. above b ackground. Replicate values are averaged. If the CV b etween 
replicates is >2 0%, the spot is flagged and a value of  “CV too h igh” reported. Si gnal intensi ty 
from the  secondary antibody alone (negative control) slide  is subtr acted from the  signal intensi ty 
of the p rimary antibo dy slide. Each patient analyte sample is norm alized to the  corresponding 
Beta actin value. Total protein  is analyzed as a quality control m arker for each microarray spot. 
Total protein p er spot is qu antified as a me ans to assess ov erall sample and printing  quality. Low 
total protein l evels indicate  inadequate sample  quality or quantity. The results of the analysis will 
be reported to the study coordinators at CUMC along with the patient’s identifi cation number 
and date of birth and subsequently will be added to the case report form and appropriate files. 
Unused tissue will be returned by [CONTACT_436144] , Inc.  to the institution which 
performed the procedure to obtain them.  
 
Western Blot Procedures:  
 
These studies will be performed in the laboratory of [CONTACT_436170] at CUMC . We will 
attempt to confirm RPPA findings by [CONTACT_436147], IGF1 -
R and PDGFRb (RTKs identified as important for LPS proliferation in preclinical studies) by 
[CONTACT_436148] -treatment and post -treatment tumor biops y specimens. Assessment of 
these targets in pre -treatment biopsies will also serve to evaluate whether phosphorylated 
expression of these targets demonstrated in cell lines is recapi[INVESTIGATOR_436104]. We will 
also use Western blot to validate changes  in other RTKs in which significant changes were 
identified by [CONTACT_436149]. Briefly, protein extractions are 
prepared using a radio  immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_436105]. Protein concentrations are 
measured using the BioR ad protein assay and equal amounts loaded onto gradient gels. 
Membranes are probed with primary antibodies and bound antibodies are then detected with 
horseradish peroxidase and visualized by [CONTACT_259819]. Validated 
 
 
72 
MGCD516 in Sarcoma Phase II  antibodies for ME T, IGF1 -R and PDGFRb are obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. 
Unused tissue will be returned by [CONTACT_436150]. If the tissue was obtained at CUMC, the tissue will be sent for archival in the 
Depart ment of Pathology using the patient’s name [CONTACT_39650].   
 
13.2 Genomic studies  
 
Introduction  
 
Genetic abnormalities  are fundamental to cancer initiation and progression . Protein signaling  
networks, including RTKs, are dysregulated by [CONTACT_436151], including changes a t the 
genomic level, where receptor tyrosine kinase proteins and other components of downstream  
signaling  networks  are encoded. Point mutations  (single nucleotide variations, insertions and 
deletions) , gene amplification and chr omosomal rearrangements all act to dysre gulate the 
function of receptor tyro sine kinases .[ADDRESS_552450] alterations in  specific  genetic targets  
demonstrated in a patient’s tumor. This approach has already successfully  entered the clinic , as 
exemplified by [CONTACT_436152], cetuximab and panitumamb for RAS 
wild-type colorectal cancer, and crizotinib for ALK -translocated lung cancer, among others.   
 
Sanger sequencing , the initial method of DNA sequencing, was initially developed in the 1970s, 
and was used in modified form for the Human Genome Project. Next generation sequencing 
techniques improve d upon  the low throughput of Sanger methods .[ADDRESS_552451] been reviewed elsewhere .34 Next generation sequencing is currently 
employed  in the NCI’s MATCH trial, in which tumor biopsies fro m [ADDRESS_552452] recently, so -called ‘third generation sequencing’ platforms, which remove the 
need for PCR amplification of genetic material, have been developed.  
 
As discussed, genetic alterations in the RTK targets  of MGCD516 have been well de scribed in 
various cancers, including sarcoma.  The use of this agent in pati ents with defined genetic 
alterations of these targets is central to the development of this agent as a targeted therapy in the 
era of personalized medicine . In the ongoing phase 1b study of MGCD516, enrollment criteria 
require patients to demonstrate gene tic alteratio ns in an MGCD516 target. In the present  study, 
all patients are eligible for enrollment, however, we will use next generation sequencing to 
define relevant genetic alteratio ns in baseline tumor specimens.  We will then assess whether the 
presen ce of such an alteration predicts clinical efficacy.  
 
Sample Procurement and Handling  
 
 
 
73 
MGCD516 in Sarcoma Phase II  This correlative study will be limite d to liposarcoma patients and all such patients (includi ng 
stage II if open  to liposarcoma) will undergo the testing described herein. A custom targeted 
next-generation sequencing platform made available by [CONTACT_436153]. will be employed  in 
this clinical trial .  
 
The clinical research  team at the institution enrolling the patie nt onto this clinical trial will 
identify the date of the patient’s most recent tumor biopsy and the institution at which that biopsy 
took place. If a patient underwent a new tumor biopsy for the purposes of this study (as described 
above  for the proteomic s section ), FFPE tissue obtained from that procedure should be used  for 
the genomic studies whenever possible , although RPPA studies will be prioritized . At the 
direction of the investigators, a  request will be made  by [CONTACT_436154] a tumor block measuring at least 5mm3 
(5 x 1 x 1 mm)  or 20 unstained slides (each at least 20 mm2 and 5 μm thickness; serial sections if 
possible). Samples should contain >20% tumor cellularity and 80% n ucleated content.  In 
addition, one H&E stained slide should also be obtained whenever possible.  Slides  will be 
labeled with the study number, study -assigned patient identification  number, patient date of birth 
and date on  which the specimen  was initially acquired. Samples will then be packaged into the 
ResearchDx specific mailing kit which will be provided to all participating institutions and 
which contains further instructions for packing and labeling the samples. The ki t will be mailed 
overnight by [CONTACT_436155]:

The following procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_436156]. G enomic DNA is extracted from 
FFPE tissue, subjected to library preparation, followed by [CONTACT_436157]. Sequencing of uniquely indexed target enrichment libraries is pe rformed using an 
Illumina MiSeq instrument, and bioinformatics analysis is performed using an assay specific 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189]. This assay was specifically developed and optimized t o enrich specific portions of 
MET, AXL, EGFR, KRAS, ALK, BRAF, ROS, RET, NTRK1/2/3, DDR2, CBL, KIT, PDGFRa 
and KDR genes using Agilent biotinylated RNA oligomer libraries. The genes and alterations 
assayed are listed in the table below. Only variants with an allele frequency of greater than 5% 
are reported. The assay has a requirement for  minimal 200x coverage to call variant at allele 
frequency less than 10%. For regions covered at a read depth of 100x -200x, variants must be 
present at greater than 10% allele frequency; although higher allele frequency variants in regions 
of reduced cover age (50 -100x) may be reported as the discretion of the laboratory director. This 
assay only rep orts specific variants, and genomic alterations other than the below mentioned 
variants may be present. Unused material will be returned to the institution which  initially 
obtained the tissue. Results will be reported to the clinical research coordinator using only the 
study assigned patient identification number as an identifier .

(Adverse Events: List and Reporting Requirements).  The Data Safety Monitoring Plan is 
described in Section 12.2.  
 
14.1 Data Collection  
 
The Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center has an elec tronic clinical trials and data 
management system (CTMS) that will be used for data collection. CRFs for the study will be 
built into the CTMS  for data entry. The system has full auditing capabilities which is web -based 

[ADDRESS_552454] data is 
entered directly into the system, which (in the case of Columbia subjects) confirms the correct 
identity of patients via an interface with the electronic medical patient index.  Staff with the 
appropriate IRB defined roles can run reports within the system for reporting purposes.

CTMS . It is the investigator’s responsibility for ensuring that all clinical and laboratory data 
entered on the corresponding CRFs are complete, accurate and authentic.  
14.3 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
The NCI -approved Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) of the Herbert Irving 
Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC) will monitor every subject who receives treatment on 
this protocol for toxicity. This protocol will adhere to the policies of the current ly approved 
HICCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP), which is in accordance with NCI and 
CUMC -IRB policy and guidelines.  The committee is chair is appointed by [CONTACT_187035]. 
The committee  consists of HICCC faculty and staff with expertise in on cology, research 
pharmacy, research nursing, and data management. The DSMC convenes twice a month to 
review patient safety and the conduct of the trial. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_436106] a frequency to be determined by [CONTACT_3433] e DSMC based on risk to the subjects.  
At the time of renewal, the study team will submit the most recent DSMC approval letter for 
safety review to the CUMC IRB. Any modifications that are required by [CONTACT_436158]. All protocol deviations, violations, and eligibility 
waivers will be submitted to and approved by [CONTACT_436159]. All

[ADDRESS_552461] seven years, per CUMC and NYP policy which is based on state law.  
15. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
This is a phase II, single arm, open label, Simon optimal 2 stage study.  The primary endpo int is 
the progression free rate (PFR ), at [ADDRESS_552462] criteria as established in section 
12.  
This endpoint has been employed in numerous  phase II clinical trials in sarcoma. The European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) - Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma 
Group conducted a comprehensive retrospective analysis of clinical trial data to determine 
outcomes in patients with advanced sarcoma  to establish PFR as an endpoint in phase II 
studies35. This  study established historical controls for active and inactive agents in the second 
line setting . On the basis of this  EORTC study, PF R greater than 40% at 12 weeks was 
associated with an active agent and was considered promising for second line therapy, w hereas 
PFR less than 20% at [ADDRESS_552463] range of sarcoma subtypes . In that phase II study, 140 patients with 
advanced intermediate or high grade sarcoma were enrolled into four strata (leiomyosarcoma, 
adipocytic sarcoma, synovial  sarcoma and other  sarcomas ) and a Simon two -stage design was 
used36. A favorable PFR was found in each subtype except for adipogenic sarcomas. In the 
adipogenic arm, PFR at 12 weeks was 26% and enrollment was closed in the first stage. 
However, PFR in the  leiomyosarcoma, synovial and other cohorts was 44%, 49% and 39%, 
respectively. On the basis of this phase II study, a randomized double -blind phase III study was 
conducted with this agent in patients with non -adipogenic sarcomas previously treated with 
chemotherapy as compared placebo37. An improvement i n progression free survival was  
demonstrated, and the drug subsequently  received regulatory approval .  Numerous other phase II 
studies using these endpoints have been conducted, including a phase II study o f the CDK4 
inhibitor palbociclib38.This study will use PFR at [ADDRESS_552464] stage, the study will enroll an 
additional 16 patients to achieve  a total of 29 liposarcoma patients. If a total of 9 or more such 
patients demonstrate the PFR  endpoint, the agent will be considered promising in liposarcoma. 
This des ign provides for a type 1 error of 0.10 and type 2 error of 0.14. The study design has a 
power of 85% to detect a difference between PFS of 20% versus 40% at [ADDRESS_552465], synovial 
sarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcom a, to evaluate for potential 
signs of efficacy in those subtypes  as part of an explorator y cohort  which may inform the design 
of future studies .  
15.2 Size/Accrual Rate  
The sample size is [ADDRESS_552466] cycle of treatment. The 
planned accrual rate across both sites  is 2-3 patients per month. T herefore , accrual is expected to 
be complete in approximately 10 to 15 months . Assuming patients are permitted to continue 
treatment f or up to 1 year ( 12 months) and allowing 6 months for quality assurance, the 
anticipated duration o f the study is approximately 28 to 33 months.   
15.3 Stratification Factors  
There are no presp ecified stratification factors for the primary endpoint. 
15.4  Analy sis of Secondary Endpoints  
Adverse event rates:  Adverse events will be recorded at each clinical visit and will be 
categorized according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0. Adverse event rates will be reported as counts 
and percentages per adverse  event basis by [CONTACT_479].  
Overall survival and progression free survival: Overall survival is defined as the time from t he 
date of first treatment with study drug  to the time of  death from any cause  or last follow -up if 
alive . Progression free survival is d efined as the time from first treatment with the study drug  to 
the earliest of either disease progression or death from any cause. Patients who are alive and 
progression free will be censored at the time of their last follow -up.  The Kaplan -Meir method 
will be used to evaluate all time to event endpoints39. Median overall survival and median 
progression free survival will be reported with 95% confidence intervals.  
Response rate: Patient r esponses will be evaluated according to RECIST version  1.[ADDRESS_552467] four weeks  divided by [CONTACT_436162].  The response rate will be repo rted with 95% confidence intervals.  
15.[ADDRESS_552468] next genera tion sequencing in all baseline tumor tissue from all liposarcoma 
patients (when s ufficient material exists) to assess for a set of predefined genetic alteratio ns in 
known targets of MGCD516. The genetic status of the tumor will then be considered on a binary 
basis; that is,  a patient tumor specimen either has or does not have one of th e predefined genetic 
alterations. We will then assess for a relationship between the presence of a genetic alteration 
with clinical outcomes . For tumor response, the two groups  will be compared using Fisher’s 
exact test given the small sample sizes . Progression free and overall survival  will be compared 
between the two groups by a log -rank test.   
15.[ADDRESS_552469] one treatment with the study drug will be 
assessed for response to treatment, even if the re are major protocol deviations or if they are  
ultimately deemed  ineligible.  Each patie nt will be assigned one of the following categories:  1) 
complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death 
from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death from  other cause,  or 9) 
unknown (not assessable or insufficient data).   
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria, with the exception of those who  received no 
study medication, will  be included in the main analysis of the response rate.  Patients in response 
categories [ADDRESS_552470] treatment schedule or drug 
administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.   
15.6.3  Reporting of endpoints if study proceeds to exploratory cohort  
If the study fails to meet the stage I endpoint in liposarcoma and proceeds to enroll the 
exploratory cohort, the primary endpoint (progression free rate at 12 weeks) and secondary 
efficacy endpoints (overall survival, progression free survival, response r ate) will be reported 
separately for the liposarcoma population and the exploratory cohort population. The individual 
[ADDRESS_552471] (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the 
study c onduct.  The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in 
writing to the investigator and a co py of this decision will be obtained  before commencement of 
this study.  
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing 
sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participa tion in this 
study. This consent form will be submitted with the protocol fo r review and approval by [CONTACT_271490].  The formal con sent of a subject, using the IRB-approved consent form, must be 
obtained before that subject is submitted to any stud y procedure.  This consent form must be 
signed by [CONTACT_17257] , as outlined in the IRB approved protocol , 
and the investigator -designated research professional obtaining the consent.

19.11  Data Reporting  Plan  
Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) is deeply committed to research integrity and 
strong credibility when it comes to the discovery of new treatment concepts, implementation of 
new clinical research techniques, and acceptance of its researcher's findings by [CONTACT_141837]. In accord with these ethics, CUMC encourages and supports its investigators in the 
sharing of final research data and/or details of newly developed clinical treatments.  
CUMC's policies that pertain to pa tient data sharing conform to CUMC IRB rules, local and state 
laws, and HIPAA privacy regulations. The primary reason for this is to protect the privacy of 
patients who participate in clinical trials. The data can be made available for continuing review by  
[CONTACT_187051], 
Statistician, Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMC), and, in other instances, the CUMC IRB.  
Data collected during the course of this clinical trial will p rimarily be shared with other 
investigators and University staff, the IRB, FDA, and other reporting agencies, and/or transferred 
to other collaborators.  Prior to transfer, the data collected must comply with, and must be limited 
by, the CUMC's guidelines for Protecting the Rights and Privacy of Human Subjects.   
19.[ADDRESS_552482] all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each individual 
administered the investigational drug or employed as a control in the investigation. Cas e histories 
include the case report forms and supporting data including, for example, signed and dated consent 
forms and medical records including, for example, progress notes of the physician, the individual's 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3853](s), and the nurses' notes. The  case history for each individual shall document that 
informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study.  
90 
MGCD516 in Sarcoma Phase II  Study documentation includes all CRFs, data correction forms or queries, source documents, 
Sponsor -Investigator correspondence, monitor ing logs/letters, and regulatory documents (e.g., 
protocol and amendments, CHR correspondence and approval, signed patient consent forms).  
Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities and all 
reports and recor ds necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical research study.  
In accordance with FDA regulations, the investigator shall retain records for a period of 2 years 
following the date a marketing application is approved for the drug for the  indication for which it 
is being investigated; or, if no application is to be filed or if the application is not approved for 
such indication, until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and FDA is notified.

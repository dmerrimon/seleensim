CP-0010 / Rev A / February ,[ADDRESS_147890], scalable, and effective approach to the management of diabetes.  
Self-monitoring of blood glucose is a valuable tool for helpi[INVESTIGATOR_130928]-related complications. 
Particularly, frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose is an essential requirement to 
adequately manage diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2. When performed and utilized 
properly, blood glucose meters for self-measurement of blood glucose allow diabetic 
patients to determine their blood glucose level and to use the information as part of their 
treatment program.  
Health coaching is defined as health education, promotion and support by a medical 
professional to enhance the well-being of individuals and facilitate the achievement of 
their health-related goals. Diabetes health coaching is provided by [CONTACT_130939] (CDE) giving overall guidance related to all aspects of diabetes to increase 
subject’s knowledge and skills about the disease and to promote self-care behaviors for 
effective self-management and glycemic control.  
A connected BGMS with a digital platform that enables real-time accessibility by [CONTACT_130940]’s clinical data, provides an effective way to intervene on real 
clinical information. Intervention in close proximity to recorded clinical events (e.g. 
hyperglycemic events, continuous out of range (OOR), etc.) on easy to remember 
occurrences may lead to more effective life change activities by [CONTACT_102]. 
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of digital self-monitoring blood glucose and 
diabetes health coaching, in adults with Type [ADDRESS_147891] on diabetes 
clinical and wellness indicators over a period of 3 months.

access to patient’s clinical information and logged behavior captured in the BGMS 
Application (app). 
 
2.2 BGMS Intended Use  
T
he Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System consists of the Dario Blood Glucose Meter, 
 
CP-0010 / Rev A / February ,[ADDRESS_147892] Strips, Dario Glucose Control Solutions and the Dario App as the 
display component of the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System. The Dario Blood 
Glucose Monitoring System is intended for the quantitative measurement of glucose 
(sugar) in fresh capi[INVESTIGATOR_130929]. The Dario Blood 
Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used by a single person and should not be 
shared.  
 
The Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System is intended for self-testing outside the body 
(in vitro diagnostic use) by [CONTACT_130941]. The Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System should not be used for the 
diagnosis of or screening of diabetes or for neonatal use.   
 
The Dario Blood Glucose Test Strips are for use with the Dario Blood Glucose Meter to 
quantitatively measure glucose (sugar) in fresh capi[INVESTIGATOR_130930].  
 
The Dario Control Solutions are for use with the Dario Blood Glucose Meter and the Dario 
Blood Glucose Test Strips to check that the meter and test strips are working together 
properly and that the test is performing correctly. 
 
2.3 Device Description 
T
he Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) by [CONTACT_130942] (LSI) is used 
for measuring blood glucose levels from fresh capi[INVESTIGATOR_130931]. It consists of a blood glucose meter (dongle), which is connected to a smart 
mobile device for usage with a dedicated application, disposable test strips stored in a 
cartridge, a lancing device and lancets.  
 
The Dario™ BGMS has a unique all-in-one feature allowing the holding of all relevant 
items for glucose self-testing in one small, easy to carry, simple to use lancing device 
enclosure, while enabling blood glucose measurement as is customary in other smart and 
non-smart mobile device-based blood glucose meter products on the market. 
 
The Dario BGMS comprises the following components:  
• Blood Glucose Meter (BGM) (attaches to a smart mobil e) 
• Smart Mobile Device Application Software (available on iTunes (Apple)/Google 
Play (Android)) 
• Disposable Glucose Test Strips (25 per cartridge) 
• Disposable mobile device cover

D
ario digital platform (Dario Engage) provides visibility and reports on patient blood 
measurement and in the context of the measurement additional user inserted data, such 
as physical activity, mood, carbs counting, diabetes type, Insulin type etc.  The system 
facilitates 100% data capture with near real-time data synchronization. All cloud stored 
information enables ubiquitous access of the coach to the system. The coach or any other 
healthcare provider can then intervene and follow-up the patient’s diabetes monitoring 
to enhance patient motivation and compliance.

8.1 Definitions  
A
dverse Event  (AE) means any undesirable experiences (sign, symptom, illness, or other 
medical event) occurring to a subject, whether or not associated with the investigational 
product or related procedures. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) means any adverse event experience that results in any of 
the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse experience, inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324], a persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity, permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to 
a body structure, or necessitated medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent 
impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure . 
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  (UADE) means any serious adverse effect on health 
or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary 
plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device 
that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.2 
8.2 Reporting Requirements 
A
ccording to the study category (see Error! Reference source not found. ), the reporting 
requirements appropriate for this study are provided in 21 CFR 812.150(b) (1): 
“Unanticipated adverse device effects. A sponsor who conducts an evaluation of an 
unanticipated adverse device effect under § 812.46(b) shall report the results of such 
evaluation to FDA and to all reviewing IRB’s and participating investigators within [ADDRESS_147913] as FDA requests .” 
Additionally, the clinical site staff is required to report all possible device malfunctions or

 8.3 Anticipated Adverse Events 
A
nticipated adverse events for the Dario™ BGMS include those that are reasonably 
expected to occur in association with any other type of commercially available BGMS 
intended for home use, which includes local pain at the finger prick site. Due to the fact 
that the device will be used only at the site and its results will not serve for treatment 
decisions, there are no other anticipated adverse events.   
 
Additional anticipated adverse events that may occur in the study are these associated 
with obtaining capi[INVESTIGATOR_130935] e.g., local pain at needle insertion site, small 
hematoma, etc.

sponsor within 24 hours of investigator’s/delegate's knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_130953]: 
 
 
If applicable, the investigator should also inform the representative of the IRB within 24 
hours of becoming aware of the event. A copy of the report cover letter should be filed in 
the SSF.  
  
The sponsor is responsible for the ongoing safety evaluation of the device and, if 
applicable, communicating the information with the FDA.

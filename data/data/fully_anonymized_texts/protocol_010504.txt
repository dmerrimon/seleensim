SPECIFIC AIMS . Although evidence -based psychosocial interventions (EBPIs) are a preferred treatment 
option by [CONTACT_899008], they are rarely available in community primary care settings and when 
available, are often delivered with poor fidelity.1 High quality delivery of evidence -based psychosocial 
interventions (EBPIs) in primary care medicine is a function of many variables, including clinician training 
(UWAC Study 1) and usability of the intervention . Several studies find that for EBPIs to be delivered with 
sustained quality , on-going supervision and guidance is critical (this study’s focus).2-[ADDRESS_1260028] not been developed with input from the clinician or in consideration of their work 
environment. Using the Center’s Discover, Design, Build, Test (DDBT) framework, we will work with clinici ans 
from 13 BHIP sites to create a clinical decision tool that addresses the common  decisional dilemmas clinicians 
face when implementing EBPIs. We hypothesize that creating tools to support EBPIs will result in improved 
clinician competency and sustained skill (target) to EBPIs, compared to clinicians without these supports, 
resulting i n better patient outcomes (mediation, Fig. 1). The specific aims of this study are:  
Aim 1: Discover Phase (6 months) . Using PAR informed user -centered design methods we will interview 
clinicians in primary care about challenges they face in the delivery of two EBPIs, Behavioral Activation and 
Problem Solving Treatment, observe them delivering these EBPIs, and receiving feedback on cases from 
experts in these EBPIs. This process will help us to identify the common decisional dilemma’s clinician’s face 
in delivering EBPIs, their preferences for expert guidance strategies, and how decision su pport tools could be 
embedded into clinic workflow to reduce obstacles and enhance the delivery of EBPIs. Contribution to Center:  
Data from this phase will be used to inform the Typology of EBPI [INVESTIGATOR_674807] . 
Aim 2: Design/Build Phase (6 months). Based on information obtained in the discover phase, we will engage 
in a rapid cycle iterative prototype development and testing of decision support tools to support PST -PC will be 
carried out using user -centered design (UCD). The build of these tools will  include the development of 
prototypes for user testing and refinement with input from care managers across the 13 BHIP sites.  
Contribution to the Center.  Data from this phase will be used to inform the Matrix of EBPI [INVESTIGATOR_674808] . 
Aim 3 : Test Phase (18 months) In the second to third year of the proposed project we will test the decision - 
support tools in a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_898992]. H1: Clinicians with access to decision tools will report better acceptability, usability, and less 
burden when using PST -PC than clinicians without the tools (Acceptability  of Intervention Measure , 
Intervention Appropriateness Measure , Feasibility Of Intervention Measure , System Usability , Modified Self -
Efficacy Scale , and User Burden Scales). H2: Clinicians randomized to decision support tools will more 
competently deliver EBPI [INVESTIGATOR_674812] (fewer number of sessions rated below standard by [CONTACT_899009]) than clinicians randomized to uns upported EBPI. H3: 
Patients treated by [CONTACT_899010] -reported outcomes than 
patients treated by [CONTACT_899011] (Sheehan 
Disability Scale) a nd change in depression symptoms over time (PHQ -9). We will conduct preliminary analysis 
to determine if change in clinical outcomes is mediated by [CONTACT_899012].  
Exploratory Aim: Use the data collected during Aims 1 -3 to 
demonstrate proof -of-concept work on using machine learning 
and natural language processing to automate and potentially 
personalize decision support tools.  
 
This study addresses IOM Recommendation 6 -3: Conduct 
research to design and evaluate strategies that can influence 
the quality of psychosocial interventions, and NIMH SP 4.[ADDRESS_1260029] PD/PI: [INVESTIGATOR_674840], Patricia A.  Research -Projects -003 (645)  
Page [ADDRESS_1260030].  Patients  from low income 
and/or racial/ethnic minority populations are less likely to receive care for this prevalent and debilitating 
disorder.13,[ADDRESS_1260031] a 
higher rate of mood disorders.17 Up to half of patients with depression receive no evaluation or treatment for 
mental health issues and fewer than one -quarter who are evaluated and found to be depressed receive any 
mental health care.18 The increase in delivery of evidence -based depression care to vulnerable populations is 
a public health priority as described by [CONTACT_792429] 2020 objective for the mental health topic (MDMH 9 
and 9.2 – increasing  the proportion  of adults  with major  depressive  disord er who receive  treatment).  Delivery  of 
effective depression treatments to vulnerable populations is a major opportunity to reduce the burden of 
depression among the US  population.19 
2.. Collaborative Care has demonstrated efficacy, but the sustained delivery of EBPIs is low. 
Collaborative Care (CC) is an effective integrated care model with a strong evidence base for vulnerable 
populations.20,21 CC includes the use of EBPIs such as Problem Solving Treatment for primary care (PST -
PC)22. Because of its evidence base, the CC model is now the subject of substantial  dissemination  and 
implementation  support  through  state,  regional  and national  efforts,  including  the implementation of CC -
specif ic billing codes for Medicare insurance recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Central to the CC model is the “care manager,” who 
provides many of the core features of CC, including patient assessment, education, medication management, 
and psychosocial interventions (BA and PST -PC).23-[ADDRESS_1260032] -PC, the use of antidepressant medications is the predominant mode of treatment in settings 
using this model of care, despi[INVESTIGATOR_898993].25,26 Part of the challenge in the limited 
availability of EBPIs in CC is the lack of on -going decision support  to care managers in the use of EBPIs. An 
integral part of the CC model is on -going decision support by [CONTACT_899013], 
who are typi[INVESTIGATOR_898994]. Thus, care managers who are trained by [CONTACT_899014], loose  
access to critical support in treatments that patients  prefer.  
3.. Clinical Decision Support Systems: Application to EBPIs . Although access to expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_898995]3,27, the availability  of this expertise  is limited 
and costly. To mitigate this problem, recent efforts have turned out the use of Clinical Decision Support 
Systems (CDSS), data analytic tools embedded in electronic health records that compi[INVESTIGATOR_898996], 
synthesize and visualizes the info rmation to support clinicians in making treatme nt decisions. Preliminary 
evidence suggests that these tools can be effective in supporting the use of EBPIs6,7 in clinical practices, 
however,  clinician  uptake  of these  tools  is low, owing  to perceived  burden  and poor clinical  utility.9,11,12. 
According to AHRQ’s [ADDRESS_1260033] address the decisional dilemma’s 
that care managers feel they need the most  support.  
4.Participant Action Research informed User -centered design (UCD) as a solution to creating a usable 
CDSS for EBPIs. Working from the AHRQ recommendations, we will employ our Discover, Design/Build and 
Teat (DDBT) Framework to create a CDSS to support sustained competency in the delivery of EBPIs (see 
Methods Core for more detailed explanation of the framework). Working with care managers from [ADDRESS_1260034] support in providing EBPIs, how that support should look, and how support tools would be 
integrated  into the Care  Management  Tracking  System  (CMTS)  a shared  electronic  health  record  that supports 
CC. Our intention is to develop a CDSS that is user friendly and effective, and is more than an alert system, 
but provides guidance on common decisional dilemma’s care managers  face.

Page [ADDRESS_1260035] whether an EBPI [INVESTIGATOR_898997] -based clinician input 
throughout the process will result in a usable decision support tool, whether this tool will be (1) used by [CONTACT_899015], (2) improves the sustained EBPI [INVESTIGATOR_750946], and (3) results in better patient outcomes through 
enhanced clinician  ability to adhere to, and competently deliver, treatment (target mechanism of action; Fig. 1).  
5.Impact. Decision support and access to expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_898998]3. This problem is recognized by [CONTACT_899016], for instance, the Veteran’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_898999], and have 
developed cost –efficient on -going support systems called communities of  practice30, these communities are 
hard to create and sustain31, and do not guarantee against drift in clinician compete ncies. CDSS embedded in 
electronic health records appears the be the most efficient and sustainable method, but they are limited in the 
type of guidance they can provide and in their usability. The results from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_899000] t on implementation and intervention science. By [CONTACT_40397] a decision support system that is informed by 
[CONTACT_899017], we have the potential to impact the quality of EBPI [CONTACT_215798]. This study is also part of the larger 
Center  mission  to begin  creating  a Typo logy of EBPI  [INVESTIGATOR_899001].  It will also serve  to inform  the Center  mission  of identifying  best methodology 
for EBPI [INVESTIGATOR_674859] ( Matrix of EBPI  [INVESTIGATOR_674808]) . 
  INNOVATION   
The main innovation from this project will be the implementation of UCD methods to create a clinical decision 
support system for sustained EBPI [CONTACT_102767]. The development of CDSS that clinicians will find useful (rather 
than burdensome), would be an innovation in the field; however, given the use of PAR and  UCD in the 
development of this system, we may discover that the electronic health record is not the best way to provide 
the support clinicians want or need. Although we have planned this project to create a CDSS for an existing 
electronic health record, w e may find that clinicians will uncover a unique process for clinical decision support.  
  APPROACH   
TTeam Expertise.  The proposed research project brings together a novel team of investigators with 
complementary skills including primary care mental health integration and PAR (Bennett), and EBPIs for 
Collaborative Care (Raue). Dr . Munson (UCD expert) will provide our design/build incu bator expertise from the 
Center Methods Core. [CONTACT_170989]’s decades -long work in the implementation of mental health services in 
real-life primary care settings serving vulnerable populations informs the view that building EHR  tools focusing 
on the support of EBPI [INVESTIGATOR_899002].32-34 [CONTACT_899022] is the lead trainer of EBPIs for the UW Aims Center and brings >10 years of experience working with 
clinicians in primary care on this EBPI.5  
P roblem -Solving Therapy for Primary Care (PST -PC). We will focus on developi[INVESTIGATOR_899003] -
PC because it is a  common and evidence based depression intervention in primary care. Currently, no 
decision support tools for PST -PC post certification have been created, and thus, we have the unique 
opportunity to build on the existing decision support literature to tools informed by [CONTACT_899017]. Commonly, 
PST-PC support and access to experts ends once the clinician has been certified. Although certified clinicians 
may seek support as needed from the AIMS Center, we have yet to have anyone do so post -certification.  
C onceptual Frameworks . We drew upon several conceptual frameworks to structure the planned research  
project. First, The “Dynamic Systems Framework” for implementation and sustainability of interventions into 
real life contexts is a key model for the current study and underlies our proposed mechanism of action 
(Figure1).38 This implementation science (IS) framework emphasizes the need for interventions, including 
EBPIs, to adapt to particular clinical contexts in order to be effective and sustained. Central to this model is the 
view that the better matched to the needs of t he setting, the better the implem entation, and the greater the 
effectiveness of the intervention will be.

S tudy Setting.  The study will be carried out within the Behavioral Health Integration Program (BHIP) of the 
primary care network of the University of Washington Health System. This network provides care to 
approximately 250,000 unique patients annually across 13 sites wi th a majority from vulnerable populations, 
including 60% Medicare or Medicaid insured, and a high proportion of patients from racial/ethnic minority 
populations. This is a high -need and high -cost population, with 38,[ADDRESS_1260036] will be broken down into 3 phases that are  
tied to each aim of the study: The Discover Phase, (Aim 1), The Design and Build Phase (Aim 2), and the Test 
Phase (Aim 3; see Fig.1). For phases 1 and 2, we will identify 15 representative clinicians working in BHIP 
clinics partnering. For phase 3, we wil l work with 6 care managers and 30 patient participants, >[ADDRESS_1260037] 18 months (See timeline).  
 
P hase 1 / Aim 1: Discover (6 months).  The purpose of this phase is to uncover common decisional 
dilemmas and challenges in the sustained use of PST -PC. We will have the advantage of Study 2’s Discover 
phase data that will have already identified modification targets of key components of PST -PC, including  
identification  of user needs  and user  testing  of PST-PC. We will replicate  the user needs  assessment and user 
testing process as is described in Study 2, with [ADDRESS_1260038] -PC elements.  
 
Usability testing. Usability testing will be carried out using a “discounted usability engineering” approach.[ADDRESS_1260039] PD/PI: [INVESTIGATOR_674840], Patricia A.  Research -Projects -003 (645)  
Page [ADDRESS_1260040] this analysis, through the 
creation of a matrix of decisional dilemmas and expert advice . The cells of this matrix will be populated with 
common decisional dilemma’s clinicians face in implementing PST -PC, and accompanying expert advice. This 
matrix will be shared with the CPB, EAB, (see Admin Core ) and the EBPI [INVESTIGATOR_899004] 
(Aisenberg, Areán and Kaysen). For the CMTS based tool, an as-Is workflow diagram of challenges  and 
opportunities for use of CMTS will be created to allow for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_899005]’ day. As an example, we will need to determine whether care mangers use the CMTS 
before each patient, after each pati ent, or at different times of day (morning or at the end of day). This will 
determine if a CDSS embedded into the electronic health records would provide timely information. The 
generated matrix and diagrams will be reviewed by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_1260041] -PC through these sources will be given to the Methods 
Core directors for use in the development of the Typology of EBPI [INVESTIGATOR_674807] . 
P hase 2 / Aim 2: Design and Build (6 months). The next step in the process will be to create initial 
prototypes of decision support tools, based on the findings in the Discover phase. The Methods Core designer, 
working in consultation with Drs. Munson, will create [ADDRESS_1260042] with the prototype, they will engage in a think -aloud process and will assess each 
prototype based on the System Usability Scale (SUS; see Methods Core for description). This rapid iteration 
will end when we create a prototype with a SUS score of [ADDRESS_1260043] -PC 
suppor t system so that it (1) meets needs of its clinicians (i.e., is useful), and (2) is easy to use and 
understand (i.e., is usable), we will move to the Test phase of this study. Data from this process will be used to  
inform the Matrix of EBPI [INVESTIGATOR_674808].  
P hase 3 / Aim 3: Test Phase (18 months).  We will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_899006]. Six care managers who will each see [ADDRESS_1260044] be 18 years old or older and suffering from depression (score between 10 and 20 on the PHQ -9). 
Methods Core research assistants will contact [CONTACT_899018] a preliminary screening for 
eligibility, provide a brief description of the study, and obtain informed consent.  
Contact [CONTACT_4002]/PI: [INVESTIGATOR_674840], Patricia A.  Research -Projects -003 (645)  
Page [ADDRESS_1260045] -PC this is 
determined by [CONTACT_19201] a score of  3 (“satisfactory ”) or greater on the PST Adherence Scales, which utilizes a 
Likert -type rating scale (0 = very poor , 5 = very good ). [CONTACT_899023] will provide clinician training in PST -PC to all 
clinicians. Clinicians randomized to the decision support condition will also receive a training  manual  and in-
person  training  in the use of these  tools  prior to the initiation  of PST-PC training. Once a care manager in either 
arm of the study is certified to provide PST -PC, they will proceed to the four -month fidelity phase of the trial. 
Five active patients identified from the existing site registry of each care manager will receive treatment during 
the trial (30  total).  
Clinician Data Collection. Three types of data will be collected from clinicians: clinician assessment of 
appropriateness and acceptability, intervention usability, and clinician ability to learn the intervention and 
maintain competency. To measure decision support usability , clinicians will complete  the Acceptability of 
Intervention Measure, Intervention Appropriateness Measure , Feasibility Of Intervention Measure , System 
Usability, Modified Self -Efficacy Scale , and User Burden Scales) , which are core mea sures for this Center . 
These scales will be collected through the UWAC data portal after clinicians have completed their intervention 
with [ADDRESS_1260046] Adherence 
Scales. Sustained competency will be defined by (1) time to first session rated below average after ce rtification 
in PST -PC and (2) number of sessions rated as < 3 (“satisfact ory”). Clinicians will not be given feed back on 
session performance.  
 
Patient data collection. We will use the UWAC data portal49 designed specifically for research on mobile 
depression interventions to confirm eligibility, complete the consent process, and conduct baseline and 
outcomes assessment. Patient data will be collect before treatment initiation and after treatment ends.  
Patients will complete a demographic survey to determine gender, age, ethnicity, income categories, and 
educational level. Patients will complete a series of brief clinical measures to determine the presence of a 
depressive disorder and if there are any im portant comorbidities. The Sheehan Disability Scale(SDS) 50,51 is a 
brief analog too assess functioning in work, social, and health domains, using visual -spatial, numeric and 
verbal anchors. The scale has been validated in medical and psychiatric populatio ns with a variety of 
psychiatric diagnoses.50,51. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire52 (PHQ -9) consists of [ADDRESS_1260047] excellent sensitivity to change over time 
(sensitivity = .88, sensitivity = .80).53 
Data  Analysis.  Aim 3 focuses  on pi[INVESTIGATOR_899007]  a larger  (future)  clinical  trial comparing  decision 
support of PST -PC to no decision support. Thus, analyses do not focus on hypothesis -driven inferential 
statistics but on descriptive statistics, graphical summaries, and basic effect sizes.  H1: Usability . 
Differences  in clinician  reported  usability  between  the two clinician  groups  will be plotted  using  a dotplot  and 
tested using a t-test using the SUS and UBS as dependent variables. H 2: Fidelity/Competence.   
We will compare groups on the proportion of clinicians who reach certification (i.e. score of [ADDRESS_1260048] two sessions). Between treatment differences will be tested with a [ADDRESS_1260049]. (Future analyses with larger sample size will use a generalized linear mixed model approach to 
account for the nested data.)54,55 H3: 
PPatient Reported Outcomes.  Histograms and kernel density estimates will be plotted by [CONTACT_899019] (PHQ -9 total score) and overall daily functioning (SDS).  
Descriptive statistics ( M and SD) of these outcomes will also be examined by [CONTACT_899020], using Cohen’s d 
as an effect size summary. A t-test will be used to examine treatment differences in these patient outcomes. 
Of ultimate interest is whether the modified treatment (i.e., decision -supported PST -PC vs. unsupported PST -
PC) effects patient outcomes through enhanced usability and clinician  fidelity. We will use graphical 
summaries of the data to explore the relationships that are consistent with mediation (e.g., correlation of 
usability with patient outcomes [b pathway], and treatment differences on patient outcomes with fidelity

 partialed out [c’ pathway’]). The primary focus here is whether the data and relationships appear  consistent 
with mediation, as opposed to a formal test, which will be dramatically under -powered.  
The Exploratory Aim will use data collected from Aims [ADDRESS_1260050], given t he anticipated data quantities, 
but rather would be the focus of future research. Potential targets for machine learning and NLP could include:  
a) understanding mechanisms of decision -supported PST -PC via predicting change in PHQ9 from content of 
written notes, and b) using NLP to evaluate the quality of PST -PC from CMTS -based notes.  
Power and Sample Size . Sample sizes for Aims 1 and 2 were based on estimates from the UCD literature on 
necessary number of participants to capture critical design information, where the recommendation is 5 -10 end 
users. Aim 3 is focused on gathering information (feasibility, recruitment and retention rates, response and 
attrition rates, etc.) for a future R01 application. As such, the sample size was set primarily for practical 
reasons; rather, it used estimated effect sizes and was not driven by [CONTACT_899021].

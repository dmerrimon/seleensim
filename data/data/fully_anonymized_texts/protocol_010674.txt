PERFORMANCE , HUMAN FACTORS , AND [LOCATION_003]BILITY STUDY PROTOCOL  
 
CONFIDENTIAL         [ADDRESS_1124745] developed the Carbon Monoxide Breath 
Sensor System (COBSS, Carrot Sense, Redwood City, CA, [LOCATION_003]), which  consists of a handheld 
breath sensor to measure CO in exhaled breath, with results displayed in a smartphone app. 
COBSS is intended to be use d as a personal and mobile product and available ‘over the counter’. 
This study will compare the performance of the COBS S to that of a clinic-based CO breath 
sensor (Micro+Smokelyzer; Bedfont ; Kent, [LOCATION_006]) in the measurement of CO in exhaled breath, 
and, will assess the human factors and usability of the COBSS. 
2.2 STUDY RATIONALE  
Performance: We aim to non-invasively measure carbon monoxide (CO) levels in the exhaled 
breath of study subjects using two different types of measurement devices.  We will assess the 
correlation between the measured CO levels (in ppm) of the study CO breath sensor (COBSS ; 
Carrot Sense) completed by a lay user with no personal instruction (using labeling only) and the 
predicate CO breath sensor (Micro+Smokelyzer; Bedfont) administered by a person trained to 
instruct users on submitting a sample with the device. 
Human Factors and Usability: We aim to a ssess whether an untrained lay user group 
(representative of intended users) can operate the device and interpret the results correctly using 
only the instructions that will be provided with the marketed device.

3.1 PERFORMANCE  
We aim to non-invasively measure carbon monoxide (CO) levels in the exhaled breath of study 
subjects using two different types of measurement devices.  We will assess the correlation 
between the measured CO levels (in ppm) of the study CO breath sensor (COBSS, Carrot Sense) 
and the predicate CO breath sensor (EC50 Micro+™ Smokerlyzer® –  Bedfont (K082315)). 
3.2 HUMAN FACTORS AND [LOCATION_003]BILITY  
The objectives of the human factors and usability portion of the study are to: 
 Ensure that representative intended users are able to operate the COBSS 
independently, focusing on the following: 
o Proper breath sample collection using the CO Breath Sensor by a user  
o User comprehension of how to navigate the Breath Sensor Application (BSA) 
o User interpretation and comprehension of their results 
 Validate appropriate mitigations of use related hazards identified in risk 
management documentation 
 Uncover previously unforeseen use errors 
 
Overall, this human factors and usability validation testing is conducted to demonstrate that the 
COBSS can be used by [CONTACT_812300], for the 
intended uses and under the expected use conditions.

CONFIDENTIAL         13 7.2 CO  BREATH SENSOR  
The CO Breath Sensor (Figure 1) is portable, battery-powered, and small enough to be 
conveniently carried by [CONTACT_53729] (pocket, purse, backpack).  The CO Breath 
Sensor is rechargeable using a micro-USB cable.  The LED pulses orange while charging and 
then solid green when fully charged. 
The CO Breath Sensor pairs to the BSA on the smartphone via low-energy Bluetooth.  The user 
submits a breath sample by [CONTACT_53731] (blowing) into the CO Breath Sensor via a straw. The CO 
Breath Sensor comes packaged with a straw already inserted in the inlet.  The straw, made of 
polypropylene, is reusable, and can be cleaned with soap and water or replaced as necessary. In 
addition, there is a pack of 7 straws (for 8 straws in total) included in the CO Breath Sensor 
package.   
7.3 BREATH SENSOR APPLICATION (PAIRING ) 
The BSA, Quick Start Guide and User Manual guide the first-time user through the process of 
pairing their smartphone to the CO Breath Sensor.  Once paired, the CO Breath Sensor 
communicates exclusively with the user’s phone and is invisible to other  smartphones and other 
Bluetooth Low Energy wireless devices.  
7.4 BREATH SENSOR APPLICATION (GETTING STARTED ) 
After pairing, the BSA displays a Getting Started screen containing a brief video tutorial 
on how to submit a breath sample. This video depi[INVESTIGATOR_812295] a breath sample, as described in the User Manual. The BSA software automatically 
advances to and requires the user to complete the video tutorial after pairing. The video tutorial 
must
 be completed to advance further in the set-up and use of the BSA (system requirement). 
The
 video tutorial ca
n be paused and played again. It is also accessible to the user at any time 
through the Settings screen in the BSA. 
Next, a Guided Breath Test (GBT) function is used by [CONTACT_812303] a breath test (interactive version of the user steps disclosed 
in the User Manual ).  Based on the user’s adherence to the proper technique, the GBT provides 
the user with a pass or fail.  Pass or fail status is communicated to the user by [CONTACT_812304] (flashing green indicates pass and flashing red indicates fail), as well as the screen 
on the BSA, which includes a smiley face, flashing green dot and descriptive text for pass, or, a 
sad face, flashing red dot and descriptive text for fail  
 The BSA software requires the user to complete three GBTs before advancing further in 
the set-up and use of the BSA.  
The user may repeat the GBT as often as they like if additional education and reinforcement of 
the technique is desired. The GBT is also accessible to the user at any time through the device 
button in the
 upper left corner of the CO Log screen in the BSA. 
7.5 SUBMITTING A BREATH SAMPLE (SPECIFIC STEPS ) 
Submitting a breath sample involves the following steps (instructions provided in the User

CONFIDENTIAL         [ADDRESS_1124747] and Quick Start Guide).  
1. If not already in place, user places provided straw in the CO Breath Sensor inlet 
2. User presses and holds (~2 seconds) the (only) button on the CO Breath Sensor until the 
device beeps once and the LED flashes blue 
3. User takes a deep breath in and holds their breath  
4. After about [ADDRESS_1124748] 6  seconds (goal is 12 seconds) or 
until they exhaust their entire breath (Figure 2) 
6. The user then removes straw from their lips 
7. After a few seconds, the solid blue LED switches to: 
a. Blinking green LED indicates adequate breath sample, data stored, or, 
b. Blinking red LED indicates inadequate breath sample, please repeat  
A properly submitted breath sample is defined, by [CONTACT_1190], as one that initiates after the third 
beep prompt and  is of at least 6 seconds duration.  Breath sensor hardware and firmware is 
capable of detecting when a breath sample submission starts and stops.  
                   
         Figure 1 . CO Breath Sensor               Figure 2 .  Submitting a Breath Sample 
 
A properly submitted breath sample is indicated to the user through the CO Breath Sensor, with 
the LED flashing green for a proper submission and red for an improper submission. In addition, 
the CO Log screen in the BSA provides the CO (ppm) value for properly submitted breath 
samples, and provides a descriptive error message for improperly submitted breath samples (i.e. 
“Error: breath sample too late”).  
The computation of concentration of CO (ppm) is performed within the CO Breath Sensor 
firmware and the data (CO ppm concentration, time and date) are stored in the CO Breath Sensor 
memory.  The measured values are transmitted via Bluetooth to the smartphone (when paired, in-
range, and after synchronization) and are displayed on the primary screen of the Breath Sensor 
Application (CO Log) (Figure 3).  The data is stored locally on the smartphone.

The primary screen for the CO Breath Sensor is the CO Log screen in the Breath Sensor 
Application.  In the CO Log, the most recent exhaled breath CO value in ppm is displayed at the 
top of the screen.  The user can view previous values by [CONTACT_53738].   
Values are color coded to align with the predicate device and scientific literature.

Maximum bar width = 50 ppm 
Values above
 50 ppm are annotated with a white arrow. 
7.7 BREATH SENSOR APPLICATION (SYNCING WITH CO  BREATH SENSOR) 
Breath sample CO values, date and time are stored on the CO Breath Sensor until a sync occurs 
with the Breath Sensor App (BSA).  Syncing occurs automatically when the app is open in the 
foreground or background.  When a user submits a breath sample on the CO Breath Sensor, they 
will be able to view the results in the CO Log within one minute.  If the most recent values are 
not in the CO Log, the time of last sync can be viewed in Settings and a manual sync can be 
performed in Utilities. 
7.8 BREATH SENSOR APPLICATION (CO  BREATH SENSOR SETTINGS ) 
In the BSA, when the user navigates to the Settings page by [CONTACT_53737][INVESTIGATOR_812296], the user sees device status (connected, not connected, syncing), last sync, and 
battery status. 
A user may choose to use the Reminders function to help them remember to submit breath 
samples throughout their day.  When reminders are toggled from off to on, the user may choose 
the time of the first and last reminder of the day, reminder time interval, type of reminder 
(vibration and/or beep), and the intensity (volume) of the reminder where applicable.  
Additionally, the user may set the volume of the breath test beeps described in the User Manual. 
A utilities menu includes options to manually synchronize the CO Breath Sensor with the 
smartphone (in the event that auto sync is not working), ring the CO Breath Sensor (if 
misplaced), and forget the sensor (unpair). 
Settings also provides access to the video tutorial on how to submit a breath sample, for those 
users who wish to obtain additional reinforcement and learning regarding breath sample 
submission.  
7.9 BREATH SENSOR APPLICATION (GUIDED BREATH TEST, OR GBT) 
In the BSA, the user may access the Guided Breath Test at any time using the device icon in the 
upper left corner. After completing device set-up and training (required 3 GBTs), the user may 
use the GBT for any and all subsequent breath samples.

9.[ADDRESS_1124753] ENVIRONMENT DESCRIPTION  
9.9.1 Intended Use Environment 
The COBSS has been designed as an over-the-counter device. The intended use environment is 
primarily the user’s home, work, school, or similar environment.   
The home environment can be characterized as a familiar environment with relatively dim (~150 
lux) to relatively bright (~1000 lux) lighting; low to medium noise, medium level of activities, 
and some distraction (family, TV, radio).  
 The work/school environment can be characterized as a familiar environment with low to 
medium noise, well illuminated, low level of activity, low level of traffic, and limited 
people interaction. 
The user submits breath samples at their discretion, and will be able to factor environmental 
conditions (such as noise, light) into the decision of when to use the CO Breath Sensor.

The following roles will be fulfilled by [CONTACT_812305]: 
 Study Moderator – Responsible for moderating the study, delivering instructions (as 
needed) and ensuring that participants progress from one use scenario  to the next, and 
asking questions to probe about observed use errors and close calls. 
 Study Facilitator – Responsible for organizing the simulated environment, study articles, 
equipment, and required documentation (e.g. informed consent form, non-disclosure 
agreements).  
 Study Observer(s) – Responsible for taking notes during the study sessions and 
documenting key events of the study as they occur.  
 Technical Support – Responsible for troubleshooting system issues and recording bugs in 
the case there is a system issue during the study session. 
Individuals fulfilling the roles will be recorded in the final Usability Validation Study Report.

Subject will self-train on how to use the study device using only the available study CO breath 
sensor device labeling, including product packaging, User Manual, Quick Start Guide, Reference 
Card, a technical support line provided in User Manual, and Breath Sensor App resources (video 
tutorial, guided breath test (GBT), Settings).  These labeling materials will all be included in the 
future marketed product. To mimic real-world use, these labeling materials will be available to 
study subject at any point during the study. However, the study subject will not be asked to read 
instructions or use any of the forms of training available.  Since in-person training will not be 
formally offered to all users who purchase the study device, in-person training on the study 
device will not be included in this study. Study personnel will refrain from answering questions 
on how to use the study device during the study.  
As part of the process of setting up and learning to use the study device, the device software 
requires the user to complete the video tutorial and the GBT (the latter must be successfully 
passed three times); this is the case for the marketed device and therefore will be the case in this 
study as well.  
Once the study subject has completed the system-required set-up and self-training on the study 
device, they will be asked if they feel ready to proceed with submitting another breath sample 
(continuing to the paired breath samples).  If a subject indicates they do not feel ready, they will 
be asked to do what they would normally do at home to prepare to use the product and to let the 
test administrator know when they are ready to submit another sample. 
When the subject indicates readiness to provide a breath sample, he/she will be instructed to 
proceed to provide one breath sample using the study device. After providing this breath sample, 
the subject will be asked to interpret his/her breath sample result followed by [CONTACT_812306].

 Difficulty: User is able to complete the task safely and effectively, but has significant 
hesitation or challenges while completing the task. 
 Close Call: User is able to complete the task safely and effectively, but performs it in a 
way that presents the potential for user harm (i.e. near-miss). 
 Unsuccessful (Use Error): User is unable to independently complete the task or does not 
complete the task safely and effectively. Includes instances in which users are unable to

unsuccessful. 
 Did Not Perform: User does not complete the task for safe and effective use of the

Any instance of study moderator assistance will be noted and assessed depending upon the extent 
of the assistance provided.  
The COBSS Use FMEA  (  g overns Acceptance Criteria for the COBSS Usability 
Validation Study. Each hazard -related use scenario observed during usability validation testing 
will be documented and assessed for risk acceptability a s defined in the Use FMEA.  
In the case that a hazard-related use scenario is concluded to have an acceptable risk profile per 
the Use FMEA, its associated test case is considered to “pass.” In the case that a hazard -related 
use scenario is concluded to have an unacceptable risk profile per the Use FMEA, its associated 
test case is considered to “fail.” In the case of a failed test case, further risk mitigation and 
usability evaluation would be required. In the case that further risk mitigation is not possible, a 
risk-benefit analysis would be documented.  
11.5 METHODS FOR CAPTURING USE ERRORS  
During each study session, observer(s), and moderator(s) will observe for difficulties, use errors 
and close calls that could inform modifications to the COBSS Use FMEA. Th e study moderator 
will also ask probing questions,  at the end of the session,  to reveal close calls that were not 
conveyed through observation. All use errors and difficulties will be followed with questions to 
identify how and why the participant believes they occurred. New, unforeseen use-related 
hazards will be assessed for risk acceptability and added to the COBSS Use FMEA.  
The study team will include subjective assessments by [CONTACT_812310]-related 
issues that could potentially result in harm to the user.  
Users will perform tasks independently and in a natural manner, without guidance, coaching, 
praise, or critique from the test facilitator or moderator. Users will not be allowed a “second 
chance” to perform a task correctly after a  failure. That is, if an irreversible safety or efficacy 
issue is observed in which a user would not normally have a “second chance” to resolve the 
issue, then any subsequent attempts to compete the task will serve as input only for continuous 
usability improvement purposes. 
The study team will ensure participant feedback is documented throughout the session, as well as 
any protocol deviations. Prior to the end of the test session, the study team will review all data 
sheets for completeness and pursue additional information or clarification as needed. The study 
team will then inform participants when the test session is complet e. 
The study team will scan the data sheets and save them to a secure study file. All members of the 
study team will be familiar with the device operation to be qualified to administer the test and 
assess participant performance with the device. The study team will write the summary report.

with access limited to necessary study personnel. Study data will be kept in a secure database by 
[CONTACT_093]. This database will be accessible only by [CONTACT_53744]. The 
database will not contain personal identifying information; all subject data in the database will be 
associated with study identification numbers. The data will be kept for [ADDRESS_1124765] cases that are provided to the user.   
Objective data will include:  
 Participant answers to use scenarios and user documentation assessment test case 
questions assessing user comprehension. 
 Study team assessment by [CONTACT_742414], based on pre-determined acceptance criteria (see 
sections 11.1 and 11.4) 
Subjective data will include: 
 Participant feedback on ease of use, understandability, and possible improvements.  
 Study team feedback on any issues with participant comprehension or ability to complete 
user tasks. 
In the case that a problem or a use error is observed, the study moderator will probe for root 
cause and record the participant’s assessment of safety and ri sk acceptability. This subjective 
input of risk acceptability will inform the final assessment and conclusion of risk acceptability 
made by [CONTACT_812313]. Both observational data and subjective input 
will facilitate identification and understanding of the root causes of use errors or difficulties that 
occur. 
As needed, photo and video recordings may be implemented during the study to facilitate post-
study analysis of user-feedback, use errors, and close calls. 
More than one study observer may record data using the data sheets. As a result, data may differ 
between note-takers. After the session is complete, the observer(s) and moderator(s) will meet to 
discuss any difficulties, use errors, or close calls. Data will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_40177] a spreadsheet, and

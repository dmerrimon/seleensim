2. PURPOSE OF THIS S TUDY  
2.1 Study purpose:  
Pain medicine is often prescribed to children to improve their comfort after surgery. Parents need to 
understand the risks and benefit s of pain medicines in order to safely use them.  
 
The overall aim of this study is to see if our new teaching method will improve parents’ understanding about 
the risks and benefits of prescribed pain medicines .  
 
We will also see if the program helps parents make better decisions about w hen to give prescribed and over -
the-counter pain medicines . 
 
3. INFORMATION ABOUT  THOSE WHO TAKE PART  
Taking part in this study is completely voluntary .  You do not have to take part  if you don't want to.  You may 
also leave the study at any time.  If you leave the study before it is finished, there will be no penalty to you, 
and you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  
 
3.1 Who can take part in this study?    Parents and their children (age 5 -17 yrs living in the home with the 
parent ) who are undergoing surgery and who are expected to go home with a prescribed narcotic  pain 
medicine  like oxycodone or Vicodin .  
 
3.2 How many people will take part in this study?   840 Parents and their children

4.  INFORMATION ABOU T STUDY PARTICIPATIO N 
4.1 What will happen to me  or my child  in this study?   
Your child will receive routine care and pain management. No treatment will be changed for the purpose of 
this study. Also, all parents will receive routine information about pain management that is provided by [CONTACT_398688]’s doctors and nurses. This will not be changed.  
 
While your child is in surgery you will complete a basel ine survey  that will take about 20  minutes:  
This survey  will ask you:  
• How familiar you are with common pain drugs  
• About y our family’s  past pain and pain medicine use 
• What you think and know about prescribed pain relievers  
• How well, in general, you understand medical information  
• You will also make 4 mock  or pretend  decisions that will show us how you would use commonly 
prescribed drugs to treat a child’s pain when different situations (scenarios) arise  
 Educational Feedback:  
• After completing the mock decision questions you will receive, in a random manner (like flip of a coin) 
either: 1) general information about risks and benefits of pain medicines OR 2) the scenario -tailored 
information that is more detailed . You will also  be randomized to get more specific versus routine 
strategies about what to do with left -over pain medicine.  
After Surgery:  
• You will use a diary  to record all pain drugs you give to your  children at home for [ADDRESS_502296] your child’s reported pain level and other symptoms each day (for example, nausea, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], 
constipation, or other side effects that may occur after surgery).  
• We will send you a text (via Twilio) or email  (via gmail)  reminder (whichever you prefer) on day s 3, 7 
and 14 .  
 
In 3 days and at 1 week:  
  Parents will get an email link with  shorter follow -up surveys that have some items that are similar to 
those completed on the day of surgery  and a few that address your child’s pain and medicine use and 
handling . If you don’t have easy access to email, we can send paper surveys home with you so that 
you can still take part.  
 
2 – 3 weeks after discharge:  
• Parents will get an email link with a shorter and final survey about pain drug perceptions, preferences, 
storage and disposal.  
• We will contact [CONTACT_398689], phone or email (whatever you prefer) to bring your child’s drug diary to your 
child’s post -op clinic visit if one is scheduled or  will ask you to return it in the pre -stamped envelope.

Consent Version: October  23,  2018  
 
• We will look at your child’s medical file to record what surgery was performed, what pain drugs were 
given in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_398684]. We will also 
record any adver se effects that happened to your child for up to 1 month after surgery.  
4.2 How much of my time will be needed to take part in this study?   
Completing surveys and receiving medication information on the day of surgery will take around [ADDRESS_502297] 
dose of pain reliever is given .  
The follow -up surveys via email link should take less than 10 minu tes each .  
 
4.3 When will my part in the study be over?  
Your part in the study will end after the final survey  
 
4.4 What will happen with my information used in this study?  
With appropriate permissions, your collected (de-identified) information may be shared with other 
researchers, here, around the world, and with companies.  Your identifiable private information may be 
stripped of identifiers and used for future research studies or distributed to another researcher for future 
research studies without ad ditional informed consent.  
 
5.  RISKS AND BENEFI TS OF THIS RESEARCH  
5.1 What risks will I face by [CONTACT_111621]?  What will the researchers do to protect me 
against these risks?  
The only risk to you and your child is the possible breach of priv acy.  
We will lessen this risk by [CONTACT_398690]  a study ID number that will be used on all surveys 
and datasheets. This ID will connect your surveys to your child’s data.  
The database will not  contain any information that could identify you or your child.  All information that 
could identify you or your child (such as name, email, medical record ID) will be kept in a separate file 
from your research data. We will destroy this list of identifier s when the study is complete.  
Some of the survey questions ask you to share sensitive information. You may skip any question that you 
would rather not answer.  
  
As with any research, there may be risks that are not yet known or expected.  Please tell us a bout any 
effect or concern that comes up while you and your child are in the study.

If you have any problems as a result of this study you should tell a researcher listed in Contacts.  
 
5.3 If I take part in this study, can I also take part in other studies?  
Being in more than one research study at the same time, or even at different times, may increase the 
risks to you.  It may also affect the results of the studies.  Please tell us if you are in another study so that 
we can decide if it is ok to take part in this one.   
 
5.4 How could I benefit if I take part in this study?  How could others benefit?   
It is possible that you may learn something that will help you better care for your child at home after 
surgery. However, you may not receive any added benefit from being in this study.  
We hope to learn about how to give parents information that will help them better and more safely 
manage pain when the child is prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_398685] .

might see it?

Enhanced pain control after reduction mammaplasty with 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_425159] 1 of 11      Revision: June 16, 2017  1) Abstract of the study  
Background: Patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty frequently suffer 
significant post procedure pain at the operative site.  While regional nerve 
block is routinely performed with bup ivacaine, the effects of this are limited to 
the up to [ADDRESS_537511] 
narcotic medication in the postoperative period following reduction 
mammaplasty.   
Methods: Patients undergoing elective Breast Surgery  at Temple University 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_425160] a control standard perineural block with 
19-mL 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] +1mL 0.9% sterile saline or block with the 
experimental mixture of 19mL 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] +  1mL 4mg/mL 
dexamethasone solution  for each breast .    Primary end points will be mean 
pain VAS score as measured every [ADDRESS_537512] -Q 
questionnaires , and length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].

5) Objectives  
This study aims to evaluate the effect of the addition of dexamethasone to a 
standard bupi[INVESTIGATOR_425162].  We 
propose that addition of dexamethasone to the infiltration solution will prolong 
the duration of analgesia pr ovided by a regional block and reduce the need 
for adjunct narcotic medication in the postoperative period following reduction 
mammaplasty.   
 
6) Background  
 
Enhanced pain control after reduction mammaplasty with 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_425159] 2 of 11      Revision: June 16, [ADDRESS_537513] common procedures performed by [CONTACT_425183][INVESTIGATOR_307].  These patients are 
generally admitted for 23 hour observation primarily due to significant 
postoperative pain.  Currently regional nerve block is routinely performed with 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_425163].  This provides effective immediat e postoperative pain 
control but is limited by [CONTACT_941] 2 to 8 hour duration of action provided by [CONTACT_425184].  These patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_425164].  Exparel® (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_425165]) is a  
commercially available long acting formulation of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_425166].  
 
A number of studies in the anesthesia literature have demonstrated that addition 
of dexamethasone to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_425167] a perineural block 
extends the duration of analgesia.  In Bjorn, et al. (Reg Anesth Pain Med, 2016 
Dec) saphenous nerve block with 10mL 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] + 1mL 0.4% 
dexamethasone after ankle surgery signifi cantly extended the time to first 
narcotic request compared to control with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_425168].  Maher, et al. (Pain 
Med, 2016 Jul)  examine the use of both IV dexamethasone (8mg) and 
combination perineural dexamethasone and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_425169].  They demonstrate statistically significant decrease in pain at 
8, 20, and [ADDRESS_537514] obtained similar results 
in a variety of orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures.  
 
A PubM ed search using terms “dexamethasone” and “nerve block” did not return 
any studies that pertain to plastic reconstructive surgeries including but not 
limited  to breast reduction.  Additionally, searches using “breast reduction” and 
“nerve block”  or “mammaplasty” and “nerve block” returned only 1 relevant study 
that examines the use of Exparel® nerve block during mastectomy (Abdelsattar 
2016).  Again, no studie s examine methods of prolonging the duration of regional 
anesthesia after reduction mammapl asty 
 
 
7) Setting of the Human Research  
 
This study will be performed exclusively at Temple University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
Patients will initially be identified and recruited du ring the preoperative cl inic 
visit.  The study will again be described to the subjects and consent obtained 
in the preoperative holding area prior to the procedure.   
 
8) Resources Available to Conduct the Human Research

bupi[INVESTIGATOR_425159] 3 of 11      Revision: June 16, [ADDRESS_537516] access to all of the medical and 
psychosocial services provided to patients of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_425171] a result of participation in this 
study  
All persons involved in conducting this study will be fully briefed on 
the background and protocol by [CONTACT_941] p rimary investigator or study 
coordinator prior to any involvement with the study.  There will be 
ongoing oversight by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_425172].  
 
9) Prior Approvals  
No prior approvals are required.  The Division of Plastic and 
Reconstructive Surgery and the Department of Anesthesia have 
approved this study.  
 
10) Study Design  
a) Recruitment Methods  
Research subjects will be identified in the plastic surgery clinic 
when they are scheduled for breast reduction surgery.  The st udy 
Enhanced pain control after reduction mammaplasty with 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_425159] 4 of 11      Revision: June 16, 2017  will be described to patients when they agree to surgery.  They will 
again be briefed on the study on the day of surgery.  No additional 
recruitment methods will be required.  No compensation will be 
provided to study participants.  
b) Inclusion and Exclus ion Criteria  
Initial in office screening will easily identify all patients who are 
requesting and scheduling breast reduction surgery.  Criteria to be 
included in the study are women aged [ADDRESS_537517] operative nausea and vomi ting.  Prisoners 
and pregnant patients will also be excluded.  Screening for 
appropriate subjects will occur in the clinic.  ASA determination will 
be made by [CONTACT_425185].  
  
c) Local Number of Subjects  
An average of [ADDRESS_537518] nearly all of these patients 
to meet screening criteria and to agree to participate in this study  
 
d) Study -Wide Number of Subjects  
This is a single site study.  Anticipated number of subjects is 
approximately 60  
e) Study Timelines  
• Data collection will occur over a period of 12 months  
• Interim  analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_425186] 6 
months to confirm  the quality of the data  
• Patient participation is limited to the length of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_425173].  
For most subjects this will be 24 hours as inpatients with the 
postoperative visit occurring 1 week after surgery.   
f) Study Endpoints  
Primary study endpoints are average VAS pain score during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_425174].  Secondary endpoints are need for antiemetic 
therapy , length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , and aggregate pain and qu ality of 
Enhanced pain control after reduction mammaplasty with 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_425159] 5 of 11      Revision: June 16, [ADDRESS_537519] -operative visit  
Patient participation will be terminated if any adverse reaction to the 
study medication is noted.  
g) Procedures  Involved in the Human Research  
Study subjects will undergo breast surgery  by [CONTACT_425187]’s 
standard technique.  No changes in surgical technique will occur as part of 
this study.  Regional n erve block with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183]/or lidocaine is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_425175]. However, not all patients opt to receive a nerve block  
For the study, subjects will be randomized to experimental and control 
groups in a ratio of 1:1.  Randomization will occur upon  enrollment in the 
study.  When the patient is enrolled, the i nvestigator will use the Sealed  
Envelope ™ simple randomization tool to assign the subject a treatment 
group.  Randomization occurs in random permuted blocks to achieve an 
even distribution between groups.   Patients will be blinded to their study 
group.  
All subjects will receive perineural  nerve block in the preoperative holding 
area prior to the case performed by [CONTACT_425188].  An ultrasound guided pecs block will be performed.  For the 
block, the fascial plane separating the pec toralis major and pectoralis 
minor muscles is identified by [CONTACT_425189] 3rd rib.  A 
needle is advanced into this space and the local anesthetic is infiltrated. 
The experimental group will receive 29cc 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_192880] 
1mL 4mg/ mL dexamethasone  for each side (40 cc total ).  The control 
group will receive 29cc 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_192880] 1mL 0.9% saline 
solution  for each side .   
All patients will undergo standard breast reduction with no change in the 
standard operative technique.  
All patients will receive a standard  postoperative pain regimen  as follows:  
• Percocet 5/325 1 tab q4hr prn pain (moderate, 4 – 7) 
• Percocet 5/325 2 tabs q4hr prn pain (severe, 8 – 10) 
• IV 1mg Morphine q1hr prn breakthrough pain  
• IV 4mg Zofran q8hrs  prn N/V  
This may be adjusted for patient drug allergies  
 
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_14072] a local analgesic used routinely during surgical procedures.  
It is FDA approved for this indication.   
Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid available in oral and intravenous 
formulation s.  It is FDA approved for a multitude of anti -inflammatory 
indications. While off label, it is standard of care to provide IV 
Enhanced pain control after reduction mammaplasty with 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_425159] 6 of 11      Revision: June 16, [ADDRESS_537520]-operative visit.   
As previously stated, regional block with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_425176].  Patients who do not consent to 
participate in the study will be offered a regional nerve block containing 
only bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  Anesthesia pain service f aculty will perform the block  
regardless of study participation or study group.   
 
h) Data and Specimen Banking  
Data will be collected and stored in an electronic database stored on the 
encrypted hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30469].  All data will be stored in a password 
protec ted and encrypted manner.   
 
Identifying patient information including name, date of birth, and medical 
record number and the associated study ID will be stored in a password 
protected document accessible only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_32528].  
 
A separate d atabase containing the de -identified study ID number and all 
collected study data will also be stored in a password protected, encrypted 
file.  This file will contain clinical information such as pain scores, narcotic 
use, and length of stay.  This databas e will be accessible to all study 
personnel involved in administering the study . 
 
The database containing identifying patient information will be destroyed 
upon completion of all data analyses.  All patient medical records will be 
cleared of the study ID at this time.  The deidentified database will be 
maintained indefinitely for potent ial ongoing analysis.   
 
i) Data Management  
 
Prior to data collection, patients will be randomized into 2 groups (control or 
experimental) . An independent source will generate a master list of study 
IDs and associated  randomization status .  Patients will assi gned within the 
master l ist and randomized accordingly per the master list.  
Enhanced pain control after reduction mammaplasty with 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_425159] 7 of 11      Revision: June 16, [ADDRESS_537521] with development of 
an automated data collection mechanism.  Data will be stored in a 
spreadsheet that allows for manipulation and analysis. Patient surveys will 
be conducted a week after the procedure and documented on paper and 
the responses will be manually inputted into an electronic database 
(REDCap). Survey responses (REDCap) will be matched to inpatient data 
measurements (Epic) through study ID numbers.  The spreadsheet itself 
will be encrypted and will be stored exclusively on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_425177].   
 
The two groups will be compared using a Student T test to evaluate for 
significant differences in the endpoints of each group.  
 
A [ADDRESS_537522] 81% power to detect a difference in means of 1.[ADDRESS_537523] model to 
compare the pain scales of the two groups over time. If vital signs are 
dissimilar at the beginning of the stu dy, they will be controlled for prior to 
analysis.  Pain medication requirement (determined by [CONTACT_425190][INVESTIGATOR_425178]) will also be controlled within the analysis 
model .  Adjustments to the pain s core within the grou ps due to pain 
medication usage will be performed.  
 
However, need for postoperative anti -emetic therapy is expected to be a 
somewhat rare event with similar means.  In a similar power analysis with 
an expected group A mean of [ADDRESS_537524]-operative  
nausea  
 
Similarly, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_425179].  The differ ence is generally expected to be between a “before 
lunch” or “after lunch” discharge on post -operative day 1. A two-group  t 
test with a 0.[ADDRESS_537525] deviation, a sample size of 63 
is required to achieve 80% power with p<0.05.

j) Confidentiality  
All patient data will be dei dentified prior to storage. Data will be 
stored in an encrypted electronic database. Only study personnel 
will have access to this database. No one will be permitted to store 
the database on a personal device.  The database will be stored 
exclusively on ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_425180].  
 
 
k) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of 
subject s 
No significant risk is anticipated by [CONTACT_425191].  All of the medications are currently in routine use at 
this institution. All adverse events related to study medication will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_34351].  A MIDAS report will be 
filed for any adverse event.  If  there are any occurrences, an interim 
summary of adverse events will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_425181] [ADDRESS_537526] s requiring inte nsive care interventions or death.  
 
 
 
l) Withdrawal of Subjects  
Subjects will be withdrawn from the study if there are any 
intraoperative surgical complications  requiring deviation from 
standard technique .   
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time  
11) Risks to Subjects  
Regional nerve block is an optional component of the standardly 
performed breast reduction at this institution.  Participation in the 
study does entail all the standard risks of this procedure.  These 
are primarily bleeding or bruising at the injection sit e, nerve 
damage resulting in pain, numbness or weakness, infection, and

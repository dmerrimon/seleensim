approximately 6-7 months to complete this portion of 
the trial if all doses levels need to be evaluated. For 
the phase II portion of the study, between the two 
institutions, 719 colorectal cancer patients are seen 
annually. We estimate that approximately 30% of our

839 CB 839 treatment induces UPP1, an enzyme that plays an important role in 
converting 5 fluorouracil to an active compound  
 
The mechanism of cytotoxicity of 5 fluorouracil has been ascribed to the mis
incorporation of fluoronucleotides into RNA and DNA and to the inhibition 
of the nucleotide synthetic enzyme thymidylate synthase (13). To interrogate 
the molecular mechanisms by [CONTACT_319327] [ADDRESS_1142245] of 5 fluorouracil, we noted that our gene expression analysis shows that 
glutamine deprivation up regulates uridine phosphorylase 1 (UPP1) in 
PIK3CA mutant cells (Fig 3). UPP1 
facilitates conversion of 5 FU to FdUTP and 
FUTP (14), which can be incorporated into 
DNA and RNA. It has been shown that UPP1 
/  embryonic stem cells are much more 
resistant to 5 FU (15), whereas 
overexpression of UPP1 enhances 
cytotoxicity of 5 FU (16). We examined 
UPP1 gene expression in the isogenic 
HCT116 PIK3CA mut/  and WT/  cell lines. 
CB 839 induced more UPP1 in PIK3CA 
mut/  cells than in the WT/  cells. Similar 
results were observed in the DLD1 PIK3CA 
mut/  and WT/  cell lines. We therefore 
hypothesize that in addition to blocking 
glutamine metabolism, CB 839 treatment 
also induces UPP1 gene expression and thus 
enhances 5 FU toxicity.

 2.0 OBJECTIVES 
 
The overall objectives for this study are to 1) determine the recommended 
phase II dose (RP2D) of CB-[ADDRESS_1142249] no further treatment options or patients for whom 
single agent capecitabine is an acceptable treatment regimen and 2) to 
determine the antitumor activity of CB-839 and capecitabine chemotherapy in 
patients with metastatic PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancer who are refractory 
to fluoropyrimidine based therapy. The phase I portion of this study will also 
determine the dose-limiting toxicities of this treatment regimen as well as the 
pharmacokinetics. In the phase II portion of this study, the pharmacodynamic 
effects of CB-839 and capecitabine will be evaluated using multiple biomarker 
studies including glutaminase activity level, and UPP1 gene expression, 
glutathione levels, nucleotide levels as well as a whole exome sequencing 
analysis and an RNA seq analysis.  and incorporation of 5 FU into RNA and 
DNA. We hypothesize that we will observe a reduction in glutaminase activity 
in both tumors and platelets and , induction of UPP1 gene expression in 
tumors, a reduction in glutathione levels and nucleotide levels following 
treatment. The whole exome and RNA seq analyses will be explorato ry.  and 
an increase in the incorporation of 5 FU into RNA and DNA. The generation 
of organoids from tumor biopsy specimens both prior to and following 
treatment will also be exploratory and will be used for further potential studies 
as additional preclinical information becomes available.

10.2.1  Background  
 
The mechanism of cytotoxicity of 5 fluorouracil has been ascribed to the mis
incorporation of fluoronucleotides into RNA and DNA and to the inhibition 
of the nucleotide synthetic enzyme thymidylate synthase (13). To interrogate 
the molecular mechanisms by [CONTACT_319327] [ADDRESS_1142259] of 5 fluorouracil, we noted that our gene expression analysis shows that 
glutamine deprivation up regulates uridine phosphorylase 1 (UPP1) in 
PIK3CA mutant cells. UPP1 facilitates conversion of 5 FU to FdUTP and 
FUTP (14), which can be incorporated into DNA and RNA. It has been shown 
that UPP1 /  embryonic stem cells are much more resistant to 5 FU (15), 
whereas overexpression of UPP1 enhances cytotoxicity of 5 FU (16). We 
examined UPP1 gene expression in the isogenic HCT116 PIK3CA mut/  and 
WT/  cell lines. CB 839 induced more UPP1 in PIK3CA mut/  cells than in 
the WT/  cells. Similar results were observed in the DLD1 PIK3CA mut/  and 
WT/  cell lines. We therefore hypothesize that in addition to blocking 
glutamine metabolism, CB [ADDRESS_1142260] or US guided biopsy of a metastatic focus both prior to the initiation 
of treatment and 10-15 days following initiation of treatment. The pre-
treatment biopsy may be performed up to 14 days prior to the initiation of 
treatment. 
 
Tumor Biopsies: Patients will undergo biopsy in the University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823799] (UHCMC) Department of Radiology by [CONTACT_823845], [CONTACT_823873]. If being treated at the Taussig 
Cancer Institute (TCI) of the Cleveland Clinic, patients will undergo biopsy 
in the Cleveland Clinic Department of Radiology. Use of CT or US guidance 
for each biopsy will be per the discretion of the physician performing the 
biopsy and the same metastatic focus of tumor will be biopsied at baseline and 
10 15 days following initiation of treatment. Biopsies will be conducted

Pharmacokinetic analysis of patients receiving CB-839 at each dose level will 
allow for correlations to be made between trough levels of CB-839 and both 
glutaminase activity level and UPP1 gene expression.

[IP_ADDRESS] Background and Rationale 
We have hypothesized that CB 839 treatment will induce UPP1 gene 
expression (section 10.2.1) in PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancers. UPP1 
facilitates the conversion of 5 FU to FdUTP and FUTP (14), which can be 
incorporated into both RNA and DNA. We therefore hypothesize that in 
addition to blocking glutamine metabolism, CB [ADDRESS_1142263] as a substrate for glutathione synthesis. Following administration of CB
839, we anticipate that glutaminase inhibition will deplete the glutamate pool, 
thereby [CONTACT_823846].

death in both males and females with approximately 49,700 colorectal cancer related deaths

genes, BRAF and PIK3CA. To date, targeted agents acting upon these mutations are only available 
to patients harboring a ras mutation (approximately 40% of patients) but no targeted therapy exists 
for patients with PIK3CA mutations, which are thought to be present in approximately 15-30% of 
colorectal cancers (3). 
 
Role of glutamine in cancer  
 
It has been well described that tumor cancer cells are dependent on glutamine for survival. Both 
the “Warburg effect” and “glutamine dependency” are well-known metabolic reprogramming 
events that occur in cancer cells (4). In normal cells, glucose is converted to acetyl-CoA, which 
enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and undergoes oxidative phosphorylation in the 
mitochondria (5). In cancer cells however, glucose is converted to lactate even in the presence of 
oxygen (the “Warburg effect”) (5). It was previously thought that the Warburg effect is caused by 
[CONTACT_823847] (6). Instead of using glucose, cancer cells utilize 
glutamine to replenish the TCA cycle (7). To enter the TCA cycle, glutamine is first deaminated 
by [CONTACT_629931] (GLS) to generate glutamate. Glutamate is then converted to alpha-ketoglutarate 
(alpha-KG), a TCA cycle intermediate, by [CONTACT_823848] (e.g. GPTs and GOTs) or a 
glutamate dehydrogenase.  
 
  
 
Glutamine metabolites are utilized to produce ATP, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_823803], thereby 
[CONTACT_823849] (4). 
 
 
 

CASE 1216    Page 37    Version date: 12/16/[ADDRESS_1142279] PIK3CA mutations are clustered in two hot spots: H1047R in the kinase domain and E545K 
in the helical domain (3). Preclinical work conducted by [CONTACT_823850]3CA mutations reprogram cell metabolism in colorectal cancers (CRCs). The CRC cell line 
HCT116 harbors a heterozygous H1047R mutation, whereas DLD1 CRC cells express a 
heterozygous E545K mutation. To interrogate how PIK3CA mutations impact cancer metabolism, 
we exploited isogenic cell lines with either the WT or mutant alleles of PIK3CA knocked out (gift 
from [CONTACT_823875]) to test their sensitivity to glucose or glutamine deprivation. We termed 
the parental cells as Mut/WT, the WT PIK3CA allele knockout as Mut/-, and the mutant allele 
knockout as -/WT. As had been previously reported (8), the parent cells and knockout cells grew 
at a similar rate under normal conditions in the presence of glucose and glutamine. However, 
glutamine deprivation (-Gln) induced more apoptosis in PIK3CA Mut/- cells than PIK3CA -/WT 
cells as assayed by [CONTACT_823851]-GI cells, amounts of cleaved PARP and counting of viable 
cells. Similar results were observed with both HCT116 and DLD1 cell lines. In contrast, none of 
these cell lines showed differential sensitivity to glucose deprivation. Glutamine sensitivity tested 
in two additional cell lines with PIK3CA mutations—RKO with a PIK3CA H1047R mutation and 
HT29 with a PIK3CA P449T mutation—and two CRC cell lines with WT PIK3CA (SW480 and 
LOVO) generated similar results; glutamine deprivation induced significantly more apoptotic cells 
in the two PIK3CA mutant cell lines than in the two WT PIK3CA cell lines, suggesting that these 
results are generalizable. Prior studies have demonstrated that KRAS increases glutamine 
metabolism in pancreatic cancers (9). Both the HCT116 and DLD1 CRC cell lines harbor a 
heterozygous oncogenic KRAS mutation. Using isogenic HCT116 and DLD1 clones with either 
WT or mutant KRAS knockout (10), we showed that KRAS mutant and WT clones did not show 
differential sensitivity to glutamine deprivation. Overall, this suggests that mutant PIK3CA/p110 α, 
bu
t not mutant KRAS, renders CRC cells dependent on glutamine to grow and provides the first 
evidence that oncogenic PIK3CA mutations cause glutamine dependency in cancer cells.

.1  Preclinical Data  
 
PIK3CA mutant CRC cells are more sensitive to a 
glutaminase inhibitor—CB-[ADDRESS_1142280] been shown to be overexpressed in 
CRCs (11). CB-839 is a highly selective, reversible, 
allosteric inhibitor of glutaminase (12). We have shown 
that isogenic PIK3CA Mut/- cells are more sensitive to 
CB-839 than their WT counterparts (Fig 1). The GI50 
(dose of 50% growth inhibition) of CB-839 of the PIK3CA 
Mut/- cell lines are 3-4 fold lower than the isogenic 
PIK3CA -/WT cell lines derived from either HCT116 or 
DLD1 CRC cell lines. In CRC xenografts treated with CB-

Based on tissue culture data demonstrating that 5-fluorouracil enhanced cytotoxicity of CB-839, 
our group sought to determine if CB-839 alone or in combination with 5-fluorouracil inhibits 
xenograft tumor growth of a PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancer. A dose of 30mg/kg of 5-
fluorouracil was tested after it was determined that 40mg/kg was the maximum tolerated dose in 
mice. Mice were treated with 200mg/kg CB-839 and 30mg/kg 5-fluorouracil combination therapy 
which induced tumor regression (Fig 2). In contrast, although CB-[ADDRESS_1142282] that CB-

osing schedule (BID with food) during a 21-day treatment cycle. A standard 3+3 dose escalation 
strategy was employed assessing dose levels ranging from 100-800 mg TID (n=32), and 600-800 
mg BID with food (n=27). Treatment was well tolerated with 16% of patients across all trials 
experiencing a grade 3/4 treatment related adverse event. One dose limiting toxicity occurred 
(grade 3 creatinine in a patient with known diabetes). The majority of adverse events were related 
to asymptomatic, reversible elevations in liver function tests (LFTs). Twice daily dosing with food 
resulted in a lower frequency (1.5%) of grade 3 treatment-related LFT abnormalities than TID 
dosing and hence has been selected as the dosing schedule to pursue in subsequent studies (18). 
Pharmacodynamic analyses (see section 1.2.3) have demonstrated that [ADDRESS_1142283] cancer, KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, 
mesothelioma, fumarate-hydratase (FH)-deficient solid tumors, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-
deficient GIST, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient non-GIST and isocitrate dehydrogenase 
(IDH)-mutant solid tumors and have confirmed the adverse event profile and recommended phase 
2 dose (18). Monotherapy dosing at 800 mg BID has also been shown to be safe and well tolerated 
and is being further explored in the clinic—this dose could eventually become the preferred 
recommended phase 2 dose. Two-drug combination studies with CB-839 and either paclitaxel, 
erlotinib, everolimus or docetaxel are planned.  
 
Two phase I studies of CB-839 administered as a single agent were also conducted in patients with 
hematologic malignancies: relapsed and/or treatment refractory multiple myeloma or non-
Hodgkins lymphoma (CX-839-02) and relapsed and/or treatment refractory leukemia and IDH-
mutated myelodysplastic syndrome (CX-839-003) were also conducted (19). Totals of 14 and 18 
patients received CB-839 in CX-839-002 and CX-839-003, respectively according to the same 
treatment strategy employed in the aforementioned solid tumor study. Treatment was similarly 
tolerated with 21% and 14% of patients respectively experiencing a grade 3/4 adverse event 
thought to be related to CB-839. The majority of the adverse events were due to asymptomatic, 
reversible LFT abnormalities or hematological adverse events. Given the larger experience in the 
solid tumor phase I study, BID dosing was selected for subsequent studies hematologic malignancy 
studies. Expansion cohorts assessing single agent activity of CB-639 600 mg BID are ongoing in 
acute myeloid leukemia (IDH wild-type), acute lymphoid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia 
(IDH1 or IDH2 mutant) and myelodysplastic syndrome (IDH1 or IDH2 mutant). 
 
1.2.3 Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
 
Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed on Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1), C1D15 and D1 of each 
subsequent treatment cycle in each of the conducted phase I studies (17-19). A dose dependent 
relationship was observed with CB-839 exposure increasing with dose. The half-life of CB-839 
was determined to be 4 hours. Additionally, Cmin fell below a target concentration of 200 ng/mL 
in 46% of patients receiving 400 mg or higher TID regimens while a large majority of patients 
receiving BID dosing with 600 mg maintained a Cmin greater than the 200 ng/mL target 
concentration. Additionally, an assessment of the effect of food on the PK profile of CB-[ADDRESS_1142284] and delayed absorption, which resulted in similar 
Cmax and Cmin for the 600 mg TID and 600 mg BID fed regimens. Given the favorable adverse 
event profile observed with the 600 mg BID fed regimen, this is the favored dosing regimen. 
CASE 1216    Page 40    Version date: 12/16/2020 
  P
harmacodynamics of CB-839 was also assessed in both studies. Glutaminase activity was 
measured in circulating platelets as well as tumor biopsy specimens. Blood samples collected at 
baseline and four hours following CB-839 treatment were assessed for glutaminase inhibition and 
demonstrated a dose dependent relationship. At a CB-839 treatment dose of 600 mg BID, greater 
than 90% glutaminase inhibition should be observed even at Cmin for most patients. An evaluation 
of glutaminase activity assessed approximately 4 hours after the C1D15 CB-839 dose within five 
(5) tumor specimens also demonstrated clear inhibition of glutaminase activity and suggested a 
dose-response relationship (18). 
 
Based on both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, CB-839 600 mg BID or 800 mg BID for 
a 21-day treatment cycle, to be repeated every 21 days has been determined as the single agent 
dose for pursuit in further clinical trials.

inhibitor or a VEGF inhibitor). It may also be used as a single agent as a maintenance therapy. 
Ultimately patients develop resistance to fluoropyrimidine therapy and hence disease progression. 
However, based on our preclinical data outlined in section 1.2.1, we hypothesize that co-
administration of CB-[ADDRESS_1142285] responses of the CB-839 and fluoropyrimidine combination in fluoropyrimidine resistant 
human patients. Based on our preclinical mechanistic studies described above, we propose a phase 
I clinical trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase 2 dose 
(RP2D) and dose limiting toxicities of CB-839 plus capecitabine in patients with advanced solid 
tumors. The data derived from this trial will be used for a subsequent phase II clinical trial where 
we will estimate the antitumor activity and pharmacodynamic effects of CB-839 and capecitabine 
in patients with PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancers that are resistant to fluoropyrimidine therapy. 
We hypothesize that CB-839 in combination with capecitabine will overcome fluoropyrimidine 
resistance and that the addition of capecitabine to CB-839 will result in the inhibition of 
glutaminase in tumors and platelets and the reduction in nucleotide levels in tumors. Genomic 
abnormalities on the DNA and RNA level will also be explored via a whole exome sequencing

2.0  OBJECTIVES 
 
Th
e overall objectives for this study are to 1) determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) 
of CB-[ADDRESS_1142287] no further treatment 
options or patients for whom single agent capecitabine is an acceptable treatment regimen and 2) 
to determine the antitumor activity of CB-839 and capecitabine chemotherapy in patients with 
metastatic PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancer who are refractory to fluoropyrimidine based therapy. 
The phase I portion of this study will also determine the dose-limiting toxicities of this treatment 
regimen as well as the pharmacokinetics. In the phase II portion of this study, the 
pharmacodynamic effects of CB-839 and capecitabine will be evaluated using multiple biomarker 
studies including glutaminase activity level and nucleotide levels as well as a whole exome 
sequencing analysis and an RNA seq analysis. We hypothesize that we will observe a reduction in 
glutaminase activity in both tumors and platelets and a reduction in nucleotide levels following 
treatment. The whole exome and RNA seq analyses will be exploratory. The generation of 
organoids from tumor biopsy specimens both prior to and following treatment will also be 
exploratory and will be used for further potential studies as additional preclinical information 
becomes available

.0 STUDY DESIGN 
 
3.1  Study design including dose escalation / cohorts for phase I component 
 
This is a standard 3+3 phase I dose escalation trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose and 
dose limiting toxicities of combination therapy with CB-839 and capecitabine chemotherapy in 
patients with advanced solid tumors with no remaining treatment options or for whom single agent 
capecitabine is an acceptable therapy. Patients will receive combination therapy with CB-839 and 
capecitabine for 21 day cycles and will remain on treatment until either disease progression, 
development of unacceptable toxicity or discontinuation per patient/physician preference. Patients 
will receive CB-839 orally twice daily for 21 days (continuous administration) and capecitabine 
orally twice daily for 14/[ADDRESS_1142290], abdomen and pelvis every 3 cycles (9 weeks). 
A minimum of three patients will be assessed at each dose level until the maximum tolerated dose 
has been determined. Please see section 6.1 for details.

(excluding alopecia) due to prior anti-cancer therapy. 
 
  4.[ADDRESS_1142308] received recent 
treatment for colorectal cancer (radiation within the previous two weeks, chemotherapy or 
investigational therapy within the previous four weeks).  
 
  4.3 .3  Patients with untreated brain metastases/CNS disease will be excluded due to their 
poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that 
would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

the potential teratogenic or abortifacient effects that may results from CB-839 and/or 
capecitabine. Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing 
infants secondary to treatment of the mother with CB-839 and/or capecitabine, 
breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with CB-839 and/or 
capecitabine. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

6.0  TREATMENT PLAN 
 
6.1 Treatment Regimen Overview 
 
6.1.1 Phase I: Patients will receive combination therapy with CB-839 and capecitabine for 21 
day cycles and will remain on treatment until either disease progression, development of

receive CB-839 orally twice daily for 21 days (continuous administration) and capecitabine 
orally twice daily for the first 14/[ADDRESS_1142311] 3+[ADDRESS_1142312] this phase I study. Patients 
will be treated in cohorts of 3 patients starting with dose level 1, with escalating doses of 
both CB-839 and capecitabine. Escalation will continue through all dose levels until the 
MTD has been determined. The dose escalation strategy is as follows:

6.1.2 Phase II: Patients will receive combination therapy with CB-839 and capecitabine for 21 
day cycles and will remain on treatment until either disease progression, development of 
unacceptable toxicity or discontinuation per patient/physician preference. Patients will 
receive CB-839 800 mg orally twice daily for 21 days (continuous administration) and 
capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 orally twice daily for the first 14/21 days as was determined 
d
uring the phase I portion of the study. Additionally, given that there are ongoing studies, 
the safety profile will continue to be monitored in these studies and the RP2D could be 
adjusted based on emerging safety and tolerability data. 
 
6.2 General Agent Administration Guidelines 
 
As capecitabine involves a weight based administration, dosing will be based on actual body 
weight. Dose changes (beyond cycle 1) should be made only if there is a > 10% change in body 
weight as calculated by [CONTACT_823853]. 
 
As CB-[ADDRESS_1142313] 500 mg and 
the total dose should not exceed the calculated dose by [CONTACT_726] 5%. If an odd number of 500 
mg tablets are needed, the dose may be split between the morning and evening doses (example: if 
2500 mg are required for the total daily dose, 1500 mg may be administered in the morning and 
1000 mg may be administered in the evening). 
 
Dose of up to 5% higher than the calculated BSA-based dose of capecitabine may be given when 
rounding down would result in significant under-dosing as determined by [CONTACT_1963].  
Any doses higher than the calculated BSA-based dose should be reviewed by [CONTACT_9154].  Total 
daily doses higher than 105% of the BSA-based dose should not be given.   
 
As an example: a patient with a BSA of 1.[ADDRESS_1142314] a total calculated daily dose of 
capecitabine of 3940 mg but may receive 4000 mg total.  In this case the dispensed (rounded) dose 
would be 1.5% higher than the BSA-calculated dose.  If instead the dose was rounded down the 
patient would receive 3500 mg daily which would be 11% lower than the calculated dose.  The 
lower dose should be used if the higher dose is more than 5% above the calculated dose.   
Dose reductions for toxicity should be considered similarly with up to 80% of initial dose being 
allowed at the -1 dose level and up to 55% of initial dose being allowed at the -2 dose level (see 
section 7.2 below).

A missed or vomited dose of either CB-839 or capecitabine should not be replaced. The patient 
should be instructed to take the next scheduled dose at the regularly scheduled time. 
 
Treatment will continue until development of progressive disease (as defined by [CONTACT_68979] 12.4) or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
 
Appropriate dose modifications for CB-839 and capecitabine are described in Section 7.0

6.2.1 CB-839  Administration 
 
CB-839 will be given orally twice daily in combinatio n with capecitabine chemotherapy during a 
21 day treatment cycle. Administration of CB-839 will be continuous throughout the 21 day 
treatment cycle. During the phase I component of the study, the dose of CB-839 administered will 
be dictated by [CONTACT_823841]. During the phase II component of the study, the dose of 
CB-839 administered will be 800 mg by [CONTACT_823854] I 
portion of the study. 
 
CB-839 should be taken with food—the first dose of the day should be taken with breakfast and 
the second dose of the day should be taken with dinner. 
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_1142315] 14 days 
of each 21 day treatment cycle. During the phase I component of the study, the dose of capecitabine 
administered will be dictated by [CONTACT_823841]. During the phase II component of the 
study, the dose of capecitabine administered will be 1000 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1-14 of a 21 
d
ay treatment cycle as was determined during the phase I component of the study. 
 
Capecitabine tablets should be taken whole with water within 30 minutes following a meal. Doses 
will be taken approximately 12 hours apart at the end of a meal.

For each cohort, 3 patients will be entered sequentially to each dose level. Dose-limiting toxicity 
(DLT) is defined in section 6.4.  
 
• If none of the 3 patients at a dose level experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the 
first cycle (21 day treatment period), new patients may be entered at the next dose level.  
• If 1/[ADDRESS_1142316] cycle, up to 3 more patients will be treated

• For the dose level deemed the MTD, 6 patients will be treated at this dose level, even if a 
DLT has not been observed. 
• If at any time 2 or more DLTs are seen in 3 or 6 patients an any given dose level, the 
preceding dose level will be declared the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) and 
recommended phase II dose. MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which < 33% of 
6 patients experience a DLT. If 1 DLT is seen out of 6 patients at a given dose level, new 
patients may be entered at the next dose level. 
• If dose level -1 exceeds the MTD definition, then the study will be suspended and 
additional dose levels will be considered.

limited to, clinical/radiographic progression, voluntary withdrawal, or complications that the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_698305]’s malignancy will not be considered 
evaluable for DLT and will be replaced.  
 
A DLT is defined as any AE that cannot be determined to be unrelated to study treatment, occurs 
within the first treatment cycle (i.e., Cycle 1), and that meets at least one of the non-hematologic 
or hematologic criteria below: 
 
Non-Hematologic DLT: 
• ≥ Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity according to the Co mmon Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 except the following : 
o Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea lasting < 48 hours and controlled by [CONTACT_823855]/antidiarrheal therapy  
o Grade 3 hyperglycemia lasting < [ADDRESS_1142321] anti-diabetic therapy  
o Clinical laboratory abnormalities that are reversible to ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_1142322]
atus within 72 hours with outpatient care and/or monitoring, or that are 
considered not clinically significant by [CONTACT_079]  
• Grade 4 hyperglycemia (>500 mg/dL; 27.8 mmol/L; life threatening consequences)  
• Grade 4 hypoglycemia (<30 mg/dL; <1.7 mmol/L; life threatening consequences)  
• Grade [ADDRESS_1142323] (>20.0 x the upper limit of normal)  
• Grade 4 ALT (>20.0 x the upper limit of normal)  
• Grade [ADDRESS_1142324] or ALT elevation (>5.0 – 20.0 x the upper limit of normal; >5 x the upper 
limit of normal for >2 weeks) with concomitant Grade 2 increase in total bilirubin (>1.5 
– 3.0 x the upper limit of normal)  
 
Events involving elevation in the AST, ALT or bilirubin with a clear alternative explanation (such 
as progressive disease within the liver) can be exempt from being considered a DLT-defining 
event. 
 
Hematologic DLT: 
• Grade 4 neutropenia [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 0.5 x 109/L] 
• G
rade 3 febrile neutropenia (ANC < 1.0 x 109/L with a fever ≥  3 8.3 degrees C)

Management and dose modifications are outlined in Sec tion 7. 
 
6.5 General Concomitant Medications and Supportive Care Guidelines 
 
All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care will be given throughout the study. 
CASE 1216    Page 53    Version date: 12/16/2020 
  A
nxiolytics, anti-emetics, analgesics and antibiotics may be provided at the discretion of the 
treating physician. 
 
6.5.1 Use of Imodium and/or Lomotil should be implemented immediately to prevent 
dehydration should diarrhea develop. 
 
6.5.2 The use of growth factors (filgrastim) is permitted and should be administered in 
accordance with ASCO guidelines (20). Growth factors are not permitted, however, in the first 
treatment cycle of the phase I portion of the study unless the patient experiences a hematologic 
DLT. 
 
6.5.3 The use of erythropoietin stimulating agents is NOT permitted. Anemia may be managed 
with blood transfusions as indicated. 
 
6.5.4 Caution should be taken when capecitabine or CB-839 is co-administered drugs that are 
highly dependent on CYP2C9 for metabolism. 
 
6.5.5 Prophylactic anticoagulation will be allowed during therapy provided the activity of the 
agent used is reflected in either INR or aPTT and that those parameters remain as follows: INR < 
1.5 or aPTT within normal limits. Anticoagulation for therapeutic use of DVT or PE is allowed. 
Caution should be taken in patients receiving Coumadin (which is permitted). Coumadin levels 
should be monitored and the dose of Coumadin may need to be reduced. 
 
6.5.[ADDRESS_1142325] that concomitant use of agents that increase gastric pH (e.g., proton pump 
inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists, antacids, etc.) may reduce absorption of CB-839, resulting in 
decreased systemic exposure. Note:  these agents are NOT CONTRAINDICATED but rather 
discontinuation is recommended whenever possible. Based on emerging PK data from other CB-
839 studies, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_823808] a PPI [INVESTIGATOR_823809]-839 (e.g., administer CB-839 with an acidic beverage or dietary supplement). 
In the event that a patient needs to resume proton pump inhibitor therapy, a PK sampling pre-dose 
and at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 hours are required at a point 2-4 weeks after initiation of PPI [CONTACT_48831]. 
 
6.5.8 Emollients and/or urea based creams are recommended for use at the first sign of palmar-
plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (hand and foot rash) and should be used liberally before 
making a dose modification based on this AE. 
 
6.6 Criteria for Removal from Study

• Sponsor reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue 
the study  
 
The date and reason for discontinuation must be documented. Every effort should be made to 
complete the appropriate assessments.  
 
6.7 Duration of Follow Up 
 
Patients will be followed for toxicity for 30 days a f ter treatment has been discontinued (or longer 
if treatment related toxicities have not resolved to at least a grade 1) or until death, whichever 
occurs first.  
 
The clinical course of each adverse event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it 
has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause. 
 
Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will necessitate follow-
up to determine the final outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period 
and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation will be 
recorded and reported immediately. 
 
Patients will be followed every 3 months for up to 2 years from study drug discontinuation. 
 
7.0  DOSE DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
 
On
ce a patient undergoes a dose modification, neither CB-839 nor capecitabine may be re-
escalated in that patient. 
 
Dose reductions may be implemented for either one agent or both agents depending on the treating 
physician’s assessment of causality. 
 
Patients requiring > [ADDRESS_1142326] 75% of the total assigned CB-[ADDRESS_1142327] be for reasons other

a DLT. If a patient experiences a DLT, treatment continuation at a lower dose of CB-839 and/or 
capecitabine will be permitted as long as the toxicity has returned to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline within 
14
 days. Upon recovery, patients may restart at one CB-839/capecitabine dose level lower. Patients 
who do not recover within [ADDRESS_1142329] at any time at the 
discretion of the Principal Investigator. Dose interruptions for grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity 
for up to 5 days can be implemented at the discretion of the treating physician to manage clinically 
significant toxicity. No dose reduction is required when resuming treatment. Dose interruptions of 
> 5 days should be discussed with the PI. Patients whose dose is interrupted for > [ADDRESS_1142330] be 
used prior to making a dose modification for these symptoms.

function tests (including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and 
alkaline phosphatase), elevation in creatinine, constipation, oral pain and photophobia. These have 
generally been mild and reversible. Elevation in gamma-glutamyltransferase, bilirubin, anorexia, 
anemia and dizziness have been observed as adverse events in rare instances (<2%). It should be 
noted that the rate of GGT elevation is more frequent but these elevations are often considered not 
clinically significant.

8.3 Definitions  
 
8.3.1 Adverse Event   
 
An adverse event  (AE) is any unfavorable or unintended event, physical or psychological, 
associated with administration of a test article in a research study. The event can include abnormal 
laboratory findings, symptoms, or disease associated with the investigational agents or procedures 
associated with the research study. The event does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with the investigational agents under study, any risk associated with the research, the 
research intervention, or the research assessments.  
 
Adverse events may be the result of the interventions and interactions used in the research; the 
collection of identifiable private information in the research; an underlying disease, disorder, or 
condition of the patient; and/or other circumstances unrelated to the research or any underlying 
disease, disorder, or condition of the patient.  
 
8.3.2   Serious Adverse Events  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any 
of the following outcomes:  
• Results in death.  
• Is a life-threatening  adverse experience. The term life-threatening in the definition of 
serious refers to an adverse event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time 
of the event. It does not refer to an adverse event which hypothetically might have 
CASE 1216    Page 61    Version date: 12/16/2020 
  c
aused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . Any 
adverse event leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_165280], UNLESS at least one of the following expectations is met:  
o The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 24 hours OR  
o The admission is pre-planned (e.g., elective or scheduled surgery arranged 
prior to the start of the study) OR  
o The admission is not associated with an adverse event (e.g., social 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933].  
However it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_165281] “medically important” and as such may be reportable as a serious adverse 
event dependent on clinical judgment. In addition where local regulatory authorities 
specifically require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedent.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . The definition of disability 
is a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .  
• Is an important medical event . Important medical events that may not result death, be 
life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse 
experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
disease or disorders, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. The development of a new cancer is 
always considered an important medical event. 
• Clear progression of neoplasia should not be reported as an AE or SAE. Findings that 
are clearly consistent with the expected progression of the underlying cancer should 
not be reported as an adverse event, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823810]. All deaths should be reported as SAEs 
regardless of the underlying cause. If there is any uncertainly about a finding being due 
solely to progression of neoplasia, the finding should be reported as an AE or SAE as 
appropriate. 
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_1142340] be recorded, reported, and followed 
up as indicated for an SAE. This includes: 
• A case involving a pregnancy exposure to a test article, unless the product is indicated 
for use during pregnancy e.g., prenatal vitamins. Information about use in pregnancy 
encompasses the entire course of pregnancy and delivery and perinatal and neonatal 
outcomes, even if there were no abnormal findings. If a pregnancy is confirmed, test 
article must be discontinued immediately. All reports of pregnancy must be followed 
for information about the course of the pregnancy and delivery, as well as the condition 
of the newborn. When the newborn is healthy, additional follow-up is not needed. 
Pregnancies occurring up to [ADDRESS_1142341] also 
be reported to the investigator.  
CASE 1216    Page 62    Version date: 12/16/2020 
  • O
verdose (e.g., a dose higher than that indicated in the protocol) with our without an 
AE. 
• Abuse (e.g., use for nonclinical reasons) with or without an AE. 
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure with or without an AE.  
 
8.3.4 Adverse Event Evaluation  
 
The investigator or designee is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (both serious and 
non-serious) observed by [CONTACT_823856]’s medical records. Source 
documentation must be available to support all adverse events.  
 
A laboratory test abnormality considered clinically relevant (e.g., causing the patient to withdraw 
from the study, requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations, result in a delay or 
dose modification of study treatment, or judged relevant by [CONTACT_093]), should be reported 
as an adverse event.   
 
The investigator or sub-investigator (treating physician if applicable) will provide the following 
for all adverse events (both serious and non-serious): 
• Event term (as per CTCAE) 
• Description of the event 
• Date of onset and resolution 
• Expectedness of the toxicity 
• Grade of toxicity  
• Attribution of relatedness to the investigational agent- (this must be assigned by [CONTACT_98225], sub-investigator, or treating physician) 
• Action taken as a result of the event, including but not limited to; no changes, dose 
interrupted, reduced, discontinued, etc. or action taken with regard to the event, i.e. no 
action, received medication or other intervention, etc. 
• Outcome of event 
 
Descriptions and grading scales  found in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version  4 will be utilized for AE reporting.  
 
An
 expected adverse event  is an event previously known or anticipated to result from 
participation in the research study or any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the patient. 
The event is usually listed in the Investigator Brochure, consent form or research protocol.  
 
An unexpected adverse event is an adverse event not previously known or anticipated to result 
from the research study or any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the patient.  
Attribution  is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and the study 
drug.  Attribution will be assigned as follows: 
 
• Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study drug. 
• Probable – The AE is likely related to the study drug. 
• Possible – The AE may be related to the study drug. 
CASE 1216    Page 63    Version date: 12/16/2020 
  • Un
likely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study drug. 
• Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study drug. 
 
Attribution should be assigned for individual components of the treatment regimen. 
 
8.4  SAE Report Form 
 
SAEs will be recorded on the FDA Form 3500A (MedWatch) but should only be reported as 
instructed below.  The electronic FDA SAE reporting forms should not be used.   
 
8.[ADDRESS_1142342] dose of study drug is received through 30 days after the final dose of study drug. 
Adverse events, both serious and non-serious, and deaths that occur during this period will be 
recorded in the source documents. All SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are 
clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es). 
Related AEs will be followed until resolution to baseline or grade 1 or stabilization.  
 
8.5.1 SAE Reporting Requirements

9.1
  CB-839 
 
  Name [CONTACT_43632]: CB-839 
 
Other Names:   NA 
 
Product description:  CB-839 is provided as 200 mg opaque Swedish orange gelatin capsules or 
as tablets that are manufactured, packaged, and labeled according to current Good Manufacturing 
Practices (cGMP). 
 
Storage requirements:  CB-839 capsules should be stored as will be indicated on the study drug 
label—this should be in a clinical site pharmacy at controlled room temperature, defined as 
CASE 1216    Page 66    Version date: 12/16/2020 
  b
etween 20° and 25°C +/- 5°C (i.e. between 15° and 30°C (59° to 86°F). Stability studies being 
carried out on the phase I clinical supplies support storage for CB-[ADDRESS_1142348] storage conditions including 
temperature excursions outside the range 15° and 30°C must be reported to the Sponsor upon 
detection and the IP in question must be quarantined until the Sponsor authorizes usage or 
otherwise. Patients will be instructed to store medication according to storage conditions noted on 
the label, out of reach of children or other cohabitants. 
 
Route of administration:  CB-[ADDRESS_1142349] and the second dose of the day should be taken with 
dinner.  
 
Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion of  CB-839 
 
Systemic exposure to CB-839 following oral administration is highly species dependent due to 
significant cross-species differences in absorption and metabolism. The oral bioavailability was 
good in mice and rates when CB-839 was dosed to animals as a solution; the systemic exposure 
increased less than dose-proportionally. On the other hand, the oral exposure and bioavailability 
in dogs and cynomolgus monkeys was low to modest likely due to extensive first-pass metabolism. 
The oral exposure and bioavailability in marmoset monkeys were also low to moderate likely due 
to poor absorption. Based on the in vitro  and in vivo  ADME data, good oral exposure of CB-[ADDRESS_1142350] demonstrated significant exposure 
following oral dosing. 
 
Absorption:  The api[INVESTIGATOR_2855]-to-basolateral permeability of CB-839 in Caco-2 monolayers was 
determined to be 9.6 x 10-6 cm/sec and is predictive of good permeation through gut wall 
i
n humans. The aqueous solubility of CB-839 is pH-dependent, with high solubility under 
low pH and poor solubility at neutral pH. The oral bioavailability of 44-70% in mice and 
66-157% in rats demonstrated good absorption of CB-[ADDRESS_1142351] patients demonstrated better CB-839 exposures when taking the drug with food. 
 
Distribution:  High in vitro  plasma protein binding of CB-839 was observed in mouse, rat, 
dog, and human plasma at 1 and 10 uM using an ultracentrifugation approach; there were 
no significant differences observed among species. The mean plasma protein binding was 
98.0, 97.0, 97.9, and 99.1%, respectively. Following a single oral dose of 200 mg/kg to 
scid/bg mice, CB-839 was broadly distributed to systemic tissues including heart, lung, 
spleen, muscle, and subcutaneously-implanted tumors; brain had 20-fold lower CB-839 
concentration than plasma. 
 
Metabolism: In vitro  metabolic stability of CB-839 was evaluated using cryopreserved 
hepatocytes derived from mice, rats, dogs, monkeys (cynomolgus, rhesus, and marmoset), 
and humans. CB-[ADDRESS_1142352] stable in human hepatocytes . In hepatocytes from marmoset 
CASE 1216    Page 67    Version date: 12/16/2020 
  m
onkeys, CB-839 was also stable. Gender differences were observed only in rats; CB-[ADDRESS_1142353] been identified in vitro  in hepatocytes and in vivo ; amide hydrolysis and, to a 
lesser extent, P450-mediated hydroxylation. There are considerable differences in the 
mechanism of metabolism across species. Amide hydrolysis appears to be the predominant 
pathway of metabolism of CB-839 in rat and marmoset monkey hepatocytes. Amide 
hydrolysis also contributes significantly to the metabolism of CB-839 in hepatocytes from 
mice, cynomolgus monkeys, and rhesus monkeys. The relative abundance of metabolites 
in hepatocytes is correlated with those observed in vivo  for all species tested (mice, rats, 
dogs, marmoset monkeys, and cynomolgus monkeys). In human hepatocytes, metabolites 
resulting from both amide hydrolysis and hydroxylation of the thiadiazole and pyridazine 
rings were detected. However, all these metabolites have low abundances (<10%) in human 
hepatocyte incubations up to [ADDRESS_1142354] been observed. 
Based on the in vitro  hepatocyte stability and metabolite profiling data, we chose rat and 
marmoset monkey as GLP toxicology species. Significant exposures of major human 
metabolites (the hydrolysis products of CB-839) were observed in the plasma samples from 
both CX-839 clinical Phase I trials and GLP toxicity studies. 
 
Excretion:  When CB-[ADDRESS_1142355]-cannulated rats, thereby [CONTACT_823857], 0.3-1.2% of orally dosed CB-[ADDRESS_1142356] 2 hr after dosing. A 41-49% reduction in systemic 
exposure to CB-839 was seen relative to normal rats. Further studies are needed to better 
understand biliary excretion of CB-839 in rats. 
 
Drug-drug interaction:  Direct and time-dependent inhibition (TDI) of human cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) enzymes by [CONTACT_206617]-839 was evaluated in human liver microsomes. CB-839 was 
no an inhibitor for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CPY2C8, CPY2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A. CB-
839 appears to be a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 (~40-50% inhibition of 5 uM). Further 
studies are needed to understand the mechanism of inhibition. CB-839 was not an inducer 
of human CYP1A2, 2B6, or 3A4 in cryopreserved hepatocytes from three donors. CB-839 
is a moderate substrate of efflux transporters with an efflux ratio of 6.2 in Caco-2 
monolayers.

described in section 10.1.3. Patients will undergo a pretreatment biopsy up to [ADDRESS_1142369]-
treatment tumor biopsy will be used for the glutaminase activity assay. Samples will be frozen in 
liquid nitrogen and transferred to the Translational Research and Pharmacology Core on dry ice. 
Specimens will be evaluated for glutaminase activity per the Glutaminase Activity Assay Protocol 
for Platelets and Tumor Biopsy Samples (methods provided in laboratory manual). 
 
Platelets: The glutaminase inhibition assay will be conducted during the phase II portion of the 
study. 24ml of blood will be collected from each patient on day 10-[ADDRESS_1142370]-treatment tissue biopsy. Specimens will be evaluated for 
glutaminase activity per the Glutaminase Activity Assay Protocol for Platelets and Tumor Biopsy 
Samples (methods provided in laboratory manual). Processing of samples will be done for each of 
the sites as outlined in section 10.2.4 and per the laboratory manual. 
 
10.2 Pharmacokinetic analysis of CB-839 
 
The purpose of conducting a pharmacokinetic analysis o f CB-839 is to determine if there is a 
correlation seen between plasma trough levels of CB-839 and both glutaminase activity levels (in 
tumors and platelets) and UPP1 gene expression. 
 
10.2.1  Background  
 
Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed on Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1), C1D15 and D1 of each 
subsequent treatment cycle in each of the previously conducted phase I studies (17,18). A dose 
dependent relationship was observed with CB-839 exposure increasing with dose. The half-life of 
CB-839 was determined to be 4 hours. Additional pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, Cmax and 
Cmin) demonstrated greater variability with TID dosing than with BID dosing. Additionally, Cmin 
fell below a target concentration of 200 ng/mL in 46% of patients receiving 400 mg or higher TID 
regimens while all patients receiving BID dosing with 600 mg maintained a Cmin greater than the 
200 ng/mL target concentration. 
 
Pharmacodynamics of CB-839 were also assessed in both previously conducted phase I studies. 
Glutaminase activity was measured in circulating platelets as well as tumor biopsy specimens. 
Blood samples collected at baseline and four hours following CB-839 treatment were assessed for 
glutaminase inhibition and demonstrated a dose dependent relationship. At a CB-839 treatment 
dose of 600 mg BID, greater than 90% glutaminase inhibition should be observed even at Cmin. 

CASE 1216    Page 74    Version date: 12/16/2020 
  Gl
utaminase activity within tumor specimens also demonstrated a dose-response relationship. 
 
10.2.2  Rationale for Analysis 
 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of patients receiving CB-839 at each dose level will allow for 
correlations to be made between trough levels of CB-839 and glutaminase activity level. 
 
10.3.3  Collection of Specimens 
 
Approximately 2ml of blood will be collected via peripheral venipuncture into an EDTA tube 
(lavender top). This blood sample will be used to measure concentrations of CB-[ADDRESS_1142371] be noted in the source 
documents and eCRFs.  
 
For collecting specimens, the following protocol should be followed: 
• Label a 3.0 mL K2EDTA vacutainer tube.  
• Label 2 cryovials. 
• Prepare an ice bucket.  
• Draw blood into the 3.0 mL vacutainer tube. Ensure that tube is filled with a minimum 
of 2 mL of blood. 
• Samples should be thoroughly mixed by [CONTACT_823863] [ADDRESS_1142372] with a fresh vacutainer.  
• The whole blood samples should be placed on ice immediately after collection. Try not 
to wet the label.  
• Plasma should be prepared within 30 minutes of collection by [CONTACT_823864] 2000 x g for 10 minutes at 4˚C. 
• Split the resultant plasma into two aliquots of approximately equal amounts (at least 
0.3 mL) and transfer into the two labeled cryovials. 
• Place each of the three samples immediately into the cryobox and store at -70˚C until 
shipment.

been validated. Details are given below and in the laboratory manual:

CASE 1216    Page 86    Version date: 12/16/[ADDRESS_1142394] criteria. Response rate is the primary endpoint for the phase II portion of the 
trial. For the purposes of this study, patients should be re-evaluated every 9 weeks in addition to 
undergoing a baseline scan. 
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1) (23). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 
criteria. 
 
12.1 Definitions  
 
Evaluable for toxicity: All patients who receive at least one dose of study drug (either CB-839 or 
capecitabine) will be included in the analysis of safety regardless of the duration of treatment. 
 
Evaluable for objective response: Only those patients who have measureable disease present at 
baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will 
be considered evaluable for response. These patients will have their response classified according 
to the definitions stated below. Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to 
the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable. 
 
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response: Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are 
evaluable, but do not meet the definitions of measureable disease, have received at least one cycle 
of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for non-target 
disease. The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression 
of the lesions. 
 
12.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable Disease: Measureable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions to 
be recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_1142395] x-ray, as ≥ [ADDRESS_1142396] scan, or ≥ [ADDRESS_1142397] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters). Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area will not be considered 
measureable. 
 
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measureable, a lymph node 
must be ≥ [ADDRESS_1142398] scan (CT sca n slice thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in followup, only the short axis will be measured and 
followed. 
 
Non-measureable disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis) are considered 
CASE 1216    Page 87    Version date: 12/16/2020 
  n
on-measureable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not 
followed by [CONTACT_462]) are considered as non-measureable. 
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measureable lesions if 
they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. 
 
Target lesions: All measureable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance, the next 
largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters 
(longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesion) for all target lesions will be calculated 
and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then 
only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
 
Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measureable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions  and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurement of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or 
in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout followup. 
 
12.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measureable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of treatment. 
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during followup. Imaging-based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be 
imaged, but are assessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
 
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measureable when they are superficial 
(e.g. skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. 
sk
in nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion is recommended. 
 
Chest x-ray: Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measureable lesions when they are clearly 
CASE 1216    Page 88    Version date: 12/16/[ADDRESS_1142399] and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesion on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1142400] slice thickness greater 
than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measureable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is 
also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans). 
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; 
however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI which greatly impact image 
quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable 
globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning 
sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, 
as with CT, the modality used at followup should be the same as was used at baseline and the 
lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the 
RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition 
protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed 
with breath-holding techniques, if possible. 
 
PET-CT: At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET-CT is 
not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. However, if the 
site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to 
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for 
RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately 
measuring cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces 
additional data, which may bias an investigator if it is not routine or serially performed. PET may 
not be used for making determinations regarding response to treatment. 
 
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed 
that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new 
lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_62553]. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in 
selected instances. 
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathologic response when 
biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete 
response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 
Tumor Markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response. 
 
Cytology, Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiated between partial responses 
CASE 1216    Page 89    Version date: 12/16/2020 
  (
PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g. residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ 
cell tumors where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease. 
 
12.4 Response Criteria  
 
Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Response Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all target lesions. Any 
pathologic lymph nodes (whether target or 
non-target) must have reduction in short 
axis to < 10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of 
diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum of diameters. 
Progressive Disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of 
diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study  (this 
includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative 
increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 
5 mm. 
Note:  the appearance of one or more new 
lesions is also considered progression. 
Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for 
PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest sum 
diameters while on study. 
 
Evaluation of Non-Target lesions 
 
Response Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level. All 
lymph nodes must be non-pathological in 
size (< 10 mm short axis). 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above 
the upper normal limit, they must normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response. 
CASE 1216    Page 90    Version date: 12/16/2020 
  N
on-CR/Non-PD 
[Incomplete response/Stable Disease (SD)] Persistence of one or more non-target 
lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits. 
Progressive Disease (PD) Appearance of one or more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression  of existing 
non-target lesions. Unequivocal 
progression  should not normally trump 
target lesion status. It must be representative 
of overall disease status change, not a single 
lesion increase. 
 
Although a clear progression of ‘non-target’ 
lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_823829], and the progression status 
should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_157773] (or PI). 
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started). The patient’s best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

xplanation. 
NOTE:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
 
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The duration of overall 
CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that 
progressive disease is objectively documented. 
 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started, including the baseline measurements. 
 
12.5 Progression Free Survival  
 
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time 
of progression or death, whichever occurs first.

14.2 Analytic Plan for Primary Objectives 
 
The phase I component of this study is a dose-escalation trial of CB-839 and capecitabine in 
patients with advanced solid tumors for whom there are no remaining treatment options or for 
whom capecitabine is an acceptable treatment. It has been designed to define the recommended 
phase II dose of CB-839 and capecitabine. A traditional 3+[ADDRESS_1142405] 75% of the doses of both CB-[ADDRESS_1142406] be replaced.  
 
In the phase II component of this study, the primary endpoint is progression free survival rate at 6 
months with a null hypothesis of 18% vs. a target of 36%. Employing a 2-stage design, and 
assuming 80% power and a 0.[ADDRESS_1142407] (<3/18 patients 
with stable disease at 6 months) will be 0.589. If at least 3 patients in 18 has stable disease or better 
at 6 months, an additional 22 patients will be treated (total of 40 patients). If antitumor activity is 
identified in the PIK3CA mutant population, we will consider amending the phase [ADDRESS_1142408] one dose of treatment will be 
included in the analysis. 
 
CASE 1216    Page 95    Version date: 12/16/[ADDRESS_1142409]-treatment samples only (tumor samples and platelet samples). All correlative continuous 
measurements will be summarized using mean +/- SEM, range and median; all categorical 
measurements will be summarized using frequencies and proportions. Change in these 
measurements in tumors before and after therapy will be assessed using paired Wilcoxon tests. 
Unpaired Wilcoxon tests will be used for assessment of glutaminase actively in post-treatment 
samples only.  Assuming a maximum of 40 patients (2-sided test with 0.05 significance level and 
80% power), for the paired T-test we can detect normalized differences of 4.5 to 18.2% for 
standard deviations of the difference between pairs ranging from 0.[ADDRESS_1142410] >98% power to detect a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.[ADDRESS_1142411] treatment tissue 
samples and compared for differences for all patients (n=40 patients maximum).  All of these 
analyses are exploratory, hence no power calculations are shown.   
 
14.[ADDRESS_1142412] 3+3 dose escalation design. 
As there are four dose levels to be assessed (and two minus dose levels if needed), a total of 9-24 
patients will be needed to complete the study. 
 
In the phase II portion of the study, disease control rate is the primary endpoint and the study will 
be conducted using a Simon two-stage design. As outlined in section 14.2, a minimum of 18 and 
a maximum of 40 patients will be required.  
 
14.6 Accrual Rate Estimate  
 
Accrual for this study will occur at the University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823831], both of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center. For 
the phase I portion of the trial, we anticipate that it will take approximately 6-7 months to complete 
this portion of the trial if all doses levels need to be evaluated. For the phase II portion of the study, 
between the two institutions, 719 colorectal cancer patients are seen annually. We estimate that 
approximately 30% of our patients will have measureable, metastatic disease and that 15% of 
patients will have a PIK3CA mutation, resulting in 32 eligible patients per year. Based on our 
proposed sample size of 18-40 patients, we anticipate that it will take approximately 18-40 months 
to accrue to the phase II portion of the trial.

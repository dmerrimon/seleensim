multicenter, study in subjects ≥12 years of age with CF who are homozygous for the 
F508del -CFTR  mutation and who are being treated with Orkambi.  
Subjects will be randomized to 1  of 4 treatment sequences that will each be composed 
of: Treatment Period  1  Washout  Treatment Period  2. 
This study includes the following:  
• Screening Period:  
• Day -28 to Day -1 for Orkambi+/HS - subjects  
• Day -56 to Day -29 for Orkambi -/HS-, Orkambi -/HS+, and Orkambi+/HS+ 
subjects  
• Run-in Period: Day -28 to Day -1 for Orkambi -/HS-, Orkambi -/HS+, and 
Orkambi+/HS+ subjects  
• Treatment Period  1 through Treatment Period  2: 
o Treatment Period  1: Day  1 (first dose of inhaled study drug) through  Day 28 
o Washout Period: Day 29 through Day 56  
o Treatment Period  2: Day 57 through Day 84

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   drug treatment(s) but who does not complete the remaining assessments in the 
treatment period during which study drug treatment(s) is discontinued.  
• Safety Follo w-up Telephone Contact: 28 days (+  3 days) after the Day 84 Visit; or 
28 days (+  3 days) after the Day [ADDRESS_1231081] who completes this visit but 
who will not be continuing into Treatment Period  2 (Note: Under certain 
circumstances, a safety Follo w-up Telephone Contact [CONTACT_880860], and 
a Safety Follow -up Visit may be required.)  
• A Safety Follow -up Visit will occur 28 days (+  3 days) after a subject’s last dose 
of study drug (whether inhaled study drug or lumacaftor/ivacaftor) in subjects 
who:  
o prematurely discontinue one or both study drugs during the course of either 
treatment period and do not complete the remaining assessments in the treatment period in which discontinuation occurred. In this circumstance, an ETT Visit is required in addition to the Safety Follow -up Visit (see 
Section  8.1.4 ). 
o have a clinical finding during the treatment period or during the 28 -day Safety 
Follow -up Period that requires follow -up in the estimation of the PI. An ETT 
Visit may or may not be required in this circumstance (see Section  8.1.4 ). 
  
Assessments  Efficacy: spi[INVESTIGATOR_038],  
Safety: adverse events, spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], clinical laboratory values (urine, serum and 
plasma chemistry, hematology, and coagulation studies), ECGs, physical examinations, vital  signs, and ophthalmologic examinations (for subjects <18  years of 
age at Screening only)  
PK: VX-371,  
 
 
  
Statistical Analyses  Statistical analysis details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), 
which will be finalized before the clinical database lock for the study.  
The primary efficacy objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with VX-[ADDRESS_1231082] deviation (SD) of [ADDRESS_1231083] an approximately 81% power to detect a 3  percentage point 
treatment difference in the mean absolute change in ppFEV
1 from study baseline at 
Day 28 between VX -371 + HS and HS alone. The study will have approximately 
80% power to detect a 3 percentage point (within treatment) change from baseline at Day 28 in ppFEV
1 for VX -371. A 2- sided significance level of 0.05 was used in the 
sample size calculations. The sample size also takes into consideration an assumed 
dropout rate of 10%.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute ch ange in ppFEV [ADDRESS_1231084] data in both treatment periods with weights 
based on the precision of these estimates.  
The estimated mean of the dependent variable, a 95% CI, and a 2 -sided P value will 
be provided for each treatment. Similarly, the estimated between -treatment 
differences along with the corresponding 95% CI and 2- sided P values will be 
presented. Additionally, a mixed model of repeated measures (MMRM) will be used with period, study baseline for ppFEV
1, visit, treatment, and treatment by [CONTACT_765], study 
baseline for ppFEV [ADDRESS_1231085] square means estimates at each visit within a given treatment as well as estimates of treatment difference at each visit or across all visits.  
 
  
IDMC Reviews  The independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will conduct regular planned 
safety reviews of study data as outlined in the IDMC charter.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects an estimated 70,[ADDRESS_1231098] in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an epi[INVESTIGATOR_139327] (Cl
-) channel 
activated by [CONTACT_315435] -dependent protein kinase A that is responsible for aiding in the 
regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion in various tissues.2 This function is 
defective in patients with CF due to a loss of either cell surface expression and/or function. 
More than [ADDRESS_1231099] prevalent mutation 
is an in -frame deletion in the CFTR gene resulting in a loss of phenylalanine at position 508 in 
the CFTR protein (F508del- CFTR) .[ADDRESS_1231100] 87% of patients with CF have at least 
1 copy of the  F508del- CFTR mutation, and approximately 47% have [ADDRESS_1231101]. The mucus 
build-up obstructs the airways and predisposes the patient to chronic lung infections.9 
Mucociliary clearance (MCC) is an important airway defense mechanism that is essential for respi[INVESTIGATOR_38324]. The primary function of MCC is to clear inhaled particles, including inflammatory and infectious agents, from the surface of the lung.
[ADDRESS_1231102] surface liquid (ASL) compromises the efficiency of MCC.
11 Inhaled therapi[INVESTIGATOR_880837]® (recombinant human 
dornase alfa, [COMPANY_002]/Genentech), which facilitates expectoration by [CONTACT_880865], and hypertonic saline (HS), which may improve airway surface hydration and improve MCC.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_880838], patients with CF 
experience progressive loss of lung function over time and remain at risk for suffering acute 
pulmonary exacerbations due to chronic bacterial airway infection, requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or treatment with antibiotics. The refore, additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_880839]. 
For reasons that are not fully understood, CF is also associated with a paradoxically increased activity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_880840] (ENaC). The resulting combination of inadequate secretion of chloride ions and excessive intracellular transport of sodium ions creates an osmotic gradient 
that results in relative dehydration of the secretions in the airway lumen.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
When applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_880841], ENaC inhibitors such as amiloride can decrease ENaC 
activity, increase ASL height, and increase MCC.14 While amiloride’s low potency, 
hyperkalemia, and short half -life in the airway  make it impractical as a clinical therapy, newer 
generations of inhaled  ENaC inhibitors featuring an amiloride pharmacophore have been 
designed to potently inhibit ENaC function directly on the respi[INVESTIGATOR_125752], while 
minimizing exposure to renal ENaC, thereby [CONTACT_880866].

cleavage, which can be due to constitutive proteases such as prostasin or by [CONTACT_880867]. Free neutrophil elastase activity is detectable in the sputum of patients with CF and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), especially 
during acute exacerbations. The combination of water loss from the ASL due to ENaC over 
activity and the increase in mucus production by [CONTACT_880868] s in CF exceeds the threshold required for optimal MCC. It 
is hypothesized that the inhibition of ENaC activity with VX -[ADDRESS_1231106] secretions rendering them more susceptible to MCC and cough clearance in subjects with CF.

5.3 Completed and Ongoing Clinical Studies With VX -371 
 
 

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.0 Page 23 of 80 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   5.3.2  Phase 2a Study with VX -371 
Parion is conducting a Phase 2a study (Parion Study G201) with P-1037 (VX-371) in subjects 
with CF. The goal of Study G201 is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX -371 with and 
without 4.2% HS. The study plans to enroll 150 subjects with CF. 
The 2  major differences between the Parion Phase 2a study and the present study are:  

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.0 Page 24 of 80 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • The Parion study is enrolling subjects with CF with no genotype restriction; the present study 
will enroll only subjects with CF who are homozygous for F508del- CFTR. 
• The Parion study excludes subjects being treated with any ivacaftor -containing regimen, 
which includes Orkambi, whereas the present study requires subjects to be treated with 
Orkambi throughout the study (see Section 5.4 for the rationale behind this requirement). 
5.4 Rationale for Present Study  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
The present study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX -371 formulated with 
4.2% HS in comparison to 4.2% HS alone on lung function over [ADDRESS_1231107] of treatment 
for this population, which includes lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination therapy (Orkambi), an 
FDA -approved treatment for CF in patients homozygous for the F508del- CFTR mutation.  
Throughout this protocol, the term “inhaled study drug” is used to refer to VX-371 + placebo, 
VX-371 + HS, HS, and placebo administered by [CONTACT_94274]. The term “study drug,” when it appears without a qualifier, is used to refer to both inhaled study drug and orally administered lumacaftor/ivacaftor . Lumacaftor/ivacaftor is the same drug as commercially available Orkambi, 
and these terms are used interchangeably.  
6 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
6.1 Primary Objective

 DESIGN 
8.1 Overview of Study Design  
This is a Phase  2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, incomplete block, crossover, 
multicenter, study in subjects ≥[ADDRESS_1231108] or Safety Follow- up Visit.  
Approximately 150 subj ects will be randomized to 1  of the 4 treatment sequences  as described in  
Table 8 -1. Each treatment sequence will comprise:  
Treatment Period  1   Washo ut   Treatment Period  2

A schematic of the study design is provided in Figure 8-1.  
The sponsor may decide to stop enrollment in the 2 treatment sequences containing 
VX-371 + placebo and placebo for administrative reasons (for example, unexpected difficulty with enrollment). Enrollment would continue in the 2 treatment sequences containing VX-371 + HS and HS to ensure adequate enrollment to maintain statistical power in the 2 treatment sequences yielding data for the study’s primary analysis. All planned analyses will be co nducted 
regardless of number of subjects enrolled.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Early Termination of Treatment Visit for a subject who discontinues from study dru g 
treatment(s) and who does not complete the remaining assessments in the treatment period 
during which study drug treatment(s) is discontinued.  
• Safety Follow -up Telephone Contact [CONTACT_67582] 28 days (+ 3 days) after the Day 84 Visit; or 
28 days (+ 3 days)  after the Day [ADDRESS_1231114] who completes this visit but who will 
not be continuing into Treatment Period 2. (Note: Under certain circumstances, a safety Follow-up Telephone Contact [CONTACT_880860], and a Safety Follow- up Visit may be 
required.) 
• A Safety Follow -up Visit will occur 28 days (+ 3 days) after a subject’s last dose of study 
drug (whether inhaled study drug or lumacaftor/ivacaftor) in subjects who:  
o prematurely discontinue one or both study drugs during the course of either treat ment 
period and do not complete the remaining assessments in the treatment period in which 
discontinuation occurred. In this circumstance, an ETT Visit is required in addition to the Safety Follow -up Visit (see Section  8.1.4).  
o have a clinical finding during the treatment period or during the 28-day Safety Follow-up Period that requires follow-up in the estimation of the PI. An ETT Visit may or may not be required in this circumstance (see Section  8.1.4).  
Maintenance of Stable Medication Regimen for CF:  
It is recommended that subjects remain on st able CF medication regimens from [ADDRESS_1231115] or Safety Follow-up Visit (other than as blinded inhaled 
study drug if allocated to a relevant treatment sequence). A stable medication regimen is defined as the current medication regimen that subjects have been following for at least 28  days before 
Day 1. Subjects are to be on stable CF medication (including Orkambi) for at least 28 days 
before dosing with inhaled study drug on Day 1. 
Specific requirements  apply to certain CF medications:  
• Subjects must be on a stable regimen of lumacaftor/ivacaftor for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1231116] . 
• Subjects who are on a stable regimen of a single inhaled antibiotic that is continuously administered should remain on this antibiotic through the Safety Follow-up Telephone Contact .  
• Subjects who are on a stable regimen of a single inhaled cycling antibiotic (e.g., Tobramycin 
Inhalation Solution [TOBI
®] regimen) should remain on this antibiotic through the Safety 
Follow-up Telephone Contact . Inhaled cycling antibiotics should be administered in 
28-day-on/28- day-off cycles.  
Clinic visits on Day  1 and Day 57 should be timed to occur exactly  at the start of an 
on-cycle; treatment during the on -cycle should then end after no more than  28 days.  

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.0 Page 29 of 80 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • At the time of study entry, subjects who are on an alternating regimen of inhaled cycling 
antibiotics that comprise continuous administration of antibi otics (e.g., TOBI administration 
alternating with Cayston®) should remain on these antibiotics according to their alternating 
regimens through the Safety Follow-up Telephone Contact.  
The first dose of inhaled study drug in each Treatment Period should coi ncide exactly  with 
the first dose of the same cycled inhaled antibiotic (e.g., if TOBI is being administered first 
and Cayston second in the cycle, the Day [ADDRESS_1231117] dose of TOBI). 
8.1.1  Screening 
Screening Visit assessmen ts are listed in  Table 3 -1. All subjects will complete the Screening 
Visit.  
Screening will occur between Day -28 and Day - 1 for Orkambi+/HS - subjects , and between 
Day -56 and Day - 29 for Orkambi -/HS-, Orkambi-/HS+, and Orkambi+/HS+ subjects. Screening 
will occur before the first dose of inhaled study drug to confirm that subjects meet the selection criteria for the study. The investigator (or an appropriate authorized designee at the study site) will obtain informed consent and assent (where applicable) from each subject. During the Screening Visit it should be determined whether the subject will have a Run -in Period.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   [IP_ADDRESS]  Repetition of Screening Assessment(s)  
Repetition of individual sc reening assessment(s) that did not meet eligibility criteria is not 
permitted with the following exceptions:  
• If there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g.,  hemolyzed sample) or equipment 
malfunction, collection of a repeat sample for the appropri ate laboratory test or assessment 
may be permitted with the approval of the medical monitor.  
• Exclusionary liver function test (LFT) levels or plasma potassium levels, which may be 
retested within 14  days of the original screening date.  
If screening spi[INVESTIGATOR_489359]/European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_139600],20 repeat

If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and completed 
within the screening window, then the subject is eligible for the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rescreening  
Subjects may be rescreened after discussion with, and approval from, the medical monitor. If a 
subject is rescreened, all  Screening Visit assessments will be repeated except for CF genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level (if serum FSH level was ≥40 mIU/mL during prior 
screening),  sweat chloride level, and the ophthalmologic examination (if the ophthalmologic 
examination was performed within the last 3  months before the Rescreening Visit). Subjects may 
only be rescreened once. If a subject is rescreened, the screening window will begin once the first rescreening assessment has been initiated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Extension of Screening Period Window  
A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 2 weeks for the following reasons:  
• Repetition of the Screening Period assessments (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Unexpected operational or logistic delays, or to meet the eligibility criteria  
• Additional time to conduct ophthalmologic examinations (Section 11.6.5)

8.1.3  Treatment Periods  
Treatment Period assessments are listed in  Table 3-3. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Period [ADDRESS_1231122] “on” day for single cycled inhaled antibiotics (e.g., 
TOBI) and the first day of a new “on” period for an inhaled antibiotic in a continuous alternating 
regimen,  
Inhaled study drug should be taken according to instructions provided. Study visits will occur on 
Day 1, Day 14, and Day 28. On Day 3, subjects will have a telephone contact [CONTACT_880871] 
(e.g., i
nquire about AEs). The last dose of inhaled study drug in Treatment Period 1 is the dose of 
inhaled study drug received at the Day  28 Visit.  
Note: All 
subjects, whether they are taking commercially available Orkambi or Vertex -supplied 
Orkambi, must take a dose of Orkambi on the morning of th e Day 1 Visit. All remaining doses of 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor for the duration of the study will be supplied by [CONTACT_880872] 1 Visit (see Section  10.2.2).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Washout Period  
Subjects will undergo a Washout Period of 28 days ( + 3 days) between the [ADDRESS_1231123] 14 days in their “off- period” for inhaled single cycled antibiotics or at 
least 14 days of the “alternate” antibiotic for a continuous cycled 2 antibiotic regimen.  
The Washout Period may be extended for acute upper or lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], pulmonary 
exacerbation, or  changes in therapy (including antibiotics); extension of the Washout Period 
must be discussed with the medical monitor.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Period [ADDRESS_1231124] “on” day for single cycled inhaled antibiotics (e.g., TOBI) and the first day of a new “on” period for an inhaled antibiotic in a continuous alternating regimen, provided that at least [ADDRESS_1231125] elapsed with no inhaled antibiotic (single cycled regimen) or the other antibiotic (continuous cycling of 2 antibiotics).  
In order to continue into Treatment Period 2, subjects must not have an acute upper or lower 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], pulmonary exacerbation, or changes in therapy (including antibiotics) for 
pulmonary disease within 28 days before the Day 57 Visit (first dose of inhaled study drug in Treatment  Period  2) and must not have any “non- CF-related” illness w ithin 2  weeks before the 
Day 57 Visit (first dose of inhaled study drug in Treatment Period  2). “Illness” is defined as an 
acute (serious or non-serious) condition (e.g., gastroenteritis). If the subject does not meet these criteria, then the continuation of the subject into Treatment Period  [ADDRESS_1231126] for safety purposes (e.g., inquire about adverse events).  
8.1.[ADDRESS_1231127] who prematurely discontinues inhaled study drug will continue to take 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Conversely, a subject who discontinues lumacaftor/ivacaftor will continue to take inhaled study drug. Subjects who prematurely discontinue one or both study drugs will be asked to complete the remain ing assessments in the treatment period during which treatment was 
discontinued. If all assessments are completed, an ETT Visit is not required.  
A subject who discontinues from study drug treatment(s) and who does not complete the 
remaining assessments in  the treatment period during which study drug treatment(s) is 
discontinued is required to complete an ETT Visit, which is to be scheduled as soon as possible after it is confirmed that the subject does not intend to complete the remaining assessments .  
A subject who prematurely discontinues from one or both study drugs in Treatment Period [ADDRESS_1231128] the Safety Fol low-up Visit (Section 8.1.6), and neither a Safety Follow-up Visit nor 
a Safety Follow -up Telephone Contact [CONTACT_60296].  
If the subject withdraws consent for the study, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_1231129] is scheduled to occur 28 days (+3 days) after the Day  84 
Visit for subjects who complete this visit, or 28 days (+3 days) after the Day 28 Visit for subjects who complete this visit but who will not be continuing into Treatment Period 2 (see Section  8.1.4).  
Under certain circumstances, a s afety Follow-up Telephone Contact [CONTACT_880860], and 
a Safety Follow -up Visit may be required, as delineated in Section 8.1.6. 
8.1.6  Safety Follow- up Visit  
Safety Follow -up Visit assessments are listed in  Table 3-4.  
A Safety Follow -up Visit will occur 28 days (+ 3 days) after a subject’s last dose of study drug 
(whether inhaled study drug or lumacaftor/ivacaftor) in subjects who:  
• prematurely discontinue one or both study drugs during the course of either treatment period 
and do not complete the remaining assessments in the treatment period in which 
discontinuation occurred. In this circumstance, an ETT Visit is required in addition to the Safety Follow -up Visit (see Section  8.1.4).  

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.0 Page 33 of 80 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • have a clinical finding during the treatment period or during the 28-day Safety Follow-up 
Period that requires follow-up in the estimation of the PI. An ETT Visit may or may not be 
required in this circumstance (see Section  8.1.4).  
8.1.7  Independent Data Monitoring Comm ittee 
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will be formed for this study. The IDMC will conduct regular, planned reviews of study data with the primary goal of evaluating the safety of the inhaled study drug regimen to ensure the subjects’ safet y (Section  12.3.4). Procedural 
details of the IDMC’s structure and function, frequency of meetings, and data planned for review will be included in  the IDMC charter.   
8.2 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens  
8.2.1  Study Design 
This Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, incomplete block, crossover, multic
enter study in subjects ≥12 years of age with CF who are homozygous for the 
F508del- CFTR mutation and receiving stable Orkambi treatment is designed to evaluate the 
safety, efficacy, and PK of treatment with VX-371 in 4.2%
 HS compared to 4.2% HS alone.  
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design was selected to avoid observer bias and reduce symptoms or outcomes arising from the investigator’s or the subject’s knowledge of treatment. A crossover design in which subjects are randomized to [ADDRESS_1231130] comparison of selected t reatment effects with increased statistical 
power. A 28-day washout period is judged to be of sufficient duration for all subjects to return to their baseline values for FEV
1 and to accommodate synchronization with cycling inhaled 
antibiotics.  
There are 2  primary endpoints; the first is to evaluate safety and tolerability, and the second is to 
evaluate efficacy as measured by [CONTACT_880873] 1 from study baseline at Day 28 
in each Treatment Period. Although the primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX -371 in 4.2% HS versus 4.2% HS alone, 2 additional treatment sequences will compare 
VX-371 in 0.17% saline (placebo) versus 0.17% saline (placebo). These comparisons will provide insight with respect to the effect of VX-[ADDRESS_1231131] were needed and supported enrollment of pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age. Further, the nonclinical safety toxicology data (see the VX- 371 Investigator’s 
Brochure for details) supports 28 days of continuous treatment of VX-371 in the current study.  
8.2.3  Rationale for Study Assessments  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] : Lung function in CF declines with age and is a significant predictor of mortality.
21 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (as measured by [CONTACT_10266]) is the most widely implemented standardized assessment to 
evaluate lung function.22,[ADDRESS_1231132] clinically accepted measure of disease progression in CF, is the recommended primary clinical endpoint in efficacy studi es for CF.

A sweat chloride test must be performed at the Screening Visit if an eligible sweat chloride value is not available in the subject’s medical records and the Screening Visit value is needed to establish eligibility. For subjects using sweat chloride values documented in their medical records to establish eligibility, the sweat chloride test at the Screening Visit is optional. If both results  are available,  the result from the 
Screening Visit will be used to determine eligibility.  
6. Subjects who are homozygous for F508del -CFTR.  If the CFTR screening genotype result is 
not received before randomization, a previous CFTR genotype lab report may be used to establish eligibility. Note: Subjects who have been randomized and whose screening 
genotype does not confirm study eligibility must be discontinued from the study as described in Section 9.5.

9.[ADDRESS_1231143]’s CF 
medications, other medications, and herbal and naturopathic remedies administered from [ADDRESS_1231144]’s source documents and electronic case report form (eCRF). For subjects who are screened but are not subsequently enrolled into the study, details of prior medication will only be documented in the subject’s source documents. 
• Subjects must remain on a stable medication (and supplement) regimen for their CF from the 
Run-in Period through the Day [ADDRESS_1231145] 28 days before the Day 1 Visit; this includes treatment with Orkambi but excludes treatment with HS. Subjects must not initiate long- term treatment with new medication from [ADDRESS_1231146]  unless it is discussed and approved by [CONTACT_35011]. Guidelines for stable inhaled antibiotic regimens for CF are as follows: 
o Subjects w ho are taking daily inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics 
should remain on that regimen throughout the study. 
o Subjects who are on inhaled cycling antibiotics should continue on their prior schedule. 
The timing of the first dose of inhaled study drug in Treatment Periods 1 and 2 (i.e., the Day 1 and Day 57 Visits, respectively) should be timed to occur exactly  at the start of an 
on-cycle synchronized; treatment during the on-cycle should then end after no more than  
[ADDRESS_1231147] dose of the same cycled inhaled 
antibiotic (e.g., if TOBI is being administered first and Cayston second in the cycle, the 
Day [ADDRESS_1231148] dose of TOBI). 
• Information about bronchodilator use during the study will be collected and documented. 
Subjects who are using a bronchodilator must have their spi[INVESTIGATOR_155393] 11.5.1. 

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.0 Page 39 of 80 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   9.4.1  Prohibited Medications  
Prohibited medications are described in Table 9-1 . 
The use of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A substrates is not prohibited in this study, but 
investigators need to be aware that lumacaftor appears to be a strong inducer of this CYP isoenzyme. Therefore, the efficacy of drugs extensively metabolized by [CONTACT_880876]. Each investigator should evaluate the benefit/risk ratio of using such drugs with lumacaftor during this study. Investigators should discuss any concerns regarding the use of CYP3A substrates during this study with the medical monitor. 
The use of CYP2C and 2B6 substrates are not prohibited in this study, but investigators need to 
be aware that lumacaftor has been shown in vitro to induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and 
CYP2C19; inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 has also been observed in vitro. Additionally, in vitro studies suggest that ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, concomitant use of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor with CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates may alter the exposure of these substrates. Each investigator should evaluate the benefit to risk ratio of using such drugs with lumacaftor and ivacaftor during this study and discuss the use of these substrates during this study with the medical monitor. 
A non-exhaustive study prohibitions and cautions list for food and medications will be provided 
in the Study Reference Manual.

applicable (see Section  8.1.4), and follow up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs. 
Subjects who are randomized on the basis of a historical genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_880843]. 
These subjects will undergo ETT and/or Safety Follow-up Visits per Sections  8.1.4 and 8.1.6, 
and will then be discontinued from the study. After discontinuation from study drug treatment, these subjects will not undergo any further assessments other than those performed at the ETT and/or Safety Follow- up Visits.  
If the subject withdraws consent for the study, no further evaluations will be performed and no additional data will be collected. Vertex may retain and continue to  use any data collected before 
such withdrawal of consent. 

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.[ADDRESS_1231150] will be withdrawn from study drug treatment for any of the following reasons: 
• Vertex, regulatory authorities, or the site’s institutional review board (IRB) or independent 
ethics committe e (IEC) close the study.  
• A female subject or a female partner of a male subject has a confirmed pregnancy.  
• A subject has persistent and severe bronchospasm related to study drug administration. 
• Development of a life- threatening AE or a serious adverse even t (SAE) that places him/her at 
immediate risk, and discontinuation of study treatment deemed necessary. 
A subject may be withdrawn from study drug treatment after a discussion between the 
investigator and the medical monitor for any of the following reasons:  
• Development of a medical condition that requires prolonged concomitant therapy with a 
prohibited medication or prolonged interruption of the study drug. 
• Noncompliance with study requirements. 
• An increase in transaminases (ALT or AST) according to evaluations and management described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
• A potassium level >ULN. A confirmatory potassium level may be drawn at the discretion of the investigator before making the decision to remove a subject from the study. Refer to 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for further guidance on treatment of hyperkalemia.  
9.6 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn during the Screening or Run-in periods may be replaced at the discretion of the Sponsor. Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn during the study drug Treatment Period(s) will not be replaced. 
10 STUDY DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT  
10.1 Preparation and Dispensing  
Study drug may be dispensed only under the supervision of the investigator or an authorized

10.2 Administration  
10.2.1  Nebulizer  
Inhaled study drug will be administered bid approximately 10 to 12 hours apart (Section 8.2.2) 
by a PARI eF low nebulizer. The nebulizer device (nebulizer and handset) will be provided to the 
subject for use with the inhaled study drug at the Day [ADDRESS_1231151]. A new nebulizer 
handset will be provided f or replacement at the Day 57 Visit.  

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.0 Page 41 of 80 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Subjects are required to use the correctly assembled device, into which inhaled study drug has 
been added, and to nebulize through oral inhalation while sitting up, with the device held 
horizontally and breathing more deeply than normal tidal breathing. This should be continued until the nebulizer device indicates that all inhaled study drug has been delivered.  
A replacement nebulizer and/or handset may be provided at other times during the study if 
necessary (Section  10.9).  
10.2.2  Lumacaftor in Combination With Ivacaftor  
All subjects are to be on a stable regimen of lumacaftor/ivacaftor for at least 28 days before the Day 1 Visit and are to continue taking lumacaftor/ivacaftor through the Safety Follow-up 
Telephone Contact.  
Subjects who are taking commercially available Orkambi at Screening (i.e., Orkambi+/HS - and 
Orkambi+/HS+ subjects) will continue to take their commercially available Orkambi during the 
Screening Period. Subjects who are Orkambi+/HS+ will continue to take t heir commercially 
available Orkambi during the Run-in Period while they washout from HS. The last dose of commercially available Orkambi for Orkambi+/HS - and Orkambi+/HS+ subjects  will be the 
morning dose of the Day 1 Visit.  
Subjects not already being tre ated with commercially available Orkambi (i.e., Orkambi- ) will be 
provided with lumacaftor/ivacaftor by [CONTACT_880877] -in Period and must continue 
to take it for the remainder of the study (i.e., through the Safety Follow-up Telephone Conta ct); 
for these subjects, the last dose of lumacaftor/ivacaftor during the Run- in Period will be the 
morning dose of the Day 1 Visit.  All subjects, whether they are taking commercially available Orkambi or Vertex -supplied 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor, must take a dose of Orkambi on the morning of the Day 1 Visit. All 
remaining doses of lumacaftor/ivacaftor for the duration of the study (i.e., through Safety 
Follow-up Telephone Contact) will be supplied by [CONTACT_880872] [ADDRESS_1231152] not take both comme rcially available Orkambi and Vertex -supplied lumacaftor/ivacaftor (i.e., double 
dosing must be avoided). 
Subjects are to take 2 tablets (each containing lumacaftor 200 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg) orally q12h 
with fat-containing food. Examples of appropriate fat-containing foods include eggs, avocados, nuts, butter, peanut butter, cheese pi[INVESTIGATOR_6107], whole-milk dairy products (such as whole milk, cheese, and yogurt), etc. If a subject misses a dose and remembers the missed dose within [ADDRESS_1231153] should skip that dose and resume the normal schedule for the following dose. A double dose should not be taken to make up for the forgotten dose (Section  10.6.2).  
Arrangements will be made for the return of any unused lumacaftor/ivacaftor for final accountability (refer to the Pharmacy Manual for more detail).  
10.[ADDRESS_1231154] met all eligibility criteria. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio (VX-

10.12  Blinding and Unblinding 
This is a double-blind study. 
10.12.1  Blinding  
The subjects and all site personnel, including the investigator, the site monitor, and the study 
team, will be blinded with the exception of the following: 
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject 
in the event of a life- threatening medical emergency  
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject and the fetus in the event of a pregnancy 
• Vertex Global Patient Safety (GPS) and Regulatory Affairs personnel to satisfy SAE processing and reporting regulations 
• External vendor (unblinded) statistician preparing the final (production) randomization list 
who is not part of the study team 
• Vertex IXRS Management for IXRS oversight and system administration  
• IDMC  
• Vendor preparing the unblinded analysis for the IDMC  
• The bioanalytical external vendor personnel assigned to the study and Vertex Bioanalysis 
CRO Monitors who will not be participating in the study team 
• The medical monitor may, for matters relating to safety concerns, unblind individual subjects at any time  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_139336], knowledge of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_139337] a subject has been administered active inhaled study drug or placebo. Therefore, during 
the conduct of the study, the Vertex study team will have no access to the postdose s pi[INVESTIGATOR_880844].

Furthermore, subjects and their caregivers should not be informed of their 

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.[ADDRESS_1231164]’s treatment by [CONTACT_14450]’s study treatment is necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investigators will use their best judgment as to whether to unblind without first attempting to contact [CONTACT_14451]. If investigators deem it not necessary to unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact [CONTACT_14451]. 
If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the medical monitor, they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding without having successfully reached and discussed the situation with the medical monitor. 
Contact [CONTACT_14452] (or appropriate backup) will be provided in a 
separate document.  
In addition, the Vertex Medical Information Call Center  will answer calls 
24 hours a day, 7 
days a week, 365 days of the year, and will triage these calls to the study 
medical monitor or appropriate backup. 
If a subjec
t’s treatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent 
clinical situation, the medical monitor will be notified within [ADDRESS_1231165]’s study file. Information about the treatment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be maintained in a secure location with controlled access and will not be shared with the sponsor (Vertex), contract 
research organization (CRO), or any site personnel (other than the physician treating the subject). In addition, the investigator will consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding will be considered an SAE, according to the regulatory definitions or criteria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to Vertex GPS or designee, per Section 13.1. 
Vertex GPS or designee will also unblind any SAE reports in compliance with regulatory 
reporting requirements. In addition, Vertex may, for matters relating to safety concerns, unblind individual subjects a t any time.  
[ADDRESS_1231166] and disease characteristics i nclude the following: demographics, medical history, height, 
weight, and sweat chloride. 
Medical history will be elicited from each subject during screening. Based on the medical 
history, the subject will be assessed for any disqualifying medical condition s as specified in the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. The medical history shall include a complete review of systems, past medical and surgical histories, and any allergies.

Laboratory Manual.  
Additional Evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. 
Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by [CONTACT_577234]. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94248]), the investigator may make the determination of an AE on the basis of the local laboratory value. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Elevation of Liver Function Test Parameters  
It is strongly recommended that subjects with new ALT or AST elevations of ≥3 × ULN and 
clinical symptoms be followed closely, inc luding repeat confirmatory testing performed by [CONTACT_315452] [ADDRESS_1231177] the tests repeated and 
sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours). 
Study Drug Interruption  
Study drug administration must be interrupted immediately, and the medical monitor must be 
notified, if any of the following criteria is met:  
• ALT or AST ≥8 × ULN  
• ALT or AST ≥5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN in association with total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice 
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be followed closely for clinical progression. 
If no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, or alcohol 
ingestion) for the elevated transaminases is identified, regardless of whether ALT or AST levels have improved, study drug treatment must be discontinued, in consul tation with the medical 
monitor. Subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases should have their transaminases monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline.  

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.0 Page 53 of 80 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Resumption of Study Drug 
If a convincing alternative etiology is identified for the elevated transaminases (ALT, AST, 
gamma glutamyl transpeptidase , alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin), study drug may be 
resumed when transaminases return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, whichev er is higher. Approval 
of the medical monitor is required before resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases must be assessed weekly for [ADDRESS_1231178] 
be discontinued, regardless of the presumed etiology. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hyperkalemia  
Subjects with a potassium level that is ≤0.[ADDRESS_1231179] a blood sample collecte d for a repeat evaluation of plasma potassium 
within 7 (± 2) days. 
The standard of care for management of hyperkalemia should be applied. A thorough 
investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject’s potassium level should be followed closely.  
If hyperkalemia occurs, inhaled study drug should be interrupted until the plasma potassium has stabilized in the normal range. If no convincing temporary or possibly reversible alternative etiology (e.g., oral intake of potassium, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, admission of repeated fist-clenching during phlebotomy, hemolyzed sample) for the elevated potassium is identified, study drug treatment must be discontinued regardless of whether the level has im proved; this decision should be made in consultation with the medical 
monitor. Subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated potassium should have their potassium levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline. 
11.6.3  Physical Exa minations and Vital Signs  
A full physical examination of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at 
the Screening Visit, ETT Visit, and Safety Follow -up Visit (see  Table 3 -1 and Table 3-4). At 
other visits, abbreviated physical examinations will be performed before dosing with inhaled study drug (see Table 3-3 ). 
A physical examination includes a review of the following systems: head/neck/thyroid; eyes/ears/nose/throat (EENT); respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; ca rdiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; 
musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examinations will be reported as AEs.  
The abbreviated physical examination will include an assessment of the following body systems: head/neck/thyroid, EENT, cardiovascular system, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], skin, and abdomen.  
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and dia stolic), temperature, pulse rate, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. These will be assessed following a [ADDRESS_1231180] 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 3 -1, Table 3-3, and Table 3-4). Additional standard 12- lead 
ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. During the Treatment Period, 

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.0 Page 54 of 80 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   the ECG will be performed 60 (± 30) minutes after the completion of inhaled study drug dosing. 
The performance of all ECGs will adhere to the following: 
• The subject will be instructed to rest in the seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes 
before having an ECG performed. 
The ECG traces will be read manually at the study site at the Screening Visit and Safety 
Follow- up Visit. A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by [CONTACT_306025]. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring 
during the study through the Safety Follow-up Visit will be recorded as AEs.  
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to 
baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >4 5 msec from the baseline or an absolute 
QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be performed approximately 2  to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF 
values from these repeated ECGs remains  above the threshold value (>45 msec from baseline or 
≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2  successive 
ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. 
If the QTcF value remains above t he threshold value (>45 msec from the average of the 
3 predose values on Day 1 or ≥500 msec) on repeated measurement or is noted on >[ADDRESS_1231181] their QTc monitored closely until it normalizes or returns to baseline.  
11.6.5  Ophthalmologic Examination 
All pediatric subjects <1 8 years of age will undergo an ophthalmologic examination at the 
Screening Visit. Pediatric subjects <[ADDRESS_1231182] dose of study drug and completion of either the ETT Visit or the Safety Follow- up Visit.  
The ophthalmologic examination includes 
• measurement of best corrected distance visual acuity of each eye;  
• measurement of lens refracting power (e.g., autorefractor or ophthalmoscopy streak 
following cycloplegia); and 
• pharmacologically -dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp.  
These examinations must be conducted by a licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist. The 
screening ophthalmologic examination must be completed and the results reviewed before enrollment. The Screening Visit ophthalmologic examination does not need to be repeated if there is documentation of an examination that met protocol criteria, and that it was conducted within 3 months before the Screening Period, or if there is documentation of bilateral lens removal.  
In addit ion, at the Screening Visit, the following history will be obtained for all subjects: 

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.0 Page 55 of 80 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • History of steroid use 
• History or presence of diabetes  
• Any prior ophthalmologic or optometric examinations 
• History of trauma to the eye  
• Any family history of glaucoma, congenital cataracts, or cataracts arising later in life  
• Use of corrective lenses (contact [CONTACT_139390])  
• History of prolonged exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light and use of sunglasses 
• History of exposure to secondhand smoke 
If a clinically significant lens opacity or cataract is identified at Screening, the medical monitor 
must be notified. Additional ophthalmologic examinations may be required if a lens opacity or cataract is identified at Screening. The medical monitor should be notified o f any additional 
ophthalmologic examinations.

11.6.7  Contraception and Pregnancy  
The effects of VX -371 on conception, pregnancy, and lactation in humans are not known.  
The effects of lumacaftor/ivacaftor on conception, pregnancy, and lactation in humans are not 
known. Neither lumacaftor nor ivacaftor showed any genotoxic potential in a standa rd battery of 
in vitro (Ames, Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration) and in vivo (mouse micronucleus) studies. Lumacaftor and ivacaftor were each found to be non- teratogenic in 
reproductive toxicology studies in rats and rabbits (see the lumaca ftor/ivacaftor Investigator’s 
Brochure). However, a metabolite of lumacaftor, M28-lumacaftor, given to pregnant rats at very high levels far beyond levels observed in humans (>100-fold) produced fetal malformations. The significance of this finding in humans is unclear, but is highly unlikely to be of any clinical significance. Subjects should follow the contraception requirements outlined in this study protocol. The effects of lumacaftor/ivacaftor on the PK of hormonal contraceptives are not known; however , since lumacaftor is an inducer of CYP3A, it may reduce the effectiveness of 
hormonal contraceptives. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Contraception 
Participation in this study requires a commitment from the subject and his/her partner to use at 
least [ADDRESS_1231183] dose of study drug (unless otherwise noted) and until [ADDRESS_1231184] dose of study drug. 
Contraception for the couple is waived for the following:  
• True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,  calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.0 Page 56 of 80 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • If the male is infertile (e.g.,  bilateral orchiectomy). Infertility may be documented through 
examination of a semen specimen or by [CONTACT_94299]. 
• If the female is of non -childbearing potential, per the following: 
o Documented hysterectomy or a bilateral oophorectomy/salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936]-oophorectomy. 
o Postmenopausal: continuous amenorrhea for at least 12 months and serum FSH levels ≥40 mIU/mL.  
o Has not achieved menarche (has not had her first menstrual period). If a female achieves menarche during the study, she will need to follow acceptable methods of contraception or abstinence.  
For subjects for whom contracept ion methods are not waived due to one of the reasons 
cited above, the following are acceptable contraceptive methods:  
Table 11-4 Acceptable Methods of Contraception  
Male subjects and their female 
(non- study) partners  • Male vasectomy [ADDRESS_1231185] -
vasectomy semen analysis for sperm  
• Male or female condom with or without spermicide (either as a single 
product if commercially available and/or allowed according to local 
regulations; otherwise condom and spermicide as separate products)  
• Female bilateral tubal ligation performed at least 6 months previously  
• Female diaphragm, cervical cap, or vaginal sponge, each with spermicide 
(where available).  
• Female continuous use of an  intrauterine device (non -hormone releasing 
or hormone releasing) for at least 90 days  
• Female combined (estrogen and progestogen -containing) or progestogen -

a Hormonal contraceptives are not considered an acceptable method in female study subjects because of the 
potential for a drug -drug interaction with lumacaftor/ivacaftor resulting in reduced exposure and contraception 
failure; however, female subjects are not required to discontinue their  use of hormonal contraceptives as long as 
they agree to use an acceptable method of contraception as described above.  
Important notes:  
• Hormonal contraceptives are not considered an acceptable method in female study subjects 
because of the potential for a drug -drug interaction with lumacaftor/ivacaftor resulting in 
reduced exposure and contraception failure; however, female subjects are not required to 

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.0 Page 57 of 80 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   discontinue their use of hormonal contraceptives as long as they agree to use an acceptable 
method of contraception as described  in Table 11-4. 
• Local requirements may prohibit the use of some of these acceptable methods listed above. 
Please contact [CONTACT_64168]. 
• If applicable, additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to local regulations and/or requirements. 
• Male and female subjects who are not sexually active at the time of screening must agree to follow the contraceptive requirements of this study if they become sexually active.  
• Female condom used with male condom (as a double method of contraception) is not an 
acceptable method of contraception due to risk of tearing; a different acceptable method of birth control must be used as described in Table 11-4. 
• Male subjects must not donate sperm after the first dose of study drug, throughout the study, 
and for [ADDRESS_1231187] dose of study drug. 
• Female subjects and fem ale partners of male subjects should not plan to become pregnant 
during the study through [ADDRESS_1231188] dose of study drug. 
• Female subjects should not nurse a child from the start of study drug dosing through [ADDRESS_1231189] dose of study drug. 
Unique situations that may not fall within the above specifications may be discussed with the 
medical monitor on an individual basis. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy  
Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during study treatment and for [ADDRESS_1231190] dose of study drug(s). 
If a subject or the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant while participating in the study, study drug must be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator must notify the medical monitor and Vertex GPS within 24  hours of the site’s knowledge of the subject’s (or 
partner’s) pregnancy using the Pregnancy Information Collection Form.  
The subject or partner will be followed until the end of the pregnancy and the infant will be 
followed for 1 year after the birth, provided informed consent is obtained. A separate ICF (and assent form, if applicable) will be provided to explain these follow- up activities. Pregnancy itself 
does not constitute an AE.

Medications used in this study will be coded by [CONTACT_440515] - Enhanced and categorized as follows:  
• Prior medication:  any medication that  started before the first dose of inhaled study drug, 
regardless of when it ended. 
• Concomitant medication:  medication continued or newly received during the TE period for 
Treatment Period 1 or Treatment Period 2.  
A given medication can be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or both 
prior and concomitant. If a medication has a missing or partial missing start/end date or time and it cannot be determined whether the medication was taken before initial dosing or concomitantly, it will be considered as prior and concomitant. 
Prior medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_19016], and concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_139393].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Exposure and Compliance  
Exposure to study drug (i.e., duration of treatment) will be summarized by [CONTACT_880883] a subject received (in days), defined as the last day minus the first day of study drug plus 1 within the Treatment Period.  
Study drug compliance will be calculated as  follows:  
100 × [1 – (Total number of days study drug  interrupted) / (Duration of study drug exposure)] 
The total number of days of study drug interrupted is defined as the sum of (number of days of study drug interrupted in each interruption interval); where number of days of study drug interrupted in each interval is defined as the interruption end date – the 
corresponding interruption start date + 1.  
Duration of treatment and study drug compliance will be summarized by [CONTACT_139395].  
12.3.3  Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of VX -371 plus HS versus 
HS alone. For efficacy analysis, the statistical inference will be based on change from study baseline.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Primary Efficacy Variables  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV
[ADDRESS_1231203] dat a in both treatment periods with weights based on the precision of these estimates. 
The estimated mean of the dependent variable, a 95% CI, and a 2 -sided P value will be provided 
for each treatment. Similarly, the estimated between treatment differences al ong with the 
corresponding 95% CI and 2-sided P  values will be presented. Additionally, a mixed model of 
repeated measures (MMRM) will be used with period , study baseline for ppFEV

treatment, and treatment by [CONTACT_765], study baseline for ppFEV [ADDRESS_1231204] data listings.  
The overall safety profile of inhaled study drug will be assessed in terms of the following safety 
and tolerability en dpoints: 
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAEs)  
• Clinical laboratory values (i.e., hematology, serum and plasma chemistry, coagulation 
studies, and urine studies) 
• ECG results  
• Vital signs  
• Ophthalmologic examination results (for pediatric subje cts <18 years of age only) 
• Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events 
For analysis purposes, AEs will be classified as pretreatment AEs or TEAEs, defined as follows:  
Pre-treatment AEs are defined as AEs that started before the start of inhaled study drug dosing. 
TEAE: any AE that increased in severity or that was newly developed during the TE period for 
Treatment Period 1 or Treatment Period 2. An AE that starts (or increases in severity) during a 
specific Treatment Period will be attributed to the inhaled study drug th e subject was receiving 
during the Treatment Period.  
For AEs with missing or partial start date, if there is no clear evidence that the AEs started (or 
increased in severity) before the first dose, the start date will be imputed to the first dosing date and the AE assigned to the treatment in Treatment Period 1. 
AE summary tables will be presented for TEAEs only and will include the following: 
• All TEAEs  
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_2073]  
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_2074]

, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND ADMI NISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting 
13.1.1  Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relatio nship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.0 Page 67 of 80 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   [IP_ADDRESS]  Clinically Significant Assessments 
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to ha ve clinically -significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g.,  urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin). 
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the following: 
• Concomitant s igns or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment 
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence
  of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The det
ermination of whether the 
study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_093].  
A laboratory value that is Grade [ADDRESS_1231206]’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time ICF is signed until the following time points:  
• For subjects who do not enroll: until time of screen failure (e.g., screen failure, withdrawal of 
consent) 
• For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow-up Telephone Contact: [CONTACT_880887]-up Telephone Contact 
• For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow -up Visit, the earliest  of: 
o [ADDRESS_1231207] dose of inhaled study drug 
(see Section  8.1.4).  
All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
[ADDRESS_1231208]’s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE:  
• Description of the event 
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious” 
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) 
• Severity  

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.0 Page 68 of 80 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed August 
2015). A Es of CTCAE Grades  4 and 5 will be documented as “life- threatening.” In considering 
the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the CTCAE. The 
severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13-1.  
Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly  interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening (Grade  4) Any adverse drug experience that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, 
at immediate risk of dea th  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to the study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2. 
Table 13-[ADDRESS_1231209] been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re- exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such 
as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject’s medical record).  
 

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.0 Page 69 of 80 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   [IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3.  
Table 13-[ADDRESS_1231210] to an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to contin ue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Outcome 
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4. 
Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/Resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/Resolved With 
Sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not Recovered/Not 
Resolved (Continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death.  “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow -up) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
• Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of 
the study drugs) 

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.0 Page 70 of 80 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home)  
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139355], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155409], unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139357]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94253] (e.g.,  social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE. 
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining  expedited regulatory reporting obligations.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the Safety Follow -up Telephone Contact, regardless of causality, will be reported by [CONTACT_880888] [ADDRESS_1231211] and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24  hours . 
SAEs will be recorded on the Ver tex Clinical Trial Safety Information Collection Form 
(hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_880889](s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study 
drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the SAE Form.

13.[ADDRESS_1231218] will be entered into a CRF by [CONTACT_94326] a secure, validated, web -based ele ctronic data capture (EDC) application. Vertex 
will have read -only access to site- entered clinical data in the EDC application.  
Instances of missing, discrepant, or uninterpretable data will be queried with the investigator for resolution. Any changes to study data will be made to the CRF and documented in an audit trail, which will be maintained within the clinical database.  
13.4 Monitoring  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or approved by [CONTACT_139417]. On- site checking of the CRFs/SAE Forms for completeness and 
clarity, cross -checking with source documents, and clarification of administrative matters will be 
performed.  
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_139411]. Monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_782] a representative of Vertex, or designee (study site monitor), who will review the CRFs/SAE Forms and source documents. The study site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to the protocol design and regulatory require ments.  

Protocol VX15- 371-101, Version  3.[ADDRESS_1231219]. It is the investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject’s CRF. Source documentation supporting the CRF data will indicate the subject’s participation in the study and will document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, other observations, and subject status. 
The investigator, or designate d representative, will complete the CRF as soon as possible after 
information is collected.  
The audit trail entry will show the user’s identification information and the date and time of any 
correction. The investigator will provide formal approval of all the information in the CRFs, including any changes made to the CRFs, to endorse the final submitted data for the subjects for whom the investigator is responsible.  
Vertex will retain the CRF data  and corresponding audit trails. A copy of the final archival CRF 
in the form of a CD or other electronic media will be placed in the investigator’s study  file.

Protocol Title:  A Long -Term, O pen Label Study to Evaluate the Ability  of Tenapanor 
Alone or in Combination with Sevelamer to Treat to Goal Serum 
Phosphorus in Patients with End -Stage Renal  Disease on Dialysis  
(NORMALIZE).  
Sponsor:  Ardelyx, Inc.  
Study Phase:  Phase 3 
Objectives : The primary objective of this study is: 
• To evaluate the ability of tenapanor alone or in combination with 
sevelamer to achieve serum phosphorus concentration (sP) within 
the population reference range (sP > 2.5 and ≤4.5 mg/dL) in 
patients with end -stage renal  disease on dialysis with 
hyperphosphatemia (>4.5 mg/dL).  
The secondary objectives of this study are:  
• To compare the phosphorus lowering effect of  tenapanor and 
sevelamer alone in pat
ients with sP >4.5 m g/dL to patients treated 
with a com bination of tenapanor and sevelamer. 
• To evaluate the effect of tenapanor alone and in combination with sevelamer on the proportion of patie
nts reaching serum 
phosphorus targets defined as ≤4.5 mg/dL.  
• To evaluate the effect of the addition of tenapanor to patie nts 
taking sevelamer on the percentage reduction in the sevelamer 
dose. 
• To evaluate the effect of tenapanor alone and in combination with 
sevelamer
 on intact fibroblast growth factor 23 ( iFGF23 ). 
• To evaluate the effect of tenapanor alone and in combination with sevelamer on the  Kidney Disea 
se Quality of Life (KDQoL)  
survey. 
• To evaluate the effect of tenapanor alone and in combination with 
sevelamer
 on the Dialysis Symptom Index (DSI)  survey 
(for English speakers only). 
• To compare the long- term safety of tenapanor alon e and in 
combination with sevelamer.  
The exploratory objectives of this study are: 
• To evaluate the effect of tenapanor alone and in combination with 
sevelamer
 on PTH, CRP, aldosterone and other cardio- renal  
biomarkers (These data may not be part of the study report.) 
• To collect and store plasma/serum for future exploratory research into serum/plasma biomarkers related to cardio -renal disease 
and/or mineral metabolism or that may influence the response

Number of Sites:  40-[ADDRESS_631786]  on hemodialysis (HD ) or 
peritoneal dialysis (PD).  
Study Design  Patients who complete the TEN -02-301 study (PHREEDOM) may be 
eligible to enroll into TEN -02-401 (NORMALIZE).  
Patients will be required to sign an ICF and meet all inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. No baseline asse ssments will be performed as part of this 
protocol; all baseline data for TEN -02-401 will be taken from the 
TEN -02-301 End of Treatment (EOT) visit. Patients from the 
TEN -02-[ADDRESS_631787] be scheduled after a short dialysis interval (only for HD patients; e.g., Wed nesday or Friday for patients o n a MWF 
schedule and Thursday or Sat urday for patients on a TTh S schedule ). 
Body weight and blood collections for laboratory assessments must  be 
performed pre -dialysis . All other assessments may be performed pre-, 
during, or post-dialysis but should be per formed at the same time at 
each visit. For patients receiving PD, visits should be performed on the same day each week, if possible.  
Tenapanor Arm  
The dosing regimens described below for sevelamer are for guidance to the Investigators. Investigators have flexibility to dose sevelamer, TID, 
BID or QD based on their experience with each patient or as per package insert. Dosing regimens can be adjusted based on the most recent sP laboratory data (central laboratory data or standard of care local laboratory data).  
 
If patients are in the tenapanor arm  (from the TEN -02-301 study), 
sevelam
er will be added  as described below:  
• sP >2.5 and ≤4.5 mg/dL: no addition of sevelamer.  
• sP >4.5 and ≤ 5.0 mg/dL: add one 800 mg tablet QD. 
• sP >5.0 and ≤ 5.5 mg/dL: add one 800 mg tablet BID.  
• sP >5.5 mg/dL: add one 800 mg tablet TID.

15 April 2019 CONFIDENTIAL Page 8 If sP is still greater th an or becomes >4.5 mg/dL at a subsequent visit, 
sevelamer dose can be increased in  a stepwise manner as described 
below: 
 sP >4.5 and ≤ 5.0 mg/dL: add one 800 mg tablet to the existing 
regimen. 
 sP >5.0 and ≤ 5.5 mg/dL: add two 800 mg tablets to the existing 
regimen. 
 sP >5.5 mg/dL: add three 800 mg tablets each day (800 mg TID) to the existing regimen. 
The maximum dose of sevelamer should be based on standard of care, the sevelamer package insert, and th e Investigator’s experience with 
each patient.  
If sP <2.5 mg/dL at any visit 
 Sevelamer dose can be lowered by [CONTACT_31806] 800 mg tablet TID, or as 
appropriate, based on current re gimen; Investigators have 
flexibility to dose sevelamer BID or QD based on their experience with each patient or as per package insert. 
 If patient is not taking sevela mer then tenapanor dose can be 
lowered by [CONTACT_31806] 10 mg tablet BID,  unless already at tenapanor 
10 mg BID, then can dos e tenapanor 10 mg QD 
Sevelamer Arm 
If patients are from the TEN-02-301 sevelamer arm, tenapanor dose will be added based on their baseline sP as described below. Investigators 
may decrease or increase the tenapanor dose based on sP levels and/or GI tolerability in [ADDRESS_631788] re cent sP laboratory data (central 
laboratory data or standard of care local laboratory data). 
 sP >2.5 and ≤ 3.5 mg/dL: add three 10 mg tablets of tenapanor QD 
and Sevelamer dose can be lowered by [CONTACT_31806] 800 mg tablet TID. 
 sP >3.5 and ≤ 4.5 mg/dL: add three 10 mg tablets of tenapanor QD
 sP >4.5: add three 10 mg tablets of tenapanor BID 
If sP >4.5 mg/dL at next visit  
 If on QD tenapanor, add three 10 mg tenapanor tablets to a 
maximum of 30 mg tenapanor BI D. If on 30 mg tenapanor BID 
follow sevelamer dose regimen changes described below 
 Sevelamer dose can be increased by [CONTACT_193536] [ADDRESS_631789] meal and up to one 800 mg tablet TID; Investigators 
have flexibility to dose sevelamer BID or QD based on their experience with each patient or as per packa
ge insert.

 Sevelamer dose can be lowered by [CONTACT_31806] 800 mg tablet TID; Investigators have flexibility  to dose sevelamer BID or QD 
based on their experience with each patient or as per package insert. 
 If patient is not taking sevela mer then tenapanor dose can be 
lowered by [CONTACT_31806] 10 mg tablet BID,  unless already at tenapanor 
10 mg BID, then can dos e tenapanor 10 mg QD 
For all subjects enrolled in TEN- 02-401, tenapanor will be taken either 
once (QD; just prior to di nner or largest meal of the day) or twice daily 
(BID; just prior to breakfast and dinner. Patients on HD should not take 
tenapanor at the meal immediately preceding dialysis; in this case, 
patients will take tenapanor prior to the previous or next meal after 
dialysis. Sevelamer will be taken as per package insert. 
Investigators may decrease or incr ease the tenapanor dose based on sP 
levels and/or GI tolerability in 10 mg increments to a minimum of 
10 mg BID or a maximum of 30 mg  BID not more than once daily. 
Laboratory assessments will be measured at every visit (Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 a nd 18) using a central laboratory.  
Safety assessments will be performed during the study and will include physical examinations, vital signs  (blood pressure and pulse), body 
weights, clinical laboratory eval uations, 12-lead electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), and adverse event (AE) monitoring.

2.1 Introduction 
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 5-10% of the population globally and the numbers of 
patients sufferin g from end- stage r
enal disease (ESRD) are increasing ( Eknoyan 2004 ). With 
progressing impairment of renal function, the ability of the kidneys to appropriately excrete 
phosphorus is reduced and hyperphosphatemia is a nearly universal complication of ESRD. 
Hyperphosphatemia is also part of the CKD Bone Mineral Disorder, which is associated with a 
disruption of normal serum and tissue concentrations of phosphorus and calcium, and changes in circulating levels of hormones such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D. Left untreated, hyperphosphatemia can lead to vascular and tissue calcifications, bone pain, fractures 
and worsening secondary hyperparathyroidism and is associated with increased cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality. Observational data show that treatment with phosphate binders to reduce hyperphosphatemia is independently associated with improved survival ( Waheed 2013), 
and a meta- analysis of randomized clinical trials demonstrate that non -calcium based binders 
have a lower mortality as compared to calcium -based binders. Experimental studies provide 
support for the epi[INVESTIGATOR_257618]: phosphorus excess promotes vascular calcification, induces endothelial dysfunction and may contribute to other emerging chronic kidney disease- specific mechanisms of cardiovascular toxicity ( Waheed 2013). Hence, clinical treatment 
guidelines for patients with advanced kidney disease suggest maintaining serum phosphorus within 3.5 to 5.5 mg/dL, which is close to the normal range ( KDIGO guideline 2009).  
In additi on to dietary phosphorus restrictions and dialysis, 80-90% of ESRD patients need 
treatment with oral phosphate  bi
nders. However, a significant proportion of ESRD patients still 
don’t achieve adequate phosphorus control ( DOPPS Annual Report 2010). An import ant barrier 
for a successful treatment is the pi[INVESTIGATOR_491309], which have to be dosed in several grams per day and taken with  each meal to bind dietary phosphorus. The side 
effect profile with poor gastro- intestinal tolera bility and concerns for long- term negative effects 
such as tissue calcification and potential metal accumulation toxicity from calcium-based and metal -based binders, respectively, further impair an effective phosphorus control in ESRD 
patients. There is , therefore, a rationale to develop oral phosphorus-lowering drugs with new 
mechanisms of action, a more convenient dosing and improved risk- benefit profile.  
Tenapanor is an oral, minimally absorbed compound that inhibits the NHE3 (sodium hydrogen exchanger) transporter local
ly in the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to reduced sodium (and 
fluid) absorption. Data from pre-clinical studies and results in healthy volunteers show that 
tenapanor also reduces the uptake of phosphorus from the gut.

absorption. Tenapanor modulates tight junctions to increase TEER, thereby [CONTACT_491315]; this effect is mediated exclusively via on -target NHE3 inhibition.   
Tenapanor has been administered to approximately 400 healthy subjects at single dos es up to 
900 mg, and in repeated doses up to 180 mg/day for 7 days, and to approximately 1350 IBS-C 
patients at doses up to 100 mg/day for up to one year  and to >900 CKD patients (CKD stages 3b, 
4 and 5D) for up to one year  at doses up to 120 mg/day.

Protocol N o.: TEN -02-401

tenapanor produced a stat istically significant decrease in serum phosphorus; these results suggest 
that tenapanor has the potential to provide phosphorus control comparable to existing phosphorus-lowering agents and improved dosing with reduced pi[INVESTIGATOR_13551], which merits further clinical development. 
A nonclinical study in Sprague- Dawley rats demonstrated tha
 t the administration of tenapanor in 
combination with sevelamer produced a synergistic effect on the excretion of phosphorus in the feces and therefore had a greater effect in i nhibhiting the absorption of dietary phosphorus than 
either drug alone. Based on this data and the inability of phosphate binders alone to get a 
majority of patients’ serum phosphorus below 4.6 mg/dL, this study is designed to investigate the 
long term potential of the combination of tenapanor and sevelamer to normalize ESRD  patient’s 
serum phosphorus levels. 
2.5 Risk -Benefit Assessment  
This ris
k-benefit assessment is based on the nonclinical toxicology, safety, and pharmacology 
studies as well as the 21 clinical tr
ials performed with tenapanor; the results from this research 
are described in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
Pre-clinical toxicological studies up to [ADDRESS_631798] been performed in rodents and dogs. The 
toxicological profile inc ludes sof
t stools and/or diarrh ea and findings secondary to dehydration; 
these findings are an expected manifestation of the compound’s  exaggerated pharmacologic 
activity and findings were re
versible during the recovery period without drug. A two -year 
carcinogenicity study in Sp rague -Dawley rats  was negative.  
The safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of tenapanor  have been evaluated in 347 
healthy s
ubjects at single doses up to 900 mg, and in repeated doses up to 180 mg/day for 7 days, 
and to 1020 IBS-C patients at doses up to 100 mg/day for up to 12 weeks and to 477 CKD 
patients (CKD stages 3b, 4 and 5D) for up to 12 weeks at doses up to 120 mg/day. 
Tenapanor has minimal systemic bioavailability. Less than  1% of plasma samples co llected 
during human studies (>3000) have quantifiable t enapanor present in blood serum (lower limit of 
quantification = 0.5 ng/mL); all samples with tenapanor were below 1.5 ng/mL. 
Ardelyx, Inc.  
Protocol N o.: TEN -02-401 
Edition No. : [ADDRESS_631799]. 
Based on thi s mechanism of action, tenapanor  has the potential to produce softer/looser stools 
and increased stool frequency. T enapanor  has been generally safe and well tolerated in clinical 
studies and the safety profile with softening/loosening of stool consistency and gastro- intestinal 
adverse events have been consistent with its  pharmacology.  
The theoretical adverse effects from tenapanor  treatment in ESRD patients w ould be due to 
exaggerated pharmacological effects and may include electrolyte disturbances, metabo lic 
acidosis, soft stools/diarrhea and reduced blood pressure. While a softening/loosening of the 
stool with an increased fluid loss via the intestine is an intended and desired effect of tenapanor  
in some patients, sensitive patient s should be monitored for signs of dehydration in case of 
prolonged severe diarrhea. This study protocol includes clinical  laboratory test s (including 
bicarbonate and electrolytes) and vital signs as well as specific discontinuation criteria related to phosphorus control to mitigate risks to study participants as well as to reduce the risk for severe 
hyper - or hypophosphatemia during the study and limit the period with risk for suboptimal 
phosphorus control. All patient s will re -start their pre -study treatment with phosphate binders 
when their participation in the study ends . ESRD -HD patients are dialyzed three times per week 
and their health status is checked at each visit as part of standard of care. See the Investigator ’s 
Brochure for details on non- clinical and clinical results with tenapanor. 
Patient s will be informed both verbally and in writing about these aspects before taking part in 
any study-specific ex
amination and the study will be conducted under conditions that ensure a 
high probability for the early detection of unt oward  events and for appropriate intervention. 
In summary, the risks to the p
articipants in this up to 18 month study are considered acceptable 
and the study results  will be import
ant for the development of a potential new drug, which could 
improve the treatment of hyper
phosphatemia in this patient group.

Edition No. : [ADDRESS_631816]. 
Patient s will be monitored throughout the study for AEs, from the enrollment visit through 
the end of treatment (Visit 13)
. All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_491318] : “Have you had any health problems 
since the previous visit?”, or revealed by [CONTACT_355655]. When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to 
recording a list of signs and symptoms. In instances of well-recognized symptoms, they can be recorded as the commonly used diagnosis (e.g., fever, runny nose, and cough can be recorded as “flu”). However, if a diagnosis is known, but there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom should be 
recorded separately.  
Adverse events that are identified at the la st assessment V isit 13 ( EOT ) as specified
  in the 
protocol must be recorded on the AE eCRF with the status of the AE noted, and the AE must be followed until AE is resolved or stable. All events that are ongoing at this time will be 
recorded as ongoing on t he eCRF. The procedures specified in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] are to be 
followed for reporting SAEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS] A
dverse Events Associate d with Change in Stool Form and/or Frequency  
Based on tenapanor’s ability to inhibit the absorption of dietary sodium, it is known to alter 
stool form and frequency in some p
atient s. For a change in stool form and/or frequency to be 
considered an adverse event the patient  must consider the bowel movements to be 
“bothersome.”  
[IP_ADDRESS] Recording Adverse Event s 
Advers
e events are to be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. Severity will be graded 
according to the following defi
nitions: 
Ardelyx, Inc.  
Protocol N o.: TEN -02-401 
Edition No. : 1 
 
15 April 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 • Mild: The patient  experiences awareness of symptoms but these are easily tolerated or 
managed without specific treatment  
• Moderat e: The patient  experiences disc omfort enough to cause interference with usual 
activity, and/or the condition requires specific treatment 
• Severe: The patient  is incapacitated with inabi lity to work or do usual activity, and/or the 
event requires significant  treatment measures.  
Action taken will be categorized as dose not changed, dose reduced, drug interrupted, drug 
withdrawn, required concomitant m
edication, required concomitant procedure and/or other. 
Event outcome at resolution or time of last follow -up will be recorded as not recove red/not 
resolved, recovered/resolved, recovered/resolved with sequelae, recovering/resolving, fatal or 
unknown. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Adverse Events  
T
he relationship of the event to the study drug should be determined by [CONTACT_491319]:  
• Not related: The event is most likely produced by [CONTACT_244130] ’s 
clinical condition, inte
rcurrent illness, or concomitant drugs, and does not follow a known 
response pattern to the study drug, or the temporal relationship of the event to study drug 
administration makes a causal relationship unlikely  
• Possibly related: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and is possibly du
e to drug administration an d cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_244130] ’s clinical condition, intercurrent illness, or 
concomitant drugs. 
• Related: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and/or follows a
 known response pattern to the study drug, and cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_244130] ’s clinical condition, intercurrent 
illness, or concomitant drugs. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Following Adverse Events 
All
 (both serious and non-serious) AEs must be followed until they are resolved or stabilized, 
or until all attempts to determ
ine resolution of the event are exhausted. The Investigator 
should use his/her discretion in ordering additional tests as necessary to monitor the 
resolution of such events.

15 April 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 [IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuatio n due to Adverse Events  
Any patient  who experiences an AE may be wit hdrawn at any time from the study at the 
discretion of the Investigator. Patient s withdrawn from the study due to an AE, whether 
serious or non-serious, must be followed by [CONTACT_12244] r until the clinical outcome of the 
AE is determined. The AE(s) should be noted on the appropriate CRFs and the patient ’s 
progress should be followed until the AE is resolved. A decision to discontinue a patient  due 
to an AE should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. If the AE may relate to overdose of 
study treatment, the IB should be consulted for details regarding any specific actions to be taken . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy  
Female patient s must be inst
ructed to discontinue te napanor and inform the study Investigator 
immediately if they become pregnant during the study.  
The Investigator must report any pregnancy to  within [ADDRESS_631817] 
exposure. Any congenital abnormalities in the offspring of a patient  who received study drug w
 ill be 
reported as an SAE. The outcome of any pregnancy and the presence or absence of any 
congenital abnormality will be recorded in the source documentation and reported to 
. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is an
y AE occurring from Enrollment through final study visit (V13), at any dose 
that results in any of the following
 outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threate ning adverse drug ex
perience  
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27588]

to investigators will be blinded. 
Follow-Up Reports 
The Investigator must continue to follow the patient  until the SAE has resolved or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment) or the 
patient  dies.  
Within [ADDRESS_631819] update the SAE 
form electronically in the EDC
 system for the study and submit any supporting 
documentation (e.g., patient  discharge summary or autopsy reports) to  
 via fax or e- mail. If it is not possible to access the EDC system, refer to the 
procedures outlined above for initial reporting of SAEs.

criteria.  
A protocol deviation is defined as any in tentional or unintentional change to, or 
noncompliance with, the approved protocol pro cedures or requirement s. Deviations may 
result from the action or inaction of the patien t, Investigator, or site staff. Examples of 
deviations include, but are not limited to: 
 Failure to adhere to study ex clusion and inclusion criteria 
 Failure to comply with disp ensing or dosing requirements 
 Missed or out-of-window visits 
 Failure to adhere to test requirements, in cluding vital si gns, laboratory tests, physical 
examinations, medical history; either test s not done, incorrect tests done, or not done 
within the time frame specified in the protocol 
 Procedural deviations such as incorrect st orage of study drug, failure to update the ICF 
when new risks become known, failure to ob tain Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
approvals for the protocol and ICF revisions 
A process for defining and handling protocol deviations will be established. Protocol 
deviations that effect the safety of a patient require immediate notif ication of the Medical

Safety analyses
 include summaries for adverse events, clinical  laboratory tests, vital signs , 
body weights, 12-lead ECGs, and physical examinations. These summaries will be provided 
for the Safety Analysis Set and each TEN -02-301 treatment arm (tenapanor or sevelamer).  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory A ctivities 
(MedDRA). Summary tabl
es and listings will be provided by [CONTACT_491323] -emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Actual values and change 
from baseline values for clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, body weights,  and ECGs will be 
descriptively summarized by [CONTACT_765]. The number and percentage of patients in each physical examination category will be presented by [CONTACT_765].  
10 ACCESS TO SOURCE DAT A/DOCUMENTS  
The Investigator will provide direct access to source data and docu ments for the Sponsor or 
its designee  conducting study -related monitoring and/or audits, IRB/ Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) review, and regulatory review. The purpose of an audit or inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents, to 
determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP (Good Clinical Practice), guidelines of 
the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and any applicable regulatory 
requirements.  The Investigator will contact [CONTACT_12559] a 
regulatory agency about an inspection at any clinical site .

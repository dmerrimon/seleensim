Individual  Meaning Centered  Psychotherapy  (IMCP),  based  on the principles of Viktor  Frankl's 
Logotherapy,  is designed  to help patients  with advanced  cancer  sustain  or enhance a sense  of 
meaning,  peace  and purpose as they approach  the end-of- life. Preliminary  findings  from  our pi[INVESTIGATOR_734302], and significantly  increases  spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315]-being  and a sense  of 
meaning  and purpose  in life in a sample of patients with advanced  cancer.  This study  is a larger  
randomized  controlled  trial which utilizes  a repeated  measures  design  to investigate  the efficacy  of 
Individual  Meaning -Centered  Psychotherapy  (IMCP),  compared to a standard  Individual  
Supportive  Psychotherapy  (ISP) and an Enhanced  Usual  Care (EUC)  arm on spi[INVESTIGATOR_734303]-being,  
psychological distress, and quality of life in a sample of 414 ambulatory patients (138 per arm) 
with advanced  cancer.  (See Figure  1 below) 
 
 
All patients  with solid  tumors  with advanced  disease  receiving  ambulatory care at MSKCC  and its 
affiliates are eligible  for participation. Recruitment  of patients  will take place  at MSKCC,  in 
ambulatory care areas  treating solid tumors (i.e., prostate,  breast,  lung,  colorectal, hepatobiliary,  
head and neck cancers,  and palliative  medicine)  or through  the mail using  letter  recruitment. 
Potential subjects  for the study  will be identified,  by [CONTACT_734383],  by [CONTACT_734384].  Potentially eligible patients will be administered the Distress  
Thermometer  (DT),  in order  to determine  whether  the patient  meets  the requisite threshold  for 
study  participation in person  or over the telephone.  Patients who indicate  a 4 or greater  on the DT 
will be offered  participation and randomized  to one of the two 7-session  interventions  (IMCP  or 
ISP) or to the EUC  control  condition.  The Individual  Meaning  Centered  Psychotherapy  (IMCP)  
intervention will focus  on enhancing  meaning  and purpose  in patients‘ lives.   The Individual  
Supportive  Psychotherapy  (ISP)  intervention  will focus  on helpi[INVESTIGATOR_734304]. In Enhanced  Usual  Care  patients  will be given  targeted  referrals  
based  on screening  and will receive  psychoeducational  materials.  All participants will complete 
assessment batteries consisting of self-report  questionnaires which  will be administered  at four time 
points: Baseline  (T1, week  1), mid-way through  the intervention  (Midpoint  (T2),  week  4-7), immediately

2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
Primary Aim:  
• To conduct  a randomized  controlled  trial comparing the efficacy  of Individual  Meaning - 
Centered  Psychotherapy  (IMCP),  a standardized  Individual  Supportive  Psychotherapy  
(ISP)  and Enhanced  Usual  Care  (EUC)  in improving  meaning  and spi[INVESTIGATOR_734303]-being  and 
overall  quality  of life and reducing  psychological distress (depression and anxiety, 
hopelessness  and desire  for hastened  death)  in a sample of patients with advanced cancer.  
 
Secondary  Aims:  
• To examine  clinical  and demographic  variables  that may correspond  to differential 
responses  to Individual  Meaning -Centered Psychotherapy  (e.g.,  potential  moderating  
influences  such as gender,  race/ethnicity, religiosity,  level  of pre- intervention  social  
support,  optimism, physical symptom  burden, p rognostic awareness,  and treatment dose).  
• To assess  the relative  impact  of Individual  Meaning -Centered Psychotherapy  on different  
aspects  of meaning  (e.g.,  purpose, coherence,  existential vacuum), as well as on different  
aspects  of spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315]-being (meaning  versus  faith),  
• To explore whether  an enhanced  sense  of meaning ―explains‖  (mediates) improved  
psychological well-being  (i.e., increased  quality  of life, decreased  psychological distress).  
 
3.0 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_270830]  l, Existe  ntia l, Lo go therap  y, a nd Mea ning-Based  Psyc ho therap  y in Canc  er Pop ula tio ns: 
A relatively  small  but growing  literature  is developi[INVESTIGATOR_734305].  These  include  interventions  that incorporate the spi[INVESTIGATOR_734306],  meditation,  
Buddhist  philosophy  and religious  belief  (e.g.,  Cole,  2005;  Lerner  et al., 1987);  those  that use 
existential approaches  based  on the works  of Yalom and others  (De Vries,  1997);  those  based  on 
concepts  of self-transcendence  (Coward,  1998;  Chin -A-Loy & Fernsler,  1998;  Hiatt,  1986);  and 
meaning -based  approaches  based  on Folkman‘s (1997)  approach  to ―meaning  making‖  (Lee et al., 
2006)  and Frankl‘s  Logotherapy  (Lazer,  1984;  Quirk,  1979;  Zuehlke & Watkins,  1975).  Self- 
transcendence  has been  shown,  primarily  in the nursing  literature,  to be associated with indicators  
of well-being  and mental health  in older adults,  breast  and prostate cancer  patients, and AIDS  
patients  (Coward,  1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1998;  Chin -A-Loy & Fernsler,  1998;  Reed,  1991a).  
However,  all of these  studies used group  not individual  intervention  formats.   The direct 
application of Frankl‘s original  logotherapy  to medically  ill populations has been  extremely  
limited  (until  our recent  adaptation of Frankl‘s  work  in the form  of Meaning -Centered  
Psychotherapy,  described below).  Lazer  (1984)  conducted  logotherapeutic  support  groups  for 
patients  with cardiac disease,  butno  systematic  assessment of the impact  of these  groups  was 
conducted.  Zuehlke  and Watkins  (1975)  adapted  individual  logotherapy  to patients with terminal  
cancer,  meeting  for 6 individual  45- minute  sessions over two weeks.  The logotherapy focused  on: 
1) enhancing  rapport  with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]; 2) eliciting  sources  (e.g.,  activities,  relationships) that 
provided  meaning in the patient‘s life; 3) focusing  on the impact  of illness;  4) dealing  with the fear 
of dying using the technique of ―dereflection‖; and finally 5) enhancing a sense of closure with

significant  others  in one‘s  life as death  approached.  Patients  who participated (N=6)  experienced a 
stronger  feeling  of purposefulness  and meaningfulness  than controls  (N=6),.

Few empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-supported psychotherapy  interventions  for spi[INVESTIGATOR_734307]. Efforts  to establish  the efficacy  of palliative  care interventions  are hindered  
by [CONTACT_734385] (Pessin  et al., 2008).  Palliative  care 
practitioners  have begun  to deal with the issue  of spi[INVESTIGATOR_734308] (Puchalski & Romer,  2000;  Rousseau, 2000),  but few have tested  their efficacy  
experimentally. Psychotherapeutic techniques particularly adapted to the dying, such as life 
narrative and life review (Viederman,  1983),  are found  to be clinically b eneficial. Recently,  
Chochinov  et al. (2002,  2005)  completed a multisite randomized  controlled  trial (RCT)  to evaluate  
an individual psychotherapy  for terminally  ill patients called  ―Dignity  Conserving  Psychotherapy,‖  
whose  central  component is the creation of a ―generativity  document. ‖ What  the work  of 
Rousseau,  Viederman,  and Chochinov,  as well as our work  on Meaning -Centered  Psychotherapy,  
suggest  is the importance and potential  utility  of novel  psychotherapeutic  interventions aimed  at 
improving  spi[INVESTIGATOR_734303]-being,  sense  of meaning  and diminishing  hopelessness,  demoralization, 
and despair. Psychosocial interventions designed  to relieve  existential and spi[INVESTIGATOR_734309]. It is essential  that such interventions  be tailored  to the needs  
of patients with advanced  illness,  who may have difficulty  participating in long-term or group  
psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Individual  Meaning Centered  Psychotherapy  (IMCP)  has the potential to address  
the unmet  need for one-on-one, flexible  interventions  critical  to advanced  cancer  populations. It 
represents  an important  opportunity  to provide an effective  intervention  for existential and spi[INVESTIGATOR_734310].  
 
Meaning -Ce ntered  Psyc ho therap  y for Ad va nced Ca ncer Pa tie nts 
The importance of spi[INVESTIGATOR_734303]-being  and meaning in particular in moderating  depression,  
hopelessness  and desire  for death  in terminally  ill cancer  and AIDS  patients demonstrated  by [CONTACT_734386].  We focused  new efforts  on developi[INVESTIGATOR_734311]-pharmacologic (psychotherapy)  
interventions that could  address  such  issues  as loss of meaning,  spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315]-being and 
hopelessness  in patients with advanced  cancer. This effort  led to an exploration and analysis of the 
work  of Viktor  Frankl  and his concepts  of logotherapy  or meaning-based psychotherapy  (Frankl, 
1955, 1959, 1969, 1975).  While  Frankl‘s  logotherapy was not specifically  designed  for the 
treatment  of cancer  patients  or those  with life threatening illness,  his concepts  of meaning  and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_734312], who often  seek 
help in dealing  with existential issues  (e.g. sustaining  meaning  and hope  and understanding  cancer  
and impending  death  in the context  of their lives).  Frankl‘s  main  contributions to human  
psychology have been  to raise awareness  of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_734313], and the 
central  importance of meaning (or the will to meaning)  as a motivating  force   in human  
psychology.  His basic  concepts  include:  1) Meaning of life - life has meaning  and never  ceases  to 
have meaning  even  up to the last moment  of life, and while  meaning  may change  in this context,  it 
never  ceases  to exist;  2) Will to meaning  - the desire  to find meaning in human  existence  is a 
primary instinct  and basic  motivation for human  behavior; 3) Freedom  of will - we have the 
freedom  to find meaning  in existence  and to choose  our attitude  towards  suffering;  4) The three  
main  sources  of meaning in life are derived  from  creativity  (work  and deeds), experience  (art, 
nature,  humor,  love, relationships,  roles) and attitude  (the attitude  one takes  towards  suffering and

existential problems); 5) Meaning  exists  in a historical context,  thus legacy (past,  present  and 
future)  is a critical element in sustaining  or enhancing  meaning.  
 
The innovative  intervention  we developed and call ―Meaning -Centered  Psychotherapy‖  is based   
on the concepts  described  above  and the principles of Frankl‘s logotherapy,  and is designed to help 
patients  with advanced cancer  sustain  or enhance  a sense  of meaning,  peace and purpose  in their 
lives even  as they approach  the end of life (Breitbart, 2002;  Breitbart  et al., 2004, 2009;  Greenstein  
& Breitbart,  2000).  We initially  conducted  an R21- funded  pi[INVESTIGATOR_734314] -week (1.5- hour 
weekly  sessions) Meaning -Centered  Group  Psychotherapy  (MCGP)  intervention,  based  on th e 
concepts  of meaning as  elucidated by [CONTACT_734387], which utilized  a highly  developed treatment 
manual  incorporating  a mixture of didactics,  discussion and experiential exercises that focus  on 
particular  themes related  to meaning  and advanced  cancer.  MCGP proved  to be a highly  effective  
intervention,  increasing  a sense  of meaning,  spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315]-being, and hope,  while decreasing end of 
life despair.  The positive  results  of this R21 (see Breitbart  et al., 2009)  resulted  in the funding  of  
an R01 study  (1R01CA128287)  conducting  a larger  randomized  controlled  efficacy  trial of 
Meaning -Centered  Group  Psychotherapy  (MCGP)  currently  beginning  its fourth year of funding.  It 
became  quite  clear  to us during  the course  of the MCGP  clinical  trials  that the group  format for 
psychotherapy interventions  in patients with advanced  cancer  posed  many  challenges  and 
limitations.  The rigid schedule  necessary  to conduct  outpatient  group  sessions  in this population  
resulted  in high rates of missed  sessions  and high levels of attrition. 
 
Theore  tica l Co nceptua  l Mode  l Unde  rlying Mea ning-Ce ntered  Psyc hothe  rap y 
The central  role played by [CONTACT_734388]-of-life despair  
has led us to develop  a meaning -centered  intervention based  on a theoretical  model  in which the 
enhancement  of meaning  results in improved  quality  of life and reduced  psychological distress,  
despair  and suffering at the end of life. Figure  [ADDRESS_1003495]  for improved  
psychosocial outcomes  (improved  quality  of life, reduced p sychological distress  and despair).  
 
Specifically,  meaning  is viewed  as both an intermediary outcome, as well as a mediator  of changes  
in these  important  psychosocial  outcomes. Religious  faith is not expected  to directly  impact  
psychosocial outcomes,  but may moderate the intermediary outcome of meaning  (see, for example, 
Nelson  et al., 2002,  indicating that religious  faith does not provide a unique  contribution to 
enhanced  psychosocial  outcomes after controlling  for spi[INVESTIGATOR_25824]).  This model also presumes  that 
other  factors  will impact  response  to a meaning -based  intervention,  including  prognostic  
awareness,  psychosocial  treatment preference,  and therapeutic  alliance.  We recognize  that the 
directionality  of many  of the variables  included  in this model  could  potentially be  bi-directional; 
however,  we are presenting  the model  we believe  underlies  the intervention.

Brady  et al. (1999)  found  that cancer patients who reported  a high degree  of meaning in their lives 
(as measured  by [CONTACT_258552] -Sp meaning/peace  sub-scale)  were able to tolerate  severe  physical  
symptoms  better  than patients  who reported  lower  scores  on meaning/peace.  Patients  with a high 
sense of meaning  reported  higher  satisfaction with their quality of life than patients  with a low 
sense of meaning,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_734315].  Our research  group  (Breitbart  et al., 2000;  Nelson et 
al., 2002)  has demonstrated  a central  role for spi[INVESTIGATOR_734303]-being  (i.e., meaning)  as a buffering  
agent,  protecting against  depression,  hopelessness  and desire for hastened  death  among terminally  
ill cancer  patients. McClain, Rosenfeld,  and Breitbart  (2003)  found  that spi[INVESTIGATOR_734303]-being, as 
measured  by [CONTACT_258552] -Sp, was significantly  associated  with end-of- life despair  (as defined  by 
[CONTACT_202594],  desire  for hastened  death  and suicidal ideation)  even  after controlling  for the 
influence of depression.  Moreover,  when  the FACIT -Sp was divided  into two components,  one 
measuring  a sense  of meaning  and peace  (the Meaning/Peace  subscale) and another  measuring  
spi[INVESTIGATOR_734316] (the Faith  subscale), the Meaning/Peace  subscale  was much  
more  strongly  associated  with end-of- life despair than was the Faith  subscale. We conducted  two 
NIH-funded  studies assessing  the impact  of pharmacologic treatment  for depression in terminally  
ill AIDS  and cancer  patients  on desire for hastened  death. While  the effective  pharmacologic 
treatment  of depression reduced  desire  for hastened  death  in depressed  patients, our findings  
(Breitbart  et al., 2000)  also showed  hopelessness  and loss of meaning  were  often independent  of 
depression  as predictors  of desire  for death  and are as influential  on desire  for death  as depression.  
Such  data suggest  the critical need for development of psychosocial  interventions  for the 
terminally  ill that address  loss of meaning  as a mechanism  for improving  psychosocial outcomes  
(e.g.,  quality  of life, depression,  anxiety,  hopelessness,  desire  for death  and end-of- life despair).

We recognized  that a brief and flexible  ind ivid ua l format  of Meaning -Centered  Psychotherapy  
could  have advantages  over a group  format  in a population  of patients  with advanced cancer.  We 
modified  our original  Meaning -Centered  Group  Psychotherapy  intervention and developed  an 
individual  format intervention,  (Appendices  H & I). The overall  goal of this proposed study  is to 
examine  the efficacy  of IMCP.

Individual  Meaning -Centered  Psychotherapy  is a flexible seven -session  (1 hour weekly  sessions)  
individual  intervention that utilizes  a mixture  of didactics, discussion and experiential  exercises 
that focus  around  particular themes  related  to meaning  and advanced  cancer.  The session themes 
include:  Session 1 – Concep  ts a nd So urces  o f Mea ning; Session 2 – Cance  r a nd Mea ning; Session 
3 – Historica  l So urc es o f Me a ning:  Le gac y (past,  prese  nt a nd future  ); Session 4 – Attitud  ina l

via Bea uty, Lo ve, a nd Humor;  and Session  7 – Tra nsitio  ns: Re flectio  n, a nd Hopes  fo r the F uture . 
Patients  are assigned  readings  and homework  that are specific  to each session‘s  theme  and which 
are utilized  in each session.  Of The IMCP  format  includes experiential  exercises, didactics and 
discussions  related  to themes  focusing  on meaning;  sources  of meaning,  and flexibility  in moving  
from  one source  of meaning to another  when  cancer  illness  or treatment  imposes  obstacles  and 
limitations.  The IMCP  Treatment  Manual  in Appendix  I & J describes the intervention in detail.  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] S tud y o f IMCP  
We conducted  a large  pi[INVESTIGATOR_734317] a sample of 104 advanced cancer  patients  comparing  
Individual  Meaning Centered  Psychotherapy  (IMCP)  vs. Therapeutic  Massage  (T-M). This pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480],  funded  by [CONTACT_734389]  (MSKCC  protocol  # 04-089),  established  
the feasibility,  practicality, applicability,  acceptance,  and effectiveness  of the IMCP  intervention,  
and demonstrated  powerful  treatment effects  for our individual  format intervention that were even  
greater  than those  we were  able to demonstrate in our group  intervention study  (Breitbart et al., 
under  review)  . 
 
Methods:  Patients with Stage  III or IV solid  tumor cancers  (N=120)  were randomly  assigned  to 
either  a 7-session IMCP  or 7 sessions  of Therapeutic  Massage  (TM). Patients  were assessed  before  
and after completing the intervention,  and again  2 months  after  completion. Outcome assessment  
included  measures  of spi[INVESTIGATOR_734303]-being,  meaning,  hopelessness,  anxiety, depression,  overall  
quality  of life, symptom  burden  and symptom - related  distress. 
 
Results:  Study  Completion: The flexibility of scheduling  resulted  in far less attrition and an ability  
to deliver  the full dose of 7 treatment sessions to over 90%  of the sample.  Attrition was evaluated  
first as the proportion of patients  who remained  in the group  throughout  the 7-week  intervention 
period  (i.e., were  available  to provide  post-intervention data),  and second,  by [CONTACT_734390].  There  was no difference  in the number  
of sessions  completed  by [CONTACT_734391],  and the proportion of participants 
who completed  all 7 weeks  was comparable  across  both conditions.  The IMCP  participants 
attended  an average  of 5.28 sessions  (s.d.= 2.6), whereas  TM participants comp  leted an average  of 
5.02 sessions  (s.d.=2.9),  t=0.53,  p = .60. Of the 59 individuals  who began  IMCP,  39 (66.1%)  
attended  all 7 scheduled sessions versus  33 (61.1%)  of 54 individuals  randomized to massage,  chi-

correlation for ordinal  data)  with overall  physical  functioning,  rs = .17, p =  .06. 
 
Impact  of Treatment on Spi[INVESTIGATOR_734318] - Being  and Psychological Adjustment:  Repeated  measures  
ANOVA  models  were used to evaluate  the differential impact  of treatment  on the measures  of 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315]-being  and psychological functioning.   In each of these  models,  treatment  arm was 
entered  as a categorical independent  variable,  along with baseline  score  on the outcome variable as 
a co-variate.  These  analyses  revealed  a significantly  greater  effect  of treatment for IMCP  
compared  to TM for overall  spi[INVESTIGATOR_734303]-being  (FACIT -Sp Total  score),  b = 0.39  (95%  CI: .18 - 
.59), t = 3.74, p =  .0004, as well as for the Meaning/Peace  and Faith  subscales, b = 0.36 (95%  CI:

.26 - .46), t = 3.48, p =  .0008 and b = 0.39  (95%  CI: 0.05 - 0.72),  t = 2.27, p =  .03, respectively.  
There  were also significantly  greater  benefits  for IMCP,  compared  to TM, in improving  overall  
quality  of life (MQOL), b = 0.70 (95%  CI: 0.17 - 1.24),  t = 2.58, p =  .02, decreasing the number  of 
physical  symptoms  endorsed  (MSAS -Sx), b = 4.66 (95%  CI: 1.53 - 7.79),  t = 2.92, p =  .005, and 
decreasing severity  of physical symptom distress  (MSAS -GDI),  b = 0.42 (95%  CI: 0.20 - 0.64),  t 
= 3.77, p =  .0003. There  were  no significant  differences  between  these  two interventions  in terms  
of reducing  anxiety  (HADS -A), b = 0.04 (95%  CI: -0.13 - 0.06),  t = -0.72,  p = .47, depression  
(HADS -D), b = 0.03  (95%  CI: -0.09 - 0.14),  t = 0.49, p =  .63, or  hopelessness  (BHS),  b = .13  
(95%  CI: -0.27 - 2.52),  t = 1.59, p =  .12. 
 
In order  to examine  the basis for the group  differences,  simple  change  scores  within  each treatment 
arm were  analyzed,  along with paired  t-tests to determine  whether  the change  on each measure  was 
significantly greater  than zero.  As evident  in Table  1, participants in the IMCP  arm demonstrated  
significant  reductions  in symptoms and improvement  in quality  of life/spi[INVESTIGATOR_734303]-being across  
most  of the study  variables.  Although  many  (but not all) of the effect  sizes  decreased  somewhat 
during  the follow -up period, most  of these  change  scores  remained significant.  However,  there  was 
a markedly  different  pattern  for participants receiving  TM, with very few significant  
improvements  (only  hopelessness  improved  significantly following  the TM intervention)  at either  
the end of treatment  at the 2-month follow -up. 
 
We followed  a similar  approach  for the analysis  of the long-term benefits  of treatment, using  
repeated  measures  ANOVA  models  to evaluate  the differential  impact  of treatment on spi[INVESTIGATOR_734319]-being and psychological functioning at the 2- month follow- up assessment. As with the post- 
treatment  analyses,  treatment  arm was entered  as a categorical independent  variable  and baseline  
score  on the outcome variable  was entered  as a co-variate.  These  analyses  revealed no significant  
differences  in treatment  efficacy  for IMCP  versus  TM at the 2- month follow - up assessment, 
although a similar  pattern  of improvement was evident in the within - group  analyses.

Approval date: [ADDRESS_1003497] been  studied  and utilized  
in cancer  populations  as well as other  populations  with life-threatening  medical illnesses  (e.g.,  
AIDS).   The unique  personal  struggles  that an individual  patie nt faces  when  copi[INVESTIGATOR_85509],  
especially  as they near the end of life, suggest  the importance of a one-on-one psychotherapeutic 
approach.  Individual  treatment allows  the patient to engage  in the therapeutic  work  on an intimate  
level  and explore  his/her distinct existential concerns.  However,  most  clinical  trials  investigating  
psychosocial interventions for cancer patients have tested interventions that use a group format 
(e.g.,  Classen  et al., 2001;  Edmonds et al., 1999;  Fawzy &  Fawzy, 1998)  and many  have focused  
on or have included  earlier -stage  cancer  patients  and survivors  (e.g.,  Dolbeault et al., 2009;  Lee et 
al., 2006).   While  there  may be clinical  and financial  utility in employing a group  modality,  the 
intensity  and focus  on each individual‘s  expe rience  may be diffused  within  this type of 
atmosphere.   Multiple stories are often  shared, and the individual  and his/her  personal  meaning  
may become  lost within  the group  dynamic.  In contrast,  a one-on-one psychotherapeutic  approach  
permits  at least two conditions that are of particular  importance  in working  with vulnerable  
advanced  cancer  populations:  flexibility and  individualization.  Being flexible  in scheduling  the 
location and time of the intervention is paramount when  working  with advanced  cancer  pat ients 
who may be in physical discomfort  and limited  in mobility  in order  to accommodate their needs.  
Group  psychotherapy  interventions  can be effective  for cancer  patients,  but have practical  
limitations  in advanced  cancer  patients, imposed  by [CONTACT_734392]  
a critical mass of participants is required  for ideal  outcomes. This results  in high rates of attrition 
and missed  sessions  (the full dose of the intervention  is often  not delivered).  Individualization 
through  tailoring  treatments  to address  each patient‘s  existential concerns  and to identify  personal  
sources  of meaning is similarly  crucial and may ultimately result  in more  potent  and lasting  
positive effects  than group  interventions  permit . 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This study  will utilize  a randomized,  controlled,  repeated  measures  design  to investigate  the 
efficacy  of Individual  Meaning -Centered  Psychotherapy  (IMCP),  compared to a standard  
Individual  Supportive  Psychotherapy  (ISP)  and an enhanced  usual  care (EUC)  arm, on spi[INVESTIGATOR_734319]-being,  psychological distress,  and quality  of life in a sample of 414 ambulatory patients  (138 
per arm)  with advanced cancer.  All patients  with solid  tumors with advanced  disease and 
significant  distress who are receiving  ambulatory care at MSKCC  are eligible  for participation. 
Recruitment  of patients  will take place at MSKCC,  in all ambulatory care areas  treating  solid  
tumors  (i.e., prostate, breast,  lung,  colorectal, hepatobiliary,  head and neck cancers,  and Palliative  
Medicine).  In addition, patients  may be recruited  through  letters.

Potential subjects  for the study  will be identified,  by [CONTACT_734383],  by [CONTACT_734393].   Specific  evidence  of 
advanced  disease  to meet  eligibility  criteria  includes  documentation of one of the following:  stage  
IV disease  for breast,  prostate, or  colon  cancers;  solid  tumor  malignancies  at other  sites that are 
metastatic;  locally  advanced  and unresectable  cancer/tumors;  locally  recurrent  ovarian  cancer, or  
confirmation  from  the treating  physician  and documentation in the research  medical record  of 
advanced  disease.   The Screening  Assessment  (T0) will be conducted  using  the following:  Patients 
will be assessed  using  the Karnofsky Performance  Rating  Scale  (KPRS).  Patients  with a score  
below  60 or  physical limitations  sufficient to preclude  participation will be excluded  from  the 
study.  Potentially eligible patients will be administered the Distress  Thermometer (DT), d eveloped 
by [CONTACT_734394]  (NCCN)  Distress  Management Clinical  Practice  
Guidelines  Panel  (2009). This screening  tool consists of a [ADDRESS_1003498]  of problem areas  that may be contributing  to distress  
(i.e., practical, family,  emotional, spi[INVESTIGATOR_37312]/religious,  and physical  problems), in order  to determine  
whether  the patient meets the requisite  threshold  for study  participation. Patients  who indicate  a 
four or greater  on the DT will be informed  of the nature  of the study,  the method,  relevant risks  
and benefits, and offered  participation. Demographic (age, race, education, SES,  etc) and Health  
Status (cancer  diagnosis, stage  of disease),  and pre-randomization  preference  (treatment  
preference)  will also be  collected  (see Appendix A).  Patients will then complete  the informed  
consent.  
Following  informed  consent,  patients  will be assigned  a subject  number  and randomized  to one of 
the two 7 session  interventions  (IMCP  vs ISP) or to the EUC  control  condition . Randomization  
will be completed by [CONTACT_30588]‘s Department of Biostatistics. After randomization, participants will 
be contact[CONTACT_734395].  The intervention  should  begin  within  four weeks  of randomization. Patients who 
cannot  begin  the intervention within  30 days of consent  (because  of conflict  or illness),  will be 
placed  on a waitlist so they can be offered  the intervention when  they do not have any conflicts  at 
which time patients  will be re-consented.  
 
After  the patient has been  randomized,  they will complete a T1-Baseline  Assessment  (week  1) 
before  the 1st session (see Appendix  C). The assessment battery  will be re-administered  at 3 
subsequent  points:  T2 (midpoint,  at session 4, Appendix  D); T3 (post - intervention,  following  the 
7th session  of the intervention  or at the completion of [ADDRESS_1003499], Appendix  
E) to assess  changes  over the course  of treatment; and T4 (follow - up, 8-[ADDRESS_1003500] completion 
of T3, Appendix  F) to assess  maintenance of treatment gains.   The EUC  sample will also be 
administered  the battery  of questionnaires at approximately equivalent  intervals.  Please  see 
Appendices A, C, D, E, & F and if it is overly  burdensome to come  to the counseling center  for 
assessments  patients will be given  the option to complete  them  by [CONTACT_2319], email the blank  
questionnaires  to participants for them  to print  and complete at home  (forms  will be returned  by 
[CONTACT_2319]),  or administer  the questionnaires over the phone.  Figure  3, section 9.0 for specific  measures)  
 
All intervention  sessions will be conducted  at Ambulatory Counseling  Center  facilities  of the 
MSKCC  Department  of Psychiatry  and Behavioral Sciences or another  Memorial Sloan -Kettering  
Cancer  Center  treatment  facility.  However,  in rare circumstances if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_461822]  (e.g.,  illness,  emergency,  transportation difficulties) telephone  sessions will be 
permitted.  All psychotherapy  sessions will be audio  recorded  to be used for treatment  integrity 
purposes.  Portions of these  audio  recordings  may be transcribed  for academic, educational,  or

training  purposes  with the participants consent.  This will happen  when  a portion  of a session  is 
particularly  compelling or  represents  a noteworthy  example of Meaning -Centered Psychotherapy  
in practice.  Transcription will be completed by [CONTACT_734396],  a transcription service  
company.  Sessions  may be observed  with the participants‘ knowledge by [CONTACT_734397]/or  study  
personnel  through  the two way mirror  in the MSK  Counseling  Center  for training, educational, 
supervision purposes  or for treatment  integrity.  Finally,  sessions may be video  recorded  with the 
participants consent  and may be used for academic, educational, or  training purposes.  
 
We will be assisted on this project  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Barry  Rosenfeld  from  the Fordham  University  
Department of Psychology.  [CONTACT_319135]  is a Professor  and Director  of Clinical  Training  at 
Fordham  with a faculty  appointment at MSKCC.  As Co-PI [CONTACT_138365] R01 grant  that was awarded  to 
support  operations of this study,  his primary  role is to provide consultation for research  design,  
research  supervision,  data analyses, and manuscript  preparation. There  is an established  
subcontract  between  MSKCC  and Fordham  University.  All data that [CONTACT_319135]  receives  will 
be de-identified.  
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
All eligible patients,  meeting  inclusion  and exclusion criteria, who provide  informed  consent  and 
voluntarily  agree  to participation in this psychotherapy  intervention  study  will be randomly  
assigned  to one of three  study  arms:  the two psychotherapy interventions  described below  or the 
enhanced  usual  care condition.  Individual  sessions of either  IMCP  or ISP will be held in the 
MSKCC  Department  of Psychiatry  and Behavioral Sciences ambulatory care facility:  The MSK  
Counseling  Center, MSKCC  54th Street.  In rare cases  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734322], Outpatient  Treatment Center, or  Inpatient Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_734323].   On rare occassions  at the discression of the P.I. and individual  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541],  participants who 
become severely  ill or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_734324].  
Participants will attend  individual  sessions  weekly for [ADDRESS_1003501] session. 
 
Ind ivid ua l Mea ning-Ce nte red Psyc ho therap  y (IMCP) : IMCP  is based  on the principles of Viktor  
Frankl‘s  Logotherapy,  and is designed to help patients  with advanced cancer  sustain  or enhance  a 
sense of meaning,  peace  and purpose  in their lives even  as they approach  the end of life. IMCP  is 
structured  as a 7-session (1- hour weekly sessions)  individual intervention that utilizes  a mixture  of 
didactics,  discussion  and experiential  exercises  that focus  around  particular themes  related  to 
meaning  and advanced cancer  (See Appendices  I & J for IMCP  Treatment  Manual  and IMCP  
Participant  Manual).  The session  themes  include:  
• Session 1 – Concepts  and Sources  of Meaning  
• Session 2 – Cancer  and Meaning:  Identity  Before  & After  Cancer  Diagnosis  
• Session 3 – Historical  Sources  of Meaning:  Legacy  (past,  present  and future)  
• Session 4 – Attitudinal  Sources  of Meaning:  Encountering  Life‘s  Limitation s 
• Session 5 – Creative  Sources  of Meaning:  Creativity  & Responsibility  
• Session 6 – Experiential  Sources  of Meaning:  Connecting  with Life via Beauty , Love  & Humor

• Session 7 – Transitions:  Reflection,  and Hopes  for the Future  
Patients  are assigned  readings  (i.e. Man‘s  Search  for Meaning by [CONTACT_734398])  and homework  
that are specific  to each session‘s theme  and which are utilized  in each  session.  Participants  may also 
complete  an optional Legacy  Project  outside  of the group  based  on these  themes  and discussion  (ie. 
autobiography,  artwork,  photo  album,  family  history,  etc). While  this intervention is primarily  
psychoeducational  with the focus  of each session  on issues  of meaning and  purpose  in life in the 
face of advanced  cancer/limited  prognosis, elements of support  and expression of emotion are 
inevitable,  but limited  by [CONTACT_734399],  didactics and discussions related  to 
themes  focusing  on meaning).  
Ind ivid ua l S upportive  Psyc ho therap  y (ISP):  The ISP intervention  (see Appendix  K for ISP 
Treatment Manual),  utilized  as the comparison treatment  condition  in this study,  is adapted  from  
the Supportive  Group  Psychotherapy  manualized  intervention developed by [CONTACT_734400]  (1997)  
and adapted by [CONTACT_6283]. K issane,  Breitbart  and colleagues  into the ISP manualized  intervention.   This 
intervention is a 7-session  individual  supportive psychotherapy  utilizing  an approach  to supportive  
psychotherapy  based  on models  described by [CONTACT_522903]  (1951,  1980)  and Bloch  (1996).  The essential  
components  of supportive psychotherapy  are integrated  into this manualized  intervention, 
including:  reassurance,  explanation,  guidance,  suggestion, encouragement,  affecting  changes  in 
patient‘s environment,  and permission  for catharsis (Bloch,  1996).  The ISP therapeutic process  
emphasizes  Rogerian person -centered concepts:  genuineness,  unconditional positive  regard,  and 
empathic  understanding.  The ISP therapeutic  content  emphasizes  maintaining  focus  on cancer,  
supporting  patients  in the here and now,  fostering  expression  of emotion  and discussion of difficult  
topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102],  and creating a  sense  of being  understood  (Payne,  et al., 1997).  The manual  also contains  
specific  instructions  on how to avoid  therapeutic  techniques that are not exclusively  supportive  
(e.g.,  interpersonal  therapy,  cognitive -behavioral  therapy,  meaning -centered  therapy).  
Enha  nced Usua  l Ca re (EUC) : The use of a usual  care condition to increase  the methodological 
rigor of this randomized  controlled  trial must  be balanced  with the need for beneficence  and 
preventing harm  in the care of patient participants. We are therefore  including  what  we refer to as 
an ―enhanced‖  usual  care arm to this randomized  controlled  trial to address  the ethical  issues  
raised  by [CONTACT_14662]  a usual  care condition  in a vulnerable  advanced  cancer  population. The 
―enhancement‖ to usual  care in this study involves  the inclusion  of screening  and targeted  referral  
components  as suggested  by [CONTACT_734401]. (2001).  Participants will receive  feedback  about  their 
level  of distress  (based  on the DT administered  at screening)  and given  appropriate targeted  
referrals  based  on levels of distress  and problem areas  endorsed.  Participants will be given  a letter  
with a list of appropriate  referrals.  Several  referrals  may be made  based  on identified  problem  
areas,  using  the following guidelines:  
• ―Practical  Problems ‖ - Social  Work  on their disease management team  
• ―Family  Problems‖- Family  Clinic  at MSKCC  Counseling  Center  
• ―Emotional Problems‖ - MSKCC  Counseling  Center  
• ―Spi[INVESTIGATOR_37312]/Religious  Concern‖ - Pastoral  Care  Counseling  Services 
• ―Physical  Problems‖- MSKCC  physician or MSKCC  Palliative  Care Service  
In addition, patients  may be offered  community resources  as well.  Research  assistants  conducting  
the screening  and providing  feedback  and referrals will be trained  in the NCCN  guidelines  for 
distress management (NCCN, 200 9; see Appendix G). Regardless of whether they indicate 
significant  distress or any problem  areas  patients in the EUC  will all be provided  with 
informational  brochures  on psychosocial  services available at MSKCC  (i.e., the MSKCC  
Counseling  Center  Services Guide  for Patients  [MSKCC, 2007],  psychoeducational  materials  (see

patients  will be closely monitored  at each assessment  point  for significant  distress  and highly  
distressed  patients (i.e. 8 or  above  on DT or endorsement of suicidal ideation on BDI)  will be 
referred  to the counseling  center  or contact[CONTACT_690035] [INVESTIGATOR_734325].  
Selectio  n, Tra ining  a nd S upervisio  n o f Leaders  : We have carefully  considered  the selection  of 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734326].  The manualized  
research  interventions  for this protocol, IMCP  and ISP, are highly  structured,  as therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734327].  Therefore,  we determined  that therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734328],  at minimum,  a Masters  degree  in Mental  Health  Counseling,  social  work,  or 
psychology  to qualify  for consideration as an interventionist  on this study.  Clinicians  with greater  
experience  and more  advanced skills  will also be considered for the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734329].  
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734330].  Supervision and training  for IMCP  and ISP will be conducted  by [CONTACT_941] P.I. or 
Co-Investigator  in charge  of each treatment arm. 
All research study counselors are either MSKCC-employed mental health clinicians or non- 
MSKCC  employed  mental  health  clinicians  contracted to work  on specific  research  studies. We 
use the services of non-MSKCC  mental  health  clinicians  as study  counselors so that we can best 
accommodate participant schedules and availability  to attend  the study  sessions.  
All study  interventionists will undergo  extensive  training  in either  IMCP  or ISP, by [CONTACT_941] P.I. or Co- 
Investigator.   Although  some  MSKCC  clinicians  are already  experienced  in providing IMCP  or 
ISP from  our pi[INVESTIGATOR_734331],  the P.I. and Co-Investigator  will lead periodic intensive training  
workshops  in the delivery  of these  interventions for each  distinct intervention therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].  All 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734332] a copy  of the treatment  manual  for the intervention they will be 
providing,  describing in detail  the philosophy, format,  and techniques  involved  in the intervention.  
These  training  workshops  will focus  on the acquisition of skills  in the conduct  of each 
intervention.  We will also provide ―booster‖  training  to maintain  standardized  delivery  of both 
treatment  conditions  to prevent  ―provider  drift.‖  To reinforce  standardized treatment  delivery,  the 
P.I. or Co-Investigator  in charge of the treatment  arm will lead supervision sessions for the 
different treatment providers. 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734333].   If needed  some  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734334]  1-[ADDRESS_1003502] ‘s competency  in the intervention  will be assessed  to 
determine  if they are ready  to be study  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. Participants who are consented  as training  cases  
will not be randomized  and will not complete any assessments.  Data collected on training  cases  
will be used for training and supervision purposes  on this study  only.  These  records  will not be 
shown  outside  of the study  supervisors, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734335],  and staff.  Training  will be 
approximately  7-14 weeks  to allow  for trainees  to complete  the 7 sessions of the intervention. The 
audio -recordings  from  the training  cases  will be kept for the duration  of the study  to train future  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734336]. Training  participants will be offered  
reimbursement  for travel  expenses . 
 
Ad here nce to Interve  ntio n Format : We will institute  several  ―best practices‖ to enhance  and 
monitor  treatment  fidelity,  which include:  careful  attention  to the study  design, selection,  intensive  
training  and supervision of treatment  providers, delivery  of treatment,  receipt of treatment, a nd 
―real- life‖ enactment of treatment  skills.  With  regard  to study  design,  we will compare two

intervention conditions  (IMCP  and ISP) that are equivalent  with regard  to the number,  frequency  
and duration of sessions.  We will monitor  session attendance  using a diary log with names  and 
session dates  to track  percentage  of attendance  and to account  for absenteeism and reasons  for 
missed  sessions.  We will make  every  effort  to deliver  the full treatment,  but we expect  some  
variation in treatment delivery  dose as well as treatment  drop-out. Reasons  for attrition will be 
assessed  with an open -ended  question  for enrolled  participants who withdraw.  Drop -out reasons  
will be categorized  and then judged  by [CONTACT_734403].  To reduce  likelihood  of treatment  
contamination,  each of the treatment  conditions  (IMCP  and ISP) will be delivered by [CONTACT_734404]. We have developed comprehensive  treatment  manuals  for IMCP  and ISP (see 
Appendices I, J & K) to facilitate standardized  delivery  of the treatment sessions.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734337].  We will also collect  
information  about  EUC  utilization of resource  referrals.  Deviations  from  protocol  will be recorded,  
and discussed  regularly during  supervision. We will also externally  monitor  treatment sessions,  
feedback  sessions for the EUC  arm, and provide feedback  to interventionists.  
Trea tme nt Inte grity/Ad  here nce to Interve  ntio n Fo rma t: We will establish  several  procedures  to 
monitor  treatment  protocol  adherence and improve standardized  delivery  of the treatment.  First,  
we have developed standardized  treatment  manuals  for each of the treatment conditions  (IMCGP  
and ISP).  To ensure  that providers  are adhering  to the treatment protocol, we have developed  a 
provider  outline  of intervention components  for each treatment  session, for both of the 
interventions that are included  in each treatment  manual.  These  checklists/outlines  can be used to 
facilitate  supervision. We have also developed  ―Treatment Integrity  Coding  Manuals ‖ (see 
Appendix L), adapted  from  Dr. K issane‘s experience in developi[INVESTIGATOR_734338]  (Chan et  al. 2004),  for each of the two 
interventions (IMCP,  ISP).  These  ―Treatment Integrity  Manuals ‖ allow  for independent raters  to 
evaluate  each  session  of both interventions  for treatment  adherence  in terms  of process  and  
content.  The MSKCC  Department of Psychiatry  and Behavioral Sciences will have available  two 
psychotherapy  conference  and consult  rooms  with 2-way mirrors,  audiotape recording  capabilities  
which will enhance our ability  to provide  supervision, training and treatment  integrity.  All sessions 
will be audio -taped, with prior  consent  of the participants. A random  sample of about  15%  of all 
recorded  sessions (approximately  1 session  per IMCP/ISP  case)  will be evaluated  and rated  for 
treatment  integrity  (utilizing  the Treatment Integrity  Coding  Manual).  To prevent  against  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734339],  treatment  integrity ratings  will be conducted  regularly  throughout  the period of therapy  
within  the study.  All raters  will be given  the opportunity  to offer  written  comments/feedback  to 
individual  facilitators  regarding  the specific  individual  session to enhance continued  training  and 
supervision in these  individual  interventions. Raters  will be blinded  to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734340], and required  to achieve >80%  
inter-rater reliability.  We will also use a patient -generated  measure  of treatment adherence,  the 
―Post-intervention Questionnaire‖, described in the Study  Measures  section.

Scree  ning fo r Re cruitme  nt : Potential  candidates  for the study  who meet  the eligibility  criteria of 
cancer  diagnosis and stage  will be identified  by [CONTACT_734405]/or  participating oncology 
staff or co- investigators.  Study  investigators  in the Pain & Palliative  Care Service  the Breast  
Cancer Medicine Service, the Head & Neck Oncology Service, the Thoracic Medicine Service, the 
Gastrointestinal  Oncology Service, and the Genito -Urinary  Oncology Service  will serve  as liaisons  
to the Research  Staff  and help screen  and identify  potential  subjects  for the study.  In addition  for 
these  services the study  research  staff may screen  the medical  records  of patients  with whom  they 
do not have a treatment  relationship  for the limited  purpose  of identifying  patients  who would  be 
eligible to enroll  in the study  and to record  appropriate contact  [CONTACT_734406].  They  may also make  inquiries  using  database  programs  (i.e. Dataline)  to identify  
appropriate patients  for review of study  eligibility  criteria.  
 
Recruitme  nt Strate  gies : In order  to maximize  study  enrollment  several  recruitment strategies  will 
be utilized  in this study.  We will defer  to our co- investigator‘  preferences  as to which method(s)  
they would  like us to use in their respective clinic.  These  include:  
 
1) Potentially  eligible  patient  who have an upcoming  appointment  at an MSKCC  outpatient  clinic  
may be contact[CONTACT_734407].  The research  staff will discuss  the study  
in detail, administer  the screening  instruments  and seek informed  consent  for participation. The 
screening  process  for this protocol  requires  administration  of screening  questionnaires ( Distress  
Thermometer,  Mini  Mental,  Karnofsky).  The Code  of Federal  Regulations  Title 45, Part 46, 
Subpart  A states  that an IRB may waive  the requirement for an investigator  to obtain  a signed  
consent  form for some  or all subjects  if it finds  that the research  presents  no more  than minimal  
risk of harm  to subjects  and involves  no procedures  for which  written consent  is normally  required  
outside  of the research  context.  In following the code,  we request  to waive  consent,  in accordance  
with these  regulations,  for the pre-screening  measures,  as they are conducted  for screening  in 
purposes  only.  
 
2) Patients  may also be contact[CONTACT_734408]‘s assent . Patients  who have 
been sent a recruitment letter  (see Appendix  O) and study  brochure  (see appendix P)  will be 
contact[CONTACT_734409].   Three  attempts will be made  to contact  [CONTACT_734410].  Patients who do not respond to the letter  will be 
considered  ‗not interested‖  in the study  and will not be contact[CONTACT_734411].  If the patient  is 
interested  the research  staff will discuss  the study  in detail, administer  the screening  instruments,  
and seek informed  consent  for participation on the phone.  
3) Flyers  or study  brochures  (see Appendices  M, P, &  Q) with study  contact  [CONTACT_734412] (i.e. prostate, breast,  lung,  colorectal, 
hepatobiliary,  head and neck cancers,  Palliative  Medicine, and the Counseling  Center)  .  Patients  
can call in to receive  information or be screened  for study  eligibility  over the phone.  If patients  
request  additional  information  about  the study  (i.e. study  brochures  or informed  consents)  these  
materials  will be sent to them  by [CONTACT_65056].  
 
If a patient  is medically  eligible, they will be contact[CONTACT_734413],  
assess  patient interest.  If patients  are interested,  the study  will be explained to them  in detail  and 
they will be asked  to complete  the Screening  Assessment  including  the Distress  Thermometer.  If 
eligible,  the patient  will then complete the consent.  Once  an informed  consent  (either  verbal  
consent  over the phone  or written  consent  in-person)  is obtained  patients will be assigned  a subject  
number  and informed  that they will be contact[CONTACT_734414]: 11 -021 A(15)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1003505] been  randomized  to IMCP  or ISP, the start date for the 
intervention will also be  discussed. Every  effort  will be made  to schedule  intervention  sessions so 
that they will not interfere  with participants‘ cancer  treatment plans. For patients  who express  
interest  in participating in the study  but require  financial  assistance for transportation  to/from  
individual  sessions,  a $20.00 travel  reimbursement  per session  (or assessment  for EUC  arm) will 
be offered  (see Appendix  N). 
Patients  who do not meet  all of the study eligibility  criteria  and are thus ineligible  may be offered  a 
chance  to take part in the study  as a training  case.  Additionally,  patients  enrolled  in the main  study  
and assigned  to the EUC  arm may be offered  the opportunity  to participate as a training case for 
one of the other  arms  (i.e., meaning or support)  once they have completed  all study  requirements 
and follow -up assessments. These  individuals,  if they are interested,  will be consented  as training  
cases  and will receive  7 sessions of Meaning Centered  or Supportive  Counseling  by [CONTACT_734415][INVESTIGATOR_734341]  (section 4.2). 
Ma inta ining  o f Rec ruitme  nt Re cords  : Research  staff will use the information  provided by [CONTACT_4677],  medical provider and/or  medical record  to confirm  that the patient  is eligible.  If the pat ient 
is ineligible  for the research  study,  the research  staff will destroy  all infor mation  collected  during  
the initial  conversation  and medical records  review,  except  for any information  that must  be 
maintained  for screening  log purposes  for the duration of recruitment  to make  sure patients are no 
re-approached.  At the completion of the study, all screening  information  will be de- identified.  
 
Limited  Wa ive r: The screening  and recruitment  process  outlined  above presents  no more  than 
minimal  risk to the privacy  of the patients who are screened  and minimal  PHI will be maintained  
as part of a screening  log.  For these  reasons,  we have a (partial) limited  waiver  of authorization  
for the purposes  of (1) reviewing medical records  to identify  potential  research  subjects  and obtain  
information  relevant  to the enrollment  process;  (2) conversing  with patients regarding  possible 
enrollment;  (3) handling  of PHI contained  within those  records  and provided by [CONTACT_83699];  and (4) maintaining  information  in a screening  log of patients  approached  (if applicable).  
 
7.1 ASSESSMENT/EVALUATION PLAN  
 
Following  completion of the screening  assessment  (T0),  participants will be randomized  to one of 
the 3 study  arms (IMCP,  ISP, or EUC)  and informed  of the intervention  they have been  assigned  to 
receive.   The assessment  battery  described  above  will be re-administered  at four subsequent  points  
(See Figure  3): T1 (baseline, before  the intervention,  week  1, Appendix  C), T2 (midpoint,  at 
session 4, Appendix D); T3 (post-intervention, following the 7th session of the intervention or at 
the completion of [ADDRESS_1003506], Appendix E) to assess  changes  over the course  
of treatment; and T4 (follow - up, 8-[ADDRESS_1003507] completion of T3, Appendix  F) to assess  
maintenance of treatment gains.  Patients in the EUC  arm will be re-administered the assessment  
battery  at comparable  time points.  In addition to the T0, T1, T3, and T4 questionnaires, we will be 
asking  patients  in the IMCP  arm to complete an optional  weekly  session  rating  survey  ( Appendix  
R). Patients  who complete all 5 assessments  will be eligible to receive  a $[ADDRESS_1003508] as a thank  you for study  completion.  This will be delivered  to the patient in person, by     
[CONTACT_65056],  depending  on participant preference.

Approval date: [ADDRESS_1003509]  his or her doctor  
during  consent, the MSKCC  oncologists  for a subset  of participants will be contact[CONTACT_734416] a prognostic awareness  questionnaire. This e- mail,  sent by [CONTACT_458]  [INVESTIGATOR_734342]  (T1), will contain  a link to a 
survey  introductory  page that provides  informed  consent  information.  Potential  participants will 
review  study  information  and the risks and benefits  associated  with participation. Physicians who 
select  the "next  page"  button  will be informed  that they are providing consent  and will be taken  to 
a webpage to fill out an 8-item questionnaire  (see Appendix  S for email, consent  text, and 
questionnaire  items).  Contact[CONTACT_734417] a study ID number  to connect  
the data they provide  with the participant, and their responses  will be otherwise  de- identified.  If  
the questionnaire  is not completed after two weeks,  a reminder  email  will be sent to the physician.  
If they do not complete  the survey  at that point, physicians will not be contact[CONTACT_734418].  The online  
questionnaire  should  only take about  [ADDRESS_1003510] access  to their responses.  
 
The data collected  from  this Physician Prognostic Awareness  Questionnaire  will be managed  
through  REDCap  (Research  Electronic  Data Capture),  a data management  software  system  
supported  by [CONTACT_734419]  (CTSC)  
at Weill  Cornell  Medical  College.  The CTSC  is funded  by a CTSA  NIH grant,  which  is led by 
[CONTACT_734420].  As a result  of the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]‘s inclusion  on this grant,  
we are able to use the CTSC ‘s resources,  including  REDCap, even  for projects  on which they have 
no role. For  this project, we are only using  REDCap;  we are not collaborating  with anyone  at the 
CTSC.  Members  of the Core  Informatics  Group  supporting the REDCap  software  will only have

customized,  secure  data management  systems  including  web-based  data entry forms,  reporting  
tools,  and a full array  of security features  including  user and group  based  privileges  with a full 
audit  trail of data manipulation and export  procedures.  REDCap  is maintained  on CTSC -owned  
servers  that are kept in a locked  server  room  with appropriate environmental modifications  (e.g.,  
special air conditioning), supported  by [CONTACT_279137],  and backed  up nightly  with 
some  backup  tapes  stored  off-site. All connections  to REDCap utilize  encrypted  (SSL -based)  
connections.  Nationally, the REDCap software  is developed, enhanced,  and supported  through  a 
multi - institutional consortium  led by [CONTACT_279138].  Use of REDCap  has been  
approved  by [CONTACT_734422]  & Behavioral Sciences ‘ manager  of IT Systems.  
 
Subje  ct Burde  n 
In an effort  to minimize  patient  burden,  the assessment  protocol  has been  designed  to be as brief  as 
possible  in order  to gather  the required  information.   The assessment  battery  takes  approximately  
one hour to complete, depending  on the individual  patient.  Research  staff will interrupt  an 
assessment  if a patient is fatigued  or in significant  pain.   In an effort  to ease patient burden,  all self- 
report measures will be read to the patient if necessary. 
 
Tests  a nd Mea sures  
Study  participants will be assessed  at baseline,  midpoint,  and follow -up assessments,  using  the 
following  study  measures  (see Appendices A, C, D, E, & F for assessment questionnaires).   The 
measures  chosen  have all been  widely used with medically  ill patients and have been  used to study  
patients  with cancer. In selecting these  measures,  an effort  was made  to limit subject  burden.  
Assessments  will be completed in person  or if the patient is not able to complete the follow -up 
questionnaires  in person, the research  study  team  reserves  the right  to be able to mail or complete 
the questioners  over the phone  with the participant. 
Screening  for Eligibility  Criteria:  
1. Sociodemographic Questionnaire: Sociodemographic information  will be obtained  at 
the pre-randomization  time point  consisting  of questions  concerning  age, gender,  
ethnicity, education, employment history, marital status and household composition, 
and religious  affiliation and practices.  Significant  medical and other  life events  which  
occur  during  the course  of treatment  and follow - up will be recorded  for each  patient.  (5 
minutes;  T0) 
2. Distress  Thermometer (DT):  The Distress  Thermometer (Roth  et al., 1998)  is a single - 
item visual  analog scale  used to screen  cancer  patients  for the presence  of 
psychological distress  with a 0-10 range.  The National  Cancer  Center  Network  
(NCCN)  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines for Distress  Management recommend  use of the 
DT, along  with a 34- item problem checklist  (NCCN,  2003, 2009).  An extensive  
research  literature  has documented the utility  of the DT as a screening  tool for oncology  
settings,  and has identified  a cut-off of 4 or greater  for identifying  clinically  significant  
psychological distress  (e.g.,  Grassi  et al., 2009;  Jacobsen  et al., 2005).  (2 minutes;  T0, 
T2, T3) 
3. Karnofsky  Performance  Rating  Scale  (KPRS):  Observer -rated  scale  used by [CONTACT_734423]'s  level  of physical  performance  with a range of 0-100. (Karnofsky  & 
Buchenal,  1949;  Coscarelli -Schag,  1984).  KPRS  is rated  upon  admission screening  and 
at each assessment.   (1 minute;  T0, T3, T4)

Health  Status  Measures:  
1. Health  Status  Interview  (HS):  Extent  of disease,  degree  of medical co- morbidity,  
concomitant  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  and significant  medical events  occurring  during  the study  will 
be recorded  for each patient. (5 minutes;  T1) 
2. Memorial Symptom Assessment  Scale  - Short  Form  (MSAS):  The MSAS  is a symptom 
checklist  that elicits  information  about  the intensity,  frequency,  and distress  associated 
with 32 physical and psychological symptoms  (Portenoy  et al., 1994).  Patients rate their 
symptoms  during the previous week.  The MSAS,  which  has been  validated  fo r use in 
cancer  and AIDS  patients (Breitbart  et al., 1996),  generates  a global  symptom  distress  
index  and two sub-scales that characterize  physical  symptom  distress and psychological 
symptom  distress respectively.  We utilize  an abbreviated version of the MSAS  which  
assesses  a single  domain (usually  distress)  for each symptom,  and provides calculations 
for sub-scales  that are identical to those  obtained  for the original  measure  (range  0-4). 
This abbreviated  version of the MSAS  has also been  demonstrated  to have adequate  
levels of internal  consistency (coefficient  alpha  =.83 for the Physical  Symptom  Distress  
subscale).  (5 minutes;  T1, T3, T4) 
3.   Prognostic  Awareness  (PA):  PA will be assessed  by [CONTACT_734424] (Chochinov  et al., 2000;  Lichtenthal et al., 
2009;  Prigerson,  1992;  Ray et al., 2006).  Prigerson  (1992)  created  a single - item 
assessment  of prognostic awareness  which  we have adapted  by [CONTACT_734425]: ― How  would  you describe your current  disease  status?‖  with response  
options: ―curable ‖, ―likely  curable‖,  ―unlikely  curable‖, or ―incurable‖.  Chochinov  et 
al. (2000)  used semistructured  interviews  to assess  patients‘ understanding  of their 
illness,  with interviewers  ranking responses  a mong  three  categories:  1 = No Awareness,  
2 = Partial  Awareness,  and 3 = Complete Awareness  (range  0-3).  Finally,  Temel  et al. 
(in progress)  are currently  developi[INVESTIGATOR_734343],  a 13- item measure  that assesses  the following:  perceptions of likelihood  
of cure,  importance and helpfulness  of knowing  about  prognosis,  primary  goal of 
cancer  care, preferences for information  about  treatment,  and satisfaction with quality  
of information  provided regarding  prognosis and treatment.  We have adapted  these  
measure  and are utilizing  a combined assessment of these  three  approaches  which will 
be completed  in two parts  (Part 1- as self report  questions  during the assessment  and a 
clinician rated assessment by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_541]. (5 minutes; T1, T3) 
4. Physician Prognostic  Awareness  Questionnaire (8 items;  See Appx  S): When  feasible,  a 
subset  of participants‘ oncologists  (approximately  50) will be asked  to complete a brief,  
face valid  questionnaire,  developed  in collaboration  with Fordham  University.  The 
questionnaire c onsists of 8 items  assessing physicians‘  perceptions of the discussion  
about  prognosis  with their patients,  including  the patient‘s  understanding  of their 
prognosis  and any potential barriers  to their understanding.  (5 minutes;  T1) 
5. Health  Status  and Outcome  (Appendix  T): HIS charts  will be reviewed  at the end of 
study  or after death  notification for the following information:  DNR,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_734344],  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51347].  (Chart  Review;  T4 and post-death)  
Measures  of Meaning:  
1.   Life Attitude  Profile-Revised (LAP -R): The LAP-R is a 48- item self-report  
multidimensional measure  of discovered  meaning  and purpose  in life and the 
motivation to find meaning  and purpose  in life based  on Frankl‘s  work  (Reker, 1992).  
Items  are rated  on a 7-point  Likert -type scale  of agreement.  The LAP -R evaluates  6 
dimensions:  purpose, coherence,  life control, death  acceptance,  existential vacuum,  and

goal seeking,  which  are used to calculate two composite subscales:  the Personal  
Meaning  Index  (having life goals  and a sense  of direction) and Existential 
Transcendence (degree  to which  meaning  and purpose  has been  discovered)  (range  8- 
56). The LAP -R has high internal  consistency (Cronbach‘s  alpha  coefficients  ranging  
from  0.77 to 0.91;  Reker,  1992).  (5 minutes;  T1, T2, T3, T4) 
2.   Unfinished  Business  Questionnaire (UBQ):  This 3- item measure  asks participants to 
identify  any matters  in their lives (e.g.,  relationships,  work)  perceived  as unfinished  or 
unresolved  (range  0-10). Participants who endorse  ―unfinished  business ‖ are asked  to 
provide a troubling example and to rate their distress  related  to this example. (under  5 
minutes;  T1, T3, T4) 
 
Measures  of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_734320]-Being:  
1.   FACIT  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_734320] - Being  Scale  (FACIT -Sp): The FACIT  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_734320] - Being  
Scale  is a brief self-report  measure  designed to assess  the nature  and extent  of 
individual‘s  spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315]-being (Brady  et al., 1999, Peterman,  Fitchett  & Cella, 1996).  
This measure,  which  generates  two sub-scales: Faith  (the importance of 
faith/spi[INVESTIGATOR_25824])  and Meaning  /Peace  (sense  of meaning  and purpose  in life) (range  0- 
4), has been  demonstrated to have strong  internal  reliability  for both the total score  and 
each subscale  (coefficient  alpha  = .87  for the total scale,  .88 for the faith factor  and .81 
for the meaning factor).  In addition, strong  support  for the external  validity  of this 
measure  has been  demonstrated in a several  large  samples of cancer  and AIDS  patients 
including  patients  with advanced  and terminal  illness  (Brady  et al., 1999,  Breitbart  et 
al., 2001;  Nelson et al., 2002).  (5 minutes;  T1, T2, T3, T4) 
 
Measures  of Religiosity:  
1.   Intrinsic/Extrinsic Religiosity  Scale  (IE-12): The Age Universal  I-E Scale  is a 12 item 
self-report  measure  that assesses  intrinsic  and extrinsic religiosity  (Maltby, 1999).  Each  
item is anchored on a three  point  scale  (range  0-2). Items  on the intrinsic  scale  include  
―My whole  approach  to life is based  on my religion,‖  and ―It is important  to me to 
spend  time in private  thought  and prayer‖.  Extrinsic  religiosity items  include  ―I go to 
church  because  it helps  me to make  friends,‖  and ―Prayer  is for peace  and happi[INVESTIGATOR_008],‖  
(Allport  & Ross,  1967).  The measure  has adequate  internal  consistency  reliability  
(alpha  range  = .66 to .75) and has been  increasingly  used with elderly and medically  ill 
popu lations (e.g.,  Nelson, 2002).  (under  5 minutes;  T1) 
 
Measures  of Psychological  Distress  and Quality  of Life:  
1. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174239]  (HADS):  Tis is a 14 item self-rated  
questionnaire,  which has been  well tested  as a measure  of overall  psychological distress  
in cancer  populations (range  0-42)., with Depression  and Anxiety Subscales  of seven  
items  each (range  0-21).. It is considered  particularly useful  because  of the absence of 
somatic  items  that often  confound the determination of psychiatric  problems among the 
medically  ill. Strong  test-retest  reliability  has been  found  in samples of elderly patients 
(Spi[INVESTIGATOR_734345]., 1997)  and HIV positive  patients  (Savard  et al., 1998).(under  5 
minutes;  T1, T2, T3, T4) 
2. Schedule of Attitudes  towards  Hastened  Death (SAHD):  This 20- item questionnaire 
(range  0-20) was developed by [CONTACT_734426] a self- report  measure  of 
interest  in hastened  death  (Rosenfeld,  Breitbart,  et al., 1999;  2000).  This measure  has 
been administered  to more  than 300 patients  with terminal  cancer  and HIV/AIDS,  and 
has demonstrated  high levels of reliability  (alpha  coefficient=.88  and median item-total

correlation=.43).  In addition, the SAHD  has demonstrated  concurrent  validity,  
correlating 0.88 with the clinician-rated Desire for Death Rating  Scale  (Chochinov  et 
al., 1995),  and somewhat  more  modestly  (r=.47 to 0.65)  with measures  of depression  
and overall  psychological distress.  This range  of scores  and pattern  of correlations with 
measure  of depression is consistent  with previous research  (e.g.,  Chochinov  et al., 
1995;  Breitbart  et al., 2001).  (under  5 minutes;  T1, T2, T3, T4) 
3. Hopelessness  Assessment in Illness  (HAI):  The Hopelessness  Assessment  in Illness  
scale  (HAI)  is a brief,  8- item questionnaire specifically  developed through a  R01- 
funded  research  study  (B. Rosenfeld,  P.I.; W. Breitbart,  Co-P.I.) to assess  hopelessness  
in cancer  patients with advanced  disease  and terminal  illness  (range  0-16). (Rosenfeld 
et al., in press).  The HAI has demonstrated a high degree  of internal  consistency 
(coefficient alpha  above  .80) and construct  validity  (e.g.,  a correlation  of.74  with 
clinical  ratings  of hopelessness).  The HAI demonstrated incremental validity  over and 
above  existing  measures  of hopelessness,  such as the Beck Hopelessness  Scale, which  
our group  has used in previous  research  studies.  (under  5 minutes; T1, T2, T3, T4) 
4. McGill  Quality  of Life Questionnaire (MQOL): A brief,  self-report  instrument  designed  
to assess  various domains of psychological, spi[INVESTIGATOR_37312], and physical functioning  
among terminally  ill patients  (Cohen  et al., 1995).  Patients rate their current  functioning  
on a scale of 0 to 10. The physical  and psychological domains  of the MQOL  are highly  
correlated  with other  measures  of quality of life, although  the existential/spi[INVESTIGATOR_734346].  This measure  has demonstrated reliability  (internal  consistency > .70  for the 
subscales),  and adequate  levels of concurrent  validity  (e.g.,  correlation  of .34 with the 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_734347])  (under  5 minutes;  T1, T2, T3, T4) 
5. Duke -UNC  Functional Social Support  Questionnaire  (FSSQ):  As a measure  of 
perceived  social support  we are utilizing  an 11- item multidimensional,  functional  social 
support  questionnaire (range  0-4). (Broadhead  et al., 1988).  The Duke -UNC  is a 
reliable  and valid  self-report  instrument that generates  a total score  representing  overall  
social support,  and two subscale  scores  corresponding  to confidant  support  and 
affective  support.  This measure  has adequate demonstrated  levels  of internal  
consistency  and test-test reliability  (> .60), as well as significant  correlations  with other  
measures  of social  functioning.  (5 minutes;  T1) 
6. Life Orientation Test Revised  (LOT -R): This 8-item measure  of optimism  has been  
widely  used in studies of adjustment  to stress  and illness  and depression  (range  8-56). 
Studies  have demonstrated  high levels  of reliability  (e.g.,  alpha  coefficients ranging  
from  =.76-.[ADDRESS_1003511]  reliability  of .79) as well as concurrent  and discriminant 
validity  (Scheier & Carver,  1985).  While  most  studies  have treated  the LOT -R as a 
trait- like measure  (dispositional optimism),  Carver  et al. (1993)  found  that LOT -R 
scores  were influenced  by [CONTACT_734427] a sample of women with breast  cancer.  
(2 minutes;  T1) 
 
Measures  of Psychotherapy  Preference,  Process  and Adherence:  
1. Pre-Randomization  Preference  Questionnaire  (PRP):  A face valid  questionnaire  
developed  by [CONTACT_734428]‘  preference for interest  in participating 
in a psychotherapy  intervention,  and preferences  regarding  content  and group  
assignment.  Patients  are asked  to rate (on a 0-4 Likert -type scale)  their preferences  for 
3 aspects  of psychotherapy  content:  a) social support, b) expression  of feelings,  c) 
finding  a sense  of meaning  and purpose  in life. Patients  are also being  asked  to indicate  
their preference  for the meaning -centered  vs. supportive  psychotherapy  vs. enhanced

usual  care study  arms  (they  are told that this information is solely  for analytic  purposes  
and will not influence  group  assignment). (1 minute;  PR) 
2. The Working Alliance  Inventory -Short  Form  (WAI -SF): The original  WAI  is a 36 item 
instrument  designed  to measure  variables  affecting  the degree  of counseling  success  
based  on Bordin‘s  (1979) conceptualization of the therapeutic alliance,  independent  of 
the counselor‘s  theoretical orientation (Horvath  et al, 1989).  There are three  sub-scales 
of the WAI  (tasks,  goals,  and bonds)  as well as a composite  score  (range  12-94). All 
items  are rated  on a seven  point  Likert  Scale  acceptable  validity  was demonstrated with 
the Counselor  Rating  Form  (CRF)  and the Empathy  scale of the Relationship Index  
(Horvath  et al, 1989).  Cronbach‘s  Alpha  of the WAI  composite  score  is 0.93 (Horvath  
et al, 1986).  We will be utilizing  a shortened  version  of the WAI  (WAI -SF), which 
consists  of 12 items  total with four items  in each of the three  sub-scales (tasks,  goals  
and bonds). Validity  has been  demonstrated for the WAI -SF based  on a similar  factor  
structure  with the original  36 item WAI.  Cronbach‘s  alphas  for the WAI -SF range  from  
0.83 to 0.98 (Busseri  et al 2003).  The WAI -SF self-report  rating  form  will be 
administered  to participants in the IMCP  and ISP treatment arms  at the post- 
intervention assessment.  (under  5 minutes;  T1, T2, T3: Not in EUC)  
3. Treatment Integrity/Adherence  to Intervention Format: We have developed a Treatment  
Integrity Rating  Form  based  on the standardized  treatment manuals  for each of the 
treatment  conditions  (IMCP  and ISP) which will allow  for independent  raters  to 
evaluate  each  session  of both interventions  for treatment  adherence  in terms  of process  
and content.  There  is one for form for all sessions.  Content  items  will be rated  on a 
Yes/No  scale,  and process  items  will be rated  on a 0-2 scale.  All sessions  will be audio - 
taped,  with prior  consent  of the participants. A random  sample of 30% of these  audio- 
tapes  will be evaluated  and rated  for treatment  integrity  by [CONTACT_734429].  
4. Post-Intervention Questionnaire (PIQ): A face valid questionnaire developed by [CONTACT_734430]/psychological treatments  have occurred  during  the intervening  period  
(administered  at the completion of the final individual  psychotherapy  intervention 
session).  Treatment adherence  is assessed  by [CONTACT_734431][INVESTIGATOR_734348]. Patients are asked  to rate (on a 0-4 
Likert -type scale)  the degree  to which the psychotherapy  they participated  in focused  
on: a) social  support,  b) expression of feelings,  c) finding  a sense  of meaning and 
purpose  in life. They  will be asked  to answer  an open -ended  question:  1) ―What  other  
forms  of psychiatric/psychological treatment have you received  during  this study‖?  (1 
minute;  T3; Not administered  to EUC).  
5. Optional Weekly Session  Rating  (Appendix  R): A subset  of the patients  in the IMCP  
arm will be asked  to complete  an optional brief  weekly  session  assessment. This will 
ask participants the extent  to and ways  in which  the meaning -related  topi[INVESTIGATOR_734349]/or  applicable.  Feedback  from  these  questions will help us 
determine  which meaning -related  topi[INVESTIGATOR_734350].  This survey  will be handed  out by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_734351],  and the participant will be given  the option to decline  
filling  it out. (Optional: weeks  1-7, IMCP  only)  
 
8.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
Minimal  risk of psychological distress  is posed  by [CONTACT_734432].  However,  since  study  items  were chosen  to reflect  what  are likely  to be 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

existing  concerns,  the present  study  is not expected  to markedly increase  participants‘ 
psychological distress  above  their routine  concerns.  Experienced  personnel, trained  in interviewing  
medically  ill individuals,  will administer  all instruments,  and will be supervised  by [CONTACT_9532]  [INVESTIGATOR_734352]. Participants‘ reactions  will be observed and signs  of 
significant  distress will be followed  up by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_734353].  In the unlikely  event  of significant  acute  distress,  participants 
will be referred to a staff member  from  the Department  of Psychiatry and Behavioral  Sciences. If a 
research  participant indicates  that s/he is acutely  suicidal and poses  a significant  and acute  risk of 
self-harm,  this information will be shared with their attending  physician  so that timely and 
appropriate psychiatric assessment  and care can be provided by [CONTACT_734433].  
However,  some  subjects  may become  distressed or experience anxiety when  discussing  end-of- life 
care issues  in the individual  psychotherapy  sessions or in response  to filling  out the self-report  
questionnaires  that inquire  about  their illness,  degree of depression, thoughts  on end of life care,  
feelings  of hopelessness,  pain and physical symptoms, quality  of life and social  support.  All 
patients  will be monitored  for severe  distress  and explicit  suicidal ideation  with plan or intent  at 
each assessment  point  (including  EUC).  We will continue  to utilize  interviewers  who have been  
trained  to be sensitive  to the nature  of end-of- life care issues.   When  necessary,  subjects  who 
experience  psychological distress  related  to filling  out self- report  questionnaires  will be referred to 
appropriate care by [CONTACT_734434].  
 
There  will be only one exception to the strict  patient confidentiality  policy,  described above,  which  
pertains  to information  obtained  during the research  assessment, which  would  indicate  that the 
patient is seriously suicidal and may pose a significant  and acute  risk of self- harm.  Subjects  will be 
informed  of this exception, and will also be informed  that such information  will be shared with the 
P.I. of the study  and their attending  physician so that timely  and appropriate psychiatric assessment 
and care can be provided by [CONTACT_734434]. 
 
There  is a slight  risk that participants may become  fatigued  or uncomfortable during the course  of 
the self-report  assessment.   The assessment  protocol  has been  designed to be as brief  as possible in 
order  to gather  the required  information.   If necessary, the questionnaires will be read to the 
participant.   The questionnaires should  take approximately  one hour to complete.

10.0 CRITERIA  FOR REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
Given the clinical  course  of patients  with advanced cancer,  not all patients entered  into the study  
are expected  to complete the entire trial.  Subjects  will be taken  off study  protocol  under  the 
following  circumstances:  
• Patient  voluntarily  withdraws  from study  
• Onset  of severe  cognitive difficulties  that preclude  participation in the intervention  or 
accurate  assessment  in the judgment of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734354] P.I. 
• Patient  is unable to tolerate  the intervention in the judgment of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734354] P.I. 
• Infectious  epi[INVESTIGATOR_734355].  
• Non-compliance with the intervention without medical cause or reasonable explanation in 
the judgment  of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734356] P.I. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_1003513]  involves  a parallel -arm randomized  controlled  clinical  trial to compare  the efficacy  of 
three  psychotherapy  interventions:  1) Individual  Meaning -Centered  Psychotherapy  (IMCP);  2) 
Supportive  Individual Psychotherapy  (ISP);  and 3) Enhanced  Usual  Care arm  (EUC).  We plan to 
recruit  altogether  414 patients  (138 in each  arm)  with solid  tumors with advanced  disease.  The 
primary outcomes  include  assessments  of meaning (LAP -R), spi[INVESTIGATOR_734303]-being  (FACIT -Sp) and 
psychological distress  (HADS,  SAHD,  HAI,  MQOL).  
Omnib  us MANOVA  for the prima  ry a im: 
The general  paradigm  for assessing  the outcomes will be multivariate analysis  of variance  
(MANOVA).  MANOVA  is appropriate because  the primary  psychosocial outcomes  are highly  
correlated.  The MANOVA  method  essentially combines the multiple  dependent  variables  together  
into a weighted  linear  combination of canonical variates.  The canonical coefficients  provide the 
weights  in this linear  combination.  The canonical  weights  have several  advantages.  The main  
advantage  is that they inform  the relative  contribution  of each outcome to the overall  canonical  
function  (i.e., whether  or not meaning  contributes more  than spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315]-being  to the overall  
canonical  function).  MANOVA  was chosen,  rather  than,  for example, a mixed -effects  modeling  
approach,  primarily  because  of these  considerations.  In MANOVA,  the combined canonical 
variate  is analyzed  in a manner  similar  to a univariate ANOVA.

outcomes  in meaning,  spi[INVESTIGATOR_734303]-being,  and psychological distress.   Thus,  the dependent  
variables  will be the six primary  outcome  assessments  (LAP -R, FACIT -Sp, HADS,  SAHD,  HAI,  
and MQOL)  measured  at the post-intervention time point  (week  7).  The sole independent  variable  
is the randomized  intervention assignment.   Dunlop,  Cortina,  Vaslow  & Burke  (1996)  showed  that 
this method  provides  the most  generalizable  findings,  findings  that do not depend  on the patients‘  
baseline  scores  or other  baseline  characteristics.  Thus,  the omnibus  MANOVA  will test whether  
or not the psychotherapy  groups  differ  in all six correlated outcomes of interest.  
The T2 (mid- intervention)  assessments  are made  because some  patients may be too sick to 
complete the 7-session  intervention.   For these  patients, we will use the T2 assessment  to represent  
the most  available data on intervention effect.  
Samp  le size a nd statistica  l po wer co nside  ratio ns: 
Two important  hypotheses  need to be established  in this trial:  1) IMCP  is superior  to EUC;  and 
more  importantly,  2) IMCP  is superior  to ISP for improving  psychosocial outcomes  in patients  with 
advanced  cancer.   Therefore,  we have based  sample size considerations on sufficient statistical  
power  to detect  these  two differences.  We have conservatively  based  our sample size calculations on 
a 0.20 standardized  mean  difference  in the MANOVA  canonical variates between  the IMCP  and ISP 
interventions. This 0.20 difference  is what  Cohen  would  consider a ―small‖  effect  size in 
psychosocial research  (Cohen,  1992),  representing  subtle  group  differences  typi[INVESTIGATOR_734357].  Cohen  (1992)  distilled the findings  of decades  of psychosocial  
research  and arrived  at a classification of a ―small‖  effect  (0.20  standardized  mean difference),  a 
―medium‖  effect  (0.50  difference),  and a ―large‖  effect  (0.80+  difference).  This ―small ‖ difference  
is also  a sensible a ssumption, due in part to the small group  differences  in some  of the psychosocial 
outcomes  in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_734358] (Table  1, e.g., psychological distress). Thus,  we planned to have a 
sufficiently  large  sample size to detect  subtle  differences.  Overall, this conservative  estimate  would  
accommodate outcomes  in psychological distress which  out pi[INVESTIGATOR_734359]  a small  difference.  
Based  on these  assumptions, we would  need [ADDRESS_1003515]-intervention 
(week  7) in order  to obtain  a power  of 0.80.  Other  assumptions that go into this estimation 
included  two a priori  contrasts  (IMCP  vs. EUC  and IMCP  vs. ISP),  and a two-sided,  type-I error  
rate of 0.[ADDRESS_1003516].  The statistical power  calculations were  obtained  from  the 
computer  program  G*Power  version 3.1 (Faul,  Erdfelder,  Lang  & Buchner,  2007),  for a 
MANOVA  model with six correlated  outcome variables.   The output  of the G*Power  estimate  is 
included  below.

A sample size of 104 per randomization arm (138 at baseline)  at post- intervention  would  
accommodate a post-intervention attrition rate of up to 25%,  which is within  the attrition rate in 
our pi[INVESTIGATOR_734360].  The estimated  sample size at the follow -up time point  (week  15) is 90 
participants per intervention condition. 
Based  on our current  IMCP  Group  psychotherapy  intervention,  we are currently  recruiting  at a rate 
of 5 – 6 individuals  to participate. This study  involves  the IMCP  individual  therapy,  which  is 
more  flexible  in terms  of enrolling patients  quickly and scheduling  for starting  of the therapy  
sessions.   Thus  we are confident  that we will be able to recruit  at a rate of 8 – 9 individuals  per 
month and complete the total enrollment  of 414 within  the 4-year recruitment period.  
Data a na lytic p la ns for the seco nda ry a ims 
To examine  clinical  and demographic  variables  that may correspond  to differential responses  to 
Individual  Meaning -Centered  Psychotherapy  (e.g., po tential moderating  influences  such  as gender,  
race/ethnicity,  religiosity,  level  of pre- intervention  social support, op timism, physical symptom 
burden,  prognostic  awareness,  and treatment  dose).  
 
We anticipate  that several  socio-demographic and clinical  variables  will moderate the impact  of 
IMCP.  For example, we expect  that level  of religiosity (based  on the IE-12) at the baseline/pre - 
intervention assessment  will be inversely  related  to treatment response  (i.e., less religious  
individuals  will be more  likely  to experience benefits  from  this intervention  than more  religious  
individuals).  We also predict that level of social support  will moderate  improvement, with those  
patients  reporting  higher  levels  of social  support  receiving  the greatest  benefits  (because  of the 
emphasis  on connectedness  to others  as a source  of meaning in the IMCP  intervention).  On the 
other  hand,  we expect  that patients  with poorer  physical functioning  (e.g.,  lower  Karnofsky sco re), 
greater  pain severity  and overall  symptom  burden  (MSAS  Global Distress  Index  scores)  will be 
less likely  to benefit  from  the interventions, in part because  unmanaged  physical symptoms may 
impede participation. 
Ana lyse s: Putative  explanatory covariables will be identified  and tested  statistically  using  the 
method  originally  described by [CONTACT_734435]  (1986),  and more  recently  by [CONTACT_38722] 
(2008).  Specifically,  these  will involve  Multi-Variate Analysis  of Covariance  (MANCOVA)  using  
the changes  in the six primary  outcomes  (post  intervention minus  baseline)  as a function  of 
intervention condition, controlling  as covariates  the effects  of gender,  race/ethnicity,  and baseline  
covariates  in religiosity,  social support,  optimism,  physical  symptom burden, pain severity, and 
overall  symptom burden.   This analytic  approach  entails  the following  advantages:  1) change  
scores  have the advantage  of clearly  identifiable  direction of change,  2) psychosocial  outcomes are 
measured  on an interval  scale  (such  as measures  of temperature in the Fahrenheit  or Celsius  
scales),  so that change  scores  are less prone  to problems associated with respondents  using  
different  internal  psychological scales;  and 3) precedence  exists  (Flay et al. 1995)  in interventions  
designed  for behavioral  change.   This method  offers  several  advantages,  both in terms  of power  as 
well as interpretation,  to a traditional repeated  measures  design  for analyzing  data when  both 
independent  and dependent  variables  are assessed  at two or more  time points  (Huck  & McLean,  
1975;  Willet,  1988 -9). Change  score  analyses  will include  the baseline  score  as a covariate if 
change  is significantly  correlated with baseline  score  (as is often  the case).  
To assess  the relative  impact  of Individual  Meaning -Centered Psychotherapy  on different  aspects

of different  aspects  of meaning  (e.g., purpose,  coherence,  existential vacuum)  will be modeled  by 
[CONTACT_734436].  The canonical 
weights  will be used to estimate  the relative  contribution  of each mean  components  on the overall  
canonical  function.  Components of spi[INVESTIGATOR_734303]-being will also be  analyzed  similarly,  in a 
separate  MANOVA  model.   Univariate ANOVA  contrasts will be used to compare IMCP  against  
ISP and IMCP  against  EUC.  
To explore whether  an enhanced  sense  of meaning ―explains‖  (mediates) improved  psychological 
well-being (i.e., increased  quality  of life, decreased  psychological distress: 
This mediation analysis  will be carried  out using  a MANCOVA  model.   The dependent  variables  
will be the changes  in psychosocial  outcomes at the follow -up assessment  time point  (week  15 
minus  baseline)  in quality of life and psychological distress as a function  of intervention condition, 
adjusting  for the post-intervention change  in meaning (post - intervention LAP-R minus  baseline  
LAP-R). Thus,  the follow -up outcomes will be predicted  by [CONTACT_734437]- intervention 
meaning.   This lagged  analysis  is necessary  because  there  is a potential  confounding  effect,  for 
example,  in using  the post-intervention changes  in meaning in predicting  post- intervention quality  
of life. The lagged  analysis  between  follow -up outcomes in quality of life and psychological 
distress  and post- intervention  changes  in meaning  preserves  a plausible temporal ordering  of 
causes  and effects.  
Inte nt-to-trea t a na lyses  a nd ha nd ling o f missing  d ata : 
Intent -to-treat (ITT)  analysis  is the gold standard  in evaluating the relative  efficacy  of therapeutic  
regimes  for patients assigned  to different  treatment  arms whether  or not they comply  with the full 
treatment  plan as defined  in the protocol. In contrast  to studies that assess  clinical  outcomes  that  
are observable  whether  or not patients comply  with therapy,  it is likely  in this study  that patients  
who fail to participate in particular counseling  sessions will also be missing  the corresponding  
outcome  data.  Thus,  examination  and imputation of incomplete data will be an integral  part of our 
ITT analysis.  Data for intermediate  time points  might  be imputable by [CONTACT_734438].  However,  it is more  problematic  to assess  outcomes for patients who 
essentially  drop out of the study,  namely,  who are missing  the final (and possibly preceding)  
evaluations.   Although  we shall  endeavor  to obtain  final evaluation-time data even  for patients  
who discontinue  the counseling,  but because of the likelihood  that premature withdrawal  is related  
to deteriorating  physical  health,  we cannot  rely on this and will therefore  use appropriate  statistical  
methods.  One preferred approach  is the Pattern -Mixture  Model  (Hedeker  & Gibbons,  1997),  which 
assumes  that patients can be grouped  into a small  number  of implicit  cohorts  with different  patterns  
of missing  data. This method  models  the trajectories  of responses  within  each  cohort  and   
combines  results  across  cohorts  to make  overall  comparisons between  treatment arms.  The Pattern - 
Mixture Model  can be relatively  easily  applied in practice  using  a publicly  accessible SAS macro.  
This approach  will handle two potential, inter-related  issues,  namely,  intent -to-treat analysis  and 
missing  data while  making  a global  assessment  of the overall  efficacy  of the two types  of 
counseling.   We anticipate that the majority  of patients  will complete  most  or all of the planned  
sessions  and the corresponding  assessments. However,  our pi[INVESTIGATOR_734361]-described approach  even  if drop-out rates do not 
differ  significantly  between  the two treatment arms.  
 
Missing  data : 
Because  attrition may significantly  impact  the MANOVA,  we will utilize  several  techniques  for 
dealing with missing  data (Nich  & Carrol,  1997;  Singer  & Willett,  1991).  These  techniques  may

include  estimating  missing  data, complete data analysis,  and intention to treat analysis. Although  
missing  data can be estimated  using  a number  of powerful  techniques (Graham,  Hofer,  Donaldson,  
MacKinnon  & Schafer,  1997),  we intend  to use a multiple  imputation procedure  described by 
[CONTACT_734439] O lsen (1997),  which is capable  of handling  categorical  data, continuous  data, and any 
combination of the two.  Graham  et al. (1997)  have argued  that parameter estimates  using  this 
method  are unbiased  and have standard  errors  that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_734362].  In order  to assess  the effect  of this imputation method,  we will 
compare  results  based  on imputed  data to those  based  only on subjects  who completed  the study  
(this comparison allows  for an assessment of the extent  to which biases  may have influenced  study  
results).  Finally,  we can analyze  data assuming  that those  subjects  who dropped out of treatment  
had no change  in either  meaning  or psychological distress. 
 
Procedures  to co ntro l Fa lse Disco  very Ra te (F DR) : 
One final issue  is that of multiple  statistical analyses.  While  the use of MANOVA  models  
decreases  the possibility of inflated  type I error  normally  observed  when  several  outcome  
measures  are being  evaluated,  analysis  of the individual  dependent  variables  can also incorporate a 
multiple  comparisons  method,  such as a the False  Discovery Rate -controlling  procedure  
(Benjamini  & Hochberg,  1995).  
 
 
12.1 RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRAT ION AND RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES 
 
12.2 Research  Participant  Registration  
 
Confirm  eligibility  as defined  in the section entitled Criteria for Patient/Subject  Eligibility.  
 
Obtain  informed  consent,  by [CONTACT_734440].  
During  the registration  process  registering  individuals  will be required  to complete a 
protocol  specific  Eligibility  Checklist.  
All participants must  be registered  through  the Protocol  Participant Registration  (PPR)  
Office  at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer  Center. PPR  is available  Monday  through  
Friday from  8:30am – 5:30pm at [PHONE_214].  Registrations must  be submitted  via the 
PPR Electronic  Registration  System  (http ://pp r/).  The completed signature  [CONTACT_154112]/RA  or verbal  script/RA, a completed  Eligibility  Checklist  and other  
relevant documents must  be uploaded  via the PPR Electronic  Registration System.  
 
12.3 Randomization  
 
Participants will be randomized  to one of the two 7-week  interventions  (Individual  Meaning  
Centered  Psychotherapy  or Supportive  Individual  Psychotherapy)  or the Enhanced  Usual  Care.  
After  eligibility  is confirmed  and immediately  after consent  is obtained, patients  will be registered  
in the MSKCC  Protocol  Participant Registration  (PPR)  system  and randomized  using  the MSKCC  
Clinical  Research  Database (CRDB),  by [CONTACT_734441] [PHONE_214]  between  
the hours  of 8:30 am and 5:30 pm, Monday  - Friday.

Randomization is overseen  by [CONTACT_734442].  Randomization will be 
accomplished  by [CONTACT_206951], and stratified  by [CONTACT_734443]:  1) baseline  Distress  Thermometer (4 through  6 vs. 7 through  10); and 2) baseline  
Karnofsky  score  (60 through  79 vs. 80 or  greater).  
Patients  who are registered  and randomized,  but cannot  make  their scheduled  session time 
(because  of conflict  or illness)  will be placed on a waitlist  so they can be offered  a spot when  they 
are available  in the future,  in the same  treatment assignment  as randomized.  
13.1 DAT A M ANAGEMENT ISSUES 
 
A Research  Study  Assistant (RSA)  will be assigned.  The responsibilities of the RSA  include  
project  compliance,  data collection, abstraction and entry,  data reporting,  regulatory  monitoring,  
problem resolution and prioritization, and coordinating  the activities  of the protocol  study  team.  
The data collected  for this study  will entered  into a secure  database,  the hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_734363] a locked,  secured  location  and will only be accessible to study  staff.  
Data will be stripped of any identifying  information.  A list, matching  participants‘ names  and case 
numbers  will also be  kept in a secure  area at MSKCC.  All questionnaire  data completed  by 
[CONTACT_734444] a study  code number.  
Study  findings  will be presented  in aggregate  form only,  with no reference  made  to individual  
participant‘s  data. The Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_734364],  reviewing and reporting  all necessary  adverse  events  to the institutional IRB as 
appropriate.  Adverse  events  are identified  through  standard,  routine  protocol  review  and clinical  
assessment  of each participant in the study. Minimal  data set will be maintained  in CRDB.  
13.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient accruals  and completeness of registration  data.  Data 
quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data and inconsistencies.   Accrual  rates and 
extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow - up will be monitored  periodically throughout  the 
study  period and potential problems will be brought  to the attention of the study  team  for 
discussion  and action.   Random-sample data quality  and protocol  compliance audits  will be 
conducted  by [CONTACT_2362]. 
13.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer  Center  were 
approved  by [CONTACT_11094]  2001.  The plans address  the new policies  
set forth  by [CONTACT_28643] ―Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute for Data and 
Safety Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials‖  which can be found  at: 
http://www.cancer.gov  /clinicaltria  ls/conducting/dsm  -gu idelines/pag  e1. The DSM Plans  at 
MSKCC  were established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_11096].   The MSKCC  
Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at:

There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_211148], safety and 
quality.   There are institutional processes  in place  for quality assurance  (e.g., protocol  monitoring,  
compliance and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff education on clinical  
research  QA) and departmental procedures  for quality control,  plus there  are two institutional

committees  that are responsible  for monitoring the activities  of our clinical  trials  programs.  The 
committees:  Data and Safety Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials, and 
the Data and Safety Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials, report  to the Center‘s  
Research  Council  and Institutional Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for it‘s level  
of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.   Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  in- house  
sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed  and the monitoring  
procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.  
 
This trial is funded  by [CONTACT_6812]/NCH  and will comply with all of its requirements  for Data and 
Safety Monitoring.  This trial sponsor  does not have an independent  Data Safety  Monitoring 
Process.

or experience anxiety when  filling  out the self-report  questionnaires which  inquire  about  their 
illness,  degree  of depression thoughts  on end of life care,  feelings  of hopelessness,  pain and 
physical  symptoms,  quality of life and social support.  All the psychotherapy individual

Subje  ct Burde  n 
In an effort  to minimize  patient  burden, the assessment  protocol  has been  designed  to be as brief  as 
possible  in order  to gather  the required  information.   The questionnaires take approximately one 
hour to complete,  depending  on the individual  patient.   Research  staff will interrupt  an assessment  
if a patient  is fatigued  or in significant  pain.  In an effort  to ease patient burden,  questionnaires can 
be mailed  to patients, read to patients  over the phone,  or read to patients in person  to help with 
completion if necessary. 
 
Additionally,  for patients  who express  interest  in participating in the study  but require  financial  
assistance  for transportation  to/from  individual  sessions  or to complete  assessments, a $20.00  
travel  reimbursement  per session will be offered.  
 
14.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC‘s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure of protected  health information 
pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization form.   The use and disclosure  of 
protected  health information  will be limited  to the individuals  described in the Research  
Authorization form.   A Research  Authorization form  must  be completed  by [CONTACT_9532]  [INVESTIGATOR_127111].  
 
14.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
Any SAE  must  be reported  to the IRB/PB  as soon  as possible but no later than 5 calendar  days.  
The IRB/PB  requires  a Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE  report  be submitted  
electronically  to the SAE  Office at sae@  mskcc.org .  The report  should  contain  the following

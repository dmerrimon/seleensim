Provide a summary of the study (recommended length: less than 50 0 words).  
 
Colorectal cancer is a common but preventable condition, and increasing 
colorectal cancer screening is one of the most impactful public health contributions in 
the field of gastroenterology. Text messaging  is a simple, cheap, and rapid method to 
reach patients that  may improve adherence to colonoscopy appointments as well as 
simplify the process of bowel preparation.  
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_822284]/surveillance 
colonoscopy and bowel preparation quality at an urban VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  The goal is 
to improve adherence to colonoscopy among patients who are due for a repeat colonoscopy.  
The primary outcomes are process feasibility measures including 
recruitment rate, refusal rate for participation, and retention rate through end of study.  
The secondary outcomes include documenting the proportion of patients 
who attended their scheduled colonoscopy appointment in the intervention group vs. the control group as well as documenting the proportion of patients with adequate bowel preparation between the two groups. We will also document the number of patients who responded to the National Annie Survey.

2.0 Introduction  
 
[Version 3 09/ 29/2023]   Page 5 of 20 
 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in 
the US. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_822286], the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System estimates that only 72% of eligible adults aged 50- 75 years are up- to-date with 
screening in the US. These figures overestimate the proportion of Americans who receive adequate long- term protection from CRC because they are based 
on a one- time (i.e., cross -sectional) measurement in a single year. The protective 
effect of screening diminishes over time; thus, national recommendations emphasize the importance of repeated testing—with fecal occult blood and 
immunochemical testing (FOBT/FIT) annually or colonoscopy every 10 years —to 
obtain the full intended benefits of a screening program.  
 
The vast majority of patients undergoing CRC screening at the VA [LOCATION_001] Harbor Health Care System (NYHHCS) receive colonoscopy, and a national VA study found that 38% of appointments made at colonoscopy -performing clinics 
following a positive FOBT were missed, cancelled, or rescheduled.[ADDRESS_1140120] for health- related text messaging is high even in vulnerable 
populations such as homeless V eterans.5 Text messaging has been shown to 
increase adherence to FIT by [CONTACT_8622] 24%,[ADDRESS_1140121] 3% improvement.[ADDRESS_1140122] be repeated,9 which in terms of clinical outcome is equivalent to

 clinicians), a text messaging service designed by [CONTACT_822295] -care and improve health management.  
 
Only one study has examined the effect of text messaging on screening colonoscopy to date, and the results were modest but limited by [CONTACT_822296].[ADDRESS_1140124] not used a series of messages to prompt a complex set of actions in real -time (e.g. bowel preparation) nor allowed participants to request 
additional information on demand. The bidirectional text messaging platform is novel in that it will include both of these features, which mimic the characteristics of a human patient navigator. If the pi[INVESTIGATOR_822287] a larger efficacy trial, then low -cost virtual patient 
navigation using text messaging may become an accepted method to promote 
colorectal cancer screening and other preventive services.

5.0 Study Procedures  
5.1 Study Design  
All individuals who agree to participate in the study will provide written 
consent  and HIPAA authorization. A total of 50 consented participants will be 
randomized 1:1 to either the text messaging (intervention) group or the standard 
care (control) group. We will use block randomization with block sizes ranging from 2 to 6. The intervention group will receive a series of instructional and motivational text messages, which will be sent starting 7- 14 days before and until 
the day of the procedure.  
 
For instructional messages, earlier messages will remind patients of the 
colonoscopy appointment and later messages will help patients complete the 
bowel preparation process in real -time. Table 1 shows the timing and 
representative content of the instructional messages. Some messages may be 
sent over a range of days until the procedure, depending on when the participant enrolled and the type of bowel preparation (1 or 2 day) the participant is recommended to undergo. Table [ADDRESS_1140129] of representative focus group tested motivational messages that will be sent along with instructional messages. The specific motivational messages will be tailored, whenever possible, based on the patient demographic traits (e.g., age, sex, and race and ethnicity).  
 
Due to character limits in Annie, longer messages may be sent as multiple 
texts. Some messages will be bidirectional, and participants will be able to 
respond to receive additional information. Additional information will be delivered automatically based on the participant’s response and does not need to be sent manually by [CONTACT_3476]. The national Annie colonoscopy survey (Appendix) will be conducted within [ADDRESS_1140130] to measure clinical secondary 
outcomes, such as the proportion of patients who 1) attend the scheduled 
colonoscopy appointment and 2) had adequate bowel preparation.  
 
• Study Timelines 
We estimate that we will need 3 months to enroll all participants and an 
additional 1 month to complete the intervention. Analysis will be completed within 
1 month. In all, the study will be completed in 5 months.

2 Colorectal cancer and colonoscopy:  “Cancers take years to 
develop, so the older you get, the higher probability, the better to 
have it done again.”  
3 Manhattan VA Veteran: “This thing (colorectal cancer) could kill 
you, and it's preventable if they catch it in time, and it just takes a few minutes…It would be stupid not to do it.” 
4 In 2023, more than 150,000 Americans will be diagnosed with 
colorectal cancer and more than 50,000 will die from this disease. Don’t be a statistic. Get screened for colorectal cancer.  
5 Myth: A colonoscopy takes too long, so it can wait.   
Fact: A colonoscopy usually takes about 30– 60 minutes and can 
prevent colorectal cancer (the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the US). Taking just a few hours out of your day can prevent a life with colorectal cancer.  
6 Myth: I don’t need a colonoscopy because I feel fine and don’t 
have any symptoms.  
Fact: Colorectal cancer usually does not cause symptoms at the early stage. When symptoms occur, the cancer may already be at a late stage. Colonoscopy can both prevent colorectal cancer and catch it before symptoms appear.  
[ADDRESS_1140133] to drink and feel unsure if you want the procedure?  
Actually, the volume of bowel prep has decreased by 50% over the years. You can also add flavoring to the solution to improve the taste. Think of bowel prep as a one -time cleaning in exchange 
for years of peace of mind that your colon is healthy.  
8 Myth: The colonoscopy is going to hurt.  
Fact: It is completely okay to have reservations and concerns 
about the procedure. You can request sedation during the 
[Version 3 09/ 29/2023]   Page [ADDRESS_1140134] 
questions about sedation, talk to your GI doctor or nurse.  
9 Myth: I’m not at risk for colorectal cancer, so I don’t need a 
colonoscopy  
Fact: [ADDRESS_1140135] any risk factors. But 
screening can prevent 60% of deaths from colorectal cancer. 
Don’t be a statistic.  
10 Myth: Colorectal cancer mainly affects men, so women don’t need 
a colonoscopy.  
Fact: Colorectal cancer is the 3rd leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the [LOCATION_003]. 1 in 23 men and 1 in 25 women 
will develop colorectal cancer in their lifetime. Don’t take this 
chance.  
11 Myth: Colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_822288].   
Fact: Colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_822289]. The risk of perforation (tear) in 
the colon is less than 1 in 2,000 procedures. On the other hand, 1 
in every 24 people will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in their lifetime.  
12 More than 52,000 people will die from colorectal cancer this year. 
You can prevent this. Your loved ones are counting on you. Don’t be a statistic, be a survivor.

16 Colorectal cancer is often a silent disease. Usually there are no 
symptoms. That’s why getting screened is so important.

 18 If you are 45 or older, you’re at a higher risk for colon cancer —
even if you are healthy. Ask your doctor for a screening test.  
19 Colon cancer starts with a polyp in the large intestine. Polyps are 
very common in people age 45 and older, but they can be 
detected and removed before they turn into cancer. Don’t die of cancer. Talk to your doctor about colon cancer prevention.  
20 You are so important to your family, don’t let them down! Don’t 
procrastinate any longer! Get screened for colon cancer today! It could save your life.  
21 Colon cancer is the 2nd leading cancer killer in the U.S., but it 
doesn’t have to be. Colon cancer can be prevented or found at an early stage. Getting screened is absolutely necessary! Call a doctor today.

5.[ADDRESS_1140139] 20% of participants (10 individuals) are women. Participants will be recruited from a list of patients sc heduled for colonoscopy. Research team members will 
screen and identify eligible participants using the VA electronic medical records system (CRPS). Participants will be either recruited during their in -person pre-
colonoscopy clinic visit or through mailed invitations followed by [CONTACT_8622] 3 follow up 
phone calls.  This will be conducted by [CONTACT_23164].  A research team 
member will explain the study to each potential participant  and obtain written 
consent and HIPAA authorization from the participant  in a private room to 
maintain patient privacy . For participants randomized to the intervention arm, a 
clinician member of the research team will obtain verbal consent from the patient to enroll in Annie, in accordance with requirements for who can consent when 
using Annie (https://mobile.va.gov/sites/default/files/annie- app-clinicians -quick -
start- guide-1- 3.pdf). Only individuals deemed to have capacity are eligible for 
study participation.  No vulnerable populations will be included.  
[Version 3 09/ 29/2023]   Page 13 of 20 
 Participants will be responsible for the costs of the text messages they 
may receive as part of the intervention. Each participant will receive $[ADDRESS_1140140] had up -to-date TMS 
and CITI trainings on how to obtain and document informed consent as well as regarding human subjects ’ protection requirements . 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of risks and possible benefits of participation will be provided to the participants and their families.  Consent forms will be IRB 
approved.  The investigator will explain the research study to the participant and 
answer any questions that may arise. All participants will receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants. Participants will have the opportunity to ask questions prior to signing the 
consent form. The participants will have the opportunity to discuss the study or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participants may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the study. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_34693].  
 
Signed consent  will be documented in the subject’s research record. The 
consent process, including the name [CONTACT_21811], will be 
thoroughly documented in the subject’s research record . 
 
 
5.4 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
Inclusion criteria:  
-Age 45- 85 years  
-Has previously undergone a colonoscopy and is currently due for a repeat 
screening or surveillance colonoscopy  at the VA.  
[Version 3 09/ 29/2023]   Page 14 of 20 
  
Exclusion criteria:  
-Patients not due for screening or surveillance colonoscopy. This will be based 
on 2020 guidelines from the US Multi -Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer.  
-Patients with personal history of CRC/inflammatory bowel disease/ hereditary 
colon cancer syndrome or family history of hereditary colon cancer syndrome. 
These criteria will be determined based on ICD9/[ADDRESS_1140141].  
 
5.5 Study Evaluations  
 
The national Annie colonoscopy survey (Appendix) will be conducted 
within [ADDRESS_1140142] to measure clinical secondary 
outcomes, such as the proportion of patients who 1) attend the scheduled colonoscopy appointment and 2) had adequate bowel preparation.  We will 
extract the following data: Names, MRN, date of birth, sex, race and ethnicity,  
telephone number, mailing address,  date of colonoscopy, [LOCATION_011] Bowel Prep 
Scale score, and colonoscopy findings.  
5.6 Data Analysis  
 
Data Analysis  
The primary feasibility will be evaluated with descriptive statistics. For the secondary 
efficacy outcomes, we will use the chi -squared or Fisher’s exact test to compare 
proportions in the two groups.  
 
Power calculations  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_822290] a subsequent 
larger efficacy trial. Power calculations were not performed for the primary outcome. For 
the secondary outcome of colonoscopy attendance, based on the current 70% attendance at the study site, we will have 80% power to detect a 22% absolute increase 
in attendance in the intervention group, assuming a type I error of 10%.  
[Version 3 09/ 29/2023]   Page 15 of 20 
 5.7 Withdrawal of Subjects  
Participants may withdraw from the study at any time. For participants who 
withdraw, any data collected up to the time of withdrawal may still be retained 
and analyzed. Those who are randomized to the intervention arm can stop 
receiving messages at any point by [CONTACT_227734] “Stop” to Annie.  There will be no 
adverse consequence for a participant who decides to withdraw from the study.  
6.0 Reporting  
 
All unanticipated problems, serious adverse events, and protocol 
deviations  will be reported to the IRB . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_822291].  In the event on an adverse event  that is related to 
text messaging, messages will be stopped immediately on the Annie application if the participant is unsure how to text back, “Stop.” Any other adverse events will be addressed directly with patients and dealt with accordingly.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_291324]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_822292]. The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_822293] (each month during the duration of the 
study) for data completeness and accuracy as well as protocol compliance. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_822294].  
7.[ADDRESS_1140143] protected and stored in a secure folder on the VA 
Network. Hardcopy consent and HIPAA authorization forms will stored in a 
locked cabinet inside the PI’s locked office.  Names, MRN numbers, phone numbers, 
and addresses will be collected. This information is needed to mail invitation letters, make phone calls, and track patients in CPRS. 
 Dates will also be accessed in order to 
measure clinical secondary outcomes, such as the proportion of patients who attended 
the scheduled colonoscopy appointment. Only individuals with IRB approval  and 
listed in the protocol  will have access to the data. All personnel who work on this 
project will complete the necessary CITI and TMS training for research involving 
patient data.  Once all the data has been cleaned for analysis, any identifying 
patient information will be removed to further ensure confidentiality.  Data from 
this project may be published in aggregate, anonymous form. The study will be closed once all planned publications are completed. Upon completion of this project, the data will be stored for at least the minimum amount of time as stipulated by [CONTACT_1201].  There is no plan to destroy collected data. No 
biospecimens are being collected for this study.

In thi
s study, participant will receive texting over mobile/cell phones and this method of 
communication may result in a breach of confidential information because text 
messages to mobile/cell phones are not encrypted. This means that information participants  send or receive by [CONTACT_822297][INVESTIGATOR_841], or by [CONTACT_822298]/cell phone provider or carrier.  
 
10.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
For participants who were planning to cancel their colonoscopy or did not know how to do the 
bowel prep, the text messaging intervention may help them to prepare for and attend the 
procedure. Obtaining a colonoscopy has been proven to lower the risk of colorectal cancer , 
which is a potential benefit to participants . If the intervention is shown to be effective, then it 
may be adopted at other institutions and increase colonoscopy uptake in the general population. 
It would also contribute to generalizable knowledge by [CONTACT_822299].

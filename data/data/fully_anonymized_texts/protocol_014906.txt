idential  6 Study Design and Investigational Plan 
This 
prospective, Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study will evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of acoramidis in symptomatic subjects compared to placebo, administered on a background of stable heart 
failure therapy. Screening and randomization will be followed by a total of 30 months of blinded, placebo-
controlled treatment. At the end of 12 months of treatment (Part A) efficacy of acoramidis will be assessed 
through analyses of the functional (6MWT) and health-related QoL (as measured by [CONTACT_241426]-specific instrument 
KCCQ) endpoints. At the end of 30 months of treatment (Part B), efficacy of acoramidis will be further 
assessed through analysis of A ll-cause mortality, cumulative frequency of CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , change 
from baseline in NT-proBNP, and change from baseline in 6MWT.  
Subjects are not allowed to be treated with any ATTR- CM specific therapy during the first [ADDRESS_592291] chooses treatment with ATTR- CM specific therapy, they will be asked to complete an early 
termination visit prior to discontinuation/withdrawal.  
If, during participation in the study, tafamidis becomes available for the indication of ATTR-CM and subjects 
have access to it, subjects will be permitted to initiate therapy with tafamidis as a concomitant medication if 
they have completed at least [ADDRESS_592292] (IMP), discontinue or withdraw from the 
trial at any time, they will be asked to complete an early termination visit and associated procedures. If a 
subject chooses to initiate treatment with another therapy, including tafamidis in the first 12 months of the 
study, they will be asked to complete an ET visit and associated procedures prior to 
discontinuation/withdrawal. Subjects will continue monthly telephone contact [CONTACT_462607] 30. All 
participating subjects will be asked to consent to determination of vital status (alive, death, heart transplant, 
receiving cardiac mechanical assist device [CMAD]) at Month 30, either via direct contact [CONTACT_462608], regardless of discontinuation or withdrawal status. Unless precluded by [CONTACT_462609], 
consent for determination of vital status through public records may not be withdrawn. 
All subjects who complete 30 months of blinded study therapy and the final assessments of the double-blind 
treatment period (Month 30 visit) may be eligible to participate in an Open Label Extension (OLE) study 
(Study AG10-304, a separate protocol) of long-term acoramidis treatment.

Eidos Therapeutics Inc. Treatment of Symptomatic ATTR Cardiomyopathy 
Acoramidis (AG10 )  Protocol AG10-[ADDRESS_592302], 
a total sample size of approximately 365 subjects will provide 90% power to reject the null hypothesis of 
no mean difference between groups. To allow for the possibility that approximately 20% of subjects may not 
complete the Month 12 6MWT, and that approximately 10% of subjects will have baseline eGFR 
< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 the adjusted sample size is approximately 510 subjects (340 allocated to acoramidis and 
170 allocated to placebo). 
Part B : The power for Part B was originally estimated based on the primary endpoint of a hierarchical 
combination of A ll-cau se mortality and CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149701] a 30-month treatment period. The test 
statistic for the combined endpoint is Finkelstein and Schoenfeld’s ( Finkelstein 1999 ) adaptation of the 
generalize
d Gehan Wilcoxon test (and will be referred to as the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld test). Simulations based 
on estimates of mortality and CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462567]-ACT result in greater than 90% power 
with two-sided alpha = 0.04 with total N = 460 (= 0.9*510, i.e., after excluding 10% of subjects with baseline 
eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) for the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld test to reject the null hypothesis that neither A ll-
cause mortality nor CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462568]. Simulations 
assumed an A ll-cause mortality rate of 40% for placebo with a hazard ratio of 0.7, mean number of CV-related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462569] 30 of 1.15 and 0.75 in the placebo and acoramidis groups, respectively.  
The primary endpoint i s a hierarchical combination of A ll-cause mortality, cumulative frequency of CV-related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], change from baseline in NT-proBNP, and change from baseline in 6MWT over a 30-month 
fixed treatment duration .  
The number of subjects who will initiate, and when they will initiate, tafamidis after Month 12 is unknown 
and is not possible to estimate with any precision. Simulations to assess power for the four-component 
hierarchical endpoint (All-cause mortality, cumulative frequency of CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], change from 
baseline in NT-proBNP, and change from baseline in 6MWT) were conducted under various scenarios taking 
into consideration potential tafamidis use and potential ly missing data. The estimated power across the various 
scenarios remains above 80%. 
Efficacy Analyses 
The alpha for Part A is 0.01 and 0.04 for Part B. 
Part A : The primary analysis will be the change from baseline to Month 12 in the distance walked during the 
6MWT. The key secondary endpoint will be the change from baseline to Month 12 on the KCCQ-OS.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM). The model 
will include terms for randomization stratification factors, treatment, time, treatment by [CONTACT_6491]. A n 
unstructured variance-covariance model will be used. The key secondary endpoint will be analyzed similarly. 
The secondary endpoint of change from baseline in TTR level will also be analyzed similarly at Month 12. To 
control alpha, KCCQ-OS and change from baseline in TTR level will be formally tested sequentially in this 
order at significance level of 0.01 if the primary endpoint is statistically significant at the 0.01 level.  
An additional secondary endpoint will be measurements of TTR stabilization at Month 12. 
Part B : The primary analysis will use a hierarchical combination of the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method 
applied to All-cause mortality , cumulati ve frequency of CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], change from baseline in 
NT-proBNP, and change from baseline in 6MWT  at the last available visit over the 30-month fixed treatment 
duratio
n. 
The key secondary endpoints adjusted for alpha are: 
 Change from baseline to Month 30 in the distance walked during the 6MWT 
 Change from baseline to Month 30 on the KCCQ- OS 
 Change from baseline to Month 30 in serum TTR level 
 All-Cause Mortality by [CONTACT_43380] 30, including death due to any cause, heart transplant, or CMAD

idential  11 To control alpha at the 0.04 level, the key secondary endpoints will be formally  tested sequentially in the order 
shown above if the primary endpoint is statistically significant at the 0.04 level.  
Additional secondary endpoints (not adjusted for alpha) include: 
 A hierarchical combination of All-cause mortality and cumulative frequency of CV-related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_308998] a 30-month fixed treatment duration 
 A hierarchical combination of All-Cause mortality, cumulative frequency of CV-related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and change from baseline in 6MWT over a 30-month fixed treatment duration

 CV mortality by [CONTACT_43380] 30 
 TTR stabilization measured in established ex-vivo assays (FPE and Western blot) in the PK-PD 
substudy  
Safety Analyses: 
In P
art A, safety and tolerability data, excluding adjudicated CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], will be summarized 
for the entire study cohort after data freeze that will occur after the last subject for analysis has completed 
12 months of double-blind study treatment. 
Following the conclusion of Part B, all safety data will be analyzed and summarized. 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary. The 
incidence of each treatment-emergent AE will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and 
treatment assignment. Multiple AEs mapped to the same preferred term will be counted once per subject. 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary with 
generic term and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code and summarized by [CONTACT_157840], WHO 
generic name, and treatment. Safety laboratory findings, vital signs, and 12-lead ECGs will be summarized 
descriptively and listed by [CONTACT_462613]. Values and changes from baseline at scheduled 
time points will be summarized. Laboratory data will be listed and values and changes from baseline at each 
visit will be summarized. An additional listing of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities will be 
provided. 
Blinding for Part A and Part B 
Analys
is for Part A will be performed by a team within an independent data reporting center who will be 
unblinded after the last enrolled subject in Part A has completed [ADDRESS_592303] level 
CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462570] A team; however, the aggregated 
overall summary without treatment group information may be available to the Sponsor Part A team. 
A separate Part B team within the independent data reporting center will remain blinded to Part A subject level 
data prior to and following unblinding of Part A. 
Blinding to individual subject treatment allocation will be maintained for the subjects, Investigators, Clinical 
Events Committee (CEC), and Sponsor designated site monitoring personnel throughout the study to 
completion. The operational details of maintaining the blind and data access will be described and the process 
will be governed by a Data Access Management Plan.

1.1. Back
ground 
Acoramidis is a potent and selective stabilizer of transthyretin (TTR) that is being developed by 
[CONTACT_462614], Inc. for the treatment of TTR amyloidosis (ATTR), a progressive, fatal 
disease in which deposition of amyloid derived from either mutant or wild-type TTR causes 
severe organ damage and dysfunction. 
Clinically, ATTR presents as either a cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM), an infiltrative, restrictive 
cardiomyopathy characterized by [CONTACT_462615], or as a peripheral 
polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN), a length-dependent neurodegenerative disease affecting 
sensorimotor and autonomic functions. 
Familial ATTR-CM (ATTRm-CM), or FAC, and familial ATTR-PN or familial amyloid 
polyneuropathy (FAP), are driven by [CONTACT_462616]; over [ADDRESS_592315] been described. In addition, older individuals may develop ATTR derived from 
wild-type TTR (ATTRwt, formerly called Senile Systemic Amyloidosis [SSA]). In ATTRwt, the 
major organ involved is the heart (ATTRwt- CM), although carpal tunnel syndrome and tendon 
involvement are also common. 
Destabilization, misfolding, and aggregation of TTR lead to deposition of TTR amyloid and 
tissue damage. Several small molecules have been shown to bind to and stabilize TTR, 
potentially preventin g the initiating event in amyloidogenesis. Eidos’ therapeutic hypothesis is 
that a highly effective TTR stabilizer will halt or slow ATTR disease progression in ATTR-CM 
(both mutant ATTR [ATTRm] and ATTRwt) and ATTR-PN. 
Acoramidis is a potent, highly selective, small molecule TTR stabilizer. It has demonstrated 
ability to stabilize TTR in vivo following oral dosing to nonhuman mammals, in healthy 
volunteers and in patients with ATTR- CM. 
1.2. Clinical Benefit-Risk Assessment of Acoramidis 
ATTR-CM is a serious, progressive, and life-threatening disease associated with either wild-type 
TTR or, in the familial form of the disease, with pathogenic mutations in the TTR gene. While 
such loss-of-function mutations may accelerate the development and progression of ATTR-CM, 
age-related dissociation of the destabilized, native tetrameric form of the protein is the initiating 
pathophysiological event. The degree to which individual mutations promote destabilization of 
the tetramer is associated with a higher degree of penetrance, an earlier onset of symptoms, 
and/or a more aggressive and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_462571]. 
Dissociation of tetrameric TTR into intrinsically unstable monomeric TTR favors misfolding and 
aggregation into amyloidogenic precursors, which can form amyloid fibrils that are deposited in 
affected tissues and organs, leading to local cytotoxicity and both architectural and functional 
disruption. Small molecule stabilizers like acoramidis reduce the likelihood of tetramer 
dissociation and this mechanism provides the therapeutic rationale supporting their use in halting 
or slowing progression of the disease. The preclinical data and clinical safety data collected to

Acoramidis (AG10 )  Protocol AG10-[ADDRESS_592316] shown that 
administration of acoramidis has demonstrat ed good tolerability with no safety signals of 
potential clinical concern at proposed therapeutic exposures ( Fox 2019 , Judge 2019 ).

3.1. Over
all Study Design and Plan: Description 
This prospective, Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study will evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of acoramidis in symptomatic subjects compared to placebo, administered on 
a background of stable heart failure therapy. Screening and randomization will be followed by a 
total of 30 months of blinded, placebo-controlled treatment. At the end of 12 months of treatment 
(Part A) , efficacy of acoramidis will be assessed through analyses of the functional (6MWT) and 
health-related QoL (as measured by [CONTACT_241426]-specific instrument KCCQ) endpoints (Terms KCCQ 
overall score and KCCQ overall summary score are interchangeably used in this document). At 
the end of 30 months of treatment (Part B), efficacy of acoramidis will be further assessed 
through analysis of All-cause mortality, cumulative frequency of CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
change from baseline in NT-proBNP, and change from baseline in 6MWT. 
Subjects are not allowed to be treated with any ATTR- CM specific therapy during the first 
[ADDRESS_592317] 12 months of the study, they will be asked to complete an early termination visit prior to 
discontinuation/withdrawal. 
If during participation in the study, tafamidis becomes available for the indication of ATTR-CM 
and subjects have access to it, subjects will be permitted to initiate therapy with tafamidis as a 
concomitant medication if they have completed at least [ADDRESS_592318] (IMP), discontinue or 
withdraw from the trial at any time, they will be asked to complete an early termination visit and 
associated procedures. If a subject chooses to initiate treatment with another therapy, including 
tafamidis in the first 12 months of the study, they will be asked to complete an ET visit and 
associated procedures prior to discontinuation/withdrawal . Subjects will continue monthly phone 
contact [CONTACT_462607] 30. All participating subjects will be asked to consent to determination of 
vital status (alive, death, heart transplant, receiving cardiac mechanical assist device [CMAD]) at 
Month 30, either via direct contact [CONTACT_462621], regardless of discontinuation or 
withdrawal status. Unless precluded by [CONTACT_462609], consent for determination of 
vital status through public records may not be withdrawn.  
All subjects who complete 30 months of blinded study therapy and the final assessments of the 
double-blind treatment period (Month 30 visit) may be eligible to participate in an Open-Label 
extension (OLE) study ( Study AG10-304, a separate protocol ) of long-term acoramidis 
treatment.

3.2. Discussion of Study Design and Rationale 
This prospective study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acoramidis in subjects 
with ATTR-CM, administered on a background of stable heart failure therapy. A randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled design is considered to be the most appropriate study design to 
meet this objective. On the basis of information gained from previous clinical experience with 
acoramidis, the dose of acoramidis HCl [ADDRESS_592320] Population and Stratification 
Approximately 510 males and females ≥  18 and ≤  90 years of age (at time of randomization ) 
with chronic, stable, symptomatic (NYHA Class I-III) ATTR-CM will be randomized in a 2:1 
ratio (340 subjects to active treatment, 170 to matching placebo) in the study. Subjects will be 
stratified at randomization based on whether they have ATTRwt- CM or ATTRm-CM with a 
target of 20% of subjects with ATTRm-CM. Subjects will also be stratified according to

idential  29  Note 1: If considered necessary, as per Investigator’s discretion, IMP may be 
interr
upted (e.g., in case of AE, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918]), however IMP 
should be resumed as soon as practically possible, unless there are safety 
concerns. Investigators are encouraged to discuss such cases with a Medical 
Monitor. 
 Note 2: If a subject prematurely discontinues from the IMP because of an AE, the 
study center personnel must record the AE as the reason for discontinuation. (An 
AE that occurs more than [ADDRESS_592329] dose of IMP is not considered a 
treatment-emergent adverse event [TEAE].) 
 Death 
 Protocol deviation(s) 
 If it is discovered after randomization that the subject did not meet protocol entry 
criteria, and continued participation would present unacceptable risk to subject’s 
health 
 Non-compliance with study treatment or protocol procedures 
 Subject’s decision to discontinue study drug or withdraw from the study assessments.  
 Withdraw of consent 
 Note 3: Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason without 
prejudice to future treatment. In the event of withdrawal of consent, the ET 
procedures should occur as a final visit. Note: All participating subjects will be 
asked to consent to determination of vital status (dead, alive, heart transplant, 
receiving CMAD) at Month 30, either via direct contact [CONTACT_462621], 
regardless of discontinuation or withdrawal status. Unless precluded by [CONTACT_462624], consent for determination of vital status may not be withdrawn.

Reason for permanent discontinuation of IMP (end of treatment) and/or withdrawal from the 
study will be recorded on the appropriate CRF(s). Investigator should evaluate the possible 
contribution of an adverse event to permanent discontinuation of IMP. In this case, adverse event 
information will be documented accordingly in the CRF. 
In subjects who permanently discontinued IMP, every effort should be made to continue monthly 
phone contacts for vital status for subjects who discontinue IMP for up to Month [ADDRESS_592332] withdraws 
from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the 
investigator must document this in the site study records. If allowed by [CONTACT_2371], samples that have 
already been collected may continue to be stored and used to meet legal and regulatory 
obligations. 
3.4.1. Lost to Follow-Up 
A subject will be considered lost to follow-up if he/she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298]. Before a subject is deemed lost to 
follow-up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_1155] 
(where possible, [ADDRESS_592333]’s last known 
mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_286650]’s medical record.  Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he/she may be 
considered to have withdrawn from the study. 
3.5. Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance 
Female subjects of childbearing potential who engage in heterosexual intercourse must agree to 
use a highly effective method of contraception ( CTFG guidance v.1.1 ) beginning with 
randomiza
tion and continuing for [ADDRESS_592334] dose of IMP as follows: 
 
Eidos Therapeutics Inc. Treatment of Symptomatic ATTR Cardiomyopathy 
Acoramidis (AG10 )  Protocol AG10-301 Amendment 6.0 
 
Conf
idential  31  If heterosexually active, must be using a highly effective method of birth control such 
as hormonal ora
l contraceptives, intravaginal hormonal contraceptive, contraceptive 
injections/implant, contraceptive patch, intrauterine device, or bilateral tubal 
occlusion before subject randomization and must agree to continue to use a highly 
effective method of birth control throughout the study and for [ADDRESS_592335] 
dose of IMP, consistent with local regulations regarding use of birth control methods 
for subjects participating in clinical studies. 
 Female subjects using oral contraceptives must agree to use an additional birth 
control method. 
 While not considered highly effective, a double-barrier method (e.g., condoms, 
diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicidal foam, cream, or gel) is acceptable. 
 Not heterosexually active (practices complete abstinence). Sexual abstinence is 
considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire study and for [ADDRESS_592336] is considered of childbearing potential (i.e., fertile), following menarche and 
until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods 
include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_15559]. A postmenopausal 
state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause and has to be 
confirmed with plasma follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). 
Subjects will be provided with information on method(s) of contraception acceptable for the 
study as a part of informed consent and will confirm that they understand the requirement to 
avoid pregnancy during the study and continuing for [ADDRESS_592337] dose of IMP.  
Pregnancy tests will be performed during the study according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix A ), and subjects will receive guidance on avoidance of pregnancy throughout the 
study. S
ubjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_462626]. Subjects who become pregnant during the study will be 
withdrawn from study therapy, and their pregnancy will be followed to term (Section 3.11.6) 
A male subje
ct who is sexually active with a female of childbearing potential and has not had a 
vasectomy must agree to use a double-barrier method of birth control such as a condom  with 
spermicidal foam/gel/cream. 
If a male subject’s partner becomes pregnant any time between the start of IMP and [ADDRESS_592338] date of the following: last visit 
of the last subject or the last vital status assessment of the last subject in the study globally. 
 
Eidos Therapeutics Inc. Treatment of Symptomatic ATTR Cardiomyopathy 
Acoramidis (AG10 )  Protocol AG10-[ADDRESS_592339] completed the double-blind treatment 
period including the Month 30 visit. 
3.7. Treatments 
3.7.1. Treatments Administered 
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria listed in Section 3.3 will be randomized in a 2:1 manner 
(ac
oramidis:placebo) to receive the following treatment arms in a double-blind fashion: 
 800 mg acoramidis hydrochloride (HCl) BID, orally (two 400 mg acoramidis HCl 
tablets (equivalent to 356 mg acoramidis), BID) 
 Matching placebo BID, orally (two matching placebo tablets, BID) 
3.7.2. Identity of Investigational Products 
Acoramidis HCl tablets (400 mg) and matching placebo tablets will be supplied by [CONTACT_462627], Inc. The excipi[INVESTIGATOR_462576] (400 mg) tablets or matching placebo 
tablets include microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, silicon dioxide, lactose 
monohydrate, and magnesium stearate, coated with Opadry. 
3.7.3. Packaging 
The IMP will be provided as blinded randomized kits assigned to subjects using a randomization 
code. The kits will be labeled as required by [CONTACT_462628]. 
Full details reg arding IMP packaging are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure and Pharmacy 
Manual. 
3.7.4. Storage, Dispensing, and Return of Investigational Product 
The Sponsor will provide the study center with IMP supplies. Full details regarding IMP storage 
are provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
The site research pharmacist or delegated personnel will maintain an accurate record of the 
receipt of the IMP shipped by [CONTACT_1034], including the date and quantity received. In addition, 
an accurate drug accountability record will be kept that specifies the amount of IMP, date 
dispensed to each subject, amount of IMP, and date returned by [CONTACT_423]. This inventory 
record must be available for inspection at any time, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_462577]. 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that subjects return their unused IMP at each visit. 
All unused IMP must be returned to the Sponsor or destroyed on-site throughout the course of 
the study after IMP accountability is completed and with approval by [CONTACT_1034]. If unused IMP 
 
Eidos Therapeutics Inc. Treatment of Symptomatic ATTR Cardiomyopathy 
Acoramidis (AG10 )  Protocol AG10-[ADDRESS_592340] be provided to the 
Sponsor. 
3.7.5. M
ethod of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Screening numbers will be assigned consecutively (e.g., 1, 2, 3,…) through an Interactive Web 
Response System (IW RS) portal after the subject signs the ICF. Subjects who meet eligibility 
criteria will be randomized using permuted blocks into the study and assigned a unique subject 
number through the IW RS. Subjects will be stratified at randomization based on whether they 
have ATTRm-CM or ATTRwt-CM with a targeted minimum of 20% of subjects with 
ATTRm-CM. Subjects will also be stratified according to NT- proBNP level (≤  3000 vs 
> 3000 pg/mL) and renal function defined by [CONTACT_67889] (≥  45 vs < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2) at Screening. 
3.7.6. Selection of Dosages in the Study 
The acoramidis HCl dose of [ADDRESS_592341]- in-human, single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose 
(MAD) Study AG10-001 conducted in healthy adult volunteers, and the Phase 2, repeat dose, 
dose-ranging, safety, tolerability, PK and PD Study AG10-201 in ATTR-CM subjects with 
NYHA Class II-III heart failure. Further details on these studies can be found in the acoramidis 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
3.7.7. Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject 
Dosing should be administered BID, once in the morning and once in the evening. Acoramidis 
can be taken with or without food. Additional information on dosing instructions can be found in 
the study Pharmacy Manual. 
3.7.8. Blinding 
Blinding of study treatment is critical to the integrity of this clinical trial and every effort will be 
made to protect the blind. If a subject’s treatment assignment is disclosed to the Investigator, the 
subject will have study treatment discontinued (Section 3.4). The Sponsor or a designated safety 
repre
sentative may independently unblind cases for expedited reporting of suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs). 
However, regardless of any unblinding, accidental or due to Investigator request in the context of 
an AE, all subjects will be followed until study completion unless consent to do so is specifically 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_423] (see Section 3.4).  Note: all participating subjects will be asked to 
conse
nt to determination of vital status (e.g., alive, death, heart transplant, receiving CMAD) at 
Month 30, either via direct contact [CONTACT_462621], regardless of discontinuation or 
withdrawal status. Unless precluded by [CONTACT_462609], consent for determination of 
vital status through public records may not be withdrawn. 
Blinding for Part A and Part B 
Analysis for Part A will be performed by a team within an independent data reporting center who 
will be unblinded after the last enrolled subject in Part A has completed [ADDRESS_592342] level CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462570] A team; 
 
Eidos Therapeutics Inc. Treatment of Symptomatic ATTR Cardiomyopathy 
Acoramidis (AG10 )  Protocol AG10-[ADDRESS_592343] treatment allocation will be maintained for the subjects, 
Investigators, Clinical Events Committee (CEC), and Sponsor designated site monitoring 
personnel throughout the study to  completion. The operational details of maintaining the blind 
and data access will be described and the process will be governed by a Data Access 
Management Plan. 
3.7.9. Emergency Unblinding 
Unblinding by [CONTACT_462629]. In this situation, the decision to unblind a subject’s 
treatment assignment rests with the Investigator who has access to IW RS treatment assignment. 
The Investigator should attempt to contact [CONTACT_1689] (or designee) to discuss options 
prior to unblinding, unless the urgency of the subject’s medical situation prevents this. Detailed 
instructions for IMP unblinding will be provided in a Study Procedures Manual. In the event of 
emergency unblinding of a subject’s IMP assignment, a full written explanation of events 
requiring IMP unblinding should be provided to the Medical Monitor within [ADDRESS_592344] the medication, dosage, and duration of use in the 
appropriate CRF. 
3.7.11. Prohibited Medications 
 Use of patisiran, inotersen, tafamidis (see Note below) or any other approved or 
investigational agent for the treatment of ATTR- CM is prohibited during the study.  
 Use of marketed drug products lacking a labeled indication for ATTR-CM (e.g., 
diflunisal, doxycycline) or of natural products or derivatives used as unproven 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_61263]-CM (e.g., green tea extract, tauroursodeoxycholic acid 
[TUDCA]/ursodiol) is prohibited. 
 Use of calcium channel blockers with conduction system effects (e.g., verapamil, 
diltiazem) is prohibited. Use of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers is allowed. 
The use of digitalis will only be allowed if required for management of atrial 
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 
Note: If, during participation in the study, tafamidis becomes availabl e for the indication of 
ATTR-CM and subjects have access to it, subjects will be permitted to initiate therapy with 
tafamidis as a concomitant medication if they have completed at least 12 months of blinded 
study therapy. (Currently, tafamidis is approved for the treatment of ATTR-CM in some 
regions.) Subjects initiating therapy with tafamidis indicated for ATTR-CM must have

be eligible for participation. 
If the subject has a need for a walking aid (e.g., cane) or supplemental oxygen at baseline, it must 
be used consistently at each subsequent 6MWT throughout the study. If a subject develops a 
need for a walking  aid (e.g., cane) or supplemental oxygen after baseline, it must be used 
consistently at each subsequent 6MWT throughout the study. 
The 6MWT should be conduc
ted after completion of the KCCQ and EQ- 5D-5L at the visits 
where required. 
The 6MWT with Borg Scale will be conducted based on the guidelines of the American Thoracic 
Society with appropriate modifications for the subject population. Complete details on the 
procedures for the 6MWT are provided in a Study Procedures Manual.

5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression) 
with each dimension having five levels of function (1-no problem, 2-slight problem, 3-moderate 
problem, 4-severe problem, and 5-extreme problem). The second part is a respondent ’s self-
rating of current health status on a EuroQol-Visual Analog Scale (EQ VAS) with endpoints 
labeled “best imaginable health state” (score of 100) and “worst imaginable health state” (score 
of 0). The scores from the 5 dimensions may be used to calculate a single index value, also 
known as a utility score. Complete details administration and scoring are provided in a Study

Acoramidis (AG10 )  Protocol AG10-[ADDRESS_592361] a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product (I CH E2A ). 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to document all AEs that occur during the study. AEs 
should be elicited by [CONTACT_63397] a nonleading question (e.g., “Have you experienced any 
new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since you r last visit?”). AEs will be reported on 
the AE CRF. 
For the purpose of data collection for this study, any untoward event that is reported from the 
time that the subject signs the ICF until [ADDRESS_592362] dose of IMP is to be considered an 
AE (refer to Section 3.11.5  or further details). 
Example
s of AEs are as follows: 
 Changes in the general condition of the subject that represents a decline in health or 
functional status 
 Symptoms offered by [CONTACT_303406] 
 Objective signs observed by [CONTACT_62244] 
 All diseases that occur after the start of the study, including a worsening, excluding 
minor fluctuations, in the nature, severity, frequency, or duration of a pre-existing 
condition. Any medical condition present at Screening and which does not deteriorate 
should not be reported as an AE. However, any pre-existing medical condition that 
deteriorates during the study should be reported as an AE. 
An AE does not include: 
 A medical or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or 
transfusion); an AE is the underlying condition that leads to the procedure 
 Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected before start of IMP 
administration that do not worsen or increase in severity or frequency after the 
administration of IMP

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462582] a condition that has not worsened on study, 
social and/or convenience admissions to grant families a respi[INVESTIGATOR_22216] a 
patient) 
 Overdose of either IMP or concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms 
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis will be documented as the AE and 
not the individual signs/symptoms. If a diagnosis is not available, the sign/symptom may be 
reported as the AE. 
All clinically relevant abnormalities in laboratory values or clinically relevant physical findings 
that occur during the study should be reported as an AE. A clinically relevant laboratory value or 
physical finding is one associated with signs and symptoms and/or requires medical intervention. 
3.11.2. Causality Assessment 
The Investigator must assess the relationship of the event to the IMP. The causal relationship of 
the AE is assessed using a binary system, and AEs are classified as either ‘ Related’  or 
‘Not R elated’  as defined below. 
Related : The available evidence suggests the adverse event is most likely due to the IMP. For 
example, a temporal relationship exists between the AE onset and administration of the IMP that 
cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_46897]’s clinical state, concurrent disease or concomitant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Not related : The available evidence suggests the adverse event is most likely related to factors 
other than the administration of the IMP. Such other factors may include the underlying disease 
state, comorbidities, an intercurrent illness, concomitant medication(s) or procedures. 
The causality assessment evaluates the likelihood that the event was caused by [CONTACT_33641], the 
underlying disease, comorbidities, intercurrent illness or other factors, and determines which 
factor is the most likely cause of the event. Causality assessment is not an assessment of whether 
or not the study drug can be ruled out. 
The Investigator must assess and report the relationship of an SAE to the IMP within [ADDRESS_592363]’s CRF. Severity , which is a description 
of the intensity of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from seriousness , which implies a subject

idential  46 outcome or AE-required treatment measure associated with a threat to life or functionality. 
Severit
y will be assessed according to the following scale: 
Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily 
living. 
Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but 
poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject. 
Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 
3.11.4. Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 Results in death 
 Is life threatening; i.e., in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the AE places the subject at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; it does not include a reaction 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
 Results in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
 Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
Emergency room visits that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462583]. 
Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (e.g., elective procedures for preexisting conditions that did not 
worsen) are excluded from SAE reporting. 
Note that death is an outcome of an AE and not an AE in itself. The event that was the proximate 
cause of death should be reported as the AE term. 
3.11.5. Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Any untoward event that is reported from the time that the subject signs the ICF until [ADDRESS_592364] medical occurrences or 
unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms, or diseases that occur in the pretreatment,

Subjects are to be queried regarding any AEs or SAEs at the time of each vital sign assessment, 
as well as at each visit, according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix A ). Subjects will be 
asked to voluntee
r information with a nonleading question such as, “How do you feel?” Study 
center personnel will then record all pe rtinent information in the subject’s CRF . 
All AEs and SAEs reported by [CONTACT_423] (or subject representative) or observed or otherwise 
identified by [CONTACT_737] (or other study center personnel) at a defined study visit or during 
any communication with the subject (or subject representative) occurring outside a defined study 
visit (from the time the subject signs the ICF to [ADDRESS_592365] dose of IMP) must be 
documented. 
All AEs must be recorded on the appropriate AE reporting page of the subject’s CRF whether or 
not they are considered causally related to the IMP. 
For every AE, the Investigator must: 
 Provide an assessment of the severity, causal relationship to the IMP, and seriousness 
of the event (i.e., whether it is an SAE) 
 Document all actions taken with regard to the IMP 
 Detail any other treatment measures taken for the AE 
 Document outcome of the AE (with or without sequelae); ongoing; or lost to 
follow-up. 
3.11.6. Reporting of Pregnancies Occurring During the Study 
Study center personnel must report every pregnancy from the time a female subject signs the ICF 
until [ADDRESS_592366] be followed to term and the outcome reported by [CONTACT_12550] a follow-up 
Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form. If the pregnancy is associated with an SAE (e.g., if the female 
subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143460]), a separate SAE Form must be completed (in addition to 
the Pregnancy Form) as described in Section 3.11.6 , with the appropriate serious criterion 
(e.g.,

In this study, CMAD and heart transplant are included in the “All -cause mortality” component of 
the primary endpoint for Part B, and therefore should be collected for all randomized patients 
even if they discontinued treatment permanently or withdrew consent (see also Section 3.4). 
CMAD
 is defined as a durable CMAD implanted in a patient with end-stage heart failure as a 
bridge to transplant or as a destination therapy. Temporary cardiac mechanical support (i.e., 
those interventions that can only be employed in the inpatient setting, e.g., Intra-Aortic Balloon 
Pump [IABP], Impella, or Extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) are not considered 
CMAD. In addition, other cardiac interventions such as pacemaker, implantable cardioverter 
defibrillator (ICD), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI), coronary artery by[CONTACT_4897] (CABG), valvular percutaneous intervention or surgery are 
not considered CMAD. 
A CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] a non-elective admission to an acute care setting for 
CV-related morbidity that results in ≥ 24 hours stay (or a date change if the time of 
admission/discharge is not available).

ca
re clinic, day clinic, etc.) of < 24 hours where diagnosis and interventions indicate that the 
purpose of the visit was for intravenous diuretic therapy for management of decompensated heart 
failure. EOCI are considered as part of the efficacy endpoint of Part B CV -related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring potential study endpoints, including dates of 
admissions and discharge, are collected and well documented for adjudication purposes (this 
includes but is not limited to: admission notes describing signs and symptoms, cardiology or 
other relevant clinical notes, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458]); for providing Investigator assessment

Acoramidis (AG10 )  Protocol AG10-[ADDRESS_592372] for randomization stratification factors. Adjustments for additional 
covariates, if 
any, will be mentioned separately for different endpoints. 
3.13.2. Determination of Sample Size 
The primary analysis population will include subjects with baseline eGFR ≥  30 mL/min/1.73 m2 
(i.e., subjects with baseline eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 will be excluded from the primary 
analysis population). It is estimated that approximately 10% of subjects wi ll have baseline eGFR 
< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Sample size calculations are based on two-sided alphas = 0.01 for Part A 
and 0.04 for Part B.  
Part A: 
The primary endpoint of Part A is the change from baseline in the distance achieved in the 
6MWT following
 12 months of double-blind study treatment.  
The sample size calculation for the primary endpoint in Part A is based on the following 
assumptions: two-sided alpha = 0.01, power = 0.9, normally distributed data per group, equal 
within group standard deviations. Based on the ATTR-ACT study ( Maurer 2018 ), it is estimated 
that the between 
group mean change from baseline is [ADDRESS_592373], a total sample size of 
approximately 365 subjects will provide 90% power to reject the null hypothesis of no mean 
difference between groups. To allow for the possibility that approximately 20% of subjects may 
not complete the Month 12 6MWT, and that approximately 10% of subjects will have baseline 
eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 the adjusted sample size is approximately 510 subjects 
(340 allocated to acoramidis and 170 allocated to placebo). 
Part B: 
The power for Part B was originally estimated based on the primary endpoint of a hierarchical 
combinati
on of All-cause mortality and CV -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149701] a 30-month treatment 
period. The test statistic for the combined endpoint is Finkelstein and Schoenfeld’s ( Finkelstein 
1999) adaptation of the generalized Gehan Wilcoxon test (and will be referred to as the 
Finkelstein
-Schoenfeld test). Simulations based on estimates of mortality and CV-related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462567]-ACT result in greater than 90% power with two-sided alpha = 0.04 
with total N = 460 (=  0.9*510, i.e., after excluding 10% of subjects with baseline eGFR 
< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) for the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld test to reject the null hypothesis that 
neither All-cause mortality nor CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462587]. Simulations assumed an All-cause mortality rate of 40% for placebo with a hazard ratio 
of 0.7, mean number of CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462569] 30 of 1.15 and 0.75 in the placebo 
and acoramidis groups, respectively.  
The primary endpoint is a hierarchical combination of All-cause mortality, cumulative frequency 
of CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], change from baseline in NT-proBNP, and change from baseline in 
6MWT over a 30-month fixed treatment duration.  
The number of subjects who will initiate, and when they will initiate, tafamidis after Month 12 is 
unknown and is not possible to estimate with any precision. Simulations to assess power for the 
four-component hierarchical endpoint (All-cause mortality, cumulative frequency of CV-related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], change from baseline in NT-proBNP, and change from baseline in 6MWT) were

Conf
idential  54 conducted under various scenarios taking into consideration potential tafamidis use and 
potentially  missing da
ta. The estimated power across the various scenarios remains above 80%. 
3.13.3. Timing of Analyses 
Part A analyses will occur following the last subject completing the Month [ADDRESS_592374] been completed for all 
subjects and all data is entered, the database will be cleaned and locked, randomized treatment 
assignments will be obtained, and safety analyses will be performed. 
3.13.4. Analysis Sets and Analysis Conventions 
The modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population will be primary for efficacy endpoints. The ITT 
population is defined as all randomized subjects who have received at least one dose of IMP and 
have at least one post baseline efficacy evaluation. The modified ITT (mITT) population will 
exclude subjects with baseline eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. For both Parts A and B, the primary 
efficacy analysis will be performed on the mITT population. The per-protocol (PP) population 
will be secondary for the primary and key secondary endpoints. The PP population will include 
all subjects from the mITT set who did not have one of a pre-defined list of important protocol 
deviations. The list of subjects with one of these important protocol deviations will be identified 
prior to unblinding the Part A and Part B, respectively. For safety, the analysis population will 
include all subjects who received at least one dose of IMP. 
Unless otherwise specified, baseline values are defined as the last measurement obtained before 
the first dose of IMP. 
3.13.5. Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148]. 
3.13.6. Extent of Exposure and Treatment Compliance 
The Investigator must maintain exact records of the amount of IMP dispensed to each subject by 
[CONTACT_462636]: 
 Subject randomization number 
 Date(s) and visit number when IMP was dispensed 
 Amount of IMP dispensed 
 Date of return of IMP 
 Amount of IMP returned 
An accountability log will be maintained at the study site to record IMP compliance for each 
subject. 
Additional details about IMP dispensing can be found in the study specific Pharmacy Manual. 
3.13.7. Efficacy Analyses 
The alpha for Part A is 0.01 and 0.04 for Part B.

(MMRM). The model will include terms for randomization stratification factors, treatment, time, 
treatment by [CONTACT_6491]. An unstructured variance- covariance model will be used. 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
The key secondary endpoint will be analyzed similarly. The secondary endpoint of change from 
baseline in TTR level will also be analyzed similarly at Month 12. To control alpha, KCCQ-OS 
and change from baseline in TTR level will be formally tested sequentially in this order at 
significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_592375].  
Part B 
Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary analysis will use a hierarchical combination of the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method 
(Finkelstein 1999 ) applied to All-cause mortality, cumulative frequency of CV-related 
hospi
[INVESTIGATOR_059], change from baseline in NT-proBNP, and change from baseline in 6MWT at the 
last available visit over the 30-month fixed treatment duration. In this study, “All -cause 
mortality” includes death due to any cause, heart transplant, or CMAD (see Section 3.11.12). 
The test is
 based on the principle that each subject is compared to every other subject in each 
stratum in a pair-wise manner. The hierarchical approach recognizes the greater importance of 
the mortality endpoint. Vital status data (dead, alive, heart transplant, receiving CMAD) will be 
obtained for subjects who discontinue from the IMP and or/study procedures prior to Month [ADDRESS_592376] or through public records, regardless of discontinuation or withdrawal 
status. Unless precluded by [CONTACT_462609], consent for determination of vital status 
may not be withdrawn (Section 3.4) For CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], change from baseline in 
NT-pro
BNP, and change from baseline in 6MWT, missing data will not be imputed for the 
Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method. 
The null hypothesis is that all of the four components of All-cause mortality, cumulative 
frequency of CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], change from baseline in NT-proBNP, and change from 
baseline in 6MWT are the same between placebo and acoramidis groups. Rejection of the null 
hypothesis implies that at least one of the four components of the primary endpoint is different 
between the treatment groups. 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
The key secondary endpoints adjusted for alpha are: 
a. Change from baseline to Month 30 in the distance walked during the 6MWT 
b. Change from baseline to Month 30 on the KCCQ- OS 
c. Change from baseline to Month 30 in serum TTR level

or CMAD
 
To control alpha at the 0.04 level, the key secondary endpoints will be formally tested 
sequentially in the order shown above if the primary endpoint is statistically significant at the 
0.04 level. Change from baseline in 6MWT, KCCQ-OS and serum TTR level will be analyzed 
using an MMRM with an unstructured covariance matrix. The model will include additional 
terms for randomization stratification factors, visit, and treatment by [CONTACT_23259]. The time to 
All-Cause mortality will be analyzed using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model that 
includes treatment as an explanatory factor along with baseline 6MWT. 
Additional secondary endpoints (not adjusted for alpha) include: 
 A hierarchical combination of All-cause mortality and cumulative frequency of CV-
related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_308998] a 30-month fixed treatment duration 
 A hierarchical combination of All-Cause mortality, cumulative frequency of CV-
related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and change from baseline in 6MWT over a 30-month fixed 
treatment duration 
 Change in NT-proBNP from baseline to Month 30 of treatment  
 Cumulative frequency of CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462562] 30 
 CV mortality by [CONTACT_43380] 30 
 TTR  stabilization measured in established ex-vivo assays (FPE and Western blot) in

TTR  stabilization measured in established ex-vivo assays (FPE and Western blot) in the PK-PD 
substudy. The components of the combined endpoint will also be analyzed separately. Mortality 
will be analyzed by [CONTACT_462637]-Haenszel test. All-cause mortality will also be analyzed by a Cox 
regression model adjusting for stratification factors. Similar analyses will be performed for CV 
mortality. 
The cumulative frequency of CV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462588] : (a) negative 
binomial regression. An offset term will be included. The offset will be the log of each subject’s 
study duration; (b) Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel row means scores tests. 
Subgroups 
Subgroup analyses will be conducted for randomization stratification factors for the primary 
endpoint, the components of the primary endpoint, and for the key secondary endpoints. 
Missing Data 
Following the conclusion of Part A and Part B, sensitivity and supplementary analyses will be 
conducted with adjustments for missing data. Imputation details on handling of missing data will 
be described in the SAP.

Eidos Therapeutics Inc. Treatment of Symptomatic ATTR Cardiomyopathy 
AG10 (Acoramidis) Protocol AG10-[ADDRESS_592386] of the Study 
The trial will be conducted in accordance with the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, US Title 21 CFR Parts 11, 50, 54, 56, and 312; the EU 
Clinical Trials Directive (and Clinical Trial Regulation when in effect); principles enunciated in 
the Declaration of Helsinki; and all human clinical research regulations of the countries where 
the trial is conducted. 
The Investigator(s) and the Sponsor will sign the protocol and study contract, to confirm 
agreement. The Investigator(s) will not implement any amendment (deviation or changes of the 
protocol) without agreement by [CONTACT_299524]/IEC approval, except where necessary to 
eliminate immediate hazard(s) to study subjects, or when change(s) involve only logistical o r 
administrative aspects of the study. 
Protocol deviations will only be recognized and assessed for ethical, medical, scientific, and 
regulatory implications and for impact on the subject’s participation in the study and will  be 
documented. 
Records that may reveal the identities of subjects must be well protected, with consideration 
given to confidentiality and the right to privacy of subjects. 
Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain the approval of the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) before the start of the study. During the course of 
the study, the Investigator will provide timely and accurate reports to the IRB/IEC on the 
progress of the study at appropriate intervals not to exceed 1 year and at the completion of the 
study. The Investigator will notify the IRB/IEC of serious adverse events (SAEs) or other 
significant safety findings if appropriate according to local requirements. The study protocol and 
amendments, informed consent form (ICF), information sheet, advertisements, will be approved 
by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC at each study center in conformance with requirements of the controlling 
regulatory authority. 
Subject Information and Consent 
At screening, the subject will read the ICF and after being given an explanation of the study. 
Before signing the ICF and the HIPAA form (if applicable), subjects will have an opportunity to 
discuss the contents of these forms with study center personnel. Subjects must assent 
understanding of and voluntarily sign these forms. Subjects wi ll be made aware that they may 
withdraw from the study at any time. 
The ICF contains all the elements of informed consent listed in this protocol. Signed copi[INVESTIGATOR_462590], and both documents will be placed in the Investigator’ s 
study files. The Sponsor will review the ICF before it is submitted to the IRB/IEC. 
  
Eidos Therapeutics Inc. Treatment of Symptomatic ATTR Cardiomyopathy 
AG10 (Acoramidis) Protocol AG10-[ADDRESS_592387] is dosed in the study, a representative of the Sponsor will meet with the 
Investigator and the Investigato r’s personnel to review the procedures for conducting the study 
and to train the personnel on recording the data on the CRFs using the electronic data capture 
(EDC) system. The Sponsor representative will periodically monitor the progress of the study by 
[CONTACT_143505]-site visits thereafter. The Sponsor representative will also be able to review query 
statuses remotely, which may warrant more frequent communication with the Investigator and 
his or her personnel. The Investigator will make available to the Sponsor representative the 
source documents, the signed consent forms, and all other study-related documents. The 
Investigator will be responsible for reviewing CRFs, resolving data queries generated by [CONTACT_462639], providing missing or corrected data, approving all 
changes performed on the data, and endorsing the subject data within the EDC system. This 
approval method will include applying an electronic signature, a uniquely assigned username [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 
a password that together will represent a traditional handwritten signature. 
Data Audit 
Members of the Sponsor Quality Assurance department or designee may conduct an audit of a 
clinical site at any time before, during, or after completion of the study. The Investigator will be 
informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit. Representatives of 
the FDA or other Regulatory Agencies may also conduct an inspection of the study. If informed 
of such an inspection, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor immediately. The Investigator 
will ensure that the auditors have access to the study site facilities, investigational products, 
original source documentation, and all study files. 
Data Recording and Documentation 
Data collection will involve the use of an EDC system, to which only authorized personnel will 
have access. In addition to periodic monitoring occurring within the system by [CONTACT_462640]/or authorized Sponsor representatives, programmatic edit checks will be used to 
review the data for completeness, logic, and adherence to study protocol. As a result of this 
monitoring and these checks, queries may be issued electronically to the clinical study center and 
answered electronically by [CONTACT_116010]. The identifying information (assigned username, 
date, and time) for both the originator of the query (if created during the monitoring process) and 
the originator of the data change (if applicable), as well as the Investigator’s approval of all 
changes performed on his or her subjects ’ data, wil l be collected. 
All data collected in the context of this study will be stored and evaluated according to regulatory 
requirements and applicable guidance for electronic records. Data will be stored and evaluated in 
such a way as to guarantee subject confidentiality in accordance with the legal stipulations 
applying to confidentiality of data. Study records (e.g., copi[INVESTIGATOR_3110], regulatory documents) 
will be retained at the study center, along with adequate source documentation, according to 
local regulatory requirements and ICH requirements. All study records must be available for 
inspection by [CONTACT_1034], its authorized representatives, and regulatory officials.

 For AEs, added “Note 1: If considered 
necessary, as per Investigator’s 
discretion, IMP may be interrupted 
(e.g., in case of AE, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_462598]), however IMP should be 
resumed as soon as practically 
possible, unless there are safety 
concerns. Investigators are encouraged 
to discuss such cases with a Medical 
Monitor. ”

cause mortality” component of the 
primary endpoint for Part B, and 
therefore should be collected for all 
randomized patients even if they 
discontinued treatment permanently or 
withdrew consent (see also Section 
3.4). CMAD is defined as a durable 
CMAD implanted in a patient with 
end-stage heart failure as a bridge to 
transplant or as a destination therapy. 
Temporary cardiac mechanical support 
(i.e., those interventions that can only 
be employed in the inpatient setting, 
e.g., Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump 
[IABP], Impella, or Extra-corporeal 
membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) are 
not considered CMAD. In addition, 
other cardiac interventions such as 
pacemaker, implantable cardioverter 
defibrillator (ICD), cardiac 
resynchronization therapy (CRT), 
percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI), coronary artery by[CONTACT_4897]

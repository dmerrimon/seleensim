 2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Background  
Obesity  
Obesity is a chronic disease with a multifactorial etiology including behavioral , environmental, 
sociocultural, physiological and genetic factors. obesity and its consequences  are an increasing 
burden globally . Obes e, defined as a BMI>3 0 kg/m2, is an established risk factor for a number of 
diseases such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer s, diabetes type 2, and many others  
(Guh DP et al. 2009 ). Currently, there are an estimated 600 million obese people wo rldwide 
(Collaborators GBDO et al. 2017 ). BMI data shows that about 40% of American adults are obese  
(Hruby A and Hu FB 2015 ), while worldwide, about 3.4 million annual deaths are directly 
attributed to obesity  (Collaborators GBDO et al. 2017 ).  
The treatment of obesity involves lifestyle changes, bariatric surgery and pharmacotherapy (Bray 
GA et al. 2016 ). Lifestyle change, including diet and exercise, requires considerable patient 
commitment, and has poor complian ce. Surgery is expensive and invasive. Pharmacotherapy, 
therefore, is the primary option for the majority of patients. A variety of drugs are designed to 
prevent food absorption, decrease appetite, or increase metabolism. Compared to controls, most 
drugs c ause weight loss of <4 kg with substantial severe adverse events (Rosa -Goncalves P and 
Majerowicz D 2019 ). Some of the adverse events have cau sed withdrawal of a number of drugs 
from the market in several countries (Rodgers RJ 2017 ). As a result, a significant portion of obese 
patients have no treatment options due to adverse events and limit ed weight loss. Taken together, 
obesity remains an unmet medical need and development of new compounds that are safe and 
effective is paramount.  
Denatonium  
Denatonium is one of the bitterest tastants  among tens of thousands of natural or synthesized bitter 
compounds, with a bitterness detection threshold of 0.05 ppm. To date, one of the denatonium 
salts, denatonium benzoate has been approved as an additive to household products  to prevent the 
ingestion of potentially harmful substances through taste aversi on (Sibert JR and Frude N 1991 ). 
Importantly, the US Consumer Product  Safety Commission has judged  denatonium benzoate as 
generally safe.  Like other bitter compounds, denatonium can strongly activate  up to [ADDRESS_1208671] -201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page 20 of 66 09 May 2022 
 mouth elicits a familia r aversive sensation,  while  activation of b itter receptors  in the gut and 
chemoreceptor trigger zone located in the m edulla leads to  reduction of appetite and delayed  
gastric emptying as well as other adaptations. In a number of animal studies, denatonium benzoate 
has been shown to inhibit ongoing ingestive behavior , suppress food intake, and inhibit gastric 
emptying (Janssen S et al. 2011; Schier LA et al. 2011 ). Moreover, denatonium benzoate can 
stimulate the release of GLP -1 and CCK that are known to cause satiety and satiation (Chen MC 
et al. 2006; Kim KS et al. 2014 ). In human studies, the intragastric administration of denatonium 
benzoate after a liquid  meal has been reported to inhibit relaxation of the proximal stomach. While 
in an oral nutrient tolerance test, denatonium benzoate was shown to increase satiation (Avau B et 
al. 2015 ). In a clinical trial conducted in healthy female volunteers, intragastric administration of 
denatonium b enzoate is shown to decrease both antral motility and hunger ratings during the 
fasting state, probably via inhibiting motilin release. More importantly, no adverse reactions have 
been reported in all these human studies (Deloose E et al. 2017 ). Taken together, intragastric 
administration of denatonium salts is safe and can lead to weight los s by [CONTACT_866334], are promising agents for the treatment of obesity.  
Rationale of the Study  
ARD -[ADDRESS_1208672] -101 is minimally absorbed into the circulation through the GI epi[INVESTIGATOR_866308] -2 cell monolayer 
permeability assay ( Table 2).

mg/kg /day in a GLP -compliant pi[INVESTIGATOR_866309].   As with any 
new drug, rare or unexpected side effects could occur. The ARD -[ADDRESS_1208675] been shown to be well -tolerated when administered p.o. (orally)  
with no reported adverse reaction (Deloose E et al. 2017 ). Taken together, denatonium salt  is safe 
and well -tolerated when administered  p.o. in humans.  
ARD -[ADDRESS_1208676] -101 exhibited significant attenuation of weight gain (compared to

 Further,  previous studies, i.g. (intragastric) administration of denatonium  helped in  mitigat ion of 
chronic  and acute  inflammation  in multiple  preclinical  models,  characterized  by [CONTACT_866335],  downregulation  of inflammatory  cytokines  (such  as IL-6, TNF,  IL-1β, etc.). Benefits  
were  also observed  with regards  to cholesterol  levels,  HbA1c  and other  metabolic  markers.  
In a 48-week  study  of diet-induced  NASH  in mice , dosing  with ARD -[ADDRESS_1208679] -101 binding to 27 receptors (including subtypes of monoaminergic, cannabinoid, 
histaminic, nicotinic, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], and glucocorticoid receptors), 3 transporters, 8 ion channels, and 
6 enzymes. Results from 2 assays, α1A  adrenergic receptor and hERG potassium ion channel 
assays, revealed an inhibition or stimulation higher than 50%, denoting a significant effect of 
ARD -[ADDRESS_1208680] -101 was characterized in a panel of  in vitro  and in vivo  studies, including  
plasma protein binding assay s, permeability assays, metabolic stability  and metabolite 
identification assessment s, Cytochrome 450  (CYP450 ) phenotype assays , in vitro  drug-drug 
interaction studies on CYP450s , and serum/plasma toxicokinetic  studies in Cynomolgus monkey s.  
In the Caco -[ADDRESS_1208681] -101 i n the api[INVESTIGATOR_866310] 
0.378×10-6 cm/s . In addition, ARD -[ADDRESS_1208682] -101 was administrated p.o. at 
0.49, 1.62, or 4.85 mg/kg (denatonium base weight). After a 14 -day washout period, an intravenous 
(i.v.) administration of ARD -[ADDRESS_1208683] -101 at 0.49, 1.62 , and 4.85  mg/kg to Cynomolgus monkey s, 
the C max and AUC 0-48h were 129, 803, 2270 ng/mL  and 270, 1460, 4720 ng*h/mL , respectively. 
The values of CL and V d were  2150, 1320, 1240 mL/h/kg and [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE]  mL/kg, 
respectively. The elimination of ARD -101 in monkeys was slow, as indicated by [CONTACT_67423] t1/2 of 
11.25  h. Within the dose range of 0.49 -4.85 mg/kg, AUC increased higher than dose proportional ly 
(Table 3).  
Following a single oral dose of ARD -101 at 0.49, 1.62 , and 4.85  mg/kg, the AUC 0-48h was 
insignificant and C max were  0, 1.98, 4.55  ng/mL , respectively, indicating an extremely low 
systemic exposure of ARD -101. The oral bioavailability (F%) in monkeys was estimated to be 0%  
at 0.49, 1.62, and 4.85 mg/kg, respectively.  No clinical abnormal signs were noticed given very 
low absorption and negli gible systemic exposure  (Table 3).  
In summary, the bioavailability of ARD -101 in monkey is negligible, no  systemic exposure 
reached after 4.85 mg/kg  p.o. administration .

Pharmacokinetic  parameters after repeated oral doses were obtained from the toxicokinetic study 
following b.i.d.  i.g. administration of 15, 30, or 100 mg/kg/dose of ARD -101 (denatonium base

for female monkeys and 40.1, 48.0, and 1400  ng*h/mL  for male monkeys at 15, 30, and 
100 mg/kg/doses, respectively.  No accumulation  of ARD -[ADDRESS_1208687] -101 exhibited low binding (<  50%) to human and rat plasma proteins, and a relatively high 
binding to monkey plasma proteins (50 % to 90%). An in vitro  liver microsome stability study 
showed that ARD -[ADDRESS_1208688] no metabolism in human liver microsomes. Cytochrome P450s ( CYPs ) 
were not the major enzymes involved in ARD -101 metabolism . An in vitro  metabolite 
identification study showed that the N -dealkylated metabolite (M1, lidocaine) was only seen in the 
human  S9 samples  at trace level s, account ing for only 0.05% of total peak areas. The oxidation 
product  M2 was the major metabolite, account ing for 18.88%, 5.82% , and 0.31% of total peak 
areas in rat, monkey and human s, respectively.   
A probe substrate -based inhibition study in human liver microsome s showed that ARD -[ADDRESS_1208689] -2 transporters, with IC50 value s of 21.07, 57.11, and 9.47  μM,

2.3.3.  Non-Clinical Safety Pharmacology and  Toxicology  
The toxicology program was designed to support clinical studi es in accordance with ICH Guidance 
M3(R2) . A non -GLP single dose acute toxicology study ( i.v. and p.o.) and a p ivotal GLP compliant 
general toxicology stud y with a  28-day treatment  (i.g.) and a  14-day recovery period have been 
conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys. In vitro  studies including bacterial reverse mutation assay 
Aardvark Therapeutics, Inc.                                               Clinical Study Protocol Version 6.[ADDRESS_1208690] -101 showed inhibition  of hERG current with an IC 50 of 99.2 µM ([ZIP_CODE] ng/mL) in vitro . 
Cardiovascular toxicity was observed in a single Cynomolgus monkey after i.v. administration of 
ARD -101 at 4.85 mg/kg  (in the single dose toxicology/PK study). The animal show ed repetitive 
arrhythmia  immediately following injection, the serum  concentration was 2270 ng/m L at the first 
sampling time point ([ADDRESS_1208691] -dose) , and this adverse effect recovered by [ADDRESS_1208692]- dose. 
The tolerated dose for an i.v. route is 1.62 mg/kg with a system ic exposure of 1460  ng*h/mL  and 
a peak serum concentration  (Cmax) of 803 ng/mL .  
In the 28 -day toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys, 100  mg/kg b.i.d.  i.g. administration of 
ARD -101 (human equivalent dose is 64.5 mg/kg , b.i.d. ) was well-tolerated in all animals , which 
is 37.[ADDRESS_1208693]-in-human  (FIH) clinical study  (40 mg b.i.d for 
a 70 kg adult ). There was no mortality or moribundity found in ARD -101-treated  animals . ARD -
101 showed no local toxicity in the GI organs (stomach, duodenum, ileum, jejunum, cecum, colon, 
and rectum) based on gross pathology and histological microscopic examinations . Only transient 
decreases in body weights in animals administered with 100 mg/kg  dose were observed, which 
may be related to the pharmacological effect of ARD -101. The no -observed -adverse -effect level 
(NOAEL) was considered to be 100  mg/kg/dose  (200 mg/kg/day)  with a systemic exposure 
AUC 0-24h of 1210  ng*mL/h and 1400 ng*mL/h for female and male monkeys , respectively . 
ARD -[ADDRESS_1208694] -101 was considered  negative for inducing 
structural aberrations of human peripheral blood lymphocytes ( HPBL)  in the [ADDRESS_1208695] -101 was positive for 
inducing structural aberrations of HPBL  in the 3 -hour treatment without metabolic activation . No 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047] , pH changes or cytotoxicity was observed at any dose level during the study.  
Further details can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
2.4. Summary of Findings from Previous Clinical Studies  
A FIH clinical study with the study drug  has been performed in healthy volunteers to interrogate 
safety and pharmacokinetics of multiple dose levels . 
The study consisted of 2 parts: A single ascending dose  part (SAD) and a multiple ascending dose 
part (MAD) , dosing subjects for 14 days BID. Each part tested three dose levels ([ADDRESS_1208696] -201 CONFIDENTIAL

2.4.2.  Overview of Clinical Efficacy  
At the time of  the submission of this IND, no clinical study has been conducted to investigate the 
efficacy of ARD -101. 
2.4.3.  Overview of Clinical Safety  
Clinical safety is based on , three dose cohorts of the SAD part and three  dose cohort s of the 
MAD part .  
In the SAD part of the study, ARD -101 was well -tolerated by [CONTACT_866336] (40, 100, and 240 mg). No adverse effects (AEs) were reported for any 
subject in the three dosing cohorts.  
ARD -[ADDRESS_1208707] -101 (46.2%) (Table 6). These consist ed of  gastrointestinal  disorder s (3 cases), 
nervous system  disorders (3 cases), skin and subcutaneous disorders (2 cases), and cardiac 
disorders (1 case) ( Table 7). Two cases  of skin restricted hypersensitivity  (urticaria)  occurred  at

 100 mg BID and 240 mg BID, respectively . The latter hypersensitivity was successfully addressed 
with premedication of oral antihistamine dosing as per protocol ; while the subject experiencing  
Grade 1 hypersensitivity  at the intermediate 100 mg BID dose was discontinued based on 
investigator’s decision and replaced . Gastrointest inal symptoms usually occurred, if so, early on

One case of allergic reaction has been reported in a female subject receiving denato nium benzoate , 
a compound in the same class as ARD -101 (Deloose E et al. 2017 ). Drug all ergic reactions can be 
either acute or delayed. The acute allergic reactions that usually occur within [ADDRESS_1208741] on a 
specific medication/therapy, it is the responsibility of the investigator to check  on potential drug -
drug interactions between that medication/therapy and  ARD -101 based on the Drug Development 
and Drug Interactions: Table of Substrates, Inhibitors and Inducers  
(https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug -interactions -labeling/drug -development -and-drug-interactions -

follows:  
  Adverse event  
  Protocol violation  
  Lost to follow -up 
  Subject withdrew consent at own request  
  Other  
A genuine effort must be made to determine the reason(s) why a subject fails to return for the 
necessary visits or is discontinued from the study. If the subject is unreachable by [CONTACT_756], a 
registered letter, at the minimum, should be sent to the subject requesting him/her to contact [CONTACT_27470].  
Withdrawn subjects may be replaced  until the full cohort has completed the study . 
Aardvark Therapeutics, Inc.                                               Clinical Study Protocol Version 6.[ADDRESS_1208743] sign an informed consent form (ICF) prior to the conduct of any screening 
procedures. Screening assessments will occur within [ADDRESS_1208744]’s relevant medical history and demographic data will be obtained. 
Retesting of abnormal screening va lues that lead to exclusion are allowed during the Screening 
Period (to reassess eligibility). The last result obtained prior to the first dose of study medication 
will be used to determine eligibility . 
8.2. Safety Variables  
8.2.1.  Adverse Events  
Adverse event reporti ng will begin for each subject from the date the ICF is signed  and will 
continue until the EOS  Visit . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Definition of Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical produ ct and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
Other untoward events occurring in the framework of a clinical study will be recorded as AEs, e.g. 
those occurring during treatment -free periods (including screeni ng or post -treatment follow -up 
periods), in association with study -related procedures and assessments, or under placebo. For study 
medication , lack of efficacy may be an expected potential outcome and should not be reported as 
an AE unless the event is unu sual in some w ay, e.g., greater in severity.  
Concomitant illnesses, which existed prior to entry into the clinical study, will not be considered 
AEs unless they worsen during the Treatment Period. Pre-existing  conditions will be recorded as 
part of the sub ject’s medical history.  
Aardvark Therapeutics, Inc.                                               Clinical Study Protocol Version 6.[ADDRESS_1208745] -201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page 45 of 66 09 May 2022 
 [IP_ADDRESS].2.  Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening; this means that the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_211384]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions  
• Is a congenital anomaly /birth defect, or  
• Is another important medical event (see below)  
Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life -threatening or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiri ng 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or in a physician’s office, blood dyscrasias or seizures 
that do not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
A distinction should be drawn between serious and s evere AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_29967]. For example, a mild degree of gastrointestinal 
bleeding requiring an overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_866316]. Similarly, an AE that is severe in intensity is not necessarily an 
SAE. For example, alopecia may be assessed as severe in intensity but would not be considered 
an SAE.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding if  an AE is serious and if 
expedited reporting is appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Recording of Adverse Events  
Adverse events should be collected and recorded for each subject from the date the ICF is signed 
until the end of their participation in the study, i.e., the subject h as discontinued or completed the 
study.  
Aardvark Therapeutics, Inc.                                               Clinical Study Protocol Version 6.[ADDRESS_1208746], or discovered by [CONTACT_866341], non -leading question such as ‘How have you 
been feeling since you were l ast asked?’ All AEs and any required remedial action will be 
recorded. The nature of AE, date (and time, if known) of AE onset, date (and time, if known) of 
AE outcome to date, severity and action taken of the AE will be documented together with the 
Princi pal Investigator ’s assessment of the seriousness of the AE and causal relationship  to study 
drug and/or study procedure.  
All AEs should be recorded individually in the subject’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1237] , the AEs constitute components of a recognized condition, 
disease or syndrome. In the latter case, the condition, disease or syndrome should be named rather 
than each individual symptom. The AEs will subsequently be coded using the Medical Dictionary 
for Regul atory Activities (MedDRA).  Severity of AEs will be graded using the Toxicity Grading 
Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers  Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials  
(September, 2007).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed b y the Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_866317] . 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Intensity  
The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_724271].  
• Mild  (Grade 1) : Ordinarily transient symptoms, does not influence performance of subject’s 
daily activities. Treatment is not ordinarily indicated.  
• Moderate  (Grade 2) : Marked symptoms, sufficient to make the subject uncomfortable. 
Moderate influence on performance of subject’s daily activities. Treatme nt may be necessary.  
• Severe  (Grade 3) : Symptoms cause considerable discomfort. Substantial influence on subject’s 
daily activities. May be unable to continue in the study and treatment may be necessary.  
• Potentially Life Threatening (Grade 4): Symptoms require emergency room (ER) visit or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event should be noted for that day. Any change in severity of signs and symptoms 
Aardvark Therapeutics, Inc.                                               Clinical Study Protocol Version 6.[ADDRESS_1208747] -201 CONFIDENTIAL

 over a number of days will be captured by [CONTACT_44745] a new AE, with the amended severity grade, 
and the date (and time, if known) of the change.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Causality  
The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_169160]/relationship between the study medication  and 
the AE . The Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_866318] : 
• No: Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug. For SAEs, an 
alternative causality  must be provided (e.g., pre -existing condition, concomitant 
medication)  
• Yes: There is reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_659641] . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_866319] a nd evaluate the intensity and the causal 
relationship of the event to study drug. All SAEs will be recorded from signing of the IC F until 
the EOS  Visit. Serious AEs occurring after the EOS  Visit  and coming to the attention of the 
Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_709402] (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1237] ) 
reasonable causal relationship with the study drug.  
The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_866320], whether 
deemed study medication -related or not, that a subject experiences during their participation in 
study within [ADDRESS_1208748] be followed later with detailed descriptions, including clear 
photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_211387] ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73529], consultant reports, autopsy 
reports), with the subject’s personal identifiers removed.  
Information on S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be collected and reported to the regulatory authority and the IEC  as 
required per guidelines . 
If the S[LOCATION_003]R  is fatal or life -threatening, associated with the use of the study medication , and 
unexpected, the regulatory authority and the IEC will be notified per guidelines after being made 
aware of the case. Additional follow -up (cause of death, autopsy report, h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_27450]) 
information should be reported per guidelines. S[LOCATION_003]Rs which are not fatal and not life -threatening 
are to be reported per guidelines.  
Aardvark Therapeutics, Inc.                                               Clinical Study Protocol Version 6.[ADDRESS_1208749] -201 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page 48 of 66 09 May 2022 
 The Sponsor will notify the Investigators of relevant information about S[LOCATION_003]Rs that could 
adversely affec t the safety of subjects in a timely fashion. Follow -up information may be submitted 
if necessary. The Sponsor will also provide annual safety reports for submission to the regulatory 
authority and the IEC responsible for the clinical study. These updates will include information on 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs and other relevant safety findings.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All AEs experienced by a subject, irrespective of the suspected causality, will be monitored until 
the event has resolved, until any abnormal laboratory valu es have returned to baseline or stabilized 
at a level acceptable to the Principal Investigator  [CONTACT_73651], until there is a satisfactory 
explanation for the changes observed or until the subject is lost to follow -up. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy  
The Sponsor has a re sponsibility to monitor the outcome of all pregnancies reported during the 
clinical study.  
Pregnancy alone is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_866321] a contraceptive medication. El ective abortions without 
complications should not be regarded as AEs, unless they were therapeutic abortions (see below). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14494] a healthy newborn should not be considered an SAE.  
Each pregnancy must be reported by [CONTACT_866342] [ADDRESS_1208750] be reported by [CONTACT_079]  [INVESTIGATOR_866322] 2 days  after he/she has gained knowledge of the normal 
delivery or elective abortion.  
Any SAE th at occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE Report Form (e.g., maternal 
serious complications, therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
congenital anomaly, birth defect) and reported within [ADDRESS_1208751] -201 CONFIDENTIAL

 8.2.2.  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Samples for clinical laboratory assessments will be collected at the time points detailed in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). Samples will be collected in appropriate tubes and handled

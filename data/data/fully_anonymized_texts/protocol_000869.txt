COMPOUND: Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (SAR231893)  
STUDY No: LTS12551  
TITLE  Open-label extension study to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of  
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_759737] a previous dupi[INVESTIGATOR_759739]/TRIAL LOCATION Worldwide 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT  Phase 2b/Phase 3. 
STUDY OBJECTIVES  Primary objective   
• To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_759740] a previous dupi[INVESTIGATOR_759741] (DRI12544, PDY14192, EFC13579, EFC13691).  
 
Secondary objectives   
• To evaluate the long-term efficacy of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_759742] a previous dupi[INVESTIGATOR_759743]. 
• To evaluate dupi[INVESTIGATOR_759744], with regard to: 
- systemic exposure; 
- anti-drug antibodies (ADA); 
- biomarkers. 
STUDY DESIGN Multinational, multicenter, open-la bel, extension study evaluating  
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg subcutaneously (SC) every 2 weeks (q2w) for 1-year 
(48 weeks) or 2-year (96 w eeks) treatment duration.  
Patients enrolled prior to Amendment 04 approval will continue to participate in the 2-year treatment  duration; patients enrolled after 
Amendment 04 approval will participate in the 1-year treatment duration.  
At enrollment, patients will be on medium or high dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and at least one ot her asthma controller medication, as 
maintained during the parent study in  which they participated (including
 
asthma background controller therapy with oral corticosteroids [OCS] only for patients from Study EFC13691).  
The clinical trial consists of 3 periods:
 
• Enrollment period: Combined V1/V2 Visit: Eligible patients from PDY14192, EFC13579, and EFC13691 studies should rollover into 
LTS12551 the same day as the  end-of-treatment visit of the parent  
study .  
- Note : A screening period of 0 to 3 weeks was proposed only 
for patients rolling over from DRI12544. Enrollment from Study 
DRI12544 is complete, thus the screening period does not 
apply anymore. 
• Treatment period: 48 or 96 weeks open-label treatment.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group- strictly confidential Page 4 - Patients enrolled prior to Amendment 04 approval will continue  
to participate in the 2-year treatment duration; patients enrolled
after Amendment 04 approval will participate in the 1-year treatment duration. During the open-label treatment period, 
patients will continue taking their background controller 
therapy, as maintained during the parent study or as modified based on Investigator's judgment. 
• Post-treatment period: 12 weeks.
  
- Upon completion of the open-label treatment period (or 
following early discontinuation of  investigational medicinal 
product [IMP]) patients will continue into the post-treatment period. During this period, patients will receive their 
background controller regimen, as maintained during the open-label treatment period or as modified based on 
Investigator's judgment (eg, taking into account the reduction 
of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_759745]).

(2 years) for patients enrolled prior to Amendment 04 approval.  
• Post-treatment period: 12 weeks. 
 
Study visits are performed q2w (ie, t wice a month / approximately q2w) during 
the first 3 months of study (up to Visit 8), every month during the next 3 months (up to Visit 11), and every 3 months up to the End-of-Treatment (EOT) Visit. In addition, monthly te lephone contacts will be performed after 
Week 24/Month 6 (Visit 11).  
 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
 Sample size determination  
The study size is predicated on the overall size of the parent studies;  
hence, the maximum number of patients to participate will correspond 
to the sum of the total number of patients enrolled in the DRI12544, PDY14192, EFC13579, and EFC13691 studies.  
 
Analysis population  
Safety population is defined as the patients exposed to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_759751]12551, regardless of the amount of treatment administered.  
The treatment-emergent period is defined as the time from the first 
dose of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_759752]12551 up to the last dose of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_759753] 
2 weeks (one dose interval) plus 12 weeks (follow-up period duration). 
 
Primary analysis 
The primary analysis of this study is the number (n) and percentage (%) of 
patients experiencing any
 TEAE, which will be summarized using  
descriptive statistics.  
Each adverse event (AE)/TEAE will be c oded according to the version of 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) in effect at 
sanofi as of the time of database lock.  
Analysis of secondary endpoints  
All analyses will be done descriptively on the safety population.

DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per
patient) Enrollment period : 
• For patients coming from PDY14192, EFC13579, and EFC13691, enrollment should be done at the Combined V1/V2 Visit (ie, on the 
same day as  the end-of-treatment visit of the parent study  combined 
with Visit 1 and Visit 2 of LTS12551 study).  
- Note: A screening period of 0 to 3 weeks was proposed only 
for patients rolling over from DRI12544. Enrollment from Study 
DRI12544 is complete, thus the screening period does not 
apply anymore. 
 
The (open-label) treatment  period is:  
• 48 weeks (1 year) for patients enrolled after Amendment 04 approval
or  
•  96 weeks (2 years) for patients enrolled prior to Amendment [ADDRESS_1040269]-treatment period  is 12-weeks. 
 The total study duration, per patients, is a maximum of 108 weeks (or 111 weeks considering a maximum screening period of 3 weeks for 
Study
 DRI12544) for the patients enrolled prior to Amendment 04 
approval and a maximum of 60 weeks for the patients enrolled after Amendment 04 approval.

only be measured at the Enrollment (Combined V1/V2) Visit. Vital signs will be measured in the sitting position using the same arm at each visit and w ill be measured prior to  IMP administration at  the clinic visits. 
l Clinical laboratories: Hematology: blood count (erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocytes), differential blood count (ne utrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils), and platelets. Serum 
chemistry: total bilirubin (in case of values above the normal range, differentiation in conjugated and non-conjugated bilirubi n), ALT, AST, ALP, total protein, albumin, total cholesterol, CPK, glucose, creatinine, 
BUN, uric acid, bicarbonate and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride). At enrollment, clinical laboratory testing results are collected from the parent study for HBsAg, HBsAb, HBcAb, total HBcAb, HCVAb, HIV 
screen (Anti-HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies) and ANA (ie, since these tests were scheduled at the visit prior to the  end-of-treatment visit of the PDY14192, EFC13579 or EFC13691 parent study ). In addition, results 
from hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV DNA) testing and HCV virus RNA (HCV RNA) testing should be collected for those patients who wer e HBsAg negative and HBcAb positive, and/or HCVAb positive; also anti-
-double-strand DNA antibody results for patients with ANA positive ( ≥1:160 titer). Note: Japanese patients who have rolled over from DRI12544 study should be retested for hepatitis B (HBsAg, HBsAb , and 
HBcAb), after Visit 1, at any time during the LTS12551 study, via the earliest scheduled study visit, after IRB approval for Lo cal Amendment 03 (Japan). 
m A negative serum pregnancy test was obtained at Visit 1, prior to Start-of-Treatment, for patients coming from DRI12544. Qualif ying pregnancy test for patients coming from PDY14192, EFC13579, and EFC13691 
studies will be the urine pregnancy test.

asthma patients, a regimen of controller therapy and reliever therapy provi des adequate long-term 
control. However, it is estimated that 5% to 10% of asthma patients have symptomatic disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_759760]-inflammatory and bronchodilator drugs. These patients account fo r many hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], use of emergency 
services, and unscheduled physician visits ( 1). 
Additionally, the long-term adverse effects of sy stemic and inhaled cor ticosteroids (ICS) on bone 
metabolism, adrenal function, and growth in child ren lead to attempts to minimize the amount of 
corticosteroid usage. Lastly, the consequences  of unresponsiveness to therapy or lack of 
compliance with therapy is loss of asthma control and ultimately, asthma exacerbation and 
medical sequelae of such events. 
The poor response of some patient s with asthma may reflect the number of cellular and molecular 
mechanisms operative in asthma. There is increasing interest in distinct phenotypes because 
targeted therapy is more likely to be successf ul in patients with simila r underlying pathobiologic 
features ( 2). Recent therapeutic approaches in asthma ha ve been focused on trying to control the 
T-helper cell-2 response. Up-regulation of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) has been implicated as an important inflammatory  component of asthma disease progression.  
Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], a fully human monoclonal antibody (m Ab) that binds specifically to the shared 
interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4R α) subunit of the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes, is under 
development as a potential novel treatment for asth ma. Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24784]-4 signaling via the

4.2 RATIONALE 
An initial demonstration of the efficacy and safety of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_759762], 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 2a stud y (ACT11457). This study 
investigated the effects of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_759763] (SC) once weekly for 
12 weeks as compared to placebo on the incidenc e of asthma exacerbations in patients with 
persistent moderate to se vere eosinophilic asthma.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 27 The primary endpoint was the occurrence of an  asthma exacerbation; the secondary endpoints 
included a range of measures of asthma control.  Effects on various type 2 helper T-cell (Th2) 
associated biomarkers and safety and tolerability are also evaluated ( 3).The ACT11457 study 
showed an 87% reduction in asthma exacerbations  after 12-week of treatment with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 
(5.8%) versus placebo (44.2%). A rapid improveme nt of lung function, as measured by f orced 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second  (FEV 1) and reduction of Th2-associated biomarkers levels were also 
observed ( 3).  
The DRI12544 study (phase 2b), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging 
study, evaluated several dose regimens of dup ilumab in patients with moderate to severe 
uncontrolled asthma (300 mg every 2 weeks [q2w ] with a 600 mg loading dose, 200 mg q2w with 
a 400 mg loading dose, 300 mg every 4 weeks [q4w] with a 600 mg loading dose, 200 mg q4w with a 400 mg loading dose), administered over [ADDRESS_1040318] 300 eosinophils per µL (HEos). Several s econdary efficacy endpoints were evaluated 
including: the annualized severe asthma exacerbation rate, percentage change from baseline in FEV
1, time to severe exacerbation, etc. For the primary endpoint, all dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725725] 
(except for the 200 mg q4w) showed a clinical ly meaningful and statistically significant 
improvement in FEV 1 at Week 12 in comparison with placebo in the high blood eosinophil count 
(HEos) population. For the secondary endpoint s assessed in the overall population and the 
subgroup with eosinophil counts of fewer than 300 eosinophils per µL, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] q2w (both the 200 mg and 300 mg) resulted in significant increases in FEV
1 (L) compared with placebo at

The dose of [ADDRESS_1040320] dose administered in Study DRI12544 and the phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_759765]13579, has been sele cted as the dose to be evaluated in 
Study LTS12551. This dosing regimen is within th e range of SC doses administered to healthy 
volunteers in R668-AS-0907 study and a higher dosing regimen of 300 mg qw was tested in the ACT11457. Additionally, 300 mg q2w (for 24 weeks) SC is the highest dose-regimen that was tested in DRI12544, a randomized, double-blind, pl acebo controlled dose-ranging efficacy study 
(phase 2b).  Treatment with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_759766]. The 
dosing regimen of 300 mg SC q2w is also the higher of the two doses selected for Study EFC13579 (QUEST), it is anticipated to saturate the targeted receptors and to allow for the attainment of an optimally effi cacious concentration. Furthermore, in Study DRI12544, treatment 
effects on lung function and biomarkers of infl ammation were similar at 200 mg q2w and 300 mg 
q2w, suggesting a plateauing of the dose-response below exposures achieved at 300 mg qw.  
From a safety perspective, the mean exposure following a dose of 300 mg of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] q2w at 
steady state is 2 to 3 times below the exposure range of SC doses of 300 mg administered every

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOCOL 
Multinational, multicenter, open- label, extension study evaluating dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg (SC) q2w 
for 1-year (48 weeks) or 2-year (96 weeks)  treatment duration. Patie nts enrolled prior to 
Amendment 04 approval will continue to participate in the 2-year treatment duration; patients 
enrolled after Amendment [ADDRESS_1040326] one other asthma controller medication, as maintained  during the parent study in whic h they participated (including 
asthma background controller therapy with OCS only for patients from Study EFC13691).  
 For a schematic study design please see Section 1.1 . 
6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION 
6.2.1 Duration of study participation for each patient 
LTS12551 study consists of 3 periods (See Section 10 ):  
Enrollment period : Combined V1/V2 Visit: Eligible  patients from PDY14192, EFC13579, and 
EFC13691 studies should rollover into LTS12551 the same day as the end-of-treatment visit of the 
parent study .  
Note: A screening period of 0 to 3 weeks was proposed only for patients rolling over from 
DRI12544. Enrollment from Study DRI12544 is comp lete, thus the screening period does not 
apply anymore. 
Treatment period : 48 or 96 weeks open- label treatment.  
Patients enrolled prior to Amendment 04 approval, will continue to participate in the 2-year 
treatment duration; patients enrolled after Amendment 04 approval will participate in the 1-year treatment duration. During the open-label treatme nt period, patients will c ontinue taking their 
background controller therapy, as maintained durin g the parent study or as modified based on 
Investigator's judgment. 
Post-treatment period : 12 weeks.  
Upon completion of the open-labe l treatment period (or following early discontinuation of 
Investigational Medicinal Product [IMP]) patients will continue into the post-treatment period. 
During this period, patients will continue their background controller therapy, as maintained 
during the open-label treatment period or as modifi ed based on Investigator's judgment (eg, taking 
into account the reduction of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_759774]).

At the Enrollment (Combined V1/V2) Visit, the Investigator or delegate will train the patient (and/or caregiver[s]) how to prepare and inject IM P for the first injection or if the patient is 
already self-injecting (in the parent study), the Investigator or delegate will supervise the  
self-injection. 
For subsequent doses, which are not given at the study site, specific pages will be provided to the 
patients to record information related to the injections. The pages will be kept as source data in the patient’s study file.  
If the patient (or caregiver) is unable or unwilling to administer IMP, arrangements must be made 
for qualified site personnel and/or healthcare professionals (eg, visiting nurse service) to administer IMP for the doses that are not sc heduled to be given at the study site. 
If the study visit is not performed at the study site as scheduled, the dos e will be administered by 
[CONTACT_5363]/or their caregiver/healthcare professi onal, or arrangements must be made for a visit 
to the site to administer the IMP.  
When IMP is administered at home, the patients must  be advised by [CONTACT_7893], to self-monitor 
for at least [ADDRESS_1040336] a

9.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINT 
The primary endpoint of this study is the number (n) and percentage (%) of patients experiencing 
any treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE). 
Adverse events, serious adverse ev ents (SAEs), adverse events of special interest (AESI), AEs 
leading to IMP discontinuation and death will be collected from the date of the signed informed 
consent form (ICF) for participation in LTS12551  (planned at the Combined V1/V2 Visit). The 
study specific and general safety criteria are detailed in Section 10.4.1. To assure the continuing safety of patients in this study,  an Independent DMC will be res ponsible for reviewing the safety 
data on a periodic basis throughout the course of the study as outlined in Section 6.2 .  
Adverse events, AESIs, SAEs, AEs leading to IMP discontinuation and deaths will be reported as described in Section 10.4.1 and analyzed as in Section 11.4.3.  
Safety Observations
 
• The Investigator should take all appropriate meas ures to ensure the safety of the patients. 
Notably, he/she should follow-up the outcome of SAEs/AESIs until c linical recovery is 
complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, or death. In all cases, this may imp ly that observations will continue beyond the 
last planned visit per protocol, and that additional investiga tions may be requested by [CONTACT_429]. 
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end of the study as defined by [CONTACT_56485]. 
• In the case of any SAE/AESI requiring immediate notification, being brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the patient, and considered by [CONTACT_12552]/her to be caused by [CONTACT_3433] e investigational produc t with a reasonable 
possibility, this should be reported to the Sponsor.

Vital signs, including blood pre ssure (mmHg), heart rate (beats  per minute), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] 
(breaths per minute), body temperature (degrees Ce lsius), and body weight (kg) will be measured 
at every scheduled treatment visit (see flow charts Section 1.2  and Section 1.3 ). Height (cm) will 
only be measured at enrollment. Vital signs will be measured in the sitting position using the same 
arm at each visit, and will be measured prior to receiving investigational product at the study 
visits.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical examination 
Physical examinations will include an assessment of general appearance, skin, eyes, ear/nose/throat, heart, chest,  abdomen, reflexes, lymph nodes, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and extremities. All 
deviations from normal will be recorded, including those attributable to the patient’s disease. Physical examinations will be performed as per the schedule of assessments (see flow charts Section 1.2 and Section 1.3 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram (ECG) variables 
A 12-lead ECG will be performed as per the schedule of assessments (see flow charts Section 1.2  
and Section 1.3 ). A minimum of 3 complexes in an appropriate lead (lead II) will be averaged to 
determine the PR-interval, QT/QTc-interval, and QRS-complex (and heart rate will also be measured) for each ECG.  
The Investigator should review the ECG and docu ment his interpretation, signed and dated on the 
ECG print out. The original trace is kept as source data. Electrocardiogram tracings are also read 
manually by [CONTACT_6222], certif ied and “centralized” cardiologists, who determine ECG 
parameters and who in addition aler t the Investigator and the Sponsor  of any clinically significant 
findings or changes. These manually read tracings are the ECG tracing of record for this clinical trial. A specific written manual regarding the procedures related to the centralized ECG reading are provided to each Investigator. Refer to the ECG manual for further details.  
Notes:  Any abnormal ECG parameter should be immediately rechecke d for confirmation before 
making a decision of permanent discontinuation of treatment with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_759785].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical laboratory tests 
The clinical laboratory tests will be conducted by [CONTACT_759822], as required for di agnostic testing, and must provide evidence of 
participation in proficiency testing, as appropriate. After reviewing the laboratory report and 
evaluating any results that are outside the normal range, the Investigator must sign and date the 
laboratory report. Abnormal laboratory values that are considered to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_759823], to rule 
out laboratory error. Persistent abnormal laboratory values should be repeated until they return to normal or until an etiology of the pe rsistent abnormalit y is determined.

[IP_ADDRESS] ACQ-5 (Asthma Control Questionnaire, 5-question version) 
The ACQ-5 was designed to measure both the adequacy of asthma control and change in asthma control which occurs either spontane ously or as a result of treatment. 
The ACQ-5 has 5 questions, reflecting the top-scor ing five asthma symptoms: woken at night by 
[CONTACT_23805], wake in the mornings with symptoms, limitation of daily activities, shortness of breath and wheeze. Patients are asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week and 
to respond to the symptom questions on a 7- point scale (0=no impairment, 6= maximum 
impairment, see Appendix F ). 
A global score is calculated: the questions are eq ually weighted and the ACQ-5 score is the mean 
of the 5 questions and, therefore, between 0 (tot ally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled). 
Higher score indicates lower asthma control. Patients with a score below 1.[ADDRESS_1040354] that can be considered clinically

[IP_ADDRESS] Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire with standardized activities (AQLQ[S]) 
The AQLQ(S) was designed to measure the functi onal impairments that are most troublesome to 
patient as a result of their asthma (see Appendix E). The instrument is comprised of 32 items, 
each rated on a 7-point Likert scales from 1 to 7. The AQLQ(S) has 4 domains. The domains and the number of items in each domain are as follows: 
• Symptoms (12 items); 
• Activity limitation (11 items); 
• Emotional function (5 items); 
• Environmental stimuli (4 items).  
A global score is calculated ranging from 0 to 7 and a score by [CONTACT_121982]. Higher scores indicate 
better quality of life. The instrument has been used  in many clinical tria ls, and it has been shown 
to be reliable, valid (pa tient interviews), and sensitive to chan ge. It will be done in those countries 
where a validated translation is available. A MCID is available ( 7).

[IP_ADDRESS].2 Asthma Symptom Score  
Prior to Amendment 04, patients recorded overall symptom scores twice a day prior to measuring PEF. The patient’s overall asthma symptoms ex perienced during the waking hours were recorded 
in the evening (PM symptom score). Symptoms experienced during the night were recorded upon arising (AM symptom score). Baseline symptom scores will be the mean AM and mean PM scores recorded for the [ADDRESS_1040360] the severity of symptoms as follows: 
AM symptom score: 
• 0 = No asthma symptoms, slept through the night; 
• 1 = Slept well, but some complaints in the morning. No nighttime awakenings; 
• 2 = Woke up once because of asthma (including early awakening); 
• 3 = Woke up several times because of asthma (including early awakening); 
• 4 = Bad night, awake most of the night because of asthma. 
PM symptom score: 
• 0 = Very well, no asthma symptoms; 
• 1 = One epi[INVESTIGATOR_333940], cough, or breathlessness; 
• 2 = More than one epi[INVESTIGATOR_333940], coug h, or breathlessness without interference of 
normal activities;

For patients from EFC13691 the prescribed backgr ound therapy with OCS will be recorded in the 
e-CRF.  
For the patients from the EFC13691 study only, the following 3 efficacy endpoints will be derived 
using the prescribed dose of the background OC S medications. The baseline OCS dose is the 
original baseline value from the EFC13691 study. 
• Percentage change from baseline in OCS dose; 
• Proportion of patients achieving a reduction of 50% or greater in their OCS dose compared with the original baseline in the parent study; 
• Percentage of patients that  were able to be tapere d off completely of OCS. 
9.3 OTHER ENDPOINTS 
9.3.1 Pharmacokinetics and anti-dupi[INVESTIGATOR_245539] [IP_ADDRESS] Sampling time 
Blood samples collected before the IMP adminis tration are used for the determination of 
functional dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181159]-dupi[INVESTIGATOR_245539] (also known as ADAs). Samples will be 
collected as per the schedule of assessments (see flow charts in Section 1.2  and Section 1.3 ). The 
date of collection should be recorded in the patient e-CRF. The date and time will also be 
collected on the central laboratory requisition form  and entered into the database through data 
transfers from the central laboratory. 
In the event of any SAE or any AESI of anaphylac tic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that 
are related to IMP and require tr eatment, or severe injection s ite reaction lasting longer than 
24 hours, samples will be collected near the onset and resolution of the event for any additional 
analysis if required or for archival purposes. An  unscheduled systemic drug concentration page 
(“PK page”) in the e-CRF must be completed as well. 
Pre-existing ADAs are defined as:  
• An ADA positive response in the assay at ba seline with all post- treatment ADA results 
negative, OR 
• An ADA positive response at baseline with a ll post-treatment ADA responses less than 
4-fold over baseline titer levels.

Treatment-boosted ADAs are defined as: 
• An ADA positive response in the assay post firs t dose that is greater-than or equal to 
4-fold over baseline titer levels, when baseline results are positive. 
Treatment-emergent ADA responses are further classified as Transient, Persistent or 
Indeterminate: 
a) Persistent Response: define d as a treatment-emergent response with two or more 
consecutive ADA positive sampling time points, separated by [CONTACT_726] 12-week period 
(with no ADA negative samples in between). 
b) Indeterminate Response: defined as a treatment-emergent response with only the last collected sample positive in the ADA assay.  
c) Transient Response: defined as a treatment-e mergent response that is not considered 
persistent OR indeterminate. 
Unused samples collected for drug concentrati on or ADA analyses may be used for research 
purpose. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics handling procedure 
It is extremely important to collect all blood samples as close to the protocol-specified time as possible. The reasons for any missed or lost  blood samples should be  documented. Special 
procedures for collection, storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_759791]. An overview of handling procedure for samples used in the determination of drug

9.3.2 Pharmacogenetic assessment 
No pharmacogenetics samples will be taken during this study. 
9.3.3 Pharmacodynamic variables 
Several biomarkers related to asthmatic inflammation, Th2 polar ization and possible IL-4/IL13 
activity will be assessed for their value in predicting therapeutic response and/or in documenting the time course of drug respons e. Sampling will be conducted as per the schedule of assessments 
(see flow charts in Section 1.2  and Section 1.3 ). More detailed information on the collection, 
handling, transport and preservation of samp les (eg, minimum volumes required for blood 
collection and for aliquots for ea ch biomarker assay) will be pr ovided in a separate laboratory

[IP_ADDRESS] Whole blood biomarkers 
Eosinophilia is recognized as a marker for diag nosing and predicting risk of exacerbations in 
asthma. Eosinophils and Th2 cytokines play a cent ral role in the pathophysiology of severe 
asthma. Eosinophil count has been used to guid e treatment decisions in severe asthma. In 
LTS12551 study, blood eosinophil count will be measur ed as part of the standard 5-part white

[IP_ADDRESS] Serum biomarkers  
Serum total IgE:  It has been widely recognized and reporte d that IgE levels correlate with asthma 
severity and bronchial hyper-responsiveness ( 8). Interleukin-4 regulates IgE synthesis in human 
lung ( 9). Interleukin-4, in combination with IL-13, induces the class switch–recombination to IgE 
by B-cells ( 10), ( 11). Anti-IgE therapy has been reported to decrease asthma exacerbation and the 
requirement for inhaled steroid therapy. In  the ACT11457 and DRI12544 studies, IgE  steadily 
declined throughout the treatment periods without  reaching a steady state. In DRI12544, total IgE 
and several antigen-specific IgEs declined > 50% from baseline during [ADDRESS_1040366] cells by 
[CONTACT_759825]. The IgE measurement in the LTS12551 study will help us 
better understand how the IgE level changes du ring the long-term dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24736].  
Serum total IgE will be measured with a qu antitative method (eg, ImmunoCAP) approved for 
diagnostic testing and will no longer be perform ed in the LTS12551 study, due to Amendment 04.

10.2 DEFINITION OF SOURCE DATA 
Source data is all information in original records a nd certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_122567], observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and 
evaluation of the trial. Source data are cont ained in source documents. Source documents are 
original documents, data and records such as hospi [INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinic and office charts, laboratory 
notes, memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, r ecorded data from automated instruments, etc. 
All the data collected in the e-CRF should be transcribed directly from source documents. Data 
downloaded from the study-associated central la boratories, spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], ECG, and patient 
electronic diary.  
10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made tempor arily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the e-CRF. In any case, the patient should remain in the study as long as possible. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_1040463](s) 
The following conditions will be causes for temporary treatment discontinuation: 
• Infections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment.  
• Any laboratory abnormality that meets tempor ary treatment disconti nuation criteria as per 
Appendix D . 
In addition, temporary treatment discontinuation may be considered by [CONTACT_56476]. Re-initiation of treatment with the IMP will be done under close and appropriate 
clinical and/or laboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have considered (according to his/her best medical judgment) th at the AE is sufficiently resolved and unlikely to recur after 
resuming therapy with IMP, that the responsibility of the IMP in the occurrence of the concerned event was unlikely, and that the selection criteria for the study are still met (see Section 7.1  and 
Section 7.2 ). 
For all temporary treatment discon tinuations, the Investigator shoul d record injections that are 
missed in the e-CRF IMP pages. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_1040464](s) 
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any tr eatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the patient not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at any time.

SAR231893-LTS12551 - dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181143]: [ADDRESS_1040466] of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and 
irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Inve stigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to 
document the reasons for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the e-CRF. 
Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG para meter should be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation (within 24 hour s) before making a decision of pe rmanent discontinuation of the IMP 
for the concerned patient. Threshold values fo r the discontinuation of IMP are defined in 
collaboration with Global Pharmacovigilance and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (see  Appendix D ). 
The following criteria will lead to permanent treatment discontinuation:  
• At their own request or at the request of th eir legally authorized representative (legally 
authorized representative means an individual or judicial or other body authorized under 
applicable law to consent on beha lf of a prospective patient to the patient’s participation in 
the procedure(s) involved in the research).  
• If, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation in the study would be detrimental to the 
patient’s well-being (see also safety Section  10.6). 
• At the specific request of the Sponsor. 
• In the event of a protocol deviation, at the discretion of the Investigator or the Sponsor. 
• Pregnancy (Note: dupi[INVESTIGATOR_759799] d but patient should be followed up until 
delivery). 
• Anaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require 
treatment. 
• Diagnosis of a malignancy during study, excluding carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin. 
• Any opportunistic infection, such as tuberculosis  (TB) or other infections whose nature or 
course may suggest an immunoc ompromised status (See Appendix I ). 
• Serum ALT >3 Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) concurrent with Total Bilirubin >[ADDRESS_1040467] (see Appendix D ). 
• Serum ALT >[ADDRESS_1040468] if baseline ALT < [ADDRESS_1040469] or ALT >[ADDRESS_1040470] if baseline  ALT >[ADDRESS_1040471] ( Appendix D ). 
Note: Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter will be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation before making a decision of perman ent discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned 
patient.

Exacerbation Event Form”. These events should not be reported as AEs unless they fulfill a 
seriousness criterion.  
For this study, asthma exacerbations should be managed by [CONTACT_181283] / international asthma management guidelines. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious adverse event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
 Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which  the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which  hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_56385], or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or 
• Is a medically important event. 
Medical and scientific j udgment should be exercised in deci ding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n, but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical or surgical intervention (ie, specific measures or corrective treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for determining which condition has to be considered as a medically im portant event. The list is not 
intended to be exhaustive: 
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for: 
- Allergic bronchospasm, Anaphylaxis. See Appendix H  for the Definition of 
Anaphylaxis. 
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc).  
- Convulsions (seizures, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], epi[INVESTIGATOR_12995], absence, etc). 
• Development of drug depe ndence or drug abuse.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event of special interest 
An AESI is an AE (serious or non-serious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by [CONTACT_125478]. Such even ts may require further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand them. AESIs may be added or removed during a study by [CONTACT_514164]. 
For these AESIs, the Sponsor will be inform ed immediately (ie, within 24 hours), per SAE 
notification described in Section 10.4.3, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, using the 
corresponding pages/screens in the e-CRF.  
• Anaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require 
treatment (see Appendix H for Definition of Anaphylaxis). 
• Severe injection site reactions that last longer than 24 hours. 
• Any infection meeting at least one of the following criteria (see Section  10.6.3): 
- Any serious infection (SAE). 
- Requires parenteral (intravenous, intram uscular, SC) antimicrobial therapy. 
- Requires oral antimicrobial therapy for longer than 2 weeks. 
- Is a parasitic infection. 
- Is an opportunistic infection (see Appendix I ). 
Note: Antimicrobial therapy refers to antibiotic, antiviral, and antifungal agents. 
• Significant ALT elevation:  
- ALT >[ADDRESS_1040479] in patients with baseline ALT ≤[ADDRESS_1040480]; or 
- ALT >[ADDRESS_1040481] if baseline ALT >[ADDRESS_1040482].  
• Pregnancy:  
- Pregnancy occurring in a female patient entered in the clinical trial or in a female partner of a male patient entered in the clinical trial. It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills one of the seriousness criteria (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).

10.4.2 General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
• All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relati onship to IMP/Non-IMP, spanning from the 
signature [CONTACT_206411] [CONTACT_56485], are to be recorded  on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of 
the e-CRF. 
• Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. The Investigator should specify the date of ons et, intensity, action taken with respect to 
IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, and his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_56390] a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_179646](s). 
• The Investigator should take appropriate measur es to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol , and that additional 
investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_400335]. 
• Patients who experience an ongoing SAE or an  AESI with immediate notification, at the 
pre-specified study end-date , should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or death 
and related data will be collected. 
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end of the study as defined by [CONTACT_56485]. 
• Laboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be re corded as AEs only if:  
- Symptomatic and/or  
- Requiring either corrective trea tment or consu ltation, and/or  
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or  
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or  
- Defined as an AESI.

During the course of the study, the Sponsor will report in an expedited manner: 
• All SAEs that are both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the IMP (ie, a Serious 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction [SUS AR]), to the regulatory authorities, 
Institutional Review Boards / Institutional Ethics Committees (IRBs/IECs) as appropriate 
and to the Investigators. 
• All SAEs that are expected and at least reasonably related to the IMPs to the regulatory authorities, according to local regulations. 
In this study exacerbations of asthma, as pre-existing condition, will be considered expected for purposes of regulatory reporting, unless the event is life-threatening or with fatal outcome (see the Investigator’s Brochure). 
Any other AE not listed as an expected event in the Investigator’s Brochure or in this protocol

In order to closely follow liver function tests (LFT), assessment of total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, ALT, AST, and ALP are measured as part of the clinical laboratory testing. Clinical laboratory testing also includes a hepatitis screen for HBsAg, HBcAb-IgM, HCVAb. Patients who are total-HBcAb positive and HBsAg negative must undergo HBV DNA testing to determine 
eligibility. Furthermore, it is recommended that patients who are receiving potentially 
immunosuppressive therapy and are HBcAb positive and HBV DNA negative undergo 
surveillance HBV DNA every [ADDRESS_1040504] should be consulted on a case-by-case basis.  
Note: Japanese patient s who have rolled over from DRI [ZIP_CODE] study should be retested for 
hepatitis B (HBsAg, HBsAb, and HBcAb) after Visit 1, at any time during the LTS12551 study 
via the earliest scheduled study visit, after IRB approval for Local Amendment 03 (Japan). Japanese patients with HBsAg negative and HBsAb positive at any time during the parent study or at the additional test due to  Local Amendment 03 (Japan) do not need to discontinue the study. 
In Japan (or other countries/regions if there is local regulatory requirement), hepatitis B viral load (HBV DNA) will be tested for patients who are HBsAg negative and HBsAb positive

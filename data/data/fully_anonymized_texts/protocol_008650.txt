1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
DAILIES TOTAL1® for Astigmatism Contact [CONTACT_474553] (DT1fA) and PRECISION1® 
(verofilcon A) for Astigmatism Contact [CONTACT_32993] (P 1fA) are daily disposable lenses indicated 
for the correction of astigmatism and associat ed ametropia in persons with non-diseased 
eyes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ocular physiological response following 
wear of DT1fA relative to P1fA as control.  
1.1. Name [CONTACT_474559]1fA. DT1fA contact [CONTACT_169760] a lens material that is 33% water and 67% (delefilcon A) polymer, a silicone containing hydrogel with added phosphatidylcholine. DT1fA lenses also contain a handling tint (color additive copper phthalocyanine).  The control lens in this study will be P1fA. P1 fA soft contact [CONTACT_169760] a lens 
material that is 51% water and 49% verofilcon A, a silicone containing hydrogel. The color 
additive Reactive Blue 247 is added to the lens material to crea te a light blue edge-to-edge 
color to make it easier to see when handling. In addition, P1fA lenses contain a benzotriazole UV-absorbing monomer to block UV radiation. Th e transmittance characteristics are less than 
1% in the UVB range of 280 nm to 315 nm and less than 10% in the UVA range of [ADDRESS_608142] ar ticles are found in section 6.1 of th is protocol and in the DT1fA 
and P1fA package inserts (Appendix C). 
1.2. Intended Use of Investigational Products 
The intended use of the investigational products is the correcti on of astigmatism and associated 
myopic refractive error. Study lenses will be worn  bilaterally in a daily wear, daily disposable 
modality for at least 8 hours per day. Each wear period will be 7±2 (i.e., 5 to 9) days in duration, and subjects will be instructed to wear lenses for at least 5 days per week during each wear period. Two wear periods will be completed, with a washout pe riod of 7±2 days between the 
wear periods. 
1.3. Summary of Findings from Nonclinical Studies 
Not Applicable – marketed product only. 
1.4. Summary of Known Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects 
The anticipated clinical benefit of the investigational lenses will be the correction of refractive error. The risks associated with use of the inves tigational lenses are consid ered to be equivalent 
to those associated with other marketed soft contact [CONTACT_126105] (i.e., daily disposable).    Comprehensive risk and benefit information regarding the study lenses are included in the DT1fA and P1fA package inserts (Appendix  C).

control followed by [CONTACT_348244]). During each wear peri od the lenses will be worn bilaterally for 1 
week (7r2 days) in a daily disposable modality. Study lenses will be worn for a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_608151] 5 days per week dur ing the wear period. Subjective comfort, vision, 
and handling will be asse ssed using the CLUE questionnaire at both fitting and follow-up visits 
for each wear period. HLHC VA will be asse ssed at the follow-up ev aluation using ETDRS 
charts. Ocular health will be assessed by [CONTACT_474555]-up vis its. There will be a washout period of 7( r2) days 
duration between wear periods. Subjects will not have access to the study lenses following 
completion of the protocol. 
 
4.2. Study Design Rationale 
A 2×[ADDRESS_608152] as their own active control. A washout period will be include d to mitigate any carryover effects.  
 
The prescribed wear schedule (7 r2 days, minimum of 8 hours per day, minimum of 5 days per 
week) was chosen as this is representative of a typi[INVESTIGATOR_126091]. 
 Slit lamp biomicroscopy was selected as the me thod for assessing ocular health, on the basis 
that it is the most commonly used instrument for comprehensive examination of the anterior eye. The FDA slit lamp findings classification scale was selected for grading ocular health on the basis that it is widely used and is part of the FDA regulatory guidance for contact [CONTACT_13276] 
(FDA 510(k) guidance).   The investigational lenses will be fitted by [CONTACT_474556].  
4.3. Enrollment Target and Study Duration 
This study will have an enrollment target of approximately [ADDRESS_608153] locked.

5. TEST ARTICLE ALLOCATION AND MASKING 
5.1. Test Article Allocation  
This study will be a randomized, double-maske d, 2×2 crossover design. Subjects will be 
randomized into one of 2 unique sequence groups in  a 1:1 allocation ratio to wear two different 
study lens designs (test and control designs) one  at a time bilaterally over [ADDRESS_608154] occurred prior to randomization: 
x Informed consent must have been obtained 
x The subject must have met all inclusion and exclusion criteria 
x The subject history and baseline information must have been collected 
 Randomly permuted block randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups.  When dispensing test articles, the followi ng steps should be followed to maintain 
randomization codes: 
1. Investigator or designee (documented on the Delegation Log) will consult the 
randomization scheme (lens fitting schedule) to obtain the test article assignment for that subject prior to dispensing. 
2. Investigator or designee will record the subject’s number on the appropriate line of the randomization scheme (lens fitting schedule).  
3. Investigator or designee will pull the appropr iate test articles fr om the study supply. 
All test articles that are opened, whether dispensed (placed/fit on eye or dispensed outside the clinical site) or not, must be recorded on the Test Article Accountability Log in the “Dispensed” section. 
5.2. Masking 
To reduce the possibility of bias, this will be a double-masked trial. Subjects will not be aware of the identity of the assigned lenses. The identity of the study lenses will be masked by [CONTACT_197546] r, lot number, sphere power, cylinder power, 
axis, expi[INVESTIGATOR_197530]. While clini cal trial personnel (including 
investigators, site technician s, data management, the study biostatistician, and clinical 
operations personnel) will be aware of the brand and type of lenses included in the study, every attempt will be made to ensure  they are not made aware of the corresponding randomization 
codes for the test and control lenses. Only the unmasked Biostatistician generating the 
randomization scheme (lens fitting schedule) will have access to the decode information that allows matching of the randomization codes to the investigational articles. The medical monitor will also have access to the decode information in case breaking the mask is necessary for the urgent medical treatment of a subject.

5.3. Procedures for Maintaining and Breaking the Masking 
Under normal circumstances, the mask should not be broken until all subj ects have completed 
the study and the database is finalized. Otherwise, the mask s hould be broken only if specific 
emergency treatment/course of ac tion would be dictated by [CONTACT_35496]. In such cases, the Investigator may, in  an emergency, contact [CONTACT_7195]. In 
the event the mask is broken, the Sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date, 
time, and reason for the unmasking must be documented in the subject record. The Investigator 
is also advised not to reveal the study treatment  assignment to the clinical site or Sponsor 
personnel.   Subjects who have had their tr eatment assignment unmasked are expected to return for all 
remaining scheduled evaluations. Subjects who are discontinued may be replaced at the discretion of the study sponsor.  
6. STUDY INTERVENTION

x completed all visits through th e final visit (visit 4).    
x If all visits were completed but an additional visit is considered necessary for subject 
care, follow the requirements for unscheduled visits in section 7.3. 
8.2. Withdrawal/Discontinua tion from the Study 
A subject will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: 
x Subject withdrawal of consent. 
x Subject not compliant to protocol. 
x Subject lost to follow-up. 
x Subject no longer meets eligibility criteri a (e.g. the subject becomes pregnant). 
x Subject develops significant or serious adverse events necessitating discontinuation of 
study lens wear. 
x Subjects who have experienced a Corneal Infiltrative Event (CIE). 
x Investigator’s clinical judgment regarding the subject safety reasons (that it is in the best interest of the subject to stop treatment). 
x Subject misses any study visits.  
x Subject not compliant with study lens wear schedule.  
x Subject not successfully dispensed due to lack of efficacy and safety including poor 
vision, poor comfort or unacceptable fit. 
 
For discontinued subjects, the Investigator will: 
x Complete the current visit (scheduled or unscheduled). 
x Complete the Final Evaluation, indicating th e reason that the subject was discontinued 
from the study. 
x Record the spherocylindrical refraction with best corrected distance visual acuity. 
x Collect used test article(s) (worn or brought to the visit) from the subject and discard 
them, unless otherwise stated in section 7.2. 
x Collect all unused test article(s) from the subject. 
x Make arrangements for subject care, if needed, due to their study participation. 
 
Additional subjects may be enrolled if a subj ect discontinues from the study prematurely.  
 In cases where a subject is lost to follow-up, ever y possible effort must be made to contact [CONTACT_35508]/withdrawal. The measures taken to follow 
up must be documented including two written attempts and a certified letter (or equivalent) as the final attempt.  
9. PRE-STUDY AND CONCOMITANT INTERVENTION/MEDICATION 
Concomitant medications will be documented during screeni ng and updated during the study. 
Disallowed concomitant in terventions for this study include ocular medications of any kind, 
or any systemic medica tions that would normally contrai ndicate contact [CONTACT_126102].

[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.  
 
JJVC (and the IEC/IRB and  DMC, if applicable) will evaluate all adverse events. If it is 
determined that an adverse event presents an unr easonable risk, the investigation, or that part 
of the investigation presenting the risk, will be terminated as soon as possible. 
 
Should the study be terminated (either prematurely or as scheduled), the Investigator will notify the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authority as  required by [CONTACT_35512]. 
12. PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING PRODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINTS 
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC ) refers to any written, electr onic, or oral communication 
that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness or performance of test articles after they have been released for clinical trial use.    Potential complaints may come from a variety of  sources including but not limited to subjects, 
clinical research associates (CRA), clinical  operations managers (COM), medical monitors, 
and site personnel, etc. The following are not considered product quality complaints: 
x Subject satisfaction inquirie s reported via “Subjective Qu estionnaires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO).” 
x Clinical test articles that are stored improperly or damaged after receipt at the investigational site. 
x Lens replacements that occur due to drops/fall-outs. 
x Damage deemed by [CONTACT_35513], 
and not indicative of a quality deficiency (i.e. tears, rips, etc.), only in situations where there is no deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_423]. 
 Within [ADDRESS_608155] be 
recorded in the EDC system, which will trigger an automatic email notification to the appropriate COM/CRA and Clinical QA representative. In cases where the EDC system in use is not configured to send automatic notificati ons or when an EDC system is not used, the 
COM/CRA is responsible for notifying Clinical QA upon discovery that a PQC has occurred.   
 Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the COM/ CRA will contact [CONTACT_19568]:  
x Date the complaint was received/recorde d in the EDC System (Date of Sponsor 
Awareness). 
x Who received the complaint. 
x Study number. 
x Clinical site information (contact [CONTACT_2300], site ID, telephone number). 
x Lot number(s). 
x Unique Subject Identifier(s). 
x Indication of who first observed co mplaint (site personnel or subject). 
x OD/OS indication, along with whet her the lens was inserted. 
x Any related AE number if applicable. 
x Detailed complaint description (scheduled/unscheduled visit, wear time, symptoms, resolution of symptoms, etc.). 
CR-6493, v 1.0  
Page 44 of 141JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.  
 
x Eye Care Provider objective (slit lamp) findings if applicable. 
x Confirmation of product availa bility for return (and tracking information, if available), 
or rationale if pr oduct is not available for return  
 
 
Once a complaint is received, it will be assessed by [CONTACT_19569], CRA, or trained site personnel 
to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Seri ous Adverse Event (AE/SAE). If the complaint 
results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or traine d site personnel will follo w section 13 of this 
protocol. If the AE/SAE was potentially the result of a product quality related deficiency, these procedures also apply and will be executed in parallel.    In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_35514]. In this event, the PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Blank” or “ILB.” Justification for ILB must be documented. 
13. ADVERSE EVENTS 
13.1. Definitions and Classifications 
Adverse Event (AE) – An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users 
or other persons, whether or not related to the investig ational medical device.”  
Note : This definition includes events related to  the investigational medical device or the 
comparator, and to the procedures involved. Fo r users or other persons, this definition is 
restricted to events related to investigational medical devices.1 
 
An AE includes any condition (including a pre-existing condition) that: 
1. Was not present prior to the study, but app eared or reappeared following initiation of 
the study. 
2. Was present prior to the study but worsened  during the study. This would include any 
condition resulting from concomita nt illnesses, reactions to  concomitant medications, 
or progression of disease states. 
Note : Pregnancy must be documented as an adverse event and must be reported to the clinical 
monitor and to the Sponsor immedi ately upon learning of the event. 
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – An SAE is any adverse event that led to any of the following: 
x Death 
x Serious deterioration in the health of the subject that resulted in any of the following: 
x Life-threatening illness or injury 
x Permanent or persistent impairment of a body structure or a body function 
x Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93790] 
x Medical or surgical intervention to prev ent life-threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function.

x Limbal cell Damage leading to Conjunctivalization 
 
Significant Adverse Events  – are defined as events that are symptomatic and warrant 
discontinuation (temporary or perman ent) of the contact [CONTACT_197547], but 
not limited to the following: 
x Contact [CONTACT_32985] (CLPU) 
x Significant Infiltrative Events (SIE)

x Any corneal event which necessitates te mporary lens discontinuation > 2 weeks 
 Non-Significant Adverse Events  – are defined as those events that are usually asymptomatic 
and usually do not warrant discon tinuation of contact [CONTACT_35517] a reduction in 
wear time.  However, the Investigator may choos e to prescribe treatment as a precautionary 
measure.    Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Ocular Non-Significant Adverse Events include, but not limited to the following: 
x Non-significant Infiltrative Event (NSIE)

Adverse Device Effect (ADE) – An ADE is an “adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device.” 
NOTE  1: This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, deployment, implantati on, installation, or opera tion, or any malfunction 
of the investigational medical device. 
NOTE  2: This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional 
misuse of the investiga tional medical device.[ADDRESS_608157] (UADE) – A UADE is any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the test 
article, if that effect, problem,  or death was not previously id entified in nature , severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan, Investigator’s Brochure or protocol, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with the test article that relates to the rights, safety and welfare of subjects. 
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events 
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Investigator will evaluate adverse events to ensure the events are categorized correctly. Elements of categorization will include: 
x Seriousness/Classifications (s ee definition in section 13.1). 
x Causality or Relatedness – i.e., the relationship between the test article, study treatment or study procedures, and the adverse even t (not related, unlikely related, possibly 
related, or related - see definition in section 13.2.1). 
x Adverse Event Severity – Adverse event seve rity is used to assess the degree of 
intensity of the adverse event (mild, moderate , or severe - see definition in section 0). 
x Outcome – not recovered or not resolve d, recovering or resolving, recovered or 
resolved with sequelae, recovered or reso lved, death related to adverse event, or 
unknown. 
x Actions Taken – none, temporar ily discontinued, permanently  discontinued, or other. 
13.2.1. Causality Assessment 
Causality Assessment – A determination of the relationshi p between an adverse event and the 
test article. The test article relationship for each adverse event should be determined by [CONTACT_19575]: 
x Not Related- An adverse event that is not re lated to the use of the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures. 
CR-6493, v 1.0  
Page 47 of 141JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.  
 
x Unlikely Related – An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more 
likely, e.g., concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), or the relationship of time 
suggests that a causal relationship is not likely. 
x Possibly Related – An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test article, or 
to the study treatment or study procedur es. An alternative explanation, e.g., 
concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is reasonable. Therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded. 
x Related – An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse effect (device) or adverse reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably e xplained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g., 
concomitant treatment of concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very suggestive, e.g., it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]-challenge and re-challenge. 
13.2.2. Severity Assessment 
Severity Assessment – A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adverse event 
as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The assessment of severity is made irrespective of  test article, study tr eatment or study procedure relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be eval uated according to the following scale: 
x Mild – Event is noticeable to the subject but is easily tolerated and does not interfere with the subject’s daily activities. 
x Moderate – Event is bothersome, possibl e requiring additiona l therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities. 
x Severe – Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy, 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities. 
13.3. Documentation and Follow-Up of Adverse Events 
The recording and documenting of adverse even ts (ocular and non-ocular) begin when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study tr eatment, or study procedure.  Adverse events 
reported before the use of test  article, start of st udy treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if the condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded and reported as an AE . Untoward medical even ts reported after the 
subject’s exit from the study will be recorded as  adverse events at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal In vestigator will document the condition in the 
subject record and in the eCRFs and complete the Adverse Event eCRF.    Complete descriptions of all adverse events must be available in the subject record. All Adverse Events including local and systemic re actions not meeting the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on the appropriate case report form or electronic data system. All adverse events occurring while the subject is enrolled in the study must be documented 
appropriately regardle ss of relationship.   
 It is the Investigator’s responsibility to maintain documentation of each reported adverse event. All adverse events will be followed in accordance with applicable licensing requirements. Such documentation will include the following: 
CR-6493, v 1.0  
Page 48 of 141JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.  
 
x Adverse event (diagnosis not symptom). 
x Drawings or photographs (where appropri ate) that detail the finding (e.g., size, 
location, and depth, etc.). 
x Date the clinical site was notified. 
x Date and time of onset. 
x Date and time of resolution. 
x Adverse event classification, se verity, and relationship to te st articles, as applicable. 
x Treatment regimen instituted (where appropriate), including concomitant medications 
prescribed, in accordance with applicable licensing requirements. 
x Any referral to another hea lth care provider if needed. 
x Outcome, ocular damage (if any). 
x Likely etiology. 
x Best corrected visual acuity at the discovery of the ev ent and upon conclusion of the 
event, if the AE is related to the visual system. 
 Upon discovery of an AE that is deemed ‘possibl y related’ or ‘related’ to the test article or 
study procedures (whether related to the visual system or not), an  AE review form  
must be completed. Additiona l dated and initialed entries should be made at follow-up 
evaluations. Separate forms must be completed for each eye if the AE is bilateral.  
 
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/she  will complete the Corn eal Infiltrate Assessment 
eCRF. Where necessary, a culture of the corneal lesion will be collected to determine if the infection is microbial in nature. If cultures are collected, the date of culture collection and laboratory utilized will be recorded.   Changes in the severity of an AE shall be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as intermittent require documentation of the onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the assessment of relationship to the Test Ar ticle shall also be clearly documented. 
 Subjects who present with an adverse event sh all be followed by [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have retu rned to pre-treatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolved. If further treatme nt beyond licensure is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropriate health care provider. The Investigator will use his/her clinical judgment as to whether a subject reporting with an adverse event will continue in the study. If a subject is discontinued from the study, it will be  the responsibility of the Investigator to 
record the reason for discontinuation. The Inves tigator will also document the adverse event 
appropriately and complete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjects with ongoing adverse events related to the test artic le, study treatment or study procedur es, as of the final study visit 
date, should be followed to resolu tion of the adverse event or un til referral to an appropriate 
health care provider, as recommended by [CONTACT_737]. Non-ocular adverse events that are not related to the test artic le, study treatment, or study proc edures may be recorded as 
“ongoing” without further follow-up.

13.4. Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by e-mail, facsimile, or telephone 
as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours from discovery for an y serious /significant 
adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non-significant adverse event. In addition, 
a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_35451]/IRB according to 
their requirements (section 13.4.2). The report w ill comment whether the adverse event was 
considered to be related to the test article, study tr eatment or study procedures. 
13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor 
Serious/Significant Adverse Events The Investigator will inform the sponsor of a ll serious/significant adve rse events occurring 
during the study period as soon as possible by e- mail or telephone, but no  later than [ADDRESS_608158] igator is obligated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_35519]. All 
subjects experiencing a serious/si gnificant adverse event must be  followed up and all outcomes 
must be reported.  When medically necessary, the Investigator ma y break the randomizati on code to determine 
the identity of the treatment that the subject received. The Sponsor and study monitor should be notified prior to unmas king the test articles. 
 In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Investigator must: 
x Notify the Sponsor immediately. 
x Obtain and maintain in the subject’s records all pertinent medical information and medical judgment for colleague s who assisted in the treatment and follow-up of the 
subject. 
x Provide the Sponsor with a complete case history which includes a statement as to 
whether the event was or was not related to the use of the test article. 
x Notify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_35520] C/IRB reporting procedure according to 
national regulations. 
 
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE) In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE), the Investigator will submit a report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no later 
than [ADDRESS_608159] report the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participati ng Investigators within [ADDRESS_608160]. 
 Non-Serious Adverse Events All non-serious adverse events, including non-seri ous adverse device effects, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_35521] 2 days from discovery.

13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Respon sible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities 
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reporting must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site wi ll refer to and follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_19582].  The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events  to the local health authorities according to 
the written guidelines, including reporting timelines.  
13.5. Event of Special Interest 
None. 
13.6. Reporting of Pregnancy 
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270]-report) during the study will be discontinued after the event is recorded as an Adverse Event. Once  discontinued, pregnant participants and their 
fetuses will not be monitored for study related purposes. Pregnant participants are not 
discontinued from contact [CONTACT_19583], but due to 
general concerns relating to pre gnancy and contact [CONTACT_19584]. Sp ecifically, pregnant women are 
discontinued due to fluctuations in refractive error and/or visual  acuity that occur secondary to 
systemic hormonal changes, and not due to unforeseen health risks to the mother or fetus.

14. STATISTICAL METHODS 
14.1. General Considerations 
Statistical Analysis will be undertaken by [CONTACT_35522]. A 
general description of the statistical methods to be implemented in this clinical trial is outlined 
below.   
 
All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed using the SAS software Version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
[ADDRESS_608161]/eye will be used when available for summarization and statistical analysis.  
 Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be provided for all baseline variables, efficacy variables, and safety vari ables as appropriate. Con tinuous variables will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum). Frequency count and percentage of subjects or eyes within each category will be provided for categorical data. 
14.2. Sample Size Justification 
Approximately 66 subjects will be  enrolled in this study to attain a minimum of 60 completed 
subjects. All endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics only; no confirmatory 
hypotheses will be tested. This is  a descriptive study to evaluate the clinical performance of 
the DT1fA and P1fA lenses. Sample size is not based on the empi[INVESTIGATOR_89621]. The 
data collected for this study may be used fo r designing future studies if applicable. 
14.3. Analysis Populations 
Safety Population: All subjects who are administered any test ar ticle excluding subjects who drop out prior to 
administering any test article. At l east one observation should be recorded. 
 Per-Protocol Population:  All subjects who successfully complete all visits and do not substantially deviate from the protocol as determined by [CONTACT_3433] e trial cohort review committee pr ior to database hard lock. 
Justification for the exclusion of subjects with protocol de viations from the per-protocol 
population set will be documen ted in a memo to file. 
 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population: All randomized subjects regardless of actual tr eatment and subsequent withdrawal from the 
study or deviation from the protocol. At least one observation should be recorded. 
14.4. Level of Statisti cal Significance 
No confirmatory hypothesis testi ng is planned for this study; he nce, the level of statistical 
significance is not applicable. All planned an alyses for this study will be descriptive.

Accrual Objective  130 randomized (6 5 maraviroc and 6 5 placebo)  
Study Duration  5 years (all participant s followed for 1 – 3 years depending on enrollment 
date)  
Impact of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] 6 of 91 
HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  Treatment Descripti on  Prior to transplantation, participant s should be on a  stable non-protease 
inhibitor -based regimen. At the time of transplantation, eligible participant s 
will be randomized 1:1 to add maraviroc or placebo. Initiation of study drug 
will occur during the admission for transplantation, prior to transplant.  
Arm 1: Maraviroc  
Arm 2: Placebo  
Dose: Initial dose of 300 mg twice daily  (150mg twice daily if co -prescribed 
with a potent CYP3A inhibitor or 600mg twice daily if co -prescribed with a 
potent CYP3A induc er). Will be modified  if GFR < 30, if co -prescribed with a 
potent CYP3A inhibitor or inducer, or if the calcineurin inhibitor used for 
maintenance immunosuppression is changed to cyclosporine (which is only 
allowed for tacrolimus toxicity) . Once GFR >= 30,  the dose should be returned 
to the non -renal dosage. If GFR is consistently fluctuating (especially 
immediately post -transplant), the site investigator may cho ose when to 
resume normal dosing of study products based on clinical assessment of 
stability.  
Inclusion Criteria   1) Participant is able to understand and  provide informed consent  
2) Documented HIV infection (by [CONTACT_770210], positive HIV ab IFA, or documented history of detectable HIV-1 RNA).  
 3) Participant is ≥ 18 y ears old. 
 
4) CD4+ T -cell count  >/= 200/µL at any time in the 26  weeks prior to 
enrollment . 
 
5) Most recent HIV -1 RNA  < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_268720]/mL. Eligibility at the time of 
enrollment  will be determined based on the most recent HIV -[ADDRESS_1056854] change in cART.   
 
6) Participant meets standard listing criteria for placement on transplant 
waiting list.  
 
7) For participants with an HIV+ deceased donor : 
 a) No active opportunistic infections.  
b) Concurrence  by [CONTACT_770211], viral suppression can be achieved in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282251] -
transplant.   
c) Must be enrolled in an IRB approved research protoc ol that fulfills the 
requirements of the DHHA Hope Act Policy (see section 9.1.2).  
Impact of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] 7 of 91 
HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  d) HIV+ deceased d onor must have no evidence of invasive opportunistic 
complications of HIV infection, and must have a pre -implant biopsy . 
 
8) Antiretroviral (ARV) Use: Participan t is on a stable cART regimen for at least 
3 months prior to enrollment  (unless changes are made due to toxicity, 
drug interactions, convenience or to an eligible non -protease  inhibitor -
based regimen). Switch should not be due to virologic failure.  A regim en 
consisting of 2 NTRTIs and an integrase inhibitor is preferred due to 
minimal drug interaction but any non -protease inhibitor regimen may be 
used.  
 
• If on a protease inhibitor based regimen, participant must be 
switched to a non-protease  inhibitor -based regimen based on lack 
of any prior drug resistance or antiretroviral- treatment failure, 
and be willing to remain on indefinitely unless a change is 
medically necessary. Participants who need to be switched must 
have been on a stable cART regimen for at least [ADDRESS_1056855] change in cART.  
 
• If already on a stable non -protease inhibitor- based regimen, 
participant is willing to remain on this regimen indefinitely unless a change in regimen is medically indicated .  
 
• If untreated, must initiate and be willing to remain on indefinitely a non -protease inhibitor- based antiretroviral regimen unless a 
change is medically necessary.    
 
9) No known allergy or intolerance to components of MVC or its  formulation . 
 
10) No known con traindication to MVC . 
 
11) Female participants of child- bearing potential must have a negative serum 
beta -HCG pregnancy test wi thin 30 days of randomization.  
 
Exclusion Criteria   1. Participant is c urrently on maraviroc.  
2. Participant needs multi- organ transplant . 
3. Participant has a live donor who is HIV+.  
4. Participant is unable  to switch to a non-protease  inhibitor -based cART

physical  examination or laboratory testing that are not listed above, 
which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], may pose additional risks from participation in the study, may interfere with the participant’s ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality or interpretation of the data obtained from the study.  
 
Participant  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_770141]  
1. Participant meets criteria to discontinue study treatment ( MVC  or 
placebo)  
2. The investigator no longer believes  continuing study treatment is in 
the best interest of the participant.

Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_770143]/IRB, NIAID, the 
pharmaceutical supporter(s) or designee, the FDA, or other government 
entities as part of their duties to ensure that research participants are protected.  
In addition, the incidence of specific safety -related  events of particular 
concern will be continuously monitored throughout the study to determine if 
any of their observed subject -based incidence rates exceed a threshold 
incidence rate of concern pre -specified for each particular event.  
 These events and their corresponding thresholds of concern are:  
 
1. During year 1 of follow -up, death due to any reason except accidental 
death above 10%.  
2. During year 1 of follow -up, graft loss due to any reason except 
accidental death above 16%.  
3. During year 1 of follow -up, site-reported treated acute rejection 
above 35%

HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  1 Study Hypotheses/ Objectives  
1.1 Hypotheses  
It has been established that p ersistent HIV infection leads to immune dysregulation, which is characterized by [CONTACT_770215] T cells, B cells,  and myeloid cells.  This global dysregulation can lead to augmented anti -donor 
alloimmune responses through specific expansion of donor HLA and pathogen cross -reactive cells (heterologous 
immunity) and /or non-specific expansion of effector T cells and antibody -producing B cells through homeostatic 
proliferation. CCR5 expression is increased on activated T cells, B cells, and myeloid cells and it is known to play an 
important role in orchestrating coordinated activation of immune effector functions.  In addition, CCR5 also contributes 
to the spread and maintenance of HIV reservoir by [CONTACT_6076] a receptor for HIV entry in CD4 T cells and myeloid cells, thus perpetuating and exacerbating the immune dysregulation.  Therefore, we hypothesize that CCR5 contributes to the 
enhanced alloimmune responses in HIV+ participant s and CCR5 blocka de will be effective in reducing immunologic graft 
injury and improving long -term kidney function  through reducing HIV reservoir and intercepting the vicious cycle of 
immune activation and dysregulation. Our specific hypotheses are:  
 
• CCR5 blockade  in HIV+ renal transplant participant s will minimize immunologic graft injury and improve renal 
function. The high rate of kidney transplant rejection in HIV+ patients  is due to high  frequency of heterologous 
memory donor -reactive T cells that arise in response to chronic infections  in this population which include  HIV 
and a multitude of other co- pathogens such as CMV, EBV, HCV, and HBV.  
• CCR5 blockade in combination with immunosuppressive therapy used following kidney transplantation will reduce HIV persistence in CD4+ T lymphocytes.  
1.2 Objectives  
 
1.2.1 The primary clinical objective s are to evaluate the:  
1. Impact of CCR5 blockade  (maraviroc , MVC ) on renal function  at week [ADDRESS_1056873]- transplant . 
2. Overall safety and tolerability of CCR5 blockade in the HIV+ kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]  
 
1.2.2 The secondary clinical objectives are to evaluate the:  
1. Impact of CCR5 blockade (maraviroc, MVC) on inflammation in the graft at week [ADDRESS_1056874] of CCR5 blockade on the incidence and severity of  rejection  
5. Incidence of HI V infection/ HIV nephropathy (HIVAN) in the kidney allograft  
6. Safety profiles with use of CCR5 blockade  
7. Pharmacokinetics and impact of CCR5 blockade exposure to CNIs  
 
1.2.3 The primary mechanistic objective s are to:  
1. Define immunologic parameters associated with re jection in the HIV positive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (versus HIV+ non -
rejectors )  
2. Determine the impact of CCR5 blockade on the immunologic profiles in the HIV positive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].   
 
Impact of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] [ADDRESS_1056875] unexpectedly high rejection rat es (2 -3 fold 
higher than HIV uninfected recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) [1 , 2], facilitating studies exploring the immunosuppressive efficacy of CCR5 
blockade.    
HIV persists indefinitely during cART. Many mechanisms likely contribute to this persistence, including persisten t 
immune activation and dysfunction, as well as persistent replenishment of the reservoir due to low-level HIV 
spread/replication. There are theoretical suggestions that CCR5 blockade may affect these pathways, leading to 
reduction in HIV reservoir. Carefu l measurements of HIV persistence/viral load will be performed in our study. These 
measurements are important as changes in HIV load can directly impact immune function and graft survival. Of equal 
significance, any agent that affects HIV persistence will contribute to the emerging global cure efforts.  
2.[ADDRESS_1056876] or Intervention  
CCR5 is a chemokine receptor widely expressed on immune cells, including dendritic cells, activated macrophages [3] , 
resting and activated N K cells [4], and activated Th1 and CD8 cells [5 , 6]. CCR5 plays a major role in regulating immunity 
by [CONTACT_770216]4 -CD8 T cell collaborations [7] , serving as a co -stimulatory molecule for Th1 cell activation [8] , activating 
pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages [9], and recruiting monocytes, macrophages, NK cells, and T cells to sites of 
inflammation [10].  CCR5 blockade promotes graft survival in rodent models of heart [ 11, 12], kidney [ 13], islet [ 14] and 
aorta transplantation [15]. Kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770145]5 as a consequence of a  homozygous 
CCR5  delta 32 deletion (“CCR5 -Δ 32”) have significantly prolonged long term allograft survival compared to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770146]  [16]. Similarly, liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] h omozygous for the CCR5 -Δ [ADDRESS_1056877] 
reduced acute rejection rates [ 17]. The findings collectively support the idea that CCR5 blockade using maraviroc may be 
beneficial in kidney transplantation. Consistent with this notion, a recently concluded clini cal trial in bone marrow 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770147] -versus host 
disease [18]. We hypothesize that the addition of CCR5 blockade to cART in HIV+ renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770148].  
Several lines of evidence have suggested that inhibition of CCR5 could reduce the size of the reservoir during long -term 
antiretroviral therapy. Chronic inflammation and T cell activation are now well- accepted parts of HIV pathogenesis. The 
frequency of activated T cells is high during untreated disease and declines during treatment, but it rarely fully 
normalizes. Among long-term effectively treated individuals, the frequency of activated T cells is higher than normal 
[19], which is associated with risk of disease progression [ 20], and correlated with the size of the HIV reservoir. Chronic 
inflammation may contribute to HIV viral persistence through many mechanisms, including: 1) increased HIV producti on 
from CD4+ cells; 2) increased number of activated CD4+ T cells, which are the preferred target for viral replication; 3) 
homeostatic proliferation of latently infected cells; and 4) changes in immunoregulatory environment, leading to reduced clearance m echanisms. As binding of CCR5 on T cells to its ligands regulates chemotaxis and migration to sites 
of inflammation, inhibiting CCR5 might prevent CD4+ T cells from accumulating in areas where ongoing cell -to-cell

HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  transmission of HIV occurs and alters seve ral inflammatory pathways that lead to HIV persistence [ 10, 21]. Any of these 
mechanisms may have contributed to the absence of HIV viral persistence in the “Berlin patient”, the HIV+ recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22874] a 
bone marrow transplant from a homozygous CCR5 -Δ 32  donor [22]. We hypothesize that CCR5 blockade in combination 
with immunosuppressive therapy used following kidney transplantation will reduce HIV persistence in CD4+ T lymphocytes  
The finding that HIV+ patients experience three -fold more rejection than HIV - recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770149] a n important  
clinical challenge, but also an intriguing mechanistic question which might ultimately lead to identification of novel 
interventions for the broader transplantation field .  The question which we will address in this pr otoco l is why do HIV -
infected adults - who despi[INVESTIGATOR_770150]  - mount a stronger response to 
transplanted grafts  than HIV -uninfected adults ?  The answer may lie in heterologous immunity , which is emerging as a 
central focus in transplantation biology  [23].  Experiments in animal models of transplantation demonstrate that 
multiple viral infections can induce the generation of memory allo -reactive T cells ; this occurs  as a result of cross -
reactivity between alloantigen - and pathogen -reactive T cells [ 24-30].  These cross -reactive memory T cells have a lower 
threshold for activation, can directly traffic to grafts, and are capable of expressing effector functions upon first encounter with donor antigens, all of which contr ibute to accelerated graft rejections and resistance to tolerance 
induction.  Cross -reactivity between human alloantigen and viral antigen -reactive T cell lines and clones has also been 
demonstrated [31].  However, association between increased heterologou s immunity and enhanced graft rejection in 
transplant patients has not been documented.  We hypothesize that the high rate of kidney transplant rejection in HIV+ 
patients is be due to high frequency of heterologous memory donor -reactive T cells that arise in response to chronic 
infections  in this population which include HIV and a multitude of other co -pathogens such as CMV, EBV, HCV, and HBV .  
Thus, transplantation in HIV+ patients may provide a unique opportunity to determine the importance of heterologo us 
immunity to transplant outcomes in humans.  
2.3 Preclinical Experience  
Maraviroc is a CCR5 inhibitor that has been approved for use a component of combined antiretroviral therapy (see 
Clinical Studies ).  Since CCR5 is a chemokine receptor widely expressed o n immune cells, blocking this receptor has 
theoretic benefits in terms of modulating the alloimmune response by [CONTACT_770217] -inflammatory cells 
to the allograft. Several pre -clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of CCR5 blockade in promoting allograft 
survival in rodent models of heart  [11, 12], kidney [ 13], islet [14] and aorta transplantation [ 15].  
Although maraviroc has not been approved for use as an immu nosuppressive  agent, a recently concluded trial in bone 
marrow transplan t recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770147] -versus -
host disease (20). Thirty -eight subjects who had undergone reduced -intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation were treated with standard graft- versus -host disease  (GVHD ) prophylaxis  and maraviroc 
(ClinicalTrials.gov number, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Among [ADDRESS_1056878] ic studies suggested that inhibition 
of lymphocyte trafficking  lead to prevention of GVHD . 
The potential efficacy of CCR5blockade in terms of blocking the alloimmune response in  solid organ transplantation is 
supported by [CONTACT_770218][INVESTIGATOR_770151]5 -Δ 32  allele (no cell surface 
expression of CCR5)  have  significantly prolonged long term allograft survival compared to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770152]5 ; this has been shown for both kidney  [16] and liver[ 17] transplants . The findings collectively support the idea 
that CCR5 blockade using maraviroc may be beneficial in kidney transplantation . 
 
Impact of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] [ADDRESS_1056879] viruses that enter CD4+ cells using CXCR4.  When used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs in 
subjects  known to lack CXCR4 -utilizing viruses, maraviroc is safe, well- tolerated and results in sustained suppression of 
HIV replication. Maraviroc has been approved for the management of HIV disease sine 20XX.  A recent FDA -mandated 
review of long -term (5 years) exposure to this drug in controlled studies (n=938 treated with maraviroc) found low rates 
of death , hepatic failure, malignancy, myocardial infarction and other adverse events, leading to the conclusion that the 
drug has safety provide consistent with oth er antiretroviral drugs [32]. 
Maraviroc is an oral medication that is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_770153].  The standard dose is 300 mg bid  
(without concomitant potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers .  Approximately 25% is excreted unchanged in the feces and 
33% is excreted unchanged in the urine, the rest being metabolized by [CONTACT_4852].   The drug accumulates with advanced renal or liver failure  [33].  Maraviroc is taken up by [CONTACT_770219]1 uptake transporter and the homozygous 521T>C mutation 
decreases upta ke by 75%. [34].  Maraviroc is metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P4503A4, and any concomitant medications 
that inhibit CYP3A4, such as tacrolimus, will increase maraviroc concentrations.  In one case report in a liver transplant subjects, tacrolimus AUC increased ~ 15%, while maraviroc AUC was approximately twice normal[ 35].  
With regard to our proposed study, maraviroc has no known nephrotoxicity and appears to be safe and well -tolerated in 
subjects with impaired renal function. A recent small open -label study of ma raviroc in  subjects with mild  to severe renal 
impairment  (including end- stage renal disease)  found that renal function had no readily apparent effect on  plasma 
concentration -time curve and no dosing adjustments  among those with impaired renal function[ 36]. 
 UUStudies in Healthy Volunteers  
In Phase 1 and 2a clinical studies conducted in healthy volunteers and HIV+ individuals, maraviroc has been administered as single oral doses up to 1200 mg and multiple oral doses up to 300 mg BID for 28 days, and up to 90 0 mg 
BID and 1200 mg QD for 7 days. Single doses up to 900mg and multiple doses up to 300mg BID were well tolerated, with the adverse event profile of 300mg BID being similar to placebo. Doses above 300mg ( the approved dose  dose) were 
associated with an increased incidence of adverse events, particularly postural hypotension, compared to placebo. The 
most common Adverse Events (AEs), regardless of causality, reported following single and multiple dosing have been 
asthenia, headache, dizziness, nausea, rhinitis and postural hypotension. Postural hypotension is potentially the dose limiting  adverse event  [37].  
No treatment related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were reported in the healthy volunteer (Phase 1) studies, and most AEs were judged to be mild to mod erate in severity. Mean QTcI differences from placebo for maraviroc were not 
clinically significant for single doses up to and including 900 mg.  
UUStudies in treatment- experienced subjects  with R5 HIV  
Two identical  phase 2B/[ADDRESS_1056880] been completed (MOTIVATE 1 and 2). MOTIVATE [ADDRESS_1056881] experienced mo re than six months treatment 
with three of four approved antiretroviral drug classes, (PIs, NRTIs, NNRTIs, and FIs) AND/OR resistance to at least one 
Impact of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] 23 of 91 
HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  member of three of the four approved classes of antiretroviral medications. Subjects were randomized (2:2: 1) to receive 
optimal background therapy (OBT) plus maraviroc 300 mg QD or BID (reduced to 150 mg QD/BID in presence of a PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_770154] 24 was statistically significantly greater in the OBT 
+ maraviro c QD or BID groups compared to the OBT + placebo group. These studies also demonstrated that maraviroc 
(QD or BID) had equivalent acceptable safety and tolerability profiles, without indications of increased risk of 
hepatotoxicity, secondary infection, malignancy or QTc interval prolongation, relative to placebo at an interim analysis 
conducted at 24 weeks [ 38, 39]. 
UUStudies in treatment- experienced subjects  with non -R5 HIV  
In cohort studies the detection of X4 virus has been associated with more rapid CD4  decline and HIV -1 disease 
progression. A safety study in treatment-experienced subjects  infected with non - CCR5 tropic HIV -1 (Study A4001029) 
was conducted to address the theoretical concern that giving maraviroc to a subject with dual or mixed tropic vir us 
(R5/X4) may cause a more rapid disease progression or CD4 cell loss due to the selection of X4 virus at time of virologic 
failure. Study A4001029 is an ongoing, prospective, randomized (1:1:1), double -blind, placebo controlled, multi -country, 
phase 2b c linical trial of placebo vs. a nominal dose of maraviroc 300 mg QD or BID (reduced to 150 mg QD/BID in 
presence of a PI [INVESTIGATOR_770155]) added to OBT in HIV -1-infected treatment- experienced subjects  with non -R5 virus . This 
study found  no apparent differenc es between either of the maraviroc containing groups and the placebo group in the 
reported frequency of AEs, SAEs, deaths, drug interruption or discontinuations due to AEs in A4001029. There were no differences in Grade [ADDRESS_1056882] abnormalities (AST, ALT, total bilirubin) across the three treatment groups. 
No cases of lymphoma or other HIV associated malignancies were reported in the first 24 weeks of the A4001029 trial. 
Overall, Study A4001029 demonstrated no harm and no benefit in efficacy, safety or tolerability when maraviroc in subjects infected with non -R5- tropic HIV -1 (compared to OBT + placebo).   
UUStudies in treatment- naive  subjects  with non -R5 HIV  
A registrational phase 3 study of maraviroc was performed in antiretroviral- naive subjects  with R5 HIV infection 
(maraviroc versus e favirenz in Treatment -Naive Patients , or MERIT study; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] )[40]. Treatment- naïve adults 
lacking evidence of X4 infection were randomized zidovudine/ lamivudine  with maraviroc (300 mg once or twice daily ) or 
efavirenz. The once -daily maraviroc arm was  stopped early due to lack of efficacy.  At week 48, maraviroc 300 mg bid ( n 
= 721)  was non -inferior to maraviroc in terms of proportion with an HIV RNA level below 400 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL (70.6% for 
maraviroc vs 73.1%  for efavirenz) but not for <50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL (65.3% vs 69.3%). Maraviroc was associated with high rates 
of virologic failure but lower rates of premature discontinuation for adverse events . In a post -hoc reanalysis  that used a 
very sensitive co -receptor tropi [INVESTIGATOR_770156] -level X4 viruses, the efficacy of maraviroc 
was comparable to that of efavirenz.  
UUStudies of maraviroc intensification  
Given the potential immunodulatory activity of maraviroc, a series of studies have been performed in which maraviroc was added to a stable regimen (“intensification”) to improve immune function in antiretroviral- treated adults with 
undetectable HIV RNA levels  [41-49]. These observations provide the strongest evidence that maraviroc affects imm une 
function independent of its effect on HIV replication. Several studies found that maraviroc intensification lead to reductions in CD8+ T cell activation [46 , 48, 49], but a randomized placebo -controlled study of 45 immunologic non -
responders (defined a s a persistent CD4+ T cell count below < 350 cells per mm
PP3
PP) found that compared to placebo, 
maraviroc -treated subjects experienced a greater median increase in % CD38+HLA -DR+ peripheral blood CD8+ T cells at 
week 24 (+2.2% vs - 0.7%, P = .014), and less  of a decline in activated CD4+ T cells (P < .001).  Plasma CC chemokine 
Impact of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] 24 of 91 
HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  receptor type 5 (CCR5) ligand (macrophage -inflammatory protein 1beta) levels increased 2.4 -fold during maraviroc 
intensification (P < .001)  and plasma lipopolysaccharide declined [44]. In most studies, circulating CD8+ T cell counts 
increased rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], providing strong evidence that the drug  affects trafficking of these cells [47, 50, 51].  These 
intensification studies also provided preliminary data that maraviroc intensification reduced  the size of the reservoir 
during effective cART [42, 43, 46]; this effect may be due to increased NFκB activity, which might reverse latency, leading 
to HIV production and clearance of infected cells [52]. Although the immunologic and virologic effect of maraviroc 
intensification remains  controversial, these studies  collectively indicate that the approach is safe and well- tolerated.  
UUStudies involving the use of HIV+ donors  
The data in HIV positive donors in South Africa [53] is comparable to our data using HIV negative donors in HIV positive 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] [1]. Since we do not have the appropriate data in the US comparing HIV positive to HIV negative donors, we 
compi[INVESTIGATOR_770157] . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_770158] (with HIV  positive  deceased 
donors, N=27) and HIVTR (with HIV  negative  donors, N=150) in eligibility criteria, characteristics and ARV/IS medications 
used, we compared the two studies in order to get an assessment of expected impact on the addition of HIV positive  
donors in our HIVTR -CCR5 study. The  primary efficacy endpoint in HIVTR -CCR5 is the mean GFR at week [ADDRESS_1056883]-
transplant, and in the sample size considerations section, we indicate that the expected mean GFR level at week 52 for 
the control group (Arm 2), based on the data observed in HIVTR and other post -transplant stud ies, is 60 ml/min per 1.[ADDRESS_1056884]. Muller et al.’s NEJM 2015 publication data, the mean GFR level at week 52 was 59 ml/min per 1.[ADDRESS_1056885] also compared some of the safety endpoints between the two studies. In 
HIVTR, the 1 -year patient survival was 95% (CI 90,98) while in the South African study, the 1 -year patient survival was 
84% (CI, 62,  94). The 1 -year rates of acute rejection in the HIVTR and South African studies were 29% and 8%, 
respectively.  
Graft function and safety profiles with use of HIV  positive  deceased donors in the South African experience is very 
promising [53], and with the  implementation of the HOPE Act, many centers are expected to utilize  these valuable 
organs in  their HIV+ kidney transplant candidates who would otherwise have long waiting times on the list.  
2.[ADDRESS_1056886] of maraviroc on the reservoir  
HIV persists indefinitely in essentially all antiretroviral- treated individuals. Several mechanisms contribute to 
persistence, including cell -to-cell transfer of virus (“replication”) and the establishment of latent (or quiescent) infection 
of long -lived m emory CD4+ T cells. The latter cell population is maintained in part by [CONTACT_770220].  
The eradication of the HIV -1 reservoir resulting in the cure of the Berlin Patient in 2009 and the sustained reduction of 
the HIV -1 reservoir to undetectable  levels in two infected individuals in [LOCATION_011] in 2012 by [CONTACT_770221] (HSCT) has renewed interest in novel HIV eradication strategies.  [54-57] Although many factors 
contributed to these remarkable outcomes, it is noteworthy  that all three individuals were het erozygous for the 
CCR5Δ32 mutation at baseline. This common genetic feature of the three individuals provides evidence that 
predisposition to HIV eradication may be linked to lower CCR5 cell surface expression.  Given the central role of CCR5 in 
HIV-replication and the intriguing observations in the Berlin and [LOCATION_011] patients, we  measured cellular HIV- [ADDRESS_1056887] DNA, cell-associated HIV- 1 RNA, and immunologic cell surface markers in 18 CCR5 delta- 32 heterozygotes and 
54 CCR5 wild type individuals  on suppressive antiretroviral therapy. While no difference was observed in HIV -1 pol DNA 
levels, cell-associated HIV- 1 RNA (p=0.035), RNA:DNA transcriptional ratios (p=0.013), and frequency of detectable [ADDRESS_1056888] DNA (p=0.013) were significantly lower  in CD4+ T cells from CCR5 delta- 32 heterozygotes. Cell -associated HIV- 1

HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  3 Study Design  
 
3.1 Description of Study Design   
This trial is a prospective, multi- center, double- blind phase II study of kidney transplantation in HIV+ in dividuals 
assessing the safety and efficacy of maraviroc  or placebo  given post -transplant.   Participants must be stable HIV-
infected adults in need of a kidney transplant  who are on a non -protease inhibitor- based antiretroviral drug regimen . If 
not, parti cipant must be willing and able to modify  their antiretroviral regimen . This change will be initiated by [CONTACT_2416] ’s primary care provider at the request of the study team, and will occur prior to  enrollment into the pre -
transplant phase of the study  (segment A). Randomization to maraviroc or placebo and enrollment into the post -

system. 
Impact of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] 29 of 91 
HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  3.5.1 Procedure for Unblinding/Unmasking  
Requests can be made to unblind subjects, on a case -by-case basis immediately for emergencies or urgent situations. 
Requests should be communicated to the Project Manager o r the EMMES data center, who will then contact [CONTACT_770227]  (See Manual of Procedures  for contact [CONTACT_3031] ). Requests will be reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_326255]  (including the  Medical Officer) , and the IND holder as appropriate, unless an immediate life 
threatening condition has developed and the Operations Committee  are not accessible .  In that case, the site 
investigator will notify the Project Manager or EMMES data center  of the unblinding event on the next business day.  
All unblinding will be reported to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ).  
Unblinding information should be shared with as few individuals as possible. The unblinding information is shared only 
on a need -to-know basis.   
A full account of the event will be recorded, including the date and time of the unblinding, the reason for the decision to 
unblind, and the name  [CONTACT_770281]. The reasons for unblinding of a participant’s treatment will be included in the final study report.  
 
Impact of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] [ADDRESS_1056896] on the alloimmune response is in HIV -infected patients undergoing kidney 
transplantation as maraviroc is known to be well -tolerated in this population. This is particularly relevant since  
unexpectedly high rejection rates (2 -3 fold higher than HIV uninfected recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) were  reported following kidney 
transplantation in HIV positive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. If the unexpectedly high rejection rates seen in HIV -infected patients undergoing 
kidney transplantation can be reduced, the approach could lead to benefits for all kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. In addition, 
CCR5 inhibition may play a role in reducing HIV persistence for participant s on long -term antiretroviral therapy for HIV 
infection.    
4.[ADDRESS_1056897] meet all 
inclusion and exclusion criteria before being  enrolled into segment A (pre- randomization) and at the time of enrollment 
into segment B (randomization  and study drug initiation ).  
1. Participant  is able to understand and  provide informed consent  
2. Documented HIV infection (by [CONTACT_770228], positive HIV ab IFA, or 
documented history of detectable HIV -1 RNA).  
3. Participant  is ≥ 18 years old.  
4. CD4+ T -cell count  >/= 200/µL at any time  in the [ADDRESS_1056898] recent HIV- 1 RNA  < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_268720]/mL . Eligibility at the time of enrollment  will be determined based on the most 
recent HIV -[ADDRESS_1056899].  
7. For participants with an HIV+ deceased donor:  
a) No active opportunistic infections.  
b) Concurrence  by [CONTACT_770229], viral suppression can be achieved in the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_282251] -transplant.   
c) Must be enrolled in an IRB approved research protocol that fulfills the requirements of the DHHA Hope Act 
Policy (see section 9.1.2).  
d) HIV+ deceased d onor must have no evidence of invasive opportunistic complications of HIV infection, and must 
have a pre -implant biopsy . 
8.  Antiretroviral (ARV) Use : Participant  is on a stable cART regimen for at least 3 months prior to enrollment (unless 
changes are made due to toxicity, drug interactions, convenience  or to an eligible non -protease  inhibitor -based 
regimen ). Switch should not be due to virologic failure.  A regimen consisting of 2 NTRTIs and an integrase inhibitor is 
preferred due to minimal drug interaction but any non -protease inhibitor regimen may be used.  
 
• If on a non -protease  inhibitor based regimen, participant  must be switch ed to a non-protease  inhibitor -
based regimen based on lack of any prior drug resistance or antiretroviral- treatment failure , and be willing 
to remain on indefinitely  unless a change is medically necessary .  . Participant s who ne ed to be switched 
must have been on a stable cART regimen for at least [ADDRESS_1056900] of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] [ADDRESS_1056901] change in cART.  
 
• If already on a stable non -protease inhibitor -based regime n, participant  is willing to remain on this regimen 
indefinitely  unless a change in regimen is medically indicated.   
 
• If untreated, must initiate  and be willing to remain on indefinitely  a non-protease inhibitor -based  
antiretroviral regimen unless a change  is medically necessary . 
 
9. No known allergy or intolerance to components of MVC or its formulation . 
10. No known contraindication to MVC . 
11. Female participant s of child -bearing potential must have a negative serum beta -HCG pregnancy test within 30 days of 
rando mization .    
4.3 Exclusion Criteria   
19T19TIndividuals who meet any of these criteria are not eligible for enrollment as study participants:  
1. Participant  is currently on maraviroc.  
2. Participant  needs multi-organ transplant. 
3. Participant has a live donor who is H IV+. 
4. Participant  is unable  to switch to non-protease  inhibitor -based cART regimen.  
5. Participant  has received immunosuppressant medication in the 6 months prior to enrollment . Note: Low dose 
maintenance steroids (</= 10 mg per day of prednisone, or equivalent strength steroid) will not be considered 
immunosuppression.  
6. Opportunistic Complication History: Any history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  (PML), chronic intestinal cryptosporidiosis of > 1 month duration, or primary CNS lymphoma. Note: History of pulmonary 
coccidiodomycosis will be treated per local site policy regarding this infection in HIV negative transplant candidates, generally requiring a 5 -year disease -free interval.  
7. Participant  has a history of any neoplasm except for the following: resolved  kaposi’s sarcoma, in situ  anogenital 
carcinoma, adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, solid tumors (except primary CNS lymphoma) treated with curative therapy and disease free for more than 5 years. History of renal cell carcinoma requires disease free state for 2 years. History of leukemia and disease -free duration will be per site policy.  
8. Substance use that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_770162].  
9. Participant  is pregnant or breastfeeding . Note: Participant s who become pregnant post -transplant will continue to be 
followed in the study and will be managed per local site practice. Women that become pregnant should not 
breastfeed . 
10. Participant  has used IL -[ADDRESS_1056902] or current medical problems or findings from  medical history,  physical examination or laborato ry testing that 
are not listed above, which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], may pose additional risks from participation in the study, may interfere with the participant’s ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality or int erpretation of the data obtained from the study.   
Impact of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] [ADDRESS_1056903]  marketing. These events occurred approximately one month after starting 
treatment. Among reported cases of hepatitis, some wer e observed in the absence of allergic features or with no pre -
existing hepatic disease.  
Hepatic laboratory parameters including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin 
should be obtained prior to starting maraviroc  and at other time points during treatment as clinically indicated. If rash or 
symptoms or signs of hepatitis or allergic reaction develop, hepatic laboratory parameters should be monitored and 
discontinuation of treatment should be considered.  
Caution should be used when administering maraviroc  to patients with pre- existing liver dysfunction or who are 
coinfected with viral hepatitis B or C. The safety and efficacy of maraviroc  have not been specifically studied in patients 
with significant underlying liver disorders.  
Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions  
Severe, potentially life -threatening skin and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking maraviroc , 
in most cases concomitantly with other drugs associated with these reactions. These include cases of Stevens -Johnson 
syndrome (SJS), toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] (TEN), and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). The cases were characterized by [CONTACT_770230], constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue maraviroc  and other suspected agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin or 
hypersensitivity reactions develop. Delay in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_770163] a life -threatening reaction. Clinical status, including liver aminotransferases, should be monitored and 
appropriate therapy initiated.  
Cardiovascular events  
Use with caution in patients at increased risk of cardiovascular events, because cardiovascular events, including 
myocardial ischemia and/or infarction, were observed in treatment -experienced and treatment- naïve patients who 
received maraviroc . Caution should be used when administering maraviroc  in patients with a history of postural 
hypotension or who receive concomitant medication known to lower blood pressure. Patients should be advised that if they experience dizziness while receiving maraviroc , they should avoid driving or operating machinery.  
Postural hypotension in patients wi th renal impairment  
Maraviroc  should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment or end -stage renal disease (ESRD) (CrCl <30 
mL/min) who are taking potent CYP3A inhibitors or inducers due to an increased risk of postural hypotension as a result 
of increased maraviroc  exposure in some patients.
 
Maraviroc  should be used in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD only if they are not receiving a concomitant 
potent CYP3A inhibitor or inducer and no alternative treatment options are available. If patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD not receiving a concomitant potent CYP3A inhibitor or inducer experience any symptoms of postural hypotension while taking maraviroc  [ADDRESS_1056904] of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] 33 of 91 
HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  Immune reconstitution syndrome  
Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, 
including maraviroc . Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain -Barré syndrome) have 
also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and 
can occur many months after initiation of treatment.  
Potential risk of infection  
Maraviroc  antagonizes the CCR5 coreceptor located on some immun e cells, and therefore, could potentially increase the 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_48947]. Patients should be monitored closely for evidence of infection while receiving maraviroc . 
Potential risk of malignancy  
While no increase in malignancy has been observed w ith maraviroc , due to this drug's mechanism of action, it could 
affect immune surveillance and lead to an increased risk of malignancy. Long -term follow -up is needed to more fully 
assess this risk.  
5.2 Risks of Study Procedures  
5.2.1 Collection of Blood:  
Collectio n of blood may cause slight discomfort, pain, bleeding or bruising at the injection site.  Rarely, fainting or 
infection may occur.  
5.2.2 Kidney Biopsy:  
The most frequent complication s of a biopsy include pain and hematuria (blood in the urine).  
5.2.[ADDRESS_1056905] will be permitted to enter data.  There is risk, although minimal, of unauthorized persons obtaining confidential information.  
5.3 Participant r isks associated with kidney transplant from HIV+ donors  
5.3.1 Acute Rejection (AR).  
HIV+ recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770164] 2 -4 fold higher rates of AR, in both the NIH HIV Multisite Study [1] and in the 
national experience  [62]. This may be due to drug-interactions between immunosuppression and antiretroviral therapy 
or due to a dysregulated immune system from HIV infection.  Proposed interventions to addres s this include avoiding 
ritonavir- containing ART and induction immunosuppression. It is unknown whether AR rates will be increased in HIV -to-
HIV transplantation.  
5.3.2 Recurrent HIV -Associated Nephropathy (HIV -AN).   
There has been concern about HIV -AN recurrenc e after transplant; this occurred in 38% of HIV+ recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770165] - 
donors in a French cohort [ 63] but was not observed in the NIH Multisite study  [1]. In South  Africa, histologic changes 
consistent with HIV -AN without graft dysfunction were observed in  3 of 27 patients  [53].  This risk needs to be better 
understood.  
 
Impact of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] [ADDRESS_1056906] been observed in nearly 40% of HIV+ recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770165] - donors although 
opportunistic infections (OI) were very  rare (<10%)  [1]. Whether the use of HIVDD will be associated with an increased 
risk of standard OI is unknown.   
5.3.4  HIV superinfection (HIV -SI).   
HIV+ recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770166], i.e. acquire a second, new HIV strain from the donor. 
Super infection occurs at varying rates in populations with differing modes of transmission, including intravenous drug 
use (IVDU) and sexual transmission [64 -66].  Although HIV+ transplant candidates are on ART [ 67], and HIV -SI is thought 
to occur rarely on fully suppressive ART, there is concern of increased risk of HIV -SI with an HIVDD because (i) the viral 
inoculum that occurs with transplant is likely higher than with IVDU or sexual transmission, (ii) if an HIVDD is infected 
with an ART resistant or X4 tropic virus, this might not be suppressed by [CONTACT_305728]+ recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s ART regimen [ 68, 69], and 
(iii) stably integrated HIV -infected resting CD4+ T- cells may be transplanted.  Additionally, ART regimens in HIV+ 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770167]- boosted prote ase inhibitors (PIs) [ 70]. However, PIs are potent and often required 
to treat drug resistant virus [ 71]. 
5.[ADDRESS_1056907] on the transplant alloimmune response is in HIV infected patients 
undergoing kidney transplantation and who are already on cART (combination antiretroviral therapy).  Potential benefits 
include:  
• Reduction in the incidence of a lloimmune rejection  
• Improvement in long term allograft function by [CONTACT_770231] -inflammatory  cells to the allograft  
• Reduction in the size of the HIV reservoir by [CONTACT_83541]5 blockade combined with immunosuppression.  
 If CCR5 blockade decreases immunologic graft injury and improves long- term kidney allograft function in HIV infected 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], this strategy could be applied to HIV uninfected recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Any impact found on HIV persistence could lead to further research of CCR5 blockade and immunosuppr ession on the eradication of HIV.

Participant s will be randomized to receive maraviroc or placebo in addition to their non -protease inhibitor- based cART 
regimen. In general, the first dose of study drug will be administered upon admission for transplantation, prior to 
transplant . Study drug and placebo will be provided by [CONTACT_350800] . Since the study drug is being administered to assess 
reduction in immune -mediated graft injury  and is not intended as a component of antiretroviral regimen, viral tropi[INVESTIGATOR_770168]5 status is not required. However, CCR5 tropi[INVESTIGATOR_770169].  
6.1 Study Treatment 
Study Treatment for Arm 1 participants is maraviroc plus a non-protease inhibitor -based combination antiretroviral 
therapy (cART).  Study Treatment for Arm 2 participants is placebo for maraviroc plus non -protease inhibitor -based 
combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).  The cART is required but it will not be prov ided through the study.  
The study -provided drugs are maraviroc and placebo for maraviroc.   
All participants will be followed for at least [ADDRESS_1056908] participant.

Decision to use maraviroc 300 mg bid  
Although the general recommendations for maraviroc dosing when given with cytochrome P450 inhibitors such as CNIs, 
or with participant s with m oderate reduction in renal function is 150 mg bid  
(https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Maraviroc%20%28Selzentry%29%20PI%20dated%20July%202018.pdf  UU39T39T), in 
the study of CCR5 blockade by [CONTACT_770232], the dose needed to reach the 100 ng/mL av erage concentration  level for the 
study was 300 mg bid (see figure  2 below). [18]  For this reason, we have decided to use 300 mg bid.  
 
Figure 2: Maraviroc plasma concentrations as determined in 13 patients (300 mg twice daily [bid], n=6; 150 mg twice 
daily, n=7) on day 0 and day 12 at 0 (pre -dose), 1, 2, 3, 4, [ADDRESS_1056910] Disease. Plasma levels were determined by [CONTACT_5019] -performance liquid 
chromatography – tandem mass spectrometr y.  
In the study above, all of these participants were on voriconazole, which inhibits the enzyme that metabolizes 
maraviroc, thereby [CONTACT_770233]. In our previous studies, when giving two drugs that potently interact with each other, we either  made sure that the participants always took their medications together, or we asked them to take 
the medications at least 4 hours apart, since that seems to decrease the degree of intestinal enzymatic inhibition. [ 72]

inducer,  or if the calcineurin inhibitor used for maintenance immunosuppression is changed to cyclosporine (which is 
only allowed for tacrolimus toxicity) . Once GFR >= 30, the dose should be returned to the non -renal dosage. If GFR is 
consistently fluctuating (especially immediately post -transplant), the site investigator may c hoose when to resume 
normal dosing of study products based on clinical assessment  of stability.

HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  7 Clinical Management Issues  
7.1 Toxicity Management  
Only toxicities related to study medications provided through this study (MVC, placebo)  will be conside red in the toxicity 
management section. The grading system is located in the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and 
Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table), Corrected Version 2.1 , July 2017 , located at the DAIDS RSC Web Site: 
39TUhttps://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical- research -sites/daids -adverse -event- grading -tables U39T 
For toxicities potentially attributed to the study medication , the study medication (or the matching placebo) may be 
held.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_1056915] should be encouraged to complete follow -up protocol study evaluations.  
NOTE: If subjects discontinue study medications due to Grade [ADDRESS_1056916] of care. Discontinuation of 
study medication may be necessary. Consultation with the Operations Committee  is encouraged. If study medication(s) 
are discontinued the subject should be re evaluated weekly until the AE stabilizes, returns to ≤Grade [ADDRESS_1056917] of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] [ADDRESS_1056918] or ALT Elevations  
All study medication may be continued for asymptomatic ≤Grade [ADDRESS_1056919]/ALT elevations, at the discretion of the site 
investigator. Careful assessments should be done to rule out the use of alcohol , non -study medication -related toxicity, 
or viral hepatitis (including viral hepatitis complicated by [CONTACT_604877]) as the cause 
of Grade 3 elevations.  
For symptomatic Grade 3 ( fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant  pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or 
eosinophilia)  or any Grade [ADDRESS_1056920] or ALT, all study medication should be held and the Operations 
Committee should be consulted.  In addition, for  ALT ≥[ADDRESS_1056921] and bilirubin ≥1.[ADDRESS_1056922] (attempts should be made to 
fractionate the bilirubin), the study medications should be held and the Operations Committee  consulted as this will 
likely result in permanent study medication discontinuat ion. 
Participants  who develop symptomatic Grade [ADDRESS_1056923] or ALT elevation should be followed weekly until 
stabilization or resolution to ≤Grade 2.   Subjects will be followed off study treatment, on study after study medication 
discontinuation.  
Subjects with Grade [ADDRESS_1056924] or ALT elevation with fever, rash or eosinophilia should stop all study medications and not be re -challenged. These individuals should be followed weekly until  stabilization or resolution to ≤Grade 2 elevation 
and should be f ollowed off study treatment, on study.  
In consultation with the Operations Committee , careful assessments should be done to rule out the use of alcohol, non -
study medication -related toxicity, or viral hepatitis (including viral hepatitis complicated by [CONTACT_770235]) as the cause of Grade [ADDRESS_1056925]/ ALT elevations. Evaluations to be considered (but are not 
required) include:  
•
         Viral hepatitis serology including: Hepatitis A IgM antibody; Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis B Core 
Antibody (IgM); Hepatitis C RNA; Hepatitis E IgM antibody; 
•         Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody;  
•         Epstein -Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if unavailable, obtain heterophile antibody or monospot testing);  
•         Syphilis screening;  
•         Drugs of abuse screen including alcohol;  
•         Serum acetaminophen test (APAP adduct test);  
•         Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH);  
•         Anti-nuclear antibody, anti -smooth muscle antibody, and Type 1 anti -liver kidney microsomal antibodies;  
•         Liver imaging to evaluate liver disease.  
7.1.5       Calculated Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) Decline  
Non -study medications should be adjusted for decline in CrCl at the discretion  of the primary provider per the standard 
of care.  
 
MVC dose will be modified for CrCl <30 mL/min. See section 6.2.[ADDRESS_1056926] of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] [ADDRESS_1056927] the site investigator immediately if there is any worsening of symptoms or if further 
systemic signs or symptoms develop. Antihistamines, topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], or antipruritic agents may be prescribed.   
Subjects with ≥Grade [ADDRESS_1056928] also 
been reported in subjects taking MVC.  
Subjects with an isolated Grade 1 rash may continue study medication at the site investigator’s discretion. The subject should be ad vised to contact [CONTACT_604879], if any systemic signs 
or symptoms worsen, or if mucosal involvement develops.  
Subjects may continue study medications for an isolated Grade 2 rash. However, study med ications  should be 
permanently discontinued for any ≥Grade [ADDRESS_1056929] the site investigator immediately if rash fails to resolve (after more than two weeks), if there is any worsening of the rash, if any systemic signs or allergic symptoms develop, or if mucosal involvement develops.  
Subjects should permanently discontinue study medications for an isolated Grade [ADDRESS_1056930] will be 
followed off study treatment, on study. Subjects should be treated as cli nically appropriate and followed until resolution 
of the AE.  
If the etiology of the rash can be definitely diagnosed as being unrelated to study medications and due to a specific 
medical event or a concomitant non -study medication, routine management should be performed and documentation 
of the diagnosis provided.  
All cases of rash should also be reported as an adverse event in the EMMES IDES, regardless of grade.  
7.1.9  HIV Persistent Virologic Failure  
HIV persistent virologic failure defined as a HIV viral load > 1000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL for more than 90 days that is not the result 
of an investigator/physician approved interruption in antiretroviral treatment should also be recorded as an adverse event in the EMMES IDES, regardless of grades.

HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  8 Other Medications  
8.1 Combination Antiretroviral Therapy (cART)  
Unless a change is deemed necessary by [CONTACT_770236], a ll subjects must be on  a stable non -protease inhibitor- based 
maintenance cART regimen . An integrase inhibitor based regimen consisting of [ADDRESS_1056933] of care and may  include tacrolimus, mycophe nolate mofetil 
(MMF), and prednisone. Tacrolimus will be the first line calcineurin inhibitor. In the event of toxicity, cyclosporine A 
and/or sirolimus can be substituted or added. Refer to Manual of Procedures for details on the Risk Evaluation Managemen t Strategy (REMS) for any participant using mycophenolate mofetil as part of maintenance 
immunosuppression.  Induction with an IL -2 receptor inhibitor (anti -CD25 antibody) may be utilized and is preferred , but 
lympho depletion with thymoglobulin may be  used  as induction if deemed clinically indicated by [CONTACT_55794] . 
Immunosuppressant doses will be modified to obtain routine trough levels standard for kidney transplants.   See the 
Manual of Procedures  for more detail  
8.2.1 Rejection Treatment Protocol  
A biopsy will be performed in all cases of suspected rejection ( see the Manual of Procedures for the  definition of kidney 
rejection).  Treatment for rejection for > 1 day, including increases in the dose of immunosuppressive medications, 
cannot be sustained w ithout a biopsy, unless the managing physicians believe biopsy is unsafe.  However, therapy may 
be initiated </= one day prior to the results of the biopsy if clinically indicated. Treatment of rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_770170]. Polyclonal anti-lymphocyte preparations have resulted in 
prolonged reduction in CD4+ counts in HIV infected transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and there use should be restricted to 
treatment for moderate to severe rejection.  TOR inhibitor age nts may be added to maintenance regimens per site 
discretion.  
8.2.2 Definition of Rejection

HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  9 Study Procedures  
9.1 Screening/Baseline Visit  
Centers will identify potential study participants which are HIV+ kidney transplant candidates who are listed for 
transplant.  Th e research study will be explained in lay terms to each potential research participant , and t he 
potential participant will sign an informed consent form before undergoing any study procedures . 
During the screening period  for study eligibility , the study personnel will review the p articipant ’s medical record for 
previous and current medical history, perform a physical examination, and record  the participant ’s demographic 
information. Screening tests indicated on the schedule of events with footnote [ADDRESS_1056936] .  
The following procedures, assessments, and laboratory measures will be conducted  or recorded  for the baseline 
screening visit (after consent has been obtained):  
• Symptom & medical review plus physical exam 
• Record [COMPANY_003] (or chest x -ray if history of positive [COMPANY_003])  
• Record Vaccination review (Pn eumovax, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B)  
• Record Chest x -ray result if available  
• Record Safety labs  
• Record CD4+ T -cell count  
• Record HIV-1 RNA  
• Record s erologies (CMV Ab, EBV Ab, hepatitis B and C)  
The following procedures will be conducted as part of the research protocol:  
• Research specimens for mechanistic studies:  the collection of all baseline/screening samples are  not 
necessarily drawn  at initial screening for the study  when all other screening laboratory measures and 
procedures are performed. All baseline/screening research specimens (blood , urine) should be collected on the 
day of transplant (day 0, visit 2) if they were not previously collected in the three months prior to transplant , 
and no more than [ADDRESS_1056937] sign an informed consent document prior to any invasive procedures.  The living donor’s decision to 
participate or not to participate in this study will not be disclosed to the re cipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  
9.1.2 HIV+ donors  
Participants who utilize an HIV+ donor must be co -enrolled in an IRB approved research protocol that fulfills the 
requireme nts of the DHHS Hope Act Policy which can be found at 
https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/11/25/2015 -[ZIP_CODE]/final -human -immunodeficiency -virus -hiv-organ -

HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  9.2 Participant Enrollment  
Once a participant  has met all study inclusion and exclusion criteria, the participant  will be assigned a unique 
participant number and will be enroll ed into the Pre- Transplant (segment A) phase of the study using the EMMES 
IDES while waiting for organ availability. Enrollment into the Post -Transplant (segment B) phase of the study will 
occur on the day of transplant.  
9.[ADDRESS_1056938] been enrolled into the Pre- Transplant (segment A) phase of the EMMES IDES, it is 
recommended that  CD4+ T -cell count and HIV RNA viral load results be regularly obtained from the primary medical 
provider every [ADDRESS_1056939] of care . This will help 
ensure documented eligibility if an organ becomes available.  
If the participant  is no longer eligible for transplant or for segment B of the stu dy, or wishes to withdraw from the 
study, the reason(s) will be recorded on the appropriate case report form. Participant s in segment A may fluctuate 
between eligibility and ineligibility  for segment B, but must meet study eligibility at the time of organ availability. 
Participant s who withdraw their consent prior to transplant will be terminated from this study with no additional 
follow -up necessary.  
9.[ADDRESS_1056940] -Transplant Study Visits  
 
Segment B s tudy visits will occur a t day 0, weeks 1 , 2, 4, 8, 13 (month 3),  26 (month 6) , 39 (month 9) , 52 (year 1) , 78 
(year 1.5) , 104 (year 2) , 130 (year 2.5),  and week 156 (year 3) . At each study visit, a clinical evaluation and physical 
examination will focus on signs and symptoms suggestive of HIV disease progression, impaired allograft function, 
and rejection. Clinical evaluation will concentrate on symptoms and  examination findings of the oropharynx, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiac, gastrointestinal, skin, lymphatic and nervous system. Monitoring of orthostatic blood pressure 
should occur during all post -transplant visits to monitor possible hypotension. CD4+ T cell numbers and percent, 
and quantitative HIV -[ADDRESS_1056941] and enter data into the web based data system, including 
medications, adverse events (AE’s)/serious adverse events (SAE’s), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], infections, and standard of care 
labs.  
Although it is preferred that all post -transplant study visits occur at the transplant center, only the visits on weeks 4, 
13, 26, 52, and 104 (when specimen will be collected for mechanistic assays) must occur at the transplant center. If 
the participant  is unable to return to the transplant center for any post -transplant study visit, a complete medical 
review should be conducted by [CONTACT_756]. In addition, all necessary lab work as outlined in the Schedule of Events 
should be performed locally at a CLIA- certified laboratory and the results sent to the transplant center for data 
entry along with the associated normal laboratory reference ranges.  
In addition , the following research procedures will be performed : 
• Protocol Biopsy : A protocol biopsy w ill be performed at [ADDRESS_1056942] of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] 46 of 91 
HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  • Iohexol clearance : Samples for iohexol study at week 52 (year 1) will be collected (2, 3 and 4 hours), 
processed, and shipped to the central repository where they will be stored and then analyzed in batch.  
• Collection  of research bloods : Research blood will be obtained pre-transplant and  at weeks  4 (month 1) , 13 
(month 3) , 26 (month 6) , 52 (year 1), and 104 (year 2) . Research blood will also be collected at the time of 
kidney rejection.  These research specimens will be used primarily for the mechanistic aims of the study. 
However, some of the samples will be batch tested to address the secondary  clinical aims of the trial, 
including:  
o cystatin C (months 3, 6, 9, years 1, 2, 3)  
o HLA antibodies (pre transplant, month 6, and at time of rejectio n) 
o KIR typi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (pre transplant)  
• Collection of urine: 50ml – 100ml urine will be obtained at baseline, week 26 (month 6), week 52 (year 1). 
Urine will also be collected at the time of biopsy for suspected kidney rejection. Urine will be processed and 
banked at the central repository for future studies to look for HIV DNA and RNA levels if HIVAN is present 
and funding becomes  available. 
• Pharmacokinetic Studies : Pharmacokinetic studies will be done on  the first  twenty  UCSF participant s (or all 
UCSF participant s if accrual is < 20)  enrolled in trial at [ADDRESS_1056943] - transplant. PK studies will also be 
repeated on all UCSF participant s if the calcineurin inhibitor used for maintenance immunosuppression is 
changed to cyclosporine (which is allowed only for tacrolimus toxicity).  PK studies would be done in the 
UCSF Parnassus clinical research center.  After an overnight fast, participant s would be admitted in the 
morning for a [ADDRESS_1056944] point between the target date and the subsequent study visit. For example, the week 
26 visit may occur up to week 31 [eg 26 + (36 – 26)/2 = 31].

HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  10  Mechanistic Assays  
  
Mechanistic studies will be performed on blood samples  collected pre-transplant , and  mon ths 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 , and at time 
of suspected kidney rejection, and on kidney biopsies collected at 6 months and time of suspected rejection.  The aims 
of the mechanistic studies are:  to define  the impact of maraviroc on immune function and HIV persistenc e, to 
characterize the degree of  immune dysregulation in HIV+ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840],  and to define immunological parameters 
associated with rejection .  Comparisons will be made between those receiving maraviroc and placebo, and between  
transplant rejectors  and non -rejectors . 
The goal s of the mechanistic investigations associated with this trial are twofold:   
1. To determine the impact of immunosuppression and antiretroviral therapy with CCR5 blockade on HIV persistence in HIV+ recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] . 
2. To investigate cellul ar basis for enhanced graft rejection in HIV  (+) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770172]+ recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
Assays designed to achieve these goals are described below in this section.  
10.1 Samples  
 
All recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770173]. 
10.1.1 Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29038]:  
 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)  will be processed from heparinized peripheral blood and EDTA  samples  
collected at pre -transplant, 1, 3, 6, 12 , and 24 months after transplant  and at the time of rejection .  The samples will be 
stored in aliquots as live cells in cryopreservation medium in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen.   
Whole blood  samples collected at pre -transplant , month 6, and at the time of rejection for gene expression a nalysis will 
be collected directly into Paxgene tubes.  
Serum samples will be collected pre -transplant, month 6, and  at the time of rejection using serum separation tubes and 
stored in - 80 PPo
PPC freezers in aliquots.   
Plasma samples will be collected at pre-transplant, 1, 3, 6, 12 , and 24 months after transplant . 
Urine  samples will be collected at baseline, week 26 (month 6), week 52 (year 1) . Urine will also be collected at the time 
of biopsy for suspected kidney rejection. Samples will be processed  into s upernatant and pellet  and banked  at central 
repository . 
Lymph node  (LN) samples will be collected during transplant and transferred in sterile organ preservation solution to 
processing laboratory. LN cells will be released using mechanical disruption.  The  cells will be cryopreserved in aliquots 
using the same protocol used for PBMC . 
Graft biopsy  samples will be collected at [ADDRESS_1056945] of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] 48 of 91 
HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  10.1.2 Donor samples:   
Splenocytes from cadaveric donors or blood from living donors will also be collected at the time of the transplant ation , 
processed into splenocytes or PBMC, and banked as live cells in liquid nitrogen tanks.   
10.2 HIV persistenc e analyses  
 
UHighly sensitive and quantitative assay to measure replication competent HIV in T cell subsets in blood and tissues: U 
Given the extremely low frequency of reservoir cells in virally suppressed participant s, precisely measuring the 
magnitude of  the reservoir is challenging. HIV -1 proviral DNA and cell- associated RNA can be accurately quantified to 
provide a measurement of the total HIV burden. However, as the majority of the viral genomes detected in resting CD4 PP+
PP 
T cells are defective, PCR b ased assays for HIV DNA overestimate the size of the replication competent  reservoir (i.e., 
those variants which can support HIV replication in absence of therapy) [ 73]. Conversely, standardized viral outgrowth 
assay s (VOA) , which measure the cell -associat ed replication competent HIV pool , provide only minimal estimate s of the 
frequency of resting CD4 PP+
PP T cells harboring replication competent HIV [74]. Also, the VOA approach requires large 
numbers of freshly collected cells and is both expensive and time consuming [ 75]. These assays are not amenable to 
large studies such as th e one proposed by [CONTACT_404976].  
Drs. Nicholas  Chomont  (consultant in this trial)  and his colleagues have developed a novel assay that measures the 
frequency of cells harboring inducible  HIV without the limitations of the VOAs . By [CONTACT_770238] -spliced RNA ( msRNA ) upon stimulation together with a limiting dilution assay, the “Tat/Rev Induced Limiting 
Dilution Assay (TILDA)  quantifies the  frequency of cells  harboring transcriptionally silent – but nonetheless inducible – 
viruses. This assay  can be performed with less than a million CD4 PP+
PP T cells , as described below .  
UCell associated HIV RNA measurements  by [CONTACT_770239]: U The frequency of cells with HIV multipl y spliced (ms) RNAs  will be 
measured  upon activation  in CD4+ T cells by [CONTACT_770240]. Chomont (Fig. 3). While 
unspliced HIV RNAs are frequently detected in latently infected cells in the absence of viral production, HIV msRNAs 
(tat/rev) reflect active viral production [76, 77]. These assays will take advantage of this unique feature of msRNAs in a 
limiting dilution assay to measure the frequency of cells with inducible HIV upon maximal stimulation in CD4 PP+
PP T cells 
from  the blood. Briefly, isolated CD4 PP+
PP T cells will be stimulated for 12 hours with PMA/ionomycin. Serial dilution of the 
stimulated cells will be distributed in a 96 well plate (4 dilutions, 12 replicates each), lysed, and immediately used for RT -
PCR. msR NAs will be quantified by [CONTACT_555586] [ 76, 78] and using the maximum likelihood method, the frequency of 
cells harboring inducible HIV msRNAs in CD4 T cells will be calculated. These experiments will determine if maraviroc leads to a reduction in the size of the latent (but inducible) HIV reservoir.

stimulated cells are distributed in a [ADDRESS_1056946] of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] 49 of 91 
HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  In preliminary studies , the frequency of cells with inducible HIV RNA in CD4 PP+
PP T cells from [ADDRESS_1056947] 3 years  was measured  and compared  to frequencies wit h integrated HIV DNA. The preliminary 
data indicate that values obtained with the two assays were strongly correlated (p = 0.002, Fig. 4A). However, the 
frequency of cells harboring integrated HIV DNA significantly exceeded the frequency of cells producing  HIV RNA upon 
stimulation (median fold = 4.5, Fig. 4B). This indicated that the majority of cells harboring integrated HIV DNA do not 
produce viral RNA upon stimulation. These results confirm that the majority of HIV genomes are not replication 
competent  [73] and reinforce the need for using a functional assay such as our viral induction assay to measure HIV 
latency.  
UCell Associated HIV DNA and RNA measurements: U The frequency of cells harboring total and integrated HIV DNA will be 
measured by [CONTACT_770241] w ell-established assays that can detect a single copy of the viral genome in 10 PP5
PP cells [79]. While 
integrated HIV DNA is present in both latently and productively infected cells, the ratio between total and integrated has 
been recently shown to reflect residual HIV expression and de -novo reverse transcription  [80]. Total and integrated HIV 
DNA will be measured in sorted CD4 T cells to determine the impact of maraviroc on this outcome measure.  The 
frequency of cells expressing HIV RNA will be measured from isolated enriched CD4 T cells or pelleted cells from urine for single copy sensitivity qPCR assays using the AllPrep DNA/RNA kit (Qiagen, Ventura CA) as specified by [CONTACT_3455]. Cellular RNA will be normalized to cell equivalents based on qPCR usin g GAPDH mRNA expression (Life 
Technologies, Grand Island NY). Total cellular RNA is quantified with a qPCR TaqMan assay using LTR -specific primers 
F522- 43 (5’ GCC TCA ATA AAG CTT GCC TTG A 3’; HXB2 522- 543) and R626- 43 (5’ GGG CGC CAC TGC TAG AGA 3’; 626 -

selected from PBMCs using the EasySep Human CD4+ T cell Enrichment Kit (StemCell Technologies), to enrich the 
cellular population for HIV -1 DNA.  Genomic DNA will be extracted from CD4+ T cells using the Qiagen AllPrep kit.  The 
C2-V3 region of the HIV-1 envelope will be amplified using nested PCR as previously described [ 84].  Illumina Nextera 
DNA sample kits will be used to prepare sequencing libraries and incorporate multiplex identifier barcodes that will 
allow pooling of 96 samples in a single d eep sequencing run.  Sequencing will be performed on the Illumina MiSeq 
instrument in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_770174] (2 x 250 read length).  Multiple sequence alignments of the C2 -V3 region will be generated 
using hidden Markov models, and amino acid sequences of the V3 l oop region will be used to predict the coreceptor 
usage of each V3 loop variant using established bioinformatics prediction tools including Wetcat [ 85] and Geno2pheno 
[86].  For each clinical sample, the frequencies of predicted CXCR4 -tropic and CCR5 -tropi c clones will be reported.

of the CCR5 locus will be performed with the following primers: forward primer, 5 ’-GCTCTCTCCCAGGAATCATCTTTAC -3’; 
reverse primer 5 ’-TTGGTCCAACCTGTTAGAGCTACTG-3’ . The thermocycler program is as follows: 95°C, 10 min, followed 
by 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 62°C for 1 min, and 72°C for [ADDRESS_1056950] of 324 bp for the  CCR5 delta -32 deletion mutant. Gel visualization of PCR products is 
performed to differentiate between wild  type homozygosity, CCR5 delta -32 heterozygosity, and CCR5 delta -32

UIn Situ Hybridization (ISH). U Detection of low copy number HIV infection in tissues by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC) or 
immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy is hampered by [CONTACT_770243]. To assess low copy number 
HIV infection in formalin- fixed paraffin -embedded kidney biopsies , the Laszik lab has adapted the highly sensitive 
RNAScope® ISH platform using probes targeting multiple HIV1 clade B, A, and D strains on the coding sequence, 
including gag, pol, env, nef, tat, rev, vif and vpr. This novel ISH assay is based on a protocol of signal amplificatio n and 
background suppression and [CONTACT_770283] (co -investigator on this study) has significant experience detecting low copy 
number cytokines in kidney biopsies using this technology. The HIV ISH signal will be quantitated from representative 
fields of the cortex and medulla in the glomerular, tubular, interstitial, and vascular compartments using computer-
assisted digital image analysis. The HIV ISH sections will be co -stained with multiplex IF using a panel of podocyte, 
endothelial, tubular, interstitial and  inflammatory cell markers for precise quantitation of the HIV signal within various 
cellular compartments of the kidney. Preliminary results of HIV ISH show strong and specific hybridization signal in the podocytes from a patient with HIV nephropathy. The  HIV signal is unequivocally localized to the podocytes by [CONTACT_770244] -expressing synaptopodin on an ISH section co -stained with IF.  
 
Impact of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] [ADDRESS_1056951] of m araviroc on immunological profiles.   
Our hypothesis for enhanced rejection in HIV+ recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770177]+ patients have higher frequencies of allo -reactive 
memory T cells generated as a re sult of cross -reactivity between alloantigens and chronic viral antigens.  Experiments in 
animal models of transplantation demonstrate that multiple viral infections can induce the generation of memory allo -
reactive T cells as a result of cross -reactivity between alloantigen - and pathogen -reactive T cells [24-30]. Cross -reactivity 
between human alloantigen and viral antigen -reactive T cell lines and clones has also been demonstrated [ 31].  These 
viro-allo cross reactive memory T cells have a lower threshold  for activation, can directly traffic to grafts, and are 
capable of expressing effector functions upon first encounter with donor antigens, all of which can contribute to 
enhanced  graft rejections and resistance to tolerance induction.  Decades of c hronic HIV and co -pathogen infection has 
the potential to expand viral reactive T cells and skew the immune repertoire, leading to increase in VACR memory T 
cells.  Furthermore, HIV infection can exacerbate this condition by [CONTACT_263303] T cells.  Although T cell counts recover in 
most patients once HIV viremia is controlled by [CONTACT_770245], T cell receptor repertoire in patients with long -term 
HIV infection is dramatically narrower than age -matched HIV - patients. Depending on the donor allotype, a particular 
HIV+ recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770178] a narrow TCR repertoire depleted of donor-reactive T cells, whereas another recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770179] a narrow repertoire greatly enriched of donor reactivity due to the expansion of cross reactive memory T cells. The 
study  will directly tes t this hypothesis by [CONTACT_770246] T cells and cross reactive  T cells in samples 
collected pre -transplant in rejectors and non -rejectors .   
Memory T cells express high levels of CCR5, which facilitate CD4 and CD8 T cell cooperation and ac tivation.  In rodent 
models of transplantation, CCR5 blockade has been shown to be beneficial for graft survival in some settings [ 11-15], but 
may exacerbate rejection in others [ 88-90].  The difference seems to reside in the mechanism of graft rejection – CCR5 
blockade was effective at blocking Th1 -mediated rejection, but enhanced Th2 and antibody -mediated rejection.  
Another possible mechanism proposed for exacerbation of rejection by [CONTACT_83541]5 blockade is the inhibition of Treg 
infiltration of the grafts [88, 91].  It is important to note that these rodent experiments used CCR5 blockade as single 
therapy [88-90] and the outcome is likely to be very different if it is combined with additional immunosuppressive 
agents as proposed in this trial.   Effect of m araviroc in kidney transplantation in patients is unknown at present time.  
Patients with CCR5d32 have less graft rejection suggesting that CCR5 plays a role in alloimmune response in humans and 
CCR5 blockage may be effective at improving transplant outcome [ 16, 17]. A recently concluded study in GVHD suggests 
that maraviroc is effective at restricting leukocyte trafficking to target tissues [ 18].  By [CONTACT_770247] s enrolled in the standard of care and maraviroc  arms of this trial, the study  will be able to determine the 
impact of maraviroc on alloimmune responses in humans with direct clinical relevance.

The investigators  from the  UCSF core  Immunology  lab (under the direction of Qizhi Tang, PhD)   have used the Tmem 
panel to determine  the frequencies of naïve (CD45RA+CCR7+), memory (CD45RA -CCR7+), and effector (CD45RA -CCR7 -) T 
cells [92] in pre -transplant samples collected from the participant s in the HIVTR trial ( Fig 5A). Our analysis  demonstrates 
that end -stage renal disease is associated with increased effector CD4 T cells in both  of HIV+ and HIV- age-matched 
patients and HIV+ rejectors and non -rejectors had similar frequencies of effector T cells  (Fig. 5B).

HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  Our Leuk -Ccr5 panel demonstrates that Ccr5 is primarily expressed on subset of T cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells 
(Fig 6A).  Flow cytometric analyses can have significant expe riment -to-experiment variations, therefore samples to be 
directly compared, such as those collected from the same patient before and after maraviroc treatment should be 
analyzed at the same time in one experiment. The  core immunology investigator Qizhi Tang plan s to do this by 
[CONTACT_770248] -transplant to [ADDRESS_1056955] determined that Ccr5 expression pattern is not affected by [CONTACT_57013] (Fig 6B), making batch analysis of time series possible.  
These MFC assays will be performed on PBMC samples collected at all time points and LN samples collected pre -
transplant.

expression on leukocyte subsets.  
 
U10.3.2 a2  Alloreactive T cell frequency assay (ATF): U Transplants induce vigorous immune responses because of the 
exceptionally high frequencies of alloantigen -reactive T cells.  Transplant immunology research in the past decade 
revealed that allo -reactive Tregs capable of suppressing rejection are also present at high frequency and the overall 
immune response toward a transplanted organ depends on the balance between the rejection -prone conventional T 
(Tconv) cells and the tolerance -prone Tregs.  The ATF assay measures the frequency of donor- reactive Tconv and Tregs.  
This assay uses highly potent CD40L -stimulated B cells (sBc) from donors to induce proliferation of donor- reactive T cells 
from recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Because of the high expression of HLA and costimulative CD80 and CD86 molecules, the sBcs can 
activate Tconv and Tregs.  An established CFSE dilution method is used to record the division history of the donor -
reactive T cells, which can be analyzed using flow cytometry (along with markers to identify CD4, CD8 and Tregs) and 
used to calculate the frequency of the reactive T cells (Fig 7A).   

Impact of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] 54 of 91 
HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  The UCSF Immunology lab has used this assay to determine pre -transplant donor -reac tive T cell frequencies in HIV+ 
kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Our preliminary analysis of [ADDRESS_1056956] 
significantly higher donor- reactive CD8 T cells before transplant and donor- reactive CD4 Tconv and Tregs were the same 
between the two groups (Fig 7B).  
 
   This assay  will be used  to measure the frequencies of donor -reactive Tregs, Tconv CD4+ T cells and CD8
PP+
PP T cells in 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770180] -transplant .  
U10.3.2 a3  Alloreactive memory T cell assay (AMT): U  Donor reactive memory T cells pose a major threat to transplanted 
grafts because they have a lower activation threshold and are resistant to immunosuppression.  We hypothesize that 
HIV+ transp lant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770181] T cells due to heterologous immunity generated through 
their anti-viral T cells.  A hallmark of memory T cells is their ability to produce effector cytokines  shortly after antigen 
encounter.  The alloreactive  effector T cell assay will measure frequencies of alloantigen stimulated cytokine  production 
after a short  stimulation with either a panel of  allogeneic sBcs (panel-reactive effector T cell assay  [93]) or donor sBcs 
(donor -reactive effector T cell assay ).  Cytokine secretion will be blocked during stimulation to permit the detection of 
intracellular IFNg and IL -4 using flow cytometry.  The cells will also be stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, 
CD19/CD14/CD16 (dump), and viability.  As a positive control, each sample will also be stimulated with PMA and 
ionomycin to determine the cytokine production potential of the cells.  Negative control will be cells incubated alone without stimulants (Fig 8).

U10.3.2 a4  Cross reactive T cell assay (CRT): U We have developed an approach to identify T c ells with allo and viral dual 
reactivities  (Fig 9).  Our approach takes advantage of the potent allostimulatory activity of the sBc.  We found that after 
one round of allogeneic sBc stimulation of PBMC and 10 -day expansion in IL -2, virtually 100% of the T cells in culture are 
reactive to the sBcs (data not shown).  We then restimulated the alloreactive T cell lines with various pools of viral 
peptides.  Cells reactive to viral antigens were then identified using cell surface activation marker CD98 and dilution of a proliferation dye CTV.  Fig 9 shows an example  of identification of T cells in an HIV+ patient that are cross -reactive 
between  donor  alloantigens and an HIV -Pol peptide pool.  Similarly we have also identified allo -reactive T cells that can 
recognize HIV -Gag, HIV -Nef, CMV, EBV, an d Flu peptide antigens.

U10.3.2 b Serum HLA antibodies (HLA)  
U10.3.2 b1 HLA antibodies: U  Prior alloantigen exposure can lead to the formation of alloreactive memory T cells and B cells 
and presence of anti -HLA antibodies in the serum that can contribute to graft injury. In addition, lymphopenia in HIV -
infected patients has been shown to drive homeostatic proliferation of B cells and increase the frequencies of 
transitional B cells that produce cross -reactive antibodies.  We will determine if B cell dysregulation in HIV+ patients also 
leads to increased alloantibodies before and after transplant.  We will measure  antibodies to class I and class II HLA 
using Luminex single antigen coated beads (LABScreen; One Lambda, Inc., Canoga Park, CA). Donor specificity of HLA 
alloantibodies will be  determined by [CONTACT_770249][INVESTIGATOR_770184].  
In addition of anti -HLA antibodies, B cell dysregulation can also lead to increase of antibodies to other specificities.  
Particularly,  non-HLA antibodies have been shown to media te chronic  graft injuries  [94].  We will bank extra serum 
aliquots for future exploratory analysis of non -HLA antibodies.

quantitated by [CONTACT_685128] (Tissue Studio, Definiens) and combined with multiple IF stains (cytokeratin for the tubules, CD31 for endothelial cells, leukocyte common antigen for lymphocytes, CD68 for macrophages) for precise signal localization within various compartments of the kidney.    
Whole genome gene expression profiling: RNA deep sequencing (RNA -Seq) will be utilized as our primary method for 
defining the mechanism of graft rejection in HIV+ patients and the impact of maraviroc on the rejection mechanism . 
Transcript sequences are mapped back to a reference genome and transcriptome. Reads that map back to the reference are quantified to assess the level of gene expression, with the number of mapped reads being the measure of expression 
level for that gene or genomic region. Because RNA -Seq provides direct access to the sequence, it has several technical 
advantage s over microarray:  Junctions between exons can be assayed without prior knowledge of the gene structure, 
RNA editing events can be detected, and knowledge of polymorphisms can provide direct measurements of allele -
specific expression. RNA -Seq can detect e xpressed regions of the genome that correspond to yet to be annotated genes. 
RNA -Seq can quantify transcript isoforms that result from alternative splicing, making possible the study of transcript 
isoform diversity and abundance.  
Identification of gene transcripts will be carried out by [CONTACT_770251](A) -tailed RNA isolated from  graft biopsies.  We will use the Illumina GAIIx (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) platform for 
this analysis. We will use approxim ately 5 ug of total RNA per library preparation. We will amplify the poly(A) -tailed RNA 
isolated prior to library preparation by [CONTACT_770252]’s MessageAmp II aRNA Amplification Kit (Austin, TX). For each sample, 100 ng of amplified polyA+ RNA will be used, fragm ented, converted to double stranded cDNA and subjected to RNA -
Seq. We plan to barcode and sequence [ADDRESS_1056961] on our Illumina HiSeq 2000 machine. This currently produces about 30M reads per sample. Since ~60% yield unique reads, we will  obtain 18M mapped reads per sample. 
This is adequate for accurate monitoring of gene expression for most genes. Prior work with embryonic stem cells 
suggests that we can obtain information on approximately 80% of detectable genes with this depth. These figures are 
consistent with the results of others.  Moreover, we will generate 76b paired -end reads to monitor splicing isoforms, 
though we may only cover approximately ~40% of the known variants at this depth.  The results obtained from both 
arms of the patients in th is trial will be compared to each other and will be compared with historical RNAsep data on 
HIV- rejection biopsies published by [CONTACT_770253].

time of rejection (blood  and graft) will be compared among HIV+ rejectors on standard immunosuppression  and HIV+ 
rejectors on maraviroc  to determine if rejections in the two groups have distinct or similar profiles.  
To determine the impact of m araviroc on immunological profiles , comparisons will be made between HIV+ patients 
receiving standard immunosuppression and those on  maraviroc -containing regimen.  
UData integrity checks: U The first step of data analysis will be to perform data integrity checks, including checks for 
unrealistic outliers in assay measureme nts and missing data. Data that are not within a plausible clinical range will be 
individually checked for potential causes e.g., data entry errors; if no plausible explanation is found, they will be treated  
as missing data.  
UDescriptive analyses: U Descriptive analyses  will be used  to su mmarize participant  characteristics of our study populations 
across treatment groups. Dichotomous variables will be summarized as proportions with 95% confidence intervals. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using means, standard deviations , and 95% c onfidence intervals if they are 
symmetric and unimodal. Otherwise, they will be summarized using the median and the interquartile range. Simple t -, 
ANOVA,  chi-squared, or Fisher ’s exact test, as appropriate, will be used to compare quantitative measures ac ross 
treatment groups.  
UStatistical modeling: U Statistical analysis will be performed primarily  via ANOVA, chi -squared, or Fisher’s exact test, as 
appropriate, and when warranted (in the case of repeated measurements on the same participant s), using the l inear 
mixed -effect model.  In the case of mixed effects model, the random -effects we consider are the intercept term for the 
2-timepoint analyses and intercept plus slopes modeled for 3 -timepoints. Fixed effects will include intercept, slope, 
treatment group and treatment group by [CONTACT_25218]. We will also consider the need for heterogeneous residual 
variance magnitude between groups (as has been observed in some of our assays). A major strength of this linear mixed -
effects modeling approach is the ability to model all of the data available for a person, regardless of length of follow -up, 
number and spacing of evaluations, and/or missing outcome data at some time points (assuming non -informative 
missingness). An additional important advantage is the enhanced power obtained by [CONTACT_770255].  
Impact of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] 60 of 91 
HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  UStatistical testing for hypotheses: U In the case of linear mixed effects models, h ypothesis  testing will use the linear mixed-
effect model to determine whether the in clusion of a treatment group variable and its interaction with time significantly 
improves the model fit for the assay response variables (conditional t -tests within linear mixed effects model fits). 
Primary focus will be on detection of a statistically significant time by [CONTACT_66357]. We will also examine 
any effects in terms of restricted maximum likelihood point estimates and 95% confidence intervals. As far as the primary hypotheses are concerned, we will use a nominal significance thres hold of α = 0.05. However, we will make 
adjustments for multiple comparisons when multiple pairwise assessments need to be conducted among groups.  
UAssessing normal assumption: U Many of the statistical procedures we will use, including the linear mixed -effects model, 
assume that responses follow a normal distribution. We will use standard diagnostic methods such as quantile -quantile 
plots and direct tests of normality to examine the appropriateness of this assumption.   If we detect severe departures 
from normal distributions, we will either transform the outcome to produce better approximations to normal distributions or apply non -linear mixed -effects modeling approaches.  
UOutliers: U We will examine plots of data and residuals from fitted models to detect potential outlying and influential 
points. If we detect such points , we will flag  and check them with the sites for accuracy. If any outliers are not in error, 
then we will  assess the effect of these points on the analysis by [CONTACT_770256] t he points. If the two sets 
of analyses differ substantially, we will report the results separately.  
UMissing data: U Every attempt will be made to determine the reason for any missing data, in particular for missing 
observations caused by [CONTACT_770257].  Individuals with missing data on key variables will be compared to those with 
complete data to assess for potential bias due to non -random missing data. If a participant ’s observation is deemed 
missing at random (i.e. missing follow -up for reasons unrelat ed to the outcome) then we can continue to apply models 
“as is” with the missing observation simply left out of the analysis. When missing outcome data is deemed informative (i.e. not missing at random), we will perform sensitivity analyses. The sensitivity analysis will examine multiple 
approaches to imputing the missing data (e.g. simple carry last one forward, or advanced methods such as Expectation 
Maximization), as well as outcomes corresponding to different extreme case scenarios for the missing data mechanism.

HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  10.4.2 Analysis of blood samples   
 
Blood samples are frozen at –80 °C until analyzed.   
 
Whole blood samples a re analyzed for tacrolimus  (or cyclosporine or sirolimus) by a validated HPLC/MS assay in 
combination with automated online sample preparation (LC/LC -MS) (Hewlett -Packard; Palo Alto, CA).  Method 
validation has been described in detail by [CONTACT_770258]. [95]  
 We have developed a n updated methodology for analysis of maraviroc.  API4000 LC/MS/MS trace from injection of [ADDRESS_1056964], at 175/mg. Th e MS method uses the MS/MS transition m/ z 514.3 → 390.1.  The 
Sciex API4000 instrumental parameters (in positive ion electrospray mode) are: declustering potential =  56 V, collision 
energy = 29 V, collision cell exit potential =  22 V, entrance potential =  10.5 V, collision gas = 12, curtain gas = 16, i on 
source gas1 = 30, ion source gas2 = 40, ionspray voltage = 5500 V, temperature = 500 C.   
 The LC method is carried out with a Shimadzu Prominence LC system including a pair of LC20 -AD pumps, a SIL -20AC HT 
autosampler and a CBM -20A controller. It uses a  Phenomenex Kinetex C18 50 x 4.6 mm (5 µm, 100 Å) column and the 
following gradient at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min: 0 -1 min, 10% B; 1- 4 min, linear ramp to 100% B; 4 -6 min, 100% B; 6 -6.5 
min, linear ramp to 10% B; 6.5 -10 min, 10% B, where A = 15% methanol:wa ter, B = 100% methanol, and both A and B 
contain 0.1% formic acid, 0.1% acetonitrile and 160 mg/L ammonium acetate.  A similar method has been published by a group from Tandem Laboratories and [COMPANY_007]. [96] 
 
10.4.3 Pharmacokinetic analysis   
Individual whole blood  concentration -time data are used for pharmacokinetic parameter estimation using 
noncompartmental methods (WinNonlin software, Professional Edition, version 5.0; Pharsight, Mountain View, CA).  
Pre-dose sample  times of less than time zero a re assigned valu es of zero.  Samples below the limit of quantitation of 
bioanalytical assays that occurred before the first quantifiable concentration was achieved are assigned a concentration of zero to prevent overestimation of initial area under the curve ( AUC ). Values  below the limit of quantitation at all 
other time points a re treated as missing data.  Maximum concentration ( C
RRmaxRR) RR RRand time at maximum concentration 
(T RRmaxRR) are taken as the observed values.  
 AUCs are calculated over the dosing interval using the linear- log trapezoidal method and adjusted for both drug dose 
and patient weight .  Dividing these values into the dose yielded measures of weight adjusted apparent oral clearance 
(CL/F).  Terminal half- lives during the dosing interval [representing th e multiple dosin g operational half- life, are used to 
calculate the apparent oral volume of distribution: V/F = (CL/F) x (t
RR1/2,opRR/0.693)]. [97]

Severity of AEs will be grade d according to the “Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and  Pediatric 
Adverse Events” (Corrected Version 2.1, July, 2017 ). 
 
Information in this section complies with ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and S tandards 
for Expedited Reporting, ICH Guideline E -6: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice , 21CFR Parts 312 and 320 . 
13.2 Definitions  
13.2.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with the participant ’s participation in the researc h, 
whether or not considered related to the participant ’s participation in the research (modified from the definition of 
adverse events in the 1996 International Conference on Harmonization E -6 Guideline s for Good Clinical Practice) (from 
OHRP “Guidance on  Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others and Adverse 
Events (1/15/07) ” 39TUhttp://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sites/default/files/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.pdf .  
For this study, an adverse event will include any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with , but not 
limited to :   
• Worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of conditions present at the onset of the study  
• Intercurrent illnesses  
• Drug reactions or interactions of antiretroviral agents, immun osuppressant agents, or other concomitant 
medications used on study  
• Infections  
• Events related or possible related to maraviroc or concomitant medications  
• Abnormal laboratory values (significant shifts from baseline within the range of normal that the inves tigator 
considers to be clinically important)  
• Clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination, vital signs, weight, and/or tests and procedures 
• Surgical complications of kidney transplantation  
13.2.2 Unexpected Adverse Event   
An adverse event or susp ected adverse reaction is considered  “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator  Brochure  
or is not listed at the specificity, severity or rate of occurrence that has been observed.  
Impact of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] 67 of 91 
HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  “Unexpected” also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse react ions that are mentioned in the Investigator 
Brochure or package insert as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of 
the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under  investigation (21 CFR 312.32(a) ] 
13.2.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adverse event  or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
Sponsor [ DAIDS] , it results in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32(a)):  
1. Death.  
2. A life -threatening event: An AE or SAR is considered “life -thre atening” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
Sponsor , its occurrence places the participant  at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had 
it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
4. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.  
5. Congenital anomaly or b irth defect.  
6. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20967], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant  and may 
require medical or s urgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_770193].  
13.3 Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events  
13.3.1 Grading Criteria  
Severity of AEs will be graded according to the “Division Of AIDS Table For Grading The Severity Of Adult And Pediatric 
Adverse Events” (Corrected Version 2.1, July 2017).  
 
Adverse Events not found in the Toxicity Table will be assessed for severity and classified into one of the categories 
below:  
Grade 1 (Mild) : Event requires minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.  
Grade 2 (Moderate) : Event re sults in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures.  
Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
Grade 3 (Severe) : Event interrupts a subject’s usual daily activity or functioning and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment.  Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
Grade 4 (Potentially Life threatening) :  Events causing inability to perform basic self- care functions OR Medical 
or operative intervention indicated to prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability, or death.  
Grade 5 (Death)  
13.3.2 Causality Assessment  
Causality (likelihood that the event is related to the study agent) will be assessed from the time study dosing 
begins until [ADDRESS_1056974] dose considering the factors listed under the following categories:  
 
Impact of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] 68 of 91 
HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  Definitely Related  
• reasonable temporal relationship  
• follows a known response pattern  
• clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship  
• there is no alternative etiology  
 
Probably Related   
• reasonable temporal relationship  
• follows a suspected response pattern (based on similar agents)  
• no evidence of a more likely alternative etiology  
 Possibly Related   
• reasonable temporal relationship  
• little evidence for a more likely alternative etiology  
 Unlikely Related   
• does not have a reasonable temporal relationship  
OR 
• good evidence for a more likely alternative etiology  
 Not Related   
• does not have a temporal relationship           
OR 
• definitely due to an alternative etiology  
 
Note:  Other factors (e.g., dechallenge, rechallenge) should also be considered for each causality category when appropriate. Causality assessment is based on available information at the time of the assessment of the AE. The I nvestigator may revise the causality assessment as additional information becomes available.  
13.4 Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
13.4.1 Collection Period  
Adverse events will be collected from the time of transplant  until a participant  completes study participation or until 30 
days after he/she prematurely withdraws (without withdrawing consent) or is withdrawn from the study.  
13.4.2 Collecting Adverse Events  
Adverse events (including SAEs) may be discovered through any of these methods:  
• Observing the participant . 
• Interviewing  the participant  [e.g., using a checklist, structured questioning, diary, etc.]   . 
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant . 
• In addition, an abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an adverse  event, 
as defined in  section 13.[ADDRESS_1056975] all adverse events and serious adverse events as described previously  
(13.2 Definitions ) on the appropriate electronic case report form in the EMMES IDES  regardl ess of the relationship to

This trial is a prospective, multi- center, double- blind phase II study of kidney transplantation in HIV+ individuals

regimen that  does not  include protease inhibitors. Analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on outcomes 
measured at [ADDRESS_1056981] secondary outcomes will be done on measurements 
taken at month s 3, 6, 9, years 1, 2 and /or [ADDRESS_1056982] -randomization. The primary clinical objective is to evaluate CCR5 
blockade as a strategy to improve long term kidney function following transplantation in the HIV positive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  In 
addition, this study has a large number of secondary clinical and mechanistic objectives.  
16.2 Measures to Minimize Bias  
Donor type  (deceased versus live)  is an important confounding factor known to impact  graft function, inflammation  and 
survival outcomes post kidney transplantation , and recent approval regarding the use of HIV+ donors, although not 
observed in the South Africa experience, could yield differences in outcomes compared to use of HIV - donors . Outcome 
differences may also arise due to known and unknown center -specific differences. Hence, p articipant s will be randomized 
in a blinded fashion to one of the two treatment arms in a 1:[ADDRESS_1056983] will be implemented for histological endpoint assessments.  
 For t he primary and secondary endpoints on graft function, missing data can be of concern and a source of bias in the case 
of graft failures. Hence, we will consider graft failures as informed drop -outs in these analyses. Appropriate imputations 
will be implemented as explained for the primary endpoint below. For the secondary endpoints on graft function, similar 
imputations will be performed at the time of graft failure.  
16.3 Endpoint Assessments  
16.3.1 Primary Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is defined in section  3.2. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the 52 -week GFR  as 
measured by [CONTACT_240099] . Mean GFR  of maraviroc group (Arm 1) will be compared to the mean GFR  of the placebo 
reference group (Arm 2) via a  Wilcoxon rank -sum t est. Informed drop -outs  will consist only of graft failures prior to week 
52, and  will be incorporated to the analysis  by [CONTACT_770263]  
a value of 10 ml/min/1.73m PP2
PP (10 being the average estima ted GFR at the time of dialysis initiation in the U.S.) , whichever 
is lower. Note that graft failure will be defined as the first observation of any of the following events: 1) death with a 
non-functioning graft, 2) retransplantation, or 3) initial return to chronic dialysis.   Results will be reported with p -value 
associated with the Wilcoxon rank -sum test  and the estimated mean treatment difference with two -sided 95% 
confidence interval. All tests of significance will be two -tailed at the 0.[ADDRESS_1056984] 2 sensitivity analyses  for the primary  efficacy  endpoint : (1) include only the completers in the analysis 
(i.e., exclude all dropouts  and treatment discontinuations prior to week 52 ); (2) imput e the worst GFR value observed at 
that time point in the study or a value of 10 ml/min/1.73m2, whichever is lower, for death s with graft function  that occur 
prior to week 52. The sensitivity analyses will be included as additional secondary analyses.

HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  16.3.3 Primary Safety Endpoint  
The primary safety  endpoint will be  the incidence of  graft loss and t oxicities ≥ Grade 3 and/or permanent treatment 
discontinuation  within the first [ADDRESS_1056985] -transplant . Cumulative incidence in maraviroc group (Arm 1) will be 
compared to the cumulative incidence  in the placebo reference group (Arm 2) via a  log-rank  test.  Results will be 
reported with p -value associated with the log-rank  test and the Kaplan -Meier estimates for each treatment group  with 
two-sided 95% confidence in tervals. All tests of significance will be  two-tailed at the 0.05 level.  
16.3.4 Secondary Clinical Endpoints  
 
The secondary clinical endpoints are defined in section  3.3. The endpoints are to be computed and summarized by 
[CONTACT_139679], in a few cases, by [CONTACT_4475]/w eek and treatment. With the exception of specific AEs and lab parameters, 
proportions or means will be estimated for each treatment arm and tested for treatment differences through the use of a statistical model. The particular model to be used depends on the scale of measurement of the endpoint. The accompanying table lists each endpoint and its measurement scale (continuous, dichotomous, and ordinal). All tests of significance in all analyses will be made at the 0.05 level.  
 Dichotomous measures of preva lence and incidence will be analyzed with log- binomial regression models, wherein 
treatment effects will be estimated as relative risk ratios; the reference group will be the Arm 2 participant s. The log -
binomial model (rather than logistic regression) is applied for prevalence and incidence analyses because model -based 
estimates of relative risk (RR) are both more desirable and appropriate for non -Poisson events that are expected to 
occur more commonly than in 10% of the cases. In such cases, logistic regre ssion- based odds ratio (OR) estimates are 
poor estimators of the relative risk  [98-101]. It may be appropriate to treat some of the dichotomous outcomes as 
censored data; if this is the case, we will obtain RR estimates by [CONTACT_770264]  [102].  
The single ordinal secondary outcome variable (Banff cell- mediated AR score) will be analyzed in a proportional odds 
model  [103]
 which may include additional covariates and interaction terms, as appropriate.  
 For continuous outcomes, we w ill test for differences in response means among the treatment arms by [CONTACT_770265] (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models to the original scores or to some normalizing -variance stabilizing transformation of them. F or some endpoints, these models may be fit separately by [CONTACT_770266] -randomization (i.e., time will be treated as a by -variable and no repeated measures analysis will be 
performed). Repeated measures models will be fit to the slopes of eGFR vs. time r egressions. The latter will be 
estimated in a mixed effects repeated measures model in which both treatment-group means (with 95% confidence limits) of the individual participant  slopes and the individual participant  slopes themselves will be estimated and  tested 
for equality. Distributions of the individual slopes will be examined graphically and compared among the treatment groups.

Section  14. 
16.5 Sample Size Considerations  
Primary efficacy endpoint s: The primary efficacy endpoint is mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) calculated for each 
treatment group using iohexol clearance  at 52 weeks . The expected mean±SD GFR level at week [ADDRESS_1056991]-transplant for 
the control group (Arm 2) was based on the data observed in HIV -TR and other post -transplant studies and assumed to 
be 60 ± 20 ml/min per 1.73 m PP2
PP.  Using the same SD for the m araviroc group (Arm 1) and group sample sizes of 6 5 with a 
8% drop -out rate  at 1 year, we would achieve about 80% power to detect a difference of 10. 6 ml/min per 1.73 m PP2
PP or 
more in mean GFR levels between the two groups (with a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_1056992] assuming that the actual distribution is normal). Average drop in GFR in patients on calcineurin inhibitors is 2ml/min 
per 1.73 m PP2
PP per year  [104, 105] ; hence, we have targeted detection of around a 10 ml/min per 1.[ADDRESS_1056993] of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] 77 of 91 
HIVTR CCR5   Version 4.0  between the two treatment groups that would be equivalent to about 5 years of difference in the life of the renal 
allograft. Note that drop -out rate is assumed to be 13%, but 5% is expected to be informed drop -outs that will be 
incorporated to the prim ary analyses . Hence, the adjusted drop -out rate used for this calculation is equivalent to 8 %. 
 Secondary endpoints: Based on expected rates of normal, borderline changes and acute cellular rejection in the HIV+ kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_319233] 26 weeks from previous studies, the expected mean ± SD CD45 gene expression count (PTPRC mRNA in log2 scale ) for the control group (Arm 2) was assumed to be 7.9 ± 1.0.   Using the same SD for the 
maraviroc group (Arm 1) and group sample sizes of 30 (assuming enrollment  of 60 HIV+ cases in the study with follow -up 
to week 26 or further), we would achieve about 80% power to detect a difference of 0.8 or more in mean CD45 gene expression count between the two groups (with a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_1056994] 
with normal actual distribution assumption).  
  Another  secondary endpoint  of interest  is the incidence of treated acute rejection at [ADDRESS_1056995] 80% power at a 0.[ADDRESS_1056996] of CCR5 Blockade in HIV+ Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_770134] [ADDRESS_1056997] of a clinical trial and the quality of the data produced.

4. Recommend collecting every 12 weeks  from primary provider  if not done locally since the protocol requires  a result  no more than 26 weeks prior to 
transplant , although not required. Only pre -transplant  results  used fo r study eligibility /enrollment into segment B  are required.  
5. Baseline samples must be drawn no t more than 13 weeks prior to day of transplant (day 0). Urine is not required in subjects with anuria. Do not draw 
baseline blood samples at screening if subject is not expected to be transplanted and randomized within the next 13 weeks. If it is not possible to 
obtain these baseline research blood samples within window, they should be drawn on the day of admission for transplant and prior to study drug 
administration  and transplant . Drawing research samples on the day of transplant can be difficult logistically since samples need to be collected, 
processed and shipped to the repository, and transplant may occur with no study team present, so all attempt s should be made to obtain baseline 
samples prior to day 0 if possible.  
6. If the screening samples were not previously drawn, or were drawn more than 13 weeks prior to day of transplant  (day 0), redraw all screening blood 
and/or urine samples for mechanistic studies on  the day of admission for transplant and prior to study drug administration and transplant .

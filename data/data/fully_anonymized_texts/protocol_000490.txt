groups, Group A for TempSure  treatments only and Group B for TempSure and Icon treatments. 
Randomization will not be required as subjects will only be enrolled in Group B and treated with 
the Icon device if they present with pi[INVESTIGATOR_81847]/r vascular lesions . Subjects will attend a 
screening/pretreatment visit which may be performed on the same day as the treatment visit.  
Subjects  in Group A  will receive up to [ADDRESS_89121] the TempSure device and 2 treatments with 
both the TempSure and Icon device.  Some subjects may be asked to return for an optional 5th 
treatment (2 – [ADDRESS_89122] treatment) with the Icon  device  (and/or TempSure device ) after the 
completion of their 4 treatments at the discretion of the Investigator.  Subjects may receive a phone 
call 1 week (1 -7 days) after each treatment to record side effects.  Subjects will return for follow up 
visits at [ADDRESS_89123]  or as deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_9257].  
  
 Analysis:  
Upcoming generations are proving to have an interest in non -ablative aesthetic treatments and will 
drive demand for innovated products, procedures, and practice design.[ADDRESS_89124] few years and the nonsurgical treatment using this energy 
source offers great promise to our aging population.2 Radiofrequency technology for the treatment 
facial wrinkles  and skin laxity needs  to be further investigated to optimize treatment parameters for 
safe and effective non -ablative aesthetic treatments.  
 
Relevance:  
Over time, skin structure degrades due to a variety of internal and external conditions. As enzymes 
break down collagen and elastin, skin loses its suppleness and becomes loose.  UV exposure, diet, 
and smoking among other behaviors all contribute to the skin becoming lax.   Body wrinkles, 
particularly on the abdomen, are a sign of aging and are also a prevalent concern with postpartum 
women or subjects who have lost weight. It is estimated that adult skin loses approximately 1% of 
its dermal collagen content on an annual ba sis due to increased collagen degradation and decreased 
collagen synthesis.[ADDRESS_89125] profiles and modes of administration.  
 
Testability:  
The TempSure device  is currently cleared for use for non -ablative treatment of mild to moderate 
facial wrinkles and  rhytids  (K171262 ). The Icon device is currently cleared for used for the Max 
Series Intense Pulsed Light Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_81848], including warts, scars and striae; removal of unwanted hair from  
skin types [ADDRESS_89126] stable long -term, or permanent, hair reduction; treatment  
of benign pi[INVESTIGATOR_80436], including lentigines, nevi, melasma, and cafe -au-lait; and  
treatment of vascular lesions, including port wine stains, hemangiomas, angiomas,  
telangiectasias, ro sacea, facial and leg veins  (K103664 ). This study will utilize the collection of 
data and imaging to support current and additional marketing claims.

Version  4.0: January 20, [ADDRESS_89127]’s bodies are also capable of responding to the treatment 
quicker due to their ability to produce more collagen quicker than an older subject. As a subject 
gets older the ir condition  becom ing more severe, this may result in the subject needing more 
overall treatment and more aggressive treatments to get their body to respond the same way that a 
younger subject may be able to respond.   
 
Predictive power:  
While this study will observe the efficacy of the device  on the face , this treatment could potentially 
be applied to a variety of body areas and other potential application s. Assuming  there an 
acceptable safety profile , it would be appropriate to expect re sults in different areas.

Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) devices.  
• If the neutral pad would need to be placed on a subject  that has a metal plate, rod, or any 
metal implant that could conduct heat from the Smart Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_81850].  
• The subject is allergic to adhesives, such as glues on medical tape, they shou ld be alerted 
that a rash may occur on the neutral pad site and an over the counter solution may be used 
to treat the area.  
• The subject  is allergic to gold, such as the metallic covering of the TempSure handpi[INVESTIGATOR_6928].  
• The subject  is allergic to corn, such as the corn derivative ingredient in Parker Aquasonic 
Gel. 
• If the subject  has an unhealthy expectation of the results – this is not plastic surgery and all 
subject  should be fully informed of the treatment’s expected results.  
• The subject  has severe laxity or  sagging that causes redundant folds of tissue or hanging 
skin in the area to be treated – this treatment will be ineffective.  
• The subject  has used Accutane (Isotretinoin) six to twelve months prior to treatment, as this 
can thin the skin and make it brittle.  
• Studies of the use of the RF generator on subjects  that have any of the following conditions

• The subjec t is currently taking blood thinning medications or anti -coagulants. The subject  
should discontinue the use of these medications if determined to be safe to do so by [CONTACT_81896]. With the prescribing physician’s approval, the subject  should  stop 
taking the medication at least 2 weeks prior to and throughout the treatment course.  
• The subject has a condition or is taking medications that alters the ability of the blood to 
coagulate.  
• The subject is currently using Tretinoin and topi[INVESTIGATOR_1832] s, e.g., Retin -A®, Renova® and 
exfoliating products. Although use in the area to be treated is not absolutely 
contraindicated, it is known to make skin more sensitive and prone to exfoliation. 
Candidates for Icon ™ treatment should be advised to discontinue  the use of exfoliating 
creams and other exfoliating products two (2) weeks prior to and during the entire 
treatment course.  
• The subject has a history of heat urticaria. They may develop hives with exposure to light 
pulses.  
• The subject has Herpes I or II within the treatment area. Before a treatment, candidates 
should consult their primary care physician for medical evaluation and possible prophylaxis 
to minimize the chance of a herpetic breakout. A small percentage of persons may 
experience an activation of oral herpes simplex virus infection within 5 -10days after the 
procedure, even with appropriate prophylaxis.  
• The subject has received Botulinums treatments in the treatment area. There is the 
possibility for increased diffusion of Botulinums, such as Bot ox®, as a result of edema 
associated with facial light -based treatment, which may result in facial asymmetry when 
these procedures are performed at the same visit. Many physicians recommend waiting for 
a minimum of 2 weeks after a Botox injection before pe rforming facial light -based 
treatments. Cynosure has conducted no clinical trials and cannot recommend any specific 
waiting time.  
• The subject has Pi[INVESTIGATOR_81852]. If treating over a pi[INVESTIGATOR_80461], 
the lesion must be diagnosed as beni gn by a qualified practitioner prior to treatment. 
Inaccurate diagnosis and inadvertent treatment of a skin cancer may lead to a delay in the 
person receiving proper medical care.  
• Th subject has Cosmetic Dermal Fillers/Implants in treatment area. This Hand pi[INVESTIGATOR_81853], neurotoxins, or implants.  
• The subject has had unprotected sun exposure or use of tanning beds or creams in areas to 
be treated. Protected sun exposure means wearing protective cl othing and the daily use of a 
SPF-[ADDRESS_89130] four (4) weeks prior to treatment, during the treatment course, 
and four to six (4 to 6) weeks after treatme nt. This will reduce the chance of skin color 
changes and manifestation of new pi[INVESTIGATOR_80436].  
• The subject has a history of Menstrual dysfunction/Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). 
Those with menstrual dysfunction, such as PCOS and/or ovarian hyperandr ogenism, may 
have unpredictable results. These subjects tend to have hirsutism secondary to their disease 
and should consult a primary care physician before a light -based treatment.  
• The subject has a history of vitiligo, eczema, psoriasis, allergic dermati tis, any diseases 
affecting collagen including Ehlers -Danlos syndrome, and scleroderma may affect response 
to treatment.

2.13 Evaluation Methods  
Photographs:  
Photographs will be taken at baseline and at the 4 and 12 week follow up visit, and may be taken at 
eat treatment visit  to assess the efficacy  and safety  of treatment.  
 
Treatment Discomfort/Pain Evaluation:  
Subjects will be  asked to report the general level of treatment discomfort on a scale of 0 (none) to 
10 (maximum intolerable pain) using the universal pain assessment tool (Appendix B)  
 
Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Severity Scale  
The Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Severity Scale will be used  to evaluate outcomes. Live evaluation will be 
performed at Baseline and the [ADDRESS_89147] Treatment  Questionnaire : 
Subject  treatment  questionnaire s may be collected  from each subject  to obtain feedback on their 
treatment experience .  
 
Blinded Evaluation:  
Three blinded independent reviewers will perform a photographic evaluation in which they will be 
asked to identify pre -treatment images when compare d to post treatment images. The reviewers 
will be Board Certified Dermatologist s and/or Surgeons and will be chosen based on availability 
and have relevant clinical experience. They will attend a training session prior to grading.   
 
Physician and Subject Questionnaire:  
The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) ranging from “worse” to “very much improved” 
will be used to judge the improvement as seen by [CONTACT_81903].

Version  4.0: January 20, [ADDRESS_89149] be supported by [CONTACT_737]’s timely assessment and documentation of 
the adverse event in the case report forms or source documents.  All documented adverse events 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_81904]. All adverse events must be followed until their resolution.  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to the TempSure  Device:  
Mild discomfort during treatment may be experienced by [CONTACT_423]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the discomfort is 
temporary and localized within the treatment area. Mild edema (swelling) and erythema (redness) 
may occur. Initial studies indicate that these side effects typi[INVESTIGATOR_40167] 2 to 24 hours.  
 
Other anticipated side effects may include; p ain, skin burns, bleeding, scarring, crusting, bruising, 
infection, itching,  prolonged edema (swelling) and  erythema (redness), hardness, and nodules. Loss 
of hair pi[INVESTIGATOR_81862].  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining  to the Icon Device :  
Adverse effects can include discomfort /pain , redness, swelling, pi[INVESTIGATOR_81863], skin peeling , 
itching, scabbing, crusting,  purpura,  and bruising, which are usually transient and resolve without 
intervention.  
 
Possible adverse effects include pustules  (such as ingrown hairs) , skin burns, hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371],  removal or lightening of freckles, scarring, infection and all ergic reaction  
(such as a rash) . There is also r isk of incidental hair reduction or removal in the treated areas.  
 
People of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean descent and those who have an ill -defined hair line 
with no obvious transition of the hairline to the face are at a high risk for hair stimulation  
(paradoxical hair growth) . 
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to Gel: 
The gel is a water -based gel that may be placed on the skin during the TempSure® treatment. No 
known adverse events are documented. However, an a llergic reaction is always possible when 
placing a topi[INVESTIGATOR_81864]. Allergic reaction may include a mild reaction such as skin redness, 
irritation, or hives.  
 [ADDRESS_89150].   
3 Improved - Obvious improvement in appearance from initial condition, but a 
re-treatment is indicated.  
4 No Change - The appearance is essentially the same as the original condition.  
5 Worse - The appearance is worse than the original condition.

Adverse Events Pertaining to Neutral Pad : 
Mild heat  or hot spots  may be felt during treatment by [CONTACT_423].  If the subject  reports heat at the 
pad site, evaluate  the site, check for epi[INVESTIGATOR_81865] . Skins burns may occur if subject does not 
report if the pad becomes too hot.  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to Cooling:  
Anticipated transient side effects associated with forced air/contact [CONTACT_81905], 
itching, decreased sensation, numbness, redness and pain.  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to the Surgical Marker:  
Using surgical marker has minimal risks and may  produce effects on the body such as redness or a 
rash. Markings may remain visible for a few days or may be removed with alcohol.  
 
Other Cautions:  
Incomplete response or no response may occur since some subjects may not respond to treatment.

treatment (90 day) images will be ≥80%.  
 
For the additional assessments to be considered a success, the following must be true: 
 
• In cases where the subject’s improvement is being graded on a scale, such as the  FWSS and  
GAIS scale, we will test the statistical significance of our results against a hypothetical 
population that would have no change (average score of 4).  
• Subject treatment and clinician usability questionnaires are collected.  
• The side effect profile (adverse events) and the average pain score is acceptable to the 
Physician as it relates to the type of treatment.

include the sample size and the number and percent of patients for each outco me.  For these 
variables the treatment groups will be compared using Fisher’s Exact test.   Statistical significance 
will be declared if the two -sided p -value is < 0.05.  
  
2.15.5 Analysis of Efficacy Variables  
Additional  efficacy variable is the change from baseline to Visit 7 (12 week follow up visit). 
Baseline is defined as the last assessment prior to the first treatment. The change from baseline to 
visits [ADDRESS_89154] to the treatment group comparison at visit 7 will be declared if 
the two -sided p -value is < 0.05.  For each treatment group , summaries will be prepared for both the 
observed assessment and the change from baseline.  The summaries will include the sample size, 
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  The statistical significan ce of the 
mean change from baseline for each treatment group will be determined using a paired t -test. 
 
2.15.6 Analysis of Safety Variables  
Safety will be assessed through the degree of pain/discomfort related to the procedure (universal 
pain scale) and th e collection of Adverse Events throughout the course of the study.  For each 
treatment group these variables will be summarized.  The summaries will include the number and 
percent of patients for each outcome.  No statistical comparisons will be performed for any of 
these variables.  
 
3.0  RISK  ANALYSIS AND M ANAGEMENT

3.2 Risk Management  
The Investigator in this clinical trial has been invited to participate based on his/her previous 
experience with the use of the system and/or  similar systems and industry  experience.  Experience 
with treatments is the most critical element in managing sub ject risk in this trial.  
 
In addition, as with any study, there is a risk of bias. Objective evaluation methods may be used in 
conjunction with subjective evaluation methods when feasible.   The value of the compensation to 
the clinical investigator for con ducting the study is not influenced by [CONTACT_81906].  If 
photographic results are listed as the primary objective , they are to be evaluated by [CONTACT_81907].  If information concerning investigator assessment of 
improvement or investigator satisfaction is collected , then it is not listed as an objective for the study.  
 
All other known risks will be disclosed to the subject via the informed consent process. Since this 
is an elective procedure and the subjects are vo lunteers, it can be assumed that their signature [CONTACT_81924].  
 
The risks to the subjects who participate in this study are the same as those for the subject 
undergoing similar non-ablative  radiofrequency treatment. It is possible to have an adverse 
reaction to the TempSure device  use. There may be some side effects that w e don’t know about 
yet. 
 
3.3 Risk Analysis  
 
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION : 
Radiofrequency (RF) technology is commonly used in surgery, noninvasive treatments and 
aesthetic applications. RF technology is a safe method for non -ablative (A non -wounding device 
treatment which heats underlying skin) treatment because energy can be pre cisely delivered 
through the skin to the dermal tissue beneath without damaging the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196].  
 
Aging skin shows decreased collagen synthesis and alteration of fiber networks. By [CONTACT_81908] (which is comprised of collagen, elastic fibers and ground substance), both 
immediate effects (collagen contraction) and long -term effects (woun d-healing response with 
neocollagen production) will occur. RF -induced thermal injury to the dermal tissue will produce a 
microinflammatory response to induce collagen denaturation, contraction, and subsequent 
synthesis  as well as elastin and ground substa nce production.[ADDRESS_89155] activation, fibroplasia and neocollagenesis in the 
different skin layers is based on a complex multivariate mechanism, which depends on the 
temperature distribution and timing.2 Further investigation of paramete r optimization is necessary 
to achieve safe and efficacious results.

Version  4.0: January 20, [ADDRESS_89156] and data risks.  
 
ASSESSMENT OF BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION:    
The subject may or may not have improvement in  their facial wrinkles . 
 
CONSIDERATION OF PATIENT PREFERENCE INFORMATION:  
Many physicians support the use of radiofrequency devices for non -invasive cosmetic treatments 
due to current patient satisfaction of co smetic results with the currently available devices. 
However, there is still a level of interest in novel technologies that could reduce the need for future 
treatments.  
 
ASSESSMENT OF UNCERTAINTY:  
There is uncertainty of efficacy results while using the TempSure  device in this study.  
 
CONCLUSION:  
This device is determined to be a non -significant risk study  and will be using a handpi[INVESTIGATOR_81866] . The Icon device is cleared for u se by [CONTACT_81909].  The risks posed to the subjects and integrity of data are 
acceptable .

they may contact [CONTACT_81914].  
The Investigator and/or desig nated study staff will review each event and asse ss its relationship to 
the study device  (not related, unlikely, possible, probable, and highly probable). The following 
definitions will be used for rating relationship to the TempSure® treatments:  
• Not rela ted – The event is clearly related to other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject.  
• Unlikely – The event was most likely produced by [CONTACT_1605]’ s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions, or a concomitant medication administered to the subject; and 
does not follow a known response pattern to the investigational product.  
• Possible – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational 
product administration; and/or  follows a known response pattern to the study sampling 
sessions; but could have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications admini stered to the subject.

• Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational 
product administration; and follows a known response pattern to the investigational product; 
and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_81915]’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject.  
• Highly Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
investigational product administration; and follows a known response pattern to the 
investigational product; and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11260]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to 
the subject; and either occurs immediately following investigational product administration, or 
improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_81888], or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a 
positive reaction at the application site.  
 
Each adverse event reported will be graded on a 3 -point severity.  Using t he following 
definitions for rating severity will be used:  
• Mild – easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, and not interfering with normal everyday  
activities.  
• Moderate – sufficiently discomforting and may interfere with normal everyday activities.  
• Severe – incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities.  
 
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is any adverse device experience that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  death, a life -threatening adver se device experience, in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81889], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may or may not result in death, be life -
threatening,  or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse device experience 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or subject may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed i n this definition  
 
If any of the above adverse events are serious as defined by [CONTACT_58317] 
(CFR), Title 21, special procedures will be followed.  All serious adverse events will be reported 
within [ADDRESS_89168] to follow -up.  Adverse events will be captured 
throughout the study and where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to 
document the resolution of event(s). Outcomes may be classified as resolved, improved, 
unchanged, worse, fatal, unknown or lost to follow -up.  Following the resolution of any study -
associated adverse events there will be no further adverse event reports for that subject.

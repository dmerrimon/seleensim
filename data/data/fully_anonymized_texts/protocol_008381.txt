Title of Study:  A Phase 3, Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Vehicle Controlled Clinical Study to 
Assess the Safety and Efficacy of IDP-12 2 in the Treatment of Plaque Psoriasis 
Number of clinical centers:  Multicenter, approximately 12-16 inve stigational centers in North America 
Objective: 
The objective of the study is to ev aluate the safety and efficacy of to pi[INVESTIGATOR_249238]-122 Lotion when applied once 
daily to adult subjects with moderate to severe plaq ue psoriasis (defined as an Investigator’s Global 
Assessment [IGA] score of 3 or 4). The intent of the study is specifically to  evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
a once daily application of IDP-122 Lotion in comparison with vehicle. 
Methodology: 
This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel- group study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy of IDP-[ADDRESS_303141] a clini cal diagnosis of moderate to severe psoriasis (defined as an IGA score of 
3 or 4). 
Approximately 210 subjects who meet the study entry cr iteria will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 
IDP-122 (HP 0.01%) Lotion and IDP-[ADDRESS_303142] at the Baseline visit. The study drug will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_249239] (as determined by [CONTACT_45010]) once daily for [ADDRESS_303143]-baseline study visits (Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8) the 
subjects will be asked to return their containers of study drug which will be evaluated for drug usage 
compliance. Upon completion of the 8-week treatment period, all subjects will be asked to return to the 
investigational center [ADDRESS_303144]-treatment cessation follow-up visit (Week 12). During the study, subjects will be allowed to use investigator approved no n-medicated cleansers, moisturizers and sunscreens; 
no other skin care products will be permitted on the treatment areas. The investigator will assess the areas affected by [CONTACT_249261]. 
All areas affected by [CONTACT_22803] (with an affected body  surface area [BSA] of 3%-12%, inclusive) are to be 
treated with study drug . The affected areas (3%-12% BSA) will not include face, s calp, palms, soles, groin, 
axillae, and intertriginous areas. Information on report ed and observed adverse events (AEs) will be obtained 
at each visit. An abbreviated physical examination will be  performed at Baseline, W eek 8 (end of treatment), 
and Week 12 (4-week post-treatment cessation follow-up visit) for all subjects. Blood samples for complete blood count with differe ntial (CBC/Diff) and serum ch emistry will be collected 
from subjects at Screening, Week 4, and Week 8. For all female subjects of childbearing potential, urine and 
serum pregnancy testing will be performed at Screen ing. Urine pregnancy testing will be performed at 
Baseline (prior to randomization) and Week 12 (4-week post-treatment follow-up visit), and serum pregnancy 
testing will also be conducted at Week 4 and Week 8. 
Subjects who terminate study participation early will be asked to complete all Week 8 assessments, as 
appropriate, prior to commencement of any alterna tive therapy for psoriasis (if possible). Subjects who 
discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced and these subjects may be asked to 
return for the 4-week follow-up vis it after the last treatment visit. 
 
Protocol V01-122A-301, IDP-122 Phase 3  Valeant Research & Development 
Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, [ADDRESS_303145] to temporarily interrupt use of the study drug and to resume application of the study drug 
once the signs/symptoms have subsided. The investigator should try to minimize study drug interruptions; and 
if needed, make best efforts to limit a “drug holiday” to 4 days. If the study drug interruption does exceed 4 consecutive days, the investigator should consult with th e medical monitor to determine a course of action. If 
the study drug is interrupted, discontinued, or a concomitant medication is used to treat a sign/symptom, an adverse event shall be recorded. 
Subjects who discontinue from the study, due to clini cally significant laboratory abnormalities or AEs will 
return for the 4-week follow-up visit after the last treatme nt visit and will be instructed to follow-up with their 
primary care physician, if indicated. If any subject who has an AE, during  the treatment period, the subject 
will be followed by [CONTACT_117186] (return to normal or to the baseline state) or stabilization, 
as determined by [CONTACT_093]. 
In addition, application of study drug may be delayed or halted at any time if ongoing safety data evaluations 
(including reports of local skin reacti ons, such as skin atrophy, or severe AEs) raise concern for subject safety. 
If the subject participation is suspended, all of the subject’s safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_249262]. 
Number of subjects planned: 
Approximately 210 adult subjects (approximately 15 subjects per investigational center) with moderate or 
severe psoriasis (defined as an IGA score of 3 or 4)  will be enrolled and randomized in the study. With a 
2:1 randomization ratio, it is anticipated that:

 5 Introduction 
Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-med iated disease that varies wide ly in its clinical expression. 
Disease severity ranges from mild (limited number  of plaques) to very severe. Characteristic 
features of psoriasis include hyperprolifera tion of epi[INVESTIGATOR_249244]/epi[INVESTIGATOR_249245], resulting in shar ply demarcated red plaques, which may be 
covered by [CONTACT_249277]. 
There are presently no curative treatments for psoriasis. Treatment options focus on relieving 
symptoms, reducing inflammation, induration, and scaling, and controlling the extent of the disease. Patient age, severity of disease, and the type and extent  of body surface area (BSA) 
involvement are considerati ons in selecting therapy. 
Biologic treatments are now either available or in development to treat psoriasis. However, 
these treatments are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_249246], and their safety  profile is not entirely 
well understood. 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_249247], but may be impr actical when psoriasis 
involves a large BSA. The mainstay of psoriasi s treatment is topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], which 
range in potency from superpotent to low pot ency (Class I to Class VII, respectively). 
Generally, the more potent corticosteroids are required for effective management of 
psoriasis. Although topi[INVESTIGATOR_249248], long-term  safety remains a concern, 
particularly with the more potent ones. Adverse effects such as skin atrophy, telangiectasia, 
and potential hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal ax is suppression have been associated with 
higher potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_249249]. Ultravate
® cream and 
ointment (halobetasol propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] [HP] 0.05%) is currently on the market and are classified as 
super-high potency (Class I) corticosteroids indi cated for the relief of the inflammatory and 
pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.  
Having a lower concentration product that is a Class I steroid might be advantageous for 
patients, as the steroid provi des relief from inflammation, and may reduce the adverse 
reactions associated with a steroid (eg, skin atrophy). 
6 Study Objectives and Purpose 
The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_249238]-122 Lotion 
when applied once daily to adult subjects with m oderate to severe plaque psoriasis (defined 
as an Investigator’s Global Assessment [IGA] score of 3 or 4). The intent of the study is 
specifically to evaluate the safety and efficacy  of a once daily application of IDP-122 Lotion 
in comparison with vehicle.

 7 Investigational plan 
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomize d, parallel-group study designed to assess the 
safety and efficacy of IDP-[ADDRESS_303172] a clinical diagnosis of moderate to 
severe psoriasis (defined as an IGA score of 3 or 4). 
Approximately 210 subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 
2:1 ratio to receive IDP- 122 (HP 0.01%) Lotion and IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion, respectively. 
The assigned study drug will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_249250] (as determined by [CONTACT_249278]) once daily for [ADDRESS_303173]-baseline study visits (Weeks 2, 4, 6, a nd 8) the subjects will be asked to return 
their used containers of study drug. Subjects w ill be asked to not apply study drug on day of 
clinic visit so that subject can apply during the visit after assessmen ts are completed. Upon 
completion of the 8-week treatment period, a ll subjects will be aske d to return to the 
investigational center 4 weeks later for a pos t-treatment cessation follow-up visit (Week 12). 
During the study, each subject will only be permitted to use Investigator approved non-
medicated cleansers, moisturizers and sunscreens; no other skin car e products will be 
permitted on the treatment areas. 
The investigator will assess the treatable areas affected by [CONTACT_249261]. All 
treatable areas affected by [CONTACT_249279] (with an affected BSA of 3%-12%) 
are to be treated with study drug. The treatable affected areas will not include the face, scalp, 
palms, soles, axillae, and intertriginous areas . If palms and soles are affected, study drug may 
be applied at the discretion of the investigator ; however, these areas will not be included in 
treatable BSA or efficacy assessments. Information on reported and observed adverse events  (AEs) will be obtained at each visit. An 
abbreviated physical examination will be perfor med at Baseline, Week 8 (end of treatment), 
and Week 12 (the 4-week post-treatment ce ssation follow-up visit) for all subjects.

 Blood samples for complete blood count with differential (CBC/Diff) and serum chemistry 
will be collected from subjects at Screening, W eek 4, and Week 8. For all female subjects of 
childbearing potential, urine and serum pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening and 
confirmed at baseline with a urine pregnancy test prior to randomization. Serum pregnancy 
tests will also be conducted at weeks [ADDRESS_303174] will be 
performed at Week 12 (4-week post-treatment follow-up visit). 
The Dermatology Life Quality Index ques tionnaire (DLQI) questionnaire will be 
administered to subjects at Day 0 (Baseline), Week 4, Week 8/End of Treatment and Week 
12 (4-week post-treatment follow-up visit). 
Subjects who terminate study participation earl y will be asked to complete all Week 8 
assessments, as appropriate, prior to commencem ent of any alternative therapy for psoriasis 
(if possible). Subjects who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be 
replaced and these subjects may be asked to come back for the 4-week post-treatment cessation follow-up visit.

Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, [ADDRESS_303181] Withdrawal Criteria 
Reasons for withdrawal may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Psoriasis flare, as determined by [CONTACT_093], which requires treatment with a 
disallowed therapy. 
 Either at the investigator's request, for tolerability reasons (e.g., severe adverse 
reactions), or at th e subject’s request. 
 When the requirements of the protocol are not followed. 
 When a concomitant therapy likely to inte rfere with the results of the study is 
reported, or required by [CONTACT_423] (the investigators will report all such 
information on the source documents/electronic case report forms (eCRFs) and decide, in accordance with the sponsor, whether the subject is to be withdrawn). 
 When a subject is lost to follow-up. The investigators will try twice to reach the 
subject by [CONTACT_94598] a follo w-up letter by [CONTACT_249280]-up. These actions  will be reported on 
the End of Study eCRF and a copy of th e follow-up letter maintained in the

9 Treatment Plan 
9.1 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
This is a double-blinded study, in which the identity of the study drug will be unknown to 
investigator/evaluator and subjects, as well as  all individuals closel y associated with the 
study. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of the 2 study drug groups in a ratio of 2:1 (IDP-122 
[HP 0.01%] Lotion: IDP-122 Vehicl e Lotion). Each screened subject will be assigned a 
unique 6-digit study subject number assigned by [CONTACT_3433] e investigational cente r, which will consist 
of the 3-digit investigational center/site number (pre-assigne d by [CONTACT_3211]/designee) and the 
3-digit chronological screen ing order number, starting with 001 (e.g., 101001, 101002). The 
study drug kit will be assigned to subjects base d on a randomization code and kits will be 
dispensed to the subjects at Baseline.  A study drug log will document the inventory and 
dispensing of study drug at each investigational center.

 9.3 Unblinding  
The treatment assignments for all enrolled s ubjects will be unblinded only after the 
conclusion of the study. Specifically, the blind will be broken only after al l data are verified, 
entered into the database, and validated; subject evaluability assessments are performed and 
entered into the database; and the database is locked. 
In the case of a medical emergency, the inve stigator can break the blind for the subject 
involved preferably by [CONTACT_249284] 
(or designee) immediately. After confirmation, the investigator will be contact[CONTACT_249285] a sponsor representati ve. The investigator will record the code 
break in the subject’s source documents. 
9.[ADDRESS_303184] psoria sis that was previously nonresponsive to 
prescription medications, per the Investigators’ best clinical judg ment. Subjects must also not 
be using lithium or Plaquenil. Any concomitant therapy stopped for washout as indicated 
below is to be recorded. As noted in the ex clusion criteria, there are mandatory washout 
periods and restrictions during the study. Specifically: 
 Received treatment with any topi[INVESTIGATOR_249241] 14 days 
prior to the Baseline visit 
 Within [ADDRESS_303185] used any 
phototherapy (including la ser), photochemotherapy, or non-biologic systemic 
psoriasis therapy (such as newer oral ps oriasis medications (e g Otezla), systemic 
corticosteroids, methotrexate, retinoids or cyclosporine) 
 Has used immunomodulatory therapy (biolo gics) known to affect psoriasis within 
3 months of the Baseline visit 
 Within [ADDRESS_303186] had prolonged 
exposure to natural or artificial sources of ultrav iolet radiation 
 Within 60 days or 5 drug half-lives (w hichever is longer) pr ior to the Baseline 
visit, subjects must not have received treatment with any i nvestigational drug or 
device and may not be concurrently particip ating in another clin ical study with an 
investigational drug or device 
Subjects are allowed only the use of invest igator approved non- medicated cleansers, 
moisturizers, and sunscreens in the treatment areas. Protocol exclude d areas (face, scalp, 
axillae, and intertriginous ar eas) may be treated with OTC 1% hydrocortisone cream, tar 
shampoos or allowed moisturizers.

 Protocol excluded areas of palm s and soles may be treated with study drug but will not be 
included in the BSA or IGA assessments. If palms and soles are treated, they may be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_249286]. 
Subjects using concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_165838] c ourse of the study that could interfere with 
the interpretation of the study re sults (including but not limite d to those listed above) should 
not be withdrawn, but the use of the concomita nt product should be discontinued. No other 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786] (except as noted above) ot her than the study drug will be permitted for 
psoriasis. 
Information on concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_249254]. Any ther apy used by [CONTACT_249287] (e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], Tylenol, birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], vitamins, moisturizers, sunscreens). Every attempt should be made to keep concomitant therapy dosing 
constant during the study. Any change to concomitant therapy should be noted on the Concomitant Therapy source document and eCRF. 
9.[ADDRESS_303187]’s compliance with applying th e study drug. A 
subject who deviates significantly from the prescribed application amount will be counseled. Any missed applications of study drug will be noted by [CONTACT_249288], which will be collected and placed in the appropriate sour ce document. Missed applications will be 
documented in the eCRF. 
9.[ADDRESS_303188] follow the instructions exactly.  
A deviation from the protocol is an uninte nded and/or unanticipated departure from the

 A protocol violation occurs when there is nonadherence to the protocol that results in a 
significant, additional risk to the patient, when the patient or i nvestigator has failed to adhere 
to significant protocol requirements (inclusi on/exclusion criteria) and the patient was 
enrolled without prior sponsor approval, or wh en there is nonadherenc e to FDA regulations 
and/or ICH GCP guideline. 
The investigator or designee must docum ent and explain in the patients’ source 
documentation any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a 
deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study 
patients without prior IRB/IEC approval. As so on as possible after such an occurrence, the 
implemented deviation or change, the r easons for it, and any proposed protocol 
amendment(s) should be submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval, to the sponsor for agreement, and to the regul atory authorities, if required.

 11.5.2 Documenting Adverse Experiences 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that o ccur during the course of 
the study. The AEs should be documented as a si ngle medical diagnosis. When this is not 
possible, the AE should be docum ented in terms of signs and/ or symptoms observed by [CONTACT_249302] e subject at each study visit. 
All AEs occurring after the subject signs the informed consent through the last study visit 
must be reported, regardless of whether or not  the AEs are considered drug-related. All AEs, 
whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_3991], or reported 
spontaneously by [CONTACT_423], will be recorded. 
At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and 
ongoing AEs. Cutaneous tolerability signs and symp toms that result in the subject’s requiring 
a concomitant therapy or discontinuation from  the study will be reported as an AE. The 
following data will be collected on all AE s and recorded on the appropriate eCRF:

any dose: 
 Results in death 
 Is immediately life threaten ing, (the term "life threaten ing" in the definition of 
"serious" refers to an event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an even t which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe) 
 Requires in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31645]

 11.5.5 Assessment of Causality 
The investigator should assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug as either 
“Related” or “Not Related”. The following s hould be taken into account when assessing SAE 
causality: 
 Positive temporal relationship to study drug, such as if the study drug was 
withdrawn and the SAE resolved or th e event recurred after re introduction. 
 If there is a reasonable possi bility that the AE is asso ciated with an underlying or 
concomitant illness. 
 Possible association with previous or concomitant therapy. 
 No temporal relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely alternative 
etiology exists. 
 If the AE is directly rela ted to study procedures or th ere is a lack of efficacy. 
11.5.6 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Adverse events classified as “serious” require  expeditious handling a nd reporting to sponsor 
or designee within [ADDRESS_303212] be immediately reported to the 
medical monitor within 24 hours of the investigat or’s awareness of the event. All SAEs must 
be reported via confirmed facsimile transmission and must be submitted on a written SAE 
report form signed by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours of the investigator ’s awareness of the 
event. 
The fax number for reporting an SAE is: 
 
 
           
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event 
before notifying Medical Monitor of an SAE.  If only limited information is initially 
available, follow-up reports are required. Addi tional relevant information such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249257]/designee as soon as they are 
available. Should the investigator  become aware of an SAE (rega rdless of its relationship to 
investigational product) that occurs within [ADDRESS_303213] be reported in accordance with pr ocedures specified in this protocol.

 The investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure  the safety of the subjects, 
notably he/she should follow a subject with an SAE until the event has resolved or the 
condition has stabilized. This may imply that follow-up will continue after the subject has 
left the study, and that additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_456]. 
11.5.7 Expedited Serious Adverse Event Reports 
An AE, whether serious or nonserious, is de signated unexpected (unlabeled) if it is not 
reported in the clinical safety section of the Investigator Brochure or if the event is of greater 
frequency, specificity or severity. 
Expedited SAE reports are those that are bot h unexpected based on the reference document 
(Investigator Brochure or Package Insert) and are related (i.e., the relationship cannot be 
ruled out) to the study drug. Thes e expedited reports are subject to reporting timelines of 7 
and/or 15 calendar days to the regulatory repor ting agency(ies). Valeant Pharmaceuticals will 
notify regulatory authoriti es of these AEs and all participating investigational centers in 
writing for submission by [CONTACT_249303] e IRB/IEC. This notification will be in the 
form of a Safety Update to the Invest igator Brochure (i.e., “15-day letter”). 
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the 
Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible 
IRB/IEC according to local regulations. The inve stigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the 
informed consent requires revi sion. The investigator should al so comply with the IRB/IEC 
procedures for reporting any other safety information. 
11.5.[ADDRESS_303214](s) must be obtained by [CONTACT_249304]’s source documentation. Any laboratory test result th at meets the criteria for an SAE must also

menstrual period). 
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study 
enrollment, the study drug must be withheld unt il the results of labor atory pregnancy testing 
are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study drug and must 
not be enrolled in the study. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving study 
treatment, the study drug must immediately be withheld until the resu lt of pregnancy testing 
is known. If pregnancy is confirmed, the study drug will be permanently discontinued and the 
subject will be followed until the pregnancy come s to term. A Pregnancy Report form will be 
submitted to the sponsor, initially and at the end of the pregnancy, which includes the outcome of the pregnancy and any complicati ons occurring during th e pregnancy or the 
delivery. 
All confirmed pregnancies must be immediatel y reported to the medical monitor within 24 
hours of the investigator’s awar eness of the pregnancy. All co nfirmed pregnancies must be 
reported via confirmed facsimile transmission and must be submitted on a written Pregnancy 
Report form within 24 hours of the inve stigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. 
12 Statistics 
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. No interim 
analyses are planned. Except where noted, all st atistical tests will be two-sided and will be 
performed at the 0.05 le vel of significance. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of  the efficacy and safety results. 
For categorical parameters, the number and percen tage of subjects in ea ch category will be 
presented. For continuous parameters, descrip tive statistics will in clude n (number of 
subjects), mean, standard deviation, medi an, minimum, and maximum. Appropriate 
inferential statistics will be used for the primary and secondary efficacy variables. The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be the method of Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. As a sensitivity analysis, the last observation 
carried forward method (LOCF) will be used (i.e., the last available on-therapy observation 
for a subject will be used to estimate subseque nt missing data points). No imputations will be 
made for missing safety data. 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses  will be provided as a 
separate document. The SAP will be finalized  prior to unblinding of the study treatments.

12.1.4 Pooling Analysis 
The clinical study will be conducted under a common protocol for each investigational site 
with the intention of pooling the data for analysis. Every effort will be made to promote consistency in study execution at each study site . The study is intended to be conducted in a 
manner such that a minimum of 15 subjects w ill be randomized and included in the ITT 
population (i.e., approximately at least [ADDRESS_303223] 5 subjects 
in the Vehicle arm) for any investigator. In the event that there are too few subjects in a 
treatment arm for an investigator, then the invest igator’s data will be combined to achieve the 
desired sample size minimum per treatment arm. The combining of investigator data will be 
accomplished by [CONTACT_249307] e smallest enrollment and combining it with 
the investigator with the largest,  restricted to investigational sites that did not meet minimum 
enrollment. If there is a further need to combin e data, then the data of the investigator with 
the second smallest enrollment will be combined with the investigator's data which had the 
second largest enrollment, and so on. This process will continue for all investigators who did not have a minimum of [ADDRESS_303224] insufficient subjects per treatment ar m will result in redefining the groups of 
investigators for the purposes of statistical an alyses. These combined groups will be referred 
to as "analysis centers" in the statistical analyses.

Protocol V01-122A-301, IDP-122 Phase 3 Valeant Research & Development 
Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, [ADDRESS_303226] will be investigated to determ ine if the main site-to-site variability is such 
that it could mask the analysis center effects. Thus, prior to pooling, th e percent of subjects 
with treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed  with a logistic regr ession with factors of 
treatment group, site, and th e interaction term of treatment group by [CONTACT_3725]. If  the analysis is not 
computationally feasible due to some s ites having very few subjects enrolled, the 
low-enrolling sites will be excluded from the analysis. 
12.1.5 Missing Efficacy Data Imputations 
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be MCMC multiple imputation. 
This method does not rely on the assumption of data missing at random. Additionally, 
imputation will be conducted within each treat ment group independently , so the pattern of 
missing observations in 1 treatment group canno t influence missing value estimations in 
another. 
For each efficacy variable (IGA and psoriasis signs), the following steps will be performed to 
impute missing data: 
1. Calculate the number of missing Week 8 valu es to be estimated by [CONTACT_249308]. Let nmiss be the maximu m number of missing Week 8 values 
among the treatment groups. 
2. For each treatment group, create a data set containing subjects with observed values 
and those needing estimation by [CONTACT_85222]. The missing efficacy data in each data set 
will be filled in using the MCMC method ‘5 x nmiss’ times to generate ‘5 x nmiss’ 
data sets. The resulting data set for ea ch treatment group will be combined into 
1 complete data set for each imputation. Options will be included in each imputation 
process to prevent estimating values to be out side the range of expected values for the 
assessment. 
3. Imputed data will be used to determine dichotomized success/failure values. 
4. Each complete data set will be analyzed with the appropriate CMH test. 
5. CMH statistics will be normalized using the Wilson-Hilferty transformation. 
6. The results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference using SAS PROC MIANALYZE.

Treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed as it was in the primary analyses. Comparisons 
will be performed on imputed data using CM H tests stratified by [CONTACT_85229]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Repeated Measures Analysis on Observed Data 
As a second sensitivity analysis, treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed with a 
repeated measures logistic regression model (generalized  estimating equations), with 
treatment success as the dependent variable  and treatment, analysis center and visit 
(Weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8) as  independent factors. 
12.1.7 Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses will be conducted for the ITT population for the following subgroups: 
Baseline IGA, sex, age, ethnicity, and race. Age will be dichotomized to less than the median 
age of subjects and greater than or equal to  the median age of subjects. Subgroup analyses 
will be conducted on the primary efficacy e ndpoint and will contain only descriptive 
statistics. 
12.2 Assessment of Safety 
12.2.1 Adverse Events 
The primary analysis of safety will be conducted at Week 8.  There will be a tabulation, however, of the AE’s that start in the period post the Week 8 to Week 12 visit.  All AEs 
occurring during the study will be recorded and classified using terminology from the Medical Dictionary for Regulat ory Activities (MedDRA). All reported treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), defined as any AE with an onset on or after the date of first study 
drug application, will be summarized by [CONTACT_249309], system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to 
study drug. When summarizing TEAEs  by [CONTACT_59222], each subject 
will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term using the event with the greatest severity or causality, respec tively, within each category. All reported SAEs 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_119117], system organ class, 
preferred term, severity, a nd relationship to study drug.

prematurely discontinue from the study due to AEs will be provided as well as a listing of 
subjects who reported an SAE. 
12.2.2 Local Skin Reactions 
The frequency of local skin reactions incl uding itching, dryness,  burning/stinging, skin 
atrophy, striae, telangiectasia and folliculitis  will be summarized by [CONTACT_29013]. Additionally, the percen t of subjects who experience a local skin reaction (itching, 
dryness, burning/stinging) graded at a level of 3, at any point in the study following the first 
application of study drug, will be  tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].

Approximately 210 adult subjects with moderate or  severe psoriasis (defined as an IGA score 
of 3 or 4) will be enrolled and randomized in the study. With a 2:1 randomization ratio, it is 
anticipated that: 
 Approximately 140 subjects will be randomized to receive IDP-122 (HP 0.01%) 
Lotion 
 Approximately 70 subjects will be random ized to receive IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
Efficacy analyses will be performed using th e intent-to-treat (ITT)  population and the per 
protocol (PP) population. The I TT analysis set will be consider ed primary for the evaluation 
of efficacy. Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population. 
All subjects who are randomized and dispen sed study drug will be included in the ITT 
analysis set. All subjects who are randomized, receive at le ast [ADDRESS_303229]-baseline safety assessment will be included in the safety analysis set. 
All subjects in the ITT analysis set who co mplete the Week 8 visit without any major 
protocol violations wi ll be included in the PP analysis  set. The PP population will include 
subjects in the ITT population who did not  meet any of the following criteria: 
 Violated the inclusi on/exclusion criteria 
 Used an interfering concomitant medication 
 Did not attend the Week 8 visit 
 Missed more than [ADDRESS_303230]-baseline study visit prior to Week 8 
 Have not been compliant with the dosi ng regimen (i.e., subjects must apply 
80%-120% of the expected applications of study medication during participation in the study) 
 Out of visit window at the Week 8 visit by [CONTACT_726] ± 5 days

12.8.2 Sample Size Determination 
The following power calculations were computed using the observed Week 8 dichotomized 
IGA efficacy data in the I TT population from the Phase 2 study V01-118A-201. SAS PROC 
POWER with the Fisher’s exact  test option was used to ca lculate the power for various 
sample sizes using a two-sided test with an  alpha of 0.05. Table 5 presents the efficacy 
estimates derived from study V01-118A-201.

study (IDP 122 Vehicle Lotion). 
 
One hundred forty (140) IDP-122 treated subjects and seventy (70) vehicle treated subjects 
will have greater than 95% power to detect a st atistically significant outcome for a two-sided 
test with an alpha level of 0.05.  
It was noted that the estima tes extracted from the above studies are based on the LOCF 
method of handling missing values while the proposed Phase 3 analysis will account for 
missing values using multiple imputations. The power stated above sufficiently exceeds 95% 
which will compensate for the difference in handling of missing data.

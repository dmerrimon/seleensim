A Prospective Double Blind Randomized Control Trial Comparing the 
Standard-Of-Care (SOC) Prescription Analgesic to an Over-The-Counter 
(OTC) Analgesic Protocol In Managing Postoperative Pain After 
Ureteroscopy with Stent Placement

[INVESTIGATOR_128558] a research pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. The purpose of this research is to 
determine if Over-The-Counter analgesia (pain relief medicine) works the same at relieving pain 
as the Standard of Care narcotic based analgesia that we normally prescribe for stent colic after 
ureteroscopy.  You are invited to be in this study because you will be undergoing ureteroscopy. 
Your participation in this research will involve two clinic visits and last about [ADDRESS_144983]

making your decision as to whether or not you wish to participate. Ask your study doctor or the 
study staff to explain any words or information contained in this informed consent document that 
you do not understand. You may also discuss the study with your friends and family.
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?
The purpose of this research study is to compare how well two medications work to control post-
operative pain.  One of the medications is normally prescribed for pain following ureteroscopy. 
The other medication is a common over-the-counter pain reliever.
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?
Approximately 100 people at one research site will take part in this study. 
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY?
You will be randomized into one of two study groups described below. Randomization means 
that you are put into a group by [CONTACT_3364]. It is like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin. You will have an equal chance 
of being placed in each group.
During this study, you will be placed into a group that either is provided with the standard of 
care pain medication called Norco (a narcotic pain medication) or you will receive Ibuprofen (a 
non-steroidal pain medication that is available without a prescription) for post-operative pain 
management . Neither you nor the investigator or other people involved in the study will know 
which medication. you are receiving. This is done so that a fair evaluation of results can be 
made. This information is available to the researchers if needed in an emergency.
No matter which medication you will receive, you will be evaluated in a standard fashion with 
blood work to measure your blood counts, electrolytes and kidney function as well as a urine 
culture.  You will need to see the anesthesiologist prior to surgery to evaluate your heart and 
lungs for surgery.  After surgery, we plan to send you home after spending about an hour in the 
surgery recovery room.  You will then follow up in [ADDRESS_144985]

HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY?
You will be in the study for about [ADDRESS_144986] residual 
stones which could cause bleeding, pain, infection, kidney blockage, or kidney failure. 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?
Being in this study involves some risk to you. You should discuss the risk of being in this study 
with the study staff. 
There are also risks and side effects associated with Ibuprofen which include
-stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, kidney damage, liver damage
 
There are also risks and side effects associated with Norco which include
- stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, liver damage, slow 
breathing, tiny pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], loss of consciousness, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827]/dependence
This study is comparing two approved methods for treating pain.  You will be randomly assigned 
to one of the two groups. It is possible that one treatment group may have a better response than 
the other. Therefore, there is a risk that you may be assigned to a group that does not perform as 
well as its comparison and your pain relief may not be adequate.
In addition, there is a slight risk of a breach of confidentiality.  We will do our best to protect 
your confidential information.  There also may be other side effects that we cannot predict. You 
should tell the research staff about all the medications, vitamins and supplements you take and 
any medical conditions you have. This may help avoid side effects, interactions and other risks.
Taking part in this research study may involve providing information that you consider 
confidential or private.  Efforts, such as coding research records, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_128559], will be made to keep 
your information safe.
Reproductive Risks and other Issues to Participating in Research
Due to unknown risks and potential harm to the unborn fetus, sexually active women of 
childbearing potential must use a reliable method of birth control while participating in this 
study. Reliable methods of birth control are: abstinence (not having sex), oral contraceptives, 
intrauterine device (IUD), DepoProvera, tubal ligation, or vasectomy of the partner (with 
confirmed negative sperm counts) in a monogamous relationship (same partner). An acceptable, 
although less reliable, method involves the careful use of condoms and spermicidal foam or gel 
and/or a cervical cap or sponge. We encourage you to discuss this issue further with your

Pregnant women are excluded from participation in this study. Because some methods of birth 
control are not 100% reliable, a pregnancy test is required at least [ADDRESS_144988] normal 
menstrual period, if you are a sexually active woman of childbearing potential.
ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?
You are not expected to receive any direct benefit from taking part in this research study. We 
hope the information learned from this study will benefit other people in the future.
WHAT OTHER CHOICES ARE THERE?
You do not have to be in this study to receive treatment. You should talk to your doctor about all 
the choices you have. Instead of being in this study, you have the option of choosing a surgical or 
non-surgical treatment option of your choice.  These options include observation with medical 
expulsive therapy, ureteroscopy, mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy or shock wave lithotripsy.

coverage for the usual and customary medical fees for reasonable and necessary treatment of 
such injuries or illnesses. To the extent research insurance coverage is available under this policy 
the reasonable costs of these necessary medical services will be paid, up to a maximum of 
$25,000. Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center holds the insurance policy for this 
coverage. It provides a maximum of $25,000 coverage for each claim and is limited to a total of

 SYNOPSIS 
Protocol Title:  A Single -Center Evaluation of the Relative Efficacy of 
EM-100 Compared to Zaditor ® (Ketotifen Fumarate 
Ophthalmic Solution 0.0 35%) and Vehicle in the 
Treatment  of Ocular Itching Associated with Allergic 
Conjunctivitis as Induced by [CONTACT_704393] (Ora -CAC®)  
 
Protocol Number:  17-100-[ADDRESS_957026]:  EM-100 topi[INVESTIGATOR_704380]:  3 
Primary Objective(s):  To demonstrate the non -inferiority of EM-100 to Zaditor® 
in the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic 
conjunctivitis.  
Secondary Objective(s):   To demonst rate that EM-100 is superior to vehicle in 
the tre atment of ocular itching associated with allergic 
conjunctivitis.  
 To demonstrate that Zaditor® is superior to vehicle in 
the treatment  of ocular itching associated with allergic 
conjunctivitis.  
 To demonstrate that EM-100 is non -inferior to 
Zaditor® in the treatment of conjunctival redness  
associated with allergic conjunctivitis.    
Overall Study Design:  
Structure:  Screening Period:  At the Screening Visit, subjects will 
sign the informed consent form and an allergic skin test 
will be performed, if required. At Visit 1, each qualifying 
subject will undergo a bilateral conjunctival allergen 
challenge (CAC) titration using an allergen t hey had a 
positive reaction to on their skin test. Subjects who elicit a 
positive reaction post -CAC will undergo the confirmation 
CAC at Visit 2 using the same allergen they qualified with 
at Visit 1.  
Treatment Period:  At Visit 3 , qualifying subjects will be 
enrolled and randomized to receive EM-100, Zaditor®, or 
vehicle of EM-100 in the right eye and one of the other

 two treatments in the left eye . A trained study technician 
will instill one (1) drop of the assigned treatment in the 
right eye and  one (1) drop of  the assigned treatment in the 
left eye  (based on randomization) . Subjects will undergo 
CAC approximately [ADDRESS_957027] .  
Duration:  This study consist s of four (4) office visits (Screening 
Visit, Visit 1, Visit 2, and Visit 3) over a period of 
approximately three  to five (3-5) weeks.  
Controls:   Vehicle of EM-100 topi[INVESTIGATOR_704381]  
 Zaditor ® (ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution  
0.035%, EQ 0.02 5% Base ), ANDA 077200 held by 
[CONTACT_704394].  
Dosage/  Instillation : At Visit 3, qualifying subjects will be enrolled and 
randomized to receive EM-100, Zaditor ®, or Vehicle in 
each eye. The treatment arms are listed below:  
 
 EM-100 in right  eye and Zaditor ® in left eye  
 Zaditor ® in right eye and EM-100 in left eye  
 EM-100 in right  eye and Vehicle in left eye  
 Vehicle in right eye and EM-100 in left eye     
 Zaditor ® in right eye and Vehicle in left eye  
 Vehicle in right eye and Zaditor ® in left eye  
 
A trained study technician will instill one (1) drop of the 
assigned treatment in the right eye  and one  (1) drop of  the 
assigned treatment in the left  eye approximately 15 (+1) 
minutes prior to CAC.   
 
The pre -specified technicians responsible for instilling the 
investigational product will not be involved with any other 
study procedures at the site.

Visit 3  (Day 1):  Enrollment/ Randomization/ In-Office 
Instillation/ Efficacy  CAC / Study Exit  
Measures Taken to Reduce 
Bias:  Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the 
assignment of subjects to investigational product, to 
increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject 
attributes (e.g. demographics and baseline characteristics) 
are evenly balanced across treatment gr oups, and to 
enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across 
treatment groups. Finally, masked treatment will be used 
to reduce potential of bias during data collection and 
evaluation of clinical endpoints.

debilitating condition that significantly impairs the quality of life. Allergic conjunctivitis 
is generally considered a type [ADDRESS_957043] cell degranulation and release of histamine, and a late 
pha
se involving various pro-inflammatory mediators (2). Histamine is the primary 
mediator responsible for the early phase reaction that triggers itching, vasodilation, and 
vascular leakage leading to ocular redness, chemosis, and blepharitis. The early phase 
response occurs within minutes to hours following allergen exposure. The itching 
associated with the early phase allergic reaction has been shown to peak at ~ 5-[ADDRESS_957044] cells also 
synthesize and release cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that initiate a cascade 
of inflammatory events leading to a late-phase reaction involving a variety of pro-
inflammatory mediators including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, cytokines, and 
interleukins and characterized by [CONTACT_704402], neutrophils, and subsequent 
lymphocytes and macrophages into the conjunctival tissues (3, 4). 
Ketotifen is a widely effective therapy for the management of ocular allergies. It has 
de
monstrated rapid onset (≤ 15 minutes) and long duration of action (≥ 8 hours) after 
c
onjunctival allergen challenge (CAC)(5, 6). Ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution 
0.035% was found to be safe, well tolerated, and effective for the prevention of the signs 
a
nd symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis in multiple CAC studies(7-12). In an 
environmental setting, ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution 0.035% was found to 
sa
fely and effectively reduce seasonal allergic conjunctivitis signs and symptoms and 
prevent recurrence(13). 
Ke
totifen fumarate ophthalmic solution 0.035% (Zaditor®/ Zaditen®; [COMPANY_001] 
Ophthalmics) is approved in the [LOCATION_002] and Canada for the temporary prevention 
of ocular itching due to allergic conjunctivitis at a dose of one drop in the affected eye 
twice daily (every 8-12 hours)(14). In 2006, ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic drops 0.035% 
(ketotifen 0.025%; Alaway®; Bausch and Lomb, Inc., and Zaditor®; [COMPANY_001] 
Ophthalmics) were approved by [CONTACT_6581] (FDA) 
for over-the-counter use, with the indication of temporary relief of itchy eyes due to 
pollen, ragweed, grass, animal hair, and dander, at an approved dose of one drop in the 
affected eye twice daily (every 8-12 hours)(15). 
EM-
100 contains ketotifen ophthalmic solution (0.025%) as a non-preserved formulation 
in si
ngle-dose vials. This is a single-center, randomized, double-masked study to 
establish the therapeutic equivalence of EM-100 to Zaditor® (ketotifen fumarate

tre
atment of ocular itching following CAC (15 minutes following study medication 
instillation).  The vehicle is included for assay validation.   
2 STU
DY OBJECTIVES 
Primary: 
 To demonstrate the non-inferiority of EM - 100 to Z aditor ® in the treatment of 
oc
ular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.  
Secondary: 
 To d emonstrate that EM-100 is superior to vehicle in the treatment of ocular 
itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. 
 To d emonstrate that Zaditor ® is superior to vehicle in the treatment of ocular 
itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis 
 To de monstrate that EM - 100 is non -inferior to Z aditor ® in the treatment of 
c
onjunctival redness associated with allergic conjunctivitis.  
3 CLINICAL HYPOTHESES 
The clinical hypotheses are:  
 EM- [ADDRESS_957045] instillation.  
 EM- 100  is non-inferior to Zaditor® in the treatment of ocular itching associated

 Withdrawal Criteria (if applicable) 5.[ADDRESS_957054]’s safety has been 
compromised, the subject may be withdrawn from the study. 
Subjects may withdraw consent from the study at any time. 
Any female will be removed from the study should she become pregnant during the 
course of the study, and she will undergo a pregnancy test at her exit visit for 
confirmation. The pregnancy test must be confirmed by [CONTACT_1192] (2) additional tests and 
confirmed by [CONTACT_458] (or sub-investigator if the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_704383]). If the test result is positive a second and third time, the principal investigator 
(or sub-investigator if the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_704384]) will inform the subject. 
The Investigator will follow-up and document the outcome of the pregnancy and provide 
a copy of the documentation to the sponsor. The Ora Pregnancy Report Form will be used 
to report a pregnancy and follow-up. 
Re
ason for withdrawal will be included in the eCRF, and all efforts should be made to 
schedule the subject for an Exit Visit to complete exit procedures.  Any subject who is 
withdrawn for the study because of an AE will be followed until AE is resolved or as 
clinically required, and the investigator will prepare a written summary of the event and 
document the available follow-up information on the eCRF.   
Sponsor and/or Investigator may discontinue any subject for non-compliance or any valid 
medical reason (see Section 8.5).

 The  pre-specified unmasked technicians responsible for instilling the 
investigational product will not be involved with any other study procedures at the 
site.  Care will be taken to hide the container (vial or bottle) from the subject.   
Dosing will occur in a room where no other subjects, staff, or investigators will 
observe the instillation.   
 
 Investigational product must be stored in a secure area of the clinical site, 
accessible only to the Investigator(s) or designees at room temperature between 
20-25°C (68-77°F).  All investigational product will be returned to inventory after 
use. 
 
 
 In accordance with 21CFR §320.38 and §320.63, samples of both the test article

[ADDRESS_957060]’s participation in the trial (i.e., changes in a subject’s medical treatment 
and/or study related procedures), the study will be discussed with each subject, and 
subjects wishing to participate must give written informed consent using an informed 
consent form (ICF).  The ICF must be the most recent version that has received 
a
pproval/favorable review by a properly constituted Institutional Review Board. Failure 
to obtain a signed ICF renders the subject ineligible for the study. Subjects must be

8.1.5 Methods for Assignment to Treatment Groups: 
All subjects screened for the study who sign an ICF will be assigned a screening number 
that will be entered in the Screening and Enrollment Log. The screening number will 
consist of three (3) digits, starting with 001. Randomization will be used to avoid bias in 
the assignment of subjects to treatment, to increase the likelihood that known and 
unknown subject attributes (e.g., demographics and baseline characteristics) are evenly 
balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons.   
Once a subject meets qualification criteria at Visit 3 (Day 1), he/she will be enrolled and 
ra
ndomized to receive EM-100, Zaditor®, or the vehicle of EM- 100. A separate 
tre
atment will be assigned to each eye. Su bjec ts will be assigned the lowest four (4) digit 
randomization number available.  
 Concurrent Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  8.2
The use of any concurrent medication, prescription or over-the-counter, is to be recorded 
on the subjec
t’s source document and corresponding electronic case report form (eCRF) 
along with the reason the medication was taken.

conjunctivitis  
 will be excluded. 
 Initial Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy : A slit lamp examination will be performed in both 
eyes to exclude subjects with disallowed ocular conditions (see Appendix 2 ). 
Findings of abnormality which are not exclusionary should be recorded as Medical 
History.  
 Review of Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria : A review of protocol inclusion and exclusion 
criteria will be confirmed for each subject. 
 Titration Conjunctival Allergen Challenge (CAC): A conjunctival allergen challenge 
(CAC) will be performed bilaterally with a perennial or seasonal allergen seriall y 
diluted in buffered saline and administered via a micropi[INVESTIGATOR_704386]. 
One drop of a solubilized allergen to which the subject is sensitized, at the weakest 
dilution, will be instilled bilaterally into the conjunctival cul-de-sac.  
If the subject fails to react within 10 (±2) minutes, increasingly concentrated doses 
may be instilled bilaterally at approximately ten-minute intervals until a positive 
reaction is elicited. If increasing doses are required (i.e., for insufficient bilateral 
itching and/or redness as evaluated by a trained technician or the Investigator), doses 
may be skipped. If a positive CAC reaction is not elicited with the first allergen  
), other allergens to which the subject is 
sensitized may be used starting at the lowest dose.  
 Post-CAC Ocular Itching and Conjunctival Redness Assessments : Upon co mpletion 
of the initial titration CAC, subjects will receive an ocular examination by [CONTACT_704407]’s qualification. 
Subjec
ts will be asked to assess their ocular itching.  
A positive CAC at Visit [ADDRESS_957064] positively will be 
excluded from the study.

humans, w
hether or not considered IP-related. An AE can be any unfavorable and 
unint
ended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an IP, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise 
fr
om any use of the IP (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug or 
medical device) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an 
overdose. An AE can arise from any delivery, implantation, or use of a medical device, 
including medical device failure, subject characteristics that may impact medical device 
performance (e.g., anatomical limitations), and therapeutic parameters (e.g., energy 
applied, sizing, dose release, and anatomic fit) associated with medical device use.

from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate 
pages of the eCRF. Any clinically relevant deterioration in clinical finding is considered 
an AE and must be recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. 
Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
se
verity, and relationship to IP, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by [CONTACT_72078].  
Oc

9.1.1 Severity 
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an 
AE as determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The 
a
ssessment of severity is made irrespective of relationship to IP or seriousness of the 
e
vent and should be evaluated according to the following scale:

  Mild : Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not 
int
erfere with the subject’s daily activities. 
 Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
int
erfere with the subject’s daily activities. 
 Severe : Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of 
ther
apy, and interferes with the subject’s daily activities. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_957071] 
The relationship of each AE to the IP should be determined by [CONTACT_704411]: 
 Suspected:  A reasonable possibility exists that the IP caused the AE. A suspected 
AE c
an be further defined as: 
 Definite : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence from 
the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the drug 
class, is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_590197]. 
 Probable : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence 
from the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the 
drug class, is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_590198]. 
 Possib le: Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence 
from the time of IP administration, but could also have been produced by [CONTACT_1560]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_339413]. 
 Not Suspected: A reasonable possibility does not exist that the IP caused the AE. 
 N
ot Related:  Concurrent illness, concurrent medication, or other known cause 
is cle
arly responsible for the AE, the administration of the IP and the 
occurrence of the AE are not reasonably related in time, OR exposure to IP 
has not occurred.  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the IP caused the AE. “ Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the IP and the AE. Types of evidence that would suggest a 
causal relationship between the IP and the AE event include: a single occurrence of an 
event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with IP exposure (e.g., 
a
ngioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an 
event that is not commonly associated with IP exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in 
the population exposed to the IP (e.g., tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific 
e
vents observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease 
or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study

 population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more 
frequently in the IP-treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group. 
9.1.3 Expectedness 
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information 
about the IP using these explanations: 
 Unexpe
cted: An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
 Expected:  An AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
observed. 
 Not applicable: An AE unrelated to the IP. 
Adverse events that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of products or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological/mechanical (or other) properties of the product, but 
are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product under 
investigation are to be considered unexpected. 
The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final 
classification is subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination. 
 Serious Adverse Events 9.2
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results 
in an
y of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening AE; 
Note: An AE  is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investi
gator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. 
It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
c
aused death. 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
Note: The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission (even if 
less than 24 hours). For chronic or long-term inpatients, inpatient admission 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit. 
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80676]: emergency room visits; outpatient/same-
day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities;

  A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
Note: A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would be 
int
erpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g.,

Each kit will contain the [ADDRESS_957087] of five single use 0.4mL vials packaged in an aluminum pouch.  Zaditor® will be 
in i
ts original bottle with the label removed.  A label containing the letter A, B, or C will 
be on the bottles of Zaditor® and the pouches of both EM-[ADDRESS_957088] be stored in a secure area accessible only to the investigator and his/her 
designees. Kits will be left unopened until the authorized unmasked technicians open the 
a
ssigned kit for administration to each randomized subject.  Following administration to 
the subject, the technicians will return the product to the kit and seal the kit with tamper 
evident tape.   
Investigational product must be stored at room temperature between 20-25°C (68-77°F). 
All i
nvestigational product will be returned to inventory after use. 
Upon receiving the shipment of IP, the investigator or his/her designee will select at 
ra
ndom the appropriate number of units to be designated as the retain samples. A label 
will be affixed to the designated units to identify these as “retain samples.” These retain 
samples will not be assigned to study subjects for clinical use. All of the retain samples 
will be stored in a secure area accessible only to the investigator and his/her designees. 
The retain samples will be segregated from the investigational product to be assigned to 
study subjects for clinical use, but will be stored in the same area and under the same 
conditions for the duration of the study.   
 
11.5.[ADDRESS_957089] 
The IP is to only be prescribed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her named sub-
investigator(s), and is to only be used in accordance with this protocol. The IP must only 
be
 administered to subjects properly qualified under this protocol to receive IP.  
The
 investigator must keep an accurate accounting of the IP received from the supplier. 
This includes the amount of IP returned or disposed upon the completion of the study. A 
detailed inventory must be completed for the IP.  Note only the kit number and number of 
kit
s will be tallied.  The kits will remain sealed prior to and following Visit 3. There will 
be no counting of individual IP inside the kit.   
 
The investigator must also keep an accurate accounting of the retain samples and must 
properly document the inventory.

The investigator is responsible for ensuring that study data is completely and accurately 
recorded on each subject’s e CRF , sourc e document, and all study-related material. All 
study data should also be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, and original. Recorded 
datum should only be corrected in a manner that does not obliterate, destroy, or render 
illegible the previous entry (e.g., by [CONTACT_740] a single line through the incorrect entry and 
writing the revision next to the corrected data). An individual who has corrected a data

Protocol Number:  17-100-[ADDRESS_957099]:  EM-100 topi[INVESTIGATOR_704380]:  3 
Primary Objective(s):  To demonstrate the non -inferiority of EM-100 to Zaditor® 
in the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic 
conjunctivitis.  
Secondary Objective(s):   To demonst rate that EM-100 is superior to vehicle in 
the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic 
conjunctivitis.  
 To demonstrate that Zaditor® is superior to vehicle in 
the treatment  of ocular itching as sociated with allergic 
conjunctivitis.  
 To demonstrate that EM-100 is non -inferior to 
Zaditor® in the treatment of conjunctival redness  
associated with allergic conjunctivitis.    
Overall Study Design:  
Structure:  Screening Period:  At the Screening Visit, subjects will 
sign the informed consent form and an allergic skin test 
will be performed, if required. At Visit 1, each qualifying 
subject will undergo a bilateral conjunctival allergen 
challenge (CAC) titration using an allergen t hey had a 
positive reaction to on their skin test. Subjects who elicit a 
positive reaction post -CAC will undergo the confirmation 
CAC at Visit 2 using the same allergen they qualified with 
at Visit 1.  
Treatment Period:  At Visit 3 , qualifying subjects will  be 
enrolled and randomized to receive EM-100, Zaditor®, or 
vehicle of EM-100 in the right eye and one of the other

 two treatments in the left eye . A trained study technician 
will instill one (1) drop of the assigned treatment in the 
right eye and  one (1) drop of  the assigned treatment in the 
left eye  (based on randomization) . Subjects will undergo 
CAC approximately [ADDRESS_957100] .  
Duration:  This study consists of four (4) office visits (Screening 
Visit, Visit 1, Visit 2, and Visit 3) over a period of 
approximately three  to five (3-5) weeks.  
Controls:   Vehicle of EM-100 topi[INVESTIGATOR_704381]  
 Zaditor ® (ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution  
0.035%, EQ 0.025% Base ), ANDA 077200 held by 
[CONTACT_704422].  
Dosage/  Instillation : At Visit 3, qualifying subjects will be enrolled and 
randomized to receive EM-100, Zaditor ®, or Vehicle in 
each eye. The treatment arms are listed below:  
 
 EM-100 in right  eye and Zaditor ® in left eye  
 Zaditor ® in right eye and EM-100 in left eye   
 EM-100 in right  eye and Vehicle in left eye  
 Vehicle in right eye and EM-100 in left eye     
 Zaditor ® in right eye and Vehicle in left eye  
 Vehicle in right eye and Zaditor ® in left eye  
 
A trained study technician will instill one (1) drop of the 
assigned treatment in the right eye  and one  (1) drop of  the 
assigned treatment in the left  eye approximately 15 (+1) 
minutes prior to CAC.   
 
The pre -specified technicians responsible for instilling the 
investigational product will not be involved with any other 
study procedures at the site.

Instillation/ Efficacy  CAC / Study Exit  
Measures Taken to Reduce 
Bias:  Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the 
assignment of subjects to investigational product, to 
increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject 
attributes (e.g. demographics and baseline characteristics) 
are evenly balanced across treatment gr oups, and to 
enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across 
treatment groups. Finally, masked treatment will be used 
to reduce potential of bias during data collection and 
evaluation of clinical endpoints.

population (1). Aller
gic reactions can vary from a mild, self-limiting condition to a 
debilitating condition that significantly impairs the quality of life. Allergic conjunctivitis 
is generally considered a type [ADDRESS_957117] cell degranulation and release of histamine, and a late 
pha
se involving various pro-inflammatory mediators (2). Histamine is the primary 
mediator responsible for the early phase reaction that triggers itching, vasodilation, and 
vascular leakage leading to ocular redness, chemosis, and blepharitis. The early phase 
response occurs within minutes to hours following allergen exposure. The itching 
associated with the early phase allergic reaction has been shown to peak at ~ 5-[ADDRESS_957118] cells also 
synthesize and release cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that initiate a cascade 
of inflammatory events leading to a late-phase reaction involving a variety of pro-
inflammatory mediators including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, cytokines, and 
interleukins and characterized by [CONTACT_704402], neutrophils, and subsequent 
lymphocytes and macrophages into the conjunctival tissues (3, 4).  
Ketotifen is a widely effective therapy for the management of ocular allergies. It has 
demonstrated rapid onset (≤ 15 minutes) and long duration of action (≥ 8 hours) after 
c
onjunctival allergen challenge (CAC)(5, 6). Ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution 
0.035% was found to be safe, well tolerated, and effective for the prevention of the signs 
a
nd symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis in multiple CAC studies(7-12). In an 
environmental setting, ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution 0.035% was found to 
sa
fely and effectively reduce seasonal allergic conjunctivitis signs and symptoms and 
prevent recurrence(13). 
Ke
totifen fumarate ophthalmic solution 0.035% (Zaditor®/ Zaditen®; [COMPANY_001] 
Ophthalmics) is approved in the [LOCATION_002] and Canada for the temporary prevention 
of ocular itching due to allergic conjunctivitis at a dose of one drop in the affected eye 
twice daily (every 8-12 hours)(14). In 2006, ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic drops 0.035% 
(ketotifen 0.025%; Alaway®; Bausch and Lomb, Inc., and Zaditor®; [COMPANY_001] 
Ophthalmics) were approved by [CONTACT_6581] (FDA) 
for over-the-counter use, with the indication of temporary relief of itchy eyes due to 
pollen, ragweed, grass, animal hair, and dander, at an approved dose of one drop in the 
affected eye twice daily (every 8-12 hours)(15). 
EM-100 contains ketotifen ophthalmic solution (0.025%) as a non-preserved formulation

DY OBJECTIVES 
Primary: 
 To demonstrate the non-inferiority of EM - 100 to Z aditor ® in the treatment of 
oc
ular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.  
Secondary: 
 To d emonstrate that EM-100 is superior to vehicle in the treatment of ocular 
itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. 
 To de monstrate that Zaditor ® is superior to vehicle in the treatment of ocular 
itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis 
 To demonstrate that EM-100 is non-inferior to Zaditor® in the treatment of 
conjunctival redness associated with allergic conjunctivitis.  
3 CLINICAL HYPOTHESES 
The clinical hypotheses are:  
 EM- [ADDRESS_957119] instillation.  
 EM- 100  is non-inferior to Zaditor® in the treatment of ocular itching associated 
with allergic conjunctivitis induced by [CONTACT_704403] [ADDRESS_957120]
illation. 
 Z aditor®  is more effective than vehicle in the treatment of ocular itching 
associated with allergic conjunctivitis induced by [CONTACT_704403] [ADDRESS_957121] instillation.

 Withdrawal Criteria (if applicable) 5.[ADDRESS_957128]’s safety has been 
compromised, the subject may be withdrawn from the study. 
Subjects may withdraw consent from the study at any time. 
Any female will be removed from the study should she become pregnant during the 
course of the study, and she will undergo a pregnancy test at her exit visit for 
confirmation. The pregnancy test must be confirmed by [CONTACT_1192] (2) additional tests and 
confirmed by [CONTACT_458] (or sub-investigator if the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_704383]). If the test result is positive a second and third time, the principal investigator 
(or sub-investigator if the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_704384]) will inform the subject. 
The Investigator will follow-up and document the outcome of the pregnancy and provide 
a copy of the documentation to the sponsor. The Ora Pregnancy Report Form will be used 
to report a pregnancy and follow-up. 
Re
ason for withdrawal will be included in the eCRF, and all efforts should be made to 
schedule the subject for an Exit Visit to complete exit procedures.  Any subject who is 
withdrawn for the study because of an AE will be followed until AE is resolved or as 
clinically required, and the investigator will prepare a written summary of the event and 
document the a
vailable follow-up information on the eCRF.   
Sponsor and/or Investigator may discontinue any subject for non-compliance or any valid 
medical reason (see Section 8.5).

6.1.3 Criteria for Effectiveness 
This therapeutic equivalen ce study is designed to evaluate the relative efficacy of EM -
100 topi[INVESTIGATOR_704385]® in the treatment of 
ocular
 itching at each designated time point post-CAC at Visit 3 (Day 1, 15-minute 
onset).  
Although thi
s study is being referred to as a “bioequivalence” or “therapeutic 
equivalence” study, it is in fact a non-inferiority study and all statistical testing will 
determine whether EM-100 is non-inferior to the reference drug, Zaditor®. Vehicle is 
inc
luded in this study in order to validate the assay.

7.1.2 Instructions for Use and Administration 
 This trial requires additional attention in order to preserve masking of study 
treatment. There will be a total of [ADDRESS_957129], 
Z
aditor®, will be in its original bottle. All individual kits will be sealed with 
tampe
r evident tape and the sites will be instructed to not open the kits upon 
receipt of shipment.  At no point during the trial (until database lock) will site staff 
or monitors be allowed to open the kits unless it is the designated “unmasked” 
technicians. The se technicians will ensure that opening of the kits is done in a 
manner to prevent the other staff and subjects from seeing the investigational 
product. For each subject treatment will be administered by [CONTACT_704405] a 
randomization list which will be sent to the site in a sealed envelope and opened at 
Visit [ADDRESS_957130] envelope will be filed in 
the investigator’s study file.      
 
 At Visi t 3, qualifying subjects will be enrolled and randomized to receive EM-
100, Zaditor® , or vehicle of EM-100. A randomization list will inform the 
tec
hnicians which corresponding letter treatment should be instilled in the right 
e
ye and which one should be instilled in the left eye.  
 
 A tra ined study technician will instill one (1) drop of the assigned treatment in the 
right eye and one (1) drop of the assigned treatment in the left eye approximately 
15(+1) minutes prior to CAC.

 8.1.5 Methods for Assignment to Treatment Groups: 
All subjects screened for the study who sign an ICF will be assigned a screening number 
that will be entered in the Screening and Enrollment Log. The screening number will 
consist of three (3) digits, starting with 001. Randomization will be used to avoid bias in 
the assignment of subjects to treatment, to increase the likelihood that known and 
unknown subject attributes (e.g., demographics and baseline characteristics) are evenly 
balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons.   
Once a subject meets qualification criteria at Visit 3  (Day 1), he/she will be enrolled and 
randomized to receive EM-100, Zaditor®, or the vehicle of EM- 100. A separate 
tre
atment will be assigned to each eye. Su bjec ts will be assigned the lowest four (4) digit 
randomization number available.  
 Concurrent Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  8.2
The use of any concurrent medication, prescription or over-the-counter, is to be recorded 
on the subjec
t’s source document and corresponding electronic case report form (eCRF) 
along with the reason the medication was taken. 
Concurrent enrollment in another investigational drug or medical device study is not 
permitted.

Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
se
verity, and relationship to IP, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by [CONTACT_72078].  
Oc
ular complaints should not be addressed as AEs unless the complaint is outside the 
normal limits for allergic conjunctivitis symptoms after allergen exposure or is associated 
with clinical sequelae (i.e., adverse slit lamp examination finding). 
9.1.1 Severity 
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an 
AE as determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The 
a
ssessment of severity is made irrespective of relationship to IP or seriousness of the 
e
vent and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
 Mild : Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not 
int
erfere with the subject’s daily activities. 
 Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
int
erfere with the subject’s daily activities. 
 Severe : Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of 
ther
apy, and interferes with the subject’s daily activities. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_957142] 
The relationship of each AE to the IP should be determined by [CONTACT_704411]: 
 Suspected:  A reasonable possibility exists that the IP caused the AE. A suspected 
AE c
an be further defined as: 
 Definite : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence from 
the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the drug 
class, is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_590197]. 
 Probable : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence

 Possib le: Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence 
from the time of IP administration, but could also have been produced by [CONTACT_1560]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_339413]. 
 Not Suspected: A reasonable possibility does not exist that the IP caused the AE. 
 N
ot Related:  Concurrent illness, concurrent medication, or other known cause 
is cle
arly responsible for the AE, the administration of the IP and the 
occurrence of the AE are not reasonably related in time, OR exposure to IP 
has not occurred.  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the IP caused the AE. “ Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between th e IP and the AE. Types of evidence that would suggest a 
causal relationship between the IP and the AE event include: a single occurrence of an 
event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with IP exposure (e.g., 
a
ngioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an 
event that is not commonly associated with IP exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in 
the population exposed to the IP (e.g., tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific 
e
vents observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease 
or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study 
population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more 
frequently in the IP-treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group. 
9.1.3 Expectedness 
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information 
about the IP using these explanations: 
 Unexpected: An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
 Expected:  An AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
observed. 
 Not applicable: An AE unrelated to the IP. 
Adverse events that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of products or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological/mechanical (or other) properties of the product, but 
are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product under 
investigation are to be considered unexpected. 
The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final 
classification is subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination.

  Serious Adverse Events 9.2
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results 
in an
y of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening AE; 
Note: An AE  is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investi
gator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. 
It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
c
aused death. 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
Note
: The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission (even if 
less than 24 hours). For chronic or long-term inpatients, inpatient admission 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit. 
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80676]: emergency room visits; outpatient/same-
day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or clinical research/phase 1 units. 
Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any extension of 
an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_704388]. 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
Note: A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would be 
int
erpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic nerve). 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

a
ssigned kit for administration to each randomized subject.  Following administration to 
the subject, the technicians will return the product to the kit and seal the kit with tamper 
evident tape.   
Investigational product must be stored at room temperature between 20-25°C (68-77°F). 
All i
nvestigational product will be returned to inventory after use. 
Upon r
eceiving the shipment of IP, the investigator or his/her designee will select at 
random the appropriate number of units to be designated as the retain samples. A label 
will be affixed to the designated units to identify these as “retain samples.” These retain 
samples will not be assigned to study subjects for clinical use. All of the retain samples 
will be stored in a secure area accessible only to the investigator and his/her designees. 
The retain samples will be segregated from the investigational product to be assigned to 
study subjects for clinical use, but will be stored in the same area and under the same 
conditions for the duration of the study.   
 
11.5.[ADDRESS_957164] 
The IP is to only be prescribed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her named sub-
investigator(s), and is to only be used in accordance with this protocol. The IP must only 
be
 administered to subjects properly qualified under this protocol to receive IP.  
The
 investigator must keep an accurate accounting of the IP received from the supplier. 
This includes the amount of IP returned or disposed upon the completion of the study. A 
detailed inventory must be completed for the IP.  Note only the kit number and number of 
kit
s will be tallied.  The kits will remain sealed prior to and following Visit 3. There will 
be no counting of individual IP inside the kit.   
 
The investigator must also keep an accurate accounting of the retain samples and must 
properly document the inventory.  
 
11.5.[ADDRESS_957165] 
All IP used in the clinical trial will be returned to the sponsor (or their designee) or 
de
stroyed a
t the study site. The return or disposal of IP will be specified in writing. All of 
the r
etain samples will be shipped to a third party vendor for long-term storage.   
 Recording of Data on Source Documents and Case Reports Forms 11.6

 SYNOPS IS 
Protocol Title:  A Single -Center Evaluation of the Relative Efficacy of 
EM-100 Compared to Zaditor ® (Ketotifen Fumarate 
Ophthalmic Solution 0.0 35%) and Vehicle in the 
Treatment  of Ocular Itching Associated with Allergic 
Conjunctivitis as Induced by [CONTACT_941] C onjunctival Allergen 
Challenge Model (Ora -CAC®)  
 
Protocol Number:  17-100-[ADDRESS_957174]:  EM-100 topi[INVESTIGATOR_704380]:  3 
Primary Objective(s):  To demonstrate the non -inferiority of EM-100 to Zaditor® 
in the treatment of  ocular itching associated with allergic 
conjunctivitis.  
Secondary Objective(s):   To demonst rate that EM-100 is superior to vehicle in 
the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic 
conjunctivitis.  
 To demonstrate that Zaditor® is superior to vehi cle in 
the treatment  of ocular itching associated with allergic 
conjunctivitis.  
 To demonstrate that EM-100 is non -inferior to 
Zaditor® in the treatment of conjunctival redness  
associated with allergic conjunctivitis.    
Overall Study Design:  
Structure:  Screening Period:  At the Screening Visit, subjects will 
sign the informed consent form and an allergic skin test 
will be performed, if required. At Visit 1, each qualifying 
subject will undergo a bilateral conjunctival allergen 
challenge (CAC) titration usi ng an allergen they had a 
positive reaction to on their skin test. Subjects who elicit a 
positive reaction post -CAC will undergo the confirmation 
CAC at Visit 2 using the same allergen they qualified with 
at Visit 1.  
Treatment Period:  At Visit 3 , qualifyi ng subjects will be 
enrolled and randomized to receive EM-100, Zaditor®, or 
vehicle of EM-100 in the right eye and one of the other

 two treatments in the left eye . A trained study technician 
will instill one (1) drop of the assigned treatment in the 
right eye and  one (1) drop of  the assigned treatment in the 
left eye  (based on randomization) . Subjects will undergo 
CAC approximately [ADDRESS_957175] .  
Duration:  This study consists of four (4) office visits (Screeni ng 
Visit, Visit 1, Visit 2, and Visit 3) over a period of 
approximately three  to five (3-5) weeks.  
Controls:   Vehicle of EM-100 topi[INVESTIGATOR_704381]  
 Zaditor ® (ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution  
0.035%, EQ 0.025% Base ), ANDA 077200 held by 
[CONTACT_704394].  
Dosage/  Instillation : At Visit 3, qualifying subjects will be enrolled and 
randomized to receive EM-100, Zaditor ®, or Vehicle in 
each eye. The treatment arms are listed below:  
 
 EM-100 in right  eye and Zaditor ® in left eye  
 Zaditor ® in right eye and EM-100 in left eye   
 EM-100 in right  eye and Vehicle in left eye  
 Vehicle in right eye and EM-100 in left eye     
 Zaditor ® in right eye and Vehicle in left eye  
 Vehicle in right eye and Zaditor ® in left eye  
 
A trained study technician will instill one (1) drop of the 
assigned treatment in the right eye  and one  (1) drop of  the 
assigned treatment in the left  eye approximately 15 (+1) 
minutes prior to CAC.   
 
The pre -specified technicians responsible for inst illing the 
investigational product will not be involved with any other 
study procedures at the site.

Visit 3  (Day 1):  Enrollment/ Randomization/ In-Office 
Instillation/ Efficacy  CAC / Study Exit  
Measures Taken to Reduce 
Bias:  Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the 
assignment of subjects to investigational product, to  
increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject 
attributes (e.g. demographics and baseline characteristics) 
are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to 
enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across 
treatment groups. Finally, masked  treatment will be used 
to reduce potential of bias during data collection and 
evaluation of clinical endpoints.

on (1). Allergic reactions can vary from a mild, self-limiting condition to a 
debilitating condition that significantly impairs the quality of life. Allergic conjunctivitis 
is generally considered a type [ADDRESS_957190] cell degranulation and release of histamine, and a late 
pha
se involving various pro-inflammatory mediators (2). Histamine is the primary 
mediator responsible for the early phase reaction that triggers itching, vasodilation, and 
vascular leakage leading to ocular redness, chemosis, and blepharitis. The early phase 
response occurs within minutes to hours following allergen exposure. The itching 
associated with the early phase allergic reaction has been shown to peak at ~ 5-[ADDRESS_957191] cells also 
synthesize and release cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that initiate a cascade 
of inflammatory events leading to a late-phase reaction involving a variety of pro-
inflammatory mediators including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, cytokines, and 
interleukins and characterized by [CONTACT_704402], neutrophils, and subsequent 
lymphocytes and macrophages into the conjunctival tissues (3, 4). 
Ketotifen is a widely effective therapy for the management of ocular allergies. It has 
demonstrated rapid onset (≤ 15 minutes) and long duration of action (≥ 8 hours) after 
c
onjunctival allergen challenge (CAC)(5, 6). Ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution 
0.035% was found to be safe, well tolerated, and effective for the prevention of the signs 
a
nd symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis in multiple CAC studies(7-12). In an 
environmental setting, ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution 0.035% was found to 
sa
fely and effectively reduce seasonal allergic conjunctivitis signs and symptoms and 
prevent recurrence(13). 
Ke
totifen fumarate ophthalmic solution 0.035% (Zaditor®/ Zaditen®; [COMPANY_001] 
Ophthalmics) is approved in the [LOCATION_002] and Canada for the temporary prevention 
of ocular itching due to allergic conjunctivitis at a dose of one drop in the affected eye 
twice daily (every 8-12 hours)(14). In 2006, ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic drops 0.035%

tre
atment of ocular itching following CAC (15 minutes following study medication 
instillation).  The vehicle is included for assay validation.   
2 STU
DY OBJECTIVES 
Primary: 
 To demonstrate the non-inferiority of EM - 100 to Z aditor ® in the treatment of 
oc
ular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.  
Secondary: 
 To d emonstrate that EM-100 is superior to vehicle in the treatment of ocular 
itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. 
 To de monstrate that Zaditor ® is superior to vehicle in the treatment of ocular 
itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis 
 To demonstrate that EM-100 is non-inferior to Zaditor® in the treatment of 
conjunctival redness associated with allergic conjunctivitis.  
3 CLINICAL HYPOTHESES 
The clinical hypotheses are:  
 EM- [ADDRESS_957192] instillation.  
 EM- 100  is non-inferior to Zaditor® in the treatment of ocular itching associated 
with allergic conjunctivitis induced by [CONTACT_704403] [ADDRESS_957193]

compromised, the subject may be withdrawn from the study. 
Subjects may withdraw consent from the study at any time. 
Any female will be removed from the study should she become pregnant during the 
course of the study, and she will undergo a pregnancy test at her exit visit for 
confirmation. The pregnancy test must be confirmed by [CONTACT_1192] (2) additional tests and 
confirmed by [CONTACT_458] (or sub-investigator if the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_704383]). If the test result is positive a second and third time, the principal investigator 
(or sub-investigator if the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_704384]) will inform the subject. 
The Investigator will follow-up and document the outcome of the pregnancy and provide 
a copy of the documentation to the sponsor. The Ora Pregnancy Report Form will be used 
to report a pregnancy and follow-up. 
Re
ason for withdrawal will be included in the eCRF, and all efforts should be made to 
schedule the subject for an Exit Visit to complete exit procedures.  Any subject who is 
withdrawn for the study because of an AE will be followed until AE is resolved or as 
clinically required, and the investigator will prepare a written summary of the event and 
document the available follow-up information on the eCRF.   
Sponsor and/or Investigator may discontinue any subject for non-compliance or any valid 
medical reason (see Section 8.5).

Z
aditor®, will be in its original bottle. All individual kits will be sealed with 
tampe
r evident tape and the sites will be instructed to not open the kits upon 
receipt of shipment.  At no point during the trial (until database lock) will site staff 
or monitors be allowed to open the kits unless it is the designated “unmasked” 
technicians. The se technicians will ensure that opening of the kits is done in a 
manner to prevent the other staff and subjects from seeing the investigational 
product. For each subject treatment will be administered by [CONTACT_704405] a 
randomization list which will be sent to the site in a sealed envelope and opened at 
Visit [ADDRESS_957203] envelope will be filed in 
the investigator’s study file.      
 
 At Visi t 3, qualifying subjects will be enrolled and randomized to receive EM-
100, Zaditor® , or vehicle of EM-100. A randomization list will inform the 
tec
hnicians which corresponding letter treatment should be instilled in the right 
e

 8.1.5 Methods for Assignment to Treatment Groups: 
All subjects screened for the study who sign an ICF will be assigned a screening number 
that will be entered in the Screening and Enrollment Log. The screening number will 
consist of three (3) digits, starting with 001. Randomization will be used to avoid bias in 
the assignment of subjects to treatment, to increase the likelihood that known and 
unknown subject attributes (e.g., demographics and baseline characteristics) are evenly 
ba
lanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons.   
Once a subject meets qualification criteria at Visit 3 (Day 1), he/she will be enrolled and 
ra
ndomized to receive EM-100, Zaditor®, or the vehicle of EM- 100. A separate 
tre
atment will be assigned to each eye. Su bjec ts will be assigned the lowest four (4) digit 
randomization number available.  
 Concurrent Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  8.2
The use of any concurrent medication, prescription or over-the-counter, is to be recorded 
on the subjec
t’s source document and corresponding electronic case report form (eCRF) 
along with the reason the medication was taken. 
Concurrent enrollment in another investigational drug or medical device study is not 
permitted. 
8.2.1 Prohibited Medications/Treatments

itching and/or redness as evaluated by a trained technician or the Investigator), doses 
may be skipped. If a positive CAC reaction is not elicited with the first allergen  
, other allergens to which the subject is 
sensitized may be used starting at the lowest dose.  
 Post-CAC Ocular Itching and Conjunctival Redness Assessments : Upon co mpletion 
of the initial titration CAC, subjects will receive an ocular examination by [CONTACT_704407]’s qualification. 
Subjec

re
ceiving that dose of allergen. Any subject who fails to test positively will be 
excluded from the study. 
 Note: The type and concentration of allergen used to elicit a positive reaction will be 
recorded for each qualifying subject.  At all subsequent visits, subjects will receive 
the same type of allergen (same lot number) and same concentration identified at this 
visit.

 from any use of the IP (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug or 
medical device) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an 
overdose. An AE can arise from any delivery, implantation, or use of a medical device, 
including medical device failure, subject characteristics that may impact medical device 
performance (e.g., anatomical limitations), and therapeutic parameters (e.g., energy 
applied, sizing, dose release, and anatomic fit) associated with medical device use. 
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question 
from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate 
pages of the eCRF. Any clinically relevant deterioration in clinical finding is considered 
an AE and must be recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. 
Documentation regarding the AE  should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
se
verity, and relationship to IP, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by [CONTACT_72078].  
Oc
ular complaints should not be addressed as AEs unless the complaint is outside the 
normal limits for allergic conjunctivitis symptoms after allergen exposure or is associated 
with clinical sequelae (i.e., adverse slit lamp examination finding). 
9.1.1 Severity 
Severity of an AE  is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an 
AE as determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The 
a
ssessment of severity is made irrespective of relationship to IP or seriousness of the 
e
vent and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
 Mild : Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not 
int
erfere with the subject’s daily activities. 
 Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and ma y 
int
erfere with the subject’s daily activities. 
 Severe : Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of 
ther
apy, and interferes with the subject’s daily activities. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_957214] 
The relationship of each AE to the IP should be determined by [CONTACT_704411]: 
 Suspected:  A reasonable possibility exists that the IP caused the AE. A suspected 
AE c
an be further defined as: 
 Definite : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence from 
the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the drug

 class, is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_590197]. 
 Probable : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence 
from the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the 
drug class, is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_590198]. 
 Possible : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence 
from the time of IP administration, but could also have been produced by [CONTACT_1560]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_339413]. 
 Not Suspected: A reasonable possibility does not exist that the IP caused the AE. 
 N
ot Related:  Concurrent illness, concurrent medication, or other known cause 
is cle
arly responsible for the AE, the administration of the IP and the 
occurrence of the AE are not reasonably related in time, OR exposure to IP 
has not occurred.  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the IP caused the AE. “ Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the IP and the AE. Types of evidence that would suggest a 
causal relationship between the IP and the AE event include: a single occurrence of an 
event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with IP exposure (e.g., 
a
ngioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an 
event that is not commonly associated with IP exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in 
the population exposed to the IP (e.g., tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific 
e
vents observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease 
or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study 
population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more 
frequently in the IP-treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group. 
9.1.3 Expectedness 
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information 
about the IP using these explanations: 
 Unexpe
cted: An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
 Expected:  An AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
observed. 
 Not applicable: An AE unrelated to the IP. 
Adverse events that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of products or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological/mechanical (or other) properties of the product, but 
are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product under 
investigation are to be considered unexpected.

 Serious Adverse Events 9.2
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results 
in an
y of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening AE; 
Note: An AE is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investi
gator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. 
It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
c
aused death. 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
Note: The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission (even if 
less than 24 hours). For chronic or long-term inpatients, inpatient admission 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit. 
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80676]: emergency room visits; outpatient/same-
day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or clinical research/phase 1 units. 
Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any extension of 
an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_704388]. 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
Note: A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would be 
int
erpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic nerve). 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life-threatening, o r 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

 Principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_167246], for events that do not end (i.e., metastasis), the 
c
ondition to be chronic. The event can be determined to be resolved or resolved 
with sequelae.  
The Investigator will follow unresolved adverse events to resolution until the subject is 
lost to follow-up or until the adverse event is otherwise explained. If the subject is lost to 
follow-up, the Investigator should make three (3) reasonable attempts to contact [CONTACT_640452], post, or certified mail. All follow-up will be documented in the 
subject’s source document. Non-serious adverse events identified on the last scheduled 
contact [CONTACT_704412].  
If the Investigator becomes aware of any new information regarding a Serious Adverse 
Event (i.e., resolution, change in condition, or new treatment), a new Serious Adverse 
Event/Unanticipated Report Form must be completed and faxed to Ora Inc. within 24 
hours. The original SAE form is not to be altered. The report should describe whether the 
event has resolved or continues and how the event was treated.

ssigned kit for administration to each randomized subject.  Following administration to 
the subject, the technicians will return the product to the kit and seal the kit with tamper 
evident tape.   
Investigational product must be stored at room temperature between 20-25°C (68-77°F). 
All i
nvestigational product will be returned to inventory after use. 
Upon receiving the shipment of IP, the investigator or his/her designee will select at 
random the appropriate number of units to be designated as the retain samples. A label 
will be affixed to the designated units to identify these as “retain samples.” These retain 
samples will not be assigned to study subjects for clinical use. All of the retain samples 
will be stored in a secure area accessible only to the investigator and his/her designees. 
The retain samples will be segregated from the investigational product to be assigned to 
study subjects for clinical use, but will be stored in the same area and under the same 
conditions for the duration of the study.   
 
11.5.[ADDRESS_957235] 
The IP is to only be prescribed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her named sub-
investigator(s), and is to only be used in accordance with this protocol. The IP must only 
be
 administered to subjects properly qualified under this protocol to receive IP.  
The
 investigator must keep an accurate accounting of the IP received from the supplier. 
This includes the amount of IP returned or disposed upon the completion of the study. A 
detailed inventory must be completed for the IP.  Note only the kit number and number of 
kit
s will be tallied.  The kits will remain sealed prior to and following Visit 3. There will 
be
 no counting of individual IP inside the kit.   
 
The investigator must also keep an accurate accounting of the retain samples and must 
properly document the inventory.  
 
11.5.[ADDRESS_957236] 
All IP used in the clinical trial will be returned to the sponsor (or their designee) or 
de
stroyed a
t the study site. The return or disposal of IP will be specified in writing. All of 
the r
etain samples will be shipped to a third party vendor for long-term storage.

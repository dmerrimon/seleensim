Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   1.0 Background  
 Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant disorder of the plasma cells, characterized by 
[CONTACT_868036] a plasma cell clone. The disease leads to progressive 
morbidity and eventual mortality by [CONTACT_868037] (with bone pain, pathological fractures, and hypercalcemia), anemia, renal 
failure, neurological complications and hyper viscosity syndrome.  
 
The majority of patients with MM produce a monoclonal protein, also call ed paraprotein, M -
protein or M -component, which is an immunoglobulin (Ig) or a fragment of one that has lost its 
function.(Kyle & Rajkumar, 2009; Palumbo et al., 2009, ) Normal immunoglobulin levels are compromised, leading to susceptibility of infections. The proliferating MM cells displace the normal bone marrow leading to dysfunction in normal hematopoietic tissue and destruc tion of the 
normal bone marrow architecture, which is reflected by [CONTACT_868038], paraprotein in serum or urine, and bone resorption seen as diffuse osteoporosis or lytic lesions 
shown in radiographs.(Kyle et al., 2003) Furthermore, hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency or 
failure, and neurological complications are frequently seen.(Palumbo & Anderson, 2011) A small 
minority of patients with MM are non -secretory.  
 
At the time of diagnosis, multiple myeloma is a heterogeneous disease, with a course that varies 
on the basis of both disease- and host- related factors (e.g., age, renal function, stage, 
chromosomal abnormalities). Multiple myeloma causes significant morbidity and mortality. It accounts for approximately 1% of all malignancies and 13% of hematologic cancers. 
Approximately 50,000 patients per year are diagnosed with multiple myeloma in the EU and US, and 30,000 patients per year die due to multiple myeloma. 
 
1.1 Treatment  
 
1.11 Treatment choices for MM vary with age, performance status, comorbidity, the aggressiveness of the disease, and related prognostic factors.( Dingli et al., 2017 ) 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_868029], nearly all patients have disease relapse and remain incurable. Furthermore, while several drugs and 
regimens are available for the treatment of MM, there are still que stions 
regarding how the various regimens need to be sequenced.(Dingli et al., 2017 ) 
This becomes even more important as more complex combination regimens are being used earlier on in the treatment, making it necessary to utlize the available 
agents optima lly for patients with relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM).  
 
1.12 Role of Monoclonal Antibodies in Multiple Myeloma 
So far two monoclonal antibodies are approved by [CONTACT_868039] – Daratumumab and Elotuzumab.( Dimopoulos et al, 2017; 
Palumbo et al., 2016; Lonial et al., 2016; Dimopoulos et al., 2016) Daratumumab 
is an immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1k) human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that 
binds to a unique CD38 epi[INVESTIGATOR_83825]38-expressing cells with high affinity. It 
was developed by [CONTACT_868040]38 protein. (Sanchez et al., 2016) CD38 is a 46- kDa type II 
transmembrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed on MM cells. (McEllistrim 
et al., 2017) CD38 has various mechanisms including ectoenzymatic activity, 
receptor -mediated regulation of cell adhesion and signal transduction.( Malavasi 
et al., 2006) Preclinical studies have shown that daratumumab i nduces MM cell 
death through several mechanisms, including complement -dependent 
MC1884 6   
Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody -dependent cell- mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), 
antibody- dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and FcR mediated -
crosslinking inducing apoptosis.(Sanchez et al., 2016) In a combined analysis of 
GEN501 and SIRIUS studies including 148 patients, the Overall Response Rate 
(ORR) was 31 %, and at a median follow -up of 14.8 months, the estimated 
Overa ll Survival (OS) was 19.9 months.(Usmani et al., 2015) These trials 
demonstrated that daratumumab is active as monotherapy in patients with heavily 
pre-treated and relapsed/refractory myeloma (RRMM) alongside maintaining its 
anti-myeloma activity in previously treatment refractory patients as evident by 
[CONTACT_3168] 33 and 29.7 % in GEN501and SIRIUS, respectively.(Usmani et al., 2015) 
Preclinical studies have shown that Daratumumab in combination with other 
agents enhances the antimyeloma activity and now there are reported multiple 
phase II /III trials to study the same. These include data from the CASTOR and 
POLLUX trials of the combination of daratumumab and dexamethasone with 
bortezomib and lenalidomide, respectively, showing enhanced efficacy of these 
regime ns in patients with early relapsed MM (2nd or 3rd line) and low minimal 
residual disease (MRD) states leading to the FDA approval of these regimens.  
Palumbo et al., 2016; Lonial et al., 2016; Dimopoulos et al., 2016)  
Elotuzumab is a first -in-class humanized immunoglobulin G1 
immunostimulatory monoclonal antibody targeted against signaling lymphocytic activation molecule F7 (SLAMF7, also called CS1 [cell -surface glycoprotein 
CD2 subset 1]), a glycoprotein expressed on myeloma and natural killer cells but 
not on normal tissues that enables selective killing of myeloma cells with 
minimal effects on healthy tissue. (His et al., 2008 ) The SLAM family is a 
subgroup of the immunoglobulin superfamily of receptors and consists of six members (SLAM, 2B4, Ly-9, NTB-A, CD94, and SLAMF7), all located on 
chromosome 1q23. (15) More than 95% of bone marrow myeloma cells express 
SLAMF7 in a manner that is independent of cytogenetic abnormalities.Hsi et al., 
2008; Tai et al, 2008) Elotuzumab exerts a dual effect by [CONTACT_868041] -dependent cell- mediated cytotoxicity 
through the CD16 pathwa y.(Collins et al., 2013) SLAMF7 mediates activating 
signals in natural killer cells by [CONTACT_868042] -2. In 
myeloma cells, SLAMF7 signaling is compromised owing in part to the lack of 
EAT -2 expression; therefore, elotuzumab does not induce the proliferation of 
myeloma cells. (Guo et al., 2015; Perez- Quintero et al., 2014) In a single -group, 
phase 2 trial of elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone, this immunostimulatory activity translated into an improvement in progression- free survival in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma and followed by [CONTACT_868043] 3 trials were done leading to the FDA approval of Elotuzumab with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in 
patients with RRMM. (Dimopoulos et al., 2017) 
 1.13 Rationale of Elotuzumab after Daratumumab Treatment in MM  
Daratumumab has emerged as a highly effective anti -MM agent as well as a 
partner to other already available anti-MM drugs including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). This has lead to utilization of 
daratumumab earlier in the treatment paradigm of MM patients. (Dingli et al., 
2017) On the other hand, there have been  some questions regarding the optimal 
positioning of Elouzumab, which  has a distinct mechanism of action than Daratumumab, and did not show any efficacy by [CONTACT_5071]. Furthermore, it was not 
MC1884 7   
Protocol Version Date: [ADDRESS_1211111] disease refractory to lenalidomide (full dose or maintenance dose). Thus, combining 
elotuzumab with another agent, pomalidomide in this case, and utilizing in 
patients who have had disease progression on daratumumab previously is a strategy that is warranted to understand how this FDA-approved agent will be 
optimally utilized as the therapeutic landscape of MM advances.  
 
1.14 Trial Design  
This will be a phase II, open label, prospe ctive clinical trial in MM patients with 
disease previously treated utilizing any daratumumab -based regimen and disease 
progression noted while on the daratumumab-based regimen or within 60 days of 
discontinuation of daratumumab (daratumumab refractory). S uch patients will be 
treated with a combination of elotuzumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone, as previously presented.( San Miguel et al., 2016) The efficacy of elotuzumab in 
previously daratumumab -treated patients will help determine its appropriate role 
in treatment of patients with RRMM.  
 
The dose schedule of Elotuzumab selected for the current trial is in accordance of several combination clinical trials that have been published with this agent since 
its FDA approval. Based on those trials, Elotuzumab i s dosed weekly for the first 
8 weeks and then is given as 20 mg/Kg dose every 4 weeks till disease 
progression or intolerable adverse events. (ref: Elo- pom-dex currently ongoing 
trial NCT# 02654132)

6.0 Registration 
6.1 Registration (Step 1) :  
6.11 Registering a patient  
To register a patient, access the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) web page 
and enter the registration/randomization application.  The registration/ 
randomization application is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Back up 
and/or system support contact [CONTACT_349650]. If unable 
to access the website, call the MCCC Registration Office at (507) 284 -2753 
between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Central Time (Monday through 
Friday). 
The instructions for the registration/randomization application are available on 
the MCCC web page ( http://ccswww/training/index.html ) and detail the 
process for completing and confirming patient registration. Prior to initiation of 
protocol treatment, this process must be completed in its entirety and an MCCC 
subject ID number must be available as noted in the instructions. It is the 
responsibility of the individual registering the patient to confirm the process has 
been successfully completed prior to release of the study agent. Patient registration via th e registration/randomization application can be confirmed in 
any of the following ways: 
• Contact [CONTACT_128743] ([PHONE_492]. If the patient was fully registered, the MCCC Registration Office staff can access the 
information from the centralized database and confirm the registration.  
• Refer to “Instructions for Remote Registration” in section 
“Finding/Displaying Information about A Registered Subject.” 
6.2 Verification  of materials  
Prior to accepting the registration, registration/randomization application will verify the following: 
• IRB approval at the registering institution 
• Patient eligibility  
• Existence of a signed consent form 
• Existence of a signed authorization for use and disclosure of protected health 
information  
6.[ADDRESS_1211123] be on file (no less than annually) at the Registration Office (fax: 
[PHONE_4859]). If the necessary documentation is not submitted in advance of attempting patient registration, the registration will not be accepted and the patient may not be 
enrolled in the protocol until the situation is resolved.  
When the study has been permanently closed to patient enrollment, submission of annual IRB approvals to the Registration Office is no longer necessary.

• Missed doses for pomalidomide are to be omitted rather than made up, unless the dose was forgotten and remembered on the same day, in which case the dose can be 
taken that da y. Any doses missed on a particular day are not to be made up the next 
day. Doses that are considered to be vomited are not to be made up and a mention about the time of dose and time of vomiting epi[INVESTIGATOR_868030].  
• Elotuzumab may be  administered within ±1 day of the scheduled dose if there are 
any logistical challenges (holiday, patient transport or other logistics, scheduling 
availability, etc.) 
• If multiple toxicities are experienced, dose modifications will be based on the toxicity requiring the largest dose reduction.  
MC1884 20   
Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   • Reductions are based on the dose given in the preceding cycle and are based on 
toxicities with an attribution of possible, probable, or definite that were observed 
since the prior toxicity evaluation. 
• Patients may continue on treatment with any two of the study drugs (elotuzumab or pomalidomide or dexamethasone) in case one of the agents has to be permanently discontinued. If a patient on treatment must discontinue two or all three drugs in the 
combination permanently, they should be removed from the protocol therapy and 
proceed to survival follow -up. 
• A dose omit/ delay of ≤28 days for any of the drugs is allowed. If a patient cannot be 
administered a dose of two or all three drugs in the study treatment for >28 days due 
to adverse events or any other reason, the patient should be removed from the study 
treatment and go to survival follow-up.

maximum of 28 consecutive days. Study medication should be discontinued 
permanently in the event of AE lasting more than 28 days.  
• If multiple adverse events are seen, administer dose based on the greatest reduction required by [CONTACT_868047].  
• Dose modifications are for adverse events attributed to study treatment only.  
Dose modifications are not required for adverse events if they are deemed 
unrelated and/or unlikely related to study treatment. 
• Reductions apply to treatment given in the preceding cycle and are based on advers e events observed since the prior dose.  
• Patients can continue pomalidomide and dexamethasone if elotuzumab is

• Any external beam radiotherapy. NOTE:  Radiation therapy administered with 
palliative intent to control localized symptoms from MM is permitted provided 
the symptoms are not considered due to disease progression.  
9.9 Concomitant medicat ions 
Any systemic anti -myeloma therapy or steroids other than those prescribed by [CONTACT_868048]. Guidelines for selection and use of 
other concomitant medications should be derived from the dexamethasone, elotuzumab, 
and pomalidomide prescribing information.  Other than study medications, administration 
of any therapeutic or diagnostic investigational agent (for any indication) is prohibited 
while on study.  
 
9.10  Guidelines for prevention of infusion reactions 
 
Pre-infusion Medications: On elotuzumab infusion days, subjects will receive the 
following medications 45 to 90 minutes prior to infusion in addition to dexamethasone 
outlined in section 7.0: 
 
- Acetaminophen 650-1000 mg orally - Diphenhydramine (or comparable H1 blocker) 25 to 50 mg orally or intravenously 
- Famotidine (or comparable H2 blocker) [ADDRESS_1211138] be available at the bedside.  
 
If a Grade 2 or higher infusion reaction occurs during elotuzumab  administration, 
interrupt the infusion and institute appropriate medical and supportive measures 
(antiemetics, antihistamines, analgesics, corticosteroids, leukotriene inhibitors, oxygen, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], bronchodilators, or other supportive measures as indicated). Upon resolution 
to Grade 1 or lower, restart at 0.5 mL per minute and gradually increase at a rate of 0.5 
mL per minute every 30 minutes as tolerated to the rate at which the infusion reaction occurred. Resume the escalation regimen if there is no recurrence of  the infusion reaction 
(see Table 7.13). 
 
In patients who experience an infusion reaction, monitor vital signs every 30 minutes for 2 hours after the end of the elotuzumab  infusio n. If the infusion reaction recurs, stop the 
elotuzumab  infusion and do not restart on that day .  
 
Infusion reactions after the completion of elotuzumab infusion: Should a Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_1211139] 
should be treated as clinically indicated with 1 or more of the following medications or interventions: diphenhydramine, acetaminophen, hydrocortisone, H2 inhibitor, 
leukotriene inhibitor, oxygen inhalation, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], bronchodilators, or other  supportive 
measures as indicated.  
 
MC1884 29   
Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   Elotuzumab infusions on subsequent weeks after a prior Grade ≥ 2 infusion reaction: 
Subjects with prior Grade [ADDRESS_1211140] future infusions 
started at 0.5 mL/min and then escalated in a stepwise fashion  (0.5 mL/minute every 30 
minutes , See section 7.13).  
10.0 Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring and Reporting  
The site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_169727]/all serious adverse events to the 
sponsor as described within the protocol, regardless of attribution to study agent or treatment 
procedure. 
The sponsor/sponsor-investigator is responsible for notifying FDA and all participating 
investigators in a written safety report of any of the following: 
• Any suspected adverse react ion that is both serious and unexpected.  
• Any findings from laboratory animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for 
human subjects, including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  
• Any findings from epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], pooled analysis of multiple studies, or 
clinical studies, whether or not conducted under an IND and whether or not conducted by 
[CONTACT_456], that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug  
• Any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over

a. Identify the grade and severity of the event using the CTCAE version 5.0. 
b. Determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2). 
c. Determine if the adverse event is related to the study intervention (agent, treatment or procedure) (see Sec tion 10.3). 
d. Determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report. If yes, determine the timeframe/mechanism (see Section 10.4).  
e. Determine if other reporting is required (see Section 10.5). 
f. Note: All AEs reported via expedited mechanisms mus t also be reported via the 
routine data reporting mechanisms defined by [CONTACT_760] (see Sections 10.6 and 
18.0). 
NOTE: A severe AE is NOT the same as a serious AE, which is defined in Section 10.4.  
10.2 Expected vs. Unexpected Events  
Expected events - are those described within the Section 15.0 of the protocol, the study 
specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), and/or the investigator brochure, (if 
an investigator brochure is not required, otherwise described in the general 
invest igational plan).  
Unexpected adverse events or suspected adverse reactions are those not listed in Section 
15.0 of the protocol, the study specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), or in the investigator brochure (or are not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed); if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with 
the risk information described in the general investigational plan. 
Unexpected  also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs but have not 
MC1884 31   
Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   been observed with the drug under investigation. 
An investigational agent/intervention might exacerbate the expected AEs associated with a 
commercial agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the commercial agent) occurs with a 
higher degree of severity or specificity, expedited reporting is required. 
NOTE: *The consent form may contain study specific information at the discretion of the 
Principal Investigator; it is possible that this information may NOT be included in the protocol or the investigator brochure. Refer to protocol or IB for reporting needs.  
10.3 Attribution to agent(s) or procedure  
When assessing whether an adverse event (AE) is related to  a medical agent(s) medical or 
procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized:  
Definite - The AE is clearly related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Probable - The AE is likely related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Possible - The AE may be related to  the agent(s)/procedure. 
Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
10.31 AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigational Agents and Commercial Agent(s) 
on the SAME  (Com bination) Arm  
NOTE:  When a commercial agent(s) is (are) used on the same treatment arm as 
the investigational agent/intervention (also, investigational drug, biologic, cellular product, or other investigational therapy under an IND), the entire 
combination (arm) is then considered an investigational intervention for 
reporting . 
• An AE that occurs on a combination study must be assessed in accordance with the guidelines for investigational  agents/interventions.  
• An AE that occurs prior to administration of the investigational agent/intervention 
must be assessed as specified in the protocol. In general, only Grade [ADDRESS_1211143] possible attribution to the commercial agent require an expedited report, unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59029]. Refer to Section 10.4 for 
specific AE reporting requirements or exceptions.  
An investigational agent/intervention might exacerbate the expected AEs associated 
with a commercial agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the commercial agent) 
occurs with a higher degree of severity or specificity, expedited reporting is 
required.  
• An increased incidence of an expected adverse event (AE) is based on the 
patients treated for this study at their site. A list of known/expected AEs is reported in the package insert or the literature, including AEs resulting from a 
drug overdose. 
• Commercial agent expedited reports must be submitted to the FDA via MedWatch 
3500A for Health Professionals (complete all three pages of the form).

10.32 EXPECTED Serious Adverse Events: Protocol Specific Exceptions to Expedited Reporting  
MC1884 32   
Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   For this protocol only, the following Adverse Events/Grades are expected to occur 
within this population and do not require Expedited Reporting. These events must still 
be reported via Routine Reporting (see Section 10.6).*  
*Report any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected 
adverse reaction (at your study site) over that which is listed in the protocol or investigator brochure as an expedited event.  
*Report an expected event that is greater in severity or specificity than expected 
as an expedited event.  
*Specific protocol exceptions to expedited reporting should be reported 
expeditiously by [CONTACT_231524].

10.5 Other Required Reporting 
10.51  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_15885])  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_15885]) in 
general, include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the 
following criteria:  
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol- related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable poss ibility that the 
incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_182821]); and 
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized. 
Some unanticipated problems involve social or economic harm instead of the 
physical or psychological harm associated with adverse events. In other cases, 
unanticipated problems place subjects or others at incre ased risk of harm, but no 
harm occurs.  
Note: If there is no language in the protocol indicating that pregnancy is not considered an adverse experience for this trial, and if the consent form does not 
indicate that subjects should not get pregnant/impregnate others, then any 
pregnancy in a subject/patient or a male patient’s partner (spontaneously 
reported) which occurs during the study or within 120 days of completing the study should be reported as a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]. 
Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Institutions:  
If the event meets the criteria for IRB submission as a Reportable 
Event/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845], provide the appropriate documentation and use the Mayo 
Clinic Cancer Center Expedited Event Report form

review and process the submission to the Mayo Clinic IRB and work with the 
IND Coordinator for submission to FDA.  
10.52 Death  
Note: A death on study requires both routine and expedited reporting regardless of causality, unless as noted below. Attribution to treatment or 
other cause must be provided.  
Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_1211149] dose, regardless of attribution to an agent/intervention under an IND requires expedited reporting within 24-
hours. 
Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, 
probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an IND  requires expedited 
reporting within 24- hours. 
Reportable categories of Deat h  
• Death attributable to a CTCAE term.  
• Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_31948] 28 days of life.  
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
• Sudden death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the 
onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be 
attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 
“Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” under the system organ class 
(SOC) of the same name. Evidence that the death was a manifestation of 
underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or 
progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) 
should be submitted.  
10.53 Secondary Malignancy  
• A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/interventi on, radiation 
or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of 
the initial neoplasm.  
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an IND will be reported. Three options are available to describe the event:  
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute Myeloctyic 
Leukemia [AML])  
o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
o Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
• Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) 
should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each 
protocol.  
10.54 Second Malignancy  
MC1884 36   
Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior maligna ncy (and is 
NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY 
routine reporting unless otherwise specified. 
10.[ADDRESS_1211150] (or female partner of a male subject) taking investigational 
product becomes pregnant, the subject taking should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female should be advised to call her healthcare provider 
immediately. The patient should have appropriate follow- up as deemed necessary 
by [CONTACT_140711]. If the baby [CONTACT_170727] a birth defect or anomaly, a second expedited report is required. 
Prior to obtaining private information about a pregnant woman and her infant, the 
investigator must obtain consent from the pregnant woman and the newborn 
infant’s parent or legal guardian before any data collection can occur. A consent 
form will need to be submitted to the IRB for these subjects if a pregnancy 
occurs. If informed consent is not obtained, no information may be collected. 
In cases of fet al death, miscarriage or abortion, the mother is the patient. In cases 
where the child/fetus experiences a serious adverse event other than fetal death, 
the child/fetus is the patient.  
NOTE: When submitting Mayo Expedited Adverse Event Report reports for 
“Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal loss”, the potential risk of exposure 
of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be documented in the “Description of Event” section. Include any available medical 
documentation. Include this form:

10.551 Pregnancy 
Pregnancy should be reported in an expedited manner as Grade 3 “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(pregnancy)” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions SOC. Pregnancy should be followed until the outcome is 
known. 
10.552 Fetal Death  
Fetal death is defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_260765]; failure of the product of conception to show evidence of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], heartbeat, or definite movement of a voluntary muscle after 
expulsion from the uterus, wit hout possibility of resuscitation.” 
Any fetal death should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(pregnancy loss)” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions SOC. 
10.553 Death Neonatal  
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by 
[CONTACT_52372] 28 days of life” that is felt by 
[CONTACT_128748]/intervention, should be reported expedi tiously.  
MC1884 37   
Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4

MC1884 39   
Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   11.0 Treatment Evaluation 
The International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria (Kumar et al, 
2016) will be used to assess response to therapy.  
11.1 Terms and definitions 
• M-protein: synonyms include M- spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], monoclonal protein and myeloma 
protein, paraprotein, M -component. 
 
Serum M -protein level is quantitated using densitometry on SPEP except in cases 
where the SPEP is felt to be unreliable.  
o M-proteins migrating in the β-region (usually IgA M-proteins) 
o Cases in which the M-protein is so large and narrow on agarose (some specimens >4 g/dL) that they underestimate the actual immunoglobulin level (by [CONTACT_7809] 1500 mg/dL) due to technical staining properties of 
the agarose gel.  
o Cases in which there are multiple peaks of same M-protein (aggregates or dimers)  
If SPEP is not available or felt to be unreliable (above exam ples) for routine M-
protein quantitation, then quantitative immunoglobulin levels derived from nephelometry or turbidometry can be accepted, with the exception that 
quantitative IgG may not be used.  However, this must be explicitly reported at 
baseline, and only nephelometry can be used for that patient to assess response. 
SPEP derived M -protein values and quantitative nephelometric immunoglobulin 
values cannot be used interchangeably.   
 
Urine M -protein measurement is estimated using 24-h UPEP only.  Random or 
24 h urine tests measuring kappa and lambda light chain levels are not reliable and are not recommended.  
FLC estimation  is currently carried out using the serum FLC assay (Freelite, 
The Binding Site Limited, [LOCATION_006]).  Patients with kappa/lambda FLC ratio <0.26 are 
defined as having monoclonal lambda FLC and those with ratios >1.65 as having 
a monoclonal kappa FLC.  The monoclonal light chain isotype is considered the 
involved FLC isotype, and the opposite light chain type as the uninvolved FLC 
type. 
 
• Response terms:  The following response terms will be used: stringent Complete 
Response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR), Minimal Response (MR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease 
(PD).  
 
In addition, for each response category, there will be an “unconfirmed” response category, which will be for internal use, for the purpose of guiding decision making 
and test ordering. These designations will be applied at the time of the first 
measurement  at which the quantitative aspect of the response category has been 
satisfied without the confirmation step having been satisfied. The designation “u” 
will precede the standard abbreviations, and will include usCR, uCR, uVGPR, uPR, 
uMR, uPD. 
 
• Measurable disease:  Patients who have a measurable serum or urine M-protein. 
MC1884 40   
Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   o Serum M -protein ≥1 g/dl  
NOTE:  Quantitative IgG may not be used for defining 
measurable disease  
o Urine M -protein ≥ 200 mg/24 h  
o Serum FLC assay: Involved FLC level ≥  10 mg/dl provided 
serum FLC ratio is abnormal  
 
The serum free light chain (FLC) assay is of particular use in monitoring response to therapy in patients who have oligo-secretory or non- secretory disease and should be 
used in assessing response only if the baseline serum and/or urine M proteins are not “measurable” as above, and the baseline level of the involved FLC is “measurable.”  When using this assay, it is important to note that the FLC levels 
vary considerably with changes in renal function and in patients with renal insufficiency, the levels of both the kappa and lambda may remain elevated, but the 
ratio normalizes with achievement of CR.  Thus, both the level of the involved and 
the uninvolved FLC isotype (i.e., the involved/uninvolved ratio or involved-
uninvolved difference) should be considered in assessing response.  Patients 
included on the study on the basis of FLC alone ( i.e., no measurable serum/urine 
M-protein) should be the only ones who are evaluated using FLC response criteria.  
The others should follow usual criteria and ignore FLC results with the exception 
of defining stringent complete response.  
 
• Evaluable disease : Patients who do not have a “measurable” serum M-protein, 
serum free light chain, or urine M-protein. 
 
• Oligosecretory myeloma:  Patient with multiple myeloma who has NEVER had 
“measurable” serum M-protein or urine M-protein, but has had a detectable M-protein in his/her serum and/or urine and/or measurable serum free light chain.  
 
• Non-secretory myeloma:  Patient with multiple myeloma who has NEVER had a 
detectable M -protein in his/her serum and/or urine.

1  SPEP, UPEP, Immunofixation studies of both serum and urine, and Bone marrow 
biopsy  are required to document CR regardless of registration values, and in addition 
FLC measurement and bone marrow immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_868033].   
2  For serum measurable patients, 24 hour urine does not need to be confirmed (i.e. 
repeated after documented response) for any response category  
3  At a minimum, a bone marrow biopsy should be repeated every 3 months until 
documented response.  Bone marrow biopsy results do not need to be repeated after documented response.  
4    If serum M -protein is being followed by [CONTACT_212269], quantitative immunoglobulins are required.  SPEP is 
only required to document CR or VGPR. 
11.3 Confirmed response 
In order to be classified as a hematologic response, confirmation of serum M- protein, 
serum immunoglobulin free light chain (when primary determinant of response) and 
urine M - protein (when primary determinant of response) results must be made by 
[CONTACT_99964]. 
• Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_868034], 
except for patients with evaluable disease only, where a bone marrow is required 
to document all response categories including progression. However, a second 
confirmatory bone marrow is not  required to confirm response in any case. 
• Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements; however, if radiographic studies were performed there should be no evidence of progressive or new bone lesions.  
 
Appropriate tests required to document and confirm response are listed in Table 11.[ADDRESS_1211155] IMWG

 Increase of 25% from lowest value in any of the following f, g: 
• Serum M -protein (absolute increase must be ≥ 0.5 g/dL) and/or 
• Urine M -protein (absolute increase must be ≥ 200 mg/24 hrs) 
and/or  
• If the only measurable disease is FLC, the difference between 
involved and uninvolved FLC levels (absolute increase must be >10 mg/dL)  and/or

Or any one or more of the following: 
• Development of new bone lesion or soft tissue plasmacytoma or ≥50% increase from nadir in the size (SPD) of  existing bone 
lesions or soft tissue plasmacytoma or ≥ 50% increase in the 
longest diameter of a previous lesion >1 cm in short axis 
j 
• 50% increase in circulating plasma cells (minimum of 200 cells 
per  L) if this is the only measure of disease  
a All response categories require two consecutive assessments (sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, 
MR, PD) made at any time before the institution of any new therapy.  sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, MR and SD categories require no known evidence of progressive or new bone 
lesions or extramedullary plasmacytomas if radiographic studies were performed. 
However, radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements.  
Bone marrow assessments need not be confirmed. Each category, except for stable 
disease, will have a working subcategory of “unconfirmed” [prefix ‘u”] to designate first 
time point at which response category MAY have been achieved if confirmed. The date 
of the initial test is considered as the date of response for evaluation of time dependent 
outcomes such as duration of response. 
 
b CR patient will need to progress at the same level as VGPR and PR patients to be 
considered a PD.  A positive immunofixation alone is not sufficient.

Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   c If more than one M protein spi[INVESTIGATOR_128716], 
then both need to be followed for response.  Otherwise, only follow the measurable M 
protein spi[INVESTIGATOR_128717].   
 
d In patients in whom the only measurable disease is by [CONTACT_128758]: CR in such 
patients indicates a normal FLC ratio of 0.26- 1.65 in addition to the CR criteria listed 
above.  
e Bone marrow criteria for PD are only to be used in patients without measurable disease 
by M protein and by [CONTACT_128759];  
 
f A "25% i ncrease" refers to M protein, FLC and bone marrow results and does not refer 
to bone lesions, soft tissue plasmacytoma or hypercalcemia.  The lowest value does not need to be a confirmed value.  If the lowest serum M- protein is ≥ 5 g/dL, an increase in 
serum M -protein of ≥ 1 g/dL is sufficient to define disease progression.  
 
g In the case where a value is felt to be a spurious result per physician discretion (for 
example, a possible lab error), that value will not be considered when determining the lowest v alue.  
 
h Progressive disease should be confirmed on two consecutive evaluations, where the 
timing of confirmation is per the treating physician and can be done immediately within the same cycle or on the next cycle.  However, treatment may be discontinued for 
progressive disease that is unconfirmed per physician discretion.  In this case, an 
objective status of PD should be entered on the measurement form and progressive 
disease should be reported on the event monitoring form.  
 
i Presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the k/l ratio. An abnormal k/l ratio by 
[CONTACT_128760] a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An 
abnormal ratio reflecting presence of an abnormal clone is k/l of 4:1 or 1:2.  
 
j Plasmacyt oma measurements should be taken from the CT portion of the PET/CT, or 
MRI scans, or dedicated CT scans where applicable. For patients with only skin involvement, skin lesions should be measured with a ruler. Measurement of tumor size 
will be determined by  [CONTACT_128761] (SPD).

15.21 Background : Elotuzuma b is an antineoplastic agent that is an antibody against 
the SLAMF7 antigen expression on cells including multiple myeloma. 
15.22 Formulation : Elotuzumab drug product is a 300 mg or 400 mg lyophilized 
powder in a single -dose vial for reconstitution. 
15.23 Preparation and storage : Once the dose is calculated (mg), determine the 
number of vials needed for the 10 mg/kg dosage based on patient weight. The 
volume of sterile water for injection (SWFI) needed for reconstitution should be 
calculated as follows:  
  
Reconstitution Instructions for EMPLICITI  
Strength  Amount of Sterile Water 
for Injection, USP 
Required for 
Reconstitution  Deliverable Volume of 
Reconstituted 
EMPLICITI in the 
Vial Postreconstitution 
Concentration  
300 mg vial  13 ml  12 ml*  25 mg/ml  
400 mg vial  17 ml  16 ml*  25 mg/ml  
*After reconstitution, each vial contains overfill to allow for withdrawal of 12 mL (300 mg) 
and 16 mL (400 mg), respectively.  
 Reconstitution: Aseptically reconstitute each EMPLICITI vial with a syringe of adequate size and a less than or equal to 18 -gauge needle (e.g., 17-gauge). A 
slight back pressure may be experienced during administration of the Sterile 
Water for Injection, U SP, which is considered normal. Hold the vial upright and 
swirl the solution by [CONTACT_868050]. Invert the vial a few times in order to dissolve any powder that may be present on top of the 
vial or the stopper. Avoid vigorous agitation. DO NOT SHAKE. The lyophilized powder should dissolve in less than [ADDRESS_1211159] the solution if any particulate matter or 
discoloration is observed.  
 
Dilution: Once the reconstitution is completed, withdraw the necessary volume 
for the calculated dose from each vial, up to a maximum of 16 mL from 400 mg vial and 12 mL from 300 mg vial. Further dilute with 230 mL of either 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, into an infusion 
bag made of polyvinyl chloride or polyolefin. The volume of 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP can be adjusted so as not 
to exceed 5 mL/kg of patient weight at any given dose of EMPLICITI. Complete 
the EMPLICITI infusion within 24 hours of reconstitution of the EMPLICITI lyophilized powder. If not used immediately, the infusion solution may be stored under refrigeration condit ions: 2°C to 8°C (36°F-46°F) and protected from light. 
15.24 Administration : Intravenous (IV) infusion 
MC1884 48   
Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   Administer the entire EMPLICITI infusion with an infusion set and a sterile, 
nonpyrogenic, low -protein-binding filter (with a pore size of 0.2 to 1.2 
micrometer) using an automated infusion pump. Initiate EMPLICITI infusion at 
a rate of 0.5 mL per minute. The infusion rate may be increased in a stepwise 
fashion as described in Table below if no infusion reactions develop. The 
maximum infusion rate should not exceed 5 mL per minute.

15.25 Pharmacokinetic Information : 
Elotuzumab exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics (PK), indicative of target 
mediated clearan ce. The administration of the recommended 10 mg/kg of 
Elotuzumab regimen with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone is predicted to result in geometric mean (CV%) steady -state trough concentrations of 194 
μg/mL (52%).  
 
The clearance of Elotuzumab decreased from a geometric mean (CV%) of 17.5 
(21.2%) to 5.8 (31%) mL/day/kg with an increase in dose from 0.5 (i.e., 0.05 times the recommended dosage) to 20 mg/kg (i.e., 2 times the recommended 
dosage). When Elotuzumab is administered with lenalidomide and dexamethason e, approximately 97% of the maximum steady-state concentration 
is predicted to be eliminated with a geometric mean (CV%) of 82.4 (48%) days. 
 
Clinically significant differences were not observed in the PK of Elotuzumab based on age (37 to 88 years) sex, ra ce, baseline lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, 
renal imapairment(creatinine clearance (CLcr) 15 to 89 mL/min), end -stage renal 
disease (CLcr <15mL/min) with or without hemodialysis, and mild heptic impairment(total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate 
transaminase (AST)>ULN OR total bilirubin [ADDRESS_1211160] 
any value) to severe (total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_1211161] any value) hepatic impairment is unknown. 
 
The clearance of Elotuzumab increased with increasing body weight  supporting a 
weight based dose. 
 
Half-life elimination ~97% of the maximum steady -state concentration is 
expected to be eliminated with a geometric mean (CV%) of 82.4 days.

were Grade 3 or lower. Grade 3 infusion reactions occurred in 1 % of 
patients. The most common symptoms of IRRs included fever, chills 
and hypertension. Bradycardia and hypotension also developed during 
infusions.  In the trial, 5% of patients required interruption of the administration 
of Elotuzumab for a median of 25 minutes due to infusion reactions, 
and 1% of patients discontinued due to
 infusion reactions. Of the 
patients who experienced an infusion reaction, 70% (23/33) had them during the first dose. Administer premedication consisting of dexamethasone,

15.3 Pomalidomide (Pomalyst®)  
15.31 Background : Pomalidomide is a novel drug in the class of immuno modulatory 
agents known as IMiDs compounds.  Pomalidomide binds to its molecular target cereblon (CRBN), a protein that is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which 
is responsible for the polyubiquitination of substrate proteins, targeting them for 
subcellular redistribution and destruction by [CONTACT_128767]. The pharmacologic 
properties of pomalidomide are of potential therapeutic benefit in the treatment of various hematologic neoplasms (such as multiple myeloma and 
myeloproliferative neoplasm- associa ted myelofibrosis), non -neoplastic 
hematologic disorders (such as β -thalassemia and sickle cell disease) and non -
MC1884 51   
Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   hematologic disorders such as systemic sclerosis, as well as solid tumor 
neoplasms. 
15.32 Formulation :  Pomalidomide capsules can be 0.5-mg gelatin capsules (size 4 
reddish brown), 1- mg hard gelatin capsules (size 4 reddish brown), 2 -mg (size 2 
reddish -brown), 3- mg and 4- mg hard gelatin capsules (size 2 reddish- brown), and 
5-mg hard gelatin capsules (size 1 reddish- brown), containing pomalidomide, 
mannitol, pregelatinized starch, and sodium stearyl fumarate.  
15.[ADDRESS_1211168] acebo capsules are supplied in high 
density polyethylene (HDPE) containers fitted with induction seals and child -
resistant plastic closures or PVC/PCTFE blister with push -through foil. 
15.33 
  Preparation and storage :  Store drug at controlled room temperature, 
between 68-77 ºF (20- 25ºC) or as indicated on the manufacturer’s label.  
The expi[INVESTIGATOR_128723].  
  Only enough drug for one month of therapy may be dispensed. 
15.34 Administration:  Pomalidomide is administered by [CONTACT_868051].   Pomalidomide should be taken 
without food (at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after a meal).  Capsules 
should be swallowed whole, and should not be broken, chewed or opened. 
If a dose of pomalidomide is missed, it  should be taken as soon as possible 
on the same day. If it is missed for the entire day, it should not be made up.  Patients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to 
another person and to return any unused capsules to the study doctor at the 
end of treatment.  Patients who take more than the prescribed dose of pomalidomide should be instructed to seek emergency medical care if 
needed and contact [CONTACT_58131]. 
15.35 Pharmacokinetic information :
  
a)  Absorption – oral absorptio n has been moderately rapid with first dose C max 
occurring in 1.5 to 4 hrs. More than 70% of the pomalidomide dose is absorbed 
in humans.  A high fat meal decreased the rate of absorption but had minimal 
effect on overall extent of absorption; therefore dr ug may be administered 
without regard to food intake. b)  Distribution – Apparent volume of distribution in healthy subjects ranged from 74-138 L across a dose range of 1 to 10 mg daily.  
Pomalidomide protein binding in human plasma is low to moderate 
(15.8% for R -enantiomer, 42.2% for S- enantiomer) and the binding is 
concentration independent in the concentration range of 30 and 1000 ng/mL.  Drug distributes into semen.  
c)  Metabolism – Eight metabolites were detected in plasma, each at 
exposures < 10% of the plasma pomalidomide.  CYP-dependent 
metabolites accounted for approximately 43% of the excreted 
radioactivity, while non-CYP dependent hydrolytic metabolites accounted 
for 25%, and excretion of unchanged pomalidomide accounted for 10%. d)  Excretion – In healthy patients, 72.8% of the dose was recovered in 
urine and 15.5% was recovered in feces. Less than 3% of the dose is 
excreted as unchanged pomalidomide in the urine.  The geometric mean 
MC1884 52   
Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2) of pomalidomide was appr oximately 7.5 
hours. 
Pomalidomide is metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_4852]. Following single dose 
administration, the AUC of pomalidomide increased 51%, 58%, and 72% in subjects with mild (Child -Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class 
B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment compared to 
subjects with normal liver function. Dose adjustment is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. 
For patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
classes A or B), the recommended startin g dose is 3 mg daily (25% dose 
reduction). For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh class 
C), the recommended dose is 2 mg (50% dose reduction) 
15.36 Potential Drug Interactions:  Pomalidomide is partially metabolized by [CONTACT_097]1A2 and CYP3A4/5.  Pomalidomide is also a substrate for P -
glycoprotein (P-gp). Coadministration of pomalidomide with the strong CYP3A4/5 and P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole, or the strong CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_1211169] on exposure to 
pomalidomide.  Coadministration of the strong CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine with pomalidomide increased mean exposure to 
pomalidomide by 125% compared to pomalidomide alone. If strong 
inhibitors of CYP1A2 are coadministered with pomalidomide, the 
pomalidomide dose by [CONTACT_128770] 50%.  
Smoking: Administration of pomalidomide in smokers, with smoking 
tobacco known to induce the CYP1A2 isoform, had no clinically relevant 
effect on exposure to pomalidomide relative to that exposure to 
pomalidomide observed in non- smokers.  
Dexamethasone: Co -administration of multiple doses of 4 mg 
pomalidomide with 20 mg to 40 mg dexamethasone (a weak inducer of 
CYP3A) to patients with multiple myeloma had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide compared with pomalidomide 
administered alone.

Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
16.1 Overview 
This is a phase II study of elotuzumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients 
with mul tiple myeloma refractory to daratumumab.  This study is designed to assess the 
overall response rate using a one stage phase II study design with an interim analysis. 
 
16.11 Primary Endpoint: The primary endpoint of this study is the overall response 
rate.  A response is defined as a PR,VGPR, CR, or sCR noted as the objective 
status on two consecutive evaluations.   All patients meeting the eligibility 
criteria, who have signed a consent form and have begun treatment will be 
evaluable for response, unless they are determined to be a major violation.  
 
16.12 Sample Size: The one stage study design with an interim analysis to be used is 
fully described below. A minimum of 17 and a maximum of 37 evaluable 
patients will be accrued total onto this phase II study unless undue toxicity is 
encountered. We anticipate accruing an additional 4 patients to account for 
ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation, or other reasons for a total 
of 41 patients overall. 
 
16.13 Accrual Rate and Study Duration:  The anticipated accrual rate is [ADDRESS_1211174] 3 years after registration.  
16.2 Statistical Design:  
  16.21 Decision Rule:  
The largest success proportion where the proposed treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this population is 20% (based on data from quad- and penta- refractory disease data in recent clinical trials), and the smallest success 
proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this patient population is 40%. The following one–s tage design with an interim 
analysis is based on a two -stage Simon optimum design (23) and requires [ADDRESS_1211175] 20%. 
   
16.211 Interim Analysis: Enter [ADDRESS_1211176] 4, we will 
continue accrual.  
16.212 Final Decision Rule:  Enter an additional [ADDRESS_1211177] 11, this will be considered evidence of promising activity and the treatment may be recommended for further testing in 
subsequent studies in this population. 
MC1884 56   
Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   16.213 Over Accrual: If more than the  target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_128724].  
16.214 NOTE:  We will not suspend accrual at the interim analysis to allow the first 17 patients to become evaluable, unless undue toxicity is observed. 
Given the limited overall sample size and the inclusion of an adverse events stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], we feel it is ethical to not halt accrual for the 
interim analysis. However, if accrual is extremely rapid, we may 
temporarily suspend accrual in order to obtain safety data on these 
patients before re- opening accrual to further patients.  
 
16.22 Power and Significance Level: Assuming that the number of successes is 
binomially distributed, the significance level is .09, i.e. there is a 9% chance of 
finding the drug to be effective when it truly is not.  The probability of declaring that this regimen warrants further study (i.e. statistical power) and the probability 
of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_480140] a function of the true success proportion as shown in the following 
table.  
  
If the true success proportion is...  0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 
Then the probability of declaring 
that the regimen warrants further 
study is…  0.09 0.28 0.54 0.76 0.90 
And the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_868035]…  0.55 0.35 0.20 0.10 0.05 
 16.23 Other considerations:  Adverse events, quality/duration of response, and patterns 
of treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific discoveries or 
changes in standard care will be taken into account in any decision to terminate the study.  
16.3 Analysis Plan  
The analysis for this trial will commence at planned time points (see 16.2) and at the time 
the patients have become evaluable for the primary endpoint. The Statistician and Study 
Chair will make the decision, in accord with CCS Standar d Operating Procedures, 
availability of data for secondary endpoints (e.g., laboratory correlates), and the level of data maturity. It is anticipated that the earliest date in which the results will be made available via manuscript, abstract, or presentation format is when all patients have been 
followed for at least [ADDRESS_1211178] discontinued study treatment prior to completing 6 
cycles.  
 
16.31 Primary Outcome Analysis: 
16.311 Definition: The primary endpoint of this trial is the overall response rate. A response is defined as a PR,VGPR, CR, or sCR noted as the objective 
status on two consecutive evaluations.   All patients meeting the 
eligibility crite ria who have signed a consent form and have begun 
treatment will be evaluable for response, unless they are determined to be 
a major violation.  
16.312 Estimation:  The proportion of successes will be estimated by [CONTACT_128771]. Ninety -
MC1884 57   
Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   five percent confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be 
calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner.(24) 
16.313 Over Accrual:  If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_128725]; however, they will be included in final point estimates and confidence intervals. 
   
16.[ADDRESS_1211179] binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true complete 
response rate will be calculated.

disease assessment prior to initiation of the subsequent treatment. The 
distribution of progression- free survival will be estimated using the 
method of Kaplan- Meier. (25) 
16.323 Survival time is defined as the time from registration to death due to any 
cause. The di stribution of survival time will be estimated using the 
method of Kaplan- Meier.  
16.324 Adverse Events: All eligible patients that have initiated treatment will be 
considered evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s).  The maximum 
grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, 
and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns.  
Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration.  
16.4 Data & Safety Monitoring 
16.41 Safety review  
The principal investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the study monthly to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB) is respons ible for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial 
at least biannually , based on reports provided by [CONTACT_31959]. 
16.42 Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_669071].  We note that the Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_128728] (1) the study re-opening to accrual or (2) at any time during 
the conduct of the trial and in consideration of newly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation.  The 
study team may choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse event profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below.  
 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe 
events considered at least possibly related to study treatment (i.e. an adverse 
MC1884 58   
Protocol Version Date: 1 3Jan2022   event with attribute specified as  “possible,” “probable,” or “definite”) that 
satisfy one of the following: 
o If [ADDRESS_1211181] been treated, 30% of all patients experience a grade [ADDRESS_1211182] possibly related to 
treatment.  
 We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or 
“unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence 
of a previo usly unrecognized treatment- related adverse event.  
  
16.[ADDRESS_1211183] been registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” 
website. The Primary and Secondary Endpoints along with other requir ed information for 
this study will be reported on www.ClinicalTrials.gov
. For purposes of timing of the 
Results Reporting, the initial estimated completion date for the Primary Endpoint of this 
study is 3 years  after the study opens to accrual. The definition of “Primary Endpoint 
Completion Date” (PECD) for this study is at the time all patients registered have either 
achieved a response (PR or better noted as the objective status on two consecutive 
evaluations) or have discontinued study treatment without achieving a response.

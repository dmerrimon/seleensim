 1. PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Phase 1, Randomized, Double -Blinded, Single -Dose Escalation Study 
Followed by a Multiple -Dose Escalation Study of SKL [ZIP_CODE]  in Healthy 
Subjects  
  
Clinical Phase  Phase 1  
  
Objectives  Part A  (single dose  administration ) 
Primary :  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single oral ascending 
doses of SKL [ZIP_CODE]  capsule (s) administered to healthy male 
subjects  
Secondary :  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of  SKL24741  (R-
enantiomer), SKL24742 (S -enantiomer)  (if appropriate) , and its 
possible  metabolites (if deemed necessary ) following 
administration of single oral ascending doses of SKL [ZIP_CODE]  
capsule (s) administered to healthy male subjects  
• To assess the food effect  on the PK of SKL [ZIP_CODE]  and SKL24742  
(if appropriate)  following administration of a single oral dose of 
SKL [ZIP_CODE]  capsule (s) administered to healthy male su bjects  
• To assess the gender effect on the PK of SKL24741  and SKL24742  
(if appropriate)  following administration of a single oral dose of 
SKL24741 capsule(s) administered to healthy female subjects  
 
Part B  (multiple dose  administration ) 
Primary :  
• To evaluate safety and tolerability of multiple oral ascending doses 
of SKL [ZIP_CODE]  capsule (s) administered for 14 days to healthy male 
subjects  
Secondary :  
• To evaluate the PK of SKL [ZIP_CODE] , SKL24742  (if appropriate) , and 
its possible  metabolites (if deemed necessary ) following 
administration of multiple oral ascending doses of SKL [ZIP_CODE]  
capsule (s) administered to healthy male  subjects  
  
Endpoints  Primary:   
• Safety and tolerability will be based on assessment of adverse 
events, clinically significant laboratory assessments, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_216965] (PEFR),  vital 
signs  (blood pressure, heart rate , body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] ,

 4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1. Background  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_24571] a neurological disorder that is characterized by [CONTACT_567626][INVESTIGATOR_567580], psychological and social 
consequences (Fisher et al., 2014 ).  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_567581] a transient behavioral change 
that might be objective signs or subjective symptoms (such as loss of awareness, stiffening, 
jerking, a sensation that rises from the abdomen to the chest, a smell of burnt rubber or déjà 
vu), caused by [CONTACT_567627] (Devinsky et 
al., 2018 ).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_567582].  Almost 10% of 
people will experience a seizure during their lifetime  (Hauser and Beghi, 2008 ).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_567583] 65 million people worldwide ( Ngugi et al., 2010 ).  About one -third of patients have 
refractory epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] ( i.e., seizures not controlled by [CONTACT_567628][INVESTIGATOR_567584]).  Approximately 75% of epi[INVESTIGATOR_567585], reflecting the 
heightened susceptibility of the developi[INVESTIGATOR_567586] ( Stafstrom and Carmant, 2015 ).  
Although the cause of epi[INVESTIGATOR_567587], seizures can be the result of 
almost any insult that distu rbs brain function.  These insults include acquired causes (for 
example, after stroke or traumatic  brain injury), infectious diseases (such as 
neurocysticercosis), autoimmune diseases , and genetic mutations.  To date, over [ADDRESS_745528] been identified (Devinsky et al.,  2018 ). 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_567588].  The latter is 
determined by [CONTACT_567629]  (EEG ) patterns observed when the seizure is 
occurring and by [CONTACT_567630].  Examples of seizure  types include 
absence seizures (previously known as petit mal), simple partial seizures (previously known 
as focal motor or aura), complex partial seizures (previously known as psychomotor or 
temporal lobe ) and  generalized tonic -clonic  seizures (also known as grand mal) (Meinardi et 
al., 1985 ).  
Once seizure types are identified, this information determines the epi[INVESTIGATOR_567589], age of  onset, and interictal EEG abnormalities.  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_567590] (no apparent structural injury, probable 
genetic cause) or symptomatic (structural brain abnormality of known or unknown cause).  
Further differentiation can be m ade on whether the seizures begin in a focal region (partial 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) or begin diffusely (generalized epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]).  Idiopathic generalized epi[INVESTIGATOR_567591]; absence, myoclonic, and generalized tonic -clonic seizures 
may also be seen.  In adults, symptomatic partial epi[INVESTIGATOR_567592], complex partial, or generalized tonic -clonic seizures (Commission on 
Classification and Terminology of the International League Against Epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], 1981).  
Although t he International League Against Epi[INVESTIGATOR_567593]

SKL24741 [(1 R)-2-(5-methyl -1,3,4 -oxadiazol -2-yl)-1-[3-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]phenyl]

 treatment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] . SKL24741 is intended for oral administration and is a potent inhibitor 
of voltage -gated sodium channels  (Nav) .  SKL24741 is a chiral compound with an R -
configuration; SKL24741 displays more potent efficacy in a refractory partial -onset seizure 
(rPOS) animal model and a broader safety margin in animal studies compared to  the 
(S)-enantiomer (SKL24742).  
The first -line treatment for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] i ncludes antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (AEDs)  of which over [ADDRESS_745529] been approved by [CONTACT_6581]  (US FDA) 
and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_567594], approximately one -third of patients fail to achieve seizure control (Devinsky et al., 
2018 ).  Therefore, the key unmet needs are: effective drugs for drug-resistant epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], 
improved tolerability of drug treatment, development of individualized treatments based on 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_207186], and disease -modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Based on the results for SKL24741 in 
in vitro  studies and animal models of rPOS  and oth er types of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], this compound has 
the potential to address these unmet needs.  
Further details regarding the SKL24741 studies are discussed in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
4.1.1.  Nonclinical Experience  
In vitro  and in vivo  nonclinical studies were conducted to investigate primary and safety 
pharmacology properties; absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) 
properties, pharmacokinetic drug interactions; and toxicology of SKL24741 according to the 
current regulatory guidance.  All definitive in vitro  safety pharmacology and pi[INVESTIGATOR_567595] ( GLP ) 
regulations.   As with many neurological compounds, SKL24741 has a steep dose response 
with respect to adverse central nervous system  (CNS ) clinical signs in rats and dogs 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pharmacology  
A range of in vitro  mechanism of action and in vivo  efficacy studies have  been conducted to 
characterize the primary pharmacodynamics of SKL24741.   In vitro  mechanism of action 
studies were conducted with SKL24741, including radioligand binding assays, functional 
assays , and ion channel patch clamp assays to evaluate the select ivity of SKL24741 and the 
potential for off -target effects.  An extensive series of in vitro  studies were conducted to 
evaluate the effects on synaptic ion channels , including sodium, calcium, and potassium ion 
channels, as well as its effects on gamma -aminobutyric acid  (GABA ), N-methyl -D-aspartate 
(NMDA ), and hyperpolarization -activated cAMP -regulated cation 1 (HCN1 ) currents.  
Functional assays evaluating the effects of SKL24741 on serotonin  5-hydroxytryptamine 
(5-HT) receptor subtypes  showed that SKL24741 significantly (i.e., ≥50%)  inhibited 5 -HT 2A, 
5-HT 2B, 5-HT 2C, and 5 -HT 1D with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 5.6, 
2.8, 66, and 81  μM, respectively.  In in vitro  electrophysiology assays with sodium channels, 
SKL [ZIP_CODE] exhibited state -dependent inhibition of the voltage -gated sodium channel  (Nav)  
1.6 current amplitude with an IC 50 value of 0.47  μM in the inactivated phase.  SKL24741 
also inhibited other subtypes of human voltage -gated sodium channel s (hNav) in a state -
dependent manner, including hNav1.1 (IC 50=1.7 μM), hNav1.2 (IC 50=0.7 μM), hNav1.3 
SK Life Sc ience, Inc.             IND No. 141225  
SKL24741                                                                  Protocol SKL24741C001 - Amendment 3.0  
46 
 (IC 50=1.1 μM), hNav1.7 (IC 50=0.59  μM), and Nav1.8 (IC 50=0.89  μM).  SKL24741 has a 
much higher affinity for the inactivated state rather than the resting state of Nav channels.  A 
higher affinity of SKL24741 for the inactivated state compare d to the tonic state of Nav 
channels would contribute towards a pr eferential selectivity target ing the pathological 
conditions of epi[INVESTIGATOR_567596] (Eijkelkamp et al., 2012 ).  In 
a kinetic study using human Nav1.6 channels, SKL247 41 (1  μM) significantly slowed the 
recovery time from fast inactivation of Nav1.[ADDRESS_745530] of Big Potassium ( BK) channels in stably expressed human embryonic 
kidney ( HEK ) cell line.  
In vivo  pharmacology studies have demonstrated the efficacy of SKL24741 in various rodent 
models of refractory partial -onset seizures  (rPOS ), generalized tonic -clonic seizures (GTCS), 
and generalized myoclonic seizures (GMS).  SKL24741 demonstrated efficacy in th ree 
mouse and one rat model s of rPOS.  SKL24741 produced a dose -dependent protective effect 
on electroshock -induced seizure s in mice following intraperitoneal ( IP) and oral 
administration.  Although less potent than SKL24741, (S)-enantiomer chiral compound  
(SKL24742 ) and the racemate compound (SKL24505 ) also protected against seizures 
induced by [ADDRESS_745531] on amygdala -
kindled seizures in male Wistar rats and significantly reduced both seizure score s and 
electroencephalographic ( EEG ) after-discharge durations  (ADD ).  In the pentylenetetrazol 
(PTZ)-induced kindling seizure test in mice, SKL24741 resulted in a significant  reduction in 
seizure score by 42 .9%.  In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] -induced spontaneous recurrent seizure (SRS) 
model, the maxim al protection rate for SKL24741 was 50% at the highest dose tested .  In a 
GTCS model using the maximal electroshock seizure (MES) test, SKL24741 produced a 
dose-dependent seizure  protection effect in both mice and rats . 
Finally, the efficacy of SKL24741 was further demonstrated in two GMS models in male 
mice.  These models w ere induced by [CONTACT_567631], a non -competitive GABA A 
receptor antagonist, or methyl 6,7 -dimethoxy -4-ethyl -β-carboline -3-carboxylate 
hydrochloride  (DMCM), which binds specific benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_567597] ; both are potent convuls ants.  In both models, SKL24741 had dose -dependent 
protective effect s.  Overall, SKL24741 displays a broad spectrum of efficacy in antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_567598].  The results of in vivo  efficacy studies suggest that, at doses devoid of 
behavioral toxicity, S KL24741 possesses a broad anticonvulsant spectrum in rat and mouse 
seizure models predictive of efficacy against generalized seizures, partial seizures and 
especially rPOS.  
When tested against 112 CNS targets in radioligand binding assay s and 34 CNS target s in 
functional assay s, SKL24741 (50  μM) showed no significant ( i.e., ≥50%) binding affinity for 
receptors and enzymes located in the CNS with the exception of human dopamine D4.2 (66% 
inhibition), rat peripheral benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_32538] (PBR ) (51% inhibiti on), human sigma 2 
(54% inhibition), human dopamine transporter ( hDAT ) (63% inhibition), and human 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_29906] ( hNET ) (63% inhibition).  In functional assays, SKL24741 
SK Life Sc ience, Inc.             IND No. 141225  
SKL24741                                                                  Protocol SKL24741C001 - Amendment 3.0

 showed  half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 5.6, 2.8, 65.5 and 81 μM for 4 
serotonin receptor subtypes ( 5-HT 2A, 5-HT 2B, 5-HT 2C, and 5 -HT 1D). 
In an in vitro  human ether -á-go-go related gene  (hERG ) assay in  HEK293 cells, SKL24741 
inhibited hERG potassium channel current s in a concentration -depend ent manner, with an 
IC50 of 21.1  µM.  Overall, this result indicates  low potency for the hERG channel as there 
was a substantial safety margin based on SKL24741 exposures at efficacious doses in rodent 
seizure models  (i.e., Cmax ≈ 2.5 3 μM; plasma protein b inding = 96.2 %).  Further evaluations 
using cardiac ion channels to determine cardiovascular risk showed that SKL24741 inhibited 
(concentration -dependent ) peak hNav1.5 (IC 50=20.2  μM) and late hNav1.5 (IC 50=4.91  μM) 
current s in HEK293 cells stably expressing hSCN5A and hCav1.2 current s (IC 50=17.2  μM) 
in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO )-K1 cells.  Cardiovascular effects were also evaluated in 
vivo in a GLP  study in telemetered male dogs ; after single oral dose s of SKL24741 , there 
were no unscheduled mortalities and no SKL24741 -related changes in any of the parameters  
evaluated with the exception of decrease d QTc interval s at ≥10 mg/kg from 0.[ADDRESS_745532]-dose (up to -9 msec [-4%]). 
SKL24741 -related neurotoxicity was evaluated in non -GLP studies in mice and rats using the 
rotarod test  after oral or IP administration .  Following single IP administration  of SKL24741 
in mice and rats, the peak toxicity time was 0.[ADDRESS_745533]-dose with a median neurotoxic 
dose (NTD 50) of 17.3 mg/kg .  Following single oral administration of SKL24741 in rats, the 
peak toxicity time was [ADDRESS_745534]-dose with an NTD 50 of 177 .5 mg/kg .  The effects of 
SKL24741 on locomotor activity (LMA) w ere evaluated in male rats.  There were no 
significant effects of SKL24741 on LMA up to a single oral administration of 100 mg/kg.  In 
a GLP study, the modified Irwin battery of assessments was used to evaluate the CNS effects 
of SKL24741 administered up to  40 mg/kg in male rats.  Foll owing oral administration, 
decreased extensor thrust and dilated pupi[INVESTIGATOR_567599] 
≥30 mg/kg, and moderate graspi[INVESTIGATOR_567600], moderate pi[INVESTIGATOR_2657], and lower body temperature 
(up to -1.0°C) were noted in rats administered with 40 mg/kg.  Based on these findings, the 
no observed  effect  level (NOEL) for neurological function  in this oral study  was 15  mg/kg.  
In a GLP study, the respi[INVESTIGATOR_567601]24741 were evaluated in male rats using head -
out plethysmography.  SKL24741 h ad no significant effect s on tidal volume . However, there 
was a decrease in respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] s up to 28 breaths /minute ( -22%) and a decrease in minute 
volume up to 62 mL/minute (-28%).   All doses had similar respi[INVESTIGATOR_229857], and no NOEL 
dose was observe d.  These observations are considered to be related to the pharmacological 
action of SKL24741, and the temporal response was consistent with the extended exposure  
profile of SKL24741 in rats.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pharmacoki netics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of SKL24741 have been studied both i n vitro  and in vivo.   
Toxicokinetic (TK) evaluations were performed as a part of oral repeat ed-dose toxicity 
studies in rats and dogs for up to 28 days.  SKL24741 is intended for oral administration, 
therefore its absorption PK propertie s were evaluated in an in vitro  permeability assay and 
following single oral and intravenous ( IV) dosing in male mice, rats, and dogs.  Plasma 
SK Life Sc ience, Inc.             IND No. [ADDRESS_745535] cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and P -glycoprotein 
(P-gp) inhibitors indicated that SKL24741 may be a substrate  of BCRP  and P -gp.  H owever, 
given the large passive permeability of SKL24741, it is unlikely that the in vivo  absorption of 
SKL24741 would be impacted by [CONTACT_567632].   
In single -dose bioavailability and PK studies in male mice, rats,  and dogs, SKL24741 was 
administered by [CONTACT_567633] .  The elimination kinetics of SKL24741 following a 
single IV bolus dose varied slightly across species.  The highest clearance (CL) and shortest 
half-life (t ½) were observed in mice, the lowes t CL was observed in dogs and the longest t ½ 
was observed in rats.  Across species tested in the nonclinical program (mice, rats, dogs), CL 
values were 3- to 4-fold lower than the calculated values of liver plasma flow (i.e., 3.0, 1.8, 
and 1.1 L/h r/kg, respectively)  (Davies and Morris, 1993 ), indicating that SKL24741 was 
cleared slowly from the body .  Vol ume of distribution was comparable in mice and dogs and 
both were less than that observed in rats ; Such  data also indicated SKL24741 distributed 
outside of the central compartment.  For fed and fasted rats given SKL24741 orally, the 
exposures were similar between the two feeding states. The relative bioavailability  (Frel) of 
SKL24741 after oral administration in mice, fed and fasted rats, and dogs was high 
(Frel82.9%).  Based on a single -dose radiolabeled PK study, male and female rats had 
similar exposures , indicating no sex differences  following  both IV and oral doses . 
TK parameters were evaluated in non -GLP and GLP oral toxicity studies of up to [ADDRESS_745536] -dose (AUC 24hr), were less than 
2-fold in both rats and dogs , indicating no gender difference s.  In both species, exposure 
tended to increase with increasing dose levels, but dose -proportionality va ried depending on 
species and dose level s.  No accumulation was observed in rats  and dogs  following 28 days 
of oral administratio n. 
SKL24741 was highly bound to plasma proteins across species (mouse: 98%, rat: 9 6%; 
rabbit: 96%; dog: 98%; monkey: 97%; and human: 96% ; all values are approximate means ).  
Blood -to-plasma concentration ratios were approximately 0.8 to 1.0 for all species and 
concentrations , indicating SKL24741 primarily partitioned into the plasma .  In a quantitative 
whole -body autoradiogra phy study with [14C]-SKL24741 in rats , [14C]-SKL24741 was 
widely distributed to most tissues .  Although tissue concentrations of radioactivity were still 
detectable in all tissues at [ADDRESS_745537] tissues at below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) by 
[ADDRESS_745538] -dose.  Tissue -to-blood exposure ratios in the cerebellum were 2.3 to 3.8 -fold 
indicating [14C]-SKL24741 partitioned int o the brain tissue regardless of sex or rat strain 
(same trend noted in other brain regions).  The concentration of radioactivity in pi[INVESTIGATOR_492697], specifically the uveal tract, had greater exposures than those observed for all other 
tissues, suggestin g an apparent  association of [14C]-SKL24741 with tissues containing 
melanin.

2B6, CYP2 C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 ( i.e., IC50 >100  μM for isozymes).  The IC 50 values 
CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 were 21.1  μM, 99  μM, and 58.7  μM, respectively.  
Excretion of SKL24741 was evaluated following single oral administration of 
[14C]-SKL24741 in rats.  The primary route of elimination of radioactivity was in the feces , 
with high levels being recovered in the bile of cannulated rats, sugge sting that hepatic 
clearance and biliary excretion play an important role in the elimination of [14C]-SKL24741.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Nonclinical safety  
Nonclinical toxicology studies have been conducted in Sprague -Dawley rats and Beagle dogs 
to support oral administration of SKL24741  in humans.  In vitro  metabolite profiling data 
supported the selection of rats and dogs as the rodent and non -rodent toxicology species.  All 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_567602] i n compliance with  GLP regulations (21 Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR ) 58).  All doses were given once daily via oral administration to support 
clinical dosing.  
In a non -GLP study in male and female rats, single administration of ≥120  mg/kg SKL24741 
resul ted in severe clinical signs of hypoactivity and ataxia with low body carriage and/or 
lateral recumbency  and led to the unscheduled euthanasia of the 120 and 200  mg/kg animals.  
Administration of 40 or 80  mg/kg SKL24741  resulted in animals that were ataxic  or had low 
body carriage , but fully recovered by [CONTACT_2006] 2.  Administration of 80 mg/kg also led to 
decreased body weight gain and food consumption .  As clinical signs and body weight 
effects for 80 mg/kg were generally tolerable, the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD) following 
single oral administration in rats was 80  mg/kg.   
In a non -GLP 7 -day repeat -dose toxicity and TK study, male and female  rats were 
administered dose s of 0, 20, 40, or 80  mg/kg/day  SKL24741 .  Due to severe clinical signs of 
hypoactivity and a taxia  with low body carriage and/or sternal or lateral recumbence , all 
animals (main and TK animals) dosed at 80  mg/kg/day were euthanized on Day [ADDRESS_745540] animals 
administered 40  mg/kg/day beginning on Day 5.  Treatment -related w eight loss and 
decreased food consumption were also observed at this dose level following the first few 
doses of SKL24741.  SKL24741 -related reduced reticulocytes and increased cholesterol were

 observed in all animals administered 40  mg/kg/day.  Based on t hese findings, the 7 -day MTD 
in rats was 40 mg/kg/day (Day  7 C max and AUC 24hr values of 7.40  µg/mL and 111  µg*h/mL, 
respectively, in males and 12.5  µg/mL and 269  µg*h/mL, respectively, in females).  
In a GLP 28 -day repeat -dose study toxicity and TK study, male and female  rats were 
administered 0, 15, 30, or 40 mg/kg/day  SKL24741.  No unscheduled mortalities were 
observed.  Clinical observations were dose -responsive and included transient ataxia and 
hypoactivity for both sexes administered  ≥30 mg/kg/day and l ow body carriage for animals 
administered 40  mg/kg/day.  Isolated incidences of hunched appearance and lateral 
recumbency were also observed at 40  mg/kg/day.  Clinical signs were considered adverse at 
40 mg/kg/day due to the nature and severity of the obse rvations.  Dose -dependent decrease in 
body weight, correlating with decreased food consumption, was observed at ≥30  mg/kg/day; 
however, these observations were not considered adverse due to their transient nature and 
reversibility.  Clinical chemistry chan ges included mild, reversible, higher cholesterol 
concentration in males and females administered ≥15  mg/kg/day and ≥30  mg/kg/day, 
respectively, which w ere not considered adverse.  SKL24741 -related increased liver weights 
were observed in males administere d ≥30  mg/kg/day and females administered ≥15 
mg/kg/day.  Microscopic liver findings of minimal centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy 
were observed in males and females administered ≥30  mg/kg/day.  These findings were 
consistent with potential microsomal enz yme induction in the liver, an adaptive response, and 
were considered non -adverse due to their minimal severity and partial recovery following the 
2-week recovery phase. Based on FDA recommendation, a NOAEL of 15  mg/kg/day was 
considered for calculating th e starting dose (mean combined sex C max values was 3.32 µg/mL 
and AUC 24hr 61.2 µg*h/mL ). 
In a non -GLP toxicity study, male and female dogs were administered a single dose of 20, 
60, 100, or 300 mg/kg SKL24741.  At doses ≥100  mg/kg, clinical signs of lateral (only 
300 mg/kg female) and sternal recumbency, ataxia, hypoactivity, emesis, and/or fo amy white 
vomitus, and excessive salivation were observed.  Decreased food consumption was noted in 
animals administered ≥60  mg/kg with full recovery before the next dosing occasion.   The 
MTD following single oral administration in dogs was 100  mg/kg.  
In a non-GLP 7 -day repeat -dose toxicity and TK study, male and female  dogs were 
administered 50/10, or 100/30  mg/kg/day  SKL24741.  Animals were initially administered 
50 or 100  mg/kg/day.  For the 100  mg/kg/day animals, the moribund condition of one male 
and o ne female on Day 3 resulted in the unscheduled euthanasia of these two animals.  
Together with clinical observations of body tremors, rigidity, decreased responsiveness, 
motor impairment, hypoactivity, ataxia, emesis and vomitus, and excessive salivation i n the 
other animals dosed at 50 and 100  mg/kg/day, all surviving 50 and 100  mg/kg/day animals 
had a 9 -day non -dosing period followed by [CONTACT_567634] 10  and 30  mg/kg/day, 
respectively.  Clinical signs at these reduced dose levels were limited to a single incidence of 
emesis and vomitus in one female administered 30  mg/kg/day.  SKL24741 -related excessive 
salivation was noted after dosing at ≥10 mg/kg/day.  SKL24741 -related changes in absolute 
and/or relative organ weights were noted in animals admi nistered ≥50/10  mg/kg/day, 
including the adrenals, epi[INVESTIGATOR_4046], heart, kidney, liver, ovaries, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], prostate, spleen, 
testes, thymus, thyroid, and uterus/cervix.  Based on these findings, the 7 -day MTD for

 SKL24741 in dogs was 30  mg/kg/day (Day 7 mean  combined sex C max and AUC 24hr values of 
3.20 µg/mL and 32.2  µg*h/mL, respectively).  
In a GLP 28 -day repeat -dose toxicity and TK study, male and female dogs were administered 
0, 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg/day  SKL24741.  Clinical observations included ataxia and/o r 
hypoactivity, emesis and/or vomitus, and excessive salivation in animals administered ≥10 
mg/kg/day; intermittent tremors in animals administered ≥20  mg/kg/day; decreased 
reactivity, retching, and clear oral discharge in animals administered 40  mg/kg/day ; and 
sternal recumbency on a single day in one animal administered 10 mg/kg/day.  Severity and 
frequency of clinical findings increased in a dose -proportional manner; however, the clinical 
observations were not severe enough to be considered adverse and s howed evidence of 
reversibility during the 2 -week recovery phase.  Based on FDA recommendation, a NOAEL 
of 10 mg/kg/day was considered for calculating the starting dose (mean combined sex C max 
values was 2.61 µg/mL and AUC 24hr 21.7 µg*h/mL).  
SKL24741 did not show any genotoxic potential in a GLP bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) 
assay or in a  GLP  in vitro  human lymphocyte micronucleus assay.  After oral administration 
up to 40  mg/kg SKL24741  to male Sprague -Dawley rats, there was no increase i n 
micronucleated polychromatic  erythrocytes.  Additionally, SKL24741  absorption data 
indicated that SKL24741 was not sufficiently photoreactive to result in direct phototoxicity  
in humans.   
4.1.2.  Clinical Experience  
SKL [ZIP_CODE]  has not been studied  in humans.  
4.2. Ratio nale for Present Study  
The rationale for developi[INVESTIGATOR_567603] [ZIP_CODE]  is based on the nonclinical evidence indicating that 
SKL [ZIP_CODE]  is a potent  inhibitor of  voltage -gated sodium channel s and a possible  activator of 
Big Potassium (BK) channels .  SKL24741 was shown to  have  a broad anticonvulsant 
spectrum in rat and mouse seizure models predictive of efficacy against epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], including 
generalized seizures, partial seizures and especially rPOS  (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
To date, nonclinical safety and pharmacokinetic findings indicate that SKL [ZIP_CODE]  has a  
favorable  safety profile ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) and dose -dependent drug exposure  
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
This single and mu ltiple ascending dose study is  designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
and PK of SKL [ADDRESS_745541] safety and 
assess  tolerability, safety, and PK of SKL [ZIP_CODE] .  In the single -dose escalation part of the 
study (Part A), tolerability, safety, and PK of SKL [ADDRESS_745542] on 
the disposition of SKL24741 , female subjects will be treated at one dose  level  under fasting  
condition . 
Figure  1: Schematic of study design  
 
The multiple dose portion of the study (Part  B) will evaluate the tolerability , safety, and PK 
of SKL [ZIP_CODE]  after 14 days of dosing in healthy male subjects.  Dose s, dosing regimen, and 
food status  (fasting  vs. fed)  used in Part B will be determined based on the outcome of 
Part A.  The selection of  the first dose level of SKL24741 in  Part B will be determined based 
on safety and PK information  from Part A.  
During Part A  and Part B , a sentinel dosing strategy  will be used (Section  7.2).  Safety 
reviews will be performed prior to  dose escalation from  one cohort to another (dose level 
increase) .  Dose escalation criteria and dose stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] (Section  7.3) will be applicable at 
any time.  
4.2.2.  Dosing Rationale  
As this study is the first -in-human  (FIH) study, the initial dose of SKL [ZIP_CODE]  has been 
conservatively selected according to the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
guidance document entitled “ Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical 
Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers ” (FDA Guidance for Industry, 2005 ). 
The dose levels planned for the Phase [ADDRESS_745543] level ( NOAEL ) 
doses of 15  mg/kg/day for rats and 10  mg/kg/day for dogs were used for the human starting 
dose calculations .  Based on the results of the  SKL24741 toxicol ogy studies, rats were 

SK Life Sc ience, Inc.             IND No. [ADDRESS_745544] sensitive species . On a body surface area ( BSA ) basis , human equivalent 
dose (HED ) in rats is 15 mg/kg/day ÷ 6.2 =  2.42 mg/kg/day; HED based on the NOAEL in 
dogs is 10 mg/kg/day ÷ 1.8 = 5.56 mg/kg/day .  By [CONTACT_2931]  a 10-fold safety factor to the 
HED of 2.42 mg/kg/day for rat  NOAEL, the maximum recommended starting dose ( MRSD ) 
for a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteer is 0.242  mg/kg (or 14.5 mg based on an 
assumed human weight of 60 kg [calculation = 2.42 mg/kg/day ÷ 10 (safety factor) × 60 kg]).  
Table  3 provides an overview of the NOAELs from the  28-day GLP  repeated -dose 
toxicology studies  and the  systemic exposure s at the NOAEL dos e levels .  The  HED, MRSD, 
and calculated  human starting dose  are also presented.

*NOAELs based on FDA recommendation   
Based on the se data  from the most sensitive species (rat) , the MRSD is approximately 14.5 
mg with a  10-fold safety factor applied  to the HED (HED ÷ 10).  However, a larger safety 
factor of approximately 15 was applied to the HED (HED ÷ 15) due to steep dose -toxicity 
profile in rats and dogs  (Section  4.1.1 ).  Therefore, the  starting dose of th is FIH clinic al study 
will be a single oral dose of [ADDRESS_745545] cohort of th e single ascending dose ( SAD ) study will receive a single dose at the 
Dose 1 level (i.e., 10 mg) and subsequent cohorts will receive doses up to 1000 mg (as a 
single dose) based on the prediction from allometric scaling and in silico assessment.  
However, dose levels of SKL24741 will be adjusted if needed based on plasma exposure, 
safety and tolerability observed at each dose level during the study . 
The single -dose escalation scheme (Part A) is designed to explore a range of doses up to the 
plasma exposure observed at the NOAEL  of 10 mg/kg/day  in dogs (Day 28 mean combined 
sex C max and AUC values of 2.61 µg/mL and 21.7 µg*hr/mL, respectively ; Table  3) if the 
safety and tolerability allow reachin g this plasma exposure.  A few additional single dose 
levels beyond the dog NOAEL exposures may be considered if the safety and tolerability 
warrant a higher dose of SKL2474 1.  However, the dose escalation increment will not exceed 
1.5-fold between each do se level due to the steep dose  response observed in toxicology 
species  (Section  4.1.1 ).  The institutional review board ( IRB) will be notified prior to 
initiating these additional cohorts.  In any case, the plasma exposure in humans will not

 exceed the exposure observed at the NOAEL  of 15 mg/kg/day  in rats ( Day 28 mean 
combined sex Cmax and AUC values of 3.32 µg/mL and 61.2 µg*h r/mL, respectively).  
After the first dos e level, if drug exposure in humans differ from what is expected from  
nonclinical studies, the dose -escalation scheme  may be re -evaluated .  The dose level selected 
to assess the preliminary food and gender effect s may also be re -evaluated .  Any changes to 
the dose escalation scheme will be reviewed and  approved by [CONTACT_567635].

cohort  in he althy female subjects .  It is expected that a total of 66 subjects ( 60 male  and 6 
female subjects ) will be enrolled in Part A .  Each subject will be given a single oral dose of 
study drug capsule (SKL [ZIP_CODE]  or placebo) on one occasion .  There will be 6 new subjects at 
each dose level (4  subjects randomized to SKL [ZIP_CODE]  and 2 to placebo)  during single -dose 
escalation .  Study drug will be administered under  fasting  condition , except for one cohort 
utilized for the food effect assessment  at one of the dose levels .   
To evaluate the magnitude of the food effect on the disposition of SKL24741, a cohort of 
subjects will receive a second dose of study drug under  fed condition (Period 2)  at an 
appropriate dose level based on PK results .  After completing Period 1 (fasting ) as part of 
single dose escalation , these subjects will return to the clinical research unit ( CRU ) for a 
second confinement to receive a second single dose (same dose level ) of study drug under

cohorts (i.e., between Period 1 and Period 2) .  As subjects complete the Follow -up visit of 
Period 1 and then return to the CRU for re -admission ( Day -1 of Period 2 ), the same  study 
procedures will apply again  (including Day -1 procedures)  in order to initiate Period [ADDRESS_745547] cohorts, a sentinel dosing strategy 
will be used  as described in Section 7.2. 
Part B  is a multiple -dose escalation study in 32 healthy male subjects .  Doses , dosing 
regimen , and food status ( fasting  vs. fed)  used in Part  B will be determined based on the 
outcome of Part A .  Dosing will extend over a 14-day period  at each dose level .  Four dose 
levels will be assessed, and s ubjects will be rand omized into one of the four dose levels .  
Each dosing co hort will have 8 new subje cts (6 subjects rando mized to SKL24741 and 2 to 
placebo ) dosed each day for 14 days (Table  4).  Daily dose level in Part B will not exceed the 
maximum dose level used in Part A.    
At each dose level, a sentinel dosing strategy  will be used as described in Section 7.2.

on the outcome of Part A . 
• A sentinel dosing strategy  (Section  7.2) will be used for all cohorts  in Part B.  
A cohort of female subjects will be added to Part A for the preliminary gender effect 
assessment  as shown in Table  4.  These female subjects will need to be of non -childbearing 
potential, have undergone a sterilization procedure  at least 6 months prior to dosing  with 
official documentation (e.g., hysteroscopic sterilization, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy ), or be postmenopausal with 
amenorrhea for at least 1 year prior  to dosing and follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) serum 
levels consistent with postmenopausal status as per Principal Investigator ’s judgment.  
7.2. Dosing strategy  
A sentinel dosing strategy  will be used in both Part A (SAD) and Part B  (MAD) , except for 
the foo d and gender effect cohorts .  The investigator and the Sponsor  will assess safety and 
tolerability data and determine whether it is acceptable to continue dosing (within cohorts) or 
to dose escalate  (between cohorts).   
Table  [ADDRESS_745549] 2 subjects (1 on 
SKL24741 and 1 on placebo) within each cohort  may be dosed at the same time .  
Randomization will ensure that one of these 2 subjects (sentinel subjects) receives placebo.  
If the doses are safe and tolerated, as determined by [CONTACT_5226] , dosing 
of the remaining subjects will occur after the observation period  as specified in Table  5.

Dose level   
(Part A and Part B)  Observation Period  and Safety Review  
First dose level  1) Two sentinel subjects (1 on SKL24741 and 1 on placebo)  
2) 14-day observation period after dosing the first subject with 
SKL24741  
3) The investigator and  the Sponsor review all available blinded safety 
data at the end of observation period . 
4) The remaining subjects dosed  within the cohort  
Second dose level and 
higher  1) Two sentinel subjects (1 on SKL24741 and 1 on placebo)  
2) 7-day observation period after dosing the first subject with SKL24741  
3) The investigator and the Sponsor review all available blinded safety 
data at the end of observation period.  
4) The remaining subjects dosed  within the cohort  
Dose escalation between the cohorts (dose increase ) will only proceed  if the safety and 
tolerability of the previous dose(s) are acceptable as judged by [CONTACT_340152] .  If available/needed, PK analysis results will also be considered .  The investigator 
and the Sponsor may adjust  the observation period based on the disposition of SKL24741 .   
The initiation and the final choice of the dose level for the food and gender effect cohorts 
(single dose administration) will not be performed until the PK and safety/tolerability are 
considered to be acceptable for the dose level provided under fasting condition and in healthy 
male subjects, respectively (Part A, single dose administration)  (Figure  1 and Section  7.1). 
The investigator  and the Sponsor  will take all precautions necessary for studies at an earl y 
stage in the development of a new chemical entity.  Dose escalation criteria and dose 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] (Section  7.3) will be applicable at any time.   
7.3. Dose Escalation Criteria  
The investigator and the Sponsor will review all available blinded safety (and applicable PK) 
data in a blinding fashion at the end of each dose group before deciding to escalate to the 
next dose level.  Dose escalation decision will be jointly made by [CONTACT_567636].  The dose level may be adjusted from the protocol planned dose, if deemed 
necessary.   
The investigator will stop dose escalation or recommend modification of the dose escalation 
if in his/her judgment, and in consultation wi th the Sponsor, such action is medically prudent 
to protect safety of the subjects.  
Study drug administration and dose escalation will be discontinued if, within a cohort, 2 or 
more subjects (for Part A) or 3 or more subjects (for Part B) experience a labo ratory

 9.10.1.  Blinding  
For each part (Part A and Part B) of the study, eligible subjects will be assigned to their 
randomization number linked to the dosing group by [CONTACT_567640].  During the conduct of the study, all study personnel will be blinded to subject treatment 
assignments except for the following individuals: the bioanalytical laboratory ( SK Life 
Science, Inc.  Toxicology group or designated contract research organ ization [CRO]),  the 
statistician preparing the randomization list (C RO), the dispensing pharmacist and the 
pharmacy QC/qualit y assurance (QA) personnel, as applicable .  If a subject is unblinded for 
safety -related regulatory reporting reasons  (Section 9.10.2 ), SK Life Science, Inc.  will 
become aware of the subject's treatment assignment.  
To maintain the blind ing, the study drug will be administered in an appropriate manner 
(amber container , for instance) .  The dispensing of the study drug will be carried out by [CONTACT_567641] a way that maintains blinding of the study .  The 
unblinded cli nical site personnel will not , otherwise , participate in the study and are not 
permitted to reveal any information to the study team, other study personnel  and subjects.   
A copy of the randomization assignment list will be made available to the pharmacist to 
allow the dispensing of the investigational product to take place.  This documentation will be 
kept in a secure location until the clinical database has been locked.   One set of sealed 
envelopes containing the randomization list will be available to t he Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_567606].  
9.10.2.  Unblinding  
At the initiation of the study, the study site will be instructed on the method for breaking the 
blind .  The method will be either a manual or electronic process.  
Unblinding of individual subjec t’s treatment by [CONTACT_567642]'s study treatment 
is nece ssary for clinical management .  In such cases, the investigator must first attempt to 
contac t the study Medical Monitor  (see relevant telephone contact [CONTACT_567643]  12.1.[ADDRESS_745571] information document),  to discuss the  need for unblinding .  
In situations in which the investigator has tried, but is unable to reach  the study Medical 
Monitor, he/she  shou ld use his/her  best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the 
clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding without having successfully reached and 
discussed the situation with the study Medical Monitor .  In this case, the investigator will 
notify the Sponsor  immediately after or as soon as possible.  
Once a subject's treatment assignment has been unblinded, the medical monitor and study 
coordinator should be notified within 24  hours of unblinding of the treatment .  Information 
relating to unbli nding (e.g., reason, date) shall be clearly recorded in the subject’s study file, 
as part of relevant standard operating procedures (SOPs) .  In addition, the investigator should 
consider whether the clinical event prompting unblinding should be considered a serious 
adverse event  (SAE), according to the regulatory definitions or criteria for SAEs, and if so, 
submit an SAE report to SK Life Science, Inc.  within 24 hours ( Section  12.1). 
SK Life Sc ience, Inc.             IND No. [ADDRESS_745572] and that potentially 
require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities .  In addition, SK Life Science, Inc.  may, 
for matters relating to safety concerns, unblind individual subjects at any time.  
After dosing each cohort , the safety and preliminary PK data will be provided to the Sponsor  
in a blinding fa shion.   If needed, preliminary  dataset of  drug concentration may be disclosed 
in an unblinding fashion to the Sponsor under restricted conditions  (e.g., data quality  
control ).   
9.11. Prior and Concomitant Medications

be followed:   
• The subject will be instructed to rest in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes 
before having an ECG performed,  
• The ECG will be performed prior to any other procedures that may affect heart 
rate (e.g., blood draws).  
The ECG data traces will be made for safety review by [CONTACT_567647] .  Any clinically signific ant ECG abnormalities at screening will 
exclude the subject’s participation in the study .  Thereafter, c linically significant abnormal 
findings will be reported as adverse events.  
To ensure safety of the subjects, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_567610] -1 (baseline) measurements .  If the QTc is increa sed by >60  msec from  
the Day 1 pre-dose value  or an absolute QTc value is >500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 
2 additional ECGs wil l be collected, approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart, t o con firm the 
original measurement .  If either of the QTc values from these repeated ECGs remain  above 
the threshold value (>60  msec  increase from the Day 1 pre-dose; or is >500 msec ), a single 
ECGs must be repeated at least hourly until QTc values from 2 successive ECGs fall below 
the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Extensive  Triplicate ECGs  
Extensive triplicate 12-lead EC Gs, except for the food effect  cohort, will be obtained to 
collect continuous [ADDRESS_745590] -dose at the specified 
time points  (Table  1 and Table  2).  Triplicate 10 -second, 12 -lead ECG recordings  (digital 
ECGs)  will be obtained  within a 5 -minute time window around the targeted time points 
outlined in the Schedule of Assessments described in Table  1 for Part A (single  dose 
administration ) and Table  2 for Part B (multiple  dose administration ).  During the extensive 
triplicate [ADDRESS_745591]-dose are guided by [CONTACT_567648].  The time points may be changed depending on PK 
informatio n obtained during the study from previous cohorts.  
10.6.5.  Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale   
The Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)  is a brief questionnaire that provides 
for the identification, quantification, and standardized assessment of the occurrences and 
severity of suicidal ideation and behavior .  The C -SSRS will be assessed only after multiple 
dose administration  (Part B).  The “Baseline (Lifetime/Recent)” version of the  C-SSRS  will 
be assessed at screening ( Appendix  C).  The C-SSRS  “Since Last Visit” version will be 
asses sed on other  study  days ( Appendix  D). 
10.6.6.  Peak Expi[INVESTIGATOR_567611]  (PEFR) Measurement  
Peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_216965] ( PEFR) will be measured within a 30 -minute time window around 
the targeted time points as outlined  in the Schedule of Assessments in  Table  1 for Part A 
(singl e dose administration ) and Table  2 for Part B (multiple  dose administration ).  The peak

 11.4. Statistical Analysis  
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses  of safety for this study .  
Statistical analysis details will be provided in the SAP for this study, which will be finalized 
prior to clinical database lock.  
11.4.1.  General Considerations  
The SK Life Science, Inc . Biometrics designated CRO will analyze the safety data derived 
from this study.  Only descriptive analyses will be performed; no statistical hypothesis testing 
will be done .  Continuous variables (e.g., age) and PK parameters will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_567650]  (e.g., number of subjects ( n), arithmetic mean, arithmetic 
standard deviation ( SD), standard error of the mean (SEM), coefficient of variation ( CV), 
geometric mean, geometric CV, median, first and third quartile s, minimum, and maximum) .  
If the measurements in the source (raw) data are integers, then the corresponding mean  and 
median will be presented to [ADDRESS_745596] and the SD to 2 decimal places; if the 
measurements are obtained to [ADDRESS_745597], then the mean and median will be presented 
to 2 decimal places and the SD to 3 decimal pla ces; and so forth .  Minimum and maximum 
will be displayed as reported in the source (raw) data .  Categorical variables (e.g. , presence 
of an adverse event) will be summarized  using counts and  percentages .  Percentages will be 
presented to [ADDRESS_745598] data l istings; listings will 
display all subjects who were randomized  and/or dosed with the study drug . 
11.4.2.  Background Characteristics  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Subject Disposition  
The number and percentage of subjects in each disposition category (e.g., randomi zed,  
completing treatment per iod, completing  the Follow -up visit, and discontinuing study with a 
breakdown of the reasons for discontinuation) will be summarized by [CONTACT_567651].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic, parameters  and baseline characteristics will  be summarized for the Safety 
Population .  Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_567652] . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Medical History  
Medical history encompassing abnormalities and surgeries reported before the Screening 
visit will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), 
version 19.0 or newer.  
SK Life Sc ience, Inc.             IND No. 141225  
SKL24741                                                                  Protocol SKL24741C001 - Amendment 3.0  
84 
 [IP_ADDRESS].  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications  will be coded using the World Health Organization -Drug Dictionary 
(WHO -DD) and summarized by [CONTACT_567653] 2  parts : 
• Prior medication:  medication received between the Screening visit and the dose of 
study drug in Part  A, and between the Screening visit and  the first dose of study drug 
in Part B, regardless of when dosing of the medication ended,  
• Concomitant medication: medication  received at or after the  dose of the study drug 
in Part  A or the  first dos e of study drug  in Part B.  
If the medication start date is on or after  the date of initial dosing of the study drug, then 
medication will be summarized as concomitant medication regardless of the medication end 
date.  If the medication end date is before  the date of initial dosing of the study drug, then 
medication will be summarized as prior medication regar dless of the medication start date .  
The prior and concomitant medication s will be summarized separately .  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Study Drug Exposure  
Exposure to study drug in Part B  (multiple dose administration ) will be defined as total 
number of days treated with study drug d uring the study, with total days calculated as last 
day of study drug minus first day of study drug plus 1  day.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Study Drug Compliance  
As the study drug will be administered under direct supervision  at the study site,  no analysis 
of compliance will be perf ormed.  
11.4.3.  Efficacy Analysis  
As efficacy is not being measured in this study, no efficacy analysis will be performed.  
11.4.4.  Safety Analysis  
The overall safety profile of SKL [ZIP_CODE] , relative to placebo, will be assessed in terms of the 
following safety endpoints:  
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events  
• Clinical  laboratory values (hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, urinalysis  
and chole sterol ) 
• ECG outcomes  
• Vital signs  
• Peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_216965] (PEFR)

 12. PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND 
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSI DERATIONS  
12.1. Adverse Event  
12.1.1.  Definition  
An adverse event (AE)  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
participating in a clinical investigation .  This AE  does not necessarily need to have  a causal 
relationship with the treatment .  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign ( e.g., a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, wheth er or not related to the 
investigational product.  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR)  is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study treatment caused the adverse event .  ‘Reasonable possibility’ means that there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE .  A 
suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse 
reaction, which means any AE caused by a study treatment.  
An AE may be:  
• A new illness,  
• Worsening of a concomitant illness or a baseline event,  
• An effect of the study treatment; it could be an abnormal laboratory value as well 
as a significant shift from baseline within normal range which the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_567616].  
Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs .  They are therapeutic measures for conditions 
that required surgery .  The condition for which the surgery is required is an AE, if it occurs 
or is detected during the t reatment period .  Planned surgical measures permitted by [CONTACT_449363](s) leading to these measures are not AEs, if the 
condition(s) was (were) known before the start of study treatment .  In the latter case, the 
condition sh ould be reported as medical history.  
A serious adverse event (SAE)  or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose:  
• Results in death,  
• Is life -threatening,  
• Requires nonscheduled (not routine or planned) subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] ≥ 24 
hours  or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] ≥ 24 hours,  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions),  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defec t, 
SK Life Sc ience, Inc.             IND No. 141225  
SKL24741                                                                  Protocol SKL24741C001 - Amendment 3.0  
89 
 • Is an important medical event  defined as an event that does not fit one of the other 
outcomes but may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes .  Examples include 
allergic br onchospasm (a serious problem with breathing) requiring treatment in 
an emergency room, serious blood dyscrasias (blood disorders), or 
seizure/convulsion that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .  The development of 
drug dependence or drug abuse would be ot her examples of important medical 
events.  
• All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for seriousness should be regarded as  
non-serious AEs  
• A pre -existing condition  is one that is present at the start of the study .  A pre -
existing condition should be recorded as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
• At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that 
meet the definition of an AE must also be recorded and doc umented as an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Severity  Assessment  
The investigator or the designated person will provide an assessment of the severity of each 
AE by [CONTACT_44745] a severity rating on the appropriate AE reporting page of the subject’s CRF .  
In classification of AEs, the t erm “severe” is not the same as “serious” .  Severity is a 
description of the intensity of a specific event .  The term “serious” relates to a subject/event 
outcome or action criteria, usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life 
or functioning.  
All adverse events will be graded according to the severity scale below .  General descriptions 
of each severity grade may be found in Table  11. 
Table  11: General Descriptions of Severity Scale 
Severity Scale  General Description s 
Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated; The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with 
daily activities.  
Moderate  Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; The AE interferes with 
daily activities, but the subject is still able to function.  
Severe  Not immediately life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24599]; disabling; The AE is incapacitating and requires 
medical intervention.  
Every effort will be made to obtain an adequate evaluation of the severity.

 [IP_ADDRESS].  Causality Assessment  
An asse ssment should be made of the causal relationship  of the adverse event to the study 
treatment, i.e., according to the following definitions  in Table 12. 
Table 12: Definitions of Causality Assessment  
Causality 
Assessment  Definitions  
Unrelated  The event is occurring before dosing  
The event is definitely produced  by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_49895] a reasonable (poor) temporal relationship with drug 
treatment  
And/or the event is readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or b y other 
modes of therapy administered to subject  
Possible  Reasonable temporal relationship with drug treatment  
But the event could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_49897], abates upon discontinuation 
of drug  
And/or event cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_78456]’s clinical state.  
Definite  Distinct temporal relationship with drug treatment , abates upon discontinuation of 
drug (de -challenge) and is confirmed by [CONTACT_49898] (re -challenge)  
Adverse events must be followed until resolution by [CONTACT_079] .  Resolution is 
defined as the return to baseline status or stabilization of the condition with the expectation 
that it will remain chronic .  Adverse events that are not serious and are ongoing at the 
subject’s last visit will be followed for a maximum of [ADDRESS_745600], observed by  [CONTACT_49885] (events , such as abnormal, 
clinically significant findings from phys ical examinations, ECG tracings, laboratory 
assessments, and vital sign measurements), or elicited by [CONTACT_567661]’s source document and reported as an adverse event and captured 
in the adverse events CRF .  If nec essary, every effort will be made to obtain an adequate 
SK Life Sc ience, Inc.             IND No. [ADDRESS_745601] choose to withdraw early from the study, they 
will be advised of the safety precautions to be taken.  
Early Termination and End of Study ( EOS) visit asses sments should be performed , including 
the following: medical history, vital signs, physical exam, safety and clinical laboratory tests, 
ECG, peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_216965] (PEFR), Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS), 
and adverse event/concomitant mo nitoring.  
Subjects will be questioned on their health status at the beginning of each visit and before 
their departure from the clinical site .  Open -ended questions will be asked.  
Classification will be performed by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and Preferred T erm (PT) 
using the  latest version of  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  at the 
start of the study.  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., clinical sequelae or a cascade of 
events) should be identified by [CONTACT_262750] .  For example, if severe vomiting is 
known to result in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only vomiting as SAE or AE in the 
CRF .  However, medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are 
separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the CRF .   
12.1.3.  Serious Adverse Reporting  
The investigator or any other study center personnel’s knowledge will notify any SAEs 
including fatal or life -threatening to SK Life Science, Inc . (SKLSI) and their designee 
IQVIA  on an SAE report form , without regard to causality, within [ADDRESS_745602] .  Information not available at the time of the initial report  (e.g., an 
end date for the AE, laboratory values received after the report, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4798]) must be documented and an updated SAE report form should be forwarded to the 
Sponsor  and their designee IQVIA  within 24 hours of new/updated informa tion.  All follow -
up information must be reported as soon as the relevant information is available .  The 
notification of all SAE’s should be directed to the following Sponsor  representatives  
(Table  13 and Table  14).

Telephone  +1 (404) 509 -4293  
Fax +1 (201) 421 -3884  
At the time of the initial SAE report, the investigator should provide as much of the 
following information as possible:  
• Study identifier  
• Study site  
• Subject  number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  
• Current Status  
• Whether study drug was discontinued  
• The reason why the event is classified as serious  
• Investigator’s assessment of the association between the event and study drug  
The Sponsor  will be responsible for evaluating the events for expedited reporting, and for 
reporting them to the applicable regulatory agencies.  
If reports of any new and unexpec ted AEs become available to the Sponsor  during the 
clinical portion of this study (related or not to the present study), the Sponsor  has to advise 
the clinical site, through its Principal Investigator, of those events.   
12.1.4.  Laboratory Results as Adverse Events  
The determination of whether laboratory test results are clinically significant should be made 
by a physician or by a clinical study staff member (listed on Form FDA 1572) who is 
qualified to review  and assess laboratory tests .  This determination is impo rtant, as a 
clinically significant laboratory abnormality must be associated with an adverse event, either 
directly or indirectly as explained below.  
SK Life Sc ience, Inc.             IND No. [ADDRESS_745603] finding should be clinically 
significant  are as follows:  
Test result is associated with clinical signs or symptoms .  If the signs or symptoms are 
related to a diagnosis that has already been documented as an adverse event, the lab 
abnormality itself generally does not have to be reported as an a dditional adverse event (e.g., 
hyperglycemia with an adverse event of new -onset diabetes; if diabetes is documented as an 
adverse event, hyperglycemia does not need to be documented separately as it is a common 
finding as part of the diabetes diagnosis) . 
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention . 
Test result leads to a change in study drug dosing or to discontinuation from the study . 
Test result is considered by [CONTACT_567664] (i.e., any new  unfavorable 
sign/symptom, or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency during the 
study) .   
Laboratory abnormalities that are associated with a chronic, stable medical condition (e.g., 
slightly elevated ALT in a subject with hepatitis  C that is unchanged or decreased from 
baseline) do not have to be considered clinically significant, but this judgment is left to the 
investigator.  
Note that repeating a test to confirm an abnormal result, in the absence of any of the above, 
does not mean  that a lab m ust be clinically significant .  An abnormal result that is found to be 
in error is not clinically significant and should not be reported as an adverse event.  
12.2. Administrative Requirements  
12.2.1.  Ethical Considerations  
The study will be conducted in acc ordance with the current ICH -GCP Guidelines, which are 
consistent with the ethical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki, and according to

disclosure of informati on related to this research set forth in this protocol.   
12.2.5.  Subject Privacy  
To maintain subject con fidentiality, all e CRFs, study reports, and communications relating to 
the study will identify subject s by [CONTACT_776] .  As required by [CONTACT_139415], the investigator will allow SK Life Science, Inc . and/or its representative’s 
access to all pertinent medical records in order to allow for the verifi cation of data gathered 
in the e CRFs and for the review o f the data collection process .  The FDA  (or other regulatory 
authority) may also request access to all study records, including source documentation for 
inspection.  
As applicable, in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 
1996 (HIPAA) and associated privacy r egulations, a subject authorization to use personally 
identifiable health information may be required from each subject prior to research activities .  
This authorization document must clearly specify what parties will have access to a subject’s 
personal he alth information, for what purpose and for how long.  
12.2.6.  Record Retention  
The investigator will maintain all study records according to ICH -GCP and/or applicable 
local regulatory require ment(s), whichever is longest .  If the investigator withdraws from the 
responsibility of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_8090], custody must be transferred to a person willing to 
accept the responsibility and SK Life Science, Inc.  must be notified.

• decision to modify drug development plan  
• decision by [CONTACT_567666] l termination is required.  
12.3. Data Quality Assurance  
SK Life Science, Inc.  or its designated representative will conduct a study site visit to verify 
the qualifications of each investigator, inspect trial site facilities, and inform the investigator 
of respon sibilities and procedures for ensuring adequate and correct study documentation.  
The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each st udy 
participant .  Study data for each enrolled subject will be entered into an eCRF by [CONTACT_567667] a secure, validated web -based electronic data capture (EDC) application 
(Section 12.5).  
Study monitors will discuss instances of missing or uninterpretable data with the i nvestigator 
for resolution .  Any changes to study data will be  made to the eCRF and do cumented via a 
database query .  An audit trail for all changes will be maintained within the clinical database.  
Study monitors will discuss instances of missing or uninterpretable data with th e investigator 
for resolution .  Any changes to study data will be made to the eCRF and documented v ia an 
electronic audit trail associated with the affected eCRF.  
12.4. Monitoring  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or approved by [CONTACT_156221], Inc.  will be 
followed, in order to comply with GCP guidel ines.  On-site checking of the e CRFs for 
comple teness and clarity, cross -checking with source documents, and clarification of 
administrative matters will be performed.  
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_156221], Inc.  or its designee .  Monitoring will be 
done by [CONTACT_782] a representative  of the Sponsor  (site monitor) who will review 
the eCRFs and source documents .  The site monitor will ensure that the investigation is 
conducted according to protocol design and regulatory requirements.  
SK Life Sc ience, Inc.             IND No. [ADDRESS_745605].  It is the investigator’s responsibility to 
ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject’s 
eCRF .  Source documentation supporting the eCRF data should indicate the subject’s 
participation in the study  and should document the dates and details of study procedures, 
adverse events, other observations, and subject status.  
The investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF as soon as possible 
after information is collected .  An explana tion should be provided for all missing data.  
The audit trail entry will show the user’s identification information, and the date and time of 
the correction .  Investigators must provide through the EDC application formal approval of 
all the information in the eCRFs and changes to the eCRFs to endorse the final submitted 
data for the subjects for which they are responsible.  
The Sponsor  or designee will retain the eCRF data  and corresponding audit trails .  A copy of 
the final archival eCRF in the form of a C D or other electronic media will be placed in the 
investigator’s study file.

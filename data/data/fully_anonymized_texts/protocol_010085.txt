Short title EINSTEIN Junior Phase III: oral rivaroxaban in children with venous 
thrombosis
Clinical study phase III
Study objectives The primary efficacy objective is:
To assess the incidence of symptomatic recurrent venous 
thromboembolism .
The secondary efficacy objective is:
To assess the incidence of symptomatic recurrent venous 
thromboembolism and asymptomatic deterioration on repeat 
imaging.
The principal safety objective is:
To assess the incidence of overt major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding .
An additional objective is :
To characterize the pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic profile 
of rivaroxaban .
Experimental study drug Rivaroxaban
Nam e of active ingredient Rivaroxaban 
Dose Age-and body weight -adjusted dosing of rivaroxaban to achieve a similar 
exposure as that observed in adults treated for venous thromboembolism (VTE) w ith 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily .
Route of administration Oral tablets or oral suspension
Comparator study drug Subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), subcutaneous 
fondaparinux , intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) and/or oral 
vitamin K antagonist (VKA)[ADDRESS_117324] of care
Indication Children aged birth to < 18 years with documented venous thrombosis, 
including deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity, caval vein 
thrombosis, right atrial thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremity, subclavian vein thrombosis, jugular vein thrombosis, cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis, mesenteric vein

Diagnosis and main criteria 
for inclusionChildren aged birth to <18 years w ith acute venous thromboembolism 
confirmed by [CONTACT_9686].7
Study design Open -label, active -controlled, multicenter, randomized study
Methodology8Children aged birth to < 18 years w ith confirmed venous 
thromboembolism who receive initial treatment with therapeutic dosages 
of unfractionated heparin (UFH), low  molecular weight heparin 
(LMWH), or fondaparinux are potentially eligible for the study.
Initial treatment with UFH, LMWH or fondaparinux will be administered 
for at least 5 days.
Randomization can be done during the first 9 days of initial 
treatment and will be in a 2 (rivaroxaban): 1 (stan dard of care 
[SOC]) fashion. Children randomized to rivaroxaban will start 
rivaroxaban the day following the last administration of initial 
therapy with UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux but with a minimal 
duration of initial therapy of 5 days and a maximum durat ion of 
9 days.
The first administration of rivaroxaban will be started: 4 hours 
after discontinuation of UFH
12 hours after discontinuation of LMWH with a b.i.d. regimen, and 
[ADDRESS_117325] (VKA) therapy . If 
VKA therapy is planned it can be initiated any time after randomization. 
Initial therapy with UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux can be stopp ed after 
a minimum of 5 days and only if the international normalized ratio (INR) 
is above 2 on tw o separate occasions, 24 hours apart. 
In children randomized to rivaroxaban in whom VKA therapy was 
already initiated before randomization, VKA therapy shoul d be stopped 
and the switch to rivaroxaban should be made as described in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] .
The main study treatment period is for a total of [ADDRESS_117326], which was obtained at baseline, will be 
repeated, if clinically feasible.   How ever, i n children younger than 2 
years with catheter -related thrombosis, the main study treatment period is 
for a total of 1 month at which time the re peat imaging will be 
performed. Inall children, except those < 2 years with catheter -related 
thrombosis ,the decision is made to stop study treatment at 3 m onths or 
to continue for an additional 3 months. In children who completed 6 months of treatment, the decision is made to stop study treatment or to 
continue for an additional 3 months. Then, in children who completed 9 
months of treatment, the decision is made to stop study treatment or to 
continue for an additional 3 months.   In ch ildren < 2 years with catheter -
related thrombosis, the decision is made to stop study treatment at 1

month or to continue for an additional month .  Then, in children who 
completed 2 months of treatment, the decision is made to stop study 
treatment or to co ntinue for an additional month.
Regardless of the duration of study treatment ( <3, 3, 6, 9 or 12 months), 
an additional [ADDRESS_117327] -treatment observational period will be 
completed for all children. All suspected clinical study outcomes and baseline and r epeat thrombosis imaging tests will be assessed by a 
central independent adjudication committee (CIAC) blinded to treatment allocation. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will 
monitor the children’s safety and give recommendations to the steeri ng 
committee .

1. Introduction
The classical management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adults consists of an initial 
treatment with adjusted -dose intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH), body weight -adjusted 
subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or body weight -adjusted subcutaneous 
fondaparinux followed by  [CONTACT_7419] -term treatment with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA).[1]VKA 
therap y should be continued for at least three months. The dose of VKA needs to be adjusted 
to maintain the international normalized ratio (INR) in the therapeutic range (target 2.5, range 2.0-3.0). This therapeutic approach has also been adopted for VTE treatment in children.
Treatment with heparins and VKA has several unsatisfy ing aspects. For heparins, this 
includes the requirement for intravenous or subcutaneous injection and monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT ). For VK A, this includes a slow onset and offset 
of action, a narrow therapeutic window requiring frequent INR monitoring, and subsequent dose adjustments, caused by  [CONTACT_105792].
[2]An oral anticoagulant drug that 
requires no monitoring of its effect, with a rapid onset of action and a high benefit -risk ratio is 
of considerable interest not only  for adults, but especia lly for the pediatric population.
Rivaroxaban has been extensively  studied in the adult population with sy mptomatic deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary  embolism (PE). I n two dose finding studies ,[3,4]various 
rivaroxaban dosages were evaluated and compared to standard of care: LMWH and VKA. As 
a result of these dose finding studies, a rivaroxaban regimen was selected that consisted of 15mg twice daily  treatment for the initial 3 week acute treatment, followed by 20 mg once 
daily  for long- term treatment. Subsequently , this fixed dose rivarox aban regimen was 
evaluated in two large phase III studies and was compared to body  weight adjusted L MWH 
and INR titrated VKA in patients with symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary  
thromboembolism .Thepooled anal ysisdemonstrated clear non -inferiority  for the primary  
efficacy  outcome andan improved safet y profile in terms of the occurrence of major bleeding
in adults .
[5]
The goal of the rivaroxaban pediatric program is to make rivaroxaban available to children for treatment and secondary  prevention of venous thromboembolism. It is anticipated that similar 
exposure in children ,as compared to adults ,will result in a similar safet y and efficacy  profile 
in children . To accomplish this goal, an age-and body  weight -adjusted dosing regimen is 
being evaluated in aphase II program in children aged [ADDRESS_117366] 
month of their regular anticoagulant treatment.
In phase II, enrollment of children aged 6 months to less than 18 y earshas been completed.
Rivaroxaban was well tolerated , no recurrent venous thromboembolism and/or major bleeding 
were observed and PK/PD results were in the expected range for children weighing more than 
12 kg.23  24

1.2 Various manifestations of venous thrombosis
Compared with adults, venous thrombosis is rare in children. Venous thrombosis in children 
is often provoked b y a variety of risk factors and rarel y is idio pathic in nature .[6]Expressions 
of venous thrombosis that usually  requires anticoagulant therapy  include deep vein 
thrombosis of the lower extremity , caval vein thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis, right atrial 
thrombosis, pulmonary  embolism, deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremity , subclavian 
vein thrombosis, jugular vein thrombosis, mesenteric vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, and cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis.
A Canadian registry  published in [ADDRESS_117368] imp ortant predisposing cause of venous thrombosis in children (33%), whereas inherited 
coagulation disorders accounted for 9%. Venous thrombosis was associated with cancer 
(23%), congenital heart disease (15%), and trauma (15%) .
[7]The only  randomized venous 
thrombosis treatment study  in children (the REVIVE study ) confirmed that cancer and 
infections followed b y congenital heart disease were the most f requently  reported risk 
factors .[8,9]
Inthe REVIVE study , children with cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis were at that time 
excluded due to lack of consensus on the need for anticoagulation. Risk factors for recurrent VTE in the European collaborative pediatric database on cerebral venous thro mbosis include 
age at onset, absence of anticoagulant treatment, persistent venous occlusion, or presence of the prothrombin gene mutation .
[9]The current treatment recommendation for cerebral vein and 
sinus thrombosis is therapeutic doses of anticoagulants .[10]
Currently , the recommendations f or the initial treatment of various manifestations of venous 
thrombosis is activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT )adjusted unfractionated heparin 
(UFH) ,body  weight adjusted low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux . For 
subsequent treatment, either INR- titrated vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or body  weight 
adjusted LMWH is recommended. The American College of Chest Ph ysicians (ACCP) 
management guidelines for children with secondary VTE (i.e., VTE that occurred in association with a risk factor) in whom the risk factor has resolved recommend anticoagulant 
therap y for [ADDRESS_117369] continued 
anticoagulant therap y beyond 3 months. For c hildren with idiopathic VTE ,the 
recommendation is antic oagulant therap y for 6 to 12 months. For catheter -related thrombosis, 
the guidelines recommend a total duration of anticoagulation of between 6 week sand 
3months.
[9]
1.3 Rationale of the study and risk -benefit assessment
Treatment with heparins and VKA is limited because of the requirement for daily  
subcutaneous or intravenous injections and regular blood sa mpling for laboratory  monitoring 
followed b y dose adaptations. I n children, the availability  of an oral anticoagulant treatment 
that does not require subcutaneous or intravenous injections and regular blood sampling for laboratory  monitoring, as is the cas e in adults, would be desirable. 
Type of anticoagulant drug, dos e and duration of treatment for VTE in children is primaril y 
derived from adult data. The majority  ofthe recommendations for dosing in children are
Clinical Study  Protocol
No.  BAY 59 -7939/[ZIP_CODE]
27 SEP 2017 Version 5.0 Page: 27of 167
based on Grade 2 level of evidence.[10]Therefore, there is a medical need for additional 
clinical studies that address the efficacy  and safet y of anticoagulants treatment in children.
In adults, rivaroxaban is administered orall y and is characterized b y stable and predictable 
pharmacokinetics and, therefore, does not require laboratory  monitoring with subsequent dose 
adjustments. I n the Phase III EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE studiesinadults,[11]
rivaroxaban was non- inferior to standard of care with enoxaparin followed by [CONTACT_105796]. 
In the pooled analysis,theincidence of the primary  efficacy  outcome (the composite of 
symptomatic recurrent DVT, non -fatal and fatal PE) was lower on rivaroxaban than on 
enoxaparin/VKA treatment, with a similar incidence of clinically  relevant bleeding. The 
comparison against plac ebo in patients studied for extended treatment of VTE (EINSTEIN 
extension study ) demonstrated clear superiority for rivaroxaban against placebo in all efficacy  
analyses and across all subgroups. Rivaroxaban was well tolerated and the safet y profile, 
includ ing adverse events and observed laboratory  abnormalities, was comparable to 
enoxaparin/VKA treatment. 
2. Study objectives
The efficacy objective s are:
To assess the incidence of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism
To assess the incidence of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism and 
asymptomatic deterioration on repeat imaging .
The safet y objective is:
To assess the incidence of overt major and clinically  relevant non- major bleeding .
Other objectives are:
To characterize the pharmacokin etic/pharmacod ynamic profile of rivaroxaban .
3. Study design
This is a multicenter , open -label, active -controlled, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy  
and safet y of an age -and body  weight -adjusted rivaroxaban regimen in children with a cute 
venous thromboembolism.
The study  will be initiated with children in the age group between 12 and less than 18 y ears 
since the age -and bod y weight adjusted dosing regimen has been confirmed for this age group 
in the phase II stud y [ZIP_CODE] and was approved b y the data m onitoring committee and steering 
committee .The dosing schedule/regimen for this age group is available in Appendix 4
(update: for oral suspension this is implemented through Amendment 8) .

Once the age -and bod y weight adjusted dosing regimen has been confirmed for the age group 
between 6 and less than 12 y ears i n the phase II study  [ZIP_CODE] and approved by  [CONTACT_105795], the dosing schedule/regimen for this age group 
will be made available through an administrative amendment (For tablet, t his was 
implemented through Amendment 426; update: for oral suspension this is implemented

The age -and bod y weight adjusted dosing regimen has now been established for all children 
aged birth to less than 18 y ears from data collected in the phase I/II studies and has been 
approved b y the data monitoring committee and steering committee. Table 17–2 specifies the 
dosing regimen for each age group.29
Amendment 8 introduced a single consistent body  weight adjusted dosing schedule/regimen 
for children aged 6 months to < 18 y earsand body  weight ≥12kg (see Table 17–2).30Age 
dependenc yis implicitly  considered in this table as certain bod y weights are connected 
(through standard growth charts) with certain ages (with some variability , excluding extreme 
obesity ) as well as with anatomical and ph ysiological differences that affect the absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and e xcretion ( ADME )processes at different ages .31
                                                                                                                                      
26The tablet dosing regimen for children from 6 to <12 years was included via Amendment 4 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
27The oral suspension was implemented via Amendment 8 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
28Information of start of enrollment in cohorts 6 months to less years 2 years and 2 to less than 6 years was added via

Amendment 10 introduced dosing information and a new three times dail y dosing schedule 
for children with bod y weight between 6 and <12 kg. This new dosing regimen is based on an 
exploratory  PopPK model, that c onsiders all rivaroxaban PK data available from children 
below 2 y ears dosed in our phase I and phase II studies. As less data are available for y ounger 
children (e.g., due to sparse sampling), the model predictions have a higher level of 
uncertaint y for c hildren with lower body  weight. The Steering Committee therefore 
recommended to evaluate PK around the expected C maxand at C trough as soon as the stead y 
state is achieved (day  2+1 after start of rivaroxaban treatment; Visit 1a). 
The PK samples obtained a t Visit 1a will be shipped and analy zed for each child individually  
and will allow to determine whether the plasma concentrations are in the adult reference range. The results will be provided to the investigator/site and discussed in a timely  manner, 
i.e.within approximately  1 to 2 weeks after sample collection. Up to now, the predictions 
from the exploratory  PopPK model are confirmed by  [CONTACT_105797].
Amendment 12 opened enroll ment to children aged birth to < 6 months and introduced dosing 
information for children with a body  weight between 2.6 and 6 kg. This new dosing regimen 
is based on dat afrom all studies in children younger than 2 years, as well as an exploratory  
PopPK model, that considers all rivaroxaban PK data available from all children younger than
2 years.As the exploratory  model is based on limited data (e.g., limited number of subjects, 
sparse sampling), the model predictions ha da higher level of uncertainty  for these children. 
However, observ ed data from this study  ([ZIP_CODE]) and data from the phase I/II study  ([ZIP_CODE]) 
that is enrolling children of this weight categor y, have confirmed the predictions from the 
exploratory  PopPK model in all children dosed t.i.dthus far in both studies.32
Study description33
Children aged birth to < 18 y ears with confirmed acute venous thromboembolism who receive 
initial treatment with therapeutic dosages of unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular 
weight heparin (LMWH), or fondaparinux are potentially  eligible for the study . Initial 
treatment with UFH, LMWH or fondaparinux will be administered for at least 5 day s (day  1-
5).
Randomization can be done during the first 9 day s of initial treatment and will be in a 
2(rivaroxaban): 1 (standard of care [SOC]) fashio n. Children randomized to rivaroxaban will 
start rivaroxaban the day  following the last administration of initial therapy  with UFH, 
LMWH, or fondaparinux but with a minimal duration of initial therapy  of [ADDRESS_117370] a dministration of rivaroxaban will be started:
4 hours after discontinuation of UFH
12 hours after discontinuation of L MWH with a b.i.d. regimen, and 
                                                                                                                                      
32 The paragraph was added via Amendment 12 ( see Section [IP_ADDRESS] )

[ADDRESS_117371] of care can continue UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux or can 
switch to VKA therap y. If VKA therapy  is planned, it can be initiated an y time after 
randomization. Initial therapy with UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux can be stopped after a 
minimum of 5 day s and only if the INR is above 2 on two separate occasions, 24 hours apart. 
In children randomized to rivaroxaban in whom VKA therap y was already initiated before 
randomization, VKA therap y should be stopped and the switch to rivaroxaban should be 
made as desc ribed in Section [IP_ADDRESS].34After randomization, children will receive either 
rivaroxaban or comp arator for a main study  treatment period of [ADDRESS_117372] which was obtained at 
baseline will be repeated, if clinically  feasible . However, in children y ounger than 2 y ears 
with catheter -related thrombosis, the main study  treatment p eriod is for a total of 1 month at 
which time the repeat imaging will be performed. 
In all children, except those aged < 2 y ears with catheter- related thrombosis, the decision is 
made to stop study  treatment at 3 months or to continue for an additional 3 months. I n 
children who completed 6 months of treatment, the decision is made to stop study  treatment 
or to continue for an additional 3 months. Then, in children who completed 9 months of 
treatment, the decision is made to stop study  treatment or to conti nue for an additional 
3months.   In children < 2 y ears with catheter-related thrombosis, the decision is made to 
stop study  treatment at 1 month or to continue for an additional month.  Then, in children 
who completed 2 months of treatment, the decision is made to stop study  treatment or to 
continue for an additional month.
Regardless of the duration of study  treatment ( <3, 3, 6, 9 or 12 months), an additional [ADDRESS_117373] -treatment observational period will be completed for all children. After 
cessation of study  treatment, it is at the investigator’s discretion to continue with 
anticoagulants.The primary  efficacy  outcome is symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism . The 
secondary  efficacy  outcome is the composite of all sy mptomatic recurrent venous 
thromboembolism and asymptomatic deterioration in thrombotic burden on repeat imaging.
The principal safet y outcome is the composite of overt major and clinically relevant non -
major bleeding . Allsuspected clinical stud y outcomes and baseline and repeat thromb osis 
imaging tests will be assessed by  a central independent adjudication committee (CIAC) 
blinded to treatment allocation. An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will 
monitor the children’s safety  and give recommendations to the steering committee .
For all children, visits are scheduled at regular time points (see Table 0–1 andTable 0–2). 
Randomized children who have not received the study  drug will be seen (visit or phone 
contact) at the end of the respective main study  treatment period. Children who premature ly
discontinue study  drug will be seen at the end of the intended study  treatment period at month 
<3,3, 6, 9 or 12. During all contacts, the treatment and clinical course of the child will be 
evaluated. Children with suspected efficacy  or safety  outcomes will undergo c onfirmatory

4.4 Concomitant medication
Non-steroid anti- inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs) and antiplatelet agents are strongl y 
discouraged since they  increase the risk for bleeding in patients treated with heparins, 
fondaparinux and/or vitamin K antagonist ( VKA )or rivaroxaban. However, if such 
medication is indicated, the lowest possible dosage should be selected.
Concomitant use of strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P -gp, i.e. all human 
immunodeficiency  virus protease inhibitors and azole -antimy cotics agents ( including but not 
limited to ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole), if used systemicall y, isnot 
allowed, as well as concomitant use of strong inducers of CYP3A4 (including but not limited 
torifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], rifabutin, phenobarbital, phen ytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). Concomitant treatment

thrombosis, right atrial thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and catheter related 
thrombosis and
b) cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis, jugular vein thrombosis, mesenteric vein 
thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis and renal vein thrombosis.
Specific procedures for treatment assignment through I xRS are contained in the I xRS manual.
5.1.1 Rivaroxaban group44
The body  weight adjusted dosing schedule for children aged birth to < 18 years is provided in 
Appendix 4 (see Section 17.4).45
Children with body  weight of ≥ 20 kg will receive rivaroxaban tablets or oral suspension. 
Children with body  weight of < 20 kg will receive rivaroxaban as oral suspension.
Children with body  weight of ≥ 30 kg will be treated according to a once daily  (o.d.) regimen, 
irrespective of whether they  receive rivaroxaban tablets or oral suspension. Children with 
body  weight between 12 and < 30 kg will receive rivaroxaban twice daily  (b.i.d) with a dosing 
intervals of approximately 12 hours .Children with body  weight below 12 kg will receive 
rivaroxaban three times daily  (t.i.d.) with dosing interval of approximately  8 hours .
Dosing regimen, including dosing frequency , will be adjusted if the child’s body  weight 
changes during the stud y (Table 17–2). 
With a once daily  regimen, rivaroxaban will be taken in the morning during or within [ADDRESS_117382] and the evening dose will be taken during or within 1hour after dinner. 
With a three times daily  regimen, the morning , afternoon and night doses should be t aken 
during or within 30 minutes after feeding .
Each rivaroxaban dose should be immediately  followed by  [CONTACT_105799][INVESTIGATOR_105758] 240 mL  of liquid (o.d. or b.i.d regimen) or 120 mL (t.i.d. regimen) . This volume will 
depend on age and may  range from for example 20mL in children aged 6 months up to 240 
mL in adolescents. 46
Use of oral suspension
Oral suspension is available for use in children aged birth to < 18 y ears. 
At Visit 2, t he Taste -and-Texture Questionnaire, using a three point scale, will be applied to 
determine the acceptance of the oral suspension in children from 4 to < 18years. The pre -
                                                                                                                                      
43A clarification was added that the day of birth has to be collected via Amendment 4 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
44The section was modified via Amendment 12 to include children from birth ( see Section [IP_ADDRESS] )

dose is taken and up to 240 mL  of liquid has been taken.
Instructions on how to handle rivaroxaban oral suspension can be found in the Rivaroxaban 
Oral Sus pension Han dling Instructions.
Handling of missed doses47
If rivaroxaban is taken with an o.d. regimen, a missed dose should be taken immediately  when 
it is noticed, but only  on the same day . Double dosing on a single day  is not allowed. 
If rivaroxaban is taken with a b.i.d. regimen, a missed morning dose should be taken 
immediately  when it is noticed, and it may  be taken together with the evening dose. A missed 
evening dose can only be taken at the same evening.
If rivaroxaban is taken wi th a t.i.d. regimen, the t.i.d. admi nistration schedule with 
approximately 8-hour intervals should be resumed at the next scheduled dose without 
compensating for the missed dose.
On the following day , the child should continue with the regular o.d. ,b.i.d.or t.i.d. regimen.46
[IP_ADDRESS] Switching from heparin/fondaparinux to rivaroxaban
For switching from heparin/fondaparinux to rivaroxaban, the pharmacologi cal activity  of 
UFH, LMWH and fondaparinux should be taken into account. The first administration of 
rivaroxaban should be planned 1) 4 hours after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_105759], 2) 12hours 
after the last injection of LMWH with a twice -daily  regimen, or 3) [ADDRESS_117384] 
injection of fondaparinux or L MWH with a once -daily  regimen. Heparin/fondaparinux 
treatment cannot be continued after the start of rivaroxaban treatment .
[IP_ADDRESS] Switching from rivaroxaban to heparin/fondaparinux
Children who switch from rivaroxaban to heparin/ fondaparinux can switch at the time of the 
next scheduled dose.
[IP_ADDRESS] Switching from rivaroxaban to VKA and vice -versa
Children who switch from rivaroxaban to VKA need to continue rivaroxaban for [ADDRESS_117385] dose of VKA. Afte r 2 day s of co -administration an I NR should be obtained prior 
to the next scheduled dose of rivaroxaban. Co -administration of rivaroxaban and VKA if 
advised to continue until the INR is ≥ 2.0. 
Children who switch from VKA to rivaroxaban should avoid using both drugs at therapeutic 
doses simultaneously . Rivaroxaban can be started if the INR is < 2.5.
5.1.2 Comparator group
Children randomized to the comparator group will continue with UFH, LMWH or 
fondaparinux or may switch to VKA therap y.VKA dosages will be adjusted to maintain the

6.10 Safety outcomes
The primary  safet y outcome is the composite of overt major bleeding and clinically  relevant 
non-major bleeding. Other safety  outcomes include all deaths and other vascular events 
(myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accide nt, non -CNS sy stemic embolism).
The CIAC will classify bleeding as:
Major bleeding which is defined as overt bleeding and:
associated with a fall in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or more, 
or leading to a transfusion of the equivalent of 2 or more units of packed red blood 
cells or whole blood in adults , or
occurring in a critical site, e.g. intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], intraocular, pericardial, 
intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment sy ndrome, retroperitoneal, or
contributing to death .
Clinically  relevant non- major bleeding is defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for 
major bleeding, but associated with:
medical intervention, or
unscheduled contact (visit or telephone call) with a physician, or
(temporary ) cessation of study  treatment, or
discomfort for the child such as pain or
impairment of activities of daily  life (such as loss of school day s or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) .
All other overt bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_105763] y relevant bleeding will 
be classified as trivial bleed.

6.12 Management of bleeding in children
If a child has a serious bleed during stud y treatment, the following routine measures could be 
considered:
Delay  the next L MWH, fondaparinux, VKA or rivaroxaban administration or 
discontinue treatment, if indicated
If the child is treated with VKA, consider vitamin K administration
If the child is treated with LMWH, consider protamine sulfate administration
Consider usual treatment for bleeding, including blood transfusion, and/or fresh frozen 
plasma
If the child is treated with rivaroxaban, obtain the PK/PD sample .
If bleeding cannot be controlled, consider administration of one of the following 
procoagulants (both according to the dosages advised in the package insert):
4-factor concentrate
recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven®)
Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity  of 
rivaroxaban.
6.13 Efficacy outcomes
The primary  efficacy  outcome will be the composite of all sy mptomatic recurrent venous 
thromboembolism as confi rmed b y the CIAC . The secondary  efficacy  outcome will be the 
composite of all sy mptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism and asymptomatic 
deterioration on repeat imaging,[3],[10]as assessed by  [CONTACT_105812] .
6.14 PK/PD assessments81
The prothrombin time, aPTT and anti- factor Xa activity  (anti -Xa) will be used to assess the 
pharmacod ynamic effects after administration of the study  drug.
Blood samples will be taken for PK and PD measurements from children randomized to rivaroxaban.

If rivaroxaban was temporarily stoppe d, PK/PD blood samples should only be obtained if the 
rivaroxaban has been restarted and sustained for at le ast [ADDRESS_117427] .[16]At visit 3, in children from 6 months to 1 year ,it is advised to withdraw blood 
from a peripheral catheter rather than a central venous line to limit the volume of required 
blood . If a blood sample is taken from a peripheral catheter, fluid has to be withdrawn until all
fluid is removed. For venipunctures, a n anesthetic cream can be applied .Heparin can be used 
to maintain catheter patency ; however, before collecting PK/PD samples, the catheter needs to 
be flushed with saline. A first volume of (diluted) blood should be discarded, as usual.83
Detailed information about the handling and labeling of the samples will be provided in the 
laboratory  manual. To estimate the PK/PD profile of riv aroxaban, results will be pooled and 
analyzed using population approaches. Details for the population PK/PD analy sis will be 
described in a separate evaluation plan

identified in the final SAP, issued prior to data base lock. All efforts will be taken to avoid missing data in important baseline characterist ics and post baseline data. Missing data 
proportions will be reported.
7.2 Analysis sets
Full anal ysis set: this population will include all randomized children. Safety  analy sisset: this 
population will include all randomized children who received at least one dose of study  
medication. Per-protocol set: theper-protocol set may  exclude subjects with major protocol 
deviation s. The detailed list of these deviation s will be finalized prior to database lock and 
included in the protocol deviation document , the approved final list of important deviations,

includes all screening failures. 
7.3 Demographic and other baseline characteristics
Summary  statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum for 
quantitative variables) will be presented b y treatment. Frequency  tables for qualitative data 
will be provided. Medical history findings will be summarized using Medical Dictionary  for 
Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA )terms.
7.4 Bleeding analysis85
All safet y anal yses will be performed on the safet y anal ysis set. All bleeding events that
occurred during study  treatment or within 2 day s after stop of study  medication will be 
summarized by  [CONTACT_1570]. Bleeding events observed more than 2 day s after stop of 
study  medication will be described separatel y.Individual listings of major and clinically 
relevant non- major ble eding events will be provided.
Incidence proportions (number of children with outcome during the period divided by  [CONTACT_105814]) and cumulative incidences (time to first 
event; Kaplan- Meier) will be calculated for the primary  safet y outcome b y treatment group at 
the end of the main study treatment period for pooled data. Incidence proportions will be 
calcu lated for each age stratum at the end of the main study  treatment period as well. In 
addition, incidence proportions will be calculated by  [CONTACT_105815]2 and 3 months (for the children

originate from a formal sample size calculation, but is based on a feasibility  assessment .
7.9 Adverse events 
Individual listings of adverse events will be provided. The incidence of treatment -emergent 
adverse eve nts will be summarized by  [CONTACT_3148] ,using MedDRA preferred terms, grouped b y 
primary  system organ class.
For the purpose of adverse event ( AE)documentation, study  drug is defined as either 
rivaroxaban or standard of care as allocated starting from randomization up to the end of study  treatment visit.
7.9.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event (AE)
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject administer ed with a pharmaceutical 
product and does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An 
                                                                                                                                      
88Statistical analysis of Taste -and Texture questionnaire and PTS was added via Amendment 8 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
89The mi nimum number of children was increased via Amendment 12 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
Clinical Study  Protocol
No.  BAY 59 -7939/[ZIP_CODE]
27 SEP 2017 Version 5.0 Page: 55of 167
AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associat ed with the use of a drug, whether or not 
considered related to the drug. AE associated with the use of a drug, whether or not 
considered drug related, includes AE occurring in the course of the use of a drug, from an overdose whether accidental or intentional, from drug abuse, from drug withdrawal, or if there is a reasonable possibility that the event occurred purely  as a result of participation in the 
study , even i f it is not related to the drug. The clinical manifestation of an y failure of expected 
pharmacological action is not recorded as an AE, if it is already  reflected as an outcome 
captured in the eCRF, except if the event fulfills the criteria for a “serious” AE.
A surgical procedure or intervention that was planned prior to the study should not be
recorded as an AE. Conditions, including abnormal phy sical examination findings, sy mptoms, 
and diseases will be recorded as medical history , if they  started before randomization. If the 
condition started or deteriorated after randomization, it will be doc umented as adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious adverse event (SAE)
AnSAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose is resulting in death, is 
life-threatening (i.e. the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event), requires 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105767] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8954] 12 hours, is pre -planned, or is not associated with an AE (i.e. social 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]), results in persistent or significant 
disability /incapacit y. In addition, SAE is a congenital anomaly or a birth defect or an 
important medical event, including associated invasive treatment, as judged by  [CONTACT_1275]. For reporting of a SAE, local regulations take precedence if more stringent definitions are applicable.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected AEs
An unexpected AE is an y adverse drug event whose specificit y or severit y is not consistent 
with the investigator brochure or package inserts for marketed products. Also, reports which add significant information o n specificit y or severity  of an already  documente d AE constitute 
unexpected AEs, e.g. an event more specific or more severe than described in the investigator 
brochure would be considered “unexpected”. Specific examples would be 1) acute renal 
failure as a labeled adverse event with a subsequent new report of interstitial nephritis and 2) 
hepatitis with a first report of fulminant hepatitis.
7.9.2 Relationship of AE to the study drug
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the use of study  drugis a 
clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the eCRF
and is based on whether there was a "reasonable causal r elationship" to the study  drug . An 
assessment of "no" would include the existence of a clear alter native explanation, e.g. 
mechanical bleeding at surgical site, or non -plausibility , e.g. the child while on a bike is 
struck by  [CONTACT_105818]. An assessmen t of "y es" indicates that there is a reasonable 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_105768] . Factors in assessing the 
relationship of the AE to study  drug include the temporal sequence from drug administration 
(the event should occur after the study  drug is given) and the length of time from study  drug

exposure, recovery  on study  drug discontinuation (de -challenge), and recurrence on study  
drug re-introduction (re -challenge), underl ying, concomitant, or intercurrent diseases should 
beevaluated in the context of the natural history  and course of an y disease the child may 
have, concomitant medication or treatment and, finally, the pharmacology  and 
pharmacokinetics of study  drug . 
7.9.3 Causal relationship to protocol -required procedure
The as sessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol -required 
procedure is based on the presence of a reasonable relationship.
7.9.4 Intensity of an AE, action taken and outcome
The intensity  of an AE is assessed as mild (usually  transient in nature and generall y not 
interfering with normal activities), moderate (sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
normal activities), and severe (prevents normal activities).
Any action on study  drug to resolve the AE is to be documented as either : stud y drug 
withdrawn, interrupted, dose not changed, not applicable or unknown. Other specific 
treatment(s) of AEs will be documented as: none, remedial drug therap y or other . The 
outcome of the AE is documented as: recovered/resolved, recovering/ resolving, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae, not recovered/not resolved, fatal or unknown.

file. A laboratory  test abnormality  cons idered clinically  relevant, e.g. causing the subject to 
withdraw from the stud y, requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations, or 
judged relevant b y the investigator, should be reported as an AE. Each event should be 
described in detail along with start and stop dates, severit y, relationship to study drug, action 
taken and outcome. When assigning the cause of death, "death" should not be recorded as an 
AE on the AE page. Instead, "death" is the outcome of underl ying AE(s).
7.9.[ADDRESS_117431] be reported within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness . Reports should be as 
complete as possible ,and must be followed up until resolu tion or stabilization. When 
required, and according to local law and regulations, SAEs must be reported to the ethics committee and regulatory authorities. If reported, SAEs occurring after the protocol -defined 
observation period will be processed b y Bayeraccording to all applicable regulations.
Bayer will inform all investigational sites about the occurrence of suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reaction/s (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) according to all applicable regulations.

7.9.7 Study specific exceptions to the (S)AE reporting
The efficacy  outcomes (recurrent venous thrombosis) will not be reported as (S)AE. Transfer 
of children to a rehabilitation unit as a standard practice will not be considered as a prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105769] a SAE. However, if this transfer is part of 
treatment of a medical complication, it should be considered as prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105770] a SAE. To collect additional information about clinically  
important laboratory  abnormalities, any  laborat ory abnormality  that required cessation of the 
study  drug will be captured as a SAE.

occurred so far in the clinical development are shown in the current IB. If relevant new safety 
information is identified, it will be integrated into an update of the IB and distributed. The 
expectedness of AEs needs to be reported only for rivaroxaban study  treatment and will be 
determined b y Bayer according to the applicable reference document and according to all 
local regulations.

7.9.10 Adverse events related to devices used for preparation and 
administration of rivaroxaban oral suspension
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Incident
An “ Incident” is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and / or performance 
of a device, as well as any  inadequacy  in the labeling or the instructions for use which, 
directly  or indirectl y, led, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient, or user or 
of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health.
Any event which meets all three basic reporting criteria (A, B and C) is considered an
“Incident” . The criteria are as follows:
A)An adverse device event has occurred. Ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_105771]:
Malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance, or
Degradation / destruction of the device, or 
Inappropriate therap y (e.g., underdosing or overdosing) .
Clinical Study  Protocol
No.  BAY 59 -7939/[ZIP_CODE]
27 SEP 2017 Version 5.0 Page: 58of 167
B)The device is suspected to be a contributory  cause of the “Incident” .
C)The event led, or might have led, to death or serious deterioration in state of health of a 
patient, or user, or other person.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Other Reportable Incident
An“Other Reportable Incident” is any  incident that did not lead to death or serious 
deterioration in health, but it might do if it occurred again under less fortunate circumstances or without intervention of healthcare personnel. This may  include cases without any  medical 
event reporte d. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Other Event 
An“Other Event” is any device related case that does not fulfill all the three basic “ Incident ” 
criteria A -C listed in the definition of an “ Incident ” above. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_117434] Technical Complaint (PTC)
A PTC is any  report received (written, elect ronic or verbal communication) about a potential 
or alleged failure of a product in its quality  (including the identit y, durability, reliability, 
safet y, efficacy  or performance) or suspect counterfeit. The complaint may  or may  not 
represent a potential risk to the patient. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Device Malfunction or Failure and Medical Device Reporting
Any device complaint, malfunction, or failure including use errors will be recorded by  [CONTACT_105819]/investigational site, including all relevant device information using the clinical investigations device complaint form, and forwarded within 24 hours to the sponsor or sponsor’s designee for evaluation and investigation, regardless of whether or not a medical event was associated with the device malfunction or failure.  
There are three different situations, in which a medical device complaint form might need to 
be filled out by  [CONTACT_093]:
a)When an AE is recorded, the investigator needs to check if a device malfunction or 
failure might be associated with the recorded AE.
b)When a device malfunction or device failure occurs, the investigator needs to assess 
whether an AE might have occurred in relation to the device.
c)When a device malfunction, device failure, or use error occurs, without any associated 
AE, this also needs to be captured in the form and immediatel y forwarded to the 
sponsor for investigation.
The details of the malfunction and medical circumstances will be captured on a Device 
Complaint Form filled out by  [CONTACT_105820]’s 
designee. The final determination of reportability  is made by  [CONTACT_105821]/investigational site based on the medical circumstances surrounding the event.  
Investigator’s notification of the sponsor
All investigators will be instructe d and trained on all relevant aspects of the investigator’s 
reporting obligations for device incidents and serious public health threats.  This information,

without the need to provide a reason.
if, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], study  drug should be stopped for an y reason.
at the (exceptional) request of Bay er.
If study  drug is temporarily  discontinued, it can be restarted. If stud y drug is permanentl y 
discontinued, further treatment is at the investigator’s discretion. 
If the child or parent s/legal representative swithdraws consent to treatment with study  drug 
(including comparator) , the investigator will ask to continue with study  visits as planned, only  
with the aim to collect potential study  outcomes and AEs. If the child/parent/legal 
representative sstate to th e investigator that they  no longer authorize to continue to obtain 
outcome data, this will be respected and documented in the source records , and no further 
study  data will be collected .
In all children who prematurel y discontinue study drug for other reasons than withdrawal of 
informed consent, stud y visits will take place as planned to collect potential study  outcomes 
and AEs.

clinical practice and are used and generall y recognized as reliable, accurate and relevant.
8. Data handling and quality a ssurance
For all data entered into the eCRF , source documentation should be available at the site. 
Asource document checklist will be used to identify the source data for all data points 
collected. In accordance with GCP and Bay er's procedures, monitors will review the protocol, 
study  requirements, and responsibilities with the site staff , including identification and 
documentation of source data items. Bay er personnel will monitor the site to verify  that data
are authentic, accurate, and complete and tha t the safet y and rights of participati ng children 
are being protected. In addition, they  will assess if the study  is conducted in accordance with 
the latest version of the protocol and study  agreements. The investigator and the head of the 
medical institut ion (where applicable) agrees to allow the monitor direct access to all relevant 
documents.
8.[ADDRESS_117438] and 
data will be entered into a validated database or data system (Tools for S yntactic Corpus

minimum timelines required b y Bayer, alternative arrangements will be made to ensure the 
availability  of the source documents for the required period . The investigator/institution will 
notify  Bayer if a change in archival arrangements occurs. The investigator site file will not be 
destroy ed without Bay er's approval. The investigator's contract will contain all regulations 
relevant for the stud y center.
9. Premature termination of the study
The investigator has the right to terminat e participation in the study  at an y time. 
Bayer has the right to close this study  or study  sites at any  time, which may be due but not 
limited to the following reasons: 
If the risk-benefit ratio becomes unacceptable due to, for example ,
safety or efficacy findings from this study  
results of parallel clinical studies.
If study  conduct (e.g. recruitment rate; dropout rate; data quality; protocol compliance) 
does not suggest a pro per completion of the trial within a reasonable time frame.
For an y of the above closures, the following applies:
Closures should occur only  after consul tation between involved parties
All affected institutions must be informed, as applicable, according to local law.
All study  materials will be returned to Bay er, except documentation that has to remain stored 
at the site. This documentation can only  be destructed with approval from Bay er. 
10. Ethical and legal aspects
10.[ADDRESS_117440], evaluation, and 
documentation of this study , are designed to ensure that Bay er and investigator abide by  [CONTACT_105823]. The study  
will also be carried out in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_39684](s) and regulation(s).
Documented approval from appropriate Independent Ethics Committees ( IECs )/Institutional 
Review Boards ( IRBs) will be obtained for all participating centers/countries before start of 
the study , according to GCP, local laws, regulations and organizations. When necessary , an 
extension, amendment or renewal of the IEC/IRB approval must be obtained and also 
forwarded to Bay er. The responsible unit (e.g. IEC/I RB, head of the stud y center/medical 
institution) must supply  Bayer, upon request, a list of the IEC/I RB members involved in the 
vote and a statement to confirm that the IEC/I RB is organized and operates according to GCP 
and a pplicable laws and regulations.

protocol. 
Modifications to the study  protocol will not be implemented by  [CONTACT_105824]. However, the investigator or Bay er may  
implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to 
the tr ial children without prior IEC/I RB/Bay er approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. As soon as 
possible, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it and if appropriate the proposed protocol amendment should be submitted to the I EC/IRB/head of medical 
institution/Bay er. An y deviations from the protocol must be explained and documented b y the 
investigator.
For each participating European Union ( EU)country , the end of the study  according to the 
EU Clinical Trial Directive will be reached when the last visit of t he last subject for all centers 
in the r espective country  has occurred. 
The end of the stud y as a whole will be reached as soon as the end of the study  according to 
the above definition has been reached in all participating countries (EU and non -EU).
10.2 Child information and consent
All relevant study information will be summarized in an integrated child information sheet, an 
informed consent and an informed assent form provided by  [CONTACT_105825]. A 
sample child information and informed consent and assent form are provided as documents 
separate to this protocol. Consent will be asked from the parent(s)/ legal guardian(s) and, if appropriate as determined by  [CONTACT_1295], age and individual child capability , will be 
asked from the child, according to countr y-specific regulations.
The investigator or designee will explain all relevant aspects of the stud y to the parent(s)/legal 
guardian(s) and the child, if applicable, prior to entry  into t he stud y. 
The parent(s)/legal guardian(s) and the child, if applicable, will have ample time and opportunity  to ask questions and will be informed about the right to withdraw from the study  
at an y time without any disadvantage and without having to provide reasons for their 
decision.
The child can onl y enter the study  if the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) voluntarily  agree to sign 
and date the informed consent and the child provides informed consent or assent, as 
appropriate and determined by  [CONTACT_1295], age and individual child capability , and have 
done so. T hen the investigator or designee will sign and date the forms. The parent(s)/legal 
guardian(s) and the child, if applicable, will receive a cop y of the signed and dated form(s). 
The signed informed consent and the assent form will remain in the investigat or site file or, if 
locally  required, in the child’s file. 
The informed consent/assent form and an y other written information provided to the 
child/parents/legal guardians will be revised whenever important new information becomes available that may  be re levant to the child's consent, or if there is an amendment to the 
protocol that necessitates a change to the content of the child information and/or the written 
Clinical Study  Protocol

The dosing schedule/regimen for theage group from 6 to <12 yearswas included.
Rationale:
The body weight adjusted dosing regimen was confirmed for the age group between 6 and 
less than 12 y ears in the phase II study  ([ZIP_CODE]). Therefore, the dosing schedule/regimen for 
this age group was included.Affected protocol section: Section 3  Study  design , Section 5.1.1  Rivaroxaban group , New Section 17.5  Appendix 5:

Affected protocol section:
Section 5.3  Duration of study  treatment
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 5: Addition of allowing heparin flushes for 
catheters
Heparins flushes were added to maintain catheter patency .
Rationale:Heparin flushes are more effective to maintain the peripheral catheter patency  that saline 
flushes. Therefore, it was decided to allow heparin flushes except for flushes before PK/PD 
samples. These have to be performed with saline to avoid biased PK/PD results.
Affected proto col section:
Section 6.13  PK/PD assessments
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 6: Addition of instructions on how to take rivaroxaban 
with an o.d. and b.i.d. regimen in children aged 6 to < 12 years
Instructions for rivaroxaban administration with an o.d. and b.i.d. regimen for children aged 6 
< 12 y ears were added.
Rationale:
The addition of the dosing table for children aged 6 to < 12 years required instructions how to 
administer rivaroxaban on an o.d. and b.i.d. regimen, respectivel y.
Affected sections: Section 5.1.1  Rivaroxaban group
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 7: Addition of ha ndling instructions for missed doses
Instructions for handling of missed doses are provided for o.d. and bid dosing in children aged 
6 to <12 y ears.
Rationale: 
With the implementation of the dosing regimen for children from 6 to <12 y ears handling of 
missed doses needed to be clarified. Rather than adding these instructions to the section “6 to 
<12 years age group”, the respective text was deleted in the description of the age cohort “12 
to <18 years age group”, and a new paragraph, applicable to all age groups was added.

16.2 Amendment 8
Amendment 8 is the second global amendment dated 20 Sep 2016.
16.2.1 Overview of changes
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 1: Change of sponsor ship information
The sponsor was changed from Bay er Healthcare A G to Bay er AG for non -US territory  and 
sponsor information for Bay er Healthcare Pharmaceuticals Inc . was added for US- territory .

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 2: Change of non- emergency medical and protocol issues 
contact
[CONTACT_105829]- emergency  medical and protocol issues contact [CONTACT_36732].
Rational:
The update of the contact [CONTACT_105830] -emergency  medical and protocol issues reflect the 
change of the responsible Study  Medical Expert.
Affected sections: Title page
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 3: Extension of the randomization tim eframe
The timeframe in which randomization can be done was extended from day 1- 5 to day  1-9 of 
the initial treatment.
Rational:
Children with venous thrombosis are often referred by  [CONTACT_105831]. The original time 
window limited randomization to day  1-5. Therefore, children referred on days [ADDRESS_117455] started study  medication on day  6-9 as 
required b y the stud y protocol. The extension of the time window for randomization from day  
1-5 to day  1-9 will therefore potentially  increase the number of children who can be 
considered for the stud y without changing the start day  of study  medication.

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 4: Addition of information for switch from VKA to 
rivaroxaban
Children who were randomized to rivaroxaban and in whom VKA therap y was alread y 
initiated before randomization, VKA therap y should be stopped and the switch to rivaroxaban 
should be made as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Rational:
This mo dification clarifies the procedure for children randomized to rivaroxaban, who have 
alread y started VKA therapy prior to randomization.
Affected sections:Synopsis; Section 3   Study design
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 5: Update of exclusion criterion 1
In exclusi on criterion 1 “high risk for bleeding contraindicating anticoagulant therap y” was 
modified to read “ bleeding risk contraindicating anticoagulant therap y”.
Rational:The modified wording specifies that patients should be excluded from the study  if an y 
bleeding risk contraindicates anticoagulant therapy. 
Affected section:Synopsis, Section 4.3  Exclusion criteria
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 6 : Clarification of exclusion criterion 5
In exclusion criterion 5 it was clarified that children with sustained uncontrolled hy pertension 
should be excluded from the study .
Rational:The modification clarifies, that children with an antihy pertensive therap y leading to normal 
blood pressure values (i.e. < 95th percentile) are allowed to be enrolled in the study . In 
Clinical Study  Protocol
No.  BAY 59 -7939/[ZIP_CODE]
27 SEP 2017 Version 5.0 Page: 81of 167
addition, it is clarified, that children should only  be exclu ded from the study , if there is a 
sustained increase of blood pressure with continued measurement of values bey ond the 95th 
age percentile. Individual blood pressure value(s) bey ond the 95th percentile do not require 
exclusion of a child. 
Affected sectio n:
Synopsis; Section 4.3  Exclusion criteria
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 7: Clarificatio n ofconcomitant med ication in exclusion 
criteria 7 and 8
The modification indicates that the drug s listed are considered strong inhibitors of both 
CYP3A4 and P -gp, and of strong inducers of CYP3A4, respectively , but that the lists are not 
limited to the drugs mentioned.Rational:
Additional drugs with these properties may  become available. Therefore, it is indicated that 
the lists provided may  not be exhaustive.
Affected section:Synopsis; Section 4.3  Exclusion criteria ; Section 4.4  Concomitant medication
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 8: Addition of body weight assessment at Visits 2 and 3
The collection of body weight was added for Visits 2 and 3.
Rational e:
The body weight will be obtained additionally  at Visit 2 and 3 to assess if an adjustment of 
the rivaroxaban dose is required for the child.Affected section:

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 9: Addition of post-thrombotic syndrome assessment 
The assessment of the incidence of post -thrombotic sy ndrom e was added for children of 
≥12years with lower or upper extremity DVT at Visit 4, 5, 6 and 7.
Rationale:
Post-thrombotic sy ndrome is an important sequelae of deep v ein thr ombosis. Therefore, the 
exploratory  assessment of the incidence of post- thrombotic sy ndrome will be included using 
the Villalta Score in children 12 y ears and older with DVT of the lower or upper extremity  at 
month 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 10: Age range for assessment of oral suspension Taste-
and- Texture
The upper range for children completing the Taste- and Texture questionnaire was changed 
from <12 to < 18 years.
Rationale:The oral suspension will be made available to children of all age groups, including 
adolescents. Therefore, the Taste -and Texture questionnaire will need to be completed by  
[CONTACT_105832] 4 to less than 18 years.
Affected section:
Synopsis; Section 7.5  Efficacy  anal ysis
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 11: Introduction of additional supplies for preparation 
and administration of oral suspension

[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 12: Start of enrollment in cohorts 6 months to less t han 2 
years and 2 to less than 6 years
The age cohorts 6 months to less than 2 y ears and 2 to less than 6 y ears were opened. In this 
context, the structure of age cohort specific dosing and regiment instructions was resolved and 
replaced b y a consistent de scription applicable for children aged 6 months to less than 18 
years. In addition, a single dosing table was included, that provides the body  weight 
dependent dosing and regimen (o.d. vs. b.i.d) irrespective of the formulation used (tablet, oral suspension) applicable for all age groups.
Rationale:
Opening of the age cohorts 6 months to less than 2 y ears and 2 to less than 6 years was 
anticipated in the original protocol. After review of phase II data from study [ZIP_CODE], the DMC 
recommended opening the two age cohorts.
Amendment 8 introduces a single consistent body  weight adjusted dosing schedule/regimen 
for children aged 6 months to < [ADDRESS_117456] growth charts 
(with some variability , excluding extreme obesity).

Amendment 8 introduced a single consistent body  weight adjusted dosing schedule/regimen 
for children aged 6 months to < 18 y ears ( see Table 4; dosing table available for children with 
a body  weight of ≥ 12 kg ). Age dependency  is implicitly  considered in this table as certain 
body  weights are connected (throug h standard growth charts) with certain ages (with some 
variability , excluding extreme obesit y) as well as with anatomical and ph ysiological 
differences that affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)
processes at different ages.

7.9.10 Adverse events related to devices used for preparation and administration of 
rivaroxaban oral suspension
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Incident
An “ Incident” is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and / or performance 
of a device, as well as any  inadequacy  in the lab eling or the instructions for use which, 
directly  or indirectl y, led, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient, or user or 
of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health.
Any event which meets all three basic repor ting criteria (A, B and C) is considered an
“Incident” . The criteria are as follows:
A)An adverse device event has occurred. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_105771]:
Malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or perform ance, or
Degradation / destruction of the device, or 
Clinical Study  Protocol
No.  BAY 59 -7939/[ZIP_CODE]
27 SEP 2017 Version 5.0 Page: 113of 167
Inappropriate therap y (e.g., underdosing or overdosing) .
B)The device is suspected to be a contributory  cause of the “Incident” .
C)The event led, or might have led, to death or serious deterioration in state of
health of a patient, or user, or other person.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Other Reportable Incident
An“Other Reportable Incident” is any  incident that did not lead to death or serious 
deterioration in health, but it might do if it occurred again under less fortunate circumstances 
or without intervention of healthcare personnel. This may  include cases without any  medical 
event reporte d. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Other Event 
An“Other Event” is any device related case that does not fulfill all the three basic “ Incident ” 
criteria A -C listed in the definition of an “ Incident ” above. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_117478] Technical Complaint (PTC)
A PTC is any  report rec eived (written, electronic or verbal communication) about a potential 
or alleged failure of a product in its quality  (including the identit y, durability, reliability, 
safet y, efficacy  or performance) or suspect counterfeit. The complaint may  or may  not 
represent a potential risk to the patient. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Device Malfunction or Failure and Medical Device Reporting
Any device complaint, malfunction, or failure including use errors will be recorded by  [CONTACT_105819]/investigational site, including all relevant de vice information using the clinical 
investigations device complaint form, and forwarded within 24 hours to the sponsor or 
sponsor’s designee for evaluation and investigation, regardless of whether or not a medical 
event was associated with the device malfu nction or failure.  
There are three different situations, in which a medical device complaint form might need to 
be filled out by  [CONTACT_093]:
a)When an AE is recorded, the investigator needs to check if a device
malfunction or failure might be associa ted with the recorded AE.
b)When a device malfunction or device failure occurs, the investigator
needs to assess whether an AE might have occurred in relation to the
device.
c)When a device malfunction, device failure, or use error occurs, without any associated 
AE, this also needs to be captured in the form and immediatel y forwarded to the 
sponsor for investigation.
The details of the malfunction and medical circumstances will be captured on a Device 
Complaint Form filled out by  [CONTACT_105835]’s 
designee. The final determination of reportability  is made by  [CONTACT_105821]/investigational site based on the medical circumstances surrounding the event.

All investigators will be instructed and trained on all relevant aspects of the investigator’s 
reporting obligations for device incidents and serious public health threats.  This information, 
including all relevant contact [CONTACT_8972], is summarized in the investig ator site file. This 
information will be updated as needed.
The manufacturer will inform the sponsor about necessary  trend reports and will provide the 
required documentation after completing the respective investigation and statistical anal ysis. 
The spons or will then notify  the authorities of any  trend reports according to all applicable 
regulations.
All devices that have malfunctioned or failed will be collected and returned to the sponsor or 
sponsor’s designee. Malfunctioned or failed devices should be:
provided with a failure description („What went wrong“), 
free of sources for contamination such as drug residues, 
clearl y marked as already used at patients and shall include corresponding warning 
symbols on packaging.

16.3.1 Overview of changes
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 1: Addition of Visit 1a for rivaroxaban PK assessment 
A visit was added to be scheduled 2+1 day s after start of rivaroxaban treatment for children 
treated according to a t.i.d. regimen. 
Rationale: Amendment 10 introduced dosing information and a new three times daily  dosing 
schedule for children with body  weight between 6 and <12 kg. This new dosing regimen is 
based on an exploratory  PopPK model, that considers all rivaroxaban PK data available from 
children below 2 years dosed in our phase I and phase II studies. As less data are available for 
younger children (e.g., due to sparse sampling), the model predictions have a higher level of 
uncertaint y for children with lower bod y weight. The Steering Committee therefore 
recommended to evaluate PK around the expected C maxand at C trough as soon as the stead y 
state is achieved (day  2+1 after start of rivaroxaban treatment; Visit 1a). 
The PK samples obtained at Visit 1a will be shipped and analy zed for each child individually  
and will allow to determine whether the plasma concentrations are in the adult reference 
range. The results will be provided to the investigator/site and discussed in a timely  manner, 
i.e. within approximately  1 to 2 weeks after sample collection. 
Affected sections: Synopsis ; Section 6.2 Visit 1 - Randomization Visit ; Section 6.3 Visit 1a 
(2+1 day s after start t.i.d. rivaroxaban)
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 2: Addition of dosing regimen for children with body 
weight between 6 and less than 12 kg
The dosing table was extended and now includes dosing information for children with body  
weight of 6 kg to 12 kg . Children with body  weight between 6 and less than 12 kg will be 
treated according to a three times daily  (t.i.d.)schedule with a time interval of approximatel y 
8 hours between individual doses.
Rationale: The dosing in children in general is aiming to target the adult exposure. Exposure 
was investigated in phase I  and phase II studies and an attempt was made to provide a better 
match from one stud y to the next. The result from phase I and phase II studies have 
demonstrated that in children with bod y weight below 12 kg, plasma concentrations after 10 
to 12 hours were lower than expected, indicating that the clearance is higher than expected in 
these children. No signals of an impaired safet y or efficacy profile was obtained in phase II 
studies. An exploratory  PopPK model was establi shed for children below 2 y ears to establish the 
dosing regimen. This model suggests that children with a body  weight below 12 kg require
three times dail y dosing to provide C
through values in the adult reference range.

27 SEP 2017 Version 5.0 Page: 119of 167
The Steering Committee agreed to the extension of the dosing regimen for children with body  
weight from 6 kg and less than 12 kg based on these model predictions. 
Affected sections: Synopsis ; Section 3. Study  design; Section 5.1.1 Rivaroxaban group ; 
Section 6.2 Visit 1 - Randomization Visit ; Section 6.3 Visit 1a (2+1 days after start t.i.d. 
rivaroxaban) ; Section 6.4 Visit 2 at Day  30 (± 7 day s); Section 6.5 Visit 3 at Day  60 (± 7 
days); Section 6.6 Visit 4 at Day  90 (± 7 day s); Section 6.14 PK/PD assessments
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 3: Correction of erroneous description for major 
protocol deviation documentation
The document for collection of protocol deviations was corrected to “ approved final list of 
important deviations, validity  findings and assignment to analy sis set(s) ”.
Rationale: The protocol erroneousl y described that protocol deviations will be collected in the 
SAP. This information had to be corrected to refer to the approved fin al list of important 
deviations, validity  findings and assignment to analy sis set(s).

This section wa s changed bas ed on modification 2.
New text:
[…]Children with body  weight of ≥ 30 kg will be treated according to a once daily  (o.d.) regimen, 
irrespective of whether they  receive rivaroxaban tablets or oral suspension. Children with 
body  weight between 12 and <30 kg will receive rivaroxaban twice daily  (b.i.d) with a dosing 
intervals of approximately 12 hours. Children with body  weight below 12 kg will receive 
rivaroxaban three times daily  (t.i.d.) with dosing interval of approximately  8 hours.
Dosing regimen, including dosing frequency , will be adjusted if the child’s body  weight 
changes during the stud y (Table 4). 
With a once daily  regimen, rivaroxaban will be taken in the morning during or within [ADDRESS_117491] and the evening dose will be taken during or within 2 hours after dinner.

during or within 2 hours after feeding.
Each rivaroxaban dose should be immediately  followed by  [CONTACT_105799][INVESTIGATOR_105758] 240 mL  of liquid (o.d. or b.i.d regimen) or 120mL  (t.i.d. regimen) . This volume will 
depend on age and may range from for example 20 mL in children aged 6 months up to 240

If rivaroxaban is taken with a t.i.d. regimen, the t.i.d. administration schedule with 
approximately  8-hour intervals should be resumed at the next scheduled dose without 
compensating for the missed dose.

16.4 Amendment 12
Amendment 12is the fourth global amendment dated 27 SEP 2017.
16.4.1 Overview of changes
[IP_ADDRESS] Modification 1: Introducing new dosing information for children with 
body w eight betw een 2.6 and <6 kg, and inclusion of children aged 
birth to 6 months
Rationale: Amendment 12 introduced new dosing information for children with body  weight 
between 2.6 and <6 kg. This new dosing regimen is based on data from all studies in children 
younger than 2 y ears, as well as an exploratory  PopPK model, that considers all rivaroxaban 
PK data available from all children y ounger than 2 y ears. As the exploratory  model is based 
on limited data (e.g., limited number of subjects, sparse sampling), the model predictions had 
a higher level of uncertainty for these children. However, observed data from this study  
([ZIP_CODE]) and data from the phase I/II stud y ([ZIP_CODE]) that is enrolling child ren aged < 6 months 
(including those 2.6 and <6 kg), have confirmed the predictions from the exploratory  PopPK 
model in all children dosed t.i.d thus far in both studies.  Therefore, the Steering Committee with concurrence from the DMC recommended dosing f or children < 6 kg.  
This additional dosing information facilitates enrollment of children from birth to < 6 months. This age group was added to a revised cohort for children from birth to aged < 2 y ears.  A 
single cohort from birth to aged < 2 years gene rally shares common risk factors for 
thrombosis, distribution of thrombus (with catheter- related thrombosis predominating), a 
different standard of care treatment regimen (< 90 day s of treatment is common) and 
Clinical Study  Protocol

rivaroxaban treatment regimen (most will require t.i.d. dosing). Lastl y, to conform to 
treatment guidelines and clinical practice, a main study  treatment duration of 30 day s was 
added for those < 2 years with catheter -related thrombosis.

Amendment 12 opened enrollment to children aged birth to < 6 months and introduced dosing 
information for children with a body weight between 2.6 and 6 kg. This new dosing regimen 
is based on data from all studies in children y ounger than 2 y ears, as well as an exploratory  
PopPK model, that considers all rivaroxaban PK data available from all children y ounger than 
2 years. As the exploratory  model is based on limited data (e.g., limited number of subjects, 
sparse sampling), the model predictions had a higher level of uncertain ty for these children. 
However, observed data from this study  ([ZIP_CODE]) and data from the phase I/II study ([ZIP_CODE]) 
that is enrolling children of this weight category , have confirmed the predictions from the 
exploratory  PopPK model in all children dosed t.i.d thus far in both studies.

Children aged birth to < 18 y ears with confirmed acute venous thromboembolism who receive 
initial treatment with therapeutic dosages of unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular 
weight heparin (LMWH), or fonda parinux are potentially eligible for the study . Initial

treatment period of [ADDRESS_117532] which was obtained at baseline will be repeated, if clinically  
feasible . However, in children y ounger than 2 y ears with catheter- related thrombosis, the 
main study  treatment period is for a total of 1 month at which time the repeat imaging will 
be performed. 
In all children, except those aged < 2 y ears with catheter- related thrombosis, the decision is 
made to stop study  treatment at 3 months or to continue f or an additional 3 months. I n 
children who completed 6 months of treatment, the decision is made to stop study  treatment 
or to continue for an additional 3 months. Then, in children who completed 9 months of 
treatment, the decision is made to stop study  treatment or to continue for an additional 
3months.   In children < 2 y ears with catheter-related thrombosis, the decision is made to 
stop study  treatment at 1 month or to continue for an additional month.  Then, in children 
who completed 2 months of treatme nt, the decision is made to stop study  treatment or to 
continue for an additional month.
Regardless of the duration of study  treatment ( <3, 3, 6, 9 or 12 months), an additional [ADDRESS_117533] -treatment observational period will be completed for all children. After cessation

17.1 Appendix 1: Methods and measurements
Bioanalytics and pharmacokinetics
Rivaroxaban concentrations in plasma will be measured b y a validated high -performance 
liquid chromatograph y assay with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Quality control and 
calibration samples will be anal yzed concurrently with study  samples. The results of quality  
check samples will be reported t ogether with concentrations in unknown samples in the 
clinical study  report. Concentrations are calculated from the chromatographic raw data in 
accordance with current Bay er guidelines. Onl y values above the lower limit of quantification 
are used to deter mine pharmacokinetic parameters.
17.2 Appendix 2: Estimated glomerular filtration rate
Ifserum creatinine ( SCr)is measured with routine methods that have not been recalibrated to 
be traceable to isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) (e.g. the traditional J affé reaction), 
the eGFR should be obtained from the origin al Schwartz formula:[12]
eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = k * height (cm) / SCr (mg/dL) where k is proportionality  
constant:92
Where k is proportionality constant:
k = 0.33 in pre -term infants up to 1 y ear
k= 0.45 in full -term infants up to 1 y ear
k = 0.55 in children 1 year to 13 y ears
k = 0.55 in girls > 13 and < 18 y ears
k = 0.70 in boy s > 13 and < 18 y ears 
IfSCris measured by [CONTACT_105842], the updated Schwartz formula should be used to obtain the eGFR:[13]
eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 0.413 * height (cm) / SCrmg/dL 
The National Kidney Disease Education Program website
(http://www.nkdep.nih.gov/professionals/gfr_calculators/index.htm) offers electronic
calculators of eGFR in the pediatric population based on the updated Schwartz formula. SCr 
in micromoles per liter, the value should be multiplied by  88.4 (1 mg/dL = 88.4 umol/L).

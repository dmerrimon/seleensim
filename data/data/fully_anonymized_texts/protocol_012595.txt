6.7 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
All concomitant prescription medications taken during study participation will be recorded on the 
appropriate study -specific data form. For this protocol, a prescription medication is defined as a 
medication that can be prescribed only by a properly author ized/licensed clinician. Medications to be 
Electronic Stimulation for Muscle Toning and Circumferential Reduction  Version 2.[ADDRESS_578243] (ETE) and an Adverse Event (AE)  
An expected treatment effect is defined as any typi[INVESTIGATOR_453390] -effect of the study devices of mild 
to moderate severity and lasting u p to a typi[INVESTIGATOR_453391] . An adverse event is defined as any 
new medical problem, or exacerbation of an existing problem, experienced by a subject while enrolled 
in the study, whether it is considered device -related by [CONTACT_093].  All ETEs and AEs will be 
collected during the  conduct of this trial.   
 
7.1.2  Definition of Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Each adverse event should be assessed for its seriousness. The definition below should be used for this 
assessment. Please note that the term serious adverse event is not synonymous with a “severe” adverse 
event, which may be used to describe the intensity  of an event experienced by [CONTACT_423].  
An adverse event should be classified as serious if it meets any of the following criteria:  
a. Death  
Death was an outcome of the adverse event.  
b. Life-threatening  
The subject was at substantial risk of dying at the time of the adverse event or use or continued 
use of the device.  
c. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged)  
Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274358] a result of the adverse event.  
d. Disability or Permanent Damage  
The adverse event resulted in a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life 
functions, i.e., the adverse event resulted in a significant, persistent or permanent change, 
impairment, damage or disruption in the patient's body functio n/structure, physical 
activities and/or quality of life.  
e. Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect  
Exposure to a medical product prior to conception or during pregnancy may have resulted in an 
adverse outcome in the child.  
f. Required Intervention to Prevent Permanent Impairment or Damage (Devices)  
Medical or surgical intervention was necessary to preclude permanent impairment of a body 
function, or prevent permanent damage to a body structure, either situation suspected to 
be due to the use of a medical product.  
g. Other Serious (Important Medical Events)  
The event does not fit the other outcomes, but the event may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes.  
 
Non -serious adverse events are all events that do not meet the criteria for a “serious” adverse event.  
 
7.1.3  Definition of Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (Events)  
An unanticipated adverse device effect is defined as “any serious adverse effect on health or safety, or 
any life -threatening problem, or death caused by, or associated with, a device; if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in natu re, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan, 
Electronic Stimulation for Muscle Toning and Circumferential Reduction  Version 2.0  
 
       Page 22 of 35 
 or application (including supplementary application), or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.”  
 
7.[ADDRESS_578244], using the following classifications:  
1 = Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity  
2 = Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity  
3 = Severe  Inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
 
7.2.2  Relationship to the Investigational Device  
The investigator should assess the relationship of the adverse event to the investigational device. The 
relationship should be assessed using the categories presented in Table 2. 
 
TABLE 2: RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ADVERSE EVENTS AND INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE  
Definite  Definite relationship exists between the device/procedure and an adverse 
event  
Probably Related  A reasonable causal relationship between the device/procedure and an 
adverse event is more likely than not.  
Possibly Related  A reasonable relationship exists between the device/procedure and an adverse 
event, but the causal relationship is unclear or lacking.  
Not Likely Related  A temporal relationship exists between the device/procedure and an adverse 
event, but there is no reasonable causal relationship. For example, the adverse 
event occurs in a time frame, which makes a causal relationship to device 
treatment improbable.  
Unrelated  No relationship between treatment with the device/procedure and the 
adverse event exists.  
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_578245] of study devices of mild to moderate severity and lasting up to a typi[INVESTIGATOR_453392] . 
 
7.3 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT FOLLOW UP AND ASSESSMENT  
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during a study visit or 
upon review by a study monitor. All ETEs and AEs will be captured on the appropriate data form. 
Information to be collected includes event description, date of onset, clinician’s assessment of 
seriousness and severity, relationship to study device/treatment (assessed only by [CONTACT_453409]), actions taken, and date of event resolution. All AEs occurring while on 
study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All ETEs/AEs assessed as “not yet 
resolved” must continue to be followed via telephone contact, email or clinic visit every 7 days or sooner 
as per the physician’s direction until event resolution or stabilization or tissue resection.  
   
A pre -existing condition should not be reported as an adverse event unless there has been a substantial 
increase in severity or frequency of the problem that has not been attributed to natural history.  
 
Electronic Stimulation for Muscle Toning and Circumferential Reduction  Version 2.[ADDRESS_578246] all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is 
obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation or 
until tissue is resected. At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of 
ETEs/AEs/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or 
stabilization or tissue is resected.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_578247] study 
treatment/exposure or until event resolution.   
AEs will not be followed up after the final study visit as tissue will be resected at the abdominoplasty 
visit. AEs related to the abdominoplasty are outside the scope of this study and will not be reported.  
 
7.4.[ADDRESS_578248]’s study participation must be reported by [CONTACT_453410] 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Pregnancies and pregnancy follow -up 
should be reported on an Adverse Event form. Pregnanc y follow -up should describe the outcome of the 
pregnancy, including any voluntary or spontaneous discontinuation; details of the birth; the presence or 
absence of any congenital abnormalities, birth defects, maternal or newborn complications, and their 
relation to the device or treatment/exposure. Each pregnancy must be reported as a non -serious AE if 
the subject has received at least one study treatment/exposure.  The following criteria should be 
followed:  
Electronic Stimulation for Muscle Toning and Circumferential Reduction  Version 2.[ADDRESS_578249] becomes pregnant after the Baseline visit and all study treatments/test spot 
exposure have been completed, the subject should continue to be followed for the duration 
of the pregnancy.  
b. If a subject becomes pregnant after the Baseline visit but before any study treatments/test 
spot exposures, the subject should be exited from the study.  
c. If a subject becomes pregnant after the Baseline visit but before all study treatments/test 
spot exposures have been completed, additional study treatments/test spot exposures 
should be discontinued, and the subject should continue to be followed for th e duration of 
the pregnancy.  
 
7.4.[ADDRESS_578250]’s death, regardless of whether the death is related or 
unrelated to the investigational device. The investigator should attempt to determine, as conclusively as 
possible, whether the death is related to the device. The cause of death and the investigator’s discussion 
regarding whether the death was device -related should be des cribed in a written report. The 
investigator mush report death to the reviewing IRB according to the IRB regulations at the study site.

subjects who received complete study treatments and follow up visits will be included in the analysis.  
Electronic Stimulation for Muscle Toning and Circumferential Reduction  Version 2.0  
 
       Page 26 of 35 
  
9.2  ANALYSIS DATASETS  
The following analysis sets will be defined for the statistical analysis of this investigation:  
 
Safety Evaluation Set (SES)  
Subset of all subjects who received the investigational treatment.  
 
Full Analysis Set (FAS)  
Subset of subjects in SES that received complete treatments have primary effectiveness data available.    
 
Per Protocol Set (PPS)  
Subset of all subjects who received complete treatments and have completed the study without major 
protocol deviations.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_578251] may be used to determine if two sets of data are  
significantly different from one another. If p -value is below the level of statistical significance for  
effectiveness analyses (α = 0.05) for all tests of differences, then the null hypothesis is rejected in fa vor 
of the alternative hypothesis. Rejection of null hypotheses will  establish that:  
o The two -sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between the means excludes 
zero.  
o  The two means are statistically significantly different at the 5% level (P <0.05) two -
sided.  
Upon rejection of null hypotheses, further statistical test tools such as, Confidence Interval, and/or One -
way ANOVA and/or descriptive statistical tools may be used to determine the performance of the  
treatment.  
 
9.4 SAFETY ANALYSES  
The safety analysis will be done by [CONTACT_10407] (AE ), as well as  
analysis of immediate response reports by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_10377]/her  
observation/examination of the treated area. Appropriate Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA) code will be used to describe all spontaneously reported events or other study related  
adverse events.  
Summaries of spontaneously reported or other study related adverse events will be presented as:  
o Number (%) of subjects with any AE  
o  Number (%) of subjects with any serious adverse events (SAE)  
o  Number (%) of subjects permanently withdrawn from treatment due to AE  
 
Summaries of analysis of immediate response reports by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_453393] a bar or pie chart and/or a table as;  
a. The overall frequency of subjects with each event (pain during treatment, hemorrhage,  
burn, erythema, edema, purpura, etc.) . 
b. Frequency of subjects with specific severity/intensity for each event using a 5 -
point scale: 1=none; 2=trace; 3=moderate; 4=marked; 5=severe . 
Electronic Stimulation for Muscle Toning and Circumferential Reduction  Version 2.0  
 
       Page 27 of 35 
 c. The overall proportion of subjects observed with marked or severe intensity of any  
event will be calculated and compared to those with none, trace or moderate  
severity/intensity . 
 
9.6 BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  
Subjects ’ baseline demographics will be compared using descriptive statistics such as mean score,  
standard deviation, standard error and range. Data will be displayed in tables or graphical presentation.  
 
9.7 ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY ENDPOINTS  
The following will be considered for the analysis of primary endpoints:  
The results of each Blinded Reviewer’s evaluation of photographs taken at 1 month and 3 months 
compared to  baseline will be analyzed,  and the results will be reported as a % of the correctly identified 
post treatment  photographs chosen per Blinded Reviewer. An average of the % of the correctly 
identified post treatment  photographs chosen by [CONTACT_453412], pie charts or graphs indicating percentages of the correctly identified post treatment photographs  
chosen by [CONTACT_453413].  
 
The % of the correctly identified post treatment photographs chosen by [CONTACT_453414] s with the investigational device and for whom all valid post -baseline  
assessment was obtained will be analyzed  for these primary endpoints. Multiple imputation method or  
modelling of available data may be used for missing data as appropriate.  
 
9.8 ANALYSIS OF SECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
For the analysis of changes in muscle tone and muscle strength , circumference of the extremities and 
subjects’ assessment of satisfaction with the treatment secondary endpoints, the following analysis will 
be considered:  
 
Summary tables of changes in measurements  of muscle tone and strength , circumference and subjects’ 
assessment of satisfaction at [ADDRESS_578252] error.  
 
Bar charts, pie chart, graphs or any other descriptive statistical displays indicating scores, percentages  
and/or proportions of changes in circumference and subjects’ assessment of satisfaction at [ADDRESS_578253] -treatment as compared to baseline will be used where applicable to analyze  efficacy.  
 
All statistical tests that will be two -sided. The level of statistical significance for effectiveness analyses is  
5% (α = 0.05) for all tests of differences. Where appropriate, two -proportion z -test will be used to 
compare  the differences between changes in abdominal circumference and subjects’ assessment of 
satisfaction at1 month and [ADDRESS_578254] treatment as compared to baseline.  
 
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) may also be used where appropriate. Change  in abdominal 
circumference and subjects’ assessment of satisfaction assessments at twelve weeks post -treatment as 
compared to baseline of all  subjects who received all treatment s with the investigational  device and for 
whom have all  valid post -baseline assessment was obtained will be analyzed  for these secondary

12.5  PUBLICATION AND DATA SHARING POLICY  
The data produced by [CONTACT_453423]‐sponsored study is the sole property of Lutronic.  Thereby, 
abstracts, publications and presentations of this data must be pre‐approved by [CONTACT_453424] (e‐
mail approval is acceptable).  The Sponsor must also be provided with the opportunity  to review all 
investigator‐prepared abstracts, publications or presentations.  A period of thirty (30) days for 
presentational materials and abstracts and forty‐five (45) days for manuscripts will be required for 
review and comment by [CONTACT_2728]’s Clinical R esearch Department. These requirements acknowledge 
Sponsor's responsibility to evaluate such publications for their accuracy, to ascertain whether 
Confidential Information is being inappropriately released, to provide the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_453394]/her, and to provide input from co‐authors 
regarding content and conclusions of the publication or presentation.    If requested in writing by [CONTACT_429], the Institution will withhold publication to prote ct the potential patentability of any invention 
described therein and/or made available to fulfill regulatory requirements.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, Institution agrees that if the Study is part of a multi‐center study, the first publication of the 
results of the Study shall be made in conjunction with the results from the investigators at the other 
study centers as a mult i‐center publication.  
13. STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
13.[ADDRESS_578267] be 
reported to the Sponsor and the reviewing IRB as soon as possible, but no later than five working days 
after the emergency occurred.  
 Any permanent change to the protocol, whether it is an overall change or a change for specific study 
center(s), must be handled as a protocol amendment. Any amendment to the protocol that appears 
indicated as the study progresses will be fully discussed b y the investigator(s) and the Sponsor. If 
agreement is reached regarding the need for an amendment, the Sponsor will write it. The written 
amendment must be submitted to the chairman of the IRB identified with this responsibility. Except for 
“administrativ e amendments”, investigators must await IRB approval of protocol amendments before 
implementing the change(s). Administrative amendments are defined to have no effect on the validity of 
the data or information resulting from the completion of the approved protocol, or the relationship of 
likely patient risk to benefit relied upon to approve the protocol; the scientific soundness of the 
investigational plan or protocol; and the right, safety or welfare of the human subjects involved in the 
investigation.

 When, in judgment of the chairman of the IRB, the investigators and/or the Sponsor, the amendment to 
the protocol substantially alters the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the subject, the 
currently approved written Informed Consent Form  will require similar modification. In such cases, 
repeat informed consent will be obtained from subjects enrolled in the study before continued 
participation.

2) To assess neutrophil engraftment with eltrombopag in this  population  
3) To characterize immune  reconstitution  
4) To assess overall survival  (OS)  
5) To assess progression free survival  (PFS)  
6) To assess incidence of acute graft -versus -host disease  (GVHD)  
 
 
2.0 Background  
 
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the preferred choice for many b enign 
and malignant hematological diseases.[1] Unfortunately, only 30% of subjects have a 
matching family donor. Matching unrelated donor is available for another 50% of 
Caucasians, but a significantly lower proportion of non -Caucasian subjects are matched  
after a median time of [ADDRESS_1099151] blood transplantation (CBT) and haploidentical bone marrow transplantation 
are potential alternative for these  subjects.[2] 
 
Cord Blood Transplantation a nd Haploidentical Transplantation  
Cord blood transplantation and haploidentical donor transplantation are effective 
alternatives for patients who do not have a suitable matching donor. Results of these 
treatment modalities are slowly improving and in many instances are similar to those 
obtained with matching donors.[2-4] However, there is still a need to further improve 
outcomes with these modalities.  
 
Both engraftment[5] and immune reconstitution[6] are delayed in subjects undergoing CBT and 
haploidentical  transplantation compared with matched donors. This results in higher 
incidence of infections, which increase morbidity and mortality.[7] Engraftment data from 
various graft sources are summarized below in table 1.

Version 18.0  24 November 2020  Page 4 of 20 
 Poor engraftment and poor immune reconstitution results in hi gher treatment related 
mortality. In a study of 742 subjects who had received myeloablative therapy and a single 
CB unit in North America or Europe through 2005, the 100 -day treatment -related mortality 
rate was 44%.[11] In an attempt to improve engraftment  and hence morbidity and mortality, 
investigators have combined two units of cord blood and infused them as allogeneic 
hematopoietic support improving engraftment by [CONTACT_534671], but it still remains 
significantly inferior to transplant from fully matched  donor.[9,12,13] 
 
Likewise  platelet  engraftment  is delayed  occurring  at a median  of 28 days  (0-395 days)  in 
patients  undergoing  haploidentical  transplantation using T replete marrow graft with post -
transplant cyclophosphamide.[10] This is likely due to use  of bone marrow as a graft source 
and use of cyclophosphamide after transplant, which results in significantly delayed 
engraftment. A major cause of mortality in these patients is infection resulting from poor 
immune reconstitution.[2,7,14] Further effort at improving engraftment and immune 
reconstitution is clearly needed.  
 
At MD Anderson Cancer Center, we have previously reported engraftment data in a 
smaller number of patients in both of these groups.[15- 18] In order to get detailed data for 
engraftment  in a larger number of patients and to serve as a baseline for this proposal, we 
reviewed our historic platelet engraftment data in these two groups of patients and they 
are summarized in Table 2.  
 
Table [ADDRESS_1099152] blood (n=91)  Haploidentical Donor (n=54)  
Time to platelet >20K 
Median (range) days  43 (0 -126) 29 (0 -59) 
At Day 30 proportion of 
patients with    
Platelet >20K  19% 61% 
Platelet >50K  2% 20% 
At Day 60 proportion of 
patients with    
Platelet >20K  60% 88% 
Platelet >50K  44% 63% 
 
 
Hence at Day 30 aft er transplant only 2% (2/91) of patients receiving cord blood and only 
20% (11/54) of patients receiving haploidentical graft achieved platelet count greater than 
50,000/µl. We wish to improve these results in the current study.  
 
Rationale for eligibility criteria and study design  
We would like to include as many patients as possible therefore all patients receiving cord 
blood or haploidentical transplant treated on any protocol will be eligible for this study. 
Following exceptions are made for safety conce rns. 
 
a) Patients with liver dysfunction are excluded from this study because the drug 
exposure is higher in patients with severe liver dysfunction and modest hepatic toxicity 
was observed in few patients in previous clinical trials of this drug. Likewise pat ients 
with renal dysfunction are excluded as limited data are available in the setting of kidney  
failure.  
Version 18.0  24 November 2020  Page 5 of 20 
  
b) East Asians (Chinese, Korean, and Japanese) have 87% higher drug exposure 
as determined by [CONTACT_796866] -east Asians( see investigator’s brochure) and  therefore 
they may require a lower dose and a dose of 300mg may not be safe. Furthermore, at 
the most we are likely to see only one or at the most two patients if any of these ethnic 
groups during the course of this study, so doing a separate lower dose c ohort for these 
groups is not realistic. Hence, it will be safer to exclude them. We will exclude patients 
whose one parent or grandparent is of Chinese, Korean, or Japanese  origin.  
 
Correlative Studies  
Thrombopoietin acts on early stem cells and progenito r cells. Eltrombopag was shown to 
increase not only platelets but also white cells and hemoglobin. It is possible that it may 
impact recovery of immune system after transplant.[19,43,45] We will therefore do immune 
reconstitution studies, which include enu meration of various lymphocyte subsets (T cells and 
subsets, B cells, NK cells, etc.) at various time points after transplant and compare it to 
historical control to assess impact of Eltrombopag on immune recovery.  
 
 
3.0 Background Drug  Information  
 
Thrombopoiet in 
Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the primary regulator of platelet production and is required for 
proliferation and differentiation of its precursors.[19,20] It was identified as a ligand for c -mpl 
receptor, a previously identified oncogene.[21-24] Mice deficien t in this protein or its receptor 
produce 10 -15% of normal platelet mass. It is a polypeptide of 353 amino acids mainly 
produced in liver. It is cleared by [CONTACT_796867]. The production 
occurs at a fixed rate and the plasma levels are t herefore determined by  
[CONTACT_796868] 
(e.g., aplastic anemia).[19,20] With the discovery of thrombopoietin, the next step was 
development of recombinant molecule and its use in thromb ocytopenic disorders.  
 
Thrombopoietic Growth Factors: First Generation Agents  
Recombinant thrombopoietin (rTPO) and Megakaryocyte growth and development factor 
(MGDF) were developed and studied in the late nineties.[25-30] rTPO is the intact glycosylated 
molecule while MDGF is the truncated molecule. Both were studied in patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_796857]. They were also effective in increasing pla telet count 
in small number of patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) and increasing 
stem cell yield when given with chemotherapy given for stem cell mobilization. However, in 
patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy for acute myeloid le ukemia or for conditioning 
prior to stem cell transplantation, these agents did not reduce the nadir platelet count, time 
to platelet recovery to 20,000/µl, or platelet transfusion requirement,[25,27,29 -35] but did cause 
marked thrombocytosis following pla telet recovery. This lack of efficacy could be attributed 
first to paucity of megakaryocytic precursors early post high dose chemotherapy, which are 
the targets for the drug. Second, the peak effect of these agents is seen at [ADDRESS_1099153] blood or 
haploidentical transplantation or those with secondary thrombocytopenia.  
 
Version 18.0  24 November 2020  Page 6 of 20 
 Unfortunately development of these molecules was discontinued because patients 
receiving MDGF dev eloped antibody to thrombopoietin that reacted with the native 
molecule resulting in thrombocytopenia in normal donors.[36,37] This then led to a search for 
a novel molecule, which stimulates thrombopoiesis through its action on thrombopoietin 
receptor and  does not stimulate antibody production by [CONTACT_796869]. 
Eltrombopag is one such small molecule.  
 
Eltrombopa g 
 
Mechanism of Action  
Eltrombopag (Appendix C: Investigator’s Brochure) is a nonpeptide small molecule that 
stimulates thrombopo iesis by [CONTACT_346384]. It binds to TPO receptors near the 
transmembrane domain at a site different from the binding site of native TPO. Like TPO it 
activates Jak Stat and MAP kinase signal transduction pathways, but unlike TPO it does 
not activa te AKT pathway. This may account for some of the similarities and differences 
between two molecules. It stimulates proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytic 
precursors including early committed progenitors. Unlike TPO it does not cause activation  
of platelets. It also does not stimulate proliferation of different tumor cell lines. It is active 
only in humans and chimpanzees.[38] 
 
Pharmacology  
Clinical pharmacology of eltrombopag has been evaluated in more than 500 subjects 
receiving doses ranging from 3mg to 300mgs. Data are detailed in the investigator’s 
brochure (Appendix C) and are summarized here. It is well absorbed orally with a linear 
dose dependent rise in pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. Its half life is [ADDRESS_1099154] pharmacokinetics of eltrombopag, while d rug exposure is 
increased 80 -93% in patients with liver dysfunction. In this study we will exclude patients 
with significant liver dysfunction.  
 
Efficacy  
Eltrombopag received accelerated approval from the FDA on November 20, 2008 for the 
treatment of chron ic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) and subsequently for 
thrombocytopenia in hepatitis C patients. In clinical trials, it has been shown to increase 
platelet counts in patients with ITP not responsive to standard therapy and in patients with 
cirrhosis due to hepatitis C and thrombocytopenia.[39-42] In a randomized placebo controlled 
trial in patients with ITP, 59% eltrombopag patients and 16% placebo patients responded 
achieving a platelet count >/= 50,000 per µL with an odds ratio of 9.61 (95% CI 3.31-27.86; 
p<0.0001).  
 
In patients with thrombocytopenia (platelet count between 20,000 and 70,000 per µL) and 
cirrhosis due to hepatitis C, at week 4, platelet count increased to > 100,000 per µL in 0%, 
75%, 79%, and 95% of patients treated with placebo,  30mg, 50mg, and 75mg of 
eltrombopag respectively. Antiviral therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin was initiated at 
week 5 and eltrombopag or placebo was continued. After twelve weeks, antiviral therapy 
was completed by 6%, 36%, 53%, and 65% of patients  receiving placebo, 30mg, 50mg, 
and 75mg of eltrombopag.  
 
 
Version 18.0  24 November 2020  Page 7 of 20 
 Hence, eltrombopag is effective for treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with ITP and 
patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C (HCV). Further studies are currently underway in 
patients with t hrombocytopenia post chemotherapy, and it is certainly promising for 
accelerating engraftment post cord or haploidentical transplantation.  
 
Thrombopoietin not only promotes growth and development of platelet progenitor and 
megakaryocytes, but also promotes  growth of all hematopoietic progenitors including 
hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitor cells.[19] It therefore may follow that 
eltrombopag may have effect on other hematopoietic lineages in addition to megakaryocytic 
lineage. Mice lacking t hrombopoietin receptor (c -mpl) have stem cell deficiency.[43] 
Furthermore, humans with congenital deficiency of this receptor also develop pancytopenia 
and aplastic  anemia.[44] In fact the role of thrombopoietin receptor agonist in expansion of 
early hemat opoietic progenitors including stem cells was very elegantly shown in a recent 
study of patients with refractory aplastic anemia conducted at NIH. In this study with 
eltrombopag a 41% hematologic response was seen with improvement in all 3 lineages.[45] 
 
A similar acquired trilineage hypoplasia or a bone marrow failure state exists in patients 
undergoing transplantation due to chemotherapy or radiotherapy give as a part of 
conditioning regimen. The regeneration of normal mature blood cells occurs due to inf used 
stem cells. It therefore follows that when recovery of blood cells is impaired as detailed 
above in cord or haploidentical transplant, a growth factor like eltrombopag may significantly 
improve engraftment and immune reconstitution and thereby [CONTACT_796870]. In 
this study we hypothesize that eltrombopag will not only improve platelet recovery acting on 
megakaryocytic lineage, but also improve immune recovery acting on very early progenitors.  
 
Toxicity  
In clinical studies, eltrombopag was well  tolerated with modest toxicity, which are detailed in 
the enclosed “Investigator’s Brochure” and summarized here. More than [ADDRESS_1099155] 
been treated on various clinical efficacy studies with doses of eltrombopag ranging from 3 
mg to 300 mg given fo r 1- 560 days. In placebo controlled ITP studies, only nausea and 
vomiting occurred more frequently (>5%) in eltrombopag treated subjects than placebo. 
These were mild and resolved without treatment. No significant difference between the two 
groups was see n in the incidence of other adverse events or serious adverse events. Mild, 
reversible, abnormalities of liver function tests (AST, ALT, ALP, and Bilirubin) were noted 
(10% eltrombopag vs 7% placebo) in ITP studies but were infrequently seen in HCV studies  
and chemotherapy related thrombocytopenia studies. Increase in reticulin and collagen in 
bone marrow biopsy was seen in some subjects but was not clinically relevant.[46,47] Likewise 
no difference in cataract incidence was reported between patient and con trols.[48] No 
increase in incidence of malignancies was seen in patients receiving the drug. Transient 
decrease in platelet count following discontinuation of the drug was seen, but this was not 
associated with clinically meaningful bleeding events. In sum mary, eltrombopag is well 
tolerated without any major dose dependent adverse effects.  
 
Rationale for dose  
1. The effective dose in subjects with thrombocytopenia post stem cell transplantation is 
unknown, and 300 mg is the maximum dose that is currently being  considered in 
eltrombopag studies for patients with chemotherapy -induced thrombocytopenia, 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and advanced 
sarcoma. Four studies recently reported safety of this dose including one in patients 
undergoing stem cell  transplantation.[49-52] 
 
Version 18.0  24 November 2020  Page 8 of 20 
 2. In healthy subjects, a clear dose and exposure response was seen for eltrombopag 
doses of 10 mg to 200 mg once daily for 5 days, with geometric mean AUC values of 302 
µg.h/mL for the 200 mg once daily regimen. Eltrombopag was well tolerated in healthy 
subjects at all dose  levels.  
 
3. In ITP subjects, a dose response was seen for eltrombopag doses of 30 mg to 75 mg 
once daily, with geometric mean AUC values of 169 µg.h/mL for the 75 mg once daily 
regimen. There was no significant difference between the safety profile of ITP subjects 
receiving 30, 50 or 75 mg of  eltrombopag.  
 
4. In HCV subjects, a dose and exposure response was seen for eltrombopag doses of 
30 mg to 75 mg once daily, with geometric mean AUC values of 307  µg.h/mL for the 75 
mg once daily regimen (approximately [ADDRESS_1099156] 
dose safely used in other studies. We will therefore use this dose in current study.  
 
Rationale for Duration  
Thrombopoietin not only promotes growth and development of platelet progenitor and 
megakaryocytes, but also promotes growth of all hematopoietic progenitors including 
hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitor cells.[19] In this study we not only would 
like improve platelet engraftment but assess if it has any impact on recovery of other 
lineages and immune syst em. Therefore we would like to continue it for 60 days irrespective 
of platelet recovery unless the platelet count rises above 250 x  109/l.

eligible for this study. Following exceptions are made for safety concerns.  
 
a) Patients with live r dysfunction are excluded from this study because the drug 
exposure is higher in patients with severe liver dysfunction and modest hepatic toxicity

with renal dysfunc tion are excluded as limited data are available in the setting of kidney

b) East Asians (Chinese, Korean, and Japanese) have 87% higher drug exposure as 
determined by [CONTACT_796866] -east Asians and therefore they may require a lower dose 
and a dose of 300mg may not be safe. Furthermore, at the most we are likely to see 
only one or at the most two patients if any of these ethnic groups during the course of 
this study, so doing a separate lower dose cohort for these groups is not realistic. 
Version 18.0  24 November 2020  Page 9 of 20 
 Hence, it will  be safer to exclude  them.

or haploidentical donor stem cell transplantatio n treated with eltrombopag. We will use a 
dose of 300 mg/day for [ADDRESS_1099165] entered the haploidentical arm, the study was 
modified to allow for up to 20 additional patients (for a total of 50) in this arm. In January 
2016, the protoco l will be further modified to  allow  for up to 55 patients in the haploidentical 
arm. The protocol will still enter a maximum of 60 patients total. When registering patients 
in CORe, treatment arm assignment will be designated.  
Primary Endpoint: Sample Siz e Justification  
Historical data for cord blood transplants at MDACC indicates that approximately 44% of 
patients experienced platelet engraftment of > 50K/µl by [CONTACT_2006] 60. We expect to increase this 
to at least 71% in this trial with the addition of eltrombop ag. With [ADDRESS_1099166] 80% power to detect an increase to 71%, assuming a one -sided 
exact binomial test with a 5% Type I error rate. Only patients who complete treatment 
without missing the drug for more than [ADDRESS_1099167] that 80% of patients will be evaluable for the primary endpoint under these criteria. If 
we enroll more than [ADDRESS_1099168] this 
increase. As discussed above, we now (October 2015) expect fewer than [ADDRESS_1099169] the specified  
difference.  
 
For the haploident ical arm, historically at MDACC, approximately 63% of patients have 
experienced platelet engraftment of > 50K/µl by [CONTACT_2006]  
60. With [ADDRESS_1099170] 80% power to detect an increase in this proportion to 
88%, assuming a one -sided exact binomial test w ith a 5% Type I error rate. Only patients 
who complete treatment without missing the drug for more than [ADDRESS_1099171] that  80% of patients will be evaluable for the primary 
endpoint under these criteria. With a greater number of patients in this arm, we will have 
the same power to detect a smaller increase.  
Version 18.0  24 November 2020  Page 12 of 20 
 Each hypothesis will be tested with a 5% Type I error rate. We recogn ize that the 
overall Type I error rate of the study is 9.75%. Patients who experience graft failure or 
who do not take the study treatment for more than 10 days will be replaced.  
Safety Monitoring Rule: Grade 4 Non -Hematologic Toxicity  
We will monitor the rate of grade 4 and higher non -hematologic toxicity attributable to the 
drug through Day 60 in this trial by [CONTACT_796873], Simon, and Estey.[53] All 
patients who enter the study will be evaluable for toxicity. The following statistical monitor ing 
rule will be applied separately to each arm: discontinue the arm if at any time during the 
trial:

Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints in the trial include platelet engraftment > 20K/µl at Day 60, 
platelet engraftment > 20K/µl and > 50K/µl  at Day 30, neutrophil engraftment, the 
time to platelet and neutrophil engraftment, overall survival (OS), progression free 
survival (PFS), the cumulative incidence of acute and chronic graft vs. host 
disease (GVHD), and toxicity. Neutrophil engraftment i s defined as the first of three 
consecutive days that the ANC is > 0.5 k/ L. 
 
We will estimate the cumulative incidence of each of the engraftment 
parameter with death or relapse as a competing risk. Neutrophil and platelet 
engraftment will be recorded as per our departmental standard practice.  
 
For survival parameters, we will use the method of Kaplan and Meier to estimate the 
distribution of survival times, and we will compare distributions using the log -rank 
test. We will use Cox proportional hazards reg ression methods to model survival 
parameters as a function of disease and demographic covariates of interest. We will 
use the method of Gooley et al to estimate the cumulative incidence of GVHD.  We 
will use logistic regression to model the association bet ween engraftment endpoints 
and covariates of interest. Analyses will be performed separately by [INVESTIGATOR_216] (cord blood 
or haploidentical).  
 
We will provide descriptive summaries of toxicity by [CONTACT_796874].  
 
 
9.0  Adverse Events and Reporting  Requirements  
 
9.1 Grading assessment  
The severity of the adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to the Common 
Terminology Criteria v4.0 (CTCAE). A dverse events and protocol specific data will be 
entered into PDMS/CORe. PDMS/C ORE will be used as the electronic case report 
form for this protocol.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1099172] 
consequences as well as those events known to be related to drugs used for the 
treatment of GVHD, infections and supportive treatment will be scored as unrelated.  
When the relationship of the adverse event cannot be ruled out w ith certainty the AE may be 
considered possibly related . 
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_796864]. Documentation 
of grade, onset/resolution date and attribution will be entered into the patient's medical record 
and signed by [CONTACT_978].  
 
9.3 Collection of adverse  events  
 
Only those events known to be caused by [CONTACT_796875] (PDMS/CORE). Collection of adverse events will reflect the onset and 
resolution date and maximum grade.  Intermittent events should be labeled as such and 
followed until resolution. If a patient is taken off study while an event still ongoing, this will 
be followed until resolution unless another therapy is initiated.  
 
Events known to be caused by [CONTACT_796876], infections and supportive treatment will not be collected in the designated case 
report form/database. Concurrent me dications considered standard of care for transplant 
patients will not be captured in the case report form. They will be documented in the 
medical record.  
 
Adverse events related to the study drug will be collected and recorded for the duration of 
active t reatment plus [ADDRESS_1099173] of expected adverse events related to  Eltrombopag  
 
1. Thrombotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_796865].  
2. Allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; 
swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or  tongue);  
3. Abnormal liver function tests (possible liver damage -ascitis,  jaundice).  
4. New onset of bone marrow  fibrosis.  
5. Stroke symptoms (e.g., confusion, slurred speech, sudden vision changes, one -
sided  weakness).  
6. Muscle aches or pain (arms and/or  legs).  
7. Bleedin g problems after discontinuation of  treatment.  
 
9.5 Treatment Duration Definitions  
 
Active Treatment: the therapy administered to the participant as specified in the 
"Dosage and Administration" part of the proposal. Supportive care and standard 
forms of post -transplant immunosuppressive therapy are not considered active 
treatment.  
 
Last day of "Active Treatment": is the last day of the study intervention.  
Version 18.0  24 November 2020  Page 15 of 20 
  
Active Treatment Period: is the period of time from the first day of "Active Treatment" until 
30 days afte r the "Last day of Active Treatment" as specified above.  
 
Follow -up Period is the period of time that immediately follows the end of the "Active 
Treatment Period." This period ends when the patient is removed from the study.  
 
9.6 Reporting  Requirement  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE) Language  
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death
 A life -threatening adverse drug exp erience – any adverse experience that places 
the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, mig ht have caused  death.
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909] 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life  functions. 
 A congenital anomaly/birth  defect.
 
Important medi cal events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical o r surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not resul t in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR  
312.32).  
 
· Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious 
adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE  
if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_9476], IND  Office.  
 
· All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE 
must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures out lined in 
“The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy 
for Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”. Unless 
stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected  or unexpected,  must  be reported  to the 
IND Office,  regardless  of attribution  (within  5 working  days  of knowledge  of the event).  
 
· All life-threatening  or fatal events,  that are unexpected,  and related  to the study  drug,  
must  have  a written  report  submitted  within  
24 hours  (next working day) of knowledge of the event to the Safety Project Manager in the 
IND Office.  
 
· Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be 
utilized for safety reporting to the IND Office and MDACC  IRB. 
· Serious adverse events will  be captured from the time of the first protocol -
specific intervention, until [ADDRESS_1099174] be followed until 
clinical recovery is complete and laboratory tests ha ve returned to baseline, 
progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of 
the event.  
 
· Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_1099175] be report ed to the IND Office. This may 
include the development of a secondary  malignancy.  
 
Reporting to FDA:  
· Serious  adverse  events  will be forwarded  to FDA by [CONTACT_9533]  (Safety  Project  
Manager  IND Office)  according  to 21 CFR 312.32.  
 
It is the responsibilit y of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_97102], Good Clinical 
Practices, the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional 
Review Board policy.  
 
Reporting to N ovartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation:  
 
The institution and investigator shall report to [COMPANY_001] Pharmaceuticals Corporation within 
24 hours (next working day) of knowledge of the unexpected and related event: all life 
threatening or fatal events; and withi n five (5) working days of knowledge of the unexpected 
and related event any adverse drug experience, as defined by [CONTACT_65855], 
or pregnancy experienced by [CONTACT_796877] a [COMPANY_001] Pharmaceuticals 
Corporation study drug(s).

Protocol NX-[ZIP_CODE] 1. Background 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) affects an estimated 1.9 million people in the [LOCATION_002] (2014) with an 
estimated 586,[ADDRESS_1101174] of illicit prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_798392] $53-$[ADDRESS_1101175] in symptom management for 
OUD. In this study we provide mHealth-based exercises to individuals diagnosed and in treatment for 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_798393] (mobile healthcare) interventions for OUD. 
 
2. Protocol and Procedures

single-arm study of individuals in supervised treatment at the site of recruitment, under the care of 
an independent clinical provider.  
 
Participants in this study of the mHealth platform (see SAP for recruitment targets) will be invited to

minimal risk expected to participants in the study. 
 
In this study, participants are requested engage with mHealth platform interactions for the duration 
of the study period of at least [ADDRESS_1101177] commercial units. 
 
After completion of the final day of participation by [CONTACT_798395], full analysis of recorded data 
will be completed. During the study period, intervention feasibility will be assessed using measures of 
utilization, in addition to structured and open-ended user feedback. Primary outcome measures are  
user acceptability of the and secondarily for treatment-related effects of the mHealth application as

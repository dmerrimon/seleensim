Original Protocol   21-Dec-2017, version 1 (electronic 3.0)  
AMENDED PROTOCOL 03 (06-JAN-2021) 
This amended protocol 03 is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in 
Article  10 (a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union.  
OVERALL RATIONALE FO R THE AMENDMENT   
The main reasons for this protocol amendment are the following:  
• To enable changes in statistical analyses to reflect the sequential enrolment in the 
2 cohorts of patients defined by [CONTACT_361502] (see further details be low), since 
enrolment in the every 4 weeks (Q4W) cohort started when enrolment in the every 
2 weeks (Q2W) cohort was completed,  
• To include the possibility to perform remote monitoring in the context of regional or 
national emergency such as the current COV ID-19 pandemic, and  
• To clarify the flexibility that the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system allows 
during the open -label extension period with regard to the dose adjustment of alirocumab.  
This protocol amendment replaces the 2 primary efficacy hy potheses comparing each 
alirocumab  treatment regimen (Q2W, Q4W) versus a pooled placebo group combining Q2W and 
Q4W regimens by a comparison of each alirocumab group versus its contemporaneously 
randomized placebo group (ie , of the same dosing regimen coho rt).  
This change  is driven by a potential temporal bias introduced from sequentially randomizing 
patients into the first dosing regimen cohort (Q2W), followed by [CONTACT_361503] (Q4W). Two randomization schemes were produced for this stud y, with a distinct 
randomization scheme for each dosing regimen cohort. Therefore, patient background 
characteristics are expected to be equally distributed between treatment groups within a dosing 
regimen cohort by [CONTACT_361504] , but not necessarily between the 2 cohorts. Pooling 
placebo patients’  data from both dosing regimen cohorts could introduce a potential temporal bias 
that would not be balanced by a similar bias in each of the alirocumab cohort groups .  

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 03   06-Jan-2021  
EFC14643  - alirocumab   Version number: [ADDRESS_450284] cohort.  
As already defined in the amended protocol 2, the Bonferroni adjustment for multiplicity control 
will be applied to the primary efficacy endpoint to control the Type -I error, specifically, using a 
two-sided alpha level of 0.025 within each cohort treatment group comparison. Multiplicity 
testing of the key secondary endpoints will follow the amended protocol 2, specifically, the 
overall Type-I error will be controlled by [CONTACT_2224] a sequential inferential approach applied 
independently within each dosing regimen cohort (Q2W and Q4W). Statis tical significance of the 
primary parameter at the 0.[ADDRESS_450285] key secondary parameter, and so on for the remaining key 
secondary parameters within the coho rt (defined in Section  9.2.1 ). 
The Bonferroni adjustment and this fixed hierarchical approach will ensure a strong co ntrol of the 
overall Type-I error rate for the study at the 0.05 level. The current study sample size is sufficient 
to provide power >90% for testing treatment effect of the primary efficacy endpoint within each 
cohort at a [ADDRESS_450286] data pooling strategy follows, 
combining study treatment groups (alirocumab, placebo) regardless of regimen cohort. Po oling 
safety assessments across the cohorts aims at increas ing the chance to identify a safety signal .

To be consistent with the significance level that will 
be used for tests (2.5% two -sided), 97.5% CI will be 
computed instead of 95% CI.  Since two -sided test with a 
significance level of 2.5% will be

TITLE  A randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study followed by [CONTACT_361508]/TRIAL LOCATION  Worldwide  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT  Phase 3  
STUDY OBJECTIVE(S)  
 Primary objective : 
• To evaluate the efficacy of alirocumab administered every 
2 weeks (Q2W) and every 4 weeks (Q4W) versus placebo after 
24 weeks of double -blind (DB) treatment on low -density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) levels in patients with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH ) 8 to 
17 years of age on optimal stable daily dose of statin therapy  
 ± other lipid modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (LMTs) or a stable dose of 
non-statin LMTs in case of intolerance to statins.  
Secondary objectives:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of alirocumab versus placebo on 
LDL-C levels after 12 weeks of DB treatment.  
• To evaluate the effects of alirocumab versus placebo on othe r 
lipid parameters (eg, Apolipoprotein B [Apo B ], non -high density 
lipoprotein cholesterol [non -HDL-C], Total -cholesterol [Total -C], 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL -C], Lipoprotein [a] 
[Lp[a]], Triglycerides [TG s], Apolipoprotein A -1[Apo  A-1] levels) 
after 12 and 24 weeks of treatme nt.  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab after 
24 weeks of treatment in comparison with placebo.  
• To evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of alirocumab 
after 80  weeks of open label treatment.  
• To evaluate the development of anti -alirocumab antibodies after 
24 weeks of treatment during the double -blind (DB) treatment 
period.  
Other objectives:  
• To evaluate the development of anti -alirocumab antibodies after 
80 weeks of open label treatment.  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK ) of alirocumab.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 8 STUDY DESIGN  This study is a randomized, 24 -week DB, placebo -controlled, 
parallel -group, multi -national, multi -center study followed by [CONTACT_361509] 80 weeks. Approximately 150 children and 
adolescents aged of 8 to 17  years with heFH and LDL -C ≥130 mg/dL 
(3.37 mmol/L) at screening visit despi[INVESTIGATOR_361458] s will be randomized 
2:1 (alirocumab:placebo) . Two dosing regimen, Q2W and Q4W, will be 
evaluated with approximately 75 patients in each dosing regimen  cohort . 
The start of the recruitment in the Q4W dosing regimen cohort  will depend 
on the status of the recruitment in the Q2W dosing regimen cohort  and 
the sta tus of the amendment approval. Stable LMTs are defined as stable 
optimal dose of statin ± other stable LM Ts or stable dose of non-statin 
LMTs in statin  intolerant patients for at least 4  weeks prior to screening. 
The optimal dose of statin is defined as the dose prescribed based  on 
regional practice or local guidelines or is the dose that is maximally 
tolerat ed due to adverse effects of higher doses. For patients not 
receiving maximally tolerated statin, statin intensification should be 
carefully considered prior to randomiz ation in this study in order to ensure 
that the addition of a non -statin LDL -C lowering  therapy ( ie, alirocumab) 
would be the next appropriate step in the management of the patient’s 
hypercholesterolemia. The highest dose of statin should not exceed the 
maximum labeled dose of statin for pediatric patients as per the local 
prescribing inform ation. Statin  intolerant patient is defined as one with the 
inability to tolerate at least 2 statins: one statin at the lowest daily starting 
dose, and another statin at any dose, due to skeletal muscle -related 
symptoms, other than those due to strain or trauma, such as pain, aches, 
weakness, or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], that began or increased during statin therapy and 
stopped when statin therapy was discontinued. Patients not receiving a 
daily regimen of a statin (eg, 1 to 3  times weekly) are also considered as 
not able  to tolerate a daily dose.  
Randomization will be stratified according to previous pa rticipation (yes or 
no) in the P hase 2 DFI14223 study and b aseline body weight (<50 or 
≥50 kg). 
The study consists of a run -in period (as needed), screening period, 
double -blind treatment period, and an open label treatment period.  
Run-in period (as needed):  
The run -in period is up to 4 weeks (+2 days) in duration.  
Patients, who consent to participate in the study but who have not been 
on stable LMTs for at least 4 weeks, o r require statin intensification when 
initially seen, can participate in a run -in period until LMT dose(s) have 
been stable for at least 4 weeks. Patients eligible for the run -in period are 
expected to fulfill the LDL -C eligibility criterion at the end of the run -in 
period. Patients who require treatment with statin de novo are not allowed 
to enter the run -in period in order to avoid the potential for multiple 
titration steps.  
Another possible situation requiring the run -in period include patients with 
suspected heFH but without confirmation by [CONTACT_361510]. Such patients will be asked to 
undergo centralized genetic testing during the run -in period.  
Screening period:  
The screening period is up to 2 weeks (+ 5 days) in duration.  
Patients who have previously participated in the DFI14223 study and 
have received alirocumab administration during the open label extension 
of the DFI14223 study will require a wash -out period of at least [ADDRESS_450290] inj ection of alirocumab and the screening lipid

EFC14643  - alirocumab   Version number: [ADDRESS_450291] already met this LDL -C requirement when they screened for 
the DFI14223 study they will not be excluded based on the LDL -C value 
obtained during the screening for the EFC14643 study.  
An intermediate visit for injection training may occur during which the 
patient  if aged 12 years and above  (or another design ated person such as 
parent, etc ) will be trained to self -inject/inject with pla cebo for alirocumab 
after the eligibility criteria have been checked and it is confirmed that the 
patient will likely be randomized. Prior to the injection(s), a local topi[INVESTIGATOR_361459]. 
Investigators  will have the option of providing a second placebo kit for 
alirocumab for patients/parents who require additional injection training 
prior to randomization.  
Patients can be randomized after injection training and as soon as all 
inclusion and no exclusion  criteria are met.  
 Double -blind treatment period:  
The double -blind treatment period is 24 weeks in duration.  
Two dosing regimens will be evaluated - either Q2W or Q4W; the start of 
the recruitment in the Q4W dosing regimen cohort  will depend on the 
status of the recruitment in the Q2W dosing regimen  cohort and the status 
of the amend ment  approval . Patients will be blinded to study treatment 
and randomized to either alirocumab or placebo using a 2:1 ratio for each 
dosing regimen  cohort . 
Q2W dosing regimen  cohort : 
Approximately 75 patients will participate in the Q2W dos ing regimen  
cohort . Patients with BW < 50 kg will receive 1 sub cutaneous (SC) 
injection of 0.5  mL Q2W of alirocumab  or placebo. Patients with BW 
≥50 kg will receive  1 SC injection of 1  mL Q2W of alirocumab or placebo.  
For patients randomized to receive alirocumab the following dose based 
on body weight (BW) will be initially administered : 
• 40 mg for BW <50 kg or,  
• 75 mg for BW  ≥50 kg.  
At Week 12 patients randomized to alirocumab will either:  
• Continue alirocumab 40 mg or 75 mg Q2W, if the Week 8 LDL -
C* is <110 mg/dL (2.85 mmol/L) OR  
• Dose up -titrate to alirocumab 75 mg (for patients on 40 mg) or  
150 mg (for patients on 75 mg)  if the Week 8 LDL -C* is 
≥110  mg/dL (2.85  mmol/L).  
Q4W dosing regimen  cohort : 
Approximately [ADDRESS_450292] 12 weeks of the double -blind peri od and before 
any possible dose -adjustment  to Q2W dosing regi men, all patients will 
receive SC injection (s) Q4W to get a proper evaluation of this dosing 
regimen. After Week 12, w ith regard to the possible dose -adjustment and 
the maintenance of the blind until the end of the double -blind per iod, a ll 
patients will receive SC injection (s) Q2W. Patients receiving alirocumab 
will be under a “ sham  Q2W*” regimen from Week  12 to Week 24, with 
alirocumab  Q4W alternating with placebo Q4W.  
For patients randomized to alirocumab the following dose based on body 
weight (BW) will be initially administered:

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 10 • 150 mg Q4W for BW <50 kg or,  
• 300 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg.  
At Week 12 patients randomized to alirocumab will either:  
• Continue alirocumab 150 mg or 300 mg Q4W, if the  Week  8 
LDL-C is <110 mg/dL (2.85 mmol/L) OR  
• Have a dose -adjustment to  75 mg Q2W (for patients on 150  mg 
Q4W) or 150 mg Q2W (for pat ients on 300mg Q4W) if the 
Week  8 LDL -C is ≥110 mg/dL (2.85 mmol/L).  
*Lipid values obtained at Week 8 for the purpose of up -titrati on 
will not be communicated to I nvestigators to maintain the blind. 
The continu ation or dose up -titration/dose -adjustment of 
alirocumab will occur in an automated process without site or 
patient awareness.  
The first IMP  injection (from the double -blind study treatment kit allocated 
by [CONTACT_65925] [IRT] ) will be done at the site on the 
day of randomization or as close as possible after randomization into the 
study. Patients will be monitored at the inves tigational site for at least 
[ADDRESS_450293] double -blind injection. The subsequent injections 
will be done at a patient -preferred location (eg, at home). All the IMP 
injectio ns can be performed by [CONTACT_361511] (self -injection if aged ≥12) 
or parent, or another designated person or alternative arrangements for 
injection administration will be allowed as needed (eg, return to the clinic). 
It is suggested that patients ≥[ADDRESS_450294], 
do so with parental (or another designated person) supervision; howev er, 
this is not mandatory. The I nvestigator may evaluate the sustained 
reliability of this practice on a case by [CONTACT_361512], maturity levels, availability of the caregiver, or other 
relevant considerations, with the patient. The final decision as to whether 
supe rvision is appropriate for self -injection of alirocumab for  patients 
≥12 years old is per I nvestigator dis cretion. Prior to any injection, a local 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_56358].  
Injection training:  
• Further injection training can be provided at the randomization 
visit Week 0/Day 1 when the patient/parent or a trained 
designated per son injects the first IMP from the double -blind 
study treatment  kit allocated by [CONTACT_12067].  
• Additional training can be offered at scheduled or unscheduled 
visits with the scheduled double -blind treat ment, as per 
patient/parent or I nvestigator’s judgment.  
The laboratory measurement of lipid parameters will be performed by a 
central lab. The specific results of the central lab testing for lipid 
parameters from samples obtained after randomization and during the 
double -blind treatment period will not be communica ted to the sites or to 
the Sponsor’s EFC14643 study team. Instead, the central lab will inform 
sites if patients exceed the triglyceride threshold of 500  mg/dL 
(5.65  mmol/L). Additionally, the site may receive alert related to LDL -C 
<50 mg/dL (1.30 mmol/L)  and associated safety concerns identified by 
[CONTACT_361513], under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_361460] (DMC), the patient’s LDL -C values 
during the double -blind treatment period. No local lab testing for lip id 
parameters should be performed after randomization and throughout the

treatment period barring exceptional circumstances whereby [CONTACT_361514] (including but not limited to triglyceride alert posted by [CONTACT_30812]) wa rrant such changes, as per the I nvestigator’s judgment.  
Patients will be instructed to follow a diet to treat their 
hypercholesterolemia in accordance with local guidelines or local practice 
and they should be on this diet throughout the entire study duration from 
screening.  
Patients, who successfully complete  the 24 -week double -blind treatment 
period can enter the open label treatment period.  
A flow mediated dilatation (FMD) exploratory sub -study that will assess 
endothelial function in the brachial artery will be conducted in a sub -set of 
the study populatio n during the double -blind treatment period. The details 
are provided in  Appendix E . 
Open label treatment period:  
The open label treatment period consists of [ADDRESS_450295] open label alirocumab injection (s) will be done at the site 
followed by [CONTACT_361515] [ADDRESS_450296] open label treatment period visit (ie, Week 24), after 
completion of the double -blind treatment period, depending on the dosing 
regimen cohort  participation, b oth alirocumab and placebo treated 
patients will recei ve ali rocumab either 40  mg Q2W or 150 mg Q4W if BW 
is <50 kg, and 75  mg Q2W o r 300 mg Q4W if body weight is ≥50 kg, from 
the weight obtained at the Week 24 visit.  
After Week 24, the Investigator will manage, based on his/her own 
judgment, adjustment of alirocumab dose based on changes in BW . 
However, related to this up -titration/adjustment of the dose, if the 
Investigator considers that the  up-titration/adjustment would potentially 
negatively impact patient safety , he/she can exercise his/her judgement i n 
a manner that safeguards the safety and wellbeing of the patient. The 
following will be applied based on changes in BW : 
• If currently on [ADDRESS_450297] dose to 75 mg Q2W if 
BW changes from <50 kg to ≥50 kg.  
• If currently on [ADDRESS_450298] do se to 300 mg Q4W if 
BW changes from <50 kg to ≥50 kg.  
For patients whose weight oscillates around 50 kg the dose will be 
adjusted only once during the open -label treatment period.  
The lipid leve ls will be communicated to the I nvestigator during the open 
label treatment period from the second visit (ie, Week 32) onwards. The  
IRT system is set up to allow the  Investigator based on his/her own 
judgment related to the patient’s LDL -C levels and the safety profile , to 
up-titrate, down -titrate, maintain the dos e of alirocumab or discontinue 
alirocumab throughout the study.  
From Week 32 onwards:

on higher doses. For patients not receiving the maximally tolerated 
dose of  statin, statin intensification should be carefully considered 
prior to randomization in this study in order to ensure that the 
addition of a non -statin LDL -C lowering therapy (ie,  alirocumab) 
would be the next appropriate step in the management of the 
patient’s hypercholesterolemia. The highest dose of statin should 
not exceed the maximum labeled dose of statin for pediatric 
patients as per the local prescribing information.  
**** Statin intolerant patient is defined as the inability to tolerate at least 
2 statins: one statin at the lowest daily starting dose, AND another 
statin at any dose, due to skeletal muscle -related symptoms, other 
than those due to strain or trauma, such as pain, aches, weakness, 
or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], that began or increased during statin the rapy and 
stopped when statin therapy was discontinued. Patients not 
receiving a daily regimen of a statin (eg, 1 to 3  times weekly) are 
also considered as not able to tolerate a daily dose.

ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE  Run-in period (as needed):  
The run -in period is up to 4 weeks (+2 days), with 1 visit. Patients can 
enter the screening period as soon as the criteria for stable LMT are met 
and/or centralized genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_193310] (if no clinical criteria or previous 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) is available.  
Screening period:  
The screening period is up to 2 weeks (+5 days) in duration. An 
intermediate/Day  1 visit for injection training may occur during which the 
patient, if aged ≥12 (or another design ated person such as parent, etc ) 
will be trained to self -inject/inject with placebo. Patients can be 
randomized after injection training and as soon as eligibility is confirmed.  
Double -blind treatment period:  
The double -blind treatment period is 24 weeks in duration. Visits will be 
scheduled as follows: randomization visit (Day 1, Week 0), Week  8, 
Week  12 and Week 24 (end of the double -blind treatment period visit).  
 Open label treatment period:  
The first open label treatment period visit will overlap with the end of 
double -blind trea tment period visit. The second visit will take place at 
Week  32. Subsequent visits will be every 12 weeks until the end of the 
open label treatment period (ie, Week 44, Week 56, Week 68, Week  80, 
Week 92 and Week 104 [end of open label treatment period vis it]).  
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 Sample size determination:  
With a randomization ratio of 2:1 (alirocumab: placebo) for each dosing 
regimen cohort, a total sample size of 90 patients (30 in each alirocumab 
dosing regimen group and 15 in each placebo dosing regimen group) will 
have 92% power to detect a difference in mean percent change in LDL -C 
of 30% between each alirocumab dosing regimen group and its 
contemporaneously randomized placebo dosing regimen group, with a 

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 03   06-Jan-2021  
EFC14643  - alirocumab   Version number: [ADDRESS_450307] deviation (SD) of 25%.  
Nevertheless, in order to have a sufficient number of pediatric patients for 
properly assessing the safety and tolerability of alirocumab, sample size 
was incre ased to 150 patients in t otal ( 50 in eac h alirocumab dosing 
regimen group and 25 in each placebo dosing regimen group). The 
enrol lment of 150 patients will allow having a safety assessment ov er 
2 years in approximately 128  patients, assuming a discontinuation rate of 
15%.  
Analysis  population:  
The primary efficacy analysis population will be the ITT population, 
defined as all randomized patients.  
Patients in the ITT population will be analyzed according to the treatment 
group allocated by [CONTACT_17628]. Analyses will compare each 
alirocumab  dosing regimen  group  to its contemporaneously randomized 
placebo group .  
The safety analysis will be performed on the safety population. The safety 
population consists of the randomized population who did actually receive 
at least one dose or pa rtial dose of investigational product analyzed 
according to the treatment actually received. Safety analyses will present  
each alirocumab dosing regimen group  with its contemporaneously 
randomized placebo  dosing regimen group  and again each treatment 
group  (placebo, alirocumab)  regardless of the dosing regimen cohorts  
(pooled across the cohorts).  
Primary analysis:  
The percent change in LDL -C from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_450308] model with repeated measures 
(MMRM) approach. All post -baseline data available within Week 8 to 
Week  24 analysis windows will be used and missing data will be 
accounted for by [CONTACT_56412].  
A separate model will be run for each dosing regimen  cohort , including 
the fixed categorical effects of treatment group ( alirocumab, placebo ), 
randomization strata, time point (Week 8, Week 12, Week 24), treatment -
by-time point interaction and strata -by-time point interaction, as well as 
the continuous fixed covariates of baseline LDL -C value and baseline 
value-by-time point interaction. Throughout the MMRM model s, each 
alirocumab dosing regimen group  will be compared to its 
contemporaneously randomized  placebo dosing regimen group  using 
appropriate contrasts, and the 97.5% confidence interval (CI) of the 
difference will be provided.  
Analysis of secondary endpoints:  
Continuous secondary endpoints with normal distribution will be analyzed 
within each dosing regimen cohort  using the same MMRM model s as for 
the primary endpoint with the corresponding baseline and post -baseline 
values.  
Analyses of the efficacy parameters during the extension period will be 
only descriptive (description of change [% or absolute] over time).  
Safety analysis:  
Safety ana lyses will be descriptive based on the safety population.

additional injection training prior to rando mization.  
k Further injection training can be provided at the randomization visit Week 0/Day 1 when the patient/parent or a trained desig nated person injects the first IMP from the double -blind study treatment kit allocated by 
[CONTACT_12067]. Additional training can b e offered at scheduled or unscheduled visits with the scheduled double -blind treat ment, as per patient/parent or I nvestigator’s judgment.   
l Prior to the injection, a local topi[INVESTIGATOR_56358].  
m The first IMP injection during the double -blind treatment period will be done at the site on the day of randomization and as close as possible after randomization into  the study. The subsequent injections will be 
done at a patient -preferred location (home…). These injections can be performed by [CONTACT_361511] ≥12 years (self -injection) or parent, or another designated person or alternative arrangements for injection 
administration will be allowed as needed . It is suggested that patients ≥[ADDRESS_450310], do so with parental (or another designated person) supervision; howev er, this is not mandatory. 
The I nvestigator may evaluate the sustained reliability of this practice on a case by [CONTACT_361521] s, maturity levels, availa bility of the caregiver, or other relevant considerations, with 
the patient. The final decision as to whether supervision is appropriate for self -injection of alirocumab for  patients ≥12 years old is per I nvestigator discretion. For the Q4W dosing regimen cohort  study treatment 
will be administered every 4 weeks (Q4W) for the first 12 weeks of the double -blind period.  
n Along with kit dispensation, the treatment administration package (see Section  8.5) should be given as well as the patient diary and injection instruction manual, as needed. Open label IMP kit delivery direc t to 
patient (DTP) on Visit 10 and 12.  
o Patients w ill be instructed to follow a diet to treat their hypercholesterolemia in accordance with local guidelines or local practice.  
p Prior to any laboratory testing, the site may utilize a local topi[INVESTIGATOR_56354]. In case only a limi ted a mount of blood can be drawn, specific tests performed for each sample obtained will be 
prioritized (estimated total blood volume of 194.8 mL for the entire study); see Section  10. 
q The lipid levels will be blinded throughout the double -blind treatment period. The lipid levels will  be communicated to the I nvestigator during the open label treatment period from Week 32 o nwards.

Alirocumab is  a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets proprote in convertase subtilisin 
kexin type 9 (PCSK9 ). PCSK9 belongs to the subtilisin family of serine proteases and is highly  
expressed in the liver. PCSK9 is involved in regulating the levels of the low -density lipoprotein 
receptor (LDL -R) protein ( 1, 2). Once PCSK9 is secreted into p lasma it directly binds to the 
LDL -R and promotes its degradation. The increased degradati on of LDLRs leads to a reduced 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) removal and, therefore higher LDL -C circulating 
levels. In humans, PCSK9 mutations have been identified; the gain -of-function mutations are rare 
and cause an autosomal dominant form of severe hypercholesterolemia and premature Coronary 
Heart Disease (CHD) , whereas loss of -function mutations are more common and are associated 
with reduced plasm a levels of LDL -C and protection from CHD ( 3, 4). Therefore, blocking 
PCSK9 binding to the LDL -R can potentially benefit patients with hypercholesterolemia by 
[CONTACT_56420] -C levels. In addition, PCSK9 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) 
and protein levels are increased in response to statins, potentially attenuating their cholesterol -
lowering effect  (1). 
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited diso rder of lipid metabolism, characterized by 
[CONTACT_361524] -C that lead to premature atherosclerosis and cardiovascular 
disease (CVD ) (5). This disorder has a high prevalence in Caucasian populations, where an 
estimated [ADDRESS_450327] 3 different genes that code for 
proteins involved i n hepatic clearance of LDL -C can cause FH. These include mutations in the 
gene coding for the LDL -R that removes LDL -C from the circulation, and less commonly, in the 
gene for apolipoprotein (Apo) B, which is the major protein of the LDL -C particle. In rar e cases, 
the gene coding for PCSK9, an enzyme involved in degrading the LDL -R (gain of function 
mutation), is mutated. Additionally, rare mutations in LDL receptor adaptor 
protein  1 (LDLRAP1), a protein which interacts with the LDL receptor or signal trans ducing 
adaptor family member 1 (STAP1) gene have been noted. In all cases, this results in an 
accumulation of LDL -C in the plasma from birth, and subsequent development of tendon 
xanthomas, xanthelasmas, atheromata, and CVD. Although genetic testing is use ful in the 
diagnosis of heFH, it has limitations such as it may fail to diagnose some patients with heFH. 
There are patients who have clinical heFH but no known genetic ba sis for their heFH. Five to 
30% of cases of phenotypic FH may arise from mutations in  unidentified genes or have a 
polygenic cause ( 6). Accordingly, the protocol allows for patients to be included with either a 
clinical diagnos is or a genetic diagnosis of heFH.  
FH is the most clearly documented to have important cardiovascular consequences beginning in 
childhood ( 7). Even though cardiovascular events are rare in childhood, children with heFH 
already have functional and morphological changes of the vessel wall as illustrated by [CONTACT_361525] (FMD) of the brachial artery ( 8) and an increased intima media thickness 
of the carotid artery (cIMT), with a progression rate for cIMT of approximately double to that 
observed in unaffected siblin gs (9). Both are surrogate markers for atherosclerotic vascular 
disease ( 10) and, thus, indicate that the atherosclerotic process has already been initiated early in 
childhood. Indeed, there is now strong evidence that lesions of atherosclerosis found in adults 
begin in childhood an d are progressive throughout the life span ( 11, 12). These findings strongly

EFC14643  - alirocumab  Version number: [ADDRESS_450328] begin decades prior to the onset 
of symptoms ( 13) and support the target population being evaluated in this study.  
Because of the high risk of progression to premature clinical CVD associated with these findings, 
pediatric guidelines recommend LDL -C lowering intervention and specific  lipid targets for 
children and adolescents with heFH. An LDL -C level of <130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) is considered 
acceptable and <110 mg/dL (2.85 mmol/L) ideal for children with heFH ( 14, 15, 16, 17), or the 
achievement of ≥50% reduction in LDL -C (14). Thus, the protocol will include patient s with a 
screening LDL -C ≥130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) despi[INVESTIGATOR_361469].  
The American Heart Association (AHA) has modified the guidelines, suggesting statins supplant 
bile acid sequestrants not only as first -line treatment but als o at a y ounger age (8 versus 10  years 
of age) ( 14). These revised recommendations were supported by [CONTACT_189950] (AAP) ( 17), as well as and in the recommendations from the National Lipid 
Association Expert Panel on Familial Hypercholesterolemia, in which it is mention ed that statins 
are the preferred initial pharmacologic treatment in children with FH ( 18). The highest doses of 
statins tested in pediatric studies resulted in LDL -C reductions of 24% for pravastatin ( 19), 
27% for lovastatin ( 20), 40% for atorvastatin ( 21), and 41% for simvastatin ( 22). However, use of 
these statins generally does not result in the attainment of the stringent LDL -C target as illustrated 
by [CONTACT_361526] i n children ( 21) where the highest dose tested (20 mg) 
resulted in only 60% of the patients who still did not achieve the optimal LDL -C goal of  
110 mg/dL (2.85 mmol/L), reflecting the difficulty in meeting this target in many FH patients. 
Another 1 -year study with rosuvastatin conducted in children with FH aged 10 to 17 years showed 
that less than half (40%) of subjects reached the m ore stringent  LDL -C goal of 110  mg/dL 
(2.85  mmol/L) ( 23). Therefore, novel compounds that further reduce LDL -C levels when added to 
statin therapy are of i nterest. Limited data are available for the combination of ezetimibe and 
simvastatin ( 24) and are consistent with studies conducted in adults, showing an incremental 
decrease of approximately 15% in LDL -C levels compared with administration of simvastatin 
alone. With the high est dose of simvastatin (40 mg), significantly more subjects, achieved an 
LDL -C target of 130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) and the optimal LDL -C goal of  110 mg/dL  
(2.85  mmol/L) in the coadministration of ezetimibe with 40 mg simvastatin group than in the 
simvastati n 40 mg monotherapy group, 77% versus 53% a nd 63% versus 27%, 
respectively  (p <0.01 for both comparisons). However the therapeutic management of this 
population requires a careful balance between increased dosing (administration of this high 
simvastatin do se) and potential side effects versus achieving treatment goals. Taken together, this 
information supports the age of patients included in this study as well as the definition of stable 
LMTs as provided for in the inclusion criteria of the protocol and its  mandatory use as 
background therapy. Stable LMTs include stable optimal doses of statin which are based on 
pediatric guidelines which will be followed by [CONTACT_779] ( 25). 
Very little information is available on statin intolerance in the pediatric population. This is likely 
related to the small size or the limited duration of the studies conducted with statins, adverse 
events (AE) such as muscle symptoms, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increase, or elevations in 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were reported in some patients 
(26). Therefore statin intolerance in pediatric population cannot be ruled out. This is 
acknowledged by [CONTACT_361527] -statin Lipid modifying therapy (LMT) for lower ing LDL -C levels in children and

commonly prescr ibed in the pediatric population, more particularly ezetimibe and colesevalam, 
appear less effective than statins on LDL -C lowering, and therefore similar issues are met with 
regard to achieving treatment goals. It is recognized that there is no consensus definition for statin 
intolerance. The protocol provides for a definition of statin intolerance that was utilized in the 
adult alirocumab program. This strict definition has been discussed and agreed upon by [CONTACT_361528].  
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in the pediatric 
population. It is a randomized, 24 -week double -blind (DB), placebo -controlled, parallel group 
study with an open label treatment period. The assessment of the primary endpoint of L DL-C at

that all patients will be on an optimal dose of statin with or without other LMT  (or non -statin 
LMT only if statin intolerant according to a strict definition) and that this should continue 
throughout the study. Additionally, the patients who are randomized to the placebo group will also 
have the opportunity to enter into an 80 -week o pen label treatment period.  
Preliminary clinical data from the DFI14223 study, were base d on 31 pediatric patients in 
3 different cohorts. This P hase 2 study evaluated a fixed dosage according to body weight (BW) 
categories, with staggered doses of 30 mg every two w eeks (Q2W) (Cohort 1) and 40 mg  Q2W 
(Cohort 2) or 75 mg every four weeks (Q4W) (Cohort 3) for chil dren with a BW below 50  kg 
(ie, lower BW category), and doses of 50 mg Q2W (Cohort 1) and 75 mg Q2W (Cohort 2) or 
150 mg Q4W (Cohort 3) for childre n with a BW ≥50 kg (ie, higher BW category). Staggered 
doses were employed as a cautious approach in the first introduction of alirocumab in the 
pediatric population where it was expected that the 4 0 mg Q2W for BW<50 kg and 75 mg  Q2W 
for BW ≥[ADDRESS_450330] on LDL -C and the safety were analyzed. 
The primary efficacy endpoint as measured by [CONTACT_361529] -C at 
Week 8 demonstrated a greater reduction in LDL -C, overall, in Cohort 2 using the Q2W dosing 
regimen (LS mean change from baseline in LDL -C -46.1% ) with a mean reduction observed in 
both BW categories ( -40.4% with 40 mg Q2W in the lower BW category, and -49.8% with 75  mg 
Q2W in the higher BW category), as compared with the Cohort  1 using as well t he Q2W dosing 
regimen (LS mean change from baseline in LDL -C -21.2% with a mean reduction not consistent 
across the 2 doses, -41.2%with the 30 mg Q2W dose in the lower BW category) versus -7.9% 
with the 50 mg Q2W dose in the higher BW category. Regarding t he Cohort 3, overall the LS 
mean change from baseline in LDL -C was -7.7%, with a mean re duction of -17.5% with the 
75 mg Q4W dose in the lower BW category and a mean in crease of +4.0% with the [ADDRESS_450331] proportion of patients in the 2 BW 
categories reaching both the target of LDL -C<130 mg/ dL (3.37 mmol/L) and LDL -C <110  mg/dL 
(2.85 mmol/L) was observ ed with the 2  doses (40 mg Q2W/ 75 mg Q2W) as per BW category 
(<50 kg/ ≥50 kg) of C ohort 2. Overall f or combined doses, the proportion of patients who achieved

EFC14643  - alirocumab  Version number: 1 
Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 39 a LDL -C value <110 mg/dL (2.85 mmol/L) was 76.4%. There were no patients with 
treatment -emergent s erious adverse event, treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAE) leading to 
death, or TEAEs leading t o permanent treatment discontinuation. There were no adverse events of 
special interest (AESI) including, neurological events, neurocognitive events, increase in ALT, 
allergic drug reactions, or local injection site reactions for all of the 6 dose groups. Alirocumab 
was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile in all cohorts and dose groups.  
Given the unexpected results observed for the Q4W dosing regime n as described above for 
Cohort  3 with 75 mg Q4W for BW < 50 kg and 150 mg Q4W for BW ≥ 50 kg), no formal 
conclusion could be drawn. The doses evaluated were likely not high enough to achieve larger and 
sustained reductions in the LDL -C over the entire dosing interval in children receiving statin as 
background therapy. Therefore,  before inves tigating this Q4W dosing regimen in the 
Phase 3 EFC14643 study, further evaluation with higher doses 150 mg/300 mg Q4W depending 
on the BW category was conducted through  an additional Cohort 4 in the P hase 2 DFI14223 study. 
The primary efficacy endpoint, as  measured by [CONTACT_361530] -C at 
Week  8, for Cohort 4 (mean LS change from baseline -44.5%) showed a clinically meaningful 
reduction comparable to results observed for Cohort 2 using the 40 mg and 75 mg Q2W dosing 
regimen (mean LS change  from baseline -46.1%). Substantial reductio ns were seen across both 
Cohort  4 doses ranging from -31.9% to -59.8 % for 150 mg and 300 mg Q4W, respectively. 
Overall for combined doses, the proportion of patients who achieved  a LDL -C value <110  mg/dL 
(2.85 mmol/L) was 86.4%. Alirocumab was well tolerated with a similar favorable safety profile 
in Cohort 4 as compared with the other cohorts. No new clinically significant safety findings were 
noted in pediatric patients treated with alirocumab in this add itional cohort.  
Based on these results, the doses selected to be evaluated for the EFC14643 study ar e 40 mg  Q2W 
for BW<50 kg and 75 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg in the Q2W dose regimen, and 150 mg Q4W for 
BW<50 kg and 300 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg in the Q4W dose regi men. However as described 
above although a majority of patients achieved a LDL -C value <110 mg/dL (2.85  mmol/L) 
(76.4% of patients in Coh ort 2, and 86.4% in Cohort 4), about 20% of patients still had elevated 
LDL -C in the context of the lifelong exposure t o high levels of plasma LDL -C and the increased 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_104190]. It is therefore the expectation that using an up -
titration/dose -adjustment scheme as already done for adults will result in additional decrease of 
LDL -C and will optimize t he proportion of patients achieving the LDL -C ideal goal. Regarding 
the up -titration scheme and based on the data from P hase 3 adults studies, doubling the dose of 
alirocumab should result in an additional decrease in LDL -C of about 10%.  
Given the baseline levels expected in this heFH pediatric population, the chance to have patients 
experiencing LDL -C levels <50 mg /dL is expected to be very low. Nevertheless, as done in the 
adult development program, a specific monitoring plan for patients reaching  LDL -C values below 
50 mg/dL will be implemented with the collaboration of the DMC and an independent physician. 
Therefore , the following scheme will be applied according to the BW category:  
• Q2W dosing regimen: A starting dose of 40 mg Q2W with  possible up -titration to 
75 mg Q2W for BW  <50 kg, and a starting dose of 75 mg Q2W with possible up -titration 
to 150  mg Q2W for BW  ≥50 kg.

Conclusion on the benefit risk assessment with alirocumab:  
Based on the clinical data available to date in the adult population, treatment with alirocumab has 
demonstrated a signific ant LDL -C lowering effect in a population of patients with non -FH or with 
heFH. The LDL -C lowering efficacy was associated with consi stent decreases in Total -C, Apo  B, 
non- high-density lipoprotein -C (non -HDL -C), a decrease in lipoprotein Lp(a), and a favo rable 
trend for high -density lipoprotein -C (HDL -C) and triglycerides (TG). Maximum efficacy was 
observed as early as [ADDRESS_450332] with both the Q2W and Q4W dosing regimen. The percent 
change from baseline in LDL -C at Week 8 demonstrated a greater and consistent reduction, 
overall, in Cohort 2 using the Q2W dosing regimen and  in Cohort 4 using the Q4W dosing 
regimen as compared with Cohorts 1 and 3.  
Alirocumab administration to date in clinical trials conducted in adults has been associated with a 
favorable safety and tolerability profile.  
Immunogenicity and systemic hypersens itivity are considered as identified risks for alirocumab.  
The following safety information is based on the adult clinical trials. Injection site reactions 
(including erythema/redness, itching, swelling, pain, tenderness), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_361470] (including mainly oropharyngeal pain, rhinorrhea, sneezing), pruritus, hypersensitivity, 
eczema nummular, urticaria, and hypersensitivity vasculitis are identified as adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs) for alirocumab. ADRs include AEs for which there is some basis to believe that 
there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the AE.  
Monitoring of these AEs will be continued in all studies conducted in adult and pediatric patients.  
In addition in adults there was no safety signal  observed with neurologic events, alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) increase and hepatic disorders, adjudicated cardiovascular events, 
diabetes mellitus, skeletal -muscle related disorders and ophthalmologic disorders in the 
alirocumab -treated group overall, b ut more cataracts (2.6%) were noted in patients treated with 
alirocumab who achieved 2 consecutive LDL -C values <25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L) compared to 
0.8% of alirocumab -treated patients who did not achieve such low levels. Although limitation has 
to be consi dered with regard to this post -randomization comparison and there were no statistically 
significant differences in the incidence of cataracts in this subgroup of patients when compared to 
control groups, cataract in patients with very low LDL -C levels is c onsidered as a potential risk 
and the Sponsor will continue to monitor this potential risk. There was no safety signal observed 
for neurocognitive disorders, however, the Sponsor will monitor this potential risk as an adverse 
event of special interest (AES I).

alirocumab.   
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) dedicated to the pediatric clinical program 
conducted with alirocumab will meet periodically to review the safety data collected in this study.  
With regard to the neurocognitive function, a specific assessment will be performed through 
formal neurocognitive testing with Cogstate battery test in this study.  
This specific study is undertaken to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in the heFH 
pedia tric population. Because of the rapid clinical progression of atherosclerotic disease in 
children and adults with familial hypercholesterolemia pediatric guidelines ( 14, 15, 16, 17, 18) 
recommend LDL -C lowering intervention starting with statins. However, not all patients c an 
achieve target LDL -C reductions with currently available LMTs, and these pediatric patients 
represent a group with an identified unmet medical need that can be addressed by [CONTACT_361531] -C lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

This study is a Phase 3, randomized, 24 -week double -blind treatment, placebo -controlled, 
parallel - group, mult i-national, multi -center study followed by [CONTACT_361532] 
80 weeks.  
Approximately 150 children and adolescents aged of 8 to 17 years with heFH and LDL -C 
≥130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) at screening visit despi[INVESTIGATOR_361458] s will be randomized with a 
2:1 ratio (alirocumab: placebo). Two dosing regimens , Q2W and Q4W, will be evaluated with 
approximately 75 patients in each dosing regimen  cohort . The start of the recruitment in the Q4W 
dosing regimen cohort  will depend on the status of the recruitment in the Q2W dosing r egimen 
cohort  and the status of the amendment approval. This process will be managed by [CONTACT_276359]  (IRT) system, depending on the overall recruitment status and amend ment 
approval status. All efforts will be made to achieve adequate representation across age groups.  
Stable LMTs are defined as stable optimal dose of statin ± other stable LMTs or stable do se of 
non-statin LMTs in statin intolerant patients for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. The optimal 
dose of statin is defined as the dose prescribed based on regional practice or local guidelines or is 
the dose that is maximally tolerated due to adverse effects of higher doses. For patients not 
receiving maximally tolerated statin, statin intensification should be carefully considered prior to 
randomization in this study in order to ensure that the addition of a non -statin LDL -C lowering 
therapy (ie, alirocumab) would be the next appropriate step in the management o f the patient’s 
hypercholesterolemia. The highest dose of statin should not exceed the maximum labeled dose of 
statin for pediatric patients as per the local prescribing information. Statin intolerant patient is 
defined as one with the inability to tolerat e at least 2 statins: one statin at the lowest daily starting 
dose, and another statin at any dose, due to skeletal muscle -related symptoms, other than those 
due to strain or trauma, such as pain, aches, weakness, or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], that began or increased 
durin g statin therapy and stopped when statin therapy was discontinued. Patients not receiving a 
daily regimen of a statin (eg, 1 to 3 times weekly) are also considered as not able to tolerate a 
daily dose.  
Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_361466] a specimen of whole blood, saliva, or buccal swab

<50 kg, and 75  mg Q2W or 300 mg Q4W if BW is  ≥50 kg, from the weight obtained at the  
Week  24 visit.  
After Week 24, the Investigator will manage, based on his/her own judgment, adjustment of 
alirocumab dose based on changes in BW . However, related to this up -titration/ adjustment of the 
dose, if the Investigator considers that the  up-titration/adjustment would potentially negatively 
impact patient safety , he/she can exercise his/her judgement in a manner that safeguards the safety 
and wellbeing of the patient. The following will be applied based on changes in BW : 
• If currently on [ADDRESS_450351] dose to 75 mg Q2W if BW changes from <50  kg to 
≥50 kg.  
• If currently on [ADDRESS_450352] dose to 30 0 mg Q4W if BW changes from <50  kg 
to ≥50 kg.  
For patients whose weight oscillates around 50 kg the dose will be adjusted only once during the

A manual for IMP administration (injection instruction manual) will be provided to patients  
containing detailed instructions on use. The IMP could be administered by [CONTACT_6270] -inject ion (only 
patients with age ≥[ADDRESS_450353]) or by [CONTACT_361535] (such as a parent, nurse etc ). 
The used PFS  will be discarded in a sharps container which will be provided to patients. Patients 
will be asked to store the IMP in a refrigerator. Prior to administration, the IMP should be set in a 
safe location at room temperature for about 30 to 40 minutes. Thereafter, the IMP should be 
administered as soon as possible.  
Double -blind IMP wi ll start as soon as possible after the call for randomization using the 
treatment kit numbers provided by [CONTACT_15017] (IRT). If possible , the 
first injection after randomization will be done at the investigational site by [CONTACT_11581] t or another 
designated person (such as parent, nurse, etc) under direct site staff supervision. Patients will be 
monitored at the investigational site for at least [ADDRESS_450354] double -blind injection. 
IMP should ideally be administered SC a t approximately the same time of the day; however, it is 
acceptable to have a window period of ±3  days. The time of the day is based on patient's 
preference. If by [CONTACT_361536] 
7 days or complet ely missed, then the patient should return to the original schedule of study 
treatment administration without administering delayed injections. On the other hand, if the delay 
is less than or equal to 7 days from the missed date, then the patient should ad minister the delayed 
injection and then resume the original schedule of study treatment administration.  
All of the IMP injections can be performed by [CONTACT_361511] ≥12 years (self -injection) or parent, 
or another designated person or alternative arrange ments for injection administration will be 
allowed as needed [eg, if the patient, or caregiver(s) do not develop the comfort to inject the 
investigational drug at home, or the Investigator determines that patient (or caregiver) injection at 
home is not app ropriate, injections can be performed at the site by [CONTACT_181252]]. It is 
suggested that patients ≥[ADDRESS_450355], do so with parental (or 
another designated person) supervision; howev er, this is not mandatory. Th e Investigator may 
evaluate the sustained reliability of this practice on a case by [CONTACT_361512], maturity levels, availability of the caregiver, or other relevant considerations, 
with the patient. The final decision as to whether supervision is appropriate for self -injection of 
alirocumab for  patients ≥[ADDRESS_450356]:  
Patients will have the option, where available to receive the IMP at home using a Direct -To-
Patient (DTP) service provider on appropriate visits. Patient identification remains confidential 
and will not be disclosed to study S ponsor. For this re ason, the IMP delivery will be managed by 
[CONTACT_361537]. The clinical site will instruct the patient, as appropriate, as to how the DTP 
process operates before the DTP process starts.

The following classes of drugs (not all of which are indicated for pediatric use in all count ries; for 
further information, I nvestigators should refer to their local prescribing  information) are identified 
as noninvestigational medicinal products (NIMP) because the medication is a potential 
background therapy:  
• Statins.  
• Cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe).  
• Bile acid -binding sequestrants (such as cholestyramine, colestipol, colesevelam).  
• Nicotinic acid.  
• Fenofibrate.  
• Omega -3 fatty acids (≥1000 mg daily).  
An additional open label treatment period with alirocumab will be offered for this patient 
population. Treatment will continue until one of the following occurs:  
• Risk/benefit of alirocumab in this patient population is deemed not favorable.  
• The study will end in July [ADDRESS_450358].  
8.3 BLINDING PROCEDURES   
8.3.1  Methods of blinding   
During the double -blind treatment period, alirocumab and placebo for alirocumab will be 
provided in identically  matched PFS (with or without safety system, depending on the time in the 
study) and packaged identically which includes labeling to protect the blind. Each double -blind 
treatment kit will be labeled with a number, which will be generated by a computer pro gram from 
[COMPANY_011]. The treatment kit numbers will be obtained by [CONTACT_361538] a centralized treatment allocation 
system that will be available [ADDRESS_450359] access to the randomization (treatment codes) except under 
circumstances described in Section  8.3.2 .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PK and anti -alirocumab antibodies   
At the as say institutions charged for PK/ anti-alirocumab (drug) antibodies (ADA) measurements, 
some of the samples will be analyzed prior to database lock leading to unblinding of responsible 
bioanalysts. Bioanalysts are excluded from the operation’s team  and a process will be set up to 
prevent any potential unblinding. Patients’ anti -alirocumab antibody results will not be 
communicated to the sites, during the double -blind phase, so that the patient’s ADA levels do not 
influence the Investigator’s safety evaluation.  

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 03   06-Jan-2021  
EFC14643  - alirocumab  Version number: [ADDRESS_450360] additional antibody sample(s),  at [ADDRESS_450361] dose and 
thereafter about every 3 to 6 months until titer returns below 240. Patients who enter the open 
label treatment period will be monitored for anti -alirocumab antibodies as per the study flowchart 
(Section  1.3).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Lipid parameters   
Lipid parameter value s from blood samples obtained after the randomization visit and during the 
double -blind phase, run by [CONTACT_6626], will not be communicated to the sites so that the 
patient’s LDL -C values do not influence the Investigator’s safety evaluation or potenti ally break 
the blind. The Sponsor’s EFC14643 study team will not have access to these values either.  
During the open label treatment period, from Week 32 the lipid leve ls will be communicated to 
the Investigator. The Investigator will be responsible, base d on his/her own judgment related to 
the patients’ LDL -C levels and the safety profile, to up -titrate, down -titrate, maintain the dose of 
alirocumab or discontinue alirocumab throughout the study. The reasons of any adjustment should 
be documented and reco rded in the electronic case report form (e -CRF).  
8.3.2  Randomization code breaking during the double -blind treatment period of the study   
In case of an Adverse Event (AE), the code mus t be broken by [CONTACT_361539]. If possible, a 
contact [CONTACT_361540]/Medical Monitor before breaking the code. 
All calls will be docum ented by [CONTACT_361541], name [CONTACT_361619][CONTACT_361542], patient ID, documentation of 
the request, and decision for unblinding or not.  
Code breaking can be performed at any time by [CONTACT_361543]/or by [CONTACT_361544]. However, it is preferable to contact [CONTACT_361545].  
If the blind is broken, the Investigator must document the date, time of day, and reason for code 
breaking, and report this information (or “relevant information as required by”) on the appropriate 
page of the e -CRF. Note that when documenting the reason for unblinding, the Investigator must 
not provide any detail regarding the nature of the IMP. The Investigator should not divulge IMP 
detail to the Sponsor’s representative from the EFC14643 study or to any staff members until 
database closure. Furthermore, when completing forms (eg, AE, serious AE [SAE]), the study 
treatment should not be disclosed on the forms.  
The code -breaking can also be performed by [CONTACT_154946] "24 hour alert system"; but this 
system should be used in very exceptional c ases only (ie, unavailability of a centralized treatment 
allocation system or inability to contact [CONTACT_18615]/or site staff). However, the preferred 
option is to unblind using a centralized treatment allocation system. The Investigators will be

including the relevant “24 hour alert system” telephone number wil l be provided to every patient 
who will participate in the study.  
Unblinding may also be performed by [CONTACT_361547]. Refer to  
Section  10.[ADDRESS_450362] withdraw from IMP administration.  
8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMEN T GROUP   
The lists of treatment kit numbers will be generated centrally by [CONTACT_13225]; separate lists will be 
prepared for Q2W and Q4W dosing regimen  cohort . The IMPs will be packaged in accordance 
with those lists.  
The Trial Supply Operations Manager (TSOM) will provide the list of treatment kit numbers. 
Then, this cent ralized treatment allocation system provider will generate the patient list according 
to which it will allocate the treatment kits to the patients.  
Two dosing regimens will be evaluated - either Q2W or Q4W. For each dosing regimen  cohort 
patients will be allocated to receive repeated doses of SC alirocumab injections or matching 
placebo.  
Before allocating a tre atment kit to the patient, the I nvestigator or designee will have to contact 
[CONTACT_56443].  
A randomized patient is d efined as a patient who is registered and assigned with a treatment kit 
number from the centralized treatment allocation system, as documented from its log file 
regardless of whether the treatment kit will be used or not. A patient cannot be randomized mor e 
than once in the study. If a treatment is used without contact[CONTACT_361548], then the patient will be considered as not randomized and withdrawn from the 
study.  
Two types of centralized treatment allocation system will be used, the Interactive Voice Response 
System (IVRS) and the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) depending on the choice of the 
site. Interactive response technology (IRT) covers both centralized treatment allocation.  
8.[ADDRESS_450363] PACKAGING AND LABELI NG  
For the double -blind treatment period, each kit will contain pre -filled syringes with finger grip 
(PFS) to be replaced by [CONTACT_094] -filled syringes with safety s ystem (PFS -S) when they become 
available of alirocumab 75 mg/mL or alirocumab 150 mg/mL or placebo for alirocumab as 
described in Section  8.1.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 57 For the open label treatment period, each kit will contain pre -filled syringes (PFS -S) of 
alirocumab as described in Section  8.1.  
Packaging is in accordance with the administration schedule. The content of the labeling is in 
accordance with the local regulatory specifications and requirements.  
8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS A ND S HELF LIFE   
The IMP will be stored in a refriger ator between +2°C and +8°C (36° -46° F) by [CONTACT_779]. The 
temperature of the site refrigerator should be checked daily and recorded on  a log sheet. Any 
temperature excursion during transportation to the site or during storage at site should be promptly 
reported to the Sponsor who will assess the suitability for use of the IMPs.  
Investigators or other authorized persons (eg, pharmacists) are responsible for storing the 
IMP/NIMP  in a secure and safe place in accordance with local regulations, labeling specifications, 
policies, and procedures.  
Control of IMP storage c onditions, especially control of temperature (eg, refrigerated storage) and 
information on in -use stability and instructions for handling the alirocumab must be managed 
according to the rules provided by [CONTACT_1034].  
After the supply of IMP kits to patient s at the study site visits, appropriate provisions will be in 
place for transportation of the IMP kits from the study site to the patient’s refrigerator in case of 
self-injections or injections administered by [CONTACT_361549].  
NOTE: Exceptional ly, after discussion between Site and Sponsor (eg, patient unable to attend a 
clinic visit due to special circumstances) some IMP kits could be supplied, when feasible, directly 
from site to patient via a Sponsor -approved courier company. This process (whi ch requires 
maintenance of the cold chain) would be implemented only at selected sites/countries (where 
certain conditions would be fulfilled, and where permitted locally) and for selected patients (who 
could handle and would consent to such a process). Th is direct -to-patient (DTP) process will be 
described in detail in a separate document and would be implemented after appropriate training 
of Monitoring Teams and Investigational Sites.  
8.[ADDRESS_450364], or other personnel allowed to store and dispense the 
IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP used in the clinical trial is securely maintained 
as specified by [CONTACT_361550] a ccordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  
All IMP will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the 
Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is 
maintained.  
Any qual ity issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IMP/NIMP (deficiency in condition, 
appearance, pertaining documentation, labeling, expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], etc) should be promptly notified

(see Section  10.4.7 ). 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP/NIMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure 
by [CONTACT_1034]. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any 
request made by [CONTACT_1034], in order to recall the IMP/NIMP and eliminate potential hazards.  
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP/N IMP to a third party, allow the 
IMP/NIMP to be used other than as directed by [CONTACT_13129], or dispose of 
IMP/NIMP in any other manner.  
8.7.1  Treatment accountability and compliance   
IMP administratio n data will be recorded by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator on e -CRF and  by [CONTACT_1962]/parents on 
a patient's diary. Measures taken to ensure and document IMP compliance and accountability are 
described below:  
• The Investigator or designee will  obtain via IRT the treatment kit number(s) and he/she 
will dispense the treatment kit(s) to the patient.  
• The accountability at site is to be performed at IMP kit re -supply visits only  
(see Section  10.1). The used and unused kit(s) should be brought back to such visits for 
accountability purposes.  
• The I nvestigator or designee will complete the corresponding treatment log form from 
patient's diary.  
• The I nvestigator/study coordinator will enter data in the appropriate e -CRF pages, 
according to data recorded in the treatment log form.  
• The monitor will check the data consistency between e -CRF pages, treatment log forms 
using patient's diary, and returned unused syringes of a corresponding kit.  
8.7.2  Return and/or destruction of treatments   
A detailed treatment log of the destroyed IMP will be established  with the Investigator (or the 
pharmacist) and countersigned by [CONTACT_179626]. The Investigator will 
not destroy the unused IMP unless the Sponsor provides written authorization.  
If the site is not able to destroy or destruction not allowed in the country, all treatments kits will

The double -blind treatment period is 24 weeks in duration. Patients will be blinded to study 
treatment (alirocumab or placebo).   
For dosing and timing of injection details, see Section  8.1. 
The laboratory measurement  of lipid parameters will be performed by a central lab. Local lab 
testing for lipid parameters is generally prohibi ted after randomization of the patient. The specific 
results of the central lab testing for lipid parameters from samples obtained after randomization 
and during the double -blind treatment period will not be communicated to the sites or the 
Sponsor’s EFC14 643 study team. Instead, the central lab will inform sites of triglyceride alert (if 
patients exceed the triglyceride threshold of 500 mg/dL [5.65 mmol/L]). Additionally, the site 
may receive alert related to LDL -C <50 mg/dL (1.30 mmol/L) based on safety c oncerns by [CONTACT_361564]’s  LDL -C values during the 
double -blind treatment period under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_361477]. The independent physician is 
external to the EFC14643 study team and not part of any alirocum ab activities.  
Statin and other LMT (if applicable) should be stable during double -blind treatment period 
barring exceptional  circumstances whereby [CONTACT_179631] (including but not limited to 
triglyceride alert posted by [CONTACT_6626]) warrant such  changes, a s per the I nvestigator’s 
judgment. Patients will be instructed to follow a diet to treat their hypercholesterolemia in 
accordance with local guidelines or local practice and they should be on this diet throughout the 
entire study duration from s creening.

10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANE NT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATIO N  
The IMP should be continued whenever possible. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made temporarily; permanent IMP d iscontinuation should be 

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 03   06-Jan-2021  
EFC14643  - alirocumab  Version number: [ADDRESS_450385](s)   
Temporary treatment  discontinuation (also referred to as treatment interruption) may be 
considered by [CONTACT_361567]. Reinitiating of treatment with the IMP 
will be done under close and appropriate clinical/and or laboratory monitoring once the 
Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical judgment that the 
responsibility of the IMP in the occurrence of the concerned event was unlikely and if the 
selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to Section  7.1 and Section  7.2). All treatment 
interruption dura tion must be recorded by [CONTACT_361568] e -CRF  screens when 
considered as confirmed.  
Treatment interruption is defined as one or more scheduled injections that are not adm inistered to 
the patient as decided by [CONTACT_737].  
10.3.[ADDRESS_450386](s)   
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any treatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator not to re -expose the patient to the IMP at any time during 
the study, or from the patient not to be re -exposed to the IMP whatever the reason.  
10.3.[ADDRESS_450387] of criteria for perm anent treatment discontinuation   
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and 
irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Inve stigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to 
document the reasons for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the e -CRF.  
Patients should discontinue the IMP for the following reasons:  
• Pregnancy, intention for pregnancy, or no longe r with effective contraceptive method of 
birth control (females of child bearing potential who are sexually active only).  
• Acute injection reaction of clinical concern.  
• Serious adverse event (or non -serious but severe in intensity) of hypersensitivity reacti on 
considered related to alirocumab.  
• At patient/parents request (ie, withdrawal of the consent for treatment).  
• If, in the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation with the administration of the IMP would be 
detrimental to the patient's well -being.  
• Intercurrent  condition that requires discontinuation of the IMP.  
• At the specific request of the Sponsor.  
• Patient receives treatment prior to randomization.

Any code -breaking requested by [CONTACT_361569].  
All cases of permanent treatment discontinuation must be recorded by [CONTACT_13135] e -CRF when considered as confirmed.  
10.3.4  Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation   
In case of permanent treatment dis continuation, the recommendation is to limit the collection to 
critical data, ie, primary endpoint/main secondary endpoint and safety endpoints.  
Patients who prematurely discontinue study treatment (regardless of the reason) should undergo 
the following vi sits: 
Premature treatment discontinuation during the double -blind treatment period:   
• At the time of treatment discontinuation, the patient should have, as soon as possible, an 
unscheduled visit with assessments normally planned at end of treatment period visit 
including lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], PK and ADA.  
• Week [ADDRESS_450388] alirocumab injection, including for patients included and not treat ed. 
All efforts should be done to perform these assessments.  
Premature treatment discontinuation during the open label treatment period:   
• At the time of treatment discontinuation, the patient should have, as soon as possible, an 
unscheduled visit with asse ssments normally planned at end of open label treatment period 
visit including lipi[INVESTIGATOR_56383].  
• Week [ADDRESS_450389] alirocumab injection.  
Whatever the period  of premature treatment discontinuation, the patient, at a minimum, should be 
followed up for recovery or stabilization of any AE as spe cified in this protocol.  
All definitive  discontinuation of study treatment should be recorded by [CONTACT_56478] e -CRF and in the patient’s medical records when considered as 
“confirmed”. IRT should be notified when a pat ient prematurely discontinues study treatment.

10.4 OBLIGATION OF THE IN VESTIGATOR REGARDING  SAFETY REPORTING   
10.4.1  Definitions of adverse events   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse event   
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward  medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient admi nistered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious adverse event   
A serious adverse event  (SAE ) is any untoward  medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death, or  
• Is life -threatening, or  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the pati ent was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or

• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a medically important event  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important me dical events that may not 
be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_326868] (ie, specific measures or corrective 
treatment) to prevent one of the other outco mes listed in the definition above.  
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for 
determining which condition has to be considered a medically important event. The list is not 
intended to be exhaustive:  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for:  
- Allergic bronchospasm  
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc) 
- Convulsions (seizures, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], epi[INVESTIGATOR_12995], absence, etc)

• Chronic neurodegenera tive diseases (newly diagnosed)  
• Suspected tran smission of an infectious agent  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse event of special interest   
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an AE (serious or non -serious) of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and 
immediate notification by [CONTACT_361570]. Such events may require 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special 
interest may be added, modified or removed during a study by [CONTACT_12548].  
Adverse  Events of Special Interest (AESI) are AEs (serious or non -serious) that need to be 
monitored, documented, and managed in a pre -specified manner described in the protocol. Please 
see Appendix F  for additional information.

notification  described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, using the 
corresponding screens in the e -CRF:  
The following AEs are considered as AESIs in the study:  
• ALT >[ADDRESS_450395] (if baseline ALT < ULN), or ALT ≥2 times the baseline value (if baseline 
ALT ≥ ULN) (see the “Increase in ALT” flow diagram in Appendix H of the protocol).  
• Allergic events:  
- Any general allergic events regardless of the cause that require consultation with 
another physician for further evaluation of hypersensitivity/allergy as per the 
Investigator’s medical judgment or as per Section  10.6.2 , should be reported as an 
AESI.  
- All general allergic events require completion of the specific e -CRF screen 
(see Section  10.6.2 ). 
• Local injection site reactions:  
- Local injection site reactions that require consultat ion with another physician for 
further evaluation of hypersensitivity/allergy as per the Investigator’s medical 
judgment or as per Section  10.6.2 , should be reported as an AESI.  
- All local injection site reactions require completion of the specific e -CRF screen 
(see Section  10.6.2 ) 
• Pregnancy:  
- Pregnancy occurring in a female patient or the partner of a male patient included in the 
clinical trial. Pregnancy will be recorded as a pre -specified AESI with immediate 
notification in all ca ses. It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills the SAE 
criteria,  
- In the event of pregnancy of a female patient included in the trial, IMP should be 
discontinued,  
- The follow -up of the pregnancy in a female participant or in a female partner of a ma le 
participant will be mandatory until the outcome has been determined.  
• Symptomatic Overdose with IMP alirocumab:  
- An overdose (accidental or [intentional]) is an event suspected by [CONTACT_56453] (not based on sys tematic injection counts) and 
defined as at least twice of the intended dose within the intended therapeutic interval 
(ie, 2 or more injections from the treatment kit are administered in <7 calendar days) to 
be reported using the corresponding screens in t he e-CRF using the term “symptomatic 
overdose (accidental [or intentional])”. The patient should be monitored and 
appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted if needed,  
- The circumstances of the overdose should be clearly specified in the verbatim,

standard AE.  
• Neurocognitive events:  
- All neurocognitive events will be considered as AESI.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Local injection site reactions   
Local injection site reactions that are related  to the alirocumab injection, as opposed to another 
injectable agent, should be further characterized by [CONTACT_361571], pain, etc. If the patient experiences a 
local injection site reaction with no signs or symptoms except for erythema/redness, and/or 
swelling, an d the diameter of the erythema/ redness, or swelling measure <2.5 cm, no AE for local 
injection site reaction needs to be reported as this is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_361479] a clinically important 
finding. However, if the patient has a reaction of swelling with a diameter <2.5 cm that interferes 
with activity, then it should be considered as a clinically relevant finding and should be reported 
as an AE with a corre sponding grade of moderate or severe, in accordance with  Appendix G . 
Special e -CRF screens will need to be completed. If such an AE was to occur, t hen do not report 
the individual components of the reaction but rather the term “local injection site reaction”, the 
individual components being described in the specific e -CRF screen.  
If a local topi[INVESTIGATOR_361480], the time of local anesthetic

• Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or  
• Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or  
• Defined as an AE of special interest with immediate notification.  
The Investigator should take appropriate measures to follow all AEs until clinic al recovery is 
complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, 
or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will 
continue beyond the last planned visit pe r protocol, and that additional investigations may be 
requested by [CONTACT_181287]. At the prespecified study end -
date, patients who experience an ongoing SAE or an AESI should be followed until resolution, 
stabilization , or death and related data will be collected.  
When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end 
of the study as defined by [CONTACT_56485].  
Instructions for AE reporting are summarized in Table  [ADDRESS_450396] immediately:  
• ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the e -CRF; the system will automatically send the notification to the Monitoring Team and 
Pharmacovigilance after approval of the Investigator within the e -CRF or after a standard 
delay.  
• It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical

results, include the laboratory normal ranges.  
• All further data updates should be recorded in the e -CRF as appropriate. In addition, any 
effort should be made to further document each  Serious AE that is fatal or life threatening 
within the week (7 days) following initial notification.  
• A backup plan will be used (using paper flow) when the e -CRF system does not work.  
Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after  the end of the study for the

tightness, stridor, etc ) should be documented on the General Allergic adverse event and/or Local 
Injection Site Reaction Complementary Form.  
All local injection  site reactions should be recorded on the Local Injection Site Reaction 
Compleme ntary Form. However, injection site reactions which progress/expand/worsen/etc 
should be evaluated as recommended in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and the specific General Allergic 
adverse event and/or Local Injection Site Reaction Complementary form should be completed.  
The IMP should be immediately interrupted (temporarily discontinued) if there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_361482] t related to IMP. See Section  10.3.1  for further information on treatment 
interruption and Section  10.3.2  for criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation.

Adverse events  with cutaneous involvement which are obv iously of allergic origin or injection 
site reactions w hich progress/expand/worsen/etc  should be evaluated by a dermatologist as soon 
as possible, and preferably within one week of the site first becoming aware of the event.  
The Investigator should  evaluat e the patient for possible e tiologies (new medications, etc ) and 
extracutaneous symptoms and signs. An unscheduled Central Laboratory assessment for 
hematology, chemistry, liver panel, PK, and ADA should be obtained. If it is possible, the site will

other clinical signs) and in case a skin biopsy (including histopathology and immunofluorescence) 
was done (if it was deemed necessary as per the dermatologist’s or Investigator’s medical 
judgment), the results of this investigation with, if applicable, a specific diagnosis of the AE. The 
Investigator will fax the full report and the corrected AE form if necessary, to the Monitoring 
Team Representative within 24 hours.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Acute allergic injection reactions   
Acute allergic injection reaction (which are considered under the category of general allergic drug 
reactions) is defined  as any adverse event that occurs during or shortly afte r injection of the IMP 
(characterized by [CONTACT_179649], bronchoconstriction, urticaria, edema, 
angioedema, nausea, vomiting). Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of these 
potential adverse effects (eg, antihistamines, bron chodilators, IV saline, corticosteroids, 
acetaminophen, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) must be available for immediate use for the injections at the site 
visits.  
Patients will be observed at the investigational site for at least [ADDRESS_450402] at the randomization visit. Patients should be treated symptomatically if any AEs 
are observed. Patients are to remain at the site until any acute injection reaction is assessed as 
stable, per the Investigator’s discretion. General Allergic Reac tion and/or Local Injection Site 
Reaction Complementary Form will have to be completed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Independent physician monitoring for pat ients reaching LDL -C levels <50  mg/dL 
(1.30  mmol/L) during the double -blind treatment period and recommendations for 
the Invest igator in case of an alert   
An independent physician , that is external to the EFC14643 clinical trial team, will be notified by 
[CONTACT_361572] -C values reaching <50  mg/dL (1.30 mmol/L). The independent 
physician will have access to patient information during the double -blind treatment period that the 
Sponsor’s EFC14643 study team will not have any access to. The independent physician will get 
central laboratory resul ts. The independent physician will review the case in detail including 
unmasked LDL -C values and patient safety data. Based upon the clinical judgment of the 
independent physician, and after consulting with the DMC, the central laboratory may be 
instructed  to send a site alert for corresponding patient. If no site alert is deemed needed, then the 
independent physician will continue to closely monitor th e patient's data throughout the  
double -blind treatment period and may consider instructing the central lab  to issue an alert at any 
time after discussions with the DMC. Further details of this monitoring and responsibilities will 
be thoroughly described in the independent physician related documents and the DMC charter.  
If the site receives an alert, the I nvestigator should follow the recommend steps as outlined below:  
• Call the patient as soon as possible to inquire about interval occurrence of AEs, 
particularly any AEs related to visual problems.

or assessment could be done at the next scheduled visit.  
• At the site visit, pl an for the following, based on I nvestigator’s medical judgment:  
- Assess the need for conducting clinical investigations, arranging specialist 
consult ation(s) as needed, including with an eye specialist in case of visual problems, 
as needed, and any relevant additional work -up, 
-  Assess the need for study treatment temporary or permanent discontinuation, or 
continuation. Regardless of the action taken re garding study treatment, the patient 
should continue the study,  
- Assess the need to have blood drawn from the patient for adrenal gland hormones, 
gonadal hormones, pi[INVESTIGATOR_56356], and fat soluble vitamins if not planned per 
protocol at this visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Recom mendations for managing and monitoring patients with very low LDL -C 
levels (ie, LDL -C<50 mg/dL [1.30 mmol/L]) during the open label treatment period   
If a patient  achieves a very low LDL -C level (ie, LDL -C<50 mg/dL [1.30 mmol/L] on one or 
more occasion) during the OLE period, then the Investigator will:  
• Call the patient/ parent as soon as possible to inquire about interval occurrence of AEs, 
particularly any AEs related to visual pr oblems.  
• Decide whether the patient should be requested to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_56395], 
or assessment could be done at the next scheduled visit.  
• At the site visit, plan for the following, based on Investigator’s medical judgment:  
- Assess the need to have blood drawn from the patient for a repeat lipid assessment in 
order to confirm the observation of very low LDL -C, 
- Assess the need for conducting clinical investigations, arranging specialist 
consultation(s) as needed, including with an eye speciali st in case of visual problems, 
as needed, and any relevant additional work -up,  
- Assess the need for alirocumab treatment temporary or permanent discontinuation, or 
maintenance of the dose or down -titration (if possible) of the dose.  
- Assess the need to hav e blood drawn from the patient for adrenal gland hormones, 
gonadal hormones, pi[INVESTIGATOR_56356], and fat soluble vitamins if not planned per

11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE   
Each  alirocumab dosing regimen group  will be compared to its contemporaneously randomized 
placebo group  (ie, of the same dosing regimen cohort ) as follows : 
• alirocumab Q2W versus placebo Q2W  
• alirocumab Q4W versus placebo Q4W.  
Of note, Q2W and Q4W refer to the dosing regimens initiated at randomization.  
Multiplicity will be controlled using Bonferroni adjustment, hence using a two -sided alpha level  
of 0.025 for each comparison.  
With a randomization ratio of 2:1 (alirocumab: placebo) for each dosing regimen  cohort , a total 
sample size of 90 patients (30 in each alirocumab dosing regimen group and 15  in each placebo 
dosing regimen group) will have 92%  power to detect a difference in mean percent change in 
LDL -C of 30% between each alirocumab dosing regimen group  and its contemporaneously 
randomized placebo dosing regimen group , with a 0.[ADDRESS_450403] deviation (SD) of 25%.  
Nevertheless, to have a sufficient number of pediatric patients for properly assessing the safety 
and tolerability of alirocumab, sample size was increased to 150 patients in total (50 in each 
alirocum ab dosing regimen group and 25 in each placebo dosing regimen group ). The enrollment 
of 150 patients will allow having a safety assessment over 2 years in approximately 128 patients, 
assuming a discontinuation rate of 15%.  
Calculations were made using nQue ry Advisor 7.0.  
11.[ADDRESS_450404] r andomization 
will be used in any analysis population. The safety experience associated with any later

The statistical methods for the analysis of the open label treatment period will be described in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
11.4.1  Extent of study treatment exposure and compliance   
The extent of study treatment exposure and compliance will be assessed and summarized by 
[CONTACT_179650].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Extent of investigational medicinal product exposure   
The total exposure will be assessed by:  
• Duration  of IMP exposure in weeks defined as:  
- For the Q2W dosing regimen  cohort : (last dose of double -blind IMP injection date  - 
first dose of double -blind IMP injection date + 14 d ays)/7, regardless of unplan ned 
intermittent discontinuations.  
- For the Q4W dosing regimen  cohort : (last dose of double -blind IMP injection date - 
first dose of double -blind IMP injection date + 28 days for patients who stopped 
definitively the IMP before t he switch to Q2W regimen at Week 12 (actual or sham) , 
+14 days otherwise )/7, regardless of unplanned  intermittent discontinuations.  
• The total number of injections by [CONTACT_4676].  
The number (n) and percentage (%) of patients with an up-titration in the alirocumab groups will 
be described.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Compliance   
Compliance will be assessed using the following parameters:  
• The injection frequency will be defined for each patient as the average number of days 
between 2 double -blind injections, that is: (last  double -blind dose date - first double -blind 
dose date)/(number of double -blind injections -1). 
This parameter will be summarized descriptively (N, Mean, SD, Median, Min and Max).

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 99 11.4.2  Anal yses of efficacy endpoints   
In the double -blind period, statistical analyses for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints 
will compare each alirocumab dosing regimen group  versus its contemporaneously randomized  
placebo group (ie, of the same  dosing regimen cohort ) as follows : 
• alirocumab Q2W versus placebo Q2W  
• alirocumab Q4W versus placebo Q4W  
Of note, Q2W and Q4W refer to the dosing regimens initiated at randomization.  
Efficacy endpoints analyzed with the ITT estimand will be analyzed in the ITT population. 
Efficacy endpoints analyzed with the on -treatment estimand will be analyzed in the mITT 
population.  
Analyses of the efficacy parameters during the extension period wi ll be only descriptive.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint(s)   
The percent change from baseline in LDL -C (see Section  9.1) to Week [ADDRESS_450407] -baseline data available within 
Week  8 to Week 24 analysis windows will be u sed and missing data will be accounted for by [CONTACT_361573].  
For the Q2W dosing  regimen  cohort , the model will include the fixed categorical effects of 
treatment group (alirocumab , placebo ), randomization strata (previous participation [yes or no] to 
DFI14223 study, baseline body weight [<50 or ≥50 kg]), time point (Week 8, Week 12, 
Week  24), treatment -by-time point interaction, and strata -by-time point interaction, as well as the 
continuous fixed covariates of baseline LDL -C value and baseline value -by-time point interaction.  
The same model will be run for the Q4W dosing regimen cohort  except that strata related to the 
previous participation in the DFI14223 Phase 2 study will not be included in the model , as too few  
patients from this Phase 2 study are enrolled in the Q4W dosing regimen  cohort  due to the late 
start of enrollment in this cohort . 
 Model assumptions for normality will be explored prior to the analysis testing.  
These two model s will be run using SAS Mixed procedure with an unstructured cor relation matrix 
to model the within -patient errors. Parameters will be estimated using restricted maximum 
likelihood method with the Newton -Raphson algorithm. Denominator degrees of freedom will be 
estimated using Satterthwaite’s approximation.  
Throughout the MMRM model s, least -square (LS) mean and standard error (SE) at Week 24 will 
be provided for each treatment group within each dosing regimen cohort and LS means difference 
will be provided for the comparison of each alirocumab dosing regimen group  versu s its 
contemporaneously randomized placebo group (ie, of the same  dosing regimen cohort ), with the 
SE, 97.5%  confidence interval (CI) and p -value, using appropriate contrasts.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints   
Multiple types of measurements are planned to be analyzed (see Section  9.2) during differing time 
points in the trial, specifically continuous measurements expected to have a normal distribution 
(example: percent change in LDL -C), continuous measurements expected to have a non -normal 
distribution (example: TG), and  binary measurements (example: proportion of patients achieving 
a LDL -C <130 mg/dL).  
Continuous endpoints anticipated to have a normal distribution  
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints analyzed with the ITT estimand and anticipated to have 
a normal dist ribution (ie, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_101787](a)) will be analyzed  within each dosing 
regimen  cohort , using the same MMRM model s as for the primary endpoint with the 
corresponding baseline and post -baseline values.  
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints analyzed with the on -treatment estimand and anticipated 
to have a normal distribution will be analyzed using the same MMRM model s within each dosing 
regimen  cohort , but only including on -treatment values. The treatment period is defined as : 
• For the Q2W dosing regimen  cohort , the time period from the first double -blind IMP 
injection up to the day of last double -blind IMP injection +21 days.  
• For the Q4W dosing regimen  cohort , the time period from the first double -blind IMP 
injection up to the day of last doub le-blind IMP injection +35 days for patients who 
stopped definitively the IMP before the switch to Q2W regimen at Week 12 (actual or 
sham),  +[ADDRESS_450409] 
a non -normal distribution (ie, TG and Lp(a)), will be analyzed using a robust regression model 
(ie, ROBUSTREG SAS procedure with M -estimation option) . 
For the Q2W dosing regimen  cohort , the model will include  treatment group (alirocumab, 
placebo)  and randomization strata (previous participation [yes or no] to Phase 2 DFI14223 study, 
baseline body weight [<50 or ≥50 kg])  as main effects and corresponding baseline value as 
covariate.  
For the Q4W dosing regimen  cohort , the model will include treatment group and randomization 
strata (baseline body weight [<50 or ≥50 kg]) as main effects and corresponding baseline value as 
covariate.  
 Missing values will be addressed using a multiple imputation app roach, which will be described 
in the SAP. The imputation model will at least include the variables included in the robust

estimates. The combined mean difference betw een the treatment groups wi ll be provided with the 
SE, 97.5%  CI and p -value.  
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints analyzed with the on -treatment estimand and anticipated 
to have a non -normal distribution will be analyzed using the same imputation and analysis models 
within each dosing regimen  cohort  but only including on -treatme nt values in these models.  
Binary endpoints  
Binary secondary efficacy endpoints analyzed with the ITT estimand will be analyzed using 
stratified logistic regression . 
For the Q2W dosing regimen cohort , the model will include  treatment group (alirocumab, 
placebo)  as main effect and corresponding baseline value as covariate, stratified by [CONTACT_361574]  (previous participation [yes or no] to DFI14223 study, baseline body weight [<50 or 
≥50 kg]). 
For the Q4W dosing regimen cohort , the model will include treatment group (alirocumab, 
placebo) as main effect and corresponding baseline value as covariate, stratified by [CONTACT_361575] (baseline body weight [<50 or ≥50 kg]).  
Missing values will be addressed using a multiple imputation approach which will  be described in 
the SAP. The imputation model will at least include the variables included in the logistic 
regression model. Treatment effects  (within each dosing regimen  cohort ) will be compared and 
the combined odds ratio estimate between the treatment groups, with their corresponding 
97.5%  CIs and p -value will be provided.  
In the data dependent case that the logistic regression method is not applicable (eg, the response 
rate is zero in [ADDRESS_450410]), the 
Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) approach would be used for handling of missing 
values and a stratified exact conditional logistic regression would be performed to compare 
treatment effects.  
Binary secondary efficacy endpoints analyzed wi th the on -treatment estimand will be analyzed 
using the same imputation and analysis models within each dosing regimen  cohort  but only 
including on -treatment values in these models.  
In addition, the difference in terms of percent change from baseline in LD L-C between the 
2 alirocumab dosing regimen  groups  will be explored.  
Analyses of the efficacy parameters during the extension period will be only descriptive.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Multiplicity considerations   
The Bonferroni adjustment will be applied to handle multiplicity for the comparison of each 
alirocumab dosing regimen group versus its contemporaneously randomized placebo group

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 102 (ie, alirocumab Q4W versus placebo Q4W and alirocumab Q2W versus placebo Q2W)  for the 
primary efficacy endpoint  (0.025 two -sided alpha level will apply for each comparison ). 
In order to handle multiple key secondary endpoints, the overall Type-I error wil l be controlled by 
[CONTACT_2224] a sequential inferential approach applied  independently within each dosing regimen 
cohort  (Q2W and Q4W ). Statistical significance of the primary pa rameter at the 2-sided 
0.[ADDRESS_450411] key secondary parameter (refer to order of list in Section  9.2.1 ). Inferential conclusions 
about successive key secondary parameters for a given dosing regimen cohort require statistical 
significance of the prior one in that dosing regimen  cohort .  
The Bon ferroni adjustment  and this fixed hierarchical approach will ensure a strong control of the 
overall Type-I error rate for the study at the 0.05 level.  
No further adjustments will be made for other secondary endpoints for which p -values will be 
provided for  descriptive purpose only (no claim).  
11.4.3  Analyses of safety data   
The summary of safety results (see Section  9.2.4 ) will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]  (placebo , 
alirocumab) within each dosing regimen cohort , and by [CONTACT_361576]  (pooled across the cohorts) . No formal inferential testing will be performed. 
Summaries will be descriptive in nature.  
All safety analyses will be performed on the safety population using the following common rule:  
• The baseline value is defined as the las t available value before first double -blind IMP 
injection . 
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters, and vital signs.  
• The potentially clinically significant abnormality (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal 
values considered medically important by [CONTACT_56493]/thresholds based on literature review and defined by [CONTACT_326932], and vital signs.  
• PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSA during the TEAE period, 
taking into account all evaluations performed during the TEAE period, including 
unscheduled or repeated evaluations. The number of all such patients will be the 
numerator for the PCSA percentage.  
• Treatment period: the treatment period used for  quantitative analysis is defined : 
- For the Q2W dosing regimen  cohort , as the time from first dose of double -blind IMP 
injection to the last dose of double -blind IMP injection +[ADDRESS_450412] dose of double -blind IMP injection +35 days for patients who 
stopped definitively the IMP before the switch to Q2W regimen at Week 12 (actual or 
sham),  +21 days otherwise

The Tanner stages assessment for each patient at each site should be performed, if possible by [CONTACT_361591]/designee trai ned to assess pubertal development ( 1, 2). 
• Boys - development of external genitalia  
- Stage 1 : Pre-adolescent. Testes, scrotum, and penis are of about the same size and 
proportion as in early childhood.  
- Stage 2 : The scrotum and testes have enlarged and there is a change in the texture of 
the scrotal skin. There is also some reddening of the scrotal skin.  
- Stage 3 : Growth of the penis has occurred, at first mainly in length but with some 
increase in breadth. There  has been further growth of testes and scrotum.  
- Stage 4 : Penis further enlarged in length and breadth with development of glans. 
Testes and scrotum further enlarged. There is also further darkening of the scrotal skin.  
- Stage 5 : Genitalia adult in size and shape. No further enlargement takes place after 
Stage 5 is reached.  
• Girls - breast development  
- Stage 1 : Pre-adolescent; elevation of papi[INVESTIGATOR_141877].  
- Stage 2 : Breast bud stage; elevation of breast and papi[INVESTIGATOR_361491] a small mound, 
enlargement of areola diameter.  
- Stage 3 : Further enlargement of breast and areola, with no separation of their contours.  
- Stage 4 : Projection of areola and papi[INVESTIGATOR_361492] a secondary mound above the level of 
the breast.  
- Stage 5 : Mature stage; projection of papi[INVESTIGATOR_141877], due to recession of the areola to the 
general contour of the breast.  
• Boys/Girls - pubic hair  
- Stage 1 : Pre-adolescent; the vellus over the pubes is not further developed than that 
over the anterior abdominal wall, ie, no pubic hair.  
- Stage 2 : Sparse growth of long, slightly  pi[INVESTIGATOR_49194], downy hair, straight or only 
slightly curled, appearing chiefly at the base of the penis (boys) or along the labia 
(girls).  
- Stage 3 : Considerably darker, coarser, and more curled. The hair spreads sparsely over 
the junction of the pubes.  
- Stage 4: Hair is now adult in type, but the area covered by [CONTACT_361592]. There is no spread to the medial surface of the thighs.  
- Stage 5 : Adult in quantity and type, distributed as an inverse triangle of the classically  
feminine pattern (girls). Spread to the medial surface of the thighs, but not up the linea 
alba or elsewhere above the base of the inverse triangle.

locations. Each box represents move locations, and the grid refers to the box array 
(ie, 10 × 10). Subjects are required to find the hidden pathway guided by  [CONTACT_83973]. 
These rules are: do not move diagonally, do not move more than one box (ie,  do not 
jump), do not move back on the pathway, and  return to the last correct location after an 
error.  At each step only the most recently selected box is shown. Feedback is given with 
visual and auditory cues (green check marks and red crosses) to indica te whether the 
selected box is correct or incorrect. The head of path, or the last correct location, flashes 
with a green check when two errors are made in succession to indicate to the subject that 
they must return to this location. There are  [20] well-matched alternate pathways 
available. The software records each move as an error or as a correct move.

(FMD ) Sub -study  
SUBSTUDY PROTOCOL ACKNOWLEDGEMEN T 
I have read this exploratory sub -study of EFC14643 protocol: FMD sub -study, and understand 
that it and an accompanying additional informed consent must be reviewed by [CONTACT_98405]/Ethics Committee overseeing the conduct of the study and  approved or given 
favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_151580].  
Introduction  
The healthy endothelium plays a principal role in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_361494]. Many of its 
functions are controlled by [CONTACT_361594], including inflammation, a dhesion, 
coagulation, smooth muscle cell proliferation, and vasomotion ( 1). The vascular endothelial layer 
has anti -atherogenic properties. However, this physiological atheroprotective function of the 
endothelium can be diminished in the presence of atherosclerotic risk factors and toxic substances 
and conditions ( 2). The diminution of endothelial function may play a role in atherogenesis, which 
may occur before structural and clinical atherosclerosis ( 3). In addition to being an early event in 
atherogenesis, endothelial dysfunction is influential in the later stages of atherosclerotic dis eases, 
predisposing individuals to complications, such as thrombotic events. Endothelial dysfunction is 
characterized by [CONTACT_361595]/or 
increased degradation of nitric oxide. Even with adequate p roduction, nitric oxide may not reach 
its biological targets (vascular smooth muscle and circulating cells) to exert its effect because of 
the lack of its bioavailability. In hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], excess LDL synthesis increases the formation of 
oxidized LDL. The  resultant increase of oxidative stress enhances nitric oxide destruction, thereby 
[CONTACT_361596] -dependent vasodilation ( 4).  
Flow -mediated dilatation (FMD) measures the vasomotor ef fects of this modification in the 
phenotype  of the arterial wall and can therefore be used to study the vascular biology of 
atherosclerosis as it progresses from childhood ( 5). Over the past several decades, a noninvasive 
techni que has matured to evaluate FMD, an endothelium -dependent function, in the brachial 
artery. This stimulus incites the endothelium to release nitric oxide (NO) with resultant 
vasodilation that can be imaged and quantitated as an index of vasomotor function (6). The use of 
ultrasound to assess FMD is noninvasive, and safe and has been applied in prior clinical trial in a 
similar setting ( 7). The test is based on the measurement of the brachial artery dia meter at baseline 
and after an increase in blood flow caused by [CONTACT_361597] a forearm blood pressure 
cuff. In this test, the proportional increase in luminal diameter induced by [CONTACT_361598] a marker of systemic endo thelial function.  
In the general population, several risk factors that are associated with CVD such as hypertension, 
diabetes, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hyperhomocysteinemia, inflammation, advanced age, and cigarette 
smoking have been associated with impairment in FMD prior to vascular disease ( 8).

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 132 Improvement in endothelial function has been noted following statin treatment in adults with 
coronary artery disease and in asymptomatic patients with cardiovascular risk factors ( 9). While 
most factors, which improve endothelial function, have been shown to be of cardiovascular 
benefit, exceptions  include antioxidant supplementation and hormone replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
These [ADDRESS_450439] of cholesterol on endothelial function was initially observed in pediatric 
patients with heFH from as early as 8 years of age ( 4). In this s tudy, the degree of endothelial 
impairment as measured by [CONTACT_361599] -C and Lp(a) levels. Other studies have also shown that children with heFH have reduced 
endothelial function (as measured by [CONTACT_17501]) as compared to healthy controls and that the degree of 
endothelial function was worse in the patients who had a family history of premature CVD ( 8). 
Early simvastatin therapy of 10 to 40 mg daily restores endothelial function in  28 weeks in 9 - to 
18-year-old children with heFH ( 10) as measured by [CONTACT_361600]. However,

Primary o bjective  
To explore the effect of alirocumab versus placebo on endothelial function after 24  weeks of 
treatment  in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) patients aged of 8 to 17 years on 
optimal stable daily dose of statin therapy ± other lipid modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (LMTs) or a stable 
dose of non -statin LMTs in case of intolerance to statins.  
Study d esign  
Select sites from the EFC14643 trial, will be asked to participate in the sub -study. Study centers 
that have access to the assessment of FMD will be approached. These centers that are willing to 
take part in the sub -study must undergo further qualification. Sites selected to participate in the 
sub-study will have IRB/EC a pproval for the main EFC14643 study and for the sub -study and an 
additional informed consent.  
Patients  who have provided signed informed consent for the main study of the EFC14643 trial at 
these select sites will be asked to participate in the sub -study. The participation in the sub -study is 
voluntary and declining participation in the sub -study does not prevent participation in the main 
study. Once the additional written informed consent is obtained for the sub -study and if patients 
fulfil the additional eligibility criteria for the sub -study, then they will undergo a baseline FMD 
assessment during the screening period. The patients will undergo a second FMD assessment at 
Week 24.  
A standardized setting for testing will be implemented ( 11). Experienced ultrasonographers who 
will be involved  in image acquisition will be trained prior to undertaking FMD assessments. The 
same scanning protocol will be employed at all sites. The same trained ultrasonographer should 
perform the FMD assessment at baseline and Week 24 on the patient, if at all poss ible. A central 
reading lab will review and analyze the images. Details will be provided in separate study related

assessment can be done at Week -2, Week -1 or another day of the screening period, or on Day  1, 
but prior to randomization into the main EFC14643 study. The Week 24 FMD assessment can be 
done on the same day as the Week 24 visit or at an alter native day corresponding to the time 
window (+/ - 3 days) of the main EFC14643 study. However, the Week [ADDRESS_450441] access to an ultras ound system with specific equipment requirements as 
detailed in the study related documents. The same scanning protocol (which will be provided in 
study related documents) will be implemented across sites. During the procedure, the subject will 
be supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] w ith the arm in a comfortable and outstretched position. A sphymomanometric cuff or 
equivalent will be placed on the forearm. After the patient has an adequate period of rest (which 
will be standardized), a baseline rest image and associated data will be ac quired by [CONTACT_361604]. Thereafter, arterial occlusion is created by [CONTACT_361605]. Deflation of the 
cuff or equivalent will induce a brief high flow state through the brachial artery (reactive 
hyperemia) to accommodate the resistanc e vessels. The resulting increase in shear stress causes 
the brachial artery to dilate. An image and associated data will be acquired during this reactive 
hyperemia period. The total duration of the FMD assessment at either baseline or Week 24 is 
expected to be approximately 30 minutes.

declared by a governmental agency   
A regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency (eg, public health 
emergency, natural di saster, pandemic, and terrorist attack) may prevent access to the clinical trial 
site. 
Remote monitoring, also referred to as off -site monitoring, enables clinical research associates 
Site Monitor (SM ) to remote ly conduct monitoring activities without physically traveling to the 
site. 
Deploying remote monitoring, inclusive of remote source data verification, should always be 
driven by [CONTACT_361609].  
Due to levels of safety informatio n required for the EFC14643 study, attempts should be made to 
perform all assessments in accordance with the approved protocol to the extent possible. In case 
this is not possible due to a temporary disruption caused by [CONTACT_13193], focus should be given 
to assessments necessary to ensure the safety of participants and those important to preserving the 
main scientific value of the study . 
The decision for each individual participant to remain on treatment and/or in the study should be 
made on a case by [CONTACT_361610]. The clinical judgment 
of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each participant based on 
individual benefit/risk assessment and the evolving situation at the site.  
Procedures to be co nsidered in the event of a regional or national emergency declared by a 
governmental agency:  
• If onsite visits are not possible, remote visits (eg , with home nurses, home health vendor, 
etc) may be planned for the collection of possible safety and efficacy data as listed below:  
- Blood sampling for LDL -C at baseline, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 24  
- Blood sampling for lipid parameters (Apo B, non -HDL -C, Total -C, Lp(a), TG, 
HDL -C, and Apo A -1) at baseline, Week 8, Week 12 and Week 24  
- AE collection reported, including AE complementary forms  
- injection site reactions  
- Laboratory parameters - adrenal gland hormones; gonadal and pi[INVESTIGATOR_56356]  
- Collection of weight at Day 1, at Week 24 (time of dose evaluation) and after Week [ADDRESS_450450] patient visit  
- Blood sampling for PK and ADA parameters at any visit  
• If onsite visits are not possible, remote visit windows may be extended for assessments of 
any of the data listed abo ve that cannot be obtained remotely  within the visit window 
planned per protocol  
• Use of local clinic or laboratory locations may be allowed for the laboratory procedures 
from the list above  except for lipid parameters during the double -blind treatment peri od 
• Contingencies implemented due to emergency will be documented.

The Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes Table for the current amended protocol 03  is 
located directly before Clinical Trial Summary . 
AMENDED PROTOCOL 02 (02 -JAN-2019)  
This amended protocol (amendment 02) is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set 
forth in Article 10 (a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union because it either significantly impacts the safety or physical integrity of 
participants or the scientific value of the study.   
OVERALL RATIONALE FOR THE AMENDMENT  
The main reason for this protocol amendment is to incl ude the Q4W dosing regimen alongside the 
Q2W dosing regimen currently ongoing. This Q4W dosing regimen should be applicable to 
approximately half of the heFH patients to be randomized in the Phase 3 EFC14643 study 
(ie, approximately 75 patients).  
The selec tion of the Q2W dosing regimen currently evaluated in this Phase 3 EFC14643 study 
was based on the results of the Phase 2 DFI14223 study, as described in Section 4 - Introduction 
and Rationale. This Phase 2 study was an 8 week open label, sequential, repea ted dose -finding 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in children and adolescents with heFH 
through 3 cohorts, initially; the repeated dose -finding study was followed by [CONTACT_361611]. Two body weight (BW) categories (BW <50 kg and BW ≥50 kg) were used and 
patients were treated with a fixed dosage of alirocumab in each BW category according to the 
evaluated cohort, as described below:  
• Cohort 1: 30 mg Q2W for BW <50 kg and 50 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg.  
• Cohort 2: 40 mg Q2W for BW <50 kg and 75 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg.  
• Cohort 3: 75 mg Q4W for BW <50 kg and 150 mg Q4W for BW ≥[ADDRESS_450451] 3 cohorts, doses of the Cohort 2 were selected for the Q2W regimen since the results 
observed were those expected to provide an overall reduction in LDL -C of -46.1%. Consistent 
reductions were seen across the 2 doses ranging from -40.6% to -49.8% for 40 mg Q2W and 
75 mg Q2W, respectively.  
For the Q4W dosing re gimen no formal conclusion could be drawn given the unexpected results 
observed in Cohort 3. The doses evaluated were likely not high enough to achieve larger and 
sustained reductions in the LDL -C over the entire dosing interval in children receiving stati n as 
background therapy. Therefore, an additional cohort (Cohort 4) was added in the 
Phase 2 DFI14223 study to evaluate further the Q4W dose regimen using higher doses of 
150 mg/300 mg Q4W depending on the BW category.  

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 03   06-Jan-2021  
EFC14643  - alirocumab  Version number: 1 
Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 149 Regarding this Cohort 4, the primary  efficacy endpoint as measured by [CONTACT_361612] -C at Week 8 showed a comparable reduction to that observed in Cohort 2 with a 
mean LS change from baseline of -46.1% and -44.5% for Cohort 2 and Cohort 4, respectively. 
Substantial r eductions were seen in both BW categories ranging from -31.9% for 150 mg  Q4W in 
the lower BW category to -59.8 % for 300 mg Q4W in the higher BW category. Overall, 
alirocumab was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile in this additional cohort over  the 
open label dose finding and the open label extension (OLDFI/OLE) combined period, as already 
observed in the first [ADDRESS_450452] been 
deemed efficacious and to be adequately safe, and therefore will be also evaluated in the 
Phase  3 EFC14643 study. Similar to what is done in the study for the Q2W dosing regimen, a 
dose-adjus tment will be allowed to optimize the response as needed. Rules for the  
dose-adjustment will be similar to those applied for the Q2W dosing regimen as shown below:  
Patients enrolled in the Q4W alirocumab dosing regimen will receive:  
• 150 mg Q4W for BW <50 k g or,  
• 300 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg.  
At Week 12:  
• If the Week 8 LDL -C is <110 mg/dL (2.85 mmol/L), patients will continue alirocumab 
150 mg or 300 mg Q4W according to BW category.  
• If the Week 8 LDL -C is ≥110 mg/dL (2.85 mmol/L), patients will have a change in t he 
dose from 150 mg Q4W to 75 mg Q2W or from 300mg Q4W to 150 mg Q2W, in a 
blinded manner.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 152 Amended protocol 01 (13 -Sep-2018)  
This amended protocol (amendment 01) is considered to be nonsubstantial based on the criteria 
set forth in Article 10 (a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 
the European Union because it neither significantly impacts the safety or physical integrity of 
participants nor the scientific value of the study.  
OVERALL RATIONALE FOR THE AMENDMENT  
The protocol description of the independent physician  is being revised to show that he/she is 
external to the EFC14643 study, and not necessarily external to the Sponsor.  
Since the main purpose of using an independent physician involved in the monitoring of patients 
reaching LDL -C levels <50 mg/dL (1.30 mmol /L) during the [ADDRESS_450454] an individual that is not part of the EFC14643 study team, the Sponsor’s initial 
intention was to use a physician part of an academic group, however the attempt to implement 
such a process wit hin the study teams predetermined timelines was not possible. As a result, the 
Sponsor will use physicians within the company who are not part of the EFC14643 study team 
and as well not involved in any alirocumab activities. The protocol is revised accordi ngly to 
clarify that other physicians can be involved in the process of this monitoring, as long as they are 
external to the EFC14643 study team and any alirocumab activities. This change will allow the 
Sponsor to respect the objectives set forth in the or iginal protocol with regard to the monitoring of 
patients reaching LDL -C levels <50 mg/dL (1.30 mmol/L) during the [ADDRESS_450455] been received from t he Norwegian and Argentinian regulatory agencies for 
monthly pregnancy tests on all female patients of childbearing potential throughout the entire 
study in accordance to the clinical trials facilitation group (CTFG) guideline on 
“Recommendations related t o contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials”. As a result, 
in these countries logistic aspects will be arranged to allow urine pregnancy tests to be performed 
by [CONTACT_361613] -between clinic visits.  
In addition, parts of the protoco l inadvertently state that a separate informed consent form should 
be used for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. However, the consent 
for heFH genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_361500] 
(CSICF), therefore relevant sections in the protocol are being revised accordingly for clarification 
purpose. Also in the description of the two -step analysis in the Section 6.3 and Section 11.5, 
revision of the text is done with removal of the sentence “Th e results of the first step analysis will 
not be used to change the conduct of the ongoing study in any aspect”. In the context of the design 
of the study (double -blind period followed by [CONTACT_361614]) this sentence is not 
appropriate sin ce the double -blind period will be completed at the time of the first step analysis 
with the final comparison between the 2 treatment groups, therefore there will be no bias in this 
comparison.

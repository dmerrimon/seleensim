1. SYNOPSIS
Title of Study :  Open-Label Rollover Study for Continuing Valbenazine (NBI-[ZIP_CODE]) 
Administration for the Treatment of Tardive Dyskinesia  
Study Number:  NBI-[ZIP_CODE]  
Study Centers:  Approximately 40 centers in [LOCATION_002].  
Objectives:  
The objectives of this study are:  
•To provide continued access to valbenazine  for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia (TD) in
approximately [ADDRESS_859072] completed a Phase 3 valbenazine study.
•To collect long -term safety and tolerability data in subjects receiving valbenazine (40  mg or
80 mg) administered once daily for up to 72 weeks (18 months).
Study Design:  This rollover study will provide subjects who completed a Phase 3 valbenazine 
(NBI-[ZIP_CODE]) study open- label access to valbenazine for the treatment of  TD until valbenazine is  
anticipated to be available commercially  or they complete [ADDRESS_859073] -reported 
information  following chronic administration of valbenazine in subjects with TD.  
This is a rollover study with open- label, fixed -doses of valbenazine (40 mg or 80 mg) administered 
once daily (qd) for a total of up to [ADDRESS_859074] their final NBI -[ZIP_CODE] or NBI-[ZIP_CODE] visit on the same day as Day 1 for th is rollover 
study provided they sign the current study’s informed consent before the final NBI-[ZIP_CODE] or 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] visit.  This will allow certain safety assessments to be used for both studies.  The 
safety assessment results that can apply to bot h studies include physical examinations (including 
weight), vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECG).  
All subjects must sign an informed consent form (ICF) prior to the conduct of any study- related 
procedures, including washout of medications disallowed i n the study.  Before subjects can provide 
informed consent, the investigator (or designee) must determine whether the subject has the capacity to provide consent for participation using the University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego Brief Assessment of 
Capacity to Consent (UBACC).  Only subjects who are deemed to have the capacity to provide 
consent may sign the ICF.  
On Day 1, eligible subjects will receive a supply of valbenazine [ADDRESS_859075] 4 weeks of the 
treatment period.  On Day 2, valbenazine will be administered at home (in the presence of their caregiver, if applicable) in the morning or evening.  After Day 2, the subject will be directed to  take 
their dose at about the same time each day (eg, morning or evening ). 
At the end of Week 4, the i nvestigator may escalate the subject’s dose to [ADDRESS_859076]’s current dose (40 mg qd).  A dose escalation will be allowed at the end of Week 4 based on the physician investigator’s (or designee’s) assessments of the safety and tole rability of 
valbenazine as well as clinical impression of TD.  
At any time after dose escalation, the investigator may decrease the dose to [ADDRESS_859077] will continue at this dose (40 mg) until t he end of the 
treatment period (end of Week 72).  Subjects who are unable to tolerate the starting dose of [ADDRESS_859078] a visit win dow of -7 or +2 days. 
Study Population:  Approximately  [ADDRESS_859079] be psychiatrically stable as 
determined clinically by [CONTACT_263814], including a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) 
score of <50 at Day 1.  
Duration of treatment and study participation:  The expected duration of study participation for 
each subject is up to [ADDRESS_859080], dosage, and mode of administration:  Valbenazine will be supplied in 
capsule form containing 40 mg (free base equivalent) of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] as the ditosylate salt.   The doses 
that will be used in this study are: [ADDRESS_859081] will be directed to take their dose at about the same time each day .  If treatment 
is interrupted for ≤5 missed consecutive doses , subjects are allowed to resume with their current dose 
regimen (40 mg qd or 80 mg  qd).  If treatment is interrupted for >[ADDRESS_859082] the investigator before resuming treatment; subjects deemed clinically stable 
by [CONTACT_641794] (40 mg qd or 80 mg qd). 
Reference therapy, dosage , and mode of administ ration:  Not applicable.  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy: 
• Clinical Global Impression of TD-severity (CGI-TD-severity) will be completed by [CONTACT_641795] (Day  1) and at the end of Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 or upon 
early termination.  
Safety: 
Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study and will include the following 
assessments:  
• Adverse events . 
• Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis) . 
• Vital signs (including orthostatic blood pressure and pulse). 
• Physical examinations. 
• 12-lead electrocardiogram . 
• Suicidal ideation and behavior – evaluated using the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS). 
Additional assessments: 
• Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_218626] (Day 1) and at 
the end of Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 or upon early termination. 
• The Social Functioning Scale ( SFS) will be completed by [CONTACT_218626] (Day 1) and 
at the end of Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 or upon early termination.  
Statistical methods:   Efficacy, safety , tolerability , and additional assessments  will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics.

3. ETHICS 
The study will be conducted in accordance with Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NBI) standards 
that meet regulations relating to Good Clinical Practice s (GCP).  These standards respect the 
following guidelines:  
• Good Clinical Practice:  Consolidated Guideline (International Conference on Harmonisation 
of Technical Requirements for the Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, May 
1996). 
• [LOCATION_002] (US) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) regulating  clinical studies (21 CFR 
parts 50, 54, 56, 312, and 314). 
The ethical requirements of Institutional Review Boards/Ethics Committees (IRBs/ECs) and the Informed Consent Forms (ICFs) are discussed in Section  13. 
4. INTRODUCTION   
4.1. Background  
Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a neurological condition characterized by [CONTACT_535426] (ie, tongue, lips, jaw, face), limbs, and trunk.  TD develops with chronic 
neuroleptic drug use and often persists after discontinuation of the offending medication.  Only a 
small proportion of patients who are treated with dopamine receptor blocking drugs develop this syndrome.  While isolated case reports of TD after short -term exposure exist, most often TD 
emerges after long -term neuroleptic treatment over months to years.  The Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5) defines chronic exposure to 
neuroleptics and duration of symptoms as the basis for TD diagnosis.  In addition to duration and 
amount of neuroleptic exposure, other risk factors for TD appear to include older age, 
schizophrenia, and cognitive impairment ( Margolese et al, 2005 ).  TD can be disabling, lead to 
bodily harm (eg, lip or tongue lacerations, falls), interfere with activities of daily living, and 
result in social isolation.  
The pathophysiology of TD is not fully understood; however, post-synaptic dopamine 
hypersensitivity in the striatum is the mos t prominent feature (Margolese et al., 2005).  
Dysregulation of dopaminergic systems is an integral component of several CNS disorders, including other hyperkinetic movement disorders and conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  The transporter protein vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) plays an 
important role in presynaptic dopamine release, regulating monoamine uptake from the 
cytoplasm to the synaptic vesicle for storage and release.  The differential expression of VMAT2 in human br ain (versus endocrine tissue) makes agents that selectively target VMAT2 potentially 
useful for the treatment of CNS disorders ( Weihe and Eiden, 2000).  
4.2. Valbenazine ( NBI-[ZIP_CODE])  
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] (valbenazine tosylate) is a highly selective, orally active VMAT2 inhibitor and is 
currently under development at Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NBI) for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia (TD) and Tourette syndrome (TS).

In nonclinical studies, NBI-[ZIP_CODE] appears to cause little or no cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme 
inhibition or induction at pharmacologically relevant concentrations.  Metabolism of NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 
is characterized by [CONTACT_263817] -[ZIP_CODE] to NBI-[ZIP_CODE], and CYP3A4/5-dependent mono-
oxidation to NBI-136110.  All [ADDRESS_859090] potent and 
appears to be responsible for the majority of the observed pharmacological activity of VMAT2 
inhibition.  NBI-[ZIP_CODE] delivers NBI-[ZIP_CODE] in a controlled fashion w ith limited peak -to-trough 
plasma concentration fluctuation and low pharmacokinetic (PK) variability that should limit 
adverse events (AEs) associated with excessive monoamine depletion.  Repeat-dose nonclinical 
toxicology studies conducted in mice, rats, and dogs have revealed no adverse effects at doses of 
60 mg/kg/day in the mouse, 3 mg/kg/day in the rat and 15 mg/kg/day in the dog.  Additionally, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and central nervous system (CNS) safety pharmacology studies have 
also been condu cted, where the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was equal to or 
exceeded the 15 mg/kg level seen in repeat dose toxicology studies.  NBI-[ADDRESS_859091] on rat fertility at 10 mg/kg/day (NOAEL of 3 mg/kg/day).  The NOAEL for 
embryo/fetal development in rats and rabbits was 15 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
There was no evidence of teratogenicity in rats or rabbits.  Finally, NBI -[ZIP_CODE] was negative in 
in vitro mutagenicity assays (namely, Ames and chromosomal aberration) and an in vivo rat 
micronucleus test.  
Thirteen clinical studies with NBI -[ADDRESS_859092] been completed to date:  9 Phase 1 studies, 8 in 
healthy male and female elderly and nonelderly subjects, and 1 in hepatically impaired adults; and 4 Phase 2 studies in subjects with TD and a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder, or gastrointestinal (GI) disorder.  In addition, 
preliminary data are available for the [ADDRESS_859093] 1 dose of NBI-[ZIP_CODE] and 246 received placebo in these studies.  
Clinical PK data indic ate that when administered orally under fasted conditions, NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 
appeared to be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_641789] 1 hour.  An active metabolite, NBI-[ZIP_CODE], was formed gradually with maximum plasma 
concentration typi[INVESTIGATOR_641790] 4 to 10 hours after dosing.  Plasma concentrations for both NBI-[ZIP_CODE] and NBI-[ZIP_CODE] appeared to decline after reaching maximal concentration and both 
exhibited an apparent terminal half -life of approximately 20 hours in non- elderly adult subjects 
and 23 to 28 hours in elderly subjects.  Coadministration of ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor) with NBI -[ZIP_CODE] caused an approximate 1.5- and 1.7-fold increase in C
max of 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] and NBI-[ZIP_CODE], respectively.  Coadministration of NBI-[ZIP_CODE] and rifampin (strong 
CYP3A4/5 inducer) led to an approximate 29% and 72% decrease in C max and AUC 0–∞, 
respectively, for NBI -[ZIP_CODE], and an approximate 50% and 77% decrease, respectively, for 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] compared with administration of NBI-[ZIP_CODE] alone.  For NBI -136110, concomitant 
administration with rifampin led to a 50% increase in Cmax and a 68% decrease in AUC 0–∞ 
compared with administration of NBI-[ZIP_CODE] alone.  Administration in subjects with hepatic 
impairment resulted in a Cmax of NBI-[ZIP_CODE] of 1.46- and 1.65- fold greater in subjects with 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, than in subjects with normal hepatic 
function.

NBI-[ZIP_CODE] has been generally well tolerated in single doses up to 300 mg and in multiple doses 
of up to 100 mg.  In Phase 2 studies and the interim analysis from one Phase 3 study, treatment-
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 42.8% and 36.4% of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] and 
placebo subjects, respectively.  AEs reported in ≥2% of NBI-[ZIP_CODE] subjects and at a higher 
incidence than placebo included somnolence, headache, fatigue, vomiting, dry mouth, akathisia, 
and fall.  Suicidal ideation was reported in a similar percentage of subjects receiving NBI -[ZIP_CODE] 
or placebo (2.0% and 1.9%, respectively).  Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity.  Two deaths have been reported in clinical studies; [ADDRESS_859094] died possibly 
due to a cardiovascular event (treatment rem ains blinded).  No treatment-emergent serious AEs 
(SAEs) have been reported in Phase 1 studies.  In Phase 2 studies and the interim analysis from 
one Phase 3 study, SAEs were reported in 17 subjects (4.9%) who received NBI-[ZIP_CODE] and 
6 subjects (2.8%) who received placebo.  There were no clinically important differences in the number or types of SAEs reported across dose groups.  Only 1 SAE (acute hepatitis) was 
assessed by [CONTACT_188180].  No cardiovascular, laboratory, or 
vital sign related safety signals have been identified.  Increases in serum prolactin above normal laboratory ranges have been noted, but there have been no TEAEs associated with 
hyperprolactinemia.  In general, depression, drug-induced akathisia, and dr ug-induced 
parkinsonism did not worsen during treatment with NBI-[ZIP_CODE]. 
Results from Phase 2 studies indicated an improvement in the Abnormal Involuntary Movement 
Scale (AIMS) score after 6 weeks of continuous dosing with either NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 50 mg once daily, 
continuous dosing with NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 100 mg once daily for 2 weeks followed by [CONTACT_641796]-[ZIP_CODE] 50 mg once daily for 4 weeks (NBI-[ZIP_CODE]; preliminary data), 
6 weeks of titrated doses from 25 mg up to 75 mg NBI-[ZIP_CODE] once daily (NBI-[ZIP_CODE]).  
Preliminary results from the 6 -week placebo -controlled treatment period in the Phase 3 study 
(NBI-[ZIP_CODE]) indicated a statistically significant improvement in the AIMS dyskinesia total 
score mean change from baseline for the NBI -[ZIP_CODE] 80 mg group compared with placebo.  
Similar results were also observed for the NBI -[ZIP_CODE] 40 mg group.  Results from an open- label 
safety extension with dosing up to 12 weeks (NBI-[ZIP_CODE]) showed continued benefit in 
subjects who continued taking NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 50 mg daily and also in subjects originally assigned to 
placebo who went on to receive NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 50 mg once daily for the 6 weeks of open- label 
treatment.  Results from the 6 week dose- titration study (NBI -[ZIP_CODE]) showed a statistically 
significant reduction in the AIMS dyskinesia total score in the NBI -[ZIP_CODE] group compared to 
placebo.  A statistically significant higher responder rate (ie, ≥50% improvement in AIMS dyskinesia total score from baseline) was also observed in the NBI -[ADDRESS_859095] previously received valbenazine 40 mg to 80 mg for 
42 to 48 weeks in a Phase 3 valbenazine study  (NBI-[ZIP_CODE] or NBI-[ZIP_CODE]).  In the 
current study, subjects will receive a starting dose of valbenazine 40 mg once daily (qd) for 
[ADDRESS_859096]’s dose to [ADDRESS_859097]’s current dose (40 mg qd ).  A dose escalation will be allowed at the end 
of Week 4 based on the physician investigator’s (or designee’s) assessments of the safety and 
tolerability  of valbenazine as well as clinical impression of TD.  
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Protocol No. NBI-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_859098] will continue at this dose (40 mg) until the 
end of the treatment period (end of Week 72).  Subjects who are unable to tolerate the starting 
dose of 40 mg or the resumption of 40 mg will be discontinued from the study. 
Clinical data from TD subjects administered repeated doses of valbenazine from 12.5 mg to 
100 mg per day indicate that valbenazine is generally well tolerated and associated with 
dose-related efficacy.  Exposure- response analysis indicates that a steady state maximum plasma 
concentration  (Cmax) of 20 to 40 ng/mL NBI-[ZIP_CODE] is an appropriate plasma concentration range 
for efficacy.   
Valbenazine doses of 40 mg and 80 mg are associated with exposure to the active metaboli te, 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE], in the target range of 20 to 40 ng/mL when administered initially as [ADDRESS_859099] little incremental benefit but increase the risk of adverse 
events (AEs) reflecting extension of VMAT2 pharmacology.  Because many subject -specific 
factors appear to influence tolerability and efficacy, clinicians w ill be required  to start all 
subjects at 40 mg, the lower of the two doses. 
5. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The objectives of this study are : 
• To provide continued access of valbenazine for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia (TD) 
in approximately  [ADDRESS_859100] completed a Phase 3 valbenazine study. 
• To collect long -term safety and tolerab ility data in subjects receiving valbenazine (40 mg  
or 80 mg) administered once daily for up to 72 weeks (18 months). 
6. STUDY DESIGN 
This rollover study will provide subjects who completed a Phase [ADDRESS_859101] -reported information following 
chronic administration of valbenazine in subjects with TD.   
This is a rollover study with open- label, fixed -doses of valbenazine (40 mg qd or 80 mg  qd) for a 
total of up to [ADDRESS_859102] their final 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] or NBI-[ZIP_CODE] visit on the same day as Day 1 for this rollove r study 
provided they sign the current study’s informed consent before the final NBI-[ZIP_CODE] or NBI-[ZIP_CODE] visit.  This will allow certain safety assessments to be used for both studies.  
The safety assessment  results that can apply to both studies include physical examinations

(including weight), vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECG).  Other Day 1 assessments 
(including safety labs) must be collected  for the current study (even if the subject is completing 
the final visit for the previous study).  The study will be conducted in approximately [ADDRESS_859103] of any study-related procedures, including 
washout of medications disallowed in the study.  Before subjects can provide informed consent, the investigator (or designee) must determine whether the subject has the capacity to provide consent for participation using the University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego Brief Assessment of 
Capacity to Consent (UBACC; Jeste et al., 2007).  A copy of the UBACC is provided in 
Appendix 16.1.  Only subjects who are deemed to have the capacity to provide consent may sign 
the ICF. 
On Day 1, eligible subjects will receive a supply of valbenazine [ADDRESS_859104] 4 weeks of the treatment period.  On Day 2, valbenazine will be administered at home (in the presence of their caregiver, if applicable) in the morning or evening.  After Day 2, the subject will be 
directed to  take their dose at about the same time each day (eg, morning or evening ). 
At the end of Week 4, the investigator may escalate the subject’s dose to [ADDRESS_859105]’s current dose (40 mg qd).  A dose escalation will be allowed at the end of 
Week 4 based on the physician investigator’s (or desig nee’s) assessments of the safety and

8.2. Baseline Assessments  
8.2.1. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)  
The BPRS is a clinician -rated tool designed to assess the severity of psychopathology in patients 
with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders ( Overall and Gorham, 1962, 1988).  The BPRS 
includes [ADDRESS_859126], excitement, and disorientation.   
The severity of each of the 18 items of the BPRS is rated on a scale of 1 (not present) to 7 
(extremely severe) (total score range: 18  to 126).  Higher scores represent greater symptom 
severity.   
The investigator or other qualified clinical site personnel will administer and score the scale at baseline (Day 1) , and subjects must have a BPRS total score <50 to be eligible for study 
participation (see exclusion criterion #6).   A copy of the BPRS is provided in Appendix 16.2.  
8.3. Efficacy Assessment  
8.3.1. Clinical Global Impression  of Tardive Dyskinesia- Severity (CGI-TD-severity)  
The CGI-TD-severity, which is based on a 7- point scale (range:   1=normal, not at all ill to 
7=among the most extremely ill patient), will be used to rate the overall global severity  of TD.  
This scale is a modification of a scale developed by [CONTACT_641797] (Guy, 1976).  A copy of the CGI -TD-severity is 
provided in Appendix 16.3. 
The investigator or qualified clinician designee (eg, psychologist or social worker) will rate the 
scale at the scheduled times.  If possible, the same person should rate the CGI- TD-severity at all 
visits.     
The CGI-TD-severity will be completed by [CONTACT_641798] (Day 1) and during the 
treatment period at  the end of Weeks  12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 (final study visit or upon early 
termination) . 
8.4. Safety Assessments  
Concomitant medication use and AEs will be monitored throughout the study  as described in 
Section 8.8.[ADDRESS_859127] results obtained on the final study visit or upon early termination, until the value returns to baseline (or within normal limits), or the investigator deems  the abnormality to be of 
no clinical significance.  If the investigator determines that a subject has a clinically significant finding of treatment-emergent depression, suicidal ideation, psychiatric symptoms (based upon

the C-SSRS or clinical assessment) , the finding will be documented as an AE, and appropriate 
psychiatric evaluation and intervention will be provided. 
For subjects completing the final NBI-[ZIP_CODE] or NBI-[ZIP_CODE] visit on the same day as 
Day 1, the NBI-[ZIP_CODE] or NBI-[ZIP_CODE]- 1402 assessments for physical examination 
(including weight), vital signs, and ECG will be used for Day 1. 
8.4.1. Medical and Surgical History  
A general medical and surgical history will be obtained at baseline ( Day 1).  
The subject’s psychiatric history will be document ed and will include the subject’s age at first 
diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder or mood disorder, and age at TD 
diagnosis.  If necessary, subject age at onset can be estimated by [CONTACT_641799]. 
8.4.2. Physical Examination Including Neurological Assessment, Height, and Weight 
A complete physical examination will consist of an assessment of the following: general 
appearance; skin and mucosa; head, eyes, ears, nose, throat; lymph nodes; chest/lungs; 
cardiovascular; abdomen; extremities; musculoskeletal; and neurological system.  
A physical examination including weight will be conducted at baseline ( Day 1) and during the 
treatment period at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 (final study visit or upon ear ly termination) .  
Height will be recorded at baseline (Day 1) only.  Height and w eight will be recorded with 
subjects wearing ordinary indoor clothing without shoes.  Height and weight will be used to 
calculate the BMI (kg/m2). 
8.4.3. Vital Sign Measurements  
Vital sign measurements, including orthostatic systolic and diastolic blood pressure, orthostatic 
pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), and oral body temperature will be measured at  the visits 
stated below.  Blood pressure will be measured using a calibrated automatic blood pressure cuff after the subject  has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 5  minutes and after approximately 2  minutes of 
standing.  The automatic blood pressure cuff will also provide pulse rate measurement. 
Vital sign measurements will be collected  at baseline ( Day 1) and during the treatment period at 
Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, and 72 (final study visit or 
upon early termination). 
8.4.4. Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12- lead ECG will be recorded in triplicate (1  to 3 minutes  apart) after the subject has 
rested supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 5  minutes.  The ECG parameters that will be assessed include HR, PR 
interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and QTcF (machine readings or calculated).  Additionall y, 
the occurrence of de- a nd re-polarization and rhythm disorders or other abnormalities will be 
assessed.  Based on the review of these parameters, the investigator or designee will note if the 
ECG is Normal, Abnormal N ot Clinically Significant, or Abnormal Clinically Significant.   If the 
ECG is Abnormal Clinically Significant, the investigator or designee will provide a description of the abnormality recorded on the AE eCRF.

The 12-lead ECG recordings will be conducted at baseline ( Day 1) and during the treatment 
period at Weeks  4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 (final study visit or upon early termination).  
8.4.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
All clinical laboratory tests will be analyzed by a central laboratory  (unless otherwise noted 
below), which will provide instructions and supplies to the clinical site  staff before study 
initiation.  Laboratory samples will be collected in the following approximate amounts: 4 mL for 
hematology, 4mL for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and 5 mL for clinical chemistry (includes 
serum pregnancy test at baseline).  
The routine laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry , and urinalysis) will be performed 
under non-fasted conditions at baseline ( Day 1) and during the treatment period at Weeks  12, 24, 
36, 48, 60, and 72 (final study visit or upon early termination). 
The following clinical safety laboratory assays will be performed: 
Hematology :  complete blood count including white blood cell (WBC) count with differential, 
red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
(MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume 
(MCV), red cell distribution width (RDW), and mean platelet volume (MPV).   A sample for 
HbA1c will also be collected (approximately 4 mL in dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA K
2]). 
Clinical Chemistry :  sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, blood urea nitrogen, 
bicarbonate, creatinine, uric acid, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, AST, ALT, gamma-glutamyl transferase ( GGT), creatine kinase, total bilirubin, total cholesterol, 
triglycerides, total protein , and glucose.  
Urinalysis :  specific gravity, nitrite, ketones, protein, urobilinogen, glucose, bilirubin, leukocyte 
esterase, occult blood, and pH; microscopic examination of sediment will be performed only if 
the results of the urinalysis dipstick evaluation are positive for protein, leukocyte esterase, or 
blood. 
The following additional laboratory tests will be performed:  
Urine Drug Screen :  UDS collected at baseline ( Day 1) will be analyzed by [CONTACT_641800], barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], phencyclidine, cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], and cannabinoids.  
In addition, a UDS kit provided by [CONTACT_641801] ( Day 1).  A UDS using a kit provided by [CONTACT_641802]. Subjects with a positive cannabinoid result may be allowed to participate in the study 
provided that the subject is given thorough counseling and agrees to refrain from using 
cannabinoids for the duration of his/her study participation.  Subjects receiving a chronic and stable dose of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], barbiturates, or opi[INVESTIGATOR_641791] (refer to  
Section 
8.8.1).  
Alcohol:  An alcohol breathalyzer test will be conducted at baseline ( Day 1) at the clinical site  to 
confirm eligibility .  This test may be randomly performed at any time during the study at the 
investigator’s discretion.  
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Protocol No. NBI-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_859128] :  Pregnancy tests will be performed throughout the study for female subjects who 
are not postmenopausal for at least [ADDRESS_859129] ( β-human chorionic 
gonadotropin [β-hCG]) will be conducted for all female subjects on Day 1 (as part of clinical 
chemistry)  and analyzed by [CONTACT_2237] .  A urine pregnancy test will be performed at 
the clinical site  at baseline ( Day 1) to confirm eligibility,  as well as at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 
28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, and 72 (final study visit or upon early termination ). 
Prolactin:  Blood samples to determine serum prolactin concentration will be collected at 
baseline ( Day 1) and during the treatment period at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 (final study 
visit or upon early termination).  Approximately 5 mL of blood will be collected into a serum separator tube.  Serum prolactin samples will be shipped to a central laborat ory for analysis.  
For any abnormal tests deemed clinically significant, repeat analysis will be performed until the 
cause of the abnormality is determined or until the value returns to baseline (or within normal 
limits), or the investigator deems the abnor mality to be of no clinical significance.  
8.4.6. Estimated Total Blood Sample Volume Required by [CONTACT_641803]  2.  These

8.4.7. Assessment of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior – Columbia -Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS) 
The C-SSRS is a validated instrument to prospectively assess suicidal ideation and behavior 
(http://www.cssrs.columbia.edu).  There are versions of the questionnaire designed for use at baseline (Day 1 : Screening/Baseline version) and visits throughout the study (Since Last Visit 
version).  All versions of the C- SSRS include a series of screening questions related to suicidal 
ideation and suicidal behavior.  Subject responses of ‘yes’ to one or more screening questions will prompt additional questions that evaluate frequency and intensity of suicidal ideation and/or behavior.  Subjects with any suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation of type 4 (active suicidal 
ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or type 5 (active suicidal ideation with 
specific plan and intent) based on the C-SSRS in the 3 months prior to Day 1 (using Screening/Baseline version) should be excluded (see exclusion criterion # 5).  A copy of the 
C-SSRS (Screening/Baseline and Since Last Visit)  is provided in Appendix 16.4. 
The C-SSRS will be administered and scored by [CONTACT_641804] C- SSRS certification.  The C -SSRS will be administered at

baseline ( Day 1) and during the treatment period at  Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 
48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, and 72 (final study visit or upon early termination).  The 
“Screening/Baseline” version of the scale will be used to evaluate subject eligibility at baseline 
(Day 1) and the “ Since Last Visit” version will be used at all other visits . 
If at any time after baseline (Day 1) the subject’s response to the suicidal ideation section of the 
C-SSRS is worse than the baseline (Day 1) assessment  (past 3 months), it will be documented as 
an AE.  All suicidal behaviors will be documented as an AE.  Appropriate psychiatric evaluation 
and intervention will be provided for any treatment- emergent suicidal behavior or clinically 
significant suicidal ideation.  
8.5. Additional Assessments  
8.5.1. Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire  
Subjects will evaluate their satisfaction with valbenazine treatment by [CONTACT_43435] 1 of 5 responses (very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, or 
very dissatisfied).  The Patient Satisfaction  Questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_641805] (Day 1) and during the treatment period at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 (final study 
visit or upon early termination).  A copy of the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire is provided in 
Appendix 16.5. 
8.5.2. Social Functioning Scale  
The Social Functioning Scale ( SFS; Birchwood et al, 1990) is a 79 -item scale designed to assess 
social functioning.  Abilities and performance in seven areas are assessed: social engagement, 
interpersonal communication, activities of daily living, recreation, social activities, competence 
at independent living, and occupation/employment.  Raw scores of the subscales ar e converted to 
scale score equivalents with a mean of 100 and an SD of 15.  This scale has been shown to be a 
reliable, valid, and sensitive measure of social functioning (Birchwood et al. 1990). 
The SFS will be completed by [CONTACT_218626] (Day 1)  and during the treatment period at 
the end of Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 (final study visit or upon early termination).  A copy 
of the SFS is provided in Appendix 16.6.  
8.6. Specific Period Information  
Study visits during the treatment period at the end of weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40,

Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Protocol No. NBI-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_859140]’s final study visit (Week 72 or upon early termination) .  Note, AEs and serious 
adverse events ( SAEs) will be collected for enrolled subjects only. 
10.1. Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated  with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related.  During the study , clinically significant adverse changes in 
clinical status, ECGs, laboratory values (not associated with an AE or concurrent medical condition), or physical examinations are considered AEs.  Any subject complaint associated with such an abnormal finding will also be reported as an AE. 
Adverse events include, but are not limited to:  (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, or 
frequency of conditions present at the start of the study; (2) subject deterioration due to primary illness; (3) intercurrent illness; and (4) drug interaction.  
Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any specific symptom.  The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  Following questioning and 
evaluation, all AEs, whether believed by [CONTACT_641812], must be documented in the subject’s medical records, in accordance with the 
investigator’s normal clinical practice and on the AE eCRF.  Each AE is to be evaluated for 
duration, intensity, frequency, seriousness, outcome, other actions taken, and relationship to valbenazine.  
The following are not considered AEs:  
• Continuous persistent disease/symptom present before valbenazine administration, unless it 
unexpectedly progresses, or increases in severity following valbenazine administration.  
• Pregnancy  (see Section 10.5). 
10.1.1. Intensity of Adverse Events  
Adverse events must be graded for intensity.  An intensity category of mild, moderate, or severe, 
as defined in  Table 3, must be entered on the AE eCRF.  It should be noted that the term 
“severe” used to grade intensity is not synonymous with the term “serious.”

Table 3: Intensity of Adverse Events  
Grade  Intensity  
Mild An adverse event  that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities 
of daily living.  
Moderate  An adverse event  that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention.  The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant.  
Severe An adverse event  that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
10.1.2. Relationship to Valbenazine 
The investigator will document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_641792] 4.  An AE is deemed associated with the use of 
valbenazine “if there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE” (otherwise referred 
to as a suspected adverse reaction).  Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship  between the drug and the AE (Title 21 CFR 312.32 [a]). 
Table 4: Relationship of Adverse Events to Valbenazine  
Relationship  Description  
Definite A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug or in 
which the drug level has been established in body fluids or tissue; that follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the suspected drug; and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_641793] g, and reappearance of the reaction on repeated 
exposure.  
Possible An adverse event in which there is reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.  Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
Unlikely A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that 
follows a known or suspected response pattern to the suspected drug; but that could 
reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_11176]’s clinical state.  
Not Related  Any event that does not meet the above criteria.  
10.2. Recording Adverse Events  
For enrolled subjects, each AE will be listed as a separate entry on an AE eCRF.  The 
investigator will provide information on dates and times of onset and resolution, intensity, 
seriousness, frequency, action(s) taken, changes in valbenazine usage, relationship to valbenazine, and outcome.   
The following categories of medical events that could occur during participation in a clinical 
study must be reported within 24 hours to NBI or designee: 
• SAE, including death ( see Section 10.4). 
• Pregnancy (see Section  10.5). 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Protocol No. NBI-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_859141]’s safety or unti l the event stabilizes or resolves or 
until the subject is lost to follow -up.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow-up 
includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the nature and/or 
causality of the AE.  Thi s may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, 
histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals, as is 
practical. 
10.4. Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs will be recorded from the time the subject has signed the IC F until [ADDRESS_859142] . 
10.4.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following outcome: 
• Death. 
• A life-threatening AE.  Life -threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the 
investigator or Sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  It does 
not mean that hypothetically the event might have caused death if it occurred in a more 
serious form.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263804] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen during the clinical investigation is not considered an AE.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316493].  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084], and if a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is 
considered serious.  Treatment in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11128] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  These events may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the health of the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed.  Any other event thought by [CONTACT_316511], following the reporting requirements 
detailed in this section.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an e mergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Protocol No. NBI-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_859143] is medically stabilized.  The investigator (or designee) will notify the 
Medical Mo nitor (and the IRB, if necessary) immediately (within 24  hours) of the SAE and the 
outcome of the SAE. 
If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE within the ti me of informed consent until [ADDRESS_859144] be documented and reported as described in 
Section 10.4.3. 
10.4.3. Reporting Serious Adverse Events and Other Immediately Reportable Events  
Serious AEs and other immediately reportable events (defined in Section  10.2) must be reported

11. DOCUMENTATION OF DATA  
11.1. Case Report F orms 
The CRF data for this study are being collected with an electronic data capture (EDC) system 
( ) provided by .  The EDC system and the 
study-specific eCRFs will comply with Title [ADDRESS_859149] data in his/her own subject files.  These subject files will serve as source data for the study.  All eCRF data required by [CONTACT_41788], with the exception of data captured in an 
electronic format, which will be loaded electronically into the appropriate eCRFs.  All data 
entered into the eCRF will be supported by [CONTACT_26300].  The eCRF for each subject must be reviewed by [CONTACT_263842](s).  This should 
be done as soon as possible after the subject completes the study.   
The investigator or an authorized member of the investigator's staff will make any necessary 
additions/corrections to the eCRF.  All change information, including the date, person 
performing the corrections, and reason for the change will be available via the electronic audit 
trail, which is part of the EDC system.  The eCRFs will be reviewed periodically for completeness, legibility, and acceptability by [CONTACT_11148] (or designee).  NBI will also be allowed 
access to all source documents and medical records pertinent to the study in orde r to verify eCRF 
entries.  The P rincipal Investigator will review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and 
enter his or her electronic signature [CONTACT_641816].  
a will provide access to the NBI portal of the EDC system for the duration of the study 
through a password-protected method of internet access.  Such access will be removed from 
investigator sites at the end of the site's participation in the study.  Data from the EDC system 
will be archived on appropriate data media (CD -ROM, etc.) and provided to the investigator at 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Protocol No. NBI-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_859150] of the site’ s eCRF data.  Although not required, the investigator 
may make paper printouts from that media.  
All clinical work conducted under this protocol is subject to GCP regulations.  This includes an 
inspection by [CONTACT_11185]/or health authority representatives at any time.  The Principal Inve stigator 
will agree to the inspection of study -related records by [CONTACT_41797]/or 
NBI. 
11.2. Data Capture, Review, and Validation  
Data entered in the EDC system will be verified against the source data by [CONTACT_11148] (or designee).  Any discrepancies will be corrected on -line by [CONTACT_1747].  After completion of 
the entry process, automated (computer- generated) logic checks wil l run in order to identify 
items such as inconsistent study dates.  In addition, manual review/checks may be performed by 
[CONTACT_11188].  Any inconsistencies/errors/omissions identified will be sent to the site (via an 
electronic query) for the necessary  corrections to be made to the eCRF.  Once entered and saved 
in an eCRF, data immediately become part of the study database and are available to NBI.

12.8. Safety Data  
Treatment -emergent AEs  (TEAEs) , categorized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term 
as defined by [CONTACT_61132], will be summarized.  A TEAE is defined as any AE that oc curs after the 
first dose of valbenazine through the final study visit.  Any AE that occurred before the first dose 
of valbenazine will be considered a pretreatment AE.  
The TEAE tables will include the number of events, number of unique subjects experienc ing 
each event, and percentage of subjects experiencing each event.   
AEs will be also be tabulated in terms of the number and percentage of subjects experiencing events by [CONTACT_641814].  
Separate listings will be generated for  pretreatment AEs, TEAEs, SAEs and deaths, and AEs 
leading to premature discontinuation from the study .  
Clinical laboratory, vital signs, physical examination, and ECG data will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics and frequency tables as appropriate.  Prior and concomitant medications will be presented in data listings.

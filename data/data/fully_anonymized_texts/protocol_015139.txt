the last cycle prior to progression, and is 4 or less). Additionally, i f, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13046], the patient will benefit from more than 4 cycles of docetaxel and open label pegfilgrastim, then the fifth cycle will not start until completion of the 
EOT visit (in this instance, the EOT visit will be Cycle 4 Day 21).  
• It was clarified throughout the protocol that patients without progressive disease at the EOT visit will undergo a follow -up vi sit every 2 months until the occurrence of 
either disease progression or death. The visits may be conducted per telephone or other means.  
• Inclusion Criterion 7 was amended to include a footnote as follows “ Results are from 
the central laboratory. Local laboratory results may be accepted on a case by [CONTACT_239165], however in this case central laboratories must also be taken within the screening time window ”

o Total ANC is comprised of mature and immature neutrophils. Immature neutrophils have reduced functional capacity compared to mature neutrophils to enable optimal innate immunity. Compared to mature neutrophils , immature neutrophils exert 
reduced ROS production leading to reduced microbicidal activity, reduced phagocytic activity, reduced granularity, reduced ability to create NETs (Mackay G et al, Frontiers in Immunology 2019; Mortaz E et al Frontiers in Immunology 2018). Therefore an additional analysis will be made with mature neutrophils only.

Study Design  
This is a multicenter, randomized study with an open label phase [ADDRESS_290043] (such as placebo infusions and injections). All patients will receive docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m
2.  
In Phase 2, only patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failing platinum -based therapy wil l be 
enrolled.   
In Phase 3, patients with one of the following diagnosis will be enrolled: advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who have failed < 5 prior lines of chemotherapy; locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after platinum therapy 
failure ; or HRPC.   
The eligibility of all patients will be determined during a 28 -day screening period.   
Phase 2 (Open Label):  
Approximately 40 patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC will be enrolled.  Patients are randomly assigned 
with approximately 10  patients enro lled in each arm, with the arm designation and planned intervention as 
follows:  
Arm 1: Docetaxel (75 mg/m
2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg)  
Arm 2: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (20 mg/m2)  
Arm 3: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (10 mg/m2)  
Arm 4: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (5 mg/m2)  
The study will be temporarily closed to enrollment when [ADDRESS_290044] 
1 treatment cycle in each arm in phase 2.  The Sponsor will notify the study sites when this occurs.   
Once the study is temporarily closed to enrollment in phase 2, a PK/PD analysis will be performed to determine 
the RP3D . The PK/PD analysis will be done by [CONTACT_239166] [ADDRESS_290045] Cycle 1.     
Phase 3 (Double  Blind):   
Phase 3 will not begin until RP3D has been determined based on the Phase 2 PK/PD analysis as mentioned above; t he RP3D will be the only plinabulin dose administered in Phase  3.  
A fixed dose of 40 mg has been selected as the RP3D following the Phase 2
 PK/PD analysis (details of dose 
selection are provided in Section 6.2.3).  
Approximately 150 patients  are planned to be enroll ed in the Phase 3 with one of the following diagnosis: 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who have failed < 5 prior lines of chemotherapy; locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC after platinum therapy failure ; or HRPC. Each eligible patient will be stratified according to 
his or her tumor type (breast cancer, NSCLC or HRPC) and region (Asia, non- Asia). Patients will be randomly 
assigned within each stratum (diagnosis) with equal probability (1:1 ratio) or 75:75, with the arm designation and planned interve ntion as follows:  
Arm 1: Docetaxel (75  mg/m
2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg) + placebo matching plinabulin

Date: 13 December 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page: 21 of 138 Arm 2: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin ( 40 mg ) + placebo matching pegfilgrastim  
In order to facilitate balanced treatment arms with respect to cancer type, once either arm reaches at least 1/3 (of 
total) of patients with that cancer type, it will be closed to that cancer type and enrollment will continue for patients with the other ca ncer types, up to the planned maximum number of patients.  
Data from all patients receiving the RP3D plinabulin dose in Phase 2 and Phase 3 will not be pooled for assessing 
the primary and secondary study endpoints, but analyzed separately.  
Treatments Admi nistered:  
Both Phase [ADDRESS_290046] of docetaxel 75 mg/m
2 administered by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) 
infusion on Day 1 over 60  minutes (±5 minutes) every 21 days.  In the phase 2 portion, on Day 1 of each cycle, 
1.5 hours (± 10 minutes) a fter the start time of docetaxel infusion (i.e., approximately 30 minutes after the end of 
docetaxel infusion), patients assigned to a plinabulin arm (arms 2- 4) will get a single intravenous infusion of 
plinabulin at their assigned dose over 30 minutes (±  5 minutes) . Thus, the wait time between end of docetaxel 
infusion and start of the plinabulin infusion is approximately 30 minutes. On Day 2 of each cycle, ≥24 hours after 
completing chemotherapy, patients assigned to pegfilgrastim (arm 1) will receive a s ingle dose of pegfilgrastim 
(6 mg) (subcutaneous injection).  
In the Phase 3 portion, on Day 1 of each cycle, 1.5 hours (± 10 minutes) after the start time of docetaxel infusion 
(i.e., approximately 30 minutes after the end of docetaxel infusion), patients  will get a single dose of plinabulin or 
placebo intravenously over 30 minutes (±  5 minutes) .  On Day 2 of each cycle, ≥24 hours after completing 
chemotherapy, patients will receive a single dose of pegfilgrastim (6 mg) or placebo (subcutaneous injection).    
If a chemotherapy cycle is delayed by [CONTACT_726] 3 weeks, the patient will be withdrawn from the study.  If a 
critical AE (refer to Section  10.5) occurs during the cycle, the dosage of docetaxel may be reduced 20% in the 
next cycle.  Only one docetaxel dose reduction is allowed (refer to Taxotere® (P rescribing Information) . No dose 
reductions are allowed with plinabulin or pegfilgrastim.  
All patients, including patients who withdraw from the study early, will complete a safety follow -up visit 30  days 
(± 2 days) after the last dose of study drug.  Patients who withdraw for progressive disease and who will continue 
to another chemotherapy regimen will complete the End of Treatment (EOT) visit at Cycle X Day 21. They then 
continue to another  chemotherapy regimen and do not need to have the safety follow -up visit (where X is the last 
cycle prior to progression, and is 4 or less). If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the patient will benefit from 
more than 4 cycles of docetaxel and open label pegfilgrastim, then the fifth cycle will not start until completion of 
the EOT visit (in this instance, the EOT visit will be Cycle 4 Day 21). Follow -up visits will be required to 
monitor for ongoing treatment -related AEs.  All patients experiencing drug -related toxicities of  ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_290047] monthly until the AE(s) resolves to ≤ Grade  1, the event is considered to 
be chronic, or the patient receives other anti -cancer therapy.  The method of follow -up assessment wi ll be at the 
Investigator’s discretion (for example, patient site visit or telephone call).  All deaths which occur within [ADDRESS_290048] results (hematology and serum chemistry) will be collected via a central laboratory.  Safety laboratory tests are required prior to treatment on Day 1 of each cycle and can be collected by a local laboratory; however, all other s cheduled blood samples as per the schedule assessments and procedure table must also be 
obtained for central laboratory assessment.  Urinalysis will be performed at screening only.  CD34+ counts will 
be established through a fluorescence- activated cell sor ting (FACS) method as described in Table  6.

Study Treatments  
Phase 2 (approximately 10 patients per arm  with advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failing 
platinum -based therapy):  
Arm 1: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg)  
Arm 2: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (20 mg/m2)  
Arm 3: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (10 mg/m2)   
Arm 4: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (5 mg/m2)  
Phase 3 (a planned [ADDRESS_290067] failed 
< 5 prior lines of chemotherapy; locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after platinum therapy failure; or 
HRPC):  
Arm 1: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg) + placebo matching plinabulin  
Arm 2: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin ( 40 mg) + placebo matching pegfilgrastim  
All patients must be pre -medicated with oral corticosteroids such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g., 8 mg 
bid) for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel administration in order to reduce the incidence and severity of 
fluid retention as well as the severity of hypersensitivity reactions (refer to Taxotere® (Prescribing Information)). 
For hormone -refractory metastatic prostate cancer, given the concurrent use of prednisone, the recommended 
premedication regimen is oral dexamethasone 8 mg, at 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the docetaxel infusion 
(refer to Taxotere® (Prescribing Information)).  
Rescue Treatment:  
Patients who experience an FN event in Cycle 1 should be discussed with the medical monitor.  The blinding will be broken (if Phase  3), and patients assigned to plinabulin will receive pegfilgrastim in subsequent cycles.   If a 
patient was originally assig ned to the pegfilgrastim arm, patients must be treated at a lower dose of docetaxel, or 
taken off study at the discretion of the investigator.  
If the patient develops an FN event on subsequent cycles, the patient should be discussed with the medical monit or and either treated with a lower dose of docetaxel, or taken off study at the discretion of the investigator. 
Febrile neutropenia should be treated with antibiotics per institutional standard of care  (refer to Section  10.6.1) . If 
a patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], the procedure for reporting Serious Adverse Events (Section 13.2) should also be 
followed.
 
Duration of Treatment  
Patients will receive treatment with study drug for up to 4 cycles in this study, a treatment cycle is 21 days; thereafter, patients may continue receiving docetaxel and pegfilgrastim at the Investigator’s discretion.  After 
completion of 4 cycles, patient s will complete a safety follow -up visit 30 days (± 2 days) after the last dose of 
study drug (see Table  6 and Table 7
 Study Assessments and Procedures Schedule).  If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], the patient will benefit from more than 4 cycles of docetaxel and open label pegfilgrastim, then the 
fifth cycle will not start until completion of the EOT visit (in this instance, the EOT visit will be Cycle 4 Day 21). 
Patients with progressive disease requiring another treatment will also complete the EOT visit at Cycle X Day 21

Treatment up to 4 cycles of study drug in this study will continue until any 1 of the following occurs:  
• Dose limiting toxicity or critical adverse e vent as described in the docetaxel package insert ( Taxotere® 
(Prescribing Information))  
• Need for a protocol -prohibited dose reduction or study drug delay gr eater than 21 days  
• Initiation of a protocol -prohibited concomitant medication or non- protocol chemo/biological therapy for 
treatment of his or her disease

require treatment discontinuation  
• Investigator opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]  
• Sponsor decision  
• Voluntary withdrawal of consent  
Concomitant Drug/Therapy  
Institutional guidelines should be followed in the event of infusion/hypersensitivity reaction.  Diphenhydramine 
and dexamethasone infusion may be administered in the event of infusion reaction.  
All patients must be premedicated with oral corticosteroids (see below for HRPC) such as dexamethasone 16 mg 
per day (e.g., 8 mg twice daily) for 3 days starting 1 day before the docetaxel administration in order to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well as the severity of hypersensitivity reactions (refer to 
Taxotere® (Prescribing Information) ). 
For HRPC, given the concurrent use of pre dnisone, the recommended premedication regimen is oral 
dexamethasone 8 mg at 12 hours, 3 hours, and 1 hour before docetaxel infusion (refer to Taxotere® (Prescribing 
Information) ).  
The prophylactic use of antibiotics is allowed at the discretion of the Investigator.  The use of antibiotics will be recorded by [CONTACT_239169] (refer to Table  5). 
Corticosteroids (except as described for premedication) and new non -steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) are prohibited except for the treatment of AEs and as premedication. Patients already receiving NSAIDs are  allowed to continue taking treatment as long as the dose remains stable.  
The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors as concomitant medications will be prohibited because docetaxel exposure 
increases by [CONTACT_3450] 2 -fold (Section  10.6.2) with the use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.  
Docetaxel is low emetic risk (10% to 30% frequency of emesis) and appropriate anti -emetic prophylaxis should 
be given prior to s tudy medication per institutional policy.  In this study, dexamethasone is used as anti -emetic 
prophylaxis as well as to minimize docetaxel associated fluid retention.  
If “breakthrough” emesis (e.g. emesis and nausea after Day 1) occurs, the general strat egy is to add one agent 
from a different drug class to the “rescue” anti -emesis regimen.  Useful anti -emetic agents for rescue include the 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cannabinoids (e.g. dronabinol or nabilone), haloperidol, metoclopramide, scopolamine, the 
phenothiaz ines (e.g. prochlorperaxine or promethazine) and 5HT3 receptor agonists. If a 5HT3 receptor agonist is 
needed, palonosetron (which is not known to prolong QT/QTc intervals) is safest and must be chosen over other 5HT3 receptor agonists. Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_239122] a cceptable substitute 5HT3 receptor agonist ( Yavas et al, 2008 ).  
Because of the potential interference with QT/QTc interval, in Cycle [ADDRESS_290068] can be used.  
If nausea and /or vomiting of Grade [ADDRESS_290069] be tre ated with “rescue” anti -emetics during 
mid-cycle, and on subsequent cycles, the prophylactic anti -emetic regimen should be modified.

Efficacy Analyses Considerations  
Primary efficacy analysis considerations  
DSN was not measured in the previous Phase 2 study ([ Study NPI -2358- 101] in which patients received 
treatment with either plinabulin (30 mg/m2 [n=50] or 20 mg/m2 [n=40] + docetaxel or docetaxel alone [n=73]). 
DSN was obtained using the following methods (described below) for generation of ANC data and the observed neutrophil values on Day 8/Cycle 1 in the Phase 2 study.  Day 8 neutrophil values were shown to approximately 
coincide with the nadir of ANC after docetaxel treatment ( Blackwell et al, 2015 ). The study will assume that the 
shape of the time/neutrophil recovery curve in plinabulin- treated patients is indistinguishable from the 
time/neutrophil recovery curve for filgrastim and its biosimilars.  
In a study with filgrastim and its biosimilar, time course of ANC in Cycle [ADDRESS_290104] deviations of ANC during the 21 -day follow -up

Protocol Amendment 7  
Date: 13 December 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page: [ADDRESS_290105] deviations for the 21- day 
follow -up period as the publication.  The simulation would then also generate the projected number of days with 
severe neutropenia, (i.e., the DSN).  
Deming regression ( Deming, 1943 ) was used to calculate the linear relationship between simulated nadir and 
DSN.  The rank correlation between simulated nadir and DSN was used to calculate the DSN with plinabulin 
(+ docetaxel) and docetaxel alone.  In the Phase 2 stu dy, ANCs were obtained on Day 8, which approximately 
coincides with the time that the neutrophil nadir occurs after docetaxel administration.  The observed Day 8 
neutrophil (nadir) values were computed into the linear relationship (Deming regression), ment ioned above to 
calculate DSN for each patient.  Using these methods, calculated mean DSN was 0.065  days for the plinabulin+ 
docetaxel arm, and 1.076 days for the docetaxel alone.  Based on published data with filgrastim in patients receiving docetaxel ( Alexopoulos K et al, 1999), the assumption is that Grade 4 neutropenia in Cycle 1 would 
occur in a 2 times higher frequency with G -CSF+docetaxel versus plinabulin+docetaxel, resulting in a presumed 
mean DSN of 0.13 days for the G -CSF+ docetaxel combination.  
This non- inferiority trial design will utilize a difference (arm 2 minus arm 1) of 0.65 days (non -inferiority 
margin) in DSN in Cycle [ADDRESS_290106] will evaluate the null hypothesis H0: true difference (arm 2 minus arm 1) ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_290107] the 
alternative hypothesis H1: true difference (arm 2 minus arm 1) <  0.65.  Plinabulin will be considered non- inferior 
to pegfil grastim if in Cycle 1, the upper limit of the 2 -sided 95% confidence interval for the true difference in 
mean duration of Grade 4 neutropenia was <  0.[ADDRESS_290108] ( http://www.neulastahcp.com/risk/duration -of-severe- neutropenia/ ) that FN is correlated with 
DSN.  The frequency of FN with docetaxel monotherapy (100 mg/m
2) + G -CSF w as reported to be 1% in 
Cycle  1.  FN frequency in Cycle 1 with docetaxel combined with doxorubicin and G -CSF was ~ 3 % ( Aarts M et 
al, 2013), which would translate into a DSN of 1 day according to Holmes FA, et al, 2002 .  Based on these data, 
it is assumed that the median DSN for docetaxel monotherapy + G -CSF will be approximately 1 day.  
The frequency of FN with docetaxel monotherapy (without G-CSF) has been reported to be  11% in Cycle 1 (17% 
over all cycles) docetaxel dose of 100 mg/m2 (Vogel et al, 2005) and 19.8% over all cycles at a lower docetaxel 
dose of 60 mg/m2 (Yoh K et al, 2016 ).  Hanna N et al, 2004  reported an FN percentage of 12.7% with 75 mg/m2 
docetaxel.   Based on this range of FN, the relationship establishe d by [CONTACT_239173], 2002  between FN and DSN, we 
make the assumption that, with docetaxel monotherapy at a dose of 75 mg/m2 without G -CSF, the median DSN 
is estimated to be 4 -5 days.  
In the Zarxio® briefing document, 2015, the margin was selected based on the fact that Taxotere/Adriamycin/cyclophosphamide (TAC) chemotherapy is known to induce a median DSN of [ADDRESS_290109] cancer patients receiv ing no G -CSF treatment ( Nabholtz, 2001 ), while G -CSF treatment reduces the mean 
DSN for this chemotherapy to 1.4 days (95% CI: 1.07 -  1.69) as shown in pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) Study 
20020778 ( Kaufman et al, 2004 ).  Based on this a non -inferiority limit of 1 day was derived.  
As an extension of this reasoning, it is argued for our study, a non- inferiority margin of 0.65 would be  reasonable 
and correspond to approximately a median of 4.5 days of DSN, as a ratio of 1 day to 7 days of DSN in the Zarxio® briefing document, 2015.  
A non- inferiority margin of 0.65 days can also be justified, because a difference of 0.65 days is not considered to 
be clinically meaningful.  
Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses Considerations  
Plasma plinabulin and docetaxel concentrations will be measured using validated methods and PK param eters 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics.   Individual and mean serum plinabulin and docetaxel 
concentration versus time profiles will be plotted on both linear and logarithmic scales.  
Exposure -Neutropenia Relationship 
A sequential population PK/PD modeling approach will be used to characterize the exposure neutropenia 
relationship.  The semi -physiological model described by [CONTACT_239174] (2003) will be used to characterize the time 
course of neutropenia in the exposure -neutropenia model.   
The developed exposure -response models will be used to simulate ANC profiles for the computation of key PD 
endpoints such as DSN, DMSN, and area over the ANC curve (AOC). The latter will be calculated as the area 
below the threshold of <0.5 x 109 cells/L and above ANC -time response curve in a chemotherapy cycle.

Date: 13 December 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page: 35 of 138 Exposure -Blood Pressure Analysis  
A sequential PK -PD model analysis will be performed.  Since the ambulatory blood pressure measurements 
(ABPM) are subject to circadian variations, ABPM will be modeled to describe the circadian rhythm in blood 
pressure over the 4.5- hour observation period.  The diurnal rhythm in the AMBP data will be described with the 
cosine function ( Hempel 1998 ) in the ex posure ABPM models.   
Exposure -QTc Analysis  
Either a direct or sequential PK -PD model analysis will be performed.  The choice of the modeling approach will 
be informed by [CONTACT_239175]- matching of PK sampling times with ECG observation times. QT 
meas urements corrected with the Fridericia formula will be used in the exposure -QTc analysis.  
Interim Analyses  
The study design is group sequential with 1 interim analysis (after [ADDRESS_290110] 1 cycle in each of th e treatment arms docetaxel + plinabulin (40 mg) versus docetaxel + 
pegfilgrastim, with matching placebos) and 1 final analysis at the completion of the study. These results assume that 2 sequential tests are made using the O'Brien -Fleming spending function to determine the test boundaries.  
If non -inferiority is determined from the statistical testing, then also the hypothesis of superiority will be tested, 
and if it is concluded that the plinabulin treatment is superior to the pegfilgrastim treatment, with respect to DSN, 
then the study will be stopped. Since the design allows for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_239125], it might be decided at that 
occasion that the study will be stopped. Since this is a hierarchical testing procedure no penalty with respect to 
overall sig nificance will be paid.  
The statistical testing will be performed by [CONTACT_239176].  
Sample Size Rationale  
Phase 2 (Open Label)  
In the Phase 2 (40 patients; approximately 10 patients per arm), patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC will 
be enrolled.   
Phase 3 (Double blind)  
Approximately 150 patients  are planned to be enrolled with 1 of the following diagnoses: advanced or meta static 
breast cancer, NSCLC, or HRPC.  A sample size of 75 patients in each of the treatment arms docetaxel + 
plinabulin (40 mg) versus docetaxel + pegfilgrastim, with matching placebos achieve at least a 90% power to 
reject the null hypothesis of 0.[ADDRESS_290111] deviations 
of 0.75, at a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 two- sided two -sample zero -inflated Poisson model.   
The software PASS version 15.0.1 has been used for the calculations referencing Chow et al. 2003, Lan and 
DeMets 1983 , O'Brien and Fleming 1979.

al, 2002; Crawford et al, 2004) .  As a result, the prevention of neutropenia is a major goal for 
oncology practitioners for both safety and cost -efficiency ( Green et al, 2004 ; Aarts et al, 2013; 
Dinan et al, 2015) . 
Neutropenia is a frequent and potentially life -threatening complication of cytotoxic 
myelosuppressive chemothera py.  Research has shown that patients who develop neutropenia are 
more susceptible to infections which often required treatment with antibiotics and in severe cases 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ( Kawatkar et al, 2017).  Moreover, seve re neutropenia often necessitates 
modification of the chemotherapy regimen, thereby [CONTACT_239181] ( Waller et al, 2010 ). 
Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a potentially life -threatening condition characterized by [CONTACT_239182] (a single temperature of >38.3°C or a sustained temperature of ≥38°C for 
more than 1 hour) in addition to chemotherapy- induced Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (absolute 
neutrophil count [ANC] <  1.0 × 10
9/L).   
The risk of severe neutropenia including FN is mitigated by [CONTACT_239183].  However, research has shown these measures are 
directly correlated to lower long- term survival rates because of the relative reduction in the dose 
intensity of the chemotherapy ( Zhang et al, 2018). Therefore, granulocyte colony- stimulating 
factor (G -CSF) also known as filgrastim (Neupogen
®) or pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®), is given as 
standard of care to manage chemotherapy- induced severe neutropenia and to allow 
chemotherapy to be administered more effectively.  Guidelines for the use of G -CSF based on 
the risk of FN have been established by [CONTACT_239184] (NCI) Network, American Society of Clinical Oncology, National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network (NCCN), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, and 
Japanese Society of Clinical Oncol ogy (JSCO).  According to these guidelines, prophylactic 
G-CSF use is recommended for patients at significant risk of FN based on the chemotherapy 
regimen and patient specific risk factors ( Kosaka et al, 2015).  However, the prophylactic use of 
G-CSF has some significant limitations in terms of safety, cost and convenience of use.  
Treatment should not be administered within [ADDRESS_290124] dose of chemotherapy for each 
treatment cycle and is generally administered once per chemotherapy cycle (requires baseline 
complete blood count [CBC] and platelet count during therapy).  The concern with administering 
G-CSF on the day of chemotherapy is that increasing growth of myeloid cells may increase 
sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy agents.  Since cytotoxic chemotherapy causes the most 
damage to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_239126], giving an agent that causes myeloid cells to grow faster while 
chemotherapy is present may cause more toxicity.  Duration of G -CSF therapy is to attenuate 
chemotherapy -induced neutropenia and is dependent on the myelosuppressive potential of 
chemotherapy regimen employed.  Patients are required to ei ther self -administer the drug or 
return to the center for treatment and evaluation which is often difficult and costly for the patient.

[CONTACT_239185] a cost -effective product ( Blackwell et 
al, 2015).  
Warnings and precautions for pegfilgrastim include splenic rupture, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_239127], allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, fatal sickle cell crisis, glomerulonephritis, 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737], and leukocytosis.  The most common adverse reactions are bone pain and pain in an extremity which occurred in 31% and 9% of patients , respectively. Additional 
notable adverse events include acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, cutaneous vasculitis and injection site reactions ( Neulasta® Package Insert ). 
Plinabulin has the potential to offer a new treatment option that would ameliorate 
chemotherapy -related severe neutropenia (including FN) as well as have a better safety profile 
(much less bone pain) and be more convenient for the patient by [CONTACT_239186].  Most 
importantly, plinabulin can be given 1 hour after a chemotherapy cycle as opposed to 24 hours 
after the completion of the cycle (as  prescribed by [CONTACT_239187]).   
Two clinical studies with plinabulin have been conducted to date, a Phase  1 monotherapy study 
(Study NPI -2358- 100) and a Phase 1/2 combination study ( Study NPI -2358 -101) with docetaxel. 
A total of 141 patients with solid  tumors received plinabulin. Laboratory data did not uncover 
any clinically significant deleterious changes in hematology or chemistry laboratory parameters; 
however, there was a significantly lower incidence of neutropenia in patients receiving 
plinabulin plus docetaxel compared with the docetaxel monothera py arm.  
Plinabulin (BPI -2358) is a synthetic, low molecular weight, new chemical entity originally 
developed (previous name [CONTACT_239231] -2358) by [CONTACT_239188],  Inc., and now by 
[CONTACT_239189],  Inc.  It  belongs to  the diketopi[INVESTIGATOR_239128].

Plinabulin is a yellow to orange solid and the clinical drug product i s supplied as a solution in 
40% Kolliphor HS 15 (formerly known as polyoxyl 15 hydroxystearate, or Solutol HS -15)
®/60% 
propylene  glycol in an amber vial containing 80 mg in 20 mL  (4 mg/mL). Each vial is designated 
for single use.  
Plinabulin is intended for  intravenous ( IV) infusion and is diluted with dextrose 5% in distilled 
water (D5W) and given over 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) at an initial dose of 30 mg/m2. 
Plinabulin which inhibits the polymerization of tubulin monomers, also has multiple mechanisms 
of action  that inhibit tumor growth. Plinabulin targets  angiogenesis  and the existing tumor  
vasculature and also directly  induces cancer  cell apoptosis via  the JNK pathway  (Nicholson et al, 
2006; Singh et al, 2011; Kennedy et al, 2003) .  Plinabulin stimulates the tumor -related immune 
system by [CONTACT_239190] -competent mouse model ( Lloyd et al, 2016).  Based on the nonclinical 
and clinical studies conducted to date, plinabulin has several advantages compared to agents that

apoptosis, sustained suppression of tumor growth after treatment, inhibition of tubulin 
dimerization and thus new microtubul e formation without alteration of microtubule dynamic 
instability (reducing the risk of peripheral neuropathies associated with taxanes) ( Gornstein, 
2014).  The safety profile of plinabulin appears to be superior to that of other agents with immune -oncology effects, such as checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., nivolumab), providing a major 
advantage in cancer therapy.  T hus, plinabulin  may prove to  be efficacious  in the m anagement  of 
cancers  such as  advanced  non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  A Phase [ADDRESS_290126] in NSCLC patients. ( Study NPI -2358-
103).  
The mechanism by [CONTACT_239191].  Preclinical evidence shows that plinabulin induces maturation of dendritic cells, resulting in the release of the cytokines interleukin (IL) -1β, IL -6 and IL -12 from 
monocytes/dendritic cells ( Lloyd et al, 2016).  In particular IL -6 is mediated in the prevention of 
neutrophil apoptosis ( Asensi et al, 2004) and IL -1β with increased neutrophil count ( Dinarello, 
2011).  
Phase 1 ( Study NPI -2358 -100) and Phase 1/2 ( Study NPI -2358 -101) studies with plinabulin have 
been completed. Study NPI -2358 -100 was a Phase  1, open- label, dose -escalation study to 
determine the maximum- tolerated dose and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of plinabulin 
monotherapy in pa tients with a dvanced solid tumor  malignancies or lymphoma,  whose dis ease 
had pro gressed after treatm ent with sta ndard approved treatme nts. P linabulin w as administered

ranged from 2 to 30 m g/m
2.  A tot al of 38 pa tients re ceived plinabulin monotherap y.  
Study NPI -2358- 101 was a Phase 1/2, open- label study to evaluate plinabulin in combination 
with docetaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC that had progre ssed after treatment with at least 
1 chemotherapy regimen.  I n the P hase 1 part of the study, pa tients received escalating doses of 
plinabulin (13.5 mg/m2 to 30 mg/m2) in combination with a standard dose of docetaxel 
(75 m g/m2). No drug- drug interaction was detected between plinabulin and  docetaxel.  The 
RP2D of plinabulin administered with docetaxel was determined to be 30 mg/m2. 
In the Phase 2 part, patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel in combination with plinabulin or doceta xel alone (active control group).  A docetaxel dose of 75 mg/m
2 was 
administered to all patients.  The study was stratified into 2 segments.  A stratum that compared plinabulin 30 mg/m
2 plus docetaxel (study arm DN) to docetaxel alone (study arm D) followe d 
by a second stratum of plinabulin 20 mg/m2 plus docetaxel (DN arm) to docetaxel alone (D arm). 
Study drug was administered by [CONTACT_95077] 1 (docetaxel plus plinabulin) and Day 8 
(plinabulin) of each 3- week cycle.  A total of 103 patients receive plinabulin plus docetaxel and 
73 patients received docetaxel alone.  
Improvement in Neutropenia  
In the Phase 2 clinical trial, patients were randomized to receive docetaxel 75 mg/m2 alone 
(n=73) or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 followed by [CONTACT_239192] ( Study NPI -2358- 101) at 30 mg/m2 (n=50) 
or at 20 mg/m2 (n=40), repeated every 3 weeks (clinicaltrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Plinabulin 
was given by a 30- minute intravenous (IV ) infusion, starting 1 hour after administration of 
docetaxel.  The primary efficacy endpoint was median overall survival.  Secondary endpoints

laboratory values) for both the 20 mg/m2 and 30 mg/m2 plinabulin cohorts combined, and a 
benefit in neutropenia prevention was maintained over Cycles 2, 3, and 4.

of Cycle 1, in the patients receiving docetaxel monotherapy without plinabulin (“Docetaxel”), 
docetaxel +20 mg/m2 plinabulin, and docetaxel+ 30 mg/m2 plinabulin are shown. The reduction 
in Grade 4 neutropenia with eithe r plinabulin dose was statistically highly significant, and this 
reduction was comparable for the 20 and 30 mg/m2 plinabulin dose.

The benefit in Grade 4 neutropenia reduction on Day 8 in Cycle 1 was observed prior to patients 
receiving their plinabulin dose on Day 8, which provides evidence that a single plinabulin dose per cycle, given on Day 1 after docetaxel administration, is sufficient to achieve the neutropenia 
benefit.  Further evidence that a single 20 mg/m
2 dose of plinabulin after each dose of docetaxel 
is sufficient to prevent myelosuppressive regimens -induced neutropenia is demonstrated in 
Figure  3 in wh ich the nadir following a single dose (measured on Day 8 prior to the second dose 
of plinabulin) is similar to that measured in all blood samples in a cycle.

in preventing docetaxel -induced neutropenia, and that the 20 mg/m2 plinabulin dose appears 
equally effective as the 30  mg/m2 group for the prevention of docetaxel -induced neutropenia. 
Consistent wi th the benefit of neutropenia prevention, in the plinabulin groups fewer patients 
required G -CSF treatment, and fewer patients required docetaxel dose reductions.  
Safety Conclusions  
The safety  profile of plinabulin was consistent with what  has been reporte d in earlier Phase [ADDRESS_290129] a similar adverse event (AE) profile as single -agent 
docetaxel.  Increases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were seen  in 20% to 30 % of 
patients.  The incidence of hypertension in the 20  mg/m2 (9 patients, 22.5%; 5% with Grade 3) 
and 30 mg/m2 (16 patients, 32.0%; 20% with grade 3) cohorts was higher compared with the 
docetaxel group (1 patient 5.6% and 2 patients, 3.6%), respectively.  These events typi[INVESTIGATOR_239130] 2 hours  after plinabulin infusion.  No events of Grade 4 hypertension had 
occurred.  Grade 3 hypertension had occurred in 2  cases with the 20 mg/m2 dose and 7 cases 
with the 30 mg/m2 dose.  In both cases, the patients had a previous medical history of 
hypertension, which makes a causal relationship with plinabulin unlikely.  In the 30 mg/m2, there 
were 7  cases with Grade 3 hypertension, of which 4 cases had a prior medical history of 
hypertension; a causal relationship with plinabulin could not be determined in these [ADDRESS_290130] of plinabulin 
or caused by [CONTACT_239193][INVESTIGATOR_2438]. 
Overall, plinabulin + docetaxel appeared to have a more favorable safety profile at the 20 mg/m2 
plinabulin dose versus the 30 mg/m2 plinabulin dose, as demonstra ted by a smaller proportion of 
patients who discontinued treatment due to a treatment emergent adverse event ([TEAE] 
3 patients, 7.5% versus 11 patients, 22.0%) and a smaller proportion experienced 1 or more 
serious adverse events ([SAEs] 14 patients, 35.0% versus 31 patients, 62.0%).   
The proportion of patients in the plinabulin plus docetaxel 20 mg/m2 arm who discontinued 
treatment due to a TEAE and experienced 1 or more SAEs was similar to that reported for the combined docetaxel alone arms (4 patients,  5.5% and 23 patients, 31.5%, respectively), thus the 
20 mg/m
2 plinabulin dose appears to represent a safe plinabulin dose.  
Laboratory data did not uncover any clinically significant deleterious changes in hematology or chemistry laboratory parameters; ho wever, there was a lower incidence of  neutropenia in patients

Adverse events of concern were atrial fibrillation, ileus/intestinal obstruction, and reversible  
posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome ( see current Investigator Brochure ). 
In specific therapeutic settings as described by [CONTACT_44584], docetaxel is an accepted 
treatment regimen for breast cancer , NSCLC, and hor mone refractory prostate cancer  (HRPC) 
(https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp#site).  
6.1.1. Pharmacokinetics and Drug Disposition in Humans  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of plinabulin was evaluated in a Phase1 monotherapy clinical study  
in advanced solid tumor malignancies or lymphoma.  Compartment -independent PK analysis  
revealed a linear  increase in systemic  exposure (are under the curve [AUC] tot) with increasing  
dose of  plinabulin.  Inter -patient  variability  in AUC tot was large, suggesting individual 
differences in metabolism of the parent drug.  Maximal plasma concentration was observed at 
the end of infusion for most patients.  Distributive volumes (Vz  and Vss) were similar for all 
patients, and were indicative of the drug reaching deep compartments or being stored in 
peripheral compartments.  
There was no evidence of  any interaction between plinabulin and docetaxel with regard to 
plasma levels in the Phase 1b portion of Study NPI -2358- 101. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of plinabulin indicated C max and AUC were dose proportional over the 
range of 2 to 30 mg/m2 without evidence of drug accumulation.  The mean t ½ is 6.35 hours, the 
mean CL is 31 L/hour, and the mean Vz is 208 L for plinabulin as a single agent.   
6.2. Study Rationale  
6.2.1. Rationale for the Assessment of Bone Pain  
Generalized bone pain is a risk associated with the use of G -CSF and is correlated with the 
mech anism of action ( Lambertini et al, 2014).  A meta -analysis of 5 controlled trials indicates 
that the overall incidence of bone pain with G -CSF can range from 20% to 50% ( Lambertini et 
al, 2014; Kubista et al, 2003).  The overall incidence of mild- to-moderate bone pain attributed to 
G-CSF is approximately 24%, and overall incidence of severe bone pain can range from 1% to 
5% of patients ( Lambertini et al, 2014; Kubista et al, 2003).  The G -CSF-induced bone pain can 
lead to the discontinuation of this growth factor, which in turn can reduce the chemotherapy dose 
intensity (Kirshner et al, 2012). 
Generally, bone pain wi th pegfilgrastim reached its peak at Day 3 after dosing with pegfilgrastim 
on a scale of 1 to 10 ( Kirshner et al, 2012).  An AUV analysis of bone pain over at least 5 days 
after dosing with pegfilgrastim was previously employed to evaluate bone pain with 
pegfilgrastim ( Kirshner et al, 2012).  
G-CSFs mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells from the bone marrow into the systemic 
circulation ( Lambertini et al, 2014 ).  This progenitor -cell-mobilizing effect is an important 
reason why G -CSFs should wait 24 hours after the chemotherapy, and if administered sooner (ie, 
on the same day of chemotherapy), G -CSFs are known to lead to a paradoxical worsening of the

Protocol Amendment 7  
Date: 13 December 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page: 56 of 138 neutropenia ( Burris et al, 2010).  The possible biologic explanation for the increase in FN 
observed with same -day pegfilgrastim dosing, relates to G -CSFs release of bone marrow -derived 
hematopoietic progenitor cells, and that the stimulation of these  myeloid progenitor cells by 
G-CSFs makes these progenitor cells more sensitive to the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy 
(Burris et al, 2010).  Therefore, pegfilgrastim is not recommended to be administered on the 
same day but on the next day of chemotherapy ( Burris et al, 2010).  
A therapeutic intervention that is effective though a mechanism that is independent from 
mobilization of progenitor cells from the bone marrow has the potential to have superior e fficacy 
over G -CSFs, as this therapeutic intervention can be administered on the same day, shortly after 
the chemotherapy.  Since no bone marrow effects are involved, this agent should therefore also 
not cause bone pain. 
The absence of an effect on neutrop hil counts with plinabulin monotherapy (in the absence of 
chemotherapy), and the relative absence of bone pain with plinabulin, is indicative of differential 
mechanisms of action between plinabulin and G -CSF in the prevention of chemotherapy induced 
neutropenia. In addition, in contrast to G -CSFs, plinabulin has anti -cancer effect, which 
potentially represents an important advantage over G -CSFs, which do not have anti -cancer 
effects, or may even promote cancer growth, being a growth factor.  
Based on the bone pain data from the completed Phase 2 study NPI -2358- 101 in 90 patients on 
plinabulin (at the dose of 30 or 20 mg/m2), a significant bone pain benefit is expected with 
plinabulin compared to G -CSF, while having an at least comparable benefit on 
chemotherapy -induced neutropenia.  
The patient reported outcome bone pain is included as a secondary endpoint in the Phase 3 
portion of the present study. 
6.2.2. Rationale for the use of Plinabulin in the Prevention of Chemotherapy Induced 
Neutropenia  
Plinabulin is a small molecule with tumor -inhibiting and immune -enhancing effects.  Plinabulin 
induces dendritic cell maturation and cytokines interleukin- 1β (IL -1β), IL -6, and IL -12 
production, all of which are important in neutrophil survival.  In preclinical studies, plinabulin 
prevented docetaxel - or cyclophosphamide -induced neutropenia via a mechanism of action 
different from that of G -CSF analogues.  In Phase 1 and 2 solid tumor trials of plinabulin, which 
included >[ADDRESS_290131] neutropenia.  
Compared to docetaxel treatment alone, the addition of plinabulin to docetaxel significantly 
(p < 0.0003) reduced the proportion of patients with Grade 4 neutropenia from 33.3% to 4.6% in 
Cycle 1.  Figure  2 shows the proportions of patients with Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 
109/L) on Day 8, the approximate day after docetaxel administration corresponding to the largest 
reduction in ANC ( Blackw ell et al, 2015). Plinabulin also reduced the clinical sequelae 
associated with docetaxel -induced neutropenia (sepsis, infections, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], need for 
docetaxel dose reductions, and G -CSF use). Bone pain was reported in 4% of patients receiving 
plinabulin.  Plinabulin had a favorable safety profile; the most prominent finding was Grade 3 
transient hypertension in 20% and 5% of patients receiving 30 mg/m2 and 20 mg/m2 plinabulin, 
respectively ( Blayney D, et al, 2016).

reduced functional capacity compared to mature neutrophils to enable optimal innate immunity. 
Compared to mature neutrophils, immature neutrophils exert reduced ROS production leading to reduced microbicidal activity,  reduced phagocytic activity, reduced granularity, reduced ability 
to create NETs (Mackay G et al, Frontiers in Immunology 2019; Mortaz E et al Frontiers in 
Immunology 2018). Therefore an additional analysis will be made with mature neutrophil s only.
 
Plinabulin is a novel small molecule that is being developed for the mitigation of 
chemotherapy -induced neutropenia.  Administered by [CONTACT_239194] 
(approximately 1 hour after) chemotherapy, plinabulin will be given in a single dose to be 
determined per cycle.  Plinabulin has the potential to be an effective, safe (with much less bone 
pain), cost -effective, and convenient alternative to G -CSF for the prevention of 
chemotherapy -induced neutropenia ( Kuderer et al, 2006 ). 
6.2.3. Rationale for the Selection of the Recommended Phase [ADDRESS_290133] of plinabulin on docetaxel -induced 
neutropenia.  The population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model developed was used to 
perform simulations.  Daily sampling for neutrophils was implemented to enable accurate delineation of t he efficacy metrics, duration of severe neutropenia (DSN; number of days with an 
ANC of < 0.5 x 10
9/L), duration of moderate and severe neutropenia (DMSN; number of days 
with an ANC of < 1.0 x 109/L ), and area over the curve (AOC), which measure the durat ion and 
severity of neutropenia. The results were summarized by [CONTACT_144169] 5, 10, and 20 mg/m2 
studied in the Phase 2 portion of the present study. 
Based on AOC, DMSN, and DSN, 20 mg/m2 of plinabulin performed better than the 5 and 
10 mg/m2 doses, and was  therefore the recommended dose for the Phase [ADDRESS_290134] on QT interval are taken into account. 
Simulations were also performed to determine the fixed dose of plinabulin that is similar to the 
body surface area (BSA) -based dose of 20 mg/m2.  Simulations were performed with plinabulin 
fixed doses of 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg and compared with the selected BSA -based dose of 
20 mg/m2 as the reference, assuming a similar population as that studied in the Phase 2 portion of 
the study and used in the BSA -based dosing simulations.  The  40 mg fixed dose yielded similar 
peak concentration and AUC as the body surface area -based dose of   20 mg/m2, indicating that 
subjects are not predicted to be at any risk of over or under exposure to plinabulin at this dose.  
The efficacy performance of the 40 mg fixed dose is predicted to be similar to that of the 
BSA -based dose of 20 mg/m2.  The 60 a nd 80 mg fixed doses yielded results similar to the 
40 mg fixed dose.  Thus, a fixed plinabulin dose of 40 mg is predicted to yield a similar efficacy 
as a BSA -based dose of 20 mg/m2.

In Phase 2, patient s only with advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failing platinum- based 
therapy  will be enrolled.  
In Phase 3, patients with one of the following will be enrolled: advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer, who have failed < 5 prior lines of chemotherapy; locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC 
after platinum therapy failure; or hormone refractory (androgen independent) metastatic prostate cancer.  
The eligibility of all patients will be determined during a 28 -day screening period.   
Phase 2 (Open Label):  
Approximately 40 patients with advanced and metastatic NSCLC will be enrolled.  Patients are 
randomly assigned, with approximately 10 patients enrolled in each arm, with the arm 
designation and planned intervention as follows:  
Arm 1: Docetaxel (75 mg/m
2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg)  
Arm 2: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (20 mg/m2)  
Arm 3: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (10 mg/m2)  
Arm 4: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (5 mg/m2)  
The study will be temporarily closed to enrollment when [ADDRESS_290141] 1 treatment cycle in each arm in phase 2.  The Sponsor will notify the study

Once the study is temporarily closed to enrollment in phase 2, a PK/PD analysis will be 
performed to determine the RP 3D. The PK/PD analysis will be done by [CONTACT_239195] [ADDRESS_290142] Cycle 1.  
Phase 3 (Double Blind):  
Phase 3 will not begin until RP3D has been determined based on the phase 2 PK/PD analysis as 
mentioned a bove; the  RP3D will be the only plinabulin dose administered in Phase  3.  
A fixed dose of 40 mg has been selected as the RP3D following the Phase 2  PK/PD analysis 
(details of dose selection are provided in Section 6.2.3).  
Approximately 150 patients are planned to be enrolled in the Phase 3 with one of the following diagnosis: advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who have failed < 5 prior lines of chemotherapy; locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after platinum therapy fai lure; or hormone 
refractory (androgen independent) metastatic prostate cancer.  Each eligible patient will be

non-Asia).  Patients will be randomly assigned wit h equal probability (1:1 ratio) or 75:75, with 
the arm designation and planned intervention as follows:  
Arm 1: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg) + placebo matching plinabulin 
Arm 2: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (40 mg) + placebo matching pegfilgrastim 
In order to facilitate balanced treatment arms with respect to cancer type, once either arm reaches 
at least 1/3 (of total) of patients with that cancer type, it will be closed to that cancer type and 
enrollment will continue for patients with the other cancer types, up to the planned maximum 
number of patients.  
Data from all patients receiving the RP3D plinabulin dose  in Phase 2 and Phase 3 will not be pooled for assessing the primary and secondary study endpoints, but analyzed separately.  
Treatment Administration: 
In Phase [ADDRESS_290143] of docetaxel 75 mg/m
2 administered by [CONTACT_239196] 1 over 60 minutes (±5 minutes) every 21 days.   
In the phase 2 portion, on Day 1 of each cycle, 1.5 hours (± 10 minutes) aft er the start time of 
docetaxel infusion (i.e., approximately 30 minutes after the end of docetaxel infusion), patients 
assigned to a plinabulin arm (arms 2- 4) will get a single intravenous infusion of plinabulin at 
their assigned dose over 30 minutes (±  5 minutes) .  Thus the wait time between end of docetaxel 
infusion and start of the plinabulin infusion is approximately 30 minutes. On Day 2 of each cycle, ≥24 hours after completing chemotherapy, patients assigned to pegfilgrastim (arm 1) will receive a sin gle dose of pegfilgrastim (6 mg) (subcutaneous injection).  
In the phase 3 portion, on Day 1 of each cycle, 1.5 hours (± 10 minutes) after the start time of 
docetaxel infusion (i.e., approximately 30 minutes after the end of docetaxel infusion), patients 
will get a single dose of plinabulin or placebo intravenously over 30 minutes (±  5 minutes) .  On 
Day 2 of each cycle, ≥24 hours after completing chemotherapy, patients will receive a single 
dose of pegfilgrastim (6 mg) or placebo (subcutaneous injection).
   
If a chemotherapy cycle is delayed by [CONTACT_726] 3 weeks, the patient will be withdrawn from the study.  If a critical AE occurs during the cycle, the dosage of docetaxel may be reduced 20% in the next cycle.  Only one docetaxel dose reduction is allowed (refer to Taxotere® (Prescribing Information) ).  No dose reductions are allowed with plinabulin or pegfilgrastim.  
All patients, including patients who withdraw from the study early, will complete a safety follow -up visit 30 days (± 2 days)  after the last dose of study drug. Patients who withdraw for 
progressive disease and who will continue to another chemotherapy regimen will complete the EOT visit at Cycle X Day 21. They then continue to another chemotherapy regimen and do not need to have the safety follow -up visit (where X is the last cycle prior to progression, and is 4 or 
less).  
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the patient will benefit from more than 4 cycles of docetaxel 
and open label pegfilgrastim, then the fifth cycle will not start until completion of the EOT visit 
(in this instance, the EOT visit will be Cycle 4 Day 21). Follow -up visits will be required to 
monitor for ongoing treatment -related AEs.  All patients experiencing drug -related toxicities of ≥  
Grade [ADDRESS_290144] monthly until the AE(s) resolves to ≤

The method of follow -up assessment will be at the Investigator’s discretion (for example, patient 
site visit or telephone call).  All deaths which occur within [ADDRESS_290145] results (hematology and serum chemistry) will be collected via a central 
laboratory.  Safety laboratory tests are required prior to treatment on Day 1 of each cycle and can 
be collected by a local laboratory; however, all other scheduled blood samples as per the 
schedule assessments and procedure table must also be obtained for central laboratory assessment.  Urinalysis will be performed at screening only.

patients will be contact[CONTACT_239197] -cancer 
therapy, which could be cytotoxic chemotherapy, a programmed death- ligand 1 (PD -L1) 
inhibitor, radiation therapy, or other therapy. This assessment will continue until the patient starts 
another anti -cancer therapy, the patient chooses to have no further therapy, the patient dies, or 
the p atient becomes lost to follow -up. This information will be used to analyze the time to next 
treatment.  
This will be performed in addition to any follow up for monitoring of ongoing treatment -related 
AEs, as described above.  
Patients without progressive dis ease at the EOT visit will undergo a follow -up visit every 
2 months until the occurrence of either disease progression or death. These visits may be 
conducted per telephone or other means.  
 For patients included into the P hase 3 part of the study after November 2019, there will be a  
long- term safety follow -up through patient contacts by [CONTACT_112660], letters or electronic 
means; or medical records reviews will be conducted to all subjects approximately every 6 months up to 5 years to monitor long term safe ty of plinabulin. Follow -up telephone calls 
and queries of treating physicians or designee health care provider to ascertain safety information on secondary malignancies or tumor progression as well as other potential safety findings/concerns. Subjects who receive at least one dose of plinabulin or pegfilgrastim will be followed up.

Patients will receive treatment with stu dy drug up to 4 cycles in this study; thereafter patients 
may continue receiving docetaxel and pegfilgrastim at the Investigator’s discretion.  Patients will 
complete a safety follow -up visit 30 days (± 2 days) after the last dose of study drug. If, in the  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the patient will benefit from more than 4 cycles of docetaxel and open label pegfilgrastim, then the fifth cycle will not start until completion of the EOT visit (in this instance, the EOT visit will be Cycle 4 Day 21). The sa fety follow -up visit does not need to 
be performed in this case. The same situation applies for patients with progressive disease who need another chemotherapy treatment, they also will perform the EOT visit at Cycle X Day 21 and continue to the next chemotherapy regimen (where X is the last cycle prior to progression, and is 4 or less). The safety follow -up visit is not applicable in these cases.  
If a patient develops a positive viral load during the study, chemotherapy should be held for a maximum of 21 days.  If the viral load returns to zero treatment can be restarted, otherwise the patient should be withdrawn from the study.

10.1. Study Treatment  
The study drugs under evaluation are plinabulin and pegfilgrastim.  Placebo -matching plinabulin 
and pegfilgrastim will also be used as part of the study design. 
10.1.1. Treatments Administered  
Patients will be included in either Phase 2 or Phase 3 parts of the study (Table 2  and Table 3 ): 
Phase 2 (Open Label) (approximately 10 patients per arm with advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC after failing platinum -based therapy):  
Arm 1: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg)  
Arm 2: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (20 mg/m2)  
Arm 3: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (10 mg/m2)  
Arm 4: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (5 mg/m2)  
In the phase 2 portion, on Day 1 of each cycle, 1.5 hours (± 10 minutes)  after the start time of 
docetaxel infusion (i.e., approximately 30 minutes after the end of docetaxel infusion), patients 
assigned to a plinabulin arm (arms 2- 4) will get a single intravenous infusion of plinabulin at 
their assigned dose over 30 minutes ( ± 5 minutes) .  Thus the wait time between end of docetaxel 
infusion and start of the plinabulin infusion is approximately 30 minutes. On Day 2 of each cycle, ≥24 hours after completing chemotherapy, patients assigned to pegfilgrastim (arm 1) will receive a single dose of pegfilgrastim (6 mg) (subcutaneous injection).  
Phase 3 (Double Blind) (a planned [ADDRESS_290163] failed < 5 prior lines of chemotherapy; locally advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC after pla tinum therapy failure; or hormone refractory [androgen independent] 
metastatic prostate cancer):  
Arm 1: Docetaxel (75  mg/m
2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg) + placebo matching plinabulin 
Arm 2: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (40 mg)  + placebo matching pegfilgras tim 
All patients with HRPC also are given prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily continuously in 
addition to docetaxel (see Taxotere® (Prescribing Information)  as well as other assigned study 
drugs. 
In the phase 3 portion, on Day 1 of each cycle, 1.5 hours (± 10 minutes) after the start time of 
docetaxel infusion (i.e., approximately 30 minutes after the end of docetaxel infusion), patients 
will get a single dos e of plinabulin or placebo intravenously over 30 minutes (±  5 minutes) .  On 
Day 2 of each cycle, ≥24 hours after completing chemotherapy, patients will receive a single 
dose of pegfilgrastim (6 mg) or placebo (subcutaneous injection).   
Rescue Treatment:  
Patients who experience an FN event in Cycle 1 should be discussed with the medical monitor.  The blinding will be broken (if Phase 3) , and patients assigned to plinabulin will receive 
pegfilgrastim in subsequent cycles. If a patient was origina lly assigned to the pegfilgrastim arm,

Patients in Ph ase 3 will be stratified based on his or her tumor type (breast cancer, NSCLC, 
HRPC) and region (Asia, non- Asia).  Patients will be randomized using IWRS to 1 of the 
following treatment groups:  
Phase 2 (approximately 10 patients in each arm):  
Arm 1: Doceta xel (75 mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg)   
Arm 2: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (20 mg/m2)  
Arm 3: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (10 mg/m2)  
Arm 4: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (5 mg/m2)  
Phase 3 (75 patients enrolled in each arm):  
Arm 1: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + placebo matching plinabulin + pegfilgrastim (6 mg)  
Arm 2: Docetaxel (75  mg/m2) + plinabulin (40 mg)  + placebo matching pegfilgrastim  
10.3.3. Treatment Allocation  
Phase 2 Open Label:  
During randomization, patients and all personnel involved i n the conduct of the study and 
interpretation of results, including investigators, site personnel, and sponsor staff will be notified 
of treatment allocation.  A master list of all treatments and the patient numbers associated with the treatments will be maintained by [CONTACT_76693], the IWRS vendor, and the sponsor. 
Phase 3 Double Blind:  
During randomization, patients and all personnel involved with the conduct and interpretation of 
the study, including Investigators, site personnel, and sponsor staff will be blinded to the 
treatment codes.  Randomization data will be kept strictly confidential, filed securely by [CONTACT_239202] (CRO) and accessible only to authorized persons. 
A master list of all treatments and the patient numbers associated with the treatments will be 
maintained in a sealed envelope by [CONTACT_76693], the IWRS vendor, and the 
sponsor.  In the event that emergency conditions require knowledge of the study treatm ent given, 
the blind may be broken via the code breaker facility within the IWRS.  Emergency procedures 
for revealing drug codes are provided in the study manual.  If possible, before breaking the blind, 
the Investigator should consult with the sponsor to ascertain the necessity of breaking the code.  
10.4. Dosage and Administration  
10.4.1. Plinabulin or Matching Placebo  
In the Phase 2 portion, plinabulin will be administered at a dose of 5 mg/m2, 10 mg/m2, and 
20 mg/m2.  In the Phase 3 portion of the study, plinabulin wi ll be administered at a fixed dose of 
40 mg and the study matching placebo of plinabulin will be administered in an equal volume.

Protocol Amendment 7  
Date: 13 December 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page: 76 of 138 10.4.2. Pegfilgrastim or Matching Placebo  
In the Phase 2 portion, pegfilgrastim will be administered at a dose of 6 mg as a single dose 
syringe.  In the Phase 3 portion,  pegfilgrastim will be administered at a dose of 6 mg as a single 
dose syringe and the study matching placebo of pegfilgrastim will be administered in an equal 
volume. 
The Investigator and study site staff should be experienced in the use of pegfilgrastim and 
familiar with the pegfilgrastim prescribing information provided by [CONTACT_3455].  Pegfilgrastim should be obtained from the institutional pharmacy and prepared per institutional 
protocol.  United State s Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) approved source of 
pegfilgrastim is required for use in this study.  The recommended dosage of pegfilgrastim is a 
single subcutaneous injection of [ADDRESS_290167] parenteral drug products for particulat e matter and 
discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.  Do not administer 
pegfilgrastim if discoloration or particulates are observed.  NOTE: The needle cover on the single -use prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (latex); persons with latex allergies 
should not administer this product.  Follow institutional guideline/practice for prevention/assessment/management of hypersensitivity/infusion reaction with pegfilgrastim administration ( refer to Neulasta® Package Insert  for further details).  
10.4.3. Docetaxel  
Docetaxel will be administered at a dose of 75 mg/m
2. 
As a standard approved chemotherapy agent, the Investigator and study site staff should be 
experienced in the use of docetaxel and familiar with the docetaxel prescribing information 
provided by [CONTACT_3455].  Docetaxel should be obtained from the institutional pharmacy 
and prepared per institutional protocol.  US  FDA approved source of docetaxel is required for 
use in this study.  Docetaxel may be provided by a distributer in some regions by [CONTACT_239203].  Administration should be carried out with a 1- hour IV infusion per institutional 
protocol at the dose prescribed by [CONTACT_239204] (75 mg/m2).  Dexamethasone 
([ADDRESS_290168]) will be given on 
the day before, the day of (Day 1), and the day following docetaxel infusion (Day 2).  Follow 
institutional guideline/practice for prevention/assessment/management of 
hypersensitivity/infusion reaction with docetaxel administration ( refer to Taxotere® (Prescribing 
Information)  for further details). 
Docetaxel when given on a standard regimen (e.g., 75 mg/m2 IV every 3 weeks in non- small cell 
lung cancer) has an intermediate (10% -20%) risk of causing febrile neutropenia.  The NCCN 
guideline s recommend that physicians consider (but do not mandate) myeloid growth factor 
support in patients with ≥1 risk factor with docetaxel treatment (see below).  Patients without risk factors may be observed for their initial treatment cycle. If the patient e xperiences an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_239132] a dose limiting neutropenic event (a nadir or a day of treatment 
count impacting the planned dose of chemotherapy) during the previous treatment cycle, the 
patient should continue on study, and have dose adjustments as specified in Sections  10.5 and 
10.6.1.

10.5. Dose Interruptions and Modifications  
All adverse events should be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE, v4.03). In the e vent of multiple toxicities, dose delays and 
modifications should occur in accordance with the highest adverse events observed.  
All patients, including patients who withdraw from the study early, will complete a safety follow -up visit 30 days (± 2 days) af ter the last dose of study drug. Patients who withdraw for 
progressive disease and who will continue to another chemotherapy regimen will complete the 
EOT visit at Cycle X Day 21. They then continue to another chemotherapy regimen and do not 
need to have t he safety follow -up visit (where X is the last cycle prior to progression, and is 4 or 
less).  
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the patient will benefit from more than 4 cycles of docetaxel and open label pegfilgrastim, then the fifth cycle will not start until completion of the EOT visit 
(in this instance, the EOT visit will be Cycle 4 Day 21). Follow -up visits will be required to 
monitor for ongoing treatment -related AEs.  All patients experiencing drug -related toxicities of 
≥ Grade [ADDRESS_290169] monthly until the AE(s) resolves to 
≤ Grade 1, the event is considered to be chronic, or the patient receives other anti -cancer therapy. 
The method of follow -up assessment will be at the Investigator’s discretion (for example, patient 
site visit or telephone call). All deaths which occur within [ADDRESS_290170] a long term FU approximately every 6 months up to 5 years to 
monitor long term safety of plinabulin. These visits may be conducted per telephone or other 
means.  
As described in  Table 4, the occurrence o f specific Grade 3 or 4 AEs during chemotherapy will 
require a dose reduction, delay, or discontinuation. Only one docetaxel dose reduction is allowed (refer to Taxotere® (Prescribing Information)
 for further details). If a chemotherapy cycle is 
delayed by [CONTACT_726] 3 weeks, the patient will be withdrawn from the study. 
No dose reductions are allowed with plinabulin or pegfilgrastim. 
Docetaxel  
Dose reduction and treatment delay for docetaxel will follow guidance described in docetaxel 
prescribing information as summarized in Table 4.   
Hematologic support, such as erythropoietin, darbopoetin, granulocyte colony- stimulating factor 
(Neupogen® or Neulasta®), or red blood cell or platelet transfusions prior to [ADDRESS_290171] 
dose of study drug in order to meet entry criteria is not  permitted.

Please note the special instructions regarding Neupogen® or Neulasta® use during study 
treatment in Section 10.6.1. 
Any delay of docetaxel dosing will result in the delay of plinabulin administration.  For each 
cycle, the dose of plinabulin is always administered 30 minutes after the docetaxel infusion.  If 
docetaxel is discontinued, plinabulin will also be discontinued.

Every reasonable effort should be made to determine as completely as possible t he reason for the 
withdrawal, including contact[CONTACT_239205] a personal visit, or 
contact[CONTACT_30697] a responsible relative.  A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient’s 
withdrawal should be made with an explanation of  why the patient is withdrawing from the 
study. 
If the reason for removal of a patient from the study is an adverse event or an abnormal 
laboratory test result, the principal specific event or test will also be recorded on the eCRF.  
Patients with clearly d ocumented progressive disease will be taken off treatment. 
10.6. Concomitant Medications and Non -drug Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
10.6.1. Permitted Medications  
Institutional guidelines should be followed in the event of infusion/hypersensitivity reaction.  Diphenhydramine and dexamethasone infusion may be administered in the event of infusion reaction.  
All patients must be premedicated with oral corticosteroids (see below for HRPC) such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (e.g., 8 mg twice daily) for 3 days starting 1 day before doc etaxel 
administration in order to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well as the 
severity of hypersensitivity reactions (refer to Taxotere® (Prescribing Information) ). If the 
patient has trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], anxiety, stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache or 
swelling, they have the option to skip the 3rd day of Dexamethasone (or steroid equivalent) 
dosing, on the day after the day of docetaxel infusion. On the day before and on the day of 
docetaxel infusion, the patient must take their dexamethasone (or steroid equivalent) as per institution standard. 
For HRPC, given the concurrent use of prednisone, the recommended premedic ation regimen is 
oral dexamethasone 8 mg at 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before docetaxel infusion (refer to 
Taxotere® (Prescribing Information) . 
The prophylactic use of antibiotics is allowed per discretion of the treating physician.  The use of antibiotics will be recorded per treatment arm (refer Table 5 for prohibited medications).  
Corticosteroids (except as described for premedication) and new non -steroidal anti- inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) are prohibited except for the treatment of AEs and as premedication as described above.  Patients already receivi ng NSAIDs are allowed to continue taking treatment as 
long as the dose remains stable. 
The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors as concomitant medications will be prohibited because docetaxel exposure increases by [CONTACT_3450] 2 -fold (Section 10.6.2) with the use of strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors.  
Patients who have FN should receive antibiotics per standard of care (refer to Section  10.1.1 and

 The effect of grapefruit juice varies widely among brands and is concentration- , dose -, and preparation- dependent.  
studies have shown that it can be classified as  a “strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ” when a certain preparation was used 
(e.g., high dose, double strength) or as a “moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor” when another preparation was used (e.g., 
low dose, single strength).  
 Withdrawn from the US market.  
CYP = cytochrome P450  
 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are not permitted  as they may alter docetaxel exposure; consider 
therapeutic substitutions for these medications.  Approval from the Medical Monitor is required 
in these situations.  Please contact [CONTACT_239206]. 
10.6.3. Anti -emetics, Antidiarrheals, and Bowel Maintenance Regimens  
Docetaxel is low emetic risk (10% to 30% frequency of emesis) and appropriate anti -emetic 
prophylaxis should be given prior to study medication per institutional policy.  In this study, 
dexamethasone is used as anti -emetic prophylaxis as well as to minimize docetaxel associated 
fluid retention. 
If “breakthrough” emesis ( e.g. emesis and nausea after Day 1) occurs, the general strategy is to 
add one agent from a different drug class to the “rescue” anti -emesis regimen.  Useful 
anti-emetic agents for rescue include the benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cannabinoids (e.g. dronabinol or 
nabilone), haloperidol, metoclopramide, scopolamine, the phenothiazines (e.g. prochlorperaxine 
or promethazine) and 5HT3 receptor agonists. If a 5HT3 receptor agonist is needed, palonosetron

Suggested loperamide use: [ADDRESS_290183] be recorded on the CRF. 
In patients who develop diarrhea, use of a motility enhancing agent such as metoclopramide as 
part of the  anti-emetic regimen in subsequent treatment cycles should be avoided.   
Prophylaxis with bowel motility agents should follow institutional practice as applied to drugs such as vincristine, including the use of agents such as stool softeners, bulking agents, 
stimulating agents and/or dopamine antagonists.  The use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_239138].  If significant constipation develops, it should be 
managed immediately and plinabulin administration should be delayed until resolution.  Careful 
observance for signs of ileus and early diagnostic evaluation with radiographic and/or ultrasound

a. EOT is defined as the last assessment for the protocol -specified treatment post cycle 4 (Day 22 [+ 7 days]) of the study for an individual patient.  
b. If a patient discontinues the study, procedures should be performed within [ADDRESS_290190] dose of study drug.  
c. All patients, (inclu ding patients who withdraw from the study early), will complete a safety follow -up visit 30 (+7) days after the last dose.  Follow -up visits will be 
required to monitor for ongoing treatment -related adverse events.  All patients experiencing drug -related t oxicities of Grade  ≥ [ADDRESS_290191] monthly until the adverse event(s) resolves to Grade  ≤ 1, the event is considered to be chronic or the patient receives other anti -cancer therapy.  The 
method of follow -up assessment will be at the Investigator’s discretion (for example, patient site visit or telephone call). All deaths which occ ur within [ADDRESS_290192] be reported the Sponsor immediatel y and within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.  
d. Demographic data will include gender, date of birth (or age), and race/ethnicity.

Method 1 in Phase 2 ONLY, Cycle 1 Day 1 ONLY, using blood pressure devices provided by [CONTACT_456] (SpaceLabs [ZIP_CODE] ambulator y blood pressure 
monitor):  
• Day 1 (Arm  1): Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured semi -continuously st arting at 15 minutes after completion of docetaxel infusion, and at every 
15 minutes thereafter for 4.5  hours.  
• Day 1 (Arms  2 to 4): Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured semi -continuously starting at 15 minutes before plinabulin infusion (15 minut es after 
completion of docetaxel infusion), and at every 15 minutes thereafter for 4.5 hours after start of infusion with plinabulin.  
Method 2 in Phase 2 in Cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 as follows:  
A standard cuff will be used to measure blood pressure (heart rat e will also be measured):  
• Cycle 1 (Arms 1 to 4) : At screening, Day 1 (pre -docetaxel), Days  2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 , and 15 (once, prior to blood draw).  
• Cycles 2 to 4 (Arm 1): Day 1 pre -docetaxel dose, and on Day  8 prior to blood draw  
• Cycles 2 to 4 (Arms 2 to 4): On Day [ADDRESS_290195] -infusion with plinabulin, and on Day 8 
g. Temperature is to be taken every time a blood draw is taken for neutrophil count  and can be taken orally or in the ear; however, the same method (ear or oral)  should be 
used throughout the study for each patient; thus if the ear method was used the first time for a given patient, the ear method should be used throughout the study for that 
patient.  
h. Height (cm) will be measured at screening.  
i. A single 12-lead ECG wil l be performed at screening, EOT, Early Discontinuation and [ADDRESS_290196] samples (hematology and serum chemistry) will be collected and sent to the protocol central laboratory. Safet y laboratory tests are required prior to 
treatment on Day 1 of each cycle and can be collected by a local laboratory and will be us ed to determine docetaxel dosing; however, all other safety (e.g. protocol 
specified) blood samples as per the schedule assessments and procedure table must also be obtained for central laboratory ass essment. In addition a central laboratory 
blood draw nee ds to be taken on the day of dosing on Day 1 of each cycle, prior to the docetaxel dosing. Neutrophils are to be collected on time points as indicated in this 
schedule; neutrophils must be collected at pre -dose on Day 1 of each cycle. During Cycle 1, neutr ophils count  will be assessed at baseline (prior to Cycle 1 docetaxel 
dose), pre -dose on Day  1 and on Days 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 15.  
k. Analyzed at a central laboratory.  
l. CD34+ will be analyzed using FACS via a central laboratory.  
m. Samples for CD34+ analysis t o be collected at Day [ADDRESS_290197] infusion. Confirm with serum testing (central laboratory) if urine sample is positive.  
p. Plasma samples (5 mL each) for pli nabulin and docetaxel PK.  All patients will be sampled for PK via a central laboratory.  For PK collection schedule refer to  Table 13 
and Table  14 (see Section  11.9).  During the phase [ADDRESS_290198] samples collected for plinabulin 
PK analysis. Cytokine panel testing will be done using unused plasma samples collected at the PK time points; reconsenti ng of the patients will be required before 
analysis is performed.  
q. Investigator opi[INVESTIGATOR_239140] (yes/no) at End of Treatment (EOT) recorded in CRF. For example if the patient completes two cycles of docetaxel and study drug, 
and in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_239141] a new treatment is required, then the EOT evaluation wi ll be performed as 
specified, and the “disease progression” will be scored as “yes.”  As an another example, if after four cycles o f docetaxel and study drug, the cancer is stable or 
responding, and the patient receives further docetaxel, then the EOT evaluation will be completed as specified, and the “disease progression” will be scored as “no”. 
Patients without progressive disease a t the EOT visit will undergo a follow -up visit every 2 months until the occurrence of either disease progression or death. These 
visits may be conducted per telephone or other means.

11.2.5. Temperature 
The temperature location (ear,oral, or axillary) selected for a patient should be the same 
throughout the study.   
If abnormalities are found and they are considered an AE, record on the AE summary page. If an 
isolated elevated temperature is not clinically significant, it should not be reported as an AE. If 
an elevated temperature is part of an AE that is reported elsewh ere, elevated temperature (fever) 
should not be reported as an AE.  
11.2.6. Physical Examinations, Height, and Weight  
Physical examinations (comprehensive [including neurological examination] or symptom directed) will be performed as described in Table [ADDRESS_290220] (including 
heart and lungs), abdomen, limbs, skin, and a complete neurological examination.  A urogenital 
examination will only be required in the presence of clinical symptoms related t o this region.  
Documentation of the physical examination will be included in the source documentation at the 
site.  Significant findings at the screening Visit will be recorded on the CRF.  Changes from the 
screening physical examination findings that mee t the definition of an AE will be recorded on 
CRF.  
Height will be measured in centimeters once at screening.  Weight will be measured in kilograms at screening, prior to Day  1 dosing in all cycles and at the end of treatment (EOT) visit.  For 
Cycle 1, body weight will also be measured on Days  2 and 6.  The body weight measurements 
are made to enable the calculation of the plinabulin dose and to monitor for potential weight increase due to the docetaxel pre -medication. Both measurements will be performed without the 
patient wearing shoes.  
11.2.7. Performance Status  
Patients will be graded according to the ECOG Performance Status scale and criteria as 
described in  Table 9.  
Table  9: ECOG Performance Status  
ECOG Scale  
0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre -disease performance without restriction

11.2.8. Electrocardiogram  
A single 12- lead ECG will be performed at screening and triplicate ECGs will be taken for 
Phase 2 ( Table 10 ) and Phase 3 ( Table 11).  
ECGs are to be performed using a standardized method before blood draws or any other 
procedures.  The patient must be in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_33197] a rested and calm state for at least 
[ADDRESS_290221] recumbent position as possible.   
In Phase 2 and Phase  3, single safety ECGs will be obtained during screening, at the EOT, Early 
Discontinuation (Phase 2 only), and at 30- day safety follow -up visit for all  patients.  ECG in 
triplicate with 2 -3 minutes between measurements will be obtained in Phase  2 (Arms  2 to 4 only) 
and Phase  3 on Cycle 1 Day 1 (in both arms) before docetaxel infusion, immediately before 
plinabulin infusion, 5 minutes before end of plinabulin infusion, 60 minutes (30 minutes in 
Phase 2) and 4.5 hours after start of infusion with plinabulin or matching placebo. On Cycle  1 
Day 2, ECG in triplicate will be obtained prior to blood draws in Arms 2 to 4 (Phase  2) or prior 
to pegfilgrastim/placebo injection in both arms (Phase  3).  
For Arm  1 of Phase  2, the triplicate ECGs will not be obtained; so the only assessments will be 
the single ECGs at screening, end of treatment, early discontinuation, and follow -up. 
The ECG must include the  following measurements: heart rate, QRS, QT, and PR intervals.

11.2.9. Health -Related Quality of Life Questionnaire Evaluated with EORTC QLQ- C30 
and EQ -5D-5L 
Health -related QoL questionnaire evaluated with EORTC QLQ -C30 and EQ -5D-5L is a 
validated questionnaire developed to assess the QoL of cancer patient s. 
It is a copyrighted instrument, which has been translated and validated in over 90 languages and 
used in more than 3,000 studies worldwide.   
Refer to the study manual for specific module and how to administer. 
11.2.10. Bone Pain Inventory (Short Form) (Phase 2 Only)  
The incidences of bone pain will be recorded through a validated questionnaire. The bone pain 
questionnaire should be completed prior to docetaxel infusion and at the site if possible, if not the questionnaire needs to be returned to the site at the next scheduled visit  
11.2.11. Patient Bone Pain Scale and Pain Medication Assessment (Phase 3 only)  
The incidences, occurrences, and severity of bone pain will be recorded through a patient bone 
pain scale during Cycle 1, at the times presented in Table 7.  
The bone pain scale will be based upon the validated Wong Baker Faces
® Pain Rating Scale 
(http://wongbakerfaces.org).  
The bone pain scale and pain medication assessment should be completed on Day 1 prior to 
docetaxel infusion and on each remaining day through Day 8 at approximately the same time. On  
Days 2, 6, 7, and 8 the patient will complete the bone pain scale and pain medication assessment 
at the investigational site.  If the patient is discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41337] 8, the bone pain 
scale and pain medication assessment pages for the remaining days will be handed to the patient

BeyondSpring Pharmaceuticals, Inc.    
 
Protocol Amendment 7  
Date: 13 December 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page: 98 of 138 
 with the date field completed by [CONTACT_239210].  The patient 
will be instructed to fill in the documents at home, approximately at the same time as on Day 1. 
On each day following the patient’s discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239144], they will return any available completed assessments.  
Increases of bone pain severity are assessed as an objective during Phase 3 of the study, using the 
bone pain scale (“Please rate your bone pain by [CONTACT_239211] r pain at its worst in the last 24 hours ”). The severity of pain is marked on a 
scale from 0 (‘no hurt’) to 10 (‘hurt worst’).  
Concomitant pain medication use will be recorded via a pain medication assessment. Information recorded for concomitant pain medication use will include date, name [CONTACT_2100], route of 
administration, dosage, total taken in one day, and reason medication was taken.  
11.3. Efficacy  
Efficacy assessments and the time when they will be performed are presented in  Table 6 and 
Table 7.   
11.3.1. Disease Progression  
Patients will be evaluated for disease progression in accordance with institutional practice.  For 
example, the investigator may identify target lesions at screening, and at the EOT visit will assess the patient’s response to the docetaxel and study drug.  Thi s will be designated the 
patient’s treatment response.  If no reliable target lesions are identifiable (e.g. patients with bone -
only cancer metastases), institutional response criteria will be used for recording disease 
progression.  
Investigators should exercise their clinical judgment in performing studies (including computed tomography and positron emission tomography scans) to assess disease progression, and can end 
study treatment if a patient is clearly having disease progression prior to the completion of the 
planned 4 cycles of chemotherapy.  If a patient is taken off -study prior to completing 4 cycles of 
docetaxel and study drug, the screening and end of study images, when clinically indicated, will 
be performed.  If the patient completes four cycles  of docetaxel and study drug, and there is not 
disease progression and the docetaxel is continued, then the EOT assessment of disease 
progression will be recorded as “no.”  
The investigator will submit supporting documentation for the treatment response det ermination, 
which could include reports from cross -sectional imaging,  laboratory values, and performance 
status estimates (before and at the end of study treatment), and this data will support the 
investigator’s determination in the CRF as disease progres sion “yes” or “no”. Source documents 
supporting the investigator’s judgment of disease progression will be reviewed, but images (such 
as CT scan, MRI etc.) or other documents will not be collected for central review. The disease 
progression will be judged by [CONTACT_093]. 
The assessment of disease progression during the follow -up period for patients assessed as 
non-progressive at the EOT visit does not need to be reported, only the determination of disease 
progression will be collected.

 (Note: a requir ement for a target lesion or for “measurable disease” is not required for study 
entry.)  
11.4. Safety  
Safety assessments should be performed at all visits to the study center and throughout the study.  
The list of events and the time when they will be performed a re presented in  Table [ADDRESS_290224] dose of the study drug. 
All AEs, SAEs, treatment emergent AEs, treatment emergent SAEs, and treatment emergent 
deaths regardless of the relationship to the study drug, will be collected.  
Disease progression or deterioration of the malignancy under study (including new sites of 
metastasis due to disease progression) will be recorded as part of the subject's disease status a nd 
should not be reported as an AE/SAE. If death is determined to be due to disease progression, the 
SAE form will attribute the death to disease progression and document that disease progression was determined to have caused the event(s). These events will not be included in the safety analysi s. 
The Sponsor will collect all deaths on study regardless of its potential relationship to disease progression and up to [ADDRESS_290225] dose of plinabulin on an SAE form. 
All hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239145]. 
11.4.2. Concomitant Medicatio ns 
All concomitant medications and in particular all analgesics, pain medications, and antibiotics 
should be recorded with date of onset and discontinuation, dose, and frequency will be entered 
into the eCRF. 
11.5. Healthcare Resource Utilization  
Information on all cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (including ICU) and ER visits will be collected at all visits to the study center and throughout the study, at end of study and during any follow -up post 
study (except for FU visits for patients without disease progression at the  EOT visit).  
11.6. Laboratory Evaluations  
Chemistry, coagulation tests, hematology, and urinalysis will be performed using a central laboratory and serum pregnancy testing and hepatitis serology will be performed using a local or central laboratory; results will be used to determine docetaxel dosing.  Safety laboratory tests are 
required prior to treatment on Day 1 of each cycle and can be collected by a local laboratory; 
however, all other safety (e.g. protocol specified) blood samples as per the schedule of assessments (refer to Table 6 and Table 7 ) must a lso be obtained for central laboratory

 assessment. In addition a central laboratory blood draw needs to be taken on the day of dosing on 
Day 1 of each cycle, prior to the docetaxel dosing. 
The Sponsor or the central laboratories will supply containers for sample collection, preparation, 
packaging, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Detailed instructions for sample collection, processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_239146]/or the Sponsor will provide training materials.  The date and time of sample collection will be recorded in the source documents at the site.

infusion. Confirm with serum testing (local or central laboratory) if urine sample is positive.  
Additional testing may be performed at the discretion of the investigator. 
11.6.2. Hepatitis B/C Testing  
Hepatitis B/C serologic markers (hepatitis C antibody, HBsAg, viral load in case HBsAG is 
positive and anti -HBs) will be tested. If HBsAg is positive but viral load is negative, the patient 
should be tested prior to each treatment cycle to ensure that viral load remains negative. 
Hepatitis (hepatitis C antibody, HBsAg, viral load and anti -HBs) serology can be perf ormed 
using laboratory standard methodology, by [CONTACT_239212] (not for viral load).  
11.7. End of Treatment Assessment  
EOT is defined as the last assessment for the protocol -specified treatment pos t Cycle X (Day  22 
[+ 7 days]) of the study for an individual patient, regardless at what time the patient discontinues 
the study. 
11.7.1. Exploratory Markers  
Phase 2 only: a blood sample for exploratory marker evaluation will be collected for CD34 + 
which will be e stablished by [CONTACT_7811]. This test will be performed in selected countries 
participating in the study, via central laboratory.  
Phase 2 and Phase 3: Plasma cytokine panel: IL -1beta, IL -6, IL -12p70, IL -12p40, IL -17A, IL -23, 
GCSF, GMCSF, IFN alpha, IFN -gamma, TNF -alpha, IL -2, FLT -[ADDRESS_290228] will be performed in selected countries participating in the study, using unused plasma 
samples collected at PK time points.  
Unused samples (urine/serum plasma) will also be saved for future potentia l biomarker research, 
with patient consent. 
11.7.2. HIV Testing  
If HIV testing is done (at the discretion of the investigator), the test will be conducted at the local 
site using standard methodology. 
11.8. Safety Follow-up/End of Study Assessment  
All patients, including patients who withdraw from the study early, should complete a safety 
follow -up visit 30 (± 2) days after the last dose ( refer to Table 6 and Table 7). Patients who 
withdraw for progressive disease and who will continue to another chemotherapy regimen will 
complete the EOT visit at Cycle X Day 21. They then continue to another chemotherapy regimen 
and do not need to have the safety follow -up visit (where X is the last cycle prior to progression, 
and is 4 or less). If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the patient will benefit from more than 
4 cycles of docetaxel and open label pegfilgrastim, then the fifth cycle will not start until

 completion of the EOT visit (in this instance, the EOT visit will be Cycle 4 Day 21). Follow -up 
visits will be required to monitor for ongoing treatment -related AEs . All patients experiencing 
drug- related toxicities of ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_290229] monthly until 
the adverse event(s) resolves to ≤  Grade 1, the event is considered to be chronic, or the patient 
receives other anti -cancer ther apy. The method of follow -up assessment will be at the 
Investigator’s discretion (for example, patient site visit or telephone call).  All deaths which 
occur within [ADDRESS_290230] be r eported the Sponsor  immediately and within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.  
Patients without progressive disease at the EOT visit will undergo a follow -up visit every 
2 months until the occurrence of either disease progression or death. These visit s may be 
conducted per telephone or other means.  
The assessment of disease progression during the follow -up period for patients assessed as 
non-progressive at the EOT visit does not need to be reported, only the determination of disease 
progression will be collected.  
11.8.1  Long- term Safety Follow -up (up to 5 years)  
The long- term safety follow -up through patient contacts by [CONTACT_112660], letters or electronic 
means; or medical records reviews will be conducted to all subjects approximatel y every 6 
months up to 5 years to monitor long term safety of plinabulin. Follow -up telephone calls and 
queries of treating physicians or designee  healthcare provider  to ascertain safety information on 
secondary malignancies or tumor progression as well as  other potential safety findings/concerns. 
Subjects from each treatment arm will be followed up. Subjects who receive at least one dose of 
plinabulin or pegfilgrastim  will be followed up. 
 
Safety endpoints to be collected include;  
• Disease progression  
• Disease relapse (local, regional or distant)  
• Second primary tumors  
• Health status check, including autoimmune and hematological disorders  
• Any further anti-cancer treatment information  
• Reporting of medical problems, including information on unexpected hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239148] (including SAEs)

 12. DATA HANDLING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Data management will be the responsibility of the Sponsor.  CRFs and edit checks will be 
designed and validated based on protocol require ments for data collection and with input from 
the statistical, data management and clinical operations staff.   
12.1. Data Collection  
Data will be captured by [CONTACT_239213] (EDC) system.  Data collected 
in patient source documents will be entered onto the eCRFs by [CONTACT_96577], and subject to an 
audit trail of changes made to the eCRF.  For each patient enrolled, an eCRF must be completed and electronically signed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_239149].  
The investigator should ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data reported to the sponsor/ CRO in the eCRFs.  Data will be stored in files that can be accessed through listing exports. 
12.2. Data Management/Coding  
A CRO will be responsible for data management, including quality checking of the data.  During the data entry and verification process, edit check programs will identify data discrepancies and, automatically generate queries.  Query reports will be sent to sites or to laboratories for 
resol ution.  The sites will correct the data as needed to resolve the queries.  Any data captured 
electronically (such as laboratory results) will be transferred to the database electronically and 
edit checks will be programmed to search for missing and out of range data.  For electronically 
transferred data, the laboratory is expected to re -send the data transferred with the correction 
applied.  Per Sponsor’s or designee’s operating procedures, an audit trail will be maintained. 
Throughout the study, the Study Management Team will review data according to the Edit 
Specifications Document as described in the Data Management Plan.  
12.3. Quality Assurance  
The database will be audited for quality assurance by [CONTACT_239214] a predefined study audit plan to ensure acceptable accuracy and completeness.

Date: 13 December 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page: [ADDRESS_290234] a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can, therefore , be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  Pre -existing condi tions, which worsen during a study, are to be reported as 
AEs.  
All AEs encountered during the clinical study, irrespective of the likelihood that the event is 
related to disease progression, will be reported on the AE page of the CRF.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of Severity  
Whenever possible, the intensity of clinical AEs will be gr aded according to NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (v 4.03) grading system.  Adverse events not 
listed on the NCI -CTCAE grading system will be graded on a 5 -point scale (mild, moderate, 
severe, life- threatening, and death) as desc ribed below, and reported in detail as indicated on the 
CRF (Study Manual).  
Severity Grading for AEs not listed in NCI -CTCAE (v4.03)  
Grade 1:  Mild  – Transient or mild discomfort; no medical intervention or therapy required. 
Grade 2:  Moderate – Moderate dis comfort or limitation in activity – some assistance may 
be needed or minimal medical intervention or therapy required.  
Grade 3:  Severe – Marked limitation in activity, some assistance required; medical 
intervention or therapy required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239150]. 
Grade 4:  Life Threatening – Extreme limitation in activity; significant assistance required; 
significant medical intervention or therapy required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114956]. 
Grade 5:  Death  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship to Study Drug  
The investigator will assess the po ssible relationship of a AE or SAE to the use of study drug.  
An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generally, the facts  
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.   
The following grading of causality will be used for this study:

 • Related:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the event, 
and the event occurred within a plausible time relationship to drug administration, and the 
event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_239215], concurrent disease, other drugs or chemicals, or other circumstances. The event responds to withdrawal of study drug (dechallenge) and recurs with rechallenge (if clinically feasible to rechallenge).  
• Probable:  There is reasonable causal relationship between the event and the study drug, 
the event occurred within plausible time relationship to drug administration, the event is unlikely to be attributed to the condition under study, concurrent disease, other drugs or chemicals, or other circumstances. The event follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal of study drug. 
• Possible:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the event and study drug, the 
event occurred within a plausible time relationship to study drug administration, but the 
event could also possibly be explained by [CONTACT_239215], concurrent disease, 
other drugs or chemicals, or other circumstances. Dechallenge information is lacking or 
unclear.  
• Unlikely:  There is a temporal relationship of the event to study drug but not a reasonable 
causal relationship, or there is no temporal relationship to study drug administration or the condition under study, concurrent disease, other drugs or chemicals, or other circumstances provide a plausible explanation for the event.  
• Unrelated:  There is no temporal relationship between the event and study drug 
administration (too early or late or study drug not admini stered). There is no reasonable 
causal relationship between the event and the study drug. The condition under study, 
concurrent disease, other drugs or chemicals, or other circumstances provides a plausible 
explanation for the event.  
For the purposes of regulatory reporting a causality assessment of related, probable, or possible, 
will be treated as related.  
If the investigator’s causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational product”, this should be clearly documented on study records.   
In addition, if the investigator determines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the 
investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follow -Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
For the purpose of this study, AEs irrespective of causality will be collected from first study drug 
administration (Study Day 1) and all SAEs irrespective of causality will be collecte d from the 
time the Informed Consent Form is signed.  AEs and SAEs will be collected until [ADDRESS_290235] dose of study drug (even if the study has stopped).

they result in a clinically significant condition as judged by [CONTACT_093]. 
13.2. Serious Adverse Events  
13.2.1. Definitions  
The definition and reporting requirements of International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions and Standards for Expedited reporting, Topic E2 will be adhered to.  
An SAE is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precauti on.  With respect to human clinical experience, this includes any experience which:  
• is fatal,  
• is life -threatening,  
• requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
• is considered medically significant by [CONTACT_239216] 1 or other of the outcomes listed above,  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deci ding whether expedited reporting to 
the Sponsor is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239151] 1 of the outcomes listed in the definitions above.  These 
situations should also usually be considered serious. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  The term severe is a measure of intensity, thus 
an SAE is not necessarily serious.  For example, nausea of several hours’ duration may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239152] (see 
regulatory definition above) and N OT for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239153]. If a patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239154]; administration of growth factors; elective surgery; 
social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]; or economic reasons in the absence of any deterioration in the patient’s general condition, these hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239155] a

the CRF: event, intensity, relationship to test substance, action taken, and outcome to date.   
The Investigator must notify the Ethics Review Committee/IRB of such an event in writing as soon as is practical and in accordance with international and local laws and regulations.  
13.2.2. Reporting  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Timeframes for Submitting Serious Adverse Events  
ANY CLINICAL AE OR ABNORMAL LABORATORY TEST VALUE THAT IS 
SERIOUS (INCLUDING DEATH OR CONGENITAL ANOMALY) OCCURRING 
DURING THE COURSE OF THE STUDY, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE TREATMENT RECEIVED BY [CONTACT_239217], MUST BE REPORTED TO THE SPONSOR OR 
DESIGNEE WITHIN ONE WORKING DAY OF THE SITE LEARNING OF THE 
EVENT (EXPEDI TED REPORTING).  
Please contact [CONTACT_239218] 24 hours of learning of the SAE.  
• Please complete an SAE Report Form and scan the form and any supporting 
documentation (which includes laboratory data, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239158] t he results of 
relevant tests).   The form and supporting documentation must be e -mailed to: 
ICON -Safety -[EMAIL_1840] within 24 hours.   
• The preferred method for receiving SAEs is via email.  In cases where submission 
through email is not possible, the site may report the SAEs through the following alternative number:  
Fax No.: +44 (0)[PHONE_4976] 
• If an ongoing SAE changes in intensity or causal relationship to the investigational product, or if new information becomes available, a follow -up SAE r eport should be 
sent to ICON within 24 hours using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  
• All SAEs should be followed- up until resolution, improvement, or stabilization.  
The definition and reporting requirements of ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions and Standards for Expedited reporting, Topic E2 will be adhered to.  
13.3. Pregnancies  
A female patient of child -bearing potential must be instructed to immediately inform the 
Investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study.  Pregnancies occurring up to [ADDRESS_290238] also be reported to the Investigator.  The Investigator 
should report all pregnancies within 24 hours to the Sponsor.  The Investigator should counsel

 the p atient; discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the 
fetus. Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Patients who 
become pregnant while on study will be discontinued from the study treatment and all End of 
Treatment visit procedures will be performed.  If the patient is a man who is capable of fathering 
a child, he must agree to use adequate birth control beginning immediately after he enrolls on this study until [ADDRESS_290239] dose of study drug.  Pregnancy occurring in the partner of 
a patient participating in the study should also be immediately reported to the Investigator and the Sponsor.  The partner should be counseled and followed as described above.  
Pregnancy is not  an SAE; however, the outcome of a pregnancy must be reported to detect a 
potential SAE (congenital anomaly, premature birth, or birth defect).  All pregnancies must be 
initially reported and follow -up information must be reported on the pregnancy follow -up form.  
The reporting timeframe to report a pregnancy to the Sponsor is from start of study drug up to 
[ADDRESS_290240] dose of study drug.  Procedures and policies at the site and at the Sponsor, 
regarding pregnancies, will be followed to ensure that the safety and well -being of the study 
patient and fetus are appropriately followed through the pregnancy to birth.  In the event that a 
pregnancy occurs in the female partner of a male patient, the Investigator will then (and only 
then) also be require d to obtain her consent so that the Sponsor can hold her data on file.  If the 
female partner is unwilling to sign the consent her data may not be held in the safety database.  However, this will not affect the ability of the male patient to continue in th e study. 
13.4. Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board  
An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be assembled and be governed by a DSMB charter, which will specify membership, frequency of meetings, and potential sample size adjustment.

 14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN  
All statistical analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_239219] a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
Patients in Phase 3 will be stratified according to his or her by [CONTACT_44847] (breast cancer, NSCLC, HRPC) and region (Asia, non- Asia).  
Data from all patients receiving the RP3D plinabulin dose in Phase 2 and Phase 3, will not be pooled for assessing the primary and secondary study endpoints, but analyzed separately.  
14.1. Study Endpoints  
14.1.1. Phase 2 Endpoints  
Plinabulin pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments will be made to enable a PK/PD analysis.  
Primary Endpoint:   
• To establish the Recommended Phase 3 Dose (RP3D) based on PK/PD ana lysis 
Primary Efficacy Pharmacodynamic Endpoint:  
• DSN in treatment Cycle 1 in patients treated with docetaxel (75 mg/m
2) + plinabulin 
(5,10 or 20 mg/ m2) or with docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg). ANC will 
be assessed at baseline (prior to Cycle 1  docetaxel dose) and during Cycle 1 on Days 
1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,  and 15 (pre -dose on dosing days; times equivalent to pre -dose on 
other days).  The Negative Binomial Regression (NBR) model, on the integer number 
of days of severe neutropenia, will be used to analyze the DSN endpoint during the 
fixed time window outlined above, with the treatment arm as the only covariate.  
The method will also be used to construct point estimates and confidence intervals. 
The GENMOD procedure in SAS version 9.4 or later wi ll be used. Contrasts for 
pairwise comparisons between Arm 1 and the plinabulin arms will be used for the 
evaluation. A closed testing procedure by [CONTACT_239171] ( Hommel 1988, Hommel and 
Bernhard 1999) will be used for the multiple comparisons. 
Primary Safety Pharmacodynamic Endpoint:  
• To assess blood pressure semi -continuously with 15- minute intervals, starting 
15 minutes pre -plinabulin dose and lasting 4.5 hours after start of infusion with 
plinabul in (Arms 2 to 4) or for 4.75 hours starting 15 minutes after the end of 
docetaxel infusion (Arm 1).  See the Pharmacometrics Analysis Plan for the analysis methods. 
Secondary Endpoints:   
• To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of plinabulin and docetaxel.  See the 
Pharmacometrics Analysis Plan for the analysis methods.  
• To characterize the exposure- response relationships between measures of plinabulin 
exposure and the pharmacodynamic endpoint DSN. Robust linear regression ( Babl ok

independent variable. The method will also be used to construct point estimates and 
confidence intervals. The NCSS version 12 statistical software will be used.  
• To characteri ze the exposure- safety relationships between measures of plinabulin 
exposure and safety events of interest. Robust linear regression ( Bablok et al, 1988) 
with the number of safety events as the dependent variable and plinabulin exposure as the independent variable. The method will also be used to construct point estimates and confidence intervals. The NCSS version 12 statistical software will be used. 
Exploratory Endpoints:  
• To assess CD34+ at screening, and on Days 2, 6, and [ADDRESS_290241] point estimates and confidence intervals. The MIXED pr ocedure in SAS 
version 9.4 or later will be used for the analysis. Contrasts for pairwise comparisons 
between Arm 1 and the plinabulin arms will be used for the evaluation. A closed 
testing procedure by [CONTACT_239171] ( Hommel 1988, Hommel and Bernhard 1999) will be 
used for the multiple comparisons. 
• Health -related QoL questionnaire evaluated with EORTC QLQ -C30 and EQ -5D-5L. 
The Wilcoxon Rank Sum test will be used to analyze the responses to the in dividual 
questions. The method will also be used to construct point estimates and confidence 
intervals. The NPAR1WAY procedure in SAS version 9.4 or later will be used for the analysis. Contrasts for pairwise comparisons between Arm 1 and the plinabulin ar ms 
will be used for the evaluation. A closed testing procedure by [CONTACT_239171] (Hommel 
1988, Hommel and Bernhard 1999) will be used for the multiple comparisons. 
• Data collection on disease progression. The log- rank test (LIFETEST procedure in 
SAS) will be used t o compare time to disease progression between the treatment 
groups. The method will also be used to construct point estimates and confidence 
intervals. Contrasts for pairwise comparisons between Arm 1 and the plinabulin arms 
will be used for the evaluation . A closed testing procedure by [CONTACT_239171] ( Hommel 
1988, Hommel and Bernhard 1999) will be used for the multiple comparisons.     
• For selected countries only: to investigate the following cytokine panel: IL -1beta, IL -
6, IL -12p70, IL -12p40, IL -17A, IL -23, G -CSF, GM -CSF, IFN -alpha, IFN -gamma, 
TNF -alpha, IL -2, FLT -3 ligand, and IL -8. 
Safety Endpoints  
• Incidence, occurrence, and severity of AEs/SAEs. These endpoints will be presented 
descriptively in tables and listings.  
• Incidences of bone pain. The NBR model will be used to analyze the endpoint during the 
fixed time window from pre -dose Day [ADDRESS_290242] point estimates and confidence 
intervals. The GENMOD procedure in SAS version 9.4 or later will be used. Contrasts for pairwise comparisons between Arm 1 and the plinabulin arms will be used for the 
evaluation. A closed testing procedure by [CONTACT_239171] ( Hommel [ADDRESS_290243]

endpoints will be presented descriptively in tables and listings.  
14.1.2. Phase 3 Endpoints  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint (Cycle 1):  
DSN in Cycle 1 in patients treated with docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + plinabulin (40 mg) (Arm  2) 
compared with patients treated with docetaxel (75 m g/m2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg) (Arm 1). ANC 
will be assessed at baseline (prior to Cycle 1 docetaxel dose) and during Cycle [ADDRESS_290244] day when a patient's ANC is below 0.5 x l09/L until the patient reaches an ANC> 0.5 x 109/L, in Cycle 1. For patients who do not experience any severe neutropenia in Cycle 1, the DSN is set to 0. For patient’s experiencing several epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], the number of days of DSN will be summed up. The NBR model, on the integer number of days of severe neutropenia, will be used to analyz e the DSN endpoint during 
the fixed time window outlined above, with the treatment arm as the only covariate. The method will also be used to construct point estimates and confidence intervals. The GENMOD procedure in SAS version 9.4 or later will be used.

state/QoL, functional scale (5 items), and symptoms scale (9 items) ( Fayers et al, 
2001 ). Three summary measures will be constructed: the QLQ -C30 Summary 
Score, which combined the symptom and functional scales (excluding the financial 
difficulties item), the symptom summary score (excluding the financial difficulties item), and the functional summary score (
Hinz et al, 2012 ). The symptom summary 
score will be analyzed using linear mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
with the Cycle [ADDRESS_290265] deviations, medians, minimums, and

Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Phase  3 Efficacy Analyses Considerations  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Primary Efficacy Analysis Considerations  
DSN was not measured in the previous Phase 2 study ([Study NPI -2358- 101] in which patients 
received treatment with either plinabulin (30 mg/m2 [n=50] or 20 mg/m2 [n=40] plinabulin + 
docetaxel or docetaxel alone [(n=73] ).  DSN was obtained using the following methods 
(described below) for generation of ANC data and the observed neutrophil values on Day 8 
in the Phase 2 study.  Day 8 neutrophil values were shown to approximately coincide with 
the nadir of ANC after docetaxel treatment ( Blackwell et al, 2015 ). The study will assume that 
the shape of the time/neutrophil recovery curve in plinabulin- treated patients is 
indistinguishable from the time/neutrophil recover y curve for filgrastim and its biosimilars.  
In a study with filgrastim and its biosimilar, time course of ANC in Cycle [ADDRESS_290272] deviati ons for the 21- day follow -up period as the publication.  
The simulation would then also generate the projected number of days with severe neutropenia (i.e., the DSN).  
Deming regression ( Deming, 1943) was used to calculate the line ar relationship between 
simulated nadir and DSN.  The rank correlation between simulated nadir and DSN was used to calculate the DSN with plinabulin (+  docetaxel) and docetaxel alone.  In the Phase 2 study, 
ANCs were obtained on Day 8, which approximately coincides with the time that the neutrophil 
nadir occurs after docetaxel administration.  These observed Day 8 neutrophil ( nadir) values 
were computed into the linear relationship (Deming regression), mentioned above to calculate 
DSN for each patient.  Usi ng these methods, calculated mean DSN was 0.065 days for the 
plinabulin+ docetaxel arm, and 1.076 days for the docetaxel alone. Based on published data with filgrastim in patients receiving docetaxel ( Alexopoulos K et al, 1999), the assumption is that 
Grade 4 neutropenia in Cycle 1 would occur in a 2 times higher frequency with G -
CSF+docetaxel versus plinabulin+docetaxel, resulting in a presumed mean DSN of 0.13 days for 
the G -CSF+ docetaxel combinat ion. 
This non- inferiority trial design will utilize a difference (arm 2 minus arm 1) of 0.65 days 
(non- inferiority margin) in DSN in Cycle [ADDRESS_290273] will evaluate the null hypothesis H
0: true 
difference (arm 2 minus arm 1) ≥  0.[ADDRESS_290274] the alternative hypothesis H 1: true difference (arm 
2 minus arm 1) <  0.65.  Plinabulin will be considered non- inferior to pegfilgrastim if in Cycle 1, 
the upper limit of the 2 -sided  95% confidence interval for the true difference in mean duration of 
Grade 4 neutropenia was < 0.[ADDRESS_290275] (http://www.neulastahcp.com/risk/duration -of-severe- neutropenia/) that FN is 
correlated with DSN.  The frequency of FN with docetaxel monotherapy (100 mg/m2) + G -CSF 
was reported to be 1% in cycle 1.  FN frequency in Cycle 1 with docetaxel combined with

Protocol Amendment 7

 doxorubicin and G -CSF was ~ 3 % ( Aarts M et al, 2013) , which would translate into a DSN of 
1 day according to Holmes FA, et al, 2002. Based on  this data, it is assumed that the median 
DSN for docetaxel monotherapy + G -CSF will be approximately 1 day.  
The frequency of FN with docetaxel monotherapy (without G -CSF) has been reported to be  11% 
in cycle 1 (17% over all cycles) docetaxel dose of 100 m g/m2 (Vogel et al, 2005) and 19.8% over 
all cycles at a lower docetaxel dose of 60 mg/m2 (Yoh K et al, 2016). Hanna et al., 2004 reported 
a FN percentage of 12.7% with 75 mg/m2 docetaxel.  Based on this range of FN, the relationship 
established by [CONTACT_239173], 2002  between FN and DSN, we make the assumption that, with 
docetaxel monotherapy at a dose of 75 mg/m2 without G -CSF, the median DSN is estimated to 
be 4-5 days.  
In the Zarxio® briefing document, 2015, the margin was s elected based on the fact that TAC 
chemotherapy is known to induce a median DSN of [ADDRESS_290276] cancer patients receiving no 
G-CSF treatment ( Nabholtz, 2001), while G -CSF treatment reduces the m ean DSN for this 
chemotherapy to 1.4 days (95% CI: 1.07 -  1.69) as shown in pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) Study 
20020778 ( Kaufman et al, 2004). Based on this a non- inferiority limit of 1 day was derived . 
As an extension of this reasoning, it is argued for our study, a non- inferiority margin of 0.65 
would be reasonable and correspond to approximately a median of 4.5 days of DSN, as  a margin 
of 1 day to 7 days of DSN in the Zarxio® briefing document, 2015. 
A non- inferiority margin of 0.65 days can also be justified, because a difference of 0.65 days is 
not considered to be clinically meaningful.  
14.2.7. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses  Considerations  
Plasma plinabulin and docetaxel concentrations will be measured using validated methods and 
PK parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  Individual and mean serum 
plinabulin and docetaxel concentration versus time profile s will be plotted on both linear and 
logarithmic scales.  
Plinabulin PK will be characterized using the population PK approach. Population PK parameter estimates, and individual PK parameters, including AUC and C
max will be summarized.  
Exposure -Neutropenia Relationship  
A sequential population PK/PD modeling approach will be used to characterize the exposure -neutropenia relationship.  The semi -physiological model described by [CONTACT_239174] (2003)   
will be used to characterize the time cou rse of neutropenia in the exposure -neutropenia model.   
The developed exposure -response models will be used to simulate ANC profiles for the 
computation of key PD endpoints such as DSN, DMSN, and area over the ANC curve (AOC). The latter will be calculated  as the area below the threshold of <0.5 x 10
9 cells/L and above 
ANC -time response curve in a chemotherapy cycle.  Details will be included in the 
Pharmacometrics Analysis Plan (PAP).  
Exposure -Blood Pressure Analysis  
A sequential PK -PD model analysis will be performed.  Since the ambulatory blood pressure 
measurements (ABPM) are subject to circadian variations, ABPM will be modeled to describe the circadian rhythm in blood pressure over the 4.5- hour observation period.  The diurnal rhythm

 in the AMBP data w ill be described with the cosine function ( Hempel 1998) in the 
exposure -ABPM models.  Details will be included in the PAP.  
Exposure -QTc Analysis  
Either a direct or sequential PK -PD model analysis will be performed.  The choice of the 
modeling approach will be informed by [CONTACT_239175]- matching of PK sampling times 
with ECG observation times. QT measurements corrected with the Fridericia formula will be 
used in the exposure -QTc analysis. Details will be included in the PAP.  
14.3. Safety Analyses Considerations  
Medical history and AE data will be coded by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT), using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary.  
Concomitant medication data will be coded by [CONTACT_239220], using the WHO Drug 
dictionary.  
All treatment emergent AEs will be graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.03, and grouped 
by [CONTACT_239221], and summarized by [CONTACT_239222].  
Treatment emergent AEs are those events that occur after first administration of any study therapy through [ADDRESS_290277] dose of any study therapy, and/or any treatment -related AEs, 
regardless of the onset date.  Dose delays, dose modifications and/or dose discontinuation of 
docetaxel due to safety concerns will be summarized for the [ADDRESS_290278] dose of study therapy. 
Treatment emergent and/or early deaths will be tabulated and summarized by [CONTACT_239223].  
14.3.2. Extent of Exposure  
Refer to the SAP for details.  
14.3.3. Adverse Events  
The AE verbatim descriptions (investigator terms from the CRF) will be classified into 
standardized medical terminology using MedDRA.  AEs will be coded to MedDRA (Version  18.1 or  higher) lower level term closest to the verbatim term.  The linked MedDRA 
preferred term (PT) and primary system organ class (SOC) are also captured in the database.  
14.3.4. Laboratory Analyses

Descriptive statistics tables will be used for the evaluations.  
14.3.6. Electrocardiogram  
Electrocardiogram assessments will be provided in a listing.  
14.4. Sample Size Considerations   
14.4.1. Phase 2  
In the Phase 2 (approximately 40 patients; approximately 10 patients per arm), patients with 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC will be enrolled.  
14.4.2. Phase 3  
Approximately 150 patients are planned to be enrolled with 1 of the following diagnoses: advanced or metastatic breast cancer, NSCLC, or HRPC.  A sample size of 75 patients in each of 
the treatment arms docetaxel + plinabulin (40 mg) versus docetaxel + pegfilgrastim, with 
matching placebos achieve at least a 90% power to reject the null hypothesis of 0.[ADDRESS_290279] deviations of 0.75, at a 
significance level (alpha) of 0.05 two- sided two- sample zero -inflated Poisson model.   
The software PASS version 15.0.1 has been used for the calculations referencing Chow et al. 2003, Lan and DeMets 1983, O'Brien and Fleming 1979. 
14.5. Interim Analysis  
The study design is group sequential with 1 interim analysis (after [ADDRESS_290280] 1 cycle in each of the treatment arms docetaxel + plinabulin [40 mg] 
versus docetaxel + pegfilgrastim, with matching placebos) and 1 final analysis at the completion of the study ( Table 15). These results assume that 2 sequential tests are made using the O'Brien -
Fleming spending function to determine the test boundaries.  
If non -inferiority is determined from the statistical testing, then also th e hypothesis of superiority 
will be tested, and if it is concluded that the plinabulin treatment is superior to the pegfilgrastim 
treatment, with respect to DSN, then the study will be stopped. Since the design allows for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_239125], it might  be decided at that occasion that the study will be stopped. Since 
this is a hierarchical testing procedure no penalty with respect to overall significance will be paid. 
The statistical testing will be performed and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_239224].

15.11.1. Access to Information for Monitoring  
It is understood that the responsible Sponsor’s Monitor (or designee) will contact [CONTACT_239228], on request, to inspect the various records of the study (CRFs  and other pertinent source data) provided that patient confidentiality is maintained in 
accord with local requirements.  
It will be the Monitor’s responsibility to inspect the CRFs at regular intervals throughout the study, to verify the adherence to the P rotocol and the completeness, consistency and accuracy of 
the data being entered on the CRFs.  The Monitor should have access to laboratory test reports 
and other patient records needed to verify the entries on the CRF.  The Investigator (or his/her deputy) agrees to cooperate with the Monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  Refer to Monitoring Plan for further details.  
15.11.2. Access to Information for Auditing or Inspections  
The Investigator should unde rstand that source documents for this study should be made 
available to appropriately qualified personnel from the Sponsor, or its designees, or to health 
authority inspectors after appropriate notification.  The verification of the CRF data must be by

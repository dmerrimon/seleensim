the study. None of the ocular treatments, whether OTC or prescription (e.g. Restasis or Xiidra) or study 
medication , should be used within [ADDRESS_916972] of superiority of topi[INVESTIGATOR_677726]300 vs OBS drops with a set of ordered 
endpoints to be tested in a fixed sequence.  
 
Tests will be conducted using two -sided  alpha = .[ADDRESS_916973] a single eye identified as the study eye as follows: (i) if only 1 eye meets inclusion criteria, this 
eye will be the study eye and the other eye will be considered the non- qualified fellow eye; (ii) if both 
eyes meet inclusion criteria, the eye with the higher Lissamine Green conjunctival staining  score will be 
the study eye an d the other eye will be considered the qualified fellow eye; (iii) if both eyes have the same 
Lissamine Green conjunctival staining  score, then the eye with the lower Schirmer score will be the study 
eye and the other eye will be considered the qualified f ellow eye; (iv) if both eyes have same Schirmer  
score, the right eye will be the study eye and the other eye will be considered the qualified fellow eye. 
Analysis of safety and e fficacy variables measured at the eye level  will be primarily performed on th e 
study eyes and secondarily on the qualified fellow eyes (for efficacy) and all fellow eyes (for safety).   
 
The unit of analyses for variables measured at the subject level will be the subject.  
 
Power and Sample Size  
One-hundred eight subjects in each of  the OCU 310 and placebo arms yields 99% power to reject the null 
hypothesis  and conclude superiority of OCU [ADDRESS_916974] deviation of 25.0, and a two- sided alpha = 0.05.  
Additionally, 108 study eyes in each of the OCU 310 and placebo arms yields 90% power to reject the 
null hypothesis  and conclude superiority of OCU [ADDRESS_916975] deviation of 1.35, and 
a two-sided alpha  = 0.05.  For the secondary endpoints (Day 14), t here are not enough data to make a 
power /sample size statement .   
 
For the primary analysis, w ith [ADDRESS_916976] approximately 90% power to 
reject both H01 and H02, assuming indepe ndence between endpoints (with higher power should the 
endpoints be positively correlated),  and conclude the  OCU 310 to be superior  to placebo  in both the mean 
change from baseline SANDE score at 4 weeks and the mean change from baseline Lissamine Green 
conjunctival staining score in the study eye at 4 weeks. 
 
Accounting for 10% subject discontinuations, 240 total subjects will be enrolled  (120 per arm) . 
 
 
Ocugen, Inc.   Protocol vers ion 1.[ADDRESS_916977] one dose of 
study  drug. The safety set will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received.  
Intent -to-treat (ITT ) Population  
The ITT set will be the primary analysis set for the efficacy endpoints and will include all randomized 
subjects who have at least one post -baseline efficacy measurement. The ITT population will be analyzed 
according to the planned treatment.  
Per-protocol (PP) Population 
The PP population set will be tested to confirm the robustness of the primary analysis and will include 
all ITT subjects who have no major protocol deviations.  The PP population will be analyzed according 
to the treatment actua lly received.  
 
Hypothes es  
The following type of hypothesis will be tested:  
H0: The difference  (OCU 310 minus placebo) , between subjects  treated with the OCU 310 
and subjects treated with placebo  in the mean change from baseline = 0.  
HA: The difference  (OCU 310 minus placebo) , between subjects  treated with the OCU 310 
and subjects treated with placebo  in the mean change from baseline ≠ 0, with superiority 
claimed if the difference <  0. 
Fixed sequence testing will be employed to maintain the type I error rate.  
 
General Considerations  
Continuous study assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_10659] (as applicable) and change from 
baseline to each post -baseline visit using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, and maximum). Categorical study assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_10659] (as 
applicable) using frequency counts and percentages.  
 
Efficacy  Analysis  
Four  endpoints (two primary and two secondary) will be tested in a fixed sequence proceeding to the next 
endpoint until a p- value >0.[ADDRESS_916978] squares 
mean difference (OCU 310 – placebo) at the stated time point will be tested. T he 2-sided p- values and 
associated 95% confidence intervals will be presented.

(0.2% ) as an ophthalmic nanoemulsion eye drops for the relief of signs and symptoms of Dry Eye Disease 
(DED). Brimonidine is an imi dazo line compound that acts as a specific alpha [ADDRESS_916991] and is available 
at different concentrations and is indicated for the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with 
open- angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension  
 
 Dry Eye Disease  
Dry eye disease (DED ) is a common ocular disorder involving the aberrant production and in stability of 
tear film, which results in damage to the ocular surface and is correlated with symptoms of ocular 
discomfort. DED is also recognized as keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), si cca syndrome, keratitis sicca, 
xerophthalmia, dry eye syndrome (DES), dysfunctional tear syndrome (DTS), ocular surface disease 
(OSD) or dry eye. DED is caused by [CONTACT_677766]. Tear film instability can be 
triggered by [CONTACT_677767], or by [CONTACT_677768] (Phadatare et al 2015). Furthermore, dry eye is typi[INVESTIGATOR_677727]:  
1) Aqueous tear deficient dry eye disease  
2) Evaporative dry eye disease 
DED is a result of changes to the lacrimal functional unit (LFU). The LFU is composed of the lacrimal 
glands, cornea, eyelids, meibomian glands, conjunctiva, goblet cells, and ocular nerves. The LFU is 
responsible for the sustained production of adequate tear fil m to consistently lubricate the ocular surface. 
Structural changes to the LFU can induce tear film instability and insufficiency, which in turn can lead to 
tear hyperosmolarity. Chronic osmotic stress from tear film can activate stress associated pathways in 
ocular surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], thereby [CONTACT_178521] a pro -inflammatory response that involves a mix of 
chemokines, cytokines, and matrix metalloproteinases. The subsequent maturation of antigen- presenting 
cells (APC’s) on the ocular surface leads to the migration, activation, and expansion of autoreactive T cell 
lymphocytes as well as other leukocytic classes in the LFU. The constant recruitment of pro -
inflammatory leukocytes onto the ocular surface inflicts epi[INVESTIGATOR_677728] (Pflugfelder et al 2008; Stevenson et al 2012). These abrasions can 
eventually progress to superficial punctuate keratitis, squamous metaplasia, extracellular matrix deposits, 
decreased goblet cell differentiation, increas ed epi[INVESTIGATOR_677729] (epi[INVESTIGATOR_15424]), and significant 
ocular surface nerve damage and neuropathy.  
As DED progresses, lacrimal gland obstruction, meibomian gland orifice obstruction, thickened eyelid 
margins, cloudy, solid, or granular meibum secre tion, eyelid telangiectasia, and meibomian gland 
dysfunction become common clinical features. In advanced cases, dry eye can cause fibrotic thickening of 
the cornea and conjunctiva, filamentous keratitis, mucoid clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], trichiasis, symblepharon, 
keratini zation of the eyelids and meibomian glands, corneal and conjunctival erosion and thinning, 
corneal and conjunctival neovascularization, corneal and conjunctival scarring, corneal ulceration, and 
corneal perforation. In addition, prolonged ocular surface in flammation can lead to moderate or absolute 
loss/atrophy of the meibomian glands, lacrimal glands, and conjunctival goblet cells, and subsequently a 
dramatic reduction in tear film production and the onset of permanent DED (Messmer et al 2015).

older adults. DED also occurs in a higher percentage of women than m en, especially in women entering 
menopause or pregnancy; hormone imbalances during menopause or pregnancy can cause lacrimal gland 
and ocular surface inflammation and tear film abnormalities (Phadatare et al 2015).  
 Dry Eye Disease: Clinical Signs and Symp toms  
Common signs and symptoms of DED include: eye redness, ocular pain, burning and stinging sensation, 
foreign body sensation, pruritus, itchy or scratchy eye sensation, tired eyes, enhanced eye pressure, 
photophobia, painful mucous discharge, and in som e cases epi[INVESTIGATOR_119230]. DED typi[INVESTIGATOR_677730]. Dry eye can heavily impact visual function especially during visually intensive activities and 
can overall decrease quality of life. (Phadatare et al 2015; Messmer et al 2015)  
 Dry Eye Disease: Diagn ostic Testing  
Clinicians use several diagnostic tests to diagnose DED and to assess disease severity. These tests fall into 
two groups: signs (objective) and symptoms (subjective).  For DED signs, there are several quantitative 
tests, including: Schirmer T est, Schirmer I Test, Schirmer II test, tear film breakup time (TBUT), non -
invasive tear film breakup time (NITBUT) epi[INVESTIGATOR_677731] (rose bengal, lissamine green, 
fluorescein) via slit -lamp examination, tear function index (TFI), tear fluid prot ein immunoassays, 
fluorophotometry, meibography, meibometry, meiboscopy, meniscometry, lacrimal gland biopsy, 
impression cytology, hypolysozyme measurement, hyperosmolarity measurement, and lipid layer 
analysis, ocular redness scoring, automated blink anal ysis, and meniscus evaluation utilizing Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_677732], 
Keratograph 5M, or OCT equipment (Phadatare et al 2015).  
Symptom measurements utilizing physician and/or patient disease scoring include: extensive dry eye 
questionnaire (DEQ), visual analog scale (VAS) , ocular surface disease index (OSDI), national eye 
institute visual function questionnaire (NEI -VFQ -25), symptom assessment in dry eye questionnaire 
(SANDE), and standardized patient evaluation of eye dryness questionnaire (SPEED). While most 
physicians u se OSDI as the primary diagnostic questionnaire for dry eye, the SANDE visual analog scale-
based questionnaire offers significant advantages, such as simplicity and brevity, while maintaining a 
high degree of diagnostic accuracy.  In addition, in two recent review articles, the SANDE questionnaire 
showed a significant correlation to OSDI in terms of DED scoring (Amparo, et al, 2015; Saboo, et al, 
2015).)  
 Dry Eye Disease: Current Management  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], clinicians prescribe artificial tear eyedrops and topi[INVESTIGATOR_677733] -term relief of 
DED. Antibiotics (tetracyclines and macrolides), non -steroidal anti- inflammatory agents, autologous 
serum drops, omega fatty acids, mucin secretagogues, and anti -inflammatory agents are also used to 
combat DED symptoms. In addition, prosthetic scleral lenses (i.e. PROSE) that also serve as 
supplemental tear reservoirs are increasingly being prescribed to enhance ocular surface hydration in 
patients with chronic DED. Hot eyelid compresses are often utilized to treat meibomian gland 
dysfunction, a primary driver of evaporative dry eye disease. In advanced cases of DED, punctual plugs 
can be installed to block tear drainage. In severe cases of dry eye, tarsorrhaphy surgery, tear duct 
cauterization, or amniotic membrane transplant might be required to reduce tear evaporation (Phadatare et 
al 2015; Lin et al 2014).  
Currently there are only two pharmaceutical agents that are FDA approved for the treatment of dry eye: 
cylcosporine A ophthalmic emulsion (Restasis®) and lifit egrast ophthalmic solution (Xiidra™). 
Restasis® 0.05% is a topi[INVESTIGATOR_677734], Inc.   Protocol vers ion 1.0 
OCU- 310-301  12 Aug 2018  
22 
 keratoconjunctivitis sicca (R estasis® Prescribing Information). Xiidra™ 5% is a lymphocyte function-
associated antigen (LFA -1) antagonist indicated for the treatment of signs and symptoms of dry eye 
disease (Xiidra™ Prescribing Information). Given the complexity, severity, and frequency of DED, and 
given the limited modes of action by [CONTACT_677769], there is a medical need 
for other dry eye therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], particularly those with multiple modes of action that target the wider dry eye 
population and are effective a nd safe for early relief and long-term daily use.  
 Scientific Rationale for Brimonidine Therapy in Dry Eye Disease  
As mentioned, brimonidine tartrate is a selective alpha -[ADDRESS_916993] and is currently 
available as an ophthalmic solution at  different concentrations and is indicated for the reduction of 
intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open- angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension  
 
 Preclinical Data Supporting Use of Brimonidine in DED  
The scientific rationale to establish a medically plausible basis for the use of local brimonidine tartrate for 
the treatment of DED include the potential following mechanisms:  
1. Reduction of ocular surface blood flow: As an alpha agonist, brimonidine tartrate can 
significantly cause vasoconstriction leadi ng to the reduction of blood flow to the ocular 
surface, which, in turn, reduces local pressure, edema and inflammation (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_99206], 2014). In 
this manner, brimonidine has the potential to reduce redness and inflammation of the ocular 
surface.  
2. Disruption of leukocyte extravasation to the ocular tissue: brimonidine can inhibit the 
infiltration of activated leukocytes by [CONTACT_677770] (Herrera -Garcia, 
2014).  
3. Suppression of leukocytes activation: Although inhibition of T lymphocytes has not been 
directly studied with brimonidine tartrate, activation of alpha 2 receptors (with another alpha 
[ADDRESS_916994]) has been shown to suppress the reactivation of T lymphocytes (Felsner, 1995). In 
addition, induction of neutrophil apoptosis with brimonidine has been reported in acute 
inflammation (Herrera- Garcia, 2014).  
4. Analgesic properties: Brimonidine antagonizes or suppresses the excitatory response of 
phenylephrine and noradrenaline  by [CONTACT_677771]  (Bradshaw, 1984). As an 
alpha agonist, br imonidine may attenuate pro -inflammatory cytokine release from leukocytes, 
which in turn, attenuates neuritis -induced pain (Romero- Sandoval, 2007; Romero- Sandoval, 
2005).  
5. Reduction of corneal surface inflammation : In the mouse dry eye model, ocular staining data 
comparing brimonidine to other treatments showed a reduction in fluorescein staining scores 
over a [ADDRESS_916995] safety profile via topi[INVESTIGATOR_677735]- angle glaucoma.  Brimonidine tartrate 0.2% , which includes the 
preservative benzalkoniu m chloride (BAK),  is generally safe and well tolerated . Given that  preservative-
free OCU310 nanoemulsion was not yet available for clinical trials in late 2017, an IND -opening phase 2 
proof -of-concept study  was conducted, using commercially available brimo nidine.    
The main objective of the study was to establish whether subjects with DED can tolerate receiving 
Brimonidine 0.2% eye drops, alone or in combination with loteprednol 0.2%, two times a day for twelve 
weeks (84 days) . The other objective was to i nvestigate the preliminary efficacy of Brimonidine 0.2% 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_465007], alone or in combination with loteprednol 0.2%, in treating DED, and to use this 
information, if possible, to select the appropriate brimonidine treatment regimen (with or wi thout 
loteprednol) and the appropriate efficacy endpoints for phase 3 studies. This was a randomized, placebo-
controlled, double -blind study, in which 84 subjects were enrolled at three clinical sites.  The primary 
endpoint was tolerability at Day 84, using  a visual analog scale (VAS). There were several pre- specified 
exploratory efficacy endpoints.    
In summary, the phase 2 study showed that both b rimonidine combination therapy  (with loteprednol)  and 
brimonidine m onotherapy  (without loteprednol)  are safe and well tolerated, and both were  consistently 
better than placebo for key exploratory efficacy endpoints, particularly at early post -baseline visits. The 
most promising symptom endpoint was SANDE, for which both brimonidine regimens (combination and 
monotherapy ), were statistically superior to placebo at the Day [ADDRESS_916996] promising sign endpoint was 
Lissamine Green Staining of either the conjunctivae or  the cornea , for which both brimonidine regimens 
(combination and monotherapy) were better than placebo at the Day [ADDRESS_916997] : brimonidine tartrate 0.2% without loteprednol in a 
nanoemulsi on formulation, also known as OCU310.  
 
 Product Rationale  
Brimonidine tartrate  ophthalmic solution, 0.2% is an FDA approved product that has demonstrated a 
robust safety profile via topi[INVESTIGATOR_677736]- angle glaucoma or ocular 
hypertension,  with low occurrence of adverse events (AE s). This product was also shown to be safe and 
tolerable, while demonstrating preliminary efficacy, in a phase 2 proof -of-concept study conducted in 
2017.  
OCU 3 10 is a sterile, preservative -free solution of brimonidine tartrate 0.2% in an ophthalmic  
nanoemulsion. It was developed to provide relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease for topi[INVESTIGATOR_677737].  The proposed dose is one drop of OCU3 10 (0.2% brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic 
nanoemulsion)  twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart) into each eye using a single -use container.

  Summary of Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human 
Subjects  
In this study, one drop of OCU 310 ( brimonidine tartrate n anoemulsion 0. 2%) will be administered in to 
each eye, two times a day (bid)  for 28 days. The b rimonidine tartrate concentration (0.2 %) is similar to 
the concentration of the currently marketed brimonidine tartrate (0.2%) used for chronic dosing in 
glaucoma patients.  
Several studies have reported the overall safety and efficacy of marketed brimonidine 0.2%  and 0.15%  
after 1, 3 , and 4 years. ( Katz 2002, Mundorf 2003, Adkins 1998, Chew 2014, Melamed 2000, LeBlanc 
1998, Schuman 1996, Schuman 1997, Nguyen 2013, Rahman 2010)  Based on the current evidence, 
related serious adverse events are not expected with the dose in the current study (0.2%) . One study 
demonstrated a reduction in adverse effects with brimonidine 0.15% , relative to 0.2%  (Katz 2002 ), but 
another has shown no difference bet ween brimonidine 0.2%  and 0.15% ( Mundorf 2003). The most 
common systemic side effects include dysgeusia, fatigue, eye pain, dry mouth, and headache (Adkins 
1998, Chew 2014, Melamed 2000, LeBlanc 1998, Schuman 1997). The incidence of blepharitis and 
blephar oconjunctivitis has been reported in 9.0 – 12.7% of patients (Schuman 1997, Katz 1999, Schuman 
1996), follicular conjunctivitis in 7.8 – 12.7% of patients (Schuman 1997, Katz 1999), and conjunctival 
hyperemia in 5.0 -  30.3% of patients (Nguyen 2013, Rahman 2010) . 
Given the long -term safety profile of marketed brimonidine tartrate (0.15% -0.20%) , the positive 
tolerability and efficacy signals in a phase 2 study  of dry eye disease, the added benefits of a preservative -
free nanoemulsion, and the high medical ne ed in this patient population, the risk/benefit profile supports 
the use of OCU 3 10 for the relief of signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.

 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 Overall Study Design  
This will be a ra ndomi zed, placebo -controlled, double -masked, m ulticenter phase 3  study in the United 
States conducted in approximately 15 centers . Upon meeting the eligibility criteria, enrolled subjects with 
a history of DED  will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to recei ve either Brimonidine Nanoemulsion 
Eye Drops 0.2 % investigational product or ophthalmic buffer ed saline ( placebo ).  
Four  study visits are planned : Day - 7± 1day (screening visit) , Day  1 (randomization) , Day 14 ±  3 days, 
and Day 28 ± 7 days (See Table 4) . An informed consent form  (ICF) must be obtained from each subject 
prior to the commencement of any study procedures. All subjects must be given ample time to review the 
ICF and ask questions regarding the study prior to participation in the study. The subje ct will be provided 
a copy of the signed IC F. 
Subjects will receive the first dose of medication on Day 1 at the study site. Study medication will be 
dispensed to subjects at each study visit (except the Day 28 visit) for self- administration during  the stu dy, 
beginning with the  Day1 V isit. 
Subjects will be provided with diaries to record twice daily dosing . Doses should be administered 
approximately 12 hours apart . In addition, subje cts will be asked to make note of any missed doses 
Ocugen, Inc.   Protocol vers ion 1.0 
OCU- 310-301  12 Aug 2018

 together with the reason  for the missed dosage . The intent is to capture missed doses, per se, rather than a 
shifted dosing schedule .  
 Rationale for the Study Design  
Given the long -term safety profile of marketed brimonidine tartrate (0.15% -0.20%), the positive 
tolerability and e fficacy signals in a phase 2 study of dry eye disease, the added benefits of a preservative-
free nanoemulsion, and the high medical need in this patient population, the risk/benefit profile supports 
the use of OCU 310 for the relief of signs and symptoms of dry eye disease (Section 1.7).  The medical 
need, in part, may be due to the limited mechanisms of action of existing dry eye products (Section 1.5.1).  
To support the proposed indication, efficacy in both a sign and a symptom of DED are expected to be 
demonstrated  in phase [ADDRESS_916998] signals observed for “sign” (Lissamine Green staining of the conjunctivae) and for 
“symptom” (SANDE score) were selected as primary endpoints in phase 3. Moreover, in phase 2, efficacy 
signals were observed as early as the first post -baseline study visit  (Day 28 ), which supports the selection 
of Day [ADDRESS_916999] 240 participants  will be randomly assigned to the study treatment such that approximately 120 
evaluable subjects per active arm (OCU3 10) and 120 per placebo  arm (OBS) complete the study  (1:1 
randomization) .

on the appropriate case report form (CRF ) page . Ocular and m edical history of each subject will be colle cted 
at the Screening and Baseline (Day 1) Visits and recorded on the appropriate CRF.  
 Prior  & Concomitant Medications/Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_677741] /therapi[INVESTIGATOR_677742] n by [CONTACT_677775] [ADDRESS_917007] be recorded on the appropriate CRF s.  
 Pregnancy Screen  
At the Screening  and Baseline (Day 1) Visit s, a urine dipstick pregnancy test will be performed for all female 
subjects of child -bearing potential. 
 Efficacy Assessments 
 
 Primary Efficacy  Assessment  
 
There are two primary efficacy endpoints in this study: 
1. Change from baseline to 4 weeks (D ay 28) in SANDE score  
2. Change from baseline to 4 weeks (Day 28) in Lissamine Green conjunctival staining  scores  
 
Note: This endpoint would be considered in a hierarchical fashion if statistical success is first demonstrated 
for SANDE at Day 28  (Section 11)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Symptom Assessment iN Dry Eye (SANDE ) at Day 28 
The SANDE questionnaire is a short visual analog assessment scale that quantifies both severity and 
frequency of current dry eye symptoms. The SANDE is comprised of two questions, and each question 
employs a 100- mm horizontal linear VAS ( Figure 2 ). The measurement of symptom frequency ranges from 
“rarely” to “all of the time,” and the symptom severity from “very mild” to “very severe.” Subjects will 
complete this scale at Screening , Day [ADDRESS_917008] dose, Day 14, and Day 28. Data collected from the 
SANDE questionnaire will be calculated by [CONTACT_677776] . The result is the Overall SANDE score ( see Section 18.4).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Conjunctival Staining Score with Lissamine Green at Day 28 
Conjunctival staining with Lissamine Green dye (1%; LG) staining  in each eye (OS and OD) will be 
conducted using the slit  lamp  at Screening, Day [ADDRESS_917009] dose, Day 14, and Day 28. A sin gle drop of 
1% Lissamine Green dye will  applied to the inferior conjunctival fornix of both eyes. The conjunctivae will

 be examined with the slit lamp at ×10 magnification, using a neutral- density filte r. Conjunctival staining will 
be graded in two zones, as per the methods described in Section 18.3 ( Table 6 )(Figure 3 )(Figure 4 ). 
 
 Secondary Efficacy Assessment  
  
There are two secondary efficacy endpoints in this study: 
3. Change from baseline to 2 weeks (Day 14) in SANDE score  
4. Change from baseline to 2 weeks (Day 14) in Lissamine Green conjunctival staining  scores  
 
Note: The above endpoints (Primary and Secondary) will be tested in a fixed sequence (1-4) proceeding to 
the next endpo int until a p -value >0.05 is found (Section 11).

[IP_ADDRESS] Schirmers T est (with anesthesia) at Day 28 
A Schirmer’s test will be conducted at Screening, Day 1 (prior to first dose), and Day 28 to access tear 
production. After instilling one drop of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413] (e.g., proparacaine) to each eye, wait 
approximately [ADDRESS_917010] should be instructed to keep her/his eyelids closed during the test. Strips should 
remain in place in both eyes for 5 min, or until completely saturated with tears. After 5 min, wetting of the 
strips will be  measured using the millimeter scale on each strip.  
The study site will capture the actual measurement in millimeters (mm) and the Sponsor will convert to 
categories based on the number of mm of wetting of the paper after 5 minutes (Ogawa, 2013), as follows:     
1. Normal is > 15 mm  
2. Mild dry eye is 11 -15 mm  
3. Moderate dry eye is 6 -10 mm  
4. Sever e dry eye is ≤5 mm  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Validated Bulbar Redness grading scale (VBR)  at Day 28 
Ocular surface redness (OR; nasal or temporal) will be assessed using the VBR grading scale (Schulze 2007)  
at Day [ADDRESS_917011] dose , Day 14, and Day 28. The VBR consists of a set of ten images illustrating 
different degrees of OR, ranging from normal to severe, and each image is assigned a value in an order of 
ascending severity (see Section  18.1; Figure 1 ). The VBR will be completed at each clinic visit. The bulbar 
conjunctival injection of the subject’s eye (nasal and temporal) will be examined via slit -lamp examination 
and compared to the reference images in the VBR and graded accordingly. To maintain uniformity, the same physician (PI) will perform the VBR assessments for each subject, and under constant illumination 
conditions.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Global Impression (CGI) at Day 28 
At Day 14 and Day 28, the P I will use their  clinical evaluation (all signs and symptoms taken together) to 
provide a global assessment of the subjects’ change in symptoms and signs. The CGI is assessed as follows 
(Miller 2010):  
Ocugen, Inc.   Protocol version 1.0 
OCU-310-301  12 Aug 2018 
36 
 Question (to physician): In general, compared with the subjects’ symptoms and signs at baseline, how 
would you characterize his/her overall signs and symptoms now?  
The responses will be categorized on a 7-point scale as follows: 
- Marked worsening 
- Moderate worsening  
- Minimal worsening  
- Unchanged 
- Minimal improvement 
- Moderate improvement 
- Marked improvement  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Subject Global Assessment (SGA) at Day 28 
At Day 14 and Day 28, t he subjects will be asked to assess their overall change from baseline.  The SGA is 
assessed as follows (Miller 2010): 
Question  1 (to subject ): Compared with your first visit, how are your eye symptoms now?  
The responses will be categorized on a 5-point scale as follows:  
- Much worse  
- Worse 
- About the same 
- Improved 
- Much improved  
 Safety Assessments  
All subjects who enter the study will be assessed for safety. Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_677777].  Safety assessments include vital signs, recording of adverse 
events, as well as oph thalmic exam findings. All ocular and non- ocular adverse events will be assessed for 
severity and relationship to the investigational product. The following analyses will be performed: 
o The proportion of subjects at Day [ADDRESS_917012]. Details regarding AE definitions, collection, recording, and reporting are found in Section 
10.1.

 Visual Acuity ( logMAR) 
Monocular and binocular v isual acuity  will be completed  with the subject’s best correction vision in place 
using a logMAR  ETDRS chart, at Day [ADDRESS_917013] dose , Day 14, and Day 28. Procedures for BCV A 
are outlined in Sectio n 18.4 ( Figure 5)( Table 7 ).  
 IOP - Goldmann A pplanation  
IOP will be assessed in both eyes, at  each clinic visit, using the Goldmann applanation tonometry method 
(see Section 18.5) .  
 Ophthalmic Examination ( Slit Lamp)  
Biomicroscopic  examination will be completed at each clinic visit (see Section 18.6)( Table 8 ). The 
conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, lens and anterior vitreous of each  eye will be examined .  
 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be assessed at the Day 1, Day 14, and Day 28 visits.  Diastolic and systolic b lood pressure  
(DBP/SBP)  and heart  rate (HR) will be assessed via oscillometer method using an automated 
sphygmomanometer. At each visit, 3 consecutive readings (at least 2 minutes apart)  will be taken by [CONTACT_677778]’s source documents. The average DBP and SBP will be documented 
in the CRFs . Subjects should be comfortably seated for [ADDRESS_917014] 1 minute  and recorded as beats per minute (bpm), and body 
temperature (forehead) will be recorded in degrees Celsius (˚C).   
 
Clinically significa nt negative changes from baseline will be recorded as adverse events.  
 INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG  INFORMATION AND MANAGEMENT 
 Investigational Drug Dose Regimen  
The proposed dose is one drop of OCU3 10 in each eye (OU) approximately every 12 hours. The proposed 
dosing regimen is twice daily (bid).  
 Dose Rationale   
OCU310 has a dosage  strength of 0.2% brimonidine tartrate applied as a single drop to each eye, twice daily. 
This dose was  selected based on results of the Phase 2 proof -of-concept study and the data availab le from 
marketed brimonidine ophthalmic products, accounting for  the improved pharmaceutical attributes of an oil -
in-water proprietary nano emulsion of brimonidine tartrate (sterile filtered)  formulation compared to the 
solution formulation. The nano emulsio n formulation, with a pH  buffered to maintain the optimum range for 
ocular delivery , is expected to decrease drainage rate and pr olong precorneal residence time, without 
increasing the drug peak concentration. Based on these pharmaceutical attributes, as well as preliminary 
clinical data, it is suggested that a 0.2% concentration of brimonidine in the OCU310 ophthalmic 
nanoemulsion formulation with twice daily application will be able to exert therapeutic effects .  
Moreover, t he potential protective effect of OCU310 brimonidine tartrate against corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_677743]300 , which Ocugen is developi[INVESTIGATOR_677744], Inc.   Protocol vers ion 1.[ADDRESS_917015] disease oGVHD) . OCU 300, in comparison to a placebo nanoemulsion, commerc ially available 
brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution (0.2 %), and marketed product s (Restasis ® - Cyclosporine; 
Xiidra® - Lifitegrast) demonstrated a protective effect in a mouse dry -eye disease model .  These results infer  
that OCU3 [ADDRESS_917016] 
brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2 %, and placebo  nanoemulsion.  
In addition, brimonidine tartrate solution is considered safe based on the long history of over 20 years for  
ophthalmic chronic use ( Allergan 2010; Serle 1996) . Brimonidine tartrate 0.2% is currently used topic ally as 
eye drops, 3 times a day, for the lowering of intra -ocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open- angle 
glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The brimonidine tartrate concentration (0.2%) and frequency of 
administration  > bid  may provide a greater exposur e, and hence, a greater probability of adverse events, than 
the proposed OCU310 dosing regimen.  
 Investigational Drug Packaging and Labeling  
All investigational drugs used in this study will be prepared, packaged, and labeled in accordance with the 
standar d operating procedures (SOPs) of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)  guidelines, International

 RANDOMIZATION AND MASKING PROCEDURES  
 Method of Assig ning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
In this parallel-group randomized stud y, subjects who meet study entry criteria will be random ly assigned in 
a 1:1 ratio to OCU3 10 or placebo. The  random ization s chedule will be computer generated using a  permuted 
block algorithm and w ill random ly allocate IP to random ization num bers. The randomization num bers will 
be assigned sequentially through a central Interactive Web Response System  (IWRS) as subj ects are entered 
into the study, with a goal of maintaining balance across the overall study and not necessarily within a study 
site. 
 
The random ization s chedule will be prepared by [CONTACT_677785]. No one  involved in the  
conduc t of the study will have access to t he random ization s chedule before official unmasking  of treatment  
assignment. N o sub ject will be randomized into thi s study more than once. 
 
 Masking and Unmasking of Treatment Assign ment 
All sub jects, investigators, and stu dy personn el involved in the condu ct of the study, including da ta 
management and statistics, will be masked  to treatment assignment except for  a specified partially 
unmasked  staff member personnel from the designated pack aging vendor who will do the package 
labeling . This person will know the scramble kit numbers and associated drug groups . The partially 
Ocugen, Inc.   Protocol vers ion 1.[ADDRESS_917021]’s treatment assignment. U nmasking 
shoul d be discussed in advance with the medical monitor , if possibl e.  
 
 Emergency Unmasking  
For emergency unmask ing, study personne l will use the IWRS . Access to t he IWRS unmasking module  
requires a special password that may be obtained from the  medical monitor  or other designated team 
member. If the investigator is not  able to discuss treatment unmasking in a dvance, then he/she must noti fy 
the medical m onitor as soon  as poss ible about the unmasking inc ident without r evealing t he subject’s 
treatment assignment. The  investigator or designee must record the date and reason f or study discontin uation 
on the appropriate CRF for tha t subject. In all cases that are not emergencies, the investigator must discuss 
the event with the m edical monitor prior to unmask ing the  subj ect’s treatment assignment. 
If treatment assignment is unmasked f or an individual sub ject, study personnel will be notified of tha t 
subject’s treatment assignment without  unmasking the  treatment assignments for the remaining subj ects in 
the study. Thus, the overall study mask  will not b e compromised. If a subj ect’s treatment assignment is 
unmasked , he/she may or may not be asked to withdraw from the  study. The investigator will make this 
decision after consultation with the medical monitor.

 ADVERSE EVENTS  
 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
This section defines the types of AEs  and outlines the procedures for appropriately collecting, grading, 
recording, and reporting them. Information in this section complies with 21 Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR)  312, ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for 
Expedited Reporting, and IC H Guideline E -6: Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.  
Adverse events will be recorded  from the time of informed consent completion, throughout the study , and 
at early termination ; AEs  will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA).  
The Investigator  is responsible for the detection and documentation of AEs, regardless of treatment group 
or suspected causal relationship to the investigational product . For all AE s, the Investigator  must pursue 
and obtain information adequate t o determine the outcome of the AE  and to assess whether the AE  meets 
the criteria for classification as an  SAE , requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its designated 
representative.  
 Definitions of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event  (AE)  
An AE is defi ned as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with the subject’s 
participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s parti cipation in the 
research (ICH E 6 Guidelines for GCP). Any medical condition that is p resent at the time that the subject 
is screened will be considered as medical history and not recorded as an AE; h owever, if the condition 
worsens at any time during the study , it will be recorded and reported as an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An AE is  considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator  or the S ponsor, it results in any of 
the following outcomes (21  CFR 312.32(a)):  
• Death: A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the Investigator  
during the proto col-defined follow -up period must be reported to the S ponsor whether it is 
considered treatment related or not.  
• A life -threatening event: An AE or suspected  adverse reaction ( SAR ) is considered “life -
threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator  or the S ponsor, its occurrence places the 
participant at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions.  
Ocugen   Protocol version  1.0 
OCU-300-301  12 July2018 
43 
 • An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based on appropriate medical judgment, it 
may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of investigational product dependency or abuse. 
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
If an event meets any of the above definitions, regardless of the severity or relationship of the event to the 
study product , the event must be reported to the S ponsor , as described in Section 10.1.5.  
Adverse events reported from clinical studies associated with hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_677749]. Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_677750] 24 hours meets these criteria. This category  also includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive 
care unit (e.g. , from a standard of care unit to an acute/intensive care unit).  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]: 
• Rehabilitation facilities, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78428] (e.g. caregiver relief)  
• Nursing homes or skilled nursing facili ties 
• Emergency room visits  
• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures)  
• <24-hour admissions for observation or evaluation  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical AE  is not in 
itself an SAE . Examples include: 
• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen 
• Protocol-specified admission (e.g. for a procedure required by [CONTACT_4690]) 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78429], social, and/or convenience  admissions 
• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline documentation 
for the individual subject.  
• Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as AEs; 
however, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it occurs during the reporting period and meets the definition of an AE . For example, an acute 
appendicitis attack  that begins during the AE  reporting period should be reported as an  AE, 
and the resulti ng appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Drug Reaction  (ADR) and Suspected Adverse Reaction  (SAR) 
An adverse drug reaction (A DR) refers to  any AE caused by a drug.

OCU-300-301  12 July2018 
44 
 Suspected adverse reaction  (SAR)  refers to  any AE  for which ther e is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE . For the  purposes of safety reporting, “ reasonable possibility ” indicates that  there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug  and the AE . An SAR  implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than an ADR (21 CFR 312.32(a)).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected  Adverse Reaction  (UAR)  
The Sponsor is responsible for assessing AEs for expectedness. With regards to reporting to the FDA, an 
AE is considered “unexpected” when its nature (specificity), sev erity, or rate of occurrence is not 
consistent with applicable product information as described in the safety information provided in the 
protocol/package insert/ Investigator ’s brochure/prescribing information for brimonidine tartrate . 
"Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or SARs  that are mentioned in the 
Investigator’s brochure as occurring with a class of drugs  or as anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug  under 
investigation (21 CFR 312.32(a)).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Interest (AEIs)  
Not applicable.  
 Severity of AEs/SAEs  
The study site will grade the clinical severity of AEs experienced by [CONTACT_541589]:  
• Mild: Causes no limitation of usual activities  
• Moderate: Causes some limitation of usual activities  
• Severe: Prevents or severely limits usual activities  
Note:  The terms serious and severe are not synonymous. Serious cr iteria as defined in S ection  [IP_ADDRESS] 
above serve as a guide fo r defining regulatory reporting obligations.  The term severe is often used to 
describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe headache); the event 
itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance. This is not the same as serious, which is 
based on patient/ adverse outcome. Therefore, an AE of severe headache might not be considered serious, 
but a moderate infection for which a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176991]. 
 Relationship to Investig ational Drug  Treatment  
An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE and must be provided for all 
AEs (serious and non- serious).  
The Sponsor’s determination of attribution will be used for reporting to the appropriate health authorities. The relation of an AE to study participation will be determined using the descriptors and definitions provided in Table 5
.

Table 5. Attribution of Adverse Events  
Unrelated  
 
 
 
Possibly 
Related  The AE is clearly/most probably  caused by [CONTACT_541591]’s 
underlying condition, therapeutic intervention or concomitant therapy, or the  delay 
between administration and the onset of the AE is incompatible with a causal relation, 
or the AE started before administration (screening phase). Therefore, there is not a 
reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_630206] . 
The adverse event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug (including the course after withdrawal of the drug) and the possibility that drug 
involvement cannot be excluded, e.g. existence of similar reports attributable to the 
suspected drug, its analog or its pharmacological effect. However, other factors such 
as underlying disease, concomitant drugs , or concurrent treatment are presumable  
Related  There is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_251274] d rug. 
The expression “reasonable possibility” is meant to convey , in general , that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship  (21 CFR 312.32(a)).   
The Investigator  should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility 
that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]. Any AE that is suspected to be 
related to the investigational product  will be classified as an A DR.  
 Collecting and Recording Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Period of Collectio n 
All AEs will be collected from the time of informed consent  through the subject’s final study visit. All 
AEs and SAEs should be treated as medically appropriate  and followed until event resolution .   
The investigator will follow unresolved AEs to resolution until the subject is lost to follow -up or until the 
AE is otherwise classified. Resolution means the subject has returned to baseline state of health or the 
investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE. If the subject is lost to 
follow -up, the investigator should make [ADDRESS_917022], 
or certified mail. All follow -up will be documented in the subjec t’s source document. Non- serious AEs 
identified on the last scheduled contact  [CONTACT_677786].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Methods of Collection  
Adverse events may be collected as follows:  
• Observing the participant  
• Questioning the participant in an unbiased and non- leading  manner  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the  participant  
An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an AE  if it is  
determined by [CONTACT_310156]. If this is the case, it must be recorded in the 
source document and as an AE on the appropriate AE form(s). The evaluation that produced the value or 
Ocugen   Protocol version  1.0 
OCU-300-301  12 July2018 
46 
 result should be repeated until that value or result returns to normal or is stabilized  and the participant’s 
safety is not at risk.  Note: In this study, there are no planned laboratory evaluations.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Recording Method  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_917023]’s own words. Whenever possible, the Investigator  should combine 
signs and symptoms into a single term that constitutes a sin gle diagnosis. Each AE is to be evaluated for 
duration, severity, seriousness, and relatedness to study drug. The severity of the AE and its relationship to the study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_737] . 
The Investigator  will treat participants exper iencing AEs appropriately and observe them at suitable 
intervals until their symptoms resolve or their status stabilizes. If any medication is administered in 
response to the AE, this medication should be noted on the concomitant medication CRF as a concom itant 
medication administered. If possible, medications administered in response to an AE would not constitute 
a change in the patient’s ongoing DED regimen.  As noted, a significant change in the over -the-counter 
DED regimen (e.g., artificial tears, eyelid  massage, warm compresses), or in cyclosporine ophthalmic 
emulsion 0.05% (Restasis ®), or lifitegrast ophthalmic solution, 5% (Xiidra ®) during the study should be 
avoided, if possible. In addition, corticosteroid containing eyedrops are prohibited within [ADDRESS_917024] also be recorded. The Investigator will follow a non -serious AE 
until resolution, stabilization of the Follow- up Visit. The Investigator  will follow an SAE (regardless o f 
relationship to study drug until the event resolves, stabilizes, or becomes non- serious. The terms of AE 
resolution (i.e., recovered/ resolved, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/ resolved with sequelae, 
recovering/resolving, fatal, unknown) should also be recorded.   
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events will be recorded on the AE CRF and on the SAE CRF , and health authorities will 
be notified as outlined in S ection  [IP_ADDRESS].  
 Reporting Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting  SAEs  to the Sponsor  
The following process for reporting an SAE ensures compliance with [ADDRESS_917025] include the following: 
• Reporter 
• Subject ID  
• Study product or intervention  
• Serious AE term  
Ocugen   Protocol version  1.0 
OCU-300-301  12 July2018 
47 
 • Relationship to study medication(s) 
• Reason why the event is serious  
Supplemental CRF pages should be current at the time of SAE reporting: medical history, concomitant 
medications, demographics, study drug administration , and death , as applicable.  
Unavailable details of the event should not delay submission of the known information. As additional details become available, the SAE CRF should be updated and re -submitted . 
All SAEs, regardless of relationship to the study treatment , must be reported to the Sponsor (or designee) 
within 24 hours of the Investigators’ becoming aware of the event. An initial written SAE report should 
be faxed to Trial Runners/TFS Fax Number:  
.  This instruction pertains to initial SAE reports and to an y 
follow-up reports.  
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and supporting medical documents 
should be included with the report. Follow- up SAE reports must be submitted by [CONTACT_677787].  
The Safety Associate will forward the SAE reports and documents to the Medical Monitor and the 
Sponsor for review.

[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious A dverse E vents to FDA  
The Sponsor will report Investigational New Drug (IND) Safety Reports to the FDA and Investigator s, in 
accordance with the FDA regulations detailed in the 21 CFR 312.32.  
After the SAE has been reported by [CONTACT_677790], there are 2 
options for the IND Sponsor to report an event to the appropriate health authorities:  
Ocugen   Protocol version  1.[ADDRESS_917027] reporting (report in the IND annua l report) is required . This option applies if the AE is 
classified as one of the following: 
• Serious, SAR per the definitions section ( Section 10.1.1)  
• Serious and not an SAR per the definitions section ( Section 10.1.1 ) 
Expedited reporting is required.  This option applies if the AE /safety finding  is classified as one of the 
following: 
• Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) per the definitions section  
(Section  10.1.1 ) 
The S ponsor must report any SAR  that is both serious and unexpected. The Sponsor must report AE  as an 
SAR  only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study product and the  AE, such 
as: 
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with 
the product treatment  (e.g. bradycardia, iritis ). 
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with product treatment but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the product .  
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that 
commonly occur in the study population independent of investigational product therapy) that 
indicates those events occur more frequently in the treatment group than in a concurrent or 
historical control group. 
• Any safety findings from other studies: The S ponsor must report any findings from other 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], pooled analysis of multiple studies, or clinical or nonclinical studies 
that suggest a significan t risk in humans exposed to the investigational product that would 
result in a safety -related change in the prot ocol, informed consent, Investigator ’s brochure, or 
other aspects of the overall conduct of the study. 
These events, which require unmask ing, must be reported by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor to the appropriate health 
authorities within 15 calendar days; fatal or life-threatening events must be reported within [ADDRESS_917028] 
they might be pregnant (e.g., mis sed or late menstrual period). If pregna ncy is confirmed, the subject will 
be withdrawn from the study and followed until the pregnancy comes to term.   
The Investigator  is responsible for reporting  all available pregnancy information on the Pregnancy 
Questionnaire Form (provided by [CONTACT_1034]) within [ADDRESS_917029] be discontinued immediately in the event 
of a pregnancy. The patient should be referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive 
toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Monitoring of the participant should continue until the 
conclusion of the pregnancy. The Investigator  is responsible for reporting  the outcome of the pregnancy

OCU-300-301  12 July2018 
49 
 and the health of the newborn on the Pregnancy Outcome Form (provided by [CONTACT_1034]) as it becomes 
available. Partner pregnancies of a male subject do not need to be reported .  
Any pregnancy complication or premature terminat ions including miscarriage, spontaneous abortion or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be report ed as an SAE , as described in 
Section 10.1.5. If the pregnancy result s in a congenital abnormality or birth defect, a separate SAE report 
must be submitted. Furthermore, all neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_917030] of superiority of topi[INVESTIGATOR_677726]310 vs OBS drops with a set of ordered 
endpoints to be tested in a fixed sequence.  
 
Tests will be conducted using two- sided  alpha = .[ADDRESS_917031] a single eye identified as the study eye as follows: (i) if only 1 eye meets inclusion criteria, this eye will be the study eye and the other eye will be considered the non -qualified fellow eye; (ii) if both eyes 
meet inclusion criteria, the eye with the higher Lissami ne Green conjunctival staining  score will be the 
study eye and the other eye will be considered the qualified fellow eye; (iii) if both eyes have the same 
Lissamine Green conjunctival staining  score, then the eye with the lower Schirmer score will be the s tudy 
eye and the other eye will be considered the qualified fellow eye; (iv) if both eyes have same Schirmer  score, the right eye will be the study eye and the other eye will be considered the qualified fellow eye. 
Analysis of safety and efficacy variables measured at the eye level  will be primarily performed on the study 
eyes and secondarily on the qualified fellow eyes (for efficacy) and all fellow eyes (for safety).   
 
The unit of analyses for variables measured at the subject level will be the subject.  
 
 Power and Sample Size Determination  
 
One-hundred eight  subjects in each of the OCU 310 and placebo arms yields 9 9% power to reject H [ADDRESS_917032] deviation of 25.0, and a two-sided alpha = 0.05.  
Ocugen   Protocol version  1.0 
OCU- 300-301  12 July 2018  
50 
  
Additionally, 108 study eyes in each of the OCU 310 and placebo arms yields 90% power to reject H [ADDRESS_917033] deviation of 1.35, and a two-sided alpha 
= 0.05.   
 
For the secondary endpoints , change from baseline in SANDE score at Day 14  and change from baseline 
in Lissamine Green conjunctival staining scores at Day 14, there are not enough data to make a 
powe r/sample size statement . 
 
For the primary analyses, w ith [ADDRESS_917034] approximately 90% power to reject 
both H01 and H02, assuming independence between endpoints (with higher power should the endpoints be 
positively correlated) , and conclude the OCU 310 to be superior  to placebo  in both the mean change from 
baseline SANDE score at 4 weeks and the mean change from baseline Lissamine Green conjunctival 
staining score in the study eye at 4 weeks.  
 
Accounting for 10% subject discont inuations, 240 total subjects will be enrolled  (120 per arm) . 
 
Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s (in fixed sequence) : 
 
1. Change from baseline to 4 weeks (Day 28)  in SANDE score  
2. Change from baseline to 4 weeks (Day 28)  in Lissamine Green conjunctival s taining  scores  
3. Change from baseline to 2 weeks (Day 14)  in SANDE score  
4. Change from baseline to 2 weeks (Day 14)  in Lissamine Green conjunctival staining  scores  
 
These endpoints will be tested in a fixed sequence proceeding to the next endpoint until a p- value >0.05 is 
found.  
 
Exploratory Endpoint (s): 
• Change  from baseline to 4 weeks (Day 28)  in Lissamine Green corneal staining  scores  
• Change  from baseline to 2 weeks (Day 14)  in Lissamine Green corneal staining  scores using a 
standard grading scale, such as N EI or Oxford Schema    
• Change from baseline to 4 weeks (Day 28)  in Schirmers scores  
• Change in appearance from baseline to 4 weeks (Day 2 8) in Validated Bulbar Redness (VBR) 
scale  
• Change in appearance from baseline to 4 weeks (Day 14 ) in Validated Bulbar Red ness (VBR)

 Analysis Populations  
 
Safety Population  
The safety set will be the primary analysis set for the safety endpoints and will include all subjects  who 
have signed informed consent forms, were randomized into the study, and who took at least one dose of 
study  drug. The safety set will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received.  
Intent -to-treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT set will be the primary analysis set for the efficacy endpoints and will include all randomized 
subjects who have at least one post -baseline efficacy measurement. The ITT population will be analyzed 
according to the planned treatment.  
Per-protocol (PP) Population 
The PP population set will be tested to confirm the robustness of the primary analysis and will include all 
ITT subjects who have no major protocol deviations. The PP population will be analyzed according to the 
treatment actually received.  Efficacy and Safety Analyses  
 
 Background and Demographic Characteristics  
Demographics and base line characteristics including sex, age, race, height, weight, and ocu lar and 
medical history will be summarized for the safety population overall and for the ITT population by 
[CONTACT_1570].  
 Efficacy Analys es 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Analys es 
The primary efficacy analyses will be conducted on the ITT population. The same set of efficacy analyses 
will also be performed on the per -protocol population.  
Four  endpoints  (two primary and two secondary)  will be tested in a fixed sequence proceeding to the next 
endpoint until a p- value >0.05 is found  (Section 11.3). The analysis of the four outcomes will employ a 
repeated  measures mixed  model with mean change from baseline score at the stated time point  as the 
response with  baseline score as a covariate and treatment , visit, and their interaction as fixed effects.  The 
least squares mean d ifference (OCU 310 –  placebo) at the stated time point will be tested. The 2- sided p-
values and associated 95% confidence intervals will be presented.  
 
The following type of hypothesis will be tested:  
H01: The difference (OCU 310 minus placebo) , between su bjects  treated with the OCU 310 and 
subjects treated with placebo  in the mean change from baseline = 0.  
Ocugen   Protocol version  1.0

 HA1: The difference (OCU 310 minus placebo) , between subjects  treated with the OCU 310 and 
subjects treated with placebo  in the mean change from baselin e ≠ 0, with superiority 
claimed if the difference <  0. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Analys es—General Considerations  
Efficacy analyses will be conducted primarily on the ITT population. The same set of efficacy analyses 
will also be performed on per -protocol population. For e fficacy endpoints where measurements from 
both eyes are available, the study eye will be used  for the analyses .  
For continuous endpoints, the change from baseline will be summarized with descriptive statistics for the 
values at baseline, values at each post-baseline time point (Day 14 and Day 28), and for the change from 
baseline at each time point for the set of patient s who have data at both the baseline and the time point being 
assessed.  Categorical study assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_139679] v isit (as applicable) using 
frequency counts and percentages.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Analyses  
Safety analyses will be performed on the Safety set . Safety parameters include ocular examinations, vital 
signs, AEs, and slit -lamp examinations. Safety data will be reported for all patients  that have signed 
informed consent  documents . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events   
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies and percentages of subjects 
with treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing pre mature 
discontinuation will be provided by [CONTACT_1570]. An AE is treatment  emergent if it occurs or worsens 
after the first dose of study treatment. Furthermore,  frequencies will be given of subjects with TEAEs by 
[CONTACT_9313], by [CONTACT_677791], by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and 
maximal severity, by  [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and strongest relationship, and by [CONTACT_677792], maximal severity, and strongest relationship. Separate summaries will be  performed 
for ocular and non- ocular AEs. The treatment groups will be compared with respect to safety 
endpoints descriptively. No i nferential comparison will be conducted.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Missing Data 
The primary efficacy analyses will be performed using the ITT population, and using a  repeated measures 
model without any imputation for missing observations. Sensitivity  analyses using different analysis 
populations and methods for handling missing data may  be further detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).  
Secondary anal yses will also be based on observed data. Missing data handling techniques  for secondary 
endpoints may also be detailed in the SAP . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Visit Windows  
All data collected during study follow -up will be displayed and analyzed according to the actual visit data 
in the CRF . Assessments taken outside of windows described in the protocol will be displayed according 
to the CRF  assessment recorded by [CONTACT_737] . 
  DIRECT ACCESS TO SO URCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
 Study Monitoring  
According to ICH GCP guidelines, the S ponsor o f the study is responsible for ensuring the proper 
conduct of the study regarding protocol adherence and validity of data recorded on the CRFs . The 
Sponsor  is responsible for assigning the study monitor(s) to this study. The study monitor’s duties are to 
aid the Investigator  and the CRO  in the maintenance of complete, accurate, legible, well -organized, and 
easily retrievable data. The study monitor will advise the Investigator  of the regulatory necessity for 
study -related monitoring, audits, IRB(s) review, and inspection by [CONTACT_46379]/documents. In addition, the study monitor will explain to and interpret for the Investigator  all 
regulations applicable to the clinical evaluation of an investigational drug as documented in ICH 
guidelines.  
It is the study monitor’s responsibility to inspect the CRFs and source documentation throughout the 
study to protect the rights of the subjects ; to verify adherence to the protocol; to verify completeness, 
accuracy, and consistency of the data; and to confirm adherence of study conduct to any local regulations. 
Details will be outlined in the clinical  monitoring plan.   
The Sponsor  requires that the Investigator  prepare and maintain adequate and accurate records for each 
subject treated with the  investigational drug. Source documents such as any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], clinic, or office 
charts and the signed informed consent forms are to be included in the Investigator ’s files with the 
subject ’s study records.  
Study data will be captured on paper source docume nts and ultimately electronic case files Study site 
personnel will record  CRF data from source documents. Subjects will record selected study assessments 
directly into the CRF . If any data are first recorded onto documents such as laboratory reports, these 
documents will be considered source.

 Data Collection and Management  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the ICH document “Guidance for Industry- E6 Good 
Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance,” dated April 1996. This study will also be conducted in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki ( 2013 ).  
This study will use (TR/TFS/vendor)  for data collection and data management . The Investigator  is 
responsible for ensuring that all sections of each CRF are completed promptly and correctly and that 
entries can be verified against any source data.   
Study monitors will perform 100% source document verification to ensure there are no inconsistencies 
between the CRFs and source documents. Discrepancies will be resolved in accordance with the 
principl es of GCP.  Detailed study monitoring procedures are provided in the clinical monitoring plan.  
At intervals throughout the study and upon completion, data will be exported from the database into SAS 
datasets.  
Data management will be coordinated by [CONTACT_677793]  (TR/TFS/vendor)   in accordance with their 
SOPs for data management and a formal study data management plan.   
Adverse events will be coded with MedDRA. Concomitant medications will be coded using the World 
Health  Organization – Drug Reference List .  
 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Quality assurance includes all the planned and systematic actions that are established to ensure that the 
clinical study is performed,  and the data are generated, documented (recorded) , and reported according to 
ICH GCP and local/regional regulatory standards.  
A quality assurance representative from the  Sponsor , who is independent of and separated from routine 
monitoring, may periodically arrange inspections/audits of the clinical study by [CONTACT_677794]. These inspections may include on- site inspections/audits and source data 
checks. Direct access to source documents is required for these periodic inspections/audits . 
 ETHICS  
 Ethics Review  
The Investigator  will not start this study, nor will investigational devices be shipped to the Investigator ’s 
site, before providing the Sponsor with evidence of the IRB(s) approval . The Investigator  will promptly 
report to the IRB all changes in the research activity and all unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subjects. The Investigator  will not make any changes in the research without  the IRB(s) approval, except 
where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects. The Investigator  will provide 
progress reports to the IRB(s ) as required by [CONTACT_1201](s) . The Investigator  will provide a final report to the 
IRB(s) after completion of participation in the study.  
Ocugen   Protocol version  1.[ADDRESS_917035] to 
confirm agreement. The Investigator  will not implement any amendment (deviation or changes of the 
protocol) without agreement by [CONTACT_211297] d the IRB(s) approval/information, except where necessary 
to eliminate immediate hazards to study subjects or when changes involve only logistical or 
administrative aspects of the study.   
 Written Informed Consent  
 Subject  Information and Informed Consent  
The informed consent form  will be approved by [CONTACT_677795]. The 
Investigator  is responsible for ensuring that the subject fully understands the nature and purpose of the 
study. Information should be given in both oral and w ritten form whenever possible. No subject should be 
obliged to participate in the study. Subjects, their relatives, guardians, or (if applicable) legal 
representatives must be given ample opportunity to inquire about details of the study. The information 
must make clear that refusal to participate in the study or withdrawal from the study at any stage is 
without any prejudice to the subject’s subsequent care. Subjects must be allowed sufficient time to decide 
whether they wish to participate.  
The subject m ust be made aware of and give consent  to direct access to his/her source medical records by 
[CONTACT_1750], auditors, the IRB(s) , and regulatory authorities. The subject should be informed that such 
access will not violate subject confidentiality or any ap plicable regulations. The subject should also be 
informed that he/she is authorizing such access by [CONTACT_1725].  
Each subject will be given a signed copy of the informed consent form to keep for his/her records.   
 Provision of New and  Important Information Influencing Subject ’s Consent and 
Revision of the Written Information  
When any new and important information that may be relevant to the subject ’s consent is obtained, the 
Investigator  and Sponsor  will consult with each other on how to deal with the information. When the 
Sponsor  and a responsible Investigator  judge it necessary, the Investigator  must immediately provide the 
subjects with such information, revise the written information and other explanatory documents based on 
the new information, and obtain approval from the IRB(s) . In this instance, the Investigator  should also 
immediately inform subjects currently participating in the clinical study of such information, confirm 
their intention to continue participation, re -explain the study to them using the revised written information 
and other explanatory documents, and obtain written consent to continue participation based on their 
voluntary decision.

 APPENDICE S 
 
 Appendix 1. Validated Bulbar Redness Grading Scales (VBR) 
To evaluate ocular redness, the same physician (PI) must assess the subject at all examinations, and under 
consistent illumination. Exam inations must be completed by a slit lamp at 10X magnification using direct 
diffuse illumination (slit fully opened, angled at 30°- 50° approximately; at half illumination intensity 
with rheostat set to maximum voltage).  
A set of  colored reference images w ill be provided at high resolution (with one image per page) (Figure 
1). To maintain the integrity of the original image, the photos should not be photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_677754] . Multiple sets of images wi ll be provided to each site, corresponding with the 
number of examination rooms. If a set of images is lost or damaged, a new one will be supplied to the 
site.   
During the examination, a sk the subject  to look at nasal or temporal fixation marks while the temporal or 
nasal bulbar conjunctivae, respectively are examined by [CONTACT_099] . Compar e the physician’s 
assessment of the bulbar conjunctival injection of the subject’s eye (nasal and temporal) to the reference images in the VBR , and grade accordingly i n the subject’s source documents and CRFs. 
Using the 10- pi[INVESTIGATOR_677755] a number (e.g. 10, 20,… 80,  90, or  100) that best 
approximates but does not overestimate the average level of bulbar redness observed in each eye (OD, 
OS). There is no image representing an absolute grade 0, because the bulbar conjunctiva usually exhibits 
some level of redness. Therefore,  a white eye would be scored as a 10 .  
Figure 1. Validated Bulbar Redness Scale  
Source: Shulze, 2007  
This manner of testing with increments of 10 as chosen because this assessment yields a slightly higher 
level of repeatability than continuous scales (e.g. 1, 1.1, 1.2…9.8, 9.9, 10 ) and  a strong linear association 
between test and retest.  
The above scale will be measured at Screening and at each study visit: Baseline (prior to first dose), Day 
14± 3d, and Day 28 ± 7d.

 Appendix 2. Symptom Assessment iN Dry Eye (SANDE)  
Administer the questionnaire at Screening, Day 1 (prior to dosing), and again at Day 14 ± 3d, and  Day 28 
± 7d. 
At each visit, ask the subject to  place a mark on each of the “frequency” and “severity” lines  below based 
on the extent of their current dry eye symptoms  (Figure 2 ).  
Measure t he locations of the marks made by [CONTACT_677799] s, from left to right on the 100 mm 
horizontal lines ; record  the results in the subject’s source documents and CRFs. 
The overall SANDE score will be calculated by [CONTACT_677776] (Amparo, 2015; Saboo, 2015).

 Appendix 3.  Ocular Surface Staining: Lissamine Green 
Lissamine Green dye (approximately 5  µL of 1% solution) will be applied over the surf ace of both eyes.  
A solution shall be made from Lissamine Green Ophthalmic Strips .  
 Lissamine Solution  
Materials Supplied:  
1.Lissamine Green (LG) Ophthalmic Strips (NDC [ZIP_CODE]-920-11) impregnated with 1.5 mg of
LG/strip
2. Sterile Saline (0.9 %) solution (suppli ed as syringe filled normal saline)
3. Sterile microfuge tubes (1.5 mL)
4.Sterile pi[INVESTIGATOR_590193] (5 µL (microliter) and 200 µL volume dispensing)
5.Fixed Volume Pi[INVESTIGATOR_6343] (5 µL and 200 µL)
Lissamine Green Ophthalmic Strips (NDC [ZIP_CODE] -920-11) impregnated with 1.5 mg of LG dye will be 
used to prepare LG solution. Dispense saline (about 0.5 to I mL) from the pre- filled syringe to an empty 
sterile microfuge tube. From the microfuge tube, dispense [ADDRESS_917044] the strips and use the LG solution for staining. Mix the LG solution by [CONTACT_677800][INVESTIGATOR_677756].  
Instillation of Lissamine Green 
Take out 5 µL of LG solution from microfuge tube using 5 µL fixed volume pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462] a ttached with sterile 
tip and apply in the lower conjunctival cul-de-sac (inferior conjunctival fornix) by [CONTACT_677801] a pocket and instilling the dye. Instruct the subject to blink 5 times and avoid closing eyelids tightly or squeezing ey elids after dye instillation and ask to move the eyes in all directions (left, right, up and 
down) while blinking gently to spread the dye.  
Ocular surface staining is recorded 1 -2 minutes after dye instillation (within 4 minutes) as the staining 
fades var iably after [ADDRESS_917045],  and the 
process will be repeated in the left eye.  
Evaluating Lissamine G reen  Staining 
Using  the slit lamp ( white l ight of m oderate intensity a nd a Hoya 25A red barrier filter or Kodak Wratten 
92 filter) , c orneal and conjunctival staining wi ll be graded using the grading system described below 
modified from the NEI S cale (Lempe 1995).  
The sco
ring pattern is represented  below in Figures 3 and 4. The dots are ordered on a log scale.

OCU-300-301 12 July2018 
65 Figure 3. Lissamine Green Corneal Staining Pattern and Gra d e (NEI Scale)  
Corne
al staining will be graded in 5 zones (C entral  (3mm),  Superior, Infer ior, N asal, and Temporal ).  
Each zone will be graded from 0 to 3 based on the density of punctate staining (maximum score =  15). 
Similarly , the conjun ctiva will be graded for each eye from 0 to 3 based on the density of punctate 
staining in the nasal- bulbar and temporal -bulbar zones staining (maximum score = 6) ( Figure 4 ). Instruct 
the subject to look toward the midline (nasally) to grade the temporal zone. Likewise, instruct the subject 
to look temporally to grade the nasal conjunctiva. 
Figur
e 4. Lissamine Green Conjunctival Staining Pattern and Grade (NEI Scale)  
Becaus
e Lissamine Green  dye can fade variably within 4 -5 minutes, results should be recorded within 
approximately 1- 2 minutes of application to the eye surface. Scoring is demonstrated in Table 6 .

should be tested first  
 Standard ETDRS Visual Acuity Protocol  
The ETDRS visual acuity charts [ADDRESS_917047]/use an ETDRS light 
box for the ETDRS visual acuity charts du ring any study acuity testing if the EVA is non -functional. The 
light box should be hung on the wall or placed on a stand at a height such that the  top of the 3rd row of 
letters (0.8 LogMAR) is 49 + 2 inches (124.5 +  5.1 cm) from the floor. The distance fr om the outer 
canthus of the subject’s eye to the front of the ETDRS chart should be 4.[ADDRESS_917048] of the white background the ETDRS charts, examiners 
should refrain from  touching the front of the charts with their fingers, pens, pencils, etc. If the ETDRS 
charts become permanently damaged or yellowed, they should be replaced. The ETDRS vision testing 
equipment (illuminator cabinet, floor stand with casters, Original Serie s ETDRS charts, and replacement 
tubes with aluminum sleeves) can be ordered from Precision Vision, [ADDRESS_917049], La Salle, IL, 
[ZIP_CODE], 800 -772-9211 (phone).  
 Illumination of Visual Acuity Charts and Room  
Room lighting should be uniform between the subje ct and the light box.  
The two 20- watt (Cool Daylight) fluorescent tubes in the ETDRS light box must be changed annually ; a 
sticker must be affixed to the side or back of the light box with the date that the bulbs were changed. Cool 
Daylight  (20- watt) fluorescent tubes can be purchased from a local hardware store. When changing the 
fluorescent tubes, the aluminum fenestrated sleeves must be saved and centered on the new light tubes 
with the opening of the sleeves pointing towards the back of the light box. If the aluminum sleeves are 
discarded, they must be replaced. ( Precision Vision, [ADDRESS_917050], La Salle, IL, [ZIP_CODE], 800- 772-
9211 (phone) . Furthermore, when changing the fluorescent light tubes, the new tubes must be “burned 
in” (i.e., left on continuou sly for  4 days or 96 hours) before using the ETDRS light box.

 Uncorrected (UCVA) and Best -Corrected VA (BCVA)  
For BCVA, the subject will be fitted with a half eye trial frame provided by [CONTACT_1034], containing the 
manifest subjective refraction result, ad justed for optical infinity.  
 Recording and Scoring VA  
Using the Sponsor supplied recording/scoring sheet, an example of which is shown below, the tester will CIRCLE ALL CORRECT RESPONSES, PUT AN “X” THROUGH THE MISSED LETTERS, AND INSTRUCT THE SUBJECT TO  FINISH READING THE ENTIRE LINE.  
THE SPONSOR -SUPPLIED SCORING SHEET MUST BE KEPT IN THE SUBJECT SOURCE 
RECORD.  
Each line on the ETDRS chart has [ADDRESS_917051] letters will be recorded on the recording/scoring sheet in the far -right box on the corresponding line. The lines will then be added up and 
the “TOTAL” number of letters correctly identified will be recorded on the recording/scoring sheet. The 
“TOTAL” is the number that will be entered onto the CRF . For subjects who are unable to see ANY 
letters, or for subjects whose best VA could be recorded as finger count, hand movement, light perception 
or no light perception, a score of “0” will be recorded on both the source document and on the CRF . 
Example: 
For instance, all lines were read  correctly through line 7, line [ADDRESS_917052] responses, and VA 
testing was completed. The total letters correctly identified would be 17 and it would be recorded in the space marked “TOTAL” (see Figure 5
)

 Appendix 5. Intraocular Pressu re (IOP)  
 
Intraocular Pressure (IOP) will be measured in both eyes.  IOP will be measured at Screening and at each  
study visit: Day 1  (prior to first dose), Day 14 ±  3d, and Day 28 ±  7d. 
  Calibration  of Tonometer  
The Goldmann tonometer  shall be used for IOP  measurements. The tonometer must  be calibrated before 
first use and calibration will be checked by [CONTACT_677802], with 
the weight system at 0, 2, and 6 grams as supplied by [CONTACT_3455]. When the calibration steps 
provide readings within ± 0.[ADDRESS_917055] maintain written documentation (e.g., unit model or serial 
number, calibration date, n ame/initial of pers on pe rforming calibration, indication of pass or fail) of the 
calibration of each tonometer throughout the study period.  
 IOP Measurement  
IOP will be taken as follows:  
1. Anaesthetize the selected eye of the subject . 
2. Stain with sodium fluorescein.  
NOTE – step may be combined by [CONTACT_677803].  
3. Set the tonometer drum to a force corresponding to an IOP of  [ADDRESS_917056] to view a distance fixation point.  
NOTE – If distance fixation cannot be maintained and near fixatio n is used, this fact should be 
recorded . 
5. Measure the IOP for the mean of the ocular pulse and remove the tonometer from the eye.  
6. Repeat steps if the measurement was not valid due to  the following reasons ;  
• The patient felt a sensation  
• The eyelid was touch ed 
• The fluorescein ring was too broad or too small  
• Any other circumstances suggest ing that the measurement may have been inaccurate

The study doctor wants to know if you would like to be part of a research study. This form describes the 
study to help you decide whether you want to participate. This form will tell you what you will have to 
do during the study and the risks and benefits of th e study.   If you have any questions about, or do not 
understand something in this form, you should ask the study doctor.  Do not sign  and date  this form 
unless the study doctor or study staff has answered your questions and you decide that you want to  be 
part of this study .  When you have completed reading this form, if you would like to take part in this 
study, you  will sign the form  on the last page,  initial  and date  each  page,  and hand  it back  to your study 
doctor.  You should also remember that being in this study does not replace your regular medical  care.    
 
WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT?  
You are invited to take part in a research study because your medical history indicates you have Dry Eye 
Disease (DED) .  This study is being done to see how safe a nd effective an i nvestigational product is in the 
treatment of your eye disease.  
 
By [CONTACT_4907], you will be help ing the study Sponsor  evaluate a new therapy for this 
condition.   This investigational drug is an eye drop containing  Brimonidine , a drug that has already been 
approved  by [CONTACT_677804], but in the form of a nano -emulsion, which 
increases the time that the eye drop can stay on the surface of your eye.  Early studies in animals and 
humans indicate that brimonidine nano -emulsion, also known as OCU310 , can reli eve the signs and 
symptoms of DED .    This eye drop is being studied to see if  it can help you better manage your DED 
symptoms , which  may  include ocular pain or discomfort, and DED  signs, which  may  include redness.  
 
Your study doctor can explain how this  investigational  drug is intended to work. Your medical  history  
will be reviewed , and you will receive certain standard eye tests to assess the severity of your DED . You 
must be honest with the study doctor about your medical health history  or it may not be safe to 
participate in the study.

ARE THERE RISKS TO ME IF I AM IN THIS STUDY ? 
Any time you are enrolled in a  clinical study, there may be risks, discomfort, and side effects that are not 
yet known.   
As mentioned earlier, this is a randomized, double -masked study. This means that you will be randomly 
assigned to receive either OCU310 or PLACEBO study drug . Neither you nor the study doctor will know 
to which study medication you have been assigned. The study is designed in a way that you have a 
50/50  chance of being assigned OCU310 . Neither treatment ( OCU310 or Placebo) has a preservative.  
 
The placebo  in this study is called “ophthalmic buffered saline”  or OBS.  This is similar to “normal saline 
eye drops” or “normal saline solution”.  Normal saline is another name [CONTACT_677830], including tear drops. Some brands o f “artificial tears” contain normal saline. Therefore, some 
subjects receiving OBS in this study may experience some temporary relief from their DED symptoms. 
OBS is safe and widely used and no side effects are expected. Like most eye drops, there may be s ome 
temporary blurring of vision immediately after application, so wait until the blurring clears before 
operating your vehicle or heavy machinery.   
 
The active drug  in this study is “Brimonidine Nanoemulsion” or OCU310 .  You are encouraged to discuss 
the safety aspects of Brimonidine Nanoemulsion (OCU310 ) eye drops with your doctor .  
 
Brimonidine is currently approved for use as a treatment for glaucoma .  The FDA approval for 
brimonidine (Alphagan and Alphagan -P) includes data from three clinical studies in a total of 1214 
subjects . Additional safety information is available from 300 peer -reviewed articles involving 
13,983  subjects . In summary , brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution of up to 0.2% is considere d safe, 
based on the long history of chronic use and data available in the published literature.  
 
In clinical studies on its use for treating glaucoma, the following possible side effects have been reported 
in the approved product label:  
 
• 10-30% of sub jects experienced (in order of frequency):  
o Dry mouth,  
o Red eyes,  
o Burning/stinging in eyes,  
o Headache,  
o Blurring,  
o Eye allergic reactions.  
• 3-9% of subjects experienced (in order of frequency):  
o Corneal staining,  
o Sensitivity to light,  
o Eyelid redness,  
o Eye pain/irritation.

«Pi[INVESTIGATOR_154549] » XXXX IRB Approved Version xxxxxxxxxxx  Revised «PI[INVESTIGATOR_154550] » 
  
Less commonly, some of the following conditions have been reported:  
• Swelling of the eyelid with associated burning and dryness of the eye.  
• Swellin g of the eyelid along with pi[INVESTIGATOR_409474]. The symptoms of pi[INVESTIGATOR_677757] a reddening of the 
whites of the eyes, itchy eyes, and thick discharge around the eye, often after sleep.  
Because approved brimonidine (e.g., Alphagan and Alphagan -P) has a preservative, it is possible that 
some of the adverse events listed above are caused by [CONTACT_677806]. Of course, should you have any 
questions about changes in your health and/or vision , you should contact [CONTACT_677807] .  Please tell the study doctor or study staff right away if you experience any changes in your 
norma l routine .  Also,  please tell them if you experience any other problems with your health or the way 
you feel during the study  
 
WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND THEIR LIKELIHOOD FROM USING THIS NEW STUDY DRUG ? 
You and your study doctor will discuss the potential risks and likelihood of these risks from the use of 
this new study drug .  This new drug, OCU310, has “brimonidine” as its active ingredient, so the adverse 
events listed above could potentially occur.  B ecause the new drug, OCUI310, does not have a 
preservative, there will be no adverse events related to preservative . 
The Sponsor  has also uncovered the following risks that have been described with eyedrops, in general, 
when used for DED : 
• Skin rash on the eyelids  
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_409474]  
• Fungal infecti on from incorrect use of the eye drop  
 
ARE THERE RISKS IF I AM PREGNANT DURING THE STUDY ?  
 
Because the effect of this study medication  on babies  is unknow n, you may not participate  if you are a 
woman  who is pregnant  or planning to become pregnant . You may not participate if breast feeding .  
Please inform your study doctor  immediately if you become  pregnant during the study.  If you do 
become pregnant the sponsor will want to follow you to term or termination to collec t information 
about your pregnancy and birth.  If you are a female who is able to become pregnant you are required 
to use an acceptable method of birth control (oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], birth control implants/shots or 
patches, barrier methods) throughout the study.    
WILL BEING IN THIS STUDY HELP ME ? 
This new eye drop therapy may help you better manage your  DED symptoms , such as eye pain, or signs, 
such as redness, but there is no guarantee that this will occur.  Although being a research subject in this 
study may or may not help you personally, information from this study will help the study Sponsor , 
study doctors  and researchers come up with new tests or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_677758].

OCU310 Brimonidine Tartrate 0.2% Nanoemulsion Annual Report (August 
2018 – July 2019); April 20, 2020  
 
  
 
EFFICACY RESULTS:  
Demographic and Baseline Information  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics were comparable between the OCU  310 and 
placebo groups. Demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment groups. Briefly, overall mean (SD) age was 62 (12) year, and the majority of subjects were females (84%), and Caucasian (84%). Overall mean time since first DED diagnosis was 5 years. Compliance to the study treatment was ≥ 80%- ≤ 100% for the majority (99%) of subjects, 
and the median number of received doses was the same in the two treatment groups (55). Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
Change from baseline to Day 28 in SANDE score 
In the ITT set, both study treatments resulted in a reduction (i.e. improvement) from baseline to Day 28 in SANDE overall, and in frequency of symptoms and severity of symptoms scores. None of the comparisons of OCU  310 vs. placebo were statistically signi ficant, with estimated mean 
differences between the two treatments (OCU  310 - placebo) of -0.8 mm (p=  0.739) for the overall 
score, -2.7 mm (p=  0.297) for the frequency of symptoms score, and 0.7 mm (p=  0.803) for the 
severity of symptoms score. Results we re confirmed in  the PP set and, overall, in the subgroups 
(ITT set) analysis for the SANDE overall score with improver subjects, non -improver subjects, as 
well as subjects with SANDE ≥ 60 at baseline, SANDE ≥ median at baseline, VBR ≥ 40 at baseline, VBR ≥ 50 at baseline and VBR ≥ median at baseline.  
Change from baseline to Day 28 in lissamine green total conjunctival staining scores 
In the ITT set, both study treatments resulted in a reduction (i.e. improvement) from baseline to Day 28 in lissamine green total conjunctival staining scores in both the study eye and qualified fellow eye. For the study eye, the comparison OCU  310 vs. placebo was not statistically 
significant, with an estimated mean difference between the two treatments (OCU  310 - placebo) 
of 0.26 (p=  0.097). Results were confirmed in the PP set, and in the subgroups (ITT set) of 
improver and non- improver subjects.  
Secondary and Exploratory E fficacy E ndpoints  
None of the secondary or exploratory endpoints demonstrated a statistically signif icant difference 
in OCU310 vs. control, except for the V alidated Bulbar R edness scale (VBR) . 
With OCU 310, VBR scores (overall area) for the study eye and the qualified fellow eye decreased

(i.e. improved) from B aseline. With placebo, mean VBR scores (overall area) remained stable at 
all time points. In the ITT set, mean reductions from baseline in VBR score (overall area) were 
greater with OCU 310 than with placebo at both Day 14 and Day 28, with estimated mean 
differences between treatments (OCU  310 - placebo)  of - 2.8 (p= 0.006) and - 2.6 (p= 0.020), 
respectively. These results were confirmed in the PP set and, in the subgroups, (ITT set) of subjects 
with SANDE ≥ 60 at baseline, VBR ≥ 40 at baseline and VBR ≥ median at baseline.  
 
CONCLUSIONS:  This study showed that OCU 310 is generally safe and well -tolerated, though it did not meet its 
co-primary endpoints for DED symptom and sign. Importantly, OCU 310 was better than placebo 
in reducing ocular redness, an exploratory sign endpoint, at both Day 14 and Day 28.  
 
 
 
 
1. Safety Data Summary  
 
Only one clinical study (OCU310- 301) has been conducted thus far using the investigational drug 
(OCU3 10): 
 
Title of Study : A Phase 3 Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double- Masked, Multicenter, Safety 
and Efficacy Study of Brimonidine Tartrate 0.2% Nanoemulsion Eye Drops in Patients with Dry 
Eye Disease (DED)  
 
This study has been completed.  
 
SAFETY RESULTS:  
Brief Summary of Adverse Events  
All AEs were reported after the first dose of study treatment and therefore, all AEs were TEAEs 
(Table 2 ). Forty TEAEs (39 unique TEAEs) were reported in 34 (14%) subjects. In the OCU  310 
group, 27 TEAEs were reported in 23  (18%) subjects while 12  TEAEs were reported in 11 (8.7%) B. Summary Investigational Drug Information

subjects in the placebo group. Regarding treatment related TEAEs, 15 TEAEs were reported in 
12 (9.5%) subjects in the OCU  310 group and 5 TEAEs were reported in 4 (3.2%) subjects in the 
placebo group. TEAEs leading to study treatment discontinuation were reported only in the 
OCU 310 group, 2 TEAEs in 1 (0.8%) subject. The majority of TEAEs reported during the study treatment were of mild nature, and none were of severe na ture. There were no serious TEAEs, 
including TEAEs leading to death.

1. Rationale for the investigational drug or the research study  (studies):  
The proposed studies are conducted to support the submission of 505(b) (2) New Drug 
Application for OCU310. This Annual Report covers the only clinical study the Sponsor has 
conducted thus far using OCU310:  A Phase 3 Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double- Masked, Multicenter, Safety and Efficacy 
Study of Brimonidine Tartrate 0.2% Nanoemulsion Eye Drops in Patients with Dry Eye Disease (DED ) 
Currently, the only FDA -approved pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of DED  are 
Restasis®, Cequa™ and Xiidra®. Given the complexity, severity and frequency of DED, and the limited modes of action by [CONTACT_677818], there is a medical need for 
other DED therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], particularly those with multiple modes of action that target the wider DED population and are effective and safe for early relief and long- term daily use.  
Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.2% is an FDA -approved product that has 
demonstrated a robust safety profile via topi[INVESTIGATOR_677761]-angle 
glaucoma or ocular hypertension, with a low occurrence of adverse events (AEs). It was also shown to be safe and tolerable, while demonstrating preliminary efficacy, in a Phase 2 proof- of-concept study in subjects with DED conducted in 2017. 
OCU 310 is a sterile, preservative -free solution of brimonidine tartrate 0.2% in an ophthalmic 
nanoemulsion. It was developed for topi[INVESTIGATOR_677762]. To support the proposed indication, efficacy in both a sign and a symptom of DED are expected to be demonstrated in phase 3 studies. In the above -mentioned 
Phase 2 study of DED, positive efficacy signals were observed across multiple endpoints, consistent with the hypothesis that brimonidine works through multiple mechanistic pathways. The present study is further supported by [CONTACT_127620]- term safety profile of marketed brimonidine 
tartrate, the tolerability of brimonidine 0.2% in the Phase 2 study of DED and the added pharmaceutical benefits of the preservative- free nanoemulsion .

2018 – July 2019); April 20, 2020  
 
  
The General Investigational Plan for evaluating the investigational drug remains same as 
submitted in the original IND submission.   
4. Types of clinical studies to be conducted in the following  year:  
The clinical studies proposed to be conducted are as follows :  
None 
5. Estimated number of patients or subjects who will be administered the investigational drug under these studies during the following  year: 
Number of subjects: None  
6. Anticipated significant risks of study  participation:  
OCU310 was safe and well tolerated in the above -mentioned phase 3 study. No additional 
OCU310 studies are planned in the upcoming year. If a future OCU310 study is conducted, Ocugen does not anticipate any significant risks to the subjects enrolling in that study, based on the prior history of the drug and known clinical expe rience.

• Vital signs: diastolic blood pressure (DBP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR) , respir atory 
rate and body temperature (forehead)  
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
The following analysis sets were defined:  
• Randomized set: All randomized subjects who previously signed the informed consent.  
• Safety set: All subjects in the Randomized set who received at least one dose of the Investigational 
Medicinal Product.  
• Intention -To-Treat (ITT) set: All subjects in the Safety set with at least one post -baseline efficacy 
measurement.  
• Per protocol  (PP) set: All subjec ts in the ITT set who fulfilled the study protocol requirements with no 
major deviations that may affect study results.  
Unit of Analysis  
The unit of analysis for variables measured at the individual eye level was the study eye. Each subject 
had a single eye identified as the study eye as follows: (i) if only 1 eye met inclusion criteria, this eye 
was the study eye and the other eye was cons idered the non -qualified fellow eye; (ii) if both eyes met 
inclusion criteria, the eye with the higher lissamine green conjunctival staining score was the study eye 
and the other eye was considered the qualified fellow eye; (iii) if both eyes ha d the same lissamine green 
conjunctival staining score, then the eye with the lower Schirmer ’s score was the study eye and the 
other eye was considered the qualified fellow eye; (iv) if both eyes h ad same Schirmer ’s score, the right 
eye was the study eye and the other eye was considered the qualified fellow eye.  
Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints  
The analysis of the six primary/secondary outcomes employed a Mixed Model for Repeated 
Measure ments (MMRM) with mean change from baseline score (Day 28 for Primary, Day 28 and 14 for 
Secondary) as the response (dependent variable) with baseline value as a covariate and treatment, 
visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects (independe nt variables).  
The treatment comparisons (OCU 310 vs. Placebo) were carried out by [CONTACT_677821]® Software, using proc mixed. Treatment effects were estimated 
by [CONTACT_677822] 95% confidence interval ( CI). Differences between treatments 
were estimated and resulting 2 -sided p -values and associated 95% CI  were  presented.  
Primary and Secondary efficacy analyses were conducted primarily on the ITT set and repeated in the 
PP set for sensi tivity purposes . For efficacy endpoints where measurements from both eyes were 
available, the study eye was used for the analyses.  
Results of all primary  and secondary  analyses are graphically displayed as Forest Plots . 
Sites with low enrollment were collapsed into pseudo sites for  the primary efficacy analysis. Sites with 
the smallest number of enrolled subjects were  combined until a minimum of 10 subjects per pseudo site 
was achieved, with the restriction that no pseudo site created by [CONTACT_677823] 10 or more subjects enrolled.  
For key efficacy endpoints  (SANDE, lissamine green conjunctival staining, CGI and SGA)  two sub -groups 
were compared: Improvers vs. Non -Improvers. While all subjects enrolle d were to satisfy eligibility criteria 
at both Screening and Baseline  Visits , some study -eligible subjects (Improvers) may have clinically 
improved from the Screening  Visit to the Baseline  Visit, and this may dilute the overall tr eatment effect.

The definitions of Improver and Non -Improver were pre-specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.   
Post hoc  subgroup analyses were also done , based  on several baseline cut-off values  for SANDE  and VBR 
Analysis of exploratory endpoints  
• Changes from baseline to Day 28 in Schirmer’s score  were summarized  descriptively. A shift table 
was presented as well.  
• Changes from baseline to Day [ADDRESS_917092] plots.  
• Change from baseline to Day 14 and Day 28 in  temporal bulbar  and and nasal bulbar  lissamine  green 
conjunctival staining scores were presented in shift tables.  
• Changes in CGI and SGA from baseline to Day 14 and Day 28 were summarized descriptively.  
For CGI and SGA, results were also collapsed into two categories (Responder vs. Non -Responder ). 
Other efficacy analyses  
Time to improvement was investigated graphically through Kaplan -Meier curves.  
Post hoc  subgrou p analyses for three key endpoints (SANDE, VBR  and SGA) were also done, based 
on the following cut-off values : SANDE ≥60 at baseline, SANDE ≥median at baseline, VBR ≥40 at 
baseline, VBR ≥50 at baseline and VBR ≥median at baseline)  
Safety analyses  
Most s afety data were summarized  descriptively.  
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION S:  
EFFICACY RESULTS:  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics  were comparable between the OCU  310 and placebo 
groups. Demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment 
groups. Briefly, overall mean (SD) age was 62 (12) year, and the majority of subjects were females 
(84%), and Caucasian (84%). Overall mean time since first DED diagnosis  was 5  years. Compliance to 
the study treatment was ≥ 80%-≤ 100%  for the majority (99%) of subjects, and the median number of 
received doses was the same in the two treatment groups (55).  
Primary efficacy endpoints  
Change from baseline to Day 28 in SANDE score  
In the ITT set, both study treatments resulted in a reduction (i.e. improvement) from baseline to Day 28 
in SANDE overall, and in frequency of symptoms and severity of symptoms scores. None of the 
comparisons of OCU  310 vs. placebo were statistically  significant, with estimated mean differences 
between the two treatments (OCU  310 - placebo) of -0.8 mm (p=  0.739) for the overall score, -2.7 mm 
(p= 0.297) for the frequency of symptoms score,  and 0.7 mm (p=  0.803)  for the severity of symptoms 
score . Resu lts were confirmed in the PP set and, overall, in the subgroups (ITT set) analysis for the 
SANDE overall score with improver subjects, non -improver subjects, as well as subjects with SANDE ≥ 
60 at baseline, SANDE ≥ median at baseline, VBR ≥ 40 at baseline,  VBR ≥ 50 at baseline and VBR ≥ 
median at baseline.

the study eye, the comparison OCU  310 vs. placebo was not statistically significant, with an estimated 
mean difference between the two treatments (OCU  310 - placebo ) of 0.26 (p=  0.097). Results were 
confirmed in the PP set, and in the subgroups (ITT set) of improver and non -improver subjects.   
Secondary efficacy endpoints  
Change from baseline to Day 14 in SANDE score  
In the ITT set, both study treatments resulted in a reduction from baseline to Day 14 in SANDE overall, 
and in frequency of symptoms and severity of symptoms scores. None of the comparisons of OCU  310 
vs. placebo were statistically significant, with estima ted mean differences between the two treatments 
(OCU  310 - placebo) of 2.4 (p=  0.257) for the overall score, 2.8 (p=  0.210) for the frequency of symptoms 
score, and 2.1 (p=  0.354)  for the severity of symptoms score . Results were confirmed in the PP set and  
in the subgroups (ITT set) of subjects with SANDE ≥ 60 at baseline, SANDE ≥ median at baseline, VBR 
≥ 40 at baseline, VBR ≥ 50 at baseline and VBR ≥ median at baseline.   
Change from baseline to Day 14 in lissamine  green total conjunctival staining scores  
In the ITT set, both study treatments resulted in a reduction from baseline to Day 14 in lissamine green 
total conjunctival staining scores in both the study eye and qualified fellow eye. For the study eye, the 
comparison OCU  310 vs. placebo favor ed placeb o, with an estimated mean difference between the two 
treatments (OCU  310 - placebo) of 0.29 (p  = 0.034). Results were confirmed in the PP set.  
Change from baseline to Day 14 and Day 28 in lissamine  green total corneal staining scores  
In the ITT set, both study treatments resulted in a reduction from baseline to Day 14 and Day 28 in 
lissamine green total corneal staining scores in both the study eye and qualified fellow eye at Day 14 
and Day  28. For the study eye, the comparison OCU  310 vs. placebo fav ored placebo at Day 14, with 
an estimated mean difference between the two treatments (OCU  310 - placebo) of 0.6 (p=  0.016). At 
Day 28, the comparison OCU  310 vs. placebo was not statistically significant, with an estimated mean 
difference between the two t reatments of 0.53 in favor of placebo (p=  0.063). Results were confirmed in 
the PP set.  
Exploratory efficacy endpoints  
Schirmer’s score  
Both study treatments resulted in an increase (i.e. improvement) of Schirmer’s score at Day 28. Mean 
(SD) changes from b aseline was 1.9 (3.9)  mm for OCU  310 and 2.5 (4.5)  mm for the placebo group in 
the study eye, and for the qualified fellow eye was 1.6  (4.2) and 1.5  (3.0), respectively.  
Most study eyes and qualified fellow eyes had severe Schirmer’s score at baseline. Ove rall, the 
proportion of eyes with scores that improved from baseline were similar between groups in both the 
study eye and the qualified fellow eyes. Similarly, the proportion of study eyes and qualified fellow eyes

that deteriorated from baseline was simi lar in the two treatment groups in both study eye and qualified 
fellow  eye. In a post hoc  analysis on 124 study eyes (ITT), 14 (11%) of OCU310 subjects and 20 (16%) 
of placebo subjects  went from having a Schirm er’s score ≤10 mm at baseline  to a Schirmer’s score  
>10 mm (tear production)  at Day 28 .  
VBR scale  
With OCU  310, VBR scores (overall ar ea) for the study eye and the qualified fellow eye decreased (i.e. 
improved) from baseline. With placebo, mean VBR scores (overall area) remained stable at all time 
points. Results obtained for VBR scores for the nasal and temporal areas confirmed those ob tained for 
the overall area in both the study eye and qualified fellow eye. In the ITT set, mean reduction s from 
baseline in VBR score (overall area) were greater  with OCU  310 than with placebo at both Day 14 and 
Day 28, with estimated mean differences bet ween treatments (OCU  310 - placebo)  of -2.8 (p= 0.006) 
and -2.6 (p= 0.020), respectively. These results were confirmed in the PP set and in the subgroups (ITT 
set) of subjects with SANDE ≥ 60 at baseline, VBR ≥ 40 at baseline and VBR ≥ median at baseline. For 
the subgroups of subjects with SANDE ≥ median at baseline and VBR ≥ 50 at baseline non -significant 
differences were observed betw een groups at either time points.  
Temporal bulbar and nasal bulbar lissamine  green conjunctival staining scores  
Temporal bulbar lissamine  green conjunctival staining scores  
Overall, the number of study eyes and qualified fellow eyes that improved from base line to Day  14 and 
Day 28 were similar with OCU  310 and with placebo. Similarly, deteriorations from baseline were similar 
between groups.  
Nasal bulbar lissamine  green conjunctival staining scores  
Improvements from baseline to Day 14 were observed in a sim ilar number of study eyes with OCU  310 
and placebo and in  a smaller number of qualified fellow eyes with OCU  310 than with placebo ( 19% vs. 
34%). Improvements from baseline to Day 28 were observed in a similar number of study and qualified 
fellow eyes.  
The number of study eyes and qualified fellow eyes that deteriorated from baseline to Day 14 were 
similar between OCU  310 and placebo groups. Deterioration from baseline to Day 28 was similar 
between OCU  310 and placebo groups in qualified fellow eye s but gre ater with OCU  310 than with 
placebo at Day 28 in the study eye s (15% vs. 7%).  
CGI scale  
Responder analysis  (dichotomized)  
Although a higher percentage of CGI responders relative to Baseline was observed in the placebo arm 
at Day 14 (46% vs. 39%), the percentage was identical at Day 28 (48% vs. 48%) . The proportion of 
subjects worsening from baseline was higher in OCU  310 than in placebo at Day 14 (20% vs. 8 .1%), 
but more similar at Day 28  (13% vs. 4.8%, respectively) .

Subgroup Analysis  
This analysis  was also performed in non-improver and improver subjects  and the results are similar to 
the responder analysis. For the subgroup of non-improvers,  the percentage  of subjects with an 
improvement in CGI from Baseline to Day 14 was higher for the placebo arm (51%) than for the OCU310 
arm (39%). However, by [CONTACT_2006] 28, the percentage was identical  (48% vs. 4 8% respectively).  
SGA scale  
Responder analysis  (dichotomized)  
At Day 14  the percentage  of SGA responders  relative to Baseline was slightly higher for the placebo 
arm (45%) than for the OCU310 arm (42%). However, by [CONTACT_2006] 28, there is a higher percentage of SGA 
responders in the OCU310  arm (50%)  relative to the placebo arm (44%).  
Subgroup analysis  
This analysi s was also performed in non-improver and improver subjects  and the results are similar to 
the responder analysis. For the subgroup of non-improvers,  the percentage  of subjects with an 
improvement in SGA from Baseline to Day 14 was higher for the placebo arm ( 47%) than for the 
OCU310 arm ( 43%). However, by [CONTACT_2006] 28, there was a higher percentage of OCU310 subjects with 
improvement relative to Baseline (54%) vs. placebo (43%).    
The SANDE, VBR and SGA analys es in subgroups of subjects ( SANDE ≥60 at baseline, SANDE 
≥median at baseline, VBR ≥40 at baseline, VBR ≥50 at baseline and VBR ≥median at baseline) were also 
consistent with those obtained in the ITT set.   
Multicenter Studies  
The pooling analysis, whereby [CONTACT_41224] 6 low -enrolling si tes were combined into 1 pseudo sites, did 
not change the interpretation of the efficacy data.  
SAFETY RESULTS:  
Subjects in the two treatment groups received a similar median number of doses of study treatment in 
the OCU  310 and placebo groups; 55 doses.  
TEAEs  
Overall, a total of 40 TEAEs (39 unique TEAEs) were reported in 34 (14%) subjects. In the OCU  310 
group 27  TEAEs were reported in 18% of subjects while 12  TEAEs were reported in 8.7% subjects in 
the placebo group. The majority of TEAEs reported durin g the study  treatment  were of mild nature, and 
none were of severe nature.  There were no serious TEAEs, including TEAEs leading to death.  
As expected, the most common TEAEs were of ocular nature and were reported equally between 
groups. Amongst ocular TEAE s, those reported in >[ADDRESS_917093] in any group were dry eye, eye irritation, 
vision blurred and instillation site irritation. Among the non -ocular TEAEs, sinusitis was the only one 
reported in >[ADDRESS_917094].

Brimonidine tartrate 0.2%  
Treatment related TEAEs were reported in 9.5% of subj ects in the OCU  310 group and in 3.2% of 
subjects in the placebo group. In the OCU  310 group, treatment related TEAEs reported in > [ADDRESS_917095] 
were of ocular nature: “dry eye ” and “instillation site irritation ” (in 1.6% and 2.4% of subjects, 
respectively). In the placebo group, treatment related TEAEs were reported at most in [ADDRESS_917096].  
Notably, two treatment related ocular TEAEs of moderate intensity (PTs: lacrimation increased and eye 
irritation) in the OCU  [ADDRESS_917097] corrected visual acuity of the study eye, qualified fellow eye and non -qualified fellow 
eye were stable at all time points, with very small and similar mean changes from baseline in both 
treatment groups.  
Intraocular pressure  (IOP)  
IOP decreased from baseline in both groups at Day 14 and Day 28, with mean changes greater with 
OCU  310 than with placebo at both time points for the study eye, qualified fellow eye and non -qualified 
fellow eye. The comparison  of OCU  310 vs. placebo for change in IOP from baseline favored OCU  310 
at both Day 14 and Day 28, with estimated mean differences between the two treatments (OCU  310 - 
placebo) of -0.752  mmHg (p=  0.003) at Day  14 and -0.515  mmHg (p=  0.040) at Day 28.  Of note, no 
subject had an IOP measurement outside of the normal range.  
Ophthalmic examination  
Clinically significant abnormalities were observed for the study eye and qualified fellow eye only for the 
area “tear film” and were reported in 3 and 2 subjects in the OCU 310 and placebo groups, respectively, 
from the Baseline visit   
CONCLUSIONS :  
This study showed that OCU 310 is  generally  safe and well -tolerated, though it did not meet its co -
primary endpoints for DED symptom and sign.  Importantly , OCU 310 was better than placebo in  
reducing ocular redness , an exploratory  sign endpoint, at both Day 14 and Day 28.  In addition,  a 
numerical, but not statistical, improvement was noted at Day 28  in SGA, a n exploratory  symp tom 
endpoint, for OCU  310 relative to placebo .

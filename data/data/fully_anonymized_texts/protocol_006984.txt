local food assistance resources, and a monthly check-in from the navigator. In addition, half of the participants (n=30) will be randomly assigned to the intervention arm, and will receive economic food 
assis tance to partially meet their food needs and reduce food insecurity during the cessation attempt. We 
will assess feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and preliminary outcomes related to smoking cessation, such as the number of quit attempts lasting [ADDRESS_1137212], and acceptable to those who participate. The study findings will serve as 
the basis of future research on understanding and addressing tobacco -related and food insecurity -related 
health disparities.  Our main research question is whether addressing food insecurity specifically during a 
smoking cessation attempt is helpful for incr easing quitting success rates.

2.0   Background  
2.1 Relevant Prior Experience and Gaps in Current Knowledge 
In the U.S., the existence of socioeconomic disparities in tobacco use is a widely known public health 
problem.1 Of the numerous factors that account for socioeconomic disparities in smoking, one major 
reason is due to disparities in successful quitting. That is, regardless of socioeconomic background, the majority of smokers are interested in quitting (68%), and ov er half (55%) report making at least one [ADDRESS_1137213] populations with disadvantage. Food insecurity occurs when there is lack of access at all times to enough food for an active, 
healthy life.
4 In 2019, 35% of households living below the federal poverty level (FPL) experienced food 
insecurity, compared to 5% of households above 185% of FPL.4 Food insecurity is also significantly higher 
among racial/ethnic minority households, female-headed households, and households with children.4 Food 
insecurity is an important social determinant of health that is independently predictive of a  range of chronic 
disease outcomes5, influencing health behaviors related to chronic diseases (such as medication adherence, 
diet quality, eating behaviors, and substance use). As such, food insecurity’s effects on health behaviors are most widely consider ed within specific chronic diseases that are diet -sensitive (such as diabetes, 
hypertension, and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]), or are transmitted through risky behaviors especially among vulnerable populations (such as people living with HIV). Beyond behaviors within s pecific chronic diseases, food 
insecurity has also been linked with tobacco smoking behavior.
6 Food insecurity is known to increase the 
odds of current smoking, independent of poverty and other socioeconomic indicators7, as well as mental 
health characteri stics that increase likelihood of smoking.6  
A growing body of research has suggested a bidirectional and mutually reinforcing relationship between 
food insecurity and tobacco use.6 Food insecurity is conceptualized to pose a unique barrier to quitting8,9 
due to factors such as psychological stress from food insecurity and appetite regulation from nicotine. In 
turn, however, tobacco- related expenditures can compete with household spending (a phenomenon 
known as smoking -induced deprivation10) to exacerbate f ood insecurity. While the body of research 
suggests that addressing food insecurity could enhance cessation outcomes, this has not been formally 
tested to our knowledge. That is, such findings on food insecurity and smoking cessation are drawn mainly 
throu gh epi[INVESTIGATOR_820504] a nationally representative sample of smokers over time8, or 
cross -sectional studies estimating the quit ratio9 (i.e., the proportion of former smokers among ever 
smokers). In order to examine food insecurity’s potential effects on the cessation process and outcomes, 
and whether addressing food insecurity results in more favorable cessation outcomes, there is a need to conduct more rigorous clinical and intervention -based studies.  
2.3 Scientific Rationale and Significance 
This proposal is significant for smoking cessation research because there are relatively few evidence -based 
cessation interventions that seek to address the role of socioeconomic stress (such as food insecurity) to improve cessation outcomes. This propos al is also significant for food security research. With food insecurity’s wide- ranging 
adverse impacts on chronic disease and health outcomes, food insecurity has been estimated to contribute $77.[ADDRESS_1137214] food security evidence review by [CONTACT_820508] (the 
largest hunger relief organization in the U.S.) included smoking as a known factor that increases the risk of food insecurity

This is done on a monthly basis for 3 months, at a maximum of $250, divided across 3 months. 
 
5.0   Procedures Involved  
5.1 Study Design (Overview) 
For most participants, the full length of participation is about 2.5- 3 hours spread across 13 weeks 
(intervention is 12 weeks, and an additional week is included as pre -intervention baseline). For a small 
proportion of participants (n=8- 10) who agree to pa rticipate in an end -of-study qualitative interview to 
share their experiences of the study, the full length of participation is about 2.5- 3.[ADDRESS_1137216] and eligibility, answer participant

5.2 Detailed Description of Procedures 
POTENTIAL PARTICIPANT IDENTIFICA TION: We will use the electronic health record (EHR) to prescreen 
potential participants for this study. Potential participants will comprise of current patients MetroHealth 
patients from a total of 7 MetroHealth sites within Cuyahoga county. We will use t he EHR to prescreen for 
age (21 years or older), smoking status as documented in the EHR (documented as currently smoking), and 
food insecurity status (documented as food insecure based on social determinants of health screening 
conducted during the most r ecent visit). Using this list, we will send out a recruitment packet in the mail, 
consisting of a [ADDRESS_1137221] the study 
team by [CONTACT_820511], and to see if they qualify. 
As needed and based on recruitment rate, the research team will also make telephone calls to follow -up 
with potential participants, after having sent recruitment letters (i.e., there is no “cold” calling without 
sending letters beforehand). Using the prescreened list of individuals, we will randomly follow up with 
individuals on the list until we reach the enrollment target for the wave (n=[ADDRESS_1137222]; 3 -4 
enrollment waves; 60 participants in total will be recruited for this study).  
RECRUITMENT, CONSENT, and BASELINE SURVEY: Recruitment will be conducted by [CONTACT_756], and there 
will be no face -to-face visits as part of thi s study. The study coordinator will use a script to inform 
participants about the research study being conducted, to assess interest in participating, and to conduct an eligibility screening for interested participants. Individuals will be informed prior t o the eligibility 
screening that not all people who are interested will qualify for the study based pre -determined eligibility 
criteria. For those who are interested, meet eligibility criteria, and wish to participate, the coordinator will 
go over the cons ent form, give the opportunity to ask any questions, and after all questions have been 
addressed, will collect verbal consent. Verbal consent will be documented on REDCap, including an attestation section from the research coordinator collecting consent. All potential participants will have 
been mailed a hard copy of the consent form (non -return cover memo) at the recruitment phase. 
Participants can be sent another copy as needed. After the research team receives verbal consent, the baseline assessment will  be conducted by [CONTACT_820512] 
(based on participants' preference) that is expected to last up to 45 minutes.  
RANDOMIZATION, ALLOCATION: After the baseline telephone (or online) survey is completed, participants 
will be randomized in the Intervention arm or the Control arm with a 50/[ADDRESS_1137223] with participants will use a computer -generated random 
number table to assign participants. In either ar m, in Week 1 of the study, all participants will be connected 
to receive usual care for tobacco cessation, based on their preferences. In either arm, the study navigator 
(a community health worker) will review participant responses from the baseline teleph one survey and 
reach out to all participants by [CONTACT_756]. This conversation may involve referrals to the tobacco quitline, referrals to counseling/classes offered at MetroHealth or in the community (such as Freedom from Smoking 
classes), nicotine replacem ent therapy and/or pharmacotherapy as prescribed by [CONTACT_663352]. The study navigator will provide linkages and information to the services available to the participant, which will be documented in a semi-structured call log, and used as the basis of following up on 
use of tobacco cessation services in subsequent telephone check -ins in Week [ADDRESS_1137224] of food pantries and community meal sites and eligibility 
information about federal food assistance programs. Provision of this information will also be documented by a semi -structured call log, and will be used as the basis of following up on fo od assistance resources in 
subsequent check- ins in Week 4 and Week 8. Information about tobacco cessation and food assistance 
resources are provided by [CONTACT_18623]/or in writing, which is within the scope of work for a community health worker.  
7 
 
In the Intervention arm only, participants will receive economic food assistance to meet their individual 
food and grocery needs during the cessation attempt/study period. This is provided on a monthly basis (3 
times during the 12 weeks of the study) during Week 1, Week 5, and Week 9.  
Participants in the Intervention arm will be provided $83 per month (for a total of $250 for the 12 weeks) to 
partially support the cost of food (i.e., provide short- term food insecurity relief) during the cessation 
attempt. These fund s will be in the form of VISA gift cards, a check, a direct deposit transaction, or a Zelle 
transaction, depending on the participant’s choosing. The check, direct deposit, and Zelle options are 
processed through PNC Bank’s E- payment system. We are NOT col lecting any bank information from the 
participants. The participant will confirm their bank account information with PNC to deposit the funds or 
mail the check, but the researchers will not see that information. 
Follow -ups: About [ADDRESS_1137225] a general check- in call 
with all participants by [CONTACT_820513] -up on referrals provided and additional referrals needed. The 
length of the call is anticipated to be 15 minutes. The content/topi[INVESTIGATOR_820505].  
About [ADDRESS_1137226] a general check -in call with all 
participants by [CONTACT_820513]- up on referrals provided and additional referrals needed. The length of 
the call is anticipated to be 15 minutes. The content/topi[INVESTIGATOR_820506]. Twelve weeks after randomization (end- of-study), the study coordinator will contact [CONTACT_820514] -up telephone  or online REDCap survey, which is expected to last 30 -45 minutes.  
END -OF-STUDY QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS: Participants who were randomized to the intervention group 
and have completed the protocol will be invited to participate in an end -of-study qualitative interview to 
provide more context about food access, and to share their experiences with the intervention. 
Recruitment : Similar to the recruitment procedures for the overall study, we will first mail an invitation 
letter to prior participants, who can contact [CONTACT_820515] a telephone interview. As needed, we will 
follow up with a telephone call to the target subsample of participants who were sent invitation letters. Consent : Verbal consent will be documented on REDCap, including an attestation section from the r esearch 
staff member collecting consent. All potential participants will have been mailed a hard copy of the consent form (non -return cover memo) with their invitation letter. Qualitative interviews : Semi -structured, one- on-
one interviews will be conducted  by [CONTACT_820516], and is expected to last 30- 45 minutes. The semi -
structured interview will ask questions related to participants’ food shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_820507], and 
participants’ perceptions about the impact of the economic intervention.  
 
5.3 Risk Minimization Procedures and Data Collection Materials 
To minimize risks related to annoyance or discomfort over study -related assessments (i.e., surveys and 
check -in calls with the study navigator), we will inform all potential participants that assess ments may ask 
personal questions, and the estimated duration of the assessments. Participants have the option to skip 
any question that they do not wish to answer in the surveys. To minimize risks related to potential breach 
of confidentiality of research participants, we will use secure research systems, namely REDCap, for store 
any research -related information. To minimize any unforeseeable economic risks (e.g., potential theft of 
the VISA gift cards), we will ask all participants to keep their participat ion in this study private (such as not 
posting on social media about participation).  All data collection materials include an Eligibility Script, a 
Baseline/Follow -up Survey, a Call Log, and a Qualitative Interview Document. All of these sources are 
attach ed in the IRB submission.

5.4 Type of Data Collected and How Data is Obtained 
We are collecting both existing and prospective data. Existing data are collected using electronic health 
records to ascertain potential participants' age, smoking status, and fo od insecurity screening status. 
Prospective data are obtained through a baseline and 12 -week follow -up survey, collected through REDCap 
(survey -administered telephone survey, or self -completed survey), and through semi- structured telephone 
call logs kept b y the study navigator.  
For end -of-study qualitative interviews, the interviews will be audio -recorded and transcribed verbatim.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1137227] ionnaire, by [CONTACT_23164]. Prior 
to administering the eligibility questions, all potential participants will be notified that there are specific 
inclusion criteria for the study, and not everyone will qualify for the study. Potential participants will be 
notified after the end of the screening questionnaire whether they are eligible or ineligible based on their 
responses. In some cases, it is possible that eligibility may not be readily apparent. In those cases, potential 
participants will be in formed that their responses will be reviewed by [CONTACT_9154], and they will be 
followed up in the next few days.  
6.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion:  
• Aged 21 or older  
• Current tobacco smoker, defined as having smoked daily over the past 7 days  
• Willing to make a serious quit attempt in the next 30 days (“Yes” to “In the next [ADDRESS_1137228] 24 hours?”)  
• Considered food insecure, based on past 30- day screening using the [ADDRESS_1137229] 30 days  
• A reliable telephone number and a local mailing address where participant can be reached during the duration of the study  
 
Exclusion:  
• Aged 20 or younger  
• Non -smoker, or a current tobacco smoker who did not smoke daily over the past 7 days  
• Not interested in quitting at this time, assessed by [CONTACT_820517] a serious quit attempt in 
the next 30 days (“No” to “In the next [ADDRESS_1137230] 24 
hours?”)  
• Did not recently experience food insecurity, based on past 30- day screening using the [ADDRESS_1137231] 30 days 
• Does not have a reliable telephone number and a local mailing address  where participant can be 
reached during the duration of the study  
 
[ADDRESS_1137232] (EHR) to prescreen potential participants for this study. Potential 
participants will comprise of current MetroHealth patients from a total of 7 MetroHealth sites within 
Cuyahoga county. We will use the EHR to prescreen for age (21 years or older), smoking status as 
documented in the EHR (documented as currently smoking), and food insecurity status (documented as 
food insecure based on social determinants of health screening conducted during the most recent visit). Using this list, we will send out a recruitment packet in the mail, con sisting of a [ADDRESS_1137233] the study team by [CONTACT_820518] e study, and to see if they qualify. 
As needed and based on recruitment rate, the research team will also make telephone calls to follow -up 
with potential participants, after having sent recruitment letters (i.e., there is no “cold” calling without 
sending  letters beforehand). Using the prescreened list of individuals, we will randomly follow up with 
individuals on the list until we reach the enrollment target for the wave (n=[ADDRESS_1137234]; 3 -4 
enrollment waves; 60 participants in total will be recruited for this study).  
To identify potential participants for the end -of-study qualitative interviews, we will attempt to contact [CONTACT_820519].   
 
7.[ADDRESS_1137235] an eligibility 
screening for interested participants.  
To recruit potential participants for the end -of-study qualitative interviews, we will send an invitation letter and a 
separate informed consent form as a non -return co ver memo.  
 
7.5 Amount and Timing of Participant Payments 
Participants can receive up to $105 for participation in the research study, specifically for their time in 
completing the baseline telephone survey ($20) and the 12 -week telephone survey ($35, as increased 
incentive to complete the follow -up survey), and the post-intervention qualitative interview ($50, as 
increased incentive to participate in the interview). These will be paid as a separate VISA gift card each time 
the participant completes the su rvey, and will be sent by [CONTACT_2319]. 
10 
 
8.0   Withdrawal of Participants  
Participants will be removed from the study for any significant medical events, such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
any significant legal events, such as incarceration. Participant non- compliance wi th research can also be a 
reason for removing a participant from the study.  
 
9.0   Risks to Participants  
Breach of confidentiality is a potential risk associated with this study; however, this risk will be minimized via secure storage of the records. Feeli ng uncomfortable answering questions is a potential risk for this study; 
however, this risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_820520].  
 
10.[ADDRESS_1137236] with a study navigator who can provide them with useful/relevant information and referrals for 
tobacco cessation and food assistance.  
For participants in the intervention group, a potential benefit of participating in the research is that they 
may experience short -term relief from food insecurity while they are undergoing a smoking cessation 
attempt.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_1137237] t -
tests and chi -square tests to explore group differences. Feasibility will be ass essed by [CONTACT_820521], percent eligible to participate, refusal rate, and attrition rate between 
baseline and 12- week follow -up. We will examine participants’ utilization of resources related to tobacco 
cessation and food a ssistance, to examine feasibility of the navigation model. We will gain feedback from 
the navigator regarding the process of providing referrals and individualized food assistance. We will 
evaluate acceptability through open -ended questions to elicit parti cipant feedback regarding their 
perceptions of helpfulness of food assistance in meeting food needs, helpfulness of food assistance 
specifically during cessation attempt, and additional barriers and facilitators to making a quit attempt or staying quit.  
Qualitative interviews will be transcribed and analyzed using inductive and deductive coding process.  
11.1 Data Handling and Security  
The records for this study are all electronic. No information will be stored in paper files. We are using 
MetroHealth’s RED Cap to store all of our data. Audio -recordings of qualitative interviews will be kept in the 
REDCap file repository until they are transcribed verbatim, removing any identifying information in the transcription process. After that, we will destroy the audio files, and store interview transcript data as a text 
file. Only authorized personnel assigned to the study will have access to the study on REDCap. All personnel are affiliated with MetroHealth.  
We will keep records for [ADDRESS_1137238] prior to providing their verbal consent by [CONTACT_756]. The eligibility screening and study information process will explicitly mention 
that pote ntial participants should discuss the study with their family or friends before consenting, should 
they wish to take their time in deciding. The study coordinator will answer participant questions, and will 
defer any questions that the coordinator cannot answer to the investigators . 
We will use the same consent process for the qualitative interviews.  
12.1   Process to Document Consent in Writing  
Potential participants  will be told about the study and its risks and benefits, and if interested, will be 
conse nted. Participants  will be given a copy of a non -return cover memo, which can be found in the local 
sites documents portion of this IRB application. The date and time of consent will be recorded, as well as the name [CONTACT_820522]. The personnel will provide an electronic signature [CONTACT_820523].

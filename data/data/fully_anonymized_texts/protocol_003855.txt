to the research as described in the attached materials. As a reminder, it is your 
responsibility to submit any proposed changes for IRB review and approval prior to 
implementation. 
 
Amendment Description: 
 Separated inclusion and exclusion crite ria for patients who are eligible and 
interested in having biopsies  vs. patients who are ineligible due to timeline or are not 
within the biopsy window. 
 Revised the pre-operative study timeline from -6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) to -8 weeks to –
1 week. 
 Revised the informed consent to reflect the timeline requirements and option to 
participate in biopsies, as well as the option to participate in the study in the 
timeline for biopsies is too short (<4 weeks from date of surgery). 
 Revised the Research Plan and consent form accordingly. 
 
For this research, the following determinations have been made:

1. Give a brief description of the proposed change(s).  
Separation of inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients who are eligible and interested in having biopsies vs. patients 
who are ineligible due to timeline, or are not within biopsy window.  We have separated the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
into two cat egories: Biopsy participant and non -biopsy participant.  
 
The pre -operative study timeline has been updated from -6 weeks (+/ - 2 weeks) to -[ADDRESS_486162] the timeline requirements and option to participate in biopsies, as 
well as option to participate in the study if the timeline for the biopsies is too short (< 4 weeks from date of surgery).  
 
Last, the final consent page in the informed consent document has separated two of the existing bullets into two 
separate bullets for clarity.   
2. Describe the rationale for the change(s).  
The current protocol allows for patient to opt in or out of biopsies. However, the inclusion and exclusion criteria are structured to account for risks associated with biopi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. We have divided out the inclusion and exclusion criteria to Purpose:   This application is designed to help facilitate review of changes to an existing protocol and to assure compliance of the 
federal regulations as set forth in 45 CFR Part 46 .

Application - Amendment  
V – 04/20/[ADDRESS_486163] patients who are opting in and/or eligible for biopsy consideration versus patients who opt out, or due to timeline, are not eligible for biopsies.  
 
Timeline: Patients who are less than 4 weeks from the date of surgery are not eligible for biopsies, but could be 
included in study and not undergo any biopsies.  
 
Biopsy risk: Patients who are timeline eligible (more than 4 weeks from date of surgery) and opt to have biopsies 
performed, need to be evaluated for bleeding risk associated with taking an oral blood thinner medication. The current 
exclusion criteria excludes patients taking oral blood thinners. Patients who choose not to participate in the biopsies or 
who are not within study window for biospi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (ineligible for biospi[INVESTIGATOR_387818] ) can still 
enroll in the study, but do not need to be evaluated for bleeding risk secondary to taking oral blood thinners.

January 2019   Page | [ADDRESS_486168] SUMMARY  
As a function of our growing population of older adults, an estimated 3.48 million total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA) procedures will be performed annually in the U.S. by 2030. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_387828] -universal 
success of this surgery in mitigating chronic knee pain, TKA is not successful in restoring long -term 
physical function in older adults, primarily because of quadriceps muscle atrophy, which explains 77% of 
the strength deficits. Overall, strength and functional mobility in TKA patients is 30 -50% below age -
match ed healthy controls. Functional tasks such as stair -climbing, which is considered a high fall -risk 
activity, remain a clinical problem for 75% of patients following TKA. Muscle atrophy occurs in both 
operative and non -operative legs, and is essentially permanent for older patients because their ability to 
increase muscle mass is significantly impaired. Thus, safe and effective treatments to prevent muscle 
loss and preserve strength are urgently needed and clinically meaningful, as they have the potential to  
significantly impact the quality of life for millions of older adults.  
 
The purpose of the proposed clinical research is to determine the effects of essential amino acid (EAA) 
supplementation on muscle mass, strength, and functional mobility following TK A in older adults. Our 
hypothesis , based on strong preliminary data, is that twice -daily ingestion of 20 g of EAA (Aim 1) and 23 
g of EAA  (Aim 2)  for one week before through six weeks after TKA will increase basal rates of muscle 
protein synthesis via inac tivation of catabolic signaling, and up -regulation of anabolic and cyto -
protective proteins. We further hypothesize that short -term atrophy prevention and accelerated return 
of functional mobility will lead to longer -term structural and functional adaptati ons, and improved 
quality of life in older TKA patients vs. Placebo. The rationale for the proposed research is that effective

November 2018  INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
In the coming decades, the d emand for primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in the U.S. is projected to 
increase 673% to 3.4 million surgeries performed annually. TKA surgery is primarily performed on older 
adults and results in significant muscle atrophy in the operative and non -operative thigh (quadriceps 
and hamstrings), which compromises balance, impairs functional mobility, and dramatically increases 
the risk of falls and related injuries. For older adults, muscle atrophy occurring during periods of 
inactivity or following surgery may be more difficult to recover.  
 
Age-associated muscle dysfunction results from reduced muscle mass, strength, and functional capacity 
(i.e., sarcopenia) (38). Sarcopenia occurs with normal healthy aging and is associated with an elevated 
risk for falls, physical disability, and loss of independence (105, 106). Estimated healthcare costs due to 
sarcopenia in the U.S. in 2000 was $18.5 billion (60). Reducing the prevalence of sarcopenia by 10% can 
save $1.1 billion/year in healthcare costs (60). While sarcopenia progresses at a rate of 1%/year in 
healthy older males and females, surgeries such as hip and knee replacement, will accelerate sarcopenia 
(99). The projected increase (nearly 7 -fold) in the number of TKA to be performed annually in the U.S. in 
the coming decades will place a significant burden on our healthcare infrastructure, Medicare and 
Medicaid. The studies in this research plan are significant because they specifically address a major 
clinical barrier by [CONTACT_387886] -operative muscle loss  that translates directly into improved strength 
and functional mobility in older adults. Accelerating functional mobility will help to alleviate a significant 
economic burden by [CONTACT_387887], shortening time in clinical care, and halting the 
acceleration of sarcopenia.  
 
While evidence exists linking EAA to anabolic and catabolic regulation of muscle cell metabolism in 
healthy subjects (87 -89), there is a dearth of experimental data investigating mechanistic adaptations 
that prevent muscle atrophy and restore function in T KA patients. It is known that EAA stimulates an 
acute  anabolic response in muscle by [CONTACT_387888]1 pathway and increasing fractional rates of 
protein synthesis (i.e., FSR) (50), and that chronic  EAA supplementation elevates fasting rates of muscle 
protein synthesis in older healthy adults (29). However, studies conducted in healthy populations tell us 
very little about how muscle cell metabolism is altered following major surgery and if EAA 
supplementation causes an increase in basal rates of muscle  protein synthesis and/or attenuate 
breakdown. Further, mechanisms linking atrophy prevention with positive functional adaptations in a 
clinical setting are lacking.  
 
Recent reports demonstrate that changes in fat oxidation in human primary myocytes paral lel whole 
body metabolism of the donor (115). In other words, primary cells isolated from human subjects, which 
were allowed to expand and become myocytes and subjected to experiments to measure metabolism, 
revealed that myocyte metabolism were similar to host metabolism. This suggests that normally 
dormant satellite cells (primary cells) residing in muscle tissue recapi[INVESTIGATOR_387830]. Further, others have shown that satellite cells from older animals have reduced 
regenerative capacity as compared to young animals (25), however, when the blood from young mice is 
mixed with blood of older mice (heterochronic parabiosis) regenerative capacity in older muscles is 
restored (19, 26). In addition, altering defective signaling pathways in older satellite cells has the ability 
to normalize their regenerative response to injury (21, 25, 26). While these reports show that the 
satellite cell microenvironment plays an important role in regeneration a recent report from the Blau la b 
demonstrate that satellite cells from aged animals have inherent defects in their ability to respond 
appropriately to muscle tissue injury (27). From these reports we may conclude that satellite cells have 
metabolic and regenerative characteristics that relate back to the health status and age of the donor. 
Furthermore, these are important consideration to take into account when interpreting results from

January 2019   Page | 5  clinical trials evaluating the response(s) of muscle tissue(s), and, more importantly, functional mobi lity, 
in older adults.  
 
Recent experiments performed on C2C12 myotubes have demonstrated that following incubation with 
essential amino acids (EAA) anabolic pathways are upregulated (9), which is similar to the anabolic 
response measured in muscle cells o btained from healthy young adults after in bolus ingestion (50). 
Interestingly, we have shown that older adults demonstrate a diminished anabolic response to EAA 
ingestion relative to younger subjects (41) that is dose dependent (28) and appears to be sens itive to 
Leucine concentration (63). Interestingly, a recent report from Farup and colleagues (45) showed that 
subjects supplemented with Whey protein before and after an eccentric contraction protocol 
demonstrated significantly greater expansion of their satellite cell pool vs. placebo subjects, which is 
important because Whey supplement has higher concentrations of EAAs and is absorbed quickly relative 
to intact protein (steak) (95 -97). Thus, it appears that EAA supplementation may be acting on muscle 
tissue by [CONTACT_387889]/or catabolism. 
Lastly, recent work from Joshi and colleagues (61) provide methods for assessment of in vitro model of 
ischemia using myotubes that may be used to isolate pathways that are up and/or downregulated 
response to ischemia -reperfusion injury. Assimilated, the above information suggest that primary cells 
isolated from humans of different ages (young vs. old) and varying health status (metabolic) may, under 
certain  experimental conditions, provide valuable insight into donor muscle response(s).  
 
Preventing muscle atrophy and weakness is clinically significant because it leads to immediate and 
tangible improvements in functional mobility in the short term, which may  lead to positive changes in 
longer -term muscle cell structural and functional adaptations that will improve quality of life for older 
patients following TKA. Quadriceps weakness inhibits balance (84), reduces functional mobility (20, 82), 
and increases the risk of falls (83). Muscle atrophy increases the prevalence of physical disability (103) 
and accelerates the progression of sarcopenia (99). Tests of functional mobility consistently 
demonstrate marginal improvements following TKA surgery (47, 92, 123). Functional tasks such as stair -
climbing, which is considered a high fall -risk activity, remains a clinical problem for 75% of patients 
following TKA (92). A recent report suggests that early post -operative function may predict the speed of 
functional recovery and the overall success of rehabilitation (64). Evidence suggests that acute weakness 
in the non -operative limb following TKA is related to poorer functional outcomes in the long -term (126), 
and maintaining greater muscle volume in the operative leg is  essential to maximize muscle strength 
(79, 80) and attenuate the acceleration of sarcopenia (99). Studies show that, after a peak in functional 
recovery at 6 months, there is an acceleration of functional decline due to quadriceps weakness that 
outpaces n ormal ‘aging’ that is not attributable to lack of range of motion or pain (81, 82, 98, 125). 
Reports suggest a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and aging (2), which is exacerbated by 
[CONTACT_163151] (5). Preserving muscle volume and cellular function is e ssential to improve strength and 
accelerate functional mobility, which we hypothesize will lead to positive structural and functional 
adaptations in muscle cells at [ADDRESS_486169] -TKA (79, 80).  
 
Preliminary Studies.  
Biochemistry.  Recent studies in the Drey er Laboratory have generated exciting preliminary results 
showing essential amino acid (EAA) supplementation attenuates quadriceps atrophy and accelerates the 
return of functional mobility following TKA (37). For patients on EAA, quadriceps atrophy was onl y -6% & 
-3% in the operative and non -operative quadriceps, respectively, six weeks after TKA but -18% & -10%, 
respectively, in patients on Placebo (a 3 -fold difference). Of clinical relevance, these patients on EAA 
were able to maintain strength and demons trated an accelerated return of functional mobility vs.

(ATF4) expression vs. Placebo. While studies by [CONTACT_387890] (IGF -I) and vascular endothelial growth factor  (VEGF) (i.e., angiogenesis) pathways, 
whether they are directly stimulated by [CONTACT_387891] a clinical population remains unknown. 
We interpret these positive changes at the cellular level to be responsible for the reduction in muscle 
loss and, p reservation of strength, and explain the acceleration of the return of functional mobility.  
 
Our preliminary fractional synthesis data (FSR) show that older adults respond appropriately to acute 
ingestion of 20 g of EAA (i.e., similar response to young healthy controls). We also have preliminary FSR 
data showing that basal rates of muscle protein synthesis are similar between TKA patients (0.0563 ± 
0.008%/h our) and older healthy control subjects (0.0566 ± 0.008%/h our). What is not known is what 
effect TKA h as on muscle protein synthesis and breakdown in response to chronic EAA supplementation 
(for [ADDRESS_486171] -TKA). We have extensive experience with stable isotope tracer 
methods to determine fractional synthesis rates (FSR), a direct  measure of muscle protein synthesis (31 -
35, 39 -41, 50, 113, 114). However, in order to determine mechanisms, and link cellular changes in 
anabolic and catabolic pathways with atrophy (Placebo) and atrophy prevention (EAA) we must also 
quantify muscle protein breakdown.  
 
Our preliminary results show that EAA phosphorylates (inactivates) a primary regulator of muscle 
protein catabolism (FoxO3a). As well, EAA supplementation stimulated the expression of the anabolic 
amino acid transporter, which has gained attention due to its ability to act as both a transporter and 
signaling protein linked to the IGF -I signaling pathway (54, 102). Interestingly, we also measured an up -
regulation of the transcription factor ATF4, which has been shown to stimulate the express ion of amino 
acid transporters and promote protein anabolism (76). In vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that 
IGF-I treatment increased REDD1 expression in muscle (49), and recent studies have shown that REDD1 
confers cyto -protective effects by [CONTACT_387892] (22, 120). REDD1 is upregulated by [CONTACT_387893]4 (49, 76, 
122). ATF4 is increased in the presence of insulin (4) and IGF -I (49), and plays an important role in 
mediating the effects of VEGF on cell growth and survival (3, 75, 93). Thus, ATF4 may b e necessary for 
amino acid and protein anabolism (4). We have preliminary data showing that REDD1 expression is 
elevated with EAA. This is important because our preliminary results support mechanisms of action by 
[CONTACT_387894] -regulate amino acid transporters via ATF4 that have implications for muscle protein 
metabolism (76). We interpret these results as supporting a mechanistic role in atrophy prevention.  
 
Physiology.   Immobilization following orthopedic surgery accelerates sarcopenia (99). For example, 
1%/year = normal sarcopenia progression, but in our TKA patients, sarcopenia was accelerated by +18 
and +10 y ears, in the operative and n on-operative leg, respectively . However, in patients randomized to 
EAA, progression was only +6 and +[ADDRESS_486172] -operative 
quadriceps weakness in the non -operative leg is directly linked to poorer long -term functional out comes 
(126).   
 
Quadriceps weakness results from both muscle atrophy and neural activation deficits (80, 107). In the 
longer term however, strength deficits are due to persistent muscle atrophy, explaining 77% of the 
quadriceps strength deficits 1 y ear pos t-TKA (80). Our preliminary data show that EAA supplem entation 
reduces strength loss  and accelerates the  return of functional mobility . Persistent quadriceps atrophy 
and weakness have profound effects on functional mobility and activities of daily living ( 13, 107, 119). It

up-and-go, stair -climb down [descent] ability and ambulation).  
We also have compelling preliminary data showing that Type II muscle  cell cross -sectional area (CSA) is 
reduced (atrophied) comp ared to controls following TKA . We expect to show that CSA increase 
(normalize to that of the non -operative side) in the EAA group. As well, we have preliminary data from

Contribution to Scientific Knowledge.  
Muscle atrophy occurs  in cancer cachexia (12), chronic heart failure (8), chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (70), HIV -AIDS (121, 124), renal failure (66), rheumatoid arthritis (71, 77), osteoarthritis (116), 
burn injury (18), following total hip and knee arthroplasty (58),  ACL reconstruction (57), and during bed 
rest (94). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_387831]. As such, our R01 proposal is significant because it has broad clinical appeal 
as a high yield therapy to attenuate atrophy under a variety of clinical conditions (EAA are well 
tolerated, easily digested, and immediately available).  
 
The significance of this Research Plan also centers on our use of TKA as a model system for the study  of 
muscle atrophy (Placebo) and atrophy prevention (EAA), which are due to an imbalance between 
anabolic and catabolic alterations at the molecular and cellular level. Our study will advance knowledge 
of the molecular and functional changes that are occurring during muscle atrophy and prevention in 
older males and females, and will identify additional novel targets for therapeutic interventions.  
 
Our study  is innovative for several reasons. Foremost is our translational approach which will allow us to 
identify novel molecular regulators of muscle atrophy (Placebo) and atrophy prevention (EAA). Using 
isotopi[INVESTIGATOR_387832], and 
link those results with changes in muscle volume, strength and functional mobility. We will also 
determine the degree to which short -term preservation of muscle volume, strength and function 
translate into longe r-term structural and functional (mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]) adaptations at the 
cellular level. Our plan to explore potential sex differences in the age -related changes in muscle protein 
synthesis and breakdown following TKA and the mechanistic effects of EAA on muscle metabolism, 
atrophy, and mobility is exciting. Finally, this research plan brings together a clinical and translational 
research team to investigate the biochemistry and physiology of muscle atrophy and incorporates 
functional measures of mob ility and quality of life in a unique and meaningful way.  
 
The primary innovation is our integration of cellular and molecular methods with measures of muscle 
protein synthesis and breakdown, volume, and functional mobility in order to better understand h ow 
muscle atrophy can be prevented in a clinical setting(s). Our protocol will be freely available to clinicians, 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and researchers interested in mitigating muscle atrophy, which may profoundly affect the 
medical/rehabilitation field as the use o f EAA in atrophy prevention spreads and gains momentum.

November 2018  Hypothesis.  
The working hypothesis, based on strong preliminary results, is that twice -daily ingestion of 20 g of EAA 
for 1 week before and 6 weeks after TKA, will increase basal rates of muscle protein synthesis via 
inactivation of catabolic signaling (FoxO3a), and up -regulation of anabolic (SLC36A2, IGF -I & VEGF) and 
cyto -protective proteins (ATF4 & REDD1). We further propose that short -term atrophy prevention and 
accelerated return of functional mobility will translate into long -term ([ADDRESS_486173] -TKA) structural 
(cross -sectional area, CSA) and functional (mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) adaptations , leading to improved 
quality of life in TKA patients vs. Placebo  in older men and women . 
 
SPECIFIC AIMS  
To test our hypothesis our Research Plan  proposes scientifically rigorous methods designed to achieve 
the following specific aims:  
 
 Specific Aim #1  (Biochemistry) :  Determine if EAA elevates basal rates of muscle protein 
synthesis by [CONTACT_25764] -regulating anabolic pathways & cyto -protective proteins, and inactivating 
catabolic pathways in the short -term vs. Placebo.  
 
Identifying molecular pathways that are up -regulated by [CONTACT_387895]. Successful completion of the proposed research will determine 
the degree to which EAA elevate basal rates of muscle protein synthesis  and the extent to which 
these changes coincide with increases in anabolic (SLC36A2, IGF -I, & VEGF) and cyto -protective 
(ATF4 & REDD1) pathways. As well, completion of Aim 1 will allow us to determine changes in 
muscle protein breakdown in parallel with changes in catabolic (FoxO3a) proteins (Fig. 3). We 
expect these findings will provide mechanistic data on the effects of EAA on muscle cell 
metabolism and signaling that will help explain how muscle atrophy is prevented and functional 
mobility accelerated f ollowing TKA.  
 
To accomplish Specific Aim #1, subjects will be enrolled pre -operatively and asked to participate 
in a number of study -related activities designed to isolate the effect of EAA supplementation on 
muscle protein synthesis. Subjects will consume “heavy water” to aid in quantifying chronic 
muscle protein synthesis rates while consuming the study EAA supplement. Study specific blood 
draws, muscle imaging (via MRI) and muscle biopsies will be assessed at regular intervals. 
Patients will capture accelerometer data and complete three -day food diaries, as well as patient 
reported outcome measures designed to capture health -related quality of life, knee -specific 
functioning, pain and the degree to which the patient has an ability engage in total joint pre- 
and post -operative care. Finally, functional testing will capture patient strength and functional 
capabilities pre - and post -operatively.

functional mobility leads to positive changes in muscle cell structure and function, and quality 
of life in the long term ([ADDRESS_486175] -TKA) vs. Placebo.  
Successful completion of Aim [ADDRESS_486176] -TKA was effective in preventing significant muscle atrophy (37). 
However, our preliminary data suggest that in the EAA grou p, atrophy at [ADDRESS_486177] -TKA was 
half that at 6 weeks in the operative quadriceps and hamstrings. This potential ‘catch -up’ muscle 
loss was not observed in the non -operative leg within the EAA group but was identical to the 
change from [ADDRESS_486178] -TKA in order to maximally prevent 
bilateral muscle atrophy.  
 
The proposed research design will answer the following questions:  
2.1 Does EAA  prevent short -term ( [ADDRESS_486179] -TKA) bilateral muscle atrophy, preserve 
quadriceps strength, and accelerate the return of functional mobility vs. Placebo?  
2.2  Are there short -term sex differences on the above outcome measures?

Placebo?

quality of life vs. Placebo?

Recent results from the Phillips group ( 128) demonstrated that free -living older males taking 5 grams 
of Leucine with each meal (3x/day for 3 days), placed on either a low - (RDA; 0.8g protein/kg/day) or high - 
(1.2g protein/kg/day) protein diet, had elevated basal and post -exercise myofibrillar protein synthesis vs. 
the same individuals on the same diets (low or high) without supplemental Leucine. Subjects on low -
protein and hi gh-protein diets supplemented with 5g of Leucine were not different from one another in 
this study. The finding has direct implications for our patients who eat less after surgery ( 37). Data for the

autophagy, which can be stimulated by [CONTACT_218525]1, which is activated by [CONTACT_387899] ( 129).

Primary Biochemical Outcome Measures.   
To answer our study questions will be answered using an in vivo experimental design . The procedure 
schedule can be referenced in Figure 1 (page 17, following a description of all study -related 
procedures and measures for Aim #1).  
 
Deuterium Oxide  Ingestion Followed by [CONTACT_387903] . Deuterium oxide (D 2O, i.e., heavy water) will 
be used to quantify chronic (days) muscle protein synthesis rates. D20 will be ingested (50 ml) three 
times per day for 7 days leading up to TKA. During TKA surgery, a single biopsy will be obtained in the OR 
from each leg. Beginning on POD#[ADDRESS_486192] a total of two 
biopsies from each leg, in a fasting state. This will allow us to deter mine the independent effects of 
supplementation on rates of muscle protein synthesis  and breakdown  (2H20) during the acute and sub -
acute period.  
 
Measures include structural (CSA of cell and extracellular matrix) and functional (mitochondrial 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] & inflammatory cell infiltration) determination. Muscle cell structure (CSA) and function 
(mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) will be determined based on percent change from baseline and made 
relative to the non -operative leg (internal control). From muscle biopsi es we will also isolate primary 
muscle cells (i.e., satellite cells).  
 
To perform the biopsies, a small incision about the size of this dash “ ---" approximately at mid -thigh, 
through which a needle about the size of this letter " O" will be advanced into t he muscle and fat.  A 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_387834].  This will be done on each leg.  
 
The postoperative biopsies will be performed by [CONTACT_079] (Dreyer). [CONTACT_387985] has 
performed over 500 biopsies and he has performed over 200 tracer studies. The biopsies will be 
performed in his lab at the Center for Medical Education and Research , or at the Slocum Center,  in the 
morning in a fasted state.  This procedure involves the taking of a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_387835], 
containing b oth fat and muscle. The skin is cleaned and made sterile, and the skin and tissue below are 
injected with local anesthetic, lidocaine (numbing medicine), to eliminate pain.  Afterwards, the skin will 
be closed with a single stitch  (Aim 1 only) .  The stitch  will be removed at the lab in about 7 days (plus or 
minus one day to accommodate participant schedule).  
 
 
During the surgery, the surgeon or one of his assistants will perform the biopsies. The patient will still be 
under anesthesia. The intraoperative bi opsies will not have a stitch that requires removal. The site will 
be covered with a sterile dressing.  
 
Primary cell isolation.  Primary cells isolation studies will be performed using standard methods that 
exist in our lab in order to conduct experiments on muscle cells that could not be perform on subjects

 Muscle volume.  The MRI unit is located at the Lewis Center for Neuroimaging (LCNI) on the 
University of Oregon campus. Should the MRI unit at LCNI be unavailable within study -specific 
assessment points (i.e. scheduling or mechanical issues), the MRI at the Slocum Center for 
Orthopedics will be utilized. In addition, patients in partnersh ip with the study team, may elect 
to have all scans performed at the Slocum Center.  
 
All scans will be performed prior to strength & functional testing and a minimum of [ADDRESS_486196] -
therapy. T1 & T2 weighted MR images will be used to quantify quadriceps volume vs. edema. 
MRI is safe for TKA patients (implants are non -ferrous) and is ideally suited for muscle volume 
quantitation. Capture protocols will be stored on the unit to en sure accurate image collection 
over the course of the study. MRIs will not be performed in a fasting state.  
 
MRIs performed at the Slocum Center will follow the standard operating procedures of Slocum 
MRI as per standard of care.  Slocum MRI will carry out  their own screening processes at the time 
of the scan. Research staff will alert MRI  staff if the patient has any  contraindicated implanted 
devices  prior to the scan.  Slocum MRI will follow their standard operating procedures to ensure 
MRI safety.  
 
Beca use MRIs at the LCNI are strictly used for research purposes, study participants will 
complete the IRB -approved LCNI screening form in advance of their MRI procedure(s). Based on 
the screening form results if LCNI requires more information to comfortably s can our patients, 
LCNI will call the study coordinators. Information that may be requested by [CONTACT_387904] (more than one possible):  
1. Confirmation of MRI scan with implant in question has occurred previously  
2. Blinded operative notes of the implant in question

steps) and descent will be recorded. The 4 meter walk will tell us how long it takes you to walk a 
short distance (4 meters) while the 6 minute walk will measure the distance you ca n walk over a 
longer distance (total distance in 6 minutes). We have experience with these functional 
measures. Each functional mobility measure will be performed on a single standardized chair 
(TUG) and stairs.  Functional assessments will not be performed  in a fasting state. Functional 
measurements may be performed at either the Dreyer Lab on the University of Oregon campus 
or the Slocum Center for Orthopedics & Sports Medicine.  
 
 Strength & central activation deficit.  Co-Investigator [CONTACT_387986], P hD, will contribute her 
expertise to quantify pre - and post -operative changes in strength and quadriceps activation

contributes to early weakness following TKA, and [CONTACT_387987] will quantify this progression 
between groups over time using previously published methods will be followed (23, 44, 62, 65, 
67, 112). Voluntary activation of the knee extensor muscles will be assessed through the 
painless method of  supramaximal magnetic stimulation of the femoral nerve superimposed on 
the MVC (90). Central activation of the knee extensors will be calculated from the resulting force 
as follows: (MVC/(MVC + Stimulation)) x 100 (65). Nerve function will be determined u sing the 
latency of the M -wave in response to supramaximal magnetic stimulation of the femoral nerve 
(23, 44). Additionally, pre -post surgery measures of the area of the negative peak of the M -wave 
will be used to estimate motor neuron loss (67). Strength and central activation deficits will not 
be performed in a fasting state. Central activation is measured on the University of Oregon 
campus  or at the Slocum Center .

the FDA  and research  requests, four additional tubes of blood will be drawn (tests for: homocysteine, C - 
reactive  protein,  standard lipid panel, and ketone assay ). While the subject is in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], they will 
only have the additional tubes of blood drawn on the day of surgery and post op day two. In addition, 
we will collect  two extra tube of blood fo r analyzing at the Dreyer Lab  at each blood draw. One tube is a 
serum collection tube and the other a plasma collection tube. Both types of blood product are required 
to conduct the analysis described in the study procedures. ) In total, at each study time -point (pre -admit, 
day of surgery, post op day two, and two and six weeks post -TKA), seven  or eight  tubes of blood are 
collected  (routine care plus study bloods) .  
For pre -admission blood work, the surgeon requires additional blood work to assess for blood clotting 
(PT/INR) and type and screen (i.e. blood type) per standard of care. Pre-admission blood work will not 
be performed in a fasting state.  No ketone assay is collected at pre -admission, resulting in two tubes of 
blood per standard of care, plus five tubes of research -specific blood work.  
Through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], labs collected overlap with standard of care time -points. Inpatient blood 
draws will be performed in a fasting state. There are two additional blood draws required that are for 
research purposes only: two weeks post -TKA (Aim 1)  and six weeks post -TKA, which will also be 
performed in a fasting state . All eight  tubes of blood collected at two weeks, and all seven tubes of 
blood collected at six weeks post -TKA are for research purposes only.  
Each blood tube collected is between 2.7mL and 7.0mL, depending on the blood test requirements. The 
amount of blood collected at each blood draw is between 28mL and 39mL (high estimate).  As 
reference, when a person donates blood, 500 -550mL of blood are donated. Even with seven tubes of 
blood, the amount collected at each draw is approximately  8% of the amount required at a ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_387842].

January 2019   Page | [ADDRESS_486221]. He will be 
responsible for the statistical modeling and, along with Lisa Strycker, MA, will analyze all data points in 
our study (Oregon Research Institute).  
 Aim #1:  Aim 1 wil l compare differences between the two groups (EAA vs. Placebo) across 
experimental conditions in the change in post -TKA metabolism (synthesis & breakdown) from 
baseline to [ADDRESS_486222] -TKA.  
 
 Aim #2  (trials 1 & 2) : Aim 2 will also compare measures of functional mobility with muscle cell 
structure (CSA) and mitochondrial function (respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]), including accelerometer and quality of 
life measures.  
 
Analysis of covariance.  ANCOVA will be used to answer research questions for aim 1 & 2. ANCOVA 
maximizes stat istical power by [CONTACT_387911] a regression -based control, 
reducing individual variance. Power improves as the pre -post correlations increases. Our preliminary 
data indicate that pre -post correlations for many key endpoints are highl y correlated (e.g., muscle 
volume r = .96 for operative leg and r = .97 for non -operative leg; strength r = .42 to .89; stair -climb 
down time r = .78).  
 
Power analyses.  For our power calculations, we have assumed a Type I error rate (α) of .05, two -tailed . 
We based power calculations on effect sizes (d) that we derived from analysis of preliminary data 
preliminary data and prior studies (10, 30, 32, 33, 36, 41, 51, 113). We calculated d as the standardized 
mean difference between treatment conditions at fo llow -up: d = (x C – x T)/S, where x re presents the 
primary outcome mean in the Placebo and EAA conditions and S is the pooled standard deviation, after 
adjusting x for pretest scores and covariates (sex, tourniquet time, age, body mass index, 
fat/carbohydra te/protein intake).  
 
We propose to enroll 40 total subjects for Aim 1  who are retained through protocol completion 
(20/group , EAA and Placebo, randomized to either [ADDRESS_486223] -operative biopsies ), and 80 
total subjects  (40/ group, EAA and Placebo ) for Aim [ADDRESS_486224] sizes were as follows: (a) Cell and FSR data: REDD1 d = 1.24, SLC36A2 d = 1.27, and 
FSR d = 1.51 (FSR calculated from mean change from baseline). The mean effect across outcomes was d 
= 1.37, reflecting large effects. (b) Physiological and functional data (percent change from Baseline to 6 
wk): operative quadriceps volume d = 1.52, and isometric strength d = .90; non -operative quad riceps 
volume d = 1.05, and isometric strength d = .66; timed up -and-go test d = 1.03, timed stair ascent d = 
1.08, timed stair descent d= 1.13, and six -minute walk test d= .70. Mean effect size was d = 1.01, 
reflecting large effects.  
 
Power calculations.   Power calculations were based on the sample size and minimally detectable ES 
(MDES) as follows:

study can detect ESs of d > .79 with 85% power, and the minimally detectable ES drops to .[ADDRESS_486227] covariates of r = .50 or .75, respectively. Preliminary results show an average ES

variance, assuming covariate of r = .[ADDRESS_486229], even if not statistically significant, as an indicator of potentially 
important sex -related differences.   
 
Random coefficients analysis.  Keith Smolkowski, PhD, will run random coefficients analysis (RCA) to 
model muscle, strength, and functional mobility across time as well as data points generated from 
accelerometer and functional analysis. RCA models trajectori es from assessments nested within subjects 
(48); tests of condition are represented by [CONTACT_387912] a time factor and treatment 
condition. The RCA avoids the many pi[INVESTIGATOR_387851] (52, 
91, 101). RCA ad justs for within -individual dependence or autocorrelation in the data (48, 91, 108), and 
with four measurements, the RCA can model nonlinear growth. It does not require fixed spacing among 
assessments, accommodates missing values over time, and allows pi[INVESTIGATOR_387852] (i.e., splines) (48). 
RCA provides a more powerful analysis than ANCOVA. Power estimates of growth models, however, 
require several assumptions that are not easily established. Thus we rely on the fact that the power for 
RCA has been shown to surpass that of ANCOVA (53, 86) especially when applied to four or more 
assessments (118). The RCA, then, will detect smaller differences between conditions than the mixed -
model ANCOVA. Finally, optimal Type I error rates do not depend heavily on normally distributed data 
(48, 52, 74, 85). These methods are also appropriate for relatively small samples, such as those planned 
for the present study (74).   
 
Missing data.  Most longitudinal trials result in missing data. The proposed methods will reduce bias du e 
to missing data (6, 73). Maximum likelihood methods that model time as random, such as RCA, use any 
available data across time, reducing bias and increasing power (43, 91). Our preliminary data show that 
we have been successful in collecting >92% of all data points. However, to minimize missing data, the 
study coordinator and staff will devote significant time and effort to data collection and retention of 
study subjects.  
 
Potential Limitations.  
We do not expect problems with the proposed experimental de sign or data collection. Our research 
team has performed every test and used each method included in this proposal. We have identified and 
addressed issues that may present potential problems and proposed solutions in the Potential Problems 
and Solutions s ection of Aim 1. We are well aware of the potential issues related to enrollment goals

operation. However, our preliminary studies are evidence that we  are very experienced with this patient 
population. The average number of TKA patients who complete our studies is 3 -5/mo. We are therefore 
very confident that we will be able to complete studies on 40 TKA patients (Aim 1) and 80 TKA patients 
(Aim 2); 120 over the entire 5 year study. Issues that present potentially unique problems to our longer -
term study are addressed below.   
 
Statins . A potential limitation with long -term muscle cell function of our clinical study is concurrent use 
of statins, which hav e a strong potential to compromise muscle mitochondrial function (7, 68, 109, 117). 
Over 50% of our TKA subjects use statins. Mitochondrial dysfunction may introduce sample bias as well 
as negatively impact short and longer -term function. To account for th is, we propose to measure 
mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_387839] O2k respi[INVESTIGATOR_14007], and normalize results statistically and 
use the n0n -operative leg as internal control. Thus, measuring mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_387853] (EAA) 
while accounting for statin use between groups as well as between sex  and over time statistically.  
 
Research Population & Recruitment Methods  
Study populations for Aim #1 and Aim  #2 are identical. In addition, the recruitment process does not 
differ between the short -term, biochemistry  study (Aim #1) and the longer term, physiologic study (Aim 
#2).  
 
Target Population.  
Both aims will target older adults, ages 50 – 80 years  (Aim 1) and 40 – 80 years (Aim 2)  for have elected 
to undergo primary total knee arthroplasty performed at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at 
RiverBend or Slocum Ambulatory  Surgery Center by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jewett, Lantz, Mohler or Shah. Between 2005 -
2010, th ey performed a total 2,066 TKAs. Of those, 1,406 of the patients were between 50 -80 years of 
age (68%).  A total of 120 subjects will be enrolled in the two study aims.  
 
 Aim #1.   The biochemistry study aim will obtain complete data on  [ADDRESS_486230] -surgical biopsies. Randomization is stratified by [CONTACT_547]. 
Up to 70 subjects will be enrolled to account for withdrawal and attrition . 
 Aim #2.  The physiology study will obtain complete data on  [ADDRESS_486231] will be administered to those women who 
cannot verify  pregnancy status prior to ingestion of amino acid supplement. Women who are surgically

Participant Recruitment.  
Patie nts eligible for enrollment with pre -operative biopsies will be recruited a least four  to eight  weeks, 
and no more than six months prior to surgery from the clinics of [CONTACT_387989], Lantz, Mohler or Shah, all 
fellowship trained, board certified orthopedic ad ult knee reconstruction surgeons. Patients eligible for 
functional testing only (non -biopsy) may be enrolled with enough time to complete functional testing 
baseline assessments prior to start of supplement (complete functional testing by -1 week + 1 day).   
 
Primary Recruitment Approaches.  In-person consenting will assure all subjects receive a consistent 
informed consent process and have all questions answered prior to enrollment.  
 
1. Physician Co -Investigators will identify potential subjects for enrollment  during a routine clinic 
appointment that results in a decision by [CONTACT_387915]. The 
initial informed consent, screening and enrollment may occur up to six months prior to surgery.  
The physician will request via the Medical Assistants or Surgery Schedulers (“physician 
extensions”) the study coordinator be contact[CONTACT_387916]. Physician extensions will not be engaged in any research -related 
activities, but will identify subjects as potentially eligible or not based on past medical history, 
which is disclosed to the physician extension per standard of care. Only the research coordinators 
or physician Co -Investigators perform informed consenting or formally scre en candidates for 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. (Please see Informed Consent Process below for information about 
the activities involved in subject consenting).  
 
2. Pre-screen/identify potential subjects for recruitment based on inclusion/exclusion criteria  from 
existing surgical appointment list . Potential subjects would be contact[CONTACT_387917] a thorough discussion of study -related 
procedures and to obtain written informed consent. Additiona lly, potential subjects could be 
mailed a recruitment letter with ability to contact [CONTACT_387918]. Strong preference will be given to an in -person consenting process; 
however, should the patient live out of town, a phone consenting process with mailed in 
executed consent form is allowable. Should a participant elect to mail in the informed consent 
document, the research coordinator will re -verify all questions have been answered and the 
patient understands all study -related procedures at the pre -operative study appointment (1 to 6 
weeks prior to surgery). No study related procedures will be initiated prior to confirming patient 
eligibility, understanding and willingness to participate. Patients will have to have an in -person 
discussion (see Informed Consent Process below) before enrolling into the study.

Informed Consent Process.  
Research participants will be presented with a thorough description of all study -related procedures in -
person. Participants will be required to read, review, and discuss the study with study coordinators prior 
to executing the informed consent document. Study coordinator review of the ICF will include reviewing 
all of the bullets on the last page of the consent form with the patients and ensuring participants 
understand the document fully before authorizing consent.  
 
Participants will have an opportunity t o ask their surgeon or the study coordinators any questions prior 
to obtaining informed consent. No study -related procedures will be initiated prior to obtaining written 
consent. To accommodate out of town patients, this protocol allows for consenting conversations to 
happen by [CONTACT_648], and patients who agree to participate may mail in their executed ICF. However, 
patients who elect this option will be required to review study procedures and verbally re -consent on 
the day of their screening, before any study related procedures are initiated.  
 
Surgeons will have responsibility for approving participants for study entry, specifically for ensuring 
study inclusion and exclusion criteria have been met. If a study subject has questions related to study 
procedures a t the Dreyer Lab, Lewis Neuroimaging Center, the study coordinator will answer participant 
questions. In the event the study coordinator does not know the response or for which more expertise is 
necessary to be fully addressed, the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_387859], and all questions answered in advance

In addition to the Informed Consent Form, participants will also be asked to sign a HIPAA Authorization 
form which allows information to be transferred from HIPAA -compliant entities  (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317507]) 
to the research team.  
 
Enrollment & Randomization.  
The study coordinators will communicate participant enrollment to the study PI [CONTACT_10782] a secure,

Following enrollment, before supplement ingestion begins, patients will be provided with a Study 
Patient Binder. The Study Patient Binder will provide patients with instructions regarding supplement 
and/or heavy water administration, accelerometer use, and food diary entries. The Study Patient Binder 
will also provide patients with directions to testing  locations (e.g. labs, MRIs).

tests/procedures performed at Slocum . Only study sta ff directly involved in the administration of 
patient care or study -specific procedures or testing will  have access to identifiable health information.  
 
Confidentiality risks are minimized through our approach and data security practices. All de -identifie d, 
coded data will be stored on a secure, encrypted server, housed within the Slocum Center for 
Orthopedics & Sports Medicine. Slocum Center administers the highest level of technological safeguards 
the industry offers. The study -specific server is entirel y dedicated to the Slocum Research & Education 
Foundation, sharing no networks with the Slocum Center. The software used to manage study patients 
allows for multiple levels of data sharing and permissions. For example, study coordinators and team 
members i nvolved in direct coordination of patient care will have access to identi fiable patient 
information, while collaborating statisticians will have access to only de -identified data files. In addition, 
any provider information contained in the eCRFs will be l imited to a physician  ID number only.  
 
Patient binders  will be stored behind a limited access, key -entry door , further protected by [CONTACT_387925] -hours .  Because the primary study coordination 
team  (Owen and Kirkpatrick ) are housed within a HIPAA compliant, highly secure data protection 
environment, research data are protected by [CONTACT_387926], technical and policy protections as 
patient medical records.  
 
Finally, a single laptop will be used to capture accelerometer data in the field (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Dreyer lab). 
The laptop has multiple fail -safes, which secure the data even if the laptop should be stolen. Using a 
total hard -drive encryption software program, the laptop will not power on without first ente ring the 
encryption key. Accelerometer data are further protected by [CONTACT_387927].  
 
Upon study completion, licensing of the PAM tool requires transmission of de -identified, limited data 
sets to Insignia Healthcare. Data will be transferred through a secure, encrypted FTP upload. Transferred 
files will contain only summary level information (e.g. consistent with a limited data set and containing 
no full sets of patient reported outcome que stionnaires). Only the rolled up result data will be 
transferred to Insignia to fulfill licensing requirements.  
 
As is standard with a clinical trial, information about participation in the research study, including the 
individual having consented to stud y participation will be included in the Slocum medical record. When 
the study coordinators are tracking participation, they may note any important health events and 
correspondence with the patient in the electronic medical record at Slocum. The patient’s s urgeon 
needs this information documented to manage care and monitor their patient’s health and well -being.

A copy of the laboratory results collected for study -related procedures will be provided to the patient’s 
primary care provider. Transmission of results will occur under standard HIPAA protocols for clinic to 
clinic sharing of information (e.g. fax). The patient’s primary care provider may elect to follow -up on

through the study -specific HIPAA Authorization for Research.  
Under the agreement with MEND Nu trition, Inc., aggregate, de -identified study data will be shared back 
with MEND, limited to functional testing results and patient reported outcome measures 
(questionnaires) only. No patients will be directly identifiable through aggregate data, and any c ells with 
resulting counts less than [ADDRESS_486249] patient confidentiality.  
 
Physical injury.  
Physical injury (including falls) is a risk when being asked to perform exercise/strength assessment 
and/or physical independence/perf ormance measures. This risk is increased for persons TKA surgery 
because of issues related to the surgery and the potential need for assistive devices.  
 
 
Blood draws  (Aim 1 only) . The total amount of blood drawn for the purposes of the study will be 
depend  on the study.  The potential risks include infection at the site of the blood draw.  Careful sterile 
technique will minimize the chances of infection at the blood draw site.  There is a risk for redness, 
itching, bruising and soreness at the blood draw sit e.  Your blood will be drawn from a site on your arm.  
Additional blood may be drawn during surgery as determined by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_387861]/or doctors 
outside the purpose of this research study.  
Aim 1  (N=40, 20/group) and Aim 2  (N=80, 40/group) will have the same total amount of blood 
drawn , at study intervals .  
 
Muscle biopsy.  Biopsies will be collected from all TKA patients  (Aim [ADDRESS_486250] the choice to 
participate with or without muscle biopsies) .  
 Aim 1  (N=40, 20/group) will have 1 muscle and  1 fat biopsy per leg during TKA (in the OR) 
(N=40) and  at [ADDRESS_486251] -TKA (N=20); or [ADDRESS_486252] -TKA (N=20).   
 Aim 2  (N=80, 40/group) will have 1 muscle biopsy per leg at Baseline, 6wk & 6mopost -TKA.  
 
The biopsies will be obtained from the vastus lateralis using a 5mm Bergstrom biopsy needle with 
applied suction under sterile conditions. A single incision of 0.5 cm will be made in the skin down to the 
level of the fascia, and approximately 150 mg of muscle tissue will be removed during each biopsy.   
 
The potential risks are pain, bleeding, infection, and loss of superficial sensation (light touch, hot/cold) 
to an area around the biopsy site. There will be a scar approximately 0.6 cm long. The risk of bleeding 
from the biopsy site is 0.2%; the risk of hematoma is 1.4%; the risk of infection is so small that the 
precise number is unknown; and the risk of a loss of superficial sensation is 0.5% (55). After the biopsy,

Aim 1:  It is important to note the biopsies are in a fasting state (no food since dinner the night before). 
For the first biopsies in the ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_8557], fasting is required per routine care before 
surgery. For the second biopsies, occurring at one OR two weeks after surgery, fasting may lead to some 
discomfort. Patients may have to delay taking their pain medication, or risk upset stomach if they take 
their pain medication without food.  
 
Aim 2: It is important to note the biopsies are in a fasting state (no food since dinner the night before). 
Fasting may lead to some discomfort. Patients may have to delay taking their pain me dication  (if taking 
any) , or risk upset stomach if they take their pain medication without food.  
 
 
Risk from heavy water (Aim #1 only).   Brief periods (< 30 minutes) of dizziness have been reported in 
a small number of people (< 5%) after drinking tracer water.  This is due to the tracer water being 
“heavier” than normal water.   “Heavier” water can temporarily disrupt the inner ear’s ability to control 
balance, producing a sensation of dizziness.  
 
Magnetic stimulation (Aim #1 only).  Magnetic stimulation of  the peripheral nerve is a safe and non -
invasive way of supplying information to the muscle. Because this pulse is magnetic, and not electric, the 
procedure is painless. No long -term side effects have been reported; however, on rare occasions, 
individuals find the stimulation uncomfortable.  
 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI , Aim #1 only ). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has 
set guidelines for magnet strength and exposure to radio waves, and we will carefully observe those 
guidelines. For the exp osure in our ongoing study, no negative effects have been seen. Some people 
may feel uncomfortable or anxious during the MRI. On rare occasions, some people might feel dizzy, get 
an upset stomach, have a metallic taste, or feel tingling sensations or muscl e twitches. These sensations 
usually go away quickly. MRI poses some risks for certain people. If an individual has a pacemaker or 
some metal objects inside the body, the strong magnets in the MR scanner may do harm. Another risk is 
a metallic object flyin g through the air toward the magnet and hitting the subject.   
 
Risk from falls.   There is a possibility that a participant may fall and hurt yourself during this study.  
Knee pain may impact a participant’s ability to control muscles.  It takes time to he al from this type of 
surgery and we are asking you to perform physical tasks that may be challenging to you.  You will be 
supervised at all times when completing the tests that help us determine your abi lity to move and your 
strength.  
 
Pregnancy risk. The risks of the amino acid supplement to the human embryo or fetus have not been 
studied. Women who are pregnant are not eligible to participate in this study.  Women of potential 
childbearing age will be asked if they are or could possibly be pregnant. It is  possible a hormone 
pregnancy test will be administered to verify pregnancy status.

proprietary approach to masking the bittering taste associated with EAAs overcomes a significant barrier 
to enrollmen t. MEND is not paying for the study, involved in study design, or execution. MEND has no 
control over the publication/dissemination of study results. There is no difference between researching 
EAA supplementation provided by [CONTACT_387929].  
 
The physicians on this study are not receiving compensation from MEND. Should the nature of this 
relationship between MEND and any member of the research team (including physicians) change, 
formal submission per IRB requi rements will be executed.  
 
Physical injury.  To minimize this risk each subject will be supervised by a member of the research team 
at all times during testing. All aspects of this proposal are currently used and implemented by [CONTACT_123894].  
 
 
Blood draw s (Aim 1) . Each blood tube collected is between 2.7mL and 7.0mL, depending on the blood 
test requirements. The amount of blood collected at each blood draw is between 28mL and 35mL (high 
estimate).  As reference, when a person donates blood, 500 -550mL of b lood are donated. Even with 
seven tubes of blood, the amount collected at each draw is approximately 7% of the amount required at

Heavy water (Aim #1).  Our study coordinators will continually remind subjects via telephone or in 
person of the potential for balance issues with deuterium oxide (heavy water).   
 
Magnetic stimulation (Aim #1).  Participants will be asked to complete a standard Transcranial 
Magnetic Stimulation Safety Screening Questionnaire. In the event that a subject answers “yes” to one 
of the questions on the questionnaire, magnetic stimulation will not be used with these participants. If a 
subject experiences discomfort at any point, this  portion of the protocol will be stopped immediately.  
 
There is significant overlap with regards to TMS and MRI safety screening questionnaires (e.g., Do you 
have a pacemaker?), so, in most cases, people who answer “yes” to a question in the TMS safety 
screening would be excluded from the study, as they would not qualify for an MRI.

Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
The ultimate responsibility for data and safety monitoring rests with the Principal Investigator. It is 
equally clear that the institution must promote an environment that facilitates detailed ongoing review 
and safe conduct of high -priority research studies. Effective data and safety monitoring is not th e result 
of a single committee or individual, but is a shared responsibility within our protocol management 
scheme. The risk level associated with this study is estimated to be moderate and reasonable.  
 
Plan for Monitoring and Safety Review.  
 
 Hans Dreyer , PhD, PT, the Principal Investigator, will be responsible for monitoring the safety 
environment of the participants during the entire study. The orthopedic surgeon Co -
Investigators Brian Jewett, MD, Brick Lantz, MD, Craig Mohler, MD, and Steven Shah, MD, will be 
medically responsible for the subjects’ care relative to the surgery and post -operative medical 
coverage.   
 
 Older subjects will be patients of the Sacred Heart Medical Center, continuously monitored by 
[CONTACT_387931][INVESTIGATOR_387863] s tay after TKA, and followed by [CONTACT_387932].  
 
 Thorough monitoring of the recruitment, enrollment, retention, informed consent process, 
adverse events, study procedures, and evaluation of primary and secondary endpoints will be 
closely ob served by [CONTACT_978], Hans C. Dreyer, PT, PhD., and Co -Investigator Brian A. Jewett, MD.

long -term ability to normalize function, and to accelerated recovery of functional mobility (stair 
descent). These data are all de rived from older adults. Preserving quadriceps strength is clinically 
important because poor strength is directly linked to reduced physical function and gait. Quadriceps 
weakness inhibits balance (84), reduces functional mobility (20, 82), and increases the risk of falls (83) in 
older adults. Our preliminary data suggest that patients on EAA treatment lost less muscle from their 
extremities compared to subjects on placebo. An additional potential benefit will be our potential to 
provide physical therapy to  patients without insurance or in instances where the subjects insurance 
does not pay for the total number of visits we require for this study. These may be considered a

 Erin Owen, Tessa Kirkpatrick  & Michelle Bremer (12 calendar months, 100% effort). Role: Study 
Coordinator. The study co ordinators will be responsible for coordinating all patient centered activity 
beginning with ensuring Slocum staff pre -identify TKA patients based on inclusion/exclusion criteria 
prior to clinic visits. The study coordinators and the surgeon will have a li st of all potentially eligible 
subjects having appointments with Drs. Jewett, Lantz, Mohler, and Shah prior to arriving for clinic visits. 
Once entry criteria are verified by [CONTACT_11065], the study coordinator will explain the study, provide an 
informed co nsent and follow up with patients by [CONTACT_648]. The study coordinator, along with [CONTACT_387985] 
and Drs. Jewett, Lantz. Mohler, and Shah, will be responsible for ensuring enrollment be maintained at 
3+ subjects/month. The study coordinator will ensure data collection and management coordination 
with [CONTACT_387985] and [CONTACT_387997] necessary for periodic and annual reports.  
 
Study coordinators  of the Slocum Education and Research Foundation have office space located on the 
first floor of the Slocum Center for Orthopedics and Sports Medicine. Coordination through the Slocum 
Education and Research Foundation will allow for seamless integration with existing Slocum 
infrastructure with all the necessary credentialing and security clearances. The study coordinators have 
experience with clinical research. As such, the study coordinators will be responsible for the 
coordination of the study participants  and retention via frequent phone and in person visits. The study 
coordinator and [CONTACT_387985] will discuss subject enrollment goals on a day to day basis and meet 
biweekly. The study coordinators will be on -site and work with Slocum staff to maximize pre -screening, 
recruitment, enrollment, and retention of the [ADDRESS_486268] enrollment and phone/email/in person follow -
up to ensure that we meet our targeted enrollment each month. Coordinators  will have direct  contact

researchers from the Department of Human Physiology and the Department of Education at the 
University of Oregon. [CONTACT_387997] and his statistical team will meet with the rese arch team once a 
month or more, as needed. Advanced statistical modeling will be employed to ensure we have the 
necessary power to correlate change in physical function with cellular data obtained from biopsies, 
blood samples, and imaging. Because we propo se a longitudinal clinical trial which has the potential for 
missing data points, [CONTACT_387997]’s statistical analyses will use modeling methods to account for 
potential missing data points, further assuring that we will accomplish our aims within the [ADDRESS_486270]

Week  ______  
 
Patient Comments:  
 
 
 
 
Instructions : Each day at approximately 10 AM (but at least two hours after you have eaten breakfast) 
you will to mix one bottle of pre -weighed supplement into something of your choosing (juice or yogurt, 
for example) and ingest/drink.  You will do this  again approximately 2 hours after lunch (~2 PM).  If you 
miss a time point you can make up that time point later in the day however we request that you do so at 
least 3 to 4 hours apart (supplements in a day) and that you record the time on your log.  
 
On those occasions when you receive physical therapy treatment you will ingest the supplement within 
one hour after treatment.  If you have treatment by [CONTACT_387953] [ADDRESS_486315] 
physical therapy in the afternoon, your afternoon (second supplement of the day) will be ingested 
within one hour after therapy.  This is very important as our research has shown that supplement 
ingestion is much  better for you if taken within one hour of exercise.  
 
If you have questions about your study medication, please call your research coordinators 
[PHONE_8090].

Week  ______  
 
Patient Comments:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Instructions : In order to measure muscle metabolism you will also be asked to ingest tracer water 
(heavy water).The tracer water contains something called an isotope.  An isotope is a normal substance 
that contains an unusual number of neutrons (very, very small particles found in all things).  The isotope 
is usually present in normal water but the tracer water you will drink will contain more than usual.    We 
want you to drink the tracer water so that we can measure reactions in the body.   You will not 
notice/taste the isotope, nor will it change anything in your body.   Each day at approximately [ADDRESS_486316] 50 ml (1.7 ounces) of tracer water.  You will also be allowed to drink 
normal water.   Overall, 95% of people experience no side -effects from drinking heavy water. We want to 
use this heavy water to measure how your cells respond to supplement before surgery.  
 
 
If you have questions about taking heavy water, please call your research coordinators, Erin or Tessa 
at [PHONE_8090].   Date   Morning  Time  Mid-Afternoon  Time  Evening Time   Patient Comments   01/01/2014  10:00a  2:00p  7:00p  No side effects.

2. Try to write down food as you eat it. Do not rely on your memory.  
3. Estimate the amounts in terms of household measures  (like 1 cup, or 8 oz. milk, 3 oz. fish, 1 
teaspoon butter). 1 pat of butter is about 1 teaspoon. (See sample pi[INVESTIGATOR_387873].)

milk) or you know what it weighs (3 oz. chicken). [ADDRESS_486323] 2.5 oz.

6. 1 ounce cheese = 1 slice cheese = 1/4 cup shredded chee se.   
7. 3 oz. of meat is about the size of a deck of cards.  
8. Note the food’s preparation method (baked, fried, etc.).

are.  Your  signature  [CONTACT_387981].  Participation  in this study  is voluntary.  
Please  note that this consent  form is for the research  study  only and that consent  for surgery  will 
be obtained  at a later time by [CONTACT_387962].   
 
What  is the purpose  of the study?   
 
This study  will determine  the effect  of ingesting  essential  amino  acids  (EAA)  twice -daily for 1 week  
before  through  6  weeks  after your total knee  replacement  surgery.   Each  participant  will be 
randomly  assigned  to either  receive  the EAA or a  placebo  (a non-essential  amino  acid called  
alanine)  supplement.   Like a coin flip, you have  about  a 50-50 chance  of receiving  the real essential  
amino  acid supplement.   Two groups  (EAA  or placebo)  will then be compared  for things  such as 
muscle  protein  synthesis,  muscle  architecture  and functional  mobility.  We want to see if 
supplementing  your diet with EAA will reduce  muscle  loss and boost  recovery.  
 
What  will happen?    
 
Below is an outline  of what we require  for your participation  in this study  and when  study  activities  
happen .  It is very important  that you complete  each  of the testing  sessions,  measures,  and 
questionnaires  to the best of your ability.   To assist  you with this a study  coordinator  will be in 
regular  contact  [CONTACT_387963].   Phone  calls by [CONTACT_387964]  & Orthopedics  will occur  often.   Below  is an 
overview  of the entire  study.  This provides  a general  outline  of what is involved.

Pre-TKA supplement  ingestion  (before  surgery).    
 
Starting  7 days  before  your surgery,  you will begin  supplementation.   Each  day at approximately  
10 AM (but at least  two hours  after you have  eaten  breakfast)  you will mix two level scoop s of 
supplement  into water  or beverage  of choice  (e.g. smooth ie) and and drink.   You will do this again  
approximately  2 hours  after lunch  (~2 PM).   If you miss a time point  you can make  up that time 
point  later in the day however  we request  that you do so at least  3 to 4 hours  apart  (supplements  
in a day) and that you record  this in the log book  we provide  you.  Any questions  you have  please  
call your study  coordinator  at the Slocum  Foundation.  They  can be reached  at [PHONE_8093]  or 
[PHONE_8094] . 
 
 
Post -TKA supplement  ingestion  (after  surgery).    
 
Just like before  you had surgery  you will again  ingest  supplement  twice  each  day for 6 weeks.   
This will occur  while  you are in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (not on day of surgery)  and after you are discharged.  
Each  day at approxim ately  10 AM (but at least  two hours  after you have  eaten  breakfast)  you will 
be given  your supplement  tor drink.  This will occur  again  in the afternoon  at approximately  [ADDRESS_486350]  3 to 4 hours  apart  (supplements  in a day) and that you record  this in the logbook  
we provide  you.  Any questions  you have  please  call your study  coordinator  at [PHONE_8093]  or 
[PHONE_8094] . 
 
After  surgery  you will have  physical  therapy  which  is routine  and prescribed  by [CONTACT_4904].   On 
those  occasions  when  you receive  physical  therapy  treatment  you will ingest  the supplement  
within  one hour after treatment.   If you have  treatment  by [CONTACT_387966]  [ADDRESS_486351]  physical  therapy  in the afternoon  then your afternoon  (second  supplement  of the day) 
will be ingested  within  one hour of therapy.   This is very important  as our research  has shown  that 
supplement  ingestion  is much  better  for you if taken  within  one hour of exercise.  
 
 
Logbook s.   
 
Over  the course  of the study  we will help you keep  track  of certain  components  that are important  
for us to record.   For example  the logbook  will help you to keep  track  of when  you take your 
supplement .  
 
The study  team  will also keep  logbook s as part of the study.   We will ask you about  your 
demographics  (example:  age, race/ethnicity),  health  status,  mental  health  status,  medications  
and any health -related  changes  or tests  that happen  to you during  the study.   We have  to track  
these  details  to determine  how essential  amino  acid supplementation  impacts  your recovery  after 
surgery.   The study  coordinators  will help you keep  your logbook,  and ours,  up to date.

Wearing  the accelerometer  will begin  close to when  you start the study.  The accelerometer  will 
be worn  as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_387879].  The accelerometer  will be worn  at four time points  during  the study  for seven  consecutive  
days :  
 
(1) Once  between  8 to four weeks  before  your surgery   
(2) Once  at six weeks  post surgery  
(3) Once  at three  months  post surgery  
(4)  Once  at six months  post surgery  
 
This device  will help us to gauge  the effect  of overall  physical  activity  on recovery  and how this 
may explain  some  of the positive  results.   
 
 
Questionnaires.    
 
You will be asked  to complete  questionnaires  over the course of this study  that will help us to 
understand  your health,  health -related  quality  of life, and ability  to move  around  factor  into your 
progress.   These  questionnaires  will be completed  before  TKA surgery  and at [ADDRESS_486353]  on your recovery  
after surgery . 
 
 
Function  (ability  to move  around  and strength).   
 
Here  are the tests  we will ask you to do during  this study  that will help us measure  your ability  to 
get around  and how strong  you are before  and after surgery:   
 standardized  grip strength,   
 standing  balance,   
 chair  stand  test,  
 timed  up-and-go (TUG),   
 timed  stair ascent  (up) and timed  stair descent  (down),   
 four-meter  walk and  
 
You will complete  each  of the above  between  [ADDRESS_486354] measures  the time it takes  for the participant  to 
stand  and sit five times.  TUG  will measure  the time (seconds)  needed  to stand  from a chair,  walk 
3 meters,  turn around,  walk back  and be seated  again.   Timed  stair ascent  (10 steps)  and descent  
will be recorded.  We have  experience  with these  functional  measures.  The 4 meter  walk will tell 
us how long it takes   you to walk a short  distance  (4 meters).   Functional  tests  will be performed  
at the University  of Oregon  or the Slocum  Center.  
 
Completing  the functional  mobility  assessment  is the main  component  of this study  that we are 
looking  to change  in a positive  sense  with supplementation.   Older  adults  who have  this surgery  
may be able to do much  more  if the supplementation  helps  regain  mobility.

About  the biopsies  (optional) . 
 
This study  involves  optional  biopsies.  These  biopsies  will only be performed  if you elect  to have  
them  done  and if the biopsy  can be scheduled  for at least  [ADDRESS_486355]  the biopsies  performed.   
 
A small  incision  about  the size of this dash  “___"  approximately  at mid-thigh,  through  which  a 
needle  about  the size of this letter  "O" will be advanced  into the muscle.   A pi[INVESTIGATOR_387880].   This will be done  on each  leg.  
 
Your  biopsies  will be performed  by [CONTACT_387967], [CONTACT_387985],  who is running  this trial. 
[CONTACT_387985]  has performed  over [ADDRESS_486356]. Dreyer  in his 
lab at the Center  for Medical  Education  and Research,  or at the Slocum  Center,  in the morning  
before  you’ve  had food (fasted  state).  This procedure  involves  the taking  of a  small  pi[INVESTIGATOR_387881]. The skin is cleaned  and made  sterile,  and the skin and tissue below  
are injected  with local anesthetic,  lidocaine  (numbing  medicine),  to eliminate  pain.   Afterwards,  
the skin will be closed  with a single  stitch  and/or  steri-strips  and a dressing .  The stitch, if used,  
will be removed  by [CONTACT_387968]  7 days  (plus  or minus  one day to accommodate  
your schedule).  
 
 
If you choose,  you will have  biopsies  at three time points,  one biopsy  in each  leg (total  of six):  
(1) 4 to 8 weeks  before  surgery  
(2) 6 weeks  after surgery  
(3) 6 months  after surgery  
 
The Dreyer  Lab will be measuring  your muscle weight,  comparing  the wet biopsies  to dried  muscle 
samples.  The samples  will tell the study  team  how much  edema  (fluid  accumulation)  you have  in 
your leg before  and after surgery . 
 
From  your muscle biopsies  we will isolate  primary  muscle cells called  satellite  cells.   Under  the 
right conditions  in cell culture,  these  primary  cells,  isolated  from you muscle tissue samples,  can 
increase  in number  and form primitive  muscle cells.   Recently,  this type of work  has shown  that 
these  cells can inform  us about  how your muscles may respond  to various  conditions.   We will 
perform  primary  cell isolation  in order  to conduct  experiments  on your muscle  cells that we could  
not perform  on you (For example,  we can block  metabolic  processes  from happening  and 
evaluate  the impact  on muscle tissue) and increase  the amount  of muscle tissue we have  to work  
with. You will be fasting  (no breakfast)  before  your muscle biopsies.   
 
This research  will help us to learn  much  more  about  how your muscle cells respond  to treatment  
over the course of the clinical  trial. 
 
The Primary  Cell Isolation  Experiment  is Not Long -term  Storage  of Your  Cells.  The primary  
cell isolation  technique  is not a way to develop  perpetual  (long -term)  cell lines.   Once  we isolate  
primary  cells we will keep  them  frozen  at -80°C  until we are ready  to perform  cell culture  
experiments  on them.   However,  once  they are in cell culture,  they have  a finite  life span  and will 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_387882]  2 to 4 weeks.   After  the experiments  on your cells are completed  they will be dead  
already  or destroyed.

You will official ly be in the study  from the date you sign this consent  form,  which  could  be up to 
six months  before  surgery  until the last study activity  is completed  six months  after surgery.  Your  
study -related  activities  don’t begin  until approximately  [ADDRESS_486358]  people  will be actively  participating  in the study  
for about  eight  months.   
 
 
IMPORTANT:   Participation  in this study  will not affect  your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_297866], which  is

What  are the risks  of participating  in this research?    
 
This study  may include  risks that are unknown  at this time.   Possible  risks and discomforts  you 
could  experience  during  this study  include:  
 
Risk  from  biopsies.   The potential  risks of this procedure  are some  pain,  bleeding,  bruising,  
infection,  and scar at the site of biopsy.   Careful  sterile  technique  should  reduce  the likelihood  of 
any of these  complications.   The risk of bleeding  from the biopsy  site is 0.2%;  the risk of bruising  
or blue-and-black  mark  is 1.4%;  and the risk of infection  is so small  that the precise  number  is 
unknown.   Additionally,  you may experience  numbness  around  the area of the biopsy  site 
(approximately  2x2 inches  in area),  which  will likely  go away  with time (sensation  returns)  but in 
very rare instances  sensation  may never  return.   The risk that you experience  numbness  is less 
than 0.5%  and the risk that the numbness  never  goes  away  is much  less.   Pre-TKA (4-8 weeks  
prior to surgery)  and Post-TKA biopsies  (6 weeks  and 6 months)  will be performed  using  local 
anesthetic  (lidocaine),  which  will remove  or eliminate  sensation  of the biopsy.   After  a biopsy  you 
have  a 50% chance  of experiencing  soreness  at the site of biopsy  for 24 to 48 hours.   Over  the 
counter  medication  will be enough  to eliminate  any potential  pain from the biopsy  site.  The scar 
will be approximately  long like this dash “___”.   We have  performed  muscle biopsies  on over 100 
older  adults  during  and after TKA without  side-effects.

It is important  to note the biopsies  occur  while  you are fasting  (no food since dinner  the night  
before).  On the morning  of your post-operative  biopsies  you may have  to delay  taking  your pain 
medication,  or risk upset  stomach  if you take your pain medication  without  food.  The study  team  
can accommodate  post-operative  biopsies  as early  as 6:00am  to help minimize  any potential  
discomfort.   
 
Risk  from  falls.   There  is a possibility  that you may fall and hurt yourself  during  this study.   This 
is mentioned  because  your knee  pain affects  your ability  to control  your muscles.   Also,  it takes  
time to heal from this type of surgery  and we are asking  you to perform  physical  tasks  that may 
be challenging  to you.  You will be supervised  at all times  when  completing  the tests  that help us 
determine  your ability  to move  and your strength.  
 
Pregnancy.    The risks of the amino  acid supplement  to the human  embryo  or fetus  have not 
been  studied . Women  who are pregnant  are not eligible  to participate  in this study.   Women  of 
potential  childbearing  age will be asked  if they are or could  possibly  be pregnant.  It is possible  a 
hormone  pregnancy  test will be administered  to verify  pregnancy  status.  The study  staff can 
answer  any questions  you may have  about  this process.   
 
Are there  benefits  to taking  part in this study?   
 
You will likely  receive  no direct  benefit  from your participation  in this study.   Essential  amino  acids  
have  been  shown  to reduce  muscle loss in persons  having  TKA such as yourself.   For example,  
in a study  we recently  completed  we found  that patients  in the EAA group  lost less muscle  from 
their legs as compared  to those  in the placebo  group.   This may be conside red a potential  benefit.   
However,  that study  included  only 28 participant s total,  which  clinically  is considered  a very small  
sample.   We repeated  this study  with 39 participants  in 2014  – [ADDRESS_486359] less muscle  than the placebo  group.  Thus,  the purpose  of this study  is to replicate  
those  findings  in a much  larger  group  of participants,  and determine  how EAA supplementation  
may be working  at the cellular  level.  Neither  you nor the investigators  working  directly  with you will 
be aware  of which  study  group  you are in (EAA  or Placebo).   This is called  a placebo  controlled  
double  blind study  for this reason.   
 
Will you receive  new information  about  the study?  
 
You will be told about  any new findings/ information  that might  change  your decision  to be in this 
study.  You may be asked  to sign a new consent  form if this occurs  to ensure  you full understand  
the changes . 
 
What  other  choices  do I have  if I don’t  participate  in this research  study?    
 
This research  is being  conducted  to gather  information.   You are free to choose  not to take part 
in this study.  Should  you decide  to withdrawal  participation,  your surgeon  and care providers  will 
care for you according  to their routine  standard  care procedures.  Payment  for your routine  care 
after withdrawal  from the study  will be the same  as if you did not participate  in the study,  which  
you will have  to work  out between  your surgeon,  care facilities  and your insurance  company.   
 
Are there  any costs  associated  with this research  study?    
 
You will not pay for any tests  or procedures  that are performed  for the purposes  of this research  
study.   You will be compensated  for participating  in the study.   This money  is to compensate  you 
for your time and any inconvenience  it presents  to you.  If you do not complete  the study,  you will 
receive a reduced  amount  of money  based  on study  timeline  events  completed:

Where  does  the study  supplement  come  from?   
 
The study  team  has learned  from the first two EAA studies  we have  done  that essential  amino 
acids  have  a very bitter  taste.  To overcome  this barrier,  we have  partnered  with a company  called  
MEND  Nutrition,  Inc. (“MEND”)  who adds  all natural  flavoring  to the supplement  so patients  are 
able to take it without  too much  trouble.  MEND  worked  direc tly with our team  to create  a custom 
supplement  that meets  our requirements  regarding  the composition  of EAAs  we are studying.  
MEND  has provided  the supplement  to our study  for only the cost of shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  In exchange  for 
making  our supplement  and the placeb o for us to study,  the Slocum  Center  will sell the other  
MEND  products  that are commercially  available  nutritional  supplements.  The profits  from the sale 
of the other  MEND  nutritional  products  will go back  to the nonprofit  Slocum  Foundation  to support  
our research  program.  Neither  the Slocum  Center  nor the physicians  affiliated  with this study  profit  
from the sale of MEND  nutritional  products  at Slocum.

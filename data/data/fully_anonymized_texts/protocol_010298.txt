2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted
Hepatitis C viral infection is a global health problem, with over 184 million individuals infected 
worldwide.1  Successful treatment of HCV has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of disease 
progression and related mortality.2,3  The advent of DAAs has dramatically changed the HCV treatment 
outcomes, with SVR rates over 90% with shorter treatment durations and improved tolerability compared to peginterferon based regimens.  However with the first generation DAAs,
4there is still a 
need for a comprehensive patient assessment, including determination of fibrosis status, genotype and subtype, and baseline characteristics (such as quantitative viral load) in order to determine the best treatment strategy (regimen, duration, addition of RBV).  The next generation DAAs are typi[INVESTIGATOR_753520].
2  Fibrosis status is usually assessed by [CONTACT_145139] (an invasive method) 
or a noninvasive method such as transient elastography which is currently not available worldwide.[ADDRESS_1031515] consistently achieved SVR, the 
focus is shifting to patients with milder forms of liver disease (i.e., non-cirrhotic) for whom HCV treatment is also cost effective (as these patients have a low risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_753521]).
3,5-[ADDRESS_1031516] shown that scaling up therapy for the patient population with 
mild liver disease is a key strategy towards HCV eradication by [CONTACT_753529].5
[COMPANY_013]'s next generation DAAs include GLE, an HCV NS3/4A PI, and PIB, an HCV NS5A inhibitor.  Each DAA has potent antiviral activity against the major HCV GTs in vitro with no or little loss of potency against common single-position NS3 and NS5A resistance-associated substitutions.  Glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_753522]-dose combination tablets have been developed for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.
8,9
The GLE/PIB registrational program assessed a broad population including subjects with compensated liver disease and subjects with severe renal insufficiency across all GTs using a single GLE/PIB dose of 300 mg/120 mg QD.  Supportive Phase 2 studies used the Phase 2 formulation of separate GLE and PIB tablets, with each tablet containing 100 mg and 40 mg, respectively.  Treatment arms from these supportive Phase 2 studies using the regimen selected for registrational studies (GLE 300 mg plus PIB 120 mg) were pooled with arms from the registrational studies for analyses of efficacy and safety.  Treatment-naïve and treatment experienced subjects to any combination of pegylated interferon, RBV, sofosbuvir, NS5A inhibitors, or PIs were allowed in the program.  In addition, the program included subjects with HIV co-infection (Study M13-590), subjects with chronic kidney disease Stages 4 – 5, including those on hemodialysis (Study M15-462), subjects with compensated cirrhosis (Studies M14-172, M15-462, and M14-868 Part 3), and subjects with or without cirrhosis who failed a previous regimen containing an NS5A inhibitor and/or an NS3/4A PI (Study M15-410).

8-13
In treatment naïve subjects with compensated cirrhosis GLE/PIB achieved SVR 12rates over 98%, 
including in subjects with GT3, with 12 weeks of therapy as in SURVEYOR II Part 3 (Study M14-868 –GT3).
10
Based on the efficacy data presented above, the 8-week treatment duration is anticipated to achieve high SVR
12rates in GT1 – 6-infected treatment-naïve subjects without cirrhosis.10,12
In Phase 3 trial, ENDURANCE-1 (M13-590), that has explored chronic HCV GT1 treatment naïve adult subjects without cirrhosis, the administration GLE/PIB for 8 weeks has shown SVR
12rates of 99.1% 
(348/[ADDRESS_1031518] with missing data).  This was non-inferior to the 12 week arm data.11  In the 
combined analysis from Phase 2, SURVEYOR II-Part 4 study that has explored chronic GT2, 4, 5 and 6 treatment-naïve adult subjects without cirrhosis, the administration GLE/PIB for 8 weeks has shown SVR
12rates of 96.5% (196/203, including 3 subjects with missing data).12  These results were similar to 
12 weeks of GLE/PIB in this population.  For chronic HCV GT3 treatment-naïve adult subjects without-cirrhosis, the SVR
12rate for 8 weeks of therapy was 94.9% (149/157 including 2 subjects with missing 
data), also non-inferior to 12 weeks of therapy  as demonstrated in ENDURANCE-3 (Study M13-594).13
While a pangenotypic regimen that has high efficacy across all treatment-naïve non-cirrhotic patients with 8 week treatment duration is very attractive for treatment simplification and scaling up therapy
6,7,14, the need for a comprehensive patient evaluation with more complex diagnostic tests such 
as liver biopsy and transient elastography to identify cirrhosis can still be a barrier to access to 
treatment.5  Some guidelines recommend that serum biomarkers can be used in the absence of 
transient elastography.4,5,7,14  The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines state that non-invasive 
monitoring is considered to be preferable to invasive testing.  The WHO considers that APRI, Fibrosis-4 
score (FIB-4) and transient elastography are the most useful tests for assessing the stage of liver disease.
[ADDRESS_1031519] been evaluated to identify patients with cirrhosis or advanced 
fibrosis.  Among these, the APRI has been extensively studied and a meta-analysis including more than 16,000 patients has shown mean accuracy of 0.84 to identify non-cirrhotic patients with a cut off ≤ 1.
6  
The negative predictive value, i.e., the probability of identifying non-cirrhotic patients when in a population with an estimated cirrhosis prevalence of around 18% for APRI ≤ 1 using sensitivity and 
specificity reported in this meta-analysis was calculated to be around 94%.  In addition, APRI is a widely available low cost test that is very easy to perform and is validated to diagnose fibrosis and cirrhosis.
5,6  
The APRI cut off ≤ 1 is recommended in guidelines to rule out cirrhosis.6,7,14  Being able to easily identify 
patients that are eligible for 8 week treatment could simplify treatment algorithms and reserve liver biopsy and transient elastography for those patients who really need a more advanced evaluation. 
This study is being conducted to further assess the safety and efficacy of 8 weeks of GLE/PIB 
combination regimen (300 mg GLE/120 mg PIB, QD) in treatment-naïve adults with chronic HCV GT1 –GT6 infection and APRI ≤ 1.

The clinical hypothesis of this study is that 8 weeks of therapy with GLE/PIB in treatment-naïve GT1 –
GT6 subjects that have APRI ≤1 will achieve high efficacy rates as observed in treatment-naïve, 
non-cirrhotic subjects evaluated in Phase 2 – 3 clinical trials for 8 weeks.
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
Chronic HCV infection is a major global health problem impacting quality of life, morbidity, as well as 
mortality.  Evidence suggests that effective treatment of HCV can cure the infection as well as improve 
liver function.1-3
The GLE/PIB regimen is an oral, RBV-free pangenotypic regimen that provides high SVR 12rates ≥ 95% in 
subjects with compensated liver disease infected with HCV GT1 – GT6, with the majority of subjects treated for 8 – 12 weeks.  Low relapse rates < 3% were observed in GT1 – GT6 treatment-naïve subjects without cirrhosis following 8 weeks of treatment, demonstrating no benefit of an additional 4 weeks of treatment.  Among these subjects, an 8-week regimen of GLE/PIB achieved SVR rates similar to 12 weeks of treatment and to the only currently approved pangenotypic HCV regimen.  However, GLE/PIB achieved similar efficacy with a significant reduction of the duration of treatment, which may improve subjects' adherence, access to treatment, and convenience, and also reduce the burden associated with additional medical visits and procedures.
Based on safety data from the registrational and supportive clinical trials where 2369 HCV-infected 
subjects were treated, the fixed-dose combination of GLE/PIB demonstrated a favorable safety profile.  The most frequent GLE/PIB related adverse events (AEs) include headache, fatigue and nausea, and were mostly Grade 1 (mild) in severity.  Grade 3 or higher AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) were uncommon, occurring in 3.8% and 3.1%, of subjects, respectively.  Similarly, the overall rate of study drug discontinuations due to AEs was low (0.5%).
8,9  Safety in subjects with cirrhosis was shown to be 
similar to subjects without cirrhosis.8,9
Potential risks that may occur with GLE/PIB therapy include hepatotoxicity, development of viral resistance, and the development of toxicities from drug-drug interactions (DDIs).  The potential risks for 
GLE/PIB can be monitored, mitigated and managed in clinical practice.
No trends in liver chemistry abnormalities have been observed in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, including 
in subjects with compensated cirrhosis.  ALT elevation from nadir to > 5 × ULN occurred in 3/2367 (0.1%) of subjects; none of these subjects prematurely discontinued study drug due to the elevation in ALT.  Similarly, Grade 3 increases in bilirubin were rare (0.4%), predominantly indirect, and without bilirubin-related AEs.  There were no cases identified consistent with drug-induced liver injury.
While there is a risk for the development of amino acid substitutions conferring resistance to GLE and/or 
PIB in subjects who fail the therapy, it may be possible to successfully retreat these subjects.
The risk of toxicities from DDIs are addressed and mitigated by [CONTACT_753530], which ensures 
awareness of these risks by [CONTACT_753531].  Appropriate recommendations for dose adjustments of certain medications or avoidance of coadministration with other specific medications are provided in the product information.

of HBV reactivation in subjects treated with GLE/PIB has not been studied, HBV co-infected subjects will 
be excluded from the study.
Aminotransferase/platelet ratio index score ≤ [ADDRESS_1031520], non-invasive monitoring and reduced risk of adverse events from liver biopsy was felt to outweigh the potential harms of false-negative case identification by [CONTACT_753532].
5
Given the potential for achieving high rates of SVR in naïve non-cirrhotic subjects with HCV GT1 – GT6 infection and the favorable safety profile of GLE/PIB, the overall benefit-risk balance of the GLE/PIB regimen is, therefore, positive and supports the use in subjects with chronic HCV with compensated liver disease, including subjects with renal impairment and HIV-1 co-infection.

4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
The schematic of the study is shown in Figure 1 .  Further details regarding study procedures are located 
in the Operations Manual .
This is a Phase 3b, multicenter, non-randomized, open label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLE/PIB in HCV treatment-naïve adult subj ects with chronic HCV GT1 – 6 and APRI ≤ 1 for 8 weeks.
The study is designed to enroll approximately 230 subjects (maximum of 20% [46] enrollment of GT3-infected subject) at approximately 43 sites worldwide.

12rates can be achieved with 8 weeks of GLE/PIB, slightly 
lower rates were achieved in treatment-experienced subjects across all GTs.  To reduce the risk of Post-Treatment relapse, treatment-experienced subjects will be excluded from this study.

with lab abnormalities compatible with cirrhosis (low platelets and/or low albumin) will be excluded from this study.
Hepatitis C virus-infected subjects with chronic HCV infection have moderate stable elevations of AST 
and ALT levels and are considered representative of the population who will receive anti-HCV therapy.  This study will include stable subjects with HIV/HCV co-infection, as this sub-population is shown to have similar results as mono-infected treatment-naïve non cirrhotic subjects with [ADDRESS_1031527] some alteration in APRI scores (due to inflammation) and it is difficult to interpret the APRI score in HBV/HCV co-infected population, subjects co-infected with HBV will be excluded from the population.  
The age range selected for this study, [ADDRESS_1031528] a relatively high body mass index, and given the acceptable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of GLE/PIB in previous studies, this protocol will enroll subjects without a body mass index restriction.
Glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_753523], including subjects with chronic kidney disease Stage 4 or 5 and in dialysis.  However, as subjects with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/minute can show falsely low APRI levels which may increase the risk of enrolling a truly cirrhotic subject.  Therefore, subjects with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/minute will be excluded from this study.
Selection of Dose in the Study
The dose of GLE/PIB (300 mg/120 mg by [CONTACT_692776]) to be used in this study is the proposed label-recommended dose.  These doses have been administered to over 2,[ADDRESS_1031529] shown high SVR
12rates with a favorable safety profile.  The maximum dose of 
GLE/PIB will not exceed 300 mg/120 mg per day for up to 8 weeks.
Selection of Treatment Duration
Treatment duration was selected based on available data (SVR 12rates) from 12-week and 8-week 
treatment groups receiving GLE/PIB combinations (Studies M13-590, M15-464, M13-594, M13-583, and 
M14-868) in HCV GT1 – GT6-infected non-cirrhotic subjects as well as exposure-response modeling and simulations.  With robust antiviral activity demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo studies, the 8-week GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg combination is predicted to be optimal across HCV non-cirrhotic, treatment-naïve GT1 – GT6-infected subjects.

Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
An AE can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from accidental 
or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an AE.  Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.2regarding toxicity management) and/or if the investigator considers them to be 
AEs.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.  
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a serious 
adverse event within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event:

Adverse Event Relationship to Study Drug
For the purpose of medical management, all AEs and laboratory abnormalities that occur during the 
study must be evaluated by [CONTACT_737].  All AEs and laboratory abnormalities deemed "clinically significant" based on the medical judgment of the Investigator will be managed and followed to a satisfactory clinical resolution.  
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse event to the 
use of study drug:
Reasonable Possibility – After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, 
clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable Possibility – After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_1031545] reports 
becoming pregnant during the Treatment Period, the administration of study drug may be continued at the Principal Investigator's discretion after discussion with the subject, if the benefit of continuing study

6.2 Toxicity Management
The management of specific AEs and laboratory parameters is described below and in the Operations 
Manual .  This includes the following laboratory abnormalities: 
If a subject experiences a post-baseline increase in ALT to > 5 × ULN which is also > 2 × baseline value, the subject should have a confirmatory ALT measurement performed.
If, the ALT increase is confirmed to be > 5 × ULN which is also > 2 × baseline value, the 
recommendations below should be followed:
! Complete hepatic questionnaire.
! Evaluate for alternate etiology of ALT elevation; document in the source, update the 
medical history and concomitant medications eCRF (if applicable), and obtain Anti-hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M (HAV IgM), Anti-hepatitis A virus total (HAV Total), Anti-HBc IgM, Anti-HBc Total, Anti-HBs, HBV DNA, HBsAg, Anti-hepatitis E virus immunoglobulin M (HEV IgM), Anti-hepatitis E virus immunoglobulin G (HEV IgG) and HEV RNA, and other additional tests, as appropriate. 
! Manage the subject as medically appropriate.
! Repeat ALT, AST, total and fractionated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and international 
normalized ratio (INR) within 1 week.  Repeat liver chemistries as indicated until resolution.
Discontinue study drug if any of the following is observed at any time:
• ALT level is ≥ 20 × ULN in the absence of an alternate etiology.
• Increasing direct bilirubin or INR or onset of symptoms/signs of hepatitis.
• At the discretion of the investigator.
Alternate management of ALT increases is permitted with approval of the [COMPANY_013] Therapeutic Area 
Medical Director.

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].7 STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will be finalized prior to the database lock.  The statistical analyses will be performed using a statistical analysis system (SAS) (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]).
7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population includes all enrolled subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_1031548] 1 dose of study drug. 
7.3 Statistical Analyses
Primary Analysis
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects who achieve SVR 12(HCV RNA < LLOQ 
[ADDRESS_1031549] actual dose of study drug) across genotypes in adults with HCV GT1 – GT6.  The 
primary endpoint will be analyzed based on mITT population. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints of SVR 12, on-treatment virologic failure, and post-treatment relapse 
will be analyzed across genotypes in adults with HCV GT1 – GT6 based on ITT population.
For the analysis of post-treatment HCV virologic relapse, completion of treatment is defined as any 
subject with study drug duration of 52 days or greater. 
The number and percentage of subjects achieving SVR 12will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% 
confidence interval using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, unless the number of 
subjects who fail to achieve SVR 12is less than 5, where the Wilson's score method will be used for the 
confidence interval instead.  A summary of reason for SVR 12non-response (e.g., on-treatment virologic 
failure, relapse, other) will be provided.
The efficacy of 8-week treatment duration for subjects with APRI ≤ 1 based on mITT population will be 
established if the lower boundary of two-sided 95% confidence interval for the percentage of subjects 
achieving SVR 12is greater than 92.4% among HCV GT1 – GT6 subjects. 
p. 27 of 40
STUDY M16-133  |  Version 2.0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].The efficacy of 8-week treatment duration for subjects with APRI ≤ 1 based on ITT population will be 
established if the lower boundary of two-sided 95% confidence interval for the percentage of subjects 
achieving SVR 12is greater than 91.4% among HCV GT1- GT6 subjects.
In order to control the Type I error rate, a fixed sequence testing procedure will be used for the SVR [ADDRESS_1031550] secondary endpoint of SVR 12based on ITT population. 
The multiplicity controlled efficacy endpoints will be tested sequentially in the following order:
1. Efficacy of the 8-week treatment duration based on mITT population:  If this endpoint is 
statistically significant, then proceed to the following efficacy endpoint.  If this endpoint is not statistically significant then stop the testing procedure and declare that no endpoints in the study met statistical significance.  
2. Efficacy of the 8-week treatment duration based on ITT population:  If this endpoint is 
statistically significant, then declare the SVR
12endpoint is statistically significant for both 
mITT and ITT populations.  If not, then announce that SVR 12endpoint is statistically 
significant only for mITT population.
For on-treatment virologic failure and post-treatment relapse, the number and percentage of subjects will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using Wilson's score method.
Further details on the primary and other efficacy analyses are provided in the SAP.
Sample Size Estimation
It is planned to enroll approximately 230 adult subjects with chronic HCV GT1 – GT6 infection with APRI 
≤ [ADDRESS_1031551] approximately 
maximum 46 GT3-infected subjects (20% of total subjects).
With approximately 230 GT1 – GT6 infected subjects (with 46 GT3 subjects) in mITT analysis, this study 
has approximately 90% power to demonstrate efficacy of the 8-week treatment in terms of SVR 12rate 
(i.e., a two-sided 95% lower confidence bound above 92.4%), assuming that 98% of the GT1, GT2, GT4, GT5, and GT6-infected subjects with APRI ≤ 1 and 94% of the GT3-infected subjects with APRI ≤ 1 
achieve SVR
12.
With 230 GT1 – GT6 infected subjects (with 46 GT3 subjects) in ITT analysis, this study has approximately 83% power to demonstrate efficacy of the 8-week treatment in terms of SVR
12rate (i.e., a two-sided 
95% lower confidence bound above 91.4%), assuming that 97% of the GT1, GT2, GT4, GT5, and GT6-infected subjects with APRI ≤ 1 and 93% of the GT3-infected subjects with APRI ≤ 1 achieve SVR
12.
Efficacy for the 8-week regimen in this study is established by [CONTACT_753535]/PIB administered for 8 weeks in treatment-naïve subjects without cirrhosis.  The 
SVR
12rate of the historical control regimen is calculated, and a threshold is determined by [CONTACT_18647] a 
non-inferiority margin of 6% from the historical SVR 12rate.  Efficacy is established if the lower 95% 
confidence boundary of the SVR 12rate in the 8-week regimen is greater than the threshold.  Efficacy for 
the 8-week regimen in this study is established by [CONTACT_753536] 95% CI for 
SVR 12rate is higher than a cut off value (92.4% and 91.4% for mITT and ITT population, respectively).
p. 28 of 40
STUDY M16-133  |  Version 2.[ADDRESS_1031552] been observed among 
GT3- and non-GT3-infected treatment-naïve subjects without cirrhosis assigned to 8 weeks of GLE/PIB 
treatment.  In these studies, approximately 98.9% and 96.2% SVR 12has been observed among non-
cirrhotic, treatment naïve chronic HCV GT1, GT2, GT4, GT5, and GT6-infected subjects and GT3 subjects, respectively.
11-13  Hence, for the non-cirrhotic GT1 – GT6-infected subjects, based on mITT population, 
the historical SVR 12rate of 98.4% is estimated based on a weighted average of 80% GT1, GT2, GT4, GT5, 
and GT6 historical rate and 20% GT3 historical rate.  To establish cut off for efficacy based on mITT population, a margin of 6% is applied to the historical control rate of 98.4%, resulting in a threshold of 
92.4%.
Historical SVR
12rate based on ITT population depends on the non-virologic failure in a study.  Study-to-
study variability has been observed in non-virologic failure rates, and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_195088] 1%.  The 
observed rate of non-virologic failure in the registrational program is 1.2% (29/2369).11-13  For this 
reason, this study assumes that the historical SVR 12rate based on ITT population for treatment naïve 
non-cirrhotic subjects is 97.4% (with 1% non virologic failure).  To establish cut off for efficacy based on ITT population, a margin of 6% is applied to the historical control rate of 97.4%, resulting in a threshold of 91.4%.

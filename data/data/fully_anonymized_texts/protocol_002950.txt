Study Design:  
This is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized, multicenter, global Phase  2 study comparing 
the efficacy and safety of single -agent poly (ADP -ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor BGB -[ADDRESS_801766] achieved a PR that is maintained for ≥  4 weeks or a CR as 
determined by [CONTACT_605467] (RECIST) 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_801767] -line chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study is PFS by 
[CONTACT_3138]. Sufficient tum or tissue (archival biopsy) must be provided for central 
laboratory determination of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status for randomization 
and exploratory biomarker analyses.  
Patients will be randomized  [ADDRESS_801768] -line chemotherapy . Central 
interactive response technology will be used to randomize patients in a 1:1 ratio and assign eligible 
patients to 1 of 2 arms: Arm A – BGB -290 or Arm B – Placebo. Patient randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_605468] (LO Hhigh versus LOH low versus unknown), region (China/Hong Kong/Taiwan 
versus Australia/Europe/North America versus Japan/South Korea versus rest of world [ROW]), and 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0  versus 1).  
Cycles will be 28  days in length.  
Safety assessments will occur on Day 1 of each cycle, on Day 15 of Cycles 1 and 2, and as needed. 
Dose modifications will be made if appropriate. Adverse events (AEs) will be followed and 
documented during the treatment period and for app roximately [ADDRESS_801769] Version 1.1. Patients will undergo 
tumor assessments at screening and then every 8 weeks (±7 days), or as clinically indicated.  
Administration of BGB -290 or placebo will continue until PD, unacceptable toxicity, death, or another 
discontinuation criterion is met. Once the treatment phase has been completed, an end of treatment 
visit should occur within 7 days of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_605439] -290 or placebo with subsequent phases of safety and 
long-term f ollow -up. 
Long -term follow -up will include tumor assessments every 8 weeks (±7 days) for those patients 
without PD, survival status, new anticancer therapy, and diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia. Long -term follow -up will  continue until the patient dies or another 
criterion for discontinuation from study is met.

as phenytoin and warfarin.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
Tumor imaging studies will be reviewed for the purposes of eligibility determination and on -study tumor 
monitoring. Following the screening tumor assessment, tumor assessments will occur at the schedule of 
every 8 weeks (±7 days) after Day 1. Any measurable disease must be documented at screening and 
reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation. Patients who do not have PD at the time of BGB -[ADDRESS_801774] Version 1.1. The s ame imaging method(s) used at screening 
must be used throughout the study. A documented standard -of-care tumor assessment may be used as the 
screening assessment provided it meets protocol requirements. Survival status of patients will be 
monitored through  all phases of the study.  
Safety:  
Safety will be monitored throughout the study. Safety assessments include AE monitoring and reporting, 
physical examinations, vital sign measurements, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and clinical laboratory tests.

Page  8 of 108 Statistical Methods:  
Analysis Set:  
 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set includes all randomized patients who are assigned to study drug 
(BGB -290 or placebo). The ITT Analysis Set will be used for all efficacy analyses unless otherwise 
specified in the statistical analys is plan.  
 Safety Analysis Set includes all patients in the ITT Analysis Set who receive any dose of study drug 
(BGB -290 or placebo). The Safety Analysis Set will be used for all safety analyses.  
 Per-Protocol (PP) Analysis Set includes all patients in the I TT Analysis Set without major protocol 
deviations that impact assessment of efficacy. Criteria for exclusion from the PP Analysis Set will be 
determined and documented before the final analysis of PFS. The PP Analysis Set will be used to 
perform sensitivit y analysis for the PFS and OS endpoints.  
 PK Analysis Set  includes all patients who receive BGB -290 and for whom valid BGB -290 PK 
parameters can be estimated.  
Efficacy Analyses:  
All efficacy analyses will be conducted using the ITT Analysis Set unless otherwise specified. Primary 
efficacy analysis of PFS will use the investigator assessment of PD according to RECIST Version 1.1. 
Secondary efficacy analyses of ORR, time to response , and duration of response will use the investigator 
assessments of response and PD according to RECIST Version 1.1. All stratified efficacy analyses will 
incorporate the stratification factors used at randomization (HRD status [LOH high versus LOH low versu s 
unknown], ECOG performance status [0 versus 1], and region [ China/Hong Kong/Taiwan versus 
Australia/Europe/North America versus Japan/South Korea versus ROW]), unless otherwise specified.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  
A stratified [ADDRESS_801775] ratio [HR] and its 2 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) will be estimat ed using the stratified 
Cox-proportional hazards model.  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses:  
A stratified log -rank test incorporating the randomized stratification factors will be used to compare 
treatment groups using the ITT Analysis Set for the OS secondary endpoint. The HR and its 2 -sided 
95% CI will be estimated using the stratified Cox -proportional hazards model. The median OS for each 
treatment group will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and the 95% CI will be calculated using 
the Brookmeyer -Crowley method.  
A sensitivity analysis of OS will be conducted using the PP Analysis Set.  
Other secondary time -to-event endpoints, such as TSST and DOR will be analyzed in a similar manner.  
The ORR and its exact 2 -sided 95% CI will be reported for each treat ment group of the ITT Analysis Set. 
A Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel score test will be used to compare treatment groups.  
Only patients with a response of CR or PR during the study will be included in time to response and 
duration of response analyses.

under the plasma concentration -time curve from [ADDRESS_801777] -dose (AUC 0-12) may be derived from 
the population PK analysis if support ed by [CONTACT_33653].  
Exposure -response (efficacy or safety endpoints) analysis may be carried out if supported by [CONTACT_33653].  
Exploratory Efficacy Analyses:  
Patient -reported outcomes will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -STO22 questionnaires 
and the EQ -5D-5L health questionnaire. The scores from these questionnaires will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_605470].  
Correlative biomarker analyses in tumor tissues and blood will be performed. A separate statistical 
analysis plan will outline details  of the biomarker analyses.  
Safety Analysis:  
All TEAEs including, serious AEs (SAEs), deaths,  Grade 3 TEAEs, study drug -related TEAEs, and 
TEAEs that led to study drug withholding or permanent discontinuation, will be summarized. Study drug 
exposure, vit al sign measurements, ECG results, and clinica l laboratory results will also be summarized.  
Sample Size:  
This study is designed to provide 80% power for PFS. The following assumptions are used in determining 
the sample size for this study:  
 Overall type I error rate: 0. 1 (1-sided)  
 Randomization: 1:1  
 Median PFS for placebo group: 6.0 months  
 PFS HR (BGB -290/placebo): 0.63

common cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death together with colorectal 
and liver cancer ( Global Burden of Disease Cancer Collaboration, 2017 ). More than half of gastric 
cancer cases and deaths are estimated to occur in China, with approximately 680,000 cases and 
approximately 500,000  deaths in 2015 ( Chen et al, 2016 ). Predicted gastric cancer deaths for the 
European Union in 2017 are approximately 55,000  (Malvezzi et al, 2017 ). For the [LOCATION_002] 
(US), estimates for gastric cancer in 2017 are approximately 28,00 0 cases with 11,000 deaths 
(Siegel et al, 2017 ). 
Adenocarcinoma is the major histologic subtype representing approximately 90% of gastric cancer 
(Smyth et al, 2016 ). About two -thirds are true gas tric cancers (non -cardia) and the remainder are 
gastroesophageal junction cancers (cardia) ( Colquhoun et al, 2015 ). The most common anatomical 
subsites differ in world regions due to differences in risk factors. Distal and  antral gastric cancers 
are more common in East Asia and tumors of the proximal stomach or gastroesophageal junction 
are more common in non -Asian countries ( Forman and Burley, 2006 ; World Cancer Research Fund 
International/American Institute for Cancer Research, 2017 ). Patients with newly diagnosed 
inoperable locally advanced or metastatic disease generally receive chemotherapy regimens 
containing a platinum and a fluoropyrimidine ( Smyth et al, 2016 ; NCCN  2017 ). Triplet regimens 
may provide additional clinical benefit, as suggested in a meta -analysis for the addition of an 
anthracycline ( Okines  et al, 2009 ). Because of their added toxicities, however, they have not been 
uniformly adopted and are recommended only for medically fit patients with good performance 
status and access to frequent toxicity evaluations. In Western countries, approximately two -thirds of 
patients present with advanced disease. Response rates for first -line chemotherapy regimens are 
around 30% to 50% with median progression -free survival (PFS) ranging from 5 to 7 months. 
Median overall survival (OS) is less than 12 months, and less than 10% of patients are still alive 
after 5 years ( Chau  et al, 2004 ; Cunningham et al, 2008 ; Kang et al, 2009 ; Koizumi  et al, 20 08; Van 
Cutsem et al, 2006 ; Wagner et al, 2006 ). Approximately 12% to 20% of gastric adenocarcinomas 
are HER2 -positive ( Van Cutsem et al, 2015 ). For these pa tients, a unique treatment paradigm has 
been established that combines first -line platinum - and fluoropyrimidine -based chemotherapy with 
the anti -HER2 antibody trastuzumab ( Bang  et al, 2010 ).  
The duration of first -line chemoth erapy typi[INVESTIGATOR_605442] 6 months, either because of 
progressive disease (PD) or due to the cumulative toxicities of chemotherapy ( Cunningham et al, 
2008 ; Van Cutsem  et al, 2006 ; Hess et al, 2016 ). Therefore, for patients who have achieved 
maximum tumor reduction with first -line chemotherapy, the concept of further treatment with a 
regimen of good tolerability is appealing. However, there are currently n o approved drugs for 
maintenance treatment after first -line therapy. There are few data for monotherapy with a 
fluoropyrimidine, and they do not support that this approach provides clinical benefit compared 
with best supportive care ( Li et al, 2017 ; Qiu et al, 2014 ). The concept of further therapy with a

Page  21 of 108 different regimen (switch maintenance) is currently being explored in several studies. The Phase  3 
JAVELIN Gastric 100 study is comparing the anti -PD-L1 antibody avelumab to continued 
platinum -based chemotherapy after a short induction phase of only 12 weeks with a platinum 
doublet ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). Similarly, the ARMANI Phase 3 tri al is 
comparing paclitaxel plus ramucirumab to continued platinum doublet after 12  weeks of induction 
chemotherapy ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). The Phase 2 trial MANTRA allows up 
to 6 months of platinum -based chemotherapy before randomization to either regorafenib or placebo 
(Aprile et al, 2016 ).  
In the second -line setting, several single -agent chemotherapy options are available, including 
irinotecan, docetaxel, or paclitaxel, that have been shown to improve OS compared with best 
supportive care ( Ford  et al, 2014 ; Hironaka et al, 2013 ; Kang et al, 2012 ; Roy et a l, 2013 ; Thuss -
Patience et al, 2011 ). The anti -VEGFR -2 antibody ramucirumab is another option for second -line 
therapy since it has shown, as monotherapy, a survival benefit comparable with chemotherapy, and, 
when combi ned with paclitaxel, a survival benefit over paclitaxel alone ( Fuchs et al, 2014 ; Wilke et 
al, 2014 ). More recently, immunotherapy with anti -PD1 antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab 
has resulted  in durable remissions for a subset of patients ( Le et al, 2016 ; Muro et al, 2016 ). 
ONO -12 (ATTRACTION 2), a randomized Phase [ADDRESS_801787] 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, 
showed that PD1 inhibition can lead to a survival improvement in heavily pretreated gastric cancer 
patients. Median OS was 5.32 months (95%  confidence interval [CI],  4.63% -6.41%) with 
nivolum ab versus 4.14 months (95% CI, 3.42% -4.86%) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.63; 95% 
CI, 0.50% -0.78%; P <0.0001), suggesting that a subset of patients may derive longer -term benefit 
from PD1 inhibition ( Kang  et al, 2017 ). Phase [ADDRESS_801788] -line patients are now 
ongoing to determine the efficacy of anti -PD1 and PD -L1 antibodies compared to single -agent 
chemotherapy ( Kelly,  2017 ). 
1.2. Poly (ADP -ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors  
Poly (A DP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) proteins are involved in DNA replication, transcriptional 
regulation, and DNA damage repair. DNA -bound PARP1/2 catalyzes the synthesis of poly 
(ADP -ribose) (PAR) onto a range of DNA -associated proteins that mediate DNA repair. PARP1 
also undergoes auto -PARylation, a molecular change that ultimately leads to its release from DNA. 
Inhibition of PARP converts common single -strand DNA breaks (SSBs) into double -strand breaks 
during DNA replication. Small -molecule inhibitors of PARP1/ 2 represent a class of anticancer 
agents that exert their cytotoxic effects by [CONTACT_605471]. Since the 
discovery of synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitors in BRCA -deficient cells and, more broadly, cells 
with homologous recombinat ion deficiency (HRD), accumulation of unrepaired SSBs resulting 
from catalytic PARP inhibition has been considered central to the mechanism of action of PARP 
inhibitors. More recently, it has been demonstrated that PARP inhibitors also trap PARP1 - and 
PARP 2-DNA complexes at DNA damage sites and that PARP trappi[INVESTIGATOR_605443] ( Pommier  et al, 2016 ; O’Connor,  2015 ; Lord and Ashworth, 2017 ). 
Version .[ADDRESS_801789] 
demonstrated sustained antitumor responses as a single agent in patients with BRCA1 - or 
BRCA2 -mutated tumors, while achieving a favorable safet y profile. Olaparib has been approved in 
the US as single agent for advanced ovarian cancer patients with a deleterious germline BRCA 
mutation; whereas, rucaparib has been approved for patients with a deleterious germline or somatic 
BRCA mutation ( Lynparza [olaparib] prescribing information  2017 ; Rubraca [rucaparib] 
prescribing information  2017 ). 
Aside from BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, other alterations can also result in HR D, which is 
characterized by ‘BRCA -like” genomic scarring. HRD does not only make cancer cells sensitive to 
PARP inhibitors but also to platinums, and shared mechanisms of resistance suggest that both 
classes of drugs have similar antitumor effects in canc ers with HRD ( Edwards  et al, 2008 ; 
Sakai  et al, 2008 ; Sakai  et al, 2009 ). This concept is supported by [CONTACT_605472] h BRCA -mutated ovarian cancer demonstrating that platinum 
sensitivity correlated with response and platinum refractoriness with an almost complete lack of 
response to olaparib ( Fong  et al, 2010 ; Gelmon  et al, 2011 ). In addition, rucaparib has been shown 
to be effective in platinum -sensitive ovarian cancer with BRCA -mutated patients deriving most 
benefit, followed by [CONTACT_605473] -HRD patients ( Swisher et al, 20 17). 
The strongest evidence that platinum sensitivity can predict clinical benefit from PARP inhibition is 
provided by [ADDRESS_801790] 
status ( Mirza  et al, 2016 ). Median PFS for niraparib in patients with germline BRCA -mutations was  
21.0 versus 5.5  months for placebo (HR 0.27; P < 0.001). An exploratory analysis for patients who 
were biomarker negative (germline BRCA -wild-type and HRD negative) showed a median PFS of 
6.9 versus 3.8 months (HR 0.58, P = 0.02). This led to the approval  of niraparib for the maintenance 
treatment of patients who are in a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to platinum -
based chemotherapy ( Zejula [niraparib] prescribing information  2017 ). Similar resul ts were recently 
reported for rucaparib in the ARIEL3 study. Median PFS for rucaparib in patients with BRCA -
mutant (germline or somatic) ovarian cancers was 16.6 versus 5.4 months for placebo (HR 0.23; 
P < 0.0001). In an exploratory analysis for patients w ho were biomarker negative (BRCA -wild-type 
and HRD negative), median PFS was 6.7  versus 5.4 months (HR 0.58, P = 0.0049) ( Coleman et al, 
2017 ). 
1.3. Biology of Gastric Cancer and PARP Inhibitors  
Gastric cancers have been clas sified, using the Lauren system, as intestinal, diffuse, or 
indeterminate — the vast majority of these being adenocarcinomas. The World Health Organization 
has also applied an alternative system dividing gastric cancer into tubular, papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], mucinous 
(colloid), or poorly cohesive carcinomas ( Hu et al, 2012 ); however, these classification systems 
have provided little clinical utility. Gastric cancer is largely associated with infectious agents such 
as the Helicobacter pylori  bacterium and Epstein -Barr virus (EBV), yet the frequencies of 
histological subtypes and distribution of associated H. pylori  or EBV infections vary greatly by

Page  23 of 108 geographical regions. Recently, The Cancer Genome Atlas group profiled a global population of 
295 primary gastric cancers ( Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014 ) and identified 
4 different subtypes according to various molecular characteristics. These were EBV -positive 
tumors, microsatellite unstable tumors , genomically stable tumors, and tumors with chromosomal 
instability (CIN). These subtypes were found in 9%, 22%, 20%, and 50% of gastric cancers, 
respectively. The CIN subgroup is distinguished by a high frequency of p53 defects and copy 
number variation (CNV), characteristic of DNA repair deficiency. While present across all 
histologies, the CIN subtype was most enriched in the intestinal subtype at the gastroesophageal 
junction.  
PARP inhibitors are particularly effective in tumors that have defects in D NA repair, specifically 
those that have HRD. Many genes are involved in homologous recombination repair including 
BRCA1/2, RAD51, PALB2, ATR, and ATM ( Lord and Ashworth, 2016 ). Defects in these genes 
lead to HRD and la rge scale CNV. Assessment of these “genomic scarring” patterns, including 
genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH), by [CONTACT_605474]. In the ARIEL2 single -arm Phase [ADDRESS_801791] (including non -BRCA  tumors) had a significantly improved 
clinical outcome compared with biomarker -negative patients ( Swisher et al, 2017 ). Moreover, in the 
NOVA and ARIEL3 randomized, switch -maintenance Phase [ADDRESS_801792] patients treated with the PARP inhibitors c ompared with placebo ( Mirza et al, 2016 ; 
Coleman et al, 2017 ).  
Since platinum -based therapy leads to DNA damage, it follows that platinum -sensitive tumors likely 
have a higher level of HRD and, thus, are more likely to respond to PARP inhibitors. This has been 
shown for BRCA -mutant patients where PARP inhibitor benefit is higher for those who are 
platinum sensitive compared with platinum -resistant patients ( Fong  et al, 2010 ). Indeed, acquisition 
of secondary mutations that restore the functionality of homologous recombination proteins 
including BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, and RAD51D have been found in both platinum - and PARP 
inhibitor -resistant disease ( Norquist  et al, 2011 ; Pennington  et al, 2014 ; Patch  et al, 2015 ; 
Quigley  et al, 2017 ; Kondrashova et al, 2 017). 
In gastric cancer, a recent study assessing LOH in platinum -treated patients indicated that patients 
with HRD may have improved clinical outcome ( Cafferkey  et al, 2016 ). Whereas this was a small 
study, there was a tr end to improved OS in those patients with a high level of LOH. The cutoff 
chosen in this study identified 14% of patients that had LOH high tumors. In addition, a BRCA 
mutational signature [CONTACT_605510] a frequency of approximat ely 7% to 
12% ( Alexandrov  et al, 2015 ). Loss of ATM expression, as defined by [CONTACT_9064] 
(IHC), has also been explored as an approach for identifying patients who may be sensitive to PARP 
inhibitors. Preclinical ly, there is an association with ATM deficiency and PARP inhibitor response

Page  24 of 108 (Kubota  et al,  2014 ). Interestingly, this is related to loss of ATM expression but not mutational 
status. ATM expression is lost in approximately 13%  to 21% of gastric cancers ( Kim et  al, 2013 ). 
Accordingly, Bang et al, 2015  assessed the clinical benefit of olaparib in a gastric cancer population 
enriched for ATM loss. Approximately half of the patients had loss of ATM expression as defined 
by a validated IHC assay. In a randomized Phase 2 study in 123  second -line metastatic gastric 
cancer patients, the combination of olaparib and paclitaxel significantly improved OS versus 
placebo and paclitaxel; whereas, the best improvement in OS was seen in patients with tumors with 
low or undetectable levels of ATM (ATM low) (HR 0.35; 80% CI, 0.22% -0.56%; P = 0.002; median 
OS, not reached versus 8.2  months, respectively). The subsequent randomized Phase  [ADDRESS_801793] ( Smyth et al, 2016 ). Together, these data suggest that a molecular subtype of 
gastric cancer exists that displays HRD and, thus, ma y be particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitor 
therapy.  
1.4. PARP Inhibitor BGB -290 
1.4.1.  Nonclinical Data for BGB -290 
BGB -290 is a potent and selective inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2 that sets itself apart from other 
PARP inhibitors by [CONTACT_605475] -trappi[INVESTIGATOR_605444].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Nonclinical Safety Data  
The nonclinical toxicity and toxicokinetic profile of BGB -290 was characterized in single - and up to 
91-day repeat -oral-dose studies in rats and dogs, and in a core battery of genotoxicity t ests, 
including in vitro Ames and chromosomal aberration assays, and in vivo bone marrow micronucleus 
assays in rats. Safety pharmacology assessments included in vitro human ether -à-go-go related gene 
(hERG) channel activity assays and in vivo studies of c ardiovascular function in dogs, as well as 
central nervous system (CNS) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_338474].  
The main toxicity findings were bone marrow inhibition that correlated with clinical pathology 
changes and gastrointestinal toxicity that  presented as emesis, decreased food consumption, and 
decreased body weight. The systemic exposure increased dose -proportionally without apparent sex 
differences or accumulation. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was considered to be 6  mg/kg in 
rats and 3 m g/kg in dogs for both 28 -day and 91 -day toxicity studies.  
BGB -290 was not mutagenic in the in vitro Ames (bacterial reverse mutation) assay, but clastogenic 
in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in the in vivo bon e 
marrow micronucleus assay in rats, which is consistent with its mechanism of action. PARP 
enzymes are involved in normal cellular homeostasis, such as DNA transcription, cell cycle 
regulation, and DNA damage repair. BGB -290 interacts with and inhibits th e enzymatic repair 
machinery that carries out detection and repair of SSBs.

There was no apparent inhibition of BGB -290 on hERG channel as the value of half -maximal 
inhibition concentration (IC 50) was 12.4 μM; for compa rison, the IC 50 of the positive control 
amitriptyline was 1.9  μM. No effects on blood pressure, heart rate, or electrocardiogram (ECG) 
findings were noted in telemetry -instrumented conscious dogs. No effects on CNS or respi[INVESTIGATOR_605445] -Dawley rats. No abnormal changes in the cardiovascular, CNS, or

No QT interval prolongation was noted in cardiovascular function studies in consciou s dogs and in 
28-day and 91 -day repeat -dose toxicity studies in dogs.  
In summary, all available toxicological studies and data are adequate to support clinical 
development of BGB -290 for treatment of patients with advanced cancer. Please refer to the

Biochemical and Cellular Inhibition of PARP Activity by [CONTACT_144275] -290 
BGB -290 potently inhibits enzyme activity of PARP1 a nd PARP2, with IC 50s of 1.3 and 0.92  nM, 
respectively ( Table  1). Most PARP inhibitors are able to trap PARP enzymes at damaged DNA 
sites, and these tr apped PARP -DNA complexes appear to be more cytotoxic than unrepaired DNA 
breaks caused by [CONTACT_338516] (Section  1.2). The PARP -trappi[INVESTIGATOR_605447] y of BGB -290 was 
measured by a fluorescence polarization binding assay, similar to the method described in the 
literature ( Murai  et al, 2012 ). BGB -290 showed potent PARP -trappi[INVESTIGATOR_338471] (with a half -maximal

BGB -290 is currently being studied in two Phase 1a studies (BGB -290-AU-002 in Australia, n  = 53 
[as of 30  September 2016] and BGB -290-102 in China, n  = 8 [as of 13 March 2017]), as well as one 
Phase 1 study, BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study_001, for the combination of BGB -290 with 
BGB -A317, an anti -PD-1 antibody (n  = 41 [as of 02 February 2017]). The study data from 
BGB-290-AU-[ADDRESS_801799] mature and key interim results are summarized below.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pharmacokinetics Data for BGB -290-AU-[ADDRESS_801800] -in-human Phase 1 study, interim PK data of BGB -290 showed that BGB -290 is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_605449]. The maximum serum concentration and the drug 
exposure (AUC) increased in a nearly dose proportional manner from 2.[ADDRESS_801801] of administration of a high -fat meal on the PK of BGB -290 after a 60 mg dose is being 
assessed. Preliminary data from 6 patients show that after administration with a high -fat meal, the 
rate of absorption was slower, as i ndicated by a delay in time to maximum concentration (T max) and 
lower maximum concentration (C max), but overall there was minimum impact on the extent of 
absorption. The mean Fed:Fasted ratios for C max and area under the plasma concentration -time from 
time [ADDRESS_801802] measurable concentration (AUC 0-last) were 0.63 (individual ratios ranged from 0.49 
to 0.85) and 0.85 (individual ratios ranged from 0.71 to 0.95), respectively. Based on 
pharmacodynamic data (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) with an apparent flat exposure -response for PAR inhibition 
and objective responses observed at lower dose levels, the decrease in C max and the modest decrease 
of 15% in overall e xposure with high -fat meal is not considered to be clinically significant. Thus,

convenience with the BID dosing schedule.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Exploratory Biomarker Data  
The PAR f ormation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was detected by 
[CONTACT_28745] -linked immunosorbent assay to explore the pharmacodynamic activity in the Phase  1 study 
BGB -290-AU-002. Blood samples for PK and isolation of PBMCs were obtained at baseline on  
Day 1 (predose) and 4 hours postdose on Days 1 and 17 of Cycle 1. The pharmacodynamic activity 
at 4 hours postdose on Days 1 and 17 was reported as percentage of predose PAR inhibition. 
PK/pharmacodynamic correlation analyses were conducted in [ADDRESS_801804] dose level of 2.5 mg BID. The pharmacodynamic activity increased in a dose -dependent

[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical Safety and Preliminary Efficacy for BGB -290-AU-[ADDRESS_801805] -in-human study evaluating BGB -290 to ch aracterize the safety, the 
MTD, preliminary antitumor activity, and the PK of BGB -290 given as a monotherapy in a 3+3 
dose escalation scheme. BGB -290 was administered in doses ranging from 2.5 to 120 mg PO BID.  
The study is being conducted in 3 Australian study centers, and preliminary data for 45 patients are 
available (cutoff date of 30 September 2016).  
The preliminary safety data indicate that the most frequent nonhematologic adverse events (AEs) 
( 10% of patients) assessed as related to BGB -290 were n ausea (51%, n  = 23), fatigue (29%, 
n=13), vomiting (18%, n  = 8), diarrhea (16%, n  = 7), and decreased appetite  (11%, n  = 5). 
Hematologic AEs are of interest in this study. The most frequent hematologic AEs ( 10% of 
patients) assessed as related to BGB -290 were anemia (22%, n  = 10) and neutropenia (11%, n  = 5). 
Hematologic AEs, regardless of relatedness, were reported in 40% of patie nts (n  = 18). Anemia was 
most frequent (33%, n  = 15), followed by [CONTACT_127867] (11%, n  = 5) and thrombocytopenia (2%, 
n = 1). 
Twenty-six patients experienced Grade 3 AEs (regardless of relatedness), and no Grade 4 AEs were 
reported. Eleven Grade 3 AEs in 9 patients (20%) were considered related to BGB -290: anemia 
(11%, n  = 5), neutropenia (7%, n  = 3), hypophosphatemia (2%, n  = 1), paresthesia (2%, n  = 1), 
nausea (2%, n  = 1), and fatigue (2%, n  = 1).  
Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 25 patients, and for 3 patients they were considered related to 
BGB -290: anemia (n  = 2) and nausea (n  = 1). Three patients discontinued study drug be cause of an 
AE: vomiting (n  = 1), oral paresthesia (n  = 1), and right neck cutaneous metastases (n  = 1). 
Four patients experienced a fatal AE  [ADDRESS_801806] BGB -290 dose. All deaths were due to 
complications of the underlying malignancy, and none  was considered related to BGB -290.

Page  31 of 108 Four patients experienced AEs that were considered dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs): Grade [ADDRESS_801807] medical therapy in 2 patients; Grade 2 anorexia and 
Grade 2 nausea in 1  patient, and Grade 2 nausea and Grade 2 paresthesia in 1 patient. Based on the 
encountered DLTs and the overall safety profile of BGB -290, the MTD of BGB -290 was 
determined to be 80 mg PO BID (160  mg/day).  
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (A ML) are recognized AEs in 
patients receiving PARP inhibitors  (Ricks  et al, 2015 ). To date, no cases of MDS or AML have 
been observed in any study that includes BGB -290. 
Ten patients achieved either a CR (n  = 2) or PR (n  = 8); all responses were observed in patients with 
gynecological cancers.  
1.5. Rationale for Selection of BGB -290 Dose  
Based upon the overall safety, efficacy, and PK profile of BGB -290, the dose of BGB -290 60  mg 
PO BID was selected using available clinical data from  Study BGB -290-AU-002 (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
The study determined the MTD of BGB -290 to be 80  mg PO BID (160 mg/day). The dose of 60 mg 
BID was selected  for further evaluation based on the following findings (refer to the BGB -290 
Investigator’s Brochure ): 
 A linear PK profile observed up to 80 mg BID  
 Similar toxicity profiles at 60 mg and 80 mg BID with th e following exceptions:  
o Fewer patients at 60 mg BID experienced treatment -related TEAEs of anemia and 
neutropenia.  
o There was a slightly higher rate of dose interruptions at 80 mg vs 60 mg BID for 
anemia and nausea.  
 Responses were observed across the dose range evaluated  
1.6. Study Rationale  
Inoperable locally advanced and metastatic gastric cancer continues to be an incurable disease with 
5-year survival rates below 10% despi[INVESTIGATOR_605450], necessitating the 
exploration of additional an d different therapeutic approaches. First -line platinum -based therapy can 
result in response rates around 30% to 50%. Treatment with a platinum doublet or triplet, however,

excellent PARP trappi[INVESTIGATOR_605452]. In the clinic, BGB -290 has shown favorable PK properties, has been 
tolerated well, and has achieved maximum pharmacodynamic target modulation in PBMCs at a 
dose level well below the recomm ended Phase 2 dose (10 versus 60 mg BID).  
The rationale for developi[INVESTIGATOR_605453] -[ADDRESS_801809] been reported in a small number (<  1%) of patients treated with PARP 
inhibitors, especially in patients harboring a germline BRCA mutation ( Ricks  et al, 2015 ). 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], patients who develop MDS and A ML while on therapy with a PARP inhibitor have a 
history of extensive previous chemotherapy and some have a history of previous cancer or bone 
marrow abnormalities. To date, there have been no reports of MDS or AML in patients treated with 
BGB -290. Patient s in this study will be monitored monthly for hematological toxicities and events 
of MDS and AML will be reported as SAEs irrespective of time elapsed since end of study 
treatment.

3.1. Summary of Study Design  
This is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized, multicenter, global Phase 2 study 
comparing the efficacy and safety of single -agent poly (ADP -ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor 
BGB -[ADDRESS_801813] achieved a PR that is maintained for ≥  4 weeks or a CR as 
determined by [CONTACT_605467] 
(RECIST) Version 1.[ADDRESS_801814]-line chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the 
study is PFS by [CONTACT_3138]. Sufficient tumor tissue (archival biopsy) must be provided 
for central laboratory determination of HRD status for randomization and exploratory biomarker 
analyses.  
Patients will be randomized  [ADDRESS_801815] -line chemotherapy. 
Cycles will be 28 days in length. Once the treatment phase has been completed, an end of treatment 
(EOT) visit should occur with subsequent phases of safety and long-term follow -up. 
Central randomization (1:1) will be used to assign eligible patients to 1 of the following 2 arms.  
Arm A:  BGB -290 60 mg PO BID  
Arm B:  Placebo [ADDRESS_801816] status (LOH high versus LOH low versus unknown), 
region (China/Hong Kong/Taiwan versus Australia/Europe/North America versus Japan/South 
Korea versus rest of world [ROW]), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status (0 versus 1).  
Safety assessments will occur on Day [ADDRESS_801817] (Section  9 and Appendix 1 ). AEs will be graded 
according to NCI -CTCAE Version 4.03. An external independent data monitoring committee 
(IDMC) will periodically review safety data.  
To confirm PK properties of BGB -290, blood samples will be taken at various time points as 
outlined in Section  7.6 and Appendix 1 . Additionally , tumo r tissue and blood samples will be 
obtained (as outlined in Section  7.7 and Appendix 1 ) to explore biomarkers of pharm acodynamics, 
response, and resistance to BGB -[ADDRESS_801818] Version 1.1 ( Appendix 2 ). 
Patients will undergo tumor assessments at screening and then every 8 weeks (±7 days), or as 
clinically indicated.

Page  35 of 108 There is no fixed duration of treatment.  
Administration of BGB -290 or placebo will continue until PD, unacceptable toxicity, death, or 
another discontinuation criterion is met (Sections  5.5 and 5.7). Once  the treatment phase has been 
completed, an EOT visit should occur within 7 days of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_605439] -290 or placebo with 
subsequent phases of safety and long -term follow -up.  
Long -term foll ow-up will include tumor assessments every 8 weeks (±7 days) for those patients 
without PD, survival status, new anticancer therapy, and diagnosis of MDS or AML. Long -term 
follow -up will continue until the patient dies or another criterion for discontinuat ion from study is 
met (Section  5.7). 
Once the study is completed and the study results are available, this study will be unblinded. For 
patients w ho have received BGB -290, the sponsor will continue providing the drug either on this 
study or through other options, ie, a roll -over study.  Subjects who are on the  Placebo arm  will 
discontinue the study treatment.   
Study procedures and assessments are det ailed in Section  7 and Appendix 1 . The study schema is

3.2. Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
Regular s afety monitoring (at least every 6 months) and efficacy monitoring will be performed by 
[CONTACT_41774]. The IDMC will review SAE reports for the first 40 patients enrolled in the study and 
review aggregate safety data approximately 3 months after the 40th patient started on study drug to 
assess the benefit /risk. The IDMC may recommend study modification including termination of the 
study due to safety and/or efficacy concerns. The function and membership of the IDMC will be 
described in the IDMC charter.

Page  37 of 108 In addition to the planned IDMC review(s), ad hoc rev iews may take place based on new 
information.  
Following IDMC review and discussion, the sponsor will make all final decisions regarding any 
change in study conduct. Please see the details in the IDMC charter.  
3.3. Blinding  
Site staff and blinded sponsor team m embers will be blinded to treatment allocation (BGB -290 or 
placebo).  
Unblinding of a patient’s treatment assignment may be performed at any time and without 
restrictions based on the investigator’s (or other non -study treating physician’s) clinical judgem ent 
if the knowledge of the treatment arm is essential for the further management of the patient.  
The investigator can access the IRT system using assigned credentials to immediately perform 
unblinding. Following unblinding, the system will notify the spo nsor of unblinding of the patient 
without revealing the patient’s treatment assignment. In the event that the investigator is not 
available to perform unblinding, each randomized patient is provided with a patient information 
card that includes a global ph one number linked to an after -hours physician -staffed emergency 
medical service. Additionally, the card provides a unique, blinded number that links to the subject’s 
treatment arm.  
Any physician treating a patient that is participating in the study (eg, em ergency room physician or 
other health care provider [HCP] unaffiliated with the study) can contact [CONTACT_605476]. The 
emergency service will perform this unblinding and inform the treating physician/HCP of the 
patient’s treatment assignment. If unblinding occurs, the service will provide notification to the 
sponsor of the patient -specific unblinding without revealing the patient’s treatment assignment.

 AEs 
 Pregnancy  
 Major protocol deviation  
 Patient withdrew consent for study treatment  
o Patients may voluntarily withdraw consen t from study treatment at any time  
o Patients should be requested to participate in the follow -up phase, if patient 
withdraws consent from the treatment phase only  
 Investigator’s discretion  
 Start of new anticancer therapy  
The reason for permanent discontinua tion of BGB -290 or placebo will be recorded on the electronic 
case report form (eCRF). Patients may discontinue study drug for other reasons but these will result 
in premature discontinuation from study (Section  5.7) and , consequently, result in lack of an EOT 
visit.

The EOT visit should occur within [ADDRESS_801828] not initiated new anticancer therapy 
will be follo wed for AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) as outlined in Section  9.3.[ADDRESS_801829], a safety follow -up will occur with the safety assessments outlined in Appendix 1 . If new 
anticancer therapy is inadvertently initiated before this safety follow -up (eg, without the knowledge 
of the study center team), a safety follow -up should be scheduled as soon as possible.  
For patients who do not want to or cannot return to the clinic for the safety follow -up, the patient 
should be contact[CONTACT_235272] a review of AEs. If t hese attempts of contact [CONTACT_311712],

Patients who were permanently discontinued from study drug for reasons other than PD and meet 
criteria otherwise (eg, discontinued for AE and no new anticancer therapy) will be followed with 
tumor assessments every 8 weeks (±7 days) until PD or any other  reason listed in Section  5.7, 
whichever occurs first. For efficacy assessments as per protocol, refer to Section  7.3.[ADDRESS_801832] the p atient by [CONTACT_69834]’s disease status

6.1. Study Drug  
6.1.1.  Packaging and Labeling  
BGB -290 is provided in 20 -mg capsules or matching placebo. BGB -290 and placebo capsules will 
be provided in 30 -count child -resistant high -density polyethylene bottles with an induction seal and 
bottle label. The contents of the label will be in accordance with all applicable local regulatory 
requirements. The label will include at a minimum: drug name, dose strength, contents, sponsor, 
protocol number, bottle number, directions for use, storage conditions, caution statements, retest or 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], and space to enter the patient number and nam e of investigator.  
6.1.2.  Handling and Storage  
The instructions for drug ordering are in the pharmacy binder. The IRT system will also be used for 
drug supply management. The study drug will be dispatched to a study center only after receipt of 
the required docum ents in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and the sponsor’s 
procedures. The investigator or pharmacist/designated personnel is responsible for maintaining the 
drug supply inventory and acknowledging receipt of all study drug shipments. All  study drugs must 
be stored in a secure area with access limited to the investigator and authorized study center 
personnel and under physical conditions that are consistent with study drug specific requirements.  
The study drugs must be kept at the conditi on as specified on the labels. BGB -[ADDRESS_801833] be stored at 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F) and protected from light.  
6.1.3.  Dosage and Administration  
Both BGB -290 and placebo capsules will be administered PO BID, once in the morning and once in 
the evening. The time difference between 2 consecutive doses should be approximately 8 to 
12 hours.  
Patients will be instructed to swallow the capsules whole, in rapid succession, with water. BGB -290 
can be administered with or without food.  
A dose of BGB -290 or placebo should be skipped if it is not taken within 2 hours of the scheduled 
time. An extra dose of BGB -290 or placebo should not be taken to make up for a missed dose. If 
vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, no re -dosing of the patient is a llowed before the 
next scheduled dose.  
On days with PK assessments, BGB -290 or placebo should be administered in the clinic in 
accordance with the schedule for the PK samples ( Appendix 1 ). 
6.1.4.  Dose Hold and Modification  
AEs should be assessed as best as possible regarding their relatedness to BGB -290 or placebo.

strong/moderate inhibitors of CYP3A or strong CYP3A inducers is not allowed. Please refer to the 
drugs/substances listed in Appendix 6  and to http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main -table/ 
for a more complete list of medications that are not allowed. Consumption of grapefruit and Seville 
oranges or their juices a re not allowed throughout the study. No other dietary restrictions will apply.  
6.2.3.  Medications to Be Used with Caution  
Based on preliminary in vitro screening assays, BGB -290 is not a strong inhibitor of other human 
CYP isoenzymes tested. It is a moderate inhi bitor of CYP2C9 (IC 50 = 6.48 M). Investigators need 
to be aware that BGB -290 has the potential to interfere with the appropriate metabolism of 
medications that rely on CYP2C9 and follow the prescribing information recommendations for use 
with CYP2C9 inhib itors. Therefore, careful monitoring should be used when co -prescribing 
CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, such as phenytoin and warfarin.  
Examples of these medications are listed in Appendix 7  and these should be used cautiously with 
drug concentration monitoring where appropriate.  
In addition to CYP3A, BGB -290 can also be metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C8 in human liver microsomes, 
but to a lesser extent. See Appendix 7  for medications that sho uld be used with caution for that 
reason.  
7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
7.1. Study Flow and Visit Schedule  
The study -specific assessments and procedures with allowed time windows are outlined in 
Appendix 1 . Assessments of efficacy will occur as  outlined in Section  7.3. Assessments of safety 
will be based on AE monitoring and reporting (including attribution of AEs and SAEs), physical 
examinations, vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory tests as outlined in Section  7.4.

Page  50 of 108 7.2. Patient Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
7.2.1.  Demographics  
Demographic data will include gender, date of birth (or age), and race/ethnicity.  
7.2.2.  Medical History  
Clinically significant medical history findings (eg, previous diagnoses, diseases, or surgeries) that 
were present before signing the ICF and con sidered relevant for the patient’s study eligibility will be 
collected and captured, including baseline severity if the finding is ongoing, in the eCRF. Clinically 
significant is defined as any events, diagnoses, or laboratory values that require treatment  or 
follow -up, or the presence of signs or symptoms that require medical intervention. Concurrent 
medical signs and symptoms must be documented to establish baseline severities.  
For gastric cancer history, the date of initial diagnosis and current disease status, staging, sites of 
disease, smoking history, prior anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_605457], responses, and duration 
of response to these treatments will also be recorded.  
7.2.3.  Other Baseline Characteristics  
Information will also be collected regardin g smoking history, prior medications/significant nondrug 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], childbearing potential ( Appendix 4 ), and any other assessments that are performed for the 
purpose of eligibility for inclusion in the study (Section  5), such as physical examination, vital 
signs, hematology, chemistry, pregnancy test, and ECG.  
7.3. Efficacy  
7.3.1.  Tumor Assessments  
Tumor imaging studies will be revie wed for the purposes of eligibility determination and on -study 
tumor monitoring. Following the screening tumor assessment, tumor assessments will occur at the 
schedule of every 8 weeks (±7 days) after Day 1. Any measurable disease must be documented at 
screening and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation. Patients who do not have PD at the 
time of BGB -[ADDRESS_801844] Version 1.1 ( Appendix 2 ). 
The same imaging method(s) used at screening must be used throughout the study. A documented 
standard -of-care tumor assessment may be used as the screening assessment provided it meets the 
requirements (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Determination of Eligibility  
The investigator and site radiologist will review tumor assessments to determine whether the patient 
achieved PR that is maintained for ≥  [ADDRESS_801845] be 
documented:  
 Tumor assessment that determined baseline disease state before initiation of first -line 
chemotherapy  
 Subsequent tumor assessments that demonstrate a CR or a confirmed PR to the first -line 
chemotherapy  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Screening Tumor Assessme nt 
The baseline tumor assessment should include the following:  
 Diagnostic -quality, contrast -enhanced CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Day -14 
to -1) 
o To be suitable for RECIST Version 1.[ADDRESS_801846], abdomen, 
and pelvis.  
o If a positron -emission tomography (PET)/CT scan is performed, the CT portion 
should meet the CT scan requirements described above.  
o In patients for whom the preferred CT scans are contraindicated because of, for 
example, a CT IV contrast allergy, a CT of the chest without contrast and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast are recommended.  
o MRI scans may be performed i n lieu of CT scans. At screening, tumor assessments 
should include a diagnostic quality, contrast enhanced MRI scan of the chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis. To be suitable for RECIST Version 1.[ADDRESS_801847] a maximum thickness of 5  mm and minimal gaps.  
 PET or whole -body radionuclide bone scan to evaluate for bone metastases, if clinically 
indicated (Day -14 to -1) 
o Only to be performed at screening if the patient has known bone metastases or has 
symptoms that could be due to bone metastases  
 CT scan of the neck, if clinically indicated (Day -14 to -1) 
o Only to be performed at screening if the patient has known or suspected metastases 
in this area  
o MRI scan of the neck may be substituted for CT scan of the neck.  
 MRI scan of the brain, if clinically indicated (Day -28 to -1) 
o Only to be performed at screening if the patient has symptoms that could be due to 
brain metastases  
o MRI is the preferred imaging method for tumor assessments of the brain.  
Version .[ADDRESS_801848] may be performed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  On-study Tumor Assessments  
All target and nontarget lesions must be assessed with the same imaging method used at baseline.  
 Diagnostic -quality, contrast -enhanc ed CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (every 8 
weeks ±7  days)  
o CT scan with IV contrast is preferred but the imaging method at screening 
determines the imaging method of subsequent tumor assessments and must be used.  
 Imaging of all other known sites  of disease (every 8 weeks ±7 days)  
In addition to the protocol -specified tumor assessments, CT scans or other imaging studies may be 
performed at the investigator’s discretion at any time as clinically indicated.  
7.3.2.  Survival Assessments  
Survival status of pa tients will be monitored through all phases of the study as outlined in Section  5 
and Appendix 1 . The date and cause of death will be recorded.  
7.3.3.  Quality of Life Assessments  
Patients will complete 3 questionnaires in the clinic on Day 1 of Cycle 1, then on the same schedule 
as tumor assessments, and at the EOT visit before any other study activities occur ( Appendix 1 ). 
Patients should be given sufficient instruction, space, time, and privacy for completion of the 
questionnaires. A study center team member should check for completeness of answers and 
encourage the patient to complete any missing answers. The questionnaires are validated 
instruments to measure the health status of patients (EQ -5D-5L; Appendix 8 ), the quality of life of 
cancer patients (EORTC QLQ -C30; Appendix 9 ), and gastric  cancer -specific symptoms or 
problems (EORTC QLQ -STO22; Appendix 10 ). 
7.4. Safety  
7.4.1.  Adverse Events  
Safety assessments should be performed at the study center visits indicated in Appendix 1 . 
All AEs and SA Es, regardless of their relationship to study drug, will be collected in the fashion and 
for the time periods outlined in Section  9. The accepted r egulatory definition of AEs and important 
additional requirements for SAE reporting are outlined in Section  9. 
7.4.2.  Physical Examination, Vital Signs, E COG Performance Status, Weight, and Height  
A complete or limited physical examination, vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure; pulse 
rate; and oral, temporal, or tympanic temperature), weight, height, and ECOG performance status 
will be perform ed at time points specified in Appendix [ADDRESS_801849] (including lungs), abdomen, extremities, skin, lymph nodes, cardio vascular status, 
and neurological status. A limited physical examination should be directed at the evaluation of 
symptoms or specific safety issues. Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded at each 
subsequent physical examination. New or wors ened abnormalities should be recorded as AEs if 
appropriate.  
ECOG performance status will be determined as outlined in Appendix 3 . 
7.4.3.  Electrocardiograms  
Single 12 -lead ECGs with assessment of PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval corrected for 
heart rate (QTc) will be obtained at the following timepoints: screening; predose and 2 hours 
postdose on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 15; and EOT. Additional ECG s will be performed if 
clinically indicated. To minimize postural variability, it is important that patients are resting and in a 
semirecumbant or supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636]  [ADDRESS_801850] to be repeated if it was performed 
within 14 days of the EOT visit.  
7.5. Laboratory Assessments  
On-study clinical laboratory evaluations starting from screening shall be performed by a central 
laboratory , as regionally available. An investigator may obtain safety laboratory results from their 
local laboratory as clinically indicated (eg, on the day of a patient’s visit before results are available 
from the central laboratory for dose modifications or AE/S AE monitoring). Results from the central 
laboratory will serve as the official study laboratory result, where available. If required by [CONTACT_13125], clinical laboratory evaluations performed by a local, instead of a central, laboratory are 
acceptable . 
A detailed description of the procedures for sample collection, handling, storage, and shipment of 
the laboratory samples and all material such as test tubes and labels is provided in the study manual.  
Laboratory assessments will be performed at the time  points specified in Appendix [ADDRESS_801851], blood urea nitrogen, chloride, 
creatinine, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphate, potassium, sodium, total bilirubin, and total 
protein.  
7.5.3.  Urinalysis  
Urinalysis includes blood, protein, ketones, glucose, red blood  cells, and white blood cell.  
7.5.4.  Pregnancy Testing  
The Clinical Trials Facilitation Group’s recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy 
testing in clinical studies include for females with childbearing potential the use of highly effective 
forms of  birth control ( Appendix 4 ). For women of childbearing potential, a screening serum 
pregnancy test must be obtained within [ADDRESS_801852] is required.  
7.6. Pharmacokinetics  
PK samples will be collected from patients at the following time points ( Appendix 1 ): predose 
(within 30  minutes before dose) and 2 hours (±30 minutes) postdose on Cycle 1 Day  1 and Cycle 1 
Day 15. The time of study drug administration on the day before Day  15 (Cycle 1 Day  14) must be 
recorded on the eCRF. Details concerning collection, handling, and processing of the PK plasma 
samples will be provided in the study manual. PK samples collected from patients assigned to 
placebo treatment will not be analyzed for BGB -[ADDRESS_801853] atus for randomization and the analysis of candidate predictive biomarkers. Archival tumor 
tissue shall be sent to the central laboratory for biomarker testing (either a formalin -fixed paraffin 
embedded block with tumor tissue [preferred] or, ideally, up t o 15 unstained slides). The most 
recent tumor block is preferred.  
Candidate markers will include, but are not limited to, those related to pharmacodynamics, 
response, or resistance to PARP inhibitors (eg, HRD signatures, ATM expression, LOH).  
Patients will  also provide blood samples to be processed into plasma and cell fractions for the 
analysis of genetic defects associated with gastric cancer, such as, but not limited to, HRD 
signatures and DNA repair deficiency.  
Instructions for the processing, storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_605458].

operating procedures, working practice documents, and applicable regulations and guidelines. Study 
center audits may be made periodically by [CONTACT_78265] r’s or the contract research organization’s 
qualified compliance auditing team, which is an independent function from the study team 
responsible for conduct of the study.  
8.1. Data Collection  
Data will be entered into the eCRFs in an electronic data capture (ED C) system.  
Data collection on the eCRF must follow the instructions described in the eCRF completion 
guidelines. The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical 
data entered on the eCRF. The investigator or des ignee must sign the completed casebooks to attest 
to its accuracy, authenticity, and completeness.  
Data contained in the eCRFs are the sole property of BeiGene and should not be made available in 
any form to third parties without written permission from BeiGene, except for authorized 
representatives of BeiGene or appropriate regulatory authorities.  
8.2. Data Management/Coding  
All final patient data, both eCRF and external data (eg, laboratory data), collected according to the 
protocol, will be stored at BeiGene at the end of the study.  
Standard procedures (including following data review guidelines, computerized validation to 
produce queries, and maintenance of an audit file, which includes all database modifications) will 
be followed to support accurate data collection. Data will be reviewed for outliers, logic, data 
inconsistencies, and completeness.  
During the course of the study, a study monitor will make study center visits to review protocol 
compliance, compare eCRFs against individual patient’s medical records, and ensure that the study 
is being conducted according to pertinent regulatory requirements.  
eCRF entries will b e verified with source documentation. The review of medical records will be 
performed in a manner to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained. Checking the eCRFs for 
completeness, clarity, and cross checking with source documents is required to mo nitor the progress 
of the study. Direct access to source data is also required for inspections and audits, and will be 
carried out giving due consideration to data protection and medical confidentiality.  
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for R egulatory Activities (MedDRA®) Version

9. SAFETY MONITORING AN D REPORTING  
The investigator is responsible for the monitoring and documentation of events that meet the criteria 
and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in this protocol.  
9.1. Adverse Events  
9.1.1.  Definition and Reporting of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study 
drug, whether con sidered related to study drug or not.  
Examples of an AE include:  
 Worsening of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition including an increase in 
severity, frequency, duration, and/or has an association with a significantly worse outcome  
 New conditi ons detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may 
have been present before the start of the study  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overd ose of either study drug or a 
concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE)  
When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation 
(eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory results , and diagnostics reports) relative to the AE or SAE. 
The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE or SAE in the eCRF. 
However, there may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_605459]. In this instance, all patient identifiers will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_605460].

Protocol Version 1.0  
  
Page  57 of 108 9.1.2.  Assessment of Severity  
The investigator will make an assessment of severity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study.  AEs and SAEs should be assessed and graded based upon the NCI -CTCAE Version 4.03.  
Toxicities that are not specified in the NCI -CTCAE will be defined as follows:  
 Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
interv ention not indicated  
 Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
 Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_605461]; disabling; limiting self -care 
activities of daily living  
 Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
 Grade 5: Death related to AE  
Note: The terms “severe” and “serious” are not syn onymous. Severity is a measure of intensity (eg, 
grade of a specific AE, mild [Grade 1], moderate [Grade 2], severe [Grade 3], or life -threatening 
[Grade 4]); whereas, seriousness is classified by [CONTACT_184760]. 
Seriousne ss serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations from the sponsor to 
applicable regulatory authorities as described in Section  9.2. 
9.1.3.  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the study drug and the occurrence of 
each AE or SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. 
Alternative causes, such as natural  history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, and 
other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the AE or SAE to the study drug will be 
considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the IB and/or product information for  
marketed products in the determination of his/her assessment.  
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to 
include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is very important that the investigato r always 
provides an assessment of causality for every SAE before transmission of the SAE report/eCRF to 
the sponsor since the causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements. The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_605462], amending the SAE report/eCRF accordingly.  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by [CONTACT_1694] “related” or “not 
related.” An AE is considered related  if there is “a reasonable possibility” that the AE may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_5257] (ie, there are facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest possible 
causation). A number of factors should be considered in making this assessment, including:  
 Temporal relationship of the AE to the administration of study drug/study procedure  
Version .0 VV-CLIN-022975 1
BeiGene, Ltd.  CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -290-303 13 February 2020  
Protocol Version 1.0  
  
Page  58 of 108  Whether an alternative etiology has been identified  
 Mechanism of action of the study drug  
 Biological plausibility  
An AE should be considered “related” to study drug if any of the fo llowing are met:  
 There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing 
factors can be ruled out.  
 There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is 
unlikely.  
 There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (eg, the AE occurred within a 
reasonable time after administration of the study drug). However, the influence of other 
factors may have contributed to the AE (eg, the patient’s clinical condition or other 
concomitant AEs).  
9.1.4.  Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
After the initial AE or SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each patient and 
provide further information to the sponsor on the patient’s condition.  
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/conta ct and designated as ongoing will be 
reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes or is considered 
chronic, the AE or SAE is otherwise explained, the patient is lost to follow -up, or t he patient 
withdraws consent. Once resolved, the appropriate AE or SAE eCRF page(s) will be updated. The 
investigator will ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated 
to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE  or SAE. This may include additional laboratory 
tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care 
professionals.  
The sponsor may request that the investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of the 
AE or SAE. The investigator is obligated to assist. If a patient dies during participation in the study 
or during a recognized follow -up period, the sponso r will be provided with a copy of any 
postmortem findings, including histopathology.  
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE report/eCRF, with 
all changes signed and dated by [CONTACT_093]. The updated SAE report/eCRF  should be resent to 
the sponsor within the time frames outlined in Section  9.5.[ADDRESS_801856] Abnormalities  
Abnormal laboratory findings (eg, hematology or chemistry) or other abnormal assessments (eg, 
ECGs, x -rays, or vital signs) that are judged by [CONTACT_605486] .0 VV-CLIN-022975 1

Protocol Version 1.0  
  
Page  59 of 108 recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definition of an AE (as defined in Section  9.1.1 ) or an 
SAE (as defined in Section  9.2). Cli nically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other 
abnormal assessments that are detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly 
worsen following the start of the study will be reported as AEs or SAEs. However, clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are associated with the 
disease being studied, unless judged by [CONTACT_605487]’s condition, or that are present or detected at the start of the study and do not worsen, will 
not be reported as AEs or SAEs. They should be reported as AEs or SAEs if they induce clinical 
signs or symptoms, need active intervention, require a dose hold or permanent discontinuation, or 
are clinically significant  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].  
The investigator will exercise his/her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an 
abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.  
9.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an AE in which the patient 
was at risk of death at the time of the AE. It does not re fer to an AE, which hypothetically might 
have caused death, if it were more severe.  
 Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91259]: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69783] (usually involving at least an 
overnight stay) to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not 
have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur 
during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13270], the AE is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was 
necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a preexisting condition that  did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an SAE.  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16739]/convenience considerations is not considered an SAE.  
o Scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study, including admissions for 
transfusion support or convenience, is not considered an SAE.  
 Results in disability/incapacity  
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance, such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental

Page  60 of 108 trauma (eg, sprained ankle), which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions, but do not 
constitute a substantial disruption.  
 Is a congenital anomaly/bi rth defect  
 Is considered a significant medical AE by [CONTACT_13656] (eg, 
may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above).  
9.3. Timing, Frequency, and Method of Capt uring Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events  
9.3.1.  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
After the ICF has been signed, but before initiation of study drug, only SAEs should be reported.  
After initiation of study drug, all AEs and SAEs, regardless of relationship to  study drug, will be 
reported until [ADDRESS_801857] questions:  
 How are you feeling?  
 Have you had any medical problems since your last visit?  
 Have you taken any new medicines since your last visit?  
9.4. Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
9.4.1.  Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
If a diagnosis is known at the time of reporting, this should be recorded in the eCRF (and SAE 
report, as applicable), rather than the individual  signs and symptoms (eg, record only hepatitis rather 
than elevated transaminases, bilirubin, or jaundice). However, if a constellation of signs and/or 
symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of 
reporting, e ach individual AE should be recorded as an SAE or AE on the eCRF (and SAE report, if 
applicable). If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should replace the individual signs and/or 
symptoms as the AE term on the eCRF (and SAE report, if applicable),  unless the signs/symptoms 
are clinically significant.  
9.4.2.  Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other AEs (eg, clinical sequelae or a cascade of AEs) should 
be identified by [CONTACT_5252]. For example,  if severe vomiting is known to result in 
dehydration, it is sufficient to record only vomiting as the SAE or AE on the eCRF (and SAE report, 
Version .0 VV-CLIN-022975 1
BeiGene, Ltd.  CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -290-303 13 February 2020  
Protocol Version 1.0  
  
Page  61 of 108 if applicable). However, if a patient initially has a nonserious AE, and it subsequently becomes an 
SAE, both AEs should be reported separately on the eCRF. The onset date of the nonserious AE 
should be recorded as the start date of the nonserious AE. The onset date of the SAE should be 
recorded as the start date when the nonserious AE becomes an SAE.  
9.4.3.  Persistent or R ecurring Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation 
time points. Such AEs should only be recorded once on the AE eCRF (and SAE report, if 
applicable). If a persistent AE worsens in grade,  the worst grade should be recorded for the entire 
event.  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation time points, and 
subsequently recurs. All recurrent AEs should be recorded separately on the eCRF (and SAE report, 
if applic able).  
9.4.4.  Disease Progression  
PD is measured as an efficacy endpoint and not considered to be an AE. However, if there are 
separate identifiable clinical sequelae that result from PD, those sequelae are reportable as AEs. For 
instance, a patient with pleural  effusion presents with shortness of breath. The cause of the shortness 
of breath is a pleural effusion resulting from PD. The AE term should be reported as “pleural 
effusion” instead of PD or metastasis to lungs. If a patient has a seizure that is determi ned to be 
associated with a brain metastasis, the term “seizure” should be recorded as the AE instead of PD or 
brain metastasis. If a patient experienced multi -organ failure due to PD, the term “multi -organ 
failure” should be reported as the AE instead of PD. Deaths that are assessed by [CONTACT_605488]. They should not be reported as an SAE. If deaths are assessed by [CONTACT_605489], whether they are assessed as related or not related to the study drug, they should be 
reported as SAE immediately.  
If there is any uncertainty regarding whether an AE is due to PD, it should be reported as an AE.  
9.4.5.  Death  
When recording a death as an SAE, the AE that caused or contributed to fatal outcome should be 
recorded as the single medical concept. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained 
at the time of reporting, record “unexplained death”.  
9.4.6.  Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Acute My eloid Leukemia  
Events of MDS or AML should be treated as medically serious, even if the patient is not admitted to 
a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. These events should be reported to the sponsor irrespective of the time elapsed since the 
end of study treatment (see Section  9.7).

9.5.2.  Completion and Transmission of the Serious Adverse Event Report  
Once an investigator becomes aware that an SAE has occurred in a patient, he/she will report the 
information to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_801859] all information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to 
receive additional information before notifying the sponsor or designee of the SAE and completing 
the form. The form will be updated when additional information is received.  
The investigator will always provide an assessment of caus ality at the time of the initial report as 
described in Section  9.1.[ADDRESS_801860] for

Page  63 of 108 SAE receipt is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of 
other patients are met.  
The investigator, or responsible person accordi ng to local requirements, will comply with the 
applicable local regulatory requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to regulatory authorities 
and the IRB/IEC.  
This protocol is being filed under an Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol amendment with  the 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Once active, a given SAE may qualify as an IND safety 
report if the SAE is both attributable to the study drug and unexpected. In this case, all investigators 
filed to the IND (and associated INDs for the same co mpound) will receive an expedited 
investigator safety report, identical in content to the IND safety report submitted to the FDA.  
Expedited investigator safety reports are prepared according to the sponsor’s policy and are 
forwarded to investigators as nec essary. Reports that have been unblinded to placebo treatment will 
not be expedited. The purpose of the report is to fulfill specific regulatory and GCP requirements 
regarding the product under investigation.  
When a study center receives an initial or foll ow-up report or other safety information (eg, revised 
IB) from the sponsor, the responsible person according to local requirements is required to promptly 
notify his/her IRB or IEC.  
Expedited Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUS ARs)  
BeiGene, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected, serious adverse 
reactions involving the study drug to all regulatory authorities and participating investigators in 
accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines and/or local regulatory 
requirements, as applicable. In addition, BeiGene or authorized designee will be responsible for the 
submission of safety letters to central independent ECs (IECs).  
The sponsor will notify investigators of all repor table SAEs. This notification will be in the form of 
an expedited safety report. Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the 
notice with other study -related documentation.  
The investigator and IRB/EC will determine whether the informed consent requires revision. The 
investigator should also comply with the IRB/EC procedures for reporting any other safety 
information.  
Suspected serious adverse reactions and other significant safety issues reported from the 
investigational product  development program will be reported by [CONTACT_134529] —either as expedited safety reports and/or in aggregate reports —to the relevant, 
competent health authorities in all concerned countries.  
9.6. Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female p atient or the partner of a male patient becomes pregnant while receiving study drug or 
within [ADDRESS_801861] dose of study drug, a pregnancy report form should 
be completed and expeditiously submitted to the sponsor to facilitate  outcome follow -up.

Page  64 of 108 Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, 
follow -up will be no longer than 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any premature 
termination of the pregnancy will be reported.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE.  
An abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should be alw ays reported as an SAE. 
Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a patient exposed to the study drug 
should be recorded and reported as an SAE.  
9.7. Poststudy Adverse Events  
A poststudy AE or SAE is defined as any AE that occurs outsid e of the AE/SAE reporting period, as 
defined in Section  9.3.1 . 
Investigators should follow -up patients for poststudy period cases of MDS and AML. If the 
investigator learns of any study drug -related SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient has 
been discharged from the study, he/she should notify the sponsor using the SAE procedure.  
9.8. Expedited Reporting to Health Authorities, Ethics Committ ees, and Investigators  
The sponsor will promptly assess all SAEs against cumulative study drug experience to identify and 
expeditiously communicate new safety findings to regulatory authorities, investigators, IRBs, and 
IECs based on applicable legislation . 
To determine the reporting requirements for individual SAEs, the sponsor will assess the 
expectedness of the SAEs using the BGB -290 IB . 
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS AND ANALYTICA L PLAN  
Details of the stati stical analyses will be included in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
10.1. Analysis Set  
 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set includes all randomized patients who are assigned to 
study drug (BGB -290 or placebo). The ITT Analysis Set will be used for all effica cy 
analyses unless otherwise specified in the statistical analysis plan.  
 Safety Analysis Set includes all patients in the ITT Analysis Set who receive any dose of 
study drug (BGB -290 or placebo). The Safety Analysis Set will be used for all safety 
analyse s. 
 Per-Protocol (PP) Analysis Set includes all patients in the ITT Analysis Set without major 
protocol deviations that impact assessment of efficacy. Criteria for exclusion from the PP 
Analysis Set will be determined and documented before the final analysi s of PFS. The PP 
Analysis Set will be used to perform sensitivity analysis for the OS and PFS endpoints.

PK parameters can be estimated.  
10.2. Covariates  
The following covariat es may be used to examine efficacy and/or safety in subgroups or covariate 
analyses if deemed appropriate:  
 Geographic region (China/Hong Kong/Taiwan vs Australia/Europe/North America vs 
Japan/South Korea vs ROW)  
 EGOG performance status at baseline (0, 1)  
 HRD status (LOH high vs LOH low vs unknown)  
 Age at baseline:  < 65, ≥ 65; < 75, ≥ 75  
 Race: White vs Asian vs others; Chinese vs Japanese vs White vs others  
 Measurable disease at baseline (yes, no)  
 IRT values and CRF values will be used for primary analyses a nd sensitivity/subgroup  
analyses, respectively  
10.3. Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy analyses will be conducted using the ITT Analysis Set unless otherwise specified. 
Primary efficacy analysis of PFS will use the investigator assessment of PD according to RECIST 
Version 1.1. Secondary efficacy analyses of ORR, time to response, and duration of response will 
use the investigator assessments of response and PD according to RECIST Version 1.1. All 
stratified efficacy analyses will incorporate the stratification facto rs used at randomization: HRD 
status (LOH high versus LOH low versus unknown), region (China/Hong Kong/Taiwan versus 
Australia/Europe/North America versus Japan/South Korea versus ROW), and ECOG performance 
status (0 versus 1), unless otherwise specified.  
10.3.1.  Primary Efficacy Analyses  
PFS is defined as the time from randomization to PD per RECIST Version 1.[ADDRESS_801862].  
The null and alternative hypotheses for the final PFS analysis are as follows:  
H0: HR (BGB -290/placebo) = 1

of Cancer Drugs and Biologics ( 2007 ). Data for patients without PD per RECIST Version 1.[ADDRESS_801865] inc orporating the randomized stratification factors will be used to compare 
treatment groups using the ITT Analysis Set. The HR and its 2 -sided 95% CI will be estimated 
using the stratified Cox -proportional hazards model. The median OS for each treatment grou p will 
be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and the 95% CI will be calculated using the 
Brookmeyer -Crowley method ( Brookmeyer and Crowley, 1982 ). 
A sensitivity analysis of OS will be conducted using the PP Analysis Set. 
TSST is defined as the time from randomization until the second subsequent anti -cancer therapy or 
death after next -line therapy. Subjects alive and without the 2nd anti -cancer therapy will be 
censored at last known alive.  
TSST will be assessed using a  stratified log -rank test in ITT Analysis Set. The HR and its 2 -sided 
95% CI will be estimated using the stratified Cox -proportional hazards model. The median for each 
treatment group will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and the 95% CI will be c alculated 
using the Brookmeyer -Crowley method ( Brookmeyer and Crowley, 1982 ). 
ORR  is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR or PR per RECIST 
Version  1.[ADDRESS_801866] 2 -sided

Only patients with response of CR or PR during the study will be included in duration of resp onse 
analysis. The median duration of response and its 2 -sided 95% CI for each treatment group will be 
provided.  
Time to response  is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented confirmed 
response of CR or PR per RECIST Version 1.[ADDRESS_801868] deviations, as appropriate.  
Population PK analysis may be carried out to include plasma concentrations from this study in an 
existing model. Additional PK parameters such as apparent clearance ( CL/F) of the drug from 
plasma and area under the plasma concentration -time curve from [ADDRESS_801869] -dose (AUC 0-12) 
may be derived from the population PK if supported by [CONTACT_33653].  
Exposure -response (efficacy or safety endpoints) analysis may be carried out  if supported by [CONTACT_33653]. 
The results of the population PK and exposure -response analyses may be reported separately from 
the clinical study report. Details of the PK analyses will be provided in a separate SAP.  
10.5. Exploratory Analyses  
10.5.1.  Health -related Quality of Life 
Patient reported outcomes will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -STO22 
questionnaires and the EQ -5D-5L health questionnaire. The scores from these questionnaires will be 
summarized descriptively.  
10.5.2.  Biomarkers  
Correlative biomarker analyses in tumor tissues and blood will be performed. A separate statistical 
analysis plan will outline details of the biomarker analyses.

and Investigators,” [ADDRESS_801873] of the Study and Ethics Approval  
This study will be  conducted in accordance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, 
including, where applicable, the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki.  
The investigator (or sponsor, where applicable) is responsible for ensuring that this protocol, t he 
study center’s ICF, and any other information that will be presented to potential patients (eg, 
advertisements or information that supports or supplements the ICF) are reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_69869]/IRB.  
The IEC/IRB must be constituted in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. The 
sponsor will provide the investigator with relevant document(s)/data that are needed for IEC/IRB 
review and approval of the study.  
Before the study drug(s) can be shipped to the study center, the sponsor or its authorized 
representative must receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_5196]/IRB approval, the approved ICF, and any other 
information that the IEC/IRB has approved for presentation to potential patients.  
If the protocol, the ICF, or any other information that the IEC/IRB has approved for presentation to 
potential patients is amended during the study, the investigator is responsible for ensuring the 
IEC/IRB reviews and approves, where applicable, these amended documents. The investigator must 
follow all applicab le regulatory requirements pertaining to the use of an amended ICF including 
obtaining IEC/IRB approval of the amended form before new patient consent to take part in the 
study using this version of the form. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_5196]/IRB approval of the amended I CF/other 
information and the approved amended ICF/other information must be forwarded to the sponsor 
promptly.  
11.2.3.  Informed Consent  
The investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from each individual 
participating in this study after ad equate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and potential 
hazards of the study and before undertaking any study -related procedures. The investigator must 
utilize an IRB/IEC -approved ICF for documenting written informed consent. Each ICF will be 
appropriately signed and dated by [CONTACT_12718]’s legally authorized representative and 
the person obtaining consent.  
Informed consent will be obtained before the patient can participate in the study. The contents and 
process of obtaining inform ed consent will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
11.2.4.  Investigator Reporting Requirements  
As indicated in Section  9.5, the investigator (or  sponsor, where applicable) is responsible for 
reporting SAEs to the IEC/IRB, in accordance with all applicable regulations. Furthermore, the 
investigator may be required to provide periodic safety updates on the conduct of the study at 
his/her study cente r and notification of study closure to the IEC/IRB. Such periodic safety updates 
and notifications are the responsibility of the investigator and not of the sponsor.  
Version .[ADDRESS_801874] be provided to each patient as part of the informed consent process, 
either as part of the ICF or as a separate signed document (for example, in the US, a study center 
specific HIPAA consent may be u sed). The investigator must assure that patients’ anonymity will be 
strictly maintained and that their identities are protected from unauthorized parties. Only patient 
initials, date of birth, and an identification code (ie, not names) should be recorded o n any form or 
biological sample submitted to the sponsor, IRB, or laboratory. The investigator must keep a 
screening log showing codes, names, and addresses for all patients screened and for all patients 
enrolled in the study.  
The investigator agrees that all information received from BeiGene, including but not limited to the 
IB, this protocol, eCRFs, the IND, and any other study information, remain the sole and exclusive 
property of BeiGene during the conduct of the study and thereafter. This information i s not to be 
disclosed to any third party (except employees or agents directly involved in the conduct of the 
study or as required by [CONTACT_2371]) without prior written consent from BeiGene. The investigator further 
agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prev ent the disclosure by [CONTACT_605494].  
11.2.6.  Electronic Case Report Forms  
For each patient enrolled, an eCRF must be completed and signed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_605463] a reasonable time period after data collection. This also applies to records for 
those patients those patients who discontinue the study early. If a patient withdraws from the study, 
the reason must be noted on the eCRF. If a patient is withdr awn from the study because of a 
treatment -limiting AE, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome.  
The eCRFs exist within an EDC system with controlled access managed by [CONTACT_338558]. Study st aff will be appropriately trained in the use of eCRFs 
and applications of electronic signatures before the study start and before being given access to the 
EDC system. Original data and any changes of data will be recorded using the EDC system, with all 
changes tracked by [CONTACT_135953]. The investigator attests that 
the information contained in the eCRFs is true by [CONTACT_338559]. After final database lock, the investigator will  receive a copy of the patient data on CD -
ROMs for archiving the data at the study center.  
11.2.7.  Drug Accountability  
The investigator or designee (ie, pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability of 
all used and unused study drug. This includ es acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study 
drug (quantity and condition), patient dispensing records, and returned or destroyed study drug. 
Dispensing records will document quantities received from BeiGene and quantities dispensed to 
patients, including lot number, date dispensed, patient identifier number, patient initials, and the

Information on any change in risk and/or change in scope must be provided to patients a lready 
actively participating in the study, and they must read, understand, and sign each revised ICF 
confirming his/her willingness to remain in the study.  
11.3.2.  Use of Information and Publication  
A clinical study report will be prepared and provided to the reg ulatory agency(ies) of participating 
countries. The sponsor will ensure that the report meets the standards set out in the ICH Guideline 
for Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports (ICH E3). Note that an abbreviated report may 
be prepared in certai n cases.  
The sponsor recognizes the importance of communicating medical study data, and therefore, 
encourages their publication in reputable scientific journals and at seminars or conferences. The 
Version .[ADDRESS_801875]’s publication provisions shall apply rather than this 
statement.  
11.4. Study and Study Center Closure  
Upon completion of the study, the monitor will conduct the following activities in conjunction with 
the investigator or study center personnel, as a ppropriate:  
 Return of all study data to the sponsor  
 Data queries  
 Accountability, reconciliation, and arrangements for unused study drug(s)  
 Review of study records for completeness  
 Return of treatment codes to the sponsor  
 Shipment of PK samples to assay lab oratories  
In addition, the sponsor reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue this 
study either at a single study center or at all study centers at any time for reasons including, but not 
limited to, safety or ethical issues or se vere noncompliance. If the sponsor determines such action is 
needed, the sponsor will discuss this with the investigator (including the reasons for taking such 
action) at that time. When feasible, the sponsor will provide advance notification to the invest igator 
of the impending action before it taking effect.  
The sponsor will promptly inform all other investigators and/or institutions conducting the study if 
the study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons, and will also inform the regulatory 
author ities of the suspension or termination of the study and the reason(s) for the action. If required 
by [CONTACT_5279], the investigator must inform the IEC/IRB promptly and provide the 
reason for the suspension or termination.  
If the study is prematu rely discontinued, all study data must be returned to the sponsor. In addition, 
arrangements will be made for all unused study drug in accordance with the applicable sponsor 
procedures for the study.  
Financial compensation to investigators and/or instituti ons will be in accordance with the agreement 
established between the investigator and the sponsor.  
11.5. Records Retention and Study Files  
11.5.1.  Study Files and Retention of Records  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to 
be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should be 
Version .[ADDRESS_801876] the following 2 categories: (1) investigator’s study file and (2) patient clinical 
source documents.  
The investigator’s stud y file will contain the protocol/amendments, eCRF and query forms, 
IRB/IEC, and governmental approval with correspondence, ICF, drug records, staff curriculum vitae 
and authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence.  
Patient clinic al source documents (usually defined by [CONTACT_5280]/safety parameters independent of the eCRFs) would include (although not be limited to) the 
following: patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic records, physician’s and nurse’s notes, appo intment book, original 
laboratory reports, ECG, electroencephalogram, x -ray, pathology and special assessment reports, 
consultant letters, screening and enrollment log, etc.  
Following closure of the study, the investigator must maintain all study records i n a safe and secure 
location. The records must be maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval, when needed (eg, audit 
or inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent review of data in conjunction with 
assessment of the facility, supportin g systems, and personnel. Where permitted by [CONTACT_306067]/regulations or institutional policy, some or all of these records can be maintained in a format 
other than hard copy (eg, microfiche, scanned, or electronic); however, caution needs to be 
exercised be fore such action is taken. The investigator must assure that all reproductions are legible, 
are a true and accurate copy of the original, and meet accessibility and retrieval standards, including 
regenerating a hard copy, if required. Furthermore, the inve stigator must ensure there is an 
acceptable back up of these reproductions and that an acceptable quality control process exists for 
making these reproductions.  
The sponsor will inform the investigator of the time period for retaining these records to comp ly 
with all applicable regulatory requirements. The minimum retention time will meet the strictest 
standard applicable to that study center for the study, as dictated by [CONTACT_1212], or the sponsor’s standard s/procedures; otherwise, the retention period will 
default to [ADDRESS_801877] notify the sponsor of any changes in the archival arrangements, including, but 
not limited to, the following: archiving at an off -site facility and transfer of ownership of the records 
in the event the investigator leaves the study center.  
If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study center for any or all of 
the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and BeiGene to store 
these in sealed containers outside of the study center so that they can be returned sealed to the 
investigator in case of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for the continued 
care of the patient, appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_493295].

a. Screening must occur within [ADDRESS_801897] Version 1.1, unacceptable toxicity, death, or another discontinuation criterion is met (Sections  5.5 and 5.7). A cycle is 28 days. 
Assessments shown for Cycle 3 apply to all subsequent cycles except for requi red tumor assessments that occur every 8 weeks ±7 days (every second cycle) 
and blood collection for biomarkers occurs only on D ay 1 of Cycle 4 (not any other Day 1 of  Cycle 3).  
c. Unscheduled visits may occur any time as necessary as per investigator decis ion or patient’s request for reasons such as assessment or follow -up of AEs. 
Study activities, as indicated by ‘X,’ should be performed based on the reason for the unscheduled visit. If PD is suspected,  imaging studies should be 
performed and blood for bio markers should be obtained as appropriate.  
d. The EOT visit should occur within [ADDRESS_801898] or other means (eg, clinic visit) approximately every [ADDRESS_801899] . 
Patients who were permanently discontinued from study drug for reasons other than  PD and meet criteria otherwise (eg, discontinued for AE and no new 
anticancer therapy) will be followed with tumor assessments every 8 weeks (±7 days) until PD or any other reason listed in Se ction  5.7, whichever occurs 
first. For efficacy assessments as per protocol, refer to Section  7.3. If the patient refuses to return for these tumor assessments or is unable to do so, every 
effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_605505]’s disease status and survival.  
Should attempts of telephone contact [CONTACT_605506] , the additional attempts detailed in Section  5.6.[ADDRESS_801900] to follow -up. 
g. Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure; pulse rate; and oral, temporal, or tympanic temperature) will be measured  before study drug administration 
and approximately 15 minutes before each collection of PK blood samples , if applicable, during the treatment period.  
h. ECGs will be obtained at the following timepoints: screening; predose and 2 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 1 5; and EOT. Additional 
ECGs will be performed, if clinically indicated.  
i. Hematology includes hemoglobin, platelet count, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and lymphocyte count.  
Chemistry includes albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, chloride, creatinine, glucose,

Urinalysis includes blood, protein, ketones, glucose, red blood cells, and white blood cells.  
j. For females of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test must be pe rformed at a central or local laboratory within [ADDRESS_801901] is required.  
k. Following the screening tumor assessment within 14 days before randomization, tumor assessments will occur at the schedule of  every 8 weeks (±7 days) 
after Day 1. Any measurable disease must be documented at screening and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation. The same imaging method(s) 
used at screening must be used throughout the study. A documented standard -of-care tumor assessment may be used as the screening assessment provided it 
meets protocol requirements (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). CT scan with IV contrast is the preferred imaging method for assessment of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. 
Other im aging methods are allowed as outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . Imaging of other areas of disease should be performed as clinically indicated. Patients 
without PD at the EOT visit should be followed with tumor assessments every 8 weeks (± 7 days) during the long -term follow -up phase.  
l. PET scan or whole -body radionuclide bone scan must be performed at screening if the patient has known bone metastases or h as symptoms that could be due 
to bone metastases. If bone metastases are present at baseline, they must be followed on study using the same imaging method as at baseline.  
m. MRI scan of the brain to assess for brain metastases must be performed at screening i f the patient has symptoms that could be due to brain metastases. CT 
scan with IV contrast is acceptable if MRI is not available or the patient is claustrophobic.  
n. AEs and laboratory safety measurements will be recorded at each study visit, graded per NCI -CTCAE Version 4.03, and assessed as outlined in Section  9. 
After the informed consent form has been signed, but before initiation of study drug, only SAEs should be reported. After ini tiation of study drug, all AEs 
and SAEs, regardless of relationsh ip to study drug, will be reported until [ADDRESS_801902] dose of study drug will 
be recorded. Concomitant medications include subsequent anticancer therapy information acquired durin g the long -term follow -up phase.

Page  88 of 108 APPENDIX  2. THE RESPONSE EVALUAT ION CRITERIA IN SOLI D TUMORS (RECIST) 
GUIDELINES, VERSION 1.1 
The text below was obtained from the following reference: Eisenhauer EA, Therasse P, Bogaerts J, et 
al. New response evaluation criteria in solid tumors: revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). Eur J 
Cancer . 2009;45:228 -247 ( Eisenhauer et al, 2009 ). 
DEFINITIONS  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed by 
[CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) Committee (Version 1.1). Changes in 
only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the 
RECIST criteria. Note: Lesions are either measurable or nonmeasurab le using the criteria provided 
below. The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because it does not 
provide additional meaning or accuracy.  
Measurable Disease  
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (lon gest diameter in the plane 
of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
 [ADDRESS_801904] scan (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI (no less than double the slice 
thickness and a minimum of 10 mm).  
 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (when superficial).  
 [ADDRESS_801905] x -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]).  
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be 15 mm in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) scan  (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in fo llow-up, only the short 
axis will be measured and followed.  
Nonmeasurable Disease  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter 10 to <15 mm with 
conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_801906] scan), are considered nonmeasurable disease. 
Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural, or pericardial ef fusion, inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdom inal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by 
[CONTACT_605508].  
Bone lesions:  
 Bone scan, positron -emission tomography (PET) scan, or plain films are not considered 
adequ ate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be 
used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.  
Version .0 VV-CLIN-022975 1

BGB -290-303 13 February 2020  
Protocol Version 1.0  
  
Page  89 of 108  Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, 
that can be evaluat ed by [CONTACT_605509] (MRI) can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue 
component meets the definition of measurability described above.  
 Blastic bone lesions are nonmeasurable.  
Cystic lesions:  
 Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor nonmeasurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 Cystic lesions thought to represent cysti c metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if noncystic 
lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
Lesions with prior local  treatment:  
 Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
locoregional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion. Trial protocols should detail the  conditions under 
which such lesions would be considered measurable.  
Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total should be 
identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target le sions should be selected 
on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organ, 
but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures that may be visible 
by [CONTACT_33490]. Pathological nodes that are defined as measurable and 
may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of  a short axis of [ADDRESS_801907] i n which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is 
almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal). 
The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For example, an abdom inal node which is reported 
as bei ng 20 mm × 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. 
In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes 
(those with short axis 10 mm but <1 5 mm) should be considered nontarg et lesions. Nodes that 
have a short axis <10 mm are considered nonpathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and report ed as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline 
Version .0 VV-CLIN-022975 1
BeiGene, Ltd.  CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -290-303 13 February 2020  
Protocol Version 1.0  
  
Page  90 of 108 sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in t he 
measurable dimension of the disease.  
Nontarget Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
nontarget lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these 
lesions should be followed as “present”, “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal progression” (more 
details to follow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple nontarget lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the electronic case report  form (eCRF) (eg, “multiple enlarged pelvic 
lymph node” or “multiple liver metastases”).  
GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATION OF MEASURABLE DISEASE  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All 
baseline evaluations  should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more 
than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at b aseline and during follow -up. Imaging based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_12148].  
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be c onsidered measurable when they are superficial and 
P10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (eg, skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. 
As noted a bove, when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_197302], imaging 
evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of 
the trial.  
Chest x -ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest x -ray, particul arly when progression is an important 
endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than x -ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, 
lesions on chest x -ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by 
[CONTACT_6776].  
CT, MRI : CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the 
assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_801908] slice thickness greater than 
5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also 
acceptable in certain situations (eg, for body scans).  
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and s hould not be used as a method 
of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent 
review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the 
same technique and measurements w ill be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are 
identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is 
concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instan ces.

Page  91 of 108 Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised. However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are 
obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurre nce following complete response (CR) or 
surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response. If markers 
are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in CR. 
Because tumor markers are disease specific, instructions for their measurement should be 
incorporated into protocols on a disease specific basis. Specific guidelines for both CA -125 
response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and prostate -specific antigen response (in recurrent prostate 
cancer), have been published. In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -
[ADDRESS_801909] -line 
trials in ov arian cancer.  
Cytology, histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial response (PR) 
and CR in rare cases if required by [CONTACT_990] (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as 
germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). When effusions are known to 
be a potential adverse effect of treatment (eg, with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis 
inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease (SD) in order to differentiate between response (or SD) and progressive disease (PD).  
RESPONSE CRITERIA  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
CR: Disappearance of al l target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or nontarget) 
must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum diameters.  
PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to 
the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have  the actual short axis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if 
the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nodes are included as 
target lesions, the “sum” of lesions may no t be zero even if CR criteria are met, since a normal 
lymph node is defined as having a short axis of <[ADDRESS_801910] achieve a short axis <10 mm. For PR, SD, and 
PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions.

Page  92 of 108 Target lesions that become “too small to measure”: While on study, all lesions (nodal and non -
nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recor ded at each subsequent 
evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which 
are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not 
feel comfortable assigning an exact measu re and may report them as being “too small to measure”. 
When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded on the eCRF. If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12002], the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. If 
the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 
mm should be assigned (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they 
usually have a definable size when normal and are fr equently surrounded by [CONTACT_104178]; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small 
to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well). This default 
value is deri ved from the [ADDRESS_801911] slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice 
thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potentially nonreproducible; therefore, providing 
this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based up on measurement error. To 
reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, 
even if it is below 5 mm.  
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment: When non -nodal lesions “fragment”, the longest 
diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. 
Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining 
maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesio ns have truly coalesced such 
that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the 
maximal longest diameter for the “coalesced lesion”.  
Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions  
While some nontarget lesions may actually  be measurable, they need not be measured and instead 
should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol.  
CR: Disappearance of all nontarget lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph 
nodes must be nonpatholo gical in size (<10 mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more nontarget lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
PD: Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of existing nontarget lesions.  
When the pati ent also has measurable disease: In this setting, to achieve “unequivocal progression” 
on the basis of the nontarget disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in 
nontarget disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target dis ease, the overall tumor burden 
has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest “increase” in the size of one 
or more nontarget lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. The 
designation of over all progression solely on the basis of change in nontarget disease in the face of 
SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.

Page  93 of 108 When the patient has only nonmeasurable disease: This circumstance arises in some Phase [ADDRESS_801912] measurable disease. The same general concept apply 
here as noted above, however, in this instance there is no measurable disease assessment to factor 
into the interpretation of an increase in nonmeasurable disease burden. Because worsening in 
nontarget disease cannot be easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]: if all lesions are truly nonmeasurable) a 
useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consider if 
the increase in overall disea se burden based on the change in nonmeasurable disease is comparable 
in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease: ie, an 
increase in tumor burden representing an additional 73% increase in “volume” (which is equ ivalent 
to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural 
effusion from “trace” to “large”, an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, 
or may be described in protocols as “sufficient to req uire a change in therapy”. If “unequivocal 
progression” is seen, the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While it 
would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to nonmeasurable disease, the very nature of that 
disease ma kes it impossible to do so; therefore, the increase must be substantial.  
New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments 
on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for  the identification of new 
radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not 
attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to 
represent something other than tumor ( for example, some “new” bone lesions may be simply 
healing or flare of preexisting lesions). This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline 
lesions show PR or CR. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report 
as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not.  
A lesion identified on a follow -up trial in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is 
considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the patient who 
has visceral d isease at baseline and while on trial has a CT or MRI brain ordered which reveals 
metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if he/she did 
not have brain imaging at baseline.  
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow -up 
evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely a 
new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.  
While FDG -PET (PET scanning with the tracer fluorine -18 [F -18]fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]) 
response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of 
FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progressio n (particularly possible 
“new” disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the 
following algorithm:  
 Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the 
Version .[ADDRESS_801913] scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring 
at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan). If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a preexisting site of disease on C T that is 
not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the study drug treatment 
until the end of treatment taking into acc ount any requirement for confirmation. On occasion a 
response may not be documented until after the end of therapy so protocols should be clear if post -
treatment assessments are to be considered in determination of best overall response. Protocols must 
specify how any new therapy introduced before progression will affect best response designation. 
The patient’s best overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both target and 
nontarget disease and will also take into consideration the appearan ce of new lesions. Furthermore, 
depending on the nature of the trial and the protocol requirements, it may also require confirmatory 
measurement. Specifically, in nonrandomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, 
confirmation of PR or CR is need ed to deem either one the “best overall response”.  
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the patient is known. Best response 
determination in trials where confirmation of CR or PR IS NOT required: Best response in these 
trials is de fined as the best response across all time points (for example, a patient who has SD at 
first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last assessment has a best overall response of 
PR). When SD is believed to be best response, it must also meet the protocol specified minimum 
time from baseline. If the minimum time is not met when SD is otherwise the best time point 
response, the patient’s best response depends on the subsequent assessments. For example, a patient 
who has SD at first assessment, PD at  second and does not meet minimum duration for SD, will 
have a best response of PD. The same patient lost to follow -up after the first SD assessment would 
be considered unevaluable.

Page  95 of 108  
Note: When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to 
“normal” size (<10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This measurement 
should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression should it 
be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this means that patients with CR may not 
have a total sum of “zero” on the eC RF. 
In trials where confirmation of response is required, repeated ‘not evaluable (NE)’ time point 
assessments may complicate best response determination. The analysis plan for the trial must 
address how missing data/assessments will be addressed in determ ination of response and 
progression. For example, in most trials it is reasonable to consider a patient with time point 
responses of PR -NE-PR as a confirmed response.  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatm ent without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic 
deterioration”. Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response: 
it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_397699].  
Conditions that define “early progression, early death, and inevaluability” are trial specific and 
should be clearly described in each protocol (depending on treatment duration , treatment 
periodicity).  
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When 
the evaluation of CR depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be 
investigated (fine needle aspir ate/biopsy) before assigning a status of CR. FDG -PET may be used to 
upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic 
abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. The use of FDG -PET in this circu mstance 
should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_334352]. However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to 
false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/ sensitivity.  
For equivocal findings of progression (eg, very small and uncertain new lesions, cystic changes, or 
necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment. If at the 
next scheduled assessment, pro gression is confirmed, the date of progression should be the earlier 
date when progression was suspected.  
CONFIRMATORY MEASUREMENT/DURATION OF RESPONSE  
Confirmation  
In nonrandomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR and CR i s 
required to ensure responses identified are not the result of measurement error. This will also permit 
appropriate interpretation of results in the context of historical data where response has traditionally 
required confirmation in such trials. However,  in all other circumstances, ie, in randomized trials 
(Phase 2 or 3) or trials where stable disease or PD are the primary endpoints, confirmation of 
Version .[ADDRESS_801914] once after tria l entry at a 
minimum interval (in general not less than 6 weeks).  
Duration of Overall Response  
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that r ecurrent or PD is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded on study).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that recurrent disease is  objectively documented.  
Duration of Stable Disease  
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (in randomized trials, from date of 
randomization) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on 
study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of PD).  
The clinical relevance of the duration of stable disease varies in different studies and diseases. If the 
proportion of patients achieving stable disease for a minimum period o f time is an endpoint of 
importance in a particular trial, the protocol should specify the minimal time interval required 
between two measurements for determination of stable disease.  
Note: The duration of response and stable disease as well as the progres sion-free survival are 
influenced by [CONTACT_150065] -up after baseline evaluation. It is not in the scope of this 
guideline to define a standard follow -up frequency. The frequency should take into account many 
parameters including disease types and  stages, treatment periodicity, and standard practice. 
However, these limitations of the precision of the measured endpoint should be taken into account if 
comparisons between trials are to be made.

CHILDBEARING POTENTI AL”, “NO CHILDBEARIN G POTENTIAL”  
Contraception Guidelines  
The Clinical Trials Facilitation Group’s recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy 
testing in clinical trials include the use of highly effective forms of birth control. These methods 
include the following:  
 Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
the inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or tran sdermal)  
o Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation 
(oral, injectable, or implantable)  
 Intrauterine device  
 Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Vasectomized male partner  
 Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of exposure associated with the study treatment)  
NOTE: Total sexual abstinence should only be used as a contraceptive    
method if it is in line with the patient’s usual and pref erred lifestyle.  
Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods), 
declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to study drug, and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.  
Of note, barrier con traception (including male and female condoms with or without spermicide) is 
not considered a highly effective method of contraception and if used, this method must be 
combined with another acceptable method listed above.  
Definitions of “Women of Childbear ing Potential", “Women of No Childbearing Potential”  
As defined in this protocol, “women of childbearing potential” are female patients who are 
physiologically capable of becoming pregnant.  
Conversely, “women of no childbearing potential” are defined as f emale patients meeting > 1 of the 
following criteria:  
 Surgically sterile (ie, through bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy, or 
hysterectomy)  
 Postmenopausal, defined as:  
o ≥ 55 years of age with no spontaneous menses for ≥  12 months OR  
o < 55 years o f age with no spontaneous menses for ≥  12 months AND with a 
postmenopausal  follicle -stimulating hormone concentration >  30 IU/mL

(CKD -EPI) EQUATION  
In adults, the most widely -used equations for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 
serum creatinine are the Chronic Kidney Disease Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10444] (CKD -EPI) 
equation1 and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation. The National 
Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP) calculators rely on creatinine determin ations which 
are isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) traceable. All laboratories should be using creatinine 
methods calibrated to be IDMS traceable. Read more about creatinine standardization.  
This CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_397729]/dL. This equation is 
recommended when eGFR values above 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 are desired.  
GFR = 141 × min (Scr /κ, 1)α × max(Scr /κ, 1)-1.209 × 0.993Age × 1.018 [if female] × 1.159 [if black]  
where:  
Scr is serum creatinine in mg/dL,  
κ is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males,  
α is -0.329 for females and -0.411 for males,  
min indicates the minimum of Scr /κ or 1, and  
max indicates the maximum of Scr /κ or 1.  
The equation does not require weight because the results are reported normalized to 1.73 m2 body 
surface area, which is an accepted average adult surface area.

35-[ADDRESS_430227] Disease Compared to  Conte mporary 
Controls in Subjects Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (alloHSCT) 
Name [CONTACT_346377]-2001  
Protocol Number  RGI-2001-003  
Phase  Phase 2  
Indication  Prevention of Acute Graft –versus-Host Disease following 
alloHSCT  
Study Centers  This study will be conducted at 8- 12 sites in the United 
States.   
Study Rationale:  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_346308], the incidence of acute GvHD remains 
high.  Thus, improvements in the prevention of the disease 
constitutes a high unmet medi cal need.  
Studies in both humans and mice have confirmed the pi[INVESTIGATOR_346309]4+Foxp3+ Treg cells play in controlling GvHD 
(
Socié  2009 ). However, the developm ent of Treg cell -based 
therapeutic modalities has been hampered, in part, b y the small 
numbers of these cells. RGI -2001 is a liposomal form 
designed to deliver RGI -7000, which is an immunomodulatory 
compound that may promote the proliferation of Tregs in 
donor bone marrow and the development of tolerance to 
alloantigens and therefore constitutes a novel approach to the prevention of GvHD . 
Objectives  Endpoints  
Primary 
• To assess the potential efficacy of 
RGI-[ADDRESS_430228] 
of care (SOC) vs SOC for the 
prevention of acute GvHD (aGvHD)
 
• To characterize the safety and tolerability of 6 weekly 
intravenous (IV) infusions of • Efficacy: Grades II -IV aGvHD by [CONTACT_2006] 100 according to 
the Modified Keystone Criteria  (Przepi[INVESTIGATOR_12776]  1995 ) 
• Safety: Incidence, nature, an d severity of 
treatment-emergent AEs, SAEs, laboratory test values, vital-sign measures, and graft failure 
 
 
 
  
RGI-2001-[ADDRESS_430229]  
Secondary  
• To assess the potential efficacy of 
RGI-2001 in addition to SOC  vs 
SOC for the prevention of 
chronic GvHD (cGvHD) according to the secon dary 
endpoints listed
 
• To assess the survival of subjects who received RGI -2001 in 
addition to SOC vs SOC 
 
• To evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD)  effects 
of weekly dosing of RGI -2001
 • Grades II -IV aGvHD by [CONTACT_2006] 180 according to the  
Modified Keystone Criteria  
• Total and moderate -severe cGvHD at 6 months and 1 year 
according to the 2014 NIH criteria for cGvHD  
• Non-relapse mortality (NRM) rates at Day 100, 6 months 
and 1 year  
• Disease-free survival (DFS) at 6 months and 1  year  
• GvHD-free, relapse free survival (GRF S) at 6  months and 
1 year  
• Overall survival (OS) at 6 months and 1 year  
• Change from baseline in the percentage of CD4+CD25+CD45RA+ CD127-LO T cells (naive Tregs) 
on Days 14, [ADDRESS_430230]. Study subjects will be compared to a 
contem poraneous set of controls from the Center for 
International Bone and Marrow Transplant Research 
(CIBMTR) that is derived using the same eligibility criteria

Final Version  2.0 Proprietary and Confidential  06 March 2020  
used for this study. The study will include  a Safety Run -in 
Phase and an Expansion Phase.  
Safety Run-in Phase:  
Subjects will receive open-label RGI -2001 at a dose of 100μg  
/kg, via 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion on a weekly basis 
for [ADDRESS_430231] of care (SOC ) GvHD 
prophylactic regimen. The first dose will be administered on 
Day 0 , approximately  30 minutes  and no later than 1 hour  after 
hematopoi etic stem cell transplant (HSCT ) infusion. 
Subsequent doses will be administered  weekly, on Days 7, 14, 
21, 28 and 35.  
Up to two cohorts of 3 subjects each will be enrolled to the Safety Run -in Phase. Initially, 3  subjects will be enrolled, 
treated and assessed for dose -limiting toxicities through Day 
30 (dose limiting toxicity [DLT] window). A safety review 
committee (SRC) will examine all relevant safety data after 
the 3rd subject has reached D ay 30. As a rough guide, a DLT 
rate on the order of 20% or les s would be considered as 
acceptable. Therefore, if [ADDRESS_430232] 3 subjects , consideration will be given to 
enrolling up to 3 additional subjects. However, this decision will not be made solely on the observed occurr ence (or lack 
of) DLTs; rather the SRC will consider the totality of the 
safety data before arriving at a definitive conclusion regarding 
enrollment of additional subjects at the dose of 100μg  /kg. If 
within the first 3 subjects, 1 or more DLT  are observed, then 
consideration will be given to use of an alternative dose and/or dosing schedule, with the ultimate decision being made by [CONTACT_203851]. If an alternate dose and/or schedule is used, the same process as described above will be used.  If the addit ional 3 
subjects (beyond the initial 3) are allowed to enroll at the dose 
of 100μg  /kg or a lower dose and/or alternative schedule, 
safety data after the 6th subject has completed all 6 doses, as 
well as initial efficacy, PK and PD data will be evaluated i n 
coming to a recommendation regarding proceeding to the Expansion Phase, with this recommendation made by [CONTACT_12217].  
Definition of Dose -limiting Toxicities  
The fo llowing DLT criteria apply  to the Sa fety Run -in Phase 
of the study.  A DLT is defined as any treatment -related AE 
that is not attributable to an extraneous cause (e.g., disease 
progression, preparatory regimen or HSCT infusion) and also excludes any signs and symptoms of GvHD.  A DLT is an 
adverse event occurring in the period of [ADDRESS_430233] 1 of the 
following NCI  CTC (Version  5.0) criteria: 
• Grade 3+ infusion -related/cytokine release reactions  
 
 
  
RGI-2001-003   
Page 14 of 84 
 
 
Final Version  2.0 Proprietary and Confidential  06 March 2020  
• Graft failure (as defined in Sectio n 9.4.1 ) 
• Any Grade 4 -5 non-hematological AE  
• Delay in dosing by >  2 weeks due to treatment -related AE 
that is not attributable to an extraneous cause  
Expansion Phase:  
Once a dose/schedule is determined by [CONTACT_346344]/PK profile, enrollment will continue in the Expansion Phase and be extended to all sites.   
Accrual is targeted at 50 subjects who receive the dose 
deemed as acceptable from the Safety Run -in Phase (44 in the 
Expansion Phase, 6 from the Safety Run-in Phase at the dose 
used in expansion).   
Subjects will receive open -label RGI -2001 at a dose of 
100μg /kg, via 30 -minute intravenous (IV) infusion on a 
weekly basis for 6 doses (or an alternative dose/schedule as determined in the run-in phase) in addition to a SOC GvHD prophylactic regimen. The first dose will be administered on Day [ADDRESS_430234] infusion. Subse quent doses will be administered 
weekly, on Days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35.  
Control Group:  
A non-randomized, contemporary control group from the CIBMTR database will be derived for comparison. Control  
subjects will be chosen so as to meet all eligibility requir ements for the clinical trial, have received a transplant in 
the same time window as the study subjects, and have been transplanted in a center that participates in this study. Consent 
will be obtained via the CIBMTR to participate in this study . 
Number o f Subjects  A total of [ADDRESS_430235], including a 6 -week treatment period and 
a 42-week follow-up period.  In addition, there is a screening

Final Version  2.[ADDRESS_430255] Disea se 
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( alloHSCT) is an important therapeutic 
option, and, in some indications , the only potentially curative therapy, for the treatment of a 
variety of hematologic malignancies, including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In the U.S. approximately 8,[ADDRESS_430256] s with 
intensive chemo radiotherapy  and from potent graft- versus -leukemia (GVL) effects mediated by 
[CONTACT_346346]. Donor T cells in the infused stem cell graft are used to attack malignant cells, 
but m ay also strike  normal host tissues and  organs, resulting in graft versus host disease ( GvHD).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_346316], GvHD , acute or chronic, is one of the leading 
causes of morbidity and mortality from alloHSCT.  
Five phases of the development of acute GvHD have been described  (Socié  2019). The first 
phase, priming of the immune response, is initiated by [CONTACT_346347]. Damage to host tiss ues results in the 
secretion of pro -inflammatory cytokines that can increase the ex pression of adhesion molecules, 
co-stimulatory molecules, major histocompatibility complex ( MHC) antigens and chemokines - 
all of which activate host antigen presenting cell s (APCs). The second phase, T- cell activation 
and co-stimulation occur when donor T cells proliferate and differentiate in response to host 
APCs. The incidence of acute GvHD is directly related to the degree of mismatch in human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA) det erminants such as MHC class II and I and minor histocompatibility 
antigens (MiHA). Additional donor/host differences, such as polymorphisms in proteins 
connected with innate immunity (NOD2), in the Toll-like receptor family, and in cytokine genes, 
are also  believed to contribute to acute GvHD risk. The third and fourth phases of acute GvHD 
include alloreactive T -cell expansion and differentiation followed by [CONTACT_346348] 
T-cells to GvHD  target tissues such as the gut, liver, skin, and lung and the recruitment of other 
effector leukocytes. In the last phase of acute GvHD deve lopment, effector T -cells initiate the 
destruction of target tissues via exposure to the cell surface and the release of soluble immune 
effectors. The resultant tissue damag e leads to an increase in inflammatory signals and 
propagation of the cytokine stor m. 
Classic acute GvHD generally develops within the first [ADDRESS_430257] and typi[INVESTIGATOR_346317], gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and liver. In the se tting of prophylaxis with 
immunosuppressants, Grade II- IV acute GvHD occurs in 25-60% of matched related transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_154345] 45 -70% of matched unrelated recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] ( Ho 2001). Although less common 
with myeloablative transplants, late onset acute GvHD  may occur after [ADDRESS_430258]. The 
incidence of acute GvHD increases with increasing HLA mismatch between donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] , 
unrelated donor transplant, female donor to male recipi[INVESTIGATOR_346318] a total body irradiation (TBI ) containing preparatory regimen. The development of Grade III /IV acute GvHD is 
 
 
Final Version  2.[ADDRESS_430259] line of treatment for 
Grade  III-IV acute GvHD. Complete responses can be expected in 25-35% of subject s, with an 
additional 15% achieving a partial response. Failure to respond to steroid therapy portends a poor 
prognosis. Second line treatment for acute GvHD include other immunosuppressive agents, such 
as tacrolimus, and anti -thymocyte globulin (ATG), as well as agents targeting TNF- α and the 
IL-2 receptor ( Paczesny 2 010). These therapeutic approaches are complicated by [CONTACT_346349]. 
4.1.2 CD4+Foxp3+ R egulatory T -cells 
A number of approaches, both pharmaceutical and cellular, in the prophylaxis of acute GvHD are 
being studied. The mainstay of prophylaxis therapy is a combination of a calc ineurin inhibitor 
(cyclosporine and tacrolimus) plus either a short course of methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil. More recently, sirolimus, which has been successful in the prevention of organ 
transplantation, has been utilized for acute GvHD. To  date, no single combination has proved 
superior in the prevention of acute GvHD, and the incidence of acute GvHD remains high. Cellular approaches have included T -cell depletion, either ex vivo or in vivo and the positive 
selection of stem c ells (to facilitate the exclusion of T- cells). While these efforts have had an 
impact on the incidence of acute GvHD, when used aggressively, these techniques have been associated with higher disease relapse rates ( Paczesny 2010).
  
More recently, ef forts have been made to understand the function of regulatory T cells in 
transplantation. CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells are considered a key player in maintaining peripheral tolerance ( Wing 2001, Sagoo 2008, Paczesny 2010 ). Animal studies have demonstrated that 
these cells prevent or ameliorate various T -cell mediated diseases, including autoimmune disease 
and GvHD, by [CONTACT_346350] -antigens as well as alloantigen s (Wolff 2009 ). 
Studies in both humans and mice have confirmed the pi[INVESTIGATOR_346319] ( Socié 2019). Ho wever, the development of Treg cell- based therapeutic modalities has 
been hampered, in part, by [CONTACT_346351]. RGI -2001 can expand these Treg 
cells in vivo and thus constitutes a novel approach to the treatment of GvHD .  
The relationship between Treg cells and acute GvHD  in clinical allogeneic bone marrow 
transplantation (BMT) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_346320]. A prospective analysis of peripheral blood Treg cells as determined by [CONTACT_346352]4+CD25hiFoxp3+ lymphocytes was conducted in 215 BMT subj ects (Magneau 2010). Autologous BMT subjects 
(N = 90) and allogeneic BMT subjects without GvHD (N = 65) had similar cell frequencies, whereas allogeneic subject s with GvHD (N = 60) had Treg cell frequencies that were 40% less 
than those without GvHD. Treg cell frequencies decreased li nearly with increasing grades of 
GvHD at onset, and correlated with the eventual maximum grade of GvHD (P < 0.001). In addition, the number of Treg cells at onset of GvHD predicted the response to GvHD treatment (P < 0.003). Subject s with Treg cell frequen cies less than the median had higher non-relapse 
mortality than subject s with Treg cells greater than the median, but experienced equivalent 
relapse mortality, resulting in an inferior survival at 2 years (38% v ersus 63%, P  < 0.03). Treg

RGI-2001 is a liposomal formulation of the compound known as RGI -7000. RGI -7000 is a 
synthetic glycolipid composed of a galactose and a ceramide moiety linked in an 
α-configuration, a derivative of α -galactosylceramide (α- GalCer), a glycolipid originally 
extracted from a marine sponge  (Natori 1 993). It serves as a ligand for the CD1d molecule, 
expressed on  APCs ( Kawano 1997, Brossay 1998). The CD1d molecule is a non-polymorphic, 
MHC class I –like antigen -presenting molecule with an antigen -binding groove adapted for the 
presentation of lipid antigens ( Moody 2005, Brigl 2004).

4.[ADDRESS_430262] confirmed the pi[INVESTIGATOR_346309]4+Foxp3+ Treg cells play in controlling GvHD ( Socié  2009). However, the development of Treg cell-based therapeutic 
modalities has been hampered, in part, by [CONTACT_346351]. RGI -[ADDRESS_430263] determined the mechanism for RGI-2001’s immunomodulatory activity. These studies have shown that 
RGI-[ADDRESS_430264], which ultimately leads to the activation of 
cellular cascades including regulatory dendritic cells  (DCreg) and Tregs. These antigen- specific 
Tregs have been shown to down regulate the immune response directed toward specific antigens without causing generalized immunosuppression. In vivo experiments have also shown that 
primary antibody (humoral) responses were suppressed when mice were exposed to a prototypic preparation of liposomal RGI-7000 at or around the time an antigen was introduced ( Ishii 2008). 
Furthermore, in a murine model of acute GvHD, treatment with RGI-2001 resulted in a statistically significant p rolongation of survival in animals treated at doses ranging from 0.1 to 
100 µ g/kg. In the treated animals, significantly higher levels of host alloantigen -specific Tregs 

 
 
Final Version  2.[ADDRESS_430265]. Additionally, in a mouse model of 
graft -versus- leukemia (GvL), treatment with RGI-2001 at the time of a llogeneic bone marrow 
transplant was clearly shown to suppress GvHD without abrogating GvL effects  
(Duramad  2011). 
4.[ADDRESS_430266] demonstrated the biological activity of RGI-2001 as follows: 
• RGI-2001 has been shown in vitro to be effectively taken up by B cells.  
• In peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and whole blood studies to assess 
cytokine induction, RGI -2001 at clinically relevant concentrations, did not induce 
significant levels of pro -inflammatory cytokines in either human PBMCs or whole 
blood, demonstrating the low potential for inducing cytokines that may play an inciting role in GvHD (e.g., IL-12, IFN- γ or TNF -α).  
• In an acute GvHD model, RGI -[ADDRESS_430267]-specific tolerance by [CONTACT_346353]-derived CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs following allogeneic bone marrow and whole spleen cell (WSC) transplantation. The 
expansion of Tregs was also associated with a significant survival benefit and improvement in clinical signs of GvHD without compromise of GvL effe cts. 
• Concurrent treatment of normal mice with RGI-2001 and allogeneic donor spleen 
cells resulted in tolerance specific to the donor alloantigens through expansion of 
DCreg and Treg cells in a donor- specific transfusion (DST) mouse model 
(REGiMMUNE  interna l report.  
• In the GvHD efficacy studies a highly significant survival benefit was seen in  mice 
treated with single injections of RGI- 2001 at doses as low as 0.1 μg/kg. A dose -
dependent donor derived CD4+Foxp 3+ Treg expansion was observed at doses 
ranging fr om 0.01 to 100 μg/kg. The survival benefit in these models reached 
significance at appro ximately 0.1 ug/kg. Thus, the minimum pharmacologically 
active dose (PAD) in the mouse GvHD model was defined as 0.1 μg/kg based on both 
survival and Treg expansion. 
In good laboratory practice ( GLP ) toxicology studies in the mouse  (doses of 0.25, 3.5, or 
50 mg/kg every 3 days) and monkey (doses of 0.1, 1.5, or 20 mg/kg every 3 days), doses up to 50 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg of RGI -2001 respectively, the maximum feasible doses (MFD) , did not 
result in significant toxicity or dose limiting adverse effects. RGI-2001 was administered 
intravenously every 3 days to mice and monkeys for a period of up to 2 weeks, for a total of 
5 doses . These repeat dose studies included complete clin ical, as well as morphological 
evaluations in addition to immunophenotypic analyses. Although the severely toxic dose – 10 
(STD -10) or the highest non- severely  toxic dose ( HNSTD) was not reached in the mouse or 
monkey repeat dose toxicology studies, the hi ghest dose was considered the no observed adverse 
 
 
Final Version  2.[ADDRESS_430268] level (NOAEL) . The human equivalent dose (HED) of the NOAEL in the mouse 
(50 mg/kg) is 4400 µg/kg and the HED of the NOAEL in the monkey (20 mg/kg) is 6450 µg/kg. 
These HEDs are 44 - to 65 -fold higher than the dose planned in study RGI-2001-003 (100 µg/kg), 
To supplement the general toxicology studies a single primate GLP safety pharmacology study

Toxicokinetic (TK)  evaluations were performed for each of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_346322]. 
Mass balance (i.e., excretion into urine and feces) studies were conducted in mice and monkeys 
using radiolabeled RGI-2001. In addition, a tissue distribution and expi[INVESTIGATOR_346323].   
In both mice and monkeys, radioactivity following [
14C]RGI -[ADDRESS_430270]- treatment, but the terminal 
half- life (T ½)  in cells (> 250 hours) was much longer than in plasma (~ 50 hours).  
After administration of [ 14C]RGI -[ADDRESS_430271]- dose. Tissues wi th notably high radioactivity levels were the spleen, liver, bone 
marrow, lung, and adrenal gland. These distribution data were consistent with established 
clearance mechanisms for liposomes through the reticuloendothelial system (Ishida 2002).
 Some 
of the tissues with the highest radioactivity were those associated with histopathologic alterations 
in the mouse toxicology study. Tissues with notably low radioactivity were the central nervous 
system (CNS), ocular tissues, bone, skel etal muscle and reproductive tissues.  
Excretion studies in both mice and monkeys demonstrated that very little RGI-2001 was 
eliminated in the urine and feces. In monkeys, 2.88% was eliminated in the urine and 0.91% in 
the feces. In mice < 6% was eliminated in urine and feces combined. In bile duct-cannulated 
mice, it was shown that only 0.11% of the injected radioactivity was collected in bile over 
24 hours. Collection of expi[INVESTIGATOR_346324] 64.68% of the injected dose as CO 2, indicating the 
major route of elimination was conversion of [ 14C]RGI -2001 to CO 2. 
The s pecies used in the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 
(ADME)/toxicokinetic evaluations of RGI- 2001 were the same species employed in the 
pharmacological evaluations (mouse, cynomolgus monkey) and definitive toxicology studies. To date, no m etabolism studies of RGI-[ADDRESS_430272] been conducted. The expected consequence of the 
metabolism of liposomal products such as RGI-2001 is degradation to the individual 
phospholipid components and/or t riglycerides  (Seltzer 1984).

An in vitro study was performed with appropriate positive and negative controls to determine if 
RGI-7000, the active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API) of RGI -2001, inher ited human cytochrome 
P450 enzymes. This study was conducted with RGI-7000 rather than RGI-2001 because it was considered a more sensitive means with which to assess inhibitory potential. Under experimental conditions, there was little or no evidence that RGI-7000 inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_430273] in human (FIH) study of RGI -2001 was a Phase 1/2a multicenter, open- label, dose 
escalation study whose primary objective was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetic prof ile of a single dose of RGI -[ADDRESS_430274] , with 
radiation or non- radiation containing myeloablative or reduced intensity  preparative treatment s 
based on institutional practices. GvHD prophylaxis consisted of a calcineurin inhibitor and one of the following (based on institutional practices): methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, or sirolimus. The study was divided into 2 parts: Part [ADDRESS_430275] with an unrelated peripheral blood or bone marrow donor graft. The dose ranged from 
0.001 ug/kg to 100 ug/kg. Based on the results of the P art [ADDRESS_430276] was 100 μg/kg. A dose 2 logs lower (1 μg/kg) 
was chosen to evaluate the potential dose response between the 1 μg/kg and 100 μg/kg doses in 
an effort to see a dose resp onse in Part 2 of the study.  
In the Part 2 dose-expansion phase of the study, 29 subjects receiving matched related or 
unrelated donor grafts were randomized to receive a single infusion of either 1.0 ug/kg or 
100 ug/kg R GI-[ADDRESS_430277]. Fourteen subjects received a dose o f 1.0 ug/kg and 15 subjects received a dose of 
100 ug/kg of RGI -2001. An additional 11 subjects were enrolled as control subjects.  A subset o f 
subjects comprised of 4  subjects from each cohort , (8 of  29, 28%) responded to RGI-[ADDRESS_430278] exclusively Helios+ and Foxp3+, indicating that their accumulation 
was due to expansion of natural Tregs. Notably, the incidence of grade [ADDRESS_430279] s who responded to RGI -2001 was 12.5%, compared with 52.4% in the [ADDRESS_430280] s who 
did not respond. No grade 3 or 4 GvHD was observed in the responder group, compared with a 
9.5% incidence among nonresponders  (Chen 2017).  
The e xpansion of Treg cells was observed through Day [ADDRESS_430281] cohorts 
and for the subjects who received either the 1 μg/kg or 100 μg/kg dose of RGI -2001 in Part 2, the 
median  times to Tmax were between 0.5 and 0.7 hours. 
RGI-2001 was well tolerated and without infusion reactions or cytoki ne release syndrome up to a 
dose level of 100 μg/kg administered as a s ingle intravenous infusion in subjects who under went 
allogeneic transplantation.  There were no notable adverse effects across a variety of conditioning 
regimens an d regimens for GvHD prophylaxis.  
This study served as the proof of concept for further explo ring the potential of RGI-[ADDRESS_430282]-transplantation. 
Refer to the current edition of the RGI -2001 IB for additional information related to RGI -2001 
clinical experience.  
4.6 Risks/Ben efits 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_346325], GvHD remains  the largest factor 
influencing outcome from HSCT. Transplant related mortality rates incre ase with increasing 
severity of acute G vHD. Thus, additional treatments are needed. RGI -2001 has demonstrated the 
potential for Treg expansion and a subsequent decrease in acute G vHD without significant 
toxicity.  
Clinical experience consists of the Phase 1  study which is described in Section 4.5. The MTD 
was not reached in doses ranging from 0.001 µg/kg to 100 µg/kg. There were no notable adverse effects across a variety of conditioning and GvHD prophylaxis 
regimens. The expansion of regulatory T- cells was observed up through Day 22 as compared to 
the control group. Correlation of r egulatory T c ell increase appeared to be in inverse relation 
with severity of GvHD.  
All subjects achieved myeloid engraftment within 30 days following RGI-2001 administration. 
Two subjects (both in cohort 2 [0.01 µg/kg]) did not  achieve platelet engraftment within the time 
period; platelet engraftment for 2 other subjects  was unknown (1 in the 1.0  µg/kg group and 1 in 
the 100 µg/kg  group) . Three subjects in the control group did not have platelet engraftment 
within [ADDRESS_430283] 1 treatment- emergent adverse event

hypertension (10/57 subjects 17.5%), diarrhea (7/57 subjects, 12.3%), stomatitis (6/57  subjects, 
10.5%), and nausea (5/57 subjects, 8.8%). Grade [ADDRESS_430285] (100 µg/kg 
group), and septic shock and respi[INVESTIGATOR_346326] (100 µg/kg group). 
The following SAEs occurred in ≥  2 subjec ts in the a ll RGI -2001 group: pyrexia, GvHD, and 
venoocclusive disease (3  subjects each); and diarrhea, sepsis, and staphylococcal bacteremia 
(2 subjects each).  
Based on the nonclinical safety data available for RGI -2001, potential side effects associated 
with the administration of RGI -2001 include:
 
•  Extramedullary hematopoiesis and splenomegaly ; observed in a nimals receiving 
multiple high dose injections of RGI-2001. Although extramedullary hematopoiesis is 
rare in humans, subjects will be monitored closely with complete blood  counts (CBC) 
and physical exam for eval uation of splenomegaly. 
• Microgranulomas; observed in the liver of animals receiving multiple high dose 
injections of RGI-2001. Subjects will have liver function tests monitored frequently throughout the course of the study. 
• Changes in RBCs, reticulocytes, WBC, leukocytes and various T- and B- cell 
lymphocyte subsets. Decline in RBCs may result in anemia, while decline in 
lymphocyte subsets may increase susceptibility to some types of infection. Subjects 
will have frequ ent CBCs to monitor for significant changes in red and white blood 
cell populations. 
• A mild decline in triglycerides ; observed in preclinical safety studies. It is anticipated 
that such a decline will have little impact on safety in subjects.   
 
 
Final Version  2.[ADDRESS_430286] linked the activation of iNKT cells with the progression of atherosclerosis 
in murine models of atherogenesis ( Tupin 2004).  The role of iNKT cells in the development of 
atherosclerotic lesions in humans is unknown; however, inflammation and the innate immune 
response are believed to contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis. Pharmacologically 
active doses of RGI -2001 are expected to activate iNKT cells and theoretically could, as a result, 
aggravate underlying atherosclerotic disease. Only subjects with adequate cardiovascular 
function without ischemia or myocardial infarction in the previous six m onths will be enrolled in 
the clinical study. 
4.7 Dose Regimen and Treatmen t Period Rationale 
The dose and dose schedule for the Phase 2 study is 100 µg/kg, weekly for a duration of 5 weeks 
(6 doses). This dose was selec ted based on nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology information 
and the safety and exploratory efficacy results of the P hase 1/2a FIH study. 
In murine models of GvHD, doses as low as 2 µg/mouse (approximately 100 µg/kg) prolonged the survival of mice . Additional studies  showed pr olongation of survival in these murine models 
was noted over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 µg/kg. As there was no sign of decreasing efficacy with 
dose, these mouse models suggested a dose of 100 µg/kg was toward the top of a wide range of 
effective doses.  
In 2-week GLP toxicity studies of RGI-[ADDRESS_430287] dose tested in each species, 50 and 20 mg/kg, respectively. The HED of these doses are 
44-fold and 65-fold higher than the planned dose of 100 µg/kg in study RGI-2001-003. Exposure 
of mice and monkeys at the NOAEL, based AUC0- t was very large, 2,155,000 ng*h/mL and 
12,950,000 ng*h/mL, respectively. These exposures are over 10,000-fold higher than the human AUC0 -t associated with a dose of 100 µg/kg (133 ng*h/mL, n = 15, study RGI -2001-002, 
Part 2). 
Longer term toxicity of the active agent (RGI-7000) given by [CONTACT_346354] (50, 100, 200, and 400 µg/kg/day for 26 weeks) and monkeys 
(30, 60, 200, and 600 µg/kg/day for 15 weeks), with a toxicity pattern similar to that of RGI-2001 suggesting there is no change in the toxicity of the active agent of RGI-2001 with 
longer duration of treatment. 
Further support for the selection of 100 µg/kg comes from the clinical safety seen in study 
RGI-2001-002, in which RGI- 2001 was safe and well tolerated up to 100 μg/kg administered as 
a single intravenous infusion for subjects who received allogeneic transplantation. There were no 
notable adverse effects across a var iety of conditioning regimens and GvHD prophylaxis. 
Possible efficacy was observed in subjects during Part 1  (dose escalation) of the study but the 
differences between doses were not clear because of the small sample sizes.  In Part 2 (dose 
expansion), both doses at 1.0 µg/kg and 100 µg/kg dose level showed some signal of effect and 
 
 
Final Version  2.[ADDRESS_430288] dose evaluated. There were no trends in toxicity with 
dose escalation  across all the cohorts. Therefore, RGI 2001 at 100 ug/kg was s elected to further 
evalu ated for repeat dosing for the clinical development program.   
Potential signals of efficacy from a single dose of RGI-2001 in study RGI-2001- 002 support 
further testing of repeated (weekly) doses of RGI-[ADDRESS_430289] inconvenience with clinic visits.

Figure  1 Study Design Sche ma 
 
6.1 Safety Run-in Phase  
A Safety R un-in Phase will be used to assess the safety profile and tolerability of repeat doses of 
RGI-2001 prior to the Expansion Phase. This portion of the study will be conducted at a limited 
number of sites.  
Subjects will re ceive open- label RGI -2001 at a dose of 100μg  /kg, via 30-minute intravenous 
(IV) infusion on a weekly basis for [ADDRESS_430295] infusion  (see S ection  8.6 on Dose Administration). Subsequent doses will be 
administered weekly, on Days 7, 14, 21, [ADDRESS_430296] s each will be e nrolled to the Safety R un-in Phase. Initially, 
3 subjects will be enrolled, treated and assessed for dose- limiting toxicities (as defined below in 
Section  6.1.1) through Day 30 (DLT window) . A safety review committee (SRC) will examine 
all relevant safety data after the 3rd  subject has reached Day 30 . As a rough guide, a DLT r ate on 
the order of 20% or less would be considered as acceptable.  Therefore, i f 0 subjects are  reported

Treatment Phase
RGI 100ug/kg IV infusion Days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, [ADDRESS_430297] 3 subjects, consideration will be given to enrolling up to 3 
additional subjects. However, this decision will not be made solely on the observed occurrence 
(or lack of) DLTs; rather the SRC will consider the totality of the safety data before arriving at a 
definitive conclusion regarding enrollment of additional subjects at the dose of 100 μg  /kg. If 
within the first 3 subjects, 1 or more DLT s are observed, then consideration will be given to use 
of an alternative dose and/or dosing schedule, with the ultimate decision being made by [CONTACT_12217]. 
If an alternate dose and/or schedule is used, the same process as described above will be used.  If 
the additional [ADDRESS_430298] s (beyond the initial 3) are allowed to enroll at the dose of 100 μg  /kg or a 
lower dose and/or alternative schedule, safety data after the 6th subject has complete d all 6 doses, 
as well as initial efficacy,  PK and PD data will be evaluated in coming to a recommendation 
regarding proceeding to the Expansion Phase , with this recommend ation made by [CONTACT_12217]. Once 
the study extends to the Expansion Phase , enrollment will be open to all sites ( Figure 2).  
6.1.[ADDRESS_430299] procedure. Therefore, hematologic toxicit ies (e.g., leukopenia and thrombocytopenia) 
will not be useful measures of drug -induced toxicity, and DLTs are defined by [CONTACT_105]-hematologic 
toxicities.  
The following DLT criteria apply to the Safety Run-in Phase of the study. A DLT is defined as 
any treatmen t-relate d AE that is not attributable to an extraneous cause ( i.e., disease progression , 
preparatory regimen or HSCT infusion) and also excludes any signs and symptoms of GvHD. 
DLT is an adverse event  occurring in the period of [ADDRESS_430300] one of the following NCI CTC (Version  5.0) criteria:  
• Grade 3+ infusion- related /cytokine release reactions  
• Graft failure  (as defined in Section  9.4.1.) 
• Any Grade 4-5 non-hematologi cal AE  
• Delay in dosing by > [ADDRESS_430301] receives ≤  50% of planned doses of RGI-[ADDRESS_430302] may be replaced.

6.2 Expansion Phase  
Once a dose/schedule is determined by [CONTACT_346356]/PK profile, 
enrollment will continue in the Phase 2 Expansion Phase and be extended to all sites.  
Accrual is targeted at 50 subjects who receive the dose deemed as acceptable from the Safety 
Run-in Phase (44 in the Expansion Phase, 6 from the S afety Run-in P hase at the dose used in 
expansion). All subjects in the Expansion Phase who receive at least one dose will be considered 
in all efficacy and safety analyses.   
Subjects will receive open -label RGI -2001 at a dose of 100μg /kg (unless an alternative dose 
and/or schedule is chosen by [CONTACT_163257]), via 30- minute intravenous (IV) infusion on a weekly basis 
for 6 doses (or an alternative dose/schedule as determined in the run- in phase) in addition to a 
SOC GvHD prophylactic regimen. The first dose will be administered on Day [ADDRESS_430303] 
been transplanted in a center that participates in this study. Consent will be obtained via  the 
CIBMTR to participate in this study (Section 11). 
6.4 Safety Review Committee  
As noted above, a safety review committee will be used in this study. The SRC will serve  
3 primary roles: 1) assessment of DLTs , other safety measures, and PK/PD in th e initial 
3 subjects to determine whether dose and schedule appropriate to enroll another 3 subjects 
2) assessment of safety and PK/ PD data to determine  suitability to proceed to dose expansion 
3) ongoing monitoring of both safety and aggrega ted efficacy data. The SRC  will develop and 
follow a data and S afety Monitoring P lan and c harter.  
The SR C will be composed of, at a minimum the Sponsor  or designee me mbers including the 
Medical Monitor, Statistician , Safety Scientist, and the Lead Principal Investigator (PI). SRC 
meetings will occur in accordance with the SRC  charter.  
Depending on the results of safety reviews, the SRC may provide recomm endations on the future 
continuation of the study and other relevant steps, including prophylactic pre- medications in all 
or some current and future subjects.

7.5 Withdrawal/D iscontinuation  from Treatment, Procedures and S tudy   
7.5.1 Study Discontinuation  
The Sponsor has the righ t to terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for terminating the study 
overall or at a specific study site may include, but are not limited to the following:  
1. The incidence or severity of adverse events (AEs) in this or other RGI -[ADDRESS_430312] enrollment is unsatisfactory  
3. Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete  
4. Investigator does not adhere to the protocol or applicable regulatory guidelines in 
conducting the study  
5. The safety review comm ittee (SRC) recommends termination of the study  due to revealed 
safety concerns.  
7.5.2 Subjects’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without 
prejudice to their future medical care by [CONTACT_8018].  
Subjects can  decline to continue receiving investigational product and/or other protocol-required 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_346328]. If this occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the subject the appropriate process for 
discontinuation from investigational product or other protocol- required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_346329], inc luding endpoi nts and adverse events.  The investigator must document  the 
level of follow -up that is agreed to by [CONTACT_423] (e.g., in person, by [CONTACT_756]/mail, through 
family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other physicians, from review of the medical re cords). 
Withdrawal of consent f rom a study means that the subject does not wish to receive further 
protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21882], and the subject does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation. Subject data up to withdraw al of consent will be included in 
the analysis of the study, and where permitted, publicly available data can be included after 
withdrawal of consent. The investigator is to discuss with the subject appropriate procedures for 
withdrawal from the study.  
If a subject  fails to return  for scheduled  visits,  a documented effort  must  be made  to determine
 
the reason.  If the subject cannot be reached  by [CONTACT_63013],  a certified  letter 
should be sent to the subject  (or the subject’s legally  authorized representative,  if appropriate) 
requesting contact [CONTACT_31387].  Attempts  to contact  [CONTACT_346358].

8.6 Administration and Dosing R egimen  
All subjects will receive 6 weekly doses of RGI -2001 100 μ g/kg via IV administration over 
30 minutes.  Weight should be taken within one day of dosing and the dosage of RGI-2001 
should be verified to be the same as the planned dose. The  dosage of RGI -2001 will be diluted in  
50 ml 0.9% normal salin e and the first dose w ill administered intravenously  at approximately  
[ADDRESS_430318]  on Day 0 (study 
Day 1  if transplant occurs over 2 days) . If cytokine release/infusion reaction is observed during 
or after HSCT, then RGI -[ADDRESS_430319] 30 minutes after the reaction 
has resolved. Subsequent RGI -2001 administrations  should be administered on Days 7,  14, 21, 
28, and 35 + /- 1 day. Pre-medications should not be administered prophylactically . However, if 
a grade 2 cytokine release is observed, pre- medication with an antihistamine (e.g ., 
diphenhydr amine ), an anti -pyretic  (e.g. acetaminophen) and corticosteroids (e.g., 4 mg 
dexamethasone or equivalent) should be administered. Consideration may be made to administer 
premedication  for Grade [ADDRESS_430320]’s study 
participation.  
Standard myeloablative preparator y regimens, (i.e., reduced intensity conditioning, non 
myeloablative conditioning, experimental regimens or drugs are not allowed), HSCT and 
standard supportive care/ prophylactic treatments (including but not limited to colony stim ulating 
factors, transfu sions, antibiotics/anti -virals/anti -fungals) per institutional guidelines for optimal 
medical care shall be permitted during participation of this study . The dose of steroids that are 
required for reasons unrelated to the underlying malignancy or HSCT proc ess or sequelae must 
not be higher than physiologic doses (the equivalent of 20 mg/day of prednisone). No anti -
thymocyte globulin (ATG)  is allowed in the conditioning regimen. 
GvHD prophylaxis must consist of a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrol imus) in 
combination with MTX or MMF. Dosing, schedule and monitoring of the GvHD regimen should 
follow institutional guidelines.  Please see respective prescribing information for safety  
information. Steroids, sirolimus, post-transplant cyclophosphamide, A TG, other GvHD

prophylactic agents (including investigational agents) or manipulation of the graft to reduce 
GvHD are not allowed.  
Post transplant maintenance therapy that inc ludes an investigational agent , or any treatments that 
can be used for GvHD are not allowed. Maintenance therapy for actionable targeted mutations 
(e.g., FLT3 inhibitors) or with FDA approved agents in any indication should not be initiated 
prior to Day [ADDRESS_430321] be  notified 
of the use of any medications, except acetaminophen, immediately  after use. Any concomitant  
medications  added or discontinued during the study  should be recorded  on the electronic case 
report form (e CRF. ) 
8.9 Dietary  or Other  Protocol Restrictions  
Dietary restrictions per institutional guidelines (e.g. neutropenic diet) may be  imposed  on study 
subjects.  Alcohol and tobacco use should be limited as per institutional guidelines.  
8.10 Dose Modification /Treatment Cessation  
If a subject permanently discontinues treatment in the Safety Run -in or Expansion Phase as 
specified below, s ee Sec tion 7.5.3 Discontinuation of Study Treatment and/or Withd rawal of 
Subjects Prior to Study Completion, for further details. 
8.10.1 Safety Run- in Phase  
RGI-2001 will be administered at a dose of 100 μg/kg IV weekly for 6 doses. There a re no dose 
reductions or escalations in this portion of the study except as recommended by [CONTACT_346360]-in period. Each individual infusion is allowed to be delayed up to 2 weeks for 
ongoing grade 3+ AEs, regardless of causality. However, i f a subject enrolled in the run -in 
period is not able to receive at least 50%  of RGI -[ADDRESS_430322] will be replaced. Subjects requiring delay of an infusion of > [ADDRESS_430323] has a treatment related Grade 3 adverse event (excluding any hematologic AE or 
CRS ) that is not considered to be related to extraneous cause ((i.e . disease progression, 
preparatory regimen, HSCT infusion), subsequent doses will be held until the toxicity returns to 
≤ Grade 2 or baseline.  RGI -2001 may be restarted at a dose of 10 µg/kg  IV infusion. 
Subjects who m eet DLT criteria (including Grade 3+ CR S) at any point in the study should be 
permanently discontinued from study treatment. Supportive care should be administered as appropriate. 
If subject has a 2
nd occurrence of Grade 3 adverse event, RGI-2001 will be held until the toxicity 
return s to ≤  Grade 2 or baseline.  RGI -2001 will be restarted at a dose of 1 µg/kg  IV infusion. 
If a subject experiences a G rade [ADDRESS_430324] does not demonstrate evidence of myeloid engraftment by  [CONTACT_2006] 28, discontinue 
RGI-2001 permanently. 
8.11 Management of Cytokine Release Syndrome 
Pre-medications for RGI-2001 will not be administered initially  as no signs of cytokine release 
were observed in the Phase 1 study . If symptoms suggestive of cytokine release (fever,  chills,  
etc.) are observed  with administration  of RGI-2001, subjects should be treated according to 
institutional guidelines. The SRC may provide additional recommendations for such 
situations (please refer to S ection 6.4). For Grade 2 AEs, acetaminophen, diphenhydramine 
and/or steroids may be administered. Premedication  for subsequent RGI -[ADDRESS_430325] of intraven ous or oral  dexamethasone  (4 mg), acetaminophen and diphenhydramine prior  
to each administration  of RGI-2001. Details should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior 
to the next infusion. For subjects with G rade 3–4 infusion reaction/cytokine release 
symptoms should be discontinued from further RGI -2001 therapy regardless of whether 
prophylactic treatment was administered.

Final Version  2.[ADDRESS_430337] a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can 
therefore be any of the follo wing: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (inves tigational) product  
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a known condition),  
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline  
• Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X- ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study drug  
• AEs that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including those that occur 
prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as 
biopsies) 
10.1.1 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that at any dose meets any of the following criteria:  
• Fatal  (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death)  
• Life threatening  (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the Investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death). This does not include any adverse event that had it 
occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue might have caused death.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions)  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug  
• Significant medical event.  An important medical event is an event that may not 
result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124495], based upon appropriate medical judgment by [CONTACT_223493], it may jeopardize the patie nt and may require medical or surgical

intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed i n the definitions for SAEs. 
Examples of such medical events include second primary malignancies developed 
months after the end of the study treatment, or convulsions that do not result in in - 
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are no t synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an 
adverse event (rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE criteria  v. 5.0; 
see Section 10.2.2); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical signific ance (such as 
severe headache without any further findings).  
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event recorded on 
the e CRF . 
10.[ADDRESS_430338] will be followed, at the investigator’s discretion, until resolution of the event. Resolution is defined as return to baseline status or stabilization of the condition with the expectation that it will remain 
chronic. 
Adverse events (including laboratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described 
using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms. 
When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be recorded as a 
separate AE.  
The Investigator should ask the subject  non-leading questions to determine if any AEs have 
occurred during the study, since the last study visit. Adverse events may a lso be recorded when 
they are volunteered by [CONTACT_423] , or through physical examination, laboratory tests, or other 
clinical assessments.  
10.2.[ADDRESS_430339] Abnormalities  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (i.e., are considered to be clinically significant, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes in study drug), should be recorded on the Adverse Event s eCRF . Whenever possible, a 
diagnosis, rather than a symptom should be provided (e.g., anemia instead of low hemoglobin). 
Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for an AE should be followed until they have 
returned to baseline levels (as measured  during the Screening visit) or an adequate explanation of 
the abnormality is identified. When an abnormal laboratory or test result corresponds to a sign/symptom of an already reported AE, it is not necessary to separately record the laboratory/test result as an additional event.  
 
 
Final Version  2.[ADDRESS_430340] be reported as an AE if it meets any of the following criteria:  
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the Investigator’s judgme nt 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory abnormality . Medic al and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an AE.  
If a clinically significant laboratory or ECG abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., alkaline phosphatase an d bilirubin 5 × the ULN associated with cholecystitis), only the 
diagnosis (i.e., cholecystitis) should be recorded on the AE eCRF. 
If a clinically significant laboratory  or ECG abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself sho uld be recorded on the AE eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if 
the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to 
"abnor mal potassium"). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical 
term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE. For example, an 
elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hype rkalemia.”  
10.2.2 Adverse Event Severity  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of an AE; the event itself could be of 
relatively minor clinical significance (e.g., ‘severe’ headache). This is not the same as a “serious” AE. 
The severity of the AE wi ll be graded by [CONTACT_178203], v.5.0  
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_R
eference_8.5x11.pdf 
If there is not a specific  NCI CTCAE grading scale for an AE, the severity will be characterized 
as mild, moderate, severe, or life -threatening, according to the following definitions: 
Grade  Descr iption  
1 (Mild)  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations

10.2.[ADDRESS_430342], the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an 
adverse event is considered to be related  to the study drug. The following guidance should be 
taken into consideration. Discuss with medical monitor if needed:   
• Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug  
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (where applicable)  
• Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments  
• Known association of the event with the disease under study  
• Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to increase the occurrence of the event  
• Presence of non -treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event  
Relationship  Descri ption  
Not Related  Exposure to th e investigational product has not occurred, or the occurrence of 
the AE is not reasonably related in time, or the event is readily and more likely 
explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_243079].  
Note: per  your institution standard, if relationship is determined to be unlikely, it 
should be classified as Not Related unless the investigator determines possibly 
related or probably related are more appropriate with the definitions below.  
Possibly Related  The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related 
in time, and  
The AE could be explained equally well by [CONTACT_189578].  
Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration; but could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_346365].  
 
 
Final Version  2.[ADDRESS_430343] be reported (in addition to SAEs that occur after the first dose of study drug).  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or su rgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. See definition of SAE in Section 10.1. 
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43930], or to simplify trial treatment or trial procedures (e.g., an overnight stay to facilitate 24 -hour urine collection) or other medical procedures are not 
considered SAEs. A ‘serious’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_346334] a minimum of an overnight stay in a health care facility. An 
emergency room visit is not considered a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_346335] (e.g., undesirable effects of any administered trea tment) and must 
be documented as an SAE.  
10.3.[ADDRESS_430344] be reported regardless of the casual  relationship to t he study drug.  
SAEs will  be reported immediately  (within 24  hours of learning  of the  event)  to the Sponsor or 
its designee by [CONTACT_346366]- specific SAE  Report Form and recorded in the eCRF . In 
addition to  the outcome of the SAE,  any medication  or other therapeutic  measures used  to treat  
the event  will be recorded  on the appropriate  eCRF  page(s). Investigators  should not wait to 
collect  additional information  that fully  documents the event
 before notifying Sponsor or its  
designee of  an SAE.  Sponsor may  be required to report certain  SAEs  to regulatory  authorities 
within  7 calendar  days of  being notified  about the event; therefore,  it is important that  
Investigators submit additional information  requested  by [CONTACT_346367].  
Reporting of SAEs  to the IRB will be done in compliance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB and with applicable regulatory  requirements.  Adequate  
documentation must be obtained by [CONTACT_346368]. 
The SAE  form should be em ailed  to: [EMAIL_6696]  
 
 
Final Version  2.[ADDRESS_430345] information  for the M edical  Monitor is as 
follows:  
 
 
 
Any SAE observed after the 30- day follow -up period should only be reported to the Sponsor if 
the Investigator su spects that the SAE has a causal relationship to the study drug. An SAE should 
be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be stable . An assessment should be made at 
each study visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity of the event, the 
suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat the event, and the 
outcome of the event. 
Recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be reported, as 
follow -up to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], within 24 hours of the Investigator receiving the follow-up 
information. 
10.4 Reporting of Dise ase Progression  
Progression of the malignancy/disease (including fatal outcomes) should NOT be reported as an 
SAE during the study or within the safety repor ting period . Any sudden or unexplained death 
should be reported as an SAE. However, the underlying disease or condition, which led to the fatal outcome, should be used as an SAE term. Death as an SAE term should be avoided, with the exception of rare situations when the cause of death is unknown. I f there is any uncertainty 
about a finding being due solely to progression of malignancy/disease, the finding should be reported as an AE or SAE, as appropriate. 
10.[ADDRESS_430346] ’s 
disease should be recorded as AE/SAE. Death due to GvHD  that is consistent with the nature and 
natur al progression of the subject ’s disease is not recorded as an AE/SAE.

(Section 7). Control subject s who fulfill eligibility criteria and who have a signed ICF to allow 
their data to be used for research wil l be assigned to the CIBMTR comprehensive data reporting 
track (CRF -track) and cent ers will be notified. Forms due requirements for the case report form

It is anticipated that a minimum of [ADDRESS_430349]  age, gender, donor 
age, type of donor  (MRD, 8/8 UR D 7/[ADDRESS_430350]) , source of allograft, diagnosis (AML, ALL, MDS, 
MPD  including CMML), preparative regimen , GvHD prophylaxis regimen . 
Secondary endpoints that will be modeled as binary outcomes will similarly be compared using 
logistic regression.  Secondary endpo ints that will be modeled a s time -to-event outcomes will be 
compared using Cox regression. 
Potent ial interactions of RGI-2001 and various factors will be examined by [CONTACT_346370].   
Given that this is not a randomized study and that the intention is  only to assess outcomes for a 
potential signal, no adjustments w ill be made for multiple comparisons.  As such, a Type II error 
(or a false negative) is prioritized over a Type I error (or a false positive).  
Binary exploratory outcomes will be summarized with proportions, continuous outcomes with 
means and medians, and time -to-event outcomes with Kaplan -Meier estimates or cumulative 
incidence estimates for endpoints with competing risks.

In lung: FEV1 is used instead of clinical score for calculating global severity.  
If the entire abnorma lity in an organ is note d to be unequivocally explained 
by a non- GvHD documented cause, that organ is not included for calculation

APPENDIX 6 CONTRACEPTIVE GUIDAN CE AND COLLECTION O F 
PREGNANCY INFORMATION  
Definitions:  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WCBP) 
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below)  
Women in the following categories are not considered WCB P: 
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
• Documented hysterectomy  
• Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
• Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
3. Postmenopausal female  
• A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alterna tive 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not 
using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in 
the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use [ADDRESS_430370] discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 
Contracept ion Methods : 
Male patients  
• Are abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle 
(abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent 
• Agree to use a male condom plus partner use of a contraceptive method as described  
under highly effective contraceptive methods when having penile- vaginal intercourse 
with a woman of childbearing potential who is not currently pregnant. 
In addition, male patients must refrain from donating sperm for the duration of the study and for [ADDRESS_430371] agree to remain abstinent from penile- vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each ep isode of penile penetration from 
the start of study treatment until 90 days after study treatment.

Female patients  
Female patients of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use a highly 
effective method of contraception throughout the study and for 90 days after the end of study 
treatment.  
Highly effective methods include:  
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation 
− Oral  
− Intravaginal  
− Transdermal  
• Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
− Oral  
− Injectable  
− Implantable  
• Intrauterine device (IUD) 
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner  
• Sexual abstinence  
Pregnancy Testing:  
• WCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to initiation of study drug. 
Pregnancy Reporting Guid elines : 
Although pregnancy is not considered an AE or SAE, all pregnancies occurring in subjects 
enrolled in this study or in a fem ale partner of a male subject in this study must be reported to the 
Sponsor on an expedited basis and followed to outcome, even after the end of the study.  
If a female subject inadvertently beco mes pregnant while on study treatment, the subject will 
immed iately be removed from the study. Any pregnancies that occur within [ADDRESS_430372] in an offspring , death of 
a newborn within 28 days of birth. In these cases, a separate SAE R eport Form should be filled 
in and submitted on an offsp ring, along with the Pregnancy Outcome Report Form on the 
mother.

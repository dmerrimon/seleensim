Study Title Observational Study: Image Collection of Infant/Toddler Stools for 
Danone Software Development 
Study Objectives  Primary  
 To create a database of stool images scored by [CONTACT_259878] a database containing at least 200 pi[INVESTIGATOR_259848] (stool) material per each stool consistency score 
(type 1 to 7) of the BITSS (Brussels Infant and Toddler Stool Scale) 
and 200 images of empty (no stool) disposable diapers 
 
Exploratory  
 To compare the stool consistency scores from mothers on-study 
to re-scores of mothers (not enrolled on-study) based only on 
the uploaded images  
 To assess mothers' perceptions of the usability of the stool 
scoring process and the usability of the ClaimIt app  
Study Design An observational study of stool images among infants/toddlers, ages 
0-24 months 
Study Observation 
Duration 30 days per child  
NOTE: If participants upload a low number of quality images due to 
infant/toddler constipation and infrequency of stooling, the mother 
may be asked if she would like to continue in the study for an 
additional >30 days or more. If she chooses to continue, she may do 
so as long as images continue to be provided at a reasonable 
frequency and/or until stool strata are satisfied (at the PI
[INVESTIGATOR_9106]). 
Country of 
Implementation [LOCATION_002] of America 
Study Population  
 Approximately 100 healthy infants/toddlers (until 200 images per

Implementation Prescreening : Administer the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
eQuestionnaire to mother which includes 
estimated stool frequency and consistency (e.g., liquid, soft/mushy, 
solid, firm, hard). After  information is 
shown to satisfy predetermined prescreen criteria (including 
distribution by [CONTACT_10609]), the mother will be provided access to the 
ClaimIt app along with the following information: 
 How to complete the electronic informed consent (eIC), 
screening and enrollment process 
 Overview of trial tasks and relevant notifications 
 ClaimIt navigation: How to interact with the ClaimIt app 
during the observation period  
 Additional study details & instructions on how to take high-
quality, standardized pi[INVESTIGATOR_259853]: The mother will complete a detailed eQuestionnaire for 
confirmation of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mother will also 
stool via ClaimIt, each with a corresponding score based on her 
judgment made in comparison with the BITSS scoring tool. Images 
must be uploaded within 10 days of receiving ClaimIt app access. 
 
An adaptive recruitment approach will be leveraged to ensure that

providing several images per day 
o Mothers who have not submitted at least one image 
in the previous 24-hour period will be sent 
notifications to encourage compliance  
o Only 1 representative image per bowel movement is 
to be transmitted 
 Along with each stool image uploaded, the mother will rate 
the stool characteristic type on the BITSS (type 1 to 7); scores 
will be based only on consistency and not color 
 
End of Observation Period:   
 The mother will be asked to complete an eQuestionnaire to 
assess and comment on the usability of the ClaimIt app and 
the scoring process (Appendix V) 
 Two mothers who were not enrolled in the study will be 
provided a collection of study stool images and asked to re-
score each image according to the BITSS 
Statistical 
Considerations 
 A sample size of 100 subjects is estimated with the following 
considerations: 
 Progression of potential subjects will be gated at the 
prescreening and screening steps to facilitate enrollment of 
an appropriately diversified set of infants/toddlers based on 
bowel patterns to reach 200 images per each stool 
consistency score (type 1 to 7) of the BITSS  
 The Sponsor and ObvioHealth will review the distribution of 
the scores and image quality and will determine when the 
prescreening requirements can be modified 
 A comparison will be made between the stool consistency 
scores from the mothers on-study to re-scores from mothers 
(not enrolled on-study) based only on the uploaded images

5 Introduction  
 
Accurately classifying stool consistency for infants and toddlers who are not yet toilet trained 
remains challenging. A recent study showed that among parents of infants and toddlers, only 
fair agreement existed between the parental report of stool consistency and the Bristol Stool 
Form Scale (BSS),[ADDRESS_316034].3 The Brussels Infant and Toddler Stool Scale (BITSS) 
was recently initiated based on the BSS to provide a classification tool to describe stool 
consistency for infants and toddlers.[ADDRESS_316035] a series of images that span the range of stool 
consistencies associated with the stools of infants and toddlers to create a significant and 
varied photographic image database.  For essentially healthy infants/toddlers (0-24 months) 
stool consistencies range from liquid (frequently associated with diarrhea) to hard formed 
(frequently associated with constipation) stools. This database will be used to assist in the 
further development of Danone software to facilitate evaluation of stool type remotely and 
permit evaluation beyond the interpretation of parents. The study is designed to collect at 
least 1600 images: at least 200 images per stool score (type 1 to 7) of the BITSS (at least 1400 
total) plus 200 images of empty (no stool) diapers, generating further data to assist in the 
assessment and classification of infant/toddler stools and gastrointestinal function. 
  
Study Number: OBVIO-DAN-[ADDRESS_316036] 200 pi[INVESTIGATOR_259857] (stool) material per each stool consistency score (type 1 to 7) of 
the BITSS (Brussels Infant and Toddler Stool Scale), and 200 images of empty (no 
stool) disposable diapers  
6.2 Exploratory Objectives 
 To compare the stool consistency scores from mothers on-study to the re-scores 
of mothers (not enrolled on-study) based only on the uploaded images 
 To assess mothers' perceptions of the usability of the stool scoring process and

 An assessment of the usability of the ClaimIt app  
7.4 Participants and Location 
7.4.1 Participants 
Study participants will include the mother and their infant/toddler. The 
prescreening recruitment process will be administered through an online 
eQuestionnaire to the mother evaluating the typi[INVESTIGATOR_259858] (e.g., 
liquid, soft/mushy, solid, hard).   
7.4.2 Location 
The trial will be conducted remotely in the [LOCATION_002]. Communication 
between mothers and study personnel will be conducted via the internet 
(ClaimIt platform) and/or over the telephone or email messaging as 
appropriate. 
7.5 Study Duration 
It is expected that the enrollment period will be five (5) months in total. 
The expected study duration is 30 days per mother and infant/toddler. If a participant 
uploads a low number of quality images due to infant/toddler constipation and 
infrequency of stooling, a member of the study team may contact [CONTACT_259879] 30 days or more. If she chooses to 
continue, they may do so as long as images continue to be provided at a reasonable 
frequency and/or until stool strata are satisfied (at the discretion).

10 Execution of the Trial 
10.1 Screening and Enrollment 
Prescreening: 
The prescreening recruitment step will recruit healthy infants/toddlers (0-24 months 
of age at enrollment) residing in the [LOCATION_002] through an online eQuestionnaire 
administered to the mother. Questions will include an estimation of the frequency of 
stools of varied consistency (e.g., liquid, soft/mushy, solid, firm, hard). After satisfying 
predetermined prescreen criteria (including distribution by [CONTACT_10609]), the mother will be 
provided access to the ClaimIt app along with the following information: 
 Overview of trial tasks and relevant notifications 
 Instruction on how to complete the electronic informed consent (eIC), screening 
and enrollment process 
 Instruction on how to interact with the ClaimIt app during the observation period 
 Additional study details & instructions  
The mother will be sent an electronic consent (eIC) for review and will have the 
opportunity to ask questions and receive answers either through online 
communication or in-person telephone conversation.  Mothers who choose to 
participate will voluntarily sign an eIC as instructed by [CONTACT_259881]. 
Screening and Enrollment 
After the eIC is voluntarily signed, a detailed eQuestionnaire for confirmation of 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will be administered to the mother. She will also be 
with a corresponding score, within 10 days of receiving ClaimIt app access. The mother 
and infant/toddler will be enrolled into the study if the mother successfully uploads 
the test images and scores and meets all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria 
for the study based on PI [INVESTIGATOR_137929]. Depending on the distribution of stool images 
already acquired per score, the mothers and infant/toddlers may be further qualified 
based on the likelihood of filling gaps in the image collection.

follows:  
 Stool images will be taken with a smartphone (or alternative suitable for 
capturing and transmitting high-quality, electronic images) and uploaded daily 
 Every bowel movement will be photographed, potentially providing several 
images per day 
o Only 1 representative image per bowel movement should be transmitted 
 If the mother has not uploaded an image in 24 hours, a notification and the 
Compliance eQuestionnaire requiring a response will be sent to her (Appendix IV) 
 The following steps should be taken to ensure the image quality: 
o The pi[INVESTIGATOR_259863] a well-lit room and with sufficient lighting on 
the diaper itself; pi[INVESTIGATOR_259864] 
o The diaper should be placed on a table or area apart from any other objects; 
primarily only the soiled portion of the diaper should be in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] 
o The diaper must be fully opened, and the contents must be clearly visible in 
the photograph

 Along with each stool image uploaded, mothers will rate the stool consistency 
type compared to examples provided by [CONTACT_259882] (Score 1 to 7) 
o Scoring will be based only on consistency, not color 
o Sample images of each score will be provided 
 A total of two empty (no stool) disposable diapers, spread open, are to be 
submitted: one at Baseline and one at the End of Study 
o Images should be taken of the type of diaper used most frequently for the 
infant/toddler  
o Additional empty (no stool) disposable diaper images may only be 
submitted if the brand/type of diaper is changed; if only the diaper size 
changes, no additional pi[INVESTIGATOR_259866]

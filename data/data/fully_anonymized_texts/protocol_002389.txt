Study Design  This is a prospective/retrospective, multicenter, nonrandomized, parallel  
group, controlled, assessor  masked interventional study. Both eyes of a 
subject must qualify for enrollment into this study. To reduce bias, 
manifest refraction, V A  and contrast sensitivity  
assessors  will be masked to  the IOLs that have been previously 
implanted in the  subject until the end of the study . To minimize bias, 
Alcon personnel (including biostatistics , masked data manager,  and

7.1 Study Design  
This is a prospective/retrospective, multicenter, nonrandomized, parallel  group, controlled, 
assessor  masked interventional study. Both eyes of a subject must qualify for enr ollment into 
this study. To reduce bias, manifest refraction, V A  and contrast sensitivity  
assessors will be masked to IOLs that have been previously implanted in the  subject until the 
end of the study. To minimize bias, Alcon personnel (including biostatistics , masked data 
manager,  and clinical project lead) will also be masked to the IOLs that have been previously 
implanted in the subject, to the extent possible.  
A total of [ADDRESS_861974] 
approximately 2 weeks. The visits include a Screening visit (Visit 0) and 1 visit after 
screening (Visit 1)  that should occur [ADDRESS_861975] one day after the 
Screening visit and it is recommended that is occur a max of 14 days after screening. The 
study is expected to be completed in approximately 5 months.  
The study population consists of male and female subjects 18 years  of age and older that 
were previously implanted bilaterally with the Clareon Vivity/Clareon Vivity Toric IOLs or 
Clareon Monofocal/Clareon Toric IOLs . Visit [ADDRESS_861976] 3 months and up to 6

Alcon – Business Use Only  The first operative eye is defined as the eye that was implanted first. The second operative 
eye is defined as the eye that was implanted second.  (Note: Eyes that are implanted on the 
same day are acceptable in this study.)  
It is aimed to enroll  approximately 2 10 subjects  to complete approximately 190 subjects at 
the final study visit (approximately 95 in each arm). This assumes approximately a 9.5% 
screen failure rate . Up to 12 US investigative sites  are planned for this study . Site specific 
targets will be adjusted based on individual site capabilities.  
7.2 Rationale for Study Design  
Registration of the Clareon Vivity and Clareon Vivity Toric IOLs has been achieved utilizing 
clinical safety and performance data from its parent IOL models: AcrySof IQ Vivity, 
AcrySof IQ Toric, and Clareon monofocal. This study seeks to generate clinical data from 
previously implanted subjects to augment parent model data and support clinical benefit  
statements  with model  specific data.   
Subjects in this study, in both test and control groups , have prior bilateral IOL implants with 
no new surgical interventions under the current protocol. The assessments are similar to a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_644083] (e.g., V A/performance testing, slit lamp exam) are 
comm only performed by [CONTACT_644091]. Other assessments such as contrast sensitivity  
may not be commonly used but  are established techniques for ocular assessments that have 
been well  studied in the literature.  
To reduce bias, manifest refraction, VA  and contrast sensitivity  assessors 
will be masked to IOLs that have been previously implanted in the  subject until the end of the 
study  and testing methods have predefined procedures.

8 STUDY POPULATION  
The study population  consists of male and female subjects ( 18 years or older at the time of 
participation in the study) with previous bilateral implantation of Clareon Vivity/Clareon 
Vivity Toric or Clareon Monofocal/Clareon Toric IOLs for at least 3 months and up to 6 
months  (90 to 180 days)  after second eye implant.  It is aimed to enroll  (consent)  
approximately [ADDRESS_861978] 
in each group: Clareon Vivity/Clareon Vivity Toric or Clareon Monofocal/Clareon Toric, if 
possible. This is recommended but not required. Site-specific targets will vary based upon  
individual site capabilities. Estimated time needed to recruit s ubjects for the study is 
approximately 4 months ; however, unanticipated circumstances may shorten or lengthen this 
time and would not require amendment of this protocol . Because  a 9.5% screening failure 
rate is expected, approximately 210 subjects are expe cted to be enrolled.   
This protocol allows enrollment of the following vulnerable population(s), with associated 
justification for each population:   
Elderly  – It is appropriate to include the elderly  in this clinical  study , as IOL implantation  is 
intended  to treat age -related cataract formation and is common  to this population .   
The elderly will be protected through the informed consent process, which will include any 
risks specific to the elderly  subjects, as well as any specific responsibilities associa ted with 
their participation.  In addition, an IRB/IEC will review and approve the inclusion of elderly  
subjects in this clinical study  prior to enrollment of elderly  subjects. Any specific 
requirements imposed by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC regarding participation of elderly subjects will be

In addition to reporting all AEs (serious and nonserious) meeting the definiti ons, the 
investigator must report any occurrence of the following as an SAE:  
• Cystoid macular edema  
• Hypopyon  
• Endophthalmitis  
• Lens dislocation from posterior chamber

Any other potentially sight -threatening event may also be  considered serious based on the 
judgment of the investigator and should be reported appropriately as delineated in Section 
11.3 (Procedures  for Recording and Reporting) . 
Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency may or may not be associated with subject ha rm (i .e., ADE or SADE); 
however, not all ADEs or SADEs are due to a device deficiency. The investigator should 
determine the applicable category for the identified or suspect device deficiency and report 
any subject harm separately.  Examples of device defi ciencies include the following : 
• Failure to meet product specifications (e.g., incorrect IOL power ) 
• IOL defect  
• Scratched IOL  
• Lack of performance

issue  or worsening of an existing health issue  since your last study visit? ” 
In addition, changes in any protocol -specific parameters  and/or questionnaires evaluated 
during the study are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_093]. Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter or questionnaire response that is 
clinically relevant, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], is to be reporte d as an AE. These 
clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality.  
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting  
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent. Any preexisting  medical conditions or 
signs/symptoms present in a subject p rior to the start of the study (i.e., before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study and should be recorded in the Medical 
History section of the eCRF.  
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include  date of 
occurrence, severity, treatment (if applicable), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality. In addition, the investigator must document all device deficiencies reported or 
observed with test and comparator  product s on the Device Deficiency e CRF. The site must 
submit all available information on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the study sponsor 
as follows:  
• All SAEs must be reported immediately (within 24 hours) of the investigator ’s or 
site’s awareness .  
• ADEs that do not meet seriousnes s criteria and device deficiencies must be reported 
within 10 calendar days of the investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .  
• A printed copy of the completed Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect 
and/or Device Deficiency  eCRF  must be included with product returns.   
• Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.  
• Document any changes to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.  
• Document all relevant information from D ischarge Summary, Autopsy Report, 
Certificate of Death etc., if applicable, in narrative section of the Serious Adverse 
Event  and Adverse Device Effect eCRF . 
Note: Should the EDC system become nonoperational , the site must complete the appropriate

timelines outlined above; however, the reported information must be entered into the E DC 
system once it becomes operational.  
In addition to recording all AEs into the EDC system, any AEs and device deficiencies for 
non-study marketed devices/products will be considered and processed as spontaneous 
following the postmarket vigilance procedur es and should be communicated to the 
device ’s/product ’s manufacturer as per local requirements.  
Study sponsor representatives may be contact[CONTACT_644099].  
Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency being reported, the study 
sponsor may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_13271] ’s medical records. The 
investigator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory authorities or IRB/IEC.  
Intensity and Causality Assessments  
Where appropriate, the investigator must assess the intensity (severity) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:  
Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign or 
symptom.  
Moderate  An AE is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort sig nificant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability to work or engage in their usual activities.  
 
For every AE in the study, the investigator must assess the causality (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study procedure). An assessment of causality will also be performed 
by [CONTACT_432574], as shown below:  
Causality

Not Related  An AE classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or simply 
unlikely to be related (i .e., there are other more likely causes for the AE).  
The study sponsor will assess the AEs and may upgrade the investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality. The study sponsor will notify the investigator of any AEs that is

Alcon – Business Use Only  11.6 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study.  
The investigator should provide the study sponsor with any new safety information (which 
includes ne w AEs and changes to previously reported AEs) that may affect the safety 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study, any additional information received at follow -up should be documented in the eCRFs 
up to study completion (i .e., database lock).  
All complaints received after study completion will be considered and processed as 
spontaneous (following the postmarket  vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to 
the medical device ’s manufacturer as per local requirements.  
The investigator should also report complaints on non -Alcon products directly to the 
manufacturer as per the manufacturer ’s instructions or lo cal regulatory requirements .  
Pregnancy in the Clinical Study : Pregnancy is not reportable as an AE; however, 
complications may be reportable and will be decided on a case -by-case basis.  
12  ANALYSIS PLAN  
In general, descriptive statistics generated for an e ndpoint will be based upon the type of 
parameter (i.e., whether the data is categorical or continuous) being analyzed. For categorical 
parameters, the statistics used to summarize the data descriptively include sample size, 
number in the category, and perc ent in the category. For continuous parameters, sample size, 
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum will be presented.  
Analysis assumptions will be periodically reviewed during study conduct for deviations from 
analysis assumptions or the presence of outliers. The statistical methods should only be 
modified if there is a significant risk that the validity of the results ca n be substantively 
impacted. Because the study  is open label, any discussion of analysis assumptions should not 
be based on review of any results by [CONTACT_1570].

AEs that occur after signing informed consent.  
12.7 Interim Analyses  and Reporting  
No interim analyses are planned.  
12.8 Sample Size Justification  
A total of 210 subjects will be enrolled (approximately 105 per arm). Assuming a screen 
failure rate of 9.5%, approximately 190 subjects will be evaluable at Visit 1 (95 per arm). The 
power estimates for the planned analyses are presented below:  
Order  Endpoint  Comparison  Noninferiority 
Margin  Expected 
difference  SD^ Power  
Co Primary  Binocular BCDVA  Noninfer iority  0.10 0.04 0.14 90% 
Co Primary  Binocular DCIVA at 66 cm  Superiority  NA 0.085  0.14 > 98%

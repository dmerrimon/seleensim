1.1 Background  
Influenza viruses types A and B belong to the genus Orthomyxoviridae and are characterized as 
enveloped, negative -strand, segmented r ibonucleic acid (RNA ) viruses. The viral envelope 
contains 2 virus -coded glycoprotein spi[INVESTIGATOR_2988], the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) 
proteins, which are key antigens in the host response to influenza virus in both natural 
infection  and vaccination. A third protein, M2, is a minor envelope component of the A -strain 
viruses.  
Influenza is transmitted through inhalation of virus -containing droplets from infected individuals. 
The incubation period is usually [ADDRESS_904147] before illness onset (within 24 hours), rapi[INVESTIGATOR_190562], and remains elevated for 1 to 2 days before rapi[INVESTIGATOR_644212]. Usually, virus shedding 
lasts a total of 5 to 10 days.  
There is considerable variation in the severity of illness in different individuals, partly due to age, general health, and immune status relative to previous influenza infections  and vaccination . The 
classic symptoms include rapid onset (12 hours or less) of malaise, fever, myalgia, headache, and a non- productive cough or sore throat. Most symptoms last several days, but malaise and cough 
may last for a week or more. Complications of i nfluenza include primary viral pneumonia, 
secondary bacterial pneumonia, and exacerbation of underlying medical conditions such as 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure.  
While influenza affects all age groups, seniors , childre n younger than 5 years of age,  and persons 
with underlying health problems are at increased risk for complications. Members of high- risk 
groups who become ill with influenza are more likely than the general population to require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_669480] (e.g., pneumonia and cardiovascular events) . 
Groups considered at higher risk for influenza -related complications includ e persons aged ≥65 
years  due to immunosenescence and a dults 50–[ADDRESS_904148] to continuous and sequential evolution within  immune or partially immune 
populations. Antigenic drift results from mutation(s) affecting the RNA segment coding for either HA or NA, but more commonly HA. As a result, there is alteration in protein structure involving 
1 or a few amino acids, resulting in minor changes in antigenicity. Antigenic variants within a 
subtype (e.g., H1 or H3) emerge and through natural selection gradually become the more predominant circulating virus strain, while the preceding antigenic variant is suppressed by 
[CONTACT_669495]. In contrast to antigenic drift, antigenic shift represents the 
emergence of completely new subtypes, typi[INVESTIGATOR_644214]. Antigenic shift 
occurs at irregular intervals and may lead to pandemics. While influenza B appears to be more 
genetically stable than influenza A, the dominant circulating B strain typi[INVESTIGATOR_669481]. For over a decade, both Yamagata and Vic toria lineages have co -circulated during each 
Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center

Page [ADDRESS_904149] the other. Accordingly, switching from a trivalent vaccine to a quadrivalent 
vaccine is expected to prevent additional morbidity and mortality associated with mismatched 
influenza B strains that may occur with trivalent vaccines. With this in mind, Flublok 
Quadrivalent vaccine w ere developed.  
Vaccination with influenza vaccine is the primary method for preventing influenza and its severe complications. It has been shown to be effective in reducing influenza- associated morbidity and 
mortality in groups at increased risk for influenza- related complications such as infants and young 
children  and persons 50 years of age and older.  Of note , immune responses to the vaccine are 
lower in seniors than those in young healthy adults. Strategies to improve immune r esponses to 
the vaccine in the elderly population could provide significant additional reductions in influenza -
associated morbidity and mortality. One approach is to increase the dose of HA in vaccines. Previous studies evaluating the immune responses in t erms of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) 
antibodies with higher doses of HA per strain in different influenza vaccines support a dose -
response effect.  
Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine is a recombinant HA influenza vaccine indicated for active immunization aga inst disease caused by [CONTACT_14302] A subtype viruses and type B viruses contained 
in the vaccine for adults 18 years of age and older. Use of recombinant DNA techniques to produce vaccine antigen expressed in cell culture is a method that avoids growing the influenza 
viruses in embryonated hen’s eggs. Recombinant technology also allows control over the 
sequence of the full -length HA produced. The recombinant proteins are highly purified and the 
vaccine contain s no egg protein, preservatives , or antibiotics, a ny of which may produce 
hypersensitivity reaction in some individuals.  
Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine contains [ADDRESS_904150] -dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine ( SD-IIV4 ). The hi gh 
purity of a recombinant antigen enables administration of a  higher concentration of HA antigen  
without a n increase in adverse effects in humans. This higher dose of antigen may be a particular 
advantage to older adults whose immune responses to influenz a vaccines can be suboptimal.  
During this study, Flublok Quadrivalent or SD -IIV will be administered according to the 
guidelines in the Prescribing Information materials and only to persons for whom it is indicated. 
The 2018–2019, 2019–2020, and 2020–2021  formulations of recombinant influenza vaccine 
(Flublok
 Quadrivalent  vaccine)  and SD -IIV will be evaluated as described below.  
The overall objective of this study is to describe the effectiveness  of Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine 
compared to SD -IIV in adults 18 through 64 years of age.

Previous Clinical Experience: Flublok Vaccine  
Flublok vaccine (trivalent formulation) was first approved in the [LOCATION_002] on 16 January 
2013 for use in adults 18–49 years of age. Licensure was bas ed on results of a randomized 
controlled efficacy trial of Flublok vs placebo in 2344 subjects. The age indication was expanded to include all adults 18 years of age and older in 2014 based on safety and immunogenicity data 
from 2 studies; the first was co nducted among 869 adults 65 years of age and older and the second 
was conducted among 602 adults 50–64 years of age.  
Flublok Quadrivalent Vaccine  
On 07 October 2016, the FDA licensed Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine for adults 18 years of age and older. This a pproval was based on 2 studies conducted during the 2014–2015 influenza 
season: (1)  an immunogenicity and safety study of Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine versus SD -IIV4 
in 1350 adults 18–49 years of age and (2) an efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety study of  
Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine versus SD -IIV4 in 9003 adults 50 years of age and older. In the 
former study (of adults 18–49 years of age), immunogenicity of Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine 
was non- inferior to that of the SD -IIV4 comparator for 3 of the 4 anti gens; the response to the B 
Victoria lineage strain did not meet the non- inferiority criteria but the response was low in both 
vaccine groups, making comparisons uninterpretable. In the latter efficacy study of adults 50 
years of age and older, Flublok Qua drivalent vaccine, compared to the SD -IIV4 comparator, 
demonstrated 30% to 43% greater efficacy in preventing laboratory- confirmed, protocol -defined 
influenza -like-illness caused by [CONTACT_654754].  
The most common local adverse reactions (ARs) to Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine include 
tenderness and pain at the injection site. The most common systemic reactions include headache, 
fatigue, myalgia, and arthralgia , with most events being mild to moderate in severity. Safety 
profiles of Flublok influenza vaccine and inactivated influenza vaccine (trivalent and quadrivalent 
comparisons) were demonstrated to be similar in clinical trials.

a schedule that alternates which vaccine is supplied to each in fluenza clinic throughout the 3- year 
study period.  
We will block facilities and randomize within blocks  (see Section 5.1.4 ), ensuring that roughly 
half the facilities within each block initially administer Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine and the 
other half a dminister a SD-IIV. After the initial supply, the half that started with Flublok 
Quadrivalent vaccine will be supplied with a SD-IIV, and the half that started with a SD-IIV will 
be supplied with Flublok  Quadrivalent vaccine (see Figure 1 ). The supply of e ach clinic will then 
alternate between the two vaccines; that is, Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine alternating with a SD-
IIV with each delivery of vaccine to the clinics .  
  
 
Data Extraction  
Pertinent d ata will be extracted from the KPNC databases to create study datasets in the required 
file format for analysis (e.g., Excel spreadsheets, SAS datasets). Databases from which data will 
be extracted include various encounters (inpatient, outpatient, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], emergency 
department, etc.), laborator y tests, documentation of immunizations (e.g., influenza vaccination 
history), and clinical outcomes and diagnoses, as well as demographic and membership data.  
The data analyst will perform validation of the study data throughout the data management 
proces s by [CONTACT_669501]:  
• Internal consistency checks (e.g. data undergo range checks, including consistency of 
dates of birth with vaccination dates, checks for completeness and missing values, etc.)  
• External data checks  (e.g. data from one database may be compared with data from other 
databases)  
• Error checks written for specific databases.

Page 18 of 43 5.1.4 Vaccin e Distribution  Procedures  
Based on prior annual influenza vaccine use, we anticipate that KPNC will administer influenza 
vaccin es to approximately 800,000 individuals aged 18–64 years, including 350,000 persons  aged 
50–64 years  each season . 
Approximately 400,000 doses of Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine and 400,000 doses of comparator  
SD-IIV will be administered to adults aged 18–64 years in each of the influenza seasons 2018–
2019, 2019–2020 , and 2020–2021 .  
There are approximately 70 facilities that receive individual influenza vaccine shipments from the KPNC Central Pharmacy (the exact number varies slightly each year ; see Figure 2  for an example 
of the flow). KPNC Central Pharmacy begins “autoshipments” to the Medical Centers and their 
satellite facilities’ main pharmacies in August in preparation for annual influenza vaccination 
clinics. For purposes of this study, medical  center facilities include all associated satellite sites. 
KPNC Central Pharmacy determines the amount of vaccines to be shipped each day to the medical center facilities based upon vaccine use the previous year at each facility. For example, 
since Oakland  Medical Center administered ~5% of all vaccines during the 2017–2018 influenza 
season, they would receive 5% of the daily shipment of vaccines during the subsequent 2018–[ADDRESS_904161] additional vaccine as needed.  
 
Once the facilities receive adequate influenza vaccines to distribute to all of  their influenza 
vaccination clinics, they will prepare vaccine allotments for specific patient populations within each clinic (e.g., adult medicine, OB/GYN). We propose to random ize these facilities to distribute 
(and therefore administer ) either Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine or a SD-IIV initially  to all of their 
influenza vaccination clinics . Roughly half the facilities will first distribute Flublok Quadrivalent 
vaccine to be admi nistered by  [CONTACT_669502], while the other half will 
first distribute a SD-IIV for administration by [CONTACT_669502] . The 
facilities will follow a weekly alternating schedule  (with some variation due to u sage)  that 
indicates which vaccine is to be internally distributed to associated departments and clinics for the entire influenza season. Historically, >75% of vaccinations to adults aged 18–64 are administered 
prior to Thanksgiving.

Page [ADDRESS_904162] (see Section 1 1.1 for further details).  
In order to randomize which facilities will initially administer Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine and 
which will start with a SD-IIV, we will block facilities by [CONTACT_669503]. For example, 
there may be 4 facilities per block, and within the block, 2 facilities start with Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine and 2 facilities start with a SD-IIV.  
Staff Training: Pharmacy Staff, Influenza Clinic Injection Nurses , and Nurse Managers  
KPVSC will work closely with the KPNC Central Pharmacy, the KPNC influenza program 
manager, the pharmacy staff , and influenza coordinators at the ~[ADDRESS_904163] trainings with the pharmacy staff, influenza coordinators, and department managers so that all relevant staff 
are aware that Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine or a SD-IIV should be routinely administered to 
everyone 18–64 years of age without any preference for one vaccine over the other, and that vaccine use should be based only on what is available in the clinic at the time of vaccination.  
In particular, we will emphasize that the injection nurse administering the vaccine should not preferentially choose one vaccine over the other, but instead use wha t is available in the 
refrigerator or portable cold storage box for the day. Based on routine influenza clinic operations, there is little potential for bias at the level of vaccine administration level  (e.g., an injection nurse 
preferentially choosing one  vaccine over the other) , especially early in the season, when large 
numbers of influenza vaccine are administered on any given day ; injection nurses are unlikely to 
spend time searching for a specific formulation based on preference. Further, by [CONTACT_669504], we will reduce the likelihood that both Flublok Quadrivalent 
vaccine and SD-IIV are simultaneously available in the clinic . By [CONTACT_669505] 18 –64 years (Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine or SD-IIV), we hope to 
reduce the likelihood that an injection nurse is able to choose one vaccine over the other.  
Because influenza vaccine is used at a very rapid pace once influenza clinics officially begin 
administering vaccine, the departments and clinics may request vaccine replenishment prior to the 
next distribution in order to ensure adequate supply. For this reason, it may be possible that a 
particular clinic will have both Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine and a SD-IIV available.  
On a weekly ba sis, we will also monitor both the distribution of vaccine from KPNC Central 
Pharmacy to the facility pharmacies, as well as influenza vaccine administration. If we detect  
imbalances  at either of these points, we will work closely with the affected facility(s) to attempt to 
correct the imbalance. Additional details may be found in Section  11.1.

10 Data Collection and Management  
10.1 Data Collection  
Pertinent d ata will be extracted from the KPNC databases to create study datasets in the required 
file format for analysis (e.g., Excel spreadsheets, SAS datasets). Databases from which data will be extracted include various encounters (inpatient, outpatient, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], e mergency 
department, etc.), laboratory tests, documentation of immunizations (e.g., influenza vaccination history), and clinical outcomes and diagnoses, as well as demographic and membership data.  
Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center    
 
Confidential/Proprietary Information  
Page [ADDRESS_904189] will perform validation of  the study data throughout the data management 
process by [CONTACT_669501]:  
• Internal consistency checks (e.g. data undergo range checks, including consistency of 
dates of birth with vaccination dates, checks for comple teness and missing values, etc.)  
• External data checks (e.g. data from one database may be compared with data from other databases)  
• Error checks written for specific databases.  
10.[ADDRESS_904190] the null hypothesis that Flublok 
is not any more effective than the comparator  (i.e., a superiority test), using a [ADDRESS_904191], p<0.05.  
The primary analyses will use Cox regression to obtain an adjusted estimate of the relative hazard 
ratio ( rHR) for each outcome, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, facil ity, and time -since -
vaccination. The rHR at any point in the follow -up period is the instantaneous relative risk (RR) at 
that time (i.e., we are estimating rVE by (1 –rHR), and testing the null hypothesis that  rHR=0 ). In 
addition, we may adjust for an avail able comorbidity score and/or a measure of prior exposure to 
influenza vaccines (e.g., exposure to flu vaccine in the prior year, or number of flu shots in the 
past three years) . 
Risk sets will be conditioned (i.e., stratified) on  calendar day, using a cal endar timeline for the 
Cox regression. We expect many people to be vaccinated both years, and some might get 
“breakthrough” influenza both years . Getting Flublok in one year  should be entirely unrelated to 
getting Flublok in another year, so robust standard errors are not needed.  We will check our 
assumption that the vaccine received in one year is not rel ated to vaccine received the next year.   
For each type of outcome, foll ow-up would end at the first outcome event in a season but could 
restart the next year when the individual is vaccinated again.  
We do not know whether prior vaccination (i.e., booster or priming effect) affects VE of either Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine or SD-IIV, but we hypothesize that prior vaccination might be  an 
effect modifier but not  a potential confounder because what patients are vaccinated with in prior 
years should not be associated with what vaccine they receive in any of the 3 study seasons . We 
Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center

Page [ADDRESS_904192] to ascertain if, as expected, there is (1) no correlation between prior vaccination (before 
the study period) and vaccination during the  3 study seasons, and (2) no correlation between the  
type of vaccine received in one season and the type of va ccine received in any other  study 
season (s). If we find that there is a relationship in either of these scenarios, we can treat prior 
vaccination (“prior” meaning before the study commenced, or “prior” as in vaccination in the first 
study season relative t o the second study season) as a potential confounder. We would add 
variables that adjust for whether a patient was vaccinated  during the past year(s) , as well as which 
vaccine type they received. Further, if prior vaccination does modify VE , we may have ad equate 
power to assess whether there is a boosting effect given our large sample size.  
There is little possibility of confounding that may occur between patients tested versus those who 
are not tested. While not everyone with suspected influenza will be te sted, the randomization 
process in vaccine supply (Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine versus  SD-IIV) should result in an equal 
distribution of those who are and are not tested between the two vaccine groups throughout the season.  We will attempt to mitigate poss ible bias and confounding as much as possible upfront by 
[CONTACT_669515].  Because 
factors related to testing should be balanced, there is no reason to believe that the likelihood of 
being test ed will be related to whether a person received Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine or SD-IIV.  
We will also be monitoring the balance of potent ial confounders  that may be related to influenza 
and to PCR testing in order to confirm that we are achieving the balance intended by [CONTACT_669516] -
randomiz ed shipment of vaccines to clinics . Once vaccinations begin, we will monitor on a 
weekly basis the balan ce of Flublok vaccinees versus SD -IIV vaccinees with respect to facility, 
sex, and age group (18–49 years and 50–64 years). Additional demographic variables such as race and ethnicity may also be monitored . We will also monitor balance with respect to  como rbidit ies 
such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and diabetes  (to be specified 
further  in the SAP) . If we find that any facility is using Flublok or SD -IIV more (or less) than 
needed to achieve balance, we will work with the influenz a program manager to adjust  what is 
being administered. If despi[INVESTIGATOR_180314], there is still imbalance, we can address these 
imbalances at the analysis stage, adjusting  for, or stratifying by , the relevant covariates .  
We plan to assess the outcomes that  occur  ≥[ADDRESS_904193] appropriate determination for h ow 
to handle such cases. 
  
For outcomes not based on PCR -confirmed influenza (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_669488]-
respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343]), we will develop an algorithm (to be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan) 
to measure the intensity of influenza circulation to guide when to start and stop following for such 
events (e.g., as determined by [CONTACT_8106], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_669489]).

Page 33 of 43 ratio of 1:1 implies that each year, KPNC would give Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine to 400,000 
members aged 18 –64 years, and SD -IIV to another 400,000 similar KPNC members.    
Each row of the table s in the Appendices ( Section 1 5) shows power for a possible scenario for a 
given outcome and a specific age range. The expected incidence of the outcome in vaccinees who 
received SD-IIV (based on incidence observed in the 2016–2017 influenza season)  is in column 4; 
the relative risk ( estimated by [CONTACT_669517] ) associated with getting Flublok 
Quadrivalent vaccine versus a comparator is in column 5; the corresponding rVE in column 6; and 
the power in the last column. These power calculations estimate our power to test the  null 
hypothesis that Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine VE does not differ from SD -IIV(s).  
Because the comparison group will not be unvaccinated—they are getting SD-IIV—we will be 
estimating and testing r VE: i.e., the percent reduction in the incidence of “breakthrough cases” 
(e.g., influenza epi[INVESTIGATOR_669490]) that results from the use of Flublok Quadrivalent vaccine 
rather than the SD -IIV vaccines.  
As an example, for the outcome of PCR -confirmed flu diagnosis, the first row of the first table 
indicates that p ower is very high (>0.99) to detect a rVE of 0.30 (which amounts to a 30% rVE) in 
a 3-year study of vaccinees aged 18–64 years, assuming that influenza incidence in the 
comparator arm will be the same as it was in the 2016 –[ADDRESS_904196] a rVE of 10% rather than 5% agai nst test -positive

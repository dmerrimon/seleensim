1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
This Phase 3 study is part of a clinical program to support the development of a saxagliptin 5 mg -
dapagliflozin 10 mg fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapy for the treatment of T2DM. In subjects 
with T2DM who are inadequately controlled on metformin therapy with or without a sulfonylurea, 
this study will compare the efficacy and safety of the addition of saxagliptin-dapagliflozin versus the 
addition of insulin. The complementary mechanisms of action of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin, in 
combination with metformin, have been shown in previous studies to provide superior HbA1c 
lowering compared to either of the individual agents alone in subjects with inadequately controlled 
T2DM. 
As a FDC therapy, saxagliptin-dapagliflozin provides a new treatment option for T2DM patients. 
Dapagliflozin inhibits renal glucose reabsorption and acts independently of insulin, while saxagliptin 
enhances glucose-mediated insulin secretion by a glucose-dependent mechanism (via incretin effect).  
Saxagliptin and dapagliflozin have demonstrated, both individually, in combination and in 
combination with metformin with or without SU, a favorable safety and tolerability profile.  They have 
shown as single agents, as well as in combination with metformin, a low propensity for hypoglycemia 
consistent with their respective glucose dependent mechanism of action, therefore addressing a 
potential key concern when adding a glucose lowering agent. Both drugs have either demonstrated 
moderate weight reduction (dapagliflozin) or weight neutrality (saxagliptin) and do not require dose 
titration or injection, simplifying therapy compared to insulin. 
While insulin is an effective glycemic treatmen t for T2DM, insulin is associated with several 
undesirable side effects that can negatively affect patient compliance and limit its effectiveness.  These 
include increased risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain. Hypoglycemia is a clinically important 
barrier to optimizing treatment and there is emerging evidence that hypoglycemia is associated with 
negative cardiovascular outcomes. Over 85% of patients with T2DM are overweight or obese, and 
additional weight gain is undesirable and often results in reduced treatment compliance by [CONTACT_13935]. 
In addition, not all patients are willing or able to inject insulin and keep up with the regular blood 
glucose monitoring required by [CONTACT_398487]. 
Research Hypothesis:   
In subjects with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control treated with metformin with or 
without SU, co-administration of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin over an open-label treatment period of 
24 weeks will result in glycemic control, measured by [CONTACT_13505]1c that is non-inferior compared to the 
addition of insulin glargine. 
Schedule of Analyses: 
This analysis plan presents the objectives, endpoints, and analyses that will be conducted once all 
randomized subjects have either completed or been discontinued from the short-term open-label 
period.  All relevant queries must be resolved and the database must be locked for this period before 
the analyses.  Short-term plus long-term objectives, endpoints, and analyses performed at the time of 
the final database lock are also specified within this SAP. 
2 STUDY DESCRIPTION 
2.1 Study Design 
The CV181369 study is a randomized, open-label, two arm, parallel group, active-controlled, 
multicenter, Phase 3b study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin co-administered with 
dapagliflozin compared to insulin glargine. Subjects with documented T2DM and inadequate 
glycemic control (central laboratory HbA1c value t 8% and d 12% at screening) on a stable dose of 
metformin t 1500 mg/day for at least [ADDRESS_502019] 50% the maximal dose per local label for at least 8 weeks prior to screening visit will 
be enrolled. The primary endpoint of HbA1c will be assessed at 24 weeks; however, the trial will 
continue to 52 weeks as a long-term extension. 
The study design schematic is presented in Figure 2.1-1 . 
Figure 2.1-1: Study Design Schematic 
 
 
Approximately 171 sites will randomize a combined total of approximately 598 subjects (299 subjects 
per treatment arm). Allowing approximately 12 months for patient recruitment, this study will be 
conducted over 24 months. 
Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) is a useful technology (in addition to HbA1c) to qualitatively, 
as well as quantitatively, monitor glycemic control in the form of time spent in the 
euglycemic/hyperglycemic/hypoglycemic (blood glucose d 70 mg/dL) ranges and the mean amplitude 
of glucose excursions (MAGE).  In this protocol, a subpopulation of approximately 250 randomized 
subjects ( a125 subject/treatment arm) who agree to participate (separate informed consent) will have 
CGM performed for periods of 7 days at 4 different timepoints throughout the study (Week -2 to -1 
(referred to as Baseline), Week 2 to 3 (referred to as Week 2), Week 11 to 12 (referred to as Week 
12), and Week 23 to 24 (referred to as Week 24)). Lead-In

2.2 Treatment Assignment 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
. 
Subjects entering the 24-week open-l abel short-term treatment period 
Following completion of the lead-in period, subjects who meet the criteria will be randomly assigned 
by [CONTACT_398488] 1 Randomization visit, to one of the following two (2) open-label treatment 
arms in a 1:1 ratio:  
x saxagliptin 5 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg 
x titrated insulin glargine  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_398489] (metformin alone vs. 
metformin plus SU) at baseline to ensure equal representation across all treatment groups and also 
within the sub-study.  Subjects will continue to receive their stable dose of metformin with or without 
SU throughout the study. 
During the first 12 weeks following randomization, there will be no protocol specified rescue criteria.  
During this time, subjects receiving open-label insulin glargine will be titrated to target, which is 
driven over an (8) week period, then at Investigator’s discretion with minimal adjustment 
recommended.  Titration of open-label saxagliptin and dapagliflozin will not be allowed at any time 
during the study. 
Subjects entering the 28-week open-label long-term treatment period  
Subjects who complete the Short-term Treatment Period will continue into the Long-term Period 
taking the same open-label study medication (saxagliptin 5 mg QD and dapagliflozin 10 mg QD or 
insulin glargine) that they were randomized to on study Day 1. Subjects will continue to receive their 
stable dose of metformin with or without SU throughout the study. 
2.[ADDRESS_502020], the HbA1c values will no longer 
be masked.  All other laboratory values will be unmasked to both the investigator and the sponsor. 
2.4 Protocol Amendments 
There has currently been one protocol amendment and the information has been incorporated into this 
document. 
2.5 Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee 
A Clinical Event Committee (CEC) blinded to the treatment of the subjects, will independently 
adjudicate all events of heart failure with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
2.6 Hepatic Adjudication Committee 
An Independent Hepatic Adjudication Committee, blinded to the treatment of the subjects, will 
determine the probability that drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the cause of liver-related 
abnormalities, included but not limited to: 
x AST and/or ALT > 3X ULN and TB >[ADDRESS_502021] (within [ADDRESS_502022] and/or ALT elevation) 
x Hepatic events timely related to death (within 30 days before death) 
x AST and/or ALT > 10X ULN 
A separate Adjudication Charter will define and describe the procedure for the handling, reporting, 
and classification of these events.

4.4 Safety Endpoints 
The safety endpoints include: 
x The proportion of subjects with hypoglycemia events and the frequency and ADA 
classification of the hypoglycemia events during the Week 24 and Week 52 treatment periods 
x The proportion of subjects experiencing adverse events (AE) and marked abnormalities in 
clinical laboratory tests during the Week [ADDRESS_502025] any estimates of power, and their true values may not be 
known. Based on comparisons of results of longitudinal repeated measures analyses and analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) using last observation carried forward (LOCF) from previous diabetes trials, 
the estimated standard errors of the treatment differences were similar between analyses. Therefore, 
power calculations are based on ANCOVA with LOCF, with the expectation that this will provide a 
good estimate of the power for the primary analysis using a longitudinal repeated measures model. To 
demonstrate non-inferiority of saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin to insulin for changes from baseline to 
Week 24 in HbA1c within a non-inferiority margin of 0.30%, assuming a standard deviation 1.1%, 
and at a one-sided significance level of 0.025, 284 evaluable subjects will be needed in each treatment 
group to provide approximately 90% power (given a true difference of zero between the 2 treatment 
groups). Assuming that 5% of subjects do not have a post-baseline assessment, a total of approximately 
598 subjects (299 subjects per treatment arm) need to be randomized. Assuming that 50% of screened 
subjects will fail to meet screening criteria, a total of 1196 subjects need to be screened. 
 
6 STUDY PERIODS, TREATMENT REGIMENS AND POPULATIONS FOR 
ANALYSES 
6.1 Study Periods 
Study CV181-369 consists of 4 study periods: 
1) Screening period (Period A) . This period starts with enrollment (i.e., signature [INVESTIGATOR_87031]-
specific informed consent form constitutes the first procedure of the Screening period) and ends 
on the start of lead-in period.  Subjects should be on a stable dose of metformin  1500 mg/day for 
at least [ADDRESS_502026] 50% the 
maximal dose per local label.  
2) Lead-in period (Period B) . During this period, subjects will continue their diabetes management 
with stable dose of metformin 1500 mg/day with or without a stable dose of SU, diet and exercise.  
No placebo or study medication will be provided during the lead-in period. 
3) 24-week short-term open-label treatment period (Period C) . On the Day 1 visit, subjects who 
meet all the protocol-specific enrollment and randomization criteria will be randomized. 
4) 28-week long-term open-label treatment period (Period D) . After completing the short-term 
period, subjects will enter the 28-week open-label long-term treatment period. The start date of 
long-term treatment period is defined as the end date of short-term treatment period. This is the 
date when the subject entered the long-term treatment period and was dispensed long-term study 
medication. 
Follow-up non-treatment phase (Period X). Subjects who discontinue study treatment early will follow 
the same visit schedule as subjects who remain on treatment.  
6.2 Treatment Regimens 
On the Day 1 visit, subjects who meet all protocol enrollment and randomization criteria will be 
randomized into one of the two open-label treatment arms, in a 1:1 ratio: 
x Saxagliptin 5 mg QD and Dapagliflozin 10 mg QD  
x Titrated insulin glargine 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_398489] (metformin alone vs. 
metformin plus SU) at baseline to ensure equal representation across all treatment groups and also 
within the sub-study. Subjects will continue to receive their stable dose of metformin with or without 
SU throughout the study. The “as randomized” treatment group is defined as the treatment group to 
which a subject was randomized at the start of the open-label treatment period (even if the treatment 
they received was different).  The primary efficacy analyses will be performed using the Randomized 
Subjects Data Set. 
The “as treated” treatment group is the same as the “as randomized” treatment group, except in cases 
where information was available which indicated that a subject received a different treatment for the 
entire course of their participation in the study (or period). In this case, the “as treated” treatment group 
is set to the treatment the subject actually received. In case a subject never received the treatment as 
assigned by [CONTACT_17628], then the “as treated” treatment group is the first treatment received. 
 
6.[ADDRESS_502027] data set, subjects will be presented in 
the treatment group to which they were randomized at the start of the Short-term treatment Period 
(even if the treatment they received was different). This is also known as the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) 
population. This will be the primary efficacy data set. 
6.3.4 Full Analysis Set 
The full analysis set (FAS) is defined as all randomized subjects who take at least one dose of the 
study medication and have a baseline value for HbA1c.  Analysis of the FAS will be based on the randomized treatment. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_502028] the interpretability of the study results. This is 
also known as the Per-protocol population All decisions to exclude patients and/or data from the 
Randomized Subjects Data Set will be made prior to un-blinding the study and agreed by [CONTACT_123894].
 
6.3.[ADDRESS_502029]+LT will consist of all subjects who receive at least one 
dose of study medication during the short-term treatment period. This will be the primary safety data 
set. Data in this data set will be analyzed based on randomized treatment, except in cases where a 
subject received a different treatment for the entire course of his/her participation in the treatment 
period. In this case, safety data for such a subject will be analyzed based on the first treatment the 
subject actually received. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_502030] treatment period (even if the treatment 
they received in the ST or LT was different.  
 
7 STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
7.1 General Methods 
7.1.1 Definitions 
[IP_ADDRESS] Baseline Value  
Unless otherwise stated, for each subject, baseline value of a parameter (e.g., efficacy laboratory 
parameter, safety laboratory test, ECG or physical measurement endpoint) is defined as the last 
assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the study medication.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Change and Percent Change from Baseline 
Change from baseline to any Week t in short-term treatment period or ST +LT is defined as follows: 
 
CWeek t = M Week t - M baseline ,  
 
 
Percent change from baseline to any Week t in short-term treatment period is defined as follows: 
 
PWeek t =100×(M Week t - M baseline ) / M baseline . 
 
Where PWeek t is the percent change from baseline at Week t, and MWeek t  and Mbaseline are 
defined as above. 
 
The  “Week  t”  to  which  a  measurement  belongs  is  determined  using  the  conventions described 
in Section 8.2 and Section 8.4. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Handling of Missing Data 
The main analysis for change from baseline specified for primary and secondary endpoints in 
following sections will use the repeated measures model.  For subjects who started rescue 
medication, measurements taken prior to the date of the first dose of rescue medication will be 
used. This model assumes that the time course of the endpoint values for subjects who discontinue 
treatment or are rescued at a specified time point is  consistent with the time course for subjects who 
are ongoing at that time point. 
 
While utilizing models such as ANOVA, for example, in analysis of change (or percent change) from baseline as well as glycemic response endpoint at Week 24 LOCF, the measurement assigned 
as the Week 24 measurement will be used.  If no  Week  4 measurement is available (subject has 

discontinued before Week [ADDRESS_502031] was not 
discontinued), then the last ava ilable earlier post- ba seline measurement will be used (LOCF). For 
subjects who started rescue medication prior to Week 24, their last post-baseline measurement taken prior to the date of the first dose of rescue medication will be used. 
 
Section [ADDRESS_502032] treatment. 
7.1.2    Longitudinal Repeated Measures Analysis 
 
A longitudinal repeated measures analysis using ‘direct likelihood’ will be performed. The SAS 
procedure PROC MIXED will be use d. The preferred model will include the fixed categorical effects 
of treatment, week and treatment-by-week interaction as well as the continuous fixed covariates of 
baseline measurement and baseline measurement-by-week interaction. 
 
The following model will be used: 
 
Cijk  = intercept + ß1  [Mbaseline,ij ] + Ĳi  + Ȧm  + Į k+ (Į Ĳ)ik  + (Į Mbaseline )ijk  + error ijk 
(Model [IP_ADDRESS]) 
 
where 
 

An unstructured matrix for the within-subject error variance-covariance will be used. The 
denominator degrees of freedom will be calculated according to the Kenward-Roger method. 
 
In case of non-convergence of the preferred model or memory space issues, the following back-up models are defined: 
 
 
The second back-up model will only be provided if the first back-up model does not converge or 
has memory issues. 

The model will provide least-squares mean estimates, standard errors and 2-sided 95% 
confidence intervals for mean change at all time points within and between treatments. 
Pre-specified stratification factors other than site in the randomization (e.g. pre-enrollment factor) 
will be added as an additional fi xed effect in the mixed model. 
 
Assessment of Treatment-by-Baseline Interaction: 
 
Treatment-by-baseline interaction will be assessed  for the analyses of the primary efficacy 
endpoint. In the repeated measures model ([IP_ADDRESS]), the interaction will be tested by [CONTACT_398496]-by-baseline interaction. 
 
The test for interaction will be performed at the 0.10 level of significance. If the treatment- by-baseline interaction is not significant, the original model ([IP_ADDRESS]) will be used. Otherwise, the interaction will be assessed as qualitative or quantitative. Assessment of  the interaction type will be 
based on regression lines plotted for each treatment group. The intercepts and slopes for these 
regression plots will be obtained from the analysis model including the interaction term. The intercepts will be estimated by [CONTACT_398497]. The abscissa of the plots will 
range from the minimum baseline value from all subjects included in the analysis to the maximum baseline value. 
 
If the regression lines do not cross, or the crossing is judged not severe (i.e., the crossing occurs near the boundary or beyond the range of baseline values), then the interaction will be considered 
quantitative and this does not compromise the validity of the treatment comparisons. In this case, 
the treatment comparisons will be made using the model without the interaction term. 
 
Otherwise, the interaction will be considered qualitative and treatment comparisons will not be 
presented as a result of the complete model. In  this case, the impact of  the baseline value on 
treatment effect will be investigated by [CONTACT_398498]. 
 
Subgroup Analyses and Assessment of Treatment-by-Subgroup Interaction: 
 
Treatment effects will be assessed for subgroups based on age group, gender, race, region, and 
baseline HbA1c, as defined in Table 7.3.2A and Table 7.3.2B.   The analyses will be based on 
model [IP_ADDRESS] with additional covariates of subgroups, treatment-by-subgroup, time-by-subgroup, 
and treatment-by-time-by-subgroup.  Additionally, the treatment-by-stratification will be assessed.    
Tests of the treatment by [CONTACT_398499] 24. The model to assess the treatment-by-baseline HbA1c interaction will 
include baseline HbA1c as a continuous variable.  Adjusted mean change from baseline and its 
difference from the control group will be given for each subgroup at week 24. 
7.1.3 Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) 
 
In summaries of efficacy endpoints examining changes from baseline at Week [ADDRESS_502033] and the baseline measurement as a covariate. 
The following ANCOVA model will be used:  
Dt,ij = intercept + ß [Y0,ij ]+ Ĳi  + Ȧ m + error ij Where   (Model [IP_ADDRESS])
 
 
The model will provide least squares mean estima tes and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals for 
mean changes from baseline within and (when warranted) differences in mean change from 
baseline between treatments. Where applicable, t-statistics corresponding to the Type III sums 
of squares for the differences in the least squa res means will be used to obtain p-values for 
treatment group comparisons. 
7.1.[ADDRESS_502034] error (SE). In 
addition, 95% confidence interval for the mean (percent) change from baseline will be calculated for continuous efficacy variables. They will be presented by [CONTACT_398500]. 
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_502035] of frequencies and percentages for each treatment group and overall, where applicable. 
 
7.1.6 Descriptive Summaries of Change from Baseline in Categorical 
Variables 
Descriptive summaries of change from baseline in categorical variables will be provided 
using shift tables. Frequencies and percentages of subjects within each treatment group will be 
generated for levels of cross-classifications of baseline and the on-treatment value of the 
parameter. The on-treatment value can either be the value at a certain time point, or e.g. for 
laboratory tests, the minimum/maximum value in the direction of toxicity, which has been 
observed during the short-term treatment period. Treatment group differences will not be 
assessed in summaries of shifts. 
7.1.[ADDRESS_502036] 5 events in one 
treatment group. Additionally, a table will accompany the plot and will display the Kaplan-

 Meier estimates of the cumulative proportion (with 95% CI calculated based on Greenwood’s 
method3 when applicable) of subjects with event at specific time points by [CONTACT_1570]. 
If the estimated lower bound of 95% CI is below 0 or the estimated upper bound of 95% CI 
is over 1, then it will be restricted to 0 or 1 respectively. 
7.1.8 Proportion of Subjects Achieving Pre-defined Characteristic 
Unless otherwise specified, the proportion of subjects with a pre-defined characteristic  at Week t 
will be analyzed using logistic regression with adjustment for baseline HbA1c value and/or the 
stratification factor. Subjects in the randomized treatment group who do not demonstrate 
achieving therapeutic glycemic response at a specified timepoint or are rescued will count as 
treatment failures from that timepoint.  When proportion of responders (e.g., meeting HbA1c 
criteria; composite endpoints) is needed, the estimates, confidence intervals, and tests will be 
obtained using this methodology with adjustment for baseline variable (e.g., adjustment for 
baseline HbA1c) and stratification factor. For each treatment group, the probability of response 
is first modeled using a logistic regression model with baseline (e.g., baseline HbA1c) and 
stratification factor as the covariates.  Treatment group estimates of response rate are then 
obtained by [CONTACT_398501]'s modeled probability of response over the observed 
distribution of baseline covariate (combined across groups). For analysis of proportion of 
subjects achieving therapeutic glycemic response (HbA1c < 7%), the difference in response rate 
between the saxa-dapa arm and the insulin arm will be displayed along with standard error and 
95% confidence intervals using the methodology of Zhang, Tsiatis and Davidian and Tsiatis, 
Davidian, Zhang and Lu. Non-Inferiority will be demonstrated if the upper bound of the 95% 
confidence interval is less than 10%.  
When there are less than 5 responders in any treatment group, the unadjusted (and difference in) 
proportions, exact 95% confidence interval, and p-values from the Fisher’s exact test (when 
applicable) will be provided.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_502037]-prandial Glucose (Self-
monitored) 
All subjects will perform a 6 Point SMBG profile for any 3 days (to be included in the 
calculation of mean daily glucose, the measurements do not need to be recorded over [ADDRESS_502038] 3 complete days of measurements.). These are scheduled between Week (-2) to Week (-1), Week 11-12, Week 23-[ADDRESS_502039] prandial SMBGs will be required for summary of postprandial 
averages. The pre-prandial and
 postprandial measurements collected at the nominal time points 
will be considered for analysis.  
Glucose concentrations at each of the 6 time points will be averaged over the 3 days to derive the 
mean glucose concentrations at each of the 6 time points. The mean daily glucose (MDG) will then 
be calculated as the average over the average glucose concentrations at the [ADDRESS_502040], and pre-dinner, then the daily average will be calculated as (pre-
breakfast + post-breakfast)/2.  The average value for pre-dinner is excluded for the calculation 
since the average value for the post-dinner is missing.  The mean post-prandial glucose will be 
calculated as the average over the average glucose concentrations at the [ADDRESS_502041]-prandial time 
points. 
7.1.10 Mean Amplitude of Glucose Excursions (MAGE) of continuous 
glucose monitoring system readings 
Mean amplitude of glucose excursions (MAGE) is calculated using data from continuous glucose 
monitoring (CGM). MAGE for a 24-hour period equals “ the arithmetic mean of the blood glucose 
increases or decreases (from blood glucose nadirs to peaks or vice versa) when both ascending 
and descending segments exceeded the value of one standard deviation of the blood glucose for 
the same 24-hour period ”
. Therefore, it corresponds to the mean of absolute differences between 
consecutive maxima and minima, as long as these differences are greater than one standard 
deviation for the same 24-hour period. 
Here an example of calculation as described in the original publication of MAGE in 3.   
Figure 7.1.10-1: Blood glucose curve of a subject studied on intermediate-acting 
insulin regimen.  
 
Figure from Service, et al., [ADDRESS_502042] in Figure 7.1.3-1“ is as follows: the first 
excursion, 333 to 208 mg./100 mL ., is 125 mg./[ADDRESS_502043] 
deviation; 62. The first blood glucose increase, from 208 to 322 mg./100 mL, is 114 mg/100 ml 
[...] and also exceeds one standard deviation; however, the subsequent blood glucose decrease of 
35 mg./100 mL (from 322 to 287 mg./100 mL) is less than one standard deviation and so this 
excursion is not counted. The next blood glucose increase, from 208 to 432 (224 mg./100 mL), and 
decrease, from 432 to 137 mg./100 mL (295 mg./100 mL), both exceed the value of one standard 
deviation; therefore this glycemic excursion is [ADDRESS_502044] excursion is in a peak-to-nadir 
direction and the direction of calculation (peak-to-nadir or nadir-to-peak) is established, for that 
CBGA, by [CONTACT_60300]. ” Continuing, the next peak is 272 mg./100 mL which 
corresponds to an excursion of 135 mg./100 mL. The next excursion is 116 mg./100 mL to a nadir 
at 156 mg./100 mL, followed by [CONTACT_398502] 160 mg./100 mL to a peak at 316 mg./100 mL. 
The next nadir is at 173 mg./100 mL corresponding to an excursion of 143 mg./100 mL and it is 
followed by a peak at 322 mg./100 mL and a respective excursion of 149 mg./100 mL and by a 
nadir at 196 mg./100 mL and a respective excursion of 126 mg./100 mL. The next excursion is 
178 mg./100 mL to a peak at 374 mg./100 mL, followed by [CONTACT_127958] 332 mg./100 mL to a nadir at 
42 mg./100 mL and one of 186 mg./100 mL to the subsequent peak of 228 mg./[ADDRESS_502045] couple of excursions are 149 mg./100 mL to the next nadir at 79 mg./100 mL and 163 
mg./100 mL to the final peak point at 242 mg./[ADDRESS_502046] profile 
corresponds to the arithmetic mean of all excursions and equals approximately 177 mg./100 mL. 
Note although the above example refers to glucose expressed in mg/dL, calculation of MAGE with 
glucose readings expressed in standard international units (i.e. mmol/L) will follow the same 
principle. 
For calculating MAGE the following definitions apply: 
x Segment:  the ascending or descending part between a nadir and a peak.  
x Qualifying excursion:  A change from nadir to peak (or from peak to nadir) where both 
the excursion and the following segment in the opposite direction exceed [ADDRESS_502047].  
MAGE is calculated as the arithmetic mean of all qualifying excursions during the 24 hours.

Subjects who deviate from protocol conditions (e.g., important inclusion/exclusion criteria) will 
be reported as having significant protocol deviations. Significant protocol deviations that are 
determined to affect the primary efficacy results are deemed Relevant Protocol Deviations (RPDs).

The number of tablets that should have been taken is calculated as 1 + the number of days from 
the first short-term treatment period dose recorded in the “Record of Study Medication” to the 
last short-term treatment dose, times the prescribed daily dose (i.e. 2 tablets per day, one from 
each bottle). The number of tablets taken is the total number of tablets recorded (sum of bottle 1

7.[ADDRESS_502058] data set will not be included in the 
hierarchical testing.  
All the main analyses will be conducted using values prior to rescue/intensification of treatment 
or treatment discontinuation. Values collected after this time will be excluded from analyses. 
Sensitivity analysis using data regardless of rescue or treatment discontinuation will also be 
performed for the primary efficacy endpoint to assess the robustness of the primary efficacy 
results. 
The primary endpoint is the change in HbA1 from baseline at Week 24 visit. The primary endpoint 
will be tested for non-inferiority for saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin versus insulin at the alpha = 
0.025 level (one sided), within a non-inferiority margin of 0.30%.  If non-inferiority is 
demonstrated for the primary endpoint, the statistical tests for the secondary efficacy endpoints 
will be performed. The secondary endpoints then will be tested sequentially in the order that they 
appear below and in the objectives section of the protocol.  Each comparison will be tested at the 
alpha = 0.05 (two-sided) level.  Statistical tests between the dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin group 
and insulin group will be only performed for a given secondary endpoint if all previous sequential 
tests are statistically significant. Otherwise, the testing procedure will stop at the secondary 
endpoint that does not reach statistical significance.  These secondary endpoints are all testing 
superiority, with the exception of the fourth and fifth bullets below which are testing non-
inferiority.

superiority) 
x Proportion of subjects achieving a therapeutic glycemic response, defined as HbA1c < 
7.0%, without any reported hypoglycemia (for the duration of the Short-term Period) at 
Week 24   (testing superiority) 
x In a sub-study, change from baseline in the mean value of 24-hour glucose readings 
measured by [CONTACT_398490] (CGM) at Week 2 (testing non-inferiority, using a non-inferiority margin of 12 mg/dL) 
x Proportion of subjects achieving a therapeutic glycemic response, defined as HbA1c < 
7.0% at Week 24 (testing non-inferiority, using a non-inferiority margin of 10%) 
Analyses of secondary and exploratory endpoints specifically designed for sub-studies (CGM) will 
be performed using the subsets of the Randomized Subjects data set for the sub-studies. 
7.5.2 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary endpoint is the change in HbA1 from baseline at Week 24 visit.  The primary 
endpoint will be tested for non-inferiority for saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin versus insulin at the 
alpha = 0.025 level (one sided).  The primary analysis of the change in HbA1c from baseline at 
Week 24 visit will be based on a longitudinal repeated measures analysis using ‘direct 
likelihood’.  The model will use subjects in the primary efficacy data set (i.e., randomized 
subjects data set) who have a baseline assessment and at least one post-baseline open-label

 treatment period assessment.  The SAS procedure PROC MIXED will be used.  The preferred 
model will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment, week, randomization stratification 
factor (background medication of metformin alone vs. metformin + SU) and treatment-by-week 
interaction as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline measurement and baseline 
measurement-by-week interaction (see Model [IP_ADDRESS] in Section 7.1.2).  An unstructured matrix 
for the within-subject error variance-covariance will be used. The denominator degrees of 
freedom will be calculated according to the Kenward-Roger method.  A number of back-up 
models are defined in the Core statistical analysis plan (Section 7.1.2) in case of non-
convergence of the preferred model or other issues.  Data collected outside the analysis window 
(defined in Section 8 of this SAP) after subjects discontinued study medication will also be 
excluded from the primary analysis. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the mean 
change within each treatment group as well as the difference in mean change between the 
saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin versus insulin will be calculated.  If the upper limit of the 95% 
confidence interval of the difference is < 0.3%, then saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin as add-on 
therapy to metformin with or without SU will be considered non-inferior to insulin as add-on 
therapy to metformin with or without SU.  
Sensitivity Analyses  
The following sensitivity analyses will be carried out for the primary end point: 
x Primary analysis will be repeated using Evaluable Subjects data set. 
x Primary analysis will be repeated using all available values regardless of rescue or 
treatment discontinuation 
x An ANCOVA analysis using values prior to rescue or treatment discontinuation 
(LOCF will be used if the week 24 value is not available) 
x Analyses to address missing values (described below in section 7.5.3)

will not be imputed, except those inherited from the mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) 
which assumes that data are missing at random (MAR).   
MAR refers to missingness that is independent of missing responses, conditionally on observed 
responses and covariates.  As the imputation strategy should always consider the dropout patterns and the time-course of the efficacy measurements by [CONTACT_3148], the pre- and post- 
withdrawal values will be assessed to understand the impact of dropouts on the efficacy results.

 The primary efficacy endpoint of HbA1c data will be visually examined to explore the 
missingness patterns by (1) plotting each individual patient’s HbA1c change trajectory in 
completers, side-by-side with those from the early study drug withdrawal, and by (2) plotting the early study drug withdrawal’s last HbA1c change data, overlaid with the box plot by [CONTACT_398511]. Two additional methods of sensitivity analyses will be performed to compare the results from an MAR-based analysis versus an MNAR–based analysis under several 
MNAR scenarios. The first method is the return-to-baseline using Multiple Imputation in which 
patients with missing data known or believed to have discontinued protocol therapy were assumed to have a washout (“return to baseline”) of any potential treatment effect. More specifically for each imputation of the multiple imputation, for those subject with missing Week 
[ADDRESS_502060] values worse by [CONTACT_398512] “delta” compared to efficacy values of similar patients who continue with study treatment and do not require rescue. The detailed analysis plan 
and implementation of these methods are described in section [IP_ADDRESS], and [IP_ADDRESS]. 
The analysis for the treatment difference will be based on an ANCOVA model with change from 
baseline to week 24 as the dependent variable and covariate/factors of treatment group, randomization strata, and baseline HbA1c. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] MMRM Model for Change from Baseline Based on Return-to-Baseline 
Multiple Imputation 
The return-to-baseline MI (Multiple Imputation) imputes the change from baseline to Week 24, 
and samples will be drawn from a Normal distribution with mean 0 and variance of pooled data. Let X = (X
obs, Xmiss) be the complete data at Week 24. X is consisted of observed 
measurements X obs and the missing observations X miss.  In return-to-baseline imputation, when 
X is change from baseline (CHG), each missing observation X miss is imputed by a random draw 
from a Normal distribution with mean 0 and variance v imp: 
Xmis ~ N(0, v imp), 
The variance v imp is calculated from the observed changes: 
vimp = (1 + 1/N c) vc, 
where v c is the variance of the change among completers across all treatment arms, and N c is the 
number of completers. 
An ANCOVA model will be used to analyze the imputed datasets for change from baseline 
with treatment group and randomization strata as fixed factors and Baseline HbA1c as a covariate. The least square mean (LS mean) estimates will be combined using Rubin’s combination rules for statistical inference. All available measurements will be used including observations post-rescue and post-discontinuation of treatment.

 In this study, the primary analysis is comparing Saxagliptin + Dapagliflozin + Metformin group 
to control group Insulin Glargine + Metformin. The above approach will be conducted using the

[IP_ADDRESS] Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_398467], or premature 
treatment discontinuation on the primary efficacy analysis, a Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_398468] a missing 
at random (MAR) mechanism versus analysis assuming a missing not at random (MNAR) 
mechanism. The specific MNAR assumption that will be considered in this framework is that 
patients from the experimental treatment arm who discontinue study treatment prematurely or who initiate a rescue therapy would have, on average, their efficacy values post rescue/post 
treatment discontinuation worse by [CONTACT_398513]. Delta is considered a sensitivity parameter representing a degree of departure from the MAR assumption. The aim of the Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_398469] a “tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]” corresponding to a value of 
delta where the study conclusion of a non-inferior treatment effect would no longer hold. An 
interpretation of clinical plausibility of the assumption underlying the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_398470].    
The tippi[INVESTIGATOR_398471] a specified adjustment (referred to 
as delta adjustment or shift) applied to values imputed under an MAR-based imputation model for the appropriate subset of patients. In order to find a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300], a series of imputations will be performed with increasing values of delta.  
For the primary endpoint which is a continuous variable, we will use an additive delta adjustment 
(a shift) as follows:

BMS-477118 AND BMS-512148 saxagliptin-dapagliflozin 
 
 36 
 Step 1: Investigate missing data patterns in the source data (containing observed values prior to 
initiation of rescue therapy or premature study treatment discontinuation).  If missing data have 
both monotone and non-monotone patterns, use a multivariate regression imputation model and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to partially impute non-monotone data under the MAR assumption.  The variables used as explanatory variables for imputation include Randomization strata, HbA1c baseline, and post-baseline HbA1c at each time point. The 
imputations will be done separately within each treatment arm. If there are not enough 
observations to properly estimate covariance parameters, then stratification variables could be removed from the MCMC step, and/or the treatment arm can be included as an explanatory variable in the model. 
As a result, each imputed dataset will only have a monotone missing data pattern.  
Step 2: Impute remaining monotone missing data using an MAR-based regression imputation 
model for all patients who discontinued study treatment prematurely or initiated a rescue therapy. Apply a shift (an additive delta adjustment) to imputed values of patients in the experimental 
treatment arm (Saxagliptin + Dapagliflozin + Metformin). The variables used as explanatory 
variables for imputation include Treatment, Randomization strata, HbA1c baseline, and post-baseline HbA1c at each time point.  
Imputations with delta adjustment described above will be performed with varying values of 
delta in order to perform a series of analyses with progressively larger values of delta until a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_398473]. A tippi[INVESTIGATOR_398474] (non-inferiority) is no longer held (the upper bound of 95% confidence 
interval of the difference is greater than 0.3).   
Step 3: At each level of delta, analyze each of multiple imputed datasets using the same 
ANCOVA model as used for the primary analysis. Combine estimates obtained from multiple imputed datasets based on Rubin’s combination rules. 
Step 4: Using 95% upper CI, find the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300], ie, the value of delta parameter for which the 
primary non-inferiority hypothesis is no longer held. In this study, we will compare the non-
inferiority of Saxagliptin + Dapagliflozin + Metformin vs. Insulin Glargine + Metformin for each 
Delta value. We will find the delta value at which the test of non-inferiority hypothesis is no 
longer held . A clinical interpretation about the plausibility of the assumptions underlying the 
tippi[INVESTIGATOR_398470].  
 
7.5.4 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
If non-inferiority is demonstrated for the primary endpoint, the statistical tests for the secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be performed.  The secondary endpoints then will be tested sequentially in 
the order that they appear in the objectives section of the protocol.  Each comparison will be tested 
at the alpha = 0.05 (two-sided) level for superiority.  Statistical tests between the dapagliflozin

BMS-477118 AND BMS-512148 saxagliptin-dapagliflozin 
 
 37 
 plus saxagliptin group and insulin group will be only performed for a given secondary endpoint if 
all previous sequential tests are statistically significant.  Otherwise, the testing procedure will stop 
at the secondary endpoint that does not reach statistical significance.  
The continuous secondary endpoints (i.e., the change from baseline in total body weight, the 
change from baseline at Week 24 visit in the mean value of 24-hour glucose readings obtained 
from CGM) will be analyzed using a longitudinal repeated measures analysis, similarly to the one used for primary efficacy analysis.  The proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c < 7.0% will be analyzed using the methodology of Zhang, Tsiatis, and Davidian and Tsiatis, Davidian, Zhang, and Lu with adjustment for baseline HbA1c value and/or the stratification factor. The other binary endpoints (hypoglycemia endpoint and composite response endpoints of glycemic control with hypoglycemia) will be analyzed using logistic regression with adjustment for 
baseline HbA1c value and/or the stratification factor.   In addition to point estimates and 95% 
confidence intervals, p-values will be calculated for all secondary endpoints.  However, no claim will be based on endpoints for which the statistical testing is not performed for the endpoint as per the testing strategy as described above.  A clear distinction will be made between p-values whereby [CONTACT_146258].  All secondary efficacy analyses will use subjects in the primary efficacy data set (i.e., randomized subjects data set) who have a baseline assessment and any post-baseline open-label treatment period assessment.   
For the two secondary endpoints which are tested for non-inferiority, the analysis will be repeated 
using evaluable subjects data set to examine the robustness of the results.  The non-inferiority 
margins for the two secondary endpoints testing for non inferiority are specified in Table 7.5.4-1.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Glycemic Rescue or Discontinuation from Study treatment due to Lack 
of Efficacy 
The proportion of subjects requiring treatment intensification (glycemic rescue or discontinue 
study treatment for lack of efficacy) up to Week 24 / [ADDRESS_502061] ratio and 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  Kaplan-Meier plots
 of 
time to intensification at Weeks [ADDRESS_502062] 10 events in one 
treatment group.  Additionally, a table will accompany the plot and will display the Kaplan-Meier 
estimates of the cumulative proportion (with 95% CI calculated based on Greenwood’s method
  
when applicable) of subjects with event at specific time points by [CONTACT_1570]. If the estimated 
lower bound of 95% CI is below 0 or the estimated upper bound of 95% CI is over 1, then it will 
be restricted to 0 or 1 respectively.  For the analysis during 24 / 52 weeks, all subjects will be 
censored at Week 24 / 52 visit (end of ST treatment/end of LT treatment) if treatment 
intensification has not occurred by [CONTACT_221774].  Subjects rescued at Week 24 / 52 will be counted as 
having an event for the analysis. 
Composite response endpoints (glycemic control without hypoglycemia), will be analyzed using 
logistic regression with adjustment for baseline HbA1c value and/or the stratification factor. None 
of the exploratory endpoints will be statistically tested 
In addition, an analysis of the proportion of subjects not rescued and achieving glycemic response 
(defined as HbA1c < 7%) in subjects from the Short-term Completers Data Set at time points 
during the LT period will be performed using the same methodology described above (with 
adjustment for end of ST HbA1c measurement). Subjects discontinued or missed measurements 
(regardless of the type of missing) at the specific time point will be considered as not achieving 
glycemic response.

Treatment effects will be assessed for subgroups based on age group, gender, race, region, and 
baseline HbA1c, as defined in Table 7.3.2A and Table 7.3.2B. The analyses will be based on 
model [IP_ADDRESS] with additional covariates of subgroups, treatment-by-subgroup, visit-by-
subgroup, and treatment-by-visit-by-subgroup. Additionally the treatment-by-stratification 
interaction will be assessed. The nominal p-value for subgroup-by-treatment interaction will be 
presented. The p-value for the test of treatment by [CONTACT_654], female age, baseline HbA1c, and baseline

validated generic and diabetes-specific modules of treatment satisfaction, quality of life, barriers 
to medication adherence and weight perception.  Mean change from baseline in these parameters 
will be analyzed using longitudinal repeated measures model with terms for treatment group, 
baseline value, randomization stratification factor (back ground medication of metformin alone vs. 
metformin + SU), time, the interaction of treatment and time, and the interaction of baseline value 
and time. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the adjusted mean 
changes within each treatment group as well as for the differences in adjusted mean changes

The assessment of safety will be based on the analyses of AEs, vital signs, physical examinations, 
ECGs, hypoglycaemia, and clinical laboratory evaluations.  All safety analyses will be performed 
using treated subjects data set. 
The Treated Subjects Data Set will be used for all safety analyses, including data after rescue.  
Safety analyses will be performed using data from the 24-week open label period (at the time of 
the primary endpoint analysis) and then again at the final database lock (52 weeks) on the 
combined ST+LT treatment period.  Sensitivity analyses on data collected prior to rescue will be 
performed for selected Adverse Events (AEs) as described in Section 7.[ADDRESS_502063]+LT Core SAP.

applied. In addition, a subject listing of discontinuations due to AEs will be provided, displaying 
all events that led to discontinuation. 
7.6.[ADDRESS_502072] (AEOSI) 
Separate summaries will be provided for the following adverse events of special interest 
(AEOSI). Except as otherwise noted, to identify each type of adverse event of special interest in 
this section, a list of PTs will be selected before database lock and unblinding of the database.  
AEs and SAEs of special interest with an onset from Day [ADDRESS_502073] dose date in the short-term treatment 
period (or up to the start date of the long-term treatment period whichever comes first) will be 
considered as occurring during the short-term treatment period. 
Statistical Analysis Plan CV181-[ADDRESS_502074]+LT treatment periods. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypoglycemia 
Separate pages to capture events of hypoglycemia are contained within the CRF.  
 
Hypoglycemic events with an onset from Day [ADDRESS_502075] dose date in the short-term open-label treatment period (or up to 
and including the start date of the long-term treatment period, whichever comes first) will be 
considered as occurring during the Short-term open-label treatment period. Hypoglycemic 
events with an onset from Day [ADDRESS_502076] dose date in the long-term treatment period will be considered as occurring 
during the Short-term plus long-term treatment period.  
Hypoglycemic events will be categorized using two methods.  One classification is based on the 
ADA recommendations
 : 
 
Severe hypoglycemia: “An event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer 
carbohydrate, glucagons, or other resuscitative actions. These epi[INVESTIGATOR_134057]. Plasma glucose measurements may not be 
available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of plasma 
glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma 
glucose concentration.” Error! Bookmark not defined.   
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia:“An event during which typi[INVESTIGATOR_272211] a measured plasma glucose concentration  70mg/dl 
(3.9mmol/l).” Error! Bookmark not defined.  
Asymptomatic hypoglycemia: “An event not accompanied by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_78237] a measured plasma glucose concentration  70mg/dl (3.9mmol/l). Since 
the glycemic threshold for activation of glucagon and epi[INVESTIGATOR_398477] 65–70mg/dl (3.6–3.9mmol/l) (24–26) and since antecedent plasma glucose 
concentrations of  70mg/dl (3.9mmol/l) reduce sympathoadrenal responses to subsequent 
hypoglycemia (1,11,20), this criterion sets the lower limit for the variation in plasma glucose in 
nondiabetic, nonpregnant individuals as the conservative lower limit for individuals with 
diabetes.” Error! Bookmark not defined.  
Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia:  “An event during which symptoms of hypoglycemia are 
not accompanied by a plasma glucose determination (but that was presumably caused by a 
plasma glucose concentration  70mg/dl [3.9mmol/l]). Since many people with diabetes choose 
to treat symptoms with oral carbohydrate without a test of plasma glucose, it is important to 
recognize these events as “probable” hypoglycemia. Such self-reported epi[INVESTIGATOR_398478] a contemporaneous low plasma glucose determination may not be suitable 
outcome measures for clinical studies that are aimed at evaluating therapy, but they should be 
reported.” Error! Bookmark not defined.  
Statistical Analysis Plan CV181-369 
BMS-477118 AND BMS-512148 saxagliptin-dapagliflozin 
 
 44 
 Relative hypoglycemia: “An event during which the person with diabetes reports any of the 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_10921], and interprets those as indicative of hypoglycemia, but with 
a measured plasma glucose concentration > 70mg/dl (3.9mmol/l). This category reflects the fact 
that subjects with chronically poor glycemic control can experience symptoms of hypoglycemia 
at plasma glucose levels > 70mg/dl (3.9mmol/l) as plasma glucose concentrations decline toward 
that level (27,28). Though causing distress and interfering with the patient’s sense of well-being, 
and potentially limiting the achievement of optimal glycemic control, such epi[INVESTIGATOR_398479] a suitable outcome measure for clinical studies that 
are aimed at evaluating therapy, but they should be reported.” Error! Bookmark not defined.  
The second classification of hypoglycemic events follows: 
Major epi[INVESTIGATOR_17221] - defined as symptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_398480] (3rd 
party) assistance due to severe impairment in consciousness or behavior with a capi[INVESTIGATOR_118887] < 3 mmol/L (< 54 mg/dL) and prompt recovery after glucose or glucagon 
administration. 
Minor epi[INVESTIGATOR_17221] - defined as either a symptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_56170] a capi[INVESTIGATOR_398481] 3.5 mmol/L (63 mg/dL) regardless of need for third-party 
assistance or an asymptomatic capi[INVESTIGATOR_398482] 3.5 mmol/L (63 
mg/dL), that does not qualify as a major epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
Other epi[INVESTIGATOR_17221] - defined as epi[INVESTIGATOR_398483].  
All analyses of hypoglycemic events will be performed both overall and by [CONTACT_398518], with the ADA classification system and excluding 
rescue data analysis serving as the primary analysis. Data collected in the hypoglycemia CRF 
modules of the CRF will be included in the analysis. All blood glucose measurements collected 
in the hypoglycemia module of CRF will be considered for classifying the hypoglycemia events 
irrespective of the method using which glucose data were collected. 
The total number of events by [CONTACT_398519]-term open-label 
treatment period.  Hypoglycemic events with an onset during the short-term open-label treatment 
period and leading to discontinuation of study medication will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490]. When summarizing hypoglycemic events leading to discontinuation no upper cutoff day windows are applied. For short-term open-label period analyses the only upper cutoff date is the 
start date of the long-term treatment period. 
A summary of the incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia, defined as blood glucose value  
70mg/dL as recorded in the hypoglycemia module of CRF will be provided.   
A listing of subjects will be produced and it will display all hypoglycemic events with an onset 
date/time from the start date/time of short-term open-label treatment period up to the start date 
of the long-term treatment period 
[IP_ADDRESS] Confirmed Adjudicated Cardiovascular Adverse Events 
The number and percentage of subjects with confirmed cardiovascular events (ie., heart failure 
as determined by [CONTACT_247664]) will be summarized by [CONTACT_398520].

BMS-477118 AND BMS-512148 saxagliptin-dapagliflozin 
 
 45 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Confirmed Adjudicated Hepatic Adverse Events 
The number and percentage of subjects with confirmed hepatic events (as determined by [CONTACT_398521]) will be summarized by [CONTACT_153906].  In addition, 
a listing of all adjudicated hepatic adverse events by [CONTACT_398522]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Other AEOSIs 
Adverse events of special interest (AEOSI) will be defined based on lists of preferred 
terms.  These lists will be reviewed and finalized prior to database lock and unblinding of the database.   The following summaries and listings of AEOSI will include all data regardless of use of rescue medication:  
x AEs of genital infection 
x AEs of genital infection by [CONTACT_547] 
x AEs of Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) 
x AEs of UTI by [CONTACT_547] 
x AEs of renal impairment/failure 
x AEs of volume depletion 
x AEs of fracture 
x AEs of hepatic disorder 
x AEs of hypersensitivity reactions 
x AEs of severe cutaneous adverse reactions 
x AEs of gastroenteritis and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014] 
x AEs of decreased lymphocyte count 
x AEs of pancreatitis 
x AEs of all malignancies 
x AEs of cardiac failure 
x AEs of DKA 
 
The number and percentage of subjects with each of these events will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_398523]-term treatment period and in the combined 
ST+LT treatment 
periods.   
The number and percentage of subjects with events of urinary-tract infection will be summarized 
for the subgroups defined on the basis of categorized variables including incidence (1, 2, 3 or > 
3). A similar summary will be produced for events of genital infection.  
7.6.6 Laboratory Evaluation 
Unless otherwise specified, laboratory data obtained after the start of study medication dosing 
up to and including 4 days (30 days for liver func tion laboratory tests) afte r the last short-term 
dosing date (or up to and including the start of the long- term treatment period, whichever comes 
first) will be considered as obtained during the short-term treatment period.   Laboratory data 
obtained from the day after the last study medication + 4 days (30 days for liver function laboratory

 tests) up to the last visit da te of the follow-up period will be  considered as obtained during 
the follow-up period.  L aboratory data obtained after the start of ST treatment up to and including 
4 days (30 days for liver function laboratory tests) after the last dose of ST or LT medication will 
be considered as obtained during the combined ST+LT treatment periods.  
Listings for lab data will include  everything in the database. 
 
For liver safety, a summary of proportion of subjects with elevated liver test including elevated 
AT (ALT and/or AST) and total bilirubin (see Appendix 1 for definition) will be provided. In 
addition, a summary of proportion of subjects with elevated liver test and/or reported AE of 
hepatic disorder will also be provided. 
All laboratory evaluations performed by [CONTACT_398524].  
All lab tables for the CSRs will be produced in both US and SI units whenever available. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Marked Laboratory Abnormalities 
Laboratory abnormalities will be evaluated based on marked abnormality values (MA). The pre-
defined criteria for marked abnormalities are detailed in Appendix 3. If both the baseline and on-
treatment values of a parameter are beyond the same MA limit for the parameter, then the on-
treatment value will be considered a MA only if it is more extreme (farther from the limit) than 
was the baseline value. If the baseline value is beyond the low MA limit, and the post-baseline 
value is beyond the high MA limit (or vice-versa),  then the post-baseline value will be considered 
a MA. 
 
Laboratory abnormalities occurring during the short-term treatment period and the combined 
ST+LT treatment periods will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  In the short-term treatment 
period the summaries will be presented for both th e primary and sensitivity safety analyses. The 
direction of change (high or low) in MA will be indicated in the tables.  
 
For each subject with an MA for a parameter, all th e subject’s values of that parameter will be 
listed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Change from Baseline for Selected Laboratory Parameters Over Time 
All analyses of laboratory data will use observed data regardless of rescue. Visit windows are 
provided in Section 8.[ADDRESS_502077]+LT treatment periods for selected 
laboratory parameters will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_22136] n’s, means, 
medians, SEs, and 95% Cis 
 

Statistical Analysis Plan CV181-[ADDRESS_502078] short-term dosing date (or  up to and including the start of the long- term treatment period, 
whichever comes first) will be considered as obtained during the short-term treatment period. 
Vital  signs  data  obtained  after  the  start  of  study  medication  dosing  up  to  and including 
[ADDRESS_502079]+LT treatment period.   
Visit windows are provided in Section 8.3 in order to link each vital sign measurement to a 
scheduled visit. Values and changes from baseline for vital sign measurements will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_398525] (using available data 
regardless of rescue for subjects in Treated Subjects Data Set). 
7.6.8 Electrocardiograms 
The normality/abnormality of the ECG tracing, as determined by [CONTACT_093], will be 
summarized using frequency tables on number of subjects who have a normal/abnormal ECG 
tracing at Week [ADDRESS_502080]+LT treatment periods. 
8 CONVENTIONS 
Data collected outside the analysis window (defined in Section 8.4) after subjects discontinued 
open-label study medication will be excluded from analyses. 
8.1 Duration of Type 2 Diabetes 
Duration of Type 2 diabetes is calculated as th e number of years from Type 2 diabetes diagnosis 
date to informed consent date: 
 
(1 + consent date - diagnosis date) / 365.25. 
 
The duration of diabetes will be included in the baseline diabetes characteristics listing. 
 
If the date Type [ADDRESS_502081]: 
 
 
These durations, even if partially imputed, will be  listed. However, only the portion of the date 
of diagnosis actually observed, rather than imputed dates, will be displayed in listings. 
8.2 Missing and Multiple Measurements 
For listings of efficacy and safety measures, mis sing values will be repr esented as not reported. 
 
If the blood pressure measurements are taken at a wrong position, e.g., sitting instead of standing, 
then these measurements will be excluded from the summary/analysis. 
Some laboratory samples may be  inadvertently analyzed multiple times for the same test, 
producing multiple lab results on the same collection date and time for the same subject.  
In case of multiple observations within a single visit window, the following rules apply: 
x If there are two or more observations within the same visit window, the nonmissing 
observation closest to the target day will be used in the analysis

x FPG and spot urinary glucose to creatinine ratio will be summarized/analyzed only if 
measured on or prior to the first day after the last study drug treatment date. 
x HbA1c and body weight will be summarized/analyzed only if measured on or prior to the 
8th day after the last study drug treatment date.   
For safety parameters: 
x SAEs and the lab measurements for the liver function tests will be included in the 
summaries only if occurred/measured on or prior to the 30th day after the last study drug 
treatment date.  
x All other safety events (non-severe AEs, hypoglycemia, etc) and measurements (safety lab, 
vital signs, etc) will be included in the summaries only if occurred/measured on or prior to 
the 4th day after the last study drug treatment date.

- Calculate a surrogate date as the first non-missing valid date from the following list 
(in order of precedence): 
 First active study medication date 
 
 Consent date 
 
 Visit date corresponding to the visit at which the event was reported 
 
 If a valid non-missing date is not available for any of these dates, the surrogate 
date will be set to missing. 
- Based on the information provided, set the derived date to the earliest possible 
date. If only a year is provided, set the derived date to January first of that year. If a 
year and month is provided, set the derived date to the first day of that month. 
- If the surrogate date is non-missing then:

was updated as follows:  
   
The randomized subject data set will consist of 
all randomized subjects who receive at least 
one dose of study medication.  Whenever using 
the randomized subject data set, subjects will 
be presented in the treatment group to which 
they were randomized at the start of the Short-
term treatment Period (even if the treatment 
they received was different). This is also 
known as the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population. 
This wi ll be the primary efficacy data set. To be consistent with other saxagliptin plus

Definition of Confirmed hypoglycemia was 
updated  to consider all events with glucose 
values d 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) as recorded 
in the hypoglycemia module of the CRF 
irrespective of the method using which glucose data were collected.  To avoid error in summarizing data based on 
glucose values which were not collected using

APPENDIX 1 PHASE V INFORMATION FOR CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE 
MONITORING 
All CGM monitoring assessments were undertaken using the Phase V Health Outcomes 
Information System (PVOIS – CGM Module), Phase V Technologies, Inc. (Phase V), Wellesley 
Hills, MA.   This PVOIS-CGM Module, consisting of validated measurement, instrumentation, 
scoring, algorithms and statistical programs has been continuously updated and expanded since its 
inception in 2004. Within the PVOIS-CGM system the two general applications are referred to as: 
1) “PVOIS-CGM-Monitoring” which essentially includes the quality features that provide quality 
assurance and control over the CGM clinical trial tasks described above and 2) “PVOIS-CGM-
Analytics” which includes the statistical transformations and conversions of the raw CGM data 
into the set of 170 or more “data analytics” variables.    
A separate and distinct component which the PVOIS-CGM utilizes to gather physiological data 
directly from the patient, includes the devices, systems and software which govern the collection 
of the electronic source data in the study (PVOIS-CGM-Device).  The selection and approval of 
this separate component is typi[INVESTIGATOR_398486] V.  
The PVOIS is governed by a standardized set of Quality Operation Procedures (“QOP’s”), Work 
Instructions (“WI’s”) and Task Specifications (TS’s) which are part of the Phase V® ISO 
[ZIP_CODE]/9001 Quality Management System (“PVT QMS”).

 APPENDIX 2 PHASE V INFORMATION ON PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES 
MEASUREMENT  
All patient-reported outcomes (PRO) assessments were undertaken using the Phase V Health 
Outcomes Information System (PVOIS – PRO Module), Phase V Technologies, Inc., Wellesley 
Hills, MA.   This PVOIS, consisting of validated measurement, instrumentation, scoring, 
algorithms and statistical programs has been continuously updated and expanded since its 
inception in 1987.  It entails a modular approach which includes both core and disease-specific 
assessments for many chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, HIV, obesity, lipodystrophy, migraine headache, allergic rhinitis, and dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].  Each disease or condition 
is assessed by [INVESTIGATOR_41509] a Core assessment component and a Disease or Condition-Specific sub-
module.  In addition, there may be target population-specific sub-modules.  The system consists 
of several components including patient questionnaires, data entry and management systems, 
database structures, scoring algorithms and statistical routines.  The statistical database is 
maintained in SPSS for Windows Version 23 and all analytical output is generated using SPSS.  A 
SAS statistical database and verification program may be generated using Phase V
 conversion 
routines. 
The Module described below is referred to as the PVOIS – PRO – Diabetes Module.  
The quality-of-life (QOL) scales and subscales used in Protocol CV181369 include: 
Quality-of-Life Scaling  
x analogue perceived health (10-point rating  -- overall, physical, emotional, personal, and 
job/work); 
x functional health status (Duke activity index, diabetes-specific symptom interference index, 
general symptom interference index); 
x general health perceptions (vitality, general health, sleep); 
x mental and emotional health (psychological well-being and psychological distress); 
x cognitive function (acuity, disorientation and detachment, and performance); 
x symptom distress; 
x sexual dysfunction. 
x weight perception 
A brief description of the quality-of-life scales and corresponding number of items available in the 
Phase V Health Outcomes Evaluation System7 is given in Sections 2.1.1 – 2.1.3 below.  A double 
asterisk indicates those scales and subscales intentionally omitted from protocol CV181369.

QOL Scale Summary Descriptions of Scales used in Protocol CV181369: 
Health Care Utilization (Patient Reported):  Five questions concerning frequency of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], clinic or physician visits, nurse or other health care provider home visits, general 
assistance with chores and activities of daily living, telephone calls and consults to a physician, 
nurse or other health care provider.

reduction in the level of usual activities (non-paid, e.g. housework). 
Perceived Health (Global Analogue Scale):  5 questions: Feeling past month 1) overall or in 
general, 2) physically, 3) emotionally, 4) personal life and 5) about job or work? 
Functional Health Status:  12 functional levels of activities of daily living ranging from strenuous 
activity to basic activities such as dressing, bathing and eating.  (Derived from the Duke Activity 
Scale). 
Diabetes-Specific Symptom Interference:  7 questions concerning interference with 1) work, 2) 
social events, 3) recreational activities, 4) exercise and physical activities, 5) work effectiveness, 
6) enjoying life and 7) feeling your best due to symptoms of diabetes (such as low or high blood 
sugar, dizziness, vision problems or problems with circulation).

 General Symptom Interference: 7 questions concerning interference with 1) work, 2) social 
events, 3) recreational activities, 4) exercise and physical activities, 5) work effectiveness, 6) 
enjoying life and 7) feeling your best due to other more general symptoms or health problems such 
as fatigue, pain and depression. 
Symptoms and Side-Effects Distress:  53 questions including diabetes-specific and general 
symptoms (prevalence, frequency and distress severity). 
Mental and Emotional Health: 24 questions encompassing anxiety, depression, and loss of 
behavioral and emotional control (Psychological Distress) , life satisfaction, positive well being 
and emotional ties (Psychological Well Being) . 
General Health Perceptions: 11 questions on sleep disturbance, vitality and general health status.

Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction  
The treatment satisfaction measures used in protocol CV181369 include those constructs that focus 
on the patient's expectations and experiences with the process and perceived outcomes of the 
therapeutic regimen.  
The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction module8 was developed independently by [CONTACT_7609] V 
Technologies using a compendium of existing diabetes satisfaction items and incorporating new 
items developed from a series of focus group studies with persons with type 1 and type 2 diabetes 
experienced with newer oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin formulations, and pump and inhaled 
insulin technology.  Item pool selection, psychometric analysis, and field-testing was conducted 
by [CONTACT_7609] V Technologies. 
The following constructs were evaluated using the long-form diabetes treatment satisfaction 
module including: 
x Life Interference 
x Convenience

 x Burden 
x Acceptance of Negative Aspects (including side effects, stress, hassle) 
x Acceptance of Positive Aspects (including effectiveness, ease of use, comfort) 
x Overall Patient Preference (compared to other treatments). 
The full diabetes treatment satisfaction battery comprises four sections dealing with diabetes 
treatment involving A) any form, B) insulin (regardless of delivery), C) insulin injections and D) 
insulin inhalers.  Scales used in this protocol are described in Sections 2.2.1.

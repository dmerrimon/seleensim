PROTOCOL AMENDMENT I I (11-1-16) 64 
 65 
Protocol  Change # 1 66 
Original  Protocol  67 
If a very high success rate is achieved at every dose tested, then consideration may be given to 68 
amending the protocol with DSMC and IRB approval to evaluate doses of 0.016 mg, 0.008 mg, 69 
0.004 mg, 0.002 mg, and 0.001 mg.  70 
 71 
Protocol Change  72 
To evaluate  a dose of 0.016mg  and if success criteria are met, consecutively evaluate the 73 
following smaller doses as long as success criteria are met: 0.008mg, 0.004mg, 0.002mg, and 74 
0.001mg.  75 
   76 
Rationale for Change  77 
A successful 4 -week outcome was achieved for all four dose levels studies under the current 78 
protocol (11 of 11 eyes receiving 0.25 mg, 14 of 14 eyes receiving 0.125 mg, 21 of 24 eyes 79 
(88%) receiving 0.0625 mg, and 9 of 9 eyes receiving 0.[ZIP_CODE] mg).  The PE DIG DSMC has 80 
reviewed the safety and efficacy data and has approved continuation of  the study to evaluate up 81 
to five additional  lower doses of bevacizumab.  82 
 83 
Protocol  Change # 2  84 
Original  Protocol :  [ADDRESS_1137613] four dose levels of bevacizumab.  If as high 92 
as 14 infants are enrolled int o each of two series of infants for up to an additional five lower 93 
dose levels, then the maximum number of infants that will be enrolled is 201 (61 plus 140).   94 
 95 
Protocol  Change # 3 96 
 97 
Original  Protocol :  98 
If adverse events occur, they will be recorded and reported throughout the study.  99 
 100 
Protocol  Change  101 
All adverse events  between the time of study eye injection and the 4 -week ocular exam or 102 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (whichever is later) will be recorded.   After the 4 -week ocular exam or 103 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39173] (whichever is later), only serious adverse events ( see section 5.3), ocular 104 
adverse events, and any events judged by [CONTACT_820835]/or study [ADDRESS_1137614] all of these events, and those occurring after the 4 -week ocular exam or 110

treatment , and thus not useful for data analyses , particularly since there is no control arm .   112 
 113 
This amendment also provides for the following clarification to the success/failure 114 
definition:   115 
 116 
The success/failure definition as defined in section 3.4 was edited to provide a more realistic 117 
definition of improvement by 3 -5 days for infants with pre -treatment zone I, stage 3 without 118 
plus disease.  119 
 120 
Rationale for Change  121 
Previously, all study eyes with I, stage 3 without plus disease had to demonstrate a significant 122 
reduction in the severity and/or extent of neovascularization by 3 -5 days, or they were 123 
considered failures.  However, some eyes show improvement in the posterior pole from pre -plus 124 
to normal, and no worsening of neovascularization by 3 -5 days, with improvement of 125 
neovascularization noted by 1 -2 weeks.  These eyes will not be considered failure s.  126

ROP1Protocolv3.1_11 -28-16 clean 4 -17-18  1-9 CHAPTER 1:  BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY  278 
 279 
This study is being conducted by [CONTACT_149354] (PEDIG) and is 280 
funded through a cooperative agreement from the National Eye Institute.   281 
 282 
1.1 Background  283 
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a significant cause of childhood vision l oss in the United [ADDRESS_1137623] 291 
targeted blockade of pro -angiogenic growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor 292 
(VEGF), or their receptors.4-6 293 
 294 
Examination findings in ROP are classified according to the international classification of ROP 295 
(ICROP).7  Zone refers to location of disease, from zone I (most posterior) to zone III (most 296 
anterior). Stage refers to activity at the vascular/avascu lar border.  Stage [ADDRESS_1137624] photograph that has been used in many 300 
clinical trials.  The Early Treatment for ROP (ETROP) study established “type 1 ROP” as the 301 
degree of disease severity for which treatment with laser is indicated.  Type 1 ROP is def ined as 302 
any stage ROP in zone I with plus disease, stage 2 or 3 ROP in zone II with plus disease, or 303 
stage 3 ROP in zone I without plus disease.8 304 
 305 
Bevacizumab (trade name [CONTACT_112893]®; Genentech , Inc., South San Francisco, CA) is a human ized [ADDRESS_1137625] as an off -label 309 
treatment for severe (type 1) ROP , given by [CONTACT_820836] a small fraction of the 310 
systemic dose for cancer .  The BEAT -ROP trial (Bevacizumab Eliminates the Angiogenic 311 
Threat of R etinopathy of Prematurity), was a randomized trial of bevacizumab monotherapy 312 
versus conventional laser therapy for zone I and posterior zone II, stage 3+ ROP.5  Results of 313 
the BEAT -ROP trial suggested a benefit of bevacizumab treatment over conventional laser 314 
therapy for zone I ROP but not for zone II ROP.  In addition, high myopia was much less 315 
common after bevacizumab compared with laser.   However, t he BEAT -ROP s tudy had 316 
important limitations.  The primary outcome was “recurrence of ROP requiring retreatment,” 317 
and the decisions about retreatment were made by [CONTACT_820837].   The study lacked a 318 
functional  outcome measure such as visual acuity.   The recurrence o f ROP requiring retreatment 319 
was relatively high ( 22%). Therefore, additional studies are needed to determine the relative 320 
effectiveness of Avastin and laser . 321 
 322 
Little is known about the safety of using bevacizumab for ROP,9 as the BEAT -ROP study 323 
provided little short -term and no long -term safety data.  In the BEAT -ROP study, 5 infants 324 
undergoing bevacizumab injection and 2 infants undergoing laser treatment died before the age 325 
of 54 weeks, but the study was not powered to evaluate whether the death rate was any higher 326 
 
ROP1Protocolv3.1_11 -28-16 clean 4 -17-18  1-10 following bevacizumab injection .5  At 2 ½ years of age the death rate was similar betwe en 327 
groups, with a total of 6 infants treated with bevacizumab and 7 infants in the laser treated 328 
group dying prior to age 2 ½ years.10  Angiogenesis is an important process in the normal 329 
development of other organ systems such as the lungs, kidneys, brain , and bones . Intravitreal 330 
bevacizumab reaches the systemic circulation, so there is significant  potential  for negative 331 
systemic side effects.  The dose of bevacizumab used in the BEAT -ROP study (0.625 mg in 25 332 
µl) was chosen empi[INVESTIGATOR_820830] -half the adult dose used for macular degeneration .[ADDRESS_1137626] effective dose of 338 
bevacizumab for the treatment of severe ROP is unknown.  A phase 1 study is needed to find a 339 
lower  dose of intravitreal bevacizumab injection for the treatment of severe ROP that can be 340 
evaluated in future larger studies.   341 
 342 
1.2 Anti -VEGF Treatments for Other Retinal Disor ders 343 
Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents ha s become increasingly common for treatment of 344 
retinal disorders in adult patients.  Macugen (pegaptanib sodium , manufactured by [CONTACT_4618]) was [ADDRESS_1137627] of the anti -VEGF agents for ocular use, approved by [CONTACT_34033] 2004 for treatment of 346 
choroidal neovascularization secondary to wet age -related macular degeneration.  Macugen is a 347 
pegylated aptamer that works by [CONTACT_63357] 165 and preventing its binding to VEGF target 348 
receptors.  In 2006, Lucentis (ranibizum ab, manufactured by [CONTACT_8229]) was approved by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_1137628] and 353 
only FDA approved anti-VEGF agent for treatment of diabetic macular edema. Eylea 354 
(afibercept, manufactured by [CONTACT_112608]) was first approved by [CONTACT_34033] 2011 for treatment 355 
of wet AMD and then later in 2012 as a treatment for macular edema following retinal vein 356 
occlusion. Eylea is a recombinant fusion protein containing the extracellular domains o f human 357 
VEGF receptors 1 and 2 fused to a portion of human IgG1, which competes with native VEGF 358 
receptors for binding of free VEGF.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_820831] -VEGF agents for treatment of 359 
retinal disorders in adults, no approval exists for their use in p ediatric populations.  360 
 361 
1.3 Safety  362 
In a meta -analysis performed by [CONTACT_8229], Inc . on all clinical trial results using intravenously  363 
administered bevacizumab (usually dose d as 5 mg/kg every 14 days)  in adults , it was found that [ADDRESS_1137629] not been 373 
established,12 although there is potential for similar adverse events in infants as in adults.   374 
 375 
 
ROP1Protocolv3.1_11 -28-16 clean 4 -17-18  1-11 Doses administered to infants for treatment of ROP (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 0. 3 mg to 0. 625 mg) are lower [ADDRESS_1137630] reported similar effects with  an even lower dose (0.375mg) of bevacizumab.[ADDRESS_1137631] already begun to form.17  Regression of ROP 391 
following bevacizumab treatment may in some cases be transient, with recurrence of ROP 392 
occurring later than what is observed with laser treatment .18  Other complications observed 393 
following bevacizumab treatment for ROP include retinal hemorrhage,19, 20 transient vascular 394 
sheathing,20 choroidal ischemia,21 abnormalities of the retinal periphery (large avascular areas, 395 
abnormal branchin g, shunts) and of the posterior pole (hyperfluorescent areas, absenc e of the 396 
foveal avascular zone) .  It is possible but unknown if these changes will have an effect on [ADDRESS_1137632] -menstrual age outcome examination  (5 after intravitreal bevacizumab, 2 402 
after laser).[ADDRESS_1137633] a difference (a sample of 2800 infants would be required to assess a 405

ROP1Protocolv3.1_11 -28-16 clean 4 -17-18  1-12 1.5 Study Objective  425 
To find a dose of intravitreal bevacizumab that is lower than currently used for severe ROP, is 426 
effective in this study, and can be tested in future larger studies.  427 
 428 
1.6 Synopsis of Study Design  429 
Major eligibility criteria : (See section 2.2  for a complete listing)   430 
1. Type 1 ROP ( as defined in section 2.4 ) in one or both eyes  431 
2. No previous treatment  for ROP  (except previous treatment of the fellow eye with laser is 432 
allowed)  433 
 434 
Treatment Paradigm : [ADDRESS_1137635] 80% of eyes meeting 440 
the study’s definition of success (as defined in section 3.4).    441 
 442 
Approach to Study Design:  [ADDRESS_1137636] will be obtainable  at the 4 -week outcome 444 
examination for various  reasons, including  instability of the infant's medical condition, non - [ADDRESS_1137637] effective dose level 454 
of bevacizumab  (one level higher than the level currently being studied) .  455 
a. Recruitment of subjects at each dose will continue until any one of the following 456 
occurs:  [ADDRESS_1137638] - 461 
injection  462 
b. After recruitment for a dosa ge ends based on the above criteria, the Data Safety and 463 
Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) will review outcomes from the first 10 infants 464 
injected as well as preliminary outcomes from any additional (1 -4) infants injected, [ADDRESS_1137639] 466 
another 10 -14 subjects , repeat the same dosage for another 10 -14 subjects, wait for 467 
outcomes of 1-4 additional infants injected, or stop the study . The DSMC will apply 468 
the following guidelines, but may make a different d ecision based on the specific 469 
study data:  470 
a. If the success rate is 80% or greater, then the study will continue to the next 471 
lower dose . Up to 4 different doses  will be evaluated.  472 
 
ROP1Protocolv3.1_11 -28-16 clean 4 -17-18  1-13 b. If the success rate is greater than 70% but less than 80%, then  10-14 473 
additiona l infants will be treated at the same dose . 474 
c. If the success rate is less than 70%, then another [ADDRESS_1137640] dose 476 
(0.25 mg ) is unsuccessful , or the previous successful dose was  already tested 477 
on 2 sets of 10 -14 infants . 478 
2. The maximum  number of study participants  is 201.  479 
 480 
Exam  Schedule  481 
Data will be collected on the day of injection (day 0).   482 
 483 
The exam schedule  is as follows:  484 
• [ADDRESS_1137641] -injection  485 
• If type 1 is still present  at day 1, then an exam will occur at 4 days (3 to 5  days) post- 486 
injection   487 
• 1 week (6 to 8 days) post -injection  488 
• 2 weeks ( 11 to 17 days) post -injection  489 
• 3 weeks ( 18 to 24 days) post -injection  490 
• 4 weeks ( 25 to 31 days) post -injection  491 
 492 
• After 4 weeks, follow -up and treatment will be at investigator discretion, except for the 493 
following:  [ADDRESS_1137642] -injection an infant develop s stage 4 or 5 ROP, or 495 
require s additional bevacizumab injection, laser treatment, or retina l surgery 496 
(vitrectomy or scleral buckle) , medical records will be reviewed to collect data [ADDRESS_1137643] -injection  exam .       498

2.4 Enrollment Examination  579 
Classification of ROP  on day of examination when type 1 ROP is diagnosed : 580 
ROP will be classified by [CONTACT_820839] 581 
Retinopathy of Prematurity (ICROP) criteria.7, 26   582 
 583 
Location, extent, and stage of disease, as well as presence of pre -plus, plus disease , or 584 
aggressive posterior ROP , will be recorded as follows:  585 
 586 
Location : Location will be recorded as  follows : 587 
• Zone I: circle centered on the optic nerve with a radius of twice the distance from the 588 
center of the optic nerve to the center of the macula  589 
• Zone II: extends centrifugally from the edge of Zone I to the nas al ora serrata and is 590 
concentric to zone I  591 
 592 
Stage : Disease stage will be recorded as stages 1 -5 as defined:  593 
• Stage 1 : Demarcation line  594 
• Stage 2 : Ridge  595 
• Stage 3 : Extraretinal fibrovascular proliferation  596 
• Stage 4 : Partial retinal detachment. Stage 4 will be furth er classified based on location of 597 
the partial retinal detachment:  598 
o Stage 4A : Extrafoveal  599 
o Stage 4B : Foveal  600 
• Stage 5 : Total retinal detachment  601 
 602 
Extent of Disease (c lock hours):  Extent of the highest stage will be recorded in 30◦ increments, 603 
or clock hours.  604 
 605 
Plus Disease : A diagnosis of plus disease will be made if at least [ADDRESS_1137655] photograph of 607 
plus disease.26, 27  608 
 609 
Pre-plus Disease : A diagnosis of pre -plus disease will be made when there is abnormal dilation 610 
and tortuosity, but it is insufficient to diagnose plus disease.  611 
 612 
Type 1 ROP  is the degree of disease severity for which treatment is indicated. It is defined as : 613 
• Zone I, any st age ROP with plus disease , or 614 
• Zone I, stage 3 ROP without plus disease , or 615 
• Zone II, stage 2 or 3 ROP with plus disease  616

ROP1Protocolv3.1_11 -28-16 clean 4 -17-18  3-1 CHAPTER 3:  TREATMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 623 
 624 
Bevacizumab (Avastin) is made by [CONTACT_8229], Inc. and is approved for metastatic colorectal 625 
cancer, nonsquamous , non -small cell lung cancer, recurrent glioblastoma, and metastatic renal cell 626 
carcinoma . The study is being conducted under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) as 627 
intravitreal injection of bevacizumab for ROP in children is an off -label use.  628 
 629 
All participants will receive a  single intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (see section 3.1 for dose ) [ADDRESS_1137656] effective dose 634 
level of bevacizumab (one level higher than the level currently being studied).   If there is type [ADDRESS_1137657] effective dose level of bevacizumab (one 637 
level higher than the level currently be ing studied) . If the study eye meets failure criteria, then either 638 
eye can be treated at investigator discretion.  Unless the study eye meets  failure criteria, the fellow 639 
eye should not be given more than one injection of bevacizumab within 4 weeks of injection of the 640 
study eye (because of crossover effects).  If there is a strong rationale for treating the fellow eye 641 
with more than one injecti on of bevacizumab, the Protocol Chair or his/her designee should be 642 
called to discuss it before treatment is given.  The fellow eye can be treated or re -treated with laser 643 
at investigator discretion.  644 
 645 
3.1 Bevacizumab Dos e and Injection  646 
Study eyes will receive  a single dose of bevacizumab provided by  [CONTACT_820840]’s 647 
institution .  A coordinator at each site will be unmasked to dosage as he/she  will be required to 648 
process the prescription /s to the pharmacy per their usual institutional ordering  mechanism.   The 649 
pharmacy will prepare the bevacizumab in a sterile manner, adhering to USP 797 standards .  Syringes 650 
containing bevacizumab at the appropriate study concentration will be prepared.  If one eye is injected, 651 
then two syringes will be prepared .  If two eyes are injected, then four syringes will be prepared.  One 652 
syringe will serve as a backup and will only be used if the other syringe is compromised for any reason; 653 
otherwise , the backup syringe will be discarded if unused.  The investigator and  all other personnel at 654 
the site will be masked to the dosage level.    655 
 656 
The dosages of injected bevacizumab to be studied are listed in Table 1 .  The decision of whether to 657 
increase, repeat, or decease the dose of bevacizumab will be determined as follows:  [ADDRESS_1137658] effective dose level of bevacizumab (one level higher than 663 
the level currently being studied) . If the study eye is treated with 0.25 mg, and bevacizumab is 664 
used for the non -study eye, then the dose for the non -study eye will be 0.625 mg.  665 
a. Recruitment of subjects at each dose will continue until any one of the following occurs:  [ADDRESS_1137659] 10 infants injected as well as prelimi nary outcomes from any 672 
 
ROP1Protocolv3.1_11 -28-16 clean 4 -17-18  3-2 additional (1 -4) infants injected, and the committee will make a recommendation to [ADDRESS_1137660] another 10 -14 subjects, repeat the same dosage for another 674 
10-14 subjects, wait for 4-week outcomes of 1 -4 additional infan ts injected, or stop the 675 
study. The DSMC will apply the following guidelines, but may make a different decision 676 
based on the specific study data:  677 
a. If the success rate is 80% or greater, then the study will continue to the next 678 
lower dose. Up to 4 different doses  will be evaluated.  679 
b. If the success rate is greater than 70% but less than 80%, then an additional 10 - 680 
14 infants will be evaluated at the same dose.  681 
c. If the success rate is less than 70%, then another [ADDRESS_1137661] dose (0.25 mg) is 683 
unsuccessful , or the previous successful dose was already tested on 2 sets of 10 - 684 
14 infants.  685 
2. The maximum number of study participants is 201.   686

 740 
• All adverse events  between the time of study eye injection and the 4 -week ocular exam or 741 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (which ever is later) will be recorded.   After the 4 -week ocular exam or 742 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (whichever is later), only serious adverse events ( see section 5.3), ocular 743 
adverse events, and any events judged by [CONTACT_820835]/or 744 
treatment will be recorded.  745 
 746 
• If any study -mandated examination is deferred because of an infant’s unstable medical status, 747 
then that examination will be don e as soon as possible.  748 
 749 
• Additional (non -study) examinations may be done at investigator discretion.  750 
 751 
3.3 Follow -up Exam Procedures  752 
Classification of ROP will be determined at each follow -up exam as described in section 2.4 .  Data 753 
will be collected for both the  study and non -study eye.  754 
 755 
Additional data collected at 6 and 12 months will include the following:  756

o Periventricular leukomalacia  772 
o Hydrocephalus (with shunt placement)  773 
• Assessment of visi on, amblyopia, strabismus, retinal structure, and refractive error    774 
 775 
Some  data collected at 6 and 12 months will be collected retrospectively from chart review .   776 
 777 
3.4 Definition  of Success / Failure  778 
Assessment of success/failure will be standardized by [CONTACT_820841] [ADDRESS_1137669] to the  revised International Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ICROP) 780 
criteria7, upon which exa m findings and failure criteria will be based.  781 
 782 
Success is defined as improvement* by [CONTACT_941] 4 -day exam (3 to 5 days) , and no recurrence of type 1 783 
ROP or severe neovascularization requiring additional treatment within 4 weeks of injection.   If 784 
either or both of these criteria are not met, then a second examination will be done by a study - 785 
certified examiner.  If the second examiner confirms that any success  criteria are not met, then 786 
treatment for this eye will be considered a failure, and the investigator may give any additional 787 
treatment he/she deems necessary.  Failure can be declared as early as the 4-day post -injection 788 
examination  (3 to 5 days) , and treatment can then be started at investigator discretion.   789 
 790 
If the second examiner does not confirm failure , then they will examine together and reach 791 
consensus.  792 
 793 
* For infants with pre-treatment plus disease, improvement by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_1137670] -injection exam is defined as:  (1) pre-plus no longer 796 
present (neither plus nor pre -plus disease), or (2) a reduction in severity and/or extent of extraretinal [ADDRESS_1137671] -injection exam is defined as a reduction in severity and/or [ADDRESS_1137672] -injection exam .  Success cannot be declared until 809 
the 4 -week exam.  810 
 811 
3.7 Addit ional Treatment  812 
Treatment for the study eye or the fellow eye is at investigator discretion  after the 4 -week outcome 813 
examination, or sooner if the study eye meets criteria for failure and it is confirmed by a second 814 
examiner . Investigators should not treat  the study eye with laser or additional injections prior to the 815 
4-week outcome examination, unless failure criteria are met  and confirmed . If there is a strong 816 
rationale for earlier treatment  in the study eye  in the absence of meeting failure criteria , the Protocol 817 
Chair or his/her designee should be called to discuss it before treatment is given.   [ADDRESS_1137673] effective dose level of 820 
bevacizumab (one level higher than the level currently being studi ed).  Unless the study eye meets 821 
failure criteria, the fellow eye should not be given more than one injection of bevacizumab within 4 822 
weeks of injection of the study eye (because of crossover effects).   If there is a strong rationale for 823 
treating the fellow eye with more than one injection of bevacizumab, the Protocol Chair or his/her [ADDRESS_1137674] -injection.  (The Avastin level before  injection will serve as a control.)  833

4.1 Patient Withdrawals  836 
Parents may withdraw their infant  from the study at any time . 837 
4.2 Discontinuation of Study  838 
The study may be discontinued by [CONTACT_820842] 839 
Committee (with approval of the National Eye Institute ) prior to the completion of enrollment and 840 
follow -up for all participants . 841 
 842 
4.3 Participant Payments  843 
The parent /guardian  of each participant  will be given a $[ADDRESS_1137675] care of severe ROP .  All visits 853 
(including study exams and additional exams at the discretion of the investigator) and/or other 854 
required treatments  that are part of routine care will be the participant ’s or his/her insurance 855 
company’ s responsibility .  Treatment required for complication s of the injection itself will also be 856 
the participant ’s or his/her insurance company’s responsibility . 857 
 858 
4.5 Contacts by [CONTACT_464716]  859 
The Jaeb Center serves as the PEDIG Coordinating Center.  The Jaeb Center will be provided with 860 
the parent’s contact [CONTACT_3031].  The Jaeb Center will contact [CONTACT_820843] 861 
when necessary.  Permission for such contacts will be included in the Informed Consent Form.  The 862 
principal purpose of the contacts will be to help coordinate scheduling of the 12-month  863 
examination.   864 
  865 
4.6 General Considerations  866 
The study is being conducted in compliance with the policies described in the study policies 867 
document, with the ethical principles that ha ve their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, with the 868 
protocol described herein, and with the standards of Good Clinical Practice.  869 
 870 
There is no restriction on the number of subjects to be enrolled by [CONTACT_820844] 871 
recruitment goal.  A ri sk-based monitoring approach will be followed, consistent with the FDA 872 
“Guidance for Industry Oversight of Clinical Investigations — A Risk -Based Approach to 873 
Monitoring” (August 2013).  874 
 875 
It is the investigators’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_225786]’s level of risk fal ls under DHHS 46.[ADDRESS_1137676]'s disorder or condition.  878 
 
ROP1Protocolv3.1_11 -28-16 clean 4 -17-18  5-1 CHAPTER 5:  ADVERSE EVENTS AND RISKS  [ADDRESS_1137677] concern will be the safety of the study participant, and 887 
appropriate medical intervention will be made.  888 
 889 
All adverse events  between the time of stud y eye injection and the 4 -week ocular exam or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 890 
discharge  (whichever is later) , whether discovered by [CONTACT_820845] [ADDRESS_1137678] been caused by [CONTACT_941] 896 
treatment.  897 
 898 
After the 4 -week ocular exam or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (whichever is later), only serious adverse events 899 
(see section 5.3) , ocular adverse events, and any  adverse event judged by [CONTACT_2418] 900 
related to injection and/or treatment will be recorded.  901 
 902 
To ensure consistency of adverse event causality assessments, investigators should apply the 903 
following general guideline when determining whether an a dverse event is related:  [ADDRESS_1137679]’s clinical 908 
state, intercurrent illnes s, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the adverse event follows a known 909 
pattern of response to the study treatment . 910 
 911 
No 912 
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study treatment (e.g., 913 
preexisting medical condition, underlying dis ease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); 914 
and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal relationship to study treatment administration.    915 
 916 
The maximum intensity that occurred since the onse t of an adverse event will be rated on a three - 917 
point scale: (1) mild, (2) moderate, or (3) severe , categorized as follows:  918 
 919 
Mild  - Symptom(s) barely noticeable to subject or does not make subject uncomfortable; does 920 
not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily needed for relief of 921 
symptom(s).  922 
 923 
Moderate  - Symptom(s) of sufficient severity to make subjec t uncomfortable; performance of 924 
daily activity is influenced; subject is able to continue in study; treatment for symptom(s) may 925 
be needed.  926 
 927 
 
ROP1Protocolv3.1_11 -28-16 clean 4 -17-18  5-2 Severe  - Symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; severity may cause cessation of treatment with 928 
study medication or dev ice; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]  929 
 930 
It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: thus, a severe adverse event is not 931 
necessarily serious. For example, itching for several days may be rated as severe, but may not be 932 
clinically serious.  933 
 934 
Adverse events that continue after the study participant’s discontinuation or completion of the study [ADDRESS_1137680] occurrence that:  940 
• Results in death . 941 
• Is life -threatening; (a non -life-threatening event which, had it been more severe, might have 942 
become life -threatening, is not  necessarily considered a serious adverse event) . 943 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . 944 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to [ADDRESS_1137681] normal lif e fun ctions (sight -threatening).  946 
• Is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_13656] (e.g., 947 
may jeopardize the participant or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of 948 
the outcomes listed above) . 949 
 950 
Unexpected  adverse events are those that are not identified in the current Clinical Investigator’s [ADDRESS_1137682] negative long -term implications.  The systemic risks of bevacizumab 978 
when used intravenously include wound healing complications, bowel perforation, hemorrhage, 979 
stroke, myocardial infarction, h ypertension, congestive heart failure, proteinuria , gastrointestinal 980 
perforations, non -gastrointestinal fistula formation, arterial thromboembolic events, reversible 981 
posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, infusion reactions, and ovarian failure. After int ravitreal 982 
injection, bevacizumab is present in the blood in low concentrations, and it is unknown if these 983 
amounts are sufficient to cause any of the systemic complications listed above.  The ocular risks of 984 
intravitreal injection include  worsened retinal traction, recurrent ROP, retinal hemorrhage, transient 985 
vascular sheathing , abnormalities of the retinal periphery (large avascular areas, abnormal 986 
branching, shunts) and of the posterior pole (hyperfluorescent areas, absenc e of the foveal avascular 987 
zone) .  It is possible but unknown if these changes will have an effect on vision .12, [ADDRESS_1137683] high myopia (nearsightedness) and astigmatism, and it is [ADDRESS_1137684] more myopia and/or astigmatism than the other (anisometropia).  This 991 
can lead to the brain favoring one eye over the other (amblyopia), which is usually treated with 992 
patching of the preferred eye to force the brain to use the non -preferred eye.  Preliminary studies 993 
indicate that use of bevacizumab  for ROP seems to result in less myopia (nearsightedness) than 994 
laser treatment, especially for  zone I eyes.  If one eye is treated with laser and the other eye with 995 
bevacizumab, it may increase the chances of anisometropia and amblyopia.  996

5.5.2 Potential Adverse Effects of Intravitreal Injection  998 
Rarely, the topi[INVESTIGATOR_820833] e the injections (proparacaine, tetracaine, 999 
or xylocaine) can cause an allergic reaction, seizures, and an irregular heartbeat.  Generally, infants [ADDRESS_1137685] already been exposed to topi[INVESTIGATOR_820834].  1001  
 1002  
Temporary stinging, bu rning and conjunctival redness may occur with the use of proparacaine. A 1003  
rare, severe, immediate -type, apparently hyperallergic corneal reaction characterized by [CONTACT_9420], 1004  
intense and diffuse epi[INVESTIGATOR_242068], a gray, ground glass appearance, sloughing of  large areas of 1005  
necrotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], corneal filaments and iritis with descemetitis has also been reported.  1006  
 1007  
Subconjunctival hemorrhage will commonly occur as a result of the intravitreal injection.  Mild 1008  
discomfort, ocular hyperemia, increased lacrimation , discharge or itching lasting for a few days is 1009  
also likely.  1010  
 1011  
Immediately following the injection, there may be elevation of intraocular pressure. It usually 1012  
returns to normal spontaneously, but may need to be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_377424] a paracentesis to 1013  
lower the pressure.  The likelihood of permanent loss of vision from elevated intraocular pressure is 1014  
much less than 1%.  1015  
 1016  
A rare complication of injection is endophthalmitis.  It can be due to infection with pathogens such 1017  
as bacteria of fungi or can be  noninfectious. Clinical features include eyelid edema, conjunctival 1018  
injection, corneal edema, anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation and hypopyon.   1019  
Endophthalmitis  is treated by [CONTACT_820846], and there is a risk of permanent 1020  
 
ROP1Protocolv3.1_11 -28-16 clean 4 -17-18  5-4 loss of vision , including blindness.  A meta -analysis of 24 studies in adults reporting 1021  
endophthalmitis after intravitreal  injection of an anti-VEGF agent estimated the risk of 1022  
endophthalmitis per injection  to be 0.049% (95% CI, 0.038% to 0.065%).  28 1023  
 1024  
Retinal detachment is a rare complication of intravitreal injection.   If this occurs, surgery may be 1025  
needed, which is usually successful at reattaching the retina.  However, a retinal detachment can 1026  
produce permanent loss of vision and even blindness.  The risk of retinal detachment has been 1027  
reported to be less than 0.1%  in adults .29 1028  
 1029  
The risk of vitreous hemorrhage after intravitreal injection has been re ported to be less than 1%  in 1030  
adults .29  When it occurs, it usually resolves spontaneously, but vitrectomy is sometimes needed, 1031  
and vision loss may result in some cases.    Retinal detachment and vitreous hemorrhage can also 1032  
occur from severe ROP.  1033

6.2 Classification of Success /Failure and Decision to Increase, Repeat, or Decrease Dosage  [ADDRESS_1137687] 10 infants injected as well as preliminary outcomes 1053  
from any additional (1 -4) infants injected, and the committee will make a recommendation to [ADDRESS_1137688] another 10 -14 subjects, repeat the same dosage for another 10 -14 1055  
subjects, wait for outcomes of 1 -4 additional infants injected, or stop the study . The DSMC will 1056  
apply the following guidelines, but may make a different decision based on the specific study data:  1057  
• If the success rate is 80% or greater, then the study will continue to the next lower dose.  1058  
• If the success rate is greater than 70% but les s than 80%, then an additional 10 -14 infants 1059  
will be evaluated at the same dose.  1060  
• If the success rate is less than 70%, then another [ADDRESS_1137689] dose (0.25 mg) is unsuccessful , or the [ADDRESS_1137690] level and eye level characteristics will be tabulated including gender, 1070  
race, gestational age, birth weight, examination findings in the study and non -study eye , and age at 1071  
diagnosis of type 1 ROP .  1072  
 1073  
6.3.2 Safety  1074  
Adverse events reported at any time during the study will be tabulat ed for all enrolled infants and 1075  
coded using the MedRA system.  For each dosage level, an estimate and 95% confidence interval of [ADDRESS_1137691] binomial method:  1077  
• Proportion of infants for whom at least one event was reported  1078  
• Proportion of infants with an adverse event thought by [CONTACT_820847] 1079  
drug 1080  
• Proportion of infants for whom at least one serious adverse event was reported  1081  
• Proportion of infant deaths  [ADDRESS_1137692] 1 adverse event in 1085

A Randomized Controlled Trial to Reduce Excess Opi[INVESTIGATOR_525807] 12/31/2018, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], Approved by [CONTACT_494296] 4/16/2018  Page 1 of 3 Study Personnel • Sarah Osmundson MD, MS (Maternal-Fetal Medicine) • Michael Richardson MD (Anesthesiology) • Fellows TBA (Anesthesiology) • Medical Student TBA • Resident TBA (Ob/Gyn) • LeAnn Lam (University of Utah undergraduate, UCHIP program)  Background: The number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_525808] [ADDRESS_682281]-cesarean delivery opi[INVESTIGATOR_525809], nonmedical use, and development of chronic dependence, as well as reduce wasted resources.   Preliminary Data: Phase [ADDRESS_682282] concluded: 1. Overall, most women are prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_525810].  2. There is a subset of women (~25%) who use all opi[INVESTIGATOR_525811]. 3. Inpatient opi[INVESTIGATOR_525812].  4. Data from inpatient use was used to develop a formula for estimating outpatient use based on inpatient use (personalized use)  Objective: To compare a personalized prescribing algorithm based off of inpatient opi[INVESTIGATOR_525813] Ø Inclusion Criteria • Women 18-45 years old • Women undergoing cesarean delivery at VUMC  • English or Spanish Speaking Ø Exclusion Criteria 1. Major post-surgical complications:  o cesarean hysterectomy, bowl or bladder injury, reoperation, ICU admission, wound infection or separation 2. Chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]: Taking buprenorphine during pregnancy or taking an opi[INVESTIGATOR_70996] > 14 days during pregnancy.  Recruitment • Recruitment will on postpartum day 1 in the patient’s postpartum room.

Enrollment • Informed written consent will be obtained by a trained research assistant (i.e. medical student) or by [CONTACT_157550] (Attendings, fellows) • The short form consent will be available in Spanish • After enrollment, complete the Enrollment page in Redcap and ask the patient to complete Survey 1 either in person or by [CONTACT_525816] • Be sure to obtain contact [CONTACT_3031]: Ask for two ways to contact [CONTACT_4317]. • Once enrolled place the laminated Study Banner on the patient’s door, a note in StarPanel, and update the patient summary in order to notify providers and nurses of the patient’s participation.  Randomization • Participants will be randomized just prior to writing the discharge prescription. • Enrolled patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks of 4-8 • Randomization sequence will be developed through sealedenvelope.com • Randomization and allocation will be done through RedCap   Blinding • Blinding will not be used  Intervention 1. Control = Discharge prescription for 30 tablets of oxycodone 5 mg 2. Intervention  o Number of tablets determined by (48.8 + (1.77 x IP2447))/7.5 o Where IP2447 is Inpatient MME = total MME between hours 24:00 to 47:[ADDRESS_682283] to be manually extracted from EMR into RedCap o Minimum threshold of 5 tablets of oxycodone 5 mg  Follow up • All participants will be contact[CONTACT_525817] 14 • Attempts to contact [CONTACT_525818] 3 times before they are designated as “lost to follow up” • If a participant is still using opi[INVESTIGATOR_525814] 14, they should be contact[CONTACT_525819][INVESTIGATOR_2438] • The Controlled Substance Monitoring Database will be accessed for each participant to confirm what prescriptions were filled.   Primary Outcome: Median morphine milligram equivalents (MME) unused after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] = MME filled – (MME used + MME disposed)

With an alpha of 5% and a beta of 80%, we estimate that 160 total participants are required to show a 30% reduction in unused opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]. Assuming a lost to follow up rate of 20%, we plan to enroll 200 women. On average 100 cesareans are performed per month. With a 50% enrollment rate, we anticipate this study will take 4 months to complete

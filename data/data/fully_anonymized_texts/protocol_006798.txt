3 PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
 
 
Objectives: 
 
1. To evaluate the clinical effi cacy (event-free survival) of an intensive short-term chemotherapy 
regimen (Hyper-CVAD program) gi ven in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib 
for Philadelphia (Ph)-positive and/or BCR-ABL-positive acute ly mphoblastic leukemia-ALL). 
 
2. To evaluate other clinical effi cacy (overall response rate a nd survival) and safety of an 
intensive short-term chemotherap y regimen (Hyper-CVAD program) given in combination with the 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib for Philadelphia (Ph)-posit ive and/or BCR-ABL-positive acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia-ALL).  
 
Rationale:  
 
At least 70% of children with A LL can be cured. Adult ALL has a  worse outcome, with 
expected CR rates of around 75%, and long-term event-free survi val (EFS) rates ranging 
from 20% to 35%.The outcomeof pat ients with newly diagnosed Ph- positive ALL treated at 
MD Anderson Cancer Center who w ere treated with hyper-CVAD alon e was recently 
reviewed. The CR rate was 90% wit h no induction deaths observed. The median survival was 
16 months, and median CR duration (CRD) was 10 months. When compared to VAD or other 
conventional chemotherapy programs,  hyper-CVAD was clearly sup erior in terms of CR rate 
(90% vs 55%, p=.002), failure rate (10% vs 37%, p=.014), and me dian disease-free survival 
(42 vs 29 weeks, p=.008). Howeve r, the event-free survival (EFS) rate was 14% and the 3-
year survival and DFS rates we re both less than 10%. Combinatio n of hyper-CVAD with the 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, in Ph+-ALL has be en evaluated and appears to 
be highly effective. Dasatinib ( BMS-354825) is a potent, broad spectrum ATP-competitive 
inhibitor of several tyrosine k inases including BCR-ABL and SRC . Dasatinib is ~500-fold 
more potent than imatinib in inhibiting BCR-ABL by [CONTACT_4639] b oth active and inactive 
conformations of c-ABL , whereas imatinib only binds to the inac tive state. In in vitro studies, 
dasatinib demonstrated curative efficacy against several advanc ed human CML xenografts in 
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, including an imat inib “acquired-resistance” 
model completely insensitive to imatinib. Furthermore, early cl inical studies of dasatinib have 
demonstrated its high activity and limited toxicity in treating  patients with Ph+-leukemias 
including patients with refract ory Ph+-ALL. As such, it is expe cted that combinations of 
chemotherapy regimens used to treat patients with ALL and dasat inib are likely to be 
associated with better response rates and higher likelihood of eradication of minimal residual 
leukemia than those reported with imatinib.

 Disease Group: Leukemia 
  
Treatment Agent: Adriamycin, Cyclophosphamide, C ytarabine, Dasatinib, Dexamethas one, 
Methotrexate, Vincristine, Prednisone, and Sulumedrol 
 
 
Statistical Considerations: 
 
1. The major study objective is to evaluate the event-free survival after hyper-CVAD plus 
dasatinib and achieve a 2-year EFS rate > 60% (based on reporte d data from hyperCVAD plus 
imatinib)21. The study is expected to accrue  115 patients (previously untreated, or after having 
received one or two prior cour se of chemotherapy, or relapsed) over approximately 2 years 
(referral pattern of 15 to 20 patients/year, accrual completed in 12 to 24 months), with an 
additional 12 months of follow-up. This will allow estimates of  CR rates and disease-free 
survivals. Disease-free survival  is the time from documented CR  until relapse or death. Event-free 
Protocol No. 2006-0478 
June 23, 2009 
 
7 survival is the time from treat ment until any failure (resistan t disease, relapse, or death). The 
results will be compar ed descriptively to h istorical controls i n terms of response , survival, toxicity, 
etc. (recently published data). A  95% confidence interval width  will be approximately 11% for the 
CR rate estimated with [ADDRESS_1052981] equivalent to that observed on the previous hyper-CVAD  trial (26 CR of 29 patients). 
Observation of the following numbe r of responses or fewer per n umber of patients evaluated will 
be regarded as evidence for termination: 2/5, 6/10, 10/15, 14/2 0, 18/25, 21/30, 25/35, 29/40, 
33/45, 37/50, 41/55, 45/60, 49/65 , 53/70, 57/75, 61/80, 65/85, 69/90,73/95,77/100,81/105, 
85/110, or 89/115 on the basis tha t there is < 5% probability t hat efficacy is superior to that of 
hyper-CVAD. Using these guidelines, simulation results indicate  the following expected results for 
several values of CR rate:  
 
True rate of CR Probabilit y of early termination 
recommendation Expected median sample size 
(25%, 75%) 
0.6 >0.99 5 (5, 10) 
0.7 0.98 15 (10, 35) 
0.8 0.50 110 (20,115) 
0.85 0.16 115 (115, 115)  
0.9 0.03 115 (115, 115) 
0.95 0.01 115 (115, 115) 
  The molecular CR rate with hyper -CVAD is not known. Quantificat ion of bcr-abl will be measured 
prospectively and analyzed by  [CONTACT_9086]. 
 3. Hyper-CVAD alone has very low toxicity (<5%). In this combin ation trial, if the toxicity rate is 
too high (Pr[Toxicity rate > 5% |Data] > 0.9), then the trial will be stopped (toxicity is defined at the 
beginning of this section). Spec ifically, the trial will be sto pped if the number of patients 
experiencing unacceptable (as defined in section 9.0) toxicitie s /total number of patients is greater 
than or equal to 2/5, 3/12, 4/24 , 5/37, 6/51, 7/65, 8/79, 9/100, or 10/109. The probability to stop 
the trial early is 0.02, 0.12, 0 .73, 0.98 or >0.99 when the tru e toxicity rate is 0.03, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 
or 0.20 respectively. 
 
4. A separate analysis will be carried out for previously treat ed patients (who have received one 
or two prior course of therapy) . The historical number of Philadelphia-positive patients presenting 
after failure of one course of chemotherapy is one of 204 patients (< 1%). The historical rate of patients who achieved a CR afte r one course of chemotherapy con tinuing on hyper-CVAD at 
MDACC is 4 of 208 patients (2%). None were Ph-positive. Thus, t he expected number of patients 
in this category is expected to be small. Patients who have fai led one course o f non-hyper-CVAD 
chemotherapy will be as sessed for CR rate (historical CR rate for ALL overall is 5 of 6 [83%]) and 
disease-free survival .  Patients presenting in CR will be assessed for disease-free survival and 
toxicity only.  
5. A separate analysis will also be carried out fo r patients with relapsed disease, i.e. those with 
Ph-positive ALL or lymphoid blast phase of chronic  myeloid leuk emia who have failed (after 
achieving an initial response) prior therapy which does not inc lude dasatinib. It is expected that

to lack of a suitable donor, age or performance status characteristics, comorbid conditions, or 
relapse of their disease prior  to planned transplant. Patients who successfully undergo allogeneic 
transplant will be censored for disease-free survival at the ti me of transplant. Those patients who 
successfully complete allogeneic  transplant prior to completion of the program will be replaced.

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.0 BACKGROUND 
 
1.1 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) 
 Significant improvements in out come for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have 
been observed, with complete response (CR) rates exceeding 90% with modern chemotherapy 
regimens.
1,[ADDRESS_1052983] 70% of children with ALL can be cured. Adult ALL has a worse outcome, 
with expected CR rates of arou nd 75%, and long-term event-free survival (EFS) rates ranging 
from 20% to 35%.3-7 Prognosis is influenced by [CONTACT_654], performance status, organ func tion, white 
blood cell count, ALL phenotype (CA LLA, T-cell, B-cell, Burkitt 's or Burkitt's-like), karyotype [t(1; 
19), t(4; 11), Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome], and time to achie ve CR. 
 
TABLE I. OUTCOME OF ALL PATIENTS BY [CONTACT_767884] % patients  % Event free survival 
Standard (good) 25 50-60 
Poor (WBC ≥ 5 x 109/L,  
≥ 1 course therapy until CR) 75  20 
Ph (+) 15  10 
 
Kantarjian et al reported the overall results of hyper-CVAD in adult ALL,8,9 with the subsets of 
Burkitt's type ALL and lymphoblas tic lymphoma (LL) being detailed separately.10,11 The outcome 
in both these subtypes has been significantly improved with CR rates of 81% and 96% in Burkitt's 
and LL, respectively. Overall survival for the LL group was imp roved to 75% at [ADDRESS_1052984] ALL regimens.11 
 Overall, the group had a median age of 40 year s (range 15-90 ye ars); 20% of the patients were 
aged 60 or older.
9 The majority of patients were c onsidered high-risk for systemi c relapse (74%) 
or CNS relapse (55%). Compared to  the VAD (vincristine, doxorub icin, dexamethasone) program 
(DM85-43, DM88-015, DM88-150, DM8 9-123), the outcome with hyper -CVAD was significantly 
improved with respect to CR rate and overall survival.8,9 
 The overall CR rate with hyper-C VAD for all subtypes of ALL (n= 288) was 92% with an induction 
mortality of 5% (all due to inf ections). Eleven percent of the patients required 2 courses to 
achieve CR; only 3% of the patient s failed to achieve a remissi on with persistence of the 
leukemia. Leukocytosis and karyot ypic abnormalities were not pr ognostic for achieving CR with 
the hyper-CVAD. Patients with poor performance status, hypoalbu minemia, hyperbilirubinemia 
and hepatomegaly had lower CR rates  (in the range of 68% to 82% )mostly because of high 
induction mortality rate.
9 Side effects were similar to t hose reported in the recent upda te of the 
hyper-CVAD program in Burkitt's type ALL.9,10 
 
Multivariate analysis identified the following factors to be ad verse independent fa ctors for CR 
duration ( P < 0.05): age 
 45 years; leukocytosis 
 50 × 109/L; poor performance (ECOG score of 
3-4); Ph-positive disease; FAB L2 morphology; > 1 course to CR;  and bone marrow blasts > 5%

10 on Day 14. Central nerv ous system relapse was low, with a 7% in cidence in low-risk patients 
(given 4 prophylactic intrat hecal [IT] treatments), 1% in high- risk patients (I6 pr ophylactic ITs), 
and 6% in patients with unknown CN S relapse risk (8 prophylacti c ITs).9 The 5-year continuous 
CR rate was 35% with a 5-year sur vival of 36%. On multivariate analysis, pre-treatment factors 
associated with a shorter survi val included older age, poor per formance status, presence of 
hepatomegaly, high leukocyte count (  50 x 109/L), low platelet count, and presence of Ph+ 
disease. When compared to other published standard regimens of MSKCC,5 SWOG,6 Hoelzer et 
al,4 and Larson et al,7 the outcome was comparable even  though the MDACC patients were older 
and prognostically less favorable. 
 
1.2 Hyper-CVAD in Ph-positive ALL 
 The outcome with hyper-CVAD in new ly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL was recently reviewed by 
[CONTACT_767885].
12 Twenty-nine patients were treated with the regimen 
from 1992 to 1997. Their median age was 41, and median leukocyt e count was 23 x 109/L. The 
CR rate was 90% with no inducti on deaths observed. The median survival was 16 months, and 
median remission duration (CRD)  was 10 months. When compared to  VAD [n=32] (or other 
conventional chemotherapy program s, n=6), the hype r-CVAD was cl early superior in terms of CR 
rate (90% vs 55%, p=.002), failu re rate (10% vs 37%, p=.014), a nd median disease-free survival 
(42 vs 29 weeks, p=.008). The ev ent-free survival (EFS) rate wa s 14%. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_767866], 
the 3-year survival and DFS rates were both less than 10%. 
 1.3 Single Agent lmatinib Mesyl ate in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia and Ph-positive ALL 
 lmatinib mesylate is an inhibito r of a number of protein-tyrosi ne kinases including Bcr-Abl, the 
platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF) receptor and c-Kit, but n ot of other members of the Type Ill 
receptor kinase family, such as  Flt-3 and Fms. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) represents an 
ideal disease for therapy with lmatinib mesylate given that the  Bcr-Abl kinase plays a dominant 
role in the deregulated myeloid cell proliferation which is the  hallmark of this dis ease. Inhibition of 
the Bcr-Abl kinase is most likel y to have anti-leukemic effects  during the chronic phase of CML 
since additional chromosomal abno rmalities may drive the malign ant process during accelerated 
phase and blast crisis. However , activity has already been obse rved during these later phases of 
the disease.   
lmatinib mesylate shows selectivity for the Abl protein-tyrosin e kinase at the in vitro, cellular and 
in vivo level.
[ADDRESS_1052985] established it as the therapy of choice in this 
disease.
16-19 
 Although the single agent response rate with imatinib mesylate in relapsed or 
refractory Ph+ALL is encouragi ng, ongoing maintained responses (after short follow-up) were 
observed in only a small number  of patients treated by [CONTACT_767886].
20 They treated 56 patients 
with relapsed or refractory Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 48 patients) or chronic 
Protocol No. 2006-[ADDRESS_1052986] crisis (LyBC; 8 patients ). Imatinib was given once daily 
at 400 mg or 600 mg. Imatinib indu ced complete hematologic resp onses (CHRs) and complete 
marrow responses (marrow-CRs) in 29% of ALL patients (CHR, 19%;  marrow-CR, 10%), which 
were sustained for at least 4 weeks in 6% of patients. Median e stimated time to progression and 
overall survival for ALL patients were 2.2 and 4.9 months, resp ectively. CHRs were reported for 3 
(38%) of the patients with LyBC (one sustained CHR). Grade 3 or  4 treatment-related 
nonhematologic toxicity was repor ted for 9% of patients; none of the patients discontinued 
therapy because of nonhematologic adverse reactions. Grade 4 ne utropenia and 
thrombocytopenia occurred in 54%  and 27% of patients, respectiv ely. Imatinib therapy resulted in 
a clinically relevant hematologic response rate in relapsed or refractory Ph(+) acute lymphoid 
leukemia patients, but development of resistance and subsequent  disease progression were 
rapid.[ADDRESS_1052987] reported on the results of a phase II clinica l trial of concurrent hyper-CVAD 
and imatinib to improve the above results of combination chemot herapy. The initial regimen of 
imatinib 400 mg orally daily day s 1-14 of each course (fraction ated cyclophosphamide, vincristine 
[VCR], doxorubicin and dexamethasone alternating with high dose  methotrexate and cytarabine) 
was followed by [CONTACT_86935], VCR a nd prednisone maintenance with i ntensifications months 6 and 
13. Allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) was performed in CR i f feasible. Preliminary results of 
first 20 patients treated were encouraging.21 Recent modifications included increasing the dose of 
imatinib to 600 mg daily days 1-14 of course 1, then daily if t olerated with courses 2-8. 
Maintenance was extended to 24 months with imatinib indefinitel y. At the time of the report, 43 
patients with Ph+ ALL had been treated from April 2004 to July 2005. Thirty-six patients had 
active disease, either untreated (n=31) or refractory (n=5) to one induction course without 
imatinib; 7 patients were in CR after one induction course with out imatinib. Of 35 evaluable 
patients, 33 (94%) achieved CR (1 induction death, 1 failed to meet platelet criteria for CR). 
Median time to response was [ADDRESS_1052988] within a median of 
3 months from start of therapy (range, 1-12). After a median fo llow-up of 3 years (range 1-48 
months), [ADDRESS_1052989] (no post SCT imatinib) and 2 patients changed 
therapy for persistent Ph+ metapha ses (1 relapsing). Deaths in CR included [ADDRESS_1052990] (1 osteom yelitis, 1 mucormycosis, 1 C. d ifficile colitis, 1 sudden death, 1 
GNR sepsis) and [ADDRESS_1052991] ([ADDRESS_1052992] disease, 1 GNR sepsis). 
Outcome with the hyper-CVAD and im atinib regimen continues to d emonstrate favorable disease-
free survival rates compared with hyper-CVAD alone, particularly for the de novo group. Use of 
higher dose imatinib concurrent ly appears to be feasible. Molecular response rates appear to be 
improved with the higher dose imatinib.  Dasatinib (BMS-354825 ) is a potent, broad spectrum ATP-competitive inhibitor of several tyrosine 
kinases including BCR-ABL and SR C. Dasatinib is ~260fold more p otent than imatinib in 
inhibiting BCR-ABL by [CONTACT_767887] c-ABL, whereas 
imatinib only binds to the inacti ve state. In in vitro studies, dasatinib demonstrated curative 
efficacy against several advanced  human CML xenografts in sever e combined immunodeficiency

12 (SCID) mice, including an imatin ib “acquired-resistance” model completely insensitive to imatinib. 
Furthermore, early clinical studies of dasatinib have demonstra ted its high activity and limited 
toxicity in treating patients wi th Ph+-leukemias including pati ents with refractory Ph+-ALL. As 
such, it is expected that combinations of chemotherapy regimens  used to treat patients with ALL 
and dasatinib are likely to be as sociated with better response rates and higher likelihood of 
eradication of minimal residual leukemia than those reported wi th imatinib. 
 
In a recently reported study (ASH  2005), a total of 78 patients  with either Ph+ ALL (n=36) or CML 
in lymphoid blast phase (n=42) were treated with dasatinib. An overall hematological response 
rate of 73% including a complete  hematological response rate of  52% was reported (31% in Ph+ 
ALL and 21% in CML lymphoid blast phase). Another 18% had no evidence of leukemia but with 
inadequate count recovery for a response. Complete cytogenetic responses were noted in 21 
(58%) of Ph+ ALL patients and 15 (43%) of patients with CML in lymphoid blast phase. 
Therefore, dasatinib appears to be highly active in this settin g and merits further investigation in 
combination with standard chemotherapy. 
1.5   Summary of Results of Inv estigational Program for Dasatin ib 
Dasatinib has been administered to over 2000 subjects; the majority with CML refractory or 
intolerant to imatinib.  Other target populations studied inclu de Ph+ ALL and metastatic solid 
tumors. Additional background information on preclinical pharma cology, toxicology and 
pharmacokinetics may be found in  the Investigator Brochure.38 
1.5.1 Preclinical Anti-tumor Activity 
[IP_ADDRESS] In Vitro Molecular Studies 
Dasatinib competes with ATP for the ATP-binding site in the kin ase domain of selected protein 
tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and has been shown to inhibit at least five protein tyrosine 
kinases/kinase families: SRC family kinases, BCR-ABL, c-KIT, EPHA2 and the PDGF  receptor. 
Dasatinib is much more potent than imatinib mesylate. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Cellular Studies 
Dasatinib inhibits the BCR-ABL kinase with an in vitro  IC50 of 3 nM, a potency that was 260-fold 
greater than that of imatinib mesylate (IC 50 = 790 nM). In cellular assays, dasatinib killed or 
inhibited the proliferation of all BCR-ABL dependent leukemic cell lines tested to date. Dasatinib 
also demonstrated undiminished antitumor activity against sever al preclinically- and clinically-
derived models of imatinib mesyl ate resistance. Evidence that S RC family kinase over expression 
may play a role in clinical resistance to imatinib mesylate was  demonstrated in three CML cell 
lines established from patients wh o failed imatinib mesylate th erapy. These cells remained highly 
sensitive to the cell-killin g effects of dasatinib.[ADDRESS_1052993]  the K562/imatinib 
mesylate/R CML model, dasatinib was curative in 100% of the tre ated animals. In contrast, at its 
optimal dose and schedule, imatinib mesylate was inactive. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Preclinical Toxicology 
Single or repeated oral administration of dasatinib principally  affected the gastro-intestinal (GI) 
tract, including the liver, the hematopoietic and lymphoid syst ems in rats and monkeys. Other 
prominent effects after single oral administration of dasatinib  included renal and cardiac toxicity in 
rats at lethal doses, and cutaneous hemorrhage in monkeys. Dasa tinib can also affect the 
immune system and bone turnover. 
Dasatinib in vitro  activity in the HERG/IKr and Purkinje-fiber assays indicated a  moderate liability 
for prolongation of cardiac ventricular repolarization (QT inte rval) in the clinic. However, there 
were no dasatinib-related changes observed in electrocardiogram s, nervous system function, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_383959], blood pressure, or arterial oxygen  saturation in single-dose, 10-day, 
or 1-month oral toxicity studies in monkeys. 
Dasatinib was found to exhibit a profile of broad-spectrum plat elet inhibition best typi[INVESTIGATOR_97085]-
platelet agents such as the GP IIb/IIIa antagonists, integrelin and abciximab. 
Finally, modulation of SRC kinase activity could also affect os teoclast morphology and function 
and bone remodeling. This effect could potentially result in an  increase in bone mineral density 
and a phenotype analogous to osteopetrosis.38 
 [IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of oral dasatinib have been extensively studied in normal volunteers and in 
subjects with leukemia. Studies in subjects with solid tumors a re currently in progress.  
After an oral dose of 70 mg, the recommended dose in recurrent CML, a peak level of 50 – 60 ng/mL is attained at 1 – 1.5 hours followed by [CONTACT_767888] h alf-life of 4 – 5 hours. Good 
bioavailability of the clinical tablet formulation has been doc umented. No accumulation has been 
observed in any schedule. Dose proportionality was documented o ver the entire dose range from 
15 – 240 mg/day, although substantial interpatient variability has been observed. No significant 
effect of age, gender, race or disease state has been detected.  No clinically-significant food effect 
was found, but antacid treatment  markedly reduced exposure. Pla sma protein binding has been 
estimated at 96% based on in vitro  studies, and distributes freely into red blood cells 
(blood:plasma ratio ~1.8); estimated volume of distribution is approximately 9-fold greater than 
total body water.  
Metabolism is primarily via CYP3A4, followed by [CONTACT_767889]; renal excretion is minimal. 
Clinically-significant increases in dasatinib exposure were obs erved with concomitant 
ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor) and decreases with concomitan t rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513] (a CYP3A4 
inducer). For additional detail, see the Investigator Brochure,  Appendix I.

14 1.5.3.  Experience in CML 
Clinical experience with dasatinib in chronic phase (CP) CML is  considered more applicable to 
patients with solid tumors than that in advanced-phase CML or P h+ ALL, and will be summarized 
briefly. 
One phase I study in CML, which included 40 subjects with progr essive CP CML, was open for 
accrual from November, 2003, to April, 2005. Two Phase II studi es in subjects with imatinib-
resistant or –intolerant CP CML were open from February to July , 2005 (CA180013; n=424) and 
February to September, 2005 (CA180017; n=150). A Phase III randomized study in CP CML 
(CA180034; n=670) was open for ac crual from July, 2005 to March , 2006.  
In addition, over 1,000 subjects  with recurrent advanced-phase CML or Ph+ ALL have been 
studied in Phase I (CA180002, n=44), Phase II (CA180005, CA1800 06, and CA180015, n=420), 
and Phase III (CA180035, n=613).39,40,41,42,43,[ADDRESS_1052994] chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, the l evel of hematologic toxicity 
observed may partly be the result of the underlying leukemic di agnosis and the extensive prior 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_767867]. 
Subsequently, two r andomized phase III studies were launched (C A1800034 and CA1800035) to 
compare efficacy and safety of QD vs BID schedules in all phase s of CML and of different daily 
dose in chronic phase CML. These studies have closed to accrual . 
Two Phase I trials are in progress in patients with recurrent o r progressive solid tumors, one with 
a BID and one with a QD schedule.  To date, the safety profile i n solid tumor subjects has been 
s i m i l a r  t o  t h a t  i n  C P  C M L  s u b j e c t s  with the exception that myel osuppression (attributable to 
suppression of the Bcr-Abl-driven clone) has not been observed in solid tumor patients. No MTD 
has been reached in these studies. 
1.5.4. Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment 
The most common side effects of d asatinib are skin rash, fluid retention including pleural effusion, 
headache, fever, fatigue or weakness, gastrointestinal symptoms  including bloating or flatulence, 
diarrhea or nausea, and discomfort in muscles or joints. Less c ommon side effects include 
pneumonitis, constipation or abdominal pain, hypocalcemia, shortness of breath, neurologic 
changes such as tingling, confusion or dizziness. Minimal myelo suppression has been observed 
in subjects with solid tumo rs treated with dasatinib. 
1.5.5.  Phase II Experience 
Subjects with AP CML, MyBP CML and LyBP CML or Ph+ ALL were enrolled in three Phase II 
studies using a dose of [ADDRESS_1052995] patients 
were extensively treated with imatinib. Cytogenetic responses w ere documented in 13/24 
patients, including 4 complete and 2 partial responses. Molecular response data is not yet available. Profound myelosuppres sion (Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and Grade 4 neutropenia) 
were reported in 20 and 17 patients respectively. Non-hematolog ic toxicities included diarrhea 
Protocol No. 2006-0478 
June 23, 2009 
 
15 (10 patients), nausea (5 patient s), headache (5 patients), peripheral edema (3 patients) and 
pleural effusion (2 patients) all Grade [ADDRESS_1052996] been 
reported.38  Major hematologic responses we re seen in 16/29 (55%) of patie nts, with 7 complete 
hematologic responses and 9 with no evidence of leukemia. Cytog enetic responses were seen in 
13 (45%) [21% complete, 12% partial). Molecular response data is not yet available. Grade 4 
neutropenia occurred in 59% and grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 56% of patients. Other 
non hematologic toxicity, usually  Grade 1-2, included diarrhea (8 pts), rash (4 pts), nausea (3pts), 
peripheral edema (3pts) and pleural effusion (4 pts). 
Data from the first 28 (13 CML-LBC and 13 Ph+ ALL) patients acc rued to the START-L Study for 
CML Lymphoid Blast Crisis or Ph+ ALL have been reported.38  Seventy seven patients were 
enrolled to the study. Thirteen patients had a MHR (7 CHR and 6 no evidence of leukemia). 
Twelve (12) patients had a cyt ogenetic response within 1-3 mont hs (11 complete, 1 minor). The 
majority of patients had Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression, in some  cases pre-existing to study 
participation. Grade 4 hematologic toxicities include neutropen ia (64%) and thrombocytopenia 
(71%), Non-hematologic toxicity included Grade 1-2 peripheral e dema (3 pts), Grade 1 facial 
edema (2 pts), GI intolerance was infrequent. 
More recent trials have demonstrated that once daily dosing is associated with a lower toxicity 
and similar efficacy.45 
 
1.5.6 CD20 expressi on and rituximab 
 
Immunophenotypic classification of acute lymphoblastic leukemia  (ALL) has well recognized 
prognostic implications. The significance of CD20 expression has been evaluated in childhood 
precursor B-lineage ALL with conf licting results . In a recently  published report, our group  
retrospectively analyzed the influence of CD20 expression on ou tcome in 253 adults with de novo 
precursor B-lineage ALL treated with either conventional (VAD/C VAD) or intensive (hyper-CVAD) 
frontline regimens in the pre-rituximab era. Overall, CD20 posi tivity > 20% was associated with 
lower 3-year rates of complete remission duration (CRD) (20% vs 55%, p<.001) and overall 
survival (OS) (27% vs 40%, p=.03). In the CD20 negative subse t, the 3-year rates for CRD (58% 
vs 42%, p=.04) and OS (60% vs 28%, p< .001) were superior for hy per-CVAD compared with 
VAD/CVAD; rates were particularly favourable for the CD20 negat ive younger age group (68% 
and 85%, respectively). In contrast, 3-year CRD and OS rates we re uniformly poor for the CD20 
positive group regardless of ther apy (27% or less). Multivariat e analysis for event -free survival 
identified older age, leukocyte count >30 x 109/L, presence of Philadelphia chromosome, high 
systemic risk classification,  and CD20 positivity as independen t predictors of worse outcome. The 
authors concluded that CD20 expression in de novo adult precursor B-lineage ALL appears to be 
associated with a poor prognosis and suggested that the incorpo ration of monoclonal antibodies 
directed against CD20 into front line chemotherapy regimens warr ants investigation.[ADDRESS_1052997] seen 
that approximately 45% of patients with Ph+ ALL express the CD2 0 antigen.

4.2. General Considerations 
 
Protocol No. 2006-0478 
June 23, 2009 
 
18 1. The hyper-CVAD (odd courses) w ill alternate with high dose m ethotrexate and cytarabine 
(even courses) administered on 21 or later day cycle (as count recovery allows), or 
earlier if count recovery allows.  
 Anti-emetic therapy with each course of intensive chemotherapy  as needed.  
 G-CSF will be administered with  each course after the completi on of 
chemotherapy. 
 Next course may be started wh en granulocytes > 1.0 x 109/L and platelets  50 x 
109/L, following discontinuation o f G-CSF. Courses may be started with dose 
reductions prior to full platele t recovery, if the treatment is  delayed (e.g., greater 
than [ADDRESS_1052999] course).   
 Prophylactic antibiotics may be given with each course until n eutrophil recovery 
to 500/L or greater (or other antibioti cs if being treated for active infection). 
Suggestions include:  Levaquin 500 mg p.o. daily (or other quin olone) or 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole double strength one tablet p.o. b.i.d. or other 
appropriate antibacterial agent. F luconazole 200 mg p.o. daily or itraconazole 
200 mg p.o. bid. or other appropri ate antifungal agent. Valacyclovir 500 mg p.o. 
daily or acyclovir 200 mg p.o. b.i .d. or other appropriate anti viral agent.  
 Dasatinib [ADDRESS_1053000] course of 
intensive chemotherapy (course 1 doses may be adjusted  4-5 days if therapy 
changed from frontline protocol o nce cytogenetics known). For s ubsequent 
courses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 dasatinib 70 mg po daily will be g iven continuously 
without interruptions unless due to toxicity. 
 Patients who enter the program in  CR or with part ial response after one course of 
therapy may start this program either with course 1 or 2 depend ing on their prior 
therapy, with the decision made by [CONTACT_079] a t study entry. 
 For patients with CD20 expressi on (≥ 20% by [CONTACT_4133]) Rituximab 375 
mg/m2 on days 1 and 11 of cycles 1 an d 3, and days 1 and 8 of cycles  2 and 4. 
For patients with CD20 expression (≥ 20% by [CONTACT_4133]) Rit uximab 375 
mg/m2 on days 1 and 11 of t he intensification cycles in months 6 and 13. If 
patients do not receive the int ensification cycles, they may re ceive Rituximab 
alone 375 mg/m2 on days 1 and 11 of maintenance  cycle in months 6 and 13. 
 In general 8 cycles of chemother apy (4 hyperCVAD, 4 methotrexa te plus 
cytarabine) will be administered in approximately 3 to 4 week intervals 
(depending on the recovery of blood counts). This will be follo wed by 
[CONTACT_3450] [ADDRESS_1053001] of 
the patient are allowed after discussion with the principal inv estigator. Patients 
will be followed indefinitely  for relapse and survival. 
 All patients should have a ches t radiograph before each course  of methotrexate 
and cytarabine; methotrexate dose will be adjusted as indicated  below for pleural 
effusions. 
 
2. Total number of prophylactic i ntrathecal treatments for newly diagnosed patients will be 
as follows (2 intrathecals of methotrexate on day 2  2 days and cytarabine day 7   2 
days with each course of chemothe rapy until total number reache d):  
 Indeterminate or high-risk diseas e: 8 intrathecals Serum lacta te dehydrogenase 
(LDH) > 1400 U/L; or Proliferative index %S + G2M ≥  14%; or De novo LDH

or prior CNS disease, discuss m anagement of CNS with the princi pal 
investigator.  
 If active CNS disease: Consider methotrexate alternating with cytarabine (see 
sections 5.3 and 5.4) twice week ly until CSF clear; then once w eekly for 4 weeks, 
then back to prophylactic schedule. Consider XRT to the base of  the skull, 
particularly with cranial nerve  root involvement (cranial nerve  palsies). Alternative 
methods of treating CNS disease are allowed if appropriate for the patient (e.g., 
intrathecal liposomal cytarabi ne, or others). Modifications to the regimen thought 
to be necessary for administrati on of XRT are allowed after dis cussion with the 
principal investigator. 
 CSF specimens obtained during therapeutic and diagnostic lumba r punctures will 
be evaluated for presence of minimal residual leukemia and β-2 microglobulin: 
(1) first spi[INVESTIGATOR_767868] M D Anderso n, (2) first lumbar puncture  after CR is

May resume at dose of 70 mg  po daily for grade III or IV non-
hematological toxicity; consider discontinuing if toxicity recu rs. 
Other modifications should be di scussed with the principal inve stigator. 
If ANC < 0.5 x 10
9/L or platelets < 30 x 109/L: 
Hold until ANC > 1 x 109/L and platelet count > 50 x 109/L, and wait for 
recovery. If recovery occurs in < 2 weeks, resume at same dose. If recovery occurs > 2 weeks, res ume at 80 mg po daily level. 
Recurrent neutropenia may be managed with dose modifications af ter 
discussion with the Principal Investigator. 
If there is inadequate cytogenetic/molecular  response, the dose  of dasatinib may 
be increased to 70 mg twic e daily or 140 mg po daily. 
 
 lntensifications interrupting maintenance phase as follows: 
 1. Two intensifications with one course of hyper-CVAD plus dasa tinib [ADDRESS_1053009] been described and reported. Known and anticipated side effects of this regimen (A ppendix E) will not be reported as 
individual ADRs, according to the Code of Federal Regulations and ICH guidelines BCGP Section 4.1 I. I,p. 24. This also complie s with the NCI CTEP-CTC guidel ines which state that for expected 
events grade 4 myelosup pression or other grade 4 events that do  not require expedited reporting 
will be specified in the pr otocol (Section 12.0). 
The trial will be closely monitored for any adverse effect of d asatinib on the expected toxicity and 
CR rate for the first [ADDRESS_1053010] 
10 patients will receive their ent ire 8 courses of chemotherapy  treatment in Houston in order to be 
closely monitored. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_767871] b e considered if early induction 
mortality exceeds 20%. Thus the study will be stopped if deaths /treated patients is  >1/5 or >2/10. 
The trial will also be stopped  if the number of patients experi encing unacceptable toxicities (as 
Protocol No. 2006-0478 
June 23, 2009 
 
24 defined in section 9.0)/total number of patients is greater tha n or equal to 2/5, 3/12, 4/24, or 5/37. 
The continuation of study a t the above doses will be dependent on clear evidence that the 
addition of dasatinib will not adversely affect these parameter s as compared to previous regimens 
including hyperCVAD and hyperCVAD plus gleevec. 
. 
Recognizing there w ill be instances where patient cannot receive all of their therapy at M.D . 
Anderson, the following monitori ng plan will be implemented as feasible: 
 All patients who enter therapy wit h active disease will receive  their first course of therapy at M. D. 
Anderson, and will be monitor ed until CR or failure to respond.   
 Subsequent courses of therapy may  be given by a local physician under direction of the M. D. 
Anderson Cancer Center treating physician or the principal inve stigator (The first 10 patients will 
receive their entire 8 course s of therapy at M D Anderson). The patient will be given a copy of the 
protocol, instructions, and the M. D. Anderson contact [CONTACT_767892] [INVESTIGATOR_767872], with telephone an d fascimile numbers. The refer ring physician w ill be identified, 
contact[CONTACT_767893]. It will be detail ed that therapy should not be 
administered unless carrying out handwritten chemotherapy order s compi[INVESTIGATOR_767873] M. D. Anderson. A recent weight to calculate BSA, review of 
laboratory data, review of compliance with dasatinib, and review of toxicities will be performed. 
Orders will be written by M. D. A nderson treating physician or the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_767874]'s status with the treating physician.  
 
Physicians will be requested to sign a letter stipulating these  items, and indicating their 
willingness to defer a ll decisions re garding the chemotherapy a nd dasatinib to MDACC. 
Documentation will be requested from outsi de physicians, includ ing drug administration records 
to ensure that the orders were fo llowed. Outside physicians will be asked to contact [CONTACT_767894].  
5. CONCOMITTANT MEDICATIONS 
Short-acting antacid agents may be taken, but it is recommended  that these not be taken from 2 
hours before to 2 hours afte r dosing of dasatinib.  
Dasatinib may be taken with meals. The dosing time may be adjus ted as required (for bid 
schedules recommend skippi[INVESTIGATOR_767875] 6 hours, for qd dosing recommend 
skippi[INVESTIGATOR_767876] 12 hours). If doses  are missed for toxicity, they 
should not be replaced. If vomiti ng occurs within [ADDRESS_1053011] a risk of causing Torsades de 
Pointes (including: quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, amio darone, sotalol, ibutilide, 
dofetilide, erythromycins, clarithromycin, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, mesoridazine, thioridazine, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], cisapride, bepridil, droperidol, methadone, arsenic, chloroquine, domperidone, 
halofantrine, levomethadyl, pentam idine, sparfloxacin, lidoflaz ine) should change these to 
acceptable alternatives. 
 
Medications that inhibit platelet function (i.e., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], dipy ridamole, epoprostenol, eptifibatide, 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], cilostazol, abciximab, ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325], and any non-st eroidal anti-inflammatory drug) or 
Protocol No. 2006-0478 
June 23, 2009 
 
25 Anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin/low molecular weight heparin [e.g., danaparoid, dalteparin, 
tinzaparin, enoxaparin]) should be avoided as much as possible.  
Exceptions include low-dose warfarin for prophylaxis to prevent  catheter thrombosis, and for 
heparin-flushes for IV  lines. If patients develop deep vein thr ombosis during the course of therapy 
or are receiving anticoagulation for indications such as recent  thrombosis or artificial heart valves 
these drugs may be continued wi th close monitoring of the patie nts. 
 
When used concomitantly with drug s known to be CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin, consider 
increasing the dose of dasatinib  with careful monitoring for to xicity. When used concomitantly with 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, consider decreasing the dasatinib dose.  
Proton pump inhibitors may be administered concomitantly with d asatinib if felt to be in the 
patient’s best interest.

8.1.  Dasatinib 
8.1.1. Introduction  
 
Dasatinib (BMS-354825 ) is a potent, broad spectrum ATP-competit ive inhibitor of 5 critical 
oncogenic tyrosine kinases/kinas e families: BCR-ABL, SRC, c-KIT , PDGFR, and ephrin (EPH) 
receptor kinases, each of which  has been strongly linked to mul tiple forms of human 
malignancies. BCR-ABL is a consti tutively active protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) present in >90% 
of patients with CML and 15-30% of adult patients with ALL. Num erous studies have 
demonstrated that BCR-ABL activi ty is required for the transfor ming ability of this protein.
23,24 With 
the approvals of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec®
, Glivec®
, STI-571), inhibition of BCR-ABL has 
proven effective in management of CML, particularly chronic pha se where the hematologic 
response rate is >90%. However, patients with advanced disease are much less sensitive to 
imatinib, and experience less fr equent and transient responses.16 Clinical refractoriness to 
imatinib has been associated with the development of multiple mechanisms of drug resistance, including BCR-ABL gene mutation/over-expression and activation of selected SRC kinases.
25,26 
Dasatinib is ~260fold more potent than imatinib in inhibiting BCR-ABL by [CONTACT_767895] c-ABL, whereas imatinib only bind s to the inactive state. 
This 
difference in binding may be resp onsible for the vastly increas ed potency of dasatinib over 
imatinib.  
Protocol No. 2006-[ADDRESS_1053014] activated SRC kinase, 
providing strong evidence linki ng SRC activation with tumor pro gression and metastasis.27 
In 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_54578], SRC promotes metastasis by [CONTACT_767896]/o r weakening the normally strong 
cell-cell adhesions. At the same time, SRC increases the cell-m atrix interaction and enhances cell 
migration.28,29 
 
c-KIT is the receptor for stem-cell factor (SCF).[ADDRESS_1053015] been strongly implicated  in the pathogenesis of 
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).32,[ADDRESS_1053016] cases of adult sporadic mastocytosis, germ cell tumors, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and sinonasal natural killer/ T-cell lymphoma.
35 This latter 
form of mutant KIT has been shown to be insensitive to imatinib . Other types of tumors in which 
c-KIT dysregulation has been implicated include small cell lung  cancer (SCLC), neuroblastoma, 
melanoma, ovarian carcinoma, and breast carcinoma.[ADDRESS_1053017] b een implicated in many 
forms of solid tumors, including glioblastoma, meningiomas, mel anomas, neuroendocrine tumors, 
ovarian, pancreatic, gastric, lung, and prostate cancer.36 There is strong evidence supporting 
autocrine PDGF stimulation of tumor cell growth and paracrine PDGF stimulation of tumor angiogenesis as t he underlying drivers of the oncogenic potential of PDGF and its receptors.
37  
 
 
 
8.1.2. Nonclinical Studies  
 Dasatinib has been extensively studied in vivo and in vitro.  I n vivo, at doses well below maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD), dasatinib  demonstrated curative efficacy against several advanced human 
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CM L) xenografts in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) 
mice, including an imatinib “acqui red-resistance” model complet ely insensitive to imatinib. 
Dasatinib also demonstrated antit umor efficacy against several susceptible cancer models in 
nude mice, and is a potent inhibito r of vascular endothelial gr owth factor (VEGF)-stimulated 
proliferation and migration in  human umbilical vein endothelial  cells (HUVECs). In cellular assays, 
dasatinib killed BCR-ABL dependen t leukemic cell lines, includi ng a number that are resistant to 
imatinib whether due to mutations that affect drug binding or t hrough overexpression of SRC 
kinases. Against 4 imatinib naive  CML cell lines, cytotoxicity potency was 300-655 times higher 
for dasatinib than for imatinib. D asatinib inhibited cellular proliferation of numerous cancer cell 
lines that express activated SRC or c-KIT.  
 8.1.3. Effects in Humans   
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BM S) began Phase 1 clinical devel opment of dasatinib in 
November 2003.  Since then, dasat inib has been studied in more than 900 patients with CML and 
Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leuk emia (ALL) resistant or 
intolerant to imatinib, and a num ber of solid tumors. Prelimina ry clinical pharm acokinetic (PK) 
data indicate that dasatinib has g ood oral absorption, is >90% protein bound and is predicted to 
have a large volume of distribut ion.  Comparable dosing interva l exposures are seen regardless 
of whether dasatinib is administe red once daily (QD) or twice d aily (BID).  Dasatinib’s overall 
Protocol No. 2006-[ADDRESS_1053018] importantly, severe thromb ocytopenia.  In cases of severe myelosuppression, recovery 
generally occurred following short dose interruptions. Other severe hematologic toxicities were uncommon.  In advanced CML and Ph+ ALL, sev ere myelosuppression  was noted in most 
patients. In solid tumor patient s, however, ther e was no clinic ally important myelosuppression.  
Nonhematologic toxicities consisted primarily of gastrointestin al (GI) intolerance, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_767878] c hronic phase CML patients an d mild to moderate in patients 
with advanced disease. In patient s with advanced disease, espec ially blast phase, there was 
evidence of fluid retention, pleural and pericardial effusion. In all CML and Ph+ ALL patients, 
there were very few changes in bl ood chemistries and there were  no instances of severe drug-
related hepatic dysfunction.  ECG measurements suggest a modera te QTc prolongation (4 
chronic, 2 advanced patients had >60 msec increase from baselin e in QTc).  
Major cytogenetic response and complete hematologic response ha ve been observed in a large 
number of imatinib resistant and intolerant patients in all pha ses of disease. The complete 
hematologic response rate in ch ronic phase CML was 90% (36/40) and was similar with QD and 
BID schedules. The major hematologic  response rate was 71% (30/42) in patients with CML and 
Ph+ ALL.  Cytogenetic responses were docum ented in 52% (22/42),  including major cytogenetic 
responses in 7 of 21 with BCR/ABL  mutations reported to confer resistance to imatinib.    
Recently Sawyers et al presented an update of a Phase I dose-es calating study, initiated in 
November 2003, of dasatinib in im atinib-resistant/intolerant pa tients with CML in late chronic 
phase (CP) or advanced disease (a ccelerated phase [AP], myeloid blast crisis [MBC] or lymphoid 
blast crisis [LBC]) or with Ph+  ALL. Data were available for 84 patients (40 CP , 10 AP, 23 MBC, 
11 LBC/Ph+ ALL). At the time of t he report, 40 CP patients, with 8 years median duration of CML 
(range: 1–17 yrs), had been treated with dasatinib (15–180 mg/d ay, once-daily [QD] or twice daily 
[BID]) for a median of 13 months . The rate of complete hematolo gic response (CHR) in CP was 
88% (35/40). Major cytogenetic res ponses (MCyR) were observed i n 40% (16/40), with complete 
CyR (CCyR) in 33% ( 13/40). In advanced disease, 44 patients hav e been treated with dasatinib 
(70–240 mg/day, BID) for a median of 3–7 months; 2 patients (1 MBC and 1 LBC) were not 
evaluable for response, but wer e included in the analysis of ti me to progression. The rate of major 
hematologic response (MHR) (bone mar
 row blasts <5 %) was 80% (8/ 10) in AP, 77% (17/22) in 
MBC and 60% (6/10) in LBC/Ph+ ALL. The CHR rate (<5% bone marrow blasts, with recovery of peripheral blood counts) is 50% ( 5/10) in AP, 18% (4/22) in MBC and 50% (5/10) in LBC/Ph+ 
ALL. The overall rates of MCyR an d CCyR in advanced disease wer e 36% (15/42) and 21% 
(9/42), respectively. Cytogenetic responses were seen in patien ts with a wide spectrum of BCR-
ABL mutations, as well as in pati ents with minimal or no prior CyR with imatinib. Treatment was 
well tolerated. Reversible grade 3–4 myelosuppression was observed in all cohorts [CP (38%); 
AP (70%); MBC and LBC/ Ph+ ALL (91%)]. 8 patients developed une xplained pleural effusions (2 
CP; 6 BC), which were easily m anaged without treatment disconti nuation. No patients have gone 
off study for toxicity. Respons es were durable in CP and AP pat ients, but relapses had occurred 
in the MBC and LBC/Ph+ ALL coho rts, often due to dasatinib-resi stant BCR-ABL mutations. Their 
data support the therapeutic potent ial of dasatinib in patients  with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant 
CML/Ph+ ALL. In summary, dasatin ib has an acceptable safety pro file and demonstrated 
evidence of activity in all phases of CML and Ph+ ALL. 
Talpaz et al also reported the pr eliminary results from a Phase  II trial in CML patients in myeloid 
blast crisis (MBC), which was initiated in December 2004. This open-label study was carried out 
in 37 centers worldwide between  December 2004 and May 2005. A total of 74 imatinib-resistant 
(IM-R) or imatinib intolerant (IM -I) MBC pts were  accrued (41 male, median age 56 years [range 
Protocol No. 2006-0478 
June 23, 2009 
 
30 21-71]). Preliminary data were available on the first 34 patien ts (29 IM-R and 5 IM -I). Dasatinib 
was administered orally, at a dos e of 70 mg twice daily (BID) i n a continuous daily dosing 
schedule; dose escalation to 100 mg BID was permitted for patie nts who did not achieve 
hematologic response and dose redu ction to 50 mg and 40 mg BID was allowed in the presence 
of persistent toxicity. Complet e blood counts were performed we ekly and bone marrow 
assessment, including cytogenetic analysis, w as performed month ly. Mutations in the BCR-ABL 
domain were assessed in all patients. Pretreatment characteristics of these 34 patients included: 
71% male, median age 54 years (range 21 – 71). Median duration of CML from first diagnosis 
was 49.3 months (ran ge 5.6 – 215.5). Prior therapy included bone marrow transplant (5 pts, 15%) 
and interferon (18 pts, 53%). In 44% of pts, the highest IM dos e was >600 mg/day and 41% of pts 
received IM for >[ADDRESS_1053019] res ponses to IM were complete he matologic response (CHR) in 
82% of patients and major cytogenet ic response in 39% of patients (complete in 27%, and partial 
in 12%). At baseline, 35% o f pts had a WBC count ≥20 x 103/mm3, 71% had a platelet count <100 
x 103/mm3 and 24% had ≥50% bone ma rrow blasts. BCR-ABL mutations were documented in 
4/10 patients. Dasatinib doses were increased in 32% of patient s while dose reductions were 
required in 21% of patients, mos tly due to persistent thrombocy topenia. Major hematologic 
responses were documented in 16/ 29 (55%) patients with 7 CHR an d 9 no evidence of leukemia 
(CHR without complete recovery o f PMN or platelets). There were  13 (45%) cytogenetic 
responses, including 6 (21%) comp lete (0% Ph+) and 5 (17%) part ial (1 – 35% Ph+). Dasatinib 
therapy was associated with rapi d and profound myelosuppression. PMN <500/ l occurred in 
59% of patients and platelets <25 x 103 /l in 56% of pts. Non-hematologic toxicities were 
uncommon and usually grade 1 or 2 , with diarrhea in 8 patients,  rash in 4 patients, nausea in 3 
patients (1 grade 3) and peripher al edema in 3 patients. 4 patients had pleural effusion. This 
preliminary data provided further evidence of the activity of dasatinib in CML patients with MBC and of its acceptable safety profile. 
  8.1.4. Formulation and chemical properties 
 Dasatinib is supplied for clinic al research as 20 mg and 50 mg film-coated tablets and 
commercially as 70 mg film-coated  tablets containing dasatinib with lactose monohydrate, 
microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropy l cellulose, magnesium stearate.  
The tablet coating consists of h ydromellose, titanium dioxide, and polyethylene glycol. Tablets for 
clinical studiesare supplied in high-density polyethylene bottl es containing a desiccant and cotton; 
the bottles are heat-induction sealed with child-resistant caps . The recommended storage 
condition is 15°C - 25°C.  The t ablet descriptions are as follo ws:  
20 mg tablet - white to off-white, biconvex, round, film-coated  with “20” debossed on one side and 
“527” on the other side  50 mg tablet -white to off-white, biconvex, oval, film-coated with “50” debossed on one side and 
“528” on the other side  
70 mg tablet (commercial tablet) - is white to off-white, bicon vex, round, film-coated with “BMS” 
debossed on one side and “ 524” on the other side  
 The chemical name [CONTACT_767903] N-(2-Chloro-6-methylphenyl)- 2-[[6-[4-(2hydroxyethyl)-1-
pi[INVESTIGATOR_200270]]-2-methyl-4-pyrimidin yl]amino]-5-thiazolecarboxamid e, monohydrate. The molecular 
formula is C22H26ClN 7O2S • H2O. The formula weight for the monohydrate is 506.02 and for the 
anhydrous free base is 488.01. 
Dasatinib is a white to off-white powder, which may contain lumps, and has a melting point of 
280°C - 286°C. The drug substance is insoluble ([LOCATION_002] P harmacopeia [USP] definition) in 
water (0.008 mg/mL) at 24 ± 4° C. The pH of a saturated solution of dasatinib in water is about 
6.0. Two basic ionization constants (pKa) (6.8 and 3.1) and one weakly acidic pKa (10.8) were 
Protocol No. 2006-0478 
June 23, 2009 
 
31 determined. The solubility (USP definition) of dasatinib in var ious solvents at 24 ± 4°C are as 
follows: slightly soluble in et hanol (USP), methanol, polyethyl ene glycol 400, and propylene 
glycol; very slightly soluble in  acetone and acetonitrile, and practically insoluble in corn oil. 
 
Clinical experience in more t han 900 patients ha s identified se veral safety concerns with 
dasatinib.  There is a potential for myelosupre ssion (in additi on to that produced by [CONTACT_677471]), fluid retention, pleur al and pericardial effusion, QT c prolongation, skin rashes, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343], GI/CNS hemor rhage and tumor lysis syndrome.  Due to these events, patients 
are prohibited from taking anticoagulants or medications that i nhibit platelet function while on 
dasatinib therapy.  An exception to this may be the use of anag relide for CML patients with 
significantly elevated platelet counts.

9. ADVERSE EVENTS  
1. See Appendices A and E for gui delines for reporting ADR's. 
2. Adverse Events Requiring Expedi ted Reporting: Serious unexpe cted adverse events (SAEs) 
considered associated therapy should be reported to the Princip al 
Investigator [Farhad Ravandi, MD, Telephone (71 3) 745-0394 wit hin 48 hours of observing or 
learning of the event.  
3. Expected therapy-related event s include those known toxiciti es or side effects related to the 
components of the chemotherapy as indicated in the Guidelines for AE Reporting for Leukemia 
Phase 2/3 studies (Appendix E) . These grade 4 or less events will not be reported as individual 
SAEs, but will be summarized in t he annual report to the IRB: H yperglycemia Electrolyte 
abnormalities, changes in serum lactate dehydrogenase. Renal fa ilure related to tumor lysis 
syndrome, methotrexate, or antibio tic therapy (e.g, AmBisome, a minoglycosides) Cytarabine 
related central nervous system toxicity Catheter-related deep v enous thrombosis Coagulation

34 abnormalities during induction chemotherapy (e.g. chemical DIC or hypofibrinogenemia) lleus 
related to vincristine Hepatotox icity related to methotrexate Post lumbar puncture headaches 
All serious, unusual, life-threat ening, or lethal experience wh ich may be due to dasatinib drug 
toxicity will be reported within  [ADDRESS_1053026] medical treatment given  to a patient (e.g. treatment w ithdrawal during washout period, 
change in treatment to a fixed dose of concomitant medication. 
 
A serious AE  is any untoward medical oc currence that at any dose:   
results in death,  
is life-threatening (defined a s an event in which the patient w as at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an ev ent which hypothetically might  have caused death if it were more 
severe),  requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571954],  
results in persistent or signif icant disability/incapacity,  
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  results in the development of drug dependency or drug abuse,  
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and scientific 
judgment, may jeopardize the patient or may require interventio n (e.g., medical, surgical) to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definit ion above.)  Examples of such 
events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) For 
reporting purposes, also consider the occurrences of pregnancy or overdose (regardless 
of adverse outcome) as events which must be reported as importa nt medical events.  
 Adverse events classified as “s erious” require expeditious han dling and reporting to BMS 
to comply with regulatory requirements.  
 All serious AEs whether related or unrelated to investigational product, must be 
immediately reported to BMS (or designee) by [CONTACT_767901] e transmission.  If only 
Protocol No. 2006-[ADDRESS_1053027] be kept on file at the study site. 
 For studies that are IND Exem pt, any event that is both seriou s and unexpected must be 
reported to BMS as soon as possible and, in no event, later tha n 7 days (death or life-
threatening event) or 15 days (all other SAEs) after the investigator’s or instit ution’s initial 
receipt of the information.   
 All SAEs should be faxed to  Bristol-Myers Squibb at: 
Global Pharmacovigilance & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_34237]-Myers Squibb Company 
Fax Number:  [PHONE_188] 
 
 For studies conducted under an Investigator IND, any event tha t is both serious and 
unexpected must be reported to the FDA as soon as possible and, in no event, later than 
7 days (death or life-threatening event) or 15 days (all other SAEs) after the investigator’s 
or institution’s initial receipt of the information.  Bristol-M yers Squibb will be provided with 
a simultaneous copy via facsimile of all adverse events filed w ith the FDA.  SAEs should 
be reported on the MedWatch Form 3500A, or other institutional or group form. 
SAEs should be sent to the FDA at: 
MEDWATCH 
[ADDRESS_1053028] Rockville, MD  [ZIP_CODE] 
Fax:  1-800-FDA-0178 ([PHONE_176]) 
All SAEs should simultaneously be faxed to Bristol-Myers Squibb  at: 
Global Pharmacovigilance & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_34237]-Myers Squibb Company 
Fax Number:  [PHONE_188]  
 Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely important.  Full 
descriptions of each event w ill be followed by [CONTACT_20444]. Thus, follo w-up information which 
becomes available as the SAE evolves, as well as supporting doc umentation (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_219475]), should be co llected 
subsequently, if not available at the time of the initial repor t, and immediately sent 
using the same p rocedure as the in itial SAE report. 
 An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional ingest ion of any dose of a 
product that is considered both excessive and medically important.  For reporting 
Protocol No. 2006-0478 
June 23, 2009 
 
36 purposes, BMS considers an overdo se, regardless of adverse outc ome, as an 
important medical event (see Serious Adverse Events). 
 In BMS supported trials, all SAEs must be collected which occu r within 30 days of 
discontinuation of dosing or com pletion of the patient’s partic ipation in the study if the 
last scheduled visit occurs at a later time.  In addition, the Investigator should notify 
BMS of any SAE that may occur after this time period which they  believe to be 
certainly, probably or possibly related to investigational product. 
10. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY 
1. The major study objective is to evaluate the event-free survival after hyper-CVAD plus 
dasatinib and achieve a 2-year EFS rate > 60% (based on reporte d data from hyperCVAD plus 
imatinib)21. The study is expected to accrue 115 patients (previously untr eated, or after having 
received one or two prior cour se of chemotherapy, or relapsed) over approximately 2 years 
(referral pattern of 15 to 20 patients/year, accrual completed in 12 to 24 months), with an 
additional 12 months of follow-up. This will allow estimates of  CR rates and disease-free 
survivals. Disease-free survival  is the time from documented CR  until relapse or death. Event-free 
survival is the time from treat ment until any failure (resistan t disease, relapse, or death). The 
results will be compar ed descriptively to h istorical controls i n terms of response , survival, toxicity, 
etc. (recently published data). A  95% confidence interval width  will be approximately 11% for the 
CR rate estimated with [ADDRESS_1053029] equivalent to that observed on the previous hyper-CVAD  trial (26 CR of 29 patients). 
Observation of the following numbe r of responses or fewer per n umber of patients evaluated will 
be regarded as evidence for termination: 2/5, 6/10, 10/15, 14/2 0, 18/25, 21/30, 25/35, 29/40, 
33/45, 37/50, 41/55, 45/60, 49/65 , 53/70, 57/75, 61/80, 65/85, 69/90,73/95,77/100,81/105, 
85/110, or 89/115 on the basis tha t there is < 5% probability t hat efficacy is superior to that of 
hyper-CVAD. Using these guidelines, simulation results indicate  the following expected results for 
several values of CR rate:  
 
True rate of CR Probabilit y of early termination 
recommendation Expected median sample size 
(25%, 75%) 
0.6 >0.99 5 (5, 10) 
0.7 0.98 15 (10, 35) 
0.8 0.50 110 (20,115) 
0.85 0.16 115 (115, 115)  
0.9 0.03 115 (115, 115) 
0.95 0.01 115 (115, 115) 
  The molecular CR rate with hyper -CVAD is not known. Quantificat ion of bcr-abl will be measured 
prospectively and analyzed by  [CONTACT_9086]. 
 3. Hyper-CVAD alone has very low toxicity (<5%). In this combin ation trial, if the toxicity rate is 
too high (Pr[Toxicity rate > 5% |Data] > 0.9), then the trial will be stopped (toxicity is defined at the 
Protocol No. 2006-0478 
June 23, 2009 
 
37 beginning of this section). Spec ifically, the trial will be sto pped if the number of patients 
experiencing unacceptable (as defined in section 9.0) toxicitie s /total number of patients is greater 
than or equal to 2/5, 3/12, 4/24 , 5/37, 6/51, 7/65, 8/79, 9/100, or 10/109. The probability to stop 
the trial early is 0.02, 0.12, 0 .73, 0.98 or >0.99 when the tru e toxicity rate is 0.03, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 
or 0.20 respectively. 
  
4. A separate analysis will be carried out for previously treat ed patients (who have received one 
or two prior course of therapy) . The historical number of Philadelphia-positive patients presenting 
after failure of one course of chemotherapy is one of 204 patients (< 1%). The historical rate of 
patients who achieved a CR afte r one course of chemotherapy con tinuing on hyper-CVAD at 
MDACC is 4 of 208 patients (2%). None were Ph-positive. Thus, t he expected number of patients 
in this category is expected to be small. Patients who have fai led one course o f non-hyper-CVAD 
chemotherapy will be as sessed for CR rate (historical CR rate for ALL overall is 5 of 6 [83%]) and 
disease-free survival .  Patients presenting in CR will be assessed for disease-free survival and 
toxicity only.  5. A separate analysis will also be carried out fo r patients with relapsed disease, i.e. those with 
Ph-positive ALL or lymphoid blast phase of chronic  myeloid leuk emia who have failed (after 
achieving an initial response) prior therapy which does not inc lude dasatinib. It is expected that 
[ADDRESS_1053030] 20%, with failure due 
to lack of a suitable donor, age or performance status characteristics, comorbid conditions, or 
relapse of their disease prior  to planned transplant. Patients who successfully undergo allogeneic 
transplant will be censored for disease-free survival at the ti me of transplant. Those patients who 
successfully complete allogeneic  transplant prior to completion of the program will be replaced. 
 
10A. Data Confidentiality Plan  
Data from this clinical trial will be shared with which is a re trospective data analysis study.  
2006-0478 new testing will be undertaken on any specimen. (See Waiver of Inform ed Consent.)

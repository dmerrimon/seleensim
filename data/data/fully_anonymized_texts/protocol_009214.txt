subjects in single doses of 25  and 100  mg.  The mechanism of action of selective induction of 
apoptosis in chronically activated lymphocytes, the demonstration of efficacy in IBD models , 
and the safety, tolerability , and PK  profi le demonstrated in the Phase 1 program  supports the 
further of assessment of the efficacy LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC in inducing remission  in subjects  with 
active UC.

2.0 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background  
Inflammatory bowel diseases  such as ulcerative colitis ( UC), Crohn’s Disease ( CD), and 
nonspecific colitis are chronic autoimmune diseases with significant unmet medical need.  
Manifestati ons of the disease are unpredictable and can be progressive and, in certain cases, may 
result in life -threatening complications.  Current small molecule therapi[INVESTIGATOR_471260] 25% 
of UC and 50% of CD patients, respectively.1,2  All treatment options are associated with 
significant safety concerns, notably increased infectio n risk due to sustained immune 
suppression.3  New treatment options are needed as surgical resection of the bowel remains a 
necessary intervention for a substantial portion of patients even after the introductio n of biologic 
agents as treatments.  Since the introduction of newer agents (2003 -2011), the rates of surgery 
for patients with CD and UC have decreased, but remained at ~20% and ~8%, respectively.4  
Thus, there  is a need for novel oral treatment options that will result in  induction of remission as 
well as  maintenance of remission over long -term dosing, with a reduced risk for immune 
suppression.    
The rationale for assessing LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC starts with accumulatin g evidence  that lymphocytes 
adopt a specific metabolic phenotype that supports their particular effector function.  Thus, the 
energy required for normal lymphocyte activation is driven by [CONTACT_471283], whereas 
chronically  activated pathogenic lymphoc ytes make their adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
primarily via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) occurring in the mitochondria.5,6  Oxidative 
phosphorylation  is, in turn , dependent on the activity of the mitochondrial ATP synthase enzyme 
(F1F0-ATPase) that constitutes the final complex in the mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_471261].7,8  Modulation of the F 1F0-ATPase (ATPase) with small 
molecule allosteric agents such as LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  (ATPase modulators) has demonstrated increases 
in reactive oxygen species and hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, changes th at, 
together with other bioenergetic and redox abnormalities, result in apoptosis of susceptible cells.   
ATPase modulators, therefore, selectively deplete chronically activated pathogenic lymphocytes 
while sparing normal lymphocytic function based on the d istinct role of the ATPase in the 
differential metabolism of these lymphocyte subsets.   In agreement with this mechanism of 
action, ATPase modulators have demonstrated  efficacy in several preclinical rodent models of 
autoimmune disease (arthritis, lupus, p soriasis, graft -versus -host disease , and inflammatory 
bowel disease [ IBD]) with no effect on normal immune responses (no effect on primary or 
secondary responses in  murine T -Cell-Dependent Antibody Response and adoptive transfer 
immunization models).9,10,11,[ADDRESS_603874], with limited 
systemic exposure.   
In initial dosing in healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetic ( PK) profil e in single ascending  doses 
(SAD) was consistent with post -pyloric delivery (due to enteric coating) and the systemic 
exposures did not exceed 5 .1 ng/mL , which is 50-fold below the no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAEL) in the rat, the most sensitive spe cies.  In the multiple ascending dose (MAD; 100  and 
200 mg dose groups) part of the study, the time at which maximum observed plasma 
concentration (T max) (> 4 hours) was also consistent with colonic delivery.  Furthermore, after 
multiple dosing, the area u nder the concentration -time curve from time 0  to 24  hours ( AUC 0-24) 
in the 100  mg dose group increased from 25.4  ng·h/mL at Day  1 to 99.5  ng·h/mL on Day  7, and 
from 62.7 ng·h/mL at Day  1 to 173 ng·h/mL at Day  [ADDRESS_603875] 
indivi dual plasma concentration in the 200  mg dose group ( maximum plasma concentration 
[Cmax]:  21.4 ng/mL; AUC 0-24:  306 ng·h/mL) was still 10-fold below the NOAEL .  
In the Phase  1 study in UC  subjects , the AUC and C max were very similar to healthy volunteers 
following a single administration of a single dose of 25  mg.  At a dose of 100  mg, exposu res 
were higher in UC  subjects ; however , there were no safety findings and exp osures remained at 
least 20 -fold ( based on Cmax and AUC) below the lowest NOAEL in the rat  and monkey chronic 
toxicology studies.  
In summary, LYC -[ADDRESS_603876] doses tested 
in humans to date .  The mechanism of action of selective induction of apoptosis in chronically 
activated lymphocyt es, the demonstration of efficacy in IBD models and the safety, tolerability , 
and PK profile demonstrated in the Phase  1 program supports further study of the compound in 
humans with IBD.   
2.3 Nonclinical Studies  
2.3.1 Nonclinical Pharmacology  
LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  is an orall y administered small molecule for the treatment of IBD.  It functions as an 
allosteric modulator targeting the mitochondrial ATP synthase, also known as the F 1F0-ATPase.  
Compounds that modulate F 1F0-ATPase activity increase superoxide formation and mediat e 
apoptosis of susceptible cells via a well -characterized apoptotic signaling cascade.  Consistent 
with this mechanism of action, LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  slows the rate of ATP production in 
submitochondrial particles, increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation , and induces 
apoptosis in a lymphocyte cell line.  In addition, LYC -[ADDRESS_603877], colonic drug levels exceeded the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values in 
enzymatic and cellular assays.  These data suggest that efficacy was largely driven by [CONTACT_471284].    
2.3.2 Nonclinical Pharmacokinet ics 
LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  has low aqueous solubility and exhibits moderate apparent permeability in a Caco -2 
cell model.  Following administration of single oral doses of LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  as an emulsion in a 
lipid-based formulation, bioavailability is low to moderate in monk eys, mice , and rats 
(10%-38%).  Plasma LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  exposures were similar in normal and trinitrobenzene sulfonic 
acid (TNBS )-treated rats indicating that colitis did not alter the PK of the drug.  When 
administered as a powder blend in a n enteric -coated  capsule (the intended clinical formulation)  
to monkeys , the AUC 0-24 of LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC is approximately 10% of that achieved using a lipid -

based formulation.  In mouse, rat , and monkey, LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  exhibits low to moderate plasma 
clearance, low to moderate volume o f distribution , and a long terminal elimination half -life.  
Plasma protein binding is moderate in all species (13 %-18% free).    
LYC -[ADDRESS_603878] 
(LYC -[ZIP_CODE]) was observed  that appears to be formed non -enzymatically.  Conversion of 
LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  to LYC -[ZIP_CODE] also was observed in simulated gastric fluid, consistent with the 
compound’s known instability in the presence of acid.  LYC -[ADDRESS_603879] 
inhibitor  of human cytochrome P450 enzymes ( CYPs ) but may be a weak time -dependent 
inhibitor of CYP 2D6.  LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  is unlikely to be associated with significant drug -drug 
interactions.    
2.3.3 Safety Pharmacology and Toxicology  
LYC -[ZIP_CODE] is not genotoxic and does not pr oduce adverse central nervous system, pulmonary or 
cardiovascular effects in single dose safety pharmacology studies. In rats and monkeys dosed for 
up to 28 days with LYC -[ZIP_CODE], there was no evidence of generalized immune suppression.  
In the rat 28 -day goo d laboratory practice ( GLP ) toxicology study,  an AUC of ≥  5800  ng·h/mL  
was associated with sporadic instances of mortality.  In the rat 91 -day GLP tox icology study, the 
NOAEL was 10  mg/kg with a plasma AUC of 7750  ng·h/mL  (combined sex mean).  Since 
mortality was observed in previous studies at a low er AUC, the rat NOAEL across all studies 
was consider ed to be the mid dose in the 91 -day study of 3  mg/kg with a C max of 257  ng/mL and 
an AUC of 3060  ng·h/mL .  In the 26 -week chronic toxicology study, the NOAEL was also 
3 mg/kg and was associated with a me an steady state C max of 240  ng/mL and an AUC 0-24 of 
3000  ng·h/mL . 
Due to the mitochondrial mechanism of action of LYC -[ZIP_CODE], a  study was conducted to explore 
uncoupling as a potential cause of mortality in rat s at high plasma drug levels. As measured by 
[CONTACT_46146] , at doses ≥ 7 mg/kg, LYC -[ZIP_CODE] produced dose -related increases in oxygen 
consumption and body temperature consistent with mitochondrial uncoupling. At a tolerated 
dose, measurable and reversible increases were observed for both parameter s.   
In the 28-day GLP monkey toxicology study, an exposure of 6340 ng·h/mL in the male high 
dose group (30 mg/kg) was associated with dose -limiting emesis and diarrhea leading to 
euthanasia of the group following 16 -18 days of dosing. In surviving animals , complete recovery

from these clinical signs occurred following a reversal period of 28 to 38 days. The NOAEL in 
the 28 -day monkey study was 10  mg/kg/day associated with a n AUC of 4820  ng·h/mL  
(combined sex mean) .  In the 91 -day GLP toxicology study, the NOAEL was 10 mg/kg with an 
AUC of 2580  ng·h/mL . Likewise, in the 39 -week chronic toxicology study in monkeys, the 
NOAEL was 10 mg/kg and was associated with a mean C max of 281 ng/mL and a mean AUC 0-24 
of 2760  ng·h/mL.  
Comparing plasma drug levels at the NO AELs in the chronic rat and monkey toxicology studies 
to the efficacious exposure in a chronic TNBS -induced colitis model following an oral dose of 
0.3 mg/kg, exposure ratios are > 20 based on C max and > 50 based on AUC.

57 healthy male subjects were randomized in th e study, 34 subjects in the SAD component, 
16 subjects in the MAD component, and 7 subjects in the FE component. A total of 40 subjects 
received LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC treatment (SAD = 21, MAD = 12, FE = 7).   
A total of 52 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) w ere reported. All TEAEs were of 
mild severity. There were no deaths or SAEs reported and no discontinuations due to AEs in any 
components of the study. A total of 6 TEAEs were considered by [CONTACT_166680]. All of thes e TEAEs were reported in the SAD component of the study, of 
which 5 TEAEs were reported by 3 placebo subjects and 1 TEAE (flatulence) by a subject 
receiving a single dose of [ADDRESS_603881] to clinical laboratory, vital signs 
(including body temperature), ECGs, continuous cardiac monitoring, PE, respi[INVESTIGATOR_038], and 
tissue or pulse oximetry.  
In the SAD component of the study, the C max reached a plateau of 3 to 4 ng/mL at the 75  mg 
cohort ( at least  60-fold below NOAEL in rat, the most sensitive species) and the AUC began to 
plateau at the 150 -mg dose ( Table  1).  In the MAD component of the trial, the mean C max and 
AUC values were 10.3 ng/mL and 173 ng·h/mL  on Day 7 follo wing oral administration of 
200 mg (Table  2). The extent of accumulation following multiple dosing was 3 - to 4-fold.

Source: LYC -[ADDRESS_603883] sensitive species.  
The Phase  1b study  was an open -label , SAD study to evaluate the PK profile, safety, and 
tolerability in subjects with UC.  A total of 6 subjects received LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC treatment at either 
25 mg ( 3 subjects ) or 100 mg (3 subjects).  No AEs were reported for the study and exposures at 
the [ADDRESS_603884] 20 -fold ( based on Cmax and AUC) below the lowest NOAEL in rat and monkey 
chronic toxicology studies.  
Overall, oral administration of LYC -[ADDRESS_603885]. 
The increased exposures were not associated with any saf ety findings.  
Additional information is provided in the IB. 
2.5 Dose Selection Rationale  
The proposed dose to be studied in this Phase 2 proof of concept trial is 25 -mg daily oral dose.  
The rationale for this is based on the exposures required to demonstrate  efficacy in the chronic 
TNBS IBD model, and the safety margins for the both the fasted and fed states.  
From the SAD  study, a dose of 25  mg was associated with a  Cmax of 1.7 ng/mL and the AUC 0-72 
was 31.5 ng·h/mL.  Projection of steady -state exposure was b ased on the average accumulation 
observed following doses of 100  or 200  mg and using linear regression in relation to other doses 
studied.  Using these methods, the steady  state C max and AUC following daily doses of 25  mg are 
projected to be approximately 2 ng/mL and 40  ng·h/mL.   Both the C max and AUC values exceed 
the exposures achieved in the mouse chronic TNBS model at 0.03  mg/kg where C max was 
1 ng/mL and AUC 0-24  was ≤ 10 ng·h/mL.  Furthermore, the colon tissue concentration of the 
compound is predicted to be at least 13-fold higher than in plasma , which will ensure adequate 
exposures at the site of action: chronically activated lymphocytes in the lamina propria.   
The dose is also to ensure safety.  Subjects in this trial will be instructed to take study drug in the 
fasted state.   In the fasting state, the C max and AUC are projected to be >  100-fold below and 
> 70-fold below the rat NOAEL, respectively.  In the fed sta te, where there is significant ly 
increased systemic exposure, the mean plasma C max and AUC are projected to remain 10-fold 
below the NOAEL in the rat, the most sensitive species.   
Thus, the selection of [ADDRESS_603886] -in-human study described in Section  2.4, single doses of up to 
300 mg were proven to be safe and tolerable (in the SAD part of the study) and single -dose 
exposures observed with once -daily dosing for [ADDRESS_603887] 
of a high fat meal on absorption, observ ed in the FE component of the Phase  1 study, subjects  
will be instructed to take their study drug upon awakening  in the morning after fasting overnight.  
They should not eat until approximately 1 hour after taking study drug .  This will ensure that the 
systemic exposures are predictable and low.   
The colonoscopy/flexible sigmoidoscopy carries known risks including adverse reaction to the 
sedative , if used during the exam.   Other risks of the procedure itself may include perforation, 
bleeding or irritation o f the lumen of the colon.  These risks are very small, especially in the 
hands of experts performing the procedures.    
The benefits of the drug in subjects  with active UC are being evaluated  in this study , therefo re 
any benefit is theoretical.  There has n ot been an efficacy study yet .  The rationale to study this 
drug in subjects with UC  is based on the mechanism of action and preclinical animal models of 
IBD.

4.0 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Design Overview  
This study is a Phase  2 multicenter , multinationa l, randomized, double -blind, placeb o-controlled,  
parallel group study designed to evaluate the efficacy, PK, PD, safety , and tolerability of  
LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC in subjects with  UC.  Male and female adult subjects with a previous diagnosis 
of UC will be screened to determine eligibility as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see 
Section s 4.4.1  and 4.4.2 , respectively).  The screening period will be up to  28 days ( 4 weeks).    
There are [ADDRESS_603888] phase s of this study as outlined below:    
Screening :  The screening visit will take place up to 28 days (4 weeks)  prior to randomization 
and the subject’s first dose of study drug.  Screening will take place over multiple days to 
complete and obtain results for  all assessments.  Subjects who meet all eligibility requirements 
will return for the next phase of the study.    
Double -Blind Treatment Period :  Subjects meeting all entry criteria will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC 25 mg once daily [ q.d.] or placebo  q.d.  Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_471286] 50% of randomized 
subjects are biologic  naïve.  Subjects will receive their first dose of study drug  at the clinic  after 
randomization has occur red.  Subjects will return to the clinic  at Weeks  1, 2, 4, and 8 for efficacy 
assessments, safety monitoring and study drug  receipt.

Follow -Up:  There will be 1  follow -up visit performed at Week  10 for final safety monitoring 
purposes.   
All subjects wil l thus be followed for approximately 14 weeks, which includes up to  4 weeks  
between screening and Study Day  1 (first dose of study drug ), 8 weeks for treatment and 2 week s 
for follow -up.  Subjects will visit the clinic at Screening ( Days  -28 to -1), baseline (Day  1), 
Week  1 (Day  8), Week  2 (Day  15), Week  4 (Day  29), and Week  8 (Day  57) or at the Early 
Termination (ET) Visit.  In addition, a follow -up visit will be planned [ADDRESS_603889] 
administration of study drug (Week  10 [Day  71]).   
The assessme nts planned at each visit are detailed in the double -blind schedule of events  
(Table  3).   
After all subjects complete the Week  [ADDRESS_603890] , and the Sponsor  will remain blinded to 
treatment until after the database lock.    
Optional Open -Label Treatment :  An optional open -label extension study will be available to 
subjects under a separate protocol  to subjects who complete the double -blind trial. The open -
label extension will allow up to 44  weeks of treatment with LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC.     
4.2 Number of Subjects and Sites  
A total of approximately  120 subjects will be randomized i nto the study and treated at 
approximately 66 sites (refer to Section  8.1 for sample size estimation).    
4.[ADDRESS_603891]  Numbers  
Subjects will be assigned a 6-digit unique identification number sequentially as they sign t he 
informed consent document (ICD) and agree to participate in the study.  The first 3 numbers w ill 
identify the site number (eg , 200, 201, 202) and the  next 3 numbers will be assigned 
consecutively s tarting with “001” then “002.”   Subject  identification n umbers will be captured on 
the electronic  case report forms ( eCRFs ) and will serve as the primary method of identifying 
each subject  on the eCRFs and on the site’s source documents  throughout the study.  Each site 
will prepare and maintain a “Master List” of each subject  participating in the study.    
 
LYC -[ADDRESS_603892] identification number and randomization number will be assigned by [CONTACT_471287] -based  (IWRS) response system.   
Rescreening of subjects, who previously fa iled screening, may be allowed once after consultation 
and approval by [CONTACT_4530] .  Depending on the timing o f the rescreening, the subject may 
need to repeat certain screening assessments to confirm eligibility into the study.

Subjects will be encouraged to complete the study; however they may voluntarily withdraw at 
any point during the study without prejudice.  Lycera , or the designated contract research 
organization (CRO), must be not ified immediately if a randomized subject is withdrawn from the 
study, and every effort should be made to inform Lycera prior to withdrawing the subject.   
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:   
 screen failure:  subject does not meet entry criteria and was not randomized  
 occurrence of any AE  (if the subject withdraws due to an AE the investigator should follow 
the subject until the AE resolve or stabilizes) , concurrent illness, laboratory abnormalit y or 
other concern  which, in  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_471265], warrants the subject’s 
permanent withdrawal  
 subject noncompliance, defined as refusal or inability to adhere to the study schedule or 
procedures  
 at the request of the subject (withdraw consent)  
 at the reques t of the investigator , Lycera ( sponsor ), or regulatory authority(ies) for safety, 
behavioral, or administrative reasons   
 subject is lost to follow -up 
 If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_285927]/or t he subject’s family.  This effort must be clearly documented .  
 other (eg, subject moved)  
If a subject withdraws before completing Visit  6 (Week  8) every effort should be made to have 
the subject undergo final visit procedures (Visit  6/Week  8) in order to d ocument subject 
outcome, if possible.  The investigator  or site staff should inquire about the reason for 
withdrawal and follow -up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs.   The reason for the 
withdrawal will be documented in the source documents and in the appropriate eCRF.  If a 
 
LYC -[ADDRESS_603902] should be asked to also return 
for follow -up Visit  7/Week  [ADDRESS_603903] withdraws from the study, and withdraw s consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be 
collected.  Lycera may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of 
consent.

5.4 Maintaining and Breaking the Blind  
The 2 capsules developed for the trial (LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC 25 mg and placebo) are indistinguishable 
(identical in size, shap e, color and appearance ; all EC ) and are packaged identically.   
To minimize the potential for bias, treatment information will be kept confidential and will not 
be available for release to the investigator , site staff , and Lycera until after database  lock at the 
end of the double -blind study (Visit  7/Week  10).   
The study site will be instructed on the method for breaking the treatment blind prior to study 
start (ie, the actual treatment received by [CONTACT_423]).  The treatment blind is to be broken only 
in emergency situations when medical/supportive care cannot be provided without determining if 
the subject was treated with the study drug .  In the event that the treatment blind needs to be 
broken prior to the completion of the study, the investigator  must  contact [CONTACT_166682].  
The investigator  will explain and document in writing why the blind was broken, how the blind 
was broken, and how the integrity of the remaining blinded subjects was maintained.

and condition of the medication , review for appropriate language in the label , and acknowledge 
receipt and condition in the IWRS .  All study drug supplies will be stored in a locked and secure 
location accessible only to those authorized by [CONTACT_471289] .  The 
study drug supply will need to be stored under controlled room temperature conditions 
(15C-25°C/59F-77°F).  A detailed in ventory log of study drug received and dispensed will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_471290].   
The first dose of study drug will be taken while in the clinic under medical supervision.  
Subsequent dosing will take pla ce at the subject’s home  including on the days of study clinic 
visits  (unless otherwise specified in Section  6.0).  Subjects are to take their study drug dose in 
the morning upon awaking  after fasting overnight  and they should not eat for approximately 
1 hour after taking study drug .  Selected subjects who provide blood samples for PK analysis and 
LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  plasma concentration monitoring may be instructed to not take their study drug at 
home the morning of specified clinic visi t(s).  They instead will be asked to take their s tudy drug  
in the clinic.   During each study visit, the subject will receive a new medication  supply  
containing sufficient study drug for the period until the next visit .   
 
LYC -[ADDRESS_603908]’s electronic diary (see Section  6.3 for additional information).   
Subject compliance with taking study drug  will be assessed by [CONTACT_471291].  Subjects shoul d take study drug as directed by [CONTACT_471292][INVESTIGATOR_471267], unless they experience an adverse event (AE) and in this 
case they should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_26819].  The investigator  (or 
desig nee) must complete the appropriate eCRF pages to document the data.   
Subjects will return any unused study drug and empty bottles at each study visit and/or early  
discontinuation visit (if applicable).  Missed doses of study drug should be discussed to tr y to 
ascertain the reason(s).  Every effort should be made to ensure proper subject dosing.    
All unused study drug  and empty bottles will be returned to the study drug supplier/CRO depot 
as applicable at the closure of the study site or will be destroyed at the site, upon sponsor 
decision.    
5.6 Concomitant Medications

6.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Visit Timing  
The schedule of study assessments is described below  (Table  3); however, a subject  may be seen 
at any time for safety reasons .  Routine cli nic visits outlined in the protocol should occur 
whenever possible at the same time of day throughout the study to decrease variation in 
assessments and procedures.   It’s recommended that study visits be scheduled in the morning.  
Morning visits will be ne cessary for subjects who participate in the safety PK exposure 
monitoring or serial PK subs tudies (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Prior to each clinic 
visit, subject activities should remai n consiste nt with their normal routine (eg , meals, 
medications, caffeine ingestion).  Subjects should take prescribed and over -the-counter 
medications at the same time of the day throughout the study.    
 The day the subject  receives the first dose of study drug is considered Study Day  1.  The 
timing of all study visits should be based on Study Day  1.   
 Study visit  timing and windows are as follow s:   
 screening (Visit  1) – approximately Study Day -28 to Day  -1  
 randomization /treatment (Visit  2) – Study Day 1 
 Visit  3 (We ek 1 – Study Day  8) – window  ± 3 days  
 Visit  4 (Week  2 – Study Day  15) – window  ± 3 days  
 Visit  5 (Week  4 – Study Day  29) – window  ± 3 days  
 Visit  6 (Week  8 – Study Day  57) – window  ± 4 days  
 Follow -up (Visit 7) (Week  10 – Study Day  71) – window  ± [ADDRESS_603909] be documented on the eCRF .

s Telephone subject on Study Day 2 (the day following Visit  2) and again later during the week following Visit  [ADDRESS_603912] is compliant with taking study drug on an empty stomach (fasted overnight).  
 
LYC -[ADDRESS_603913]  has been completely informed 
of the details of the study including its nature, risks, and procedu res, and has signed and dated 
IRB/IEC -approved ICD.  A subject  who satisfies all eligibility criteria during the screening visit  
may proceed to the next visit.   
A labo ratory test (e g, alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ], aspar tate aminotransferase [ AST ], 
platelets) or procedure that does not meet eligibility criteria can be repeated once at the 
discretion of the investigator  in order to  determine eligibility.  A subject  who does not satisfy all 
entry requirements t hat can be assessed during the screening phase will require no further visits 
and will be identified as a screen failure in the source documents and eCRFs.   
Re-screening of su bjects initially not meeting all selection criteria may be allowed  once after 
consultation with the sponsor (eg, subjects infected with C. difficile  may be re -screened after 
completing treatment).    
Subject S creening will be divided over at least 2  days (all counted under Visit  1) with the 
recommendation that the easier  and less invasive  screening procedures be completed first to 
ensure subject meets these criteria prior to performing the more invasive endoscopy.  There will 
be at least 5 days between Part 1 and Part 2 (endoscopy visit)  of the screening visit in order for 
the subject to collect baseline rectal bleeding and stool frequency information for use in 
calculation of the Mayo score.  If a subject meets the first set of eligibility criteria assessed at the 
first screening day, an endoscopy will be performed to complete the assessment of the subject’s 
eligibility.   (Sites should follow the scheduling practice at their site to determine timing of 
schedul ing the endoscopy in order to complete the scre ening eligibility within the 28 -day 
screening period ). 
In the event that a potential study subject is already scheduled for a colonoscopy, it is acceptable 
to vary from the recommended screening procedure sequence and to consent the subject  at the 
time of the ir colonoscopy visit and complete the rest of the screening procedures after this time 
point.

demarcation at not higher than 5 cm below the  splenic flexure, then the Week  8 endoscopy can 
be a flexible sigmoidoscopy instead of a colon oscopy.  All endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_471270]’s s tandard practice  including bowel preparation .  The endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(either colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy) will be  performed at the site  and the  endoscopy 
video recording will be sent to the central reader for evaluat ion. The Mayo endoscopy subscore 
component will be assigned based on review by a central reader.  Central readers are experienced 
at reviewing and scoring endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_471271] -specific training  prior to their 
reading endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_471272] . This training will include e nsuring the ir understanding that the 
presence of “friability” is not considered consistent with remission and therefore , if present , the 
Mayo endoscopic subscore must be at least  2.  Additional d etails for performing and submitting 
endoscopy images for the central read will be described in a separate imaging manual.   
Based on these parameters, the subject’s Mayo score will be calculated.    
The TMS is a scoring system for the assessment of UC activity calculated based on  4 parameters  
(PGA , endoscopy  finding s, rectal bleeding , and stool frequency).  The MMS is calculated based 
on 3 parameters ( all aforementioned parameters apart from the  PGA).

 musculoskeletal  
 neurological examination to record the presence of abnormalities in mental status, motor, and 
sensory function (includes reflexes)  
 any additional assessments necessary to establish baseline status or evalu ate sy mptoms or 
adverse experiences  
Every effort should be made to have the same examiner perform each  physical exam  for a given 
subject  to minimize variability in the examinations.  Clinically  significant changes from 
screening  should be noted as AEs.  
6.5.[ADDRESS_603933] is app ropriate for study 
entry.  During the Screening period, site personnel may become aware of additional events  or 
procedures which should  be added to medical  or surgical  history.    
6.5.3 Vital Sign s Measurements  
Vital signs will be measured at the time points indicated in the schedule of events (Table  3).   
Vital sign s measurements consist of SBP, DBP , HR, RR, and T.  Subjec ts should sit qu ietly with 
feet flat on the floor or be supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (l ying down) for at least 5  minutes prior to measurements.    
 Subjec t must remain seated  or lying down  for the entire measurement.    
 The use of automated devices for measuring BP and HR is acceptable .  If done manually, HR 
must be measured in the brachial/radial artery for at least 30  seconds.   
 BP determinations must be performed using calibrated and appropriately maintained 
equipment and  the same equipment  should be used on the same subject  throughout the stud y 
as much as possible.    
 The same size BP cuff, which has been properly sized and calibrated, will be used to measure 
BP each time.   
 Subject’s arm must be at the same height (at the level of the heart) during each BP 
measurement.

A 12 -lead E CG will be conducted at the time points indicated in the schedule of events (Table  3).   
A standard 12-lead ECG will be performed  after [ADDRESS_603934] in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_166664] a 
standardized automated device.  The following  ECG parameters will be recorded  by [CONTACT_31390]: HR, PR-interval, QRS -duration , QT and QTc intervals , and the investigator ’s assessment of 
the ECG profile  (note that QTcF, the QT interval corrected for heart rate  according to 
Fredericia’s formula , will be programmatically calculated and the site does not need to calculate 
this value) .  Clinically significant changes from screening should be recorded as AEs.    
6.5.5 Laboratory Assessments  
Serum samples for laboratory assessments and urine samples for urinalysis  will be collected at 
the time points indicated in the schedule of events and be analyzed by a central laboratory  
(Table  3).  The details on the serum and urine sampling procedures will be described in a 
separate laboratory manual .   
The investigator  at the site must assess the clini cal significance of all  laboratory values  outside 
the laboratory reference ranges .  All laboratory abnormalities considered to be clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_471298].  Confirme d, clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities should be further evaluated by [CONTACT_471299].

The coagulation panel includes: prothrombin time (PT) , fibrinogen , and INR .   
Urine Sample  (Dipstick ) 
The u rinalysis test includes :  color, appearance, specific gravity, leukocyte esterase, pH, protein, 
glucose, ketones, blood, and nitrites.  Microscopic urinalysis will be performed on samples with 
abnormal blood, leukocyte esterase, protein, and nitr ite.  This test will  be evaluated by [CONTACT_471300] .   
Childbearing Potential Evaluation and Pregnancy Tests  
Serum  FSH in postmenopausal female subjects and a serum hCG (pregnancy test) in 
premenopausal females will be evaluated at the central lab oratory  at screening .  At Visits  2 
through  7, urine pregnancy tests will be performed in women of childbearing potential . 
Stool Sample  
Stool samples will be collected at the time points indicated in the schedule of events ( Table  3).  
These  samples will be analyzed for the presence of fecal calprotectin, a  marker of bowel 
inflammation.  Fecal calprotectin is being assessed as a secondary efficacy endpoint.  
Additionally, the screening stool sample will be evaluated for the presence of C. difficile  and 
enteric pathogens.    
6.5.6 Inflammation monitoring  
Subjects are to take their body temperature at the time points indicated in the schedule of events 
(Table  3) (ie, 4 and 8  hours after taking the study drug on Days  1-7).  The subject should 
complete their temperature reading in the electronic diary.    
If the subject’s temperature reading is > 101°F (or 38.3°C) they must call their investigator  and 
this should be recorded as an AE.   
If a subject calls with an elevated body tem perature, the subject is to present to the clinic and be 
evaluated for a possible bacterial or viral infection.  This assessment is to be completed per the 
investigator ’s best clinical judgment (eg , if there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a urinary tract infection, then the 
subject is to have a urinalysis performed; if the subject has signs and symptoms of a classic viral 
 
LYC -[ADDRESS_603935] can be treated symptomatically without being 
evaluated).   
If there are no signs or symptoms of infe ction, then the subject is to present to the clinic.  The 
study drug should be withheld and the subject should be evaluated for other sources of increased 
temperature  as medically indicated .  Study drug may be re -started if  study drug has been  
interrupted for no more than [ADDRESS_603936]  include those that may be related to LYC -[ZIP_CODE] ’s mechanism of action  of 
mitochondrial modulation  and those AEs which may indicate hepatotoxicity . Investigators 
should be particularly mindful of these AEs , which include vomiting, abdominal pain, elevated 
lactate, and abnormal liver function tests  indicative of possible hepatotoxicity  (AST, ALT, total 
bilirubin, ALP, LDH) . Guidance for monitoring for these AEs of special interest is outlined 
below:  
Vomiting or Abdominal Pain:  
If a s ubject exhibits repeated epi[INVESTIGATOR_471273]/or frequency they experience as part of their underlying UC, they must contact [CONTACT_471301] .  [It’s understood that subjects will experience these sympt oms as part of their UC.  
It is therefore very important to understand and document at screening the “normal” severity and 
frequency of these symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_423] ].  They should present to the clinic as 
soon as possible to be evaluated for p otential source of the symptom  and liver function testing 
should be performed .  The study medical monitor should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. If a source is not readily 
identified then study drug should be withheld and the subject should continue to be evaluated for 
the source and managed as medically indicated.  Study drug may be re -started if it has been 
interrupted for no more than [ADDRESS_603937] from the study.  
Monitoring Lactate and Liver Function : 
If a subject exhib its any of the following elevations , study drug should be withheld at least until 
evaluation of the subject :   
 ALT or AST >  [ADDRESS_603938]  
 ALT or AST >  [ADDRESS_603939] for m ore than 2  weeks  
 ALT or AST >  [ADDRESS_603940] and total bilirubin >  [ADDRESS_603941] (or INR >  1.5) 
 ALT or AST >  [ADDRESS_603942] with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (>  5%) 
 ALP >  1.[ADDRESS_603943]  
 Lactate ≥  3 mmol/L  
 LDH > [ADDRESS_603944] they stop taking 
study drug and  report to the clinic as soon as possible for evaluation  (do not wait for the next 
scheduled study visit) .  As dehydration and heavy physical exertion can cause elevations (eg, of 
blood lactate levels ), the clinical lab should be repeated  with the subject instructed to ensure 
hydration and avoid heavy physical activity .  The study medical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_471302].  If the elevation is confirmed by [CONTACT_471303], study drug must continue to be withheld .  Close 
observation of the subject should be initiated .  Repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubi n testing 
should be performed [ADDRESS_603945] is asymptomatic.  The investigator should obtain a detailed 
history of symptoms, prior or concurre nt diseases, concomitant drug use, alcohol use, 
recreational drug use, special diets, and exposure to environmental chemical agents.  Evaluation 
should be performed to rule out acute viral hepatitis types  A, B, C, D , and E; autoimmune or 
alcoholic hepatiti s; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract

disease. Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver function as appropriate (eg, INR, direct 
bilirubin).  Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consults.  If a source of the abnormal value 
is not readily identified the subject should continue to be evaluated for the source and managed 
as medically indicated.  Study drug may be re -started if study drug has been  interrupted for no 
more than 3  days and  the source of the abnormal value (s) is determined, or if upon repeating the 
clinical lab the value returns to normal , and in the clinical judgement of the investigator and 
study medical monitor it is safe for the subject to continue study drug.   If study drug cannot be 
ruled out as the cause of the abnormal value then study drug should be permanently 
discontinued.  Additionally, if study drug is interrupted for more than 3  days, then study drug 
should be permanently discontinued.  
6.6 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
6.6.1 Biological Samples  
Blood samples for plasma  PK analysis will be collected as outlined in the schedule of events and 
as specified  below.  Because PK results would unblind i nvestigators, this data will not be 
reported to sites or to Lycera during the double -blind portion of the tria l (except as noted in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Pharmacokinetic  Exposure Monitoring  Sub-study Sample Collection  
Up to [ADDRESS_603946] blood samples collected for determination of plasma 
concentrations of LYC -[ZIP_CODE] .  These samples will be collected at the following visits and time  
points:   
 Visit  3* (Week  1):  fasting pre-dose and [ADDRESS_603947] -dose  
 Visit  4 (Week  2):  4-[ADDRESS_603948] -dose 
 Visit  5 (Week  4):  4-[ADDRESS_603949] -dose 
 Visit  6* (Week  8):  fasting pre-dose and [ADDRESS_603950] -dose 
* Note that in preparation for Visit  [ADDRESS_603951] ( DSMB ) review.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serial Pharmacokinetic  Sub-study Sample Collection  
Up to 12 consenting  subjects will participate in a PK sub -study  to assess LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  plasma PK 
parameters  (and PK parameters of its metabolite) .  These subjects will have 5 serial blood 
samples collected at Visit  5 (Week  4).  Blood samples will be collected at:   
 Visit  5 (Week  4):  pre-dose (fasted)  and post -dose at 4, 6, 10, and 24 hours (window 
± 30 minutes at  each time point) .   
These subjects will take their study drug dose on the day of Visit  [ADDRESS_603952] the other study visit procedures performed.  Note: they 
should not eat for a pproximately [ADDRESS_603953] ing overnight and 
prior to taking their daily dose of study drug .  After the 24 -hour blood sa mple is collected , they 
will take their study drug dose and they w ill be able to eat after waiting approximately 1  hour 
after taking study drug.  These serial PK blood samples may be collected ± 30 minutes from the 
specified collection times.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Plasma  Phar macokinetic  Sample Collection  
All subject who are not participating in either the safety PK exposure monit oring sub -study 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) or the seri al PK sub -study (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) will ha ve a s ingle blood draw at 
Visit  5 (Week  4).  This sample will be assessed for plasma concentration of LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  and its 
metabolite.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Exploratory Colon Tissue Concentration  
In addition, colon tissue biopsies will be collected  to determine the tissue concentratio n of 
LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  and its metabolite and for exploratory PD assessments  (see Section  6.7).  These

tissue biopsies will be collected at screening and at Visit  6 (Week  8) from all subjects as part of 
the endoscopy procedures perform ed at these visits.  At screening tissue biopsies will be 
collected from segments in which disease is present, with [ADDRESS_603954] inflamed areas of 
inflammation (av oid ulcerated mucosa).  At Visit  6, [ADDRESS_603955] of the trial is optional and 
subjects may participate in this trial even if they don’t consent to have their biologic tissue used 
for the PD evaluation.  Evaluation of these exploratory PD biomarkers will aid in understanding 
the effects of LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  in subjects with active UC.  Because these are exploratory, the 
samples may be evaluated in batches by [CONTACT_471304].   
Biologic samples , including blood, stool, and colon biopsy tissue,  will be collected  at the  time 
points indicated  in the schedule of events  (Table  3).  Refer to Appendix  C for biomarker analyses 
that may be performed.  
Collection of approximately 12 mL of blood for exploratory PD assessments w ill be collected 
from consenting subjects as noted in the schedule of events (Table  3) at screening and at Visits  2, 
4, and 6.

Colon tissue biopsies will be collected  (required for study participation) as noted in the schedule 
of events (Table  3).  Colon biopsy tissue will used  to assess for LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  PK concentrations .  
If biopsy tissue is available after assessment of drug levels, this tissue may be used for assessing 
exploratory PD biomarkers.   
Stool  samples will be collected (required for study participation) as noted in the schedule of 
events (Table  3).  Stool will be used to assess for fecal calprotectin, an intestinal inflammatory 
marker.  Additionally, stool collected at  screening will be used to assess for enteric pathogens 
(for eligibility).  Stool remaining after these required evaluations may be used for PD 
assessments.   
6.7.2 PD Parameters  
Refer to Appendix  C for exploratory PD biomarker para meter analyses that may be p erformed.   
Serum from blood will be used to assess for inflammatory proteins; cells will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_471305] ; expression of small nucleotide polymorphism 
associated with UC will be assessed.   
Stool samples will be processed to determine the presence of inflammatory cytokines, and 
transcriptional profiling for immune cell signatures and taxonomic compo sition of subject 
microbiomes.   
Colon biopsy tissue  available after measurement of LYC -[ZIP_CODE]  tissue concentrations  will be 
processed to assess for inflammatory proteins, transcriptional profiling, and assessment of 
lymphocyte infiltration and metabolic re modeling.

7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SAFETY MONITORING  
7.1 Adverse Event  Definition  
Defined by 21  Code of Federal Regulation ( CFR ) 312.32(a) and consistent with International 
Council for  Harmoni sation ( ICH) E2A guidance, an AE means untoward medical occurrence 
assoc iated with the use  of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE can 
be any un favorable or unintended sign (eg,  an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment ab out causality.  E xamples of 
AEs include but are not limited to:    
 abnormal test findings  
 clinically significant symptoms and signs  
 changes in physical examination findings  
 hypersensitivity  
 progression /worsening of underlying disease  
Events related to the u nderlying disease (s), which  have not worsened in intensity (severity) or 
frequency since screening , are not AEs.   
7.2 Serious Adverse Events Definition  
Defined by 21CFR 312.32(a) and consistent with ICH E2A guidance, an AE is considered 
“serious” if, in the v iew of either the investigator  or Sponsor, it results in any of the following 
outcomes:   
 death  
 life threatening (ie , in the view of either the investigator  or sponsor , its occurrence places the 
subject  at immediate risk of death.   It does NOT include an e vent, that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death .) 
 in-subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_471274] -[ZIP_CODE]  
Clinical Protocol LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -2001  
Amendment 4, 05 June 2017  
 
Confidential and Proprietary   Page 63 of 91 
 persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life function s 
 congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 other medically significant events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above  (eg, an allergic bro nchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency ) 
7.[ADDRESS_603956]  will be questioned about AEs.  For all randomized subjects, AEs 
should be recorded on case report forms ( CRFs ) from the time the subject has signed informed 
consent.  For subjects not randomized, only SAEs and AEs leading to screen failure will be 
collected on the CRFs from the time the subject has signed informed consent.   
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAE , see Section  7.2 above .  If 
an SAE occurs, expedited reporting will follow lo cal and international regulations, as 
appropriate.   
AEs should be reported using concise  medical terminology on the CRF s.   
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive procedures  should not be reported as AEs.  However, the 
medical condition for which the proc edure was performed should be reported if it meets the 
definition of an AE  and procedure would be the treatment and recorded a s “action taken” of the 
AE.   
For all AEs, the i nvestigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
requiring i mmediate notification to Lycera  or its designated representative.  For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained to determine the causality of the AE .   
 
LYC -[ADDRESS_603957] s should be asked the following nonleading 
questions:  “How are you feeling?”  All AEs (serious and nonserious) reported by [CONTACT_471306]  a causal relationship  to the study drug  is 
suspected.  
Severity of AEs will  be graded according to N ational Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (N CI CTCAE ) v4.03.  
Adverse events that are not inc luded in the NCI CTCAE lists will be graded according to the 
NCI CTCAE general guideline for grades as follows:  
Grade 1  Mild, asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate, minimal, lo cal intervention, or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL), eg, 
preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing 
money.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically signif icant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL, eg, bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, 
taking medications, and not bedridden.  
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE  
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily a serious event.  For example, a headache may be severe ( interferes significantly with 
subject ’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria 
for SAE s, listed in Section  7.2.

7.5 Serious Adverse Event  Reporting  
All observed or volunteered SAE s regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship 
to the  study drug  will be reported as described below.    
If an SAE occurs, ICON Pharmacovigilance and Safety Services (PVSS) is to be notified within 
24 hours of  awareness of the event by [CONTACT_471307] .  The initial SAE report 
form should be completed and faxed to ICON PVSS using one of the following:  
North America : 
Email: icon -[EMAIL_7894]  
Facsimile: +1 -[PHONE_9856]  
Telephone: +1 -[PHONE_9857]  
Europe : 
Email: [EMAIL_9051]  
Facsimile: +44 (0)[PHONE_4976]  
In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life threatening , notification must be made immediately, 
irrespective of the extent of available AE information.   
This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previously forwarded 
SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure in  utero (EIU) cases.   
The i nvestigator should continue to report any significant follow -up information to ICON PVSS  
up to the poi nt of resolution.   
In the rare event that the i nvestigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an  SAE 
immediately (eg , if an outpatient trial subject  initially s eeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within 24  hours afte r learning of it and the document the time 
of his/her first awareness of the SAE.    
The study sponsor medical monitor will perform final medical review of SAEs.  Full details of 
the SAE processing and review procedures will be documented in a safety manage ment plan and 
medical monitoring plan .  Serious adverse events, including any deemed as suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) will be reported according to timeframes as per 
country regulatory guidance , including to [LOCATION_002] ( US) Food  and Drug Administration

(FDA ) within  15 calendar days of ICON PVSS notification and within 7  calendar days if the 
S[LOCATION_003]R is considered life threatening or resulted in death.   Non-S[LOCATION_003]R SAEs will be reported 
to country regulatory authorities annually as per  regulatory guidance.  
For all SAEs, the i nvestigator is obligated to pursue an d provide information to Lycera  or 
designee  in accordance with the timeframes  for reporting specified above.   In addition, an 
investig ator may be requested by [CONTACT_471308] s pecific additional follow -up infor mation in 
an expedited fashion.   In general, the SAE form will  include a description /narrative  of the event 
in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent 
determ ination of possi ble causality.  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as 
concomitant medications a nd illnesses must be provided.  In the case of a subject  death, a 
summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Lycera  or its 
designated representative.   Expedited safety reports on all unexpected SAEs that are at least 
possibly related to study procedures will be provided to the FDA .   
Subjec ts with unresolved previously reported SAEs, or new SAEs identified on the last 
sched uled visit, sho uld be followed by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator until the event s are satisfactorily resolved.  
Resolution means the subject  has returned to the  baseline state of health, the i nvestigator does 
not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE , or upon agreement with Lycera  or 
designee .   
7.[ADDRESS_603958] visit  and are

associated study procedur es (biopsies ), should be reported to Lycera  or designee .   
7.7 Exposure in Utero   
For investigational  products within clinical trials, an EIU occurs if:    
 A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant after receiving the  study drug  (eg, after Study 
Day 1).   
If any study subject  becomes pregnant during the ir participation in the study, the subject will 
stop study drug and withdraw from the study.  The investigator must submit  this information to 
Lycera  or designee on EI U Form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred

and within 24  hours of awareness of the pregnancy.  The information submitted should include 
the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to an induced termination o f 
pregnancy).   
Follow -up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all EIU re ports with an 
unknown outcome.  The i nvestigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or  until 
pregnancy termination (i e, induced a bortion) and then notify Ly cera or designee of the outcome.  
The i nvestigator will provide this information as a follow  up to the initial EIU Form.  The 
reasons(s) for an induced  abortion should be specified.  An EIU report is not created when an 
ectopic pregnancy report is received  since this pregnancy is not usually viable.   
If the pregnancy outcome meets the criteria for immedi ate classification as an SAE (ie , 
spontaneous  abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including resulting in an 
aborted fetus, still birth or neonatal death]),  the investigator should follow the procedures for 
reporting SAEs.   
In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be a ssessed at the time of birth (ie , 
no minimum  follow -up period of a presumably normal infant is required before an EIU Form can 
be completed).  The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by [CONTACT_4692], 
unless pre -abortion test findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly.   
Additional  information about pregnancy outcomes that  are classified as SAEs follows:    
 “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion.    
 All neonatal deaths that occur within 1  month of birth should be reported, without regards to 
causality as SAE s.  In addition, any infant death afte r 1 month that the i nvestigator assesses 
as possibly related to the in  utero exposure to the investigational medication should be 
reported.    
7.8 Relationship/ Causality of Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events  
The i nvestigator’s assessment of causality must be provi ded for all AEs (serious and non serious).  
The causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that 
the study drug  itself (eg , LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC or placebo ) caused or contributed to an AE.   
If the final determination of causality is unknown and the i nvestigator  does not know whether the 
study drug  caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to  study drug ” for 
 
LYC -[ZIP_CODE]

reporting purposes.   If the i nvestigator’s causality assessment is “unknown , but not related t o 
study drug ”, this should be clearly documented on study records.   
Relationship of an AE to  the study drug  will be assessed as follows:  
Unrelated [Not Related or Unlikely Related] :  There is not a temporal or causal relationship to 
the study drug .  If th e AE is “unrelated” to the study drug , the investigator  must assess whether 
the event is thought to be related to the disease under study, concomitant medication, 
exacerbation of pre -existing condition, other illness, or unknown.    
Related  [Definite ]:  There is reason to conclude that the  study drug caused the AE.   
Suspected  [Possible or Probable ]:  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
the study drug and the AE.

lightheadedness or faintness, or any symptom that the investigator deems for cause.   Subjects  
should repor t these symptoms to the investigator  immediately  and return to the clinic as soon as 
possible for evaluation including an ECG.  Subjects will discontinue study drug if marked 
QT/QTc prolongation of > 500 ms or >  60 ms over bas eline is present  (a repeat ECG  should be 
performed within 24 hours to confirm the QT/QTc prolongation).  
7.12.[ADDRESS_603964] experiences a drug -related AE that meets Grade 4 
or 5 CTCAE (version  4.0) criteria or if [ADDRESS_603965].  
The study will be suspended if 50% of subjects experience clinically important drug-related AEs 
with a determined intensity of CTCAE Grade 2.  The clinical data must be unblinded and 
reviewed by [CONTACT_471310].    
8.0 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PLAN  
8.1 Sample Size Rationale  
A total of approximately  120 subjects will be randomized into the study  and using a 
1:1 randomization ratio of  LYC -[ZIP_CODE] -EC 25 mg or placebo .   
A sample size of 60 subjects per group will achieve approximately an 88% power to detect 
superiority  in the remission ra te of the active treatment group compared to the placebo treatment 
group.   The placebo treatment group remission rate is assumed to be 6.7%.  The power was 
computed for the case when the actual treatment group remission rate is 25% for a delta of 
18.33%.  The test st atistic used is the one -sided Z  test (pooled).  The alpha level of the test was 
targeted at 0.05.  Additionally, a sample size of 54  subjects per group excluding drop outs will 
achieve approximately a 78% power to detect non -inferiority in the re mission rate of the active 
treatment group compared to the placebo treatment group where the placebo treatment group 
remission rate is assumed to be 7.41% and the actual treatment group remission rate is 25.92% 
for a delta of 18.51%.    
Assuming a dropout r ate of 10%, the study will enroll [ADDRESS_603966] s.  For summaries/listings where treatment 
group is included, subjects will be included in the treat ment group to which they were actually 
treated .  All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Set.

include that Mayo endoscopic score of  0 or 1 
cannot include any degree of “friability” as 
this is not consistent with remission;   Clarification to align with FDA guidance that 
endosco pic finding of friability is not 
consistent with Mayo endoscopy subscores of 
“0” or “1.” Also revised to clarify that central 
readers will receive study -specific training and 
will use endoscopy videos for their review and 
assessment of endoscopy subscores.  
   Section 6.4.1 revised to clarify that stool 
frequency and rectal bleeding data for Mayo 
scoring will be obtained from the diary 
completed by [CONTACT_748]. Also clarified that  
the average stool frequency and average rectal 
bleeding score will be calcul ated from the 
individual 3  consecutive days will be used for 
the Mayo score;   Revised to specify that the Mayo score will be 
calculated using the stool frequency and rectal 
bleeding subscores obtained from patients 
through their daily diary entries.  
   Section 6.5.7 revised to state that study drug 
will be withheld in subjects who exhibit any 
of the listed lab elevations in liver biochemical 
parameters and lactate;   Revised per FDA request.

Document  Version Date  Description of Change  Rationale  
Amendment 4  05 June 2017   Section 4.4.1 Inclusion criteria #5 revised to 
allow inclusion of subjects on concomitant 
thiopurine UC treatment and to allow subjects 
on no UC treatment .  Section 4.4.1 IC # 5:  
In recruiting the trial, it has been learn ed that 
some patients are either intolerant of or 
frustrated with current first line UC therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
Thus, this change allows for the fact that 
patients may be on a baseline first line 
therapy; but does not require it.   Therefore, 
those patients who were in tolerant of or 
resistant to 5 -ASA or steroid products and 
those with poorly controlled UC will be 
eligible for the trial. Safety dat a from the 
Phase 2 study, completed Phase 1 studies and 
preclinical data support the use of LYC -
[ZIP_CODE] -EC without concomitant  UC treatment.   
It was also learned that many patients are 
symptomatic despi[INVESTIGATOR_471280] 
6-mercaptopurine. Sa fety data from this Phase 
2 study , previously completed Phase 1 studies  
and preclinical data de monstrates no evidence 
of immune supp ression with the study drug . 
Additionally, the completed in vitro  
interaction studies (cyps, transporters) 
demonstrate that there is little chance for 
interaction with 5 -ASA products, 
corticosteroids and az athioprine or 
mercaptopurine  based upon the very l ow 
systemic exposures achieved (C max of 
approximately 0.004 µM following a single 25 
mg dose).

 Summary of Changes  
Document  Version Date  Description of Change  Rationale  
   Section 4.4.1 Inclusion criteria #6 revised to 
include thiopurine .  Section 4.4.1 IC #6 revised in conjunction 
with the revision of IC #5 . 
   Section 4.4.2 Exc lusion criteria #7 revised to 
remove reference to thiopurines and to reduce 
the washout of other immunomodulatory 
medications to 4 weeks prior to the screening 
endoscopy .  Section 4.4.2 EC #7 – This revision will allow 
sufficient time for washout of 
immunos uppressant medications without 
making it onerous for patients to be off UC 
treatments.  The new timing is supported by 
[CONTACT_471325] 2 study, completed 
Phase 1 studies and preclinical data which 
demonstrate no evidence of immune 
suppression w ith the study drug .  It also 
considers that the time from screening to 
randomization is ~2 -4 weeks . 
   Section 4.4.2 Exclusion criteria #10 removed 
(history of uveitis) .  Section 4.4.2 EC #10 – This criterion removed 
because comorbid uveitis is not a safety  
concern  with respect to the study drug 
mechanism and therefore subjects with uveitis 
may be included in the trial . 
   Section 4.4.2 Exclusion criteria #12 revised to 
allow subjects with a history of cancer that is 
in remission for  [ADDRESS_603988] 
5 years unless approved by [CONTACT_185242].   Section 4.4.2 EC #[ADDRESS_603989] 5  years are excluded 
unless approved by [CONTACT_471326] , its treatment  and clinical 
course .

   Section 4.4.2 Exclusion criteria #19 revised to 
allow use of rectal 5 -ASA medications.  
  Section 4.4.2 EC #19 – This criterion revised 
because rectal 5 -ASA pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics are similar to those of oral 
5-ASA medications.  
   Section 5.6 revised to allow concomitant use 
of a stable dose of thiopurines.  
 Section 6.2.6 revised to  specify that the Visit 6

therefore allowance is made in case fewer than 
20 subjects consent to participate.  
   Secti on [IP_ADDRESS] , Table 3 footnote and 
Appendix B  revised to specify that up to 
12 subjects will participate in the serial PK 
sub-study.   Section [IP_ADDRESS] serial PK sub -study 
participation is optional for sites and subjects; 
therefore, allowance is made in case fe wer 
than 12  subjects consent to participate.  
   Section 7.12 revised to specify that a repeat 
ECG should be performed if QT/QTc 
prolongation stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_471281].   Section 7.[ADDRESS_603990] a 2nd ECG to

Title of study: Incidence probability of progression to progressive fibrosing interstitial lung 
diseases and status of management and treatments in patients with fibrosing interstitial lung diseases other than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
in Japan
Rationale and 
background:While idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the best-known progressive 
fibrosing interstitial lung disease (PF-ILD), there is a group of patients with 
different underlying clinical interstitial lung disease (ILD) diagnoses other 
than IPF who develop a progressive fibrosing phenotype during the course 
of their disease.
There is minimal literature available to estimate the proportion of patients 
who develop PF-ILDs in patients with fibrosing ILD other than IPF and, the 
current management and treatment for these diseases are not well-known 
in Japan. 
These information are keys to gaining a better understanding of the size of 
this population with high unmet need and for physicians, patients and other 
stakeholders to optimize allocation of resources, diagnostic assessment 
and management of this patient population.
Research 
question and objectives:PRIMARY OBJECTIVE 
To investigate the incidence probability of progression to PF-ILDs in 
patients with fibrosing ILD other than IPF in real-world setting in Japan
SECONDARY OBJECTIVE
To investigate the characteristics of procedures for management and 
treatment in patients with fibrosing ILD other than IPF in real-world setting 
in Japan
Study design: This is a retrospective cohort study using the database from Medical Data 
Vision (MDV).
Data from 01-Jan-2012 to 28-May-2020 will be used. It will be considered 
that each patient is observable from his/her first encounter to his/her last 
encounter in the database. The patients with fibrosing ILD will be identified 
in the period from 01-Jan-2013 to 6 months before 28-May-2020. Each 
patient who meets all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria 
will be followed up from the day after the index date until the end of study 
period (i.e., 28-May-2020), the last encounter in the MDV database, in-
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39473], whichever occurs first.
Population: Patients who meet all of the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the 
exclusion criteria will be included in the study population.
Inclusion Criteria:
1) Patients diagnosed with at least two fibrosing ILD codes on different 
dates in the patient identification period from 01-Jan-2013 to 6
months before 28-May-2020  
2) Patients aged 18 years and older on the index date  
3) Patients for whom data for the 12 months prior to the index date can 
be extracted as baseline data
Exclusion Criteria:
1) Patients grouped into the underlying disease of IPF
2) Patients who have met PF-ILD progression criteria during the 
baseline period 
Note: only diagnosis records without ‘suspect flag’ are to be considered for 
evaluating diagnosis related in/excl criteria”
Variables: The following information will be extracted from MDV database in this 
study; sex, age, comorbidity and medical history of interest, Underlying 
disease (pre-specified ILD), clinical examination, treatment and
management of interest
Data sources: The MDV database consists of anonymized administrative claims and 
Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) data for inpatient and outpatient 
settings from acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (mainly considered as advanced treatment 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]). The database includes >35 million patients from >[ADDRESS_168602] free access to health care facilities and data from 
the other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147368].
Study size: The planned sample size is not based on the formal statistical hypothesis 
testing and statistical precision. Because the MDV database consists of 
>35 million patients, it is expected that the sufficient number of non-IPF fibrosing ILD patients will be included in the study.
Data analysis: Primary outcome 
Incidence probability of progression to PF-ILDs at 6, 12, 18, and [ADDRESS_168603] during
follow-up period will be analyzed descriptively.

7. RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND
The term interstitial lung disease (ILD) encompasses a large group of over 200 
pulmonary disorders. While idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the best-known progressive fibrosing ILD (PF-ILD), there is a group of patients with different underlying clinical ILD diagnoses other than IPF who develop a progressive fibrosing phenotype during the course of their disease (e.g., idiopathic interstitial pneumonias [IIPs] such as  idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia [iNSIP] and unclassifiable IIP; hypersensitivity pneumonitis [HP]; autoimmune interstitial lung disease [connective tissue disease-ILDs(CTD-ILD) such as rheum atoid arthritis-ILD (R A-ILD), systemic scleros is-ILD (SSc-ILD) and 
anti-synthetase syndrome]; Sarcoidosis; Pneumoconiosis/exposure related ILD) [P17-[ZIP_CODE], P18-[ZIP_CODE], P19-[ZIP_CODE], R19-0854]. These patients demonstrate a number of similarities to patients with IPF, with their disease being defined by [CONTACT_147385], worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], declining lung function despi[INVESTIGATOR_147369], ultimately, early mortality.
Although there had been no indicated therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147370] a progressive phenotype (other than IPF), Nintedanib has just been approved for SSc-ILD in the end of Dec. 2019 based on the results of the SENSCIS trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) [P19-[ZIP_CODE]] and for PF-ILDs in the end of May 2020 in Japan based on the results of the INBUILD trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) [P19-[ZIP_CODE], P20-[ZIP_CODE]]. 
There is minimal literature available to estimate the proportion of patients who 
develop PF-ILDs in patients with fibrosing ILD other than IPF in Japan. In addition, the current management and treatment for these diseases are not well-known. These information are keys to gaining a better understanding of the size of this population with high unmet need and for physicians, patients and other stakeholders to optimize allocation of resources, diagnostic assessment and management of this patient population.
Therefore, this study will use the databas e from Medical Data Vision (MDV) to 
investigate the incidence probability of progression to PF-ILDs according to each co-existing underlying diseases and the characteristics of procedures for management and treatment in patients with fibrosing ILD other than IPF.

9.4 DATA SOURCES
The MDV database consists of anonymized administrative claims and DPC data for inpatient 
and outpatient settings from acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (mainly considered as advanced treatment hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]). At present, the database includes >35 million patients from >[ADDRESS_168606] free access to health care  facilities and data from the other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147371].
9.5 STUDY SIZE
The planned sample size is not based on the formal statistical hypothesis testing and 
statistical precision. Becaus e the MDV database consists of >35 million patients, it is 
expected that the sufficient number of non- IPF fibrosing ILD patients will be included in the 
study. 
9.6 DATA MANAGEMENTThe anonymised data received from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147372]. The database Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) received from MDV will be 
used.The analyses will be performed usin g Instant Health Data (IHD) platform, SAS statistical

These will also be analysed in patients with pr ogression to PF-ILD and those without 
progression to PF-ILD respectively. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary outcome- Incidence probability of progression to PF-ILDs at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the 
index date
Cumulative incidence probability of progression to PF-ILD at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after 
the index date will be estimated by [CONTACT_147386]-Meier method. Greenwood’s variance estimate will be used for calculating 95% confi dence interval. Kaplan-M eier curve will also 
be displayed.
Of the patients with progression to PF-ILD, frequency of patients meeting each criteria of 
progression to PF-ILD will be analysed descriptively. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary outcomes

Frequency of patients with management a nd treatment during follow-up period will be 
analyzed.
9.7.3 Subgroup analysis
The three subgroup analyses by [CONTACT_147387] 12-months lookback period as described in Annex 5 will be performed for 
patient background characteristics and treatment, primary outcome, and secondary outcomes.
<Subgroup Patterns>
Underlying Autoimmune Disease (Subgroup1): Autoimmune ILD, Non-autoimmune ILD, Multiple, Unknown 
ILD Category (Subgroup 2): Hypersensitive pneumonitis, Exposure-related ILD, iNSIP, 
Unclassifiable IIP, Sarcoidosis, RA-ILD, SSc-ILD, MCTD-ILD, Other autoimmune ILD, Other ILD, Multiple, Unknown

PM/DM-ILD, Sjogren ILD, Other autoimmune ILD, Other ILD, Multiple, Unknown
9.7.4 Sensitivity analysis
1) The end of data extraction period will be changed from 28-Ma y-[ADDRESS_168608] data 
cut off. OFEV was approved for PF-ILD on 29-May-2020, and the characteristics of claims data before and after the above approval for new indications might not be different. To increase the sample size, all the analyses will be repeated with this data extraction period.
2) The index date will be c hanged from the date of the second  code of fibrosing ILD to the 
date of the first code of fibrosing ILD because there might be patients who are asked to visit hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147373]. All the analyses will be repeated with this index date. 
In addition, all the analyses will be repeated with both data extraction period and index 
date changed.
After exploring the proxy patterns among patients meeting the criteria of progression to 
PF-ILD as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], a sensitivity analysis with modified progression criteria might be performed.  
9.[ADDRESS_168609] been no 
evidence on the validated algorithm to define fibrosing ILD patients other than IPF and progression to PF-ILD as events by [CONTACT_147388]. Therefore, the estimated incidence
in this study might be biased and the sensitivity analysis by [CONTACT_147389].

ANNEX 5.  ALGORITHMS FOR DEFINING UDERLYING DISEASES
The following three subgroups will be defined to assess the distribution of  underlying diseases and 
to perform subgroup analysis by [CONTACT_147392]. 
Subgroup1: Autoimmune ILD, Non-auto immune ILD, Multiple, Unknown, IPF#
Subgroup2: Hypersensitive pneumonitis , Exposure-related ILD, iNSIP, Unclassifiable IIP, 
Sarcoidosis, RA-ILD, SSc-ILD, MCTD-ILD, Ot her autoimmune ILD, Other ILD, Multiple, 
Unknown, IPF#
Subgroup3: Hypersensitive pneumonitis , Exposure-related ILD, iNSIP, Unclassifiable IIP, 
Sarcoidosis, RA-ILD, SSc-ILD, MCTD-ILD, SLE-ILD, PM/DM-ILD, Sjogren ILD, Other 
autoimmune ILD, Other ILD, Multiple, Unknown, IPF#
#Note: Patients grouped into IPF are excluded from study population according to the exclusion 
criteria.
The patients will be grouped according to the following three steps. 
Step 1: Patients will be gr ouped based on the fibrosing-IL D code on the index date 
If two or more different (1) disease codes specified in th is step [ADDRESS_168615] on index date 
,then  subgroup1=subgorup2=subgrou3=Multiple 
else if  disease code on index date=8844510, then  Subrgoup1=Autoimmune ILD, subgroup2=SSc-
ILD, subgroup3=SSc-ILDelse if disease code on index date=8847737, then subgroup1=Autoimmune ILD, subgroup2=RA-
ILD, subgorup3=RA-ILDelse if disease code on index date=8848382, then  subrgoup1=Autoimmune ILD, subgroup2=Other 
autoimmune ILD, subgroup3=Other autoimmune ILD else if  disease code on inde x date=in(8848278, 8836513, 8844341), then  subgroup1=Autoimmune 
ILD, subgroup2=Other autoimmune ILD. Subgroup3=SLE-ILD
else if  disease code on index date=in(8848267, 8848302, 8839362, 8848283, 8837013), then 
subgroup1=Autoimmune ILD, subgroup2=Other autoimmune ILD, subgroup3=PM/DM ILD else if  disease code on index date=8834158, then  subgroup1=Autoimmune ILD, subgroup2=Other 
autoimmune ILD, subgroup3=Sjogren ILD 
(1)Note: The disease codes in the same conditional statement are NOT considered different. For 
example, disease codes of 8848278 and 8836513 are in the same conditional statement and these are 
not considered different disease codes. On  the other hand, disease codes of 8848278 and 8848267 
are in the different conditional statement and these are considered different disease codes.
Step 2: Patients not grouped in the step [ADDRESS_168616] underlying disease 
code in the lookback period and fibr osing-ILD code on the index date 
else if  two or more different (2) earliest underlying disease codes sp ecified in this step [ADDRESS_168617] AND 
disease code on index date=in(J84.1, J84.9), then  subgroup1=subgorup2=subgrou3=Multiple

2.  BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
 2.1 Overview  
Human fatty acid synthase (FASN) is the sole cytosolic enzyme responsible for de novo synthesis of palmitate (1 -3). It has seven catalytic domains ( β-ketoacyl synthase, 
malonyl/acetyltransferase, dehydrogenase, enoyl reductase, β-ketoacyl reductase, acyl 
carrier protein, and thioesterase) and synthesizes palmitate by [CONTACT_164930] -CoA and 
malonyl-CoA (1). Breast cancers with high levels of FASN are much more likely to recur and metastasize with significantly shorter disease fr ee and overall survival (2- 5). FASN 
induces resistance to multiple anticancer drugs including doxorubicin and cisplatin (6-8). The typi[INVESTIGATOR_164902], thus, it s expression is very low in normal cells except lactating 
breast, cycling endometrium, and fatty tissues. In contrast, breast cancer cells require de 
novo fatty acid synthesis for survival. Inhibition of FASN induces apoptosis selectively in cancer cells b oth in vitro  and in vivo  (9-12) with minimal effect on normal cells (6, 13, 14). 
Thus, FASN drives breast cancer survival and is an ideal therapeutic target. In this application, we will target FAS N to stop breast cancer growth. 
 Having identified FASN as an important therapeutic target, we began searching for an 
inhibitor. In preliminary studies, we found that the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) effectively inhibit FASN, reduce breast cancer cell survival, and restore sensitivity to chemotherapy (15). PPIs a re FDA -approved for treatment of a variety of acid -related diseases that plague 
the digestive system, are widely used, and are well tolerated without major adverse effects (16-18). Interestingly, a recent retrospective study in head and neck cancer patients reported 
an increased overall survival associated with PPI [CONTACT_3225] (19). Chinese investigators reported intriguing results of a phase II trial of intermittent high dose esomeprazole in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin in patients with metastatic brea st cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 20). 
Median PFS was 7.5 months in the control group compared to 9.5 months in PPI [INVESTIGATOR_164903] (p=0.030); impact as greatest in the subset of patients with triple negative disease

Version 04 /03/2020 Page 7 (n=17, 3.3 vs. 9.5 months, p=0.014). Though smal l, the results of this trial are consistent 
with our hypothesis and support further exploration. Thus, we hypothesize that the PPIs may 
be repositioned as safe and effective drugs to augment the effect of chemotherapy without 
adding significantly to the co st or toxicity of therapy . 
 2.[ADDRESS_191220] cancer cells. While comparing protein 
profiles between the parental MCF7 and its doxorubicin- selected and resistant derivative 
MCF7/AdVp3000 (M3K) cells, we found a 270-kDa protein with increased expression in the drug resistant M3K cells ( Fig. 1A). This protein was identified to be human FASN by 
[CONTACT_153536] -TOF mass spectrometry. Functional analysis showed that FASN activity was 
dramatically (5 fold) up -regulated in M3K cells (Fig. 1B).  FASN up -regulation in M3K cells 
was validated using Western blot anal ysis ( Fig. 1C). During the stepwise selection of M3K 
cells, cell lines (e.g. , M10 and M100) with low and intermediate doxorubicin resistance 
levels were also generated (21-23). Interestingly, these cells also showed increased FASN 
level but to a less exten t than M3K cells (Fig. 1C).  
 FASN over -expression causes resistance to multiple DNA-damaging agents. To investigate 
whether FASN up -regulation contributes to drug resistance in M3K cells, we first performed 
stable FASN knockdown using shRNA and tested cellular response to doxorubicin and mitoxantrone. As shown in Fig. 2A-B, FASN knockdown significantly reduced resistance of M3K cells to both doxorubicin and mitoxantrone. We next performed the reverse experiment to over- express ectopic FASN in the parental MCF7 cells. A stable MCF7 clone 
with FASN over -expression (FASN) was generated, and as predicted, it was significantly 
more resistant to doxorubicin and mitoxantrone than the cont rol Vec 
clone (Fig. 2C- D). The FASN-
mediated doxorubicin resistance

was also dramatically reduced using the known FASN inhibitor, orlistat (Fig. 2E). FASN 
over-expression also significantly increased resistance to etopside, cisplatin, and ionizing radiatio n (IR) but had no effect on cellular response to paclitaxel and vinblastine [data not 
shown but see (7)]. Thus, FASN up- regulation likely causes resistance to DNA -damaging 
therapy but not anti-mitotic drugs. To ensure that the impact of FASN was not unique to MCF -[ADDRESS_191222] 
cancer cell line, MDA -MB-468. Fig. 3A shows effective knockdown of FASN and Fig. 3B 
shows that FASN knockdown is accompanied by [CONTACT_164933] e 
to both doxorubicin and mitoxantrone. Similar results were observed with MDA- MB-231 
cells (data not shown). 
 
FASN silencing does not increase chemo- sensitivity in non -malignant cells. We had 
hypothesized that non-malignant cells would be less dependent on FASN expression, and thus would not be a ffected by [CONTACT_164934]. To test this hypothesis we performed a 
similar knockdown experiment using human mammary epi[INVESTIGATOR_164904]10A1. Fig. 3A shows effective FASN knockdown in MCF10A1 cells. However, FASN knockdown had no significant effect on cellular response to doxorubicin or mitoxantrone in MCF10A1 cells (Fig. 3C).

Version 04 /03/[ADDRESS_191223] performed in-silico screening of a library of 2,417 FDA-approved drugs 
using DOCK programs and the 
crystal structure of FASN TE (ID: 3TJM) (24).  The 200 top- scoring 
compounds were clustered based on their chemical structure and 25 representative drugs from different clusters were tested using the 4- MUH fluorogenic 
assay. We found that one of these drugs, pantoprazole, dose-dependently inhibited FA SN TE 
activity (Fig. 4 A) with a Ki of 4.1 
μM (Table 1). Interestingly, the remaining drugs in the cluster containing pantoprazole were other PPIs including omeprazole, lansoprazole and rabeprazole. As shown in Fig. 4A and Table 1, all these PPIs similarly inhibited TE in a dose-dependent manner with Ki values of 3.4-5.9 μM 
and an activity ranking of omeprazole>pantoprazole>lansoprazole>rabeprazole. Hence, PPIs 
are effective FASN TE inhibitors. Analysis of the structure and activity of PPIs suggests that the size of either [ADDRESS_191224] the ability 
of PPIs to inhibit FASN TE.  We also performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of  each PPI [INVESTIGATOR_164905] 
(ΔGbind) using Poisson Boltzman surface area (PBSA) analyses . Table [ADDRESS_191225] ΔGbind, similar to the ranking of their experimental Ki’s. Fig. [ADDRESS_191226] favorable ΔGbind and Ki, shows potential formation of a strong hydrogen bond between serine residue (Ser2308) of the catalytic triad of TE and the sulfoxide moiety of omeprazole, which may prevent Ser2308 from nucleophilically attacking a substrate with an ester moiety. The hydrophobic benzamidazole moiety  of PPIs may interact with residues of the “specificity channel,” which is predicted to 
accommodate the growing  carbon chain dur ing fatty acid synthesis (30),  and may block 
access of the carbon chain to the channel. These findings provide theoretical support for PPI [INVESTIGATOR_164906].

Version 04 /03/2020 Page 10 PPIs inhibit and bind to cellular FASN. To determine if PPIs inhibit cellular FASN, we 
performed FASN activity assay in the absence or presence of PPIs using MCF7 cell lysate as 
we prev iously described (6, 7). Fig. 5A shows that 10 μM PPIs reduce >75% while 50 μM 
reduces >95% FASN activity. To investigate if PPI [INVESTIGATOR_164907], we performed a probe binding displacement experiment using the ActivX 
Desthiobiotin -fluorophosphonate (FP) serine hydrolase probe, which covalently binds to the 
Ser residue in the catalytic triad of serine hydrolases such as FASN TE ( 25). For this 
experiment, we tested lansoprazole. Briefly, cell lysate was incubated with the FP probe in 
the absence or presence of different concentrations of lansoprazole and subjected to Western blot analysis probed with streptavidin  
conjugated HRP. 
As shown in Fig. 5B, lansoprazole 
inhibited FP probe labeling of FASN in a dose-
dependent manner. However, it had no effect on the binding of the FP probe to other Ser hydrolases, suggesting that lansoprazole selectively inhibits FASN TE. Lansoprazole also had no effect on the total FASN level (Fig. 5 C).  
 
PPIs inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation and sensitize doxorubicin resistance. To determine if PPIs have any anti -breast cancer activity, we performed a 
colony formation assay using the TNBC cell line MDA- MB-231 in the absence or presence of PPIs. All 
PPIs effectively inhibited proliferation of MDA -MB-
231 cells with IC50 of 5.6-12.2 μM (Fig. 6). Omeprazole appears to be the most effective with an 
IC50 of 5.[ADDRESS_191227] effective in inhibiting FASN TE activity (Table 1) . Importantly the IC50 is near the plasma 
concentration (Cmax=4.2 µM and AUC=9.7 µM·h) achieved in pat ients (40 mg dose). Furthermore, PPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_164908] a dose dependent manner (data not shown). Next, we tested the drug-resistant M3K cells using lansoprazole, which has the highest IC50 at 12.2 μM for MDA- MB-231 cells with the idea that if lansoprazole is effective, the other PPIs may be 
better. We found that M3K cells are more resistant to lansoprazole with a higher IC50 of ~37 μM (Fig. 7A) than its IC50 of 12.2 μM in MDA- MB-231 cells, presumably due to high 
FASN level in M3K cells. Howev er, lansoprazole at 5 μM, which causes <10% cell death

Version 04 /03/2020 Page 11 (Fig. 7A), was able to reduce the doxorubicin IC50 from 46 to 28 nM in M3K cells (Fig. 
7B). Further study of lansoprazole-doxorubicin combination using the combination assay as 
described previously (26) showed that lansoprazole and doxorubicin have a synergistic 
effect on M3K cells with combination index around 0.3-0.7 (Fig. 7C). These findings suggest that PPIs not only have independent anticancer activity but also sensitize resistant breast cancer cells to doxorubicin.  
 
 
 2.[ADDRESS_191228] cancer patients use PPIs  for management of concurrent gastrointestinal reflux 
or ulcer disease. Thus, we performed a preliminary retrospective analysis  of de -identified 
electronic medical records  (EMR) of 6,[ADDRESS_191229] cancer patients from Indiana Network for 
Patient Care (INPC). The average age at  diagnosis was 58.9 years (range 19-102) and 
average age at death or last visit is 61.5 (range 21-104). Of this  cohort, the EMR 
documented PPI [INVESTIGATOR_164909] [ADDRESS_191230] cancer (TNBC) patients, among them [ADDRESS_191231] cancer patients 
who took PPIs had significantly increased overall survival than patients who did not (Fig. 8A). Analysis of the TNBC subgroup showed that PPI [INVESTIGATOR_164910] (Fig. 8 B). The protective effect of PPIs on patient survival was 
adjusted for age, tumor stage, and time of first diagnosis.

Version 04 /03/[ADDRESS_191233] conservation, but also allows determination of in 
vivo sensitivity to therapy and offers an ideal platform for clinical research. Although many 
will experience shrinkage in tumor volume with neoadjuvant therapy, at the time of surgery only about ~35% of patients with triple negative disease will experience a pathologic complete response (pCR), indicating the absence of invasive tumor tissue in the surgical specimen. Long -term follow-up of neoadjuvant studies consistently demonstrates 
significantly improved survival in individuals with pCR, with comparatively inferior outcomes in those with residual disease at surgery (27 -29).  
 We propose a single arm phase II trial of omeprazo le + standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
as an obligate first step toward the definitive trial we envision. This study will provide 
safety, pharmacokinetic, biologic, and preliminary efficacy data that is needed for marshal support of an adequately designed,  definitive randomized trial.

7. TREATMENT PLAN  
 7.1 Overview  
Patients should begin therapy within 7 working days of study entry. Patients will be treated with omeprazole 80 mg orally BID beginning 4-7 days prior to chemotherapy and continuing until surgery. After the brief period of omeprazole monotherapy, patients will

Version 04 /03/[ADDRESS_191238] neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) and 
cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) for 4 cycles followed by [CONTACT_114461] (80 mg/m2) weekly x 12.  
 
Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide ( AC) may be administered on a classical every 3 week 
or dose dense every 2 week (with growth factor support) schedule at the treating physician’s 
discretion. Routine incorporation of carboplatin is not recommended, however use of carboplatin (AUC 6 on week 1, 4, 7, and 10) with paclitaxel is allowed at the treating investigator ’s discretion. Chemotherapy will be adjusted based on toxicity according to 
standard treatment guidelines.  Additional details regarding neoadjuvant chemotherapy can 
be found in Sections 7.[ADDRESS_191239]’s weight changes by  
> 10% during the course of the study, the body surface area and drug dose should be 
recalculated .
 7.2 Omeprazole  
Omeprazole 80 mg orally BID beginning 4-7 days prior to chemotherapy and continuing 
throughout chemotherapy until surgery. Omeprazole should be discontinued the night prior to surgery. 
 
NOTE : Omeprazole inhibits CYP2C19. Patients taking drugs known to be substrates of 
CYP2C19 (Appendix IV ) may enroll but the treating investigator should be aware of the 
potential drug interaction. When possible, changing to an alternative agent that is not metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C19 is advised.

Version 04 /03/2020 Page 18  7.5 Management of D isease P rogression  
Frank disease progression during neoadjuvant chemotherapy is unusual. In the event of disease 
progression, the treatment plan s hould be modified as follows: 
• Locally progressive disease at any point during AC - defer remaining cycles of AC and 
begin treatment with paclitaxel (+ carboplatin if desired) according to the original treatment 
plan. 
• Locally progressive disease at any point during paclitaxel - defer remaining cycles of 
paclitaxel , perform required completion of chemotherapy evaluation and refer for definitive 
surgery. 
• Systemic disease progression - any patient who develops evidence of metastatic disease will 
be removed from study. 
 7.[ADDRESS_191240] Surgery and Management of the Axilla  
At the completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients will undergo definitive surgical resection. Decisions regarding the type of surgery (breast conserving surgery, unilateral or bilateral mastectomy), management of the axillary lymph nodes, and incorporation of reconstruction will be according to the patient’s preference and treating surgeon’s recommendation. Similarly , the use of post-surgery radiation therapy and additional adjuvant 
systemic therapy are at the treating investigator’s discretion and are not specified by [CONTACT_3181].   
When appropriate and desired, patients may enroll in other studies addressing important 
local therapy and post-neoadjuvant s ystemic therapy questions .  
 
8. TOXICITIES TO BE MONITORED/DOSAGE MODIFICATIONS  
All toxicities should be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(version 4.0). 
If a patient develops multiple toxicities, delay treatment or modify  dose based on the greatest indicated 
dose reduction or delay. Dose re -escalations are not allowed.  
 8.1 Omeprazole  
No dose modification of omeprazole is planned during this study. If patients are unable to take 
omeprazole for more than 14 consecutive days, they should come off the study.  
 
Omeprazole should be discontinued for any of the following: 
• Acute interstitial nephritis  
• Osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  
• Vitamin B -12 deficiency  
• Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea  
• Grade 3 hypomagnesemia  
• Any other grade 3 or greater toxicity thought to be related to omeprazole

• All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care will be given throughout the 
study.  
• Pegfilgrastim or filgrastim are recommended  after each AC treatment (cycle 1 -4) for patien ts 
receiving dose dense AC . Otherwise, hematologic growth factors are not required but may be 
used in acco rdance with the ASCO guidelines.

Version 04 /03/2020 Page 26 10. CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION/REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
 10.1 Definitions Associated with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) version 1.1 
10.1.1 Measurable disease - At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized 
measurable or non -measurable as follows:  
 
10.1.2 Measurable  
Tumor lesions  –will be measured using any of the following methods of measurement: 
 
• Chest X -ray: Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as m easurable lesions when they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT scans are 
preferable.  
 
• Clinical Lesions : For superficial non -nodal lesions, physical examination is 
acceptable, but imaging is preferable, if both can be done. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_164943], 
including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
 
• Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be 
used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety  for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator 
dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 Malignant lymph nodes : 
To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_191250] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be 
no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short  axis will be measured 
and followed.   
 
10.1.3 Non-measurable  
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly non- measurable lesions.  
Lesions considered truly non- measurable include:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/ abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_87415]. 
 
10.1.4 Baseline documentation of “Target” and “Non -Target” l esions  
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative 
 
 
Version 04 /03/2020 Page 27 of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and 
measured at baseline.  This means if a patient has only one or two organ sites involved, a maximum of two and four lesions, respectively, will be recorded.    Target les ions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter), be representative of all involved organs and should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.   [IP_ADDRESS] Lymph nodes Pathological nodes which are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥ [ADDRESS_191251] in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal). The smaller of these me asures is the short 
axis. For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20mm·x 30mm has a short axis of 20mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20mm should be recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥ 10 but < 15 mm) should be considered non- target lesions. Nodes that 
have a short axis <10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.   [IP_ADDRESS] Sum of Diameters A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters .  As noted 
above, if lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The basel ine sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any 
objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.   All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as non- target l esions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements 
are not required and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’.  In addition, it is possible to record multiple non- target 
lesions invol ving the same organ as a single item on the case report form (e.g. , ‘multiple 
enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).  
 10.2 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Response  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have 
reduction in short axis to < 10 mm)  
Partial Response (PR)  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters  
 
 
Version 04 /03/2020 Page 28 Stable Disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest 
sum diameters while on study.  
Progressive Disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study  (this 
includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). 
In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate a
n absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
NOTE: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression.  
 
  
 
 
Version 04 /03/2020 Page 29 10.2.1 Special notes on assessment of target lesions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Lymph nodes: Target lesion lymph nodes should always have the short a xis measurement recorded 
(measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline exam), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm.  Thus, when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph 
node is defined as having a short axis < [ADDRESS_191252] achieve a short axis <10mm. For PR, SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’: All lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g. , 2 
mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes become so faint on scan that the radiologist may report them as ‘too small to measure’.  
When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned (derived from 5 mm slice thickness).  Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequent ly surrounded by [CONTACT_40911]; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well. However, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measurement, it should be recorded even if it is below 5 mm.   [IP_ADDRESS] Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment: When non-nodal lesion ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separ able, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance 
should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.  
 10.3 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
Response  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in 
size (< 10 mm short axis)  
Non-CR/ Non -PD Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
Progressive Disease 
(PD)  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions  
  
 
 
Version 04 /03/2020 Page 30 10.3.1 Special notes on assessment of progression of non- target disease  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] When the patient also has measurable disease  
In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non- target 
disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non- target disease such 
that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has 
increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to quality for unequivocal progression status. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely 
rare. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] When the patient has only non-measurable disease  
This circumstance arises in some phase III trials when it is not a criterion of study entry 
to have measurable disease. The same general concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non- measurable disease burden. Because wors ening in 
non-target disease cannot be easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]: if all lesions are truly non -
measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be 
required to declare PD for measurable disease: i.e. , an increase in tumor burden 
representing an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in lymphangitic disease from localised to widespread, or may be described in protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non-measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it  impossible to do so, 
therefore the increase must be substantial.  
 10.4 New  Lesions  
There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: i.e., not attributable to dif ferences in 
scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre- existing lesions). This is particularly important when the patient’s 
baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.  A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.   If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow- up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm 
 
 
Version 04 /03/[ADDRESS_191253] response recorded from the start of t he treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient’s best overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both target and non- target disease and will also 
take into consideration the appearance of new lesions.

  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having  “symptomatic deterioration”.  Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish resid ual disease from normal 
tissue.  When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) to confirm the complete response status. 
 10.6 Criteria  for Removal from S tudy  
Patients will be removed from study under any of the following conditions: 
• When removal from study is thought to be in the best interest of the patient by [CONTACT_164944]’s treating physician.  
• Unacceptable toxicity in the judgem ent of the patient or patient’ s treating physician.  
• Pregnancy or failure to practice appropriate contraception.  
• Patient ’s request.  
• Evidence of systemic metastatic disease.  
• Inability to take omeprazole for 14 continuous days. 
 
 
 
Version 04 /03/2020 Page 32 11. DRUG INFORMATION 
 11.1 Drug Name  
[CONTACT_164970]  
 11.2 Other Names  
 PRILOSEC  
 11.3 Classification  
Proton pump inhibitor 
 11.4 Mode of Action  
Omeprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted 
benzimidazoles, that suppress gastric acid secretion by [CONTACT_164945] H+/K+ 
ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the gastric mucosa, omeprazole has been characterized as a gastric acid -pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the 
final step of acid production. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. Animal studies indicate that after rapid disappearance from plasma, omepr azole can be found within the gastric 
mucosa for a day or more. 
 11.5 Storage and Stability 
Store omeprazole ( PRILOSEC ) Delayed -Release Capsules  in a tight container protected 
from light and moisture. Store between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F). 
 11.6 Metabolism  
Omeprazole is extensively metabolized by [CONTACT_35233] P450 (CYP) enzyme system.  
 11.7 Dosage Forms and Strengths 
Delayed -Release Capsules: 10 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg 
Delayed -Release Oral Suspension: 2.5 mg or 10 mg 
 11.8 Administration  
Patients will be instructed to take two 40 mg capsules (80 mg) twice daily. Capsules 
should not be chewed or crushed. Missed doses should not be made up.   Patients will begin taking the omeprazole 4 -7 days before chemotherapy , and will 
continue taking the medication  throughout chemotherapy until surgery (up to 8 months).  
 11.9 Availability   
This study will be conducted in compliance with 21 CFR 312.7 (promotion and charging for investigational drugs). Omeprazole will be obtained, stored, and dispensed by [CONTACT_164946] (IDS) . Patients will be instructed to bring their 
bottles with unused omeprazole back to the clinic. After pi[INVESTIGATOR_164917] 04 /03/[ADDRESS_191254] common adverse reactions reported in adults (incidence > 2%) are 
headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and flatulence. 
 The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of 
PRILOSE C Delayed -Release Capsules. Because these reactions are voluntarily 
reported from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their actual frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.  
• Body As a Whole: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, interstitial nephritis, uticaria , (see also Skin 
below); fever; pain; fatigue; malaise

elevated b lood pressure, peripheral edema 
• Endocrine: Gynecomastia 
• Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis (some fatal), anorexia, irritable colon, fecal 
discoloration, esophageal candidiasis, mucosal atrophy of the tongue, stomatitis, 
abdominal swelling, dry mouth, microscopic colitis.  During treatment with omeprazole, gastric fundic gland polyps have been noted rarely.  These polyps are 
benign and appear to be reversible when treatment is discontinued.  
• Gastroduodenal carcinoids have been reported in patients with ZE syndrome on 
long- term treatment with PRILOSEC.  This finding is believed to be a 
manifestation of the underlying condition, which is known to be associated with 
such tumors.

 11.[ADDRESS_191255] milk was less than 7% of the peak serum concentration. This concentration would correspond to 0.004 mg of omeprazole in 200 mL of milk. Because omeprazole is excreted in human milk, because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from omeprazol e, 
and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for omeprazole in rat carcinogenicity studies , patients who are nursing are not eligible for this trial. 
 Omeprazole inhibits CYP2C19. Patients taking drugs known to be substrates of CYP2C19 (Appendi x IV) may enroll but the treating investigator and nursing staff should 
be aware of the potential drug interaction.  
12. STATISTICAL METHODS  
 12.1 General Considerations  
Statistical analysis of this study will be the responsibility of the Biostatistics and Data 
Management Core at the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center (IUSCC). Parameter estimates and relevant summary statistics will be reported where appropriate. For continuous variables, summary statistics will include number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. Categorical endpoints will be summarized using number of subjects, frequency, and percentages. Missing data will not be imputed. Data analysis will be performed in SAS Version 9.4.  Additional explor atory analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate. Changes from 
this analysis plan will not require an amendment to the protocol unless it changes a significant feature of the protocol. 
The statistical analysis methods are outline below.  
 12.2 Study Design  
This is a single arm Phase II study  of omeprazole + standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
as an obligate first step toward a definitive trial. 
 12.[ADDRESS_191256] anthracycline/taxane therapy, we estimate a pCR rate of ~40%. Assuming that 70% of 
 
 
Version 04 /03/[ADDRESS_191257] a pCR rate of 60% with power = 80% and alpha=0.10  requires 30 FASN 
patients (or 42 patients total). This sample size also provides approximately 80% power to identify a change in FASN expression and/or activity of 0.[ADDRESS_191258] 
and significance level of 0.05. Patients who are inevaluable for the primary endpoint will be considered non-responders and will not be replaced.  
 12.5 Patient Characteristics  
Demographics, medical history, and physical examination characteristi cs will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics.  
 12.6 Disposition  
Frequencies and percentages of all patients enrolled, discontinuing the study, and completing the study will be presented. The reasons for discontinuation will also be summarized.  
 12.7 Analysis of Primary Objectives  
For estimating pCR rate , a 95% exact confidence interval will be calculated . 
 12.8 Analysis of Secondary Objectives  
For number of patients expressing FASN  in tumor, a proportion and 95% confidence 
interval will be reported.    
 For estimating pCR rate  in all patients, 95% exact confidence intervals will be calculated . 
 
For safety, NCI CTC Version 4.[ADDRESS_191259] neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy.  S ummaries of treatment related adverse events in the population will be 
tabulated. All adverse events (A Es) will be presented in incidence tables coded by [CONTACT_164947]. An adverse event will be considered treatment related if it occurred on or after date of first dose of omeprazole, and was possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment. 
All adverse events will be recorded until off study date. All deaths recoded in this study will be listed and summarized, and the cause docum ented.  
 For FASN expressors, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum 
FASN expression and activit y in tumor will be calculated. To see how high dose 
omeprazole impacts biologic activity, c hanges in FASN expression and activity, FASN 
downstream target gene expression (e.g., PARP1 and SP1), and lipid levels from baseline to after 4 -7 days on omeprazole treatment and at time of surgery will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_79365].  In addition, linear mixed models will be used to assess the 
association of FASN expression with BMI. 
 12.9 Analysi s of Tertiary Objectives  
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, 95% confidence intervals) will be use to summarize omeprazole exposure.  
 
 
Version 04 /03/2020 Page 36 Peak omeprazole concentration  will be compared to peak based on pre- clinical testing in 
a purely qualitative  manner.  
 
Pharmacokinetics -Pharmacodynamic (PK -PD) modeling of omeprazole drug exposure, 
FASN target activity  (represented by [CONTACT_164948] ), and c linical outcome will be 
conducted. A system of PK -PD models will be developed to quantify and predict the 
clinical outcome, i.e. , pCR, based on drug exposure and target levels. The omeprazole 
pharmacokinetic model will be constructed using the sparse sampling nonlinear mixed effect model, which account for the last dosing time information. The omeprazole-
FASN /lipid PK -PD will be constructed using the nonlinear mixed effect with time -
dependent covariates model  (30) . Finally, the correlations between PK (omeprazole) 
and/or PD (lipid/FASN) and pCR will be evaluated through Cox proportional hazard model with covariates measured in error. The PK and PK-PD modeling will be conducted in NONMEM, while the Cox model will be conducted in SAS.  Change in  lipid levels from baseline to after 4 -7 days on omeprazole treatment and at 
time of surgery will also be assessed separately by [CONTACT_79365].  
 12.10 Interim Analysis  
No interim analyses are planned for this study. 
 12.11 Subgroup Analysis  
Additional subgroup analysis may be performed as deemed appropriated.  
13. SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS  
 13.1 Tumor Biopsy Requirements  
Core biopsy samples will be obtained at baseline, after 4-7 days of omeprazole treatment, and in residual disease at surgery. At each time point, 3 core samples should be obtained. Please refer to the Study Procedure Manual for detailed processing instructions for each core.   
 
IU Site: S ubjects are required to have a fresh biopsy at baseline to obtain the 3 core 
samples below . 
 
Non-IU Sites: Archived tissue from a previously performed diagnostic biopsy may be 
used to obtain the 3 cores listed below at baseline. If adequate tissue from an archived sample is unavailable, subjects will be required to undergo a biopsy at baseline. 
 
• Core 1 – To be tested for FASN and downstream target gene expression  
• Core 2  – To be tested for FASN activity  
• Core 3  – To be tested for NE FA analyses  
 
13.1.1 FASN expression

13.1.3 FASN activity  
We will evaluate FASN activity in core biopsy samples obtained at baseline, after 4 -7 
days of omeprazole treatment, and in residual disease at surgery. FASN activity will be determined using coupled enzymatic NDAPH oxidation assay as we previously described (3, 4). Based on our preliminary data we expect omeprazole will inhibit FASN activity 
and we will see a difference in FASN activity between pre- and post- treatment samples.

Version 04 /03/2020 Page 39 15. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 15.1 Data Safety Monitoring Committee 
The Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  of the Indiana University Simon Cancer 
Center (IUSCC) is responsible for patient safety and privacy protection, compliance with 
required reporting, and study integrity for all trials conducted at IUSCC. Members are subject matter experts from multiple dis ciplines including medical oncology, pediatrics, 
biostatistics, behavioral oncology, radiation oncology, urology, surgery, gynecologic oncology, data and project management and research administration who are appointed by [CONTACT_14222]. The DSMC will provide independent oversight of the clinical trial so that study integrity is assured. However, the DSMC is not serving as a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for this study. The DSMC will meet per the currently approved DSMP, led by [CONTACT_164951], and will review all adverse events, monitoring and auditing reports, unanticipated problems and study non-compliance events that require expedited reporting.  Meeti ng minutes will be maintained 
in the IUSCC Clinical Trials Office (CTO). Specifically the DSMC has the following responsibilities:  
• Assessment of the adequacy of trial -specific Data Monitoring and Safety Plan 
(DSMP) of  establish risk based monitoring dete rmination of trial specific DSMB.  
• Review safety data for investigator initiated trials including all adverse events, unanticipated problems and study non- compliance events requiring expedited 
reporting.  
• Conduct routine study monitoring and auditing in compliance with the IUSCC data quality control review process.  
 
 15.2 Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
This trial will comply with the current requirements of the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Plan (DSMP) of the IUSCC.  The CTO of the IUSCC will be the Coordinating Center for this multicenter phase II trial.  
In accordance with the DSMP of the IUSCC, Investigators will conduct continuous 
review of data and patient safety. Monthly  review meetings for moderate risk trials are 
required and will include the principal investigator, clinical research specialist and/or research nurse (other members per principal inves tigator’s discretion). Monthly meeting 
summaries should include the number of patients, significant toxicities as described in the protocol, dose adjustments, responses observed, eligibility of patients enrolled at each site, serious adverse events (SAEs) or unanticipated problems (UPs) (both IUSCC and 
those reported from other institutions), dose adjustments, and protocol deviations.  Meeting minutes will be submitted and reviewed by [CONTACT_164952] [EMAIL_3325]. 
In addition, conference calls  with investigators and staff at participating sites will be 
scheduled at least monthly (and more often as needed) to discuss study progress. If there 
are no patients on treatment or in follow -up, email communication will be used in lieu of a 
teleconference.

monthly and reviewed by [CONTACT_85281]/or coordinator monthly. Findings will be reported to the full DSMC at the time of study review.  
  
16.2.3 Reporting Death  
Death will be reported per local IRB reporting guidelines (Section 5.8 of the Unanticipated Problems and Noncompliance SOP).  
 16.2.4 Study Accrual Oversight  
Accrual data will be entered into the IU  Simon Cancer Center OnCore® system. The 
Protocol Progress  Committee (P PC) reviews study accrual twice per year while the P PC 
coordinator reviews accrual quarterly.  
 
 
16.2.5 Continuing Review 
All Continuing Reviews (CR) will be reviewed annually or as dictated by [CONTACT_4707].  Participating sites will submit a copy of the CR with attachments to the IUSCC MNA, or designee.

Questions about participant safety or protocol performance will be addressed with the Principal Investigator, statistician and study team members. Should any major 
concerns arise,  the DSMB will offer recommendations regarding whether or not to 
suspend the trial.  
 
 
Version 04 /03/2020 Page 41 The DSMB will meet annually  to review accrual, toxicity, response and other information 
reported to the IRB. Information to be provided to the DSMB may include: participant 
accrual, treatment regimen information, adverse events  and serious adverse events 
reported by [CONTACT_17203], summary of any deaths on study, audit and/or monitoring results.  
The DSMB will provide a written recommendation to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_164919]. The report will indicate one or more of the following decisions:  
• Continuation of the trial without change 
• Continuation of protocol/project with modifications as outlined by [CONTACT_164950] 
• Immediate suspension of trial for safety reasons with recommended plan of follow up to minimize subject harm 
• Study placed on clinical hold  
• Termination of trial  
The IUSCC will submit the DSMB report(s) to the participating sites as well. The DSMB report(s) should be provided to the local IRB at the time of continuing review

16. REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded from the time of first study drug administration 
and for at least 30 days after treatment discontinuation, regardless of whether or not the event(s) are considered related to trial medications.  All AEs considered related to trial medication will be followed until resolution, return to baseline, or deemed clinically insignificant, even if this occurs post- trial. 
 16.1 Definitions of Adverse Events  
16.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
Adverse event (AE):  An adverse event is an unplanned, unwanted event which occurs to 
a study participant and which is possibly, but not necessarily, related to the use of 
protocol therapy. While some events may not initially appear  to be associated with the 
use of the study treatment, a relationship may not emerge until sufficient numbers of reports accumulate from participating sites.  An AE may also include a newly occurring 
event or a previous condition that has in creased in severity or frequency since the 
 
 
Version 04 /03/[ADDRESS_191269]’s physical examination, laboratory results and/or signs and symptoms. AEs will be monito red until they are resolved or are clearly determined to 
be due to a subject’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness. Medical care will be provided, as defined in the informed consent document, for any AE related to participation in this clin ical trial  
 
16.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction  (SAR) 
Suspected adverse reaction  is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 
‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adve rse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a dru g. Suspected adverse reactions are the subset of all adverse events for which there is 
a reason able possibility that the drug caused the event. 
 Examples of types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between the drug 
and the adverse event : 
• A single  occurrence  of an  event  that is uncommon and known to be strongly 
associated  with drug exposure (e.g.,  angioedem a, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson 
Syndrom e). 
• One or more occurrences  of an  event  that is not commonly a ssociated  with drug 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed  to the drug (e.g., 
tendon rupture). 
• An aggregate analysis  of specific events  observed in a clinical  trial (such as known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation  or other 
events that  commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that 
indicates those events  occur  more frequently  in the drug treat ment group than in a 
concurrent or historical control group. 
 
16.1.3 Unanticipated Problem (UP) 
Unanticipated Problem (UP):  any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
1) unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of th e subject population being study; 
2) related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
3) suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the  
research than was previously known or recognized. 
Only a small subset of adverse events occurring in human subjects participating in research will meet these three criteria for an unanticipated problem. Furthermore, there are other types of incidents, exp eriences, and outcomes that occur during the 
 
 
Version 04 /03/[ADDRESS_191270] subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no harm occurs. 
 
16.1.4 Adverse Reaction  (AR)  
An adverse reaction is  any adverse event caused by a drug . Adverse reactions are a subset 
of all suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the drug caused 
the event.  
 
16.1.4 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if it results in any  
of the following outcomes: 
• Results in death   
• Is life -threatening . Life-threatening is defined as an adverse event or suspected 
adverse reaction that places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ≥ 24 hours or prolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164920]: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85265]:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85266]  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164921] 24 hours 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition 
unrelated to the study medication  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above).  Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
• Pregnancy  
 Pregnancy of a patient or of the female partner of a male patient during the study or within [ADDRESS_191271] dose of study drug should be reported via an SAE report.  Should pregnancy occur in a female participant during the treatment period, study drug should be discontinued. Should a pregnancy occur in a female companion of a male participant dur ing the 
treatment period, the male participant can continue treatment. Any such pregnancy is to be followed until final outcome.   
 
16.1.5 Unexpected Adverse Event 
 
 
Version 04 /03/[ADDRESS_191272] inserts, investigator brochure or informed consent  document. 
 
 16.1.6 Determining Attribution to the Investigational Agent(s)  
Attribution: An assessment of the relationship between the AE and the medical 
intervention. CTCAE does not define an AE as necessarily “caused by a therapeutic 
intervention” . After naming and grading the event, the clinical investigator must assign 
an attribution to the AE using the following attribution categories:  
 
Relationship  Attribution  Description  
Unrelated to investigational 
agent/intervention Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT related  
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related  
Related to investigational agent/intervention Possible  The AE may be related  
Probable  The AE is likely related  
Definite  The AE is clearly related  
  
16.1.7 Classification and Grading 
Classification and grading of adverse event will utilize the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events (CTCAE) version 4.0 to determine the 
severity of the reaction for adverse event reporting. A copy of the current CTCAE version 4 is available at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/
. 
  
 16.2 Reporting of Adverse Events:  
16.2.1 Participating Site Reporting Responsibilities:  
 
Any serious adverse event or unanticipated problem occurring within [ADDRESS_191273] be accompanied by a cover letter which:  identifies the event, is signed by [CONTACT_164957] [INVESTIGATOR_53460], includes the appli cable study 
number and title, and contains the following: 
 
• Site assessment of the event attribution to investigational product or study procedure 
• Site assessment of event expectedness (expected vs. unexpected)  
• Assessment of whether or not the research plac es subjects at a greater risk of harm 
than was previously known or recognized 
• Assessment of the event’s effect on the risk to benefit ratio  
• Statement as to whether the informed consent statement should reflect changes in 
the potential risks involved  
 
 
Version 04 /03/2020 Page 45 • Statement as to whether the event has been reported previously, and if so, whether 
the frequency is considered unusually high

ATTN: Multicenter coordinator/ Protocol #  IUSCC -0555 
   Fax: ([PHONE_3634] 
E-mail: [EMAIL_3326] 
  The MNA, or designee, will distribute the reports to all participating sites per section 
10.5.2 below. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_164922].  
 
16.2.3 Reporting to the IRB:  
 Each participating site will report adverse events and unanticipated problems to their IRB per local guidelines. Any event that requires expedited reporting to the local IRB will also be submitted to the IU Simon Cancer Center  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Coordinating Center Reporting Responsibilities 
 The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of all adverse event reports for each participating site in the case report forms in OnCore®. AE and SAE reports will be reviewed at weekly meetings. If an adverse event or SAE requires modification of the 
informed consent, protocol or other study documents, participating sites will be informed by [CONTACT_164958], or sooner as deemed necess ary by [CONTACT_079] 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting to the IUSCC Data Safety Monitoring Committee:  
 Regardless of study sponsorship, the study team must enter all initial and follow -up SAE, 
expedited, and noncompliance reports into OnCore
® for review by  [CONTACT_164959]/or coordinator. Expedited reports may include IRB Prompt Report Forms, AdEERS reports, MedWatch, and additional SAE forms as required by [CONTACT_456]. When follow-up information is received, a follow-up report should also be created in O nCore
®. This 
DSMC reporting requirement is in addition  to any other  regulatory bodies to be notified 
(i.e., IRB, pharmaceutical company, etc.). The DSMC chair and/or coordinator will 
review all SAE, expedited, and noncompliance reports monthly.  
• Statement as to whether this adverse event has been reported previously, and if so, 
whether the frequency is considered unusually high 
 
 
 
Version 04 /03/[ADDRESS_191274] submit regulatory documents (informed consents, 1572s, 
Financial Disclosures, IRB approval documents, Continuing Reviews, Amendments, patient brochures or recruitment material etc.) to the Coordinating Center. The Coordinating Center will provide each site with a comprehensive list of the required documents prior to study start-up, throughout the duration of the study and upon study close- out. It is the responsibility of the participating site to maintain copi[INVESTIGATOR_164923]. 
  17.2 Study Initiation  
Before activating the clinical trial at each participating site, the IUSCC CTO MNA,  or 
designee,  will ensure that: 
• Full Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval  has been obtained.  
• Research staff at the participating site has been trained in data entry into OnCore
®  
• A start -up meeting  with each institution has taken place via telephone conference. 
The start -up meeting will cover protocol details (including eligibility criteria, 
treatment plan, etc.), responsibilities of the participating investigators, and reporting 
procedures.   
• A financial conflict of interest statement  from each investigator has been obtained. 
  17.[ADDRESS_191275], supporting source documentation, and signed consent will be sent to IUSCC for verification.  The MNA, or designee, will assign the patient a study number and return the enrollment information to the site.  The site staff will then register the patient in OnCore®. Additional details of this process can be found in the Study Procedure Manual.   
  17.[ADDRESS_191276] to data monitoring by [CONTACT_164960], or designee. External sites will be notified of upcoming 
monitoring visits and will be expected to provide the MNA, or designee, with de-identified source documents for remote monitoring of patients.  Queries will be issued in OnCore ® and a detailed monitoring report will be provided to the participating site.  The 
IUSCC will also forward any monitoring and/or auditing reports to the DSMC. 
 
When a patient enrolled on this trial, or the trial itself, is selected for  local monitoring or 
auditing , the participating site will forward the results to the MNA, or designee. In 
addition, if a participating site patient is selected for local auditing by [CONTACT_164961], the site will be responsible for sending IUSCC de-identified source documents.  
 
 
Version 04 /03/[ADDRESS_191277] Retention  
All documentation of adverse events, records of study drug receipt, dispensation, 
destruction, and all IRB correspondence will be stored in accordance w ith all applicable 
federal guidelines.  
Following closure of the study, each par ticipating site will maintain a copy of all site 
study records in a safe and secure location. The Coordinating Center will inform the investigator at each site at such time that the records may be destroyed.

Version 04 /03/2020 Page 54 19.4 Appendix  IV: Potential Drug Interactions  
Omeprazole inhibits CYP2C19. Patients taking drugs known to be substrates of CYP2C19 may enroll but 
the treating investigator should be aware of the potential drug interaction. When possible, changing to an 
alternative agent that is not metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C19 is advised.  
 
CYP2C19 substrates in clude:  
cyclophosphamide 
citalopram  
amitriptyline  
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_164928] 
S-mephenytoin 
imipramine  
thalidomide phenobarbitone 
carisoprodol 
chloramphenicol clomipramine 
hexobarbital 
indomethacin 
labetalol  
R-mephobarbital 
moclobemide 
nelfinavir 
nilutamide  
primidone progesterone proguanil 
teniposide 
 
Specific guidance is available for the following potential interactions  
Atazanavir and nelfinavir: omeprazole reduces plasma levels of atazanavir and nelfinavir.  
Saquinavir: omeprazole  increases plasma levels of saquinavir. Monitor for toxicity and consider dose 
reduction of saquinavir.  May interfere with drugs for which gastric pH affects bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts, 
erlotinib, ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312], esters, digoxin and mycophenolate mofetil) . Patients treated with omeprazole and 
digoxin may need to be monitored for increases in digoxin toxicity.  
Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]: omeprazole decreases exposure to the active metabolite of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745].  
Cilostazol: omeprazole increases systemic exposure of cilostazol and one of its active metabolites.

Drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 (e.g., diazepam, warfarin, phenytoin, cyclosporine, disulfiram, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]): omeprazole can prolong their eliminati on. Monitor and determine need for dose 
adjustments. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time.  Combined inhibitor of CYP2C19 and 3A4 (e.g., voriconazole) may raise omepraz ole levels.  
Tacrolimus: omeprazole may increase serum levels of tacrolimus.  
Methotrexate: omeprazole may increase serum levels of methotrexate.

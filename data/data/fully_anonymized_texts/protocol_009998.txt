Statistical Analysis Plan {Final} [ADDRESS_678262]-in-human (FIH), ra ndomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of TAK- 041. 
The study is composed of 4 parts: Part 1 is a single-rising dose [SRD] study in healthy subjects, 
with an alternating panel design (Cohorts 1 and 2) and a sequential panel design (Cohorts 3 to 5), 
Part 2 is a multiple-rising dose [MRD], sequential panel design in healthy subjects (Cohorts 1
to 4), Part [ADDRESS_678263] 21 days of safety, tolerability, and 
available PK data from the previous dose levels. For Part 3, the subjects will receive a single 
40 mg dose of the tablet formulation of TAK-041 (1 x 40 mg tablet) based on safety/tolerability 
of the same dose in healthy subjects from Part [ADDRESS_678264] a predicted mean average concentration during a dosing 
interval, at steady state (Cav,ss) below the Cav, ss observed at the no-observed-adverse-effect-
level (NOAEL) dose of 30 mg/kg/day in the male and female dogs from the 13-week toxicology 
study.
Approximately equal numbers of male and female subjects will be enrolled at each dose level. 
TAK-041 and matching placebo will be administered as an oral suspension in Parts 1, 2, and 4 
and as an immediate-release tablet formulation in Part 3.CCI

4.4.2. Part 1 Single-Rising Dose: Healthy Subjects
Part [ADDRESS_678265] 8 subjects per 
cohort (6 active: 2 placebo). Cohorts 1 and 2 will participate in a 2-period, alternating-panel, 
double-blind study design to evaluate single-rising doses of TAK-041 (5, 10, 20, and 40 mg) or 
matched placebo with a washout period of at least 7 days between treatment periods (Table  4.a). 
As of Amendment 04, after review of the data from these initial cohorts, Cohorts 3, 4, and 5 will 
participate in a sequential-panel, double-blind study design to evaluate single-rising doses of 
TAK-041 or matched placebo. This is a double-blind study; therefore, the subject, the trial site 
personnel, and the Sponsor staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation are 
blinded to treatment or intervention. Certain Sponsor staff not directly involved with the 
treatment or evaluation maybe unblinded to the treatment or intervention. The planned dose 
levels of TAK-041 to be evaluated in Cohorts 3, 4, 5 are 80, 120, and 160 mg, respectively 
(Table  4.a). 
As this is an FIH study, a sentinel group will be used for Part 1 Cohort 1 Period 1 (with the init ial 
2 subjects receiving either active drug or placebo [1:1]) to  ensure adequate safe ty and tolerability 
prior to dosing TAK-041 to the remaining subjects in this cohort. In Part 1 Cohort 1 Period 1, the 
remaining 6 subjects will be dosed following a review of 24-hour postdose safety and tolerability 
data and will only occur following agreement betw een the investigator and [COMPANY_005]. The dose 
administered for subsequent cohorts will be based on a minimum of 21 days of emerging safety, 
tolerability, and available PK data from the previous cohorts (see schematic of study design 
below). The highest planned dose is predicted to have Cmax and AUC 24values below the 
corresponding exposure observed at the NOAEL dose of 30 mg/kg/day in the male and female 
dogs from the 13-week toxicology study. Sentinel dosing may be used for additional cohorts if 
determined to be necessary based on the emerging safety, tolerability, and available PK data 
from the preceding cohorts.
Bond-Lader visual analog scales (BL-VAS) will be performed in Part 1, Day -1, Day 1 at 1, 3, 8, 
and 24 hours postdose, Day 5, and (if applicable) and at Early Termination.
A schematic of the Part 1 study design is shown in Table  4.a.

5.0 ANALYSIS ENDPOINTS
5.1 Primary endpoints
The primary  endpoint for all parts of this study  is the com posite of safet y variables to determine 
the safet y and tol erabili ty of oral single and mult iple doses of TAK- 041 as well as dose -limit ing 
effects of TAK -041. The fo llowing safet y param eters will  be analyzed for each of the study  parts 
as the number and percentage of subjects who:

6.0 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
The sample size chosen of 8 subjects per cohort (6 active: 2 placebo) in Part [ADDRESS_678306]-in-human trials rather than a formal 
assessment of statistical power. This sample size is considered sufficient for investigating the 
objectives of the study and characterizing any potential effects on safety parameters.
For Part 3, with a sample size of 16 subjects (8 per regimen), assuming a coefficient of variation 
(%) for the C maxof TAK-041 of 13.8%, a two-sided 90% confidence interval for the difference in 
log-transformed C maxbetween fed and fasted will extend no more than 0.13 from the observed 
mean difference. As an example, if the observed ratio between the two regimens is 1.5, 
representing a 50% increase in exposure due to food, then the confidence interval for the true 
ratio will extend from 1.[ADDRESS_678307]-case scenario, 
assuming a coefficient of variation (%) for AUC 96 of 26.8%, the confidence interval will extend 
no more than 0.25 from the observed mean difference. If the observed ratio between the two 
regimens is 1.5, representing a 50% increase in exposure due to food, then the confidence 
interval for the AUC [ADDRESS_678308]. The assumed variability in C maxand AUC 96are estimates from the completed cohorts in 
Part 1 of this study. To account for potential discontinuations, 18 subjects (9 per regimen) will be 
enrolled.

7.0 METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION
7.1 General Principles
This SAP was developed based on International Conference on Harmonization E3 [1] and E9 [2] 
Guidelines. This SAP should be read in conjunction with the study protocol and electronic case 
report forms. This version of the SAP was devel oped using the information provided in Protocol 
TAK-041-1001, Amendment 5, dated 3 July 2018 [3]and in the electronic case report form 
(eCRF) version 7.0, dated 24 September 2018.
All study-related raw data, including derived data,  will be presented in data listings. Continuous 
data will be summarized using: number of subjects (N), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, 
minimum, and maximum, where appropriate. Where indicated, coefficient of variation (%CV) 
and geometric mean will also be included in  the summary of continuous data. Categorical data 
will be summarized using the number and percentage of subjects for each category where 
appropriate.
All statistical  tests will be 2-tailed at ∀=0.05 level for significance unless otherwise stated. The 
p-values less than or equal to ∀(when rounded to three digits) are reported as “significant”. The 
phrase “no significant difference” indicates that all p-values for the tests are greater than ∀. All 
computations will be performed prior to rounding.
Data collected for subjects during the study period in which they received placebo will be pooled 
together in all safety summaries for each cohort and will be analyzed as one placebo group.
7.1.1. Missing Data
 
 
Individual items that are missing responses will be imputed and then used to determine 
the total scores. The repeated measures analysis will be conducted both with and without using 
MI. See Section  7.13.[ADDRESS_678310] incomplete data, will be made on a case-by-case basis, but the data will be
presented in data listings regardless. 
Plasma concentrations that are below the limit of  quantification will be treated as zero in the 
summarizing of concentration values and deriving of PK parameters. These values will be 
flagged in the data listings, and deviations from this convention may be considered on a case-by-
case basis as deemed appropriate.CCI

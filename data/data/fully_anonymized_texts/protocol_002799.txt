Adju nctive Thera py in Adults with Major Depressive 
Disorder , the Orion Trial
Clinical Phase: 3
Treatment Indication: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
Objective(s): Primary :  To assess the long -term safety  and tolerability  of oral 
OPC -[ZIP_CODE] (hereafter referred to b y the generic name 
“brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]”) as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of 
adults with MDD.
Secondary :  To assess the long- term efficacy  of oral 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34821] y in the treatment of adults 
with MDD.
Trial Design: This isa multicenter, 26-week , open -label trial designed to 
assess the long
-term safety , tolerability , and efficacy  of 
adjunctive brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657367] y (ADT ).  The trial will be conducted on 
an outpatient basis.  Enrollment into th e trialwill be drawn 
from eligible subjects who have completed the last scheduled 
visit of adouble -blind ,phase 3 brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657368], in the investigator’s judgment, could potentially  benefit 
from adjunctive treatmen t with oral brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657369].
The original 52 week open- label trial design has been modified 
in this Amendment 3 to shorten the duration of the trial to 26 
weeks ;
ongoing subjects who have not re ached their Week [ADDRESS_886270] alread y 
completed their Week 26 visit at the time of Amend
ment 3 
will follow Amendment 3 week 26/ET schedule of 
assessments at their next scheduled visit.
The trialwill be organized as follows:
Screening/Basel ine:  Subjects will be screened for eligibility  at 
the last scheduled visit of the prior double -blind phase [ADDRESS_886271] scheduled visit of the prior double -blind phase 3 
trial will serve as the baseline measures for Trial 331-10-238 
for an y assessment that is not unique to the open -label trial.  
Medical history  will be u pdated, if necessary .
Treatment Phase:   Eligible subjects will receive daily  
treatment with open -label brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657370], Dose, Formulation, 
Mode of Administration section.  V isits will occur at the end 
of Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 14, 20, and 26.

0.5mg/day .  Dose adjustments must ultimately  be made 
based upon the clinical judgment of the investigator as it 
relates to tolerability  and therapeutic response.
Subjects who tolerate a reduc ed dose of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 
0.5mg/day  should be rechallenged with brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 
1mg/day  
at least once during the trial.  In addition, t he
dose of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657380] -escalated as necessary  
following a nydose decrease if, in the investigator’s 
judgment, rechallenge with a higher dose is warranted in 
order to identify  an optimum dose for the subject.  Subjects 
must return to the clinic for unscheduled visit s if changes to 
the dose of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (increases or decreases) are 
required between scheduled vis

phase 3 trial .  It is recommended that the dose of ADT not be 
changed while the dose of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657381] 
(ie, no change to A DT up to and including the Week 4 visit).  
After the Week 4 visit , the dose of ADT can be modified if 
necessary  to achieve optimum efficacy  and tolerability  for the 
treatment regimen using the following rules:  1) at least [ADDRESS_886277] elapse between dose increases (either brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657382]), 2) an interval of at least 5 day s between dose 
adjustments (either brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657383]) is recommended 
for dose decreases; however, the ADT dose can be decreased 
at the investigator’s discretion at an y time as needed for 
tolerability , and 3) subjects must return to the clinic for 
unschedul ed visits if changes to the ADT dose are required 
between scheduled visits.
ADTs for open -
label treatment will be provided in commercial 
packaging (eg, bottles), with additional labeling for use in this 
trial, as necessary  to fulfill regulatory  requirement s.  
Numbered ADT bottles to be dispensed to the subject will be 
assigned b y the IVRS or IWRS.  The ADTs to be used in this 
trial, including allowable doses within the therapeutic range, 
are as follows:

once dail y or in divided doses twice dail y.  All A DTs can be 
given without regard to meals, except for venlafaxine XR 
which should be taken with food.  Subjects should be 
instructed to take the ADT at approximately  the same time 
each day , if possible.
Criteria for 
Evaluation:Primary  Outcome Variable:
The primary  outcome variable is the safet y and tolerability  of 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657385] b y examining the 
frequency  and severit y of adverse events (AEs).
Secondary  Outcome Variables:
Efficacy :  Efficacy  variables will be as follows:
Change from ba seline in Clinical Global I mpression -
Severity  of Illness scale score;
Mean Clinical Global Impre ssion -Improvement scale 
score;
Change from baseline in Sheehan Disability  Scale score.
Change from baseline in the Inventory  of Depressive 
Symptomatology  (Self-Report )Total Score
Safet y:  In addition to AEs, safet y variables to be examined in 
this trialwill include physical examinations, vital signs, bod y 
weight, waist circumference, clinical laboratory  tests 
(hematology , serum chemistry , urinal ysis, and pr egnancy  
tests), and electrocardiograms (ECGs) .  In general, descriptive 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 7 13Jun 2014statistics of changes from baseline will be provided for safety 
variables based on all available data.  Prospectively  defined 
criteria will be used to identify  potentially  clinically  relevant 
abnormal values for clinical laboratory  tests, vital signs, ECGs, 
and body  weight.  Change from baseline in body  mass index 
(derived programmatically from body  weight and height 
measurements) will be summarized.  In addition to the anal ysis 
of standard safet y variables, other safet y variables including 
the Simpson Angus Scale, the Abnormal Involuntary  
Movement Scale, the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale , the 
Columbia -Suicide Severity  Rating Scale ,and the 
[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] S exual Functioni ng 
Questionnaire will also be evaluated.
Other Outcomes:   
Responses to the Resource Utilization F orm 
(RUF) will be summarized appropriatel y to explore the impact 
of treatment on health care resources.
Trial Duration: The duration of this trial from first subject enrolled to last 
subject completed is estimated to be approximately  57months, 
of which approximately  51months are allotted for rollover of 
subjects from the prior double -blind phase 3 brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657386].  Individual participation for subjec ts who 
complete the trialwithout earlywithdrawal will be 
approximately  30weeks ( 26 weeks of treatment and 30 -day 
follow -up).

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating and chronic illness characterized b y a 
broad spectrum of emotional and ph ysical s ymptoms.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_657391] (eg, pharmacotherapy, cognitive behavioral psychother apy, 
electroconvulsive therapy [ECT], etc.), achievement of consistent and favorable 
long-term outcomes still represents an unmet medical need.  For patients who experience 
an initial major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the probability of experiencing another epi[INVESTIGATOR_28948] e at 
some point in the future can be as high as 85%.1  In addition, 15% of patients may  endure 
chronic s ymptoms after the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], while 35% may  experience recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].2  
Remission rates are low for initial antidepressant monotherapy  treatment (less than 30%) 
and partial response is common.[ADDRESS_886285] been used in combination with antidepressants for treatment of 
psychotic or delusional forms of depression.  However, the use of antipsychotics as

1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics
The pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657407], attention -deficit/hy peractivity  disorder 
(ADHD), and schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  Based on preclinical data and 
human clinical trials, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) and one metabolite, DM-3411, were 
identified as the major analy tes that are present in human plasma.  In vitro, the activity  of 
DM-3411 is 17 times lower than that of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657408].  Both brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34807] -3411 pharmacokinetics were linear 
following single oral doses of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 0.2 to 8 mg to health y subjects .  The 
Protocol 331 -10-238

plasma concentration (t max) occurred at approximately  [ADDRESS_886289] 
its ra te and extent of absorption.
Steady  state pharmacokinetics also appeared to be linear following multiple daily  doses 
of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34808] 0.5 to 2 mg to healthy  subjects.  The accumulation factor 
based on maximum (peak) plasma concentration (C max) and area under the 
concentration -time curve calculated to the last observable concentration at time t (AUC t) 
was approximately  4 times.  After multiple dose administration of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (1 to 
12mg/day ) to subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffect ive disorder, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657409]-3411 mean terminal elimination half -life at steady  state was 95.4 and 89.3 hours,

placebo- controlled ef ficacy  trial ( Trial 331-09- 222) and one long -term open -label safet y 
trial ( Trial 331-08- 212) are ongoing.  Trial 331 -08-211 was a multicenter, randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled trial designed to assess the safety  and efficacy  of 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (0.15 to 2 mg dail y) as adjunctive treatment to an assigned open -label ADT 
in subjects with MDD who have demonstr ated an incomplete response to prospective 
treatment with the same ADT.  Subjects with an incomplete response after 8 weeks of 
treatment with sin gle-blind placebo plus open -label ADT were randomized to 6 weeks of 
double -blind treatment with either brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] -plus- ADT or placebo- plus-ADT.  
Responders continued to receive placebo- plus- ADT for an additional 6 weeks.  
Randomized subjects received brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 0.15 mg/day , 0.50 0.25 mg/day, 
1.50.50 mg/day , or matching placebo.  Subjects randomized to the brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 
0.500.25 mg/day  and brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1.5 0.50 mg/day  arms were titrated to the target 
doses (0.50 and 1.5 mg, respectivel y) ove r a 2-week period.  Dose adjustments were 
permitted after the subjects received [ADDRESS_886291] dose ( brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 0.15, 0.25, or 1.0mg/day or matching 
placebo, respectivel y) were to be discontinued from the trial .  In this trial, adjunctive 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34822] 1.5 0.50 mg/day  was superior to adjunctive placebo with respect 
to the primary  endpoint (change from Week 8 to Week 14 in Montgomery Asberg 
Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] Tot al Score) and several secondary  efficacy  
endpoints.20  Ongoing Trial 331-09- 222 is of similar design to Trial 331 - 08-211, but is 
exploring an expanded dose range ( brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1 to 3 mg/day ).

Risks associated with use of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRI s
)and 
serotonin -norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] ( SNRI s)used in Trial 331-10-238 can be 
found in the prescribing information for the open -label ADTs .
2 Trial Rationale and Objectives
2.1 Trial Rationale
Investigations of the interactions between serotonin and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_657427] s provid e a pharmacological basis for use of aty pi[INVESTIGATOR_657428] -resistant MDD.  At the cellular 
level, increased serotonergic activity  from prolonged reuptake inhibition appears to 
attenuate the firing of noradrenergic neurons indirectly  through increased activation of 
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 26 13Jun [ZIP_CODE]-HT2A receptors.22  The resulting decrease in noradrenergic tone may  contribute to the 
suboptimal therapeutic response observed clinically  with long-term administration of 
SSRI s.23  As brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657429] 5- HT2A receptors, the attenuated 
response t o SSRI s may  be reversed with co administration of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657430] s, 
thus enhancing clini
cal outcomes.
Because the management of MDD may  require prolonged administration of ADT(s) with 
or without an augmenting agent, safety  monitoring for longer than the period required to 
achieve initial response is warranted.  In the brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657431] d evelopment program 
for MDD, phase 2 and phase 3 trials examined the 6 -week safet y and efficacy  of 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657432].  For phase 2, subjects who completed either of the 
trials had the option to enroll into an open -label rollover trial in wh ich they  receiv ed 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657433] 52 weeks ( Trial 331-
08-212).  The current trial ( Trial 331-10-238) 
provides an open -label rollover option for double -blind phase 3 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657434] -term 
safet y, tolerability , and efficacy  of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657435] .
2.2 Dosing Rationale
Adose range of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 0.5 to 3 mg/day  was selected for the current open- label 
trial to en compass the dose range of the double- blind efficacy  trials (ie, 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 
1to 3mg/day ) and to include an option for a reduced dose for tolerabilit y (ie, 
0.5mg/day ) in order to maximize subject retention in the long -term trial .  Therapeutic 
dose ranges of ADT are based on product labels and clinical practice.  Data from phase 1 
drug interaction trials
(Trial 331-08-207 and Trial 331- 08-208) indicated that 
coadministration of CYP2D6 inhibitors (eg, paroxetine, fluoxetine , and duloxetine ) with 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657436] (up 
to 2-fold).  In order to limit the potential higher exposure of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657437], the upper limit of the therapeutic ADT dose is
limited to 40mg for fluoxeti ne, 50 mg for paroxetine CR , and 60 mg for duloxetine in the 
current trial.

3 Trial Design
3.1 Type/Design of Trial
This is a multicenter, 26-week, open -label trial designed to assess the long -term safet y, 
tolerability , and efficacy  of adjunctive brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657439].  The trialwill be conducted on an outpatient basis.  Enrollment into the trialwill be 
drawn from eligible subjects who have completed the last scheduled visit of a
double-blind phase 3 brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657440], in the investigator’s judgment, 
could potentially  benefit from adjunctive treatment with oral brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657369].  A 
schematic of the trialdesign is presented in Figure 3.1-
1.
The trialwill be organized as follows:
Screening/Baseline:   Subjects will be screened for eligibility  at the last scheduled visit of 
the prior double -blind phase 3 trial .  Subjects will sign a separate informed consent form 
(ICF) for participation in Trial 331-10- [ADDRESS_886294] scheduled visit of the prior 
double -blind phase 3 trial will serve as the baseline measures for Trial 331-10-238 for 
any assessment that is not unique to the open -label trial.  Medical history  will be updated, 
if necessary .
Treatment Phase:   Eligible subjects will receive dail y treatment with open -label 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657441] 3.2.  Visits will occur at the end of 
Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 14, 20, and 26.  All subjects will receive up to 26 weeks of open -label 
treatment in Trial 331-
10-238 and follow the schedule of assessments described in Table 
3.6-1.
Follow -up:  
Subjects will be followed for safety  via telep hone contact [CONTACT_238244]

prolactin), and ECG parameters.  Mean change from baseline will be calculated for 
coagulation par ameters (prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time 
[aPTT], and I nternational Normalized Ratio [INR]), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), 
thyroid
-stimulating hormone (TSH), waist circumference, and bod y mass index (BMI ; 
derived programmatic ally from body  weight and height measurements).  A central ECG 
service will be utilized to review all ECGs in order to standardize interpretations for the 
safet y analysis.  EPS will be evaluated b y calcula ting mean change from baseline on the

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory  Tests
As it is unlikely  that the final laboratory  test results from the last scheduled visit of the 
prior double -blind phase [ADDRESS_886332]’s most recent laboratory  test 
results from the prior double -blind phase [ADDRESS_886333] results t hat, in the investigator’s judgment, 
are medicall y significant and would impact the safety of the subject or the interpretation 
of the trial results.  Subjects meeting any  of these criteria will be excluded from 
Trial 331-10-238.  Appendix 4is included to assist investigators in their assessments of 
results that may  be potentially  medicall y significant, depending on the subject’s medical 
history  and clinical presentation.  I f one or more results from the screening/baseline 
sample are clinicall y significant and/or exclusionary  when the results from the last 
scheduled visit of the 
prior double -blind phase [ADDRESS_886334](s) should

protocol.  A complete phy sical examination will consist of a rev iew of the following 
body  systems:  HEENT, thorax, abdomen, urogenital, extremities, neurological, and skin 
and mucosae.  Repeat measurement of height is not required during Trial 331-10-238 if a 
Screening/ Baseline value is available from the prior double -blind phase [ADDRESS_886339] 
circumference will be measured at Screening/Baseline , Week 14,and Week 26/ET.   The 
following procedures will aid in the standardization of these measurements:
The subject should be minimally  clothed (ie, lightweight clothing; n o heavy  
overgarments).
Waist circumference should be recorded before a subject’s meal and at approximately  
the same time at each visit.
Measurement will be accomplished by  [CONTACT_35059] a weigh ted measuring tape in a horizontal plane around 
the abdomen at the level of the crest.  Before reading the tape measure, the assessor 
should assure that the tape is snug, but does not compress the skin, and is parallel to 
the floor.  The measurement is to be made at the end of a normal exhalation.24

[IP_ADDRESS].2 Vital Signs
Vital sign measurements will include body  weight, body  temperature, s ystolic blood 
pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate.  The following guidelines 
will aid in the standardization of body  weight measurements:
The same scale should be used to weigh a given subject each time, if possible.
Scales should be calibrated a nd reliable; scales should be at zero just prior to each 
subject’s weigh- in session.
A subject should void prior to being weighed and be minimally  clothed (ie, no shoes 
or heav y overgarments).
Weight should be recorded before a subject’s meal and at approx imately  the same 
time at each visit.
Blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be made in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], sitting, and 
standing positions after the subject has been in each position for at least 3 minutes.  The

symptomatic hy potension are exc luded from the trialas are subjects with orthostatic 
hypotension defined as a decrease of 30 mmHg in SBP and/or a decrease of 
[ADDRESS_886340] 3 minutes standing compared to the previous supi[INVESTIGATOR_657481] (see Table 3.4.3-1 ).  In addition, subjects 
should be excluded if they have an y other vital sign measurement at Screening/Baseline 
that, in the investigator’s judgment, is medicall y significant in that it would impact the 
safet y of the subject or the interpr etation of the trialresults.  However, an y abnormal 
screening/baseline vital sign result(s) considered to be clinicall y significant should be 
repeated to confirm the finding(s) before excluding the subject from the trial.  Appendix

presentation.
[IP_ADDRESS] ECG Assessments
Twelve -lead ECGs will be recorded at the visits specified in Table 3.6-1.  E CG 
recordings will be obtained after the subject has been su pi[INVESTIGATOR_34884] 
5minutes.  Additional 12 -lead ECGs may  be obtained at the investigator’s discretion and 
should alway s be obtained in the event of an earl y termination.  A central EC G service 
will be utilized for reading all ECGs in order to standardize interpretations for the safety  
analysis.  In addition, 
ECG results will be evaluated at the investigational site to monitor 
safet y during the trial.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_657482], sign, 
and date each ECG reading, noting whether or not any abnormal results are of clinical 
significance.  The ECG will be repeated if an y results are considered to be clinically  
significant.
As the results from the central read er will not be available at the Screening/Baseline visit, 
the subject will be enrolled into Trial 331-10-238 based on the local ECG results.  A 
screening/baseline ECG finding of QTc corrected for heart rate b y Fridericia’s formula 
(QTcF) 450
msec is excl usionary (see Table 3.4.3 -1).  In addition, subjects should be 
excluded if they  have any  other abnormal ECG finding at Screening/Baseline that, in the 
investigator’s judgment, is medically  significant in that it would impact the safet y of the 
subject or th e interpretation of the trialresults.  However, any  screening/baseline ECG 
with abnormal result(s) considered to be clinically significant should be repeated to 
confirm the finding(s) before excluding the subject from the trial.  
Appendix 5is 
provided as a guide for determining potentially  clinically  relevant ECG abnormalities.   If 
the results from the central reader, when available, indicate a screening/baseline 
QTcF 450msec, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_657623]’s c ontinued participation in the trial.
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Safety  Assessments
It is required that a trained and experienced clinician administer the safet y assessments, 
including the EPS scales (SAS, AI MS, and BARS) and C -SSRS.  The number of raters 
within each trial cent er should be kept to a minimum.  All efforts will be made to ensure 
that the same clinician administers the scales for a given subject.  Notations in the 
subject’s trial records should substantiate the ratings.  Training and materials for rating 
will be pr ovided b y Bracket .

Anticholinergics, propranolol, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and non- benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_444436] 12 hours of scale administration (see Section 4).  Investigators are 
encouraged to delay scale administration until [ADDRESS_886342] elapsed, if at all possible.  
However, if delay ing administration of the scale is not feasible, the SAS should still be 
administered and the use of the medication documented, including a notation of the drug 
name, dose, and time of administration on the electronic case report form (eCRF).
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (A IMS)
The AIMS26assessment ( Appendix 11
) consists of 10 items describing s ymptoms of 
dyskines ia.  Facial and oral movements (items 1 through 4), extremity  movements (items 
5 and 6), and trunk movements (item 7) will be observed unobtrusivel y while the subject 
is at rest (eg, in the waiting room), and the investigator will also make global judgment s 
on the subject’s d yskinesias (items 8 through 10).  Each item will be rated on a 5-point 
scale, with a score of zero representing absence of sy mptoms (for item 10, no awareness), 
and a score of 4 indicating a severe condition (for item 10, awareness, sev ere distress).  
For this scale, the subject is to be sitting on a hard, firm chair.  In addition, the AIMS 
includes two y es/no questions that address the subject’s dental status.  Anticholinergics, 
propranolol, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and non -benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_657483] 12 hours of scale administration (see Section 4).  Investigators are encouraged to

If the sponsor terminates or suspends the trial for safet y or unanticipated other reasons, 
prompt notification will be given to investigators, I RBs/IECs, and regulatory  authorities 
in accordance with regulatory  requirements.
3.7.2 Individual Center
A particular center may  be terminated from the trial at the discretion of the investigator, 
sponsor, or I RB, eg, for non-enrollment of subjects or noncompliance with the protocol.  
The investigator will notify  the sponsor promptly  if the trial is terminat ed by  [CONTACT_642006] I RB/EC at the site.

Protocol [ADDRESS_886351] be 
withdrawn from the trial:
a) occurrence of an y AE, intercurrent illness or abnormality in a laboratory  assessment
which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], warrants the subject’s permanent withdrawal 
from the trial ;
b) treatment with a prohibited concomitant medication other than the use of appropriate 
medications for the treatment of AEs under direction of the investigator;
c) subject 
noncompliance, defined as refusal or inability  to adhere to the trialschedule or 
procedures (see Section 3.11, Subject Compliance) ;
d) at the request of the subject, investigator, sponsor or des ignee, or r egulatory  authority ;
e) subject becomes pregnant ;
f) subject cannot tolerate the minimum dose of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (ie, 0.5mg/day ), the 
minimum protocol -defined therapeutic dose of ADT (see Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1 ),or requires a 
different ADT; or
g) subject is lost to follow -
up.
The investigator will notify  the sponsor promptly  when a subject is withdrawn.  Subjects 
withdrawn prior to Week [ADDRESS_886352] complete the Week 26/ET evaluations at the time of 
withdrawal.  In addition, all subjects who withdraw prematurely  from the trial will be 
assessed 30 (+2)days after the last dose of I MP for evaluation of safet y.  This 
assessment can be accomplished via telephone contact [CONTACT_657625]’s 
discretion.  Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced.

documented in writing (ie, subject signs an ICF), but who is not started on treatment, 
whether through randomization or open assignment. For the purposes of 
Trial 331-10-238, treatment begins with the first dose of open- label brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657487].  Subjects who do not qualify  for Trial 331-10- [ADDRESS_886354] scheduled 
visit of the prior 
double -blind phase 3 trial may  not be rescreened.
3.9 Definition of Completed Subjects
The treatment period is defined as the time period during which subjects are evaluated for 
primary  and/or secondary  objectives of the trialirrespective of whether or not the subject 
actuall y consumed all doses of IMP.  Subjects who are evaluated at the last scheduled 
Protocol [ADDRESS_886355] -treatment follow -up contacts will not qualify  as the “last scheduled visit.”  
Subjects who are not completers are defined as those who “discontinued thetrial.”
3.[ADDRESS_886356] a known reason for discontinuation (eg, withdrew consent or 
AE) will be classified as “lost to follow -up” as the reason for discontinuation.  The site 
will make three attempts to contact [CONTACT_423] b y telephone and in the event the site is 
unab le to reach the subject by  [CONTACT_756], the site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_657626].
3.[ADDRESS_886357] Compliance
Responsible trial personnel will dispense the IMP (ie, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657488]).  
Accountability  and compliance verification should be documented in the subject’s trial 
records.  Subjects must be counseled on the importance of taking the IMP as directed at 
alltrialvisits.  I f poor compliance continues (eg, multiple missed doses resultin g in less 
than 80% overall compliance at an y point in the trial
), discontinuation of the subject from 
the trial should be considered.  Subjects who habitually  miss visits or habitually  attend 
visits outside of the protocol- defined visit window are also non compliant and should be 
considered for discontinuation.  The medical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_330209] a subject's lack of compliance merits discontinuation

4.[ADDRESS_886361]’s best medical interests should guide the investigator in the management of 
conditions that are pre-existing or that develop during the trial(intercurrent illness or 
AEs).  The investigator should examine the acceptability  of all concomitant medications 
not explicitly  prohibited.  I n order to ensure that appropriate concomitant therapy  is 
administered, it is essential that subjects be instructed not to take an y medications (either 
self-administered non-prescription drugs or prescription therapy  prescribed by  [CONTACT_3213]) without prior consultation with the investigator.  In particular, the investigator 
should caution the subject about concomitant use of the following during the trial:
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], or other drugs that interfere with 
coagulation since the combined use of ps ychotropic drugs that interfere with 
serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of

4.2.2 Non- therapy Precautions and Restrictions
[IP_ADDRESS] Precautions
Subjects should not undergo an y elective medical procedure without prior consultation 
with the investigator.  An elective procedure (minor surgery , dental surgery , orthopedic 
surgery , etc) tha t might require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_657499] y appropriate.
[IP_ADDRESS] Restrictions
Subjects may  only receive psychotherap y (eg, individual, group, marriage, or family 
therap y) if they  initiated the therap y at least [ADDRESS_886364] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related.
A suspected adverse reaction means an y AE for which there is a reasonable possibility  
that the drug caused the AE .  For the purpose of IND safet y reporting, “reasonable 
possibility ” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and 
the AE.  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty  about causality  
than adverse reactio n, which means an y AE caused by a drug.
A serious adverse event (SAE) includes an y event that results in any  of the following 
outcomes:
death
life-threatening, ie, the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_66237] , at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred.  It does not 
include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death.
persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability  to 
conduct normal life functions.
requires i n-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_657500]: A pre -scheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34909]; however, 
SAE forms must be completed for all other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], including 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114320].  Psy chosocial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] 
(eg,homelessness or need for shelter that is unrelated to the subject’s underly ing 
psychiatric condition) should not be reported as SAEs.
congenital anomal y/birth defect
other medicall y significant events that, based upon appropr iate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may  require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, eg, allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  room or home, 
blood dy scrasias or convul sions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Non-serious adverse events are all AEs that do not meet the criteria for a "serious" AE.
If a subject is experiencing an extrapy ramidal s ymptom, the specific extrapy ramidal 
symptom must be indicated on the AE page of the eCRF.  Examples of AEs that are 
considered extrapyramidal sy mptoms include, but are not limited to :  generalized rigidity , 
Protocol [ADDRESS_886365] be 
entered as “extrap yramidal sy ndrome” on the AE page of the eCRF instead of the 
individual sy mptoms.  Permitted treatments for EPS are described in Section 4.2.1.
Immediatel y Reportable Event (IRE):
Any SAE
Any AEthat necessitates discontinuation of IMP.
Potential Hy ’s Law cases ( any increase of 
AST or ALT3 times the upper 
normal limit with an increase in total bilirubin 2 times the upper normal limit) .
Pregn ancies are also defined as IREs. Although normal pregnancy  is not an AE, 
it will mandate IMP discontinuation and must be reported on an IRE form to INC 
Research.  Pregnancy  will only  be documented on the AE eCRF if there is an 
abnormality  or complication.
Clinical L aboratory  Chan ges:  It is the investigator’s responsibility  to review the results 
of all laboratory  tests as they  become available.  This review will be documented by  [CONTACT_1275]’s dated signature [CONTACT_35217].  For each abnormal laboratory  test 
result, the investigator needs to ascertain if this is an abnormal (ie, clinically  significant) 
change from baseline for that individual subject. (This determination, however, does not 
necessarily  need to be made the first time an abnormal value is observed.  Th e 
investigator may  repeat the laboratory  test or request additional tests to verify  the results 
of the original laboratory tests).  If this laboratory  value is determined by  [CONTACT_657627], this is considered an AE. 
Severity :  Adverse events will be graded on a 3-point scale and reported as indicated on 
the eCRF .  The intensit y of an adverse experience is defined as follows:
1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily  activity .
2 = Mod erate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily  activit y.
3 = Severe: Inability  to work or perform normal daily  activity .
IMP Causalit y:Assessment of causal relationship of an AE to the use of the IMP is 
defined as follows:
Related : There is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship.
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 67 13Jun 2014Possibly related : There is a reasonable causal relationship between the IMP and the 
AE.  Dechallenge is lacking or unclear.
Unlikely related : There is a temporal relationship to IMPadministration, bu t there is 
not a reasonable causal relationship between the IMP and the AE .
Not Related : There is no temporal or reasonable relationship to the IMP
administration.
Investigators will assess IMP causality  based on brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] .
5.2 Eliciting and Reporting A dverse Events
The investigator will periodically  assess subjects for the occurrence of AEs.  In order to 
avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the following non-leading question: 
"How have you felt since y our last visit?"  AllAEs (serious and non- serious) reported by  
[CONTACT_657628] .
Note:  Normal pregnancy is not an AEand should not be recorded on the eCRFs; 
guidelines outlined in Section 5.5should be followed for pregnancy reporting.
In addition, INC Research (Appendix 2) must be notified immediately  by [CONTACT_657629] 5.3 .  Special attention should be paid to recording hospi[INVESTIGATOR_458195].
5.3 Immediately  Reportable Events (IRE)
The investigator must immediately (ie, within 24 hours) report an yserious adverse event, 
potential Hy ’s law cases ,or confirmed pregnancy by [CONTACT_657630] 2after either the investigator or site personnel become 
aware of the event.  An Immediately  Reportable Event (IRE) form must be completed 
and transmitted per the instructions in the Operations Manual.  (Please note that the IRE
form is NOT the AE eCRF .)
Non-serious events that require discontinuation of IMP(including laboratory  
abnormalities) should be reported to INC Res earch within [ADDRESS_886366].
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 68 13Jun [ZIP_CODE].4 Potential Hy ’s Law Cases
For a subject that experiences an elevation in AST or ALT that is 3 time s the upper 
normal limit , a total bilirubin level should also be evaluated. If the total bilirubin is 
2times the upper normal limit, confirmatory repeat laboratory  samples should be 
drawn within 48 to 72 hours of the initial draw.  If these values are confirmed, trial 
personnel will complete an I RE form with all values listed and also report the event as an 
AE on the 
eCRFs.   Please note: If the subject was enrolled into the trial with non-
exclusionary  elevated transaminase levels at baseline, please discuss an y potential drug -
induced liver injury  events with the Medical Monitor.

the following precautions must be used: vasectomy ortubal ligation (subject and 
partner) , vaginal diap hragm, intrauterine device , birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], birth control depot 
injection, birth control implant, condom or sponge with spermicide.  An y single method 
of birth control, including vasectom y and tubal ligation, may fail, leading to pregnancy.
Before enrolling WOCBP in this clinical trial, investigators must review guidelines about 
trialparticipation for WOCBP.  The topi[INVESTIGATOR_657501] e:
General information
Informed consent form
Pregnancy  prevention information
Drug interactio ns with hormonal contraceptives
Contraceptives in current use
Guidelines for the fo
llow-up of a reported pregnancy
Prior to trial enrollment, WOCBP must be advise d of the importance of avoiding 
pregnancy  during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy .  The subject must sign an ICFstating that the above -mentioned risk factors 
and the consequences were discussed with her.
Protocol [ADDRESS_886368] they  might be pregnant (eg, missed or late menstrual cy cle).
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may  be pregnant prior to IMP
administ ration, the IMP administration must be withheld until the results of serum 
pregnancy  tests are available.  If the pregnancy  is confirmed, the subject must not receive 
the IMPand must not be enrolled in the trial.  If pregnancy  is suspected while the subje ct 
is taking IMP , the IMP must be withheld immediately  (if reasonable, taking into 
consideration an y potential withdrawal risks) until the result of the pregnancy is known.  
If pregnancy  is confirmed, the IMPwill be permanently  discontinued in an appropri ate 
manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary  for subject safet y) and the subj ect withdrawn from 
the trial.  Exceptions to trial discontinuation may  be considered for life -threatening 
conditions only  after consultations with the Drug Safet y and Pharmacovigila nce 
Department of INC Research (see Appendix 2for contact [CONTACT_3031] ).
The investigator must immediately  notify INC Research of any  pregnancy  associated 
with IMPexposure, including 
at least [ADDRESS_886369] dose for female subjects and 
the female partner(s) of a male subject and record the event on the IREform and forward 
it to INC Research.  INC Research will forward Pregnancy  Surveillance Form(s) for 
monitoring the outcome of the pregnancy .
Protocol required procedures for trial discontinuation and follow -up must be performed 
on the subject unless contraindicated b y pregnancy (eg, x -ray studies).  Other appropriate 
pregnancy  follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated.  In addition, the 
investigator must report to INC Research , on appr opriate Pregnancy  Surveillance form(s), 
follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy , including perinatal and 
neonatal outcome.  Infants will be followed for a minimum of six months.
5.6 Follow -up of A dverse Events

brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657373] 0.5, 
1, 2, and 3-mg tablets packaged in weekl y blister 
cards, each containing sufficie nttablets for 7 (+2 days).  Blister cards will contain single 
tablet strengths (ie, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 0.5, 1, 2, or 3 mg/day ) and subjects will take [ADDRESS_886374] ID (to be filled in b y the site 
staff/investigator), subject’s initials or other unique identifier , name [CONTACT_6823] (to 
be filled in by [CONTACT_7893]/investigator), site number (to be filled in by  [CONTACT_35082]/investigator), subject’s initials (to be filled in by  [CONTACT_7893]/investigator), date 
dispensed (to be filled in by  [CONTACT_7893]/investigator), compound ID, protocol number, 
the sponsor's name [CONTACT_3816], instructions for use, route of a dministration, and 
appropriate precautionary statements.
  Once a blister card has been assigned to a subject
via the IVRS or I WRS , it cannot be dispensed to another subject.
ADTs will be supplied as bulk drug in commercial packaging (eg, bottles) with an 
ancillary  trial-specific label that will be positioned such that it will not obscure the 
original commercial label.  The sponsor reserves the right to use a generic equivalent, 
should any  marketed antidepressant become unavailable during the course of the trial.
  
Each ADT bottle used in the trial will be labeled to clearl y disclose the bottle number, 
Subject ID, subject’s initials, protocol number, ADT drug name, the sponsor's name [CONTACT_2758], instructions for use, route of administration, and appropriate p recautionary  
statements.  Once an ADT bottle has been assigned to a subject via the IVRS or I WRS, it 
cannot be dispensed to another subject.  The amount of open -label ADT dispensed to a 
subject at each visit will be contingent upon the prescribed daily  dose of ADT as well as 
the duration between trialvisits.  Subjects must remain on the same ADT for the duration

(eg, due to relocation or retirement), all trialrelated records should be transferred to a 
mutually  agreed upon designee within a sponsor -specified timeframe .  Notice of such 
transfer will be given to the sponsor (or designee) in writing.
10 Quality  Control and Quality  Assurance 
10.1 Monitoring
The sponsor has ethical, legal ,and scientific obligations to follow this trial in a detailed 
and orderl y manner in accordance with established research principles, the ICH GCP 
Guideline, FDA regulations and applicable regulatory  requirements and local laws .  As 
part of a concerted effort to fulfill these obligations (maintain current personal knowledge 
of the progress of the trial
), the sponsor's monitors or designee will visit the site during

IRB/IEC will evaluate the ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the trial. 
Further, in preparing and handlin g eCRFs, the investigator, sub investigator ,and their 
staff will take measures to ensure adequate care in protecting subject privacy . To this 
end, a subject number and subject identification code will be used to identify  each 
subject.
Protocol 331 -10-238
Confidential -Proprietary Information 80 13Jun 201412 Confidentiality
Allinformation generated in this trial will be considered highl y confidential and will not 
be disclosed to an yone not directly  concerned with the trial without the sponsor’s prior 
written permission.  However, authorized regulatory  officials and sponsor pers onnel (or 
their representatives) will be allowed full access to inspect and cop y the records.  All 
IMPs , subject bodil y fluids, and/or other materials collected shall be used solely  in 
accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agreed to in writing b ythe sponsor.
Subjects will be identified only  by [CONTACT_35091].  Per 
country  regulations, if subject initials cannot be collected, another unique identifier will 
be used.  
Their full names may , however, be made known to a re gulatory  agency  or other 
authorized officials if necessary .
13 Amendment Policy
The investigator will not make an y changes to this protocol without prior written consent 
from the sponsor (or sponsor’s designee) and subsequent approval by  [CONTACT_1201]/IEC.  Any  
permanent change to the protocol, whether it be an overall change or a change for 
specific trial site(s) , must be handled as a protocol amendment.  Any  amendment will be 
written by  [CONTACT_456].  Each amendment will be submitted to the I RB/IEC.  Except for 
non-substantial (ie, administrative) amendments, investigators will wait for IRB/IEC 
approval of the amended protocol before implementing the change(s).  Administrative 
amendments are defined as having no effect on the safet yor phy sical or mental integrity
of subjects, the conduct or management of the trial, the scientific value of the trial or the 
quality  or safet y of IMP(s) used in the trial.  However, a protocol change intended to 
eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects should be implemented im mediately , 
followed b y IRB/IEC notification within 5 working days.  The sponsor (or sponsor’s 
designee) will submit protocol amendments to the FDA or other regulatory  agencies.
When the I RB/IEC, investigators ,and/or the sponsor conclude that the protocol 
amendment substantially  alters the trial design and/or increases the potential risk to the 
subject, the currentl y approved written ICFwill require similar modification.  I n such 
cases, after approval of the new ICF by  [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, repeat informed consent will be 
obtained from subjects in atimely  manner before expecting continued participation in the 
trial.

Confidential -Proprietary Information 99 13Jun 2014Appendix 10 Simpson Angus Scale (SAS)
Circle the appropriate score for each item:
1. GAIT
The patient is examined as he walks into the examining room; his gait, the swing of arms, his 
general posture; all form the basis for an overall score for this item.  This is rated as follows:
0Normal
1Mild diminution in swing while the patient is walking 
2 Obvious d iminution in swing suggesting shoulder rigidity
3Stiff gait with little or no arm swing noticeable
4Rigid gait with arms slightly pronated; or stooped -shuffling gait with propulsion and retropulsion.
2. ARM DROPPI[INVESTIGATOR_657513], 
in a normal subject a stout slap is heard as the arms hit the sides.  In the patient with extreme 
Parkinson's syndrome, the arms fall very slowly.
0Normal, free fall with loud slap and re bound
1Fall slowed slightly with less audible contact [CONTACT_657638]
2Fall slowed, no rebound
3Marked slowing, no slap at all
4Arms fall as though against resistance; as though through glue
3. SHOULDER SHAKING
The subject's arms are bent at a righ t angle at the elbow and taken one at a time by [CONTACT_657639]'s elbow.  The subject's upper arm is 
pushed to and fro and the humerus is externally rotated.  The degree of resistance from normal to 
extreme rigidity is scored as follow s:
0Normal
1Slight stiffness and resistance
2Moderate stiffness and resistance
3Marked rigidity with difficulty in passive movement
4Extreme stiffness and rigidity with almost a frozen joint
4. ELBOW RIGIDITY
The elbow  joints are separately bent at right angles and passively extended and flexed, with the 
subject's biceps observed and simultaneously palpated.  The resistance to the procedure is rated.  
(The presence of cogwheel rigidity is noted separately.)
0Normal
1Slight stiffness and resistance
2Moderate stiffness and resistance
3Marked rigidity with difficulty in passive movement
4Extreme stiffness and rigidity with almost a frozen joint

Protocol [ADDRESS_886436] is held in one hand and then the fin gers held by [CONTACT_4921]'s other hand w ith the w rist 
moved to extension, and both ulnar and radial deviation.  The resistance to this procedure is rated:
0Normal
1Slight stiffness and resistance
2Moderate stiffness and resistance
3Marked rigidity wit h difficulty in passive movement
4Extreme stiffness and rigidity with almost a frozen joint
6. HEAD ROTATION
The patient sits or stands and is told that you are going to move his head from side to side, that it

Actual Attempt:
A potentially s elf-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part 
thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  I f there is any intent/desire to die associated 
with the act, then it can be consid ered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or 
harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no 
injury results, this is considered an attempt.  
Inferring I ntent: Ev en if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or 
circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be 
inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, 
but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred. 
Have you made a suicide attempt?
Have you done anything to harm yourself?
Have you done anything dang erous where you could have died?
What did you do?
Did you______ as a way to end your life? 
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____? 
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to 
relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)? (Self-Injurious Behavior

Interrupted Attempt:   
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) from starting the potentially self -injurious act (if not for 
that, actual attempt would have occurred).
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609].  Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an 
attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by 
[CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it 
is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose 
around neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

Section 2.1, Trial Rationale, Paragraph 2:
Because the management of MDD may  require prolonged administration of ADT(s) with 
or without an augmenting agent, safety  monitoring for longer than the period required to 
achieve initial response is warranted.  In the OPC-[ZIP_CODE] brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657549], phase 2 and phase 3 trials examined the 6 -week safet y 
and efficacy  of OPC-[ZIP_CODE] brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657432].  For phase 2, subjects 
who completed either of the trials had the option to enroll into an open -label rollover trial 
in which they  received OP C-[ZIP_CODE] brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657433] 52 weeks (Trial 331-08-
212).  The current trial (Trial 331 -10-238) provides an open -label rollover option for the

Section 2.2, Dosing Rational e, Paragraph 1:
A dose range of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 0.5 to 3 mg/day OPC-[ZIP_CODE] was selected for the current 
open -label trial to encompass the dose range of the double -blind efficacy  trials (ie, 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1 to 3 mg/day  OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) and to include an option for a reduced dose 
for tolerabilit y (ie, 0.5 mg/day) in order to maximize subject retention in the long -term 
trial.  Therapeutic dose ranges of ADT are based on product labels and clinical practice.  
Data from phase 1 drug interaction trials (Trial 331-08- 207 and Trial 331 -08-208) 
indicated that coadministration of CYP2D6 inhibitors (eg, paroxetine, fluoxetine, and 
duloxetine) with OPC -[ZIP_CODE] brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657551] y hig her plasma 
concentrations of OPC -[ZIP_CODE] brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (up to 2 -fold).  In order to limit the 
potential higher exposure of OPC -[ZIP_CODE] brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_657552], the upper limit of the therapeutic ADT dose is limited to 40 mg for f luoxetine, 
50 mg for paroxetine CR, and 60 mg for duloxetine in the current trial.

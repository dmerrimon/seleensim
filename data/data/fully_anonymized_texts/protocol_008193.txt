Recent research has revealed potent antioxidant and anti -inflammatory effects of elderberry fruit 
preparations. Elderberries have traditionally been used for pain relief, swelling/inflammation, 
urine production, as a laxative, and as a flavoring in food . 
This is one of the botanical agents b eing studied by [CONTACT_33708] P50AT006273.  
2.[ADDRESS_33065] clinical significance and of the 
known and potential risks and bene fits, if any, to human subjects:  
 
Elderberries have been shown in a number of studies to have significant anti -inflammatory and 
antioxidant effects. It is one of the richest sources of anthocyanins, and is rich in vitamins B2, C, 
folic acid, biotin, nicotinic acid, beta -carotene, B6, and pant othenic acid (1). Multiple in vitro 
studies have supported the anti -inflammatory and antioxidant effects of elderberry preparations 
(reviewed in (1)). Animal studies have also revealed significant anti -inflammatory and 
antioxidant effects (2). Population s tudies examining factors that may decrease the risk of 
Alzheimer’s disease, such as the Kame project, have revealed that drinking juices rich in 
polyphenols is one of the most reliable factors conveying decreased risk for Alzheimer’s disease 
(3). Studies e xamining the effects of individual vitamins or isolated nutritional factors have 
yielded mixed results in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, but recent 
evidence suggests that combinations of such factors may yield synergistic benefits (4). Research 
suggests that combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33699] 12 -24 months (5). Therefore, with the  broad range of potential neuroprotective 
agents contained in elderberry preparations, this seems an ideal agent for utilization in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_33700]’s disease. No 
controlled trial of e lderberry has ever been done previously in Alzheimer’s or MCI.  
In our previous research, we examined the sensitivity of our visuospatial problem solving task 
for detecting change in cognitive performance with treatment in MCI patients. Twenty -two

3 
 subjects with MCI were recruited for our study with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) (22,23) 
score of 0.5, and a Folstein Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) (24) score of at least 24. 
At the first visit, all subjects were given the MMSE in order to assess global  function across 
several domains including memory, and the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (25) to assess verbal 
memory, as well as non -memory tasks including the [LOCATION_011] Naming Test (BNT) (26) (primarily 
considered as assessing language (naming)), Rey Complex  Figure copying (Rey CFT) (27 -29) 
(primarily considered as assessing visuospatial ability), a series of anagrams (primarily 
considered as assessing verbal and divergent cognitive flexibility) (30) (Rearrange these letters to 
form an English word: OGRF, RDW O, FALC, LANI, MHBTU, HTRSI, DSLEI, TMLAE), and 
the visuospatial problem solving battery (VPS) adapted from the “matchstick” problems (15, 31). 
As with our previous work with these types of tasks (14,30), solution latencies were recorded for 
performance on  both. There was no significant difference between the two groups at baseline. 
However, at one year, the treated group performed significantly better on their change scores 
than the not treated group for the VPS task (p=0.038). Of interest, there were also  trends detected 
for better change scores in the treated group for the Rey CFT, BNT, anagrams, and importantly, 
the IADL. As with previous research (13), no effect was observed on the memory task, the 
HVLT (paper in preparation). We wish to determine the p otential effects of elderberry juice on 
preserving cognitive functioning in a group of people at risk for cognitive impairments in the 
future.  
2.3 Description of and justification for the route of administration, dosage, dosage r egimen, and 
treatment period(s):  
 
Twenty of the subjects will be randomly assigned to receive [ADDRESS_33066]. Beversdorf’s lab who is 
otherwise uninvolved in the study,  will keep the unblinding code in case a nee d arises to break 
the code for clinical purposes  or preliminary data analyses . Subjects will be given sufficient juice  
at each visit to last until the next visit. They will be provided a liquid medicine measuring spoon 
and instructed to measure out 5ml per dose. Subjects and caregivers will be asked to check each 
dose on a dose log, and bring back the used juice containers at each visit to confirm that a proper 
amou nt has been taken, as monitored by [CONTACT_33709]. Subjects taking less than 75% of the 
scheduled dose will be excluded.  
After initiation of elderberry juice or control, subjects will be retested at 12 weeks, visit 2, (the 
timeframe that revealed significant  effects with other anthocyanin -rich fruit preparations (33,34), 
6 months, visit 3, and (pending resubmission for second year of support) [ADDRESS_33067]. Additionally at visits 2, 3, and 4 subjects will also be 
assessed with the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), which is a valid and reliable 
research tool for overall assessment of salient changes in pati ents (39), in which the blinded 
clinician rates the degree of change in the patient from the beginning of the study. The 
subject/caregiver will be given time to ask any questions and the clinician will be sure the 
subject/caregiver understands all instruct ions before dispensing liquid.  
2.4 A statement that the trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol : 
 
All researchers and clinicians taking part in this study will conduct all practices in compliance 
with this protocol, proceed under Good Clin ical Practice (GCP), and follow all regulatory 
requirements outlined by [CONTACT_33710], State, and Federal agencies.   
 
2.5 Description of the population to be studied:  
 
When examining the impact of an agent that acts on inflammation and has antioxidant properties, 
targeting neuroprotection, it is important to identify and treat patients at the earliest stage. 
Therefore, we propose to investigate the effects of elderberry juice in patients with mild 
cognitive impairment, MCI. MCI is characterized by [CONTACT_33711] (6,7). Patients with this diagnosis are at significantly increased risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_33701] (8 -10). Most researchers  propose MCI as the mildest endpoint on the spectrum of 
Alzheimer’s disease (9). With the recent advances in treatment options for Alzheimer’s disease, 
much attention has been directed at intervention at earlier stages. Recent research has focused on 
wheth er or not agents may delay the progression from MCI to dementia (11, 12). In addition to 
any delay in or prevention of progression, it would also be of interest to determine whether 
agents result in any cognitive benefits for MCI patients. Studies have exa mined to effects of 
cholinesterase inhibitors, the first type of drug on the market for Alzheimer’s disease, on 
cognition and global assessment outcomes in MCI, and have revealed effects on global 
assessment, psychomotor speed, and attention, but not on sp ecific memory tasks (13).  
Inclusion criteria:  CDR score of 0.[ADDRESS_33068] no known 
sensitivity to elderberry products, or presence of any health condition that in the clinical 
experience of the investigators might impair their ability to complete the study. Recruited 
subjects will be aged 50 or more.  
Exclusion criteria:  Known history of sensitivity to elderberry products.  Known allergy to 
honeysuckle.  Current diagnosis of diabetes. Bleeding disorder. Currently pregn ant. Currently 
making changes to other drugs that might affect cognitive performance (subjects showing the 
greatest cognitive decline and other signs of Alzheimer's disease may be prescribed 
cholinesterase inhibitors as this is a standard of care for Alzhe imer's disease but not 
MCI).  Presence of any condition the health professional believes will impair ability to complete

 study procedures (ex. terminal illness, comorbid major psychiatric disorders such as 
schizophrenia, or drug abuse).  Potentially confound ing neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. MS).  
Between [CONTACT_33713] and [CONTACT_33714]'s clinics at the University of  Missouri Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], there are 
at least [ADDRESS_33069] completed fellowships in Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology, resulting in special skills in 
the neurocognitive assessment of patients with memory loss. Should the need arise, we will also 
recruit from other aging clinics in the area.

3. Trial Objectives and Purpose  
 
Our aim is to begin to explore the potential translational impact of elderberry juice, a botanical 
agent. To achieve this, we will perform a pi[INVESTIGATOR_33703] (MCI). It is critical to determine whether the course of development of 
Alzheimer’s can be altered in this high -risk population. Our primary outcome measure will be 
visuospatial problem solving, as this has been shown to be sensitive to drug effects in MCI. We 
will also track other cognitive outcomes as well as the incidence of progression to dementia. 
Furthermore, we will examine inflammatory markers to begin to explore the potential 
mechanism of its effect.  The results of this study will yield pi[INVESTIGATOR_33704] a larger clinical trial for which external funds will be sought.  
4. Trial Design  
 
4.1 A specific sta tement of the primary endpoints:  
 
Subjects will be assessed for changes in cognitive performance measures: CDR (for 
deter mination of progression to dementia), MMSE (general cognition), IADL (functional 
ability), HVLT (memory), BNT (language), Rey CFT (spatial function), anagrams (verbal 
cognitive flexibility), and VPS (spatial cognitive flexibility) .  
 
4.2 A description of t he type/ design of trial:  
 
Double -blinded placebo -controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]  
 
4.3 A description of the measur es taken to minimize/avoid bias:  
 
University of Missouri  
Health Sciences IRB  
 
[ADDRESS_33081]. Beversdorf’s lab who is otherwise 
uninvolved in the study,  will keep the unblinding code in case a need arises to break  the code for 
clinical purposes or preliminary data  analyses . 
 
4.4 A description of the trial treatment(s) and the dosage and dosage regimen of the 
investigational product(s ): 
 
Subjects will drink [ADDRESS_33082] until the next visit. Juice containers will be clearly 
labeled indicating the contents as a research supplement with directions advising subjects of dose 
schedule.  Subjects and caregivers will also be asked to check each dose on a dose lo g (indicating 
day of trial, date, time, and  dose), and will bring  the juice containers to  the next visit to confirm 
that a proper amount has been administered.  
 
 
4.[ADDRESS_33083] Involvement:  
 
Prior to initiation of elderberry juice or placebo, baseline visit 1, subjects will be assessed with 
the CDR (for determination of progression to dementia), MMSE (general cognition), IADL 
(functional ability), HVLT (memory), BNT (language), Rey CFT (spatia l function), anagrams 
(verbal cognitive flexibility), and VPS (spatial cognitive flexibility). They will also be 
administered a Food Frequency Questionnaire to determine any individual differences in diet that 
might be relevant to the current study’s findi ngs. After initiation of elderberry juice or control, 
subjects will be retested at 12 weeks, visit 2, (the timeframe that revealed significant effects with 
other anthocyanin -rich fruit preparations (33,34), 6 months, visit 3, and (pending resubmission 
for second year of support) 12 months, visit 4. At each visit following baseline the Clinical 
Global Impression of Change (CGIC)  will also be administered . Blood samples (30mL) will  be 
obtained at baseline  and each time point in the trial  to determine  immunolo gical markers, [ADDRESS_33084] progresses through all time points.  
 
4.6 Maintenance of tria l treatment randomization codes:  
 
The clinicians will be blinded as to group, as will be the assessor. Neetu Nair, a graduate student 
in [CONTACT_33715]’s lab who is otherwise uninvolved in the study,  will keep the unblinding code 
in case a need arises to break the code for clinical purpose s or preliminary data analyses . This 
will be securely stored in h er lab space at [ADDRESS_33085]  data will be coded to a 
study specific code and all identifying information will be stored on a separate secure server.  
 
6.2 The number of subjects planned to be enrolled  and r eason for choice of sample size : 
 
 In other research examining the effects of other anthocyane -rich fruit extracts on MCI, a 
significant effect was revealed on word list memory with 12 subjects (33). In this study, the 
subjects in the treatment group improved their word list memory scores from 35.[ADDRESS_33086] deviation of less than 2. Based upon this data, the power of a study at the level of 
α=0.008 (adjusted for multiple measures for the various cognitive tasks) with a sample of [ADDRESS_33087] that the 
sample size of 20 per group (total 40) would be sufficient to reveal effects on word list memory 
(HVLT), as well as our other cognitive and behavioral outcome measures (VPS, MMSE, Rey 
CFT, BNT, and IA DL), if their performance follows the same response as observed with word 
list memory. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_33705], subsequent studies.  
[CONTACT_33715] and [CONTACT_33716] see at least [ADDRESS_33088] expressed a willingness to participate in research. We may need to enroll 
up to  60 subjects  to obtain a sufficient set of  40.  
6.3 The se lection of subjects  to be included in the analyses:  
 
Subjects taking less than 75% of the scheduled dose or failing to complete at least one follow -up 
session will be excluded from analysis.  
7. Potential Risks Related to Drug  
 
The elderberry can cause problems for people with a known allergy in the Caprifoliaceae  family 
(honeysuckle). The related side effects are given below.  
▪ There are reports of gastrointestinal distress, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and 
weakness after drinking elderberry juice made from crushed leaves, stems, and uncooked 
elderberries. Notably, toxicity typi[INVESTIGATOR_33706].  
▪ In theory, high doses or long -term use of elder flowers may have diuretic (urine -
producing) effects. People taking diuretics or drugs that interact with diuretics should use 
caution w hen taking products containing elder.  
▪ Elder may also lower blood sugar levels. Dizziness, headache, convulsions, and rapid 
heart rate have also been reported.  
8. Data Handling and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_33707] M741 in the 
Center for Translational Neuroscience in the University of Missouri School of Medicine  and on a 
secure server identified by a code number only. T he code key wil l be kept on a separate secure 
server . Identifiable information contained in the records will not be given to anyone not

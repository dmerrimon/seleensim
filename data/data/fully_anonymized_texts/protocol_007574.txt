Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_525472] briefly stating the problem, the research 
hypothesis, and the importance of the research.  
 
X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X -ALD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease, is caused by a 
defect in the ABCD1 gene. The disease has multiple phenotypes, but the most common adult form is adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), which presents as a slowly progressing spastic paraparesis with  
sensory and autonomic dysfunction. In a pre vious study we linked corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_88735] (CST) and 
Dorsal  Column (DC) abnormalities to lower extremity sensory loss and weakness in men with 
AMN; however,  there have been no studies evaluating these relationships in woman heterozygote 
carriers (i.e., women with AMN). It is unknown, in women with AMN, how the pattern of damage in the brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_416858]. While conventional  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have been used to 
evaluate progression of X -ALD  disease burden, attempts at correlating clinical disability with 
axonal injury have had limited success due  to clinical rating scales that do not adequately measure 
all aspects of the disease, coupled with an  inability  for routine imaging techniques to quantify 
relevant fiber tracts in the brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. We  propose to comprehensively evaluate the CST 
and DC across the brain and cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_416859]. We hypothesize that: 1) tract -specific magnetization transfer 
imaging (MTI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will predict specific  sensory and motor 
impairments (i.e., sensory loss and weakness) and disability; and 2) tract -specific MTI and  DTI 
will predict who is likely to respond best to progressive resistive training (PRT). For this project we are using a rigorous  biologic approach that combines clinical evaluation, neuroimaging, and 
measures of impairment and  disability to provide a more  precise prognosis in terms of physical 
disability and to predict who is likely to  respond to a physical intervention. We predict that many 
of the women will improve their strength and  function following the PRT program. Specifically, 
we predict that axonal loss will be associated with  irreversible disability. By [CONTACT_22242], 
demyelination may have potentially reversible injuries that would  benefit from PRT in improving 
disability.  The linking of this information will not only be important for better  defining disability 
in women heterozygote carriers of AMN but it will also help to guide physicians and rehabilitation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_416860], as well as for  
optimizing outcomes for future neuroprotective pharmacological interventions.  
 
2. Objectives  (include all primary and secondary objectives)  
 Primary objectives:  
1) To determine to what extent pathological abnormalities (i.e., MT measures of demyelination, and DTI measures of axonal integrity) are associated w ith sensory and motor impairments and 
locomotor patterns (i.e., kinematic walking measures and quantitative motor impairments) in women with AMN.  
2) To determine the extent to which tract specific anatomy (demyelination, axonal loss) predict who will respond best to three months of progressive resistance training (PRT) in female  
carriers.

 3. Background  (briefly describe  pre-clinical and clinical data, current experience with procedures, 
drug or device, and an y other relevant information to justify the research ) 
 
Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) is the adult phenotype of X -linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X -
ALD), a  progressive disorder that affects the nervous system, adrenal cortex and testes due to a 
defect in the gene ABCD1, which has been mapped to Xq28. Adult onset of  symptoms of disease 
not only occurs in 60% of males with the X -ALD mutation in their most productive years of life but 
also 50% of female  carriers, though often a decade later than that of the men.  Diagnosis and 
treatment studies for AMN  have principally focused on men despi[INVESTIGATOR_416861]. AMN is  characterized by [CONTACT_416876] -inflammatory axonopathy in the 
corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] (CST) and Dorsal  Column- Medial Lemniscal (DC -ML) tracts of the brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_36232]. There is additi onal evidence of  demyelination caused by [CONTACT_416877]. AMN including women carriers have been characterized as having primarily lower extremity spasticity, with abnormalities in vibration  sensation, strength, walking, and balance that 
progress during [ADDRESS_525473] symptoms that are as severe as the men. There are currently no medical treatment options 
available for women carriers; these patients have dismal ho pes for improvement, except with 
rehabilitation. There is a glaring need for more  knowledge and more effective rehabilitative 
treatment ap proaches for women ALD carriers.  
 Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques along with the Loes scale (i.e., categorical 
rating scale) have been used to  evaluate progression of X -ALD disease burden in children with 
moderate success. Pathologic studies  show that dying back of axonal loss is a primary pathogenic 
mechanism of AMN and much of the  permanent disability  results from axonal damage.  However, 
attempts at correlating clinical disability  with axonal injury have had limited success due to clinical 
rating scales that do not adequately measure all aspects of the disease, coupled with an inability for routine ima ging techniques to depi[INVESTIGATOR_416862]. Our preliminary data show that we can distinguish female carriers from control subjects using novel techniques such as magnetization transfer (MT) imaging.  In addition, w e have previously 
shown that damage measured using tract specific MRI, specifically magnetization transfer and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) correlates with physical impairments in individuals with the degenerative disease of multiple sclerosi s. 
 In conjunction with advanced DTI and MT metrics developed at the Kirby [CONTACT_416878], w e plan to capi[INVESTIGATOR_416863] , having 
thorough experience with them in assessing  spasticity, ataxia, sensation, and muscle strength in 
individuals with AMN and in individuals with multiple sclerosis. We predict that MT imaging and DTI, which measure the integrity of white matter and fiber tracts in the brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], will aid in understanding t he extent to which  axonal/myelin anatomy are associated with sensory and 
motor impairments as well as locomotor  patterns with the goal of understanding how to treat 
physical disability more effectively.

United Leukodystrophy Foundation (ULF) websites. 
 
Women who contact [CONTACT_416879] a phone screening to determine eligibility.  During the 
telephone screening they will be asked, “A re you or do you think you might be pregnant?” If 
they are pregnant they are not eligible for the study. They will also be asked if there are any 
reasons that would prevent them from participating in an exercise program. If yes, they will be determined ine ligible to participate. If they are eligible we will schedule them for their initial 
testing session. If they are not interested in participating or found to be ineligible we will 
destroy any information we have collected from them.  
 
For healthy control subjects.  
We will use posted advertisements posted in the Kennedy Krieger and in the planned fitness 
facilities (i.e., Curves) . We will also post an announcement on the webpages of the Kennedy 
Krieger and ULF. Interested subjects will be told to contact [CONTACT_941] r esearch coordinator for a 
telephone screening.  If they are found to be eligible we will schedule them for their initial testing session.  If they are found to be ineligible we will destroy any information we have 
collected from them.  
 
Women will be screen ed during a phone interview using a standardized script. Information on 
the woman will be collected at that time, but if found to be ineligible or she chooses not to 
participate this information will be destroyed.  
 
Women who are eligible will be scheduled  for a baseline assessment.  Baseline assessment will 
consist of a standardized sensorimotor examination including a gait assessment, MRI of the 
brain and cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], and exercis e instruction.  Screening medical information will be 
reviewed at th e visit, including a question about whether the subject might be pregnant.  I f there 
are questions or concerns about eligibility or the instituti on of an exercise program , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_416864] a determination of participation.  
 
We will e xamine subjects at the level of functional disability (i.e. clinical rating scales), at the 
level of  impairment (i.e., strength  and sensation), and at the level of anatomy (i.e., MTI  and 
DTI).  The general paradigm includes four parts, requiring 1.[ADDRESS_525475] to be

 Laboratory  (requiring one hour) . We will allow rest breaks as needed by [CONTACT_143413]. Parts 
1, 2, and 3 will be conducted at the Motion Analysis Laboratory located in KKI . All subjects will 
participate in 3 testing visits, one at baseline, one at 12 weeks and one at 18 weeks from the baseline 
visit. All subjects will be asked to participate in parts 1 -4 at the baseline visit, and only parts 1 and 2 
during visits 2 and 3.  
 
 Thus, for t esting the breakdown for the time is as follow s: 
Baseline visit: [ADDRESS_525476], 1 hr. exercise instruction, 1 hr. MRI scan  
12th week  visit: [ADDRESS_525477]  
18th week visit: [ADDRESS_525478] 
clinical measures of sensation (vibration, proprioception), strength, tone (Modified Ashworth), 
and passive range of motion.  In addition, we will use standardized quantitative scales to evaluate walking, ataxia, and overall di sease impairment in  these individuals . Lastly, self report 
measures of quality of life and pain will be used.  
 
After the functional assessment , locomotion will be evaluated .  Each subject will be asked to 
walk several times across a [ADDRESS_525479] to eva luate locomotion, and to stand still on a force 
plate to evaluate balance; all movements will be done in the M otion A nalysis Laboratory at the 
Kennedy Krieger Institute.  To track walking we will use a GaitRite System.  This is a walkway that has pressure activated sensors that measure the temporal (timing) and spatial (two dimension geometric position) parameters of the foot as it lands on its pressure activated sensors.  For balance, a vital component of locomotion, we will assess the extent of postural 
sway while standing on a static force plate.  The force plate is embedded in the floor of the 
laboratory and is very sensitive to small amounts of movement that are often missed by [CONTACT_4171].  Force plate data will be collected at 1000HZ using a Kistler 92 81 force plate 
(Kistler Instrument Corp., Switzerland).   During these tasks we may also evaluate muscle activity using electrodes to record surface electromyography (EMG) signals.  Markers will be pasted on the surface of the skin over relevant muscle groups.  Data from the EMG markers will be collected at 1000Hz and time locked using Optotra k software.  During all movements an 
examiner will guard each subject and rest breaks will be given as needed.   
 
To begin the exercise intervention  a physical or occu pational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_416865], flexibility, and level of activity.  Then subjects will be given an exercise program to follow at a designated fitness  facility.

resistance training program will consist of 12 weeks of guided resistance training  3 times

member of  the research team (i.e., a physical or occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_416867]) 
will contact [CONTACT_416881] 12 weeks of the study to 
answer any questions and encourage subjects to continue with their exe rcise program.  
Compliance will be tracked by  [CONTACT_68811] (i.e., Curves) . They will send the PI [INVESTIGATOR_416868]. Subjects will also be given an

 exercise log to complete. If participants mis s a training session a substitute session will be 
arranged on an alternate day.  
 
Subjects will also go through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI ) in the F.M. Kirby [CONTACT_416882].  Prior to the start of imaging each subject will be a sked to 
complete a standard questionnaire, this will ensure that the subject is able to safely enter the area 
where the MRI scan will take place.  Subjects will undergo imaging without contrast and without sedation.   For this study we will use a 3T Philip s GyroscanNT (Best, The Netherlands) 
system to obtain high -resolution anatomical brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_416869].  In the brain and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will be performed as well as magnetization transfer (MT).   Conventional brain and s pi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] (STIR, T1w, T2w) sagittal and axial images may also 
be acquired.  The total scanning time will be approximately 1  hour . 
 Analysis of the DTI images will be done us ing custom written software (DTI -Studio)  or custom 
Matlab programs  to calculate th e diffusion tensor variables at each pi[INVESTIGATOR_416870] 2D color 
maps of white matter pathways.  Analysis of MT  will be calculated on a voxel by [CONTACT_416883]:  MTR=1- S/S

b. Study duration and number of study visits required of research participant s. 
 Each testing session will require about 1.5 hours of time , with one session requiring 3.5 hours of 
time due to a 1 -hour MRI scan and an hour for exercise instruction. All  subjects will be tested a 
total of three times: baseline, [ADDRESS_525481] current therapy

  Study Statistics  
a. Primary outcome variable.  Primary outcome variables for sensorimotor impairments include: vibration sensation, strength  
(average values from the hip and ankle muscles , both flexion and extension , will be used ), and 
spasticity from the ankle  flexo r/extensor muscles bilaterally.  
 The primary variables of interest for white matter integrity in this analysis will be fractional anisotropy  (FA) and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR).  
 Other primary outcome variables include correlations  to determine relationships between 
sensorimotor impairments and between white matter integrity variables in the tracts of interest.  
Multiple regression analysis we will also be used determine to what extent sensorimotor 
impairments are  related to white matter integrity variables.  
 The primary outcome variable for the exercise intervention we will calculate a functional composite score  (FS) for each person that will incorporate 4 tests that functionally challenge the 
lower extremity: 1) sit to stand, 2) Up and Go test, 3) 25- foot timed walk, and 4) 6- minute walk 
test. 
 
b. Secondary outcome variables . 
 
To determine  response to three months of the exercise intervention:  
1.  We will calculate p re- to post - trial differences between groups using an unpaired t test. 
Changes between pre - and post -trial within groups will also be compared with paired t tests.

compared with paired t tests.  [(Exercise followup -Exercise post) vs (Exercise post-Exercise pre)], will be 
evaluated.  
3.  To evaluate possible time and group interactions during the intervention within g roups we 
will use multivariate ANOVA’s.  Significant interactions will be evaluated with a mixed effects 
linear regression.  
4. To determine change in EDSS scores over each session we will use with Wilcoxon signed rank test.  
5. To determine whether specific changes in  the primary outcome measures are predicted by [CONTACT_416885] (i.e., MTR and FA) we will determine how much each impairment changed from the pre - to post - session.  
6.  We will conduct separate correlations to determine the relationship between the primary outcomes, and extent of demyelination and axonal loss pre - and post -intervention. 
7.  Multiple regression analyses will also be used to determine which pattern of white matter damage (i.e., demyelinat ion, axonal loss) best predicts hip flexion and FS. 
 
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and inte rim data analysis.  
 Preliminary studies of heterozygote data from our laboratory suggest that a minimum of 12 subjects are needed to obtain ad equate statistical power. Hip flexion strength data  from female 
carriers are: 11.2  ± 4.[ADDRESS_525484] added  25% to this total. Therefore, our initial plan is to have [ADDRESS_525485]  and 15 healthy controls . All power  calculations assume two -
tailed tests with α  = 0.05. Analysis will be done using Statistica software  (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa 
OK) or Stata (StataCorp) . 
 
d. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  None.  
 
7. Risks  
a. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expected frequency.  
 The potential risks i n this study are very low.  The study is entirely non- invasive.  Subjects may 
become fatigued or lose their balance during walking or standing and they may have slight muscle soreness, this has occurred very rarely in past studies. There is a potential that subjects may have an allergy/sensitivity to the tape used for marker placement, in this situation we will use a stocking net that we have in the lab to hold the marker in place instead of tape. Subjects may become uncomfortable while in the MRI scanner. Any incidental findings on MRI will be provided to the patient by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Raymond by [CONTACT_416886] a clinical visit.  If there are new findings the individual will be assisted in obtaining follow up care. There is a potential risk of time commitment (missing work or school) and therefore we will be flexible and practical  in scheduling convenient appointments.

may be helpful in guiding subjects toward further rehabilitation steps.  In a previous study we linked corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_416873]; there have  been no studies evaluating these relationships in female carriers 
(i.e., women with AMN). It is unknown, in women with AMN, how the pattern of damage in the

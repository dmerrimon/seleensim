Protocol Title:   A Phase 3, Randomized, Double -Blind Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT -494) to 
Placebo in Subjects w ith Moderately to Severely Active Rh eumatoid Arthritis Who Are on a Stable Dose 
of Conventional Synthetic Disease -Modifying Anti -Rheumatic Drugs (csDMARDs) and Have an 
Inadequate Response to csDMARDs
Objective s:  
Period 1
1.To compare the efficacy of upadacitinib 30 mg once daily (QD) and 15 mg QD versus placebo for 
the treatment of signs and symptoms of subjects with moderately to severely active rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) who are on a stable dose of conventional synthetic disease -modifying anti -rheum atic 
drugs (csDMARDs) and have an inade quate response to csDMARDs.
2.To compare the safety and tolerability of upadacitinib [ADDRESS_1136390] completed Period 1.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 230
Study Population:   
Adult female and male subjects who are at least 18 years of age with a diagnosis of RA for ≥ 3 months 
who also fulfill the 2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for 
RA.  Eligible study subjects must have ≥ 6 swollen joints (based on 6 6 joint counts) and ≥ 6 tender joints 
(based on 68 joint counts) at Screening and Baseline Visits, and high -sensitivity C -reactive protein 
(hsCRP) ≥ 3 mg/L (central lab) at Screening.  Subjects must have been on a stable dose of csDMARD 
therapy (restricted to methotrexate [MTX], chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or 
leflunomide) for ≥ [ADDRESS_1136391] dose of study drug.  Subjects w ith inadequate response to 
hydroxychloroquine and/or chloroquine can only be included if they also faile d MTX, sulfasalazine, or 
leflunomide.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately [ADDRESS_1136392] 2015 -003332 -13
10
Methodology:   
This is a Phase [ADDRESS_1136393] completed Period 1.  Starting with Amendment 6, all subjects will receive open -label 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD, including those currently on upadacitinib 30 mg QD.
The study duration will include a 35 -day screening period; a 12 -week randomized, double -blind, 
parallel -group, placebo controlled treatment period (Period 1); a 248 w eek blinded long -term extension 
period (Period 2); and a 30 -day follow -up period.
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to one of four treatment 
groups:  
Group 1:  Upadacitinib 30 mg QD (N = 200) (Period 1) →Upadacitinib 30 mg QD (Period 2)
Group 2:  Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (N = 200) (Period 1) →Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Period 2)
Group 3:  Placebo (N = 100) (Period 1) → Upadacitinib 30 mg QD (Period 2)
Group 4:  Placebo (N = 100) (Period 1) → Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Period 2)
Subjects must have been on a stable dose of csDMARD(s) for ≥ [ADDRESS_1136394] remain on a stable dose until Week 24; the csDMARD dose may be decreased only for 
safety reasons.  Starting at Week 24 (after Week [ADDRESS_1136395] been performed), initiation of or 
change in corticosteroids, non -steroidal an ti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, or adding or 
increasing doses of csDMARDs (concomitant use of up to 2 csDMARDs except the combination of 
MTX and leflunomide) is allowed as per local label.
Subjects with prior exposure to at most one biologic disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drug (bDMARD) 
for RA may be enrolled in the study (up to 20% of total number of subjects) after the required w ashout 
period is satisfied and if they have limited exposure (< 3 months), OR response to bDMARD but had to 
discontinue that bDMARD due to intolerability (regardless of treatment duration).  These subjects w ill be 
equally stratified across all treatment groups.  Subjects who are considered bDMARD inadequate 
responders, as determined by [CONTACT_737], are not elig ible.
Subjects who complete the Week 12 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the blinded long -term extension 
portion of the study, Period 2 (248 w eeks).  Subjects who are assigned to upadacitinib treatment groups 
in Period [ADDRESS_1136396] fails to meet Low Disease Activity (LDA) criterion (LDA defined as CDAI 
≤10) invest igator should adjust the subject's background RA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
An unblinded analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Period 1 (Week 12) for the 
purpose of regulatory submission.  Study sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duratio n of the 
study.

Period 1 Efficacy
Analysis of the Prim ary and Key Secondary Endpoints:
Com parisons of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be made between each 
upadacitinib group and the combined placebo groups.  The overall type I error rate of the primary and 
ranked key secondary endpoints for the two doses will be strongly controlled.
For binary endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be reported for each treatment group.  Pairw ise 
comparisons between each upadacitinib group and the comb ined placebo groups w ill be conducted using 
the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusting for main stratification factors.  
For continuous endpoints, the mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be reported for each 
treatment group.  Pairw ise compari sons betw een each of the upadacitinib treatment groups and the 
combined placebo groups w ill be carried out using the analysis of covariance model with treatment group 
as the fixed factor, and the corresponding baseline value and the main stratification fac tors as the 
covariates.
Non-responder imputation approach w ill serve as the primary analysis approach for key binary endpoints 
and multiple imputation will serve as the primary analysis approach for key continuous endpoints.  
Sensitivity analyses based on observed cases approach w ill also be conducted for key endpoints.

3.0 Introduction
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic s ystemic inflammatory  disease of unknown 
etiology .  The hallmark feature of RA is an inflammatory  process manifested by  [CONTACT_176409], 
deformity , and disability .  Left untreated, or inadequately  treated, progressive functional 
impairment with increasing disability  occurs leading to a reduction in quality  of life.  The 
prevalence of RA in the general population is approximately  1%, and incr eases with age 
in both genders, with women being more prone to developi[INVESTIGATOR_176356].  Earl y 
therap y with disease -modify ing anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is the standard of care, 
including conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) (e.g., methotrexate [MTX] , 
sulfasalazine, hy droxy chloroquine, and leflunomide), and biologic DMARDs 
(bDMARDs) (e.g., anti -tumor necrosis factor [TNF] and non
-anti-TNF biologics).
The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommends a Treat -to-Target 
(T2T) approach to initiate therap y immediatel y after diagnosis of RA with a goal of 
achieving clinical remission (CR) or low disease activity  (LDA), as these are associated 
with improved long -term outcomes.1-[ADDRESS_1136423] been developed.  The 2010 American College 
of Rheumatology  (ACR)/EULAR classifi cation criteria redefined the paradigm of RA b y 
focusing on features at earlier stages of disease that are associated with persistent and/or 
erosive disease, rather than defining the disease by [CONTACT_176410] -stage features.[ADDRESS_1136424] 2015 -003332 -13

JAK Inhibitor
Evidence suggests that inhibition of Janus kinase (JAK) -mediated pathway s is a 
promising approach for the treatment of patients with this chronic disease.8  [COMPANY_013] is 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a small molecule inhibitor of JAK, upadacitinib, that may address the current 
needs.
The JAK f amily  is composed of 4 famil y members:  JAK1, 2, 3, and Tyrosine kinase 2 
(Tyk2).  These cy toplasmic ty rosine kinases are associated with membrane cy tokine 
receptors such as common gamma -chain receptors and the gly coprotein 
130transmembrane proteins.[ADDRESS_1136425] in this class, has been approved in the 
[LOCATION_002] and in other countries for treating moderatel y to severel y active RA 
patients.  Although t ofacitinib, a non -selective JAK inhibitor, improves the clinical signs 
and sy mptoms, and inhibits structural progression in RA patients, questions regarding the 
safet y profile remain, including serious infections, herpes zoster reactivation, 
malignancies, and hematologic adverse events (AEs).
The second generation of JAK inhibitors, with different selectivity  profiles against JAK1, 
JAK2, JAK3, and Ty k2, are in development.[ADDRESS_1136426] s (i.e., interleukin -6) without causing excessive anemia due to its 
reduced activity  against JAK2 (IC [ZIP_CODE] nM), which is essential for ery thropoietin 
signaling.  Upadacitinib is also less potent against JAK3 (I C502.3 µM), an important 
component of ly mphocy te activation and function.  As such, treatment with upadacitinib, 
a selective JAK1 inhibitor with reduced JAK3 inhib ition, could result in a decreased risk 
for infection (including viral reactivation) and/or malignancy compared to a pan JAK 
inhibitor or less selective JAK inhibitors.
Phase 2 Studies with Upadacitinib
The Phase 2 program for upadacitinib consisted of 2 r andomized controlled trials (RCTs), 
both on stable background MTX therap y, in subjects with moderatel y to severel y active 
RA and one open -label extension (OL E) stud y (Study M13 -538; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) for those 
subjects who had completed either one of the RCTs. Study  M13 -550 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
enrolled subjects who had an inadequate response to anti -TNF therap y and 
Study M13 -537 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) enrolled subjects who had shown an inadequate 
response to MTX.  A total of 4 twice dail y (BID) and 1 once dail y (QD) dose regi mens of 
upadacitinib immediate release capsules (3 mg BID, 6 mg BID, 12 mg BID, 18 mg BID, 
and 24 mg QD) were evaluated.
In TNF -inadequate responder (TNF -IR) subjects, who represent the population with the 
greatest unmet need, the primary  endpoint of ACR20 response rate at Week 12 was 
significantl y greater at all doses of upadacitinib (up to 73%) compared with placebo 
(35%).  In addition, numericall y higher proportions of subjects achieved ACR50 and 
ACR70 responses and LDA (based on Disease Activity  Score [ DAS]28 C -Reactive 
Protein [CRP] and Clinical Disease Activity Index [CDAI ]) in the upadacitinib dose 
groups versus placebo.
In MTX -inadequate responder (MTX -IR) subjects, the primary  endpoint of ACR20 
response rate at Week 12 was significantly greater (up to 82%) at all but the lowest dose  
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_1136427] 2015 -003332 -13
30
of upadacitinib compared with placebo (50%).  At all doses of upadacitinib compared to 
placebo, significantl y higher proportions of subjects achieved LDA and CR at Week 12.
Safety  data from these two studies (N = 575) sho wed that the ty pes and frequencies of 
AEs during upadacitinib treatment were consistent with subjects with moderatel y to 
severel y active RA receiving immunomodulatory  therapy .  The incidences of AEs were 
numericall y higher in the upadacitinib dose groups, with a trend toward higher rates with 
higher doses of upadacitinib.  The most frequentl y reported AEs ( ≥ 5%) in the 
upadacitinib treated subjects were urinary  tract infection, headache, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_40947], and nausea.  There were 6 subjects (1.3% of total combined populations) with 
herpes zoster reactivation distributed across the upadacitinib dose groups, and 2 subjects 
(1.9%) in the placebo groups.  I n these two [ADDRESS_1136428] reported non -
melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma) and [ADDRESS_1136429] 
was diagnosed with lung cancer after the final scheduled visit, and subsequently died 
14weeks after stud y completion.  These events were reported b y the Investigators as not 
possibly  related to study  drug.  Elevations of liver function tests were sporadic with no 
clear dose -response relationship observed.  As observed with other JAK inhibitors, 
treatment with upadacitinib result ed in an increase in lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (low -density  lipoprotein 
cholesterol [L DL-C] and high- densit y lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL -C]).  Among subjects 
with laboratory  evidence of sy stemic inflammation (as evidenced b y high -sensitivity  
C-reactive protein [hsCRP] > upper limit of normal [UL N]), treatment with lower doses 
of upadacitinib (3 mg BID and 6 mg BID) was associated with improvements in mean 
hemoglobin relative to placebo.  At higher doses, there was a reduction in mean 
hemoglobin; however, the mean hemoglobin levels remained within normal range 
throughout the treatment period.

3.2 Benefits and Risks
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_96631] y of various RA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including csDMARDs and bDMARDs, 
many  patients still do not respond adequatel y to these treatments, or gradually lose 
response over time.  Upadacitinib is a novel selective JAK1 inhibitor with the ability  to 
decrease joint inflammation and damage mediated by  [CONTACT_166527]1 signaling while having 
minimal inhibitory  effects on JAK2 and JAK3.  This could potentially  minimize some of 
the reported safet y concerns with non -selective JAK inhi bition which are thought to be 
mediated b y inhibition of JAK2 and JAK3 signaling pathways.  The Phase 2 program 
with upadacitinib demonstrated efficacy  for improvement in signs and s ymptoms of RA 
and the safety  results were consistent with those known to b e associated with JAK 
inhibition.13-21  Taken together, the safet y and efficacy data from the Phase 2 program 
support further development of upadacitinib in Phase 3 in subjects with RA.
In view of the COVI D-19 pandemic, the benefit:risk profile of various

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase [ADDRESS_1136432] completed Period 1.  Starting with Amendment 6, all subjects will receive open -
label upadacitinib 15 mg QD, including those currently on upadacitinib 30 mg QD.  
The study  is designed to enroll approximately  600 subjects at approximately  
230study centers worldwide 
to meet scientific and regulatory  objectives without enrolling 
an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the 
target number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility  that additional subjects 
in screenin g will not be enrolled.
The study  duration will include a 35 -day screening period; a 12 -week randomized, 
double -blind, parallel -group, placebo controlled treatment period (Period 1); a 248 -week 
blinded long -term extension period (Period 2); and a 30- day follow-up period (call or 
visit).
Subjects who meet eligibility  criteria will be randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to one of 
four treatment groups:  
●Group 1:  Upadacitinib 30 mg QD (N = 200) (Period 1) → Upadacitinib 30 mg 
QD (Period 2)
●Group 2:  Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (N = 200) (Period 1) → Upadacitinib 15 mg 
QD (Period 2)
●Group 3:  Placebo (N = 100) (Period 1) → Upadacitinib 30 mg QD (Period 2) 
Upadacitinib

33
●Group 4:  Placebo (N = 100) (Period 1) → Upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Period 2)
Subjects must have been on a stable dose of csDMARD(s) for ≥ [ADDRESS_1136434] remain on a stable dose until Week 24; the csDMARD 
dose may  be decreased only  for safet y reasons.
At Week 24, if a subject fails to meet the Low Disease Activity  (LDA) criterion (LDA 
defined as CDAI ≤ 10) the investigator should adjust the subject's background RA 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Starting at Week 24 (after Week [ADDRESS_1136435] been performed) and 
thereafter, initiation of or change in corticosteroids, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs 
(NSAIDs), acetaminophen, or adding or increasing doses of csDMARDs (concomitant 
use of up to 2 csDMARDs except the combination of MTX and leflunomide) is allowed 
as per local label.  Starting at Week 24, at least 20% improvement in BOTH TJC AND 
SJC is r equired to remain on study  drug.  An yone who does not fulfill this criterion at 
2consecutive visits (starting at Week 24) (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) must be discontinued from 
study  drug.
Subjects with prior exposure to at most one bDMARD for RA may  be enrolled in the 
study  (up to 20% of total study  population) after the required washout period (for washout 
periods, see inclusion criterion 7, Section 5.2.1) is satisfied and if they  have limited 
exposure (< 3 months), OR response to bDMARD but had to discontinue that bDMARD 
due to intolerability  (reg ardless of treatment duration).  These subjects will be equall y 
stratified across all treatment groups.  Subjects who are considered bDMARD inadequate 
responders, as determined by  [CONTACT_737], are not eligible.
Subjects who complete the Week 12 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the blinded 
long-term extension portion of the study , Period 2 (248 weeks).  Subjects who are 
assigned to upadacitinib treatment groups in Period [ADDRESS_1136436] completed Period 1 
(Week 12) for the purpose of regulatory  submission.  Study  sites and subjects will remain 
blinded for the duration of the study.
Starting with Amendment 6, all subjects will receive open -label upadacitinib [ADDRESS_1136437] = conventional synthetic disease modifying anti -rheumatic drug; LDA = low disease activity; QD = once 
daily; RA = rheumatoid arthritis
* The follow -up period is only for subjects who do not enter Period 2.

Note: Starting with Amendment 6, all subjects will receive open -label upadacitinib 15 mg QD, including those 
currently on upadacitinib 30 mg QD.
Screening Period
Within 35 day s prior to the Baseline Visit, subjects will receive a full exp lanation of the 
study  design and stud y procedures, provide a written informed consent, and undergo the 
screening procedures outlined in Table 2.  Lab v alues can be re -tested once during the 
screening period.  If the re -tested lab value(s) remain(s) exclusionary , the subject will be 
considered a screen failure with no additional re -screening possible.  Redrawing samples 
if previous samples were unable to be analy zed would not count as a retest since previous 
result was never obtained.

Subjects that initially  screen fail (for reasons other than laboratory  values) for the study  
are permitted to re -screen once following re -consent.  For additional re -screenin g, [COMPANY_013] 
Therapeutic Area Medical Director approval is required.  All screening procedures with 
the possible exceptions noted below will be repeated during re -screening.  The subject 
must meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at the ti me of re -screening in 
order to qualify  for the study .  There is no minimum period of time a subject must wait to 
re-screen for the stud y.  If the subject had a complete initial screening evaluation 
including the assessment of an Interferon -Gamma Release As say (IGRA; QuantiFERON 
Tuberculosis [TB] Gold In Tube test) and/or a purified protein derivative ([COMPANY_003]) test (or 
equivalent) (or both if required per local guidelines), or chest x -ray and electrocardiogram 
(ECG), these tests will not be required to be repea ted for re -screening provided the 
conditions noted in Section 5.2are met, there are no changes in the subject's medical 
history  that would warrant re-testing, and no more than [ADDRESS_1136440] passed.
Period 1 (12 -Week Randomized, Double -Blind Treatment Period)
Period 1 will begin at the Baseline Visit (Day  1) and will end at the Week 12 Visit.  At the 
Baseline Visit, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria described in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be enrolled into the study  and 
randomized to double -blind treatment.  During this period of the stud y, subjects will visit 
the study  site at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12.  A ± [ADDRESS_1136441] dose of study  drug.

2consecutive visits (starting at Week 24) (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) must be discontinued from 
study  drug.
Starting with Amendment 6, all subjects will receive open -label upadacitinib 15 mg QD, 
including those currentl y on upadacitinib 30 mg QD.
Discontinuation of Study Drug and Continuation of Study Participation (Period 1 
and Period 2)
Subjects may  discontinue study  drug treatment, but may  choose to continue to participate 
in the study  (refer to Section 5.4.1 for additional details).  Subjects who prematurely 
discontinue study  drug should complete a Premature Discontinuation (PD) visit as soon as 
possible, preferabl y within 2 weeks , and preferably  prior to initiation of another therap y.  
To minimize missing data for efficacy  and safet y assessments, subjects who prematurel y 
discontinue study  drug treatment should continue to be followed for all regularly  
scheduled visits as outlined in the Study  Activities Schedule ( Table 4), unless subjects 
have decided to discontinue study  participation entirely  (withdrawal of informed consent).   
Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific importance of their data even if 
they disconti nue treatment with study  drug early .  Following discontinuation of study  
drug, the subject should be treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical 
judgment irrespective of whether the subject decides to continue participation in the study.  
As the subject has discontinued study drug, all rescue -and efficacy -driven discontinuation 
criteria no longer appl y.  This includes the 20% TJC/SJC calculations at Week [ADDRESS_1136445] no longer wants to provide assessments (withdrawal of informed consent) 
following discontinuation of study  drug, a second PD visit is not required.

with the reason for use, date(s) of administration including start and end dates, and dosage 
information including dose, route, and frequency  on the appropriate electronic case report 
form ( eCRF).  Also, medications including but not limited to DMARDs taken for RA 
since date of RA diagnosis (based on subject recollection and available medical records) 
should be entered into the appropriate eCRF.
The [COMPANY_013] Therapeutic Area Medical Director sh ould be contact[CONTACT_43205] y 
questions regarding concomitant or prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
[IP_ADDRESS] Permitted Background RA  Therapy
Subjects should continue on their stable ( ≥ [ADDRESS_1136473] dose of study  drug) 
background csDMARD therap y (restricted to oral or parenteral MTX [15 to 25 mg/week; 
or ≥ 10 mg/week in subjects who are intolerant of MTX at doses ≥ 15 mg/week], 
sulfasalazine [ ≤ 3000 mg/day ], hydroxy chloroquine [≤ 400 mg/day ], chloroquine 
[≤250mg/day ], and leflunomide [ ≤ 20 mg/day ]) up to Week 24. At any  time, the 
csDMARD dose may  be decreased onl y for safety reasons.  Subjects taking MTX should 
take a dietary  supplement of oral folic acid (or equivalent, such as folinic acid) throughout 
study  participation.  Folic acid dosing and timing of regimen should be followed 
according to Investigator's instructions.  [COMPANY_013] will not provide the csDMARDs (or folic 
acid, if taking MTX).  
Subjects should continue on their stable doses of NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamol, 
oral corticosteroids (equivalent to p rednisone ≤ 10 mg/day ), or inhaled corticosteroids.
●If taking an y of the above on a scheduled basis, they should continue to take 
them as they  did at study  entry  with no change in dose or frequency , including 
on study  visit day s; 
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_1136474] 2015 -003332 -13

●If not taking an y of the above at baseline, these must not be initiated except 
where permitted b y protocol (specific time period or protocol -defined rescue);
●If taking an y of the above, including low potency analgesics, i.e., tramadol, 
codeine, h ydrocodone or propox yphene at basel ine on an as -needed basis 
(PRN), they  should continue to use them for the same reason and same dose 
each time but they  should not b e taken within the 24 hours prior to an y study  
visit to avoid bias in outcome measurements.
In the event of tolerability (or other safety) issues, the doses of these medications may be 
decreased or discontinued with substitution of another permitted medication from that 
class (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]). 
PRN use of inhaled corticosteroids is permitted at any  time.
At Week 24 (after Week [ADDRESS_1136475] been performed), if a subject fails to meet 
the L DA criterion (LDA defined as CDAI ≤ 10), the investigator should adjust the 
subject's background RA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Initiation of or change in corticosteroids, NSAIDs, 
acetaminophen, or adding or increasing doses of csDMARDs (concomitant use of up to 
2csDMARDs except the combination of MTX and leflunomide; see Inclusion 
Criterion 3) is allowed as per local label.  Starting at Week [ADDRESS_1136476] of 
care, are allowed.  However, joint injections should be avoided within 21 days prior to the 
next scheduled study  visit to avoid confounding effects of s ystemic absorption of 
intra-articular corticosteroids.  For the analy sis of the TJC and SJC, injected joints will be 
considered "not assessable" for 3 months from the time of the intra -articular injection.  
Also, per investigator's judgment background RA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (corticosteroids, NSAIDS, 
acetaminophen, csDMARDs) can be adjusted for eac h subject bey ond Week 24 until end 
of Period 2.  For RA flare treatment, no more than 3 consecutive days of high -dose 
systemic corticosteroids (maximum dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day  of prednisone or its equivalent) 
is allowed, after which subject should resume the ir usual daily  oral corticosteroid dose.

5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Recommendation for Females
A woman who is postmenopausal or permanentl y surgically  sterile (bilateral 
oophorectom y, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_556006] ) is not considered to be a woman 
of childbearing potential and is not required to follow contraception recommendations.  
Postmenopausal is defined as:
●Age ≥ 55 y ears with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause; or
●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause AND an FSH level > 40 mIU/mL.
If the female subject is < 55 y ears of age:
AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history  of permanent surg ical 
sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_1136484] 2015 -003332 -13
52
●If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential 
and protocol- specified contraception is required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent wit h post -menopausal status, 
contraception is not required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre -menopausal status, 
contraception is required, and a serum pregnancy  test must be performed (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] pregnancy test).
For a female subject at any  age: 
●Female subjects with menses within the past 12 months are of childbearing 
potential and FSH is therefore not required but c ontraception is required
●Female subjects who are surgical sterile (defined above) are not of 
childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is 
required.
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently  surgic ally 
sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the 
following highly  effective methods of birth control that is effective from Study  Day  1 (or 
earlier) through at least [ADDRESS_1136485] dose of study d rug.
●Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
(oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable) associated with the inhibition of 
ovulation, initiated at least 1 month prior to Study  Day  1.
●Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Study 
Day 1.
●Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation.
●Vasectomized partner(s), provided the vasectomized partner verbally confirms 
receipt of medical ass essment of the surgical success and is the only  sexual 
partner.
●Intrauterine device (IUD).
●Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS). 
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_1136486] 2015 -003332 -13
53
●True abstinence:  Refraining from heterosexual intercourse when this is in line 
with the preferred and usual lifesty le of the subject (periodic abstinence 
[e.g., calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, post -ovulation methods] and 
withdrawal are not acceptable).
If required per local practices, male or female condom with or without spermicide OR 
cap, diaphragm or sponge with sp ermicide should be used in addition to one of the highly 
effective birth control methods listed above (excluding true abstinence).
It is important to note that contraception recommendations described above are 
specificall y intended to prevent pregnancy dur ing exposure to the investigational therap y 
upadacitinib.  The concomitant csDMARDs (i.e., methotrexate, sulfasalazine, etc.) have 
been prescribed per standard of care prior to study entry and are allowed to be continued 
during the study.  Contraception sh ould continue while the subject is on the concomitant 
csDMARD and that duration of contraception after discontinuation of the csDMARD 
should be based on the local label.  Additional local requirements may apply.  Refer to 
Appendix Ofor local requirements for Canada and Korea.
If during the course of the study  a woman becomes surgically sterile or post -menopausal 
and complete documentation is availabl e, contraception measures as defined above are no 
longer required.  
Contraception Recommendation for Males
There are no contraception requirements for upadacitinib for male subjects or their female 
partner(s).
Contraception recommendations related to use of background csDMARDs including 
MTX, as well as concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_555997], should be based 
on the local label.

[IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures
The study  procedures outlined in Table 2and Tabl e 4are discussed in detail in this 
section, with the exception of in vivo pharmacod ynamic biomarkers (discussed in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 ), exploratory  research and validation studies (discus sed in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 ), drug concentration measurements (discussed in Section 5.3.2), the 
collection of prior and concomitant medication information (discussed in Section 5.2.3), 
and t he collection of AE information (discussed in Section 6.0).  All study  data will be 
recorded in source documents and on the appropriate eCRFs.
Informed Consent
At the Screening visit, the subject will sign and date a study specific, IEC/IRB approved, 
informed consent form for the study  (i.e., includes both Periods 1 and 2) before an y stud y 
procedures are performed or an y medications are withheld from the subject in order to 
participate in this study .  Separate written consent will be required for each subject in 
order to participate in the optional exploratory  research and validation studies.  Subjects 
can withdraw informed consent at an y time.
Details regarding how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in 
Section 9.3.  
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Subjects will be evaluated to ensure they  meet all inclusion criteria and have none of the 
exclusion criteria at both Screening and Baseline Visits.
Medical and Surgical History
A complete non -RA-related medical and surgical history , including history  of alcohol and 
nicotine use, will be taken from each subject during the Screening Visit.  Additionally , a 
list of each subject's specific RA -related medical and surgical history will be recorded at 
Screening.  History  of herpes zoster, herpes zoster vaccination, and hepatitis B 
vaccination status will be recorded as part of the medical history .  An updated medical  
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_1136511] had TB, and travel to, residence in, or work in TB endemic 
locations.

The subject should complete the questionnaires before site personnel perform any  clinical 
assessments and before any  interaction with site personnel has occurre d to avoid biasing 
the subject's response.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, questionnaires will be 
completed b y the subject at the next fea sible visit.
TB Testing/TB Prophylaxis
Period [ADDRESS_1136513]'s epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] , history , exam findings, etc., and it is the responsibility  of the 
Investigator to determine if a subject has previous, active, or latent TB.
All subjects will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB b y a risk assessment 
form ( Appendix E) and tested for TB infection by [CONTACT_82736] -TB Gold test.  The [COMPANY_003]  
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_1136514] is not possible for 
any reason (unless both tests are required per local guidelines).  The site staff will 
complete the TB risk assessment form and enter the data into an appropriate eCRF.
Preferred Method:
●QuantiFERON- TB Gold Test will be anal yzed by [CONTACT_2237]  
(QuantiFERON test is preferred over [COMPANY_003] skin test).
●If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test is NOT possib le (or if both the 
QuantiFERON- TB Gold Test and the [COMPANY_003] Skin Test are required per local 
guidelines):  the [COMPANY_003] Skin Test (also known as a TB Skin Test) will be 
performed according to standard clinical practice.  The TB Skin Test should be 
read b y a license d healthcare professional between [ADDRESS_1136515].  The reaction will be measured in millimeters 
(mm) of induration and induration ≥ 5 mm for RA subjects is considered a 
positive reaction.  The absence of induration will be recorded as "0 mm" not 
"negative."  Subjects who have had an ulcerating reaction to the TB Skin Test 
in the past should not be re -exposed and TB Skin Test should be considered 
positive with no requirement for subsequent testing with either [COMPANY_003] or 
QuantiFERON- TB Gold Plus.
If a subject had a negative QuantiFERON -TB Gold (and/or [COMPANY_003]) test (or IGRA 
equivalent such as T -SPOT TB test) within [ADDRESS_1136516]'s medical history to warrant a repeat test.  These cases may be 
discussed with the [COMPANY_013] Therapeutic Area Medical Director.  The results of the TB 
test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation.
In the event both a [COMPANY_003] test and a QuantiFERON -TB Gold test are performed, the result 
of the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test will supersede the result of the [COMPANY_003] test, unless 
otherw ise required b y local guidelines.  If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is 
indeterminate, the site should repeat the test with another blood sample.  If the  
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_1136517] method (i.e., [COMPANY_003] or QuantiFERON TB Gold or other IGRA) was performed at 
screening, then the subject should have their annual TB test performed with the same test 
method.
Subjects with a negative QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (and/or negative [COMPANY_003] TB skin 
test) and chest x -ray (CXR) not suggestive of active TB or prior TB exposure may  be 
enrolled.
Subjects with a positive TB test must be assessed for evidence of active TB versus latent 
TB, including signs and sy mptoms and CXR.  Subjects with no signs or s ymptoms and a 
CXR not suggestive of active TB may be enrolled after initiation of TB prophylaxis (see 
below).  Subjects with evidence of active TB must not be enrolled.
At Screening, if the subject has evidence of latent TB infection (QuantiFERON®-TB Gold 
test and/or the [COMPANY_003] test positive and the subject has a CXR not suggestive of active TB), 
prophy lactic treatment must be initiated at least 2 weeks prior to administration of study  
drug (or per local guidelines, whichever is longer).  The proph ylaxis needs to be 
complet ed; however, the full course of proph ylaxis does not need to be completed prior to 
the first dose of stud y drug.  If the Investigator deems that it is necessary, consultation 
with a TB expert could be considered.
Of note:  Rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_176368].
Subjects with a prior history  of latent TB that have documented completion of a full 
course of anti -TB therapy  within [ADDRESS_1136518]'s medical history  to 
warrant repeat treatment.   
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_1136519] (or 
equivalent) and/or [COMPANY_003] are not required to repeat either test at Screening or during the 
study  and should be considered positive .
For subjects with a negative QuantiFERON -TB Gold (and/or [COMPANY_003]) test at Screening, an 
annual QuantiFERON -TB Gold (and/or [COMPANY_003]) re -test will be performed (or both if 
required b y local guidelines).  If one of the annual tests has a positive test result 
(seroconversion), a chest x -ray (CXR) needs to be performed as soon as possible to aid in 
distinguishing active versus latent TB.
For subjects with seroconversion on an annual TB test, if a CXR cannot be done due to 
state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, the Investigator should contact 
[CONTACT_820074] c ontinue on study  drug.  CXR should 
be performed as soon as restrictions allow at the study site or local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/facility.
If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is indeterminate then the investigator should perform a 
local QuantiFERON -TB Gold test (or through t he central laboratory  if not locally  
available) to rule out a positive test result.  I f testing remains indeterminate or is positive, 
then the subject is considered to be positive for the purpose of this stud y.  If the local 
testing result is negative, the n the patient is considered to be negative.  Expert 
consultation can be considered per Investigator's discretion.  An y positive TB screen after 
the patient has started the study , should be reported as an adverse event (AE) of latent TB 
or active TB (as applicable).

●Interpretation of a positive annual TB test in low risk subjects:  I n cases where 
the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Plus test by  [CONTACT_423677][INVESTIGATOR_110958], t he Investigator may  perform a local QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
Plus test (or repeat testing through the central laboratory  if not locall y 
available) to confirm the positive test result.  I f the repeat testing result is 
negative, the Investigator may  consi der the test to be negative based on his/her 
clinical judgment; if the repeat testing result is positive or indeterminate, the 
test is considered positive.
●An equivalent Interferon Gamma Release Assay  (IGRA) (such as T -SPOT TB

12-Lead ECG
A resting 12 -lead ECG will be performed at the designated stud y visits as specified in 
Table 2and Table 4 .  A qualified phy sician will interpret the clinical significance of an y 
abnormal finding, sign, and date each ECG.  ECG with QT interval correc ted for heart 
rate using Friedericia's correction formula (QTcF) should be reported (or calculated) and 
documented in the source documents and later transcribed on to the appropriate eCRF if 
QTcF prolongation is observed.  A valid QTcF cannot be calculated in subjects who have 
a pacemaker or supraventricular or ventricular conduction abnormalities.  In cases of 
QTcF prolongation, the baseline QTcF will need to be entered into the appropriate eCRF 
for comparison as well.  In addition, any  clinically  signific ant findings will be 
documented in the source documents and later transcribed on to the appropriate eCRF.  
Each signed original ECG will be monitored by  [CONTACT_820075]'s source documents onsite.

TJC and SJC Assessment
TJC Assessment
An assessment of 68 joints ( Appendix D) will be done for tenderness b y pressure

pain/tenderness will be classified as:  present ("1"), absent ("0"), replaced ("9") or no 
assessment ("NA") .
SJC Assessment
An assessment of 66 joints ( Appendix D) will be done by [CONTACT_820076] 2and Tabl e 4.  The joints to be examined for swelling are the 
same as those examined for tenderness, except the hip joints are excluded.  Joint swelling 
will be classified as present ("1"), absent ("0"), replaced ("9") or no assessment ("NA").
Any injected joints will be considered as "not assessed" ("NA") for [ADDRESS_1136530] at each visit for the duration of the trial as much as possible.  A back -up 
independent joint assessor should be identified.  The independent joint assessors should 
be a qualified medical professional (e.g. , nurse, phy sician's assistant, phy sician).  An y 
other joint assessor must be trained and competent in performing such assessments.  I t is 
the responsibility  of the Investigator to ensure that all assessors are qualified and trained 
to perform joint assess ments.  If the independent assessor is not available, the pre -
identified back- up assessor should perform such assessments.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, the TJC and SJC will be 
performed at the next feasible visit by  [CONTACT_176404], if possible.
CDAI
The CDAI calculation is required to determine if a subject fails to achieve low disease 
activity  at the Week 24 visit.  An I nteractive Response Technology  (IRT) will calculate 
CDAI  with input from site personnel on joint counts and the subject's and phy sician's 
Global Assessment of RA Disease Activity  score.  A worksheet will be provided to 
capture the components required for IRT entry  to obtain the CDAI calculation. 
The calculation used to determine CDAI score at Week 24 is as follows:
CDAI  = TJC28 + SJC28 + PtGA (cm) + PhGA (cm)
NOTE:  Investigator should optimize background RA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_556001] a CDA I ≤ 10.
Pregnancy Test
A serum pregnancy  test will be performed for all female subjects at the Screening Visit.  
The serum pregnancy  test will be sent to and performed by  [CONTACT_2237] .  If the 
serum pregnancy  test is positive the subject is consi dered a screen failure.  If the serum  
Upadacitinib

●Positive, the subject is considered a screen failure;
●Negative, the subject can be enrolled into the trial;
●Still borderline, the [COMPANY_013] Therapeutic Area Medical Director needs to be 
consulted.
In Period 1, a urine pregnancy  test will be performed for all women of childbearing 
potential at the Baseline Visit prior to the first dose of study drug and all subsequent visits 
except Week 1.  More frequent pregnancy  tests will be performed throughout the study  if 
required per local/country requirements.
●If the baseline urine pregnancy  test performed at the site is negative, then 
dosing with study  drug may  begi n.  If the baseline urine pregnancy  test 
performed at the site is positive, dosing with study drug must be withheld and 
a serum pregnancy  test is required.  The serum pregnancy  test will be sent to 
and performed b y the central laboratory.  If the serum pre gnancy  test is 
positive, study  drug must be withheld and the subject must be discontinued 
from the study .  In the event a pregnancy  test comes back borderline, a repeat 
test is required.
●If a urine pregnancy  test post -baseline is positive, study  drug needs to be 
temporaril y discontinued and a serum pregnancy test is required.  The serum 
pregnancy  test will be sent to and performed b y the central laboratory.  If the 
serum pregnancy  test is positive, study  drug must be permanently  
discontinued.
In Period 2, for women of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed 
at all visits and monthly  at home between scheduled study  visits.  The results of the 
monthly  at home tests will be communicated to the site.  If a urine pregnancy  test is 
posit ive, the subject must stop dosing, come in to the clinic and have blood drawn for a 
serum pregnancy  test that will be analy zed at the central laboratory .

obtain other laboratory  samples.
At each visit, the study  staff should review the pregnancy  avoidance recommendations 
with each female subject of childbearing p otential and document this discussion in the 
subject's source records.
If during the course of the study  a woman becomes surgically sterile or post -menopausal

Clinical Laboratory Tests
Samples will be obtained for the clinical laboratory tests listed in Table 5.  Unscheduled 
clinical labs may  be obtained at an y time during the study if deemed appropriate per 
Investigator's discretion.  A certified central laboratory will be utilized to process and 
provide results for the clinical laboratory tests.  All abnormal laboratory tests that are

questionnaires (HAQ -DI, Patient's Assessment of Pain, etc.) and vital sign determinations 
are obtained.
For clinic visits where samples for serum chemistry tests are collected, subjects should be 
fasting (a minimum [ADDRESS_1136535]) whenever possible.  If a subject is not able to fast when 
necessary , due to unforeseen circumstances, the non -fasting status will be recorded in

Plasma concentrations of upadacitinib will be determined by [CONTACT_556012] a validated liquid chromatograph y/mass spectrometry  
method.
5.3.3 Efficacy  Variables
[IP_ADDRESS] Period 1 Variables
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Primary  Variables
The primary  endpoint in Period 1 is the proportion of subjects achieving ACR20 response 
(US/FDA regulatory  purposes) or the proportion of subjects achieving LDA (EU/EMA 
regulatory purposes) at Week 12.  Anal yses will be conducted separatel y for US/FDA 
regulatory  purposes and EU/EMA regulatory  purposes; for each set of analy ses, onl y 
oneprimary  endpoint is specified.
ACR20 response rate will be determined based on 20% or greater im provement in TJC 
and SJC and ≥ 3 of the 5 measures of Patient's Assessment of Pain (VAS), Patient's 
Global Assessment of Disease Activity  (VAS), Phy sician's Global Assessment of Disease 
Activity  (VAS), HAQ -DI, or hsCRP.
LDA is defined as DAS28 (CRP) ≤ 3.2.   DAS28 (CRP) score will be determined based on 
a continuous scale of combined measures of TJC, SJC, Patient's Global Assessment of 
Disease Activity  (PtGA) (in mm), and hsCRP (in mg/L) at Week 12.
DAS28 (CRP) = 0.56 × √(TJC28*) + 0.28 × √(SJC28**) + 0.36 ×ln(hsCRP&+1) 
+ 0.014 × PtGA>>+ 0.96
* TJC28 refers to the Subject's total Tender Joint Count out of the provided 28 evaluated joints.
** SJC28 refers to the Subject's total Swollen Joint Count out of the provided 28 evaluated joints.
& hsCRP refers to the high -sensitivity c -reactive protein lab value.  hsCRP unit in the DAS28 (CRP) 
equation is expressed as mg/L.
>> PtGA refers to the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity.

5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subje cts to Treatment Groups
All subjects will be randomized using I RT.  Before the study  is initiated, IRT directions 
will be provided to each site.
All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number b y the IRT at the Screening 
Visit.  For subjects that re -screen, the Screening number assigned b y the IRT at the initial 
Screening visit should be used; a new Screening number should not be requested.
Subjects will be eligible for randomization if they continue to meet all of the selection 
criteria (Sect ion 5.2) at Baseline and are willing to continue in the study .  
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio using interactive response technology  (IRT) 
to receive double -blind study  drug in one of the following treatment groups:
●Group 1:  Upadacitinib (ABT -494) 30 mg QD (N = 200) (Period 1) →

IRT w ill provide the appropriate study  drug kit number(s) to dispense to each subject.  
Study  drug will be administered at the study  visits as summarized in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  
Returned study  drug should not be re -dispensed to any  subject.
Starting with Amendment 6, all subjects will receive open -label upadacitinib [ADDRESS_1136569]
Subjects should take study drug as outlined in Section 5.5.1.
On dosing day s that occur on study  visit day s, subjects should follow the regular dosing 
schedule (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] regarding Week 1 and Week 2 visits).
Each subject's dosing schedule should be closel y monitor ed by  [CONTACT_176438]'s dosing diary .  This will ensure that all subjects enrolled 
into the study  maintain their original dosing schedule beginning with the first dose of 
study  drug (Baseline/Day 1).
If a subje ct should forget to take their upadacitinib (ABT -494) (or matching placebo) dose 
at their regularly  scheduled dosing time, they  should take the forgotten dose as soon as 
they remember the dose was missed as long as it is at least [ADDRESS_1136570] experiences a study drug interruption > [ADDRESS_1136571] 2015 -003332 -13

5.5.5 Blinding
[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding of Investigational Product
All [COMPANY_013] personnel wit h direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial 
(with the exception of [COMPANY_013] Drug Supply  Management Team), the Investigator, study  
site personnel, and the subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment throughout 
the study .  Startin g with Amendment 6, all subjects will receive open -label upadacitinib 
15 mg QD, including those currently  on upadacitinib 30 mg QD.
In order to maintain the blind, the upadacitinib (ABT -494) tablets and placebo tablets 
provided for the stud y will be identical in appearance.  The IRT will provide access to 
unblinded subject treatment information in the case of medical emergency .
In the event of a medical situation that requires unblinding of the stud y drug assignment, 
the Investigator is requested to contact [CONTACT_176439].  However, if an urgent therapeutic intervention is necessary 
which warrants breaking the blind prior to contact[CONTACT_176440], the Investigator can directl y access the I RT sy stem to break the blind 
without [COMPANY_013] notification or agreement.  Unblinding is available in the IRT system via 
the Unblind Subject transaction, which is available only to the Investigator.  If the IRT 
system is unavailable, unb linding may  occur b y contact[CONTACT_176441] (preferred) or email ([EMAIL_2197]).  For country -specific 
phone numbers, please see the following website:  http://www.endpointclinical.com/help-
desk/.  I n the eve nt that the blind is broken before notification to the [COMPANY_013] Therapeutic 
Area Medical Director, [COMPANY_013] requests that the [COMPANY_013] Therapeutic Area Medical 
Director be notified within [ADDRESS_1136572] completed Period 1 
(Week 12) for the purpose of regulatory  submission.  Study  sites and subjects will remain 
blinded f or the duration of the study .
Starting with Amendment 6, all subjects will receive open -label upadacitinib 15 mg QD, 
including those currentl y on upadacitinib 30 mg QD.  Study sites and subjects will no 
longer be blinded after this point.
[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding of Data for Data Monitoring Committee
An external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) comprised of persons independent of 
[COMPANY_013] and with relevant expertise in their field will review unblinded safety data from 
the ongoing stud y.  The primary responsibility of the DMC will be to protect the safet y of 
the subjects participating in this study .
A separate DMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the 
roles and responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency of data reviews, and relevant 
safet y data to be assessed.
Communications from the DMC to the Study  Teams will not contain information that 
could potentially  unblind the team to subject treatment assignments.
As of September 2018, with all subjects having reached the end of Period 1, and after
final review of unblinded safety data, the DMC concluded its oversight of this study .
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The Investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug onl y to subjects enrolled in the study in a ccordance with 
the protocol.  The stud y drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the 
protocol.

The study  site personnel will document compliance in the study  source documents.
5.5.7 Drug A ccountability
The Investigator or his/her representative will verify that stud y drug supplies are received 
intact and in the correct amounts.  This will be documented by [CONTACT_176442] b y registering the arrival of drug through the 
IRT.  The original Proof of Receipt Note and the IRT confirmation sheet will be kept in 
the site f iles as a record of what was received.
In addition, an I RT will be used to document investigational product accountability  
including but not limited to date received, the lot number, kit number(s), date dispensed, 
subject number, and the identification of the person dispensing the drug.
All empty /used study  drug packaging will be inventoried by  [CONTACT_779].  Empty /used study  
drug packaging should be returned b y the subject at each visit for accountability  and 
compliance purposes and new packaging issued as nec essary .  Site staff will complete 
study  drug accountabilit y via I RT, by  [CONTACT_176444], subject dosing diaries, and 
by [CONTACT_372895].  After drug accountability  and 
monitor reconciliation has been completed, us ed packaging and unused study drug will be 
destroy ed on site according to local procedures or regulations or returned to the 
destruction depot (for those sites that do not meet [COMPANY_013]'s documentation requirements 
for on -site destruction).  The use of a thi rd part y vendor for drug destruction must be 
pre-approved b y [COMPANY_013].  For sites performing on -site drug destruction or using a 
third party  vendor for drug destruction, a cop y of the destruction methodology and date of 
destruction should be maintained at th e site's facility .

6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily  have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease  
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_1136579] 2015 -003332 -13

temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  An y 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an AE.  Worsening in 
severi ty of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory  abnormalities and 
changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only  if they  result in discontinuation from 
the study , necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigato r considers 
them to be AEs.
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during the study  will not be considered 
an AE if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and the 
surgery /procedure has been pre -planned prior to stud y entr y.  However, if the pre -existing 
condition deteriorates unexpectedly  during the study  (e.g., surgery  performed earlier than 
planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery /procedure 
is being done will be considered an AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious A dverse Events
If an AE meets an y of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as an SAE 
within [ADDRESS_1136580]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This 
does not include an emergency  room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility .
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.

Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability  is not intended to include experiences of relativel y 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgic al 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based 
on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life -threatening, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital 
anomaly , or persistent or significant disability /incapacity ).  
Additionally , any elective or spontaneous abortion or

6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will classify  AEs according to the Rheumatology  Common Toxicity  
Criteria v.2.0 ( Appendix N).22
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The Investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to 
the use of stud y drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
For causality  assessments, events ass essed as having a reasonable possibility  of being 
related to the stud y drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated."

DNA at screening who develop the following should have HBV DNA by [CONTACT_423685]:
○ ALT > 5 × ULN OR
○ ALT or AST > 3 × ULN if an alternative cause is not readily identified.
○ A positive result for HBV DNA PCR testing in these subjects will require 
immediate interruption of study drug and a hepatologist consultation should occur 
within one week for recommendation regarding subsequent treatment.
For any confirmed ALT or AST elevations > [ADDRESS_1136595], complete supplemental hepatic 
eCRF.
Serum Creatinine  If serum creatinine is > 1.5 × the baseline value and > ULN, repeat the test for 
serum creatinine (with subject in an euvolemic state) to confirm the results.  If the 
results of the repeat testing still meet this criterion, then interrupt study drug and 
re-start study drug once serum creatinine returns to ≤ 1.5 × baseline value and

[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Exposure
Exposure to study  drug will be summarized for the Safet y Anal ysis Set for Period 1 alone 
as well as for Period 1 and Period 2 combined.  The exposure to study  drug (day s) will be 
summarized with the mean, standard deviation, median, and range for each treatment 
group.  The exposure to study  drug is defined as the difference between the dates of the 
first and last doses of the study  drug plus 1 day .  
Study  drug compliance w ill be summarized for each treatment group for Period 1.  The 
compliance is defined as the number of tablets taken (i.e., the difference between the 
number of tablets dispensed and the number of tablets returned) during the subject's 
participation in Perio d [ADDRESS_1136606] one dose of study drug.
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy  Analysis for Period 1
For all efficacy  analy sis in Period 1, the two placebo groups (Groups 3 and 4) will be 
combined and treated as one placebo group for analy sis purposes.  Each upadacitinib dose 
will be compared with the combined placebo group.
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Primary  Efficacy  Variables
The primary  endpoint in Period 1 (at Week 12) for US/FDA regulatory  purposes is listed 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 .  The primary  endpoint in Period 1 (at Week 12) for EU/EMA 
regulatory  purposes is also listed in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 .  Analy ses will be conducted 
separately  for US/FDA regulatory  purposes and EU/EMA regulatory  purposes; for each 
set of anal yses, onl y one primary endpoint is specified.
Analy sis of the primary  endpoint will be condu cted on the FAS based on treatment as

Specificall y, the testing will utilize the endpoint sequence of primary endpoint followed 
by [CONTACT_820080], and will begin with testing the primary  endpoint 
using α of 0.025 for each dose.  Continued testing will follow a pre -specified α transfer 
path which includes downstream transfer along the endpoint sequence within each dose as 
well as cross -dose transfer.  More details of the graphical procedure will be specified in 
the SAP.
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Imputation Methods
The following methods will be used for missing data imputation:
Observed Cases (OC):   The OC anal ysis will not impute values for missing evaluations, 
and thus a subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded 
from the OC anal ysis for that visit.
Multiple Imputation (MI):   The M I anal ysis imputes missing data multiple times under 
appropriate random variation and thus generates multiple imputed "pseudo -complete" 
datasets.  Results will be aggregated across the multiple imputed datasets, overcoming 
drawbacks of the single imputation methods.
Non- Responder Imputation (NRI):   NRI applies to binary  endpoints only.  I n NRI 
analysis, subjects who prematurel y discontinue study drug will b e considered 
non-responders after discontinuation.
The NRI approach will serve as the primary  anal ysis approach for key binary endpoints.  
The MI approach will serve as the primary anal ysis approach for key continuous 
endpoints.  Sensitivity  analy ses based on OC will also be conducted for key  endpoints.

randomly  distributed across the line of unity  (a straight line with zero intercept and 
a slope of one) than the alternative model(s).
3. Visual inspection of model fits, standard errors of model parameters and change in 
inter-subject and intra -subject error.
Once an appropriate base PK model (including inter -and intra -subject error struc ture) is 
developed, empi[INVESTIGATOR_372878] b y the posterior conditional estimation technique using non -linear 
mixed -effects modeling.  The relationship between these conditional estimates CL /F and 
V/Fvalues with onl y potentially ph ysiologicall y relevant or clinically meaningful 
covariates (such as subject age, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, laboratory 
markers of hepatic of renal function, etc.) will be explored using stepwise forward 
selec tion method, or another suitable regression/smoothing method at a significance level 
of 0.05.  After identification of all relevant covariates, a stepwise backward elimination of 
covariates from the full model will be employ ed to evaluate the significance (at P< 0.005, 
corresponding to a decrease in objective function > 7.88 for one degree of freedom) of 
each covariate in the full model.

Linear or non -linear relationships of primary  PK parameters with various covariates will 
be explored.
Relationships betw een upadacitinib exposure and clinical observations (primary efficacy 
variable) will be explored.  Exposure -response relationships for secondary  efficacy  
variables and/or some safety  measures of interest may  also be explored.  The relationship 
between expo sure (e.g., population PK model predicted average concentrations, area 
under the curve, trough concentrations, the individual model- predicted PK profiles, or 
some other appropriate measure of exposure) and drug effect will be explored.  Several 
classes of models (e.g., linear, log -linear, exponential, E max, sigmoid E max, etc.) will be 
evaluated to characterize the exposure -response relationship based on observed data.  
Results of the PK and exposure -response analy ses may  be summarized in a separate report 
prior to regulatory  filing of upadacitinib for the treatment of RA, rather than in the CSR.
Additional analy ses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
8.1.7 Statistical A nalysis of Biomarker Data
Summary  statistics for the in vivo pharmacod ynamic biomarkers (including but not 
limited to NK, NKT, B cells, and T cells) at baseline and post -treatment time points 
(Weeks 8 and 12/PD in Period 1, and Weeks 16, 24, 36, 48 and every  24 weeks thereafter 
in Period 2), in addition to change from baseline at each time w ill be provided; this will 
include mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles, and range for each group.  The 
pharmacod ynamic effect of each biomarker between the placebo and upadacitinib 
treatment groups will be evaluated via a non -linear mixed -effects m odeling approach with 
Change from baseline of the biomarker as response variable, Treatment, Time, and 
Treatment × Time interaction as fixed -effects, the corresponding baseline biomarker score 
as a covariate, and "subjects nested within the treatment group " as a random -effect.  Other 
baseline variables such as age, weight, etc., may  be considered as appropriate.  For 
biomarkers identified to have significant overall treatment effect via the non -linear 
mixed -effects modeling analysis, dose -response models wi th the biomarker as a 
continuous response will be explored.  In addition to the above analyses of biomarkers  
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_1136617] 
response/non -response (with respect to appropriate clinical endpoints), and also with 
safet y endpoints may be explored via a variety of statistical predictive modeling 
algorithms.  Also cut -points for individual biomarkers and optimal combinations of 
biomarkers that differentiate the subject response with re spect to efficacy /safet y endpoints 
may be explored.  The significance of these multivariate combinations of biomarkers may  
be assessed via at least [ADDRESS_1136618] 90% power for a 21% 
difference in ACR20 response rate (assuming a placebo ACR20 response rate of ), as 
well as at least 90% power for a 22% difference in L DA response rate (based on DAS 28 
[CRP] [assuming a placebo L DA r esponse rate of ]), at two sided significance level 
of 0.025 and accounting for a 10% dropout rate.  This sample size will also provide at 
least 90% power for most of the key  secondary  endpoints, including change from baseline 
in DAS28(CRP), change from baseline in HAQ -DI, ACR50 response rate, CR based on 
DAS28(CRP), and SF -36 PCS, at two -sided significance level of 0.025 and accounting 
for a 10% dropout rate.
8.3 Randomization Methods
Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to one of the four treatment groups:

9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol amendments, the 
Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent, and all other forms of subject information 
related to the stud y (e.g., advertisements used to recruit subjects) and an y other necessary 
documents be reviewed by [CONTACT_18369]/I RB.  The IEC/IRB will review the ethical, scientific 
and medical appropriateness of the study  before it is conducted.  IEC/IRB approval of the 
protocol, informed consent, and subject information and/or advertising, as relevant, will 
be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study  site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/I RB approval prior to implementation 
of an y changes made to the study design.  The investigator will be required to submit, 
maintain and archive study  essential documents according to International Conference on 
Harmonizati on (I CH) GCP.
Any SAEs that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by  [CONTACT_427], will be 
reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencies, as required b y 
local regulations.  During the conduct of the stud y, the I nvestigator should promptly   
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_1136620] 2015 -003332 -13
136
provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and an y additional reports required 
by [CONTACT_427]) to the IEC/I RB of any  changes that affect the conduct of the study  
and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the 
IEC/IRB should also be provided to [COMPANY_013].

investigator are specified in Appendix A.
In the event a significant disaster/crisis (e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]/pandemic, natural disaster, 
conflict/combat) occurs leading to difficulties in performing protocol -specified 
procedures, [COMPANY_013] may engage with stud y site personnel in efforts to ensure the safet y 
of subjects, maintain protocol compliance, and minimize risks to the integrity of the stud y 
while try ing to best manage subject continuity  of care.  This may  include alternative 
methods for assessments (e.g., virtual site visits), alternative locations for data collection 
(e.g., use of a local lab instead of a central lab), and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_176381]/or supplies direct to subjects to ensure continuity  of treatment where allowed.  In all 
cases, these alternative measures must be allowed by [CONTACT_820081]/IEC.  Investigators should notify  [COMPANY_013] if any  urgent safet y measures are taken to 
protect the subjects against any  immediate hazard.
9.[ADDRESS_1136622] Information and Consent
The Investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any stud y-related 
screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will 
be reviewed and signed and dated b y the subject, the person who administered the 
informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requ irements.  A cop y of 
the informed consent will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the 
subject's medical record.  An entry  must also be made in the subject's dated source

Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation 
in the study  can be found in the informed consent.
Samples for exploratory  research/validation studies will only  be collected if the subject 
has voluntarily  signed and dated the separate written consent for exploratory 
research/validation studies, approved b y an IRB/IEC, after the nature of the testing has 
been explained and the subject has had an opportunity  to ask questions.  The separate 
written consent must be signed before the exploratory research/validation studies samples 
are collected and testing is perf ormed.  The separate written consent may  be part of the 
main consent form.  If the subject does not consent to the exploratory research/validation 
studies, it will not impact the subject's participation in the study.
In the event a subject withdraws from t he main study , optional exploratory  research 
samples will continue to be stored and anal yzed unless the subject specifically  withdraws 
consent for the optional samples.  If consent is withdrawn for the optional sampling, the 
subject must inform their study doctor, and once [COMPANY_013] is informed, the optional 
samples will be destro yed.However, if the subject withdraws his/her consent and the 
samples have alread y been tested, those results will still remain as part of the overall 
research data.

Section 5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Recommendation for Females
A woman who is postmenopausal or permanentl y surgically  sterile (bilateral 
oophorectom y, bilateral s alpi[INVESTIGATOR_556006] ) is not considered to be a woman 
of childbearing potential and is not required to follow contraception recommendations.  
Postmenopausal is defined as:
●Age ≥ 55 y ears with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause; or
●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause AND an FSH level > 40 mIU/mL.
If the female subject is < 55 y ears of age:
AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history  of permanent surg ical 
sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening.
●If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential 
and protocol- specified contraception is required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent wit h post -menopausal status, 
contraception is not required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre -menopausal status, 
contraception is required, and a serum pregnancy  test must be performed (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] pregnancy test).
For a female subject at any  age:
●Female subject with menses within the past [ADDRESS_1136694] 2015 -003332 -13
186
●Female subjects who are surgically  sterile (defined above) are not of 
childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is 
required.
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently  surgicall y 
sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least two 
forms of contraception.  This includes one form of highl y effective contraception and one 
effective method of contraception that are effective from Study Day  1 (or earlier) through 
at least [ADDRESS_1136695] dose of study  drug.  For concomitant csDMARDs, the local 
label should be followed for contraception requirements (i.e., for methotrexate, 
contraception is required from Study  Day  [ADDRESS_1136696] dose of 
methotrexate.)
●Highl y effective methods:
○Hormonal contraceptives started at least 2 months prior to randomization 
(e.g., combined [estrogen and progestogen containing] oral contraceptives, 
patch, vaginal ring, injectables, and implants) ;
○Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine s ystem (IUS);
○Vasectom y and tubal ligation.
●Effective methods: 
○Barrier methods of contraception (e.g., male condom, female condom, 
cervical cap, diaphragm, contraceptive sponge).
○Note:  The proper use of diaphra gm or cervical cap includes use of 
spermicide and is considered one barrier method.  The cervical cap and 
contraceptive sponge are less effective in parous women.  The use of 
spermicide alone is not considered a suitable b arrier method for 
contraception.  When used consistently  and correctly , "double barrier" 
methods of contraception (e.g., male condom with diaphragm, male 
condom with cervical cap) can be used as an effective alternative to the 
highl y effective contraception methods described above.  Male a nd female 
condoms should not be used together as they can tear of become damaged.

csDMARD and that duration of contraception after discontinuation of the csDMARD 
should be based on the local label.

Section 5.2.4 Contrac eption Requirements
Contraception Recommendation for Females
A woman who is postmenopausal or permanentl y surgically  sterile (bilateral 
oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_176366] h ysterectomy ) is not considered to be a woman 
of childbearing potential and is not required to follow contraception recommendations.
Postmenopausal is defined as:
●Age ≥ 55 y ears with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause; or
●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medi cal cause AND an FSH level > 40 mIU/mL.
If the female subject is < 55 y ears of age:
AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history  of permanent surgical 
sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening.
●If FSH is not tested, it i s assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential 
and protocol- specified contraception is required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post -menopausal status, 
contraception is not required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is c onsistent with pre -menopausal status, 
contraception is required, and a serum pregnancy  test must be performed (see

●Female subjects with menses within the past 12 months are of childbearing 
potential and FSH is therefore not required but contraception is required.
●Female subjects who are surgically  sterile (defined above) are not of 
childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is 
required.
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently  surgicall y 
sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the 
following highly  effective methods of birth control that is effective from Study  Day  1 (or 
earlier) through at least [ADDRESS_1136702] dose of study drug.
●Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
(oral, intravaginal, transdermal) associated with the inhibition of ovulation, 
initiated at least 1 month prior to Study  Day  1.
●Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Study  
Day 1.
●Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation.
●Vasectomized partner(s), provided the vasectomized partner has received 
medical confirmation of the surgical success and is the sole sexual partner of 
the women of childbearing potential trial participant.
● Intrauterine device (IUD).
●Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS).
If required per local practices, male or female condom with or without spermicide OR 
cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide should be used in addition to one of the highly 
effective birth control methods listed above.
It is important to note that contraception recommendations described above are 
specificall y intended to prevent pregnancy during exposure to the investigational therap y

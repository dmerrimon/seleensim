Placebo Effects in Major Depression: A pharmaco -fMRI Intervention  
 
INTRODUCTION:  
 This NARSAD Young Investigator Awa rd application proposes to define the neural and molecular bases of 
placebo ef fects in Major Depression . This proposal would be a perfect extension to my on-going study aimed 
at developi[INVESTIGATOR_141254] a functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) task to investigate  the neural 
signature [CONTACT_307945] , which  will be used in this application. This study would  also 
be an ideal  add-on to a current clinical trial  at [CONTACT_307946]´s laboratory  investigating the role of opi[INVESTIGATOR_307910]. These results will provide robust p reliminary data , to 
inform the design of a randomized controlled trial ( RCT) that would use imaging -based biomarkers of placebo 
effects , to be submitted as an R01 application  to the National Institute of Mental Health.   
 
BACKGROUND & STUDY GOAL :  
 The placebo  effect  – a positive psychophysiological respo nse attributed to inert treatments – is an 
important  yet seemingly  misunderstood  phenomenon  in conventiona l medical  science.  While  placebo  effects  
are as old as healing  itself,  it is still unknown  why certain diseases , such  as depression,  show  remarkably  and 
increasingly  high placebo  rates  (Walsh et  al., 2002 ), hindering  the development of novel therapeutics and 
predictors of treatment response. In RCTs  of antidepressants for adults, response rate to placebo range s from 
25-60%, compared to 50% response rate to antidepressant medication (Quitkin, 1999 ). The failure to 
differentiate between placebo and antidepre ssant responses has caused large pharmaceutical companies to 
reduce or discontinue research focused on treatments for depression and other mental illnesses (Cressey, 
2011 ). Furthermore, o nly one landmark published study has investigated the neural correlates of placebo 
effects in depression (Mayberg et al., 2002 ). Therefore, there is a critical need to define biomarkers of placebo 
effects in depression and translate this knowledge into novel marker -informed clinical trial designs.  
 
Preliminary studies:  Neuroimagin g offers a precise and objective  way to characterize the neural and 
molecular basis of the placebo response in humans.  We have already established the utility of positron 
emission tomography (PET) with the µ -opi[INVESTIGATOR_307911] [11C] carfentanil  to investigate the neurobiology 
of placebo effects using a pain model [for a review, (Pecina and Zubieta, 2014 )]. Additionally, w e have  used 
the same methodology to define the neural bases  of placebo effects  in patients with Major Depressive Disorder 
(MDD)  (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_307912]).  This study demonstrated  that improvement of depressive symptoms  in response to 
placebo  administration  was positively correlated with placebo -induced opi[INVESTIGATOR_307913], 
anterior cingulate  cortex  (ACC) , nucleus accumbens , and amygdala. These data show  that placebo 
administration in patients with MDD  is associated with increased opi[INVESTIGATOR_307914]. More recently, I have developed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_307915].  This fMRI task is 
specifically design ed to record and modulate  mood improvement by [CONTACT_307928] -acting antidepressant effects . In a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_307916], patients with MDD  who reported  acute  mood improvement in response to simulated 
positive neu rofeedback  showed increased blood oxygen level depende nt (BOLD) responses in the ACC  (Fig. 
1), and in particular the rostral  ACC  (rACC) , a 
reliable marker of treatment response in 
depression  (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7293], 2011 ),  and placebo 
analgesic effects (Petrovic et al., 2002 ). In 
summary, these preliminary studies 
demonstrate : 1) the contribution of  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_307917]; and 2)  increased  rACC BOLD 
responses  in patients who reported acute 
mood improvement  induced by  [CONTACT_307929]-acting antidepressant effect s. Still, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_307918] -induced acute 
mood improvement and rACC  BOLD 
responses in patients with MDD has not be en 
investigated, which justifies  the research 
propos ed in this application.   
Fig. 1: Responses to the Simulated Real -time Neurofeedback fMRI task:  
Simulated positive neurofeedback during this task  resulted in 1) Acute 
mood improvement (t= -2.8, p=0.03) (left), and 2) Increased BOLD 
response in the rostral ACC (and also the dorsal and subgenual ACC) 
in placebo responders (n=3) compared to non -responders (n=3) (right).

Based on this preliminary evidence I hypothesize that placebo effects in patients with Major Depression 
take placebo during opi[INVESTIGATOR_307919] r ACC  activity, and therefore can be partially or totally blocked using 
the selective µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_287202] . To test our central hypothesis, we will pursue the following aims: 
AIM 1: Evaluate the effect of naloxone on acute mood improvement and rACC BOLD activity 
induced by [CONTACT_307930]-acting antidepressant effects. 
We hypothesize that naloxone-induced blockade of µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_307920].  
AIM 2: Determine the extent to which individual differences in the rACC BOLD activity induced by 
[CONTACT_307930]-acting antidepressant effects predict acute 
mood improvement . We hypothesize that increased rACC BOLD activity induced by [CONTACT_307931]. If AIM 1 and 2 are significant, we will pursue AIM 3: 
Define the role of the rACC BOLD activity induced by [CONTACT_307932] a mediator of the effect of 
group (naloxone versus placebo) in acute mood improvement. 
Research design : We will recruit 20 un-medicated 
patients with Major Depression aged 18 –[ADDRESS_376782] depressive 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores 
>14). We will use authorized deception ( Miller et al.,
2005) to inform patients that the purpose of the study
is to investigate the effects of a fast-acting
intravenous antidepressant treatment on real-time
brain signal as well as to assess the test-retest
reliability of this procedure (this is to justify a second
experiment). After assessing eligibility, patients will
receive continuous infusion of the “fast-acting
intravenous antidepressant ”, which will be either naloxone (NARCAN ® injection, naloxone hcl injection. Endo 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) or saline (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection) . As previously described ( Sprenger et al., 
2011), naloxone will be administer ed in bolus of 0.15 mg naloxone per kg bodyweight or the same amount of 
saline, fifteen minutes before the experiment (Fig. 2) . Because of the relatively short half-life of naloxone, an 
additional constant intravenous infusion (dose of 0.2 mg/kg/h or saline for the duration of the fMRI experiment) 
will be administered . To control for the effects of naloxone on blood pressure, the participants ’ blood pressure 
will determined directly before and 5 minutes after drug application and at the end of the experiment. 
Inside of the scanner, participants will undergo the “Simulated Real -Time Neurofeedback” fMRI task  
(Fig.2), which consist of periods of anticipation of “drug” or “drug -free” infusion (10s), followed by [CONTACT_307933] (16s). Before the experiment, patients will be trained to expect 
positive neurofeedback and acute mood improvement in response to each “drug” infusion  and negative 
neurofeedback and acute mood-worsening in response to each “drug-free ” infusion trial . The experiment will 
consists of six 7-minute runs of 12 trials counterbalanced within and between runs. After the experiment, we 
will assess the task’s  credibility and patients who did not believe the experiment will be excluded from the 
study. All newly collected fMRI data will be analyzed using standard procedures ( Ashburner, 2007). At the 
group-level, a random effects analysis will determine the main effects of the valance (positive versus negative 
neurofeedback) resulting in statistical parametric maps (t or F statistics), which  will be thresholded with height 
and extent values generated by [CONTACT_307934] 3dClustSim to protect against overall type I error 
at p < 0.05. To control for potential confounders, sex and depression severity will be entered as covariates in 
statistical models. The whole-brain analyses will be complemented by [CONTACT_307935]-driven analyses in the rACC. 
Average BOLD signal within the rACC will be extracted and regressed against variables of interest.  
Expected Outcomes and Impact : First, we expect to demonstrate that naloxone will reverse the acute mood 
improvement and increased rACC BOLD activity induced by [CONTACT_307936] (AIM 1). Second, we expect to demonstrate that increased rACC BOLD activity induced by 
[CONTACT_307937] (AIM 2). Third, we expect to 
demonstrate that rACC BOLD activity induced by [CONTACT_307938] 
(naloxone versus saline) on acute mood improvement (AIM 3).The results from this study are expected to have 
an important impact on our ability to understand the neurobiology of placebo effects in Major Depression, to 
detect novel target for drug development and to develop imaging-based biomarkers of placebo effects.

Figure 1. Study design and contextual framing fMRI task. 
Participants underwent a randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, cross -over study of one dose of 
oral 50mg naltrexone hydrochloride (ReVia® [package insert]. Toronto, ON: Teva Canada Limited; 2015) 
(onset of action: ≥15 minutes; peak effect: ~1 hour; duration: ~24 hours) or matching pla cebo (Figure 1A). The 
two sessions occurred within 7 -10 days from one another. Naltrexone or placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_307921] 60 
minutes before the fMRI scanning session. Participants were informed that the purpose of the study was to 
investigate the effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_307922]. They were also informed about naltrexone, 
including its pharmacological properties, its general clinical use, and its possible side effects. However, they 
were not informed about the potential effects of context.  
Of the 25 enrolled participants who received the naltrexone/placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], two dropped out prior to 
scanning –  one who was claustrophobic and another who had a positive pregnancy test. We excluded three 
additional participants who did not complete their placebo session. The final sample size for the contextual 
framing task was 20 for the placebo session, and 1 7 for the naltrexone session (t hee participants did not 
complete the  fMRI sess ion naltrexone session,  but their results from their placebo session were still included in 
the analysis). The final sample size for the antidepressant placebo fMRI task was 20 for both sessions.  
Contextual Framing fMRI Task  

The contextual framing task (Figure 1B) was iteratively  refined as a simpler version of a similar task 
utilized by [CONTACT_307939] [ 39]. In th is mixed b lock/event -related d esign, participants  saw an 
emotionall y evocative/salient contextual image for 2 sec onds (Context phase) follow ed by [CONTACT_307940] 3 seconds (Emoti on & Rating). The jittered inter-trial i nterval 
was ~ 3 seconds (2-6s range, S.D.=1.1)]. 
For the contextual images, we used a total of 72 emotionally evocative color photographs  (36 pleasant 
and unpleasant i mages) f rom t he International Affecti ve Pi[INVESTIGATOR_307923] e System (IAPS) databas e [44], which c ontains 
normali zed scores of valences (pleasant = 9, unpleas ant =1) and arousal (high = 9, low = 1) for all the images. 
Based on these scores, we selected 72 contextual images  with high or low valence scores (pleasant > 7.3 and 
unpleasant <  3.4) a nd moderate a rousal score (less than 6) to avoid excessivel y salient stimuli. This 
normali zed image set p rovided the image- contex t for influenc ing the rating of ambi guous faces.   
We then generated three types of emotional faces with ambiguous expressions from th e NIM-STIM 
database (http://www.macbrain.org/resources .htm). First, we select ed images of 48 individuals’ faces that h ad 
a neutral f acial e xpres sion. Then, the neutral face image was morphed with the same individuals’ face image 
with a happy or fearful e xpres sion to generat e ambi guous faces using a face-morphing s oftware ( FantaMorph 
2.5). To maintai n the ambiguit y of facial expression, we merged morphed only 20% of happy or fearful face to 
with the neutral face.  
Prior to the fMRI scan, participants received th e following i nstructions: “You h ave tw o choices fo r rating 
each face: +  (positive), i ndicati ng that the person seems happy, pleas ed, or delighted; or - (negative), 
indicating that the person seems sad, afraid, angry, or disgusted. You will see faces o nly fo r a brief moment, so 
please respond as fast a s possible. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_307924] e with other kinds of pi[INVESTIGATOR_499].” To avoid 
partic ipants’ g uessi ng the premi se of the task, we added the followi ng instruc tion: “Pay attenti on to these non-
face p ictures b ecause y ou’ll b e asked a bout them a fterwards. But remember that your main ta sk is to ra te the 
facial e xpressions.” Participants re ported th eir responses b y clicking e ither the l eft or right index fi nger one o f 
the b uttons o f the [ADDRESS_376783] positi ve (“+”) or a left index  figure to select negati ve (“-“) during th e first 
run a nd th e opposite d uring th e second ru n. 
Participant s complet ed 144 trials (72 trials with each unique context pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], repeat ed twice) for each 
visit (Placebo and Naltr exone session). The task lasted approximatel y 20 minutes. Three types of ambiguous 
faces a ppeared e qual ti mes, and th e sex of the fa ce was randomized. The trial order s were optimi zed by  [CONTACT_307941]-o ptimize-x  tool that was implemented in MATLAB [45].  
Antidepressant Placebo fMRI Task (See figure 2 in study protocol).
Participants were informed that the purpose of the study was to investigate the neural effects of a “fast-acting 
antidepressant” c ompar ed to a “conv entional antidepressant”. In addition, participant s were told that the 
experimental p rocedur es consist ed in the administrati on of multipl e antidepressant infusi ons during an fMRI 
scanni ng sessi on wher e we recor ded their brain activity, which we called neurofeedback.  
Before entering into the scanner, a certified nurse placed an fMRI intravenous compatibl e line in the 
participant’ s arm for t he “antidepres sant” infusions. In addition, patient s watched a fragment of the task to be 
displayed inside of the scanner and were informed that the positive neurofeedback signal (higher tracing) 
reflected th e effectiveness o f the d rug infusion a nd m ight result in m ood i mprovement during th e experimental 
session, wher eas the baseli ne neurof eedback signal was unlikel y to caus e mood improvement. Once i n the 
scanner, an MRI compatibl e pump, controlled fro m outside th e scanning ro om b y pushing th e “go” trigger, 
deliver ed the saline to the participant during the scanni ng session. The infusi on was manuall y started at a 
given flow rat e and volume, at the beginni ng of each run.  
Then, participants complet ed the Antidepres sant Placebo fMRI Task, which featur es two putati ve components  
of the placebo effect: t he expect ancy and reinforcement condition, each follow ed by [CONTACT_307942] c ue, respectively. The e xpectancy c ondition i nvolves  two “antidepressant” infusion c ues – descri bed as a 
“fast-acting” a nd a “conventional antidepressant”– and two no-infusion cues – descri bed as periods of 
equipment c alibration. D uring the “antidepressant” infusi on cue (4s), a bar is filled at four 1s-periods 
representing 0%, 33%, 66% and 100% of the dose administered. During the calibration no -infusion cue (4s) 
the bar remains empty. For the reinforcement condition (10s) we used sham neurofeedback as a secondary 
reinforcer of the “antidepressant” effects. In t he high- reinforcement condition sham neurofeedback is positive 
88% of the trials (vs. 12% baseline). In the low -reinforcement condition, sham neurofeedback is positive 25% 
of the trials (vs. 75% baseline). Participants rated their expected and actual chang e in mood (YES/NO) in 
response to each infusion/neurofeedback signal respectively by [CONTACT_2329] a keypad and their index fingers.  
The combination of the expectancy and reinforcement manipulation results in 4 different conditions: 1) Infusion 
cue + High reinfo rcement, 2) Infusion cue + Low reinforcement, 3) Calibration cue + High Reinforcement and 
4) Calibration cue + Low Reinforcement. Each condition is color coded as red, blue, yellow and gr een
respectively (Fig.1). Random jitters were included between trials  and between the expectancy and t he
reinforcement manipulation. The jitter duration was randomly selected from an exponential distribution
bounded between 0.33 and 2 s. One jitter length was sampled from the uniform distribution with bounds 4 -6 s
to increase randomness.
MRI Data Acquisition 
Structural and functional MR images were collected at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_307925] a 32 -channel parallel receive -transmit head coil on a 3T Siemens PRISMA scanner 
(Munich, [LOCATION_013]) . All scanning was conducted in the afternoon ~ 1h after receiving either placebo or 
naltrexone. A sagittal, whole brain 3D magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) with repetition 
time (TR)=2400ms, echo time (TE)=2.22ms, flip angle (FA)=8deg, i nversion time (TI)=1000ms, field of view 
(FOV)=300x320, 208 slices, 0.8mm isotropic (0.4mm space between slices), with Generalized Autocalibrating  
Partial Parallel Acquisition (GRAPPA) factor of 2, and lasted ~6min 38 sec. An axial, whole brain (including cerebellum and brainstem) echo planar (EPI) T2* -weighted functional images were collected to measure the 
blood oxygen -level dependent (BOLD) respo nse with TR=1000ms, TE=30ms, FA=45º, FOV=95x95, 60 slices, 
2.3mm isotropic (no spaces), multiband factor of 5, and 1200 volumes (two 10 -minute runs). Participants were 
scanned for 90 minutes and this task start ed at approximately minute 65.  
MRI Preprocessing 
Acquired images were preprocessed using functions in the following software packages: NiPy [46], 
AFNI [47], BrainWavelet Toolbox [48] and the fMRI software library (FSL, [49] ). We have previously detailed 
this preprocessing pi[INVESTIGATOR_307926] [50]. Specific methods and programs used were outlined below.  
Anatomical images first underwent gradient unwarpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and then were registered to the M NI152 
template using both affine and nonlinear transformations methods implemented in FLIRT (FSL) and FNIRT 
(FSL), respectively. A mask of the brain was also created by [CONTACT_307943] -brain voxels from the 
anatomical images using BET (FSL) for later use in functional image co -registration.  
The functional images underwent slice timing and motion correction simultaneously using NiPy’s four -
dimensional registration algorithm SpaceTimeRealign. Running both simultaneously ensured that motion 
artifacts would not be reintroduced into the data in later processing. Non -brain voxels in the images were 
removed by [CONTACT_307944], calculated from the field map, and using brain extraction function 
BET (FSL). After intensity- normalizing every voxel to have a mean of 1000, wavelet despi[INVESTIGATOR_307927] 10. The resulting image was aligned and 
warped to their anatomical images, resampled to 3mm isotropic voxels, and warped into MNI152 standard 
space. A 7mm full -width at half maximum kernel was used to smooth the images spatially and a high -pass filter 
was applied to remove signal slower than 0.[ADDRESS_376784] of context on happy faces 
(1 for pleasant context/happy faces, -1 for unplea sant context/happy faces, 0 for the remaining condition s), and 
another one for the effect of context on fearful faces (1 for pleasant context/fearful faces, -1 for unpleasant context/fearful faces, 0 for the remaining condition). We also included a trial regressor of no interest.  We aligned the boxcar regressors with trial onset (length = trial duration) and convolved then with the hemodynamic response function. We then used the resulting time-series to regress against BOLD signal for each run and participant, and constructed contrasts for each regressor (i.e., emotion, context type, emotion x context type interaction).   MRI First Level Analysis of the Antidepressant Placebo fMRI Task: We constructed four event regressors: infusion event, expectancy ratings event, neurofeedback event and mood ratings event. We constructed two additional regressors for the expectancy manipulation, coded as 1 or -1 (“antidepressant” infusion cue or calibration no-infusion cue, respectively) and the reinforcement manipulation, coded as 1 or - 1 (positive or baseline sham neurofeedback, respectively). The expectancy manipulation regressor was aligned to the infusion event and the expectancy ratings event, whereas the reinforcement manipulation event was aligned to the neurofeedback event and the mood ratings event. For all models we convolved boxcar regressors with the HRF and the used general linear models using FSL FEAT for each run and participant.   Group Level Statistical Analysis. We conducted group level voxel-wise analyses using randomize in FSL. We used threshold-free cluster enhancement to determine significant clusters (1-p > 0.05).  For each contrast we conducted one-sample t-tests during the placebo session only. We then conducted paired samples t-test for each contrast (Placebo > Naltrexone and Naltrexone > Placebo).

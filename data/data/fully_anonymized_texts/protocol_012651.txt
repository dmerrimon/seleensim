complete response (CR) per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_123047] experienced 
radiographic disease progression at the discretio n of the investigator according to the criteria 
in Section 5.1.4; this re-treatment will be th e Second Course Phase.  Response or progression 
in the Second Course Phase will not count towards the ORR and PFS of the primary endpoint 
in this trial.   
After the end of treatment, each patient will  be followed for a minimum of 30 days for 
adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events  will be collected for up to 90 days after the 
end of treatment).  Subjects will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status until death, 
withdrawing consent, or becoming lost to follow-up.   
Participation in this trial w ill be dependent upon supplying tumor tissue from either a newly 
obtained formalin-fixed specimen, or an olde r formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimen 
from locations not radiated prior to biopsy. Newly obtained formalin-fixed specimens are 
strongly encouraged unless clinically contrain dicated as deemed by [CONTACT_1963]. If 
new scientific data emerge that indicate that  an existing biopsy or surgical specimen is 
suboptimal for identification of patients, only new biopsies will be acceptable for 
determination of PD-L1 status.  The specimen will be evaluated at a central laboratory 
facility for expression status of PD-L1 in a prospective manner.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety assessments during the Phase II expansion 
 This investigator initia ted study will be under the oversight of the Fred 
Hutchinson/University of Washington Can cer Consortium IRB and Data and Safety 
Monitoring committee. The i nvestigators are ultimately responsible for monitoring the safety of 
patients who have entered this study and for alerting the Consortium IRB to any event that seems 
unusual in accordance with IRB policy. The investigator is responsible for the appropriate 
medical care of patients during the study. The investigator remains responsible to follow, through 
an appropriate health care option, adverse events that are serious or that caused the patient to 
discontinue before completing the study. The patient should be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes. Frequency of follow-up is left to the discretion of the investigator.  
Safety measurements that will be used in the study include physical examinations and 
clinical laboratory tests (hematology and blood chemistries). The adverse event will be graded 
for toxicity using the NCI CTC version 4.0. Toxicity assessment will occur at the start of each 
cycle, or more frequently if clinically indicated. Any adverse events leading to a treatment interruption or dose reduction along with all adverse events that are grade 3 and higher will be 
recorded in the CRF. Adverse Events that meet [COMPANY_006]’s definition of Event of Clinical Interest 
(refer to the Pembrolizumab ECI guidance document) will also be recorded. 
The criteria for dose de-escalation for adverse events are outlined in Section 5.2.  Any 
patient who requires two dose modifications or de-escalations will be taken off study.

has led to expansion of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas in ongoing studies.8  
 4.1.2.  Salivary Gland Malignancies Salivary gland carcinomas represent <5% of all head and neck malignancies and are 
characterized by [CONTACT_110517] c and biologic diversity.  Th ese arise from the secretory 
acini and associated myoepi[INVESTIGATOR_110493], and minor 
salivary glands located throughout the upper aer odigestive epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].  The current WHO 
histological classification iden tifies [ADDRESS_123055] of care for th e treatment of incurable (unresectable and 
metastatic)  salivary gland malignancies.  Clinic al trials that have examined the activity of 
systemic therapy have been difficult to interpre t due to small numbers,  heterogeneous patient 
populations, and the frequent observation of prol onged stable disease, a likely reflection of 
the  indolent biology of certain sa livary gland tumors, such as adenoid cystic carcinomas.   
Historical regimens tested more than [ADDRESS_123056] employed ci splatin and cisplatin-
based combinations (respons e rates of 20% or lower).[ADDRESS_123057] exam ined single agent paclitaxel (response rate 
26% in non-adenoid cystic carcinoma subtypes, 0 in adenoid cystic carcinomas), and a gemcitabine carboplatin combin ation (response rate 24%).
12, 13 In these two studies median 
progression free survival was 5-6 months and median overall  survival was 12-14 months, 
(KM estimates of 1 year overall survival 50% , 3 year overall survival 25%.)  Even lower 
response rates have been demonstrated with pr ospective evaluation of the activity of various 
molecular targeted agents such as trastuzumab, gefitinib, imatinib and lapatinib, with essentially no objective response rates noted.

Immunotherapy and anti-PD-1 targeted approaches  are unexplored in this disease. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_110494]’s infrequency, this popu lation is overrepresented in our tertiary clinical practice.  
Another advantage to studying th is disease is the often a bundant archived tissue (most 
patients undergo upfront curative intent rese ction) and the relative ease of obtaining 
additional tissue from accessible anatomical lo cations (upper aerodigestiv e tract and cervical 
lymph nodes).

4.1.3 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background 
[IP_ADDRESS] MK-[ADDRESS_123061] immune surveillan ce in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades.23  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor-infiltrating lympho cytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies.24-28  In particular, the presence of CD 8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ 
effector T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and 
long-term survival in many solid tumors. 
The PD-[ADDRESS_123062] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548].  The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T-
cells under healthy conditions, is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig 
superfamily member related to CD28 and C TLA-4 which has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD-L2)].  The structure of murine PD-1 has been reso lved.  PD-1 and family members are type I 
transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig  Variable-type (V-type) domain responsible 
for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling 
molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 c ontains 2 tyrosine-based  signaling motifs, an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition mo tif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-
based switch motif (ITSM).  Fo llowing T-cell stimulation, PD -[ADDRESS_123063] from that of CTLA-4 as both molecules 
regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_110495]. PD-1 was shown to be expressed on 
activated lymphocytes includi ng peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, T regs and 
natural killer cells. Expression has also b een shown during thymic development on CD4-
CD8- (double negative) T-cells as well as subs ets of macrophages and de ndritic cells].  The 
ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are const itutively expressed or can be induced in a

notably on vascular endothelium , whereas PD-L2 protein is on ly detectably expressed on 
antigen-presenting cells  found in lymphoid tissue or chroni c inflammatory environments.  
PD-L2 is thought to control im mune T-cell activation in ly mphoid organs, whereas PD-L1 
serves to dampen unwarranted T-cell function in peripheral tissues.  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD-L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T-cell inhibitor.  PD-1 has been suggested to regul ate tumor-specific T-cell 
expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL).  This suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway 
plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be cons idered as an attractive target 
for therapeutic intervention. 
MK-3475 (previously known as SCH 900475) is a potent and highly selective humanized 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the 
interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vorinostat 
Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are enzymes that catalyze the removal of  acetyl groups from 
the lysine residues of proteins , including histones and transcri ption factors. HDAC inhibitors 
can induce tumor cell growth arrest, differentia tion, or apoptosis in vitro and inhibit tumor 
growth in animals. The transcription of genes is regulated at least in  part by [CONTACT_110518]. The core nucleosomal hi stones are the most wi dely studied of the 
proteins that become acetylated following inhibition of HDAC activity12. In some cancer 
cells, there is an overexpressi on of HDACs, or an aberrant  recruitment of HDACs to 
oncogenic transcription factors causing  hypoacet ylation of core nucleosomal histones.  
Hypoacetylation of histones is associated with a condensed chromatin structure and 
repression of gene transcripti on. Inhibition of HDAC activity allows for the accumulation of 
acetyl groups on the histone lysine residues re sulting in an open chromatin structure and 
transcriptional activation.  
Vorinostat is a potent inhibitor of HDAC activity and binds directly to the catalytic pocket of 
HDAC  enzymes. Vorinostat, at low nanomolar  concentrations, inhibits the enzymatic 
activity of HDAC1,  HDAC2 and HDAC3 (Cla ss I) and HDAC6 (Class II). Concentrations 
of vorinostat that cause the accu mulation of acetylated histones also induces cell cycle arrest, 
differentiation or apoptosis of transformed cells.  Vorinostat induces apoptosis in a wide 
variety of transformed cells in culture, including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cell lines, circulating atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] T-ce lls derived from patients with CTCL, human lymphoma cell 
lines and murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Vorinostat also inhibits proliferation of 
cultured transformed human cells derived from leukemias, non-small cell lung carcinomas, colon carcinomas, central nervous  system tumors, melanomas, ova rian carcinomas,renal cell 
carcinomas, prostate and breast cancers. In cultured human transformed cell lines, vorinostat

4.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification   
An open-label Phase I trial (KEYNOTE-001) is being conducted to eval uate the safety and 
clinical activity of single agent pembroli zumab (MK-3475). The dose escalation portion of 
this trial evaluated three dos e levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 
weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced soli d tumors. All three dose levels were well 
tolerated and no dose-limiting t oxicities were observed. Th is first in human study of 
pembrolizumab (MK-3475) showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of 
tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg /kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/ kg Q2W). No MTD has 
been identified. 
 
In KEYNOTE-001, several randomized cohort evalua tions of melanoma subjects receiving 
pembrolizumab (MK-3475) at doses of 2 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg Q3W have been completed, 
and dose intervals of Q3W versus Q2W have also  been completed. The clinical efficacy and 
safety data demonstrate a lack of clinically  important differences in efficacy response or 
safety profile at either dose or either interval.  PK data analysis of pembrolizumab admini stered Q2W and Q3W s howed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of  distribution, and a long ha lf -life (refe r to IB). 
Pharmacodynamic data (IL-2 release assay) sugg ested that peripheral ta rget engagement is 
durable (>21 days). This early PK and pharm acodynamic data provides scientific rationale 
for testing a Q3W dosing schedule. Because Q3W dosing is more convenient for patients, Q3W dosing has been selected for all pembrolizumab studies. 
 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropr iate dose for fixed dosing is based on 
simulations performed using a population PK mo del of pembrolizumab which revealed that 
the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks provides exposures that 1) are optimally consistent 
with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient

exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal 
efficacy response and 3) will maintain individu al patients exposure in the exposure range 
established in melanoma that are well tole rated and safe. KEYNOTE-012 initially studied

and MK-3475. Therefore a phase I/II design, wherein a limited phase I run in cohort is 
initially enrolled, was felt to be most appropriate to study this combination, with safety and 
tolerability as the primary endpoint of interest. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Endpoints 
There is intriguing preclinical and clinical data s uggesting that epi[INVESTIGATOR_110498]-1 expression in tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes and augment the immunologic an ti-tumor response to MK-3475.  Therefore 
exploring objective response ra tes to the combination of MK-3475 and vorinostat will be 
secondary endpoints.  Over all survival and progression free su rvival will be examined in the 
entire cohort enrolled.   If encouraging response rates, a nd overall and progression free 
survival are observed in this cohort of patients, further study of the combination in this 
disease will be justified. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Biomarker Research 
Archival tissue will be collected from all pa tients participating in the study. Every attempt 
will be made to obtain fresh tissue after tr eatment with 3 cycles of the MK-3475 and 
vorinostat combination regardless of response to treatment. These samples will be submitted 
to [COMPANY_006] for tissue based assays. 
Research serum samples will be obtained at the following timepoints ba seline, after 3 cycles 
MK-3475 and vorinostat and at treatment disc ontinuation or disease progression. We intend 
to perform flow cytometric  evaluation of CD 3, CD4, CD8, CD14, PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 on 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

5.1 Entry Criteria for Treatment at Trial Entry 
5.1.1 Diagnosis/Condition for Entry into the Trial 
Phase I run in: biopsy proven RMHNSCC with the following primary sites: 
nasopharynx, paranasal sinus, nasa l cavity, skin/cutaneous sites.  Patients with unknown head 
and neck primary sites will be enrolled.  Patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell 
carcinomas of the head and neck (regardless of primary site) who ar e either unwilling to 
receive or have contraindica tions (deemed by [CONTACT_110519]) to standard systemic 
chemotherapy will also be eligible. Patients with biopsy proven RMSGC be eligible as well. 
Since our center will be participating in a separate MK-3475 clin ical trial (Keynote-
40), the above group of patient will be priori tized for the phase I run in portion, and avoid 
overlap with Keynote -40. 
Phase II expansion: biopsy proven RMHNS CC of any primary site (including 
unknown primary) and RMSGC will be eligible.

2. No decline in ECOG performance status 
3. Absence of rapid disease progression 
4. Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g. cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternativ e medical intervention. 
Patients who receive a confirmed CR on trial may consider discontinuation of treatment.   Upon progression they can be retreated on a seco nd course of therapy according to Table 2.1. 
patients who progress on the second course of therapy are off study.  
5.2.1 Dose Selection/Modification 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Selection 
The rationale for selection of dos e of MK-3475 to be used in this  trial is provided in Section 
4.0 – Background and Rationale.   
Since MK-3475 will be dosed as a flat dose th ere will be no requirement to calculate a 
dose/kg for each patient unless a dose reduction is needed.

The approved dose of vorinostat is 400mg QD for CTCL. However, published clinical 
experience in additional clinical trials has suggested that dosing at 400 mg 5 out of 7 days 
reduces toxicity and increases tolerability of the drug comp ared to daily 400 mg use.  
Consequently, we propose the 5 out 7 day schedule for this trial.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Modifications for MK-3475 and Vorinostat 
Toxicity will be graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE version 4.0). The protocol will change to CTCAE version 5.0 if is published within 
the course of the trial.  
Because it there may be overlap in the toxicities of both agents, and difficulty in attributing 
toxicity to either agent, patients experiencing any Grade 3 toxicity (except those outlined in 
Table 3.1  and Section [IP_ADDRESS]) or any Grade [ADDRESS_123098] occurred after the previous treatment.  All Grade 3 or 4 toxicities  
(except those specif ied in Table 3.1 and Secti on [IP_ADDRESS])  should resolve to Grade [ADDRESS_123099] severity.

Grade 1 or higher Diarrhea. Non-prescrip tion methods to improve diarrhea include: 
diet modification (increased fiber, certain brands of yogurt, such as Probiotics), and 
hydration. Anti-diarrheal prescriptions medications include: loperamide and 
diphenoxylate with atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Consider giving the patient a prescription for an 
antidiarrheals to be filled if need ed on the first day of therapy. 
 
 
2. Enterocolitis 
 
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of  enterocolitis (such 
as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of 
bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs  and ileus).  In symptomatic subjects, 
infectious etiologies should be ruled out, and if sympto ms are persistent and/or 
severe, endoscopic evaluati on should be considered. 
 In subjects with severe enterocolitis  (Grade 3), MK-3475 will be permanently 
discontinued and treatment with systemic cor ticosteroids should be initiated at a dose 
of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equi valent.  When symptoms improve to Grade 
[ADDRESS_123111] 1 month. 
 In subjects with moderate enterocolitis (Grade 2), MK-3475 should be withheld and 
anti-diarrheal treatment should be started.  If  symptoms are persistent for more than 
one week, systemic corticosteroids s hould be initiated (e.g., 0.5 mg/kg/day of 
prednisone or equivalent).  When sy mptoms improve to Grade [ADDRESS_123112] 1 month.  Regarding 
guidelines for continuing treatment with MK-3475, see Section 5.2.  Additional data regarding management of this immune related adverse event will be included in Appendix 12.8

will result in stepwise dose reduction as outlined in Tables 3.1. and 3.2. Until resolution of the toxicity to Grade 1 or less or to baseline, MK-3475 and vorinostat 
are  to be held.  
 
Supportive care for Nausea/Vomiting : Some patients will experience nausea 
following vorinostat or the combination, genera lly mild-to-moderate in severity. With 
subsequent cycles, many patients note that the sensation of nausea becomes less. Once documented nausea and/or vomiting has been observed, the use of antiemetics per institutional guidelines is strongly en couraged. Non-prescription methods to 
improve nausea include: antacids, antiulc er drugs, ginger ale or ginger lozenges. 
Encourage each patient to drink at leas t 2 liters of fluid each day to avoid 
dehydration. Anti-emetic prescriptions medications include: prochlorperazine,

lorazepam, or any of the 5-HT3 reuptak e inhibitors (grani setron; ondansetron; 
palonosetron; dolasetron; or tropi[INVESTIGATOR_14960]). Consider giving  the patient a prescription 
for an anti-emetics to be filled if needed on the first day of therapy. 
 
Dehydration should be managed with aggressi ve hydration (either in travenous or oral 
fluids). Patients should be  strongly encouraged to main tain significant oral fluid 
intake. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Initiation of subsequent cycles of therapy:  
 
 MK-3475 and vorinostat are to be started on the same day.  If an increase in MK-
3475 dosing interval is required according to  Table 3.1, vorinostat will be taken 5 out 
of 7 days for every week of the MK-3475 dosing interval.  
 
 A new course of treatment may begin on th e scheduled Day 1 of a new cycle if all 
non-hematological toxicity from the previous cycle has recovered to ≤Grade 1 or 
baseline, and/or hematologic recovery documented as outlined in section [IP_ADDRESS].  
 
Initiation of subsequent cycles of therapy may be delayed for up to 12 weeks to allow 
recovery from all drug-related toxicity. A lternately, the Investigator may choose to 
administer supportive care (blood product transfusions) for retreatm ent criteria to be met. If 
the recovery criteria are not met after a 12-week delay, the pa tient will be discontinued from 
study treatment unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_110503], the patient is experiencing a clinical 
benefit, in which case a decision regarding continuation of treatment will be made on an 
individual patient basis in cons ultation with the [COMPANY_006]  medical monitor. Justification will be 
recorded in the source documents. 
 When initiating a subsequent cycle, a minimu m interval of 21 days should be observed 
between  MK-3475 administrations (with no minimum interval for vorinostat).  
 
Continuation of study therapy during a cycle: 
 
Within any cycle, the dose/schedule of either  study drug may be adjusted as necessary.   
 
5.2.2. Timing of Dose Administration 
Vorinostat and MK-3475 dose will both be initiate d on day 1 of each treatment cycle after all 
procedures/assessments have been completed as  detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section

Oral vorinostat (400 mg) administered is onc e daily by [CONTACT_110523] 0-30 
minutes after a meal (if possible) for days 1- 5 of each week in a week (21 day) treatment 
cycle. For any patient experien cing Grade 1 or higher drug-relate d fatigue, the Investigator 
should advise the patient to administer vorinostat prior to bedtime (See Section [IP_ADDRESS]). On 
the day that MK-3475 is administered patien t should take vorinostat a minimum of 2 hours 
before the MK-3475 infusion.  
For patients unable to swallow pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], vori nostat will be administered as a 50mg/mL 
suspension.  This solution will be prepared by [CONTACT_110524].  Gastro stomy tubes will be flushed with 20 mL of 
water before and after the suspension is admi nistered.  The dosing a nd dose reductions will 
follow Table 3.2. MK-3475 will be administered as a 30 minute IV  infusion (treatment cycle intervals may be 
increased due to toxicity as described in S ection [IP_ADDRESS]).  Sites should make every effort to 
target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given the 
variability of infusion pumps from site to site , a window of -/ +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., 
infusion time is 30 minutes: - /+10 min). 
5.3 Trial Blinding/Masking 
This is an open-label trial; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator, and subject will know the 
treatment administered. 
5.4 Randomization or Treatment Allocation 
All patients enrolled in this study will rece ive the combination of MK-3475 and vorinostat. 
5.5 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited) 
Medications or vaccinations sp ecifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If ther e is a clinical indication for one  of these or other medications 
or vaccinations specifically prohibited during th e trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this 
with the Sponsor.  The final de cision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the 
investigator and/or the subject 's primary physician.  However, the decision to continue the 
subject on trial therapy or vaccination schedu le requires the mutual  agreement of the 
Investigator, the Sponsor, and the subject.  Hematopoetic growth factors will not be perm itted in patients enrolled on this study. 
5.5.[ADDRESS_123116]’s welfare may be

 Immune-related adverse events: Please s ee Section [IP_ADDRESS] below and the separate 
Pembrolizumab ECI guidance document regarding diagnosis and management of 
adverse experiences of a poten tial immunologic etiology.   
 Management of Infusion Reactions:  Acute infusion reactions (which can include cytokine release syndrome, angioedema, or anaphylaxis) are different from allergic/hypersensitiv e reactions, although some of the manifestations are common to 
both AEs.  Signs and symptoms  usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion 
and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of comple tion of infusion. 
Signs/symptoms may include: Allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (including drug 
fever); Arthralgia (joint pain); Bronchospasm; Cough; Dizziness; Dyspnea (shortness 
of breath); Fatigue (asthenia, lethar gy, malaise); Headache; Hypertension; 
Hypotension; Myalgia (muscle pain); Naus ea; Pruritis/itching; Rash/desquamation; 
Rigors/chills; Sweating (diaphoresis); T achycardia; Tumor pain (onset or 
exacerbation of tumor pain due to treatm ent); Urticaria (hives, welts, wheals); 
Vomiting.

5.7 Diet/Activity/Other Considerations 
5.7.[ADDRESS_123131]-feeding women may be enro lled if they are willing to use 2 methods of 
birth control or are considered highly unlikely to conceive.  Highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥45 years of age 
and has not had menses for greater than 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not 
heterosexually active for the duration of the st udy.  The two birth control methods can be 
either two barrier methods or a barrier met hod plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. 
Subjects should start using birth control from  study Visit [ADDRESS_123132] ( β-hCG)

vorinostat, and for 30 days after the comple tion of study drug administration.  Women of 
childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregna nt while receiving 
treatment with vorinostat.     The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contracepti on: diaphragm, condom 
(by [CONTACT_3969]), copper intrau terine device, sponge, or spermicide.  Appropriate hormonal 
contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an 
estrogen and/or a progestational agent (incl uding oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or 
intramuscular agents). Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to o ccur during the study.  In order to participate 
in the study they must adhere to the cont raception requirement (described above) for the 
duration of the study and during the follow-up period defined in sect ion 7.2.2-Reporting of 
Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor and to Me rck.  If there is any question that a subject

vorinostat, the subject will immediately be remo ved from the study.  The site will contact [CONTACT_110528]’s status until th e pregnancy has been 
completed or terminated.  The outcome of the pr egnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and 
to [COMPANY_006] without delay and with in 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience 
(e.g., death, abortion, congenital an omaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication 
to the mother or newborn).  The study inve stigator will make ev ery effort to obtain 
permission to follow the outcome of the pregna ncy and report the condition of the fetus or 
newborn to the Sponsor.   If a male subject  impregnates his female partner the study 
personnel at the site must be informed i mmediately and the pre gnancy reported to the 
Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] and followed as described above and in Section 7.2.2. 
It is not known if vorinostat may cause fetal ha rm when administered to  a pregnant woman.  
There are no adequate and well-controlled stud ies of vorinostat in pregnant women.  Results 
of animal studies indicate that vorinostat crosse s the placenta and is found in fetal plasma at 
levels up to 50% of maternal concentrations.  Doses up to 50 and 150 mg/kg/day were tested 
in rats and rabbits, respectively (~0.5 times  the human exposure based on AUC0-24 hours).  
Treatment-related developmenta l effects including decreased mean live fetal weights, 
incomplete ossifications of the skull, thorac ic vertebra, sterna, an d skeletal variations 
(cervical ribs, supernumerary ribs, vertebral coun t and sacral arch variations) in rats at the 
highest doses of vorinostat test ed.  Reductions in mean live fetal weight and an elevated 
incidence of incomplete ossification of the me tacarpals were seen in rabbits dosed at 150 
mg/kg/day.   
The no observed effect levels (NOELs) for th ese findings were 15 and 50 mg/kg/day (<0.1 
times the human exposure based on AUC) in rats and rabbits, respectively.  A dose related 
increase in the incidence of ma lformations of the gall bladder was noted in all drug treatment 
groups in rabbits versus the concurrent control.   If the drug is used during pregnancy, or if 
the patient becomes pregnant while taking this  drug, the patient should be apprised of the 
potential hazard to the fetus. 
5.7.[ADDRESS_123137]-feedi ng are not eligible for enrollment. 
It is not known whether vorinostat is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are 
excreted in human milk and beca use of the potential for serious adverse r eactions in nursing 
infants from vorinostat, a de cision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or 
discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Protocol/Amendment No.:  Version [ADDRESS_123139] Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria 
Subjects may withdraw consent at  any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the 
discretion of the investigator s hould any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_80074], the 
trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reas ons.  Specific details 
regarding discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in Section 7.1.4 – Other Procedures. 
A subject must be discontinued from th e trial for any of the following reasons: 
 The subject or legal represen tative (such as a parent or  legal guardian) withdraws 
consent. 
 Confirmed radiographic disease progression 
Note : For unconfirmed radiographic diseas e progression, please see Section 5.2.2 
Note : A subject may be granted an excepti on to continue on treatment with 
confirmed radiographic progression if clinically stable or clinically improved, 
please see Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
 Unacceptable adverse experiences as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
 Investigator’s decision to  withdraw the subject 
 The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test 
 Noncompliance with trial treatme nt or procedure requirements 
 The subject is lost to follow-up 
 Completed 24 months of treatment with MK-3475 
Note: [ADDRESS_123140] dose. Subjects 
who stop MK-3475 after 24 months may be e ligible for up to one year of additional 
study treatment if they progress after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_110506] 5.1.4 
 Administrative reasons 
The End of Treatment and Follow-up visit procedur es are listed in Section 6 (Protocol Flow 
Chart) and Section 7.1.5 (Visit Requirements).  After the end of treatment, each subject will 
be followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events will be collected for 90 days after the end of treatment as describe d in Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Subjects

Protocol/Amendment No.:  Version [ADDRESS_123142] Replacement Strategy 
Replacement of Patients in DLT Period 
Patients who received <90% of  the MK-3475 infusion in Cycle 1 (e.g., because the infusion 
had to be discontinued due to an infusion reactio n) and did not experience a DLT will not be 
taken into account in the assess ment of the overall DLT rate for the phase I run in cohort and 
need to be replaced. 
If a patient experiences a DLT in Cycle 1, study therapy may be discontinued following 
discussion and agreement between the Sponsor and Investigator.  An alternative 
consideration may be dose modifications of Vorinostat and MK-3475 as described in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]  with continued therapy. 
Specific procedures to be performed during the tr ial, as well as their prescribed times and 
associated visit windows, are outlined in the Tr ial Flow Chart - Section 6.0. Details of each 
procedure are provided in Sec tion 7.0 – Trial Procedures. 
5.10 Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination 
Early trial termination will be the result of the criteria specified below: 1. Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccurate or incomplete 
2. Poor adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements 
3. Incidence or severity of adverse drug reaction in this or other studies indicates a potential 
health hazard to subjects 
4. Plans to modify or discontinue the development of the study drug 
In the event of [COMPANY_006] decision to no longe r supply study drug, ample notification will be 
provided so that appropriate adjustment s to subject treatment can be made.

7.0 TRIAL PROCEDURES 
7.1 Trial Procedures 
The Trial Flow Chart - Section 6.0 summarizes th e trial procedures to be performed at each 
visit.  Individual trial procedur es are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to 
perform these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_1275]. 
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1052]/or 
[COMPANY_006] for reasons related to s ubject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be 
potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may 
require that additional informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such 
evaluations/testing will be performed in  accordance with those regulations. 
7.1.1 Administrative Procedures 
[IP_ADDRESS] Informed Consent 
The Investigator must obtain documented cons ent from each potential subject prior to 
participating in a clinical trial.

acceptable representative’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a consent form along with the dated signature 
[CONTACT_110542] e consent discussion.  
A copy of the signed and dated consent form  should be given to the subject before 
participation in the trial. 
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form 
and any written information provided to the subject must receive the IRB/ERC’s approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_19349].  The subject or his/her legally acceptable 
representative should be informed in a timel y manner if new information becomes available 
that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness  to continue participation in the trial.  The 
communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent 
form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the subject’s dated signature [CONTACT_90096] [CONTACT_423]’s legally acceptable re presentative’s dated signature. 
The informed consent will adhere to IRB/ERC re quirements, applicable laws and regulations 
and Sponsor requirements.

unfavorable and unintended sign (including an  abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-
specified procedure, whether or not considered  related to the medicinal product or protocol-
specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., a ny clinically significant adverse change in 
frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting co ndition that is temporally associated with the 
use of the [COMPANY_006]’s product, is  also an adverse event. 
Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in 
frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events.  
Examples of this may include, but are not lim ited to, teething, typi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l crying in infants and 
children and onset of menses or menopause occurring at a physiologically appropriate time.

the treatment of overdose of MK-3475. In the event of overdose, MK-[ADDRESS_123174] should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate 
supportive treatment should be prov ided if clinic ally indicated. 
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“ results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] product, 
the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious  adverse event, even if no other seriousness 
criteria are met. 
If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product meeting the protocol  definition of overdos e is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal la boratory results, the overdose is reported as a 
non-serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.” 
An overdose for vorinostat will be defined as any dose of study drug(s) that is 10% or 
more over the prescribed dose per cycle as de scribed in the study protocol. No specific 
information is available on the treatment of overdose of vorinostat. There is no specific 
antidote for vorinostat overdose. In clinical studies, the highest total daily doses tested 
were 600 mg (once daily), 800 mg (400 mg twice daily) and 900 mg (300 mg three times 
daily). In four patients who took more than the recommended study dose (without exceeding the highest doses tested), no adverse experiences were reported. The 
pharmacological effects may be prolonged after serum levels of active vorinostat are no 
longer present. It is not known if vorinostat is dialyzable. In the event of overdose, vorinostat should be held and the patient should be observed closely for signs of 
toxicity. As clinically indica ted, appropriate supportive treatment should be provided, if 
applicable.

 Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive interven tion indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL.
 Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110508] n indicated; 
disabling; limiting self-care ADL.
 Grade 4 Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
 Grade [ADDRESS_123183] that: 
 † Results in death ; or 
 † Is life threatening; or  places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediat e risk of death from the event as it occurred (Note: This does  not include an 
adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.); or 
 † Results in a persistent or si gnificant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or 
 † Results in or prolongs an exis ting inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110509], regardless of length of stay, even if the

condition which has not worsened does not constitute a serious adverse event.); or 
 † Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis);or 
 Is a new  cancer;  (that is not a condition of the study) or 
 Is an overdose  (whether accidental or intentional).  An y adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious adverse event. An overdose that is not 
associated with an adverse event is considered a non-serious event of clinical interest and must be reported within [ADDRESS_123184] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed previously (designated above by a †). 
Duration Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less th an [ADDRESS_123185] to be discontinued? 
Relationship to test drug  Did the [COMPANY_006] product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse ev ent will be provided by [CONTACT_26368] a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that su pports the causality noted on the AE 
form, ensures that a medically qualified a ssessment of causality was done. This initiale d document must be retained for the req uired regulatory time frame. The 
criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist th e investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship be tween the test drug and the adverse event 
based upon the available information.  The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the [COMPANY_006] product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event (AE): 
 Exposure Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to th e [COMPANY_006] product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance a ssessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_9650], diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or  measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen? 
 Time Course Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the [COMPANY_006] product?  Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug-induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product) ? 
 Likely Cause Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other drug(s)/v accine(s), or other host or e nvironmental 
factors

All Adverse Events will be repo rted to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators in 
accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations.  
8.[ADDRESS_123188] 6 patients enrolled in this study will co nstitute the phase I component of the clinical 
trial.  All patients enrolled in the study will be analyzed for the safety and efficacy endpoints 
of the study. 
This will be a single arm phase II study which will enroll 35 patients in Cohort 1 and 35 
patients in Cohort 2.  All patients enrolled in the study (both in the phase I run in and phase II expansion) will be analyzed for the safety  and efficacy endpoints of the study. For both 
Cohorts, using a 1-sided 0.07 level (exact)  test  with a null hypothesis of 20% response rate 
to the MK-3475 and vorinostat combination, an alternative of 40%, a nd 89% power (exact), 
11/35 (31%) responses would be considered evid ence to rule out an RR of < 20%. With 35 
patients, frequencies can be estimated to within 17% with  95% confidence.

12.4 Immune Response Criteria 
For all patients who experience disease progression on study, the date noted for of disease 
progression is the time of the scan where it is originally detected, and not the following date 
of the confirmatory scan. 
Definitions of measurable and non-measurable disease 
Measurable disease: Neoplastic masses that can be precisely measured in [ADDRESS_123209] a 
short-axis line-length of ≥ [ADDRESS_123210] perpendicular. 
Non-measurable disease : Non-measurable lesions are those that are not suitable for 
quantitative assessment over time. These include: 
1) Neoplastic masses that are too small to measure, because their longest uninterrupted 
diameter or longest perpendicu lar are less than 10 mm or two times the axial slice thickness. 
2) Neoplastic masses whose boundaries cannot be distinguished.  This includes masses which 
cannot be demarcated from surrounding tissue becau se of inadequate contrast, masses with 
overly complex morphology, or those with highly heterogeneous tissue composition. 
3) Other types of lesions that are confidently fe lt to represent neoplastic tissue, but difficult to 
quantify in a reproducible manner. These in clude bone metastases, leptomeningeal 
metastases, malignant ascites, pleural/pericardi al effusions, inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesi ons, ill defined abdominal masses, etc. 
For irRC, only target lesions selected at ba seline and measurable new lesions are taken 
into account.

Protocol/Amendment No.:  Version [ADDRESS_123212] perpendicular 
diameters (SPD) of all index lesions  (five lesions per organ, up to 10 visceral lesions and 
five cutaneous index lesions) is calculated. 
At each subsequent tumor assessment, the SPD of  the index lesions and of new, measurable 
lesions (≥5 X 5 mm; up to 5 new lesions per organ: 5 new cutaneous lesions and 10 visceral 
lesions) are added together to provide the total time-point tumor burden . 
Overall response using irRC: 
 Complete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all tumor lesions (whether 
measureable or not, and no new lesions).  CR must be confirmed by [CONTACT_491], 
consecutive assessments made no less than [ADDRESS_123213] documented. 
 Partial Response (irPR): Decrease in SPD of 50% or greater by a consecutive 
assessment at least [ADDRESS_123214] documentation. 
 Stable Disease (irSD): Failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR, in absence of irPD. 
 Progressive Disease (irPD): At least 25% increase in SPD relative to nadir 
(minimum recorded tumor burden) Confir mation by a repeat, consecutive assessment 
no less than [ADDRESS_123215] documented. 
Please note other key differences between  irRC and the original WHO criteria: 
New measurable lesions will be incorporated into the SPD New non measurable lesions do not de fine progression but  preclude irCR 
Non-index lesions contribute to defining irCR (complete disappearance required).

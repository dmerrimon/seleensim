1. Introduction 
This document is a protocol for a human research study.  This study will be conducted 
according to US and international sta ndards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 
312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_534752] of care, patients are subjected to incredibly painful procedures including debridement, 
wound care, and physical and occupational therapy. Current practice guidelines 
recommend early analgesic intervention with a standardized approach for the management of pain associated with burn -care treatments. (Faucher et al, 2006)   
The impact of inadequate control of procedural pain has been associated with 
psychological complications including increases in anxiety, background pain, and 
future procedural pain.(Summer et al, 2007)  The psychological responses of 
sustained anxiety associated with anticipation of heightened procedural pain or exacerbation of background pain, is associated with an increase in sympathetic 
activation resulting in the release of catecholamines and changes  in local blood flow 
which lower the nociceptive threshold and sensitize the wound. (Chapman et al, 
1986; Zimmerman, 1984)  Additionally, muscl e tension in the area of burn injury 
can occur with anxiety to an extent that local nociceptors are activated. Anxiety can 
also potentiate the perception of pain through triggering of higher brain centers and 
memories of the previous trauma.(Meyer et al, 2 002) These psychological and 
physiological factors associated with sustained and significant anxiety intensify in a 
positive feedback phenomenon known as the “wind- up phenomenon”, contributing 
to the immense challenges of providing adequate pain management  and ultimately 
decreasing quality of life in patients experiencing burn care interventions.(Chapman et al, 1986)   Multiple dressing changes and treatments over the course of the burn 
patients recovery can increase fear and anxiety. Patients report feeling s of 
helplessness, and loss of control.(Esfahlan et al, 2010)  To date, only two studies 
guide benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_423349].(Bidwell et al, 2012; Patterson et al, 1997)   
A limitatio n of this current practice is that medications are administered at the 
nurses’ discretion based on subjective observations of a patient’s anxiety. There is 
no opportunity for patients to engage in anxiety self -management. Clearly, 
innovative interventions are needed that are safe and feasible to implement that 
effectively manage the significant anxiety in patients undergoing burn- care dressing 
changes.   
  
Numerous studies have demonstrated that patient controlled analgesia in burn 
patients is beneficial given the patient can self -titrate medication need according to 
individual requirements that are not controlled by [CONTACT_15370]. (Prakash et al, 
2004; Kinsella et al, 1988)  The wide variations associated with clinician -delivered 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_423350] - and under -treatment of pain can be avoided with this 
strategy.  (Prakash et al, 2004; Kinsella et al, 1988) However, there have been no 
previous investigations of providing patients with the opportunity to self -manage the 
significant anxiety experienced prior to and during burn- care treatments and dressing 
changes.  One medication that might be ideal for anxiety self -management is 
dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine (Precedex®)  is an α 2-agonist FDA -approved 
for surgical sedation or procedures. Chlan and colleagues have previously 
demonstrated the benefits of patient controlled sedation with dexmedetomidine for 
mechanically ventilated patients’ anxiety self -management. (Chlan  et al, 2010)  
There is, however, limited examination in of dexmedetomidine the burn population, 
and there is not known if patient controlled administration of dexmedetomidine is 
beneficial for burn patients to se lf-manage their anxiety during painful and 
distressful burn care treatments. 
 
1.2 Investigational Agents  
Dexmedetomidine ( Precedex®) is a selective alpha- [ADDRESS_534753], and has minimal effects 
on cognitive function.  Subjects receiving dexmedetomidine for sedation can be easily awakened without stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_51119].  Precedex® was originally approved in 1999 (NDA 021038) for sedation of initially i ntubated and mechanically 
ventilated patients during treatment in an intensive care setting, not to exceed 24 
hours; the indication for sedation of non- intubated patients prior to and/or during 
surgical and other procedures was approved later in 2008. 
 
The Alaris® PCA Module with Guardrails® Suite MX Software is an 
electromechanical infusion pump that uses a stepper motor that exerts pressure on an 
inserted syringe  to control the infusion into a patient.  The PCA module is connected 
to the Alaris®PC unit wh ich  is pole -mounted.  The PCA module  includes an 
attached patient dose request cord  that allows a patient to self -administer medication  
within physician- prescribed, programmed parameters that include delivery mode, 
PCA dose, lockout interval (5- 120 min in 1 min increments) and/or 1 or 4 hour dose 
limits.  The Alaris ®PCA Module with Guardrails® Suite MX Software  is indicated 
for accurate, volumetric, infusion of drugs by [CONTACT_423375] -demanded (PCA) 
intravenous administration.The Alaris ®PCA Module  allows patients to self -
administer drug within clinician programmed limits and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]- defined 
medication limits.   
 
2. Study Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective:  
The primary aim of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_423351]-
controlled anxiolysis with dexmedetomidine (PCA -DEX) during burn care dressings 
for patients with burn injury.  
 Feasibility will be defined by: 
a) Number and proportion of patients who consent to enrollment  
b) Proportion of eligible subjects enrolled prior to first dressing change  
c) Number of days on protocol that patients successfully use the PCA device  
d) Ability of burn nurses to adjust the pump and adhere to the infusion rat es of the 
PCA -DEX protocol.  
 Safety will be assessed by:  
[CONTACT_423376][INVESTIGATOR_423352], bradycardia, or agitation from 
uncontrolled anxiety. Detailed safety monitoring parameters clearly alert the research 
and burn- nurses of the guidelines for contact[CONTACT_423377].  Hemodynamic compromise (e.g., bradycardia, hypotension), 
unresolved agitation or inabili ty of any study patient to safely participate in the PCA -
DEX protocol are specified reasons the physician safety monitor can stop the 
protocol and/or remove any subject from the study.  The number of patients who 
develop any of these adverse effects and/ or who require removal from the protocol will be reported.  
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives:  
Secondary objectives for the study include:  
a) Patient Acceptability : Patients will evaluate PCA -DEX in regards to their 
willingness to use PCS -DEX prior to and during burn dressing changes to self -
manage anxiety and their satisfaction ratings with anxiety self -management.  
b) Nurse Acceptability : The nursing staffs’ acceptability of the PCA -DEX protocol 
for patients’ to self -manage anxiety surrounding burn care dressing changes will 
also be evaluated.  
 3. Study Design  
3.[ADDRESS_534754] the pump and adhere to the infusion rates of the 
PCA -DEX protocol.  
 
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints to be analyzed in this study include evaluation patient and 
nursing acceptability of the PCA -DEX protocol.   
 
3.4 Primary Safety Endpoints  
Potential adverse events associated with PCA -DEX will be monitored 1 hour before 
through 1 hour after each dressing change. The primary safety endpoints to be measured include the following:  
a) Proportion of subjects adverse effect s (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, 
diastolic < 50 mmHg, heart rate < 50 beats/min or respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] <10 
breaths/minute) and require protocol suspension or eventual removal for safety 
reasons from the study for these reasons prior to day 5. 
b) Proporti on of days with protocol violations related to the drug, pump, or both.

1. Subject completes protocol  
2. Subject voluntarily withdraws from the study  
3. Subject death  
4. Subject experiences a serious persistent adverse event such as unexplained  
rash or sustained adverse effect such as systolic blood pressure  < 90 mmHg,

breaths/minute.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_534758] Recruitment and Screening  
Subjects will be recruited from the Burn Center within The Ohio State University 
Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). OSUWM C is the only central Ohio hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423353] a commitment to the management of adult burn patients with a 22 -bed Burn 
Center verified by [CONTACT_423379]. Patients range in age from 16-  
89+ and include injuries from flame, scald, contact, chemical , and electrical 
mechanisms. The Burn Center admits about 300 patients per year with an average length of stay of 6.3 days (range 1 -64).  
 
Informed Consent will be obtained from the patient only. A member of the research team (Coffey, Murphy, Calvitti, Uribe) will review the patient census on the Burn Center each morning with the unit’s charge nurse to determine if there are any patients who meet the study inclusion criteria. All of these individuals are employed 
at the OSUWMC. If any patient on the Burn Center meets the inclusion criteria, the 
responsible member of the research team listed above will then discuss the potentially eligible patient with either [CONTACT_251289] or [CONTACT_69331], who will make the 
final determination about the patient’s eligibility. If  [CONTACT_251289] or [CONTACT_69331] 
determines the patient is study eligible, he/she will then be approached for consent 
and potential enrollment into the study. Given all patients are in -patients on the Burn 
Center, recruitment will take place in the privacy of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423354].   
 
If a patient is willing to hear more information about the study, the responsible 
member of the research team will explain to the patient that a study is being 
conducte d to examine whether a medication administered by [CONTACT_1962]’ themselves to 
manage anxiety during the burn care dressing changes is feasible, safe and acceptable to patients. Patients who decide to participate in the study will self -
administer dexmedetomidin e (Precedex ©), a medication approved by [CONTACT_4469] (FDA) to help manage anxiety during medical procedures. Our study is interested in examining whether patients themselves can and will self -
administer this medication during the burn care dressing changes. Patients will be 
told that the nurses caring for them on the Burn Center will continue to provide pain 
medication per the routine physician orders on the unit. Patients will be told that the decision whether or not to participate in the study will not affect their care on the Burn Center in any way. If the patient is interested in participating in the study, a 
copy of the consent form will be provided to the patient prior to the scheduled burn 
care dressing change. Patients will be as ked to read the consent form, ask any 
questions they may have about the study with the responsible member of the research team. Ample time will be given for any patient to consider study participation prior to the scheduled time for the first dressing change in the 
procedure room on the Burn Center. Given the study inclusion criteria, patients will 
only be approached once for study participation given our aim is to examine PCS -
DEX beginning with the first  burn care dressing change, up to [ADDRESS_534759]. If the patient declines to participate in the study, he/she will be thanked for their time and will not be approached again during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423355].  
 
 
4.[ADDRESS_534760] regimen for burn care dressing changes at the discretion of 
the attending burn surgeon.  Any patient who elects to withdraw from the PCA -DEX 
protocol or is withdrawn prior to completing of the 5 day protocol will be closely 
monitored for an additional 24 hours for any adverse events.  All data will be 
considered for analysis regardless of length of time on protocol.  
 
5. Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
Dexmedetomidine ( Precedex®) is a selective alpha- [ADDRESS_534761], and has minimal effects 
on cognitive function.   
 
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
We will utilize a dosing algorithm consisting of a loading dose (0.25 mcg/kg) administer over 10 minutes, initiated 10 minutes prior to the start of burn wound care, followed by a continuous basal infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg/hr with 6 allowable 
patient -controlled self -boluses per hour (0.1 mcg/kg) each with a 10- minute lock -out.  
The Lifecare PCA® Infusion System is the infusion pump used at OSUWMC for patient controll ed analgesia.  The pump will be utilized in the PCA + continuous 
mode.  Flow rates based on a 30 mL syringe range from 0.1- 650 ml/hr (0.1 -9.99 
ml/hr in 0.1 ml/hr increments, 10- 99.9 ml/hr in 0.1 ml increments and 100- 650 ml/hr 
in 1 ml increments. Delivery accuracy is ± 2% of full scale plunger travel not including syringe variation.  Settings, dose delivery times and aggregate dosing are 
recorded by [CONTACT_423380].  
 
5.3 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  
Dexmedetomidine will be store d, prepared and dispensed from the Investigational 
Drug Service (IDS# M -1429) within OSUWMC.  When study drug is requested for a 
subject, IDS will coordinate the preparation and dispensing of dexmedetomidine 
using a supply designated for this study.  Requi red paper work will be completed.   
 
 For patients weighing up to [ADDRESS_534762] aseptic technique, 200 µg/2 ml will be added to 28 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride; this will yield a concentration of 200 
µg/30 ml (or 6.7 µg/ml).  Dexmedetomidine will be delivered via a pharmacy-
prepared 30 ml  syringe for use with the Alaris ®PCA Module  as described above.  
Preparation date and time will be recorded.   
 
For patients weighing more than [ADDRESS_534763] aseptic technique, 400 µg/4 ml 
will be added to 26 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride; this will yield a concentration of 400 µg/30 ml  (or 13.3 µg/ml).  Dexmedetomidine will be delivered via a pharmacy -
prepared bar -coded syringe manufactured for use with the Alaris ®PCA Module  as 
described above.  Preparation date and time will be recorded.   
 
All dexmedetomidine preparation will be performed in accordance with USP 797 
standards.  
 
  
5.4 Receipt of Drug Supplies  
Upon receipt of the of the study treatment supplies, an inventory will be performed and a drug receipt log filled out and signed by [CONTACT_423381].  The designated study staff will count and verify that the shipment contains all the items noted in the shipment inventory.  Any damaged or unusable 
study drug in a given shipment will be documented in the study files.   
 
5.5 Storage  
Dexmedetomidine will be c ontrolled by [CONTACT_21212], a secure 
pharmacy service at OSUWMC.  The study drug will be stored in a secure, limited 
access location separate from commercial drug supplies. The investigational dexmedetomidine supply will be stored at a c ontrolled room temperature not 
exceeding 25 °C (77 °F) with excursions allowed between 15 to 30 °C (59 to 86 °F).  
The study drug is not light sensitive and requires no additional special storage 
conditions.  Each dose will be signed out of the IDS log wit h the lot number of each 
200 µg/[ADDRESS_534764] ID 
number  to whom drug dispensed, running inventory and disposition of expi[INVESTIGATOR_423356].  Accountability will be accomplished by [CONTACT_423382]/or an electronic accountability system.  
 
 
6. Study Procedures  
Dexmedetomidine PCA Protocol:   The PCA -DEX dosing algorithm will consist of a 
loading dose (0.25 mcg/kg) given intravenously over 10 minutes, administered 10 minutes 
prior to the start of burn wound care, followed by a continuous basal infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg/hr with 6 allowable patien t-controlled self -boluses per hour (0.1 mcg/kg) each with 
a 10-minute lock -out.  Drs. Larry Jones and J. Kevin Bailey or their designate will write 
the PCA -DEX medication orders.  Subjects will receive standard opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538] (oral 
oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg 60 min. prior and IV morphine 4 -12 mg or 
hydromorphone IV 0.5 -1.5 mg 5 to 10 min. prior and buccal fentanyl 400 mcg as needed 
during burn wound care) and can receive bolus supplemental sedative medications 
(benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) as ordered by [CONTACT_6283]. Jone s or Bailey if needed in the judgment of the 
burn- care nurse.  Subjects will be monitored closely by [CONTACT_423383] [ADDRESS_534765] the attending physician and then to the safety monitor.  
 
Nurse alert parameters to notify the attending physician and independent safety monitor 
include:  heart rate (HR) < 55 beats per min sustained for > 10 min; systolic BP < 90 mm 
Hg or >140 mm Hg sustained for >10 minutes; diastolic BP < 50 mm Hg or >90 mm H g 
sustained for >10 minutes, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] < 10 breaths per minute sustained for >10 
minutes or oxygen saturation <92% sustained for >10 minutes ; or persistent inability to 
understand rationale for triggering the PCA device despi[INVESTIGATOR_423357]. 
 If the study subject has evidence of sustained hemodynamic instability (HR<60 bpm, SBP <90 mmHg or DBP < 50 mmHg) during the daily pre -procedure assessment, the patient 
will not be eligible to receive study drug on that day.  For that day the pati ent will receive 
standard of care as appropriate instead of the study intervention. The patient will then be reassessed prior to the subsequent study days to determine eligibility for study drug up through day 5.  
 
Data Collection Measures and Procedures  
Study entry demographic and descriptive data :  Data to be recorded includes:  age, 
gender, race, ethnicity, admission weight, severity of burn injury, burn etiology, total body surface area burned and depth of injury, and all home and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_219305].  
 
Daily Measures on Protocol . The following will be obtained from enrolled patients each 
day by a member of the research team.  
 
Overall anxiety and pain . The abbreviated Burn Specific Anxiety and Pain Scale 
(BSAPS) on day 1, [ADDRESS_534766] burn dressing change. (Taal et al, 
1999)  
 Procedural Anxiety . Anxiety, defined as a state marked by [CONTACT_423384], agitation, 
increased motor activity, arousal, and fearful withdrawal will be obtained from subjects .  (McCartney et al, 1994)  Patients will evaluate current anxiety level 1 
hour before and 1 hour after each burn dressing cha nge using a 100- mm Visual 
Analogue scale- anxiety (VAS -A). (McCartney et al, 1994; Hornblow et al, 1976)   
Subjects will be asked to rate their current level of anxiety on the VAS -A in 
response to, “H ow anxious are you feeling today? ”  A 100- millimeter verti cal line 
will be anchored on each end by [CONTACT_423385] ‘ not anxious at all’ to ‘the most anxious 
I have ever been’ .  The VAS -A will have a vertical orientation, as it is more sensitive 
and easier for subjects to use, particularly for those with a narrowed vis ual field or 
when under stress.  (Cline et al, 1992; Gift, 1989) Subjects will be asked to mark 
their current anxiety level on the vertical line. Scores will be derived by [CONTACT_423386], yielding 
interval level data.  (Bergbom -Engberg et al, 1989; Knebel et al 1994)     Reason(s) 
for not obtaining a daily anxiety assessment will be recorded.  The proportion of those assessments completed and reasons for non- completion will be used to infor m 
strategies to minimize missing data for our planned randomized clinical trial.  
 Procedural Pain .  Patients’ will evaluate current pain level 1 hour before and 1 hour 
after each burn dressing change using a 100- mm Visual Analogue Scale -Pain. 
(McCartney et  al, 1994)  Patients will be asked to rate their current level of pain on 
the VAS -P in response to “How much pain are you having right now?” A 100-
millimeter vertical line will be anchored on each end by [CONTACT_423387] ‘no pain at all’ 
to ‘the most pain I ha ve ever experienced’. As with the VAS -A, the vertical 
orientation has been chosen due to increased sensitivity and ease of use for patients. (Cline et al, 1992; Gift, 1989) Subjects will be asked to mark their current pain level on the vertical line. Scores will be derived by [CONTACT_423388], yielding interval level data. 
(Bergbom -Engberg et al, 1989; Knebel et al 1994)   Reason(s) for not obtaining the 
pain assessments will be recorded.  T he proportion of those assessments completed 
and reasons for non- completion will be used to inform strategies to minimize 
missing data for our planned randomized clinical trial. 
 
Protocol adherence.  A checklist will be completed daily to monitor the numbe r of 
days subjects are able to use the PCA device for up to [ADDRESS_534767] and report the presence 
of hypotension, bradycardia (known adverse effects of dexmedetomidine), and 
protocol deviations related to drug, pump or both. Heart rate and blood pressure will be abstracted from the medical record.  R esearch team staff or burn -nurses caring for 
PCA -DEX subjects will alert the attending physician and the safety monitor for HR 
< 55 bpm sustained for > 10 min; systolic BP < 90 mm Hg or >140 mm Hg sustained for >10 minutes; diastolic BP < 50 mm Hg or >90 m m Hg sustained for >10 minutes, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] < 10 breaths per minute sustained for >10 minutes or oxygen saturation <92% sustained for >[ADDRESS_534768] deviations. Repeated measurements over time will be summarized at each relevant time point.  
 
8. Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries 
will be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of di agnostic procedures are 
considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_398395] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is 
any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event 
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but 
are clearly of major clinical significance.   They m ay jeopardize the subject, and may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For 
example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in- patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5108].  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study 
treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study treatment follow -up is defined as [ADDRESS_534769] administration of study treatment.   
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition will be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality will be r ecorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant 
findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event will also be 
recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise 
explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator will instruct each subject to report any s ubsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, 
believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any 
one of the following conditions is met:  
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the 
abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity 
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management;  e.g. change of 
dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423358] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed 
otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be 
documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse 
event.  
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are 
reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5110] a preexis ting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an

events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on 
all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in 
the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly 
related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results will be recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis. 
 

All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical 
course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious 
adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the st udy period must be followed 
up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_534771] be reported to the study sponsor by [CONTACT_155417] 24 hours of finding out of the event.  A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)

8.6 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_423364].  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and 
appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction 
and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 9 Auditing, 
Monitoring and Inspecting).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_534774] of a minimum of 4 individuals, including a physician/surgeon, pharmacist, nurse -researcher, and stati stician.  All members will 
be independent of the study protocol and research team.   We will constitute an independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee  for this 
study. Members include the following:

 Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  
At predetermined intervals during the course of the trial, the DSMC responsibilities are the following:  
 
1.  Review the clinical protocol, informed consent documents and plans for data and 
safety monitoring;  
2.  Evaluate the progress of the study, including periodic assessments of data quality 
and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, and other factors that can affect study outcome;  
3.  Consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes 
available, such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the study;  
4.  Review, make recommendations and assist in the resolution of problems reported 
by [CONTACT_978];  
5.  Protect the safety of the study participants:  
6.  Report on the safety and progress of the study;  
7.  Make recommendations to the PI, FDA, and/or the IRB concerning continuation, 
termination or other modifications of the study based on the observed beneficial or 
adverse effects of PCS -DEX;  
8.  Ensure the confidentiality of the study data and the results of monitoring;  
9.  Assist the PI [INVESTIGATOR_216858], enrollment, 
sample size, and/or data collection.  
 
The DSMC will be comprised of one independent OSUMC physician, College of 
Nursing faculty, and SICU PharmD.  Each will have one vote.  One will be named Chair of the Committee ([CONTACT_21147]).  The PI, IND holder ([CONTACT_251289]), and members 
of the research team from The Ohio State University will be ex officio non- voting 
member.  The Chair of the committee is responsible for documenting decisions to continue and is responsible for issuing meeting minutes.   For this study, 20 subjects will be enrolled.  The DSMC will review the outcomes 
including the safety data after each group of 5 subjects.  The DSMC will review 
safety data collected in each group at a quarterly Safety Review Meetings (S RM).  
At each meeting, the DSMC members will discuss the safety data. These discussions will include, but are not limited to, details of any adverse events of clinical relevance 
that raise concern about next cohort, any clinically significant changes in subject 
vital signs. The DSMC will decide if the study will continue. The decision will be based on consideration of the clinical significance of all relevant endpoints. 
Authorization to proceed will be obtained in a document signed and dated by [CONTACT_423392].  If the safety profile is 
unacceptable, no new subjects will be enrolled.  In this case, the DSMC Chair will document the scientific rationale for the decision based on the safety data and recommendations of the  DSMC. The Investigators will review the documentation 
and provide written agreement not to proceed with the trial.  If there are no safety 
concerns after each review, the study may proceed.  The decision to proceed must be 
by [CONTACT_423393].  Process of safety monitoring  
Meetings of the SRC will take place after quarterly or after each group of [ADDRESS_534775] of data collected from Sc reening until Day 
5 inclusive. The following data will be presented:    Adverse Events  
 Vital signs  
 
Safety data (adverse events and vital signs data) will be provided to DSMC members by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_423367].  
 If any SAE(s) occurred in the group under review, the SAE forms and narrative summaries will be presented as well; the SAE documentation will be provided by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_423368].  All voting members of the DSMC  
must be present at the meeting. A negative vote on going forward by [CONTACT_423394].   
The Chair of the DSMC  will prepare meeting minutes summarizing the discus sion 
and detail the outcome of the vote pertaining to the continuation of the study. The 
minutes will specify the decision of each individual member of the DSMC  and the 
overall decision of the DSMC . A copy of the minutes will be distributed to all 
members of the DSMC  within one working day of the meeting.  
 Immediately following the DSMC  meeting ( i.e., within one day of  the meeting) the 
Chair  will send the report  to the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_423369], as  appropriat e. At the end of the study all DSMC  
documents will be forwarded to the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_423370] . 
 
All SAEs will be reported immediately (within 24 hours of their occurrence). This can be done by [CONTACT_29658] a completed SAE Fax Cover Sheet and SAE CRF  and by 
[CONTACT_423395], IRB, or FDA.  A completed SAE Fax Cover Sheet and SAE CRF will follow all telephone reports within [ADDRESS_534776], will 
be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor (CCTS) or their representative. A 
completed SAE Fax Cover Sheet and SAE CRF will follow all telephone reports within [ADDRESS_534777] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject  of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this 
study 
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorizat ion for use of their 
PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the 
investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization 
to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least 
vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period. 
 
9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents  Examples of these original documents , and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_423371], microfiches, 
photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x- rays, subject files, and 
records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical 
departments involved in the clinical trial.  
 
Data generated by [CONTACT_17254]' medical records and/or study progress notes.  Data may be transcribed 
legibly on CRFs supplied for each subject or directly inputted into an electronic 
system or  any combination thereof.  
 
9.3 Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the 
individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If 
any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line 
through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For 
clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarif ication above the item, 
then initial and date it.

(CCTS) Study Monitoring Service in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedures 
(Appendix 5- B).  The investigator will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities 
which are to promote study participant safety, regulatory and protocol compliance, and data integrity. The extent of these a ctivities will be commensurate with the level of risk and 
complexity that the study poses. In order for these activities to occur, the Investigator will 
also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given 
access to all t he above noted study- related documents and study related facilities (e.g. 
pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.), and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.  
 
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, a udits, and inspections by [CONTACT_5040], the sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and 
quality assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study- related facilities (e.g. 
pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_423397].

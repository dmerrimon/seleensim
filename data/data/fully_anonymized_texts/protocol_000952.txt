European Union  
OVERALL RATIONALE FOR THE AMENDMENT  
The primary reasons for this amendment to Proto col BIVV009 -03 (Cardinal) are to extend Part B 
duration from [ADDRESS_920300] Patient Out from Part A, to provide home infusion facilities 
to the patients (for  US, the Netherlands, Norway, [LOCATION_009], Italy, Austria, [LOCATION_013], and Spain 
specific amendmen ts), to add new exploratory objective of immunogenicity, to introduce 
additional time points when samples for ADAs against BIVV009 are collected, to specify that left 
over PD samples will be used to assess immunogenicity in patients who consented to future  use of 
samples, to introduce additional time points for SLE panel in Part B, and to introduce a correction 
in Section  10.1 Appendix A.

Bioverativ [LOCATION_003] Inc.  Confidential  METHODOLOGY/STUDY 
DESIGN:  This open -label , single -arm study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability 
of BIVV009  in patients with the complement -mediated disorder primary CAgD  who have  a 
recent history of transfusion .  
During the 6 -week Screening/ Observation Period, prospective patients will have a detailed 
medical history documented  (including transfusion history o f ≥6 months) , physical 
evaluations for screening , and blood samples collected for characterization of CAgD 
biomarkers, including Hgb levels on 3 occasions approximately every 2  weeks.  
Patients may receive a transfusion(s) during the Screening/ Observation Period prior to the 
first study drug infusion if medically indicated per the Investigator’s discretion.  However, the 
baseline visit (and  first infusion of st udy drug) must occur at least [ADDRESS_920322] 6 months prior to enrollment . 
Eligible patients will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of BIVV009  over approximately 
60 minutes on Day  0, Day  7, and every 14 days thereafter through Week  25 (ie, Days  21, 
35, 49, 63, 77, 91, 105, 119, 133, 147, 161, and 175).  Patients who miss a dose (ie, outside 
the dosing window  or >[ADDRESS_920323] dose ) should return to the site for an unscheduled 
visit [ADDRESS_920324] an End -of-Treatment (EOT) visit in Part  A on Day  182 (Week  26). 
Patients who meet the transfusion criteria in Table 1 during the 6 -month treatment period 
will receive a transfusion.  Patients who re ceive a transfusion during Part  A will not be 
withdrawn from the study and will be eligible to participate in Part B.  
Table  1: Transfusion criteria  
A patient will rec eive a transfusion during Part A  or Part B if his or her Hgb level meets 
either of the following criteria:  
 Hgb is <9 g/dL and the patient is symptomatic, or 
 Hgb is <7 g/dL and the patient is asymptomatic  
A responder analysis will be conducted following completion of  the EOT visit at Week  26. 
The responder definition is provided in Table  2.  
Table  2: Responder definition  
A patient will be considered a responder  in Part A  if he or she did not receive a blood 
transfusion from Week 5 through Week  26 (EOT) and did not receive treatment for CAgD 
beyond what is permitted per protocol.  Additionally, the patient’s Hgb level must meet 
either of the following criteria:  
 Hgb level is ≥12 g/dL at treatment assessment endpoint (defined as mean 
value from Weeks  23, 25,  and 26), or 
 Hgb increased ≥2 g/dL from baseline (defined as the last Hgb value before 
administration of the first dose of study drug) at treatment assessment endpoint  
Note: A ny patient withdrawing from the study after Week [ADDRESS_920325] of excluded concomitant medications, as well as allowed concomitant medications with 
restrictions, is provided in the protocol.  Beyond the permitted concomitant medications, 
study drug, and transfusions, patient s may receive no other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_680165]; patients requiring other treatment for their CAgD in Part A 
will be withdrawn from the study and counted as non -responders.  These patients will not be 
eligible to part icipate in Part  B.

Bioverativ [LOCATION_003] Inc.  Confidential   Part B  
Following completion of dosing in the 6 -month treatment period, patients will continue to 
receive BIVV009  dosing during Part B, the long -term safety and durability of response 
extension phase.  Part B will run for 2 years following LPO under Part  A. Patients requiring 
treatment with permitted concomitant medications and/or transfusions will not be 
discontinued from the study.  Patients in Part B will be transfused per the Transfusion 
Criteria in Table  1. Patients who receive a transfusion during  Part B will no t be withdrawn 
from the study.  
Patients will be dosed with BIVV009 every 2 weeks, as in Part A.  Should patients deviate 
from their sch eduled dosing a repeat loading dose may be required.  On-site visits will be 
completed ~  every 3 months (at a minimum)  for collection of pharmacodynamic (PD)  and 
pharmacokinetic  (PK) samples , ADA samples  during the 1st year of treatment in Part B, then 
every 6 months  and for additional safety and efficacy measures.  PK, PD and antidrug 
antibodies (ADA) samples will be collected [ADDRESS_920326] dose of 
study drug in patients who discontinue early , as well as in  patients who experience a 
hematological breakthrough event.

experiences a hematologic breakthrough or withdraws from the study.  
SAMPLE SIZE:  If the true responder rate is estimated to be 66% and a minimum of 30% is required for 
success, then with 20 patients there is 90% probability that the lower limit of  the 
95% confidence interval ( CI) will be at least  30%.  The minimal observed rate for a 
successful efficacy claim is 11/20  = 55%.  
STATISTICAL 
METHODS:  Interim analysis:  
For the purpose of regulatory submission, an interim analysis of safety and efficacy data will 
be performed after all patients have completed Part A.  
Analyses:  
For Part A, the analysis of the primary endpoint, the proportion of responders will be 
calculated together with a 95% exact Clopper -Pearson CI.  The main an alysis will be 
conducted on the Full Analysis Set (FAS): FAS population, consisting of all patients who 
received at least one dose of study drug.  
Under the assumption that a response rate of less than or equal to 30% is not clinically 
relevant, the success criteria for the primary  endpoint will be that the 95% lower bound CI 
for response rate excludes 30% using the exact Clopper -Pearson method.  That is, this 
criterion is equivalent to demonstrating at the 2 -sided 0.05 level of significance that the  true 
response rate is  >30%.  
All secondary endpoints will be analyzed using descriptive statistics, frequency, percentage, 
and CIs as appropriate.  Change from baseline for continuous parameters will be analyzed 
using a one -sample t -test.

Bioverativ [LOCATION_003] Inc.  Confidential  2 INTRODUCTION1  
2.1 PHARMACOLOGY O F BIVV009   
BIVV009  is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against human complement factor 
C1s, which along with C1r and C1 q is a part of the C1 complex that sits at the apex of the 
complement classical pathway ( CP). By [CONTACT_42326] C1s , BIVV009  prevents the enzymatic action of 
the C1 complex on its substrates, complement factors C4 and C2, and thereby [CONTACT_680177] C3 convertase.  Note that this site of action of BIVV009  lies above the level of C3 , which is 
the junction of all three pathways of complement acti vation.  This is important to the specificity of 
the mechanism of action of BIVV009  because it means that the two other complement pa thways, 
the alternative pathway  and the lectin pathway, remain functionally intact for the purpose of host 
defense in the pr esence of BIVV009 . Note, too, that the non -enzymatic role of C1q is left intact 
by [CONTACT_284530]009 ; this may be particularly relevant because of the importance of the pro -phagocytic 
“housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” functions of the complement system including removal of apoptotic c ells. 
BIVV009  binds with high affinity and specificity to C1s of humans and no n-human primates 
(NHPs).  It has  no affinity fo r the related proteases of the lectin pathway , MASP -1, and MASP -2. 
As discussed above, BIVV009  has disease -relevant inhibitory activity against CP in a variety of 
human in vitro models of human disease (including cold agglutinin disease [CA gD], bullous 
pemphigoid  [BP] , and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia  [WAIHA] ). BIVV009  exerts its 
effect on the CP in a characteristic two -state behavior: complete inhibition at concentrations 
≥20 g/mL, and no inhibition at concentrations <20 g/mL,  with an abrupt transition between the 
two. This behavior means that graded degrees of inhibition are not readily meas urable and that 
increasing BIVV009  concentration to ≥20 g /mL results not in greater degrees of inhibition, but 
only in  longer duration of inhibition ( ie, longer dwell time in the “off” state  of the CP ). In turn, 
this means that the dose -effect relationship is demonstrated in the duration of action, such that 
higher doses lead to longer possible inter -dose intervals while maintaining full pathway inhibition.  
2.2 BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE   
The CP has been implicated in many diseases that are driven by [CONTACT_46917] a pathogenic 
antibody; CA gD is one such example.  Complement inhibition has proven to be a safe and 
effective treatment for another form of hemolytic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.  
Currently, there are approved complement inhibitors being used therapeutically for various 
indications, including Soliris® (eculizumab), a mAb targeting C5; Berinert® and Cinryze®, both 
C1 esterase inhibitors purified f rom human plasma; and Ruconest®, a recombinant form of human 
C1 esterase inhibitor.  Unlike Soliris and the C1 esterase inhibitors, by [CONTACT_680178] C1s, 
BIVV009  inhibits only the CP, leaving the alternative complement pathway and the lectin 
comple ment pathway available for immune surveillance.  Furthermore, by [CONTACT_680179] C1 complex, BIVV009  is expected to prevent generation of all anaphylatoxins and opsonins 
(eg, C3 fragments) that produce pathologic lesions in CP -mediated disorder s.

2.2.1  Non-clinical experience   
The non -clinical safety foundation for this study includes a completed 6 -month toxicology study 
in which NHPs were treated with weekly  doses of BIVV009  as high as 180  mg/kg for [ADDRESS_920338] demonstrated no toxicologically adverse findings 
related to BIVV009  in cynomolgus monkey stud ies of up to 6 -months treatment duration; 
furthermore, no adverse effects fro m exaggerated pharmacology (ie , autoimmune diseases, 
bacterial infections) were observed in those studies.  As a result, the no observed adverse effect 
(dose) level (NOAEL ) established for BIVV009  is 180  mg/kg by [CONTACT_612845] ( IV) 
administration for 26  weeks; this translates to a sa fety margin that more than adequately covers 
the BIVV009  dose regimen for use in Study BIVV009 -03. Hence the NOAEL in cynomolgus 
monkeys is more than twice the intended fixed doses of 6.5 gram s or 7.5  grams, based on an adult  
weighing ~[ADDRESS_920339] In Human (FIH) Phase  1a/1b study  (BIVV009 -01). 
Phase  1a included Part A, a  single -ascending dose  study in normal healthy volunteers ( NHV ), and 
Part B, a multiple -ascending dose study in NHVs . Phase 1b included Part C, a multi -dose study in 
patients with complement -mediated disorders including  CAgD, WAIHA, BP, and antibody -
mediated rejection ( AMR ) in kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] , and Part E , which was added to both 
allow continued access to study drug in a subset of study patients with CAgD, and to further 
characterize the safety and efficacy to BIVV009 . Part D was not implemented.  
Part A was conducted according to an ascending dose cohort paradigm in which a unique cohort 
of NHVs was treated at each single dose level.  There were [ADDRESS_920340] 2 cohorts

Bioverativ [LOCATION_003] Inc.  Confidential  Part B was conducted accor ding to an ascending dose cohort paradigm in which a unique cohort 
of NHVs was treated at each dose level.  There were 2 cohorts of NHVs, each consisting of 
8 healthy volunteers , in this part of the study.  These cohorts wer e given 4  weekly IV doses of 
BIVV 009 or placebo (6:2 for active:  placebo) at a dose level previously administered to NHVs in 
Part A of the study (30 or 60  mg/kg).  
Part C was conducted in a single cohort of patients enrolled in 4 strata, representing 
4 complement -mediated disorders (CAgD, W AIHA, BP, and AMR) . Patients in Part  C received a 
single IV test dose of 10  mg/kg followed by 4 weekly  doses of 60 mg/kg.  
Clinical proof of concept f or BIVV009  was achieved in Phase  1b based upon the demonstration of  
immediate cessation of hemolysis and ra pid correction of anemia during short -term treatment of 
patients with CAgD. These results confirm that continuous C1s inhibition is sufficient  to observe 
a treatment effect , while the observation of relapse of hemolytic anemia upon washout of 
BIVV009  and restoration of C1s activity confirms that continuous C1s inhibition is necessary for 
treatment of CA gD. 
The clinical safety profile of single - or multiple -dose administration of BIVV009  to healthy 
volunteers was similar to placebo with respect to type , frequency, or severity of adverse events 
(AEs) and there have been no clinically meaningful AEs seen in healthy volunteers exposed to 
BIVV009  at doses up to 60  mg/kg weekly for [ADDRESS_920341] 
to the hypothetical, mechanism -related  risks from C1s inhibition (ie , autoimmune diseases , 
bacterial infections), prophylactic vaccination against encapsulated bacterial pathogens per 
regional guidelines and routine surveillance with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) serologic 
testing are available to mitigate these risks.  
A second prospectiv e, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study of multi -dose 
BIVV 009 in healthy volunteers was recently completed under Protocol TNT009 -02. A single 
cohort of 24 NHVs  was randomized to BIVV009 (75 mg/kg) or placebo at a ratio of 3:1. 
Volunteers were  dosed on Days 1, 8, 22, and 36.  Intensive pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/pharmacodynamic  (PD)/exploratory complement sampling was performed during the study.  
This study added  an additional dose level , which was combined with data from the BIVV009 -01 
study  to augment PK modeling and simulations.  The results of this study, in conjunctio n with 
existing PK data, was  used to propose dose regimens for the current protocol . 
2.2.3  Pharmacokinetic experience and dose justification   
The PK/PD profile of BIVV009  in healthy volunteers and in patients has been established based 
on the data collected from the first -in-human clinical trial.  A human PK model was constructed 
from the complete and final P hase 1a data.  This model was then augmented with the available PK 
data emerging from the Phase 1b component of this trial, and the combined model was used to 
simulate a variety of possible dose regimens for use in patients.  The dose regimen pro posed for 
use in current and future clinical trials with BIVV009, including Study BIVV009 -03, differs from 
that used in the Phase  1a and 1b program because weekly IV administration was deemed to be 
logistically challenging for patients when the period of treatment is increased from weeks to

Days 7, 21, 35, 49, etc. can provide continuous, complete C1s inhibition while better 
accommodating to the needs of patients.  Human PK mode ling suggests that a dose level of 
6.5 grams  or 7.5 grams (based on body weight of <75 kg or ≥75 kg, respectively)  is necessary to 
protect patients better from potential restoration of CP activity at the end of the inter -dose interval.  
The weight cut -off o f [ADDRESS_920342] relationship that it behaves as a switch -like inhibitor of C1s: at 
concentrations of BIVV009  ≥20 µg/mL, CP activity is virtually undetectable; at BIVV009  
concentrations below this threshold the CP is fully active.  This property results in the  requirement 
to maintain a blood concentration of BIVV009  that is always at least ≥20 µg/mL, even at trough, 
lest CP activity be fully restored.

(Soliris), an inhibitor of the terminal p ortion of the complement system.  However, to provide 
optimal protection against infections with encapsulated bacteria, the design of this study includes 
an appropriate program of prophylactic vaccinations.  
The risks associated with long -term inhibition of the proximal portion of the CP are presently 
unknown.  Theoretically , it could increase the risk of SLE or  circulating immune complexes  (CIC) 
disease due to the role of the C1 complex in immune complex clearance, as observed  in patients 
with congenital deficiencies of C1 complex components (C1q,  C1s, and C1r).  However, 
pharmacologic inhibition of  C1s differs from  congenital deficienc y of the C1 complex because: 
1) congenital C1 complex component deficiency are commonly not single gene mutations but 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_612818]; 2)  pharmacologic 
inhibi tion of C1s enzymatic function in the C1 complex leaves intact the non -enzymatic function 
of C1q, which is important for the opsonization and phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells which 
protects against autoimmunity; and 3) the phenotype associated with li fe-long, often total absence 
of C1 complex structure and function is unlikely to be reproduced by  [CONTACT_680180] C1 enzymatic function in fully developed adults.  Nevertheless, standard clinical  biomarkers 
related to SLE (eg , antibodies to doub le-stranded DNA  [dsDNA ]) have been incorporated into the 
study design as safety surveillance measures.

4.2 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN   
The route of administration, dose, and dosing interval for BIVV009  planned for use in this study 
are based on the initial Phase 1a/1b clinical expe rience ( BIVV009 -01) and corresponding 
non-clinical  data for safety, PK, and PD observations.  BIVV009  has thus far been administered to 
healthy human volunteers and patients with complement -mediated disease entities including 
CAgD, bullous pemphigoid, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia , and AMR . 
Under the current protocol , enrolled patients will receive  fixed dose s of BIVV009 via IV infusion 
of either  6.5 grams (if <75 kg) or 7.5 gram s (if ≥75 kg), based on the ir baseline body weight.  
The repeated dose regimen  is predicted to provide continuous C1s inhibition throughout the 
dosing  interval, with an adequate  safety margin based on comparative drug exposures in NHPs  
(Section  2.2.1 ) and in healthy volunteers given a single dose of 100 mg/kg in Phase  1a 
(Section  2.2.2 ).  
Safety, tolerability, PK, an d PD and immunogenicity assessments  will be evaluated at the time  
points indicated in the study schedule of events  (Table  3). In patients having consented to the use 
of their blood samples for future research, ADA may be tested using available predose PD 
back -up samples.

Not applicable; this is an open -label study.  
6.2.6  Concomitant  medications   
Patients  will refrain from participation in any other investigational study drug trial in which 
receipt of any investigational drug occurred within 5 half -lives or 30  days, whichever is 
longer, prior to Day 0 and during the entire study.  
Treatment with rituximab monotherapy or rituximab combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, with 
bendamustine, fludarabine, ibrutinib, or cytotoxic drugs) is prohibited.  
During Part A , patients will not take any prescription or over -the-counter 
medications/products until completion of the follow -up assessments, unless prescribed by [CONTACT_680186].  
As noted in  Secti on 5.2, concurrent administration of erythropoietin and/or a daily dose of 
corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤10 mg/day of prednisone) is acceptable provided the patien t 
has been on a stable dose during  the previous  3 month s; concurrent use of vitamin B12, folate 
and iron supplementation  is acceptable provided the patient has been on a stable dose during 
the previous  4 weeks.  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_612823], and non -prescription 
medications for treatment of minor intercurrent illnesses (headache, viral upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_54582] , etc.) are permitted at the discretion of the PI. Hormonal contraception in 
female patients is all owed provided patients are receiving stable treatment ≥3 months prior to

who are of non -childbearing potential will not be required to use contraception.  
VV-CLIN-[ADDRESS_920382] be established on ( ≥3 months prior to 
Screening) and agree to continue to use the same highly eff ective methods of birth control 
(ie, contraceptive measure with a failure rate of <1% per year) in conjunction with male 
barrier contraception (ie , male condom wi th spermicide)  throughout the study and for 
[ADDRESS_920383] dose of study drug . Highly effective methods of 
contraception include:  
 Intrauterine device (IUD; Mirena®) 
 Established use of oral, implanted, transdermal, or hormonal method of contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation  
 Bilateral tubal ligation  
 Permanent birth control via the Essure procedure  
Male patients will be surgically sterile for at least 90 days or when sexually active with 
female partners of childbea ring potential will be required to use a male condom with 
spermicide  (if locally approved for use)  throughout the study and for [ADDRESS_920384] 
dose of study drug . 
Patients  who practice true abstinence because of the patient’s  lifestyle choice (ie, the patient 
should not become abstinent just for the purpose of study participation) are exempt from 
contraceptive requirements.  Periodic abstinence ( eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
postovulation methods) and withdrawal are n ot acceptable methods of contraception.  If a 
patient who is abstinent at the time of signing the ICF becomes sexually active , they must 
agree to use contraception as described above.  
For male patients , sexual intercourse with female partners who are pregn ant or breastfeeding 
should be avoided unless condoms are used from the time of administration of the first dose 
until [ADDRESS_920385] care.  Screening assessments should occur within 6 weeks  
prior to administrat ion of the study treatment ( ie, on Days -42 to -1). The immunization status 
should be confirmed at least 14  days prior  to the planned administr ation of study drug (ie, on

Bioverativ [LOCATION_003] Inc.  Confidential  6.7.1  Definition of adverse events   
An AE is defined in the International Council for  Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) as “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  or clinical 
investigation  subject  administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship  with this treatment” (ICH E6: S ection 1.2).  An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory find ing, for 
example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not considered related  to the medicinal (investigational) 
product . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of adverse drug reactions   
Adverse drug reactions are defined as a ll noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal 
product related to any dose administered.  The phrase “responses to a medicinal product”  
means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at leas t a 
reasonable possibility ( ie, the r elationship cannot be ruled out ). 
The following categories for determining the causal relationship to the investigational medicinal 
produ ct are to be used:  
Probable (must have first three):  
 It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug.  
 It cannot be reasonabl y explained by [CONTACT_191682] n characteristics of the patient’s clinical 
state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the 
patient . 
 It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose.  
 It follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug.  
 It reappears upon re -challeng e. 
Possible (must have first two):  
 It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug.  
 It may readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, environmental or 
toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient . 
 It does not reappear or worsen when the drug is re -administered.  
Unrelated:  
An AE will be considered “Unrelated” to the use of the investigational drug if there is not a 
reasonable possibility that the event has been caused by [CONTACT_77425] u nder investigation and 
does not meet the criteria for drug relationship listed under possible or probable.  Factors 
pointing toward this assessment include, but are not limited to , the lack of reasonable 
temporal relationship between administration of the d rug and the event, the presence of a 
biologically implausible relationship between the product and the AE (eg, the event occurred 
before administration of drug), or the presence of a more likely alternative explanation for the 
AE.

Bioverativ [LOCATION_003] Inc.  Confidential  In case of missing causa lity assessment in the eCRF or SAE reporting form, the event will be 
regarded as possibly related unless further specified.  Any SAE recorded as probably or 
possibly related will be categorized as “related” for regulatory reporting purposes.  
A serious drug  reaction is an adverse drug reaction that meets the definition of a serious even t 
(provided below).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of serious adverse events   
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence (AE) that at any dose:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening ( patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event)  
 Requires i npatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158979]  
 Results in  persistent or si gnifi cant disability/incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Any other significant medical condition  
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37349] “serious” is any inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517].  Any AE that does not meet one of the definitions  of serious ( ie, important medical 
events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_680171] e of the o ther outcomes 
listed above [eg, emergency room v isit, outpatient surgery, or requires urgent investigation ]) 
may be considered by [CONTACT_139666] “other significant medical condition”  
criterion for classification as an SAE.  Examples include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, 
and blood dysc rasias.  
If a subject develops a  Grade 3 or higher  allergic reaction per Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) grading or an anaphyla ctic reaction  (see Section  6.3.8 ) in 
association wit h BIVV009  administration , the event  should  be reported as an SAE.  
Exceptions from SAE reporting:  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_612826] -required procedures or administrati on of study 
treatment is not classified as an SAE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of unexpected adverse event /S[LOCATION_003]R   
An unexpected AE is any adverse drug event , the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the current Investigator ’s Brochure (IB) of BIVV009 . Also, reports that add 
significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already documented AE 
constitute unexpected AEs.  An event more specific or more severe than de scribed in the IB 
would be considered “unexpected.”  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is a serious adverse reaction, the 
nature or severity of which is not consistent with the IB.  All suspected adverse reactions 
related to BIVV009  that occur in the concerned clinical trial and that are both unexpected and 
serious (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are subject to expedited reporting  as per national regulatory requirements 
in participating countries .

Bioverativ [LOCATION_003] Inc.  Confidential  6.7.2  Clinical adverse events   
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs observed by [CONTACT_680188]’s medical records.  
The following AE attributes must be assigned by  [CONTACT_737]:  
 Adverse event term  
 Dates of onset and resolution  
 Seriousness (yes/no)/seriousness criterion  
 Severity  
 Assessment of relatedness to study drug  
 Outcome  
- Recovered/resolved  
- Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
- Not recovered/not resolved  
- Fatal  
- Unknown (only applicable if patient is lost to follow -up) 
 Action taken:  
- None  
- Study drug temporarily interrupted  
- Study drug permanently discontinued  
During the study, serious and non -serious AEs will be followed until resolved or clinically 
stable.  At the end of the study, all ongoing SAEs will be followed until resolved, stabilized, 
or returned to baseline.  
It will be left to the Investigator’s clinical judgment to determine whether an AE is related 
and of sufficient severity to require the patien t’s removal from treatment or from the study.  
A patient may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what he or she perceives as an 
intolerable AE.  If either of these situations arise s, the patient should be strongly encouraged 
to undergo an E T visit assessment  and be under medical supervision until symptoms cease or 
the condition becomes stable.  
All clinical AEs encountered during the clinical study will be reported on the AE page of the 
eCRF , regardless of causality . Severity of AEs will be graded using the CT CAE , version  4.03 
(see Section  10.2, Appendix B ).  
If an AE occurs that is not contained in the CTCAE version 4.03, the five -point scale below 
will be used.  
Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated  
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate  instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)

Bioverativ [LOCATION_003] Inc.  Confidential  7 DATA ANALYSES AND SAMPLE SIZE   
Data from Part A and Part B of this study will be analyzed and reported separately.  A 
separate Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) for each part of the study will be produced provid ing 
full details of all analy ses to be performed for Part A and Part B.  Should there be any 
differences between the analyses plan and methodology described within the SAP versus the 
clinical protocol, the SAP will take precedence.  
For the purpose s of regul atory submission, an interim analysis of  the Part A data will be 
performed after all patien ts have completed Part A. 
7.1 DESCRIPTION OF OBJEC TIVES AND ENDPOINTS   
The objectives of the  study and the endpoints to be analyzed are described in Section  4.3. 
In general, continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086], including: 
number, mean, median, standard deviation  (SD) , minimum, and maximum.  Categorical 
variables and respon se variables will be presented with the number and percentage in each 
category.  Any hypothesis tests will be performed at a two -sided 0.[ADDRESS_920400] dose of study drug.  
For endpoints involving laboratory parameters, results from the central laboratory will be 
used.  Local lab oratory values will be utilized for medical management of the patient, 
including assessing the Hgb criteria necessitating blood transfusions.  
7.2 DEMOGRAPHICS AND BAS ELINE DISEASE CHARAC TERISTICS   
Demographic and other baseline disease characteristics will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics for the overall population . Data to be tabulated will include, but not be limited to, 
age, race, medical history, and other disease -specific measures.  
7.3 EFFICACY  - PART A   
7.3.1  Analysis population s  
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS Populatio n is defined as all p atients who received at least 
1 dose of study drug.  
Per-Protocol (PP) Population : The PP Population is defined as a subset of FAS Population 
who do not have any important protocol deviations impacting their efficacy assessments.  
The FAS analyses will be the primary analyses and the PP analyses will be considered as 
supportive.  
The patients in the FAS population that are excluded from the PP Population will be listed, 
together with the reason for exclusion from the PP Population.

Bioverativ [LOCATION_003] Inc.  Confidential  7.3.2  Methods of analysis   
Each patient in the FAS Population will be classified as a responder or non -responder per the 
response criteria, and the proportion of responders will be calc ulated together with a 
95% exact Clopper -Pearson confidence interval  (CI). To assess the hematology component of 
response, the mean of the non -missing Hgb assessments at the Week 23, Week 25 , and 
Week 26 analysis visits (treatment assessment endpoint) will be used.  Visit windows will be 
used to assign analysis visits, as detailed in the SAP. Patients missing all three analysis visits 
will be counted as non -responders.  
Under the assumption that a response rate of less than or equal to 30% is not clinically 
relevant , the success criteria for the primary endpoint will be that the 95% lower  bound CI for 
response rate  excludes 30% using the exact Clopper -Pearson method.  That is, this criterion  is 
equivalent to demonstrating at the 2 -sided 0.05 level of significa nce that the true response 
rate is >30%.  
The hypotheses to be tested are:  
H0: response rate  ≤30% 
Ha: response rate  >30% 
Because this is a one -sided test, the level of statistical significance (Type I error) will be 
controlled at the one -sided 0.[ADDRESS_920401] and 
corresponds to a two-sided 95% CI. Sensitivity analyses will be carried out to evaluate the 
impact by [CONTACT_612862], if appropriate.  Details will be specified in SAP.  
All secondary endpoints will b e analyzed using descriptive statistics, frequency, percentage, 
and 95% CIs as appropriate.  Change from baseline for continuous parameters will be 
analyzed using a one-samp le t-test. All hypothesis tests will be performed at a two -sided 
0.05 significance  level.  
As a secondary sensitivity analysis, the efficacy analysis will be repeated with patients 
stratified by [CONTACT_612863]/or cytotoxic therapy versus patients who are 
naïve to rituximab therapy and/or cytotoxic therapy using the FAS populations.  
Other e fficacy assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_680191] , proportions , and graphically where applicable.  
7.4 EFFICACY - PART B   
7.4.1  Analysis popu lation s  
Full Analysis Set (FAS): FAS is defined as all patients who received at least 1  dose of study 
drug in Part B .

10.10  APPENDIX  J: COUNTRY SPECIFIC REQ UIREMENT - HOME INFUSIONS WITH  
BIVV009   
Compared to the global protocol, the following country specific changes are applicable to the 
US, the Netherlands, Norway, [LOCATION_009], Italy, Austria, [LOCATION_013], and Spain:  
Synopsis (Objectives)  
Part B  
Exploratory objective:  
 To describe the safety and patient satisfaction with the con venience of home infusions 
with BIVV009 in a subset of patients.  
Synopsis (Test Product(s), Dose, and Mode of Administration)  
Home infusion will be performed by a healthcare professional caregiver contingent upon 
completion of training delivered by [CONTACT_680195], in whom previous on -site infusions 
were uncomplicated, and who satisfy the following criteria:  
1. Able to comprehend and give informed consent for partici pation in the alternate home 
infusion scheme and willing to be infused at home for at least [ADDRESS_920419] durin g home visits 
specific information (AEs, concomitant medications, solicited anemia assessment as well as, 
after the 1st and 4th home infusions, Home Infusion Patient Satisfaction Questionnaires 
(Section  10.11 , Appendix K ). The data collected on dedicated paper forms will be provided 
to the Investigator within [ADDRESS_920420] during infusion lasting 1 -hour or, in certain patients 2 -hour ( eg, patients with 
underlying cardiopulmonary disease, with sponsor's approval) and for [ADDRESS_920421] and 4th home infusion, the patient will answer 
(by [CONTACT_680196]) the Home Infusion Patient Satisfaction  which will be applied after the 
end of study drug administration . Neither blood samples nor urine or serum pregnancy tests 
will be performed during home infusion visits; blood tests scheduled to be performed at 2, or 
4 weeks intervals as well urine or serum pregnancy tests in WOCBP (ie , women of child 
bearing potential) wi ll be performed during office visits every four weeks while the patient is 
within the home infusion scheme.  
In case a home infusion visit coincides with a visit with assessments scheduled to occur every 
[ADDRESS_920422] study drug infused at the site; the 
next home infusion visit will occur 2 weeks after this office visit and the schedule with home 
infusion visits every other bi -weekly visit alternating with regular office visit with drug 
infusion will be resumed . Patients who miss a dose (ie, outside the dosing window or 
>[ADDRESS_920423] dose was given at home or at the site) should return 
to the site for an unscheduled visit to receive another loading dose prior to their next 
schedule d visit which will also take place at the office. Such patient may return to the 
schedule of home visits alternating with regular office visits if eligibility criteria for home 
infusions are still met.  
Infusions given in the home setting versus at the inv estigational site will be captured through 
the case report form (CRF) for drug administration.

c Vital signs measurements (supi[INVESTIGATOR_30991], PR, RR, and oral temperature) are to be obtained with measurements performed predose and  
1 hour ( ±5 minutes) after completion of administration of each dose of study drug (on site visits onl y). 
d For a complete list of analytes, see protocol Section  10.1, Appendix A .  
e Study drug doses of 6.5 grams (if <75 kg ) or 7.5 grams (if ≥75 kg ) based on patient’s baseline body weight will be administered via IV 
infusion over ~  60 ±5 minutes, every 2 weeks during Part B.  Patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease may receive a 2 -hour 
infusion with Sponsor approval.  If a patient misses a scheduled dose (outside of the 2 -day window or >[ADDRESS_920428] dose), they 
must return to site (unscheduled visit) to receive another loading dose 1 week prior to the next scheduled dose  which will also be given 
at site . 
f During P art B, PK and PD samples will continue to be collected routinely at predose and 1 hour (±15 minutes) postdose at [ADDRESS_920429]  dose of 
study drug. For patients with home infusions, safety assess ments will additionally include AEs with onset within 24 hours of the  
infusion.  
h To be performed every 3 months during the on -site visits.  
i During Part B, the healthcare resource utilization data will be recorded every 4 weeks, at on site visit . 
j To be performed in the following order: FACIT -Fatigue first, PGIS second, PGIC third, SF -[ADDRESS_920430] and 4th home infusions  (which will be applied after the end of study drug administration ). 
m In Part B, home visit is alternating with every 4 weeks with site visit and if needed, a loading dose can be infused at the s ite visit.  
n HCP records and AEs will be collected on paper forms and will be forwarded to PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24h; site will be informed of any AEs 
immediately; All SAE reporting timelines still apply (ie need to be reported to sponsor safety database within 24 hours of aw areness by 
[CONTACT_680197]).  
o In Part B, hematology and clinical chemistry pan els to be performed every 2 weeks after Week 25 and up to Week 7 9 (every 4 weeks 
in patients within the home infusion scheme) . For the remainder of Part B after Week [ADDRESS_920431] ing should occur every 6 months at on site visits in Part B.  
Section 2.2 (Background and Study Rationale)  
Patients with CAgD are often elderly and/or have numerous co -morbidities affecting their 
mobility. Moreover, clinical centers specialized in the manag ement of CAgD are infrequent 
and may be located far from patients’ home. Consequently, some patients may find the option 
of home infusions with drug against CAgD, beneficial. To this end a group of patients at 
preselected sites/countries will be offered th e possibility of home infusions during Part B, 
assisted by [CONTACT_612877].  
Section 2.2.4 (Potential Risks and Benefits)  
Home infusions with the study drug will be proposed to a number of patients in countries pre -
selected to participate i n home infusion. Home infusions will be assisted by a trained 
healthcare professional, and will concern patients who express such wish, after having been 
qualified by [CONTACT_680181] 41 (Day 287) and without 
evidence of intol erance of the study drug as determined by [CONTACT_737]. No new risks 
related to home infusions are anticipated. Like with office visits, medications such as 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_22493] e and  diphenhydramine, and  additional emergency equipment will be available in 
case an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis occurs during home infusion.   Professional healthcare 
caregiver will be qualified to detect and treat allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. The 
alternating schedule of home infusion visits and office visits every 4 weeks e ach may be 
found convenient by [CONTACT_680198].

Bioverativ [LOCATION_003] Inc.  Confidential  Section 3.5 (Exploratory objective [Part B])  
 To describe the safety and patient satisfaction with the convenience of home infusions 
with BIVV009 in a subset of p atients in the US, the Netherlands, Norway, [LOCATION_009], 
Italy, Austria, [LOCATION_013], and Spain.  
Section 4.1 (Study Design: Part -B) 
A subset of patients from selected sites/countries  and who were determined to have tolerated 
BIVV009 well, will be invited to have i nfusions with BIVV009 performed at their homes, 
after having been qualified by [CONTACT_737]. Home infusions will be carried out by a 
trained nurse. Patients will follow the alternate home infusion scheme, ie, home infusion at 
the patient’s home will be  alternating with office visits, so that patients will attend office visit 
every 4 weeks alternating with home infusions every 4 weeks (+/ -2 days).  
Section 5. 3 (Removal of Patients from Study Participation, and Study Suspension and 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869])  
Patients  undergoing home infusions with BIVV009 will return to bi -weekly dosing at the 
study site if they develop any adverse event that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], may 
jeopardize patient safety if home infusions are continued. Patients may return to home 
infusions if the AE, which led to the interruption of home infusions according to the 
Investigator’s judgement, is considered unrelated to BIVV009 and once resolved or 
stabilized.  
Section 6.1, Table -3 (Footnote “i”)  
Study drug doses of 6.5 grams (if <75 kg) or 7.5 grams (if ≥75 kg) based on patient’s baseline 
body weight will be administered via IV infusion over ~60 ±5 minutes on Days 0, 7, and 
every 14 days thereafter during Part A and every 2 weeks (+/-2 days) starting at 
Week  27 during  Part B.  Patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease may receive a 
2-hour infusion with Sponsor approval.  If a patient misses a scheduled dose (outside of the 
2-day window or >[ADDRESS_920432] dose), they must return to site (unscheduled visit) to 
receive another loa ding dose [ADDRESS_920433] study drug dosed at home, alternating with study drug dosed 
during office visits in Part B.  
Section 6.1. 6 (Infusion of the study drug at patient’s home)  
Home infusions will be performed at pre -selected countries/sites , during Part B and will be 
performed  by a healthcare professional caregiver contingent upon completion of training 
delivered by [CONTACT_680199] s willing to be 
administered study drug at home, and in whom previous on -site infusions were 
uncomplicated, who satisfy the following criteria:  
1. Able to comprehend and give informed consent for participation in the alternate home 
infusion scheme and willing  to be infused at home for at least [ADDRESS_920434] specific 
inform ation (AEs, concomitant medications, Home Infusion Patient Satisfaction 
Questionnaires, after the 1st and 4th home infusions, as well as solicited anemia assessment) 
during home visits  which will be applied after the end of study drug administration . The d ata 
collected on dedicated paper forms will be provided to the Investigator within [ADDRESS_920435] during 1 -hour or, in 
certain patients 2 -hour infusion ( eg, patients with underlying cardiopul monary disease, with 
sponsor's approval) and for at least [ADDRESS_920436] study drug infused at the site; the 
next home infusion visit will occur 2 weeks after this office visit and the schedule with home 
infusion visits every other bi -weekly visit alternating with regular office visit with drug 
infusion will be resumed. Patients who miss a dose (ie, outside the dos ing window or 
>[ADDRESS_920437] dose was given at home or at the site) should return 
to the site for an unscheduled visit to receive another loading dose prior to their next 
scheduled visit which will also take place at the offic e. Such patient may return to the 
schedule of home visits alternating with regular office visits if eligibility criteria for home 
infusions are still met.  
First office visit [ADDRESS_920438] home infusion will include assessments normally planned 
to be  performed every 3 months. Neither blood samples nor urine pregnancy tests will be 
collected/performed during home infusion visits; blood tests scheduled to be performed at 
2, or 4 weeks intervals as well urine pregnancy tests in WOCBP ( ie, women of child bearing 
potential) will be performed during office visits every four weeks while the patient is within 
the home infusion scheme.  
Infusions given in the home setting versus at the investigational site will be captured through 
the case report form (CRF) for  drug administration.   
Section 6.2.1 (Drug Supplies and Accountability)  
Preparation and accountability procedures for the investigational product, including those 
associated with home infusions whenever applicable, are described in further detail in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
Section 6.2.4 (Dose Preparation and Administration)  
Patients must be monitored for acute allergic reactions during infusion and for at least [ADDRESS_920439] be immediately discontinued  and the patient treated as 
appropriate, and in case of home infusion, the Investigator notified immediately.

2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted
Atopic dermatitis (AD ) is an inflammatory, pruritic, chronic or chronically relapsing skin disease.  The 
adult phase of AD begins at puberty and frequently continues into adulthood.  In adults, disease typi[INVESTIGATOR_593226], face, neck, upper arms and back, and dor sal surfaces of the hands and feet.1,2
Management of AD primarily consists of trigger avoidance, careful attention to skin care, and both 
pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment.3  The 2018 Consensus -based European guidelines for 
treatment of AD recommends treatment by [CONTACT_110975] a stepwise fashion based on disease 
severity, starting with topi[INVESTIGATOR_593227]/or a topi[INVESTIGATOR_593228], severe disease.4  Systemic immunomodulatory 
agents used to treat AD include cyclosporin A, azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, 
interferon gamma, systemic corticosteroids, and dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], a monoclonal antibody that inhibits 
interleukin (IL) -[ADDRESS_782748] for AD is supported by [CONTACT_110976] -inflammatory cytokines that 
signal via JAK pathways in the pathogenesis of AD.  The activation of JAK signaling initiates expression of 
survival factors, cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules that facilitate leukocyte cellular trafficking 
and cell proliferation, which contribute to AD and other inflammatory disorders.8,9
Upadacitinib is an oral, reversible JAK1 selective inhibitor.  JAK1 inhibition blocks the signa ling of many 
important pro -inflammatory cytokines, including IL -2, IL-6, IL-7, and IL -15, which are known contributors 
to inflammatory disorders.  Through modulation of these proinflammatory cytokine pathways, 
upadacitinib offers the potential for efficaci ous treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders 
such as AD, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, axial 
spondyloarthritis, and giant cell arteritis.  In the upadacitinib Phase 2 AD study, a statisticall y significant 
difference in the mean percent change from Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score at 
Week 16 (primary endpoint) was observed for 7.5 mg ( –39.4%; P= 0.032 versus [vs.] placebo), 15 mg 
(–61.7%; P< 0.001 vs placebo), and 30 m g (–74.4%; P< 0.001 vs placebo) groups compared with placebo 
(–23.0%).  Through Week 16 (Period 1), the percentages of subjects with adverse events (AEs), serious 
adverse events (SAEs), severe AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were similar across tr eatment 
groups.  There were no deaths reported during Period 1.
Upadacitinib is also being investigated in clinical programs for various indications including RA and 
inflammatory bowel disease.  The results from the RA studies have been submitted for marke ting 
authorization application.  Upadacitinib is generally safe and well tolerated as demonstrated in the RA 
patient population.  No new safety concerns have been identified in the ongoing studies for other 
indications.  Upadacitinib is expected to be well tolerated in adult subjects with moderate to severe AD.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Clinical Hypothesis
Based on the differentiated selectivity profile for JAK1 inhibition, upadacitinib could demonstrate a 
sustained, favorable benefit -risk profile in AD.  
Additional information reg arding indications under study can be found in the current edition of the 
upadacitinib Investigator's Brochure.[ADDRESS_782749] common adverse events (AEs) 
of topi[INVESTIGATOR_593229], acne, dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and s triae.  Common AEs associated with use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_593230], burning, itching, or stinging at the application site.  When topi[INVESTIGATOR_593231], systemic therapy or ph ototherapy 
are generally added to topi[INVESTIGATOR_12450].4,11
Treatment guidelines developed by [CONTACT_593249][INVESTIGATOR_110931]/or
phototherapy do not adequately control the signs and symptoms of disease.  These guidelines recognize 
that insufficient data exist to firmly recommend optimal dosing, duration of therapy, and precise 
monitoring protocols for any systemic immunomodulating medication.5,12  Importantly, in addition to 
the lack of well -controlled efficacy data supporting their use in moderate to severe AD, the duration of 
use of many traditional systemic immunomodulatory agents are limited due to cumulative toxicity.5,12
More recently, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], a monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL -4 and IL -13 signaling, was approved 
for the treatment of m oderate to severe AD in adults in the European Union (EU)13and [LOCATION_002] 
(US)14in 2017.  Although dupi[INVESTIGATOR_110932], 
a large unmet need still exists in this population since, in the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_110933] 3 studies (even when 
combined with topic al corticosteroids), fewer than 40% of patients achieved 0 or 1 on the Investigator's 
Global Assessment (IGA) scale; therefore, 60% or more of patients continued to experience significant 
symptoms on dupi[INVESTIGATOR_81228].6,7  Nearly 50% of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_593232] [ADDRESS_782750] 
common AEs associated with use of cyclosporin are abnormal renal function tests (e.g., increased 
creatinine or proteinuria), hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypertension, headache, and hypertrichosis.5,[ADDRESS_782751] 
common AEs associated with use of methotrexate are gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., stomatitis, oral 
ulcers, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea) and abnormal liver function tests (e. g., increased

associated with use of mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine are gastrointestinal disorders 
(e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], bloating, anorexia) and occasional leukopenia, 
anemia, and thrombocytopenia.5,[ADDRESS_782753] renal and/or liver function.5,[ADDRESS_782754] been 
reported in the RA clinical studies for upadacitinib.  Based on the integrated data from the Phase 3 RA 
studies, there were comparable incidence rates of malignancies other than non- melanoma skin cancer 
(NMSC) between the upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD groups with long -term treatment.  NMSC is a 
common malignancy in the general population.  Although the incidence rate of NMSC was higher in the 
upadacitinib 30 mg group compared to the upadacit inib 15 mg group in the integrated analysis data, the 
risk of patients experiencing a NMSC when receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg in the Phase 3 RA 
studies did not appear to increase over time.  Based on review of the data available, no pattern of the
types of malignancies was noted, the malignancies are expected for a population of patients with 
moderately to severely active RA, and the standardized incidence rate is within the expected range for 
the general population.  The safety profile specific to upadacitinib is evolving, with safety results to date 
consistent with those known to be associated with JAK inhibition, with non -serious infections 
(e.g., upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_110935]) being the most commonly reported AEs.  In 
addi tion, laboratory changes observed with upadacitinib include elevations of serum transaminases, 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], creatinine, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK); both increased and reduced hemoglobin, 
depending on baseline inflammatory burden; and reductions in white b lood cell (WBC) counts, including 
natural killer (NK) cells.
The results of all genetic toxicology testing indicate that upadacitinib is not genotoxic; however, 
upadacitinib is teratogenic based on animal studies, which necessitates avoidance of pregnancy in 
females of childbearing potential.  Based on an embryo fetal development study in rats, there is judged 
to be no risk associated with administration of upadacitinib to male partners of females of childbearing 
potential.
Primary results from the ongoing Phase 2 study demonstrated superior efficacy of upadacitinib with an 
acceptable safety profile at the selected doses for Phase 3 (15 mg and 30 mg once daily [QD]) compared 
to placebo in subjects with moderate to severe AD.  Taken together, the safety and e fficacy data from 
upadacitinib studies to date show a favorable benefit -risk profile for upadacitinib and support the 
continued investigation of upadacitinib in patients with various autoimmune/inflammatory conditions.

that will help to understand the subject's disease and response to u padacitinib.  Genes of interest may 
include those associated with pharmacokinetics (drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transport proteins), 
genes within the target pathway (JAK, tyrosine kinase 2 [Tyk2], tumor necrosis factor [TNF]), or other 
genes believed t o be related to AD and other inflammatory diseases (Filaggrin [FLG], Claudin 1, Human 
Leukocyte Antigen [HLA], Immunoglobulin E [IgE]).  Research may also include epi[INVESTIGATOR_593235]'s response to treatment or dise ase.  Samples for RNA and 
proteomics will be used to research if any genetic variants result in changes to gene expression or 
protein concentrations.  For any samples collected in [LOCATION_013], the research will be restricted to 
upadacitinib and AD.
This research may be exploratory in nature and the results may not be included with the clinical study 
report.

4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a Phase 3b, single arm, open- label extension (OLE) study for adults (18 –75 years of age at entry 
into Study M16 -046) with moderate to severe AD who have successfully completed treatment in 
Study M16 -046.  These subjects should be determined to be eligible to continue treatment with 
upadacitinib by [CONTACT_079] [CONTACT_78482] B aseline visit of this OLE study.  The Baseline visit 
for this study will be the Week 24 visit of Study M16 -046.
The study is comprised of a Baseline visit (Week 24 visit of Study M16 -046), a 52 -week open -label 
treatment period, and an End -of-Study Follow -Up Visit (or phone call if a visit is not possible) [ADDRESS_782758] dose of upadacitinib.  The 30 -day follow -up visit is done to determine the status of any 
ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs is required.  These subjects will be considered 
as having completed the study.
Subjects, who are eligible to enroll in the OLE study, will receive daily oral doses of upadacitinib 30 mg 
from the Baselin e visit up to the Week 52 visit.
The schematic of the study is shown in Figure 1.  Further details regarding study procedures are in the 
Operations Manual (Appendix F).
See Section 5for informa tion regarding eligibility criteria.
An interim analysis will occur after all ongoing subjects have completed the Week 16 visit.

STUDY M19 -850  |  Version 5.0  |  EudraCT [ADDRESS_782759] completed Study M16 -046 without permanent discontinuation of study drug are 
eligible for Study M19 -850.  Results in the Phase 2 study that evaluated upadacit inib treatment for AD 
demonstrated superior efficacy of upadacitinib with an acceptable safety profile at the selected dose 
(30mg QD) compared to placebo in subjects with moderate to severe AD.  Therefore, this subject 
population is considered appropriate for this OLE study.
Selection of Doses in the Study
This study will evaluate upadacitinib (30 mg QD) as the same dose selected in Study M16 -046.  The 
selection of this dose was informed by [CONTACT_110981] 16 -week safety, efficacy, and exposure -
respons e data of the Period 1 of Phase 2 AD Study M16 -048, which evaluated 3 doses of upadacitinib 
(7.5 mg, 15 mg, or 30 mg QD) versus placebo.  In addition, all the currently available PK, 
pharmacodynamic, safety, and efficacy data from upadacitinib studies were used to support the 
selection of these doses.
The Phase 2 study results demonstrated superior efficacy of upadacitinib with an acceptable safety 
profile at the selected dose (30 mg QD) compared to placebo in subjects with moderate to severe AD.  
Preliminary exposure -response analyses for Period 1 of the Phase 2b study show that the percentage of 
subjects achieving EASI 75, EASI 90, or IGA 0/[ADDRESS_782760] voluntarily sign and date an informed consent, approved by [CONTACT_26236] (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB), prior to the initiation of any stud y-
specific procedures and comply with the requirements of this study protocol.

The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the subject and answer 
all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any study -related procedures being performed on the subject 
or any medications being discontinued by [CONTACT_17204], the informed 
consent statement will be reviewed, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_593255], the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according 
to local requirements.  A copy of the signed informed consent will be given to the subject and the 
original will be placed in the subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in the subject's dated 
source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study -related procedures 
and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding benefits for subjects and informa tion regarding provisions for treating and/or 
compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in 
the informed consent form.
Optional biomarker research samples will only be collected if the subject has volun tarily signed and 
dated a written consent form describing the exploratory research.  The written consent may be part of 
the main consent form.  If the subject does not consent to providing optional samples, the subject will 
still be allowed to participate in the study.
In cases of state of emergency or pandemic situations, it is possible that additional protocol 
modifications not outlined in this protocol may become necessary.  If this situation arises, in addition to 
the study informed consent, additional verbal consent may be obtained prior to these adaptations or 
substantial changes in study conduct in accordance with local regulations.
Adverse Event Assessment
The subjects will undergo physical examination for any active AEs and AEs that have occurred an d 
resolved since the last visit as well as be interviewed for AEs that are not apparent in a physical 
examination.  AEs or SAEs ongoing at Week 24 of Study M16 -046 will be followed in Study M19 -850.  
Please refer to Section 6.1.
Patient -Reported Outcomes
Subjects will complete the self -administered patient -reported outcome (PRO) instrument (when allowed 
per local regulatory guidelines).  Subjects should be instructed to follow the instructions provided with 
the instrument and to provide the best possible response to each item.  Site personnel shall not provide 
interpretation or assistance to subjects other than encouragement to complete the tasks.  Subjec ts who 
are functionally unable to read any of the instruments may have site personnel read the questionnaire 
to them.  Site personnel will encourage completion of the instrument at all specified visits.
Subjects will complete the following questionnaires (described below) as specified in the Operations 
Manual ( Appendix F):  Worst Pruritus NRS; and Head and Neck -Patient Global Impression of Severity

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].(HN-PGIS).  The subject should complete the questionnaires before site personnel perform any clinical 
assessments and preferably before any interaction with site personnel has occurred to avoid biasing the 
subject's response.
A validated translation will be provided in their local language, as applicable.  All PROs are collected 
electronically.
The PRO instrument should be completed prior to drug administration on Day [ADDRESS_782783]'s 
responses.  The subject's ability to view the PRO to understand the questions and response options 
should be preserved.  Sites may share the questi onnaire by [CONTACT_355274] 
(email or hard copy) to the subjects to allow them to read/understand the questions and responses 
when the subject is providing responses over the phone.  The date and time of PRO data collection 
should be recorded along with who collected the information.
Subjects will complete the following questionnaires as specified in the schedule of assessments:
Worst Pruritus NRS
The Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is an assessment tool that subjects u sed to report the 
intensity of their pruritus during a daily recall period.  Subjects are asked the question:  "On a scale of [ADDRESS_782784] 24 hours?"  The NRS will be administered on the tablet at specified site visits in 
Appendix D.
Head and Neck Patient Global Impression of Severity
The He ad and Neck -Patient Global Impression of Severity (HN -PGIS) asks subjects to describe the 
severity of their head and neck AD symptoms right now.  Subjects rate their head and neck AD 
symptoms on a 7 -point scale ranging from 0 = Absent (no symptoms) to 6 = Very Severe (cannot be 
ignored and markedly limits my daily activities).  The PGIS will be administered on the tablet at specified 
site visits in Appendix D.
Investigator Assessment
The investigator assessments will be recorded on paper worksheets and entered into the eCRF and 
conducted at the study visits specified in Appendix D.  In order to minimize variability, the same assessor 
should evaluate the subject at each visit for the duration of the trial.  The assessor must be a qualified 
medical professional (e.g., nurs e, physician's assistant, or physician).  Any assessor must be trained and 
competent in performing such assessments.  It is the responsibility of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_593241] t hat all training is 
documented.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Eczema Area and Severity Index
The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and 
extent of AD.  The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72.  Four AD disease 
characteristics (erythema, thickness [induration, papulation, edema], scratching [excoriation], and 
lichenification) will each be assessed for severity by [CONTACT_12903] a scale of "0" 
(absent) through "3" (severe).  In addition, t he area of AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage 
by [CONTACT_12904], trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs, and converted to a score of 0 to 6.  In each 
body region, the area is expressed as 0, 1 (1% to 9%), 2 (10% to 29%), 3 (30% to 49%), 4 (50% to 69%), 
5(70% to 89%), or 6 (90% to 100%).
Body Surface Area Involvement of Atopic Dermatitis (BSA, %)
A qualified investigator or designee should select the subject's right or left hand as the measuring 
device.  For purposes of clinical estimation, the total surface of the palm plus five digits will be assumed 
to be approximately equivalent to 1%.  Measurement of the total area of involvement by [CONTACT_593256].  The site should make every attempt to have the same qualified 
investigator or designee perform all BSA assessments on a given subject throughout the study.
None of the investigator assessments described above (EASI , BSA) can be performed remotely, as they 
require in person evaluation of the skin.
Tuberculosis Testing/Tuberculosis Prophylaxis
The TB screening tests provide diagnostic test results to be interpreted in the context of the subject's 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], history, exam findings, etc., and it is the responsibility of the investigator to determine if a 
subject has previous, active, or latent TB.  Expert consultation for the evaluation and/or management of 
TB may be considered per investigator discretion.
Subj ects with a negative TB test result during Study M16 -[ADDRESS_782785] to 
be performed.  At Week 28 (approximately 1 year after the TB screening in Study M16- 046), all subjects 
will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB by a risk questionnaire (see Operations Manual, 
Appendix F) and tested for TB infection by [CONTACT_82736] -TB Gold test.  The site staff will complete the 
TB risk questionnaire in its entirety and enter the data into the appropriate eCRF.  One or more "yes" 
response on the TB risk questionnaire indicates increased risk of TB.
The annual TB -test can be completed at the earliest feasible opportunity if not able to be completed per 
protocol schedule due to COVID -[ADDRESS_782786] (at Week 28) is newly positive 
(seroconversion), a chest x -ray needs to be performed as soon as possible to aid in distinguishing active 
versus latent TB.  Any positive TB test during the study should be reported as an AE of latent TB or active 
TB (as applicable).
If the subject is experiencing signs or symptoms suspi[INVESTIGATOR_110957]'s medical history to warrant investigation and a repeat test before the next scheduled annual TB 
retest at Week 28 visit, the case (including the TB test results) should be discussed with the [COMPANY_013] TA 
MD.
Subjects with evidence of active TB must not continue in the OLE study.

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].TB Testing:
The QuantiFERON -TB Gold test (or equivalent) should be performed for all subjects.  The 
purified protein derivative (tuberculin) ([COMPANY_003]) skin test should be utilized when the 
QuantiFERON -TB Gold test (or equivalent) is not possible or if both tests are required per lo cal 
guidelines.
Subjects with documentation of prior positive result of QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test and/or [COMPANY_003] 
skin test are not required to repeat either test during the study and should be considered 
positive.
For regions that require both [COMPANY_003] and QuantiFER ON-TB Gold testing, both will be performed.  If 
either [COMPANY_003] or QuantiFERON -TB Gold is positive, the TB test is considered positive.
If only a [COMPANY_003] is placed at Study M16 -046, then the TB test to be used for the open label study for 
that subject is the [COMPANY_003] te st.  Similarly, if a subject enters the study with a QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
test alone, then the subject should have their annual TB test performed with a QuantiFERON -TB 
Gold test.
If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test is NOT possible (or if both the QuantiFERON -TBGold Test and 
the [COMPANY_003] are required per local guidelines) the [COMPANY_003] will be performed.  The [COMPANY_003] should be read 
by a licensed healthcare professional between [ADDRESS_782787].  The 
reaction will be measured in millimeters (mm) of induration and induration ≥ 5 mm is 
considered a positive reaction.  The absence of induration will be recorded as "0 mm" not 
"negative."
Subjects who have an ulcerating reaction to [COMPANY_003] in the past should not be re -exposed and the 
[COMPANY_003] should be considered positive.
If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is indeterminate, then the investigator should perform a local 
QuantiFERON -TB Gold test (or through the central laboratory if not locally available) to rule out 
a positive test result.  If testing remains indeterminate or is positive, then the subject is 
considered to be positive for the purpose of this study.  If the testing result is negative, then the 
patient is considered to be negative.
In cases where the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test by [CONTACT_355268] (i.e., no risk factors identified in the TB 
questionnaire) and has no clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_110958], th e investigator may perform a local 
QuantiFERON -TB Gold test (or repeat testing through the central laboratory if not locally 
available) to confirm the positive test result.  If the repeat testing result is negative, the 
investigator may consider the test t o be negative based on his/her clinical judgment; if the 
repeat testing result is positive, the test is considered positive.
An equivalent Interferon Gamma Release Assay (such as T- SPOT TB test) may be substituted for 
the QuantiFERON -TB Gold.

During the study, subjects with new evidence of latent TB must initiate prophylactic treatment 
immediately per local guidelines and complete at least [ADDRESS_782788] should be re -evaluated (unscheduled visit) for signs 
and symptoms as well as laboratory assessment of toxicity to TB prophylaxis.  Newly initiated 
prophylactic treatment and prior therapy should be captured in the eCRF.
Subjects with a prior history of latent TB that have documented completion of a full course of anti -TB 
therapy will be allowed to enter the study provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history 
to warra nt repeat treatment.  For subjects with completion of a full course of anti -TB therapy, but 
insufficient documentation, the investigator should consult with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.
Chest X -Ray
Chest x -ray (posterior- anterior and lateral views) is required for all subjects to rule out the presence of 
TB or other clinically relevant findings following a newly positive result of a TB test.
Subjects can have a repeat chest x -ray at any time during the study as warranted based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8574].
A rad iologist or pulmonologist must perform and document an assessment of the chest x -ray.  The 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_593242].  In the assessment of the chest x -ray, the Principa l Investigator or their delegate must indicate 
the presence or absence of (1) calcified granulomas, (2) pleural scarring/thickening, and (3) signs of 
active TB.  If the chest x -ray demonstrates changes suggestive of previous TB (e.g., calcified nodule,

6SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
6.1 Complaints and Adverse E vents
Complaints
A complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the 
physical characteristics, identity, quality, purity, potency, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or 
performance of a produc t/device.  Complaints associated with any component of this investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_013].
Product Complaint
A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the 
medical device compone nt(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible ), missing components/product, device not working properly, 
or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 1 business day of the study site's knowledge of the event.  Product c omplaints occurring during 
the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administe red a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated wi th the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the 
product.  In contrast, an adverse reaction (AR) refers to all untoward and unintended responses to an 
investigational medicinal p roduct at least possibly related to any dose administered.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre -existing 
condition or illness is considered an AE.  Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a 
new AE.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result 
in discontinuation from the study d rug, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, meets protocol 
specific criteria (see Section 6.2regarding toxicity management) and/or if the inv estigator considers 
them to be AEs.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs at each visit 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
If any of the following events are repor ted, then the following supplemental report must be completed 
(Table 4).

an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any an omaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent 
Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., d eath of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medic al event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug a buse.
All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration through [ADDRESS_782798] the adjudication process, additional information on any potential major 
adverse cardiovascular events will be collected, if applicable.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 2.

Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigators will rate the severity of each AE according to the National Cance r Institute (NCI) 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.
If no grading criteria are provided for the reported event, then the event should be graded as follows:
Mild (Grade 1) Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnost ic observations only; 
intervention not indicated
Moderate (Grade 2) Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)
Severe (Grade 3 -5)
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; 
limiting self care ADL (Self care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden)
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
Grade 5 Death related to AE
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study 
drug:
Reasonable Possibility –After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, 
clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest 
a causal relationship.
No Reasonable Po ssibility –After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence 
(information) to suggest a causal relationship.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the 
study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being 
related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not 
reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, [COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_110966], an Other 
cause of event must be prov ided by [CONTACT_111001].

The management of specific AEs and laboratory parameters is described below.
Management of Serious Infections
Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during 
and after treatment with study drug.  Study drug should be interrupted if a subject develops a serious 
infection.  A subject who develops a new infection during treatment with study drug should undergo 
prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject.  As appropriate, 
antim icrobial therapy should be initiated, and the subject should be closely monitored.  Study drug may 
be restarted once the infection has been successfully treated.  Subjects who develop active TB must be 
permanently discontinued from study drug.  If a subject develops zoster, or shows infection with or 
reactivation of any other herpes virus (e.g., HSV, VZV, EBV, CMV), any study drug should at least be 
temporarily interrupted until the epi[INVESTIGATOR_176378], or discontinued as patient safety requires.
Management of Herpes Zoster
If a subject develops herpes zoster, consider temporarily interrupting study drug until the epi[INVESTIGATOR_438121].  Serious AEs of herpes zoster should be reported as serious infections.
Management of Serious Gastrointestinal Events
Subjects pres enting with the onset of signs or symptoms of a gastrointestinal perforation should be 
evaluated promptly for early diagnosis and treatment.  Subjects with acute, spontaneous perforation of 
the gastrointestinal tract that requires inpatient medical care or urgent surgical intervention (except for 
appendicitis or mechanical injury) must be permanently discontinued from study drug.
Management of Thrombosis Events
Subjects who develop symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated and treated 
appropriately.  If the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus or non -cardiac, 
non-neurologic arterial thrombosis is confirmed, the subject must be discontinued from study drug.
Management of Malignancy
Subjects who develop malignancy other th an NMSC or carcinoma in- situ of the cervix must be 
discontinued from the study drug.  Information including histopathological results should be queried for 
the confirmation of the diagnosis.  Periodic skin examination is recommended for subjects who are at
increased risk of skin cancer.
Management of ECG Abnormality
Subjects must be discontinued from study drug for an ECG change considered clinically significant and 
with reasonable possibility of relationship to study drug, OR a confirmed absolute Friderici a's correction 
formula (QTcF) value > 500 msec, OR a change of QTc interval > 60 msec from Baseline.
COVID -19
Interrupt study drug in subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID -19.  Consider interrupting study 
drug in subjects with signs and/or symptoms and suspi[INVESTIGATOR_166489] -19.  The COVID -[ADDRESS_782799] be

Laboratory 
Parameter Toxicity Management Guideline
Hemoglobin  If hemoglobin < 8 g/dL interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by [CONTACT_556018] a new sample
 If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from Baseline, without an alternative etiology, 
interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by [CONTACT_111003].
 If hemoglobin decreas es ≥ 3.0 g/dL from Baseline and an alternative etiology is 
known or the hemoglobin value remains in the normal reference range, the subject 
may remain on study drug at the investigator's discretion.
 If confirmed, continue to withhold study drug until hemog lobin value returns to 
normal reference range or its Baseline value.
Absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC) If confirmed < 1000/µL by [CONTACT_111003], interrupt study drug 
dosing until ANC value returns to normal reference range or its Baseline va lue.
 Interrupt study drug if confirmed < 500/μL by [CONTACT_111003].  If 
value returns to normal reference range or its Baseline value, restarting study drug is 
allowed if there is an alternative etiology identified; documentation should incl ude 
reason that rechallenge is expected to be safe for the subject.
Study drug should be discontinued if no alternative etiology can be found. 
Absolute 
lymphocyte counts 
(ALC) If confirmed < 500/µL by [CONTACT_111003], interrupt study drug dosing 
until ALC returns to normal reference range or its Baseline value.
Total white blood 
cell count  If confirmed < 2000/µL by [CONTACT_111003], interrupt study drug 
dosing until white blood cell count returns to normal reference range or its Baseline 
value.
Platelet count  If confirmed < 50,000/µL by [CONTACT_111003], interrupt study drug 
dosing until platelet count returns to normal reference range or its Baseline value.
AST or ALT  Interrupt study drug if confirmed ALT or AST > 3 × ULN by [CONTACT_111004] a total bilirubin > 2 × ULN or an international normalized ratio 
(INR) > 1.5. 
 A separate blood sample for INR testing will be needed to measure INR at the time of 
repeat testing for ALT or AST.  A repeat test of INR is not needed for determination if 
above toxicity management criteria are met.

 ALT> 5 × ULN OR
 ALT or AST > 3 × ULN if an alternate cause is not readily identified.
 A separate blood sample for HBV DNA PCR testing will be needed at the time o f 
repeat testing for ALT or AST.
A separate blood sample for HBV DNA PCR testing will be needed at the time of repeat 
testing for ALT or AST.  As with INR, a separate tube is needed.
A positive result for HBV DNA PCR testing will require immediate interruption of study 
drug (unless not acceptable by [CONTACT_111008]) and a hepatologist consultation should 
occur within [ADDRESS_782802] 
when an alternative etiology has been determined.  The alternative etiology should be
documented appropriately in the eCRF; study drug should be discontinued if no 
alternative etiology can be found and ALT or AST elevations persist. 
For any confirmed ALT or AST elevations > [ADDRESS_782803], complete the appropriate 
supplemental hepatic eCRF(s).
Serum Creatinine  If serum creatinine is > 1.5 × the Baseline value and > ULN, repeat the test for serum 
creatinine (with subject in an euvolemic state) to confirm the results.  If the results of 
the repeat testing still meet this criterion, then interrupt st udy drug and re -start 
study drug once serum creatinine returns to ≤ 1.5 × Baseline value and ≤ ULN.
For the above serum creatinine elevation scenario, complete the appropriate 
supplemental renal eCRF(s).
Creatine 
Phosphokinase If confirmed CPK value ≥ 4 × ULN and there are no symptoms suggestive of myositis 
or rhabdomyolysis, the subjects may continue study drug at the investigator's 
discretion.
 If CPK ≥ 4 × ULN accompanied by [CONTACT_372900], interrupt study drug and cont act [COMPANY_013] TA MD.
For the above CPK elevation scenarios, complete supplemental increased CPK eCRF.

An independent committee of physician experts in cardiovascular adjudication will be utilized to assess 
potential cardiovascular and thromboembolic AEs in a blinded manner.  Briefly, CAC consists of 
11voting members including 5 cardiologists, 3 neu rologists and 3 thrombotics/vascular specialists.  The 
events that are adjudicated are defined in the CAC charter.  The Sponsor/CRO will provide the list of 
events based on the pre -specified search criteria and all relevant information as a case package fo r CAC 
adjudication on a monthly basis.  Each randomly assigned CAC member will conduct independent review 
and submit an assessment of the adjudication outcome.  Events may be re -adjudicated if clinically 
relevant data changes or updates occur.  If a decisi on is not reached via independent review for events, 
a panel meeting may be held for the purpose of adjudication.  A CRO is responsible for coordinating all 
adjudication activities.  The details of the composition and process for the CAC are provided in th e CAC 
Charter.
6.4 Other Safety Data Collection
Specific manifestations of AD (i.e., itching, excoriations, oozing, crusting, erythema, etc.) should not be 
reported as individual AEs if they are considered to be a worsening of the underlying disease; instead, 
worsening of AD should be reported as the AE.
6.5 S[LOCATION_003]R Reporting
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for S[LOCATION_003]R reporting for the IMP in accordance with global and local 
guidelines and Appendix A of the Investigator Brochure will serve as the Reference Safety Informati on 
(RSI).  The RSI in effect at the start of a DSUR reporting period serves as the RSI during the reporting 
period.  For follow -up reports, the RSI in place at the time of occurrence of the 'suspected' Serious 
Adverse Reaction will be used to assess expect edness.
7 STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The statistical methods provided in this protocol will be focused on efficacy and safety summaries.  
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP), which will be signed off within [ADDRESS_782804] completed Week 16 and all 
data pertaining to Week 16 are cleaned.  The statistical analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS 
Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]). 
7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population consists of all subjects who receive at le ast one dose of study drug 
in the study and will be used for the efficacy analyses.

median, minimum, maximum, as well as the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the mean values.  
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_33335], as well as the 95% CIs of the 
percentages.
There will be no statistical testing for all of the efficacy and safety endpoints.
Efficacy assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_593260] (OC) approach.  No data imputation will be 
applied.  Observed Cases will not include values after a subject prematurely discontinue from study 
drug.
Sample Size Estimation
Approximately 600 subjects that complete treatment in Study M16 -046 will roll over in this open label 
treatment extension study.  The sample size is determined by [CONTACT_593261] M16 -046 and the 
consenting for the extensio n.
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_2695], physical examination, laboratory assessments, and vital signs.  Note that 
missing safety data will not be imputed.  Analysis details will be specified in the SAP.
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as those that began or worsened in severity after the 
first dose of study drug and no more than [ADDRESS_782806] dose of the study drug .  The number and 
percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs will be tabulated using the MedDRA SOC and PT, by [CONTACT_926], 
and by [CONTACT_82662].  Summaries (including percentages 
and events per 100 patient -year s) of SAEs, deaths, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AESI will be 
provided as well. 
For laboratory and vital signs, mean change from Study M16 -[ADDRESS_782807]

conduct and the ethical principles that have their origin in t he Declaration of Helsinki.  Responsibilities of 
the investigator are specified in Appendix B.
In cases of state of emergency or pandemic situation s leading to difficulties in performing protocol -
specified procedures, [COMPANY_013] will engage with study site personnel in efforts to ensure the safety of 
subjects, maintain protocol compliance, and minimize risks to the integrity of the study while trying to 
best manage subject continuity of care.  This may include alternative methods for assessments (e.g., 
phone contacts or virtual site visits), alternative locations for data collection (e.g., use of a local lab 
instead of a central lab), and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_593244]/or supplies direct to subjects to 
ensure continuity of treatment where allowed.  Refer to the Operations Manual for additional details.  In 
all cases, these alternative measures must be allowed by [CONTACT_17195] /IEC.  
Investigators should notify [COMPANY_013] if any urgent safety measures are taken to protect the subjects 
against any immediate hazard.

Summary of Protocol Changes:
The purpose of this version is to incorporate necessary protocol modifications due to the COVID -19 
pandemic, add an interim analysis, incorporate additional description about management of 
gastrointestinal performation and serious herpes zoster, and provide clarification about the timing of 
efficacy assessments.
Protocol modifications du e to the COVID -19 pandemic are as follows:
Section 2.2–included information on the re -evaluation of the benefit and risk to subjects 
participating in the study.  There is no additional risk to subjects or state what the additional 
risks are that may change the benefit -risk balance to participating subjects.
Section 5.5–added instructions to refer to Operations Manual for necessary changes to 
activities or procedures in the event of temporary study [drug] interruption/halt.
Section 5.7–included instructions that in the event the subject cannot pi[INVESTIGATOR_593246], refer to the Operations Manual for DTP shipment as needed and permitted by [CONTACT_13125].
Section 5.9–clarified that protocol deviations may include modifications due to COVID -19.
Section 8.2–noted that [COMPANY_013] will modify the study protocol as necessary due to the 
pandemic, referring to the Operations Manual in Appendix Ffor additional details.  Investigators 
must also notify [COMPANY_013] if any urgent safety measures are taken.
Section 9–noted that remote monitoring may be employed as needed
Appendix D–added reference to Operations Manual for allowed modification

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Appendix F–Operatio ns Manual updated to include details on how to perform specific 
activities/procedures that may be impacted by [CONTACT_117951]/local regulations due to the 
pandemic.
Statements about the interim analysis were added to the following subsections to incorpo rate this 
change:
Section 4.1–Sentence added that an interim analysis will be performed after all subjects have 
completed the Week 16 visit.
Section 7.1–Sentence added that an interim analysis will be performed after all subjects have 
completed the Week 16 visit and all data pertaining to Week 16 are cleaned.
Rationale:  To assess efficacy and safety after switching from dupi[INVESTIGATOR_593247] a 
similar timeframe as the upadacitinib atopic dermatitis pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 studies.
Updates to the description and management of gastrointestinal pe rforation (added text underlined) 
were made to:
Section 5.5–"Subject develops a gastrointestinal perforation (defined as acute, spontaneous 
perforat ion of the gastrointestinal tract that requires inpatient medical care or urgent surgical 
intervention other than appendicitis or mechanical injury).  See also Section 6.2Toxicity 
Management."
Section 6.2–Management of Serious Gastrointestinal Events –Subjects presenting with the 
onset of signs or symptoms of a gastrointestinal perforation should be evaluated promptly for 
early diagnosis and treatment.  Subjects with acute, spontaneous perforation of the 
gastrointestinal tract that requires inpatient medical care or urgent surgical intervention (except 
for appendicitis or mechanical injury) must be permanently discontinued from study drug.
Rationale:  To provide further clarity on the characteristics of GI perforations for investigators 
and requirement for permanent discontinuation of study drug.
Other changes:
Synopsis and Section 3.3–Wording was updated to state that efficacy endpoints will be 
assessed at all visits through Week 52 only. 
Rationale:  To provide clarification about the timing of efficacy assessments.
Section 6.2–Wording about management of herpes zoster was added:  "Serious AEs of herpes 
zoster should be reported as serious infections."
Rationale:  To incorporate wording from protocol version 4.1.1.
Section 6.2–Management of Hypersensitivity was removed.  Management of hypersensitivity 
was included in Study M16- 046 for subjects who received dupi[INVESTIGATOR_593248].  No subjects receive dupulimab in this 
extension study.
Rationale:  Management of hypersensitivity is not needed in studies when upadacitinib is the 
only treatment drug.

1.0 Background  
1.1 Lung Isolation For Thoracic Surgery  
In the 1930’s, lung isolation became possible with the introduction of 
single lumen endobronchial tubes, as well as endobronchial blockers. 
Thereafter, Carlens invented a double lumen tube (DLT) with a carinal 
hook in 1949, to assist in bronchial placement so that proper lung isolation 
could be maintained.[ADDRESS_1124427]. Thereafter in 1962, Robertshaw 
introduced a reusable red rubber DLT without a carinal hook.2 In addition 
Protocol# 2014 -0991  
Version 02-22-2016

to the reusability component, the right-sided red rubber Robertshaw DLT 
had a larger 22mm slotted endobronchial cuff for improved right upper 
lobe (RUL) ventilation.  
 
Subsequently, in the 1970's the primary airway device used for lung 
isolation in the [LOCATION_002] was the DLT. However, t he Robertshaw 
DLTs had their own unique problems: small internal channels, which made 
suction difficult as well as low volume -high pressure bronchial cuffs, which 
could lead to tracheal mucosa ischemia via compression. In the 1980's, 
disposable  polyvinylch loride (PVC) DLTs were created, which remain the 
mainstay of DLTs used currently for lung isolation.  These PVC DLTs have 
the advantage of high volume -low pressure tracheobronchial cuffs which 
inflate more evenly thus significantly decreasing the chances o f mucosal 
ischemia.  Furthermore, these PVC DLTs are easier to manipulate and 
place, while also offering larger internal lumens for suction and fiberoptic 
(FOB) scope placement, which is used to verify correct placement.  
 
Throughout the development of DLTs  and other lung isolation devices, the 
capability for direct visualization to insure correct placement of these 
devices has always been a major limiting factor for their use.  Proper 
placement is paramount to patient safety and device effectiveness.  The 
development and refinement of flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopes offered 
an alternative, more reliable method than auscultation  for proper 
placement of airway isolation devices.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1124428] of care. There are multiple 
studies that supp ort the use of FOB to confirm DLT placement.  
For example, one study found that despi[INVESTIGATOR_811973], 39% (79) of these patients had DLT malposition 
diagnosed by [CONTACT_477969].3 Moreover, of the 79 patients with malposition, 25 
were critical malpositions. Additionally, DLTs were malpositioned as often 
after positioning the patient for lateral thoracotomy (46%) as they were 
after intubation (53%). Similarly, yet another study foun d that auscultation 
failed to confirm accurate tube position in 28% of L DLT patients. 78% of 
left DLT patients and 83% of right DLT patients, who were intubated 
blindly, required repositioning with FOB.[ADDRESS_1124429] study found 
44% of DLTs required position readjustments using FOB during initial 
intubation and 30% required FOB readjustments during the operation.[ADDRESS_1124430] of care for confirmation of 
DLT, unfortunately many anesthesiologists lack the training and fam iliarity 
of tracheobronchial anatomy for adequate application of this technique, 
Protocol# 2014 -0991  
Version 02-22-2016  
Page 3 of 15 
 
leading to a high incidence (38%) of malposition despi[INVESTIGATOR_811974].[ADDRESS_1124431] placement 
could conceivably be higher in the practices of these non -thoracic 
anesthesiologists.  
 
Yet, a nother issue that limits the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy is 
availability.  Fiberoptic bronchoscopes are precision instrument s that are 
costly to acquire and maintain.  Because of the expenditure involved, 
smaller community health care centers and/or poorly funded hospi[INVESTIGATOR_811975]. As there is an increasing 
demand for one -lung ventil ation in both thoracic surgery and other 
procedures  (i.e. spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477] , cardiac surgery ), identifying the most 
effective technique of lung isolation for anesthesiologists with limited 
experience in lung isolation techniques, would benefit to improve the 
safety for patients.   
 
One such technologic advance has been in video camera and light source 
miniaturization, which may offer a novel solution to this problem. The 
VivasightTM (ET ViewLtd,Misgav,Israel)DLT is a video double -lumen 
tube(VDLT) that has an embedded camera and light source between  the 
tracheal and bronchial cuffs, enabling continuous airway visualization on a 
portable external proprietary monitor that is connected via a mini -USB 
adapter.  Heir and colleagues evaluated whether the use of a VD LT 
reduced the need for fiberoptic bronchoscopy for (1) verification of initial 
tube placement and for (2) reverification of correct placement after 
repositioning for thoracotomy.7 The study found that for 93.2% of patients, 
the use of FOB was not needed e ither for initial placement or for 
verification of correct VDLT placement upon final positioning of the patient. 
This study demonstrated that the VDLT requires significantly less (6.8%) 
FOB use for both initial placement and verification of final position,  in stark 
contrast to standard practice in which bronchoscopy is always used to 
verify final positioning of the double -lumen tube.   
 
Furthermore, the authors also noted that the continuous real time 
monitoring allowed for greater measure of safety , as they were able to 
forewarn the surgeon  when aggressive manipulation would otherwise 
have led to a malposition.  Furthermore, the real time image provided by 
[CONTACT_811984], could potentially allow for quick diagnosing of the 
Protocol# [ADDRESS_1124432] for verification of DLT placement.  However, there are 
institutions, which still promote a uscultation as viable method of DLT 
placement confirmation, as FOB may not always be available and trainees 
need to be able to properly position a DLT in less than ideal 
circumstances (off -site locations , broken equipment, etc).  However, even 
in most of t hese cases, this does not preclude that the tube position 
cannot then be confirmed with FOB, after the staff and/or resident have 
checked initially with auscultation.  
 
Furthermore, consideration has to be given to the fact that even with the 
use of FOB, co rrect tube position is not always obvious. There is a 
considerable learning curve to bronchoscopic positioning of double -lumen 
tubes, particularly when there are anatomic distortions because of tumor 
masses or previous surgery; analogous to anesthesiologis ts examining 
hundreds of routine airways to become comfortable with the airway 
anatomy. Therefore, correct placement of a DLT can be challenging and 
hence lung isolation may become difficult to achieve. Novel intubation 
devices like the VDLT have been deve loped that offer real -time 
continuous observation of the trachea and carina, thus allowing the 
anesthesiologist to confirm continuous correct placement and also 
recognize dislodgement.  
  
In addition , displacement and dislodgement of DLT is common and 
repea ted checks for correct positioning with a FOB are often necessary. In 
some cases these frequent checks can interfere with oxygenation and 
ventilation, which may pose a considerable risk to the patient. This 
potentially may be detrimental, as this can lead to hypoxemia and 
prolongation of the surgical procedure. Thus these newer intubation 
devices can offer continuous observation of the trachea and carina and 
Protocol# [ADDRESS_1124433] monitoring.  
 
 
2.0 VDLT  and DLT Information  
2.1 Description of VDLT  
2.1.1  The VDLT is essentially a FDA approved disposable, single use 
left-sided double lumen endobronchial tube with an embedded 
video imaging device and light source at its distal tip and integrated 
cable with connector. T he device is compatible with ETview’s 
displays and with medical grade NTSC video monitors.  The VDLT 
projects images of the airway onto the monitor screen during 
intubation and for as long as the device remains within the patient’s 
airway.  (See Appendix 3 ) 
2.1.2  The VDLT is made of PVC transparent material, with two low -
pressure cuffs and two color -coded, corresponding pi[INVESTIGATOR_811976]. 
The tracheal cuff with clear pi[INVESTIGATOR_811977].  The valves are intended for Luer and Luer-lock 
syringe tips.  It also comes with a stylet, which can be fixed to 
maintain the shape of the tube, as well as radiopaque intubation 
depth markers, which run along the tube’s wall.  Additionally, it has 
a red injection port leading to two lumens ru nning along the tube’s 
wall that open distal to the lens of the optics which can be used for 
cleaning the lens with air, saline or prescribed medications.  
2.1.3  Accessories:  The VDLT comes with a Y -pi[INVESTIGATOR_811978].  A small malleable 
metal stylet is also provided with the VDLT. It also comes with two 
suction catheters, which can be inserted in the tracheal or bronchial 
lumens to clear secretions.  
2.1.4  Thermal qualities:  The VDLT should not be used in surgical 
procedures that involve the use of a LASER beam near the VDLT.  
The VDLT should not be stored at temperatures greater than [ADDRESS_1124434] to preferentially ventilate one or both lungs, 
enabling lung isolation for the proposed surgery. The device comes 
in both left and right -sided versions. (See Appendix 4)  
2.2.2  The DLT is also made of PVC transparent m aterial, with two low -
pressure cuffs and two color -coded, corresponding pi[INVESTIGATOR_811976].

5.0 Treatment Plan  
5.1 Design:  2-arm, randomized prospective trial 
5.2 Randomization:   Patients will be randomized in a group that utilizes 
either a conventional DLT or VDLT for lung isolation for the purposed 
surgery. Patients will undergo surgical procedure after lung isolation is 
acquired with VDLT or DLT. The patients will undergo surg ical procedures 
that are part of their medical treatment and will not undergo any diagnostic 
or extra laboratory work as a result of participating in this study  
5.3 Explanation of Thoracic Anesthesia Intervention  
 One of the collaborating thoracic anesthesiolo gists will explain the 
procedure prior to obtaining consent. Consent  and randomization  will 
occur at minimum one hour  prior to surgery.  Randomization will be done 
after consent and by a computerized system.  
5.4 Withdrawal of individual subjects:  
Subjects can leave the study at any time for any reason if they wish to do 
so without any consequences. The investigator can decide to withdraw a 
subject from the study for urgent medical reason s.

judgment. Prophylactic antibiotics will be given per surgical routine.  A 
balanced anesthetic technique  comprising of narcotics, muscle relaxants, 
inhalational will be utilized to induce and maintain general anesthesia for 
all patients undergoing thoracic surgery.   
 
General anesthesia will be induced with fentanyl or sufentanil and propofol 
intravenously according to the anesthesiologist’s clinical judgment. 
Tracheal intubation will be facilitated by [CONTACT_652988] a 
nondepolarizing muscle relaxant. Anesthesia wil l be maintained with

Version 02-22-2016  
Page 8 of 15 
 
desflurane, sevoflurane or isoflurane in (50% –100%) oxygen or propofol 
infusion according to the anesthesiologist’s clinical judgment. 
Intraoperative analgesia will be obtained by [CONTACT_811986], fentanyl or hydromorphone.  
 
Alternatively, an epi[INVESTIGATOR_811980], according to 
the anesthesiologist’s clinical judgment if an epi[INVESTIGATOR_811981]. 
Hemodynamics will be maintained according to the clinical 
anesthesiologist’s judgment. Normothermia will be maintained with forced -
air warming. Antiemetics will be given according to the anesthesiologist’s 
clinical judgment. In those patients deemed to be awakened from general 
anesthesia when surgery is complete, muscle relaxation will be reversed 
and the trachea extubated.  
At the end o f surgery, hydromorphone or fentanyl will be given 
intravenously if considered necessary for pain control. In the postoperative 
care unit, patients may receive intravenous boluses of fentanyl, 
hydromorphone, or boluses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_811982] e pain 
control. In those patients for whom sedation and admission to the 
intensive care unit is necessary, intravenous propofol will be given 
continuously during transport.  
 
With respect to achievement of lung isolation for the proposed thoracic 
surgeries , patients will either be randomized to the DLT or VDLT group.  In 
either scenario, the DLT or VDLT will be inserted with conventional 
laryngoscopy or video -laryngoscopy  by a member of the thoracic 
anesthesia team.   Once correct placement has been thought to be 
achieved, the final position will be verified confirmed in the following ways:  
in the DLT group, final position will be verified with FOB and in the VDLT 
group, the final position will be verified with the embedded camera, 
however, at the discretion  of the anesthesiologist the FOB may be used to 
also verify final position, as long it is recorded in the chart.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1124439] demographic and clinical information from the patient's 
medical record. Demograph ic data to be collected may include such items as 
birth date and race/ethnicity. Examples of clinical information that may be 
collected at one or more time points during the study include height and weight, 
disease information (e.g., cancer site/stage), tr eatment information (e.g., type of 
surgery, postsurgical status, current medications), comorbidities, and 
performance status.  
 
 
7.0  Statistical Considerations     
The primary objective is to determine  the rate of FOB use with the  VDLT during 
surgeries requiring lung isolation and to compare to the rate of FOB use with the 
conventional DLT. The rate of FOB use with the conventional double lumen tube 
Protocol# 2014 -0991  
Version 02-22-2016  
Page 9 of 15 
 
is known to be 100%.  We plan to enroll [ADDRESS_1124440] 99% power (Scenario #1 in the table below) to 
detect the difference in the rate of FOB use between 20% for the new video 
double lumen tube arm and 99% for the conventional double lumen tube arm, 
assuming a two -sided type error rate of 0.05 (nQuery Advisor 7.0).  
 
Power calculations based on different scenarios of rate of FOB use are provided 
in the table below.  
 
Assumption: two -sided α=0.05, and the rate of FOB use with the conventional 
double lumen tube=0.99 (the software requires the rate to be les s than 1).  
 
Scenario  Rate of 
fiberoptic use 
with VDLT  power

2 0.30 99% 
3 0.40 99% 
4 0.50 99% 
5 0.60 99% 
6 0.70 96% 
7 0.80 80% 
  
Frequency counts and percentages will be  reported  for categorical variables 
(such as gender, race, device used for intubation, and incidence of malposition ). 
Summary statistics such as number of non -missing observations (N), mean, 
median, standard deviation (std. dev), and range will be  provided for continuous 
variable  (such as age, time measured in min utes from intubation to ready to 
position, and time from intubation to ready for surgical intervention ).  The rate of 
FOB use and its 95% confidence interval for the new video double lumen tube 
arm and the conventional double lumen tube arm will be calculated.  Fisher’s 
exact test or Chi -square test will be used to evaluate the difference i n the rate of 
FOB use between the two arms.  Logistic regression may be used to as sess the 
association between FOB use and other patient demographic and su rgical 
characteristics.   
Analysis results in an aggregated format will be provided to [CONTACT_811993] -Lin Guo, one 
of the study collaborators. [CONTACT_460773] will use the aggregated  information to assist 
with manuscript writing  and review .

Over 200,000 new cases of prostat e cancer (PCA) are diagnosed i n the U.S. 
annually. Over the last two decades there has been a trend towards diagnosing 
less advanced disease, but more recently with a decrease in PSA -based 
screening for PCA, there has been concern that the incidence of  metastatic 
disease will again rise. For the last 60 years androgen depriva tion therapy (ADT) 
has remained the standard treatm ent for advanced and metastatic  PCA. At this 
time, however, nearly 400,[ADDRESS_161366] plausible seems to be based  upon an imbalance 
between opposing anabolic and catabolic pat hways and cross-talk  between these 
pathways. Androgens, the growth hormone/insulin-like growth fac tor-1 (GH/IGF1) axis, 
and follistatin activate anabolic pathways. While myostatin (a negative regulator of 
muscle mass and a member of the transforming growth factor β superfamily) and 
ubiquitin ligases regulat e catabolic pathways.  
 This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_142013], loss of strength, l oss of bone density, increased adiposity, and increased 
insulin resistance and that thes e changes will correspond to hi stologic alterations in 
skeletal muscle and change in rel ative expression of anabolic and catabolic pathway 
markers.  
 
This is very relevant to our Vet erans since PCA remains one of the most commonly 
diagnosed cancers in this popula tion with profound side effects of ADT in this population 
that affect function, comorbidi ty, and quality of life (QOL).

 2.0 Introduction 
 
Over 200,000 new cases of prostat e cancer (PCA) are diagnosed i n the U.S. 
annually. Over the last two decades there has been a trend towards diagnosing less advanced disease, but more recently with a decrease in PSA -based 
screening for PCA, there has been concern that the incidence of  metastatic 
disease will again rise. For the last 60 years androgen depriva tion therapy (ADT) 
has remained the standard treatm ent for advanced and metastatic  PCA. At this 
time, however, nearly 400,[ADDRESS_161370] plausible seems to be based  upon an imbalance 
between opposing anabolic and catabolic pat hways and cross-talk  between these 
pathways. Androgens, the growth hormone/insulin-like growth fac tor-1 (GH/IGF1) axis 
and follistatin activate anabolic pathways. While myostatin (a negative regulator of 
muscle mass development and a member of the transforming growth  factor β 
superfamily) and ubiquitin ligases regulate catabolic pathways.   
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_142013], loss of strength, l oss of bone density, increased adiposity and increased 
insulin resistance and that thes e changes will correspond to hi stologic alterations in 
skeletal muscle and change in rel ative expression of anabolic and catabolic pathway 
markers.  
 
This is very relevant to our Vet erans since PCA remains one of the most commonly 
diagnosed cancers in this popula tion with profound side effects of ADT in this population 
that affect function, comor bidity, and quality of life.

Additionally, we will correlate m uscle changes with non-invasiv e testing with magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy (MRS) f or muscle energetics and optical spectroscopy (OS) for 
mitochondrial function and cell en ergetics. Data obtained in th e study will not be used 
for future research and will be used only for purposes outlined  in this protocol. 
 
4.0 Resources and Personnel  
 Work will be conducted 1) within the VA at [CONTACT_142041]’s dedica ted research 
space, at the Clinical Research Unit, and in the Urology clinic , and 2) at the 
Translational Center for Metabo lic Imaging (TCMI) located at the University of 
Washington School of Medicine. 
 [CONTACT_142041] is the PI [INVESTIGATOR_142014] p rocedures 
including recruitment, consenti ng, administering surveys, performing data 
analysis, and coordinating all regulatory activities. [CONTACT_142042] will identify and 
recruit prostate cancer patient s seen in the Urology clinic at the VA and will 
be performing the study procedures occurring there. Lab technic ians at the 
TCMI will be conducting the MRS and OS. Only VA personnel liste d here will 
have access to protected heal th information (PHI). 
 
5.0 Study Procedures   
 
5.1 Study Design 
One group will be incl uded in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]: Patients with a dvanced or 
metastatic PCA initiating treatme nt with primary ADT with a gonadotropin-
releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist. This group wil l include 60 subjects. 
  
There will be 4 study visits: 1 ) Screening, 2) Ba seline, 3) Thr ee-month visit and 
4) Six-month visit. Screening will be performed within [ADDRESS_161372]'s PHI that will be neede d for pre-
screening and recruitment for this study is as follows; full me dical history, name, 
VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 
01/17/2019
[Version 4, 1/11/19]  VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Ve rsion: 2/2015 Page 8 of 17 
 date of birth, social security  number, demographics, age, telep hone number, and 
home address. The patients that will be identified via chart review are patients of 
the VAMC Cancer Center. 
 
Review of inclusion/exclusion cr iteria and completion of inform ed consent will 
occur at the Screening visit, follo wed by [CONTACT_142019] a blood 
draw for safety laboratory measures. 
 
The following procedures will take place at the Baseline visit:  Dual-energy x-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) scan to mea sure body composition. Muscle p erformance 
as measured by [CONTACT_142020]  (HGS), stair climb power (SCP ), actigraphy, 
and 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Indirect calorimetry to measure VO [ADDRESS_161373]-Prostate. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), optical s pectroscopy 
(OS), and muscle biopsy to measure  muscular mitochondrial funct ion. Blood 
samples will be collected to assess degree of androgen deprivat ion (total and 
free testosterone).   
 
All study procedures performed at  baseline will be repeated at the 3- and 6- month 
visits with the exception of the muscle biopsy that will be performed at baseline and at the 6-month visit. Disease severity and disease progression will be assessed at each visit by [CONTACT_142021], and assessing stage, histologic g rade (Gleason score 
and pattern) metastatic volume , secondary therapy, and castrate  sensitivity status. 
Other clinical parameters to be captured will include demograph ics, comorbidities, and 
medication use. These parameters will be used as covariates in the analyses performed. Adverse events will al so be recorded at the 3- and 6 - month visits. 
 
Study procedures listed here may occur on multiple days per the  patient’s 
availability. Patient s may be exempt from completing some study  procedures due 
to physical inability from disease/treatment-rela ted symptoms. Determination of 
these exemptions will be left to  the discretion of the study personnel. 
 
Subjects' medical records will be monitored for up to 5 years to assess for the 
development of complications (tumor progression, chemo response , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517]) and for survival. 
 
Risks associated with study procedures : 
-Blood Drawing: The risks of bl ood drawing include pain, bleedi ng, and/or a 
bruise where the needle was insert ed. Serious complications suc h as blood clots 
or infection are very rare when proper precautions are taken. 
-DXA Scan: While we do not know whether any dose of radiation i s completely 
safe, this amount of radiation is  well within the limits consid ered safe by [CONTACT_142022] 
01/17/2019
[Version 4, 1/11/19]  VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Ve rsion: 2/2015 Page 9 of 17 
 and state regulations. The total amount of radiation used will be extremely 
small—approximately 0.04 milli -rem per examination or 1 milli-r em (0.001 mSv) 
total and less than one-tenth t he dose of a standard chest x-ra y, and less than a 
day's exposure to natural radi ation.  X-rays in the diagnostic range for these 
exams are expected to have no side effects. 
 
-VO2 peak: risks include abnorma l heart beats, abnormal blood p ressure 
responses, muscle cramps, muscle strain and/or joint injury, de layed muscle 
soreness (1 to 2 days afterw ards), light headedness, fatigue, a nd in rare 
instances, heart attack. This te st will be performed under the direct supervision of 
a trained physician in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l where rapid access to emerg ency personnel 
and equipment including a crash ca rt, ECG, vitals assessment is  available. 
 
-Muscle Biopsy: The risks of muscle biopsy include pain, bruising, infection, 
bleeding (including rare bleedi ng requiring further interventio n), and/or hematoma 
where the biopsy nee dle was inserted. 
 
-Loss of confidentiality: The ri sks are deemed minimal and all necessary 
precautions as required by [CONTACT_142023] R&D committee will be  taken. 
 
-Functional Performance: There is  a small risk of incurring inj ury during 
assessment of muscle performance. This risk will be minimized b y properly 
instructing the participants, and by [CONTACT_142024]. 
  
-MRS & OS: Some people may feel  claustrophobic when in the MRS or feel 
uncomfortable while remaining st ill and holding the same positi on during the session. 
This will disappear soon after getting up and walking around on ce MRS is done. There 
are no known risks to breathing more oxygen than normal for the  short periods of time 
we use in these experiments for OS. Breathing rate may speed up a little while breathing 
more oxygen than usual.  This will return to normal when the pa tient begins breathing 
standard room air. There may be discomfort when the blood press ure cuff is inflated 
including numbness or tingling, and the area under the cuff may  ache. This is often 
done by [CONTACT_142025] a nd there are not known side effects of these 
discomforts. For people who are more likely to develop blood cl ots, we do not know if 
having the pressure cuff inflat ed for several minutes at a time will further increase the 
risk of forming a blood clot. Pa tients will be given a handout wi th information about deep 
vein thrombosis. The exercise m ay induce muscular fatigue which  will disappear soon 
after exercise is stopped.  There may be some mild muscular sor eness for a day or two 
after the exercise.  This is a normal response that disappears on its own.

Fasting risks:  You may feel hungry or dizzy or have some stomach discomfort fr om 
not eating on the days you have to  fast before your visit.  If you are a frequent coffee 
drinker, you may experience discomfort or headache from not hav ing any caffeine. If 
you normally use nicotine produc ts, you may feel the effects of  not having nicotine in 
your system.  
Data and blood specimen banki ng will be done at the VAPSHCS Cac hexia 
Tissue Repository. This is a new bank under this PI.

and his team.  Patients will be id entified via chart review (pre-screening). A full 
medical history is needed to det ermine if the subject meets enr ollment criteria 
and to analyze variables that mig ht influence outcomes measured . This will 
include medical prob lems, treatments, and medications. The subj ect's private 
health information that will be n eeded for this study is as follows:  full medical 
history, name, date of birth, s ocial security number, demograph ics, age, 
telephone number, and hom e address. The PI's relationship to th e subject will be 
investigational. 
 
5.3 Informed Consent Procedures 
1-Study staff identifies potential participants from Urology clinic via medical records,  
2-Study staff reviews records to  ascertain initial inclusion/ex clusion criteria,  
3-Study staff sends list of potential subjects to clinical staf f,  
4-Clinical staff brings up potentia l research study to patient at clinical visit and asks if 
they’re interested in learning more,  
5-Study staff then speaks with pat ients to provide more informa tion,  
6-If subject is interested they sign a consent form,  7-Study procedures are initi ated (i.e. Screening visit) 
 Patients will be assur ed of the voluntary nat ure of the trial a nd a member of the 
research staff will be available  to answer all questions regard ing the study. We will 
emphasize that their decision to participate in the clinical tr ial will not affect their 
treatment.  
 
A waiver of consent is requested  for identification/pre-screening. The use or disclosure 
of PHI involves no more than minimal risk to the individuals an d the waiver will not 
adversely affect the privacy ri ghts and the welfare of the indi viduals. The risk is minimal 
because: 1) only trained personnel  will have access to this inf ormation, 2) information 
will be accessed only from our  research office at the VA and ke pt in a locked cabinet

 behind locked doors or in passwor d-protected computers and 3) o nly information 
absolutely required for resear ch will be obtained and recorded.   
 
The research could not practic ably be conducted without this wa iver and could not 
practicably be conducted withou t access to and use of the PHI b ecause accessing 
potential subjects’ medical reco rds and their last 4 digits of their SSN and name [CONTACT_142040]. 
 
All study personnel are trained r egarding human s ubjects’ protections 
requirements and how to obtain and document informed consent as  it is required 
by [CONTACT_142026]. 
 
5.4 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

 Functional performance  will be assessed as follows: HGS, SCP, 6MWT, VO [ADDRESS_161375] been shown to correlate with VO 2 
peak and are good tests of aerobic and functional capacity in c achectic states. 
HGS will be measured by a handheld dynamomet er (Jamar Hydraulic  
Dynamometer, J.A. Preston Corp., Clifton, NJ). SCP, which allow s measuring the 
maximal anaerobic power of the involved muscles, will be perfor med as follows: 
subjects will climb up ordinary stairs at the highest possible speed, according to 
their capabilities. The stairs will consist of [ADDRESS_161376] with a digital stopwatch. Anaer obic power (in 
Watts) will be calculated by [CONTACT_142028]: “(bod y mass x 9.81 x 
vertical distance)/time” where body mass, vertical distance (i. e., 1.99 m) and time 
are expressed in kg, m, and s, respectively, and 9.81 m/s2 represents the 
acceleration of gravity (2–3 prac tice trials will be allowed so  that the subjects 
gains a good control of the per forming technique). In a 6MWT, t he staff will ask 
subjects to walk for [ADDRESS_161377], participants will be instructed to put on a 
mask/mouth pi[INVESTIGATOR_111285] a breathing valve to collect expi[INVESTIGATOR_86768] s. Participants 
will be instructed to use hand sig nals to notify researchers ab out the need to stop 
the test. Participants will then be asked to pedal an exercise cycle at 
progressively harder workloads. The test will continue until th e subject becomes 
fatigued and decides to stop, or other symptoms prohibit furthe r exercise.  Fasting 
is required for  the VO [ADDRESS_161378] and tr ained research coordinators wil l demonstrate its 
use and provide subjects with instructions in person as well as  in writing. Data 
from returned monitors will be downloaded with companion softwa re and 
analyzed for activity counts, da ily steps, and estimates of ene rgy expenditure. 
 
Questionnaires:  The FACT-P, EORTC QLQ-30, and EPIC-Hormonal 
questionnaires/scales will be administered to assess changes in  symptoms that 
play a role in performa nce such as fatigue. 
 Muscle biopsy:  The purpose of the sample collection is the following: histolo gic 
analysis and measurement of inflammatory, anabolic, and catabolic markers, in addition to assessment of muscular mitochondrial function. Musc le biopsies will 
be taken from the vastus later alis. After anesthetizing the skin and muscle fascia 
with 2% lidocaine, a 1-cm incision will be made, where ~300 mg of muscle tissue

 will be removed by [CONTACT_2329] a 5mm biopsy needle.  After the proced ure is 
completed, pressure is applied fo r 5-10 minutes to establish he mostasis, the 
incision is closed with Dermabon d, and the leg is wrapped in an  ace bandage.  
Subjects are asked to remain supi[INVESTIGATOR_142015] 20 mi nutes.  Subjects’ 
blood pressure will be rechecked before allowing to stand up. Subjects will be 
given post care instructions i ncluding a telephone number in ca se of problems 
related to the procedure. 
 
Blood draw (fasted morning sample): The purpose of the samp le collection is 
the following: 60mL sample for safety labs, inflammatory/cytoki ne profile, 
anabolic markers, and anabolic and sex hormones. Blood and musc le samples 
will be stored in a -80o freezer in the PI [INVESTIGATOR_142016] r no more than [ADDRESS_161379] revokes aut horization; however, in such as case, those 
samples will be stripped of ident ifiers and no code linking subject’s identity to the 
sample will be kept.  
 
MRS & OS:  Patients’ quadriceps muscle will  be imaged using MRS while in a 
relaxed state and while contract ing at various levels of effort . MRS and OS will 
also involve non-invasive imaging during an ischemic state while wearing a 
compression cuff and during reperf usion after the cuff is relea sed.  
 
5.6 Data Analysis 
We will include 60 subjects (n=60) . This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_142017]. The data 
generated through this trial will be used to power a future, la rger clinical study 
and grant submissions. The sample  size has been estimated based  on the 
availability of subjects.  
All variables will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_142029]-parametric 
statistical methods including N, median, SEM and standard devia tion. When 
appropriate, analyses wil l be done using Kru skal-Wallis for con tinuous variables with 
Bonferroni's adjustments for mu ltiple comparisons and chi-squar ed for categorical 
variables. Appropriate transformations will be applied to the o utcome changes to 
improve distribution toward normality. The relationship between physiologic and histologic parameter s, anabolic and catabolic markers, and sarc openia will be 
established.

Full disclosure and complete description of all endpoints will be included in public 
presentations of data to avoid b ias. Safety, including adverse events, will be 
summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_19313].   
 5.7 Withdrawal of Subjects 
It is unlikely that subjects will be withdrawn without their consent. This may happen if 
regulatory authorities (VA) decide to terminate the study. Part icipation is completely 
voluntary and patient s may withdraw from this study at any time  without any negative 
consequences or penalty for study  withdrawal. To withdraw, patients will be instructed 
to advise study staff directly by [CONTACT_142032]. Subjects will not 
have the option to get the remain ing portion of their sample(s)  back. Samples will not be 
destroyed but the sample will be  kept anonymously and used for analysis.

 • shall have authority to stop a research protocol in progress, remove individual human 
subjects from a research protocol, and take whatever steps are necessary to protect the 
safety and well-being of human subjects until the IRB can asses s the monitor’s report; 
Version: 15 April 2013 Page 4 of 7   
• shall have the responsibility to promptly report their observ ations and findings to the IRB 
or other designated official and the HRPO.  
 
The study coordinators will send [CONTACT_142045] a detailed study report annually for his review. 
All AE/SAE’s will be reported to IRB by [CONTACT_142033]. 
 
 
Adverse Event Management 
Any untoward or  unfavorable event occurring following enrollmen t in the study 
and until conclusion o f the study procedures will be considered  an AE. A 
worsening of a pre-existing c ondition will be c onsidered an AE as well. A pre-
existing condition which occurs with a known temporal frequency  and severity 
(e.g., dysmenorrhea) will not be considered an AE unless the pa ttern or severity 
has changed.  
 
Seriousness: A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that resul ts in: death, 
permanent or significant disabili ty, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] a prolo ngation of an existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or is other wise medically 
alarming.  Severity: All adverse events will be rated according to the Nat ional Cancer 
Institute (NCI) Common Toxici ty Criteria (CTCAE v4.0).  
 
Relationship to Study Procedure: All AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_142034]: 
a) Temporal relationship, b) Patt ern consistent with known effect of the 
intervention, and c) Presence of  other potentia l etiologies.  A E will be assigned 
one of the following caus al relationships: a) Unrelated (The st udy procedure 
almost certainly did not cause  the event); b) Probably not rela ted (It is more likely 
that the event is due to another  etiology than due to the study procedure), c) 
Possibly related (It is equally likely that the event is due to the study procedure 
as it is due to another etiology), d) Probably related (It is m ore likely that the 
event is due to the study proc edure than due to another etiolog y) and e) 
Definitely related (the evidence is compelling that the study p rocedure caused 
the AE). 
 
Monitoring Adverse Events: Subjec ts will be monitored for the onset of AEs 
throughout the course of the study . Any ongoing AE will be assessed at

 appropriate frequency to document t he date and time of resoluti on of the event. 
All events will be followed to res olution. Certain AEs (e.g., a  cerebrovascular 
accident) will not be expected to r esolve completely; in these cases, the date and 
time will be recorded when the ev ent reaches its new, stable eq uilibrium and any 
remaining residua of the event w ill be documented. All AEs will  be followed until 
resolution or until stable in cases where permanent sequelae are expected. 
All SAE will be reported to IRB with appropriate  forms per IRB regulations (within 
5 days of study staff becoming aware), all ot her AEs will be re ported to IRB 
annually.

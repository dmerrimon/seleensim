Print Date:  23 February 2023                                 1 Clinical Trial Protocol  
1. Introduction  
Ninjamas Europe (NJ EU ) is an absorbent disposable single -use underwear pant developed for 
children suffering from nocturnal enuresis (nighttime bedwetting). The NJ EU absorbent 
underwear pant helps manage and contain urination gushes at night for up to [ADDRESS_320429] skin. It is a simple non -active device (without electronics or batteries) that is 
very easy to use. No specific traini ng is required to use this product. It is available in 2 sizes: 
Size 7 for children aged 4 -7 (17-29 kg) and Size 8 for children aged 8 -12 years  (27-43kg).  
Since nocturnal enuresis in the age group [ADDRESS_320430] option  only: 
 
• Absorbent underwear to manage urine loss without treating it.  
• Bed mats absorb urine and prevent the mattress from getting wet but do not keep  the 
child’s clothing and bed sheets  from getting wet.  
• Fluid and diet restriction  prior to bedtime . 
• Waking the child at specific times during the night  to go to the bathroom . 
• Bladder training or retention control training, where the child is trained to hold the urine 
as long as possible  in order to increase bladder capacity.   
• Rewards and star charts  to encourage nights without bedwetting . 
• Wetness alarms (bells or vibration s that wake the child when urinating ). 
• Desmopressin  (synthetic version of anti -diuretic hormone) . 
• Anticholinergic medic ine (e.g., Oxybutynin ) reduces the number of involuntary bladder 
contractions and has a relaxant effect on the smooth muscle of the bladder. This 
decreases the urge to pass urine and  allows the bladder to hold more urine.  
• Tricyclic drugs - work the same as Oxybutynin but are on ly used in case s where other 
drugs are not working. The need for close follow up and the potential for serious cardiac 
consequences with overdose mean they are considered for use in specialist cent ers 
only.  
• Psychological tre atment . 
 
The P&G company  has a 20+ year history of baby [CONTACT_263457] (0 -36 months) to show that 
our diaper and pant technology is safe to use and effective for managing urine gushes in a baby 
[CONTACT_263458] . The P&G company also has adult (18+ years) female incontinence 
products in the EU market , including absorbent heavy incontinence pants, that are classified as 
Class 1 Medical Devices, which were demonstrated to be safe to use and effectively manages 
urine gushes of adults  as seen in the statement of compliance from th e CER report  dated Feb 
2020  [1]. Since Aug 2020 t he P&G company markets  a similar Ninjamas night -time pant product 
in the [LOCATION_003] for bedwetting children aged 4 -12 years. (Same age group and intended use as NJ EU 
product) and  P&G markets a training pant (Baby[CONTACT_263459] S7) in the EU . Based on the P ost Market 
Safety Surveillance data of similar products in the EU und  US market (Baby[CONTACT_263459], FemCare 
AI Pants, NJ US pants ), we have reason to believe that the NJ EU product will have no safety

Print Date:  23 February 2023                                 2 related issues when used as an overnight pant for children aged 4 -12 years, based on skin and 
health related AEs. [2]  
 
Although  the design of the P&G Adult Incontinence pull-up pants and the pull-up pants for babies 
and toddlers are  comparable to that of the NJ EU  Pull-up pant for bedwetting children , and there 
is a reason to believe that the NJ EU pull up  pant meet s all safety and product performance 
requirements , P&G currently has no  clinical evidence to support the  product safety and efficacy 
for the population of children aged 4-12 years . This clinical trial provides helpful technical data to 
bridge to the existin g body of evidence clinical data from adult and baby [CONTACT_263460] -use data for this specific population of children, with a different gush volume than 
adults and babies and using the products only during night.  
 
Looking at the prevalence of nocturnal enuresis, this condition is more likely among younger 
children ( size 7 , or S7 , which is designed for children aged 4 -7) than older children (size 8 , or S8 , 
which is designed for children aged 8 -12). The graphs below show data from publications on 
nocturnal enuresis for [LOCATION_006] [3] and [LOCATION_003] [4] respectively.  
 
Figure 1 & 2: Prevalence of Nocturnal Enuresis for [LOCATION_006] [1] and [LOCATION_003] [2].  
 
 
 
This clinical trial  will therefore focus on the more representative S7 g roup. Reasons for choosing 
this group  include :  
 
1. This group will be easier to recruit with approximately 10-25% of the population 
suffering from nocturnal enuresis at age 4 -7, compared to only 1 -5% of the 
population at age [ADDRESS_320431] the same design, with S8 ha ving a more 
abso rbent capacity and a bigger fit.   
 
4. P&G consumer s tudies (see tables below) show that there is no significant 
difference in nightly urine production comparing children in the S7 group vs . the 
S8 group. This means that the lower capacity S7 pant will be likely to be more 
wet than the S8 pant under the same load  conditions .

on the skin (which is an irritant for the skin)  as they are not well -practiced in 
wipi[INVESTIGATOR_263433]. Therefore, the S7 group has 
more risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_263434] S8 group, because their 
skin is wet longer and any feces rest ing on the skin can result in compromised 
skin and  rash in the pant area .    
 
Our focus will be on children with monosymptomatic enuresis  i.e., enuresis in children without any 
other lower urinary tract symptoms ( e.g., increased frequency, daytime incontinence, urgency, 
genital,  or lower urinary tract pain) and without a history of bladder dysfunction.  
 
This clinical trial  will accept children with both primary and secondary enuresis. Primary enuresis 
means the child has  never had a dry period at night . Secondary enuresis mean s the child 
developed nocturnal enures is after being dry for a period of at least six months.  
 
This clinical trial will be a [ADDRESS_320435] on skin of the NJ EU pant compared to the child’s currently used absorbent pant or

3. Investigational Plan  
3.1 Clinical Trial Desig n 
This will be a single center, single blinded  (sponsor’s team will be blinded to the product codes) , 
randomized, cross -over, IRB-Approved, in-home clinical test design over 6 weeks, with two usage 
periods of 3 weeks each. During one period the child will maintain usage of their usual absorbent 
night p ant/diaper  and during the other usage period they will use the NJ EU  absorbent pant. We 
will track habits and practices that may impact skin health and product performance as well as 
medication use and Adverse Events/ Adverse Device Effects  (AEs /ADEs ). Children will be asked 
to wear either their own pants or the test pants exclusively at night and parent/legal guardian  will 
be asked to collect  data in the evening before bed and in the mornings after getti ng up .   
 
Parent /Legal Guardian  will be trained to execute the measurements on their own child for the   
following reasons : 
 
1. Children this age are usually told not to let strangers touch them in the genital and 
buttock area, so we want to avoid telling kids it is OK in this case. We will ensure that the 
child is comfortable to participate in this clinical trial and can at any ti me end the ir 
participation in this clinical  trial should  they feel uncomfortable.  
 
2. Due to COVID restrictions , clinical trial  person nel should minimize  close contact [CONTACT_263462], especially with children under 5 years of age , who can not 
be vaccinated. We will therefore ask the trained parent /legal guardian  to do the 
measurements on his/her own child/ren. Children can stop the study procedures at any 
time if/when they feel uncomfortable.  
This clinical trial is designed to track the following:  
• general safety (AEs and ADEs),  
• assess skin properties in the pant area (parental assessment of skin wetness, rash, 
pressure marks , pH and Trans Epi[INVESTIGATOR_7024]  (TEWL)  and child perception of skin 
irritation and wetness  
• assess fit and performance  of the overnight pant products  (fit images , leaks, product 
defects )

Print Date:  23 February 2023                                 5 • Quality  of Life ( QoL) information of parent/legal guardian and child after each product 
usage period.  
             The following table shows which endpoints will be measured at which time and where on the child:

• Leaking and Pant Fit: Mobile phone images of the pant on the child will be collected by [CONTACT_31588]/legal guardian at home using their mobile device and the MyBaby[CONTACT_263463]. Expert 
graders will evaluate pant fit from these collected images.  
 
• Child Perception: Child will be asked simple yes/ no questions to determine if they feel 
irritation or wetness . If yes, the parent/legal guardian will ask the child to point to location 
where they feel the irritation or wetness . 
 
• Parental Skin Perception : Parent/ legal guardian  will be trained to assess rash, skin 
pressure marks and skin wetness  in the pant area . 
 
• Skin barrier integrity will be measured by [CONTACT_263464]/legal guardian who will be asked 
to measure the child’s skin pH and TEWL values in pant area using provided portable pH 
and gpskin devices. TEWL and pH are generally taken at several points in the pant area  in 
to determine conditions over the entire  area of the pant. The supra -pubic area is expected 
to be exposed to more wetness, as this site is closest to the urination point. However, when 
the children sleep on the ir back, the urine runs to the back and the buttocks can become 
wet. So, it will be ve ry important to determine the sleep position of the kids and measure 
skin barrier integrity of front and back areas . 
 
Up to 30 children (approximate  split of 15  males  and 15 females) who meet inclusion /exclusion  
criteria will be enrolled  in the clinical tr ial. S7 children  will be enrolled in this clinical trial  because 
nocturnal enuresis is most prevalen t in children aged [ADDRESS_320439] will be randomized. Parents will

(no test wipes will be provided) . 
If a subject drops out of the clinical trial , they will not be replaced, due to the short duration of the 
clinical trial . 
 
Once  qualified , parent /legal guardian  will be asked to pi[INVESTIGATOR_263435] (pH meter  set, gpskin  
device , scale,  and selfie light)  from North  Cliff Consultants .  They will receive training on how to 
handle the equipment and how to complete the questionnaires . Parent/legal guardian  will be 
required to begin with the clinical trial  after the training session . They will be given 2 days to practice 
with the instruments and MyBaby[CONTACT_263465].  
 
Parent /legal guardian  will be instructed  to complete a digital questionnaire  twice  daily (once in the 
morning  befor e removing the used pant and once in the evening  when applying the fresh pant) via 
MyBaby[CONTACT_263463]. This will include taking four photos  of the child wearing the pant (front , back and 
both hips) and measuring pH and gpskin  values in four areas ( upper thigh, hip, suprapubic area , 
and central buttock area) . It includes capturing adverse events and compliance questions. 
Subjects  will also be asked to complete a H&P  questionnaire at the clinical trial  start and at the 
end of each 3-week period and they will also be asked to complete an after-use questionnaire.    
 
This clinical trial  will be submitted for IRB/ethics review .  
 
3.2 Clinical Trial Procedure s 
 
3.2.1 Visit  1 – Enrollment  and Training (on Site)  
 
1. On the day of their appointment , a parent /legal guardian  will be asked to come to 
the clinical site together with their participating child.  
 
2. Parent/legal guardian  will be instructed  to read the Informed Consent document 
but not si gn until they meet with clinical personne l. They will be given the 
oppo rtunity to have any questions answered.  They will be asked to sign two 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_263436] . After 
verification of a legible signature,  the parent/ legal guardian will be instructed to 
keep one signed copy of the Informed Consent.  The c linical site will keep the 
other copy.  
 
3. Parent/legal guardian will be asked for demographic information  and inclusion/  
exclusion criteria to determine if their child is eligible to participate in the clinical 
trial.  Children will be weighed on a bathroom scale  and have their body length , 
waist circumference  (lying down and standing) , thigh circumference and hip 
circumfere nce measured by [CONTACT_263466] a clinical staff 
member. The participating c hild must be present, so clinical personnel  can verify 
the age , weight, Fitzpat rick scale and general health of the child. The child will 
also be asked to try o n one of the overnight test pants to ensure proper fit. If 
eligible , parent/legal guardian will be asked about the typi[INVESTIGATOR_263437] s 
of their child during  the My Baby[CONTACT_263467]  (see Attachment C) . 
 
4. The subjects  will be asked to bring along a packet of their current ly used overnight 
pant product so the test site can verify that this product brand qualifies as one of 
the allowed “own product brands” (current marketed disposable or reusable

days .  
- Once in the evening when applying the fresh night  pant 
- Once in the morning when removing the used pant  
 
2. In the evenings they will be asked to apply a fresh pant and wait ~15 minutes, 
before doing images, measurements , and skin assessments. In the mornings, 
they will be asked to take the images before they remove the pant and then 
remove the pant to do skin a ssessments. Approx. 5 minutes after removing the 
pant, they will be instructed to take the pH and gpskin measurements .

wetness,  rash, and pressure marks , enter pant wear time and weight, assess 
leaking , and take images of the pant fit on the child  in standing position . If the 
overnight pant did l eak, they will be asked to take an image of the wet stain on 
the p ajama pant  in the crotch area as well as front, back or sides in  a standing  
position , so we can see the location and size of the leak.  
 
5. To dimension the size of the stain, they will be a sked to put a provided sticker 
with known diameter on the p ajama pant. For determining the level of gappi[INVESTIGATOR_263438] , the parent/legal guardian will make a mark  5 
cm above the navel with a surgical marker and at the same height at t he sides 
and back to determine how much the pant sagged overnight. A provided sticker 
with known diameter will be applied to the pant to determine the amount of 
sagging that occurred .  
 
6. Parents/legal guardian will be asked to calibrate the pH meter and gpskin device 
once a week to ensure it is working properly. The  test site will calibrate the 
instruments on the day they are handed out to the parent /legal guardian  and

calibration  once a week In the MyBaby[CONTACT_263471] .  
 
7. Subjects will receive two pH meters at the start of the clinical trial. The parent/ 
legal guardian will be instructed to use only one of the pH m eters for the study. I f 
this pH meter gets broken, cracked or is not calibrating anymore, the 
parent/legal guardian will be instructed to use the backup pH meter provided to 
them. Should this occur, the parent/legal guardian should inform the study site 
via a comment in the MyBaby[CONTACT_263472]. In case the gpskin device 
should be broken or defective, they will be asked to contact [CONTACT_263473] a replacement device asap .

The TEWL and Stratum Corneum Hydration (SCH) measurements will be taken with a gpskin  
Barrier Pro device from gpower Inc. of Korea. The child will be standing up while 
measurements are taken. These measurements will be taken for 10 seconds with data being 
displayed  on the Smartphone app to give a mean TEWL value (g/m2/hr) and a mean SCH 
value (arbitrary units). The values will be recorded in the MyBaby[CONTACT_263479]. Measurements will 
be taken at the thigh ( uncovered control), hip, supra pubis  (genital)  and central  buttocks.

3.7.6  Photos  (Attachment  E, F & G) 
Photo images will be taken by [CONTACT_7078] /legal guardian  to collect images of the pant fit using the 
MyBaby[CONTACT_263480] . A skin mark will be made 5 cm above the center of 
the navel  and skin marks will be made at the same height on the back and at the sides (above 
hips).  The child will be asked to stand up with legs slightly apa rt (front and back images) and  
using the provided illuminated selfie light.  For the hip images the child will stand upright and 
will bend the leg closest to the camera at a 90° angle, so one can see if there are gaps at the 
leg cuffs.   
 
Parent/legal guardi an will also be asked to take an image of wet stains in the pajama pant, so 
we can determine where the leak happened and how big the stain was. Images should be 
taken of the pant on the child in the crotch area, front, back or sides, depending on where the  
stain is.  
 
Photos will be stored without personally identifiable information and in such a manner as to 
restrict access through password protection.  For example, the mobile phone used to take the 
photos will not store the photos on the photo roll or clou d, but they will be stored inside the 
password protected app. Parent/legal guardian will submit photos at the end of each 
questionnaire into a limited -access P&G  database via encoded transfer. The folder used to 
house the photos on the sponsor’s drive will have limited access. Access to this drive is granted

7.5  Adverse Events  or Adverse Device Effects  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable and unexpected medical occurrence in a 
subject.  An Adverse Device Effect (ADE) is defined as any AE related to the use of the 
investigational medical device. This definition includes AEs resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, any malfunction, use error or intentional misuse of the medical 
device. Each day  (following the initial visit), the parent/ legal guardian will be asked if there has 
been any change in the child’s health (illness or injury) since the previous visit  or the previous time 
the questionnaire was filled in . Changes in health will be documented a s an AE or ADE as 
appropriate, regardless of the causality relationship with product use. All AEs and ADEs will be 
followed to resolution.  
 
7.5.[ADDRESS_320453] Reporting  
In the MyBaby[CONTACT_263463], the parent /legal guardian will be asked twice daily about their 
child’s health and medication intake.   Based on the information provided, Sponsor and 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_263451] p arent /legal guardian  for more  information. Such an 
occurrence does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with product use. 
Due to the nature of this clinical trial , skin irritation in the pant area (diaper rash)  will not 
be documented as an Adverse Event or Adverse Device Effect given it is one of the 
end point s of interest for the clinical trial . However, if a skin reaction occurs in the pant 
area which causes the parent /legal guardian  to seek medical attention,  outside the 
normal follow -up given to the child within the clinical trial , this will be documented and 
followed in the same manner as other Adverse Events  or Adverse Device Effects .  
The Investigator or designee will review each Adverse Event Report and c omplete the 
form based on the following decision charts :

The Investigator or designee will review each Adverse Event Report and complete the 
form based on the following  definitions:  
 
  Severity : 
o Mild - normal activities unaltered, AE or ADE is annoying, but tolerable  
o Moderate - normal activities altered or AE or ADE requires intervention  
o Severe - unable to undertake normal activities or is incapacitated  
 
  Investigator's Opi[INVESTIGATOR_263452] : 
o Not Related - there is no medical evidence to suggest that the AE or ADE may be  
related to product usage  
o Doubtful – there is no medical evidence to suggest that the AE or ADE may be related 
to product usage, or there is  another more probable medical explanation

The P&G company has a 20+ year history of baby [CONTACT_263457] (0 -36 months) to show that our diaper and 
pant technology is safe to use and effective for managing urine gushes in a baby [CONTACT_263458]. The P&G 
company also has adult (18+ years ) female incontinence products in the EU market, including absorbent heavy 
incontinence pants, that are classified as Class 1 Medical Devices, which were demonstrated to be safe to use and 
effectively manages urine gushes of adults as seen in the statement  of compliance from the CER report dated Feb 
2020 [1]. Since Aug 2020 the P&G company markets a similar Ninjamas night -time pant product in the [LOCATION_003] for 
bedwetting children aged 4 -12 years. (Same age group and intended use as NJ EU product) and  P&G markets a 
training pant (Baby[CONTACT_263459] S7) in the EU. Based on the Post Market Safety Surveillance data of similar products 
in the EU und US market (Baby[CONTACT_263459], FemCare AI Pants, NJ US pants ), we have reason to believe that the NJ 
EU product will have no safety  related issues when used as an overnight pant for children aged 4 -12 years, based 
on skin and health related AEs. [2]  
 
 
Based on our current knowledge about th is product  and similar marketed products , we conclude the following  
statement, which will be up dated based on the outcome of this clinical trial : 
 
Statement of Compliance for Children’s Nocturnal Enuresis Devices  
It is understood that similarity between intended use and indications for use exists between the Procter & 
Gamble Children’s Nocturnal Enu resis Devices and competitor products. Such devices serve as 
morphotypes. Procter & Gamble Children’s Nocturnal Enuresis Devices when used under the conditions and 
for the purposes intended, will not compromise the clinical condition or the safety of patie nts, or the safety 
and health of users or, where applicable other persons. The benefit of Procter & Gamble Children’s Nocturnal 
Enuresis Devices outweighs the risks associated with the product.  
 
Clinical risk identified in risk management has been adequat ely addressed for use in this clinical trial. This 
risk associated with the product is very minimal compared to the benefits of the product. Clinical investigation 
performed on similar Procter & Gamble pull-up pants identified no serious adverse events and no 
withdrawals due to adverse events. Procter and Gamble pull-up pants were well tolerated by [CONTACT_263490] -related adverse events.  
 
Procter & Gamble Children’s Nocturn al Enuresis Devices are very simple devices  and easy to use. No 
specific training is required to use this product. There is full consistency between current knowledge/ the 
state of the art, the available clinical data, the information materials supplied by  [CONTACT_3455], and the 
risk management documentation for Procter & Gamble Adult Children’s Nocturnal Enuresis Devices.  
 
  
As with any absorbent pant or diaper, it is possible in exceptional cases that these products may cause skin 
reactions like rednes s, blisters,  or sores. These skin reactions are usually temporary and usually need  no medical 
treatment, nor are they dangerous to the health. The risk of allergies cannot be totally excluded but can be 
considered very unlikely for these products. For subjects in this clinical trial , we do not expect any further risks 
apart from potential skin reactions (like redness). In case your child has some skin reactions (redness, swelling or 
blisters) during this test  that concerns you , please contact [CONTACT_46685] t rial personnel .

For the twice daily questionnaire, the parent/legal guardian will be asked to touch the child's skin in the pant area. 
Parent/legal guardian will be instructed to wash their hands before and after for hygienic reasons.   
 
The selfie light should only be use d to assist parent/legal guardian when taking images.  When using selfie lights, 
parent/legal guardian are instructed not to shine the light in the eyes of babies and pets.  
 
Parent/legal guardian will be asked to use a pH meter to measure skin pH and a gps kin device to measure skin 
hydration. The pH meter is made of glass and can break. Parent/legal guardian will be asked to take precautions 
when using the instrument to avoid the risk of glass breakage and not to use a broken device .  
 
Parent/legal guardian  will receive training on how to use th ese measuring  devices  correctly. They will be asked to  
ensure all instruments are switched off when not in use. These devices are not toys  and should only be handled by 
[CONTACT_107119] . Parent/legal guardian will be reminded  to keep these devices out of the reach of children and pets. In 
addition, the associated chemicals (storage solution and buffer solutions) should be kept in a safe place. These 
solutions are not dangerous when swallowed.   
 
In case the instruments get contaminated or dirty , parent should  wipe with a provided alcohol wipe . They should not 
immerse any devices in water or rinse under running water.  Parent/legal guardian will be instructed to disinfect all 
devices after use with an alcohol w ipe to prevent bacterial growth.

Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
Study Populations  
The Intent -to-treat (ITT) population is defined as all subjects who experienced the application of the 
assigned study product. The Per Protocol (PP) population includes subjects in the ITT population who 
have no serious inclusion/exclusion violations, no s erious continuance criteria violations, no serious 
concomitant medication violations, and high study product compliance. The ITT population will be used 
for the safety  analysis. Analyses of the Per Protocol population will be done to better understand the 
data.  
  
Prior to the statistical analysis, all data will be checked for accuracy, completeness, and compliance to 
the study protocol. Subject evaluations will be checked for compliance to the study protocol regimen and 
subjects will be assessed for compliance to the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Additionally, 
investigator comments will be assessed for extraneous factors that could affect the usefulness of the 
subject’s data.  Non -evaluable observations and the rat ionale, along with the method for handling the 
observations will be documented by [CONTACT_263491].  
 
Period and carryover effects will be evaluated for potential influence on the results.  Means will be plotted 
by [CONTACT_263492].  
  
Summary descriptive statistics will be provided for all parameters. Ninety -five percent confidence 
intervals (CIs) will be constructed for all clinical assessments for each treatment code. Any data reported 
as ‘unable to evaluate’ wi ll be treated as missing and excluded from the analysis.  
 
The methods used for the analysis will include but not be limited to a variety of parametric and non -
parametric statistical methods based on the distribution/characterization of the data.  
 
The follo wing endpoints will be investigated.  
 
General Safety:  
 
1. ADE (adverse device effect) and AE (adverse event) tracking twice daily via a safety in -
use diary. We will list a summary of the product related ADE and AEs for both treatment 
periods and  the PI, Sub -PI, Statistician and Clinical Scientist will make a recommendation 
whether the product safety of Ninjamas is comparable to current product based on the 
medical and clinical evidence of the reported AE and ADE data.   
Product Fit and Performance:  
 
2. Product performance in terms of urine leaking (yes/no). We will calculate the p ercentage 
of leaks from loaded pants only. When comparing both products, Ninjama EU option 
should not be more than 2%  worse than current product).   
 
3. Product or material defects that can lead to product failure or safety risks. All product 
defects will be summarized and categorized as potential reason for product failure (leaks) 
or safety risk .   
 
4. Pant fit images will be investigated by [CONTACT_263493] 
(e.g., applied wrong way) and to see how well the overnight pant (wet or dry) is staying in 
Clinical Investigational Plan  CSD2021096  Confidential                                          Final Version   
 
 
Print Date:  [ADDRESS_320461]. We will identify if sagging or gappi[INVESTIGATOR_263453] a bad fit led to 
skin irritation or severe pressure marking .  
 
5. Images of the  wet stain on the overnight pajama pant will help identify the size of the stain 
and where the pant was leaking. This will be compared with the pant fit images.   
 
Skin Health  
 
6. Parental skin rash perception (none/mild/moderate/severe) . We will calculate the 
cumulative  number  of moderate and severe  scores on a weekly basis. When comparing 
both products, the Ninjama EU option should not be more than 2% worse than current 
product on moderate and severe scores. W e expect to see carry -over effects in week one 
of each usage period . 
 
7. Parental overall skin health condition (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor). We will 
calculate the cumulative number  of fair and poor scores on a weekly basis. When 
comparing both pr oducts, the Ninjama EU option should not be more than 2% worse than 
current product on fair and poor scores. We expect to see carry -over effects in week one 
of each usage period.  
 
8. Skin barrier integrity, via skin pH and TEWL m easurements taken by [CONTACT_263494] 5 minutes after overnight pant removal (Thigh, hip, 
sura-pubic, buttock). Each site will be investigated separately. We will plot  individual pH 
and TEWL graphs over time and calculate the weekly average  for each panelist. We 
expect to see carry over effects in week 1 of each period.  
 
9. Parental skin dryness perception (acceptable wetness / not acceptable wetness). We will 
calculate the p ercentage of unacceptable wetness scores from loaded pants. When 
compa ring both products, Ninjama EU option should not be more than 2% worse than 
current product).  
 
10. Skin irritation perception from child (burning/itching/ stinging/tingling/feeling of heat). We 
will calculate the cumulative number  of skin irritation scores on a weekly basis. When 
comparing both products, Ninjama EU option should not be more than 2% worse than 
current product on moderate and severe scores. We expect to see carry -over effects in 
week 1 of each usage period . 
 
11. Parental pressure mark perception on skin (none/mild/ moderate/ severe). We expect the 
belt design of the NJ EU pant to have more pressure marks than other overnight pants to 
ensure a better fit. We will calculate the cumulative number  of severe pressure mark 
scores over 3 weeks . When comparing both products, Ninjama EU option should not be 
more than 2% worse than current product in terms of severe pressure marks).  
 
Quality of Life  
 
12. Use QoL measures at the end of each usage period for potential claims. QoL data will be 
summarized  as an average for all subjects after each usage period and the Ninjama EU 
product will be compared with usual product used.

CSD2021096/ NCCI #12 -2103  
OVERNIGHT PANT SAFETY -IN-USE DIARY CLINICAL TRIAL FOR CHILDREN WITH NOCTERNAL 
ENURESIS  
 
Rationale for amendment : 
1. Correction of mistake in exclusion criteria. List of medication examples are mentioned in EXCL 2, but 
should be listed in EXCL 3.   
2. Clarification of blinding of sponsor. Blinding of the sponsor representatives w ill be very difficult, due to 
the diary question about what product they used and the photos. Therefore the CTMs and DM cannot be 
fully blinded when they download the data, but all attempts will be made to blind the statistician and 
clinical scientist unti l after the database was locked. Also data for the evaluability meeting will be blinded 
by [CONTACT_263495].  
3. Include stratification criteria into the protocol.  
4. Update the number of subjects enrolled to 32 instead of 30.

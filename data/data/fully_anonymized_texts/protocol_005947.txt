Protocol version date 04/19/2021   1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY 1.1 SYNOPSIS Title: Acute effects of medium chain triglyceride (MCT) nutritional ketosis on Parkinson’s Disease (PD) symptoms and biomarkers (MCT-PD)  Study Description: While three pi[INVESTIGATOR_316173] (KD) in PD have shown either reduction in motor scores (UPDRS) or improved memory/fluency cognitive testing, there are gaps in knowledge of the time course and mechanisms of reported outcomes.  Furthermore, only a standard ketogenic diet was studied while there are variations such as MCT oil supplementation shown to increase keto-induction, and other adaptations may improve tolerability and micronutrient content. It is the goal of this proposed inpatient metabolic study to address the initial question of effect size and time course of ketosis. If suggestive of benefit in PD, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_316174] a subsequent larger study of long-term feasibility and effects on disease biomarkers and disease progression, which might also compare alternate diets of interest in PD such as Mediterranean diet. Thus, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_316175], targeting retention rate >80% and adherence in the outpatient setting. Recruitment of 32 participants is based upon power analysis of secondary outcome, testing the Timed Up & Go mobility test that has reported validity in fall prediction, additionally plotting continuous and serially repeated direct/indirect ketosis measurements and motor as well as non-motor symptoms / exploratory disease biomarkers. It is hypothesized that, compared to a non-ketogenic, standard American diet (SAD, also referred to interchangeably as usual diet, see Section 2.1 table for description), ketogenic diet supplemented by [CONTACT_316243] (MCT-KD) will improve mobility tested by [CONTACT_316244] & Go (TUG), as well as akinesia, tremor, and memory/executive function tasks, and will reduce motor and non-motor fluctuations within the acute period of keto-induction and early ketogenic timepoints due to improved mitochondrial function and neurotransmitter signaling.     Objectives:  The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that nutritional ketosis (NK) supplemented by [CONTACT_316245] a PD cohort (MCT-KD) is feasible for a duration of three weeks. The secondary objective is to show that NK improves PD symptomatology in cognition (improved attention, recall, and executive function), mobility (TUG), and motor function (bradykinesia, akinesia and tremor) within three weeks.       Outcomes: The primary outcome is feasibility, as determined by a composite outcome of recruitment and retention, acceptability and adherence, including full recruitment to study target of 32 participants; completion rate >80% in both inpatient 1-week and outpatient 2-week segments; adherence in the outpatient segment of estimated low carbohydrate diet <10% mean total

Protocol version date 04/19/[ADDRESS_389204] been reported. They showed either reduction in UPDRS, particularly non motor greater than motor scores (Van Itallie 2005, Phillips 2018), or improved cognition (Krikorian 2019). These studies all had limitations, in part related to pi[INVESTIGATOR_316179], with gaps or deficiencies identified in the following: monitoring for adherence and reliability of the intervention; degree of ketosis attained; frequency of testing for ketosis; frequency of outcome assessment to obtain adequate signal : noise ratio with respect to biological fluctuations in the disease; reliability of UPDRS rating scale used as primary outcome for small cohort groups; lack of quantitative testing of cognitive and motor functions in the same cohort for comparison; lack of testing for disease mechanism engaged that might account for the proposed benefits. VanItallie et al reported results of an unblinded, at-home ketogenic diet for [ADDRESS_389205] UPDRS scores of 5 individuals with PD (from 7 with 2 dropouts), 4/5 with Hoehn & Yahr stage 3, who had varying degrees of ketosis mostly high therapeutic range of beta-OHB levels reported (4.8 – 8.9 mM) and one outlier range 1.13 – 1.56 mM). All five participants had decline in total UPDRS score, mostly (4/5 participants) being 21-46% from baseline.  There were clear study limitations of placebo effect in study lacking a control group; lack of rater blinding and placebo control; lack of reliable ketosis monitoring aside from infrequent (unreported frequency) serum betaOHB, whereas daily ketone measurement was only urine dipstick and therefore qualitative; lack of monitoring of the diet relying primarily upon self-report via telephone and intermittent patient visits to the dietician; limited study size, and strict 4:[ADDRESS_389206] ketogenic diet regimen with 2 drop outs of 7 participants and additional 2/5 remaining participants with reported dietary relapse.   Phillips et al addressed some of these issues by [CONTACT_316249], a comparatively less stringent ketogenic diet vs. a low-fat diet prescribed by [CONTACT_316250], each with approximately 18% protein and either 79% lipid / 3.7% net carb (KD) or 23% lipid / 59% net carb (low-fat diet), the latter also with greater dietary fiber, stratified by [CONTACT_316251], for longer duration (8 weeks) and checking for ketosis monitoring by [CONTACT_49114] (AM fasting) beta-OHB levels by a validated fingerstick ketone meter as well as monitoring adherence through daily ticking of meal plans that were outlined for the entire study period. However, this study also had some limitations including infrequent data capture and diet monitoring relying upon self-report, precluding correlative analysis between ketosis value and clinical rating scale (UPDRS) performed only pre vs. post intervention. Another possible limitation was  mean beta OHB level being only 1.19 in the KD group, if greater degree of ketosis might be beneficial.  Krikorian et al evaluated another less stringent ketogenic diet in a PD cohort with mild cognitive impairment (unlimited protein, <20g carb target), recognizing that impaired glucose tolerance / metabolic syndrome is a risk factor for higher comorbidity in PD than in the general population, and that the literature supports ketogenic diet as a therapy specifically for metabolic syndrome (Hyde et al, 2019). They similarly used pre vs. post intervention data capture of 8 weeks duration, assessing cognition as well as UPDRS, and the dietary manipulation of only carbohydrate may provide a more feasible approach with lower level of change required for participants, however even the less prescriptive guidelines were not exactly adhered to. They followed 10 subjects in KD group vs. 7 in low-fat group, however they reported low level ketosis (mean beta-OHB 0.31 mM by [CONTACT_316252] 8) in the low carbohydrate group and mean carb daily intake of 36g (above 20g) in that group. Dietary monitoring was done by [CONTACT_316253]-day diaries in each study week. Interestingly, despi[INVESTIGATOR_316180]-term memory and verbal fluency in the KD group compared to the high

Protocol version date 04/19/2021 carbohydrate diet despi[INVESTIGATOR_316181]-III or finger tappi[INVESTIGATOR_231391], which raises the question of does ketosis matter for symptom improvement (whether cognitive or motor) in PD, as opposed to effects of lipid, carbohydrate or protein metabolism, such as improved insulin sensitivity / insulin brain signaling and increased BDNF expression, benefits attributed to ketogenic diet (please refer to Section 3.2.1 for details) but not specific to it. The question of macronutrient ratio contribution to the cognitive benefit in the study was not tested, and such comparison was not available given that all three macronutrient groups varied proportionally between the two groups. For instance, mean protein intake, which was not controlled, was higher in the low carbohydrate group (123 g vs. 89 g in the high carbohydrate group). Lack of controlling for protein intake appears to be a confounding issue for Parkinson’s studies given the results confirmed in multiple studies of levodopa absorption being affected by [CONTACT_217643], for instance large neutral amino acid L-leucine decreased intestinal absorption of levodopa by ~50% in healthy subjects (Lennernäs et al, 1993), which is meaningful particularly in moderate to advanced PD where dopamine-responsive fluctuations occur coupled with the pharmacokinetics of levodopa concentrations, and a single load of 0.4 g protein / kg body weight diminished response of levodopa in PD patients with motor fluctuations (Mena and Cotzias 1975; Nutt et al 1984; Juncus et al 1987; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_316182] 1987).    These limitations form the primary impetus behind the current study. The inpatient design is well suited for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_8688], as it offers advantages in providing optimal adherence monitoring and generation of a time series through frequent ketosis values compared to symptom monitoring including repeated clinical, physiology, and cognitive tests that would be more difficult or simply not feasible in the outpatient setting. The overall goal is to test metabolic measures of a standard ketogenic diet with MCT oil supplement in an effort to improve upon feasibility issues identified in the other studies. A corollary objective is to test the effects of ketosis on symptom measures by [CONTACT_316254]-KD to a standard, American diet. The following table outlines macronutrient composition of diets proposed for study (italicized) and other diets with available data on ketogenesis or use in PD. While the proposed KD matches others such as Phillips et al in proportion of energy supply from lipi[INVESTIGATOR_316183] 80%, the addition of MCT supplement to replace a portion of the 80% lipi[INVESTIGATOR_316184] a useful adaptation, similar to a study in healthy volunteers that showed more rapid keto-induction and less keto-induction symptoms (Harvey et al, 2019) in order to better and more expeditiously achieve the primary objective of ketosis feasibility.

MCT-KD remains unexplored in PD, particularly as synergistic therapy. In this clinical study, an inpatient pi[INVESTIGATOR_316186] a carbohydrate-restricted ketogenic diet supplemented by [CONTACT_316257] a standard non-ketogenic, low fat diet (SAD), within the keto-induction period and shortly thereafter over one week, on brain network connectivity via EEG cortico-cortical connectivity and motor waveform characteristics, motor physiology and clinical scale (UPDRS), cognition, autonomic function (heart rate variability, orthostatic blood pressure) and symptoms of PD with fingerstick beta-OHB levels and respi[INVESTIGATOR_17864] (RER) in the Metabolic Unit +/- continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to establish which, if any, PD symptoms may be modulated by [CONTACT_316258], to inform subsequent study into symptomatic benefit and/or disease modification. To better address the primary aim of diet feasibility, a two-week outpatient segment is proposed to assess more long-term effects of a similar ketogenic diet and further estimate adherence using an online, web-based application.  2.2 Background  Sporadic PD is clearly a complex, multifactorial disorder. Several lines of evidence converge on mitochondrial insufficiency as a key factor in the pathophysiology of sporadic PD. Mitochondrial electron transport chain genes are downregulated in PD and incidental Lewy Body Disease (iLBD) at post-mortem, particularly those activated by [CONTACT_316259]1alpha (Zheng et al, 2010). Genetic forms of PD, LRRK2 and Parkin, involve constituents of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and are implicated in pathologic ER stress (oxidative stress and apoptosis) related to impaired ubiquitin-proteasome function. Furthermore, upstream impaired mitochondrial cycling produces alpha-synuclein misfolding as by [CONTACT_316260], with further impaired mitophagy and autophagy from lysosomal

Protocol version date 04/19/2021 downregulation (Colla et al, 2019, Lehtonen et al, 2019). The reactive oxygen species and damaged protein, lipid and DNA are proposed as biomarkers of PD (He et al, 2018), but the disease mechanism involves impaired mitochondrial function.  Modulation of cellular energetics has become increasingly used as a therapeutic tool (Kossoff and Hartman, 2012), and monitoring the metabolic effects can provide a biomarker of the therapy, controlling the degree of modulation. Originally studied in epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], nutritional ketosis (NK) is increasingly being studied, and given positive results, adopted in neurodegenerative disease such as PD, Alzheimer’s Disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that involve oxidative stress, impaired cellular metabolism, and toxic species accumulation (Bosco et al, 2006; Nakabeppu et al, 2007). Furthermore, there is the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in both human post-mortem and animal models of PD (Wang et al, 2019). The primary physiologic ketone body, Beta-OHB, attenuates inflammasome activity in LPS treated mouse monocytes in vitro and mouse models of NLRP3-mediated disease (Youm et al, 2015).  Apolipoprotein, the main protein constituent of high density lipoprotein, is found to be abnormal in PD, specifically the A1 type (ApoA1) is consistently reduced and c-reactive protein (CRP) elevated with changes found to be correlated with more severe disease in a large cohort (Oxford Discovery cohort,  Lawton et al, 2020) and may also be elevated by [CONTACT_316261] (Kwiterovich et al, 2003, Mooradian et al, 2006).  Elevated CRP also was associated with worse motor prognosis in a separate PD cohort (Umemura et al, 2015).  Thus, the plasma markers ApoA1 and CRP may be useful as exploratory biomarkers that may show improvement from ketogenic diet.  The mechanism of action and timecourse of symptom reduction of NK in PD remain unclear, but has theoretical benefits to mitochondrial function and gene expression, as detailed below.  Ketogenesis has several proposed benefits for Parkinson’s Disease in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_316187]. There are proposed direct and indirect benefits (Veech et al, 2017). The mechanism of action and time course of symptom reduction of NK in PD remain speculative, although in vitro and animal models suggest a direct benefit of ketone bodies that parallels the fasting state in signaling cell survival and longevity. The primary mechanism for this is described as epi[INVESTIGATOR_316188], specifically by [CONTACT_316262] 1 (HDAC1) (Shimazu et al, 2013).. Accordingly, gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1A) leads to increased mitochondrial biosynthesis, and expression of transcription factor forkhead box O-3 (FOXO3) generates nucleotide coenzyme / reducing agent dihydronicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). According with the fasting / ketogenic state there is also increase in supply of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK), which inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and thereby [CONTACT_316263]. Finally, specific to PD, ketogenic researchers such as [CONTACT_316373] hypothesized that KD would lead to increased  neuron / astrocyte neurotransmitter storage and signaling from increase in mitochondrial efficiency, as ketone bodies by[CONTACT_316264] (TCA) cycle complex I, which is especially deficient in PD post-mortem RNA study (Zheng et al,  2010), as well as increasing the redox span and free energy of ATP hydrolysis by [CONTACT_316265]10 to ubiquinone and reducing NAD+ to NADH (Veech, 2004). Another effect seen as beneficial in neurodegenerative disease as well as epi[INVESTIGATOR_316189]-CoA and export from mitochondria for gluconeogenesis, limiting precursor availability for aspartate and thereby [CONTACT_316266], which is consistent with reported elevated seizure threshold to current-induced seizure models in rats and elevated GABA in brain synaptosomes (Erecinska 1996); that same group also reported increases in GABA production from a glutamine precursor radiolabeling study of rats receiving beta-OHB, and CSF study of children with refractory epi[INVESTIGATOR_316190] (Dahlin et al 2005). Furthermore, paired-pulse TMS study of healthy volunteers on ketogenic diet showed increased short intracortical inhibition (SICI), widely attributed to GABA-A signaling as well as increased central beta power on EEG (Cantello 
19 Abbreviated Title: Tolerability and efficacy of ketogenic diet in Parkinson’s Disease   Version Date: 04/19/2021  
Protocol version date 04/19/2021 et al, 2007). Of potential relevance to PD, GABA is one of several neurotransmitters with deficiency by [CONTACT_316267], preoptic nucleus and nucleus reticularis (Brooks and Peever, 2011), GABA myenteric neurons involved in peristalsis (Grider and Markhlouf, 1992), and smell regulation by [CONTACT_316268] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_316191] 2008). GABA agonism may be therapeutic in PD as suggested by a study of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], a GABA-A agonist, in an early, unilateral untreated PD cohort showing increase in M1 beta from the unaffected side and a reduction in pathologic beta from the affected side (Hall et al 2014) as well as GAD AAV2 gene therapy in STN at [ADDRESS_389212] reduction in UPDRS-3 motor score and reduced motor fluctuations (Niethammer et al, 2017). Neuroimaging correlates of GABA signaling may offer a biomarker of PD and potential effect of ketogenic therapy, with hypothesis that KD exerts an attenuation of pathologic hyperactivation of pallidal efferents through striatal GABA signaling, as well as potentially attenuating pathologic calcium-related oxidative stress in dopaminergic /non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter synthesizing cell groups with high metabolic rate affected by [CONTACT_83068]’s.  There are also potential indirect benefits related to adaptive response to decreased insulin / insulin-like growth factor 1 (IIS) signaling leading to growth factor expression, viz. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), which are implicated in substantia nigra dopaminergic neuron synaptogenesis and survival (Mattson et al, 2018). Plasma BDNF has furthermore been suggested as a biomarker of PD (He 2018), shown to be decreased in PD with and without depression compared to control cohorts (Rahmani et al 2019), furthermore found to be increased in plasma of healthy volunteers  following 4 weeks of KD (Gyorkos et al 2019), while evidence for FGF 2 / other family types in PD and modulation by [CONTACT_316269]. While the relation of BDNF to PD symptoms is not clear in the literature, it is found to be a biomarker of exercise and possibly of ketogenic diet as well, thus is proposed as a KD biomarker pre vs. post intervention in PD.  Using MRS in healthy subjects, brain (occipi[INVESTIGATOR_52030]) beta-OHB ketone values correlated well with plasma ketosis values (r = 0.86) with brain-plasma slope of 0.26 (Pan et al, 2000). Experimentally, the pathway of ketone body (primarily beta-OHB, but also acetoacetate) entry across BBB has been described via active transport (MCT1/MCT2) as well as diffusion.  Plasma ketone values will be therefore used as a proxy for brain values.  Within the short-term, 3-week follow-up of the proposed study, there is not thought to be sufficient time adequately to test disease modification effects such as clearance of alpha-synuclein oligomers or inflammation. Nonetheless, a two-fold acute effect: i) augmentation of mitochondrial efficiency (immediate, within hours of producing brain ketosis) and ii) production of neurotransmitters including dopamine and GABA, together provide improved signaling via intact neurons within the frontostriatal network underlying predicted symptomatic benefit within three weeks, possibly within days of keto-induction, compared to a non-ketogenic, standard diet. Mitochondrial efficiency and neurotransmitters will not be tested directly, but rather indirectly via effects on systems of study, the frontostriatal network via EEG and the parasympathetic system via heart rate variability. As exploratory measures of the study, hypothetical mechanism underlying symptom improvement as above will be tested via purported biomarkers of ketogenic diet – 1) EEG beta power in central regions implicated in motor control, and 2) BDNF levels and cardiovagal function – rater-blinded to ensure objective testing of this hypothesis.  2.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment 2.3.[ADDRESS_389213] oil

Protocol version date 04/19/[ADDRESS_389214] oil in Parkinson’s population, however several studies have been reported for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) participants at doses reported as percentage daily energy intake of 10-40% (Reger et al 2004, Henderson et al 2009, Taylor et al 2018, Ota et al 2019)  which is similar to the proposed study. The achieved doses were somewhat tolerance limited to 60-80% of target doses.  Side effects were more frequently diarrhea (50%), and in a larger study of [ADDRESS_389215] powder / emulsifier based on a Stepan product  (product name [CONTACT_62871]-1202) at dose of approximately 1 tbsp vs. 66 participants in placebo group, GI events were reported in 49% of MCT group, diarrhea in 24% vs. GI events in 27% of placebo group, diarrhea in 14% (Henderson 2009). However, the GI side effects in the MCT group were reduced substantially after change in the base of dosing from water, milk, or juice to an Ensure meal replacement drink. In a study of healthy volunteers comparing MCT oil-supplemented ketogenic diet to standard ketogenic diet, there were overall less ketoinduction symptoms by [CONTACT_316270]-report, however a higher incidence of GI upset / nausea / diarrhea (Harvey et al, 2018). Reported lipid profile effects are variable, ranging from no effect to increase in lipoprotein levels. The variation may be due to either population studied, e.g. Alzheimer’s Dementia or Healthy Volunteer (HV), or dose. No statistically significant effect was found at a dose of 1.5-3 tbsp per day in a cohort of 15 participants with AD at 3 months (Taylor 2018), whereas in a study of 18 HV participants, 11% increase in total cholesterol and 12% increase in LDL cholesterol was found at a dose of 70g (65mL, about 4.3 tbsp) at 21 days (Tholstrup 2004). It is important to consider elevated lipoprotein levels in the context of glycation status, as small dense, glycated (apoliprotein type B) LDL particles have correlated robustly with cardiovascular events, whereas non-glycated (large, non-dense) LDL has not. Any adverse lipoprotein effect from a three week study exposure is expected to be less than the other studies mentioned to be negligible. The refined fatty acid caprylic acid (C8) from MCT oil meets GRAS FDA exemption, GRAS Reference (FEMA No.) 2799.  b. Risks	of	ketogenic	diet	Risks of ketogenic diet have varied based on population, with above studies of ketogenesis involving MCT oil and other ketogenic diet studies in PD, AD, and HV groups reporting GI side effects (nausea, cramps, diarrhea, constipation) as being most common. There are also known effects of ketogenesis  natriuresis that may relate to a general fatigue/malaise, headache, which have been altogether termed “keto-induction symptoms” or “keto-induction flu” that may relate in part to the dehydration as well as reduced intake of certain dietary micronutrients, particularly potassium and magnesium, produced by [CONTACT_316271]. The goal of MCT oil supplementation is to reduce the extent of keto-induction symptoms by [CONTACT_316272]-induction latency, which was in fact reported in a HV group (Harvey et al 2018). Other rare adverse events reported during ketogenic diet intervention in pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_316192], vitamin D deficiency, pancreatitis, bone fractures, cardiomyopathy (due to selenium deficiency) and carnitine deficiency (Kossoff and Hartman, 2012). These side effects have not been reported in studies in the adult neurodegenerative studies reviewed and are unlikely to occur in this short-term study. Risk can be lowered by [CONTACT_316273], daily vitamin, mineral, and fiber supplementation, and vigilant monitoring of electrolytes for depletion or acidosis. However, adverse side effects of mild metabolic acidosis, vomiting and electrolyte derangement are possible and will be carefully screened and monitored and may lead to care escalation / study removal if severe.

Specific to participants who are hypertensive or diabetic, ketogenic diet is generally regarded as safe and beneficial in lowering blood pressure and fasting blood sugar levels. However, there can be risk if this occurs and medication is not adjusted due to overshoot of therapeutic effect. Risk will be mitigated by [CONTACT_316274] > 180 or DBP > 105, and uncontrolled diabetes (A1c > 8.0%) and monitoring blood pressure and blood glucose levels frequently, with potential reduction of glucose or blood pressure lowering medication as per discretion of those study investigators who are licensed physicians credentialed at the NIH Clinical Center.   Other procedures and measurements (venous blood draws, motor physiology, cognition, EEG recording) are expected to incur minimal risk similar to what is encountered in routine clinical evaluation.          c.   Risks of neurologic examination: There is minimal risk associated with a routine physical and neurologic examination or with PD screening questionnaires.     d. Risks of surface ECG: Risk of skin irritation at the site of the ECG electrode may be minimal in some subjects. There is minimal risk associated with surface ECG.   e.  Risks of EEG: There is minimal risk concerning the EEG technique itself. The electrode cap can be uncomfortably tight. There may be mild irritation of the skin and scalp from the mild abrasion needed to assure good contact [CONTACT_316275], paste, or gels used.   -if participant decides not to perform in any measurements, they will not be per se removed from the study. Options include re-testing at a later time and omitting specific declined tests.   f.   Risks of video recording: There is minimal risk to patient confidentiality.  This is because video will be done only with participant’s signed informed consent, including option to blur facial features.  Video will be taken by [CONTACT_316276], and files will be transferred to secure NIH sever for later review by a separately blinded rater.  Videos may be viewed for official NIH teaching / educational purposes within NIH staff.  Any external sharing such as for academic conference presentation will be done only with participants’ written informed consent.  g. Risks of Blood Draw There is minimal risk of bruising or prolonged bleeding from phlebotomy; local pain and fainting or infection at the needle entry site are possible but rare side effects.  h.  Risks of completing study questionnaires The study questionnaires may be frustrating or stressful. Subject may refuse to answer any question or to stop a test at any time and for any reason.

Protocol version date 04/19/[ADDRESS_389217] ketogenic diet has shown improved cognitive outcomes in several small AD trials (reviewed in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_36654] 2018), and ketogenic diet reported improved lexical fluency and working memory compared to a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet in PD cohort with mild cognitive impairment, despi[INVESTIGATOR_316193]-OHB level of 0.31 mM at study conclusion of week 8 measured in the ketogenic diet group  (Krikorian et al 2019). Other clinical trials, VanItallie et al [ADDRESS_389218] improvement in UPDRS-I and less improvement in UPDRS-III compared to low-fat group (with actual more improvement of UPDRS-III in low-fat group and greater side effects of subjective tremor / rigidity in the ketogenic group, which accounted for ½ of 4 KD arm dropouts). Perhaps correlating with non-motor symptom reduction that was  found, BDNF expression is increased directly by [CONTACT_316277]-OHB through NFKB activation and HDAC inhibition. BDNF levels are increased independently by [CONTACT_14759] (Kang et al 2020) and ketogenic diet (Mohorko et al 2019), mediated by [CONTACT_90005][INVESTIGATOR_316194] (Garcia et al 2003; Chen, Russo-Neustadt 2009) and BDNF is found to be an obligate intermediary of hippocampal dependent learning and memory as per single nucleotide polymorphism in mice / neuronal culture studies and impact on human neuropsychiatric disease (Hariri et al 2003). CREB is also increased in fasting and exercise animal models, mediating long term potentiation (LTP), which is considered a proxy of learning and memory. BDNF is also associated with brain cholinergic development and heart rate parasympathetic regulation in mice through genetic mice knockdown study (Wan R et al 2014). BDNF is reduced in PD (Rahmani et al 2019) but does not clearly correlate with PD severity. BDNF was increased in subjects with metabolic syndrome following 4 weeks of ketogenic diet as well as 4 weeks of exercise in additive fashion by 20% and 38% respectively via crossover study (Gyorkos et al 2019). Therefore, there appears to be an indirect correlation with PD as a biomarker of disease, as well as with depression, and a potential therapeutic biomarker with KD.  BDNF may also be elevated therapeutically in PD via 12 weeks intensive exercise as reported in MDS poster Fall 2019 in Nice, [LOCATION_009]: “High Intensity Interval Training May Elevate Serum BDNF Levels in Parkinson’s Disease Patients.”   Related to mitochondrial quality, ketogenic diet, fasting, and exercise upregulate the mitochondrial deacetylase “silent information regulator 3” (SIRT3), which is found to serve multiple roles in mitochondrial integrity including mitochondrial biogenesis, protein oxidative stress response (unfolded protein response) and mitochondrial DNA repair, and also found to be active in NMDA/glutamate-induced excitotoxicity (Hasan-Olive 2019, 30027365). PGC-1alpha provides a serum marker of mitochondrial biogenesis.  In addition to the above, low carbohydrate diets are consistently associated with reduced insulin secretion, reduced hunger, greater weight loss and may produce greater energy expenditure than low-fat (high carbohydrate) diets (Ebbeling et al, 2012) although contrary studies on energy expenditure are found (e.g. Tagliabue et al, 2012). Ketogenic diets have also been associated with slight reductions in blood pressure (e.g. Cicero et al, 2015). Furthermore, there are reported reductions in dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (reduction in triglyceride:HDL, a marker of coronary artery disease, Lemos da Luz et al, 2008) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Tendler et al, 2007).   Potential immediate benefits (obtained during the study) are as follows:  ·      Increased insulin sensitivity with reduced body weight and possibly reduced          triglyceride level ·      Mildly reduced blood pressure, possibly involving reduced pathologic sympathetic tone

However, the data are not compelling to adopt ketogenic diet as medical guideline given use of mostly clinician rating scale with known interrater and intrarater reliability limitations in small studies. Additionally, there are key questions that remain unanswered, such as when the benefit occurs; if benefit correlates with plasma ketosis value;  if so, at what ketosis value; and whether motor or non-motor systems seem to be most responsive when tested together on the same participants serially in the short-term. The participants may benefit in terms of nutritional education through the dietary intervention and better knowledge of their disease symptoms in response to metabolic measures such as glucose, dietary changes, and close attention to on/off fluctuations via self-report. MCT oil has not been studied in Parkinson’s Disease and may improve tolerability of the diet. The risks of ketoinduction symptoms and GI upset are known in other populations and so will be closely monitored, tracked and intervention adapted as needed to minimize them. Overall, the risks of this study from simple dietary changes that have been studied in other populations are expected to be comparatively low relative to disease-modifying pharmaceutical agents studied for PD. One unknown potential benefit from long-term continuation of ketogenic diet (outside the present study) would be disease modification, such as from increase in uric acid / reduction in oxidized metabolites, and by [CONTACT_316279] / autophagy of toxins such as hyperphosphorylated alpha-synuclein. As a short-term study, there is not expected to be direct long-term benefit. However, the justification in addition to scientific value of understanding ketosis in PD is an indirect benefit to participants, whereby [CONTACT_316280], irrespective of study group, by [CONTACT_316281].    3.

Additionally, EEG, TUG, and heart rate variability tests will be performed in the HMCS labs within the 7SW-Neurotesting area.  This study is a single center (NIH Clinical Center), phase 1 feasibility/tolerability assessment of MCT oil subtype of ketogenic diet in a PD cohort, randomized, double-blinded vs. standard American (high-carbohydrate) diet based on macronutrient percentages of calculated daily energy expenditure using measured pCO2 and pO2 and Weir formula for indirect calorimetry, performed on screening visit, to give caloric macronutrient ratios 50-55% carb, 35% lipid, 10-15% protein in SAD group and 5-10% carb, 80% lipid, 10-15% protein in MCT-KD group on the 7SW-S Metabolic Unit with assistance of CC Nutrition Department staff. Consent, baseline lipid panel, BMP, and pregnancy test will be done at screening visit. Randomization will occur upon screening visit, stratified by [CONTACT_654] >=65 or <65 and baseline TUG score >= 11.5 s or <11.[ADDRESS_389223] factor for both groups, as pre-diet intervention baseline testing is planned for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19156] #1. The potential confound of changes in activity/exercise level while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316195]. To address this, study investigators will form an individualized exercise plan incorporating baseline exercise and activity levels to involve stationary bike at target HR based on age-adjusted HR max target using Tanaka's formula validated in the elderly population, 208-0.7 × age, in order to approximate each participant’s daily baseline intensity levels from questionnaires. Ketosis values in the MCT-KD group will be correlated indirectly with respi[INVESTIGATOR_316196] (Freestyle Libre Pro Glucose Monitoring System, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system, FDA approved for blinded professional use in clinics). The hypothesis is that nutritional ketosis will improve mobility and also motor and non-motor symptoms through a direct, homeostatic return of frontostriatal signaling by [CONTACT_316285] 3, and through an indirect mechanism of increased dopamine / GABA availability (reduction in pathologic glutamatergic hyperexcitability) that will develop more gradually, over several days.   Care will be taken to reduce bias through blinding rater(s) to intervention group ketogenic or non-ketogenic and by [CONTACT_316286], with randomization scheme kept only by a study investigator not involved in any of the ratings or measurements (study biostatistician) and by [CONTACT_316287] (aside from muscle tone) of UPDRS-III by [CONTACT_316288], the latter rating scrambled in random assortment with respect to intervention day. Study duration will be three weeks, and total time for participants approximately four weeks including initial study visit and period of at least one week baseline prospective diet, activity and ON/OFF PD symptom fluctuations self-report, and for baseline diet collection also using unscheduled twice weekly phone calls by [CONTACT_316289] / investigator (non-rater). By [CONTACT_316290], participants will receive daily suggested ketogenic diet meal plans for the upcoming two weeks of diet at home. Assessment of MCT-KD adherence will be made by [CONTACT_316291] (LAI).  There is anticipated accrual of up to two participants admitted at once. MCT oil from Liquigen® (KetoCal) will be given at 25% calculated daily lipid energy expenditure, similar to prior studies (refer to Section 2.3.[ADDRESS_389224] oil).

Protocol version date 04/19/2021 While a longer duration ketogenic diet study, e.g. longer than 8 weeks that are the current limit of study follow-up in PD, would address a key gap in the literature on long-term outcomes and potential disease modification, there are other gaps that can be addressed via an acute, short term study, such as target ketosis value, relation of ketosis to symptoms and the time course, tolerability of novel diet adaptations (MCT oil), and biomarker of the therapy such as EEG. These gaps altogether appear to be well addressed by [CONTACT_316292], a unique resource of the NIH Intramural Research Program, and altogether provide an opportunity for a contribution to the field of PD therapeutic research. Additionally, given the constraints of metabolic inpatient study, with an estimated predominance of short-lived adjunctive therapeutic benefits rather than long-term benefits, recruiting for a longer duration of inpatient stay would likely be more difficulty to reach target recruitment; more difficulty to carry out as the study measurements are to be predominantly performed by [CONTACT_316293] (AI); and difficult to justify, amounting to a phase 2+ trial when a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], phase [ADDRESS_389225] the therapy in a rigorous fashion. Therefore, an inpatient/outpatient three-week study is proposed to conduct first in order to address the feasibility and time course questions.   A recognized potential confounder of assessing the effect of ketogenic diet on Parkinson’s Disease symptoms is possible effect on levodopa / dopaminergic (DOPA/DA) medications. Literature search using PubMed and Google search engines shows some studies of effect of KD/modified Atkins diet on plasma AED levels ranging from no effect (Dahlin et al, 2006; Coppola et al, 2010) to modest reduction in some plasma AED levels (Kverneland et al, 2015; Heo et al, 2017), however no relevant pharmacokinetic data for effects of ketogenic diet on DOPA/DA metabolism. The fed state with light breakfast (% lipid not specified) was found to slightly increase immediate release Sinemet bioavailability compared to overnight fasted state in healthy volunteers coinciding with delayed gastric emptying with no clear effect on peak concentration in the small study (Wilding et al, 1991). By [CONTACT_22242], pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers of the effect of a mixed 38% fat, 52% carb, 11% protein meal (1046 kcal) on single dose of a dual rapid/slow release formulation of levodopa + COMT inhibitor benserazide (Madopar) showed reduction of plasma levodopa peak concentration by 32% (2.09 to 1.41 mg/L) and prolonged time to peak by 2 hours (3.1h vs 1h) with however no effect on bioavailability by [CONTACT_316294]  (Crevoisier et al, Eu Jnl Pharmac and Biopharm 2003;55).  Another levodopa formulation, Numient in preclinical study (Europe European Medicines Agency / CHMP / 672104 / 2016) similarly showed dietary fat delayed and reduced plasma levodopa peak concentration without affecting bioavailability.  Similarly, in a study of single dose extended release formulation of carbidopa-levodopa (Rytary) in healthy volunteers in either overnight fasting or post-high-fat, high-calorie breakfast conditions, the initial rise in concentration of levodopawas delayed by 2 hours, peak concentration was reduced by [CONTACT_129743] 21%, and total AUC was modestly increased by 13% (Mittur A et al, 2017 28236251).   Protein is well-established to affect oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of levodopa through shared transporters with large, neutral amino acids and clinical studies, as outlined and referenced in the protocol, and is not considered to be a factor between the two groups given that dietary protein will be controlled over a small range (10-15% total daily energy). Importantly, as confirmed in multiple studies including the above, the fed state itself introduces delayed gastric emptying, and the diet used in the control arm, SAD while not ketogenic is not low fat at 35% daily energy, thus also would reduce peak concentration as per above studies. Another variable in effect of meals on oral pharmacokinetics including PD medications is the formulation, as solid meal boluses delay gastric emptying and more likely impact peak concentration than solutions and suspensions such as proposed in this dietary study, the same in both groups. Therefore, while literature search reveals no pharmacokinetic studies on the effect of ketogenic diet on levodopa or other medications indicated for Parkinson’s Disease, inference from studies of dietary fat as 
28 Abbreviated Title: Tolerability and efficacy of ketogenic diet in Parkinson’s Disease   Version Date: 04/19/2021  
Protocol version date 04/19/2021 above would impute lower and delayed peak concentration (potentially sub-threshold for therapeutic window, especially in more advanced disease such as defined by [CONTACT_133241] & Yahr stage 4) and therefore potentially bias towards the null hypothesis. To better account for effects of diet on levodopa metabolism, plasma dopamine will be measured twice daily at the time of blood draw for beta-hydroxybutyrate on inpatient study days 1 (baseline, pre-dietary intervention) vs. days 2-3.  Independent variable: The effect of intervention MCT-KD vs. standard diet control group (see section 2.1 table for macronutrient ratios under KD and SAD, respectively) will be measured in three ways: a) twice daily phlebotomy beta-OHB levels to be drawn #1 in fasted morning time and #2 in the evening 2 hours after dinner b) daily respi[INVESTIGATOR_38952] (pCO2:pO2) looking for stabilization of decline to the 0.7 – 0.8 range, and c) continuous glucose monitor (CGM) in Metabolic Unit, looking for fluctuations, possibly correlated to symptoms, as well as trend of stable reduction < 100 mg/dL.   The interventional food-based product, Liquigen® (KetoCal), will be administered by [CONTACT_316295]-KD group participants as per defined blinded diet.  Primary Outcome: feasibility will be assessed in a composite fashion by [CONTACT_316296] >80% at study end (week 3) ; study adherence in the outpatient segment defined by [CONTACT_316297] </= 10%, as by [CONTACT_316298]); reaching recruitment target of 32 participants, unless otherwise defined by [CONTACT_316299] (see Section 9); and acceptability by [CONTACT_316300] “somewhat” >/=2/[ADDRESS_389226] be met.  Secondary outcome: Timed Up & Go (TUG) time at between MCT-KD and SAD groups mean difference on inpatient day 7.   Exploratory outcomes:  Effort will be taken in establishing medication and testing schedules, for outcomes to be assessed at the same time from last dopaminergic medications and other psychotropic medication administrations including cholinergic and muscle relaxants (see table 2). All exploratory outcomes will be assessed pre (admission day 1) and post (day 7 and week 3) diet intervention. Additionally, reaction time, Stroop test, N-back test, MN/PQ fingertappi[INVESTIGATOR_121505], 9-HPT, UPDRS-3, and resting HRV will be tested daily on admission days 2-6.  Stroop word color interference latency (Stroop test B), N-back test (3-back letter), MN and PQ keystroke tasks, tremor accelerometry, 9-hole pegboard test (9-HPT), and simple reaction time (SRT), EEG waveform analysis (steepness ratio, sharpness ratio, modulation index), and quantitative (q)EEG assessment; daily assessments of  heart rate variability (SDNN, pNN50, rMSSD, power spectral analysis), and supi[INVESTIGATOR_316197]; resting heart rate (5 min recordings daily), UPDRS including daily UPDRS-3, daily ON time, daily PD symptoms, daily keto-induction symptoms, pre vs. post intervention Non-Motor Symptom Severity Score (NMSS) All testing to be done by [CONTACT_147239], at a certain scheduled time daily or specified testing schedule with respect to last meal and dopaminergic medications or others potentially modulating neuromuscular system (see Table [ADDRESS_389227]).

Protocol version date 04/19/2021 example, dyskinesia has been reported in prior ketogenic PD trial (Phillips et al, 2018) and could be improved by [CONTACT_316302]. For more details on adverse events please refer to Sections 9.5-9.6.  Table 2 – flowchart / schedule of testing Care will be taken to minimize participants’ test/retest variability from psychotropic medications. Accordingly, medications from the following classes will be taken up to the night prior to testing (held for testing): anticholinergics, NMDA antagonists, dopamine blocking agents, muscle relaxants, anticonvulsants, GABA agonists.  Tests will occur in the same order; and care will be taken to control timing of AM dopaminergic dose in relation to testing, providing instruction for participants to take their dopaminergic medications at a set [ADDRESS_389228]. Morning dopaminergic medications will be taken in the overnight fasting state to minimize group differences in pharmacokinetics related to diet, as outlined in section 4.1 above. For each participant, testing will be done in a single session lasting approximately 1.5-2 hours, and time from dopaminergic medication dose to end of testing will be around 2-3 hours. No changes will be made to dopaminergic medication prescription, unless clinical emergency as per credentialed clinician assessment. If participant’s levodopa or agonist dose interval requires repeat dose during testing, we will make no changes but maintain the same dose schedule throughout the testing days 1-7 and week 3.  
 Note: The times listed on the chart are the target timepoints, and while every effort will be made to keep testing as close to the target time as possible, it is expected that there will be some variation in actual testing times.  Times will be recorded.  Variation in testing times is expected and will not be considered a protocol deviation. Home dose of dopaminergic medications will be given in the morning of the testing in the fasted state approximately [ADDRESS_389229] 1 hour after dose prior to the start of testing to decrease variability in absorption.  Mobility assessment: Timed Up & Go (TUG) test

Protocol version date 04/19/[ADDRESS_389230] the hypothesis of improvement occurring acutely (within days of reaching ketosis) due to improved mitochondrial function and neurotransmitter signaling, TUG will be tested by [CONTACT_316303] 7 to target TUG power analysis (see section 9 for details). Pre-intervention screening visit time >/= 11.5s or <11.5s will be used as covariate for group randomization. Power analysis was chosen for TUG as a measure showing good intra-rater reliability (Dal Bello-Haas et al, 2011) and correlated with fall risk (Nocera et al 2013), hence meaningful for motor function. TUG will be done in the hallway of 7SW Neuro testing with distance of [ADDRESS_389231] of three trials, daily as per table 2 testing schedule above.  To control for biological / Levodopa variability, all secondary/exploratory tests will be done at approximately the same time with respect to dopaminergic Parkinson medication and other psychotropic medication dose and at approximate same time of day and same order of tests. Additionally, plasma levodopa will be measured twice daily at the times defined for BOHB blood draw.  Simple reaction time  Simple reaction time has been consistently shown to be impaired in PD (Flowers 1978; Evarts et al, 1981), and the increased latency is found to correspond to motor symptoms of tremor and rigidity in patients with asymmetrically lateralized symptoms and to be furthermore increased bilaterally in patients with bilaterally symmetric symptoms (Yokochi 1985). SRT also is found to be improved after levodopa therapy (Zappia 1994). Furthermore, SRT has been compared to complex reaction time (CRT) and it was found that the same degree of deficit was found in both, suggesting that the deficit is not a function of complexity (Sagar et al, 1992), as has been reported elsewhere (Jahanshahi, Brown, Marsden 1993). SRT is therefore considered to be a potentially useful test of motor benefit related to hypothesis of increased neurotransmitter availability and signaling related to ketogenic diet, with improvement in reaction times on the diet but not on a non-ketogenic, healthy diet.  As per pre-determined scheduled time, the subject will be asked to sit comfortably before a computer screen and look at the white box in neutral fixation space, and when ready to press spacebar with less affected or dominant thumb on a keyboard as soon as seeing an X appear within the box; [ADDRESS_389232] will be asked to look at a row of 4 white boxes and press one of the following keys, z x , (using fingers 2 and 3 bilaterally) corresponding to the X within the box, [ADDRESS_389233] repetitions.

N-back task  As per pre-determined scheduled time, 3-back task will be tested at a certain time daily with letters A,B,C,D,E,H,I,K,L,M,O,P,R,S,T presented for maximum 2000 ms, at a rate of new stimulus ever 2500 ms, for 20 trials.  If the stimulus is the same as 3 trials ago, participants press the ‘M’ key. If the stimulus is not the same as 3 trials ago, participants press the ‘N’ key. (M for memory, N for No) At the end of 20 trials, error % is given for missing 3-back items, and reaction time (ms) is calculated. A demo of the test is found here: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_nback.html Testing will occur daily and at week 3.  MN and PQ keyboard tasks  As per pre-determined scheduled time, testing to occur based on a computer system developed at NINDS 7SW Neuro Testing area (Patrick McGurrin, PhD Neurophysiology), with software prompt to begin tappi[INVESTIGATOR_316199] M and N as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_316200] [ADDRESS_389238] to alternate between the P and the Q keystrokes as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2595], counting #seconds for 30 repetitions and time of each keystroke also recorded. Each task is repeated three times per arm and averaged. Thus, speed (correct repetitions / minute) and rhythm (keystroke vs. time) can both be plotted. This will be helpful to assess bradykinesia and dysrhythmia of Parkinson’s Disease as a function of the intervention, in daily testing over [ADDRESS_389239] task (9-HPT) (Rolyan A851-5) As per pre-determined scheduled time, testing to occur as per this commonly employed measurement in clinic / rehabilitation specialists such as occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_316201]. Normative data has been established (Mathiowetz et al, 1985). This consists of a square board with 9 holes spaced 1.25 in apart, each hole ½ depth and drilled with a 9/32 in drill bit, next to a container for the pegs. In Parkinson’s Disease, means of 26.6s to 36.7s were found at Hoehn & Yahr stages 2-3 in dominant hand, and 27.5s to 36.8s in non-dominant hand (Earhart et al 2011). SEM was found to be 1.[ADDRESS_389240] reliability, to be tested daily as a function of the intervention over 7 days.

Participants will be instructed that, if a peg is knocked from the tray or hole onto the table, they should replace it themselves according to the test phase (in vs. out of the holes), and if it is knocked off the table, the rater will return the peg to its place of origin. This is to minimize potential timing variability. (Instructions adapted from www.rehabmeasures.org, test instructions derived from Mathiowetz et al, 1985). Testing will occur daily over 7 days and at week 3.  Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) Given some literature on ketogenic diet and mood interaction and proposed clinical use as therapy for mood disorders (reviewed in Brietzke et al, 2018), depression will be screening using GDS, a validated instrument listed under Common Data Elements for Parkinson’s Disease. The survey will be self-administered pre (screening visit) and post (day 7, week 3 visit) intervention. Available at: < https://web.stanford.edu/~yesavage/GDS.html >  EEG waveform analysis / qEEG assessment (7 SW Neuro testing area) As per pre-determined scheduled time, EEG recording (Brainproducts, not FDA approved) will be done as following:  64 EEG electrodes will be positioned according to 10-20 International System, with every impedance kept under 5 kOhm and single earlobe used for reference. EEG data will be amplified, filtered (DC-100 Hz), digitized at 1000 Hz (Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, [LOCATION_013]), and stored on a computer for offline analysis. To keep track of common artifacts, to monitor blinks and eye movements, electrooculogram (EOG) will be recorded from two extra electrodes near the right eye on the supra-orbital ridge. To monitor the heart activity, electrocardiogram (ECG) will be recorded from two extra electrodes, one under the collarbone on the right shoulder, and another one on the abdomen on the lower left side.  Subjects will be asked to enter a relaxed, wakeful state minimizing movements, first 5 minutes with eyes open and then 5 minutes with eyes closed.  The following metrics will be analyzed:  Spectral analysis (quantitative EEG) will be assessed in MatLab (EEGLab application)  after pre-processing (removing artifacts, re-referencing) by [CONTACT_316304] (FFT) to give frequency vs. time analysis and derive power per band, focused on: theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz,), and beta (13-[ADDRESS_389242] beta >20 to 30 Hz)), particularly investigating theta power as a correlate of cognitive impairment (reviewed in Geraedts et al, 2018). Additionally, elevated spectral power across frequency bands was found centrally and decreased posterior alpha power with slower alpha dominant rhythm was reported in a mixed phenotype PD cohort compared to controls (Moazami-Goudarzi et al, 2008). It is of interest in the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_316202] a putatitive biomarker of compensation and elevated coherence in the frontostriatal network with reduced parietal coherence, as has been described via functional MRI at HMCS. It is an exploratory aim to assess if these changes are potentially amenable to modification by [CONTACT_316305]. In addition, it is planned to analyze the frequency vs. voltage2/frequency for two questions: - is there abnormal slowing (e.g. loss of posterior alpha rhythm) that is detected initially and normalizes post-intervention; - Is there a change pre vs. post intervention in central (peri-Rolandic) beta power, reportedly increased by [CONTACT_316306] (Cantello et al, 2007) and decreased centrally in the lesional

EEG is to be tested pre/post intervention on study days 1, 7 and week 3. Functional connectivity will be tested by [CONTACT_316307] (via FFT) weighted minimal norm estimate (WMNE) for time and phase synchronization by [CONTACT_316308], a quantitative measure of phase (ranging from 0 to 1) (Hassan et al, 2014) that has been modeled via graph theory network with decreased local integration measures in alpha1 band in PD-MCI group compared to PD-CN and Control groups (Utianski et al, 2016). EEG connectivity measure of coherence can be assessed via magnitude squared coherence (inputting both phase and amplitude of electrode pairs, and by  [CONTACT_316309] (PLI), which calculates asymmetry of distribution of instantaneous signal phase differences between two signals (brain regions), ranging from 0 (uncoupled or phase locked) to 1 (perfect coupling, non-zero, non- π modifier). There is a consistent finding of reduced PLI in the alpha 1 (8-10) and alpha 2 (>10-13) bands broadly distributed and increased PLI in theta bands in temporal regions associated with PD-MCI compared to PD with normal cognition (Chaturvedi et al, 2019). Therefore, assessing PLI per frequency bands in defined regions is of interest as exploratory measure of the ketogenic diet intervention (pre vs. post intervention), with hypothesis of increased alpha PLI at [ADDRESS_389244]-intervention in the ketogenic diet group, sustained at 3 weeks. Additionally, waveform analysis will involve metrics of M1 slope and amplitude at defined intervals surrounding each extrema (e.g. 3 point before/after) to derive sharpness ratio (amplitude peak to trough) and steepness ratio (slope rise:fall) correlated with pathologic phase-amplitude coupling in motor striatocortical loops as per Jackson et al, 2019. Heart rate variability As per pre-determined scheduled time, subjects will receive monitoring daily on study days 1-7 for 5 minutes using Elite HRV finger monitor and Android application in relaxed waking state in the reclined seated position. Additionally, on study days 1, 7, and week 3 (pre/post intervention), at the time of sessions with rsEEG (see table 2 for testing schedule), trials of Valsalva Maneuver (VM) and deep breathing (DB) will be conducted as follows: VM with coaching to blow into mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_316204] 40 mmHg x 15 seconds, and the recording of heart rate cardiovagal gain over the subsequent 1 minute (max RR / min RR interval); average of 3 trials will be used for analysis. DB will occur for 1 minute with 6 cycles per minute, average of 2 trials. Recording for cardiovagal testing will be conducted study day 1, 7, and week 3 via ECG electrodes using Natus Neurology machine (not FDA approved).  Analysis will be done using EliteHRV and Biopac Acqknowledge software to extract using artifact removed R-R wave (N-N) intervals SDNN, pNN50, rMSSD, and power spectral analysis (LF, HF, VLF, LF/HF ratio).

While there is a knowledge gap for the mechanism of purported acute benefits of nutritional ketosis in PD even within one week that motivates this study, there are additional hypothesized benefits that would appear only on a longer time scale for which this study would be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_316205], phase 2+, larger scale and longer study duration in the outpatient setting to study effects of therapeutic diet on disease progression. Such disease markers might include decrease in oxidation protein products (AOPPs), oxidized lipid metabolites and urinary nucleotides, increase in autophagy via CSF markers, and increased brain perfusion without increase in FDG-PET uptake, as was reported in recent ketogenic diet trial in AD by [CONTACT_316312] [ADDRESS_389250] for disease modification. On the other hand, acute effects also require further study and are the aim of this proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_316206].  PD motor pathology of rigidity and bradykinesia is clearly associated with pathologic hypersynchrony in striatal-frontal beta oscillation along with abnormally long bursts of beta activity (Brown and Williams, 2005), and the severity of motor symptoms correlates with phase (beta frequency) amplitude (gamma frequency) coupling in motor cortex and STN (van Wijk et al, 2016), which are ameliorated with DBS (de Hemptinne et al., 2015) as well as L-DOPA (Cole et al, 2017). Also clear in the pathobiology of PD, parasympathetic and sympathetic nodes of the autonomic nervous system are involved with impaired functional testing, which can precede motor symptoms (Goldstein 2014).   Proposed acute effects of ketogenic diet in relation to symptom benefit may include increased parasympathetic tone seen in animal studies of KD related to production of BDNF, which can be directedly tested, and increase in peri-Sylvian beta power on EEG, reported in healthy volunteers on KD as a correlate of increased SICI / cortico-cortical GABA-A signaling (Cantello et al 2007), particularly relevant for PD with morbidity of depression and GI disturbances implicating non-dopaminergic neurodegeneration, for which GABA deficiency and related calcium overload are hypothesized mechanistically (reviewed in Blaszczyk 2016). The acute effects of the intervention are putatively related to increase in GABA tone, for which EEG and parasympathetic testing appear to be promising as acute biomarkers of the intervention.  The diet intervention duration of [ADDRESS_389251] feasibility as well as symptomatic effects and biomarker signal within the acute period, it is contingent upon a future study that would provide a longer time period and ideally study more subjects to validate the feasibility of the approach adopted in this intervention in both symptoms and disease modification. While ketogenic diet is validated as being therapeutic in certain types of epi[INVESTIGATOR_316207], and the approach is 
36 Abbreviated Title: Tolerability and efficacy of ketogenic diet in Parkinson’s Disease   Version Date: 04/19/2021  
Protocol version date 04/19/2021 often to prescribe the diet for a period of time such as 6 months or 1 year because the therapeutic benefit of seizure reduction/cessation often endures long after switching back to a regular diet, such data are not available for Parkinson’s and will require further study, which this study does not attempt to address. Rather, this study proposes to address what level of ketosis can be achieved through an MCT oil supplemented, monitored diet with less stringent carbohydrate restriction and therefore presumably better tolerated as a long-term therapy; whether there may be particular biomarkers to indicate success of the diet, such as EEG central beta power, heart rate variability or BDNF; if side effects of MCT oil are tolerable in this population with known gastro-intestinal paresis; and what effect does a given ketosis value have compared to another on serially repeated, validated measurements in PD.  Anecdotally, PwP adhering to ketogenic diet or other low-carbohydrate diets such as Paleolithic diet have reported that both diets, avoiding carbohydrate and large amounts of protein, improve symptoms such as walking speed, tremor and fatigue, even at low or undetectable values of ketosis as measured from a ketone meter reagent strips, a validated method for beta-OHB levels 0.1 – 6.0 mM (for further details of community engagement please refer to section 5.6). Accordingly, the mechanism underlying benefits of a low carbohydrate diet appears to be more multifaceted than simply ketosis, potentially involving differences related to fatty acid metabolism, levels of PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids), glycolysis, insulin sensitivity, levels of antioxidants, DNA repair, and buffers for coenzyme activation. This remaining question drives the study, with the question of “do ketosis values matter,” which is well posed for inpatient metabolic unit study.   Of methodological importance, a learning effect is expected in repeated tests, more so in the proposed tests involving preparation and decision such as Stroop word-color interference, TUG, and 3-back recall. However, the underlying assumption of learning effect is that it is expected to be equivalent in both randomized study conditions, and moreover is of study interest for between-group effect though not directly measured. The tests were selected as ones with established reliability of repeated testing, which is operationally validated for simple motor tasks - simple reaction time (18 trials, Hamsher 1977), 9-hole pegboard test, MN-PQ keyboard tappi[INVESTIGATOR_231391], and TUG. On the other hand, there is greater potential learning bias in cognitive tasks, particularly visuoverbal 3-back working memory task (Soveri et al 2018) where test-retest reliability has been reported as moderate, whereas simple reaction time reliability is much higher. Nonetheless, it is the aim to adjust for learning effect by [CONTACT_316313]. Learning effect could account for some of the difference in performance between the groups particularly in cognitive tasks. The goal is to capture which types of testing improve, whether ones more (n-back test, Stroop word-color interference) or less (reaction time, tappi[INVESTIGATOR_231391], TUG) subject to learning effect, to infer appropriately whether or not learning effect may be considered to be operative in any difference between the groups.   The combination of inpatient and outpatient parts of the study involves some degree of discontinuity of the diet, at least in terms of monitoring but also in the diet itself. The latter difference is due to the desire to maintain double-blinding in the inpatient part of the study to minimize placebo effect, while also wanting to assess feasibility of a diet that is thought to be better tolerated than traditional, strict 4:1 (4 grams lipid to 1 gram carb + protein) ketogenic diets. The inpatient diet is predominantly liquid via blended nutrients to facilitate the blinding, but this is not practical to recommend for long-term outpatient therapy. Furthermore, while there is possibility to maintain a control group in the outpatient part of the study, it is felt preferable to prescribe ketogenic diet to all participants outpatient for a few reasons. First, study power will be increased for the key portion of the study: feasibility of MCT-KD in the home. Second, regardless of inpatient randomization group, all participants will have opportunity to try the 
37 Abbreviated Title: Tolerability and efficacy of ketogenic diet in Parkinson’s Disease   Version Date: 04/19/2021  
Protocol version date 04/19/2021 ketogenic diet as possible therapy, which should improve study recruitment and limit possible “nocebo” effect that an outpatient control group might otherwise be subject to.  Herein is proposed an inpatient pi[INVESTIGATOR_316208] (MCT-KD) compared to standard American diet (SAD) in randomized, double-blind participant groups followed by [CONTACT_316314] a similar ketogenic diet with education and meal preparation guidelines, monitored for the inpatient portion with fingerstick beta-OHB levels, continuous glucose monitoring, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_316209], Diet tracking, correlating with motor physiology, cognitive inhibition and short-term recall, and EEG characteristics to establish which, if any, aspects of known PD test impairments may be modulated by [CONTACT_316258], to inform subsequent study into symptomatic benefit and/or disease modification.   4.[ADDRESS_389252] ketogenic diet has been shown to be non-toxic (Traul 2000) and well tolerated at a dose of 30mL three times daily (Harvey et al 2018). This dose led to a mean increase in beta-OHB of 0.8mM by [CONTACT_4475] 7 and shorter latency of keto-induction (more participants achieving level of 0.5mM by [CONTACT_46062] 1-2), as well as lower mean glucose values, with mean beta OHB in the MCT oil group >1mM by [CONTACT_4475] 6. Due to the reported higher incidence of GI side effects in that study, and expected lower GI motility due to autonomic dysfunction, a more moderate dose of 20% calculated daily resting energy expenditure or approximately 45-60 mL daily will be used. A similar dose of 40mL once daily in a cohort of AD participants the morning fasted state showed increase of beta-OHB by [CONTACT_3450] 0.5mM at peak-dose, 90 minutes later (Reger et al, 2004). MCT as a supplement to ketogenic diet has also been studied in pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_316210] a therapeutic effect in that population with a wider range of carbohydrate intake (reviewed in Liu et al, 2008). A similar use in PD might be established, and such determination would require further study such as proposed in this study. MCT permits a manipulation of ketogenesis between a ketogenic and non-ketogenic group while maintaining a similar diet composition, including same levels of protein, which is an important potential confound through its reported effect on L-DOPA intestinal absorption neutral large amino acid transporter.

39 Abbreviated Title: Tolerability and efficacy of ketogenic diet in Parkinson’s Disease   Version Date: 04/19/2021  
Protocol version date 04/19/2021 ● Abstain from strenuous exercise for 4 hours before each blood collection for clinical laboratory tests. Participants may participate in light recreational activities during studies (e.g., watching television, reading).  5.5 SCREEN FAILURES Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical trial but are not subsequently assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE). Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because of a significant systemic comorbidity, concern of potential atypi[INVESTIGATOR_234009], or PD psychosis or dementia may be rescreened. Rescreened participants should be assigned the same participant number as for the initial screening.  5.6 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION Community engagement was obtained by [CONTACT_316320]’s (PwP) who either adhere to ketogenic diet or who are interested in modifying their diet for PD or general nutritional health. These six individuals were identified through NIH PD Clinic as attendees of the clinic and initiated discussion about ketogenic, Paleolithic, otherwise low-carbohydrate diet or requesting dietary recommendations. With all of these individuals, the following was asked:   -what do you think about this study concept – comments, questions, concerns? -what do you think about ketogenic diet? (if you have a sense about it at all) -have you received dietary recommendations regarding PD or your general health, if so would you be willing to share what the gist of those are? -do you consider your diet to have any particular impact on your symptoms, if so how? (excessive protein is well established to worsen PD symptoms in those who have more advanced disease with fluctuations, excessive carbohydrate not as clear, although metabolic syndrome is a clear risk factor for PD). -do you think a one-week study with non-invasive testing aside from blood draws is reasonable without monetary compensation aside from travel expenses, on the basis of the potential therapeutic value of dietary modification and learning about its effects on your symptoms?  Initial feedback (n=25, predominantly via PD Facebook interest groups and also email) has been that ketogenic diet has been attempted by [CONTACT_316321], and dietary recommendations are not standard in medical care for PD. There is agreement that both excess carb and protein can perturb symptoms of fatigue, tremor, bradykinesia, and so forth. There is some expressed concern from a few individuals that a one-week inpatient study with a standard diet vs. ketogenic diet might have difficulty garnering recruitment, with limitation in exercise regimen raised as a potential barrier. It will be important to distribute questions about the current study concept and dietary interest / engagement to a wider sampling of the community, which will be targeted via in-person discussion at local support groups, and continue through online media such as Facebook support groups. Additionally, one of the associate investigators is a PwP who has adhered to ketogenic diet for ten years and has provided valuable insight on the diet’s anecdotal long-term effects on symptoms, tolerability and ADLs, guiding this study design.  Recruitment will include contact[CONTACT_316322] 01-N-0206, 93-N-0202, or 14-N-0086. The informed consent documents associated with the protocols

Protocol version date 04/19/[ADDRESS_389256] presentation) at local support groups.  Accrual will occur up to 2 screening visits / admissions per week, and expected average of less than that, perhaps 1-[ADDRESS_389257] to participants would be in local transportation across two study visits, defined as <(50) miles from the NIH Clinical Center. Travel expenses could be incurred in traveling for longer distances but would be eligible for reimbursement. Additionally, some additional cost may be associated with the two week outpatient ketogenic diet above usual food expenses, but given that MCT oil (approximately 25% of the daily fat) will be supplied, this is not expected to be a major cost and meal plans will be designed with cost in mind. The inpatient intervention and all testing would be provided to the participants free of charge. There is the potential for acute decompensation in vital function from relatively frequent causes - infection, cardiac arrhythmia, or thromboembolic event - or other cause, for which emergent acute care would be provided by [CONTACT_316323], and transfer to nearby, affiliated or other medical facility could be performed at cost to the patient for services (e.g. tPA for stroke) not available at the Clinical Center.  Due to the short duration of the study, the possibility of costs for emergency medical care is relatively low.   5.6.2 Compensation For travel expenses to/from Screening Visit (#1) and/or Admission Visit (#2) and/or Outpatient Final Visit (#3): ● Reimbursement for Lodging if travel >50 miles: as per scale used for 01-N-0206 protocol ● Reimbursement for travel < 50 miles as per scale used for 01-N-0206 protocol ● Compensation will not be provided   6. STUDY INTERVENTION 6.1 STUDY INTERVENTIONS(S) ADMINISTRATION 6.1.[ADDRESS_389258]-KD or MD groups by [CONTACT_316324] (see 9.2, Sample Size Determination). Randomization will not factor PD medications or DBS status, because there is no clear data to suggest

Protocol version date 04/19/[ADDRESS_389259] protein intake. Study raters will remain blinded to diet group, because randomization scheme will be kept only by [CONTACT_316325], none of whom are involved in study rating. A possible exception is unblinding due to serious adverse event determined by [CONTACT_115158] (non-rater) in consultation with safety monitor in which participant continues in the study, in which case data will be demarcated and not included in statistical analysis.  Prior to admission, participants will be instructed to complete a log for 1 week of activities and diet at home. Upon admission to the Metabolic Unit and during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19156] 1, they will continue a regular, healthy hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316213] (carbohydrate predominant) and undergo baseline testing in mobility, physiologic and cognitive measures as per Section 3, Objectives and Endpoints). On hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598] 2-7, they will begin one of two diets:  diet A, MCT-KD, according to set macronutrient ratios by [CONTACT_316326]: lipid 80% (25% of which is MCT oil), carb 5-10%, protein 10-15%, expected to be better tolerated than traditional NK, vs. diet B, standard American diet, lipid 30-35%, carb 55%, protein 10-15% . The goal is study time series of betaOHB, respi[INVESTIGATOR_38952], and continuous glucose ketosis measurements with tests of symptomatic impairment, with the hypothesis that nutritional ketosis augments mitochondrial function within hours of keto-induction and provides further benefit over days due to better functional neurotransmitter supply to key motor and cognitive synapses, aside from any long-term disease modification. Added benefits of an inpatient trial include monitored adherence and a look at biomarkers such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_316214] (CO2:O2 expected to go down due to diet), as well as easier access to daily repeated testing such as cognitive focused testing on executive function, memory and learning, as well as quantitative motor assessment of bradykinesia (keyboard, 9-hole pegboard), blinded UPDRS, and pain / fatigue assessment by [CONTACT_208816].  Overview of Trial Flow and Events. Figure [ADDRESS_389260]-KD trial flow and events. We propose a screening enrollment of 1-2 participants per week for total of 32 participants. Upon meeting study criteria and consent, participants are asked to provide one week baseline diet and activity/exercise intake, and then be admitted to NIH CC for a one week study intervention assessing ketosis and symptom outcomes, safety monitoring and potential biomarkers of the diet on Parkinson’s EEG and BDNF levels. During admission and discharge, communication will be maintained with participants regarding the requested outpatient portion, in which participants are provided meal plans to continue (or in the case of standard diet participants, begin) a standard ketogenic diet, with MCT oil in the home. The outpatient diet will be given as recommended meals and instructions to be reachable via telephone for twice weekly unscheduled calls from NIH CC Nutrition staff to populate diet adherence using diet tracking linked to study investigator’s account. Additionally, study nutritionist / investigator (not involved in study rating) will perform unscheduled twice weekly phone calls to obtain post-screening baseline diet (one week) and outpatient KD intervention adherence assessment (two weeks). Participants will then be asked to return for a follow-up visit in NIH CC OP5 two weeks after discharge date. If the appointment date varies from two weeks for any reason, the same visit and measurements will occur, but visits will be demarcated separately for statistical analysis.

 Screening procedure:  Following recruitment, potential subjects will be pre-screened by [CONTACT_756], in person, or via email communication according to the inclusion / exclusion criteria, discussion of the scope of the study and study design, expected potential benefits and side effects. If the potential candidate  meets the study eligibility criteria, a screening visit will be scheduled at NIH CC outpatient clinic.  The estimated duration of the screening visit is 4 hours, and may be spread over 2 seperate days if necessary. Upon registration, an order will be submitted for metabolic tracking (PCO2:PO2 gas exchange) for calculation of daily resting energy expenditure.   Informed consent will be obtained prior to any tests or procedures being conducted at the screening visit.    During the screening visit, history, physical exam, focused neurologic exam, Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Non-Motor Severity Scale (NMSS), blood draw consisting of 1 gel-barrier tube (gold, red, or mottled red-gray) for BMP, HCG for women of childbearing potential), and Timed Up and Go test, as well as randomization by [CONTACT_316327].  Results of study group allocation will be conveyed by [CONTACT_316328].  Active Intervention: The Ketogenic Diet. The typi[INVESTIGATOR_316215] ~50% carbohydrate, 35% fat, and 15% protein calories. The proposed KD proposes decreased carbohydrate (5-10%), greatly increases fat (80%), which becomes the primary energy source, and leaves protein unchanged (15%) calories. The ratio of lipid (fat) to non-lipid content (carbohydrate and protein) defines different NK plans. Unlike “Western” high fat diets that do not restrict carbohydrates, NKs do not significantly increase or may decrease triglycerides, insulin resistance, and body weight.    MCT oil consumption can increase overall fat intake, enhance ketosis, and allow more absolute carbohydrate consumption. Furthermore, in the outpatient part of the study, complex carbohydrates will be given through diverse vegetables including non-starchy green leafy vegetables and tomatoes. The lipid ratio will be MCT: other lipi[INVESTIGATOR_316216] a 1:3. Multiple trials of AD patients (e.g. Reger et al 2004, Ota et al 2019) demonstrated this approach is feasible for AD patients, and thus toleration is not considered to be of significant concern. MCTs, though, can cause gastrointestinal discomfort, and this will be monitored. In the Reger et al and Henderson et al studies cited, an emulsified MCT formulation and gradual titration schedule minimized this complaint.

Protocol version date 04/19/2021 Blood fingerstick ketone concentrations quantify depth of ketosis. Adherence will be ensured through clinical provider/nurse check-ins and meal preparation in coordination with dieticians and Clinical Center nutrition staff. We will determine fingerstick β-hydroxybutyrate levels at baseline and at two daily defined intervals from meals and medications (once daily on day 7).  Ancillary proxy testing of ketosis will additionally occur via continuous glucose monitoring (Freestyle Libre Pro System sensor, Abbott, FDA approved for healthcare professional use with diabetes, for non-FDA approved research use in this study, to gauge indirectly ketosis value in continuous fashion). All participants will receive dietary counseling and educational material from study dietician/nutritionist. Counseling will include planning outpatient meals that are ketogenic incorporating MCT oil, with the goal of prioritizing accessibility in grocery stores for participants to obtain relatively easily; relatively lower cost ketogenic foods; and considering nutritional value.  Because the intended use of MCT oil is to facilitate a ketogenesis state along with diet and nutrition to mitigate symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, MCT oil may be considered to be a drug for the purpose of the study. The use of MCT oil  is not intended to support a new indication for use or any other significant change to the labeling; the drugs are already approved and marketed and the investigation is not intended to support a significant change in advertising; and the investigation does not involve a route of administration or dosage level in use in a patient population or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product.   MCT oil will be used as a means to facilitate achieving ketogenesis in a manner that is expected to be more feasible for patients than the ketogenic diet alone.  MCT oil is commercially available and meets GRAS FDA exemption (see protocol 2.3.1a).  While MCT oil is novel in the study population and has not yet been studied in patients with Parkinson’s disease, the expectation is that adverse events to be similar to those reported in several studies of patients with Alzheimer’s disease.  The oil is not being modified in any way and will be used according to approved parameters as a dietary supplement to achieve a ketogenic state, which is the primary goal of this study.   An IND exemption was filed with the FDA, and the final outcome was FDA determination that the study does not appear to raise safety concerns and accordingly, the research study is not expected to comply with the IND reporting requirements for this study.  The use of MCT oil in this research study will be within the parameters and standards of the GRAS FDA exemption for this product.   6.1.2 Dosing and Administration Dose of the Liquigen® (KetoCal)  MCT oil will be calculated individually based on 20% participant daily energy expenditure using the Weir formula. Meals will be combination of solid and blended liquid with care taken for blinding study subjects to ketogenic or standard diet composition.   [IP_ADDRESS] Drug Administration The MCT oilLiquigen® (KetoCal  will be incorporated into food / beverages for participants in the MCT-KD group by [CONTACT_316329], who will not disclose group identity to study raters. Record of food and beverage consumption will be maintained using weight and data entry as per usual practice in nutritional studies at the NIH CC.  The purpose of the notification will be to ascertain the

The standard and ketogenic diets will be provided by [CONTACT_316330]. Both diets will be as per provided menu in collaboration with Metabolic Unit staff (study dietician and others). Standard diet will adhere to macronutrient composition lipid 35%, protein 10-15%, carbohydrate 50-55%. Ketogenic diet will incorporate restriction of carbohydrates to reach 80/5-10/10-15 (lipid:carb:protein daily energy) values. The total daily energy will be calculated from respi[INVESTIGATOR_316217] (Weir, 1949): Metabolic rate (kcal per day) = 1.44 (3.94 VO2 + 1.11 VCO2). Both ketogenic and standard diets will be eucaloric, providing recommended daily calories.  6.2 PREPARATION/HANDLING/STORAGE/ACCOUNTABILITY  N.A. 6.2.1 Acquisition and Accountability The Liquigen® (KetoCal)MCT oil is carried by [CONTACT_316331].  6.2.2 Formulation, Appearance, Packaging, and Labeling As per Liquigen® (KetoCal)  Product Bulletin  (URL: < https://shop.myketocal.com/product/liquigen>): • Ingredients:  Refined coconut and/or palm kernel oil, water, citric acid esters of mono and diglycerides (emulsifier), mono and diglycerides (emulsifier), citric acid. • UnflavoredFor oral or enteral use • kcal/mL: 4.5  • Caloric Distribution (% of kcal) - Protein: 0% - Carbohydrate: 0% - Fat: 100% Recommended Usage: - Oral Administration: It may be mixed into beverages and foods.

Outpatient ketogenic diet According to participant decision after discussion during the screening and admission, willing participants are instructed to continue ketogenic diet as defined by [CONTACT_316333].  Diet tracking with information on macronutrient and micronutrient composition will occur via unscheduled phone calls by [CONTACT_316334] 24 hour food recall, input to NDSR04 software. 6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING As described in Section 9.2 (refer for details), study participants will be randomized after screening visit by [CONTACT_316327]. The intervention allocation will be withheld from all study investigators and raters until after the conclusion of all measurements, who will remain blinded to participant allocation for the duration of the study. Refer to Section 9 for details of randomization.  The study nutrition staff will remain unblinded in establishing participant-individualized meal plans. S/he will not disclose any diet details of the admitted participants and will not participate in any of the study measurements. Other investigators will be blinded except due to adverse event or inadvertent event. Nutrition staff (CC Nutrition Department) will design the blinded diets according to the macronutrient ratios and MCT oil supplementation specified in the study (from calculated daily total energy expenditure by [CONTACT_316335]).  Aside from the addition of MCT oil comprising 25% of daily lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], the diet will be similar to what was used in existing study at the NIH CC Metabolic Unit, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] Ketogenic Diet in Alcoholism, as per clinicaltrials.gov description:  Dietary Supplement: Ketogenic Diet (KD) / Standard American (SA) Snacks and Shakes  

46 Abbreviated Title: Tolerability and efficacy of ketogenic diet in Parkinson’s Disease   Version Date: 04/19/2021  
Protocol version date 04/19/2021 “Ketogenic Diet (KD) / Standard American (SA) Meals and Shakes: Participants will be randomized to a meal plan of either a ketogenic diet (KD) or standard American (SA) diet at the time they sign the consent. For each meal at breakfast, lunch and dinner, the diets will consist of SA meal (carbohydrate rich) or KD meal depending on treatment randomization... [ ]...To ensure that the diet is double blind...[ ]...solid snacks are always ketogenic and shakes are either KD or SA.”  From conversation with NIAAA study PI [INVESTIGATOR_316218], when participants were asked about which diet they believed they received, they usually thought they were receiving ketogenic diet, which appears to support the integrity of the dietary blind.   Based on the literature of ketogenic diet pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] (of 3 months duration or less) that no major adverse event was reported in three ketogenic studies in PD and another three in AD, it is unlikely that a serious adverse event (SAE) related to the intervention will occur.

If there is a major adverse event, including but not limited to: Na <135, K < 3.4, Mag <1.0, HCO3 < 22, and/or vomiting,  study investigators including PI [INVESTIGATOR_316219], discussion will occur with the Independent Medical Monitor within 24 hours as to recommendations for therapy, and participant will be withdrawn from the study and study investigators unblinded to the participant’s intervention status unless there is consensus by [CONTACT_316337] (e.g. fluid rehydration, anti-nausea medication) or participation continued on a modified / less stringent ketogenic diet.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_316220]-blind design, unblinding may occur inadvertently.

Adherence will be assessed also through records of diet consumption made by [CONTACT_316339] (AI) using instructions to consume 100% of provided meals and weighing meals before/after consumption, logging data using ProNutra software. All willing study participants will be counseled on ketogenic diet in preparation for the outpatient portion of the study unless they have communicated that they will decline the outpatient study. They will receive a schedule of possible meals to select from for the two weeks of outpatient study and to establish a means of contact [CONTACT_316340]. During these two weeks, study nutritionists will call them twice weekly at unscheduled times for 24-hour food recall review, and data from these calls will be used to determine outpatient adherence.

Medications to be reported in the Case Report Form (CRF) are concomitant prescription medications, over-the-counter medications and supplements.   No adjustments will be made to patient’s home medication regimen including all Parkinson’s Disease medications. Any omissions whether in error or patient choice will be recorded in CRIS.  7. STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL                    7.1    DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION Discontinuation from dietary intervention does not mean discontinuation from the study, and remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690].  If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will determine if any change in participant management is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an adverse event (AE).  Holding criteria: Study intervention(Liquigen® (KetoCal) ) and ketogenic diet) will be withheld if clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia is detected on baseline ECG (please refer to Clinical Evaluations Section 8.2 for details).   The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the following: • diet menu and record • patient interview with worksheets and symptoms • height, weight, vital signs including orthostatic (supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] x 10min, immediately and 3min after standing); physical examination with focused neurologic examination Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]:  1.) Patient request 2.) If any investigator judges that continuing the procedure would be detrimental to the patient’s health and well-being or that clinically meaningful data is not being obtained for other reasons.  An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the following reasons: • Completion of study intervention • Disease progression which requires discontinuation of the study intervention • If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant • Investigator discretion • Positive pregnancy test • Participant unable to receive study intervention for more than 1 day

Video recording is done for research purpose only (quality assessment by [CONTACT_316350]-person rater with a separately blinded video rater).  Examination with requested video recording as per above will be repeated on day of discharge (post-intervention). Examination as per above will also be repeated on day of admission (pre-intervention), without request for video recording unless a significant clinical finding is observed in difference from the screening visit.  Vital signs and Heart rate variability Vital signs will be done as per routine care in the Metabolic Unit and will also include daily orthostatic check to be done by [CONTACT_316351]. Daily heart rate variability will be performed with pre/post intervention (daily days 1-7 and at week 3) heart rate responses to a) deep breathing at 6 cycles per minute (5 cycles E:I ratio) and difference between average max and min heart rates; and b) Valsalva Ratio (HR max : HR baseline) with Valsalva Maneuver x 15s at 30-40 mmHg (days 1, 7, and week 3).  Radiographic or other imaging assessments ECG – ECG will  be performed at screening or Day 1 of admission (depending on availability), however must be performed prior to diet intervention.

Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include cardiac arrhythmia requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, or pancreatitis / kidney stones that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  8.4.3    Classification of an Adverse Event  [IP_ADDRESS]      Severity of Event For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to describe severity.  • Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  • Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. 
55 Abbreviated Title: Tolerability and efficacy of ketogenic diet in Parkinson’s Disease   Version Date: 04/19/2021  
Protocol version date 04/19/2021 • Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.]  Serious adverse events associated with ketogenic diet are rare and reported predominantly in pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_316228], thus are not directly applicable to the adult population with Parkinson’s disease. Potential risks associated with ketogenic diet include dehydration related to natriuresis, electrolyte depletion, metabolic acidosis, vomiting, and elevated cholesterol and lipoprotein levels. Adverse events associated with these risks are not defined in frequency. Three pi[INVESTIGATOR_316229]’s Disease did not report any serious adverse events.   As a preventative measure, PD patients with cardiovascular and other major comorbidities will be excluded from the study, and EKG will be performed at admission baseline. Daily electrolyte testing will occur in all participants on study days 2-5, and daily clinical assessment for volume status will occur by [CONTACT_316361]. Reporting of events such as vomiting or other ketogenic diet induction symptoms will occur to metabolic unit staff and relayed to study PI (not involved in rating) and independent medical monitor (IMM), except when medically necessary for unblinding to occur immediately (i.e. to provide emergent medical care). Baseline and end of study lipid panel will be measured and results made available to participants, with medical counseling to be provided in debriefing session on further checking outpatient with primary care physician if elevated or showing an upward trend.  Relationship to Study Intervention All adverse events (Aes) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_316362]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.   • Related – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study intervention and the AE. • Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  [IP_ADDRESS]   Expectedness  IMM will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention.  8.4.4      Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow-Up The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor.

Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  AE will be solicited through daily keto-induction symptom worksheets. Opportunity for unsolicited AE will be provided / encouraged, with instructions for conversation to occur initially with study PI / IMM to maintain blinding of study raters, when AE is not serious and is non-emergent.  Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_316230] 7 (for non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. Study AI will also be involved in evaluation after study completion when non-emergent. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. 8.4.[ADDRESS_389270] include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all-cause mortality) must be reported in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the study intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must immediately report the event to the IRB.  All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site investigator deems the event to be chronic or the participant is stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by [CONTACT_36909] (DCC) and should be provided as soon as possible.  The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for notifying the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the PI’s initial receipt of the information.  In addition, the sponsor must notify FDA and all participating investigators in an Investigational New Drug (IND) safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the PI [INVESTIGATOR_316231].

Primary outcome: Feasibility of nutritional ketosis( ketogenic diet with 80% lipid including MCT oil, 10-15% protein, 5-10% carbohydrate), in Parkinson Disease cohort defined as a composite outcome meeting all of the following criteria: recruitment target of 32 or as per interim power analysis defined in Section 9.4.6; retention rate > 80% at study end; adherence to ketogenic diet in the outpatient portion defined as mean carbohydrate energy intake <10%, and intervention is acceptable to all participants by [CONTACT_316347] >/= 2/4 of likelihood of using this therapy in the future and effectiveness in symptom reduction, from all study participants at 3 weeks.  Secondary hypothesis:

Protocol version date 04/19/2021 Nutritional induced ketosis (NK) increases mobility based on TUG score in a Parkinson Disease cohort at 7 days compared to usual diet (35% lipid, 10-15% protein, 50-55% carbohydrate). Secondary outcome: timed Up & Go test (TUG score) at study day 7 (fastest of three trials) H0: µ1 = µ2, where µ1 and µ2 are the population means for the NK diet group and usual diet group respectively vs. H1: µ1≠µ2.   Exploratory hypotheses:  Hypothesis A: Nutritional ketosis improves PD symptomatology in cognition (improved attention, recall, and executive function, and motor function akinesia and tremor within six days, as assessed by: [CONTACT_316365]-color interference latency (executive function), n-back recall task (attention and working memory), simple reaction time (akinesia); fingertap speed and rhythm MN and PQ keyboard tasks (fine motor), and autonomic function (heart rate variability at rest and with deep breathing / Valsalva Maneuver tests)  Hypothesis B: The mechanism of symptomatic reduction of NK in PD is both augmented mitochondrial metabolism (direct, rapid) and augmented neurotransmitter and growth factor synthesis (indirect, delayed), especially GABA and dopamine, as assessed by [CONTACT_316366], phase coherence, and M1 waveform normalization. Accordingly, effect sizes for exploratory outcomes will be greater at 3 weeks than 7 days. Exploratory outcomes daily (days 1-7), week 3 ON/OFF time (daily subjective worksheets), keto-induction symptoms (daily worksheets or self-report), UPDRS-III motor score, MN and PQ keyboard tasks, simple and complex reaction time, 9-hole pegboard test, 3-back recall, Stroop word color interference and latency, tremor amplitude, heart rate variability heart rate variability (SDNN, pNN50, rMSSD, power spectral analysis). Exploratory outcomes day 1, 7, and week 3: Valsalva Maneuver and deep breathing cardiovagal tests), plasma BDNF, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), EEG sensorimotor spectral power (Hall et al, 2014) and M1 waveform peak:trough asymmetry (Voytek and Cole, 2017).   As an effect of the intervention at three weeks, there is expected to be decrease in EEG beta power on the more affected hemisphere clinically, relating to attenuation of pathologic pallidal GABA efferents to a greater extent than at [ADDRESS_389272] on depression symptoms is unclear but reduction is proposed. 9.2    SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION Power analysis was performed based second outcome, TUG score, rather than feasibility outcome due to clinical significance of the former for both mobility and fall risk that is felt to be an important justification for this intervention as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], whereas feasibility ascertainment does not justify the study but merely indicates lack of existing clinical use of this ketogenic diet protocol.

Protocol version date 04/19/2021 Considering range of TUG tests reported in Parkinson’s Disease off dopaminergic medication of 8-17s (Foreman 2011), mean of 10-15s with SD 2.15-3.7s (Foreman 2011, Brusse 2005, Dal Bello-Haas 2011), and association of 1s increase in TUG time with 5.4% increase in odds of reporting a fall (Nocera 2013), it is suggested that fall rate can be reduced by 20% with a 4s reduction in TUG time, which is therefore considered to be a clinically meaningful difference. Minimal detectable change is reported as 4.85s (Dal Bello-Haas 2011) and 3.5s (Huang 2011).  Based on these studies, the difference of 4.5s between the group means, which was considered as clinically important, and standard deviation (SD) of 4s (or effect size of 1.125) were used for power analysis. A two-sample t-test was applied to estimate sample size by [CONTACT_316367], TUG, followed normal distributions, and the variances of the two groups were equal. Power analysis indicated that a total of 28 subjects, 14 per group, will be needed to achieve a power of 80% to detect the difference of 4.5s at significant level of 0.0492. The sample size calculation considered one planned interim analysis scheduled to be conducted when [ADDRESS_389273] completed. Using O'Brien-Fleming approach, the interim analysis will be conducted with bound, p=0.0054 (t-value=3.287, df=16) and final analysis with bound p=0.0492 (t-value=2.06, df=26).  By [CONTACT_310697] 10% dropout rate, we will need to recruit a total of 32 subjects (16 per group).   Randomization Stratified randomization method will be used to control the covariates of age (<=65 vs.  >65) and TUG baseline score (>=11.5s, vs. <11.5s Nocera 2013). With these two covariates, there are 4 possible block combinations (TUG<=11.5s & age<=65, TUG<=11.5s & age>65, TUG>11.5s and age<=65, TUG>11.5s & age>65).    9.3    POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  32 subjects randomized to either ketosis diet or a low fat (standard American) diet 9.[ADDRESS_389274] on the TUG score, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed with age and TUG score at day [ADDRESS_389275]: baseline day 1 vs. day 7 (inpatient) vs. 3 weeks (outpatient) of the intervention, and between subject-effect (diet): ketogenic diet vs. standard American diet.   9.4.[ADDRESS_389276]

However, re-consent may be necessary and there is a possibility, though unlikely, that subjects could become decisionally impaired. For this reason and because there is a prospect of direct benefit from research participation (section 2.3.3), all subjects will be offered the opportunity to fill in their wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH Advance Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form so that another person can make decisions about their medical care in the event that they become incapacitated or cognitively impaired during the course of the study. Note: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_62494](ACAT) for evaluation as needed for the following: an independent assessment of whether an individual has the capacity to provide consent; assistance in identifying and assessing an appropriate surrogate when indicated; and/or an assessment of the capacity to appoint a surrogate. For those subjects that become incapacitated and do not have pre-determined substitute decision maker, the procedures described in NIH HRPP SOP 14E for appointing a surrogate decision maker for adult subjects who are (a) decisionally impaired, and (b) who do not have a legal guardian or durable power of attorney, will be followed.  10.2 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause.

Background and Study Rationale  
1 Introduction  
 
This study will be conducted in full accordance with all applicable University of Pennsylvania Research Policies and Procedures and all applicable Federal and state laws and regulations including [as applicable include the following regulations as they apply 45 CFR 46, 21 CFR Parts 50, 54, 56 All epi[INVESTIGATOR_48478].]  
 The purpose of the study is to use 3D imaging to evaluate the effects of four FDA approved neuromodulator s on facial lines, wrinkles and animation. Participation is available to women who have 
never  had a cosmetic procedure above the malar region nor a treatment with a neuromodulator  with in 12 
months . All subjects will undergo 3D imaging using the VECTRA M3 (Canfield Scientific, Inc, Fairfield, 
NJ) prior to treatment with a neuromodulator  in order to determine their baseline dimensions. Imaging 
will be repeated post injection to determine change  over time . 
 
1.1 Background and Relevant Literature  
 With an annual rise and over 845% increase since the year 2000, botulinum  toxin neuromodulation is the 
most commonly performed minimally invasive technique in cosmetic surgery [1]. In accordance, much 
research has been produced evaluating the characteristics and efficacy of the various toxin -strain 
modalities currently available for use [2 -4].  
 One such method for evaluation involves 3D photogrammetry. This technology involves for high level feature enhancement and microscopic anatomical evaluation that was not previously possible [5]. 3D photogrammetry has been used for a range of studies in cosmetic and reconstructive medicine and surgery, including its use in evaluating  minimally invasive injection efficacy [6 -8]. 
 
Glabella 4 Toxin  Study   Page 6 
Version: [ADDRESS_293689] been clinically described [8]. 
More recently , a new er neuromodulator , PrabotulinumtoxinA , has received FDA approval , although few 
studies have captured its onset and effect  compared to currently available neuromodulator s [9]. We aim to 
assess onset and  quantify the efficacy of four  neuromodulator s to help determine  appropriate treatment  
selection.  
 
[ADDRESS_293690] is to quantify the dynamic strain of  four commonly available neuromodulator s 
using 3D imaging as well as other potential physical measurements  differences over time .  
 
2.1 Primary Objective  
To compare the efficacy of four commonly available neuromodulators using 3D imaging to quantify 
dynamic  strain measurements  
3 Investigational Plan  
3.1 General Design  
 
This study is a randomized controlled trial in which patients will be randomly assigned into one of four 
groups: those receiving  onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox, Allergan, Irvine, [LOCATION_004]), abobotulinumtoxinA  
(Dysport, Ispen Biopharmacueticals Inc.Cambridge, MA), incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin, Raleigh, NC) 
or prabotulinumtoxinA (Jeuveau, Evolus, Newport Beach, [LOCATION_004]) .  Each patient will receive FDA 
approved dosages  in which they are assigned in  to treat rhytids within  the glabella, as per FDA approved 
indications. All injections will be performed by a blinded single trained physician (Ivona Percec) 
according to a preset injection plan per FDA approved administration guidelines. Prior to injection patients will be imaged with 3 -dimensional photogrammetry. All pre -procedure images will be evaluated 
for absolute strain performing two types of facial animation: 1) relaxed , and 2) frowning. Subjects will 
return Day 3, 30, 90, and 180, post intervention for re -imaging with the same expressions. Strain will be 
calculated using the same metrics.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_293691] at the pre- determined time points will be obtained using the 
VECTRA M3 (Canfield Scientific, Inc., Fairfield, NJ) , This allows for dynamic measurements of facial 
strain. Each subject's face will be measured along lines of tension when the face is in the relaxed and then frowning. Each facial animation will be recorded as an image. Three -dimensional coordinates will be 
Glabella 4 Toxin  Study   Page 7 
Version: [ADDRESS_293692] ’s topographic configuration, displacement, and surface strain of each 
detected point on the surface of the face relative to its original reference image.  
 
3.4 Study Endpoints  
3.4.1 Primary Study Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is to quantify the change in dynamic  strain of the glabella area after  injection of 
four neuromodulator s using 3D facial imaging measurements  over time .  
3.4.2 Secondary Study Endpoints  
1) Quantify the change in the dynamic strain of the glabella area after injection between the four 
neuromodulator s  
2) Quantify the change  of dynamic strain measurements of each facial animation over time.  
 3) Correlation of satisfaction as determined by [CONTACT_241887] -Q to the degree of dynamic  strain 
overtime  
[ADDRESS_293693]’s  participation time in the study will consist of the duration of 
the initial imaging session ( approximately 20 minutes), procedure ( 15 minutes), follow up imaging ( 20 
min).  
4.2 Total Number of Subjects and Sites  
 140 patients will be enrolled from at a single location, the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71971] .  
4.3 Inclusion Criteria  
• Female  
• 30-65 years of age  
• Interested in glabellar injections to reduce rhytids and facial strain  
• Participants must sign the informed consent form  
4.4 Exclusion Criteria  
• Females  under  30 or above 65 years of age  
• Males

 • Those who have received glabellar injections for rhytids  <12 months  
• Underwent cosmetic surgical procedure above the malar region  
• Those with a condition that affects facial expression, such as prior stroke  
4.[ADDRESS_293694] Recruitment  
 
Patients will be recruited through the plastic surgery  clinic, which is a high- volume practice for those who 
may be interested in cosmetic injections.  Additionally, we plan to use of a f lyer posted throughout the 
health system and campus. Injections to the glabellar region to reduce rhytids are a popular procedure and we do not anticipate significant difficulty  in recruiting willing participants.  
4.6 Vulnerable Populations:  
Children, pregnant women, fetuses, neonates, or prisoners are not i ncluded in this research study.

5.2 Study Intervention or Observational Phase  
Randomized Controlled Single Blinded Study  
5.2.1 Visit 1 (sometimes referred to as the baseline visit)  
 
Visit [ADDRESS_293696] will be photographed using 3D imaging with multiple facial animations . All pre -
procedure images will be evaluated for absolute strain performing two types of facial animation: 1) relaxed , 2) frowning. Following the  baseline images, subjects will complete a FACE -Q questionnaire and 
then randomized to one of the four neuromodulator s onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox, Allergan, Irvine, 
[LOCATION_004]), abobotulinumtoxinA  (Dysport, Ispen Biopharmacueticals Inc.Cambridge, MA) , 
incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin, Raleigh, NC)  or PrabotulinumtoxinA (J euveau, Evolus, Newport Beach, 
[LOCATION_004]) according to a preset injection plan per FDA approved administration guidelines. The injector will be blinded to the neuromodulator  assigned to the subject via randomization at the time of injection in 
order to decrease any underlying bias  during drug administration.  The syringes will be documented and 
prepared by [CONTACT_65384].

6 Statistical Plan  
6.1 Sample Size and Power Determination  
The sample size is based on a previously successful study with the same purpose [1], and an anticipated 
15% drop- out/withdrawal rate.  Significant decrease in the dynamic strain in Ona botulinumtoxinA and 
AbobotulinumtoxinA  were determined at day 4, 14, and [ADDRESS_293703] intervention compared to baseline.  We 
are increasing the patient population to account for a potential increase drop out due to the number of 
follow -up visits.

 7 Safety and Adverse Events  
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_241890]:  
 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use if a drug in humans 
whether or not considered drug related.  
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event 
 Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5108].   All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non -serious 
adverse events .  
7.[ADDRESS_293706], the investigator will seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study intervention 
Glabella 4 Toxin  Study   Page 13

 or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study 
period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study intervention or study participation will 
be recorded and reported immediately.  
7.3 Relationship of AE to Study  
The relationship of each adverse event to the study procedur es should be characterized. The  PI [INVESTIGATOR_241881]:  
• likely related  – a well- known effect of the device or clearly not related to the subject or environmental 
factors  
• probably related – is known or suspected effect of device or cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_241891]   
• possibly related – is a possible effect of  the device or can be explained by [CONTACT_241892]  
• unlikely related – is not a suspected effect of the device or can readily be explained by [CONTACT_241893]   
• unrelated – is not a known effect of the device and can readily be readily and easily explained by [CONTACT_241894]  
7.4 Reporting of Adverse Events, Adverse Device Effects and Unanticipated Problems  
Investigators and the protocol sponsor (which may or may not be a Penn Investigator) must conform to 
the adverse event reporting timelines, formats and requirements of the various entities to which they are responsible,  
 If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the time of the initial report includes:  
• Study identifier  
• Study Center  
• Subject number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  • Current status  
• Whether study intervention was discontinued  
• The reason why the event is classified as 
serious  
• Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study intervention 
 
 Additionally , all other events (unanticipated problems, adverse reactions, unanticipated adverse device 
effects and subject complaints will be recorded and reported with respect to institutional and federal policies.   
 
7.4.1 Follow -up report  
If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that changes the 
investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow -up report including all relevant new or reassessed 
information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) should be submitted to the IRB. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAE are followed until either resolved or stable.

 7.4.2 Investigator reporting: notifying the study sponsor  
Investigators from all participating sites should report all unexpected and related adverse events, 
regardless of whether they are serious or not, and all unanticipated problems to the sponsor. 
 
Any study- related unanticipated problem posing risk to subjects or others, and any type of serious adverse 
event, will be reported to the study sponsor by [CONTACT_16470] 24 hours of the event.  To report such events, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form will be completed by [CONTACT_241895] 24 hours.  The investigator will keep a copy of this SAE form on file at the study 
site.  Report serious adverse events by [CONTACT_241896]:  [Evolus ., Company Call Center:  1- 877-
EVOLUS1 (1 -[PHONE_5047]), Company Email:  [EMAIL_4659] ] 
 
Within the following [ADDRESS_293707] the 
understanding of the event.  Significant new information on ongoing serious adverse events should be 
provided promptly to the study sponsor. 
7.4.3 Investigator reporting: notifying the Penn IRB  
For single and multi- site studies each site PI [INVESTIGATOR_241882].   
7.4.4 Sponsor reporting: Notifying Participating Investigators  
For clinical trials, in addition to reporting certain unanticipated problems and adverse events noted above 
to the FDA, it is the responsibility of the study sponsor to report those same adverse events or findings to participating investigators.  
7.5 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above. The lead PI [INVESTIGATOR_241883].   
7.[ADDRESS_293708] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.

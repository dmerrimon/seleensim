[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
September  2021  
 
 
Version Number  11, September 2021    VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1133902] not improved.  We posit 
that to improve treatment outcomes for older adults with chronic low back pain (CLBP – back pain that has 
been present on at least half the days for at least 6 months), the condition should be approached as a 
syndrome, that is, a final common pathway for the expression of many contributors, in the same way that geriatricians approach the evaluation and treatment of delirium and falls.  Using this model, the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_818649] a weak link, but is rarely the sole treatment target.  Conditions that commonly contribute to pain 
and disability in older adults with CLBP include hip osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, anxiety, maladaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
and myofascial pain, each of which is associated with specific evidence- based treatments.  Because such 
conditions are not routinely evaluated in patients with CLBP, it is perhaps not surprising that first line 
treatments that do not specifically target multiple contributors (e.g. spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]- focused physical therapy and 
analgesics) often provide suboptimal treatment outcomes.  This often results in continued treatment -seeking 
including potentially toxic medications and invasive, expensive, and potentially life- threatening procedures 
such as complex spi[INVESTIGATOR_61680].  
 
The central question that the proposed randomized trial is designed to answer is: What is the efficacy of caring 
for older adults with CLBP in Aging Back Clinics ( ABC), where the patient is first treated as an older adult, and 
second as a patient with CLBP,  compared with usual care (UC)?  We have developed evidence and expert -
opi[INVESTIGATOR_818650] [ADDRESS_1133903].  
 
About 450 Veterans  age 65- 89 with CLBP will be recruited from primary care provider practices at 3 VAs –  VA 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_108710], VA  Greater Los Angeles , and Richmond VA  to meet a target randomization of 
310.  Individuals will be randomized to receive either ABC care  or UC and they will be followed for one year. 
Those in ABC care  will be referred to a generalist (e.g., geriatrician, physiatrist, rheumatologist) that has been 
identified and trained in a structured assessment to identify the conditions for which evidence and expert 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]- based algorithms have been created.  Usual care will not be constrained.  Outcomes will be assessed 
at baseline and over the telephone at  up to  three later time points:  3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 
months.  Health Care Utilization will be assessed monthly. Gait speed, a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in older adults, will be measured at baseline.  The proposed clinical trial has the potential not only to improve pain- related disability, but also to reduce morbidity, increase quality of life , and limit healthcare 
utilization.

Phone: 205- 348-[ADDRESS_1133913] common reasons that United 
States Veterans  seek medical care,18 and approximately half of these patients are age 65 and older.19  The 
prevalence of low back pain in those 85+, the most vulnerable and fastest growing segment of society, is 
estimated at 44%.20  Chronic low back pain (CLBP, i.e., exists on at least half the days for at least 6 months4) 
is associated with the overwhelming majority of low back pain- associated healthcare resource utilization and 
personal suffering, including physical disability, depression, anxiety, insomnia, cognitive dysfunction, loss of sleep and appetite, and social isolation.
21-23  In older Veterans  (i.e., > age 65), physical and emotional suffering 
may be compounded by a heightened risk of iatrogenic adversity associated with commonly employed interventions such as spi[INVESTIGATOR_307844], surgery, and potentially toxic medications (e.g., gastrointestinal 
bleeding and renal failure with nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, falls and hip fractures with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]
24). And, 
while substantial resources continue to target treating patients with back pain, treatment outcomes have 
remained stagnant.3 What accounts for this healthcare crisis? 
Lumbar Spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]- T argeted CLBP Treatment .  When evaluating patients with CLBP, spi[INVESTIGATOR_818653] x -
rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not recommended because they have not improved care.25,26 
But the utilization of spi[INVESTIGATOR_818654] (e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_818655], 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_61691]) for patients with CLBP has continued to skyrocket.3 This approach often is not helpful for older 
Veterans  because degenerative disease of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (e.g., degenerative disc and facet disease, 
bulging discs) identified with imaging is nearly ubiquitous in people age 65 and older, even in those who are pain- free.
1  An estimated 1 in 5 pain- free older adults also has moderate to severe lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_818656].2   
If we attempt to manage the older adult with CLBP solely using spi[INVESTIGATOR_321728], there may be one of three 
results: 1) In the best -case scenario, the physical cause of pain is identified and the appropriately targeted 
treatment is prescribed (e.g., severe central canal stenosis is identified and decompressive laminectomy 
results in reduction of pain and disability) ; 2) Pathology is identified that may be incidental (e.g., asymptomatic 
central canal stenosis, bulging discs, degenerative disc disease) but the cause(s) of pain and disability lies outside of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (e.g., sacroiliac joint syndrome [SIJS], myofascial pain of the erector spi[INVESTIGATOR_818657], hip OA), thus treatment may be misdirected; 3) Spi[INVESTIGATOR_818658], when 
combined with biopsychosocial factors outside of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (e.g., anxiety, depression, fear avoidance 
beliefs, insomnia, fibromyalgia syndrome [FMS], hip OA), adds to CLBP and further disability results. If our 
treatment targets only degenerative spi[INVESTIGATOR_818659], suboptimal outcomes are likely.  That is, 
imaging- directed treatment failures in older Veterans  with CLBP may relate to the treatments being spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-
centered rather than patient -centered.  
Non-specific CLBP Treatment .  Some providers practice at the opposite end of the spectrum.  Instead of 
prescribing treatment that targets spi[INVESTIGATOR_158449], they approach CLBP as a generic condition.  As previously mentioned,  “non-specific low back pain” is a commonly used term defined as low back pain that is not 
attributable to a recognizable, known specific spi[INVESTIGATOR_158449] (e.g., infection, tumor, spi[INVESTIGATOR_131726], structural deformity, inflammatory disorder) or associated with radiculopathy/spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078]
.25,[ADDRESS_1133914] line treatment 
Version Number  11, September 2021    VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 8 of 34 
 involves physical therapy and/or oral analgesics, an approach that typi[INVESTIGATOR_818660].28 This approach fails to acknowledge the commonly occurring specific contributors to CLBP 
and back pain -related disability in older adults that cannot be detected on spi[INVESTIGATOR_818661] a 
variety of evidence- based treatments such as hip osteoarthritis29, fibromyalgia30, and depression.31 
The 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline on Acute, Subacute and Chronic Low Back Pain from the American College of Physicians (ACP) approach CLBP as a non- specific condition and recommend “treatment with 
nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first -line therapy” for patients “who have had an inadequate 
response to nonpharmacologic therapy.”
28  Even these recent guidelines fail to acknowledge that NSAIDs are 
very cautiously recommended for chronic use in older adults because these drugs risk causing renal 
insufficiency, gastrointestinal bleeding, and other adverse events.24 The guidelines also recommend initial 
treatment of CLBP with multidisciplinary rehabilitation (MR) as one non- pharmacological option based on 
moderate quality evidence28, even though these programs are characterized by [CONTACT_818707], 
making them inaccessible to many older Veterans , especially those who are physically and/or cognitively frail. 
Evidence indicates that while MR improves function, it is only modestly effective in reducing pain intensity 
32, one of the key outcomes that our patients value.    As noted above, older adults with CLBP can 
have many physical contributors to their pain33 that have specific evidence- based pain treatments and may not 
be included in MR programs, as these programs tend to be group based, not individualized.  Thus, 
approaching CLBP as a non- specific condition is fraught with limitations that result in suboptimal outcomes for 
many older adults.  
How can we redirect the evaluation and treatment of older adults with CLBP to result in better 
outcomes? To answer this question, we started by [CONTACT_818708][INVESTIGATOR_11437] 
(PTs) and a geriatrician/ rheumatologist whose practices focused on chronic pain management.  The panel’s task was to identify common categories of physical pathology in older adults with CLBP that were not 
being treated because they were overlooked or  misdiagnosed  by [CONTACT_119380].  Four categories 
were identiﬁed: myofascial pain (MP), ﬁbromyalgia, sacroiliac joint syndrome (SIJS), and hip disease.
33  We 
developed protocols to identify these conditions and established the feasibility of training providers in their 
recognition.33  We found that MP exists in 96% of older adults with CLBP, SIJS in 84%, hip disease in 24%, 
and fibromyalgia in 19%. Eighty -two percent had multiple conditions 33, none diagnosed with spi[INVESTIGATOR_321728], 
but all detectable during a thorough history and physical exam.  
This work validated our clinical observations of the multiple physical contributors to CLBP  in older 
adults that were being missed with spi[INVESTIGATOR_321728].  We then took the next step toward facilitating practice change, recognizing the need to break down specialty silos .  We collaborated with 42 providers (9 PCPs and 
33 pain/pain- related experts [chiropractic, geriatric medicine, neuropsychology, occupational therapy, pain 
medicine, pharmacology, physiatry, physical therapy, psychiatry, psychology, rheumatology, sleep medicine]), to gather and evaluate the wealth of evidence scattered within specialty literature, often inaccessible to many 
providers.  The 42 -member panel used a modified Delphi process to synthesize existing evidence and 
develop a set of 12 algorithms that guide the systematic evaluation and safe treatment of key physical and non-physical contributors to pain and disability in older adults with CLBP.  The 12                                              
                                                                                                                      
conditions are: a) those that cause CLBP directly (i.e., hip osteoarthritis66, fibromyalgia30, myofascial pain67, 
SIJS68, leg length discrepancy54, lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078] [LSS]69); b) those that impair an individual’s ability to 
modulate pain and compound CLBP -associated disability (i.e., anxiety and/or depression21, insomnia23, 
maladaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] [i.e., fear avoidance beliefs70 and pain catastrophizing71], dementia72);  and c) those 
associated with leg pain not caused by [CONTACT_818709][INVESTIGATOR_818662] (i.e., greater 
trochanteric pain syndrome73, myofascial pain74). Each of these conditions, except LSS, cannot be detected 
on spi[INVESTIGATOR_818661] a variety of evidence- based treatments, per Table 1.  Thus, evaluating 
and treating these conditions can prevent unnecessary and ineffective  care.  The protocols we developed 
are the foundation of the Aging Backs Clinic (ABC) arm of the proposed trial (Appendix 5). ABC care 
approaches the older adult with CLBP, first as an older adult, and second as a patient with chronic pain.   CLBP is approached as a geriatric syndrome, i.e., a final common pathway for the expression of multiple 
contributors
5 rather than a disease isolated to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_283958] a non- specific condition.  That is, we conceptualize 
the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_818663], but not the sole treatment target.

Figure 1. VA Stepped Pain Care75 ABCs and the VA Stepped Pain Care Model .  In 1998 the Veterans  Health Administration launched their 
Pain Management Strategy in response to the growing number of Veterans  with pain and the associated 
personal and financial burden.  The overarching objective of the Strategy was to develop a “ comprehensive, 
multicultural, integrated, systemwide approach to pain management that reduces pain and suffering for 
Veterans  experiencing acute and chronic pain associated with a wide range of illnesses including pain at the 
end of life.”75 To guide implementation of the Strategy, in 2009 the VA Stepped Pain Care model was 
published, shown in Figure 1.75 This model calls for “assessment and management of health problems via low 
intensity interventions followed by [CONTACT_818710], specialized, and individually tailored 
approaches if persons do not maximally benefit from less intensive efforts.”75 ABC care aligns with the VA 
Stepped Pain Care model and is guided by [CONTACT_818711]’s individual pain contributors. It 
conceptually straddles Step 1 and Step 2 in 
Figure 1, and incorporates comprehensive 
screening, assessment and management of 
important conditions contributing to CLBP and 
disability, with as needed referrals to other 
specialists, depending on the patient’s individual pain contributors. Depending on the 
Veteran’s response to initial treatments and 
their physical/cognitive stamina, 
interdisciplinary pain clinic referral (Step 3) 
also may be offered.  The flexibility of the 
ABC approach affords truly patient -
centered care.  Additional details about ABC 
operations are provided in the Research 
Design and Methods section.  
The Proposed Study.  The goal of the proposed clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of ABC care as 
compared with that of Usual Care (UC) for older Veterans  with CLBP.  The preparatory work that we have 
conducted to establish the foundation for this trial is presented in the Preliminary Studies section below.   
 PRELIMINARY STUDIES  
Standardization of ABC Clinic Treatments . Our first pi[INVESTIGATOR_818664] & 
Development (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] #1) resulted in the creation of the 12 CLBP algorithms referenced in the Background and Significance section.  An interdisciplinary expert panel (EP) created each algorithm and accompanying 
materials (i.e., tables outlining stepped care medication management and rationale for individual components 
of the algorithm with supportive references).  A 9- member panel of experienced PCPs, including VA providers, 
reviewed the materials, focusing on feasibility of implementation in the VA.  The EP modified the algorithms 
based on PCP feedback and the process continued until no revisions were recommended.  
All algorithms have these common elements: 1) supportive literature evidence and, when lacking, EP consensus; 2) imaging only to confirm pathology suspected on history and physical examination (e.g., 
American College of Rheumatology clinical criteria for hip OA required before ordering hip x -rays); 3) emphasis 
on self -management; 4) patient -provider collaborative decision making; 5) stepped -care management that 
acknowledges specific vulnerabilities in older adults (e.g., avoiding medications in Beers’ criteria for potentially 
inappropriate medications in older adults
24, prescribing a walker instead of pain medications or an invasive 
procedure for the frail older adult with neurogenic claudication).  As shown in Table 1, most of the conditions 
are associated with strong evidence- based treatments that have been incorporated into each of the algorithms.  
[CONTACT_818741], former Director of Pain Management for the Veterans  Health Administration, endorsed the 
importance of our work (see letter of support); each algorithm has been published along with an illustrative case in Pain Medicine, the official journal of the American Academy of Pain Medicine (Appendix 5).

 Feasibility of Training Providers in Evaluating CLBP Conditions. In Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] #1, four  providers ([ADDRESS_1133915] with a large older adult patient panel) 
were trained in the structured physical assessment (Appendix 6) to ascertain the presence of hip OA, leg 
length discrepancy (LLD), myofascial pain (MP), sacroiliac joint syndrome (SIJS), and lateral hip/thigh pain 
(LHP – e.g., greater trochanteric pain syndrome), and a 
structured history to screen for lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078]. After 
two training sessions (separated in time by ~ 1 month), all 
providers were confident in their ability to perform the 
physical assessment for the conditions listed above (hip OA, 
LLD, MP, SIJS, LHP) and immediately began incorporating 
their newfound skills into the care of their own patients.  Providers uniformly felt empowered in their ability to educate 
their patients about the contributors to their CLBP and felt 
that patients were more satisfied with their encounter than 
they had been previously.  Specific provider comments 
included, “I find seeing these patients fun now!” “I was so 
excited that I was able to identify the cause of the patient’s 
pain!” “ These protocols have given me a way to offer my 
patients options other than sending them for potentially 
harmful procedures…Many of them are getting better!”   
These data, although associated with a small sample size, underscore the feasibility and potential value of training 
providers in the structured CLBP physical exam that helps to guide ABC care.  
Clinical Profile of Older Veterans  w
 ith CLBP . In Pi[INVESTIGATOR_56548] #1, a research coordinator at each site administered 
questionnaires to screen for non -musculoskeletal CLBP 
contributors, specifically, the PHQ -[ADDRESS_1133916] participants, 
88%, had at least one physical contributor; 60% had at least 
one non- physical contributor (i.e., depression, anxiety, 
maladaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] [either catastrophizing or fear avoidance beliefs], or insomnia); and the majority (86.3%) had both physical and non -physical contributors.  These data 
highlight the validity of the comprehensive approach that will be applied in the ABC arm of the proposed trial.

Figure 2.  Status of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] #2  Feasibility of Recruitment and Implementation 
of ABC Care :  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] #2 funded by [CONTACT_818712] & Development is being 
conducted to evaluate the feasibility of 
recruitment and implementation of ABC care. 
Electronic medical records of Veterans  age 65- [ADDRESS_1133917] an MRI 
within 30 days, were reviewed for eligibility 
(absence of red flags/need for urgent and 
specialized treatment; no prior lumbar surgery; cognitively intact) at VAPHS and the Richmond 
VA.  The results are summarized in Figure 2. A ll 
[ADDRESS_1133918] been enrolled. They are 96% male, age 68.7 + 8.2, 28% black, with an 
average back pain intensity 6.4 + 1.6 and 
average pain duration 5.7 + 0.[ADDRESS_1133919] been no 
dropouts and no adverse events. Data on CLBP 
contributors were collected using methods 
identical to that of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] #1.  The clinical 
profile of participants was: 4.2% had only one contributor to their CLBP, 79.2% had two or more physical 
contributors, 20.8% had two or more non -physical contributors, and 66.7% had at least one physical and at 
least one non- physical contributor. In this Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we recruited Veterans  with a recent lumbar MRI because such 
imaging can lead to a cascade of events that do not result in improved outcomes.81  As per Figure 2, this 
strategy resulted in excluding the majority of potential older Veteran participants with CLBP.  To optimize the generalizability of findings associated with the proposed clinical trial, we do not require imaging as a prerequisite to participating.  This revised strategy is also consistent with clinical guidelines, as highlighted in 
Background and Significance. 
To ascertain the feasibility of the revised (no imaging required) recruitment strategy, we 
reviewed 100 randomly selected charts at each site from among the total available pool (i.e., 
those available for pre- screening).   As shown in 
Table 3, data pulled from our [ADDRESS_1133920] 12 months revealed 17,235 
Veterans  age 65 -89 with a diagnosis of low 
back pain and who had seen their PCP within the prior 6 months ( 7,486  from Los Angeles , 
4,739 from Pi[INVESTIGATOR_216824] 5,010 from Richmond). Pre -screening excluded 40 % at Los 
Angeles , 50% at Richmond, and 39% at VAPHS.   The most 
common reason for ineligibility across sites was prior spi[INVESTIGATOR_84017] (60 % of those excluded at Los Angeles , 34% of 
those excluded at Richmond, and 38% of those excluded at 
VAPHS).   Total numbers available for on- site assessment 
following telephone screening and those eligible following on-site assessment were calculated based on Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] #2 
(Figure 2) and the results are shown in Table 3. Thus, we 
expect to easily meet our recruitment goals of 55 participants 
per site per year.

Educating and Screening Older Veterans  for CLBP Contributors.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] #[ADDRESS_1133921] 
from the VA Pi[INVESTIGATOR_108710] (VAPHS) Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center.  This 
funding supported the development of Take Back Your Back (TBB), an interactive tablet -based tool for older 
adults with CLBP.  This tool takes ~7 -10 minutes to complete and is designed to be self -administered prior to 
the patient undergoing CLBP evaluation by [CONTACT_263235] (e.g., in the waiting room or waiting in the physical exam room).  Specifically, the tool:   
1) Educates patients  about realistic treatment expectations; the multifactorial biopsychosocial nature of 
CLBP; the role of imaging, injections, and analgesics in managing CLBP; and the risks associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], muscle relaxants and NSAIDs.

2) Screens for key CLBP contributors  – Anxiety and 
depression are screened with the PHQ482 and 
insomnia is screened with a single item:   In the past 7 days, my sleep quality was: very poor/ poor/ fair/ 
good/very good.
4  Fibromyalgia is screened with the 
fibromyalgia survey83; fear avoidance beliefs (FAB) 
and/or catastrophizing4, as indicators of maladaptive 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], by [CONTACT_818713]: Do you agree with the following 
statements? – ‘I feel that my back pain is terrible and 
it’s never going to get any better (an affirmative 
response suggests catastrophizing);’ ‘It’s not really 
safe for a person with my back problem to be physically active (an affirmative response suggests FAB).  
We screen for possible hip OA with the question, ‘Do you have pain in one or both of your hips?’ The 
presence of leg symptoms precipi[INVESTIGATOR_818665] a possible indicator of lumbar 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_818666].  
3) Encourages the patient to communicate with their  healthcare provider.  For example, if the patient 
screens positive for fear -avoidance beliefs by [CONTACT_182755] “yes” to the question: Do you agree with the 
following statement? - ‘I feel that my back pain is 
terrible and it’s never going to get any better,’ a pop-up will appear, per Figure 3, encouraging the 
patient to discuss this concern with their 
healthcare provider.  As described in the Research 
Design and Methods section, a summary screen of 
the Veteran’s responses will be given to the 
healthcare provider and this will facilitate targeting of their history and physical examination.  That is, 
while TBB will screen for key conditions, its 
purpose is not to diagnose.  Additional details 
about TBB that relate to its incorporation into the 
proposed trial are provided in the Research 
Design and Methods section.  
We have conducted three rounds of usability testing with 
TB
B in 15 older adults (mean age 71.7, range 60- 88 + 
7.9) with CLBP (81% Veterans ). Each round had [ADDRESS_1133922] iterative usability testing methods.84  The 
reading level of TBB is at a Flesch -Kincaid Grade level 
of 6.9.  All participants voiced that the material was Table 5. Participant Feedback on “Take Back Your Back”

recommended.  A round of beta- testing (mean age 75.1, range 60 -86) was performed on an additional 30 
participants, 14 Veterans  and 16 non- Veterans . Noteworthy feedback from participants is shown in Table 5. 
Thus, this tool was very well received by [CONTACT_68847] .  Further, by [CONTACT_818714] (e.g., the 
research coordinator in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] #1) to screen for non -musculoskeletal CLBP contributors, it has the 
potential to efficiently facilitate translation of our research findings into clinical practice.  
 
Summary of Preliminary Studies . The studies described above lay the essential foundation for the 
proposed clinical trial. We have:  1) used a rigorous process to develop and publish 12 evaluation and 
treatment protocols for key conditions that contribute to CLBP and disability in older adults and these will be implemented in the ABC arm; 2) established the feasibility of training providers in the evaluation of musculoskeletal contributors; 3) validated the importance of comprehensive biopsychosocial 
assessment in older Veterans ; 4) developed an interactive patient self -report and education tool usable 
in the clinical setting; 5) examined the feasibility of conducting the trial (i.e., participant recruitment and intervention implementation).  These studies have prepared us to take the next important step, that is, 
to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to test the efficacy of a new approach to CLBP care for 
older Veterans  – Aging Back Clinics (ABCs). 
 
Inclusion of Vulnerable Subjects and Special Populations.  Vulnerable subjects will not be enrolled. 
Neither pregnant subjects nor women of childbearing potential will be included because we are 
targeting older adults with low back pain. Neither children nor prisoners will be included.  
3.0 Objectives  
 
SPECIFIC AIMS  
Degenerative disease of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (e.g., degenerative discs and facets, bulging discs) is ubiquitous in older adults, but low back pain is not.
1,2  Treatment that focuses exclusively on degenerative spi[INVESTIGATOR_818667], therefore, has resulted in rising costs and exposure to 
potentially life -threatening morbidity but not improved outcomes.3  We posit that to improve treatment 
outcomes for older adults with chronic low back pain (CLBP – back pain that has been present on at least 
half the days for at least 6 months4), the condition should be approached as a syndrome, that is, a final 
common pathway for the expression of many contributors.  Geriatricians evaluate and treat other 
syndromes , such as delirium and falls similarly, with good outcomes.5  When an older patient experiences 
delirium, a geriatrician doesn’t recommend brain surgery. Using this model, the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_818668] a weak link, but is rarely the sole treatment target.   Conditions that commonly contribute to pain and 
disability in older adults with CLBP such as hip osteoarthritis (OA), fibromyalgia, and depression, are 
associated with specific evidence- based treatments.   
 
PURPOSE AND HYPOTHESES  
The central question that the proposed randomized trial is designed to answer is: What is the efficacy of 
comprehensive patient -centered care of CLBP as a syndrome that is delivered in Aging Back 
Clinics (ABC), compared with usual care (UC)?  Through prior VA Rehabilitation Research & Development support, we have developed and published evidence and expert -opi[INVESTIGATOR_818669] 12 key contributors to pain and disability in older adults with CLBP – hip 
OA, fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078], sacroiliac joint syndrome (SIJS), leg length discrepancy, lateral hip/thigh pain, insomnia, depression, anxiety, maladaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and dementia.

Version Number  11, September 2021    VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1133925] patient care by [CONTACT_818715]. 
The proposed trial is designed to address the following aims:  
Aim 1: Establish the efficacy of ABC care compared to usual care.  
We hypothesize that those randomized to ABC care will have:  
H1.1: Greater 6 -month reductions in pain- related disability as measured by [CONTACT_481393] (ODI; 
primary outcome and endpoint);  
H1.2: Greater 12 -month reductions in ODI; and greater 6-  and 12 -month reductions in pain severity (by 
[CONTACT_93218] 29), quality of life (by [CONTACT_818716] [GH]); depressive and anxiety symptoms (by 
[CONTACT_93218] 29); and greater improvement in falls efficacy (by [CONTACT_818717] -International short form) ;  
H1.3: Less healthcare utilization between [ADDRESS_1133926] to emergency room visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], opi[INVESTIGATOR_93986], and invasive procedures performed (secondary outcomes and 
endpoints).  
Aim 2: Explore the heterogeneity of treatment efficacy of ABC care.  
H2.1: Those with greater baseline CLBP -associated disability, anxiety/depression, mild cognitive 
impairment, and/or obesity will reap greater benefits from ABC compared to UC (exploratory subgroup 
discovery).  
 Four hundred fifty  Veterans  age 65 -89 with CLBP , (for a targeted enrollment of 3 10), will be recruited from 
primary care provider (PCP) practices at 3 VAs –  VA Pi[INVESTIGATOR_108710], VA Greater Los 
Angeles , and Hunter Holmes McGuire (Richmond) VA.  Individuals will be randomized to receive either 
ABC care or UC, and they will be followed for one year.  Aging Back Clinics will be staffed by [CONTACT_51760] 
(e.g., geriatrics, pain medicine, rheumatology) that have been trained in evaluating and treating key CLBP 
conditions associated with our published evidence -based algorithms.  Usual care will not be constrained.  
Baseline measures will be assessed on site or on the telephone and include: Minimal Data Set 
recommended by [CONTACT_818718]
4; Oswestry Disability Index (ODI; 
main outcome)12; cognitive function (QMCI)13; PROMIS -29 that includes pain severity, pain -related activity 
interference, physical function, sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, leg symptoms14; quality of life with 
the PROMIS -GH scale15, participant opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] -related concerns with the Prescribed Opi[INVESTIGATOR_818670]16, gait speed, balance confidence with the Falls Efficacy Scale- International short form17; healthcare 
utilization over the prior month (e.g., pain medications, emergency room visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) will be assessed on site.  We will also be utilizing the Life Space Assessment
106 to measure the spatial extent of a 
participant’s mobility. Three, 6 -, up to 9-, and 12 -months outcomes (ODI, PROMIS 29 and GH, balance 
confidence, healthcare utilization, life space assessment and VR-12) will be assessed over the telephone 
by [CONTACT_818719]. While monthly, the 0- 10 Numerical  Pain Rating Scale, 
Medications  (pain medications monthly and all medications at baseline and final  follow- up), and Health 
Care Utilization will be measured.  The Global Impression of Change data measure will be administered 
only at the final phone follow up. The proposed clinical trial has the potential not only to improve pain-
related disability, but also to reduce morbidity, increase quality of life, and limit healthcare utilization.

 5.0 Study Procedures  
 
5.1 Study Design  
 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
The proposed clinical trial is designed to 
evaluate the efficacy of Aging Back Clinics 
(ABCs) that approach CLBP in older 
Veterans  as a geriatric syndrome,  that is, a 
final common pathway for the expression of multiple contributors, as compared with Usual Care (UC). In the context of the research 
proposed, ABCs are virtual 
interdisciplinary clinics  that are inserted 
within the stepped care model shown in 
Figure 4.  Veterans  without red flags 
requiring urgent attention are referred for 
ABC care that will be delivered by a 
specialist provider  that has been trained in 
use of the algorithms. Both ABC care and UC will be provided for up to12 months. Those with refractory symptoms may be referred for 
intensive interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation, 
depending on their availability and the Veteran’s capacity to participate.  Interventions for ABC care participants 
are numerous and vary depending on participants’ needs. These interventions include but are not limited to CBT, pharmacotherapy, physical therapy (PT), exercise therapy, analgesia, orthotics, injections, and 
acupuncture. One of the primary goals of ABC care is to avoid unnecessary and costly imaging and the risks 
associate with it, including unnecessary, ineffective, and potentially morbid surgeries.  
  
The conditions targeted by [CONTACT_818722] (hip OA
66, SIJS68, myofascial pain67, 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078]69, leg length discrepancy54); those that impair pain modulation, compound CLBP -
associated disability and that themselves can cause disability (fibromyalgia30, depression21, anxiety21, 
maladaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] [i.e., pain catastrophizing71 and/or fear avoidance beliefs70], insomnia23, dementia72); and 
those that can mimic radiculopathy (greater trochanteric pain syndrome73, myofascial pain74).  While our 
screening procedures exclude Veterans  with possible dementia (based on the Mini Mental State Examination), 
those with possible mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will be included.  As MCI  and dementia are on a 
continuum, providers may wish to apply elements of the published Dementia protocol to those that screened 
positive for MCI.    
Participants :   
About 450  Veterans  (150 from each site), age 65- 89 with chronic low back  pain (CLBP) will be recruited, (to 
target randomizing 310 participants), from the VA Pi[INVESTIGATOR_108710] (VAPHS), the VA Greater Los 
Angeles  Healthcare System ( Los Angeles, CA), and the Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center 
(Richmond VA). We anticipate the need to telephone screen ~ 1050 (i.e., ~ 175 per site per year) to obtain 450 
participants who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria. No one will be excluded on the basis of race, gender 
or ethnicity. Based upon the data from each of the three sites, we anticipate that our overall participant sample 
will be 97% male, 3% female, 2% Hispanic or Latino, 98% Not Hispanic or Latino, 1% American Indian/Alaskan 
Native, 0% Asian, 2% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 18% Black or African American, and 79% White or 
Caucasian. Non-Veterans  will not be recruited to participate. Vulnerable subjects will not be enrolled, including 
children and prisoners. Neither pregnant subjects nor women of childbearing potential will be included because 
we are targeting older adults with chronic LBP.

Costs and Payment:   
In order to compensate participants for their time, they will be paid $100 in total, with payments spaced out 
over 12 months. They will be paid $40 for their baseline visit and $30 for their final follow- up visit. A n additional 
$30 will be paid after their 6- month follow -up call.  
Participants will be paid by [CONTACT_818723], $100 in total, with payments spaced out over up to 12 months. They will be paid $40 for their baseline visit and $3 0 for their final follow- up visit. An additional 
$[ADDRESS_1133927] already received. Payments typi[INVESTIGATOR_818675] 10 days and two weeks 
to reach Veterans.  
 
 
5.2 Recruitment Methods 
 
Recruitment Procedures:   We will recruit [ADDRESS_1133928] used successfully for 
other VA clinical trials: 
1. We will request a waiver of informed consent to review the CPRS records of Veterans  age 65 -89 with a 
documented diagnosis of low back pain.  The research coordinator (RC) at each site will review records of 
potentially eligible Veterans  to ensure  the veteran has a primary care provider within the VA system and that 
they have seen their PCP within the past 6 months  for low back pain.  This pull of potential eligible 
participants will initially be extracted from the Corporate Data Warehouse by a study staff member.    
Potentially eligible V eterans will be mailed a letter signed by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a flyer or brochure describing 
the study (both of which will be IRB -approved).  If (s)he is interested in participating, (s)he will call the study 
research coordinator (RC), whose name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_818724]. In 
addition, [ADDRESS_1133929] successfully adopted this strategy in the 
context of our ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
2. We will re cruit directly from  clinics , at each local VA site,  using the following approaches: a) Site PIs will 
send email to the Providers in clinics  at their site to introduce the study.  b) Brochures will be delivered to 
clinic waiting rooms and to the Providers  themselves including those associated with Women’s Health 
Clinics. We will suggest that  Provider s keep brochures in their exam rooms for distribution to potentially 
eligible Veterans .  c) IRB -approved posters will be placed in exam rooms. d) Site PIs will deliver an 
educational presentation on CLBP for PCPs  and/or Providers  in the context of an existing conference, and 
study information with be provided at that time.  
3. The IRB -approved brochures will also be placed in waiting rooms of specialty clinics that commonly care for 
Veterans  with CLBP (e.g., orthopedics, neurosurgery, neurology, pain medicine). Interested Veterans  will 
call the RC to complete screening procedures.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1133930] both a waiver of HIPAA 
authorization and a waiver of Informed Consent so Research Coordinators (RC) may review CPRS records for 
potentially eligible participants. The information collected will have no PHI attached to it.  
At baseline, t he RC at each site will administe r the Informed Consent and HIPAA prior to study procedures. 
Ample time will be provided for questions and discussion. Subjects will be considered enrolled once they have 
provided written informed consent, and a copy of the signed Informed C onsent document will be provided to 
the participant . Before data collection begins, the RC will screen the participant for cognitive impairment with 
Version Number  11, September 2021    VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 18 of 34 
 the Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ). Participants who score less than 24 will be excluded, and their 
PCP will be alerted. Excluded participants will still be paid $40. Baseline data collection will begin at this time 
for eligible participants. Baseline data beyond the screening for cognitive impairment and gait speed test may 
be collected over the phone or on site.  
 
A progress note documenting consent will be placed in CPRS  after completion of baseline.  The signed 
Informed C onsent will be kept under double lock and key in the research staff members’ office and only the 
research staff will have access to these documents.  
Local site study personnel will be required to maintain active training in CITI for their Human Subjects 
Protections training courses. They will also be required to be listed as administers of informed consent 
at their local site.  
 
5.4 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
We are targeting older Veterans with CLBP, defined as pain in the lower back of at least moderate severity 
(assessed with a verbal rating scale), on > half the days for > [ADDRESS_1133931] be able to commit to up to 12 months of study participation. The Quick Mild 
Cognitive Impairment Screen (QMCI) will be administered on site to screen for mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI). Those with MCI will not be excluded , but their PCP will be alerted .   
 
Exclusion Criteria include:  
• Positive screen for dementia (score < 23 on the MMSE)  
• Pain in other body locations that is more severe than their low back pain 
• Red flags indicative of serious underlying illness requiring urgent care (e.g., fever, change in 
bowel/bladder function, sudden severe change in pain, unintentional weight loss, new lower extremity weakness)  
• Previous lumbar surgery  
• Acute illness  
• Psychotic symptoms  
• Prohibitive communication impairment (e.g., severe hearing or visual impairment)   
• Evidence of illicit substance abuse on urine drug screen at anytime in the past 6 months or active drug abuse documented by [CONTACT_48368]  
• Other (e.g. have moved out of state, are homebound, terminal illness, etc.)  
 Neither pregnant subjects nor women of childbearing potential will be included due to the age requirements of 
the study. Vulnerable subjects will not be enrolled, nor children and prisoners.  
 Research staff will recruit all participants . They will not use coercion of any kind.  
 
5.5 Study Evaluations  
 
Screening Procedures (Appendix 7) :  Telephone screening by [CONTACT_122440] (approved via a waiver of consent) 
using a structured questionnaire will determine participant eligibility, i.e., CLBP, ability to participate for up to 12 months, no red flags or prohibitive communication impairment, and no acute medical or psychiatric illness.  If 
the screening procedures indicate that the Veteran is eligible, (s)he will be invited to come in for on-site 
baseline testing. After the participant has signed the HIPAA and Informed Consent documents  they are 
considered enrolled. Then, the RC will administer the MMSE  and those who fail (i.e., screen positive for 
dementia with a score <24) will be excluded and their PCP notified. We use the MMSE because it has been 
Version Number  11, September 2021    VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 19 of 34 
 studied extensively, has good diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 0.85, specificity 0.9) and it takes only [ADDRESS_1133932] 
be collected on site (MMSE, gait speed, and Red Flags Screening by [CONTACT_48368]), the remaining may be 
collected over the telephone or on site.  
Baseline Testing  (Appendix 8)  - On all enrolled participants , RCs will collect a set of established measures 
that assess constructs relevant to older adults and have low participant burden, as shown in Table 6.  
1. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI):  Our main outcomes measure, the ODI assesses interference of 
pain with function.12  
2. The Minimal Data Set (MDS) , recommended by [CONTACT_818718] , 
measures pain severity and interference with daily activities, widespread pain, prior CLBP treatments, 
overall physical function, depressive symptoms, sleep, psychological maladaptation (i.e., fear -avoidance 
beliefs and catastrophizing), alcohol/drug use, cigarette smoking, demographics (age, race, ethnicity, gender, education, marital status), height and weight.
[ADDRESS_1133933] outcomes, and are relevant to older Veterans : 
a. Medical comorbidity will be measured by [CONTACT_6270] -report with the Duke comorbidity index.86 
b. Pain medications (regularly scheduled and as -needed) will be categorized into sub -classes:  a) 
salicylates (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] > 1200 mg/day, salsalate), b) non- aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], non- COX2 selective non- steroidal anti -
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), c) COX2 selective NSAIDs, d) acetaminophen, e) opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], f) skeletal 
muscle relaxants, g) adjunctive agents (e.g., corticosteroids, capsaicin).  Regularly scheduled opi[INVESTIGATOR_818676].87  
c.  Medications other than pain will be collected as well.  
d. Social support will be measured with the well- validated MOS Social Support Scale.88  
e. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_818677] (in those taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) with the Prescribed Opi[INVESTIGATOR_818670], a patient -centric instrument that assesses patient problems and concerns attributed to use of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].16 
f. Suicidality will be measured with a question from the PHQ 9: “Over the last [ADDRESS_1133934] you had 
thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself?” If the veteran responds affirmatively 
and the assessment is being conducted in person, the RC  will immediately notify the  site’s PI [INVESTIGATOR_818678]’s primary care provider and proceed with the VA suicide hotline protocol that includes a warm transfer to a VA mental health provider.  If the assessment is being conducted over 
the telephone, the RC will ask the Veteran to hold on and (s)he will immediately contact [CONTACT_7880] 
[INVESTIGATOR_818679]’s Suicide Threat Call Protocol will be followed.   
5. Quality of life  will be measured with the PROMIS -Global Health scale  (36) and the Veterans Rand 12 
Item Health Survey (VR -12) [ref].  
6. Balance confidence (i.e., confidence in avoiding falling) will be measured because of data supporting 
the relationship between pain and falls in older adults.
[ADDRESS_1133935] data on falls history during the quarterly follow- up calls (see below).  
8. Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment (QMCI) screen, a validated measure that screens for the presence of 
mild cognitive impairment, will be administered.13,[ADDRESS_1133936] methods.92 That is, participants will be asked to walk at their usual pace and from a 
standing start.  This will be measured twice and results expressed as the average over two trials.    
10. Life Space Assessment106 will be utilized to measure the spatial extent of a participant’s mobility.

separate randomization schedules for the 3 strata that contains a randomization sequence number (different 
from a participant's study identification number) and assigned arm.  Then he will create a series of sealed envelopes for each of the sites containing the treatment assignment but conspi[INVESTIGATOR_818681].  At the time of randomization, the overall RC based at the 
coordinating site will open the next available envelope specific for the participant’s site, and record the 
randomization sequence number, subject identification number and group assignment in a dedicated 
database, different from the main study database. She will then inform the RC at the participant’s site of their 
randomization group and the local RC will inform the participant of next steps .  Personnel assessing follow -up 
outcomes will be masked to intervention assignment (see Follow -Up below ). The study statistician has 
successfully employed the same process in other clinical trials.  
Intervention   
UC will not be constrained.  As a courtesy, participants who are randomized to UC will be offered the ability to 
see an ABC provider at their site (in person or virtually) after their completion of all study related procedures 
and the end of their up to [ADDRESS_1133939] used successfully in older adults (see below). 
We considered other control group designs, but chose not to for the following reasons: 1) Our clinical 
experience in delivering care to older Veterans  with CLBP in our pain clinics highlights that most patients with 
CLBP already have had and failed a trial of physical therapy ; thus, while we considered a control condition of 
physical therapy and analgesics, patients’ prior participation in physical therapy would threaten recruitment feasibility. 2) We considered physical therapy and analgesics for the control group, and altering our inclusion 
criteria; specifically , we considered including only Veterans  with “new onset” CLBP, e.g., back pain on most 
days for no more than the prior 12 months to reduce the likelihood of prior physical therapy ; had we used these 
criteria in our previously described pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], however, only [ADDRESS_1133940] qualified.  3) We 
considered recruiting patients from pain clinics, i.e., randomizing participants to either ABC care or Pain Clinic care, but t he numbers of Veterans  referred to Pain Clinics is considerably smaller than those available with our 
strategy.  Comparing ABC care to standard Pain Clinic care could be the focus of a much larger, future trial.  
ABCs will be staffed by a minimum of [ADDRESS_1133941]. Gentili (Richmond site PI) who 
has been trained in the context of the VA Rehab R&D -funded pi[INVESTIGATOR_818682].  Training at all sites will occur over one day and will use effective adult learning principles that we have successfully employed in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] (see Preliminary Studies).  Learning will be 
interactive and characterized by [CONTACT_788510] -directed practice coupled with targeted feedback
93,94 as follows:  
1. The trainers (Drs. Weiner and Gentili) will teach the structured examination (Appendix 6) to providers on 3-[ADDRESS_1133942] a weekly 
teleconference during the start -up period with all participating providers to review the algorithms and 
accompanying materials using illustrative case examples, and to answer any questions.  Two to three 
algorithms will be reviewed once a week for 4- 5 weeks.

Figure 6. Portion of Insomnia algorithm  4. The materials will be housed on a SharePoint site dedicated specifically to this study and to which the 
participating providers will have ready access for the duration of the study period.  
5. Reinforcement training sessions will be scheduled as needed prior to the start of participant enrollment.   
As in the UC group, RCs will track the components and location of care with monthly telephone calls.  
Care in the ABCs will proceed as follows:  
1. Usual clinical staff will check the Veteran into the clinic using standard procedures (i.e., confirm his/her 
name [CONTACT_818740], and purpose of the visit ). 
2. The Veteran will complete Take Back Your Back, an 
interactive tablet -based questionnaire described in 
Preliminary Studies (Appendix 9).  This will take ~7- 10 
minutes. As noted previously, 
the purpose of this tool is to 
educate the Veteran, screen him/her for key component 
conditions (e.g., fibromyalgia, 
depression, anxiety, 
maladaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] [i.e., fear 
avoidance believes and catastrophizing], and 
insomnia), and encourage the 
Veteran to discuss these 
potential contributors with the 
ABC provider. This can all be administered via verbally by 
[CONTACT_3647], over the phone.  
3. The Summary Screen from Take Back Your Back 
(example shown in Figure 5) 
will be revealed to the provider 
in the ABC clinic who will 
review it with the Veteran and tailor their history -taking accordingly.  This can be done virtually. Also, the history can be attained virtually, 
or in person, by [CONTACT_818725].  The participant whose results are shown in Figure [ADDRESS_1133943] 
portion of the Insomnia algorithm shown in Figure 6, the provider would want to evaluate this Veteran’s 
mood, even though his PHQ4 was negative.  The provider also will want to evaluate this Veteran’s history 
of substance use, and review the medication list to determine if there are any that can negatively impact 
sleep.  
4. The ABC provider also will check the results of the QMCI so that the pace and implementation of treatment 
can be modified accordingly.  As MCI and dementia are part of a continuum, the published Dementia 
algorithm can be applied to those with MCI.  
5. The provider will perform the previously learned structured physical examination to identify the other CLBP contributors listed in Table 1 (hip OA, SI joint syndrome, myofascial pain, leg length discrepancy, lateral 
hip/thigh pain syndrome).

Figure 8.  Portion of Lumbar Spi[INVESTIGATOR_818683] 7 . Excerpt from “Making Better Lives: Patient -
Focused Care for Low Back Pain”  6. The provider will educate the Veteran about the contributors to their CLBP and functional impairment. This 
will be facilitated by a brief educational booklet that will be given to the Veteran to take home and keep.  
The booklet, “Making Better Lives: Patient -Focused Care for Low Back Pain (Appendix 10),” was created 
for our ongoing SPi[INVESTIGATOR_246390] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] #2) and provides a brief overview of the Veteran’s contributing 
conditions, using simple language, as shown in Figure 7. In this Figure, the ABC provider determined, 
based on their evaluation, that the Veteran has maladaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (i.e., fear avoidance beliefs and/or catastrophizing) as one potential contributor to CLBP/disability.  
7. The provider will use the algorithms (Appendix 5) to direct next steps (e.g., referral for insomnia 
consultation to consider behavioral treatment
50; 
obtaining an x -ray of the hip to confirm a diagnosis of 
hip OA; referral to physical therapy for treatment of 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078]).  All patients, regardless of 
pain contributors, will be provided with a  copy of the 
pain self -management workbook developed by 
[CONTACT_818720]. Beverly Thorn 
(Appendix 11).95 The workbook, “Learning About My 
Pain (LAMP),” has been successfully implemented in 
the context of a trial that specifically targets patients 
of low literacy and was funded by [CONTACT_33230] -
Centered Outcomes Research Institute.  The workbook was developed to be used in a group 
setting and will be modified during the startup phase of the proposed trial for use by [CONTACT_818721] a 
group setting, under the guidance of [CONTACT_818748] (see letter of support). We will refer to it as “Learning About 
Chronic Pain” book.  Participants will be encouraged to revisit Learning About Chronic Pain book  
periodically to determine how they perceive themselves to be copi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
8. To facilitate communication with other providers involved in the algorithms -guided care, the ABC provider 
will document their baseline assessment results using a standardized template in CPRS.  This assessment  
will include a list of the participant’s contributing conditions and the treatments recommended (See 
Appendix 12)  in a data measure 
called the Post H&P Rx .  The ABC 
provider also will complete 
templated follow -up visits notes 
(Appendix 12).   
9. The frequency of ABC care visits 
will not be constrained.  
Suggestions for frequency of 
patient  monitoring are provided 
within the algorithms. At follow- up 
visits  (which can be in person or 
virtual) , the ABC Provider will 
collect data measures to capture the participant’s main conditions. 
This study focuses on 11 main 
conditions related to CLBP, and a 
data measure will be provided for 
each condition so that the ABC 
Provider may capture all the 
necessary data. For each of the participant’s contributing 
conditions, the provider will record 
current treatment, perceived 
compliance (full, partial, none), treatment response (complete, partial, none, did not tolerate), method of 
Version Number  11, September 2021    VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 23 of 34 
 response assessment, and plan. The 3 Question Follow Up Data Measure will be administered at each 
follow up visit. As shown in Figure 8, for example, if the provider’s evaluation reveals symptoms consistent 
with lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_818684], conservative treatment is recommended for 4 -6 weeks followed by [CONTACT_818726].  Each algorithm  has multiple steps and 
recommendations conditional upon response.  The goal of treatment across all algorithms is reduction of pain- associated functional interference/disability.   
10. The participants randomized to the ABC Care group will be contact[CONTACT_792602], or if they would 
like to come on site, by [CONTACT_818727]. No data measures will be collected. The purpose of this interaction would be to help discuss and guide the participant on care after study 
completion.  
11. ABC Providers will complete a “  Final  MD ABC Participant Assessment” for each of the participants 
upon completion of their finalmonth  of participation.  
Rationale for Specialists Delivering ABC Care:  The investigative team discussed whether ABC care should be 
delivered by [CONTACT_818728].  The study proposed is an explanatory clinical trial , thus we chose 
specialists because: 1 ) CLBP is a complex multifaceted condition that requires time to evaluate thoroughly.  
Patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_818685] a single condition.  Primary care providers, on the other hand, must manage a host of conditions in each patient and 
their appointment duration is brief (e.g., 15 minutes for a follow -up patient), thus pragmatism played a 
significant role in our decision for specialist consultants to provide ABC care. 2 ) The background and training of 
many pain medicine consultants (i.e., anesthesiology
96) and the desire of many patients for a “quick fix” often 
leads to pain clinics delivering spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]- focused, procedure- oriented care (i.e., spi[INVESTIGATOR_307844]).  Such care often 
is not associated with salient functional improvement, the outcome of critical relevance for older adults.  Since PCPs often do not have time to address chronic pain adequately, pain specialist referral occurs commonly, as recommended by [CONTACT_818729] (see Figure 1 in the Background and Significance section).  
Thus, expanding the expertise of consultants to address the needs of frail older adults has the potential not 
only to reduce pain and improve function, but to avoid unnecessary care and morbidity.  
 
Follow -up (Appendix 13):  Quarterly telephone calls for up to12 months following randomization will collect 
data on the main outcomes measure (the ODI) as well as the PROMIS 29, PROMIS- GH, VR-12, falls and falls 
efficacy (Falls Efficacy Scale- international short form) , and the Life Space Assessment .106  Health care 
utilization that includes pain medication use (oral morphine equivalents87), emergency room visits, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and pain provider/other health care utilization  as well as the 0- [ADDRESS_1133944] used 
successfully with other VA trials.  For Example: the RC at the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_818686], the RC from the Richmond site will collect follow up data on participants 
from the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_75188], and the RC from the Los Angeles  VA will collect follow up data on participants from 
the Richmond  site.  Participants who were randomized to the UC group will be made aware that they may see 
an ABC provider at their site, outside of the context of this study, for one visit after completion of participation. Participants who were randomized to the ABC Care group will be contact[CONTACT_818730][INVESTIGATOR_818687], 
whether by [CONTACT_648] , or if they choose on site, to discuss care after their participation. No data measures will be 
collected and no study related procedures performed. The ABC Providers will fill out a Final  MD ABC 
Participant Assessment for each ABC Participant upon completion of their up to 12- month participation. The 
purpose of this data measure is for the provider to comment on each condition for which the participant was 
treated, and if the condition was in fact treated, and if not the rationale for not treating the condition. If during 
telephone- based follow up data collection (for a participant based at the sister site) the Veteran expresses 
suicidal ideations, the RC will ask the Veteran to hold on and (s)he will immediately call the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_818688] (i.e., the site of the Veteran’s home VA) who will call the Veteran and follow the facility’s Suicide Threat 
Call Protocol. If the sister site PI [INVESTIGATOR_818689], the RC will call the PI [INVESTIGATOR_818690]  11, September 2021    VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 24 of 34

Retention Strategies: We will employ methods to minimize dropout that we have used successfully for our 
other VA clinical trials.  Specifically, we will: 1) Provide $40 compensation following the completion of baseline 
data collection, and $30 each following the completion of 6 and final month of data collection.  Thus, each 
participant can receive up to $100 for their participation.  2) If we are unable to reach participants during the 
quarterly telephone calls (3 X over 2 weeks), we will send a reminder letter requesting that they call the RC for 
data collection.  3) Those randomized to the UC group will be offered ABC care after they have completed final 
month  data collection.  
Tracking Intervention Adherence :  Fol lowing their baseline visits, participants from both the ABC and UC 
groups will be followed for adherence to their treatment plans.  An RC will query CPRS  records beginning [ADDRESS_1133945] attended their scheduled visits.  Results will be recorded in a secure tracker.  All RCs will query CPRS  records a minimum of every 30 days for the 
duration of the study.  Participants in the Choice program will be asked to confirm their appointments with check -in calls.  
 
5.6 Data Analysis  
Data Management :  A summary of the baseline and follow -up data is provided in Table 7.  Data will be 
collected using paper forms. Completed data forms will be entered into a secure electronic database on a VA 
network server with regular server backup. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_818691] 1200.12. 
Only research team members at participating sites will have access to personal information needed for 
conducting informed consent procedures and participant tracking. Data collected on paper forms and any 
identifiable information will be stored in the Research Coordinator’s office at each site, under double lock and key.  All participants will be assigned unique synthetic identifiers that will appear on forms, files and serve as a 
non-identifiable index in database tables.  Only de- identified data will be entered into the secure electronic 
database. There will be no data fields in which to enter individually identifiable information electronically, except the synthetic participant 
study IDs. Data entry will include 
double data entry checks. All 
research desktop computers will be encrypted. The encryption software 
will be Federal Information Process 
Standards (FIPS) 140 -1,2 
compliant. Data collected for this study will be kept in compliance with VHA regulations forbidding the 
destruction of research records.  
Data Analysis : 
                                                 
 
Overview:  
The study Statistician, [CONTACT_818749] will be in charge 
of data analysis along with the PI.   
[CONTACT_818750] will be sent only de-identified data as described above. 
We will perform all main analysis 
based on intention -to-treat  
following the a priori plans outlined 
Version Number  11, September 2021    VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 25 of 34 
 below.  All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® version 9 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North 
Carolina) by [CONTACT_165179]. Perera.  Participant flow will be summarized using a CONSORT 
diagram.[ADDRESS_1133946], we describe below our primary approach to missing data and 
a set of sensitivity analyses by [CONTACT_818731], ignoring missing data, and reasonable 
alternative statistical modeling strategies to assess the robustness of our findings.  
Baseline Comparison:  
Due to the large sample size and the randomization scheme balanced with respect to site, it is highly unlikely 
that baseline participant characteristics will be significantly different between the arms.  If we do find any, they 
will be included as covariates in the sensitivity analyses.  We will not alter the primary analysis to preserve its a 
priori nature and predictability.  We will use independent samples t - or Wilcoxon rank sum tests, as appropriate 
based on distributional properties, to compare continuous baseline characteristics between the intervention arms.  For categorical baseline participant characteristics, we will use chi -square and Fisher’s exact tests, as 
appropriate.  Statistical significance of the intervention term will be interpreted as indicating the need to include 
them as covariates in sensitivity analyses.  
Aim 1 Primary Analysis:  
We will fit a linear mixed model with baseline to follow -up change in ODI score as the dependent variable; 
intervention arm (ABC/UC), follow -up time point (6/12 months) and their interaction as fixed effect of main 
interest; baseline ODI as a fixed effect covariate; and a participant random effect to account for  multiple 
repeated assessments of the same participant over time.  The statistical significance at α=0.[ADDRESS_1133947] of the primary hypothesis H1.1.  Upon 
confirming the H1.1 primary hypothesis, we will compute the number -needed- to-treat (NNT) as the reciprocal 
of the between- intervention difference in percentages of those showing a meaningful ODI improvement above 
its MCID.  
Aim 1 Secondary Analyses:   
To characterize the intervention ac tually received under ABC care, we will describe the conditions identified, 
further evaluations/initiated treatments and their responses recorded in the form that tracks response to 
treatment and additional management plans (see Appendix 12). We will employ the same analytic strategy 
described above for ODI (under primary analysis) for our secondary continuous outcomes pain severity, quality 
of life and falls efficacy.  The statistical significance of the ABC vs UC means contrast at the 6 - and 12- month 
points will serve as the formal tests of the secondary hypotheses H1.2.   
Measures of healthcare utilization between 6 and 12 months in H1.3 (prescriptions/refills of opi[INVESTIGATOR_818692], invasive procedures, emergency room/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042]) are mostly in the 
form of counts.  As such, we will fit a series of generalized linear models with each count utilization outcome as 
the dependent variable, a negative binomial distribution to account for any over  dispersion and a logarithmic 
link function for the count outcome, actual person- time of exposure with opportunity for reporting utilization 
outcome as an offset, and intervention arm (ABC/UC) as the independent factor of interest.  Intervention arm 
incident rate ratios and their statistical significances will constitute tests of H1.3.  
Aim 2 Analyses:  
The goal is to explore whether ABC vs UC differences in improvement vary across participant subgroups of 
interest (effect modification). We will add each of the subgroups (based on baseline CLBP -associated 
disability, anxiety/ depression, mild cognitive impairment and obesity) and associated subgroup × intervention group interaction effects as additional fixed effects in the above statistical models.  Rigorous methodological 
guidelines for subgroup analyses require significant interaction effects for making conclusions of differential 
intervention effects in subgroups.
[ADDRESS_1133948] is significant, we will estimate ABC vs UC differences and 
Version Number  11, September 2021    VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 26 of 34 
 their statistical significance within those subgroups. 
Missing Data: 
The best approach for handling missing data is to prevent it.  We will use the methods described earlier to 
retain participants and prevent missing data. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_212095], missing data will occur.  We will clearly 
document those with missing data and reasons in the CONSORT diagram, and compare those with missing 
data to complete data with respect to available data.  Statistical guidelines for handling missing data recommend methods such as multiple imputation, which considers the uncertainty involved in imputing missing 
data.
[ADDRESS_1133949] available objective method to analytically account for missing 
data under the ignorable or missing- at-random (MAR) assumption.  Specifically, we will generate M=[ADDRESS_1133950] the uncertainty involved in imputation. SAS® MI and MIANALYZE procedures 
will be used. Other approaches to missing data, including the naïve approaches of ignoring the missing values 
and last -value- carried- forward (LVCF) will also be considered in sensitivity analyses and robustness of the 
results to using these approaches will be examined. 
Sensitivity Analyses:  
We will perform a series of sensitivity analyses to ensure the robustness of our results against various 
assumptions.  One such analysis will involve inclusions of baseline participant characteristics significantly 
different between groups as additional covariates in the linear mixed and generalized linear models above.  Another will involve sensitivity of results to missing data handling techniques.  In addition, if analyses of 
residuals from the models show violations of statistical assumptions, we will consider fitting models after Box -
Cox transforming
[ADDRESS_1133951] this alternative 
modeling strategy.  
Sample Size Justification and Statistical Power :   
Planned sample size is [ADDRESS_1133952] -intervention change in the primary outcome ODI103; a conservative 
estimate of a minimally clinically important difference (MCID) of 7 points104; a conservative dropout rate of 15% 
from other back pain trials105; using published methods implemented in commercial software (PASS 2012®, 
Number Cruncher Statistical Systems, Kaysville, Utah), with [ADDRESS_1133953] an observed primary outcome difference as small as 7 points with 90% power in a 2- tailed 
test at the α=0.05 level.  
 
5.7 Withdrawal of Subjects  
After participants sign both the HIPAA and Informed Consent documents, officially enrolling them  in the 
study, they will be screened for cognitive impairment with the MMSE questionnaire before starting 
baseline data collection. Those who score <23 will immediately be withdrawn from the study, and their 
PCPs will be alerted.  
Participants are able to withdrawal at any time without consequence  by [CONTACT_818732] . They will be able to keep the payment(s) they have already received but will not receive 
additional payment. UC participants can continue or discontinue care at their discretion. ABC care participants will no longer be treated as part of the study but can be referred to an ABC clinic by [CONTACT_818733] -engage treatment. Follow- up calls will be terminated, discontinuing data collection. 
Previously collected data will still be analyzed.  
 6  Reporting  
The overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_818693] a daily basis to take calls and emails from all 
study -site pers onnel. In addition, teleconferences will be scheduled at the site PI’s discretion to discuss 
goals, progress, modifications, documentation, recruitment, retention, data analysis, and confidentiality. 
Any instances of adverse events, protocol deviations, or other problems identified during the meetings 
Version Number  11, September 2021    VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1133954] forms 
and/or procedures set forth by [CONTACT_1201].   In addition, clinical coordinators may review study 
documentation and/or consent forms to ensure that subject’s confidentiality is maintained.  
7 Privacy and Confidentiality  
Protected Health Information (PHI) will be used for the purposes of contact[CONTACT_818734] , as well as to screen their CPRS records. PHI will not be used out side of these few functions , 
nor will it be disclosed or used on any data collection measures.  
 
All data will be collected on hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_818694]’ office and/ or file cabinets. No members outside of the research team will have access to this 
information. Data will be entered into an electronic database created in Microsoft Access, specifically 
for the purposes of this study. No PHI will be kept in this database. All electronic data and information 
will be kept on a protected VA shared drive that only research team members will have access to. Also, 
a master list of all subjects who have signed Informed C onsent  documents  will be kept electronically on 
the VA Shared Drive.  
 
Study subjects will be assigned unique identifiers that will appear on all files used in the statistical analyses; all 
data will be de- identified.   Only limited team members at participating VAs will have access to personal 
information needed for tracking and informed consent.   Several steps will be taken to ensure data quality and 
data integrity: 1) use of standard methods of data collection and recording specified in a manual of operations 
2) required viewing of a webcast staff workshop on research integrity and data entry at the beginning of the 
study and when new personnel are hired, and 3) audits on a random sample of participants to verify 
completion of interviews and data accuracy.  A code number will be the only identifier on the electronic data 
that is stored on a protected VA Shared Drive.   There will be no data fields in which to enter PHI electronically.  
 
All research desktop computers will be encrypted.   The encryption software will be Federal Information 
Processing Standards (FIPS) [ADDRESS_1133955] 3 
years following completion of the study and will be archived to ensure compliance with VHA regulations 
forbidding the destruction of research records.

The ABC Clinic operations will be overseen by [CONTACT_818735] [INVESTIGATOR_818695].  The RC will be 
responsible for maintaining the clinic schedule (i.e., scheduling all appointments and any changes to the schedule).  The Local Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_818696].  The RC will schedule appointments with the ABC clinic providers and ensure that those assigned to UC do not have appointments with the ABC providers for the 
duration of the study.  Day to day procedures for operationalizing this process will be finalized during the study start-up period at each site.  
Communication also will occur between ABC Clinic Providers and other relevant clinic providers that are consulted in the context of the algorithms.  This will occur in the same manner as per standard VA care.  That 
is, consultations will be ordered through CPRS and all patient- related communications will occur securely

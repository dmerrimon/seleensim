Background:  Dystonia is a hyperkinetic movement disorder defined by [CONTACT_7713], involuntary, and often 
painful muscle contractions.1,[ADDRESS_6947] treatment for dystonia is botulinum toxin (BoNT)  injections 
administered every [ADDRESS_6948] the entire 12 weeks.11  In a retrospective analysis of dystonia patients injected at 
our center (n = 150), we found  the average duration of benefit was about 9.5 weeks, which was similar to 
reports by [CONTACT_7714] .12,13 Also, BoNT treatment provides  only pure symptomatic motor benefits and does 
not mod ify the disease pathophysiology.14-16 Other treatment options such as d eep brain stimulation may be 
effective for some types of dystonia, but it is an invasive procedure and not all patients are appropriate 
candidates for this surgery.2,9 Therefore, there is clear merit in exploring other opt ions to potentiate and 
possibly prolong the benefits of BoNT therapy.   
 
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a painless and non -invasive neuromodulation technique that uses a 
magnetic field to induce an electric field in the cortex . TMS pulses delive red on a repetitive basis known as 
repetitive TMS (rTMS) has the ability to modulate dystonia networks and lead to clinical improvements. rTMS 
delivered at low -frequency (≤ 1 Hz) mimics long -term depression, leading to decreased cortical excitability, 
while high -frequency TMS (> 5 Hz) mimics long -term potentiation, leading to increased cortical excitability.10,[ADDRESS_6949] beyond the stimulation period.9,10 
rTMS effects extend beyond the area ta rgeted for stimulation and can influence remote brain regions.   
 
Dystonia is a network disorder involving the motor cortex , premotor cortex,  and their connections with other 
brain regions. The therapeutic role of rTMS in dystonia has been investigated in only a few studies , which 
employed low -frequency stimulation parameters and found the dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC) as an important 
brain target for modulation of the dystonia network.[ADDRESS_6950] yet to investigate the interactions between BoN T and rTMS as a potential adjuvant therapy. Finally, 
rTMS targeted to  the dystonia network is likely to influence motor and non -motor symptoms such as 
depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment ; however clinical studies conducted so far have not assesse d 
non-motor benefits .17 
 
The primary goal  of the proposed study is to determine whether low-frequency rTMS delivered to the  dPMC 
has synergism with BoNT therapy in patients with isolated cervical dystonia. We will determine whether rTMS 
serves  as a therape utic bridge for early fading of BoNT benefits  (Aim 1 ). We will select patients receiving 
BoNT injections every 12 weeks but endorsing clinical benefits lasting < [ADDRESS_6951] TMS session (T 0), immediately after (T 1) and 2 weeks after (T 2) rTMS 
(Figure 1). The T2 visit will coincide with their next round of botulinum toxin injections (thi s study visit will be 
approximately [ADDRESS_6952] either active or sham rTMS (whichever treatment they were not assigned to in the 
first round). As the rTMS therapy requires multiple sessions spanning weeks for cumulative benefits, feasibility

6/17/[ADDRESS_6953] if not all will live within an 
acceptable driving distanc e for them to complete the protocol.  
 
In addition to clinical outcomes, we will investigate the physiological changes underlying the clinical effects  
(Aim 2 ). Single -pulse and paired -pulse studies  in patients with dystonia  have revealed inhibitory dysfunc tion, 
particularly increased motor evoked potential (MEP), prolonged cortical silent period (CSP), and reduced short 
intracortical inhibition (SICI) .25-30 These findings implicate a primary dysfunction of the motor cortex. To further 
understand the motor c ortex functions, we recently employed high -density electroencephalogram (HD -EEG) 
technique s. We found there was an  impaired cortical desynchronization in the alpha and beta bands during 
voluntary movement in patients with cervical dystonia.31  
 
OBJECTIVES/ SPECIFIC AIMS:  
Specific Aim #1:  Determine the  Clinical effects  of rTMS combined with BoNT in isolated cervical 
dystonia.  We will determine the clinical effects of active vs. sham rTMS on motor, non -motor, and gait 
symptoms . We will examine the motor effects with  the standardized Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis 
Rating Scale (TWSTRS), mood with the Beck Depression Inventory, cognition with the Wisconsin Card Sorting 
Task and Trail Making Test, and gait with the instrumented Z eno walkway system. We  hypothesize there will 
be greater improvement in the motor (primary outcome), nonmotor, and gait measures (secondary outcomes) 
at T1, and T2 compared to baseline in the active rTMS group compared to the sham rTMS group.  
Specific Aim #2:  Determine the  Phys iological effects  of rTMS combined with BoNT in isolated cervical 
dystonia. We will determine the physiological effects of active vs. sham rTMS using TMS and EEG 
techniques . We will examine the cortical excitability with established TMS parameters includin g MEP, CSP, 
and SICI, and we will examine cortical desynchronization of alpha and beta band with resting state HD -EEG. 
We hypothesize that the change in TMS measures and EEG measures at T 1, and T2 compared to baseline 
will significantly improve in the acti ve rTMS group compared to the sham rTMS group and will correlate with 
the clinical improvements as outlined in specific Aim #1.  
RESEARCH PLAN AND METHODOLOGY:  Patients with a diagnosis of isolated cervical dystonia receiving 
BoNT every 12 weeks at our move ment disorders center will be  enrolled.  Diagnosis of cervical dystonia will be 
established in accordance with the Consensus Statement of the Movement Disorders Society .1  
 
Inclusion Criteria:  patient s 18-85 years  of age who receive regular  BoNT  scheduled every 12 weeks, on 
stable optimized doses  but with report ed benefit s lasting ≤ 9 weeks  for 2 consecutive cycles . Patents followed 
at our center routinely  fill out a self -reported form to document the duration of benefits perceived with BoNT  
therapy. Pa rticipants  will be allowed to continue oral medications that they are taking for dystonia concurrently 
and will be encouraged to continue this regimen throughout the duration of the study  . 
Exclusion Criteria: 1) Presence of metallic objects or neur ostimulators in the brain  (including the following: 
cochlear implants, implanted electrodes/stimulators such as deep brain stimulators and vagus nerve 
stimulators, aneurysm clips or coils, stents, bullet fragments, jewelry and hair barrettes) , 2) pregnancy, 
3) history of active seizures or epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], 4) patients with severe scoliosis or other gait impairment that will 
preclude them from participating in gait evaluation.  
Enrollment:  Our target is to enroll 10 total patients  in the study  in a cro ssover design, with all 10 patients 
receiving both active and sham rTMS in blinded, random order . In order to enroll 10, we will need to screen 
more than that number. We anticipate that we will need to screen 20 patients in order to find 10 that are eligib le 
for enrollment. Of those 20, we anticipate that 10 will enroll but later choose not participate in the study.

6/17/[ADDRESS_6954] (S1), and will then crossover and switch to the other treatment type 
during the second session (S2). Patients will have pri mary and secondary outcome measures performed at 
three  time points: Baseline (T0), following rTMS (T1), and 2 weeks after rTMS  (T2) (Figure 1). Patients will 
have the next round of regularly scheduled botulinum toxin injections during the T2 study visit, a fter the 
outcome measures have been obtained. Then the entire study protocol will be performed again but the patients 
will undergo either active or sham rTMS during S2 (whichever option they were not exposed to during S1). The 
study protocol will take plac e over approximately 24 weeks. Details of specific parts of the protocol are 
included below.  
 
 
Primary Outcome:  Motor symptoms of dystonia  will be measured with TWSTRS; a widely accepted 
composite rating scale for cervical dystonia with subscales for clin ical severity, functional disability, and 
associated pain. We will record videos of subjects at baseline and follow -up time points, which will be scored 
by [CONTACT_7715].  
Secondary Outcomes:  Non-motor symptoms  will be measured as follows:  mood with the Beck Depression 
Inventory (BDI) and cognitive tasks as measured by [CONTACT_7716] (WCST) and Trail 
Making Test (TMT); gait  with Zeno walkways system for  temporal parameters (stance time, double support 
time, stride time, an d cadence), spatial parameters (stride length, step width, step length, step asymmetry), 
and the dynamic stability index (ratio between single and double support time)4,5; physiological outcomes will 
be measured with standard procedures for TMS based MEP, CSP, and SICI25-30 and HD -EEG based power of 
alpha and beta bands during resting state.31 
 
Randomization:  A random number generator will be used to assign patients to active or sham stimulation  
during the S1 time period . If the number is even, the patient will be assigned active stimulation. If the number is 
odd, the patient will be assigned sham stimulation. The study team member who makes these assignments will 
be aware of which patients are receiving active or sham stimulation but will be different from the blinded 
reviewer. The blinded reviewer will be unaware of the patient’s assignment to active or sham stimulation. 
Following crossover, the patients will undergo whichever treatment condition (active or sham) they were not 
exposed to during S1.

IRB202101156  
6/17/22  rTMS p rotocol:  rTMS will be delivered using a NeuroStar  TMS therapy system ( Neuronetics, Malvern, PA ). 
The resting motor threshold (RMT) will be defined as the lowest stimulation intensity required to evoke a 50 μV 
potential in a target muscle (i.e. first dorsal  interosseus muscle/FDI). A figure of eight coil will be used to deliver 
the stimulation. Patients will be seated in a comfortable reclined chair. The dPMC target will be defined as 1 
cm medial and 2 cm anterior to the site of RMT acquisition.11 The rTMS protocol will be as follows: each 
session will consist of 1 -Hz rTMS over the d PMC  for 30 minutes (1800 pulses) at 90% of the  RMT. Patients will 
receive [ADDRESS_6955]  associated  with the discharge of the stimulation coil .  
 
Sham protocol:  Participants will undergo the same procedure for identifying target location and RMT used in 
patients receiving real rTMS. Simulated rTMS will be administered using a NeuroStar  sham coil, which 
produces discharge noise and vibration without stimulating the cerebral cortex. This technique has been 
suggested to provide more effective  blinding compared to other methods use in previous controlled studies .[ADDRESS_6956] to real rTMS versus sham rTMS.   
 
Single and paired -pulse TMS paradigms : A MagStim BiStim device (Whitland, [LOCATION_006]) will be used for the 
single and paired -pulse TMS paradigms. These will be followed per established protocols in the literature  
(Figure 2 A and C) .10 A single -pulse of TMS will be targeted over the motor cortex to gene rate a motor evoked 
potential (MEP), which can be captured on EMG. The rest of the EMG will be analyzed to assess the time 
between the TMS pulse and the MEP (also known as the latency) and the amount of time muscle activity 
remains silent following 
the MEP  (also known as 
the cortical silent period). 
In a paired -pulse TMS 
paradigm, a subthreshold 
pulse will be  provided 
followed by [CONTACT_7717] a suprathreshold pulse. 
When the interstimulus 
interval is short (1 -4 
msec), the ratio of MEP 
amplitudes produced by 
[CONTACT_7718] 
(SICI).  
 
EEG protocol:  High-
Density EEG using [ADDRESS_6957] the EEG 
electrodes. The patient’s electrical activity  will be recorded  under two conditions: at rest and  with maximal 

Frey 5 
 
IRB202101156  
6/17/22  range of motion/excursion in six directions: up, down, left, right, left shoulder, right shoulder.  Patients will also 
be instructed to perform arm movements while the EEG is recording. A sensor such as the Delsys system will 
be used to measure the patient’s motion at the neck and head throughout this procedure . This portion of the 
study will be videota ped (Figure 2B and D).  
Safety:  Since the most important safety concern with rTMS is the possibility of seizure, participants with active 
seizure disorder or those at increased risk of seizure will be excluded. Low frequency protocols carry less risk 
of se izure as compared to high frequency protocols given that high frequency generates cortical excitability.[ADDRESS_6958] rTMS protocols. Other mild and transient side effects that participants may 
experience secondary to TMS include transient eye pain, toothache, muscle twitch, facial pain, neck stiffness, 
and pain or discomfort at the application site and skin.  
 
Depression measure and suicide risk: If the Beck Depression Inventory reveals that the patient has feelings 
of harming the mselves  (Question 9 score 2 or above) , we will refer them to mental health services available at 
Shands at the University of [LOCATION_012].  
 
Clinical Assessments:  
Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS):  This is an objective scale evaluating 
patients on a variety of features including maximal excursion, duration, effects of sensory trick, shoulder 
elevation, range of motion, and time.  This portion of the study will be videotaped.  
Beck Depression Inventor y (BDI):  This is a [ADDRESS_6959]:  This is a [ADDRESS_6960] (WCST):  This is a cognitive task that asks patients  to sort cards based on color, 
number, and shape.  
Gait Assessment:  Patients will be asked to walk across the Zeno walkways system for  temporal parameters 
(stance time, double support time, stride time, and cadence), spatial parameters (stride length, step  width, step 
length, step asymmetry), and the dynamic stability index (ratio between single and double support time ). This 
portion of the study will be videotaped.  
 
Patient will also have HD -EEG and TMS measures (MEP, CSP, and SICI) performed as described  above.  
 
Patients will have primary and secondary outcome measures performed at six timepoints: Baseline (T0), 
following rTMS (T1), and 2 weeks following rTMS (T2) during session 1 (S1) and baseline (T0), following rTMS 
(T1), and 2 weeks following rTMS (T2) during session 2 (S2)  (Figure 1). The study protocol will take place over 
approximately [ADDRESS_6961] within +/ - 14 days of the 
expected timeline, with more details below ( Table 1 ).

Compensatio
n            
 
Compensation : Participants who live a minimum of 50 miles from Gainesville will be offered a 4 -night hotel 
stay of up to $1 00 per night in Gainesville  (for 4 nights)  so that they can complete the 5 consecutive days at 
the S1:T1 and S2:T1 timepoints. That way they can complete this portion of the study without having to travel 
back to their home each night. This will be paid  in the form of gift cards  at the time the pa tient and family are 
staying at the hotel  ($400 for the S1 time period and $400 for the S2 time period) . In addition, participants will 
be compensated  up to $ 300 ($1 50 for gas and $1 50 for food) during their visits to the Fixel Center /UF related 
to partici pation in this study. This will be prorated so that they will receive $50 in gift cards  ($25 for gas and $25 
for food) in 6 equal installments at each of the outcome measure timepoints: S1:T0, S1:T1, S1:T2, S2:T0, 
S2:T1, and S2:T2. Participants will also b e compensated  $150 for taking part in the study  (for their time) . This 
compensation will be prorated, so that patients will receive $25  in gift cards  in 6 equal installments, correlating 
with the S1:T0, S1:T1, S1:T2, S2:T0, S2:T1, and S2:T2 outcome timepoi nts.  
  
Data Safety Monitoring Plan:  The research team monitors the patient safety and data collection of each 
study visit.  The Data Safety and Monitoring Committee will meet once each year to review the recruitment, 
adverse events, data collection, and o ther aspects of the study.  The Data Safety and Monitoring Committee 
will be notified of any adverse events that occur during the course of the study, within 2 business days of the 
Frey 7 
 
IRB202101156  
6/17/[ADDRESS_6965]. Rawls will serve as an independent health professional on the Data Safet y Monitoring 
Committee.   
Location:  The clinical portions of the study will be performed at the Fixel Neurological Institute; patients will 
have the clinical outcome measures collected in a clinic or research room.  Patients will have the clinical 
outcome me asures collected in a clinic or research room. The NeuroStar TMS machine is located in a 
separate TMS room within the Fixel Neurologic Institute. The Zeno gait walkway system is also located in the 
Fixel Neurologic Institute. Other devices necessary to com plete the study inclue these portable devices which 
will reside in the TMS room during the study procedure:   
EMG system : Bagnoli™ Desktop EMG system (Delsys, Inc., [LOCATION_011], [LOCATION_005]). It includes four surface 
electrodes to detect muscle movement  
EEG system: ActiveTwo system (Biosemi, Amsterdam, Netherlands). It has a cap with electrodes in a 
preconfigured montage, using 128 Ag -AgCl electrodes.  
 
Possible Discomforts and Risks:  There are some possible discomforts and risks for participants taking part in 
this study, most of which are mild or transiently related to the study protocol and will abate afterwards.  
TMS:  
• Headaches – Headaches and neck aches can occur. They can be relate d to stabilizing the neck when 
measuring TMS. They are usually short lasting and respond easily to over the counter analgesics.  
• Transient hearing threshold shift – There is a possibility of temporary mild hearing loss due to the noise of the 
TMS machine. T he rate of this risk is unknown yet. Earplugs will be provided to the participant to reduce the 
potential for this risk.   
• Seizure – A theoretical risk associated with brain stimulation . Since FDA clearance of TMS, the seizure risk is 
≤0.1% per patient (le ss than 1 in 1000 patients).  In the event that the participant has a seizure, the study 
staff will immediately stop the treatment session and make sure that the participant is safe during the seizure.  
The participant will be watched for a period of time after the seizure to make sure he or she is feeling well. 
Individuals with an active seizure disorder are excluded.  
• Fainting – Not directly related to magnetic stimulation. It is thought to be related to anxiety and psycho -
physical discomfort during the pr ocedure. The laboratory is equipped, and staff is trained to respond to this 
risk if fainting occurs. However, the participant will be at very low risk (less than 1%) for fainting. Transfer to 
the emergency room might be needed if the participant fails to improve as expected.  
• Effect of Magnetic Stimulation – The NeuroStar TMS Therapy System is contraindicated for use in patients 
who have conductive, ferromagnetic, or other magnetic -sensitive metals implanted in their head within 30 
cm of the treatment coil.  Examples include cochlear implants, implanted electrodes/stimulators, aneurysm 
clips or coils, stents, bullet fragments, jewelry and hair barrettes. Failure to follow this restriction could 
result in serious injury or death. The NeuroStar TMS Therapy Syst em is contraindicated for use in patients 
who have active or inactive implants (including device leads), including deep brain stimulators, cochlear 
implants, and vagus nerve stimulators. Contraindicated use could result in serious injury or death. To avoid  
these complications, participants with any of the above listed implanted objects will be excluded from this 
Frey 8 
 
IRB202101156  
6/17/[ADDRESS_6966].  The 
possibility exi sts that complications and undesirable side effects, which are unknown at this time, could occur.   
EEG:  
• A gel paste is used to attach the sensors during EEG which may mildly and briefly irritate the skin on the 
scalp or face. Hair products cannot be used on the day of testing (or should be washed out prior to testing), 
which may be inconvenient to the participant.  
 
Possible Benefits:  The participant may or may not benefit from taking part in the study. All participants will 
continue receiving botulinum toxin injections every [ADDRESS_6967] of care. All patients will 
receive both active and sham rTMS; since the active rTMS is hypothesized to augment the effects of botulinum 
toxin injections, patients may ex perience further reduction in symptoms or sustained response to botulinum toxin. 
The information gathered from this study will benefit the neurology department and the larger research 
community as we continue to seek the most efficacious treatments for cervical dystonia.  
Regulatory Approval and Statistics:  The study will be approved by [CONTACT_7719], and all subjects will provide written informed consent. The study is highly feasible given the relatively 
large number of patients with  cervical dystonia that receive botulinum toxin injections on a regular basis.  This is 
a pi[INVESTIGATOR_7707]. We will use descriptive statistics and ANOVA 
to run analysis on the data that has  been collected.  
Confidentiality : Information collected about the patient will be stored in locked filing cabinets or in computers 
with security passwords.  Only certain people have the legal right to review these research records, and they will 
protect the secrecy (confidentiality) of these records as much as the law allows. These people include the 
researchers for this study, certain University of [LOCATION_012] officials, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7708] (if any) involved in this 
research, and the Institutional Review Board (IRB; a n IRB is a group of people who are responsible for looking 
after the rights and welfare of people taking part in research) . Otherwise the research records will not be 
released without participant permission unless required by [CONTACT_7720] a court order.  
 
Researchers will take appropriate steps to protect any information they collect about participants. However, 
there is a slight risk that information about participants could be revealed inappropriately or accidentally.  
Depending on the nature of t he information such a release could upset or embarrass them, or possibly even 
affect their insurability or employability.   
 
If the results of this research are published or presented at scientific meetings, patient identity will not be 
disclosed.

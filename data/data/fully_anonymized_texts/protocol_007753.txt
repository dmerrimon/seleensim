The purpose of this amendment is to update the eligibility criteria to reflect that liposomal cytarabine combined with daunorubicin ( CPX -351) may be considered one of the 
allowed types of induction therapy for front-line AML that subjects must undergo prior to enrollment on this study. This change is the result of changes in standard of care AML therapy.  A lso, an echocardiogram is now required as a pre -study assessment.  
 
Additional major changes to the protocol include: subjects will be allowed to receive [ADDRESS_785663] elapsed as opposed to the previously mandated 30 days, an additional correlative objective will be assessed to determine the presence of minimal residual disease after pembrolizumab therapy and dose modification and supportive care guidelines for pembrolizumab will be based on the updated package insert recommendations. 
 
 
Editorial, Administrative Changes 
• Removal of UNCCN  to change to  LCCC CPO Multicenter/LCCC Multicenter  
• Added in LCCC CPO Multicenter e -mail address throughout 
“([EMAIL_11364] ” as a source of contact  
• Table 3 - change formatting and changed title to “Dose Modifications” 
• Section 6.8 assessment of safety was clarified to indicated that only subjects who 
receive pembrolizumab will be evaluable for safety assessments . Additional 
clarification was made to sections 2.4.2 and 4.6 to clarify removing subjects from study due to unacceptable AEs refers to the section of the study when subjects are receiving pembrolizumab therapy and not the induction therapy phase.

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_595194] 02, [ADDRESS_785683] salvage 
high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) on days [ADDRESS_785684] cell surface receptor 
programmed cell death -1 (PD -1), pembrolizumab, on day 14 as induction therapy 
in patients with relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients 
who achieve at least a partial response (PR) post-induction will continue on 
pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up to 1 year of maintenance therapy. We plan to enroll 37 patients in a Simon’s two -stage design.  
 
The hypothesis of this study is that HiDAC followed by [CONTACT_595222] a combined complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete recovery (CRi) ) rate of >40%, superior to a historical 
control of 20%. We also hypothesize that  the rate of unacceptable toxicity 
associated with  HiDAC  followed by [CONTACT_595223] 
20% (see section 2.4.2 ). Secondary endpoints include toxicity of this combination 
when used as induction, overall objective response rate (CR+CRi +PR ) post-
induction, toxicity of pembrolizumab maintenance in those patients with a response after induction, and progression -free survival  (PFS) , relapse- free 
survival (RFS)  and overall survival (OS) in patients who re ceive maintenance 
pembrolizumab. We will also explore for an  association between potential 
immun e biomarkers and clinical outcomes with pembrolizumab. The overarching 
goals of these correlative studies are: 1) to identify and characteriz e mechanisms 
involved in T cell dysfunction in AML, 2) to identify potential predictive 
biomarker candidates to allow better selection of AML patients who may benefit 
from pembrolizumab, and 3) to identify new pathways that could be targeted to 
enhance the efficacy of pembrolizumab in AML. 
1.2 Relapsed and Refractory AML  
AML has an extremely poor prognosis with conventional chemotherapy agents. While approximately 70% of patients are expected to achieve a CR following intensive induction chemotherapy, the majority of these patients ultimately relapse and die of AML.
1 The European LeukemiaNet analyzed the 3 -year 
relapse- free survival (RFS) rates o f 1,550 patients treated on front- line Cancer and 
Leukemia Group B (CALGB) studies in AML between 1985 and 2006. Patients were stratified on this study based on cytogenetic and molecular risk factors into 4 risk groups: favorable, intermediate-1, intermedi ate-2 and adverse. The 3- year 
RFS rates were 55%, 23%, 34%, and 10% among younger (<60 years) patients in the favorable, intermediate- 1, intermediate -2, and adverse risk groups, 
respectively. In comparison, older patients (>60 years) had distinctively wors e 
outcomes across each subset with 3 -year RFS rates of 24%, 10%, 11%, and 6% 
among favorable, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and adverse risk, respectively.2

5  
Patients who do not respond to intensive induction chemotherapy (i.e., primary 
refractory  disease) have an even worse outcome with an overall response rate of 
<20% with salvage chemotherapy agents.3 Long -term survival in primary 
refractory AML patients is <5 -10%.[ADDRESS_785685], the overall outcome of patients 
with relapsed  AML is dependent on multiple factors such as total duration of CR, 
age, performance status, cytogenetics/molecular markers, and previous allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
[ADDRESS_785686] 
relapse patients into 3 prognostic groups: favorable, intermediate and poor-risk. One-year overall survival (OS) was 70%, 49% and 16%, for favorable, 
intermediate, and poor- risk relapsed AML patients, respectively.  
[ADDRESS_785687] form results from various Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) studies of 362 patients >55 years who initially achieved a CR with induction therapy. Sixty- five percen t 
of these patients subsequently relapsed with a median overall survival (OS) <5 months and 5- year OS  of 6% after disease relapse.
6,[ADDRESS_785688] consistently proven to be superior. High dose cytarabine 
(HiDAC) 3 gm/m
2 administered intravenously ( IV) Q12hours for 12 doses is one 
commonly used treatment in this setting, and has been evaluated  with and without 
the addition of anthracyclines in patients with relapsed and refractory AML. Data on this regimen are summarized in the next section. 
1.3 Cytarabine 
Cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside) is a nucleoside analog that incorporates into 
human DNA in the S phase of the cell cycle. Cytarabine is widely considered the most effective anti -leukemic chemotherapeutic agent in AML. HiDAC, with and 
without anthracyclines, has been evaluated in 78 relapsed and refractory AML patients (age range: 12 -72 years). Thirty -four of these patients received HiDAC 
alone (3 gm/m
2 IV Q12hours days 1- 6) and 44 patients received HiDAC (same 
dose and schedule) + daunorubicin 30 mg/m2 IV days 7 -9. The overall CR rates 
were similar between HiDAC and HiDAC + daunorubicin (44% vs. 59%, respectively; p=0.09). Median duration of response was only 5 months in both arms. In the HiDAC alone arm, there was a clear difference in CR rates between relapsed disease (CR rates = 63%) and primary refractory AML (CR rates = 20%).   In the HiDAC alone arm, all patients achieved bone marrow aplasia, and 91% of patients in both arms developed fevers. The percentage of patients with non-hematologic toxicities by [CONTACT_595224]:

6 eye (23% when eye drops were used; 76% when they were not); skin (32%), 
nausea and vomiting (88%), diarrhea (39%),  and abnormal liver chemistries 
(79%). Moreover, 12% of patients had CNS toxicity with HiDAC alone, typi[INVESTIGATOR_595195] -moderate neurologic impairment, with 6% (n=2) experiencing 
Grade [ADDRESS_785689] suggested that cytarabine alone has response rates 15 -20% in 
relapsed and refractory AM L patients. A randomized phase III study compared 
vosaroxin + cytarabine versus cytarabine alone (1 gm/m
2 IV daily for 5 days) in 
relapsed and refractory AML patients. The CR rate for patients on the vosaroxin + cytarabine arm was 30% versus 16% in patients on the cytarabine only arm.
9 An 
international randomized phase III study of elacytarabine compared with physicians choice, which included high dose cytarabine, also showed CR rates of approximately 20% in the physician’s choice arm . 
10Additionally, a randomized 
phase II  study by [CONTACT_595225]: Arm A: carboplatin + topotecan, Arm B: flavopi[INVESTIGATOR_106540] + cytarabine + mitoxantrone (FLAM), Arm C: Sirolimus + Mitoxantrone + Etoposide + Cytarabine. FLAM was shown to be the most effective regimen in this trial, with a CR rate of 28%, while  Arm A and Arm C 
produced CR rates of 14% and 15%, respectively.

It is unclear whether 3 gm/m2 of cytarabine is necessary and whether this dose is 
superior to 2 gm/m2. Moreover, high doses of cytarabine (>2 gm/m2) appear to 
increase the risk for cerebellar toxicity, especially in older patients and those with renal disease.
12 HiDAC at doses of 1- 2 gm/m2 has also been evaluated in 
combination with other chemotherapy agents in relapsed and refractory AML patients, such as topoisomerase inhibitors (mitoxantrone and etoposide),
3,13-15 
fludarabine16, cladribine17,18, and clofarabine.19,20 Response rates seen with these 
combinations range from 20-50% (median duration of response <9 months), with significant toxicities; 30-day mortality rates  of these regimens range from  10-
30%.   Given these data, there is a high unmet need to develop safe and effective novel therap eutic regimens for patients with refractory and relapsed AML.

Pembrolizumab (MK -3475) is a potent and highly selective IV humanized 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G4/kappa isotype that directly blocks the interaction between Programmed Death -1 (PD-1) and its 
ligands, PD-L1 and PDL-2. This immune checkpoint blockade enhances functional activity of the target lymphocytes to facilitate an antitumor immune

responsible for the binding of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine- based signalin g motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine- based

9 1.4.3 Clinical Findings  
Pharmacokinetics and Dosing 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were assessed during an open -label phase I trial 
of pembrolizumab  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) that evaluated three dose levels of 
monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors (1mg/kg, 3mg/kg, and 10mg/kg every 2 weeks). No dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed and 
all three dose levels were well -tolerated. This first in human study of 
pembrolizumab showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels evaluated .  No maximally tolerated dose 
(MTD ) has been identified to date. 
 Two dose levels are being evaluated in several phase II or III trials in metastatic melanoma and NSCLC (2mg/kg and 10mg/kg every 3 weeks) ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
NCT0 1905657) aft er initial data showed that every 2 week and 3 week dosing 
appeared equivalent. Based on these studies, it was determined that 2mg/kg and 10mg/kg dosing in melanoma had similar efficacy and safety with flat exposure-response relationships of pembrolizumab for efficacy and safety in the dose range of 2-10mg/kg q3weeks. In addition, there was no effect of tumor burden or 
disease indication on the distribution behavior of pembrolizumab as assessed by a population pharmacokinetic model. The half- life of pembrolizumab is estimated 
at 14 -21 days. 
 
A population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis  of pembrolizumab has been 
performed using serum concentration time data from 476 patients. Within the resulting population PK model, clearance and volume parameters of pembrolizumab were found to be dependent on body weight. The relationship between clearance and body wei ght, with an allometric exponent of 0.59, is 
within the range observed for other antibodies and supports both body weight normalized dosing or a fixed dose across all body weights ([COMPANY_006], written communication).    The choice of the 200 mg every 3 weeks  as an appropriate dose for the switch to 
fixed dosing of pembrolizumab (which is pending FDA approval, and which is incorporated into this study) is based on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks (the current FDA approved dose), 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe ([COMPANY_006], written communication) .  The fixed dosing 
regimen will also reduce poten tial for dosing errors and reduce the complexity 
associated with weight -based dosing.

been administered to, 14,0444 subjects, with hematologic malignancies and solid 
tumors, in a total of 19 Phase I, II, and III clinical trials sponsored by [CONTACT_44873]. Safety data are available for a total of 2799 subjects in 4 [COMPANY_006] -sponsored clinical 
trials. The majority of participants, 2727 or 97.4%, experienced 1 or more AE, and 2062 (73.7%) experienced 1 or more AE reported as drug- related by [CONTACT_1275].  Various dose-schedules, including 10mg/kg administered IV over [ADDRESS_785698] commonly reported treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) experienced  in monotherapy trials 
are fatigue ( 37.3%), nausea (2 4.5%), decreased appetite (22.5%), cough (2 2.0%), 
pruritus (2 0.1%), dyspnea (19.1%), arthralgia (18.0%), diarrhea (22.3%) and rash 
(17.8%).

42-48 Tumor progression in a murine AML model was 
associated with up -regulation of PD-1 on CD8+ T cells and an increase in 
regulatory T cells (Tregs).42 These experiments further demonstrated that PD -1 
knockout mice had less leukemia burden and increased OS upon AML challenge compared to wild- type mice, despi[INVESTIGATOR_435624] a similar percentage of 
Tregs. Blockade of PD -L1, furthermore, led to an increase in proliferation of 
CD8
+ T cells specific for leukemic blasts and reduced leukemic burden.42 Thus, 
the interaction between PD -1 and PD- L1 can facilitate Treg -induced suppression 
of CD8+ effector T cells (Teff) and dampen the anti -tumor immun e response. In 
primary leukemia samples, PD -L1 was shown to be up-regulated on AML blasts 
(including de novo expression), more so at relapse than at diagnosis, and wa s 
induced by [CONTACT_595228], such as IFN- γ and TNF- α.43,[ADDRESS_785700] on these leukemic cells with a PD-1-Ig fusion protein largely abolished this 
suppression. An intriguing phenomenon of “adaptive resistance” was seen in these experiments, whereby [CONTACT_595229]- stimulatory molecules on 
AML blasts, such as CD86 and ICOS ligand, led to specific T-cell expansion and activation. Leukemic cells in turn up- regulate PD -L1 and other co-inhibitory 
molecules and down- regulate co -stimulatory molecules in order to suppress 
subsequent T- cell activation.
46,47 This concept of adaptive resistance is also 
supported by [CONTACT_595230]- stimulatory molecules such 
as CD -86 and ICOS ligand were associated with worse outcomes in AML, as T-
cell activation eventually contributes to induction of immune escape mechanisms (i.e., PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA- 4).
48 Recently, Kronig et al.45 demonstrated that

than at initial diagnosis. The increased PD-L1 expression observed in these 
patients was due to both up-regulation as well as de novo expression on previously PD-L1 negative precursor cells. These data further support the concept of adaptive resistance in AML, whereby [CONTACT_595231] -1/PD- L1

45-[ADDRESS_785701] chemotherapeutic regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory AML. High doses of cytarabine (1- 3 gm/m
2) have been 
shown to be effective in induction, consolidation, and the treatment of relapsed and refractory disease.
8,12,49 The MTD  of cytarabine is 3 gm/m2 administered 
every 12 hours for up to 12 doses.8 However,  3 gm/m2 increases the risk for 
cerebellar toxicities (as outlined earlier), conjunctival toxicities, and prolonged 
myelosuppression. Further, patients >[ADDRESS_785702] heightened toxicity with HiDAC with increased rates of cerebellar toxicity.
12 It is also unclear 
whether 3 gm/m2 is superior to moderate doses (i.e., 1- 2 gm/m2) of cytarabine , the 
latter doses which have been investigated in combination with other chemotherapy agents . Based on these considerations, we plan to administer age -
adjusted HiDAC (age <60 years: 2 gm/m
2 IV Q12hours days 1-5 for a total of 10 
doses; age >60 years: 1.5 gm/m2 IV Q12hours days 1-5 for a total of 10 doses) to 
minimize toxicities at the time of pembrolizumab administration on day 14.  
Invest igational agents and regimens remain the priority in relapsed and refractory 
AML.21,[ADDRESS_785703], but 
response rates are low and not durable ( see section 1.3). Pembrolizumab will be 
administered on day 14, [ADDRESS_785704] no more than additive toxicit y.  Further, 
pembrolizumab administration will not be given concomitantly with cytarabine, 
but on day 14, 9 days after cytarabine therapy is completed.  Additionally, 
delaying pembrolizumab until day 14 should theoretically  create a maximally 
exhausted immune state in leukemia cells due to “adaptive resistance” after chemotherapy ( see sect ion 1.5). Patients who achieve a response (i.e., 
PR/CR/CRi) to the induction phase will receive pembrolizumab [ADDRESS_785705].  
 In this trial, toxicity will be monitored continuously, with sequential b oundaries 
employed to suspend the trial if excessive toxicity is seen. If the  study reaches a

1) to identify and characterize mechanisms involved in T cell dysfunction in 
AML, 2) to identify potential predictive biomarker candidates to allow better 
selection of  AML  patients who may benefit from pembrolizumab, 3) to identify 
new pathways that could be targeted to enhance the efficacy of pembrolizumab in 
AML , and 4) to assess for minimal residual disease after pembrolizumab . To 
accomplish these goals, we will perform Multiplex next generation sequencing of DNA and RNA from tumor cells, comprehensive kinome analyses to seek predictors of pembrolizumab activity, epi[INVESTIGATOR_595198] T cells via ChIP sequencing, multi-color flow cytometric analyses of immune markers pre and post- pembrolizumab to determine markers  of activity, and high-throughput DNA 
sequencing of T cell receptors IGH loci to determine T cell receptor repertoire and diversity in AML before and after pembrolizumab treatment.  
 We hypothesize that response to pembrolizumab will be associated with: 1)  
increased mRNA expression of PD -L1, 2) increased expression of general 
immune gene signatures associated with immune regulation, 3) clonal restriction in T- cell receptor (TCR) and B -cell receptor (BCR) repertoires, 4) increased 
tumor infiltration with eff ector cells of multiple lineages, 5) decreased tumor 
infiltration by [CONTACT_595232] . 
 Some or all of these correlative studies may be conducted under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_595199] (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_595200], MD UNC), currently under final review for funding.  All patients will have pre - and post-treatment tumor tissue (i.e., bone marrow

determine the dynamic nature of  immune signatures pre and post- pembrolizumab .

 Single method (one of the following is acceptable): 
• intrauterine device (IUD)  
• vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
• contraceptive rod implanted into the skin  
Combination method (requires use of two of the following): 
• diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical 
cap/spermicide)  
• cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)   • contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  • male condom or female condom (cannot be used toge ther)  
• hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] ( estrogen /progestin pi[INVESTIGATOR_401115]-only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous contraceptive injection  
 
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of 
contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by [CONTACT_176742]/IRBs.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto- thermal,  
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL

4.3.1 Toxicities and Dose Modifications for Pembrolizumab Maintenance  
Adverse events (both non- seriou s and serious) associated with pembrolizumab 
exposure may represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after t he first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment. 
Pembrolizumab must be withheld for drug- related toxicities and severe or life-
threatening AEs as per Table 3  below. See section  4.4 for supportive care 
guidelines, including use of corticosteroids. 
 
Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgica l events or 
logistical reasons not related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated 
medical events, patient vacation, and/or holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the Sponsor. The reason for interruption should be documented in the patient's study record.  
 If a dose of pembrolizumab  is delayed, then the subsequent dose should be 
administered 3 weeks later.   Patients may receive up to 1 year of treatment with 
pembrolizumab beginning on day 1 of maintenance therapy. In the event of dose delays/interruptions, subjects may not receive more than 1 total year of treatment beginning with day 1 of maintenance thera py.

To prevent cytarabine- related kerato -conjunctivitis, dexamethasone 0.1% 
ophthalmic eye drops (or per institutional formulary) must begin at least [ADDRESS_785748] practices  with the exception of 
systemic steroids (i.e., dexamethasone) . Use of systemic steroids during this trial 
is not allowed . Any 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5- HT3) rec eptor inhibitor (e.g., 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_595194] 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
29 ondansetron) combined with haloperidol or prochlorperazine as needed, will be 
used during chemotherapy infusions and during pembrolizumab administration, as needed.  
4.4.[ADDRESS_785749] gram -negative gastrointestinal infections 
(GI), candidiasis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV), while patients are aplastic, during induction phase, and as per standard of care. Antimicrobial prophylaxis will only occur in the maintenance phase if patients d evelop neutropenia (absolute 
neutrophil count <500/mcL).  
4.4.4 Colony Stimulating Factors 
The routine use of colony stimulating factors is not allowed. The use of colony 
stimulating factors in the presence of severe or life -threatening infection should 
be discu ssed with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_49205].  
4.4.5 Prevention and Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) 
Tumor lysis occurs as part of initial cytoreductive therapy. In its  most extreme 
form, TLS, is characterized by [CONTACT_203312], hyperphosphatemia, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), coagulopathy, and a potential cytokine release syndrome.   Tumor lysis labs consisting of basic metabolic panel, uric acid, calcium, and phosphate must be drawn a minimum of twice daily at least through day 5 of  
chemotherapy and once daily through day 10, until maximum tumor lysis has abated. The following precautionary and prophylaxis regimens are suggested prior to and during initial chemotherapy administration: 
• To prevent hyperuricemia, all patients with out known allergy will receive 
allopurinol 300-600 mg PO qday 24 hours prior to beginning chemotherapy and the allopurinol 300-600 mg PO qday continuing through the period of maximal tumor lysis (at least through day 8) or other antiuricemia regimen per institutional practice. Rasburicase may be used per institutional policy for hyperuricemia. Screening for G6PD deficiency should be obtained in susceptible populations before beginning r asburicase.  
• To decrease the risk of hyperphosphatemia, an oral phosphate binde r per 
institutional practice (e.g . sevelamer 400 -800 mg) will be administered orally 
every  8 hours beginning on day 1 of induction phase and continued as 
tolerated until maximum tumor lysis has occurred (at least day  8). 
• Cytokine release syndrome can occu r shortly after completion of drug 
infusion, accompany severe TLS, and present with fever, bronchospasm with dyspnea and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], altered blood pressure, myalgias, arthralgias, tumor pain and/or urticarial rash. Any patient with cytokine release syndrome should receive 20 mg dexamethasone (or equivalent steroid) 
IV immediately. Pembrolizumab must begin at least [ADDRESS_785750] dose 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL

30 of steroids for cytokine release syndrome.  
4.4.6 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care for Pembrolizumab Cycles  
Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_12707].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined 
below.  Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti- inflammatory agents if 
symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids.   Note that several  courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen 
when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.   Note:  if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the 
investigator does not ne ed to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined in  below ).  
 It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
 
Pneumonitis:  
o For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms 
improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
o For Grade 3 -4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  
Administer additional anti- inflammatory measure s, as needed.

symptoms of thyroid disorders. 
 Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2 -4 hypothyroidism): 
 In hyperthyroidism, non -selective beta- blockers (e.g. propranolol) 
are suggested as initial therapy.  
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement the rapy, with 
levothyroxine or liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care. 
 Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_78019]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. 
 
Hepatic : 
o For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until 
returned to baseline values (consider weekly).  
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 
hours.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
 
Renal  Failure or Nephritis:  
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids . 
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids . 
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
• Management of Infusion Reactions : Signs and symptoms usually develop during 
or shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.  
Section 4.2.2 shows treatment guidelines for subjects who experience an infusion 
reaction associated with administration of pembrolizumab ( MK-3475). 
 
Steven’s Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epi[INVESTIGATOR_19342] (TEN)

4.5 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited)  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are 
not allowed during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the [COMPANY_006] Clinical team.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician  
4.5.[ADDRESS_785751]’s welfare may 
be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_77981]. All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) including all prescription, over the counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids. If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF. 
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_785752] dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs and ECIs as defined in Section 7.2.  
4.5.2 Prohib ited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_595207]  
 
• Anti-cancer systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  with the exception 
of hydroxyurea  and intrathecal chemotherapy (c ytarabine and/or 
methotrexate) for CNS disease. Intrathecal chemotherapy will be permissible 
on maintenance phase of the protocol as long as the subject is continuing to have a clinical response to treatment. This should be discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_522838] a dministering intrathecal chemotherapy. Intrathecal chemotherapy 
should be administered at least 72 hours before/after pembrolizumab infusion. 
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol

participating in the trial.   Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited 
to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, 
BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu -Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.  
• Systemic Corticosteroids  for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms 
from an event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor.  
• Radiation therapy  
• Growth factor support (G- CSF or GM -CSF)  
 Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be 
medically necessary  
4.6 Duration of Therapy 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may 
continue until one of the following criteria applies: 
• Failure to achieve a PR, CR, or CRi after induction phase  
• Disease progression/relapse at any time during induction or maintenance phase 
• Receipt of allogeneic stem cell transplantation  
• Completion of 2 years of pembrolizumab maintenance therapy 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  while on pembrolizumab therapy as 
defined in section 2.4.2  
• Patient de cides to withdraw from study  
• Patient unable to comply with  protocol requirements 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition that render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

therapy)  an effort should be made to complete and report study assessments as 
thoroughly as possible.  At the time of withdrawal, the investigator should attempt 
to establish as completely as  possible the reason for the study withdrawal.  
• The subject  should be asked if they are willing to allow for the abstraction 
of relevant information from their medical record in order to meet the long term follow up (e.g., survival) objectives outlined in the protocol.   
• A complete final evaluation at the time of the subject ’s study withdrawal 
should be obtained with an explanation of why the subject  is withdrawing 
from the study.   
• If the subject  is noncompliant and does not return for an end of study 
follow up assessment, this should be documented in the eCRF.  
• If the reason for removal of a subject  from the study is an adverse event, 
the principal specific event will be recorded on the eCRF.  
 Excessive subject withdrawals  from p rotocol therapy or from the study can render 
the study un- interpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of  subjects should 
be avoided.

trials of pembrolizumab ) included fatigue, cough, nausea, pruritus, rash, 
decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgia, and diarrhea.  
 The following warnings are associated with the use of pembrolizumab:  
  
 Immune- Mediated Pneumonitis  
Pneumonitis occurred in ~3% of melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The median time to development of pneumonitis was 5 months with a median duration of 4.9 months.  The one patient with Grade 3 pneumonitis required initial treatment with high -dose systemic corticosteroids (greater than or  
equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper.Pneumonitis completely resolved in seven of the nine patients with Grade 2 -3 pneumonitis. 
 
Immune- Mediated Colitis  
Colitis (including microscopic colitis) occurred 1% of melanoma patients treated 
in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of was 6.5 months with a median duration of 2.6 months. All three patients with Grade 2 or 3 colitis were treated with high -dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day).  
Immune- Mediated Hepatitis  
Hepatitis (including autoimmune hepatitis) occurred in 0.5% of melanoma 
patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The time to onset was 22 days 
for the case of Grade 4 hepatitis which lasted 1.1 months. The patient with Grade 
4 hepatitis permanently discontinued pembrolizumab and was treated with high -
dose (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) systemic corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper. Both patients with hepatitis experienced complete resolution of the event.   
Immune- Mediated Hypophysitis   
Hypophysitis occurred in 0.5% of melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The time to onset was 1.7 months for the patient with Grade 4 hypophysitis and 1.3 months for the patient with Grade 2 hypophysitis. Both patients were treated with high -dose (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or 
equivalent per day) corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper and remain ed on a physiologic replacement dose.  
 
Renal Failure and Immune- Mediated Nephritis   
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_595194] 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
38 Nephritis occurred in 3 (0.7%) patients of melanoma patients treated in clinical 
trials of pembrolizumab , consisting of one case of Grade 2 autoimmune nephritis 
(0.2%) and two cases of interstitial nephritis with renal failure (0.5%), one Grade [ADDRESS_785760] dose of pembrolizumab ([ADDRESS_785761] dose) and lasted 3.2 months; this patient did not have a biopsy. Acute interstitial nephritis was 
confirmed by [CONTACT_240322] 3- 4 renal failure. All three 
patients fully recovered renal function with treatment with high -dose 
corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper . 
 
Immune- Mediated Hyperthyroidi sm  
Hyperthyroidism occurred in 5 (1.2%) of 411 melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The median time to onset was1.5 months and the median duration was 2.8 months (range 0.9 to 6.1). One of two patients with Grade 2 and the one patient with Grade 3 hyperthyroidism required initial treatment with high -dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper. One patient (0.2%) required permanent discontinuation of pembrolizumab due to hyperthyroidism. All five patients with hyperthyroidism experienced complete resolution of the event.  
Immune- Mediated Hypo thyroidi sm  
Hypothyroidism occurred in 34 (8.3%) of 411 melanoma patients treated in 
clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of hypothyroidism was 3.5 months. All but two of the patients with hypothyroidism were treated with long-term thyroidhormone replacement therapy. The other two patients only required short- term thyroid hormone replacement therapy. No patient received 
corticosteroids or discontinued pembrolizumab for management of hypothyroidism.Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment.   
Other Immune -Mediated Adverse Reactions  
Other clinically important immune -mediated adverse reactions can occur. The 
following clinically significant, immune -mediated adverse reactions occurred in 
less than 1% of patients treated with pembrolizumab, including exfoliative dermatitis, uveitis, arthritis, myositis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma, and  
adrenal insufficiency.  
 Across clinical studies with pembrolizumab in app roximately 2000 patients, the 
following additional clinically significant, immune -mediated adverse reactions 
were reported in less than 1% of patients: myasthenic syndrome, optic neuritis, and rhabdomyolysis.

39 Embryofetal Toxicity  
Based on its mechanism of action, pembrolizumab may cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. Animal models link the PD-1/PDL-[ADDRESS_785762] with maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue.  
 
Steven’s Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epi[INVESTIGATOR_19342] (TEN) 
The risk of SJS and TEN is reported at approximately 0.4 – [ADDRESS_785763]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the LCCC Multicenter Project Manager who will 
report the event  to [COMPANY_006] without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a 
serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other 
disabling or life -threatening complication to the mother or newborn).  The study 
investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the LCCC 
Multicenter  Project Manager. If a male subject impregnates his female partner the 
study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy

5.1.10 Overdose  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be defined as any dose of 1 ,000 mg or 
greater (≥ 5 times the indicated dose). No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. In the event of overdose, pembrolizumab should be discontinued and the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
 If an adverse event(s)  is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] 
product, the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are met.  
 If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non- serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the 
terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within [ADDRESS_785765] Manager who will report the event 
within 2 working days hours to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX [PHONE_1840]) (see section 7.3.3).  
5.2 Cytarabine 
Mechanism of action: Cytarabine works by [CONTACT_189101]. Cytosine 
gains entry into cells by a carrier process, and then must be converted to its active compound, aracytidine triphosphate. Cytosine is a pyrimidine analog, which is incorporated into DNA; however, its primary action is inhibition of DNA 
polymerase resulting in decreased DNA synthesis and repair.  
 
Product description: Cytarabine  (conventional) is commercially available in vials 
containing 20 mg/ml (25 ml) and 100 mg/ml (20 ml) solution for injection and are 
stable at room temperature.  
 
Solution preparation: Cytarabine can be compounded in 100- 1000 ml of NS or 
D5W and is stable at room temperature for 48 hours once compounded. Cytarabine 
solutions reconstituted with diluents containing benzyl  alcohol should not be used 
for intrathecal injections or for IV administration of high dose cytarabine (> 1 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_595194] 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
41 gm/m2). Solutions for parenteral administration are generally reconstituted to 
concentrations ranging from 20- 100 mg/ml, depending on the dose and the route of 
administration.  
 
Solutions are stable at room temperature for 7 days, but use within 48 hours of preparation , or refrigerated for 24 hours beyond use date, is recommended by [CONTACT_595239].  Furthermore, solutions prepared with diluents which do not contain 
preservative or bacteriostat, should be used within 8 hrs of vial entry to minimize the risk of bacterial contamination.  
 
Premedication:  Dexamethasone 0.1% ophthalmic eye drops should be administered 
>1 hour prior to cytarabine infusion to both eyes and continued Q6hours through day 12 of treatment.  
 
Route of administration : Cytarabine will be administered intravenously in a dose 
that adjusted due to age: <60 years: 2 gm/m2 IV Q12hours days 1 -5; > 60 years: 1.5  
gm/m2 IV Q12hours days 1-5 over 2 hours. The infusion should not be interrupted 
for the delivery of blood products, antibiotics, etc.

5.3 Adverse Events Associated with Cytarabine 
Serious and Common Adverse Effects:  
The most common toxicities associated with cytar abine, even when used at doses 
≤200mg/m2 include hematologic (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), 
gastrointestinal (nausea & vomiting (this agent is highly emetogenic ), diarrhea 
and mucositis), dermatologic (rash), hepatic (hepatic dysfunction, mild jaundice, transaminase elevations ), non- infectious fever, and alopecia. Additional toxicities 
associated with high dose cytarabine (≥ 1gm/m
2) include neurologic (primarily 
cerebellar  such as nystagmus, ataxia, abnormal gait), but also cerebral such as 
somnolence, psychosis, confusion seizures), ocular toxicity, and rarely pulmonary edema.

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_595194] 02, [ADDRESS_785779] ~ 60 days after the EOT visit 
(+/- 15 days) and will focus on any serious adverse events (SAEs) or any grade of 
Events of Clinical Interest that occur within 90 days of the end of pembrolizumab (or prior to start of new anti -cancer therapy).  Any such events must be recorded.   
Subsequent long- term follow up visits will take place as per inst itutional standard 
of care (i.e., typi[INVESTIGATOR_116511] 3 -6 months) and will be limited to history of any 
subsequent cancer treatments, an assessment of any SAE’s considered to be possibly or probably related to study treatment until resolution, and survival status.   
6.7 Correlative Studies Procedures  
These are described in more detail in the laboratory manual. NOTE: A tumor 
sample will be sent to [COMPANY_006] or their designated laboratory for evaluation of PD-L1 expression at baseline. See laboratory manual for additional details.  
 
Samples will be processed within [ADDRESS_785780] Operating Procedure Guidelines in the Laboratory Manual.   Some of the specific correlative details regarding specific antibodies, repertoires etc. may  vary from this protocol, but will be maintained and updated in the 
corresponding laboratory manual. 
6.7.1 mRNA S equencing (mRNA -seq) and P roteonomics  
mRNA- seq of bulk bone marrow leukocyte samples from diagnostic specimens 
will be performed for definition of tumor genetic subtypes, quantification of PD-L1 mRNA expression, and evaluation of gene expression signatures associated with immune activation and suppression.  Bulk bone marrow leukocyte samples will also be sorted into CD34
+ and CD34- subpopulations, and the CD34+ 
populations will undergo 1) mRNA-seq for neoantigen prediction and analysis of differential splicing, and 2) mass spectrometry for neoantigen confirmation. The 
CD34
- fraction will be stored for the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte 
cultures fo r confirmation of biologically valid neoantigens.   
 The mRNA -seq studies will involve genetic research where tumor gene 
expression profiling and analysis of somatic mutations will be included.  Appropriate informed consent for genetic research will be obtained prior to patient samples being processed.  
6.7.2 High -Throughput DNA sequencing  
Whole exome sequencing of CD34
+ AML blasts from bone marrow samples will 
be performed for somatic mutation detection and neoantigen prediction. From 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_595194] 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
51 
 bone marrow and peripheral blood leukocyte samples, T cell functional studies 
will be performed, and T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) 
repertoires will be amplified, sequenced, and analyzed to discover receptor profiles that correlate with response to thera py.  
6.7.3 Flow Cytometry/Immunohistochemistry of Immune Markers  
Bone marrow core biopsy blocks/slides may be stained for coexpression using the following panel of fluorescent antibodies (can include but not limited to): CD4/FoxP3, CD8/PD1, CD19/CD27, CD11b/CD33, CD47/CD68, along with immunohistochemistry staining using the following antibodies: PD -L1, IFN -γ, 
TNF -α, CTLA4, KIR3DL1, LAG3, CD200, Tim3 (HAVCR2), BTLA, CD137 
(TNFRSF9), CD40, OX40, CD27, ICOS, and GITR (TNFRSF18), which combined will enable quantific ation and localization of effector T cells, 
regulatory T cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells, antigen-experienced vs. non-experienced B cells, and suppressive macrophages. 
6.7.4 Minimal Residual Disease Analysis  
Cryopreserved mononuclear cells from bone marr ow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706]/or peripheral 
blood will be analyzed for minimal residual disease assays via flow cytometry, DNA or RNA PCR.  
6.8 Assessment of Safety  
Any patient who receives  pembrolizumab treatment on this protocol will be 
evaluable for toxicity. Each patient will be assessed periodically for the development of any toxicity according to the Time and Events table (6.0). Toxicity will be assessed according to NCI CTCAE v4.  Toxicities will be  
characterized in terms of seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken 
with regard to trial treatment.  
 For subjects receiving treatment with pembrolizumab , all AEs of unknown 
etiology associated with p embrolizumab exposure should be evaluated to 
determine if it is possibly an event of clinical interest (ECI) of a potentially immunologic etiology (termed immune -related adverse events, or irAEs); see the 
separate ECI guidance document (provided as a document separate from this 
protocol) regar ding the identification, evaluation and management of potential 
irAEs.   
 Please refer  to section 7.[ADDRESS_785781] received pembrolizumab within the induction phase (cycle) will be evaluable for assessment of response and progression. Efficacy of treatment will be assessed by a bone marrow biopsy at the time of hematologic recovery (i.e., absolute neutrophil count > 1,000/mcL and platelet count 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_595194] 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
52 
 >100,000/mcL), or by  [CONTACT_4475] 45 +/ - [ADDRESS_785782] international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_595242].21  
 
Complete remission  (CR) : Bone marrow blasts <5%; absence of Auer rods; 
absence of extramedullary di sease; absolute neutrophil count >1,000/mcL; 
platelet count >100,000/mcL; independence of red cell transfusions 
 
Complete remission with incomplete recovery (CRi): All CR criteria except for 
residual neutropenia (<1,000/mcL) or thrombocytopenia (<100,000/m cL) plus 
independent of platelet transfusions.  
 
Partial response (PR): bone marrow blasts 5- 25% and decrease of pretreatment 
bone marrow blast % by > 50%; all hematologic criteria of CR.  
 
Patients who achieve a PR to induction phase and then achieve CR aft er 
maintenance pembrolizumab will be assessed as an overall CR to study treatment.  
6.9.1 Progression -Free Survival  and Relapse  
Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as time from response (i.e., PR/CR/CRi) until disease progression or death. In patients who achieve a PR after 
Induction Phase, progression will be defined as  >50% increase in bone marrow blast % over baseline from beginning Maintenance Phase with a minimum 15% point increase in blasts, loss of PR (i.e., >25% bone marrow blasts), le ukemia-
related complications such as transfusion dependence, presence of extramedullary disease (including symptomatic CNS disease), or circulating blasts. This is 
consistent with European LeukemiaNet Guidelines 2017.
2 Progression will be 
defined as relaps e (i.e., >5% bone marrow blasts) in patients who initially 
achieved a CR or CRi with induction phase. Patients who undergo an allogeneic stem cell transplant will be censored for PFS.  
6.9.2 Relapse- Free Survival  
Relapse- free survival (RFS) will be defined as ti me from CR or CRi until relapse 
or death. Relapse will be defined as bone marrow blasts >5% in a patient who 
initially achieved a CR or CRi after induction phase. Patients who undergo an allogeneic stem cell transplant will be censored for RFS.  
 
7.0 ADVERSE E VENTS  
7.1 Definition s  
7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_595194] 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
53 
 drug) in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.   
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129297] (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE.  Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable by [CONTACT_353202]. 
7.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibility  that the drug is the cause.   Reasonable possibility  means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
 
Causality assessment to a study drug is a  medical judgment made in consideration 
of the following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study treatment, other recent or concomitant drug exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under investigation, and any other underlying or concurrent medical conditions.  Other factors to consider in considering drug as the cause of the AE: 
• Single occurrence of an uncommon event known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) 
• One or more occurr ences of an event not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e.g., tendon rupture); often more than once occurrence from one or multiple studies would be needed before the sponsor could determine that there is reasonable possibility  that the drug caused the event.   
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial that indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group  
7.1.[ADDRESS_785783] information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summar y of 
product characteristics for an approved product).  Unexpected also refers to AEs 
or SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_595194] 02, 2018   Amendment 07  
 
 
54 
 anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not 
specifically mentio ned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.   
7.1.4 Serious AE or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• Is life -threatening (places the  subject at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred);  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (>24 hours) or prolongation of 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];*  
• Results in  congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity o r substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious 
adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriat e medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  For reporting purposes, also consider the occurrences of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important medical event.  
 *Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_353184], central line insertion, metastasis interventional therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious adverse events.  
 Pregnancy that occurs during the study must also be reported as an SAE. 
• Note:  In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the 
below criteria, although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the [COMPANY_006] in the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are considered serious by [CONTACT_131892].

grade, onset and resolved dates (if applicable), and the relationship to the study 
drug.    Documentation should occur at least monthly.  
7.[ADDRESS_785785]  
7.3.1 Timing  
After informed consent but prior to initiation of study medications, only SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs related to 
invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout.   For any other experience or condition that meets the definition of an SAE or a 
serious SAR, recording of the event must begin from day 1 of study treatment and continue through the 90 day follow -up period after treatment is discontinued (or 
to the initiation of new anti- cancer treatment, whichever is earliest) .

that patient within [ADDRESS_785787] also be notified via email of all SAEs within 
24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  
7.3.3 Reporting  
IRB Reporting Requirements:  
UNC : 
• The UNC -IRB will be notified of all SAEs that qualify as an 
Unanticipated Problem as per the UNC IRB Policies using the IRB’s web-
based reporting system (see section 9.5.3) within 7 days of the Investigator becoming aware of the problem.   
 
Affiliate sites:   
• For affiliate sites using a local IRB of record, please submit adverse events per local IRB policy. 
• For affiliate sites relying on the UNC -IRB any SAEs that qualify as an 
Unanticipated Problem will be entered into Oncore and reported to the UNC IRB by [CONTACT_595243]’s web-based reporting 
system (see section 9.5.3) within [ADDRESS_785788] (spontaneously reported to them), including the pregnancy

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_595194] 02, [ADDRESS_785789]'s female partner that occurs during the trial or within  [ADDRESS_785790] be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted  ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and 
stillbirth must be reported as serious adverse events.   If the pregnancy continues 
to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported. Such events must be reported within [ADDRESS_785791] Manage r who will 
report the event  within 2 days to the manufacturer ([COMPANY_006]; see below [IP_ADDRESS]).  
 The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to the LCCC Multicenter  Project Manager within 24 hours via email 
([EMAIL_11364]) or via facsimile to [ADDRESS_785792], preferably one experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. 
  FDA Expedited Reporting requirements:  
A sponsor must report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected to the FDA. The sponsor must report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event, such as: 
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome); 
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g. tendon rupture); 
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group.  
The sponsor must submit each IND safety report on FDA Form 3500A. Each notification to FDA must bear prominent identification of its contents, i.e., “IND Safety Report,” and must be transmitted to the review division that has the 
responsibility for review of the IND. For this study, the review division is the 
Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.  In each IND safety report, the sponsor 
must identify all IND safety reports pr eviously submitted to FDA concerning a 
similar suspected adverse reaction and must analyze the significance of the 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_595194] 02, [ADDRESS_785793] be notified of unexpected fatal or life- threatening suspected adverse reactions as soon as 
possible but in no case later than 7 calendar day s after the sponsor’s initial receipt 
of the information. The sponsor must be notified of the SAE by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours of the event. If the results of a sponsor’s investigation show that an adverse event not initially determined to be report able is reportable, the 
sponsor must report such suspected adverse reaction in an IND safety report as soon as possible, but in no case later than [ADDRESS_785794] be identified as such, i.e., “Follow- up IND 
Safety Report.” Additionally, upon request from FDA, the sponsor must submit to FDA any additional data or information that the agency deems necessary, as soon as possible, but in no case later than [ADDRESS_785795] notify all participating i nvestigators (i.e., all investigators to 
whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting.   
Process  
If the sponsor deems that an event is both a serious adverse reaction (SAR) AND unexpected, it must also (in addition to OnCore
®) be recorded on the MedWatch 
Form 3500A as per 21 CFR 312.32. Unexpected adverse events or adverse reaction refers to an event or reaction that is not listed in the investigator’s brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or if an in vestigator’s 
brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigation plan or elsewhere in the current IND application.    The MedWatch form should be emailed or  faxed to the Multicenter  Proj ect 
Manager at [EMAIL_11364]

patients treated; 2) significant developments reported in the literature that may 
affect the safety of participants or the ethics of the study; 3) preliminary response 
data; and 4) summaries of team meetings that have occurred since the last report.  
Findings of the DSMC review will be disseminated by [CONTACT_87229], PRC, and the UNC IRB  and DSMB.   
8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Study Design and Sample Size  
This is a multi- center prospective open -label single arm phase 2 study assessing 
the activity of age-adjusted HiDAC ( <60 years: 2 gm/m2 IV Q12hours days 1-5; 
>60 years: 1.5 gm/m2 IV Q12hours days 1-5) salvage induction treatment 
followed by [CONTACT_79911] 200 mg IV on day 14 for relapsed or refractory AML patients.  
 
The subjects who achieve a response (CR, CRi, or PR) to induction phase HiDAC 
followed by [CONTACT_79911] [ADDRESS_785805] international European LeukemiaNet Guidelines in AML,
21 will receive 
pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3weeks of maintenance therapy beginning 10-30 days following full hematolog ic recovery from induction phase. Maintenance 
treatment will continue until disease progression, toxicity, physician and/or patient discretion, or up to 1 year of treatment.  
 
Simon’s like two-stage design  with relaxed stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_595213].
53 
The null hypothesis that the true CR rate (CR/CRi) for HiDAC followed by 
[CONTACT_595245] 20% will be tested against a one -sided alternative hypothesis. 
In this study, “relaxed stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” refers to inclusion of PR in the first stage as some of these PRs may convert to a CR during maintenance. In the first stage, 19 patients will be enrolled. If the  number of patients who achieve a CR/CRi plus the 
number of patients with PR is equal to  4 or fewer in these 19 patients, the study 
will be stopped. Otherwise, 18 additional patients will be enrolled for a total of 37 
patients. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 12 or more CR/CRi’s are observed 
in 37 patients.. Assuming that the PR rate has a uniform distribution, Uniform (0, 0.05), under H
0, this design yields a type [ADDRESS_785806] 5% and power of 
at least  84% when the true CR rate for HiDAC followed by [CONTACT_595245] 0.4.  
8.2 Continuous Monitoring for Toxicity 
Sequential boundaries will be used to monitor unacceptable toxicity rate in the 
trial. An unacceptable toxicity is defined as any drug -related grade 3 non -
hematologic toxicity  (exceptions inclu de infusion reactions, rash, fever , infection, 
nausea, fatigue and anorexia) persist ing for >7 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_21600]), or 
any drug -related grade 4 -5 non- hematologic toxicity  (excluding infection) . The 
accrual will be halted if excessive numbers of unacceptable toxicities is equal to 
LCCC 1522  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_595194] 02, 2018   Amendment 07

 or exceeds b n out of n patients with full follow -up (see Table below). This is a

enrollment will be continued in the same manner so that at any point in the trial the number of patients with unacceptable toxicities and the number of patients in the follow-up does not exceed b
n where n is the total number of patients accrued 
so far.   
8.3 Data Analysis Plans

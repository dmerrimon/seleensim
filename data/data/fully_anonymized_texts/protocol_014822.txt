 1 Introduction 
This document is a protocol for a human research study using brentuximab vedotin combined with 
multi-agent chemotherapy in patients with new diagnosis of primary CD30 positive primary 
mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or 
grey zone lymphoma (GZL). This study is to be conducted according to US and international 
standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title  21 part 312 and International Conference on 
Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and institutional research policies 
and procedures. 
 
The study started enrolling patients in January 2013 and as of December 2014, the Phase I 
portion concluded.  Six patients were treated per the Phase I protocol without evidence of DLT.  
Phase I data established a maximum tolerated dose of 1.8 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin. 
 
1.1 Background  
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoma worldwide accounting 
for about  25-30% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). In recent years, it has been 
increasingly recognized that  DLBCL is not just a single entity. It represents a group of 
aggressive lymphomas that have  heterogeneous clinical, immunohistochemical and genetic 
characteristics. 
 
Cluster of differentiation (CD) 30 is a cell membrane protein  of the tumor necrosis factor receptor  
family  and can serve as a tumor marker  (Schneider and Hubinger 2002,  1355-1366). It is a 
positive regulator of apoptosis,  and also has been shown to limit the proliferative potential of 
auto-reactive CD8 effector T  cells. CD30 is expressed on malignant cells in classical Hodgkin 
lymphoma (cHL), anaplastic large cell  lymphoma (ALCL), and also on some forms of DLBCL 
(Campuzano-Zuluaga et al. 2012,  1592; Slack et al. 2012, 1558). 
 
The usage of an anti-CD30 antibody drug conjugate presents an intriguing option for CD30 
positive B-cell lymphomas since CD30 expression was shown to be a promising target in 
other CD30-positive  tumors, such as cHL and ALCL. Using standard immunohistochemistry, 
CD30 is expressed in about 20-25% of DLBCLs, but the number is up to 70-80% in a DLBCL 
subtype called primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas (PMBL). The significance of CD30 
expression in B-cell lymphomas is actively being  investigated. 
 
The most common form of CD30 positive DLBCL is PMBL. It is considered a unique clinic-
pathologic  entity by [CONTACT_775412] (Swerdlow 2008,  439). 
It arises in the mediastinum, presumably from B-cells of thymic origin and represents less than 5% 
of DLBCL  (A Clinical Evaluation of the International Lymphoma Study Group Classification of 
Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. The Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma Classification Project. 1997, 3909-
3918). CD30 positivity in the majority of PMBL cases makes distinction from cHL  difficult at times; 
especially since clinical presentation with bulky mediastinal mass in younger patients is similar for 
both of these entities. CD30 expression in PMBL is usually heterogeneous when compared to 
cHL and may range from strong membrane staining of majority of the neoplastic cells to positivity 
of rare individual cells (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_775384]. 2003, S21- 6; Higgins and Warnke 1999, 241-247). Similarities 
in genetic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_775385] (Eberle et 
al. 2011,  558-566;  Rosenwald et al. 2003, 851-862). In some cases, pathologists may not be able 
to distinguish between  PMBL and cHL due to overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_775386]. In 2008,  WHO added an

 official category of aggressive lymphomas which are described as B-cell lymphomas, 
unclassifiable, with features  intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classical 
Hodgkin lymphoma (Swerdlow 2008,  439). These are usually referred to as grey zone 
lymphomas (GZL) and nearly 100% of these express  CD30. 
 
There is limited amount of data on the clinical outcomes of patients with PMBL, CD30 positive 
DLBCL, and GZL. For PMBL, some of the earlier studies suggested poor results with CHOP 
chemotherapy alone. Based on non-randomized comparisons, it appeared that more intense 
multi-agent regimens had better outcomes when compared to standard CHOP (Todeschini et 
al. 2004, 372-376; Zinzani et al. 2009, 381-385). However, the addition of anti-CD20 
monoclonal antibody rituximab to CHOP chemotherapy improved the inferior outcome of 
PMBL treated with CHOP (Rieger et al. 2011, 664-670; Tai et al. 2011, 604-612). On a 
subgroup analysis of the phase III Mabthera trial, addition of rituximab to chemotherapy in 
PMBL revealed improved event-free survival (EFS) compared to chemotherapy alone (78% 
vs. 52%) (Rieger et al. 2011, 664-670). 
 
While the optimal front-line treatment of PMBL remains controversial, rituximab-cyclophosphamide-
doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone (R-CHOP) is widely used in NCCN institutions (Zelenetz et al. 
2010,  288-334). Since residual mass after completing systemic therapy is not uncommon in PMBL 
patients,  some clinicians recommend consolidation with radiation therapy (RT), but this remains 
controversial. 
 
PET/CT imaging is used by [CONTACT_775413] (Savage et al. 
2012,  303). The clinical outcome of PMBL patients treated with R-CHOP with or without consolidative  
radiation remains inferior to those with the biologically related cHL treated with ABVD. 
 
Recently, Dunleavy et al published results of phase II NCI trial using dose adjusted etoposide-
prednisone-vincristine-doxorubicin-rituximab (EPOCH- R) regimen in PMBL with excellent result 
showing  EFS of 97% in a group of 51 patients (Dunleavy et al. 2013,  1408 -1416). Majority of 
patients did not require consolidative radiation. However, these results have not been confirmed 
in a larger cooperative  study and there are no randomized trials comparing this regimen to R-
CHOP in PMBL. Some concerns  such as long term toxicity, need for inpatient administration, 
and fertility issues with EPOCH-R have been  raised. 
 
Outcomes of patients with GZL are not well described in the literature, but anecdotally they 
appear  worse  when compared to cHL or to PMBL patients. Patients with CD30-positive DLBCL 
(excluding PMBL and  GZL) as a group may have better prognosis over CD30 negative cases, 
but that remains controversial  (Hu et al. 2013, 2715-2724). The CD30 positive DLBCL cases are 
more likely to be of non-germinal  center origin (Campuzano-Zuluaga et al. 2012,  1592; Slack et 
al. 2012, 1558). It has been shown that  non-germinal center origin subtype of DLBCL is less 
responsive to chemotherapy, but addition of monoclonal antibody rituximab improved outcomes 
to some extent (Lenz et al. 2008,  2313-2323). 
 
Patients with DLBCL of the elderly (defined as a histologically malignant polymorphic or 
monomorphic  EBV-positive B-cell lymphoproliferation in patients who are generally older than 
50 years without any known immunodeficiency, transplantation, or prior lymphoma) frequently 
have CD30 expressed on the  malignant lymphocytes and have a poor prognosis in small 
series (Shimoyama et al. 2009,  835-843). 
 
UPCC [ZIP_CODE]:  Brentuximab plus R-CHP in CD30 positive B-cell lymphomas 
Version date: 06.21.[ADDRESS_1065078] are treated 
either with R-CHOP or ABVD regimens with or without consolidative RT. Patients with CD30 
positive DLBCL  (excluding PMBL and GZL) are usually treated with R-CHOP. Some patients 
with aggressive lymphomas  including DLBCL with concerning features on presentation (bone 
marrow involvement, sinus disease,  testicular disease) may be considered for central nervous 
system (CNS) prophylaxis using intrathecal  chemotherapy, but guidelines are not based on 
randomized trials (Zelenetz et al. 2010, 288-334). 
 
Since the FDA approval of rituximab for NHL 15 years ago, there has been  only slow progress in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_775387]-line regimens in B-cell lymphomas. While R-CHOP 
works  well for a significant portion of patients with PMBL and DLBCL, there is a great need to 
develop less toxic and more effective treatment strategies. 
 
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Brentuximab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of three components: 
1) antibody cAC10, specific for human CD30 
2) highly potent antimicrotubule agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) 
3) protease-cleavable linker that covalently attaches MMAE to cAC10 
 
Brentuximab vedotin is proposed to have a multistep mechanism of action that is initiated by 
[CONTACT_106820]30 on the cell surface and internalization of the ADC.  Upon trafficking to 
lysosomes, MMAE is released from the conjugate through proteolytic degradation of the drug 
linker (Sutherland et al. 2006).  Binding of released MMAE to tubulin disrupts the microtubule 
network, leading to G2/M phase cell cycle  arrest and apoptosis (Francisco et al. 2003). 
 
In August 2011,  the FDA granted accelerated approval to this novel agent for the treatment of 
patients with cHL after failure of autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or after failure of at least 
two prior multiple  chemotherapy regimens in patients not eligible for ASCT. This marks the first 
new drug available for cHL  in more than 30 years. Currently this agent is under investigation in 
various clinical settings, including  front-line combination therapy with AVD chemotherapy in cHL, 
as well as in combination with multi-agent  chemotherapy for front-line treatment of CD30-positive 
mature T-cell and NK-cell neoplasms (Fanale et al. 2012,  60; Younes et al. 2011, 955). 
Brentuximab vedotin was also used in patients with CD30 positive  B-cell non-Hodgkin 
lymphomas as part of a phase II study in patients with refractory or relapsed setting  with overall 
response rate 35% (Jacobsen et al. 2012, 2746). It appears to be well tolerated as a 
monotherapy or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy with the main side effects being 
peripheral  neuropathy, fatigue, pyrexia, nausea and neutropenia. 
 
1.3 Preclinical Data  
Preclinical studies of brentuximab vedotin demonstrated antitumor activity in both in vitro and in 
vivo models. The toxicity of multiple doses of brentuximab vedotin has been assessed in rats 
and monkeys.   In both species, hypocellularity of the bone  marrow and lymphoid depletion of the 
thymus were observed.  Histopathologic lesions were also observed in the spleen in monkeys 
and in the liver and testes in rats. 
 
 
 
UPCC [ZIP_CODE]:  Brentuximab plus R-CHP in CD30 positive B-cell lymphomas 
Version date: 06.21.[ADDRESS_1065079] significant clinical toxicity was neutropenia, 
observed in monkeys, which resulted in secondary bacterial infections leading to early deaths at 
the 6 mg/kg dose.  Toxicity was dose- dependent,  with a no-observable-adverse-effect level of 0.5 
mg/kg in rats and 1 mg/kg  in monkeys. 
 
1.4 Clinical Data to Date  
The clinical safety data observed in the phase I dose-escalation study (SG035- 0001)  of 
brentuximab  vedotin administered once every 3 weeks support the 1.8 mg/kg dose level as the 
maximum tolerated  dose (MTD) and this dose and schedule has been selected for phase II 
studies as monotherapy. In this Phase I study, the most frequent adverse events (AEs) were 
peripheral neuropathy, constitutional (fatigue  and pyrexia), gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea), 
and hematologic (neutropenia) (Younes et al. 2010,  1812-1821). 
 
Recently published results of a multinational, open -label, phase II study established the efficacy 
and safety of brentuximab vedotin in [ADDRESS_1065080] 
(Younes et al. 2012,  2183-2189). In the absence of disease progression or prohibitive toxicity, 
patients received a  maximum of 16 cycles. The ORR was 75% with CR in 34% of patients. The 
median PFS time for all  patients was 5.[ADDRESS_1065081] common treatment-related 
adverse events were peripheral sensory  neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, neutropenia, and diarrhea. 
 
The clinical safety and activity of brentuximab vedotin in non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) were 
further  evaluated in a phase II study of patients with relapsed or refractory systemic ALCL 
(SG035- 0004)  (Pro et al. 2012,  2190 -2196). In this study, interim results showed all patients 
had previously received at least  one prior regimen of multi-agent systemic chemotherapy with 
curative intent. Relative to the most recent  therapy, 50% of patients were refractory. 
Additionally, approximately 60% of patients had primary  refractory disease, defined as failure to 
achieve a complete remission (CR) with front-line therapy or progression within 3 months of 
completing front-line therapy, and 24% of patients had never achieved a  response with any 
previous therapy. In this study of highly refractory patients, the objective response  (CR + PR) 
rate was approximately 86%, with 57% of patients achieving a CR. Brentuximab vedotin was  
generally well tolerated, with manageable side effects. 
 
Interim results of a phase II study using brentuximab vedotin in relapsed and refractory CD30 
positive  non-Hodgkin lymphomas other than ALCL was recently presented at ASH 2012  
(Jacobsen et al. 2012,  2746). Among 53 patients enrolled, 35 patients had B-cell neoplasms 
including 22 patients with DLBCL.  The responses to single agent brentuximab vedotin at 1.8 
mg/kg administered every 3 weeks (continued  until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity) were encouraging with 47% overall response rate in DLBCL (3 with complete 
remission, 4 with partial remission) (Jacobsen et al. 2012,  2746). 
 
Brentuximab vedotin has also been used in combination with CHOP like therapy (CHOP minus  
vincristine=CHP) in a phase I trial as front-line treatment for patients with ALCL (Fanale et al. 
2012,  60). Arm 1 of this study used sequential administration of brentuximab vedotin at 1.8 
mg/kg x 2 cycles  followed by 6 cycles of CHP  therapy and then followed by [CONTACT_775414] 1.8 mg/kg x 8 cycles.

In Arm 2 of this study, the brentuximab vedotin was given concurrently with CHP  chemotherapy x 
6 cycles  followed by [CONTACT_775415] 1.8 mg/kg x 10 cycles. Only 1 of 6 patients in Arm 2 
had a dose  limiting toxicity (DLT) (Grade 3 rash), but the MTD was not exceeded. Then, Arm 3 
was expanded at this dose to 14 more patients who overall tolerated the combination well 
(serious adverse events related to brentuximab vedotin were rash and febrile neutropenia). At 
the time of interim analysis, all [ADDRESS_1065082]  assessment for 3 patients who had discontinued 
treatment prior to Cycle 6. All patients (100%) achieved  an objective response, with 23 patients 
(88%) achieving a CR (Fanale et al. 2012,  60). The recommended dose for the front-line therapy 
for patients with CD30-positive mature T-cell lymphomas was 1.8 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin in 
combination with CHP.  
 
1.5 Study Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Targeted, monoclonal antibody based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_775388]. Addition of monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab to cytotoxic 
chemotherapy has been  shown to improve B-cell lymphoma outcomes in several settings, 
including first line treatment of DLBCL  (Coiffier et al. 2002, 235-242). Adding a novel antibody 
based therapy to chemoimmunotherapy regimen  may enhance efficacy and limit toxicity (both 
acute and long term toxicity). PMBL and GZL in particular  affect young adults, who may have 30-
[ADDRESS_1065083] of vincristine in R-CHOP as front-
line multi-agent chemotherapy for PMBL, CD30 positive DLBCL and GZL may be well tolerated 
and improve  outcomes in these patients. We propose a phase I/II, multi-center, single-arm, non-
randomized study in which CD30 positive, previously untreated PMBL, DLBCL and GZL patients 
will receive a combination of brentuximab vedotin, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and 
prednisone for a total of 6 cycles. 
 
The phase I component will evaluate safety and toxicity of the regimen, since the combination of 
brentuximab vedotin and R- CHP  has not previously been  studied. The phase II portion will 
further  investigate safety and toxicity. Overall response rate (ORR) at the conclusion of systemic 
therapy will be the primary end point of the phase II portion of the study, with secondary 
endpoints of complete remission  rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 
We will also correlate CD30 expression  and lymphoma subtype with clinical outcome. 
 
Due to the neurotoxicity profile of vincristine (vinca alkaloid) which is a part of R-CHOP 
regimen, there is a potential concern for additive neurotoxicity in combination with brentuximab 
vedotin. Vincristine has  only moderate contribution to activity in R-CHOP. Substitution of 
brentuximab vedotin for vincristine in this multi-agent combination is likely to enhance efficacy 
of R-CHP while avoiding potential increases in neurotoxicity. This is a safer approach than 
attempting to administer the two agents concurrently, where  doses of one or both agents may 
be limited by [CONTACT_775416].

 In the future, lymphoma management will involve combinations of targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_775389]. It 
is also clear that  early assessment of response during the course of therapy may become an 
important tool to tailor  treatment strategy (e.g. escalation or de-escalation of therapy). The 
expression level of CD30 (by  [CONTACT_9064]) on the surface of lymphoma cells did not 
correlate with the clinical response to brentuximab vedotin in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/mycosis 
fungoides (Krathen et al. 2012,  797), but could be an important correlate to investigate in B-cell 
lymphomas. Interim PET/CT imaging after two  cycles of ABVD chemotherapy is an early predictor 
of outcome in Hodgkin lymphoma patients (Hutchings  et al. 2006, 52-59) and is being 
incorporated into the design of current trials in this disease. PET/CT does  not appear to be as 
strong of a predictor in DLBCL treated with R-CHOP (Pregno et al. 2012,  2066-2073). 
 
The concurrent combination of brentuximab vedotin at 1.8 mg/kg and standard doses of CHP  has 
been  studied, reported, and safely administered as part of phase I trial for ALCL (Fanale et al. 
2012,  60).  However, the combination of brentuximab vedotin with CHP  and another monoclonal 
antibody (rituximab)  may result in some unexpected toxicities including higher risk of infections 
and myelotoxicity. Rituximab  administration alone may increase risks of developi[INVESTIGATOR_775390] (PML)  in some patients, although the absolute risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_775391] (Carson et al. 2009,  4834-4840). PML was also described in a few 
patients undergoing therapy with brentuximab vedotin. 
 
Therefore, subjects receiving the combination of rituximab and brentuximab vedotin will be 
closely  monitored for signs and symptoms of PML. The one DLT in the 6 ALCL patients treated 
on the combination of brentuximab vedotin with CHP phase I trial was rash. Rituximab label 
describes that only  1% of patients experience grade [ADDRESS_1065084] severe dermatologic 
side effects. Other treatment-related adverse events with incidence >30% seen on the 
combination of brentuximab vedotin with CHP  trial included nausea (58%), fatigue (50%), 
diarrhea (50%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (38%), and alopecia (38%) which are not 
expected to be greatly enhanced by [CONTACT_775417]. 
 
The Phase I portion of our study has completed and no DLT was found with the combination of 
standard R-CHP doses and brentuximab at 1.8 mg/kg, but patients continue to be closely 
monitored for long term side effects or rare effects that might have been missed in the small 
number of patients in the Phase I portion. 
 
 
1.5.[ADDRESS_1065085] frequently with large mediastinal mass and 
affects young adults (with female predominance).  There are also some characteristic 
immunophenotypic features of PMBL such as positivity for CD30, MUM1, and CD23.  However, it 
remains challenging to distinguish between PMBL and DLBCL with mediastinal involvement based 
on clinical and pathology findings alone. 
Interestingly, gene expression profiling (GEP) suggests a relationship between PMBL and 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma and this is further supported by [CONTACT_775418].

 Translocations involving the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA), as well as gains/amplification of 
chromosome 9p24.1 including the gene loci of JAK2 and programmed cell death protein 1 ligands 
(PDL1 and PDL2), have been detected frequently in cases of PMBL.  Several groups have 
described genetic signatures that can distinguish between PMBL vs DLBCL.  At this time, testing 
for these specific signatures is not part of routine pathology testing. 
Gene expression profiling of subject tumor samples to distinguish PMBL and non-PMBL subtypes 
would significantly strengthen pending outcomes and survival analysis of the primary study (UPCC 
[ZIP_CODE]).  This data may also further illuminate PMBL biology, including potential new therapeutic 
targets.  We aim to conduct a correlative study using Nanostring PanCancer multiplexed GEP 
technology to characterize gene expression patterns in the PMBL and DLBCL among our study 
participants. 
For those who participate in this correlative study, there exists a theoretical risk of tissue 
depletion.  This risk is variable for each patient and is dependent primarily upon the size of the 
archival sample.  For those patients with a large archival specimen, the risk of depletion is low, 
whereas those with a small amount of archived tissue have a higher risk of depletion. It is 
important to clarify that for the majority of patients in the study, the clinical utility of existing 
archived tissue is limited. If a participating patient develops recurrent disease, the standard of care 
would be to obtain tissue from the site of recurrence to guide further treatment decisions (instead 
of performing additional testing on the existing tissue).

3 Study Design 
3.1 General Design  
This is a Phase I/II, multicenter, single-arm, non-randomized, open  label study. All patients will 
receive  combination of brentuximab vedotin, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 
prednisone  approximately every 3 weeks for a total of 6 cycles. The Phase I portion of the 
study will determine the  safety and MTD of brentuximab vedotin when delivered in combination 
with R-CHP chemotherapy. The  Phase II portion of the study will further evaluate the activity of 
brentuximab vedotin when administered in combination with multi-agent chemotherapy in 
patients with CD30 positive PMBL, DLBCL, and GZL.  Safety assessments will include 
surveillance and recording of AEs, physical examination findings, and laboratory tests. Disease 
response will be assessed by [CONTACT_775419] (Cheson et al. 2007, 579-586).

4.6.[ADDRESS_1065096] be notified in writing if a patient is withdrawn from study 
treatment or from the study. The reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented in the patient’s 
medical records and CRF. The investigators will make every reasonable effort to keep each 
patient on the study until all  planned treatments and assessments have been performed. If a 
subject withdraws from study treatment,  every attempt should be made to follow the patient until 
death or administrative study closure. If a subject  withdraws consent to participate in the study, 
attempts should be made to obtain permission to record at least survival data up to the protocol-
described end of subject follow- up period. Final treatment  assessments will be performed before 
any other therapeutic intervention if possible. Additionally, any planned alternative treatments 
should be documented on the patient’s medical records and CRF.  Adequate attempts will be 
made to reach out to subjects to collect required follow- up. All attempts to reach subjects will be 
documented appropriately. Subjects will be considered lost to follow- up if phone  calls to the 
subject or to next of kin are not successful. 
5 Study Drug 
5.1 Description  
Brentuximab vedotin is an ADC  consisting of the chimeric antibody SGN- 30 (cAC10) chemically  
conjugated to a synthetic analog (monomethyl auristatin E [MMAE]) of the naturally occurring 
antitubulin  agent, dolastatin10. Brentuximab vedotin is proposed to have a multistep mechanism 
of action that is initiated by [CONTACT_106820]30 on the cell surface and internalization of the ADC.  
Upon trafficking to lysosomes, MMAE is released from the conjugate through proteolytic 
degradation of the drug linker  (Sutherland et al. 2006, [ZIP_CODE] -[ZIP_CODE]). Binding of released 
MMAE to tubulin disrupts the microtubule  network, leading to G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and 
apoptosis (Francisco et al. 2003,  1458 -1465). 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1065097] R-CHOP chemotherapy, but without vincristine (“R-
CHP”)  and with the addition of brentuximab vedotin. Therapy will be administered in 21-day 
cycles for a total of [ADDRESS_1065098] exposure vs. the less likely infusional 
reaction from  brentuximab. During Cycle 1, the brentuximab vedotin and the cytotoxic 
chemotherapy will be administered on Day 2. During Cycles 2 through 6, brentuximab vedotin and 
R-CHP will be administered  on Day 1. Prednisone (oral or intravenous steroid equivalent) will be 
administered on Days 1-[ADDRESS_1065099], then 
cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, followed by [CONTACT_775426]. Prednisone (oral or intravenous 
steroid equivalent) should be taken prior to rituximab  infusion.

*1.8 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin has been established as MTD per Phase I enrollment  
 
For R-CHP administration, dosing should be based on the patient’s baseline (pre-dose, Cycle 1 
Day 1) height and weight, or per institutional standards at the site. Doses will be adjusted for 
patients who  experience a change in weight ≥10% from baseline during the study. 
 
For brentuximab vedotin, actual weight at baseline (pre-dose, Cycle 1 Day 1) will be used except 
for patients weighing greater than 100 kg. For patients > [ADDRESS_1065100]  whole number of milligrams. Doses will be adjusted for patients who experience a 
change in weight ≥10% from baseline during the study. 
 
5.2.1 Dose Limiting Toxicities  
 
The initial planned dose of brentuximab vedotin for the Phase I cohort is 1.8 mg/kg. The 
Phase I 1.8  mg/kg cohort will enroll [ADDRESS_1065101] cycle of 
treatment. Dose de-escalation to 1.2 mg/kg will not occur unless ≥2 of 6 patients at the 1.8 
mg/kg dose level experience a  DLT, defined as any grade 3 or 4 new non-hematologic toxicity 
occurring during Cycle 1 requiring a dose  delay of >14 days from the planned Day 1 of Cycle 2 
(21 days from Day 1 of Cycle 1). 
 
Hematologic toxicities which are expected from multi-agent chemotherapy will not be considered 
for DLT  unless the hematologic toxicity will not return to baseline or ≤ grade 2 by 21 days from 
the planned Day 1  of Cycle 2. The hematologic toxicities will be managed according to the 
institutional guidelines.  Prophylactic use of G-CSF or GM-CSF and use of transfusions are 
allowed and should be administered  according to institutional guidelines. It is permissible to 
use G- CSF (filgrastim or pegfilgrastim) or GM-CSF empi[INVESTIGATOR_775392].

The DLT evaluation period consists of the time between Day 2 of Cycle 1 (following 
administration of brentuximab vedotin) up through the start of the Cycle 2. Therefore, only 
delays that occur during this  period will be considered for decisions regarding brentuximab 
vedotin dose de-escalation. Additional  safety experiences in Cycles 2-6 of the Phase I cohort 
will be monitored and closely recorded. These will  be considered when declaring MTD for 
Phase II of the trial. 
 
In Cycles 2- 6, the brentuximab vedotin dose may be withheld or modified according to the 
guidelines in Table 2. Rituximab dose modifications should not occur. Dose modifications to 
cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin chemotherapy and prednisone due to toxicity are discouraged, 
but allowed after the DLT  evaluation period (after Cycle 2 Day 1) at the discretion of the 
Investigator. These may include  adjustment of prednisone dose due to severe intolerance (e.g. 
psychiatric issues or severe hyperglycemia). Some elderly patients who develop severe (but 
expected) toxicities attributed to cytotoxic chemotherapy (e.g. recurrent neutropenic fevers 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] G-CSF) may be considered for  modification of the chemotherapy dose by [CONTACT_775427].  Practically, it is not possible to define exact 
modifications of the standard cytotoxic chemotherapy  component of the regimen, but we 
expect that only a very small minority of patients would need any modifications. Therefore, the 
impact on the quality of toxicity and efficacy data should be minimal if any. 
 
Initiation of the next cycle (Cycle 3 through 6) may be delayed for up to 3 weeks if additional 
time is required for the patient to recover from study treatment-associated toxicity experienced 
during the current  cycle. Delays of greater than 3 weeks are prohibited and will result in 
discontinuation of study  participation, unless an exception is granted by [CONTACT_9532], Sponsor and the Medical  Monitor. Patients who may develop some of the well 
described (but rare) toxicities of R-CHOP regimen  including new onset of cardiomyopathy or 
hemorrhagic cystitis will also be discontinued from the study  and best efforts will be made to 
attribute the toxicities accurately. 
 
If ≥2 of the initial 6 patients in the 1.8 mg/kg cohort experience a DLT, the MTD for brentuximab 
vedotin in combination with R- CHP  will be considered to have been  exceeded. Six patients will 
then be enrolled  and treated at 1.2 mg/kg and monitored for DLT during the first cycle of therapy. 
 
If ≤1 DLT occurs in the 6 patients in the 1.8 mg/kg cohort during the evaluation period, 
enrollment in Phase II will commence using 1.8 mg/kg.  If the dose was de-escalated to 1.2 
mg/kg and ≤1 DLT occurs  in the 6 patients in the 1.2 mg/kg cohort, then the Phase II will 
commence using 1.2 mg/kg. If ≥ 2 of 6 patients at the 1.2 mg/kg dose level experience a DLT, 
then the study will be terminated.

 5.2.2 Dose Modifications 
 
The Phase II part of this study will use the determined MTD of brentuximab vedotin. Dose 
modifications  for treatment-associated toxicity with brentuximab vedotin and R- CHP  (after the 
MDT was determined)  are summarized in Table 2. As described in detail in Section 7.1, we will 
raise a red flag if the Bayesian  probability that the serious toxicity rate exceeds 20% is greater 
than 90% in Phase II cohort. If the study  raises a red flag, we will review data and consider 
modification or termination of the trial for lack of safety.

a The next cycle may be delayed up to [ADDRESS_1065103] the brentuximab vedotin and 
rituximab held.  They will undergo a diagnostic work- up and if PML confirmed, patients will 
permanently discontinue  brentuximab vedotin and rituximab. Patients will be removed from the 
study if PML develops. 
 
The decision to use consolidative radiation therapy to any residual mass after completion of 
systemic  treatment will be at the discretion of the treating physician. However, radiation will 
not be started until  after the final response assessment after cycle 6 (days 21-28). The use 
of prophylactic intrathecal  therapy (with intrathecal methotrexate or cytarabine) in patients with 
high risk for CNS  relapse during or after completion of systemic therapy is allowed and will be 
determined by [CONTACT_1963].

Follow- up will be performed every 3  months (+/- 30 days) for the first year and every 3 – 6 
months (+/- 30 days) during the second year .   Follow- up information about the initiation of 
alternative therapy and survival status may be obtained from the medical record or via tele phone 
or email correspondence for up to 5 years after the end of treatment. 
 
5.3 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  
Brentuximab vedotin is a sterile, preservative-free, white to off-white lyophilized cake for 
reconstitution for  IV administration. Brentuximab vedotin is supplied by [CONTACT_775428]-use, Type 1 borosilicate  glass vials with FluroTec®-coated butyl rubber stoppers and 
aluminum seals. Each vial of the product  contains brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35), trehalose, 
sodium citrate, and polysorbate 80. 
 
For combination treatment with R- CHP,  administration of brentuximab vedotin will begin 
within  approximately one hour (up to 1.5 hours) after the completion of R-CHP infusion on 
Day 1 (± 1 day) of each 21-day cycle for cycles 2-6 and on Day 2 of Cycle 1. Planned dose 
level is 1.8 mg/kg. Brentuximab  vedotin is administered by [CONTACT_61863] [ADDRESS_1065105] not be administered as an IV push or bolus.  Brentuximab vedotin may  be 
administered through the same IV line used for R- CHP.  
 
In each case of brentuximab vedotin administration, dosing may be based on the patient’s 
baseline (pre-dose, Cycle 1 Day 1) weight or per institutional standards at the site; doses will be 
adjusted for patients  who experience a ≥10% change in weight during the study. Actual weight 
will be used except for patients  weighing greater than 100 kg; then the brentuximab vedotin dose 
will be calculated based on [ADDRESS_1065106] doses (Table 1). 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1065107] Compliance Monitoring  
Treatment administration will be performed by [CONTACT_775429]. Patient administration of the prednisone component of R-CHP chemotherapy will 
be documented  in the CRF (as self-reported and recorded in a diary) and reviewed to ensure 
compliance with the  treatment regimen. 
 
5.5 Premedication and Concomitant Therapy  
5.5.1 Premedication  
Routine premedication will be administered prior to rituximab administration for R- CHP  regimen 
on Day 1  of Cycles 2-6 consisting of acetaminophen (650 mg orally) and diphenhydramine (25–
50 mg orally or 10– 25 mg IV) or as per institutional guidelines. For Cycle 1 (split dose rituximab 
on Day 1 and Day 2) the same premedication before rituximab will be given on Day 1 and Day 2. 
Of note, the 100 mg of prednisone (or equivalent) for Day 1 and Day 2 (on Cycle 1) or on Day 1 
(Cycles 2- 6) should be administered with premedications prior rituximab infusion.

Version date: 06.21.[ADDRESS_1065108] dose of brentuximab vedotin (after R-CHP administration 
is completed).  Infusion-related reactions may occur during the infusion of brentuximab vedotin. 
The infusion should be administered at a site properly equipped and staffed to manage 
anaphylaxis, should it occur. The patient  should be observed for [ADDRESS_1065109] one hour to allow administration of IV drugs, if necessary. All supportive measures 
consistent with optimal patient care will be given throughout  the study according to institution 
standards. Medications for infusion related reactions, such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], antihistamines, and 
corticosteroids, should be available for immediate use. 
 
Patients who experience a Grade 1 or Grade 2 infusion-related reaction with brentuximab vedotin 
may receive subsequent brentuximab vedotin infusions with premedication consisting of 
acetaminophen (650  mg orally) and diphenhydramine (25– 50 mg orally or 10–25 mg IV) or 
according to institutional standards,  administered 30–[ADDRESS_1065110] dose of treatment (brentuximab vedotin or any component of R-CHP  
chemotherapy). Patients  should receive prophylaxis (e.g. allopurinol) as appropriate per 
institution standards. 
 
5.5.2 Concomitant Therapy 
The use of blood and platelet transfusions, and/or colony-stimulating factors per institutional 
practice is permitted during therapy. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_775393]-stimulating factors is allowed as per 
institutional  guidelines. Patients who develop documented neutropenia with an ANC ≤500/μL 
during Cycle 1 (CBC  will be obtained around day 8 of Cycle 1) will use G- CSF or GM-CSF 
support at that time and in subsequent cycles. Those who develop any grade 3 or 4 cytopenias 
or symptomatic cytopenias should  be transfused per institutional practice. 
 
Radiotherapy (RT) may be given at the investigator’s discretion no sooner than [ADDRESS_1065111] dose of brentuximab vedotin and after completion of final response assessment. 
 
Patients with high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_775394] (methotrexate or cytarabine) at the discretion of the treating physician and as per 
institutional standards during or after completion of systemic therapy. 
 
Patients may not receive other investigational drugs, immunosuppressive medications, or anti-
neoplastic  therapy during the study.

receipt  log filled out and signed by [CONTACT_17247]. It is important that the 
designated study  staff counts and verifies that the shipment contains all the items noted in the 
shipment inventory. Any  damaged or unusable study drug in a given shipment (active drug or 
comparator) will be documented in the study files. The investigator must notify study sponsor of 
any damaged or unusable study treatments  that were supplied to the investigator’s site. 
 
5.7.[ADDRESS_1065114] be refrigerated at 2–8°C in a controlled location 
accessible  only to the pharmacist, the investigator, or a duly designated person. Brentuximab 
vedotin (SGN-35) for  injection does  not contain preservatives; therefore, opened and 
reconstituted vials of brentuximab vedotin  must be used within the same day when stored under  
refrigeration at 2–8°C. It is recommended that  brentuximab vedotin vials and solutions be stored 
protected from direct sunlight until the time of use. 
 
Reconstituted vials must not be shaken. Drug accountability records will be kept according to the 
local standards of each institution. 
 
5.7.3 Return or Destruction of Study Drug 
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of drug shipped, drug 
consumed, and  drug remaining. This reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation 
form, signed and dated. Any  discrepancies noted will be investigated, resolved, and 
documented prior to return or destruction of unused study drug. Drug destroyed on site will be 
documented in the study files. 
 
6 Study Procedures  
6.1 Schedule of Events  
Concomitant medications information will be collected from the time of informed consent until the 
End of Treatment (EOT) visit or [ADDRESS_1065115] drug administration (Cycle 1/Day 1) until the End of Treatment 
(EOT) visit or [ADDRESS_1065116] dose, whichever is later. Other study activities are listed by [CONTACT_775430] 6.6. A schedule of 
events is provided in Appendix A.  Note: assessment schedule may be adjusted as needed to 
account for treatment delays.  The calendar may also be adjusted as needed in order to account for 
additional unscheduled visits (for example, if a subject has an unscheduled visit at 6 weeks 
following the end of treatment, the calendar may be adjusted to schedule the next assessment at 3 
months from the unscheduled visit timepoint).

6.5 Long Term Follow- up 
Patients who discontinue study treatment for any reason other than disease progression or 
initiation of a non-protocol therapy for treatment of lymphoma (other than RT or CNS prophylaxis 
with intrathecal chemotherapy) will remain on study for follow- up visits until 2 years from EOT or 
until disease progression or relapse or until they withdraw from the  study (see Section 4.6 ).  
Follow-up information about the initiation of alternative therapy and survival status may be

 6.6 Study Assessments 
Only patients who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria specified in Section 4 will be enrolled 
onto this study. 
 
6.6.1 Response Assessments 
Treatment response will be assessed by [CONTACT_775433]/CT and/or standard CT scans with IV 
contrast (chest, abdomen, pelvis and if clinically indicated the neck) at protocol-specified time 
points.   Non-contrast CT imaging may be used if IV contrast is contraindicated – a single modality 
should be used throughout the study. The determination of antitumor efficacy will be based on 
objective response assessments made according to the International Working Group Response 
Criteria for non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (Cheson et al. 2007, 579-586) and treatment decisions by [CONTACT_639652]. Clinical response of progressive disease (PD), 
stable disease (SD), partial remission (PR), or complete remission (CR) will be determined at each 
assessment. Up to [ADDRESS_1065122] 2 perpendicular dimensions; if possible 
they should be from disparate regions of the body; and they should include mediastinal and 
retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved. If the bone marrow was 
positive at baseline, a follow- up bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_775398] a CR. If the follow- up morphology is indeterminate, the biopsy tissue must be 
negative by [CONTACT_775434] a PR. 
 
Tumor imaging will be performed at screening, after Cycles 2, 4, and three to five weeks after 
Cycle 6, as well as whenever disease progression is suspected. The post-therapy imaging (3-5 
weeks after completion of Cycle 6) will be performed prior initiation of RT in patients who are 
planned to undergo consolidative RT. 
 
After the patient is withdrawn from study treatment for any reason, an additional response 
assessment  will be performed if an assessment has not been  performed within the prior 6 weeks. 
Patients may  continue on study treatment for a total of 6 cycles in the absence of disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. All patients’ clinical data  and tumor 
images must be available for CRF source verification. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_775399] (or its designee). 
 
6.6.2 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
The following laboratory assessments will be performed to evaluate safety at scheduled time 
points (see Appendix A) during the course of the study: 
 Chemistry panel, including sodium, chloride, potassium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum 
creatinine, calcium, total protein, albumin, glucose, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, 
AST 
 The hematology panel includes the following tests: white blood cell count, 
hemoglobin/hematocrit, and platelets and the differential includes: neutrophils, lymphocytes, 
monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils 
 Initial blood work will also include testing for HIV and Hepatitis B surface antibody, Hepatitis 
B core antibody, Hepatitis B surface antigen

 6.6.3 Other Study Assessments 
Other study assessments include the following: 
 Biopsies for CD30 expression: results of CD30 expression (quantitative estimate) from the  
diagnostic biopsy of PMBL, DLBCL or GZL will be obtained from pathology reports or 
from review  of the biopsy specimen 
 Patient medical history, including a thorough review of: 
o The patient’s current and previous conditions 
o Concomitant medications and prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
 Physical examination, including evaluation of skin, HEENT  (head, eyes, ears, nose, and 
throat),  nodes, spleen, heart, lungs, abdomen, back, and extremities. Neurological exam 
will include  gross assessment of mental status, strength, and sensation. Any new 
neurological symptoms  concerning for PML will be worked up immediately. 
 ECOG performance status 
 B symptom assessment (unexplained fevers greater than 38°C, drenching night sweats 
and/or weight loss greater than 10% of body weight) 
6.7 Correlative Study Procedures 
Patients will be consented in person or by [CONTACT_775435]-up requirements.  Those consented by [CONTACT_775436] a description of the correlative 
study to patients via the [LOCATION_002] Postal Service.  A member of the study team will then call 
patients to describe the study and risks and to provide an opportunity to ask any questions.  The 
study staff will then obtain verbal consent for participation in the correlative stud y.  If the study 
team is unable to reach patients by [CONTACT_756], an email will be sent to the address previously 
provided by [CONTACT_102], requesting the patient to reply via email to indicate willingness to 
participate.  A phone number will be included in order to provide an opportunity to answer any 
questions and to further discuss the correlative study.  
After consent has been obtained, archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue 
will be retrieved and 8-10 rolls (or slices) of fixed tissue will be collected from each specimen as 
available.  RNA will be isolated from each specimen and, in collaboration with  the Centre for 
Lymphoid Cancer, gene expression profiling will be performed using a customized Nanostring 
PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel.  This panel has been designed to help distinguish between 
PMBL and CD30+ DLBCL.  Statistical analysis will be conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Marco Ruella and [CONTACT_775452] at the University of Pennsylvania in conjunction with statistical support from

patients. The  operating characteristics of the dose de-escalation scheme are presented here. 
If the true proportion of patients that would experience a DLT is 10%, then the probability of de-
escalating to the lower dose  cohort when 2 or more patients experiences a DLT is 9%. If the 
true proportion of patients that would  experience a DLT is 50%, then the probability of dose de-
escalation is 83%.

Version date: 06.21.[ADDRESS_1065124] as the Phase II 
subjects, the 6 Phase I subjects accrued at the MTD will be considered as accrued to the Phase II 
study  as well. The total number of subjects recruited to Phase II will be affected by [CONTACT_775437]. 
 
We design this trial with the potential for early termination in the case of a poor overall response rate  
(ORR). We will use the optimal two-stage design of Simon. Choice of design is guided by a desire 
to stop the trial early if the actual ORR is 50% or less. If the ORR is 70% or greater, we would like 
to have a  low probability of failing to conclude the combination is effective. We select the type I 
error rate  (probability of accepting the drug if the ORR = 50%) to be 10% and the type II error rate 
(probability of rejecting the drug if the ORR = 70%) to be 20%. The table below gives the optimal 
(smallest expected  sample size under  the null) two-stage design exhibiting these properties.

Under the null hypothesis of a 50% ORR, this design has an expected sample size of 19.7 and 
a probability of early termination of 0.61. 
 
With n=[ADDRESS_1065125] 90% power to detect any unforeseen toxicity that occurs in 
6.9% or more  of patients. The standard error of any proportion will be no larger than 8.8%. 
 
We will monitor continuously for toxicity in the phase II portion of the trial. We will raise a red 
flag if the Bayesian probability that the serious toxicity rate exceeds 20% is greater than 90%. 
Assuming a beta  (2,6) prior (equivalent to 1 toxicity in 6 prior patients), we will raise a red flag if 
the first [ADDRESS_1065126], 8 by [CONTACT_941] 25th, 9 by [CONTACT_941] 29th, 
and 10 by [CONTACT_941] 32nd. If the study raises a  red flag, we will review data and consider modification 
or termination of the trial for lack of safety. 
 
7.2 Statistical Methods  
The ORR and CR rate and its two-sided 95% exact confidence interval will be calculated using the  
Clopper-Pearson method. PFS and OS at year 1 and 2 will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method.  The median PFS and 95% confidence interval will be calculated where possible. We will 
calculate ORR,  CR, PFS, and OS for all the subjects as a group and also separately for each 
subtype (PMBL, DLBCL,  GZL). 
 
We will assess correlation of baseline CD30 expression level with clinical response by a two-
sample t test comparing mean CD30 level among complete responders to the level among 
those who do not have  complete responses. We will assess correlation of baseline CD30 level 
with survival outcomes (PFS, OS)  by [CONTACT_775438], taking 
baseline CD30 level as a continuous predictor.

 For the correlative study with multiplexed gene expression profiling of primary tumor samples, the 
statistics are descriptive.  The data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_147572] a single linear predictor score 
for each biopsy sample.  Based on the distributions of linear predictor scores in each cancer group, 
Bayes rule can be used to estimate the probability that a sample belongs to cancer group A (ie 
PMBL) vs cancer group B (DLBCL, non-PMBL). An arbitrary probability cutoff of ≥90% will be used 
to classify a sample into a subgroup and correlation with outcome will be conducted. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_1065127] Population(s) for Analysis  
All patients who are enrolled in the study and receive any clinical trial material will be included in the 
intent- to-treat analysis. All safety analyses will be performed on the intent- to treat population. The  
efficacy analysis will include any patient who has received at least one dose of the investigational 
drug brentuximab vedotin and were evaluable for response. We will allow up to 4 additional patients 
to be enrolled in the Phase II part of the study to substitute for the missing data. All estimates of 
rates (e.g.,  response and toxicity) will be presented with corresponding confidence intervals. 
 
7.4 Study Endpoint Definitions 
 
7.4.1 Objective Response Rate  
 
Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of patients with CR or PR according to the 
International Working Group Response Criteria for non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (Cheson et al. 2007, 
579-586) as of the designated time point for the treatment period under consideration. 
Patients whose disease  response cannot be assessed, including those patients who do not 
have CT scans performed, will be scored as non-responders for calculating the ORR. 
 
7.4.2 Complete Remission Rate 
 
Complete remission rate is defined as the proportion of patients with CR according to the 
International  Working Group Response Criteria for non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (Cheson et al. 
2007, 579-586) as of the designated time point for the treatment period under  consideration. 
 
7.4.3 Progression-Free Survival 
 
Progression-free survival is defined as the time from start of study treatment (brentuximab 
vedotin with R- CHP  chemotherapy) to first documentation of objective tumor progression or to 
death due to any cause,  whichever comes first. Progression-free survival data will be censored 
on the day following the date of the last lymphoma assessment documenting absence of 
progressive disease for patients who do not have objective tumor progression and are still on 
study at the time of an analysis, are given antitumor treatment other than the study treatment or 
stem cell transplant, or are removed from study prior to documentation of objective tumor 
progression. Patients lacking an evaluation of tumor response after their first dose will have their 
event time censored at day one. 
 
7.4.4 Overall Survival 
 
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from start of study treatment to date of death due 
to any cause. In the absence of confirmation of death, survival time will be censored at the last 
date the patient  is known to be alive. Patients lacking data beyond the day of first dose will 
have their survival time  censored at day one.

8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency (i.e. not described in study-related 
documents such  as the IRB-approved protocol or consent form, the investigators 
brochure, etc.) 
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly related 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome 
may have been  caused by [CONTACT_3459]) 
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm 
(including physical,  psychological, economic, or social harm) 
 
Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity  during the course of the study. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as 
adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if 
the abnormality: 
 results in study withdrawal 
 is associated with a serious adverse event 
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
 is considered by [CONTACT_29756]-serious. A serious adverse event is any AE 
that is: 
 fatal 
 life-threatening 
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 an important medical event 
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly 
of major  clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to 
prevent one of the  other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, 
a seizure that did not result  in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm 
in an emergency department would  typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355]. 
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-
serious adverse events .

Version date: 06.21.[ADDRESS_1065128] study treatment (Cycle 1/Day 1) to the end of the study 
treatment follow- up. For this study, the study treatment follow- up is defined as [ADDRESS_1065129] administration of study  treatment. 
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study. A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the 
condition worsens during  the study period. 
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition. 
At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the 
definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event. 
 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_16469], the  subject is lost to follow- up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained. At the last 
scheduled visit, the  investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) 
that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to 
participation in this study. The  investigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or 
adverse event occurring at any time after a  subject has discontinued or terminated study 
participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor should also be notified if 
the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly 
in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated  in this study. 
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the 
following  conditio ns is met: 
 The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the 
abnormality 
 The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity 
 The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic 
investigation, etc. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_202110] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed 
otherwise in this protocol. Any  condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an 
adverse event if the condition meets the  criteria for and adverse event.

 Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse  event in the following circumstances: 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] 
a preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if 
the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842]. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], 
unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49849]. 
8.[ADDRESS_1065130] seek information on adverse events by 
[CONTACT_774474], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Information on all adverse events 
should be recorded  immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse 
event module of the case report  form (CRF). Adverse events will be graded according to the 
CTCAE v4.0. NOTE: Adverse events reported after March 29, [ADDRESS_1065131] be reported are those that are: 
 related to study participation 
 unexpected, and 
 serious or involve risks to subjects or others (see definitions, Section 8.1). 
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_775400] (e.g., surgery was performed earlier or later 
than planned). 
 
For both serious and non-serious AEs, the investigator must determine both the intensity of the 
event and the relationship of the event to study drug administration. If the relationship to the 
study drug cannot be determined at the time of the initial SAE report, the event should be 
considered possibly related until  additional information is available to fully evaluate the event. 
 
Intensity for each AE, including any lab abnormality, will be determined using the NCI CTCAE, 
Version 4.0.   NOTE: Adverse events reported after March 29, 2018 should be graded using the 
CTCAE version 5.0.

Version date: 06.21.[ADDRESS_1065132]:  
Serious adverse events which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_775401] 10 working days of 
investigator notification.  An event is considered “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are 
not accurately reflected in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research 
protocol, any applicable investigator  brochure, applicable package insert information, and/or 
the current IRB-approved informed consent  document. An event is considered “related to the 
research procedures” if the event is deemed probably  or definitely related. 
 
Deaths occurring for patients on-study and within 30 days of study drug administration that are  
considered unforeseen and indicates participants or others are at increased risk of harm (i.e. 
unexpected  and probably/definitely related), must be reported to the IRB within 24 hours of 
notification. 
 
In addition, if other information becomes available that indicates a change to the risks or potential 
benefits  of the research, in terms of severity or frequency, this should be reported within 3 days. 
Examples of this  include: 
 An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to treatment 
than initially expected. 
 Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent 
than initially expected. 
 A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research study is 
of no therapeutic value. 
 Any adverse event that represents a serious, unexpected problem that is rare in absence 
of drug exposure. 
 Withdrawal from marketing for safety of a drug, device, or biologic used in a research 
protocol. 
 Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate 
hazard to a research participant. 
 Violation, meaning an accidental or unintentional change to the IRB approved protocol that 
placed one or more participants at increased risk, or has potential to occur again. 
 Breach of confidentiality. 
The IRB will accept other reports when the investigator is unsure whether the event should be 
reported,  and the IRB will review such reports to determine whether the event meets the 
threshold for an unanticipated event presenting risk to the participant.

Reportable Events: 
A one-time accidental or unintentional deviation from the approved protocol, identified 
retrospectively,  that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_196979], placed one 
or more participants at increased risk, compromises the rights or welfare of subjects, and/or 
disrupts the study design, is considered a reportable event and must be reported to the Study 
Principal Investigator, Study Medical  Monitor, IRB, and ACC DSMC within 10 working days of 
notification. Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_775402]/ acknowledgement must be 
received first and included in with the IRB/DSMC  submission. 
 
Deviations to protect subjects from immediate harm/danger should be reported immediately 
following the  event to the entities outlined above. 
Exceptions: 
An exception is defined as a one-time, unintentional action or process that departs from the 
IRB and CTSRMC approved study protocol, intended for one occurrence. AND  this action 
disrupts the study  progress, such that the study design or outcome (endpoints) may be 
compromised, or the action  compromises the safety and welfare of study subjects (i.e. requests

 10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], 
government  regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all 
study related  documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection 
instruments, study data etc.). 
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by 
[CONTACT_775444]. 
 
This investigator-initiated protocol is considered high risk as per the ACC DSMC. As such, high 
risk protocols are audited approximately six months from their first subject accrual and 
approximately every  six months thereafter for the duration of the study by [CONTACT_775445]  (DOCM). However, this schedule may be changed at the discretion of 
the DSMC. High or quick enrolling  studies may be audited more frequently as necessary. 
 
The investigator will be notified in advance of the selection of their protocol for review and 
cases are  randomly selected. Three randomly selected subjects or 10% of the total accrual 
(up to 10 subjects),  whichever is higher, are audited. A formal report is written to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_775405]  5 business days of the audit. The committee may alter the frequency of re-monitoring 
based on the audit findings and degree of deficiencies. 
 
Upon review of inspection findings, the Committee designates the audit outcome as Minor, 
Moderate, or Major deficiencies. The deficiency assigned by [CONTACT_775446]- up actions. 
 
If an audit is unacceptable due to major deficiencies, representatives from the Department of

1. All screening procedures should be performed within 28 days of C1D1, with the exception of baseline imaging, which  should be obtained 
within 2 months (60 days) of C1D1. 
2. Assessments performed within 7 days of starting therapy do not need to be repeated on C1D1. 
3. +/- 3 days 
4. +/- [ADDRESS_1065152] within 7 days of starting therapy is required for women of childbearing potential. 
9. Bone marrow biopsy at screening is elective and at discretion of the treating physician. EOT bone marrow should be done in those patients 
who had positive screening bone marrow biopsy in order to document complete response. 
10. PET/CT and/or dedicated CT with contrast of chest, abdomen, pelvis (+/- neck) are the recommended modality of radiographic imaging 
during staging and final response assessment after cycle 6. (unless contrast is contraindicated). Imaging studies should be performed within 
60 days of C1D1 of treatment and three to five weeks after the completion of Cycle 6 (prior to radiation therapy).  Interim imaging (using CT 
scans) will be done after cycle 2 and 4.  Surveillance imaging using PET/CT or dedicated CT C/A/P at least every 8 months (+/- 30 days ) 
thereafter for the first [ADDRESS_1065153] dose of rituximab will be administered as a split dose: 100 mg/ m2 will be administered on  Cycle 1, Day 1, and 275 mg/ m2  will be 
administered on Cycle 1, Day 2. The full dose of rituximab (375 mg/ m2) will be administered on Day 1 of subsequent cycles. 
12. Prednisone should be administered on Days 1-5 of each cycle, at a dose of 100 mg po, or the IV equivalent steroid dose. 
13. Evaluations to be performed +/- [ADDRESS_1065154] or via 
telephone or email correspondence for up to 5 years after the end of treatment.

Study Title : A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389130]-acoustics to diagnose breast masses 
detected by [CONTACT_217222]/or clinical findings : A NEw Evaluation Tool 
for Radiologists  
 
Study Phase  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], Non -Significant Risk  Study   
 Name [CONTACT_389316]  
(Investigational Device):   Imagio , is an opto-acoustic (OA) imaging system designed to concurrently 
collect images in conjunction with diagnostic ultrasound (co -registered OA 
and B-mode imaging) . 
  
Indications for Use:  Imagio  is indicated for use for opto-acoustic (OA) evaluation of breasts in 
women who are referred for a diagnostic breast ultrasound work -up due to 
a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389131] (including both palpable and non -palpable) or an imaging 
finding such as architectural distortion, asymmetry, or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389132] .  
  This device is not intended to be used as a replacement for mammographic screening or for definitive pathologic diagnosis.  
 
Study Objectives  
 and Endpoints :  The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Imagio  for the vis ualization of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389133] .  The following outcomes  will be evaluated to 
determine whether I magio : 
 
1. Has superior specificity (primary) relative to  Imagio ultrasound  (IUS) 
with non -inferior sensitivity (secondary)  relative to I US.  
2. Has clinically acceptable predictive value of a positive test (PPV) and of 
a negative test (NPV) for a range of possible  breast cancer prevalence . 
3. Downgrades benign masses classified as BI -RADS 3, 4a, or 4b relative to 
IUS. 
4. Downgrades  masses classified as BI -RADS 3, 4a, or 4b according to the 
site investigator.  
5. Upgrades malignant  masses classified as BI -RADS 3, 4a, or 4b relative to 
IUS.

Study Design:    This is a prospective, controlled, multi -center , observational study that will 
compare Imagio OA versus the ultrasound component  (IUS) for the 
visualization of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389134] .   
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688]:                     The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389135]) data will be used to 
validate the existing algorithm to a pre -determined diagnostic rule set 
based on OA image characteristics established in a previously conducted 
independent Feasibility Study. The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389136] [ADDRESS_487713] 20 other independent radiologists  (readers)  not 
affiliated with any sites will be prospectively trained and then tested for 
proficiency using the image sets constructed by [CONTACT_389211] [ADDRESS_487714] 30 cases will be used to 
familiarize  readers with the image sets, the viewing logistics, and the eCRF 
to be completed , prior to reader proficiency testing .  Upon establishing 
and meeting prospective rules for proficiency (based on Imagio sensitivity  
[missing at most one cancer]  and Imagio sp ecificity >30%  after excluding 
the first 30 cases to allow for learning ), a subset of  7 proficient readers will 
be selected for  purposes of   read ing IUS and Imagio  OA and 3 other 
readers will be selected to share the  reimbursement reads  of multiple 
combina tions of imaging modalities with or without Imagio,    The 
registration readers will be selected  at random based on availability and 
once all readers are tested for proficiency;  reimbursement readers will be 
selected by [CONTACT_389212].  All registration readers will be 
proficiency tested and selected prior to making any Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688] i.e., reads 
for subjects 101  and beyond , which will constitute the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688] .  All 
effectiveness analyses will be conducted at the mass -level ; it is projecte d 
that no more than 5% of all subjects will have multiple masses.  A 
minimum of  [ADDRESS_487715] 1, 700 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389137].  The 100 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389138], training, and publication purposes; o nly the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389139].  All selected registration readers will 
evaluate all masses  according to a MRMC design.  To mimic  the real world 
setting as closely as possible, all readers will receive feedback on the histo pathology results in read only mode following their case  reads  after 
completing their locked evaluations; readers may not change results after 
receiving feedback.  For the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688], subsets of 5% of registration image sets and 2.5% of all reimbursement image sets will be reread to 
assess learning and consistency ; the first reads will be used in the data 
analyses for registration and reimbursement .  The PMA filing will be based

Doppler using a single  linear conventional ultrasound probe will be 
separately assessed for research purposes and the Doppler information 
will not be used in the analysis of this study for determining the safety 
and effectiveness of Imagio.   
 
Control:    The subject  will serve as her own control for the study.  Imagio  OA 
evaluation results will be compared with the Imagio ultraso und 
component (IUS) for the registration read and Imagio will also be 
assessed  in combination with Mammography and conventional 
diagnostic ultrasound (CDU) image  sets for the reimbursement reads .  
The ultrasound component of Imagio, designated IUS, will serve as 
the “internal control .”  If a biopsy is performed, then the histology 
will serve as the gold standard; if a biopsy is not performed at study 
entry or for 12 months following study entry with no change in the 
target mass according to CDU  (if perfo rmed ), then the subject is 
considered to be a True -Negative for analysis purposes  as  confirm ed 
by [CONTACT_389217] .  
 
Study Duration:    The duration of study participation for each subject will be up to [ADDRESS_487721] visit is anticipated to be 24 months.

years. Yet, it remains difficult to definitively diagnose witho ut performing a biopsy despi[INVESTIGATOR_389144]. According to the American College of Radiology (ACR), the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® are “evidence -based 
guidelines to assist referring physicians a nd other providers in making the most appropriate 
imaging or treatment decision for a specific clinical condition. By [CONTACT_389218], providers enhance quality of care and contribute to the most efficacious use of radiology . The 
guidelines are developed by [CONTACT_389219], interventional radiology, and 
radiation oncology . Each panel includes leaders in radiology and other specialties. There are more 
than 175 topi[INVESTIGATOR_389145] 850 variants in the March 2011 version” [2] . The fo cus of these 
guidelines is to address the on- going dilemma of the majority of biopsies performed resulting in a 
benign diagnosis, thus representing an excessive number of procedures and a significant burden 
on current delivery of healthcare and on the subj ect. 
 There are multiple reasons for the bias toward performing a biopsy beyond the psychological burden of a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389146] . Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with variability 
in genetic and hormonal influences, which contribute to its var ied pathobiology [3] . Consequently, 
the clinical and radiographic manifestations and histopathology of breast cancer are variable . 
Furthermore, breast tissue is also heterogeneous containing fat, glandular and fibrous tissue . The 
structure of the br east and the nature of breast cancer present a great challenge for imaging 
technologies to detect cancerous masses  reliably and to differentiate them from benign masses . 
Seno ’s imaging technology  addresses  this challenge by [CONTACT_389220], opto -acoustic (OA) and diagnostic ultrasound (US), thus 
providing co -registered and temporally fused functional and anatomical information . This 
combination has the potential to add  diagnostic information to help the  radiologist  evaluate 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389147] .  
 Judah Folkman, MD, discovered that rapi[INVESTIGATOR_389148] a dense microvascular network inside or around tumors required f or tumor 
growth and progression. Vascularization of the tumor occurs through a series of sequential steps before or during the multistep progression to neoplasia [4] . This vascularization or angiogenesis is 
a marker of breast cancer development and has cli nical implications in diagnosis and treatment. 
Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that the process of metastasis is also angiogenesis -
dependent [5] . In this regard, pharmaceutical companies are pursuing tumor angiogenesis as one 
potential target f or breast cancer chemotherapy agents [6].

 Many of these breast tumors will remain small for years before transitioning to a rapid growth stage when the rate of the cell growth is much  greater than the rate of apoptosis and requires new 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_389149]. These angiogenesis related micro -vessels have fragmented basement  
membranes and are leaky, making them more penetrable by [CONTACT_389221] . This new vascul ar phase of growth is usually followed by [CONTACT_389222], vessel 
leakage and metastasis [7] .  
 The ACR Practice Guideline for the Performance of Screening and Diagnostic Mammography, June 2008, states that “periodic mammography screening of age -appropr iate asymptomatic 
women is currently the only imaging modality that has been shown by [CONTACT_389223]” [8].   Mammographic sensitivity for breast cancer detection does decline significantly with increasing 
breast  density , yet mammography is still of value  in older women with dense breasts [9]. 
Mammography uses low -dose amplitude -X-rays (ionizing radiation at around 0.7 mSv) to 
examine the breast . A screening mammography is intended to detect unsuspected breast can cer in 
asymptomatic women based on mediolateral- oblique (MLO) and craniocaudal (CC) views of the 
breast . Based on the radiologists’ reading of the screening mammogram, he/she determines the 
need for further diagnostic evaluation [8].   
Accepted technologies for diagnostic evaluation include conventional diagnostic mammography, conventional diagnostic ultrasound, and MRI . Diagnostic mammography, which like screening 
mammography uses ionizing radiation, is used to evaluate subjects  who have signs and/or 
symptoms of breast disease, imaging findings of concern, or prior imaging findings requiring specific follow -up. In addition to the MLO and CC views, a diagnostic mammogra m includes 
views to evaluate a specific area of clinical concern, e.g. , spot compression, spot compression 
with magnification, and others [8].  
 Indications for  conventional diagnostic ultrasound include but are not limited to evaluation and 
characterization of palpable masses and other breast related signs and/or symptoms; evaluation of suspected or apparent abnormalities detected in other imaging studies ; initial imaging evaluation 
of palpable masses in women ≤  30 years of age ; and, in lactating and pregnant women. Unlike 
mammography, conventional diagnostic ultrasound does  not use ionizing radiation. ACR 
recommends the use of “a high -resolution, real -time linear array scanner operating at a center 
frequency of at least in the range of 10 MHz and preferably higher” . The breast sonogram is 
correlated to the clinical signs or symptoms and with mammographic and other appropriate imaging studies [ 9].

shown repeatedly that ancillary screening ultrasound can find [ADDRESS_487734] ultrasound 
expands, the number of potential biopsies of benign mass es will surely increase unless more 
accurate and app ropriate characterization of benign mass es is found thus obviating the need for 
biopsy.  
 MRI does not use ionizing radiation to produce computerized images of internal body tissues and is based on nuclear magnetic resonance of atoms within the body induced by [CONTACT_389224] a 
strong magnetic field and radiofrequency waves . MRI is typi[INVESTIGATOR_389150], i.e., greater than 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer, assessing the extent of a new 
breast cancer prior to definitive inte rvention assessing the effect of chemotherapy or a known 
malignancy and additional evaluation of clinical or imaging findings  as a problem solving 
technique . Ultrasound is often used to further charact erize abnormalities detected by [CONTACT_9268].  
 According to ACR, MRI equipment specifications and performance should take into account resolution, contrast and field strength, simultaneous bilateral imaging, use of contrast agents , 
scanning time , and use of a dedicated MRI breast coil [ 10].  
 Positron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that produces a metabolic image and is used in some instances for diagnostic evaluation but not as widely as other modalities . Breast -specific gamma imaging is another problem- solving tool in breast imaging that 
uses injection of a gamma- emitting radioisotope to detect breast cancers but is not in wide use .  
 Depending on the outcome of the diagnostic evaluation, the subject  may be referred for breast 
biopsy, to establish a histopathologic diagnosis . The breast imaging challenge, therefore, is to 
concurrently maximize the sensitivity and specificity to increase detection of breast cancer while decreasing the number of biopsies and while utilizing lower cost technologies and procedures.

1.2 Investigational Device – Mechanism of Action  
 
OA imaging is based on the capability of optical pulses to generate diagnostic ultrasound (acoustic pressure) [ 11-13]. Pulses of near -infrared light at two wavelengths are applied 
sequentially to breast tissue . Internal optical absorption leads to the preferential deposition of 
energy in tissue volumes with an enhanced absorption coefficient (i.e., malignant masses  and 
vasculature) . Red light (757nm) is absorbed predominantly by [CONTACT_389225]  (de-oxygenated)  blood, 
while near -infrared light (1064nm) is absorbed predominantly by [CONTACT_389226]. The 
amount of light (optical fluence) is below the Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE ) for single 
pulse exposure and maximum power for a pulse train of continuous pulses  according to the 
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standards for Safe Use of Lasers ( ANSI Z136.1) . 
The light excitation causes a mass  to emit a pressure (acoustic) wave, which is detected by [CONTACT_389227]- held bre ast probe [ 14]. OA imaging technology has the 
merit of both the high contrast resolution of optical imaging and the high  spatial  resolution  and 
penetration of ultrasound  imaging which has been established in numerous studies and published 
in peer reviewed  literature [ 15-21]. OA technology incorporates laser illumination and ultrasonic 
detection and is expected to achieve sensitivity and enhanced resolution in the breast tissue at  
depths more than sufficient to image any breast size . In prior studies Seno  has demonstrated the 
capability of OA imaging to visualize a 1 mm diameter target at the depth of 8 cm in a custom-
designed tissue phantom . The phantom used a 2% milk/distilled water mixture to obtain optical 
properties of µ a = 0.1/cm (optical absorption) , µs’= 9.8/cm (optical scattering), and g = 0.8 
(anisotropy) with a 1 mm Teflon tube containing heparinized blood.  
 
Proprietary algorithms perform co -registration of OA and diagnostic ultrasound images and 
provide much more detailed diagnostic information than the two technologies applied alone in a sequential manner; refer to Figure 1.

optical pulse at each wavelength of light generates an  OA image .

Simultaneously, a diagnostic ultrasound image is acquired and co-registered  with the OA image, 
providing a co- registered temporally interleaved  and fused functional and anatomical map of the  
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389151] . This information, based on blood concentration in the 
neovasculature  of the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389152], is unique to OA technology.  
 
The main chromophores in tissue that absorb illumination in the near -infrared range are 
oxygenated or deox ygenated molecules of hemoglobin in the blood. The contrast in OA imaging 
largely results from the paradigm of  uneven  vascular  distribut ion in herent to  cancer . Growing 
cancerous tumors develop an extensive network of blood vessels through the process of angiogenesis  where there is  increased blood flow to the cancerous tissue.  
 Seno ’s Imagio  will be tested as a n alternative to current commercially available ultrasound- only 
technology, which is used as the adjunctive technology for women found to have a suspi [INVESTIGATOR_389153] a screening mam mography . Unlike other functional imaging modalities, such as MRI,

Seno ’s technology does not require any contrast agent . Seno ’s imaging modality is expected to 
uniquely increase diagnostic confidence by [CONTACT_389228] a potential 
malignancy :  the presence of abnormal blood vessels (angiogenesis) and the r elative reduction in 
oxygen content of hemoglobin, in addition to the architecture and density of the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389154] .  
 
1.3 Previous Studies  
 
Early research proof of concept studies provided the company with supporting data to modify and 
enhance diagnostic performance of the  Imagio  by [CONTACT_389229] -acoustic 
imaging performed  at two wavelengths of Nd:YAG or Alexandrite lasers . Imagio  was also tested on gelatin 
phantoms simulating dense breast with blood vessels having blood with various degree s of oxygen  
saturation . Experiments demonstrated that OA imaging is capable of not only visualizing shape and 
dimensions of blood vessels, but also differentiating deoxygenated blood from oxygenated blood.  
 
Seno  has completed enrollment into its Exploratory Study , “Clinical evaluation of Opto -Acoustic 
Tomography for detection and diagnostic differentiation of breast tumors”, Cancer Therapy and Research 
Center ( CTRC ), at the University of [LOCATION_007] Science Center in San Antonio, TX, under the institution’s IRB 
approval for a non -significant risk study.  
 The Exploratory Study collect ed data to refine the electro -mechanical design, including software and user 
interface so that a robust and consistent algorithm could be trained on a stable system configuration . A 
total of [ADDRESS_487735] signal 
acquisition (i.e., optical, probe, analog, and analog/digital components) were finalized at the close of this study and locked down.  
 
Over [ADDRESS_487736] in making more accurate diagnoses  and 
the appropriate biopsy decision .  This study was conducted  at the Cancer Therapy and Research Center 
(CTRC) at The University of [LOCATION_007] Health Science Center in San Antonio, [LOCATION_007] and at South [LOCATION_007] 
Radiology Imaging Centers (STRIC) under the institutions IRB approvals for non -significant risk.  The 
Feasibility St udy provide d data to train the algorithm and to identify separate sets of features that 
characterize benign and malignant disease.  T he Feasibility Study include d subjects with negative 
diagnostic ultrasound ( NDU ) results and positive diagnostic ultrasound   (PDU ) results of varying 
histo pathology diagnoses , size s, location s, dept hs, ages, ethnicities, and race s. These subject -specific 
characteristics are intended to identify any unusual subpopulations ; to date, there are no such known 
exclusions other than subjects with obscured views and subjects on medications with the potential to 
activate dermatologic conditions.  The Feasibility Study provided the estimates used to compute the

before it can be distributed for commercial use .  If Imagio is approv ed for use , then potential benefits 
include sparing biopsies as well as improving the ability  to diagnose cancer s missed by  [CONTACT_389230].  There is also an unmet need in BI -RADs 4a subjects, where the 
risk of malignancy is low , but biopsy is mandatory, resulting in a large percentage of biopsies of benign 
mass es.  If Imagio can successfully  downgrade benign masses classified as BI -RADS 3, 4a, or 4b  to  BI -
RADS 2 or 3  by [CONTACT_122965] a priori risk  of malignancy 5 -fold (according to the POM), then subject s can 
be offered the option of short interval follow -up di agnostic ultrasound studies. Thus Imagio could  
improve efficiencies in diagnosis .  In addition, the reduced discomfort of the procedure  and minimal 
potential side effects  are further considerations.  For physicians, increased diagnostic certainty enhances 
subject  care . Last, t here may be  cost savings  for payers and for the healthcare system , resulting both 
from a reduction in the number of biopsies (i.e., those benign masses which  have a reduced POM 
following Imagio ), and from a greater diagnostic confidence when a biopsy is required  that leads to 
earlier intervention . A more efficient diagnostic pathway  may benefit all affected constituents in the 
screening and  diagnosis of breast cancer.    
 
The components used within the Imagio system have  a proven safety record .  Both lasers and 
conventional diagnostic ultrasound  have been used in diagnostic procedure  for decades  with acceptable 
risk profiles . Imagio , which uniquely combines opto -acoustic and diagnostic ultrasound  technology , will 
be tested to see if it will allow physicians to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_389156].  
 
2  STUDY OBJECTIVES   
 
The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Imagio for the visualization and classification  of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389157] .  The 
following outcomes  will be evaluated to determine whether I magio : 
 
1. Has superior specificity relative to I US (primary) with non -inferior sensitivity (secondary)  relative 
to IUS.  
2. Has clinically acceptable predictive value of a positive test (PPV) and of a negative test (NPV) for a 
range of possible  breast cancer prevalence . 
3. Downgrades benign masses classified as BI -RADS 3, 4a, or 4b according to IUS . 
4. Downgrades benign masses classified as BI -RADS 3, 4a or 4b according to the site investigator.  
5. Upgrades malignant masses classified as BI -RADS 3, 4a, or 4b relative to IUS.  
6. Achieves  a high degree of concordance with the biopsy outcome.  
7. Is safe .  
 Color or power Doppler data may be optionally collected during the conventional diagnostic ultrasound examination at the discretion of the site investigator for research purposes. Data from Imagio evaluation of lymph nodes will also be optionally collected for research purposes.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
 
This is a prospective, controlled, multi- center observational study that will compare the combined 
ultrasound and opto -acoustics results of Imagio with the ultrasound component of Imagio (“internal 
control”) .  Investigators will have the option to also collect color or power Doppler  information during the 
conventional ultrasound examination on a case -by-case basis .  The Doppler information will not be used 
in the analysis of this study for determining the safety and effectiveness of Imagio.    
 
The study will initially consent subjects who have al ready had a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389140] [ADDRESS_487738] 2,000 subjects will be prospectively  enrolled  upon confirmation of being BI -
RADS 3 , BI-RADS 4, or BI -RADS 5 to obtain  a sufficient number of benign  masses (at least 1,000 masses)  
and, if there is not a sufficient number , then the total number of subjects may increase slightly to achieve 
the target number for benign  masses.  All selected subjects will then undergo an I magio  evaluation  that 
must take place  before any scheduled  biopsy ; if a biopsy is to be performed, then the biopsy specimen 
may be evaluated by [CONTACT_389231] . Following Seno’s Medical Director review, in 
selected cases, histopathologic specimens from core and / or excisional biopsies will be sent to ce ntral 
pathology for review .  Subjects that may be selected for central pathology review would include:  
 
1. High risk lesions  
2.  Lesions  with histologic -imaging discordance   
3. Some with classically positive or classically negative OA studies  
4. Some of whom are suspected of having false positive or false negatives OA studies . 
5.  Other lesions as designated by [CONTACT_389232] ’s Medical Director  
 
All subjects not undergoing an immediate biopsy will be followed for an additional [ADDRESS_487739] practice 
without cons idering the Imagio evaluation outcome , but may include the CDU evaluation ; if a biopsy is to 
be performed, then the biopsy specimen may be evaluated by [CONTACT_389231] .

1 The decision to biopsy is made upon investigational site’s standard of care and not based on the  
Imagio  evaluation  
[ADDRESS_487740]  based upon investigational site’s 
standard of care  and not based on Imagio evaluation  
4 The optional 6 month follow -up visit is based upon Investigator’s standard practice of medic ine 
and not based on Imagio evaluation  
 
A multi -reader, multi- case ( MRMC ) methodology will be used  for the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389158] 7 independent 
radiologists passing prospective proficiency criteria will evaluate each of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389159] (Imagio and IUS image sets) and [ADDRESS_487741] 1,000  benign   masses and if there is not a sufficient number then 
the total number of masses  may increase slightly to achieve the minimum  number of 1,000 benign  
masses . The readers will also re read  5% of the registration cases and 2.5% of the reimbursement cases  to 
assess temporal trends intra -observer variability and consistency.  
 
Each registration reader will review the data from  two image sets (IUS and Imagio) for each case; each 
independent read er will evaluate  Imagio  according to a pre -determined diagnostic rule set based on OA 
image characteristics  and will similarly evaluate IUS according to another pre -determined diagnostic rule 
set where  each reader will estimate  the probability that the mass is  cancer on a scale from 0 % to 100%  in 
5% increment s (1% if <10% or >90%).  Readers will assess the image sets in the following  pre-defined 
order during independent review sessions; this pre -defined order is consistent with medical practice :  
Imagio diagnostic ultrasound alone  (IUS)  
Imagio (diagnostic ultrasound plus opto -acoustics).  
 
The final sample size of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389160] 800 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389161] (cases 101 -900 passing Quality Assurance review) have been evaluated with Imagio 
plus the results of any pre -scheduled biopsies ; the final sample size will depend on the  numbers of 
masses  biopsie d, the percent of biopsied  masses  with a cancer diagnosis, and the sensitivit ies and 
specificities for Imagio and IUS  among biopsied masses .  The interim analysis will be conducted once at 
least four of the seven registration readers complete the review of the 800 cases.  Results will be shared with partners for business planning purp oses but will not be shared with sites or published until the study 
is completed.   
 
3.2. Independent Reader Sele ction   
 The study will utilize quality assurance readers (QARs) and independent readers (IRs) chosen based upon their education, experience, and  training.   Each receive training appropriate to their roles.  QARs receive 
training how to check videos, image frames, and annotations.  IRs receive training how to use reading 
stations, how to evaluate image sets based on standardized materials and case  studies, how to complete 
and submit eCRFs, and how to receive real time feedback on their performance.  All training is either led 
or supervised by [CONTACT_389233].  The IR training process is conducted over a period of several months, and incl udes the following:  
    
 
 
Seno Clinical Study Protocol: PI[INVESTIGATOR_15597] -01 Confidential

1.       During off- site sessions, the IRs are trained in the protocol, GCP and 21 CFR Part 11, the Imagio  
device operation, the core imaging database, eCRF entry, and how to review Imagio images 
including the features.  
2.       During webinars, the IRs receive additional training how to evaluate Imagio videos and frames.  
3.       The IRs review image sets, enter their evaluations into a training database, and receive feedback 
in a group -setting.  
4.       The IRs receive additional train ing on the core imaging database (LifeRx and CLIB) and the 
process for eCRF completion . 
 A multi -stage process is implemented to establish reader proficiency and to select independent readers 
using Feasibility Study data, Validation and Verification Study data, and the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389162].  The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389135]) data are used to confirm the acceptability of the existing algorithm to be evaluated according to a pre -determined diagnostic rule set based on OA image 
characteristics (established in the  previously conducted Feasibility Study ). The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389163] [ADDRESS_487742] 70 of the 100 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389164]; the first 30 cases are  not be used in order to let individual readers 
get familiar with the image sets, the viewing logistics, and the eCRF to be c ompleted.  Readers are not 
given a second chance to establish proficiency unless the pool of proficient readers is depleted due to 
reader dropouts.  
 
Upon establishing and meeting prospective rules for proficiency (based on Imagio sensitivity [missing at 
most one cancer] and Imagio specificity > 30% after excluding the first 30 cases to allow for learning), a 
subset of 7 proficient readers are selected for registration  reads (IUS and Imagio) and [ADDRESS_487743]; reimbursement readers are  selected by [CONTACT_389234].

All registration readers will be tested and selected prior to making any further Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389165] 101  and beyond  which will constitute the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688] . All effectiveness analyses will be 
conducted at  the mass -level; it is projected that no more than 5% of all subjects will have multiple 
masses. A minimum of  [ADDRESS_487744] 1, 700 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389166].   The 100 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389138], training, and publication purposes; only the 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389167].  
 All selected registration readers will evaluate all masses th at pass QA review according to a MRMC design  
for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] .  To mimic the real world setting as closely as possible, all readers will receive 
respective feedback on the histopathology results after completing their locked evaluations; readers may 
not change results after receiving feedback .   
 
For the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389168], subsets of 5% of registration image sets and 2.5% of all reimbursement 
image sets will be reread to assess learning and consistency ; the first  reads will be used in the data 
analyses for registration and reimbursement .  Readers will be required to turn in their evaluations before 
conducting the rereads which will be  conducted once the respective reader completes their Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389169].  
 
3.3. Rationale for Study Design and C ontrol Group s 
 
Imagio will be assessed as a diagnostic test in the characterization of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389170]. The conventional  diagnostic ultrasound  will serve as the “external control”  while the diagnostic ultrasound  
component of Imagio will serve as an “internal control .”  The primary focus will be on the evaluation 
using the internal control.  
 
The ultimate diagnosis depends on the histopathology examination of the biopsy from the suspected 
mass by a n independent   Histopath ologist. The Histopathologist can elect to select slides for th e final 
diagnosis review.  This diagnosis will be included in the PMA submission.  After designating the diagnosis, 
the independent Histopatho logist may  assess histopathologic specimens  to better correlate specific 
internal and peritumoral findings (such as vessel density, neovessel count, cell density, type of host 
response to tumor, internal necrosis and hemorrhage, water content, etc.) with the opto -acoustic images 
and to help better understand the causes of opto -acoustic findings.   Results of th e  detailed 
histopathology  review  will be p ublished separately from the FDA submission but will be available to 
regulatory agencies upon request .  
 
Following Seno’s Medical Director review, in selected cases, histopathologic specimens from core and / or excisional biopsies will be sent to central pathology for review.  Subjects that may be selected for central 
pathology review would include:  
1. High ris k lesions  
2. Lesions with histologic -imaging discordance  
3. Some with classically positive or classically negative OA studies  
4. Some of whom are suspected of having false positive or false negatives OA studies.

5. Other lesions as designated by [CONTACT_389235]’s Medical Dire ctor 
 
 In the absence of new findings, th e decision to not recommend a biopsy during the first 12 months will be 
regarded as evidence of no disease , True Negative (TN) for those not biopsied; this is in accordance with 
FDA guidance regarding study analysis  conventions .  
 The study design will evaluate the specificity  as the 
primary effectiveness endpoint and the sensitivity as secondary effectiveness endpoint for comparing Imagio relative to the pre -biopsy conventional diagnostic ultrasound  images and histo logy results (if 
biopsy is performed). To ensure consistency, the assessment of all imaging studies including Imagio will be managed  by [CONTACT_389236] (ICC) to coordinate  the pool of 
potential readers for the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] /Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389171] [ADDRESS_487745] ; the Truth Panel will work closely with the Sponsor and /or designee to adjudicate all 
cases and to review anomalies relating to pathology, imaging, subject history, and clinical course  for the 
additional purpose of alerts regarding subjects at risk for malignancy , but not biopsied.    
The major anticipated advantages of co-registered OA and B- mode  imaging are as follows:  
 
1. High optical contrast between potentially malignant and benign tissues that  results from 
enhanced density of the microcirculation network within and around masse s and enhanced 
thermo -elastic expansion coefficient in potentially malignant masse s; 
2. High sensit ivity of detection due to efficient opto -thermal generation of pressure in masse s, and 
sensitive detection of resulting ultrasonic waves with novel pi[INVESTIGATOR_389172] s; and 
3. High ( ≤1 mm) spatial resolution that  results from pulsed laser excitation and time -resolved 
detection of ultrasonic signal profiles with array detectors;  
4. Substantial depth of monitoring (up to 8 cm in tissue phantoms) that  results from deep 
penetration of the near -infra- red photons in tissues, efficient conversion of laser energy into 
acoustic pressure waves propagating through the breast , with negligible  attenuation and minimal 
distortion, and from high sensitivity of pi[INVESTIGATOR_389173] ; and  
5. Applicability to breasts of a broad range of mammographic density, including those with 
radiographically dense breasts.
 
3.4.  Study Duration  
 Subjects are to be enrolled after decision to biopsy  or not to biopsy .   Each subject will undergo consent 
to have an Imagio evaluation , which must be completed within 10 business days of t he Enrollment Visit; 
the Imagio evaluation  must be performed prior to any biopsy.  Thus all selected subjects will undergo an 
Imagio  evaluation  following conventional diagnostic ultrasound and in some cases mammography before 
any immediate biopsy.  For subject managemen t efficiency, once the subject agrees to participate in the 
study and her biopsy is scheduled, she can then be scheduled for Imagio prior to the biopsy.  The subjects 
must have the Imagio evaluation within 45  business days before the biopsy . Core needle bi opsy, image 
guided directional vacuum assisted needle biopsy  (DVAB) , or surg ical biopsy will be performed.   For

subjects requiring a second biopsy, additional time (up to 45 business days) will be permitted to perform 
the second biopsy .  Any such decisions to biopsy will be made solely by [CONTACT_389237]. 
  
 
All subjects not undergoing an immediate biopsy will be followed clinically for an addit ional [ADDRESS_487746] Imaging Visit   and a subsequent Imagio  evaluation  
before any subsequent biopsy that might be necessary because of an interval clinical finding during the 
12 month follow -up or because of a 6 month follow -up conventional diagnostic ultrasound that has been 
recommended by [CONTACT_093] . If the interval clinical problem does not result in a recommendation 
for biopsy,  the investigator may schedule a 6 or 12 month follow -up visit at their discretion. Follow -up 
will end when  either:  
1. The subject undergoes a biopsy by  [ADDRESS_487747] will attend up to 4  visits:  
• A Screening Visit . 
• An Enrollment Visit (Day 1) .  
• 1 or 2 Imaging Visits (Day 1 to Day 10; a second Imaging Visit will occur for any biopsy within [ADDRESS_487748] Imaging Visit) . 
• A Follow -Up Visit at 12 months ( if no biopsy is scheduled within 12 months of the Enrollment 
Visit) . 
The Screening Visit, Enrollment Visit, and 1st Imaging Visit may all occur in proper sequential order in one 
day.  
 
3.5.  Ultrasound Visualization and Annotation 
 
The conventional diagnostic ultrasound part of the study will include at least  orthogonal viiew  Radial and 
Anti-Radial views of the mass  or longitudinal and transverse views ). In some cases, additional views may 
be necessary (when the maximum d iameter is not in Radial and Anti- radial planes, for example). The scan 
protocols will be those recommended in the “ACR [ADDRESS_487749] Ultrasound Examination ”, except that the subject  name, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389174], and birth date

4.  Transducer orientation   
 
A mass  at 10:[ADDRESS_487750] would be at R 10:[ADDRESS_487751] views used for diagnostic ultrasound will  be established  during the Imagio scan.  At a minimum, two orthogonal views 
(longitudinal/tran sverse or radial/anti- radial) will include both freeze frame images with and without 
calipers, and slow video “sweeps” through the lesion in both planes.   
 
Color or power Doppler images may be collected during the conventional ultrasound examination for 
research purposes , but must be obtained in the same views used for diagnostic  ultrasound and for the 
Imagio scan  and must be annotated identically to the diagnostic gray scale and Imagio  image s.  
 
The acoustic gel used will either be provided by [CONTACT_389238] d for use  by [CONTACT_389235]. The gels will be non -
colored, as colored gel is anticipated to interfere with the optical part of the opto -acoustic examination . 
 
All images used for this  study will be anonymized  to be HIP AA compliant  prior to review by [CONTACT_389239] .  Subjects in this study will be assigned 
identifying subject numbers and their names and medical facility record numbers will be hidden on all accumulated images. The images will identify the subject only by [CONTACT_211494]. The database that links the subj ect number with the subject names, medical facility record numbers, and birth dates will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_389240] -investigator and access to this database will be limited to the 
investigators  and the Seno Medical Instruments, Inc.  site monito r. 
 Informed consent will be obtained before Imagio imaging can be performed. The c onsent form te mplate

5. DESCRIPTION OF EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
5.1. Description of Investigational Device  
 
Imagio  utilizes acoustic pressure waves generated by [CONTACT_389243] , including those containing concentrations of oxygenated and 
deoxygenated hemoglobin . It also uses diagnostic ultrasound  transmitted and received signals to form 
diagnostic ultrasound  images of the internal soft tissue . The investigational device consists of these sub -
systems  and components : 
 5.1.1  Opto -acoustic Probe: A handheld OA linear probe  contain s a wideband diagnostic ultrasound 
array that can  be used as a  traditional diagnostic ultrasound transducer over a range of frequencies from  
4 MHz to 16 MHz at 20 dB power point  and can also r eceive optic ally generated acoustic frequencies that 
    
 
 
Seno Clinical Study Protocol: PI[INVESTIGATOR_15597] -01 Confidential  
300176 Rev  8  PI[INVESTIGATOR_15597] 01 Protocol Amendment 3.2   
Eff. Date: October 15, 2015 
 Page 30 of 80 
  
range from 0.1 MHz to 18 MHz at 20 db power point. With the integrated  laser light delivery system , the 
hand -held prob e can  operate in a multiplexing mode so that the same probe can be used to create co -
registered, temporally interleaved and fused functional OA and anatomic diagnostic ultrasound . The OA 
duplex probe footprint is no greater than 56 mm long by 36 mm wide , with the ultrasound transducer size 
being 38 mm long by 4 mm wide.  
 
5.1.2  Laser : A Class IIIB laser subsystem generates the necessary output energy, pulse widths and 
wavelengths to provide the breast illumination to initiate the OA effect . The laser component is based on 
laser technology found in previously 510(k) cleared dermatological devices; the lasers are supplied by a FDA registered OEM manufacturer. The lasers are activated via a footswitch . 
 
5.1.3  Electronics : The system electronics provide the necessary signal processing, control, digital 
processing and image reconstruction to convert OA and diagnostic ultrasound  signals into the desired 
clinical displays and operations, and to combine those with similarly generated diagnostic ultras ound  
images.  
 5.1.4  Diagnostic Ultrasound : The diagnostic ultrasound subsystem is provided by [CONTACT_389244]. The system is capable of processing and displaying conventional  diagnostic 
ultrasound  images  as well as co-registered OA and B -mode images .  
 5.1.5  Software : The software controls the overall data flow from the data acquisition process to the 
display of the final co-registered  OA and diagnostic ultrasound images.  The system continuously acquires 
both OA data from the dual lasers and diagnostic ultrasound  images from the diagnostic ultrasound 
subsystem. Ancillary data such as the physician annotations are stored and saved in DICOM format.  
 
5.2. Potential  Risks  
 
Risks associated with the intended use of I magio  include potential laser exposure, acoustic output 
exposure, and contamination due to insufficient cleaning/disinfection of subject/user contact[CONTACT_389245] .   Section 5.[ADDRESS_487756] or 
operator:   
 
5.2.1  Applicable Energy Hazards : Electrical, heat, mechanical force/moving parts, non -ionizing 
radiation, and electromagnetic fields; comparable to other electro -mechanical software controlled 
devices, with the following exception : 
 
When I magio  is prepared for imaging, the laser shutter can be opened and the laser will deliver near 
infrared pulses to the subjec ts’ breast through a light delivery system. All  subjects  and study personnel in 
or near the experimental area will wear eyewear  specially designed for protection against laser 
illumination in the near infrared spectral range. However, no leakage of laser light is anticipated  from 
either laser system or light delivery system . Laser illumination at safe levels will be used for the proposed 
in vivo studies, according to FDA Performance Standards for Light -Emitting Products, 21 CFR Part 1040, 
1998.

ANSI Z136.1 -1993, “American National Standard for the Safe Use of Lasers,” published by [CONTACT_389246], Inc, defines the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) for laser irradiation of skin as equal to 20 to 100 mJ/cm
2 depending on the wavelength in the spectral range from 700 nm to 
1100 nm (Nd:YAG laser or Alexandrite laser) and low repetition rate of nanosecond laser pulses [ 22]). The 
repetition rate of laser pulses must be limited to assure that the laser -induced pressure and heat 
dissipates from the irradiated volume during the time between two consecutive laser pulses.  The OA 
functionality has been tested to be below the Maximum  Perm issible Exposure (MPE ) for single pulse 
exposure and maximum power for a pulse train of continuous pulses .   
 In addition to testing the MPE for laser radiance, Seno  has separately tested the acoustic output of the 
diagnostic ultrasound subsystem according to FDA’s “Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Information for 
Manufacturers Seeking Marketing Clearance of Diagnostic Ultrasound Systems and Transducers,” 
September 9, 2008.  
 Seno  also assessed the cumulative non -ionizing radiation exposure from  the laser and ultrasound  
subsystems as well as transient temperature effects (individual and combined thermal effect), on blood, blood vessels, and adjacent tissues in the laser/ultrasound propagation pathway .    
 Conclusion: On the basis of this informat ion, FDA notified Seno  on October 28, [ADDRESS_487757] imaging system is non -significant risk for this study.  
 
5.2.2 .  Applicable Biological Hazards : Bio-burden, bio -contamination, toxicity, cross -infection, inability to 
maintain hygienic safety, and degradation  are comparable to other electro -mechanical software 
controlled devices . Subject/user contact[CONTACT_389247] . Seno  has contracted with  NAMSA, No rthwood, OH, to 
conduct the required biocompatibility testing to ISO [ZIP_CODE] : Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices Part 
1: Evaluation and Testing. This testing is currently on -going.   
 
Cleaning and disinfection of the OA probe with  Sani-Cloth ® AF3 Germicidal Disposable Wipes  is described 
in the Study Instructions for Use Manual. Cleaning and disinfection of the OA probe is  required prior to 
the first subject of the day and after each subject.  
 5.2.3.  Environmental Hazards : Electromagnetic, inadequate supply of power, restriction of cooling, 
likelihood of operation outside of prescribed environmental conditions, storage outside of prescribed 
environmental conditions, incompatibility with other devices, accidental mechanical damage, 
contaminat ion due to waste products and/or device disposal  are comparable to other electro -mechanical 
software controlled devices.  
 
5.2.4.  Hazards related to the Use of the Device : reasonably foreseeable misuse of the device, system 
noise, and use of the device by [CONTACT_389248], incorrect measurement and other metrological 
aspects, incorrect diagnosis, incompatibility with consumables/accessories/other devices, hazards from 
contraindicated pharmaceuticals, and hazards from contraindicated subject classes;  comparable to other 
electro -mechanical software controlled devices.

5.2.5.  Hazards arising from Functional Failure, Maintenance, and Aging : inadequacy of performance 
charact eristics for intended use, lack of or inadequate specification for maintenance, including 
inadequate specification of post -maintenance functional checks, inadequate maintenance, lack of 
adequate determination of end of device life, loss of electrical /mech anical integrity, inadequate 
packaging (contamination/deterioration of the device), improper reuse, delayed cumulative effects from 
long- term use; comparable to other electro -mechanical software controlled devices.  
 
5.2.6  General Hazards : hazards introduce d by [CONTACT_389249], hazards from design 
changes, and hazards from system assembly; comparable to other electro -mechanical software 
controlled devices.  
 
5.2.7  Testing and Mitigation of Hazards : Seno Medical  Instruments, Inc.  has conducted appropriate 
design verification and design validation testing  to ensure that device related risks are controlled and that 
the residual risk is at acceptable levels for this type of investigational device . Seno  has performed testing 
according  to the FDA recognized standards listed in the table below.   In those cases where risk could not 
be mitigated via design, labeling and training serves to notify the investigator of potential hazards  or 
hazardous situations in the instructions for use and/o r in the exclusion criteria for this protocol, e.g.,

5.6. Evaluation of Risk / Benefit  
 
There is a minimal risk ( 0.4% or 1:269 ) that a subject  may experience discomfort, including tingling or 
warmth, during the Imagio scan.  The discomfort , if experienced, is not associated with any visible skin 
changes and resolves immediately at the completion of the scan  without treatment.  To date there have 
been no reports of unanticipated adverse device ef fects for this investigation .  Previous studies using 
comparable prototype systems have been declared  to be non -significant risk .  
  
Conclusion: FDA notified Seno  on October 28, 2011, that the agency believes that the I magio  breast 
imaging system is  non-significant risk  for this study . 
 
Based on the recommendation of the QA evaluators, the independent readers, and the Truth Panel for missed masses not biopsied , the Medical Monitor will be immediately notified and will in turn notify the 
site investigator.  
 
5.7. Central Histopathology Review  
 Following Seno’s Medical Director review, in selected cases histopathologic specimens from core and / or 
excisional biopsies will be sent to central pathology for review.  Subjects that may be selected for central 
pathology review would include:  
1. High risk lesions  
2. Lesions  with histologic -imaging  discordance  
3. Some with classically true positive or classically true negative OA studies  
4. Some of whom are suspected of having false positive or false negatives OA studies . 
5.   Other lesions as designated by [CONTACT_389235]’s M edical Director  
 
This may include the initial biopsy, any  second biopsy, and any subsequent biopsy  or surgical excision  
during the first 12 months after study enrollment.   The central h istopathology review will be used for all 
analyses.    All histopathology specimens will be labeled using the Study ID and the d ate that the 
specimen was collected.  
 
All specimens should be formalin -fixed and paraffin -embedded. Sections should be cut at a thickness no 
greater than 4 microns, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, and cover- slipped in the routine manner.

5.8. Standard Diagnostic Measure (SDM) as Comparator   
 
The diagnostic ultrasound of Imagio will serve as the “internal control”. The conventional diagnostic 
control will service as the “external control”; the CDU  must be completed within [ADDRESS_487764] to review by [CONTACT_389256] . Subjects requiring a second biopsy will be allowed additional time (up to  45 business  days ) to 
undergo a second biopsy .     
 The presented study design will evaluate all images that contribute to the decision to either perform a 
biopsy or to follow the subject for up to 12 months ; this includes  mammography will be read alone and in 
combination with conventional diagnostic ultrasound and Imagio w hich w ill be separately read by [CONTACT_389257].  The registration readers will focus on  the IUS and Imagio image sets to  be read 
in the following  pre-defined order :  
 
1.  Imagio diagnostic ultrasound  alone  (IUS)  
2.  Imagio (diagnostic ultrasound  plus opto -acoustics  [OA] ). 
 
Specific image  sets may include screening and diagnostic mammograph y as well as other diagnostic 
images  but excluding the optional color or power Doppler .  The images will be received, assigned, sent, 
recorded, and received back by [CONTACT_389258].  The ICC will manage the image set 
review process by [CONTACT_389259] .  To preserve their independence and objectivity as well as to 
minimize bias, the independent readers  will NOT have access to any clinical data, any  decision s to biopsy , 
or to any  biopsy outcomes .  
 
The Medical  Monitor will be contact[CONTACT_389260]: PI[INVESTIGATOR_15597] -01 Confidential

to perform  the diagnostic ultrasound  in addition to the I magio  image s in order to perform evaluations  for 
the above -stated image series  used to evaluate the subjects for the BI -RADs 4a or 4b  classification and if a 
decision is made to biopsy .  Seno will have access to reader results once the biopsy is completed and the 
image sets are read by [CONTACT_389261].  
  
 
5.9. Comparator Device Components  
 
Imagio  is an investigational device that has not been approved for commercial use by [CONTACT_55257] . 
However, FDA has notified Seno on October 28, 2011, that the agency believes that I magio  is non -
significant risk for this study.  Imagio includes  subsystems and comp onents that are comparable to 
commercially available medical devices : 
 
5.9.1. Proprietary Device N ame : PR3 Ultrasound System  
Classification : Ultrasonic imaging system  
Regulation Number: Title 21 CFR 892.1560 
Medical Specialty : Radiology  
Medical Device Regulatory Class : II (Special Controls ) 
510(K): K080935  
 
Imagio  is similar to the PR3 Ultrasound system in that both systems use ultrasound waves propagating 
through tissue to obtain images of  soft tissue . The diagnostic  ultrasound  component of Imagio  uses the 
standard parameters of the PR3 Ultrasound system . However, the opto -acoustic part of I magio  employs 
passive detection of low -amplitude ultrasound waves instead of ultrasou nd-emissions  used by [CONTACT_237812]3 -
USI. 
 
5.9.2. Proprietary Device N ame : Candela Gentle LASE  Laser  
Classification : Dermatological Vascular Lesion Laser  
Regulation Number: Title 21 CFR 878.4810 
Medical Specialty : Dermatology  
Medical Device Regulatory Class : II (Special Controls )  
510(K): K083207

5.12. Method of Assigning Subjec ts to Treatment Groups  
 
This is a prospective, controlled, multi- center observational study where all subjects undergo  a diagnostic 
ultrasound, to make a biopsy decision , and then are consented .   All subjects will then  undergo the I magio  
evaluation following  conventional diagnostic  procedures . Thus, there is no randomization . 
 5.13. Blinding  
 
Subjects will not be blinded to study procedures but will not have access to the I magio  evaluation result.  
 
The investigator will have access to all conventional diagnostic ultrasound , mammography , and  biopsy 
report s, but the interpretation of the I magio  evaluation will not be provided to the investigator.   The 
investigator will also have the option to perform  the color or power Doppler  during the conventional 
ultrasound examination for research purposes.   The Doppler information will not be used in the analysis 
of this study for determining the safety and effectiveness of the Imagio .   
    
The [ADDRESS_487766] imp ortant image sets for comparisons ; these will be the image sets to be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_389262] .  Mammography is regarded as the most likely referral methodology 
and will be read alone and in combin ation with CDU and Imagio by [CONTACT_389263].  Readers 
will not have access to the background clinical information or to the histopathology report . The Truth 
Panel will have access to all clinical data, QA evaluator,  and independent reader result s to be able to alert 
the study medical monitor regarding any high risk subjects; the Seno  study coordinator  will in turn alert 
the study investigator in the event that the subject was not biopsied  or the biopsy report was missing .

Biopsied  Group Criteria:  
Has at least one or up to  three suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389182] (as either the cause of the clinical or mammographic finding) that the investigator has 
characterized as either BI -RADS [ADDRESS_487772] a biopsy for each suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389183] . 
 
Unbiopsied Group Criteria: 
 
Has at least one solid mass, complex cystic and solid mass , or indeterminate cystic versus solid lesion 
(as either the cause of clinical or mammographic finding), that the investigator has characterized as 
BI-RADS 3 or has ≤2% POM, and for which the subject has chosen to have either biopsy or short 
interval follo w-up. If greater than one mass is found and each mass is not recommended for biopsy, 
then only one mass of the site’s choice will be designated as the primary mass and will be followed for up to 12 months; Ideally, the mass with the highest POM as per the investigator will be selected 
for follow -up.  
 
6.2.3. Imaging Visit (s), Day [ADDRESS_487773] will undergo  the Imagio  study  evaluation . The Imagio  evaluation  will be 
performed according to the I magio  Instructions for U se provided for this clinical study .    Subjects may be 
asked to return to the clinic to repeat the Imagio scan if (a) the image quality is not acceptable for review 
by [CONTACT_389268] (b) they have not under gone a biopsy procedure.  Seno Medical 
Instruments, Inc. or their designees may be present during the procedures to provide technical support.   
 The study data will be recorded using electronic data captur e (EDC) . Any adverse event s that occur during 
this Visit will be entered into the eCRF .  
 The investigator is to ensure that the site histopathology report is obtained and the relevant results are 
entered into  the eCRF .  The central histopathology report will contain cell type, histologic grade for 
invasive malignant mass es and nuclear grade for in situ carcinomas. Additionally, the Sponsor will assign a 
blinded sonographer to independently determine the  maximum diameter of the index mass  and extent of 
disease (which includes n ot only the maximum diameter of the index mass , but outside -to-outside 
dimensions between multifocal and/or multicentric invasive disease and/or maximum outside -to-outside 
largest dimension of combined invasive and in situ disease ); the sonographer may be a Sponsor employee 
without access to diagnosis, histopathology results, reader scores, and nom ogram results .  Also included 
will be estrogen, progesterone, and Her -[ADDRESS_487774] mass  within 12  months of enrollment,  a subsequent

6.5.1  Defining, Recording and Reporting Events  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event (AE )  
 
An AE is defined as any untoward  medical occurrence in a subject . This means any clinically 
adverse sign, symptom, syndrome or illness that occurs or worsens during the course of the 
study, regardless of causality, that is not otherwise being measured in the study.  
 
Each AE will be evaluated for its  seriousness, severit y and association with the Imagio study.   
Adverse events will be followed until resolution or for the duration of the study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Event (SAE )  
 The se verity of AEs will be assessed according to the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) [ZIP_CODE] -1 SAE definition.  A device -related SAE will be defined as an SAE in 
which the Imagio  device relationship cannot be ruled out.  
 
An AE that meets any of the following criteria will be considered an SAE for protocol purposes : 
 
1. Led to death  
2. Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that:  
 
• Resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury;  
• Resulted in permanent impairment of a body s tructure or a body function;  
• Required in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]; or,  
• Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function.  
 
• Resulted in persisten t or significant disability or incapacity; or  
• Important AEs that are not immediately life -threatening or do not result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based on the training physician’s  medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed 
above.  
 
Neither a biopsy nor a diagnosis of breast cancer is considered to be an adverse event.    
 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  (UADE )

As defined by [CONTACT_389270] 21 CFR 812.3(s):  
Unanticipated adverse device effect  means any serious  adverse effect on health or safety or any 
life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, 
or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application  (including a supplementary plan or application),  or any other 
unanticipated serious  problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or 
welfare of subjects.  
 
An observer in this study must report any  suspected  UADE to the Seno Medical Director within 24 
hours of learning of the occurrence. Seno will then report any concerned  UADE s, as required by 
[CONTACT_1260] .  
 
6.5.2  Evaluation of Severity  
 
The severity of AEs will be assessed according to the following definitions:  
 
Mild: The AE is noticeable to the subject but does not interfere with routine activity . The AE does not 
require any action in connection with the study treatment.  
 Moderate: The AE interferes with routine activity , but responds to symptomatic therapy or rest . The AE 
may require action concerning the study treatment.  
 
Severe:  The AE significantly limits the subject's ability to perform routine activities despi[INVESTIGATOR_389184]. The AE may require action concerning the study treatment . 
 
Life-Threatening: The AE is of a nature that  the subject is at immediate risk of death, even if not related 
to the study treatment. The AE may require action concerning the study treatment.  
 6.5.3  Evaluat ion of AE Relationship to Investigational Device  
 
The relationship between an AE and the study device  (investigational device ) will be determined by [CONTACT_389271] :

6.7 Appropriateness of Measurements  
 
Imagio  was developed to complement and to add additional knowledge to  existing imaging modalities . 
The selected endpoints (sensitivity, specificity , concordance (percent TP and TN), positive likelihood ratio 
(Se/ (1-Sp)), negative likelihood ratio (Sp / (1-Se)), NPV and PPV), and odds ratio give an adequate 
characterization of the I magio  System  in the indication s for use by : 
 
• Decreasing  the number (percent) of women  potentially  undergoing biopsy by [CONTACT_389272] a malignant mass while not increasing the number (percent) of false -negative  to 
a clinically unacceptable level (see N on-Inferiority margin discussion).  
• Showing that Imagio has a sufficiently high  specificity  relative to  the Imagio ultrasound  
component .  
• Showing that Imagio features differentiate between benign and cancer cases.  
• Down classifying BI -RADS 3, 4a, and 4b subjects according to the site investigator.  
• Down classifying BI -RADS 3, 4a, and 4b subjects according to IUS . 
• Up classifying BI -RADS 3, 4a, and 4b subjects according to IUS  
 
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
 
Seno or its designated representatives performs at least monthly quality assurance checks on all 
investigational devices at participating sites . Phantoms and testing protocols will be supplied . The

300176 Rev  8  PI[INVESTIGATOR_15597] 01 Protocol Amendment 3.2   
Eff. Date: October 15, [ADDRESS_487782]; the Truth Panel 
will work closely with the Sponsor and /or designee to adjudicate all cases and to review anomalies 
relating to pathology, imaging, subject history, and clinical course for th e additional purpose of alerts 
regarding subjects at risk for malignancy, but not biopsied.  
 
• Quality Control and Assurance are conducted by [CONTACT_389273].  A QA evaluator who is a QA 
radiologist (QAR) (separate from the independent reviewers) will perform an image/lesion pairing 
assessment once the ICC  performs the QA of all demographic  data, checks  image completeness and 
quality , and resolves all discrepancies.  The ICC  must perform this QA befor e the independent review 
can take place. The QARs will also check if lesions scanned with Imagio at the site match the same 
lesion(s) seen on all imaging modalities at the site.  The QA Radiologists review and select the 
relevant images and videos to allow  unbiased and least burdensome IR review and ensure the 
imaging data can be read consistently, without ambiguity.  In addition, criteria are in place to identify 
unbiopsied cases with a risk of malignancy according to the independent registration readers.    
 
For the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389168], subsets of 5% of registration image sets and 2.5% of all reimbursement image sets will be reread to assess learning and consistency.  
 
 In addition, Seno  or its designated representatives will monitor all clinical studie s that it sponsors . Before 
the enrollment of subject s in this study, the sponsor or sponsor’s authorized representative and the 
investigator will review the protocol, the eCRF and instructions for completing them, the procedure for 
obtaining informed consent and the procedure for reporting AEs/ UADEs/ SAEs . Site monitoring visits will 
be performed by [CONTACT_4209]’s authorized representatives on a regular basis . During these 
visits, information recorded in the eCRFs will be verified against source documents . The eCRF will be 
reviewed for device perform ance and compliance issues, safety information, legibility, completeness, 
accuracy and logical consistency . The data will reside in an electronic database . Additional computer 
programs that identify selected protocol violations, out -of-range data and other  data errors may be used 
to help monitor the study . As necessary, requests for clarification or correction will be sent to the 
investigator. 
 
 
Independent auditors from the sponsor or sponsor’s authorized representative will be allowed by [CONTACT_389274] . In addition, audits may be conducted by [CONTACT_277954].  
 
Data entered in the eCRF will be source verified for accuracy and completeness . In addition, protocol 
compliance and compliance with FDA and E U regulations, including GCP, ICH , and ISO  requirements , will 
be verified.

8.1.1  Statistical Strategy  
 
This is a MRMC design involving two image sets (Imagio and its’ ultrasound component) for registration 
(according to 7 independent readers) and multiple combinations of image sets for reimbursement 
(according to 3 other independent readers) .  The registration readers will review all cases while the 
reimbursement readers will read multiple  combinations of image sets .  The PMA filing will be based on 
the registration results with the reimbursement results to be submitted  at a later date.    
 A total of at least  1700 women at 16  US sites are planned to undergo an I magio  evaluation  following 
prospective enrollment , provided there are a sufficient number of benign  masses (at least 1,000 masses)  
and, if there is not a sufficient number , then the total number of  subjects will increase to achieve at least 
1,000  benign  masses. Subjects  with a n undiagnosed  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389140] 45 business 
days, by [CONTACT_389213] a screening or diagnostic methodology other than ultrasound , and scheduled to 
undergo a conventional diagnostic ultrasound will be prospectively screened . Subjects with only a BI-
RADS 1  or BI -RADS 2 classification will be regarded as screen failures.  This strategy reduces referral bias 
and accounts for a consecutive  series  of BI -RADS 3  and BI RADS 4  cases  not discovered according to CDU.  
Once a decision has been made to biopsy (yes or no), the subject  will then undergo an Imagio  evaluation  
of all masses to be biopsied (up to a total of three per subject from both breasts) .  The I magio  results will 
not be used to decide whether or where to biopsy or to reverse the decision to biopsy; also no study -
related follow -up is planned after the biops y. 
 
 The analyses will be performed at the mass level since some subjects will have more than one mass biopsied.   It is expected that no more than 5% of all subjects will have multiple masses so no repeated 
measures analyses are planned , that is, all lesions will be treate d as independent observations . 
 Subjects will be drawn from the following four  subpopulations selected by [CONTACT_389275] : 
 
• Callbacks for additional evaluation of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_134425]( s) identified by [CONTACT_389276].  
• Diagnostic referral to assess focal physical symptoms and / or signs that were either a chief 
complaint of the subject or were elicited by [CONTACT_389242]  (excluding focal breast 
pain in the absence of other positive clinical findings) . 
• Interval Clinical Problems (symptoms or physical findings excluding isolated focal breast pain, that 
have  developed between  yearly mammograms) . 
• Other referrals to diagnostic conventional ultrasound  including subjects  younger than 30 years 
old for a clinically suspi[INVESTIGATOR_134425], or subjects  referred from a screening MRI because of an

abnormality . 
 
These subpopulations will be analyzed in aggregate as well as individually.   
 The Imagio diagnostic ultrasound  component will serve as the “internal control” .   
 The specificity determined by a 2% POM is the primary effectiveness endpoint while the sensitivity is  the 
secondary effectiveness endpoint.    
 Multiple effectiveness endpoints will be assessed (one primary  and four secondary) so the overall 5% 
Type I error will be controlled by [CONTACT_389277] -sided p=0.[ADDRESS_487783] while sensitivity will then be tested according 
to non -inferiority tests .  Testing will be based  on the specificity  (primary endpoint)  and sensitivity  
(secondary endpoint) , both based on a 2% Probability of Malignancy (POM) .  The overall specificity 
exceeding 40% will also be tested.  In addition, downgrading benign masses and upgrading malignant 
masses  using Imagio relative to the site and  relative to IUS will be evaluated.  
 The superiority test and the non -inferiority  tests will each  have at least 80% power to  test their re spective 
hypothes es according to a two-sided test with overall 1% Type I error.  The histo patho logy findings of the 
biopsy procedure will serve as a gold standard for I magio .  The decision to not recommend a biopsy 
during the first 12 months together with a negative 12 month clinical and imaging follow -up and no 
evidence of a >20% increase in the mass will be regarded as evidence of  no disease (True -Negative for a 
negative OA/FN for a positive screening OA ) for those initially not recommended  for biops y.  
 
A total of 7  independent radiologists will be assigned per each case to independently evaluate both image 
sets (IUS and Imagio) per subject .  In addition, 3 other independent readers will perform the 
reimbursement reads .  All independent r eaders will evaluate all Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389185] ; the readers  will also 
review 5% of all cases to assess temporal trends and consistency ; the initial evaluation will be used in all 
analyses .  
 
Each registration reader will review the data from the two image sets  (IUS, Imagio ) for each case; each 
reader will evaluate Imagio according to a pre -determined diagnostic rule set based on OA image 
characteristics  and will similarly evaluate IUS according to another pre -determined diagnostic rule set and 
each  reader will estimate the probability that the mass is  cancer on a scale from 0% to 100% in 5% 
increments (1% if ≤ 10% or > 90% ).   Readers will assess IUS  and Imagio  in this pre -defined order during 
independent review sessions ; this pre -defined order is  consistent with medical practice.  
 
Registration readers will also have access to the results of two locked nomograms to separately predict 
the POM and the probability of cancer.  These nomograms were constructed from the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389186] a linear m odel for the POM and a logistic regression model for the probability of cancer.  The 
nomograms are constructed from the five  feature scores for Imagio from a blinded review performed by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Stavros.  The registration readers do not need to use the results of the nomograms in making their POM judgments, but they will immediately see the two predictions as soon as they score the five

features.  The sensitivity and specificity of the nomograms will also be evaluated using the average 
predicted score; if the av erage is ≤0.1, then the case is predicted to be benign.    
 The final sample size of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389160] 80 0 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389161] (cases 101 -900 passing Quality Assurance review) have been evaluated with Imagio 
plus the results of any pre -scheduled biopsies ; the final sample size will depend on the  numbers of 
masses biopsied, the percent of biopsied masses with a cancer diagnosis, and the sensitivities and 
specificities for Imagio and IUS among biopsied masses .  The interim analysis will be conducted once at 
least four of the seven registration readers complete the review of the 800 cases.  Results will be shared 
with partners for business planning purposes based on all 7 registrati on readers but will not be shared 
with sites or published until the study is completed.  The final sample size will not exceed 2,400 masses .  
 The study design will require all images to be managed  by [CONTACT_389278]  (FDA Clinical Performance Evaluation : Considerations for Computer- Assisted Detection Devices 
Applied to Radiology Images and Radiology Device Data –  Pre-market Approval [PMA] and Pre -market 
Notification [510k] Submissions, October 21, 2009 ).  The ICC will assign multiple readers per team to  
review all images leading to the decision to either perform a biopsy or to follow the subject for up to [ADDRESS_487784] in practice, the image sets will be read in the following order:  
 
1. Imagio diagnostic ultrasound  alone  
2. Imagio ( diagnostic ultrasound  plus opto -acoustics).  
 
To preserve their independence and objectivity as well as to minimize bias, the independent readers  must 
lock their IUS evaluations before being allowed to begin their Imagio evaluations; in addition , readers will 
NOT have access to any clinical data but will have access to  biopsy outcomes  once  they record and lock 
their evaluations.  Then reader s will have controlled access to biopsy outcomes in units of 25 cases to 
simulate the real world setting where practicing radiologists receive outcomes . 
 
Variable referral patterns across sites are expected.  The referral pattern also varies depending on study 
site (academic vs. private practice) , age, risk factors  (family history of breast cancer, obesity ), and breast  
BI-RADS density . Note that pre- screening and referral patterns influence diagnostic performance, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_389187] a breast cancer detection rate (BCDR) ranging between 18% and 40%.  Endpoints of family 
history of breast cancer and obesity were not collected in this study.  
 
The histologic findings of the biopsy procedure will serve as a gold standard for Imagio and the decision to not recommend a biopsy during the first 12 months will be regarded as evidence no  of disease (True -
Negative) for those not recommended for biopsy.  Images will be assessed according to if the biopsy was 
performed immediately, delayed, or irrespective of timing  through the 12 month follow -up interval.   
 
High risk histologies will be analyzed separately from benign and malignant histologies in all dat a 
analyses.   This reflects current practices where high risk masses are considered to be benign histologies 
but are always removed.

In general, s uperiority will be assessed using a two-sided 9 9% lower bound > 0 while  non-inferiority  will be 
assessed using  a one -sided 9 9.5% lower bound greater than or equal to the non -inferiority margin .  
 
8.2 Study Hypotheses  
 
The above considerations motivate multiple hypotheses . As pre -specified below, Hypothesis 1 tests 
Imagio specificity superiority versus IUS (H1) while Hypothesis 2 tests Imagio sensitivity non -inferiority 
versus IUS (H2).  Hypothes es [ADDRESS_487785] 40 % (H3) and the 
stand alone sen sitivi ty is at least 9 0% (H 4).  Hypothesis 5 tests the hypotheses for using Imagio to 
downgrade benign masses to BI -RADS 2 and 3 from BI -RADS 3, 4a, and 4b using IUS  (H5) and upgrade 
malignant masses relative to IUS  (H6).   
    
 
The study hypotheses are as follows:  
 8.2.1.  Hypothesis 1 : The Imagio specificity is superior to IUS specificity  
Null hypothesis) Ho:  Imagio specificity –  IUS specificity < 0%  
versus    
Alternative hypothesis) Ha: Imagio specificity –  IUS specificity > 0%  
A 6% absolute advantage in specificity is regarded as being the minimum meaningful advantage to help 
spare biopsies .  Specificity superiority will be tested against the null hypothesis of no difference.  
 
8.2.2.  Hypothesis 2 : The Imagio  sensitivity is non -inferior to IUS  
 
Null hypothesis) H
o:  Imagio sensitivity  – IUS sensitivity ≤ - 5% 
 
versus    
 
Alternative hypothesis) H a: Imagio sensitivity  – IUS sensitivity > - 5% 
 Sensitivities are expected to be at least 95% for both Imagio and IUS.  A  5% sensitivi ty non -inferiority 
margin is regarded as being clinically meaningful.  
  
8.2.3. Hypothesis 3:  Imagio  has acceptable stand -alone specificity  
Null hypothesis) H o:  Specificity = 40%  
versus  
Alternative hypothesis) H a: Specificity > 40%

Eff. Date: October 15, 2015 
 Page 54 of 80 
  
A stand -alone specificity exceeding 40%  is regarded as being clinically meaningful.  
 
8.2.4. Hypothesis 4:  Imagio  has acceptable stand -alone sensitivity  
 Null hypothesis) H
o:  Sensitivity = 90% 
 versus     
 
Alternative hypothesis) H
a: Sensitivity > 90% 
 
A stand -alone sensitivity exceeding 95 % is regarded as being clinically meaningful.  
 
8.2.5. Hypothesis 5:  Imagio  evaluation improves the overall diagnostic efficiency for benign masses as  
measured by [CONTACT_389279] -RADS  3 and BI RADS 4a and BI RADS 4 b subgroup s according to IUS .  
A reduction of BI -RADS 4a  and BI-RADS 4b according to IUS to BI -RADS 2 or 3 according to Imagio would 
be a major advance  as would a reduction of BI -RADS 3 according to IUS to BI -RADS 1  or 2 according to 
Imagio .  Specifically, the cancer prevalence ranges from 2% to 10% for the BI -RADS 4a category  and 11% 
to 50% for the BI -RADS 4b category so  a reduction to 1% or 2% would be equivalent to BI -RADS 2 or 3 
which would be sufficient to prevent negative biopsies  and t o delay interval follow -up.  A similar benefit 
would be to reduce cancer prevalence from 2% to <2% for the BI -RADS 3 subgroup.  
 
Null hypothesis) H o:  No difference in BI -RADS according to Imagio  vs. IUS  
 
versus   
 Alternative hypothesis) H
a:  Decreased BI-RADS according to Imagio  vs. IUS  
 A 25%  reduction  to BI -RADS 2/3 from BI -RADS 3/4a/4b is regarded as being clinically meaningful for 
benign masses . 
 
8.2.6.  Hypothesis 6 :  Imagio evaluation improves the overall diagnostic efficiency for malignant  masses 
as measured by [CONTACT_389280] -RADS subgroups according to IUS .  An increase in BI-RADS 
according to IUS to higher BI-RADS according to Imagio would be a major advance.    
 Null hypothesis) H
o:  No difference  BI-RADS according to Imagio  vs. IUS  
 
versus  
 Alternative hypothesis) H
a:  Increased BI -RADS according to Imagio  vs. IUS  
 A 10% increase  in BI -RADS 3/4a/4b/4c to higher BI -RADS 4c/5 is regarded as being clinically meaningful 
for malignant masses.  
 
8.3. Analysis Populations

All analyses will be performed with  the intention to diagnose (ITD) study population which consists of all 
subjects coming in for their scheduled I magio  evaluation , having Imagio data declared evaluable,  and 
having a biopsy at 12 months, or declared to be TN (or FP) at 12months.  
 
 There will be Truth Panel review to identify mass -specific subgroups and TN outcomes as well as reader-
specific exclusions for the following : 
 
1. Cases with QAR concerns (including cases with previously unidentified suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389188], unreliable, or unusable) for exclusions   
2. Cases where the number or numbering of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389179]  (per QARs or IRs) 
for exclusions  
3. Cases with questionable eligibility  for exclusions  
4. Cases with high risk histologies  for separate analyses  
5. Cases where individual IRs identified problems with specific image sets  for exclusions  
6. Cases with NDUs to determine if a mass was a True -Negative (TN)  for specificity calculations.  
 
 
8.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
 
The age, race, ethnicity , menopausal status , breast density, and BI -RADS score  will be presented using 
descriptive statistics for the overall ITD population , by [CONTACT_389281], by [CONTACT_21127]  (individual, private 
practice, academic) , by [CONTACT_389282]  (immediate, delayed, never) , and by [CONTACT_97047]  (benign, high risk , 
malignant) .  
 
 
8.5. Analysis Definitions   
 
The final data for diagnostic test sensitivity  and specificity will be presented in terms of a 2 × 2 table as 
follows ; the threshold for defining a positive  POM will be 2% corresponding to clinical practice standards : 
 
Table 5: [ADDRESS_487786]  + True Positive ( TP) False Positive ( FP) 
Test  - False Negative ( FN) True Negative ( TN) 
 
The above 2x2 table will also be constructed separately for Imagio  and the Imagio diagnostic ultrasound 
component  relative to a cancer or benign diagnosis. In addition, these 2x2 tables will also be generated 
for immediate biopsies, for delayed biopsies, for all biopsies, and for all cases including those not 
biopsied ; discordant pairs for sensitivity a s well as  spec ificity will be analyzed .   Those subject s without a 
biopsy will be excluded if they were not followed without a subsequent clinical evaluation.

Eff. Date: October 15, [ADDRESS_487787] s with a diagnosis ( biopsy or 11 month follow -up with no biopsy)  will be assigned a column in the 
table according to the following rules:  
 
1. If the result of the biopsy results in a cancer diagnosis, then the subject will be assigned to the 
Cancer colu mn.  
2. If the result of the biopsy results in a benign diagnosis, then the subject will be assigned to the Benign column.  
3. If the biopsy was not performed  and the  subject  was evaluated af ter [ADDRESS_487788] -baseline  
(nominal 12 month evaluation) , then the subject will be counted as TN  as long as there were no 
contrary clinical or radiologic findings (not to be based on Imagio) ; any mass declared to have any 
contrary clinical or radiologic findings will be declared to be a False -Positive  if the Im agio POM 
was <2%; otherwise the subject will not be included in the table  
4. If the baseline Imagio  evaluation was not performed  or declared to not be useable , then the 
subject will not be included in the table.  
 
In addition, the cancer group will be further divided into invasive carcinoma and DCIS categories and each 
of these two categories will be assessed separately within a 2x2 t able .  
 The use of the terms sensitivity and specificity is justified in this study because the  biopsy  and 1 1 month  
evaluation (12 month nominal evaluation)  is the gold standard . The following statistical endpoints will be  
assessed  for each image set : 
 
• The true positive rate  (TPR) or sensitivity  of the test is defined as TP/ (TP + FN)  
• The specificity of the test is defined as TN/ (TN + FP)  
• The concordance  of the test is defined as (TP + TN) /N  
• The positive likelihood ratio  is defined as TPR/FPR  
• The negative likelihood ratio is defined as (1 –  TPR)/(1 – FPR) 
• The positive predictive value (PPV)  is defin ed as  TP/ (TP + FP)  
• The negative predictive value  (NPV) is defined as TN/ (TN + FN)  
• The odds ratio  (OR) is defined as (TP/FP)/(FN/TN)    
 Given that biopsy decisions are made using the 2% POM, POM levels > 2% have limited relevance  to the 
2% threshold now widely used for making biopsy decisions . 
 
8.6.  Sample Size Calculation s 
The sample size calcu lations for the P ivotal Study may be increased based  on the  n=800 interim analysis 
results.  The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389189].  
 The interim analysis will provide key information to  check  the preliminary assumptions regarding  
the degree of correlation s between Imagio  and IUS. Imagio can theoretically succe ed with 
improve ments relative to the above two  diagnostic gray scale citations ( 25, 26) with success

8.7. Analyses  
 
8.7.1  Sensitivity and Specificity  
 
The specificity for Imagio relative to  the Imagio ultrasound component (IUS) will be assessed using a one-
sided 9 9.5% lower confidence bound.  The goal is to  establish at least  a 6% absolute advantage in  
specificity  for Imagio vs IUS .

The sensitivities and specificities will be displayed for Imagio relative to IUS; in these displays, the 
consequences of Imagio (positive vs. negative) will be co nsidered and compared using a generalized 
linear model (GENMOD) to account for correlated outcomes among the readers. . 
Additional analyses will be performed using the nomograms for the POM and the diagnosis based on the 
five Imagio features.  The first nomogram models the probability of malignancy (NPP) while the second 
nomogram models the probability of cancer (NPC).  The sensitivity and specificity of the averaged prediction (NPP and N PC) being >0.1 or ≤0.1 will be evaluated.  The ability of the nomogram to 
downgrade benign masses with IUS POM <30% and CDU POM < 30% will also be assessed.  The linear 
regression (NPP) and the logistic regression (NPC) models behind the predictions are bas ed solely upon 
the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389162].  
 
8.7.2 Histologic Considerations  
 
The nature of the malignancies will be analyzed.  While DCIS is considered malignant, many of the vascular and metabolic changes that might be detectable  with OA may be limited to invasive carcinoma. 
Thus, the degree of i nvasive malignant and non -invasive (DCIS) malignant mass es will be analyzed 
separately. It may be that OA is very effective in detecting invasive malignancy, but not as effective at 
detecting DCIS.  The malignant potential becomes a consideration with OA risk benefit if it performed 
better for more invasive and more extensive malignancies, while a missed DCIS carries reduced ris k.  
Other lower risk mass es would include atypi[INVESTIGATOR_389192], atypi[INVESTIGATOR_389193], lobular 
carcinoma in situ, and lobular neoplasia which will be considered benign for the purposes of this study.  
 High risk mass es will also be considered from the perspective of where to distingui sh between benign and 
malignant disease .  Specifically, h istopathologic diagnoses of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_389192], atypi[INVESTIGATOR_389194], and lobular carcinoma in situ, etc. are considered “in between” benign and malignant.  These 
cases will be conside red high risk  as confirmed by [CONTACT_104808] .   Since the features of high risk 
mass es are nonspecific , usually reflect ing the features of the underlying benign mass  in which they arose, 
including such mass es in the malignant category would reduce sensitivity.  As a practical matter, such 
diagnoses are almost always require re -biopsy , e.g. a surgical excision, which often results in an upgrade 
to DCIS or invasive cancer. This information will be collected and  included in the malignant category if so 
classified by [CONTACT_389283] .  However, some cases, 
even after excision, may remain high risk  so high risk masses will always be analyzed separately .
 
8.7.3 Feature  Analysis  
  
Additional analyses will be performed using the specific features from the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_389195].   Six specific pre -defined OA features w ill be scored

Clinical Features   
The basic dermatosis may be mildly or severely exacerbated by [CONTACT_170593], usually within minutes to 
hours. With sunlight avoidance, mass es gradually improve over a period of days to weeks. The UVR -
exacerbated eruption may be limited to sites characteristic of the underlying condition, or, less 
commonly, involve all sun -exposed sites. Photo -testing results are often normal, except in subjects  with 
LE. Occasionally, broad -spectrum irradiation may evoke the eruption.

Differential Diagnosis   
In general, photo -aggravated dermatoses are recognized by [CONTACT_389297] . 
Differentiation from PMLE  (polymorphous light eruption)  by [CONTACT_389298].   Clinically, 
the latter is typi[INVESTIGATOR_389201], has negative lupus serology, and is often characterized by 
[CONTACT_389299] -provocation tests. It is important to note that PMLE may coexist with other 
dermatoses,  in particular with photosensitive psoriasis. Photo -aggravated atopic dermatitis, if 
widespread, may be confused with CAD; however, the latter subjects  have markedly positive photo -test 
results. It is also important to distinguish UVR exacerbation of dermatoses from aggravation due to heat.  
Treatment   
Treatment consists primarily of topi[INVESTIGATOR_389202]. If 
significant photosensitivity persists, low -dose broad - or narrowband UVB or PUVA therapy (as for PMLE) 
may on oc casion be effective. However, the latter is contraindicated in subjects  with LE or 
dermatomyositis, because systemic exacerbation may conceivably occur. Photo -protection is also 
important.

Eff. Date: October 15, [ADDRESS_487809] been used as medications from as early as 4000  BC, with the inhabitants of 
Mesopotamia (and later the Indians and Egyptians) employing plant -derived psoralens for the treatment 
of leukoderma. In 1913, hematoporphyrin -induced photo -toxicity was demonstrated by [CONTACT_389302] -Betz, 
while the current method of PUVA therapy was introduced in the 1970s. Photo -allergy was first 
recognized in [ADDRESS_487810] prevalence  of photo -toxicity and photo -allergy in the general population is unknown, 
their frequency in photo -dermatology referral centers has ranged from 7% to 15% for photo -toxicity and 
from 4% to 8% for photo -allergy .  
Pathogenesis   
The pathogenesis of phototoxicity involves the generation of oxygen  free radicals, superoxide anions, 
hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen, which leads to a host of cytotoxic effects. Other mechanisms of 
tissue damage include the generation of stable photoproducts (reported with chlorpromazine and 
tetracyclines), the form ation of photoadducts (reported with psoralens), and the generation of 
inflammatory mediators (reported with porphyrins and demethylchlortetracycline) . 
The pathogenesis of photoallergy is identical to that of allergic contact [CONTACT_8748], with the exception  of 
the requirement for the presence of UVR to induce photoallergen formation.  
Clinical Features   
 
Photo -toxicity   
Following cutaneous or systemic exposure to a phototoxic agent and appropriate UVR, phototoxicity 
develops within hours; for the vast majority of such agents, the action spectrum is in the UVA range. 
Erythema and edema as well as burning and stinging sensations characterize the initial presentation, 
with vesicles and bul lae seen in severely affected subjects . Phototoxic reactions due to oral medications 
resemble exaggerated  sunburn. These reactions resolve spontaneously with desquamation and 
hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371].  
Other less common manifestations of phototoxicity include pseu doporphyria (frequently caused by [CONTACT_105] -
steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], especially naproxen), photo -onycholysis (reported with 
tetracyclines and psoralens), slate -gray hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (reported with amiodarone, tricyclic 
antidepressants and dil tiazem) , and lichenoid eruptions (seen with quinine and quinidine). Evolution of 
phototoxicity reactions into chronic actinic dermatitis (see above) has rarely been reported following 
exposure to thiazides, quinidine, quinine or simvastatin. The medication s most commonly associated 
with phototoxicity are listed in Table 86.5 .

5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), methotrexate and retinoids, three commonly used medications in dermatology, 
have been associated with ‘photosensitivity’; however, none is associated with UVR -induced activation 
of the drug. UV -exacerbated erythema in subjects  receiving [ADDRESS_487811] likely represents an exacerbation of 5 -FU-induced cutaneous inflammation by [CONTACT_389303]. 
Administration of methotrexate  is known to occasionally cause a recurrence of UV -induced erythema. 
Photo -testing in subjects  taking methotrexate has been normal, and the mechanism for the ‘recall 
erythema’ reaction remains unclear. Photo -testing in subjects  taking isotretinoin or etret inate is also 
usually a routine practice . The propensity for these subjects to develop UV -induced erythema is most 
likely due to retinoid -induced thinning of the stratum corneum.  
Phytophotodermatitis is characterized by [CONTACT_389304] r a day or so after contact 
[CONTACT_389305] (frequently furocoumarin -containing) plus exposure to sunlight. Linear post -inflammatory 
hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_389206] a classic finding. Plants capable of inducing phytophotodermatitis include yarrow, 
parsley, celery, parsnips, milfoil, lime, lemon and fig. Therefore, this condition most commonly occurs in 
individuals whose outdoor activities expose them to such plants (e.g. vegetable harvesters, bartenders).  
Roofers and road workers may occasionally develop phototoxicity sec ondary to exposure to tar plus 
UVA from sunlight. St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ), a product widely available in health food 
stores that is used to treat minor cuts, diarrhea, fever and depression, contains hypericin, a known 
phototoxic agent.  
Photo -allergy   
In previously sensitized individuals, exposure to photo -allergens plus sunlight results in the development 
of a pruritic eczematous eruption. In more severely affected subjects , vesicles and bullae may develop 
(but less commonly than in phot otoxic reaction). While there are clear differences between the clinical 
manifestations of photo -toxicity versus photo -allergy, such differences may not always be obvious, and 
careful history taking and examination are essential.  
Currently, in the US, [LOCATION_006] and [LOCATION_009], sunscreen agents (especially benzophenone -3) are the most 
common cause of photo -allergy, while NSAIDs are the leading photo -allergen in [LOCATION_013], Austria, and 
Switzerland.  Other common photo -allergens include fragrances and anti- bacterial produc ts.

Appendix B: ACR Guidelines  
The American  College  of Radiol ogy, with more than 30,[ADDRESS_487812]  by [CONTACT_389306] d. 
 
Revised 2011 (Resoluti on 11)* 
 
 
ACR PRACTICE  GUIDELINE  FOR THE PERFORMANCE  OF A 
BREA ST ULTRA SOUND EXAMI NATION  
 
 
PREAMBLE  
 
These gu idelin es are an educational tool d esign ed to assist practition ers in providing ap propriate ra diation oncology 
care for patients. They are not inflexible rules or require ments of practice and are not intended, nor should they be 
used, to establish  a legal  standa rd of care.  For these  reasons and those  set forth below,  the American College of  
Radiology cautions against the use o f these guidelines in litigation in which the clinical decisio ns of a practition er are 
called  into question . 
 
The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure or course of action must be made by [CONTACT_389307]. Thus, an approach that differs from the  
guidelines,  standing  alone, does not neces sarily i mply that the approa ch was below  the stand ard of care. To  the 
contrary, a conscientious practition er may res ponsibly adopt a course of actio n different from that set  forth in the 
guidelines when, in the reasonable judgment of the practition er, such course  of action  is indicated  by [CONTACT_389308], limitation s of available  resources, or  advances in knowled ge or technology subsequent to publicatio n of 
the guidelines. Howe ver, a practition er who employs an approach s ubstantially  differe nt from these g uidelines is 
advised to document in the patient record infor mation sufficie nt to explain t he approach taken. 
 
The practice of medicine  involves  not only the science, but also the art of dealing  with the prev ention, diagnosis, 
alleviation, and treat ment of disease. Th e variety and co mplexity of h uman conditions  make it impossible  to always  
reach the most appropr iate diagnosis  or to predict with c ertainty a p articular  response to trea tment.  
 
Therefore, it s hould be reco gnized that adh erence to th ese gui delines  will not assure an  accurate diagnosis  or a 
succes sful outcome. All that sho uld be expected is that the practition er  will  follow  a  reaso nable  course  of  
action based on current knowledge, available res ources, and the needs of the patie nt to deliver effective  and safe 
medical care.  The sole purpose  of these guidelines is to assist practition ers in achieving this objective.

III. QUALIF ICATIONS  AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF T HE PHYSICIAN  
 
A.   Physician  
 
Physicians who supervise, perform, and/or interpret breast ultras ound examinations s hould be licens ed medical 
practition ers who  have a thorough understanding of the indicatio ns for ultrasound e xaminations as well as a 
familiarity  with the basic physical principles and l imitations  of the technology of  ultrasound imaging.  They should 
be familiar with alternative  and co mplementary imaging and diagnostic procedures and  should  be capable of 
correlating  the results of these other procedures  with t he sonographic findings. They s hould have a th orough 
understanding of u ltrasound technology and instrumentation,  ultrasound po wer ou tput, equipment cali bration, and 
safety.  Physicia ns responsible for breast ultras ound examinations s hould de monstrate fa miliarit y with breast 
anatomy, physiology, and pathology. These physicians s hould provide evide nce of the training a nd co mpetence  
need ed to perform bre ast ultrasound exa minations successfully.  
 
Physicians performing and/or interpreting   breast ultrasou nd examination s sho uld meet at least one of t he following  
criteria: 
 
Certification  in Radiology or Diagnostic Radiology by [CONTACT_389309],  the A merican 
Osteopathic Board of Radiology, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada , or the Collège des 
Médecins  du Québec, and involvement with the supervision  and/or  performance,  interpretation ,  and reporting  
of  [ADDRESS_487815]  36 months.1

or 
Completion of an Accred itatio n Council for Graduate Medical  Education  (ACGME) approved diagnostic rad iology 
residency  program and involvement with the supervision and /or performance, interpretation , and reporting of 
[ADDRESS_487816], should meet the f ollowing  criteria: 
completion of an ACGME ap proved  residency  program  in  specialty  practice p lus 200 hours of Category I 
continuing medical edu cation  (CME)  in  breast  ultrasou nd;  and sup ervision and/or performance, interpretation , 
and re porting of   [ADDRESS_487817] 36 months in a supervised situation. 
 
Maintenance of Co mpetence  
 
All physicians performing ultrasound  examinations  shou ld demonstrate evidenc e of continuing competence in the 
interpretatio n and rep orting of those examination s. If co mpetence is assur ed prima rily based  on continu ing 
experienc e, a minimum of  100 examinations  per year is recommended in order to maintain the physician’s skills. 
Because a physician’s pract ice or location may  preclude this method, continued competency can a lso be as sured 
through monitoring and evaluation that indicates acceptable technical  success, accuracy of interpretation, and 
appropria teness  of evaluation. 
 
Continuing Medical E ducation 
 
The physicia n’s continuing education should be in accord ance with the ACR Practice Gu ideline for Continuing 
Medical Educatio n (CME ) and should include CME in  ultrasonography as is a ppropriate to  his or her practice.  
  
B.   Diagnostic Medical S onographer 
 
When a sonographer p erforms the examination, he or  she sh ould be qualified by [CONTACT_389310]. This 
qualificatio n can  be de monstrated by [CONTACT_389311] f or certificati on by a nationa lly recognized 
certifyi ng body. 
 
 
 
1Completion  of an accredited rad iology residency  in the past [ADDRESS_487818] ultraso und e xamination should provide sufficie nt information to 
demonstrate the  medical necessity of the ex amination and allo w for its p roper performance and i nterpretatio n. 
Documentation that satisfies  medical necessity includes 1) signs  and symptoms and/or 2)  relevant hi story (including 
known diagnoses). A dditional information regarding the specific  reason  for the examination or a provisional 
diagnosis would be hel pful and may at times be ne eded to allo w for  the proper performance and interpretatio n of the 
examination.  
 
The request  for the examination  must be  originated by a phy sician or oth er appropriately  licensed  health  care 
provider.  The accompanying  clinical information should be  provided by a physician or other appropriately licensed 
health  care provider fa miliar with the patient’s clinical problem or question and consistent with the state’s  scope of 
practice req uirements.  (ACR Reso lution (35), ado pted in 2006)

V. SPECIF ICATIONS  FOR INDIVIDUAL EXAMINAT IONS  
 
A. Image labeling should include a per manent i dentificatio n label that co ntains: 
 
1. Facility name [CONTACT_21528] n. 
2. Examination date.  
3. Patie nt’s first a nd last name. 
4. Identifying number and/or date of b irth. 
5. Desig nation of right or left breast.  
6. Anatomic location  using clock face notation  or a labeled diagram of the breas t. Transducer orie ntation and 
distance from the nipple to the abnor mality, if present, are  required. 
7. Sonographer’s and/or physician’s  identification  number, initials, or  other sym bol. 
 
B.   Lesion Ch aracterization  and Technical Factors [3]  
 
1. The breast  sonogram shou ld be correlated  with cli nical signs a nd/or s ymptoms and with m ammographi c 
and other appropriate breast i maging studies. If sonography has been p erfor med previously, t he current examination 
shou ld be co mpared with pr ior sono grams, as appropriate.  A lesion or  any area of the breast b eing studied  should   be  
viewed  in  [ADDRESS_487819] 2 planes;  
orthogonal  planes  are recom mended. At least [ADDRESS_487820] (e.g., transverse or l ongitudinal, ra dial or antiradial). The  location of  the lesion  
should be recorded using clock face notation and distance from the nipple, and/or shown  on a diagram of  the 
breast. The length of the transducer face (footprint), us ually between 3.[ADDRESS_487821]  Imaging Re porting and Data Syste m® (BI-
RADS®). The BI -RADS  sonogr aphic categories  include size, sh ape, orientation, margin, echogenicity, lesion 
boundary, attenuation  (e.g., s hadowing or enha ncement), special  cases, vascul arity, and surround ing tissue  [3]. 
 
5. Elast ography, or tissue  stiffness  assess ment, is among the new feature categories  applica ble to 
sonographic analysis  of masses,  to be included in the  Associat ed Findings  section in BI-RADS – Ultrasound, 
edition 2. To mi nimize errors in co mmunication or interpretation, if elast ography is performed, the   color  scales  
should  be an notated  to denote ha rdness or softnes s. 
 
6. Mass characterization  with  ultrasonography is highly dependent on technical factors. 
 
Breast ultraso und should be pe rformed with a high-resolution scanner (see section VII). Gain settings, focal zone 
selection s, and fields  of view s hould be optimized to obtain  high-quality images. The patient should be positioned 
to minimize the thickness of the  p ortion  of  the breast be ing evaluated. For evaluation of lesions in,  on, or just 
beneath  the skin, a stand -off d evice or thick layer  of gel may be hel pful. 
 
C.   Guidance of Interv entional Procedures

(See the ACR Practice Gu ideline for the P erformance of Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Breast I nterventional 
Procedur es.) 
 
When ultraso und guidance is used to assist  in needle place ment for interv entional procedures,  care should be 
taken  to ensure that scann ing geometry and  transducer place ment permit  adequate visualization  of the  needle and 
the needle tip.  
 
VI.        DOCUMEN TATION 
 
Images of all important findings, includ ing, in the case of interventional procedures, t he relati onship of the needle to 
the lesion, should be re corded in a re trievable and revi ewable image  storage format. It i s recommended  that 
documentation of a nega tive targeted or w hole breast u ltrasound examination be performed. 
 
Adequate documentation is esse ntial f or high-quality patient care. There should  be a  permanent  record  of the 
ultrasou nd examination and its interpretatio n. Comparison w ith prior relevant imaging studies may prove helpful. 
Images   of   all   appropriate   areas,   both   normal   and ab normal, should  be recorded .  Variations from  normal  
size should generally be accompanied by [CONTACT_389312]. The initials  of the operator  should be accessi ble on the 
images or electronically  on PACS.  Images should be la beled with the patient identification , facility id entificatio n, 
examination date , and image  orientation . An o fficial interpretati on (final report) of the ultrasound e xamination 
should be included in the patient’s medical record. It is  recom mended that  the re port i nclude a descr iption   of   the   
area   scann ed.   Ret ention   of   the ultras ound   ex amination   i mages   s hould be   bas ed   on clinical need and with 
relevant legal and local health  care facility re quireme nts. 
 
If ult rasound is performed for evaluating cli nical signs and /or symptoms or a finding on mammogra phy, MRI, or 
other breast imaging  modality, the finding(s) should be referred  to in the rep ort. Re porting of lesi ons should 
gene rally include measur ements. Use of an accept ed reporting system , such as BI-RADS®    US, is 
recommended.  
 
Reporting should be in accordance with ACR Prac tice Guideline for Communicatio n of Diagnostic  Imaging 
Findings. 
 
VII.       EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATIONS  
 
Breast  ultrasound should be performed with a high- resolution real-time linear  array scanner op erating at a center 
frequency  of  at  lea st  [ADDRESS_487822] layer of skin, to bring it into 
the focal zon e of the transducer. 
 
VIII.  QUALITY  CONTROL  AND IMPROVEMENT, S AFETY, INFECTION CO NTROL, AND 
PATIENT EDUCA TION  
 
Policies a nd procedures related  to quality, patient educatio n, infection  control, and safety sho uld be devel oped and 
implemented  in accordance with  the ACR P olicy on Quality  Control and Improvement, Safety, I nfection  Control, 
and Patie nt Educati on appearing un der the  head ing Position  Statement on QC & Improvem ent, Safety, Infection

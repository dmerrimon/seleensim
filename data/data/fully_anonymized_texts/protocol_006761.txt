PURPOSE 1.1 Name [CONTACT_860406]®.  
 The intended use of the TempSure® device is to us e the Firm handpi[INVESTIGATOR_860370]-invasive lipolysis. 
 
1.1 Objectives   
1. Primary Objectives:  
 To demonstrate adipocyte injury confirmed by [CONTACT_27183]. 
2. Additional Assessment:  
 Ultrasound measurements. (optional) 
 Evaluation of thermal imaging taken of the treatment during device use. (optional) 
 Safety assessment through the collection of Adverse Events. 
 
 1.[ADDRESS_1199360]’s participation in this study may last up to [ADDRESS_1199361] approximately 8 
months.   
 
2.0 PROTOCOL 
2.1 Protocol Methodology and Analysis  
Methodology: 
Subjects are to be enrolled in this clinical study if they are 18 – [ADDRESS_1199362] an abdominoplasty procedure at one of th e study specified timepoints, after being treated with the 
study device . A maximum of 12 subjects will be enrolle d at up to 3 study centers. Subjects will attend a 
screening/pretreatment visit which may be  performed on the same day as the tr eatment visit.  Subjects may receive 1 
treatment with the Temp Sure® Firm on the abdomen. Su bjects may receive a phone call 1 week (1-10 days) post each 
treatment. Subjects will undergo abdominoplasty surgery at one of four predetermined timepoints after an abdomen 
treatment with TempSure® Firm: day 0 (within 24 hours after treatment), 10 days (+/- 3 days), 20 days (+/-  3 days) , or  30 days (+/- 7 days). This will be determined on availability of the subject and/or on an as needed basis and this 
will be decided by [CONTACT_8981]. An unscheduled visit or phone call may be performed at any time 
during the study at the subject’s request or as  deemed necessary by [CONTACT_9257]. 
 
Analysis: 
Upcoming generations are proving to have an interest in  non-ablative aesthetic treatments and will drive demand for 
innovated products, procedures, and practice design.
i Due to this shift in patient base, practices need to evolve to adapt 
to the newer generational ideologies. There have been rapid advances in RF technology over the past few years and the 
nonsurgical treatment using this energy source offers great promise to our aging population.ii Radiofrequency 
technology for lipolysis needs to be further investigated to optimize treatment parameters for safe and effective non-
ablative aesthetic treatments.
 
Relevance: 
Non-invasive fat reduction is a commonly sought out procedure and continues to increase in demand (+3% from 2018 to 2019)
3 perhaps because, according to the CDC, the preval ence of obesity in the U.S.  was 42.4% in 2017-[ZIP_CODE].  
Currently, the treatments availa ble for non-invasive lipolysis include, but not limited to, radiofrequency, cryolipolysis, 
laser lipolysis, HIFEM, and ultrasound. Th e limitations of current products on the market include different side effect 
profiles and modes of administration. 
 
Testability: The truSculpt device has been  cleared for used using the 2 MHz settin g for the 40cm² handpi[INVESTIGATOR_860371]-invasive lipolysis of the abdomen (FDA K180709). The truSculpt study

utilized the collection of biopsies and safety data. This study will utilize the histology data from multiple   biopsies collected at specified timepoints and safety data to  evaluate the safety and efficacy of the treatment. 
  
Compatibility: Due to such a high prevalence of obesity in the U.S. and the increasing demand for non-invasive lipolysis treatments, 
there is a need to treat unwanted fat in its earlier stages to optimize treatment outcomes. As  a subject gets older or the 
condition worsens,  treatments ma y need to be more aggressive to get the same response as younger subjects or less 
severe cases.  
 
Predictive power: While this study will ob serve lipolysis effects of  tr eatments with TempSure® handpi [INVESTIGATOR_860372], results 
could potentially be applied to a variety of body areas..

2.14 Evaluation Methods 
Photographs: 
Photographs may be taken at all visits and will be used to assess safety of treatment. 
 Histology of Biopsy 
Biopsies of the excised tissue will be obtained and prepared for histology to examine the tissue response following RF 
treatment. Each specimen will first be preserved with a fixative and stained with Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E stain).  Samples will be assessed independently and may be assessed for normal structures, cell viability, vascular injury, and 
overall morphologic traits, injury, and any indications of the healing response. A report will be provided to summarize 
finding for all samples.   
Ultrasound (U/S) 
An ultrasound scan is a noninvasive diagnostic test that us es sound waves to capture live in ternal anatomical images of 
the body. Subjects will  be lying down on a table with a secti on of the body exposed for the test.  A special lubricating 
gel will be applied to the skin. This prevents friction be tween the ultrasound transducer —similar in appearance to a 
microphone— and the sk in. The lubricating gel also helps transmit the sound waves during the scan. After the 
ultrasound e is performed, the gel will be cleaned off the subject with water. The ultrasound typi[INVESTIGATOR_860374] 30 
minutes.  
 
Treatment Discomfort/Pain Evaluation: 
Subjects will be asked to report the general level of treatm ent discomfort on a scale of 0 (none) to 10 (maximum 
intolerable pain) using the universal pain assessment tool (Appendix B) 
 
Temperature Monitoring An infrared thermometer may also be used for temperature monitoring to measure temper ature on the skin before, 
during, and after a treatment. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_1199379] be supported by [CONTACT_737]’s timely assessment and documentation of the adverse event in 
the case report forms or source documents.  All document ed adverse events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_860392] e event meets regulatory reporting requir ements and to ensure timely adverse 
event reporting in compliance with local and global regulatory requirements.  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to the TempSure® Device: 
Mild discomfort during treatment may be experienced by [CONTACT_423]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the discomfort is temporary and localized within the treatment area. Mild edema (swelling)  and erythema (redness) may occur. Initial studies indicate 
that these side effects typi[INVESTIGATOR_40167] 2 to 24 hours. 
 Other anticipated side effects may include pain, skin burns, blistering, bleeding, scarring, crusting, bruising, infection, 
itching, prolonged edema (swelling) and erythema (redness), ha rdness, and nodules. Loss of hair pi[INVESTIGATOR_860375]. 
 
Adverse Events Pertaining  to Ultrasound Gel: 
The gel is a water-based gel that may be placed on the sk in during the TempSure® Firm  treatment. No known adverse 
events are documented. However, an allerg ic reaction is always possible when placi ng a topi[INVESTIGATOR_860376]. Allergic 
reaction may include a mild reaction such as skin redness, irr itation, or hives, all are typi[INVESTIGATOR_860377].  
 Adverse Events Pertaini ng to Neutral Pad: 
Subject may feel mild heat or hot spots during the treatment(s).  If the subject reports heat at the pad site, evaluate the 
site, check for epi[INVESTIGATOR_81865]. Skins burns may occur if subject  does not report feeling excessive heat at the site of the 
pad.  
 
 Adverse Events Pertai ning to Ultrasound: 
Ultrasound imaging has minimal risks and may produce effects on the body such as redness and pockets of gas.  Skin 
rashes from use of the ultrasound gel may also occur.

Significant risk device means an investigational device that: (1) Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for se rious risk to the health, safe ty, or welfare of a subject; 
(2) Is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for 
serious risk to the health, sa fety, or welfare of a subject; 
(3) Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curi ng, mitigating, or treating dise ase, or otherwise preventing 
impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or 
(4) Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk  to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_1199383] been invited to participate based on his/her previous experience with the use 
of the system and/or similar systems and industry experience.  Experience with treatments is the most critical element 
for managing subject risk in this trial. 
 
In addition, as with any study, there is a risk of bias. To minimize/avoid bias, objective evaluation methods (e.g. 
histology) will  be used in conjunction with subjective evaluation methods.. The value of the compensation to the clinical investigator for conducting the study is not influenced by [CONTACT_3433] e study outcome.  If photogra phic results are listed as the 
primary objective, they are to be eval uated by [CONTACT_860393]. If information 
concerning investigator assessment of improvement or inves tigator satisfaction is collected , then it is not listed as an 
objective for the study. 
 
All other known risks will be disclosed to the subject via the informed consent process. Since this is an elective 
procedure and subjects are volunteers, it can be assumed that  signing the informed consent form is indicative of 
agreement to accept the risks involved. 
 Risks to subjects who participate in the study are the sa me as those for subjects undergoing similar noninvasive 
lipolysis treatment(s). It is possible to have an adverse reaction to treatment with the TempSure device .  There may 
also be some unknown side effects.  
3.3 Risk Analysis 
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION: 
Radiofrequency (RF) technology is commonly used in surgery, non-invasive treatments and aesthetic applications. RF 
technology is a safe method for non-ablative (a non-wounding device treatment which heats underlying skin) 
treatment, because energy can be precisely delivered thr ough the skin to the subcutaneous adipose tissue beneath 
without damaging the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196].v  
 According to published data, the elevation of tissue temperatur e between 42°C to 47°C can affect the cellular matrix of 
the adipose tissue creating injury to the adipoc ytes and prompt an inflammatory response.
vi Gradually, the treated 
adipocytes will be removed by [CONTACT_860394] e inflammatory clearing proce ss which may take weeks to 
months. The regeneration of adipose tissue is very slow (ove r years) and the total volume of the fat in treatment area 
will decrease due to the loss of adipocytes. 
 ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION: 
There are two risks identified with the TempSure® device used in this study. The first risk identified is the lack of 
clinical data providing evidence of eff ectiveness of Firm handpi[INVESTIGATOR_860378]. Parameters need to 
be further investigated to be optimized for efficacious results. The second risk id entified is the safety of treatment with 
the TempSure® Firm handpi[INVESTIGATOR_6928] . Since the TempSure® Firm handpi[INVESTIGATOR_860379], optimizing the safety profile is necessary. 
 
The risk identified with the overall clinical in vestigation is the integrity of data collected. 
 There are multiple clinical mitigation strategies for the risks identified. Proper training on the device and protocol will 
be performed. Data from prior investigations will be utilized to minimize side effects and optimize treatment 
outcomes. Monitoring of the study will be implemented to minimize subject and data risks.  
 
ASSESSMENT OF BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION:   
PROTOCOL #: 7027-MCPL-[ADDRESS_1199384] a reduction in unwanted fat.  
CONSIDERATION OF PATIENT PREFERENCE INFORMATION: 
Many physicians support the use of radiofrequency devices for non-invasive cosmetic treatments based on current patient satisfaction. s with approved radiofrequency device s. However, there is still a level of interest in novel 
technologies that effectively reduce fat, potentially elimina ting  the need for invasive treatments for fat reduction.  
 ASSESSMENT OF UNCERTAINTY: 
There is uncertainty of efficacy of tr eatment when TempSure® Firm is used for the treatment of unwanted fat.  
 
CONCLUSION: 
The TempSure® Firm handpi[INVESTIGATOR_860380] 
(lipolysis) but pose no more risk than the currently cleared indications for use.  
  
A previous safety study, CYN18-RF-TISSUE-RD, was conducted using excised human abdominoplasty tissue to test various radiofrequency parameters with the 60mm handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. Additional safety studies, CYN19-TS-ABDOM and 
CYN20-FIRM-HISTO, were conducted using patients scheduled for an abdominoplasty surgery to use in-vivo tissue 
to test various radiofrequency parame ters with the 60mm handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. CYN19- TS-ABDOM used thermal measurements 
of treatment zones were collected to evaluate the depth of penetration and effects on human tissue. CYN20-FIRM-
HISTO use biopsies to analyze histological response.  
 Studies CYN17-RF-CLINIC and CYN19-TS -ENVI-ABD collected safety and ef ficacy data using the 25mm, 30mm, 
and 60mm handpi[INVESTIGATOR_860381] s, including the abdomen and flanks.   
 Patient population to be enrolled in this clinical study:  
Total anticipated population: 12 Subjects  
Age Range years old: 18 – 55 years old  
Gender: Male or Female 
Condition: Unwanted fat on abdomen and scheduled for abdominoplasty surgery

The Investigator and/or designated study staff will review  each event and assess its relationship to the study device 
(not related, unlikely, possible, probable, and highly pr obable). The following definitions will be used for rating 
relationship to the TempSure® Firm treatments:  
 Not related – The event is clearly related to other fact ors such as the subject’s c linical state, therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject. 
 Unlikely – The event was most likely produced by [CONTACT_110195]’s clinical state, therapeutic 
interventions, or a concomitant medication administered to the subject; and does not follow a known response 
pattern to the investigational product. 
 Possible – The event follows  a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational product 
administration; and/or  follows a known response pattern to the study sampling sessions; but could have been 
produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant 
medications administer ed to the subject. 
 Probable – The event follows a r easonable temporal sequence from th e time of investigational product 
administration; and follows a known response pattern to the investigational product; and cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s clin ical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant 
medications administer ed to the subject. 
 Highly Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational product 
administration; and follows a known response pattern to the investigational product; and cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s clin ical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant 
medications administered to the subject; and either occurs immediately following investigational product 
administration, or improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_81888], or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a 
positive reaction at th e application site. 
 Each adverse event reported will be graded on a 3-point severity. Using the following definitions for rating 
severity will be used: 
 Mild – easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, and not interfering with no rmal everyday activities. 
 Moderate – sufficiently discomforting and ma y interfere with normal everyday activities. 
 Severe – incapacitating and/or pr eventing normal everyday activities. 
 
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is any adverse device experience that results in any of the following outcomes:  
death, a life-threatening adverse device experience, in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318], a 
persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital  anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may 
or may not result in death, be life-thr eatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_487738] a serious adverse device 
experience when, based upon appropriat e medical judgment, they may jeopardi ze the subject or subject may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
 If any of the above adverse events are serious as defined by [CONTACT_58317] (CFR), Title 21, 
special procedures will be followed.  All serious adverse ev ents will be reported within [ADDRESS_1199392] to follow-up.  Adverse events will be captured throughout the study and where 
appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be perfor med to document the resolution of event(s). Outcomes may 
be classified as resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, fata l, unknown or lost to follow-up.  Following the resolution 
of any study-associated adverse events there will be  no further adverse event reports for that subject.

will be classified using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria.  
6.11.1  Adverse Event Reporting  
Patients will be instructed that they may report AEs at a ny time. All events reported 
following study medication administration will be recorded as treatment emergent AEs 
(TEAEs).  
Monitoring of ongoing AEs will be continued up to 30 days after study medication 
administration. In the event that an AE is not resol ved or stabilized by [CONTACT_159753], the sponsor 
in consultation with the investigator will decide whether to continue to monitor the AE or 
close -out the event in the database if no further follow -up is necessary.  
For this study, an AE is defined as: “Any untow ard medical occurrence in a study patient 
administered any dose of the study medication APD334  and which does not necessarily have 
to have a causal relationship with this treatment.” An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of the study medication, whether or not related to the 
product. AEs can be any of the following:  
• Unfavorable changes in general condition  
• Subjective or objective signs/sym ptoms  
• Concomitant disease or accidents  
• Clinically relevant adverse changes in laboratory parameters observed in a patient 
in the course of a clinical study  
• Pre-existing conditions which worsen in severity or frequency or which have new 
signs/symptoms assoc iated with them  
 
Adverse events will be elicited at the time indicated in the schedule by [CONTACT_244330]: 
“Since you were last asked, have you felt unwell or different from usual in any way?”  Any 
adverse or unexpected events, signs and symptoms, will  be fully recorded on the Adverse 
Event Form including details of intensity, onset, duration, outcome and relationship to the 
drug as determined by [CONTACT_978].  Whenever possible, a constellation of signs and symptoms 
should be recorded as a unifying diagnosis  (e.g., self -limited fever, runny nose, cough, and 
scratchy throat should be captured as an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_736621]). AEs may also be reported at any time. The type and 
duration of follow -up of patients after AEs will be documented.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) Checklist  
A patient with multiple sclerosis developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML) after nearly 8 months of treatment with another S1P 1 agonist21, and  enablement of the 
John Cunningham (JC) virus is therefore a potential adverse effect of this therapeutic class. 
Patients in this trial should therefore be monitored for any new onset or worsening of

Clinical Trial Protocol : APD334 -[ADDRESS_1160224]; if confirmed, discontinue dosing permanently.  
The investigator or subinvestigator will administe r the subjective PML checklist.  The 
subjective PML checklist will be administered at each site visit to probe for symptoms 
suggestive of PML. Any patients reporting signs and/or symptoms of PML will undergo 
objective testing and may be referred to a neurol ogist for a full evaluation.  
A copy of the PML checklist is provided in Appendix 2 . 
6.11.2  Serious Adverse Events and Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events  
A Serious Adver se Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results 
in the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Is Life -Threatening  
• Required/Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Disability/Incapacity  
• Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect  
• Important Medical Event  
SAEs will be captured from the time of ICF signature [CONTACT_1639] [ADDRESS_1160225] dose of study 
drug, and will be monitored until resolution or stabilization.  
An important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128151] c onsidered a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it 
may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such a medical event includes allergic 
bronc hospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or surgery for clear ly pre -existing conditions (for example a 
surgery that has been scheduled prior to the patient’s entry into the study) will not be 
reported as a SAE. All other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], including elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_244291] -existin g, will be reported as a SAE.   
Any AE considered serious by [CONTACT_835695] (PVG) using the remote data capture (RDC) system within 
[ADDRESS_1160226] 
information is to be used for SAE reporting:

6.11.[ADDRESS_1160227](s) will be classified using modified 
WHO criteria (Edwards and Biriell, World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for 
International Drug Monitoring 1994) as follows.  
Related :  a clinical event, incl uding laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal 
(dechallenge). R echallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition; or an event 
that could also be explained by [CONTACT_736654].  
Not related :  a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with sufficient evidence 
to accept that there is no causal relationship to drug administration (e.g., no temporal 
relationship to drug administration, because the drug was administered after onset of event; 
investigat ion shows that the drug was not administered; proof of other cause; etc.); or an 
event with a temporal relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide plaus ible 
explanations.

Guideline and documented in the CRF according to the following:  
• Drug Withdrawn  
• None (not changed)  
• Dose Interrupted  
• Unknown  
• Not Applicable  
 
6.11.8  Collection of Extra Laboratory Samples/Investigations  
In the event of a clinically important AE, a suitable sample may be collected for drug assay 
or for additional laboratory tests. The investigator must ensure that the sample is properly 
labeled and stored. The investigator and others responsible for care of the patient  should 
institute any supplementary investigatio ns of significant AEs based on the clinical judgment 
of the likely causative factor. This may include seeking a further opi[INVESTIGATOR_35269] a specialist in 
the field of the AE. The company may suggest special tests based on expert advice.  
6.11.[ADDRESS_1160228] will be followed -up initially for 30 days according to the site’s standard 
practice for AE follow -up. AE s that have not resolved or stabilized at [ADDRESS_1160229] 
patient’s last study dose, will be reviewed with the sponsor on an individual basis to 
determine whether the database will be locked and subsequently updated once the events of 
ongoing AEs ar e resolved or whether database lock will be held.

8.1 Data Collection  
All data (ECGs, clinical laboratory data, and all other study -related data) will be collected 
according to the sponsor or CRO’s SOPs.  
Upon database lock, which occurs after resolution of all queries, the CRO, if applicable, will 
provide statistical analysis software (SAS) transfer datasets to the sponsor and to the 
biostatistician for analysis using secure electronic data transfer per the sponsor’s 
specifications.

Actvities (MedDRA) and tabulated, including categorical information of interest such as 
onset and resolution times, time of onset relative to dose, severity at onset, maxim um 
severity, causal relationship to study medication, and action taken. Whenever possible, a 
constellation of signs and symptoms should be recorded as a unifying diagnosis (e.g., self -
limited fever, runny nose, cough, and scratchy throat should be captured  as an upper

treatment group.  
 
9.2 Sample Size and Power Calculations   
Patient  enrollment is limited by [CONTACT_835696]334 -003 
study . Therefore sample size and power calculation is not needed.  
9.3 Analysis Populations  
The analyses of all proportion based efficacy variables will use the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) 
population as primary. For other continuous efficacy endpoints, the Modified Intent -to-Treat 
(MITT) population will be used as primary. A completer’s population will  be used as a 
secondary analysis population for the efficacy  endpoints.   
INTENT -TO-TREAT POPULATION (ITT):  
This population consists of all enrolled  patients, who received at least 1 dose of APD334 in 
the extension study . 
MODIFIED INTENT -TO-TREAT POPULATIO N (MITT):  
This population consists of all enrolled  patients, who received at least [ADDRESS_1160233] the needed data for inclusion in the MITT 
population for some endpoints but not for others.  
COMPLETERS POPULATION (CP):  
This population consists of all patients who completed the extension study. No missing data 
will be imputed for this analysis. Any substantial differences between conclusions based on 
the ITT /MITT  population and the completers’ population will be investigated.  
SAFETY POPULATION (SP):  
The Safety Population will include all enrolled patients who received study medication  in the 
extension study . 
9.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
All baseline patient characteristics of demographic data (age, height, weight, race), ulcerative

either 400 or 500 mg, once a day (QD), dependent on randomization. 
Reference product, dosage and mode of administration   
No reference product will be used. 
Duration of study (expanded/phase II):  
The part II study will have [ADDRESS_241988] 6 cycles of treatment, subjects 
without progressive disease (PD) may continue GT0918 treatment with the approval of the investigator 
and sponsor; treatment can continue until a subject experience an intolerable adverse event (AE) or 
bone or radiographic disease progression, withdraws consent or termination of the study by [CONTACT_103]. This approval is required for entering the next 6 cycle treatments (for starting on C7D1, 
C13D1, C19D1, C25D1). All subjects will have End-of-study visit over [ADDRESS_241989] dose of study medication.  
 
Criteria for evaluation (expanded/phase II): 
Safety monitoring:  
Toxicity reported during the study will be graded according to the CTCAE v4.03. Laboratory 
Assessments will include PSA, blood chemistry, hematology, lipid profiles, ECGs, and urinalysis. 
 
Safety and tolerability data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in order to make decisions for dose 
selection and safety management. The following will be promptly reported to the assigned Medical 
Monitor from Sponsor: 
a. SAEs, within 24 hours 
b. AEs resulting in permanent discontinuation from study, regardless of seriousness or relationship 
to study drug. 
c. Treatment modifications  (i.e., dose discontinuation, temporary interruption, or dose reduction). 
Dose modification is allowed for this trial. Subjects may skip or discontinue treatment if they 
experience at least one of the following adverse events that are considered by [CONTACT_202829] “possibly”, “probably” or “definitely” related to study drug. Treatment modifications 
will be made based on the specified criteria: 
1) For any subjects experiencing grade 3 or 4 hematologic or biochemical toxicity, study drug 
will be temporarily interrupted until toxicity resolves to grade 1 or better Protocol_Amendment 1_5.0_18 Mar 2021 | VV-TMF-14443057 | 1.0

hepatoxicity mental impairment and anxiety, study drug will be temporally interrupted until 
toxicity resolves to grade 1 or better 
3) If the Investigator considers that continuing study drug is clinically beneficial for the 
subjects, the treatment and dose can be resumed. For some subjects if dose reduction is safe 
and clinically appropriate, a dose range of 25-50% dose reduction from original starting 
dose can be considered. The dose modification and schedule must be discussed with the 
medical monitor prior to implementation. Possible dose reductions are proposed as follow. 
i. For dose cohort of 400mg: starting dose can be 200mg or 300mg 
ii. For dose cohort of 500mg: starting dose can be 300mg or 400mg  
4) Dose restoration: If any subjects on reduced dose for [ADDRESS_241991] 
an option for the dose modification, for example, either to remain on the same dose or 
increase one dose level up or resume initial dose. The dose modification shall be considered 
based on investigator’s clinical judgement for the best interest and care of subject and it 
must be discussed with medical monitor before implemented and document CRF timely and 
properly.    
d. The Investigator will make critical laboratory safety data available in a timely manner. 
Availability of these data will also enable the Sponsor to notify other participating study centers, as 
well as regulatory authorities, of events occurring during the trial. 
 
Assessment of safety:  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_2695], vital signs, 12-lead ECG, pain score, and laboratory tests. 
 
Assessment of efficacy variables: 
a. Assessment of PSA: Blood samples will be collected to determine the serum total PSA 
concentration. 
b. Change of PSA from baseline: The proportion of subjects achieving a ≥50% reduction in PSA 
at 3 months (12 weeks) as compared to baseline (study entry) will be determined. 
a. Assessment of soft tissue and bone (RECIST and Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-2 
criteria): 
1) Soft tissue: Chest, abdomen, and pelvic CT or MRI will be performed. Changes in the 
size of target lesions will be evaluated. The timepoint overall response will be reported.  
2) Bone scan: Radionuclide bone scan will be performed. Number of Bone Lesion, and 
changes in the number of lesions  will be reported. 
3) Skeletal-related events: Severity of skeletal-related event (bone pain, analgesia intake) 
will be assessed monthly per PCWG2.  
b. Performance status: ECOG performance status will be assessed. Changes from baseline will 
be evaluated  Protocol_Amendment 1_5.0_18 Mar 2021 | VV-TMF-14443057 | 1.0

remarkable symptoms at its early stage. Once symptoms are observed, the disease will be often 
at an advanced stage. Then the cancer progresses rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. If it is not treated in a timely manner, 
the average survival time will be only 3 to 5 years from the date when the symptoms are 
discovered. Metastasis is very common in subjects with prostate cancer. Approximately 1/3 to 
2/[ADDRESS_241999] medical visit, and hematologic 
metastases are often seen in bone. This disease depends on dihydrotestosterone (DHT) which 
activates androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Endocrine therapy (including surgery, chemotherapy 
or anti-androgen deprivation therapy or combined androgen blockade therapy) is a preferred 
treatment for prostate cancer. This treatment is very effective for the majority of subjects at the 
initial stage but after a median period of treatment of [ADDRESS_242000] all subjects will 
gradually develop castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with a median survival of less than 
20 months, and urgently need a further treatment. 
As for the specific treatment for prostate cancer, surgical castration (radical prostatectomy, 
transurethral resection of prostate [TURP], and bilateral orchiectomy) and medical castration 
(luteinizing hormone releasing hormone [LHRH] antagonist and gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone [GnRH] antagonist) are the preferred means for early treatment, and they can be 
performed in combination with treatments such as endocrine, immune, differentiation, gene and 
radiation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Most androgens are from the testes and a lesser amount originate from the 
adrenal glands; surgical castration can only remove the androgens originating from the testes, 
and the adrenal glands still secrete a significant amount of steroids, producing androgens and 
precursors of testosterone that enter prostatic tissues and are then released into the blood. 
Prostate cancer is highly sensitive to androgen. To achieve the purpose of treatment of prostate 
cancer, synthesis of androgen must be suppressed to prevent its interaction with AR on the cell 
surface, thereby [CONTACT_202830]. The usual androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT) is mainly focused on the hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-testicular gonadal axis generated 
by [CONTACT_202831]. The drug treatments are: 1) endocrine axis blocking therapy; 2) direct inhibition of 
androgen synthesis, and 3) androgen receptor inhibitor. For example, estrogen 
(Diethylstilbestrol, Transdermal estradiol and Conjugated estrogens [Premarin® tablets]) can be 
used to regulate the hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-gonadal axis to reduce testosterone production; 
inhibitors produced by [CONTACT_202832] (corticosteroids, ketoconazole and CYPC19 inhibitor 
abiraterone) reduce testosterone synthesis by [CONTACT_202833]. Androgen receptor 
(AR) antagonists in combination with anti-androgen drugs are currently the most effective drug Protocol_Amendment 1_5.0_18 Mar 2021 | VV-TMF-14443057 | 1.0

bicalutamide (trade name [CONTACT_202866]®) and enzalutamide (trade name [CONTACT_202867]®) all belong to 
this class of androgen receptor antagonists. 
Enzalutamide (Xtandi) has a higher antagonistic activity than bicalutamide in CRPC cells and 
effectively suppresses the activation, preventing AR transfer from then cytoplasm to the nucleus 
and from binding to DNA, ultimately achieving significant clinical efficacy for advanced 
castration-resistant prostate cancer. Enzalutamide has shown long half-life in subjects (3-13 
days). When administered once a day, it will lead to serious drug accumulation, resulting in 
significant side effects, fatigue 34%, headache12%, and some serious neurotoxicity, such as 
induced epi[INVESTIGATOR_202805] 1-2 %. 
GT0918 is a new investigational second-generation androgen receptor antagonist with more 
specificity and activity in inhibiting androgen receptors; in particular, it can maintain a pure role 
of an antagonist because it does not activate the AR of CRPC cells compared to bicalutamide. As 
compared to enzalutamide, GT0918 has improvement in target potency as well as drug 
disposition properties. It is expected to reduce drug accumulation, which may reduce drug 
exposure in the CNS, therefore avoiding the CNS side effect such as seizure. 
In addition, GT0918 demonstrates a dual mechanism of action in cell assays, i.e., highly 
effective in inhibiting AR as well as exhibiting pharmacological effects of inducing the down-
regulation of AR expression; the mechanism that is not seen in bicalutamide and enzalutamide. 
Considering that over-expression of AR is one of the major mechanisms for generating 
resistance in castration therapy for prostate cancer, GT0918 could alleviate the resistance of 
castration therapy for prostate cancer because of the dual mechanism of action thus is expected 
to be a more effective and less toxic second-generation CRPC drug therapy. GT0918 may 
provide clinical benefits to some of the CRPC subjects who have developed resistance to 
enzalutamide or abiraterone treatments. 
3.2 Background on GT0918 
3.2.1   Nonclinical Studies 
Safety pharmacology, single dose and repeated dose toxicity studies, as well as genotoxicity 
study in pre-clinical in vitro  and in vivo  animal models suggests that GT0918 has an acceptable 
safety profile when projected for human use. The starting dose of 50 mg of GT0918 is selected 
for the treatment of subjects with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in the 
proposed dose ascending MTD study.

observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 60 mg/kg after GT0918 orally administered to SD 
rats for 28 days. In Beagle dogs, the MTD and NOAEL were 2000 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg, 
respectively, in the acute and the 28-day study. The adverse effect noted in rat and dog studies 
were reversible during the 4-week recovery period. No seizure or convulsion was observed in 
animals throughout the general toxicology studies including high doses in acute studies as well 
as repeat dosing studies. 
In the 13-week oral gavage toxicity and toxicokinetics study in Sprague Dawley rats with a 4-

hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis changes were noted. Low body weight was observed 
during the dosing phase in animals given ≥45 mg/kg/day, and recovered during the recovery 
phase. Minor clinical chemistry changes (e.g., increased cholesterol, phosphorus, and globulin 
and decreased albumin and chloride) were observed during the dosing phase and recovered in the 
recovery phase. Large adrenal glands (females ≥45 mg/kg/day) and small prostates (males 90 
mg/kg/day) were observed during the dosing phase and recovered in the recovery phase. 
Microscopic findings, including those in the adrenal cortex (≥20 mg/kg/day), liver (≥45 
mg/kg/day), seminal vesicles and prostate (atrophy, noted males ≥45 mg/kg/day), and mammary 
gland (males ≥20 mg/kg/day), were observed in the dosing phase. These microscopic findings 
had partially to completely resolved after the 4-week recovery phase. Since the findings were not 
severe, they were not considered as adverse. Based on these findings, the no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) and the highest none-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) were 90 mg/kg/day. 
The corresponded GT0918 AUC 0-t values in males and females on Day 91 were 159,000 and

inhibited hERG-mediated potassium current in CHO cells with an IC 50 much higher than 10 μM.

of GT0918 is low. In addition, no evidence of QTc prolongation was observed in the 
cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_202808] 50 mg/kg. 
No significant changes in CNS function were observed with GT0918 in rats at doses up to 180 
mg/kg. GT0918 did not produce adverse effects on cardiovascular functions, respi[INVESTIGATOR_202809] 50 mg/kg.  
In addition, no evidence for activity of GT0918 was identified using in vitro  Ames test, 
chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung fibroblast with or without S9 metabolic 
activation system and in vivo  micronucleus study using bone marrow in ICR mice. 
The above-mentioned 13-week subchronic toxicity studies in SD rats and Beagle dogs, safety 
pharmacology studies as well as genotoxicity studies conducted under the U.S. GLP regulations 
will support the IND opening of GT0918 in U.S. 
Altogether, these findings with high doses of GT0918 in animal were fairly benign.  When 
choosing a dose for start of clinical studies in humans, algorithms were used to choose a lower 
dose at which these findings would be absent or minimized.  Based upon the preclinical findings, 
same class drugs, the following common adverse events may be encountered during clinical trial:  
hot flush, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and fatigue. Other 
reported adverse events from same class drugs will be monitored including not limited to back 
pain, constipation, hypertension, pain in extremities, arthralgia, and some rare cases of seizures.  Protocol_Amendment 1_5.0_18 Mar 2021 | VV-TMF-14443057 | 1.0

treated with GT0918 at seven dose levels: daily 50 mg (n = 3), 100 mg (n = 6), 200 mg (n=6), 
300 mg (n=7), 400 mg (n=7), 500 mg (n=6), 600 mg (n=5). All subjects progressed on multiple 
lines of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44793], but not limited to, bicalutamide, abiraterone, enzalutamide, 
docetaxel, cabazitaxel, radium 223, sipuleucel T and pembrolizumab. No DLT has been 
identified in the planned dose escalation cohorts thus MTD is not defined. GT0918 has been 
shown generally well tolerated and it has some CTCAE grade 1 and 2 AEs reported, such as 
fatigue, lethargy, nausea, loss of appetite, anemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, 
hyperglyceridemia, hot flush, constipation, etc. Three events of 2 grade 3 fatigue, 1 grade 3 
anemia, and one event of grade 4 elevated creatine kinase (CK) were reported. Stable disease by

part II study to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of 2 dosages: 400 and 500 mg in 
selected subjects with mCRPC progressed on prior treatment either abiraterone or enzalutamide. 
Early phase 1 study performed in China included 19 subjects who were treated with GT0918 in 
various doses 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg over 3 months.  Mild to moderated 
drug-related AEs were reported, such as hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, 
hyperglyceridemia, peripheral edema, hot flash, fatigue, nausea, constipation. 
Therefore three more clinical trials (China Phase 1 Bioavailability Study, GT0918-CN-1001, 
GT0918-CN-1002) regarding to GT0918 bioavailability in healthy subject and as a monotherapy 
drug in mCRPC subjects have finished in China and five on-going GT0918 clinical trials in

specificity and activities in inhibiting androgen receptors; in particular, it can maintain a pure 
role of an antagonist because it does not activate AR of CRPC cells compared to bicalutamide. 
As compared to enzalutamide, GT0918 has improvement in target potency as well as drug 
disposition properties. It is expected to reduce drug accumulation, which may reduce drug 
exposure in the CNS, therefore avoiding the CNS side effects of enzalutamide such as seizure, 
thus improving the safety profile. 
In addition, GT0918 demonstrates a dual mechanism of action in cell assays, i.e., highly 
effective in inhibiting AR as well as other pharmacological effects such as down-regulation of 
AR expression; a mechanism that is not seen in bicalutamide or enzalutamide. Considering that 
over-expression of AR is one of the major mechanisms for generating resistance in castration 
therapy for prostate cancer, GT0918 could alleviate resistance of castration therapy for prostate 
cancer as result from the dual mechanism of action thus is expected to be a more effective and 
less toxic second-generation CRPC drug therapy. GT0918 may provide clinical benefits to some 
of the subjects who have developed resistance to enzalutamide or abiraterone treatments. These 
properties make GT0918 an ideal candidate suitable for testing in subjects with metastatic 
hormonal sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) or metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer 
(mCRPC).

6 INVESTIGATIONAL PLANS (EXPANDED/PHASE II) 
6.1 Description of Overall Study Design and Plan 
This expanded/Phase II, open-label, randomized, and multi-center clinical study is designed to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of GT0918, an orally administered AR antagonist, in 
mHSPC or mCRPC subjects who failed prior treatment of either abiraterone or enzalutamide. All 
subjects will be randomized to either take [ADDRESS_242006] with superior characteristics compared to 
currently marketed AR antagonists based on both preclinical and clinical data.   
Based on clinical experience and outcomes from phase 1 (part I) dose escalation of GT0918, it is 
recommended for [ADDRESS_242007] initial treatment up to 
6 cycles. Dose reduction is allowed for subjects (see Section 8.6.3) who experiences any study 
drug related intolerable toxicities. Study drug GT0918 is suggested to be taken on an empty 
stomach. If dosing before meal time, it is recommended to wait 1 hour before eating. If dosing 
after meals, it is recommended to wait 2 hours before taking the study drug.

of study drug to the Sponsor for storage and/or disposal.  These records should include dates, 
quantities, batch/blister card/pouch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], in-clinic temperature log(s), 
and unique code numbers assigned to the study drug and study subjects.   
At each visit after initiation of treatment, site staff will record compliance of subjects with their 
assigned regimen.  Subjects will be instructed to bring their study drug pouches containing 
unused/partially used/empty blister cards back for inspection at each study visit.  Subjects are to 
be reminded of the importance of compliance with their assigned regimen, with an emphasis on 
taking their study drug on schedule and maintaining the prescribed interval between doses. 
Investigators will maintain records that document adequately that the subjects were provided 
with the correct study drug kits and will reconcile the products received from the drug dispensing 
center.  Study drug will not be returned to the Sponsor or destroyed at the clinical site until 
accountability has been fully determined. 
Medication containers must be returned at each visit, as compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_202839].  Noncompliance is defined as taking less than 80% or more than 120% of study drug 
during any outpatient evaluation period (visit to visit). Discontinuation for noncompliance is at

12.5.1  Adverse Event Description and Reporting 
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges 
or, if present at screening, worsens during the study, regardless of the suspected cause of the 
event.  All medical and psychiatric conditions (except those related to the indication under study) 
present at screening and up until the first dose of study medication will be documented in the 
medical history eCRF.  Worsening of these conditions and newly emerged symptoms, physical 
signs, syndromes, or diseases should be noted on the AE eCRF during the study.   
Progressed disease (PD) and death caused by [CONTACT_202845]/SAE and should not be reported on 
the AE page of the eCRF.  
Laboratory test results will be recorded on the laboratory results pages of the eCRF.  Laboratory  
test value abnormalities, if not clinically significant, should not be reported on the AE page of 
the eCRF as AEs.  Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should be recorded as AEs.  
Conditions that result from a pre-planned surgical procedure arranged before the subject 
enrollment, are not considered AE or SAEs if the expected conditions were known before study 
inclusion. Such medical condition should be reported in the subject’s medical history. 
Additionally, anticipated AEs for this study population, listed below, must be reported by 
[CONTACT_202846].  Instead 
these AEs will be reviewed in aggregate every [ADDRESS_242031] of Anticipated AEs for this Study

Subjects will be asked about and instructed to report AEs at each study visit.  All drug-related 
AEs are to be followed until resolution or until a stable clinical endpoint is reached. 
All AEs are to be documented on the eCRF with reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event (if any), and 
outcome.  Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or non-serious.  Changes in 
AEs and resolution dates are to be documented on the eCRF. 
The purposes of this phase II trial is to study safety and tolerability of GT0918, the period of 
collection of AEs is from the time of first dose to the last dose of study drug or EoS visit. The 
30-day safety follow up “window” is set to capture possibly drug-related AE and/or SAE. 
Regardless if subject has discontinued from study drug, any drug-related AE or SAE is required 
to follow until the event is resolved or stabilized at a level of baseline.  
When subject starts with new therapy, the safety window of AE collection is closed 
simultaneously. All drug-unrelated or irrelevant AEs/SAEs such as disease progression and/or 
from new treatment should NOT be reported.

drug, but for which no extraneous cause may be found.  An AE may be considered unlikely 
to be related to study drug if or when it meets 2 of the following criteria:  (1) it does not 
follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test drug; (2) it could 
readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or 
other modes of therapy administered to the subject; (3) it does not follow a known pattern of 
response to the test drug; or (4) it does not reappear or worsen when the drug is re-
administered. 
POSSIBLY: This category applies to those AEs for which a connection with the test drug 
administration appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty.  An AE may be 
considered possibly related if or when it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it follows a 
reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not readily have 
been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes 
of therapy administered to the subject; or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the 
test drug.

of therapy administered to the subject; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction 
in dose (note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation 
of the drug, yet drug-relatedness clearly exists; for example, as in bone marrow depression, 
fixed drug eruptions, or tardive dyskinesia); or (4) it follows a known pattern of response to 
the test drug. 
DEFINITELY: This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels are 
incontrovertibly related to test drug.  An AE may be assigned an attribution of definitely 
related if or when it meets all of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_202849]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy administered to the subject; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or 
reduction in dose and recurs with re-exposure to drug (if rechallenge occurs); and (4) it 
follows a known pattern of response to the test drug. 
 
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event should be noted.  If the intensity category changes over a number of days, 
then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). 
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03 (NCI CTCAE V4.03) (Grades 1 to 5).

A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared after the protocol is approved.  This document 
will provide further details regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis 
methodology to address all study objectives.  The SAP will serve as a compliment to the protocol 
and supersedes it in case of differences. 
The statistical evaluation will be performed using the Statistical Analysis Software (SAS®) 
Version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  All data will be listed, and summary tables will 
be provided.  Summary statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_7169].  For continuous variables, data 
will be summarized with the number of subjects (N), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum by [CONTACT_1570].  For categorical variables, data will be tabulated 
with the number and percentages of subjects for each category by [CONTACT_1570]. No interim 
analyses are planned for the Phase II dose expansion study.   
13.1 Determination of Sample size 
Phase II dose expansion stage consists of 2 arms of 30 subjects/arm, for a total of 60 subjects for 
Phase II.  Altogether, up to 60 subjects will be estimated for the randomization and stratified by 
[CONTACT_202854] (abiraterone or enzalutamide).  
Of note, the study does not allow disease progression on both abiraterone or enzalutamide. If 
prior treatment of one of these 2 drugs (i.e. abiraterone) only lasted less than [ADDRESS_242037] (i.e. progressed on enzalutamide) is eligible and prior therapy of 
enzalutamide will be considered.  
 
13.2 Analysis Populations 
The Safety Analysis Set (SAF) will include all subjects who take at least 1 dose of study 
medication. Safety analyses will be conducted using the safety population.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all evaluable subjects used as the supportive analysis 
population for efficacy. The FAS population will be used as the primary analysis population for 
efficacy. 
The Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set will include all FAS subjects with the Week 12 PSA 
assessment and without major protocol violations.

13.4 Efficacy Analysis 
Assessment of Efficacy Variables: 
1. Assessment of PSA: Blood samples will be collected to determine the serum total PSA 
concentration. 
2. Change of PSA from baseline:  
a. The percentage of change of PSA from baseline Week 12 will be calculated. 
Maximum percentage change of PSA from baseline at any time will be calculated. 
b. The proportion of subjects achieving a ≥50% reduction in PSA at 3 months (12 
weeks) as compared to baseline (study entry) will be determined. 
3. Assessment of soft tissue and bone: 
c. Soft tissue: Chest, abdomen, and pelvic CT, or MRI (if CT not possible), will be 
performed. Changes in the size of target lesions will be evaluated. 
d. Bone scan: Radionuclide bone scan will be performed. Changes in the number of 
lesions will be reported. 
e. Skeletal-related events: Severity of skeletal-related event (bone pain, analgesia 
intake) will be assessed monthly per PCWG2. 
4. Symptomatic progression will be evaluated by [CONTACT_24975]. Symptomatic progression is defined 
as evidence of unequivocal symptomatic or clinical progression defined by [CONTACT_2669] 1 of 
the following: 
 A marked escalation in cancer-related pain that is assessed by [CONTACT_202855]. Ignore early 
changes (≤ 12 weeks) in pain or health-related quality of life in absence of compelling 
evidence of disease progression. Confirm progression of pain or health-related quality 
of life ≥ 3 weeks later, Protocol_Amendment 1_5.0_18 Mar 2021 | VV-TMF-14443057 | 1.0

Note: For days not specifically designated on the schedule of assessments, the standard of care for the individual institution will be followed, any 
AEs and concomitant medications will be recorded on the CRF. 
1. This schedule applies to Phase II study of GT0918 including screening, treatment of first 6 cycles and additional cycles for eligible subjects. 
One cycle constitutes 4 weeks of treatment. See Section 9.2 Expanded/Phase II Study Visits. 
2. Full medical and surgical history will be recorded at Screening. At Cycle 1, Day 1; an interim history prior to first dose of study drug is to be 
recorded as concomitant illness. 
3. Imaging that is performed during standard care within 6 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1 prior to informed consent may be used to confirm screening 
requirements. Disease status will be measured by [CONTACT_202862] (CT or MRI or bone scan) at screening, and every 3 cycles, i.e. 84 days 
(+/- 14 days) after Day 1. No subject is permitted to have additional cycles until it is confirmed that disease progression has not occurred.  
4. Vital signs will include weight, height (Screening only), BSA (Screening only), body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], radial pulse rates, and 
systolic/diastolic blood pressures. 
5. Complete physical examinations will be conducted at Screening (Day -28 to Day -1), on Days 85 (C4D1) and 169 (C7D1), on every 3 months 
during the extension study. All other physical examinations will be abbreviated. Complete physical examinations will include examination of 
general appearance, skin, neck (including thyroid), eyes, nose, throat, heart, lungs, abdomen, lymph nodes, extremities, muscular skeletal and 
nervous system. Abbreviated physical examinations will focus on new symptoms and will include examinations identified as relevant by [CONTACT_1275]. PE record if subject complains bone pain, compromised urinary or bowel movements. For bone pain, location and severity are 
needed in CRF. If pain killers are taken, names, dosage, and frequency use are noted under concomitant medication in CRF.  
6. After Cycle 1, ECOG performance status will be assessed every cycle (4 weeks) during Cycles 2-6 and extension cycles, and at EOS/ET Visits. 
7. Hematology and chemistry assessments will be done as defined with a window of (±3 days) every cycle (4 weeks). 
8. Fasting lipid and glucose will be done at Screening, and on Days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, and 169 (±3 days) in Cycle 1-6. For extension cycles, 
lipid profile and blood glucose are to be assessed every 3 cycles (12 weeks).  For subjects with abnormal lipid profiles, monthly testing is 
required in extension cycles. 
9. PSA will be processed in local lab. 
10. ECGs will be performed in triplicate at Screening, on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1 (Day 29) . Single ECGs are to be conducted on Day 
85, 169, and quarterly (every 3 month) during additional cycles. For any subject with abnormal or questionable ECG, monthly monitoring ECG 
is required. If there is reading error, artifacts or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_202820], triplicate readings with at least [ADDRESS_242048] result will take the average of 3 readouts. Protocol_Amendment 1_5.0_18 Mar 2021 | VV-TMF-14443057 | 1.0

Measurability of tumor at baseline 
Definitions 
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or non-measurable as 
follows: 
Measurable  
Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
 [ADDRESS_242054] scan (CT scan slice thickness no less than 5 mm for spi[INVESTIGATOR_31151]). 
 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable). 
Malignant lymph nodes: 
 To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be >/= [ADDRESS_242055] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be 
no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed. See also notes below on ‘Baseline documentation of target and non-target 
lesions’ for information on lymph node measurement. 
 
Non-measurable 
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph 
nodes with >/= 10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions 
considered truly non-measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial 
effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal Protocol_Amendment 1_5.0_18 Mar 2021 | VV-TMF-14443057 | 1.0

Special considerations regarding lesion measurability 
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular 
comment: 
Bone lesions: 
 Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions. 
 Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components 
that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783]-sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be 
considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of 
measurability described above. 
 Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable. 
Cystic lesions: 
 Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, 
by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
 ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-
cystic lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions. 
Lesions with prior local treatment: 
 Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion. Study protocols should detail the conditions 
under which such lesions would be considered measurable.

Confidential  Page 68 of 79  All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never 
more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
Method of assessment 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
Clinical lesions: 
 Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and >/= 10 
mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is 
suggested. As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_122989], imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may 
also be reviewed at the end of the study. 
CT, MRI: 
 CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected 
for response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_242056] in selected instances.  
Ultrasound: 
 Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method 
of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment 
to the next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], 
confirmation by [CONTACT_12154]. 
Endoscopy, laparoscopy: 
 The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised. 
However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies Protocol_Amendment 1_5.0_18 Mar 2021 | VV-TMF-14443057 | 1.0

response or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
Tumor markers: 
 Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must normalize for a subject to be 
considered in complete response. Because tumor markers are disease specific, 
instructions for their measurement should be incorporated into protocols on a disease 
specific basis. Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) 
and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer), have been published. In addition, the 
Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA125 progression criteria which are to 
be integrated with objective tumor assessment for use in first-line trials in ovarian cancer.  
Cytology, histology: 
 These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases if required 
by [CONTACT_990] (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where 
known residual benign tumors can remain). When effusions are known to be a potential 
adverse effect of treatment (e.g. with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis 
inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that 
appears or worsens during treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met 
criteria for response or stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable 
disease) and progressive disease. 
Tumor response evaluation 
Assessment of overall tumor burden and measurable disease 
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. Only subjects with 
measurable disease at baseline should be included in protocols where objective tumor response is 
the primary endpoint. Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_202864] (as detailed above). In studies where the primary endpoint is tumor progression (either 
time to progression or prostage with progression at a fixed date), the protocol must specify if 
entry is restricted to those with measurable disease or whether subjects having non-measurable 
disease only are also eligible.

Confidential  Page 70 of 79  When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs 
should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline (this means 
in instances where subjects have only one or two organ sites involved a maximum of two and 
four lesions respectively will be recorded).  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by [CONTACT_33490]. As noted in Section 3, pathological nodes 
which are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion 
of a short axis of >/= [ADDRESS_242057] in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI 
the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the 
short axis. For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm x 30 mm has a 
short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm 
should be recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis 
</= 10 mm but <15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis 
<10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed. 
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more details to follow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving 
the same organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g. ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph 
nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).

V5.0, 18 March 2021 
Confidential  Page 71 of 79  This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response 
for target lesions. 
Evaluation of target lesions 
 Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. 
 Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. 
 Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if 
that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or 
more new lesions is also considered progression). 
 Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
Special notes on the assessment of target lesions 
Lymph nodes. Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), 
even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nodes are 
included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria 
are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < [ADDRESS_242058] achieve a short 
axis <10 mm. For PR, SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be 
included in the sum of target lesions. 
Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’. While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-
nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent 
evaluation, even when very small (e.g. 2 mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes 
which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist 
may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being ‘too small to 
measure’. When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it 
is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the measurement should be 
recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be Protocol_Amendment 1_5.0_18 Mar 2021 | VV-TMF-14443057 | 1.0

should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is 
potentially non-reproducible, therefore providing this default value will prevent false responses 
or progressions based upon measurement error. To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to 
provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm. 
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment. When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest 
diameters of the fragmented stages should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. 
Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in 
obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly 
coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this 
instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’. 
Evaluation of non-target lesions 
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the 
group of non-target lesions. While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they 
need not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points 
specified in the protocol.  
 
 Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short 
axis). 
 Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
 Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of existing 
non-target lesions. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression). 
Special notes on assessment of progression of nontarget disease 
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires additional explanation as follows: 
When the subject also has measurable disease. In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal 
progression’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial Protocol_Amendment 1_5.0_18 Mar 2021 | VV-TMF-14443057 | 1.0

‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to quality for 
unequivocal progression status. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of 
change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely 
rare. 
When the subject has only non-measurable disease. This circumstance arises in some Phase [ADDRESS_242062] measurable disease. The same general 
concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is no measurable disease 
assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non-measurable disease burden. 
Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]: if all lesions 
are truly non-measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing subjects for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the 
change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be 
required to declare PD for measurable disease: i.e. an increase in tumor burden representing an 
additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a 
measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an 
increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in protocols 
as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the subject 
should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would be ideal to have 
objective criteria to apply to non-measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so, therefore the increase must be substantial. 
 
New lesions 
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal: i.e. not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ 
bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). This is particularly 
important when the subject’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For example, 
necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is 
not. 
A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is Protocol_Amendment 1_5.0_18 Mar 2021 | VV-TMF-14443057 | 1.0

V5.0, [ADDRESS_242063]’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence 
of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.  
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow-
up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is 
definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.  
While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to 
incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of 
progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging 
can be identified according to the following algorithm: 
 Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion. 
 No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up:  
 If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by 
[CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  
 If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-
PET scan). 
 If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT 
that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. Protocol_Amendment 1_5.0_18 Mar 2021 | VV-TMF-14443057 | 1.0

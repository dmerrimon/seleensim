Overview of Study Design  from Stud y 
Protocol :  
The aim of this study will be to compare 
cardiometabolic effects of TLE (8 -h eating 
period/16 -h of daily fasting) versus a prolonged 
eating period (12+h eating period) in  a 
randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_690930].   This study was a prospective, 
randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_9985] 50 
adolescents (ages 14 –18) with obesity (BMI% ≥ 
95th percentile) recruited from clinical programs 
at Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7723] (CHLA). 
Patients will be randomized to one of three 
treatment groups for a 12 -week intervention:  
Group 1): Control - Low sugar and carbohydrate 
educational intervention (LSC, < 5% of total daily 
calories from sugar/day; < 90 g carbohydrate 
(CHO)/day) + blinded CGM (used to monitor 
adherence and glycemic outcom es without real 
time feedback).  Group 2): LSC + TLE ([ADDRESS_937344]/8 -h feed for 5 days per week) + blinded CGM.  
 
The implementation steps of the proposed study  were  as follows: (1) The staff introduce d the study to all 
eligible participants either in person or  virtually and consent ed interested families for the study; (2) All participants 
and their families complete d a baseline study survey  in REDcap; (3) All participants were  trained to wear a 
blinded CGM  using manufacturer educational materials under the supervision of research staff. Participants be 
change d the CGM sensor every 14 days  for the duration of the study. During each study visit, the CGM reader 
was connected to the site database to create an i ndividual participant report. All equipment required for the 
duration of the study was distributed to the participants at consent . Participants receive d enough sensors to wear 
the CGM daily for the entire study period. (4) All participants and their famili es receive d standard nutritional 
counseling and were  randomized to one of t hree meal -timing schedules followed for 12 weeks: (1) Control or (2) 
TLE  blinded CGM use, and (3) TLE real -time CGM use . During the eating window, participants were not  required 
to count calories or monitor their food intake. Participants cho se and pa id for their own food during the 
intervention. All participants record ed their eating window daily and submit ted it to the study staff via REDcap. 
All participants receive d standard recommendations for physical activity, screen, and sleep time as per the 
American Academy of Pediatrics age -appropriate recommendations at the first visit;   (5) The study staff 
conduct ed study assessments with participants at week 0, 4, and 12; (6) The study staff perform ed weekly phone 
encounters with the participants to assess barriers to adherence  and eating practices . If a barrier is identified the 
study staff create d a solution plan to promote adherence and retention. The study staff record ed any medication 
changes or health issues that have occurred in the last 7 days . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_690931] ; (7) To further inform future trials and scalability 
we collected  continuously recruitment, consent, and retention rates, and barriers to engagement; (8) Adverse 
events were  monitored. If at any time, the study staff notice d any unhealthy compensatory behaviors the PI [INVESTIGATOR_690932],  and a treatment plan was created to ensure that the participant receive the appropriate screening, work -
up, and diagnosis from their primary care provider and are withdrawn from the study if appropriate. (9) The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_690933] -weekly to monitor all study procedures and oversee data ma nagement and analysis.  
 
Participants: We recruit ed 50 adolescents (age 14 -18 years at enrollment, all gender expressions) , with obesity . 
Inclusion criteria are: (1) age 14 -18 years; (2) Tanner stage III and above; (3) obesity ; (4) hemoglobin A1c < 
5.7%; (5) participant must be willing and able to adhere to the assessments, visit schedules, and eating/fasting 
periods; and (6) baseline eating window greater than 10 hours.  To limit confounding factors, individuals will be 
considered ineligible to participate if they meet any of the following exclusion criteria:  (1) diagnosis of Prader -
Willi Syndrome, brain tumor or hypothalamic obesity; (2) serious intellectual disability; (3) previous diagnosis or 
subthreshold symptoms of an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge -eating disorder); (4) 
parent/guardian -reported physical, mental of other inability to participate in the assessments; (5) previous Table 3: Study Procedures and Measures

participation in other interventional weight loss studies. A random block stratified randomi zation scheme was 
used. Participants were  randomized 1:1 via stratified, blocked randomization to ensure the groups were  balanced 
in terms of number of participants and distribution of potential confounding variables including sex and age.  
 
Retention stra tegies. To foster treatment adherence, participants receive d weekly calls from the study staff for 
the duration of the trial. Counseling was conducted by [CONTACT_7628]. The sessions  serve d three 
purposes: (1) foster adherence, retention, and accountability; (2) troubleshoot intervention barriers; and (3) 
monitor safety endpoints. To support participants, the staff will use behavioral techniques, such as stimulus 
control, goal setting, behav ioral contracting, and motivational interviewing.  In order to reduce participant burden, 
if at all possible study procedures will be scheduled to coincide with participants’ scheduled clinical visits.  
 
Intervention Arms:  
Components Common to All Study Arms . All participants receive d two hours of standard nutrition counseling 
recommended for adolescents living with  obesity . No specific caloric restriction was recommended. All 
participants maintain ed their usual lifestyle, including physical activit y and sleep patterns.  Physical activity and 
sleep recommendations consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for adolescents will be 
encouraged but not formally prescribed.   
 
Time Limited Eating . The TLE intervention arm involve d instru cting participants to consume their usual kind 
and amount of food and beverages (all calories) within a pre -specified [ADDRESS_937346] adolescents selected an afternoon/evening eating window for 
both week days and weekend days, consistent with their shifting sleep/wake cycle and timing of social 
engagements.14 Therefore, to align with the no rmal developmental eating patterns seen in adolescents, we 
assign ed an afternoon/evening TLE approach (consumption of all calories between 12:00 and 20:00  [plus or 
minus 1 hour]  seven days per week). Participants allowed to consume non -caloric beverages (w ater, tea, coffee) 
during the fasting period. No energy restriction was required.   
 
Control . Participants assigned to the control arm will be instructed to consume food over a 12 -hour or more 
eating window. They w ere free to divide their food and beverage intake into as many meals or snacks as desired 
during the 12-hour period. No energy restriction was required.  
 
Adherence Monitoring  and Intervention Fidelity : To ensure differentiation between the intervention arms a ll 
participants record ed the time they start,  and finish eating each day and provide their eating logs to the study 
staff weekly. Each week, study staff will  determine the daily eating window  for each participant by [CONTACT_690943]. These self -reported time windows will be verified 
by [CONTACT_690944] 24 -h CGM data.  If a participant adheres to meal timing 
protocol < 4 days/week, a follow -up call or videoconference will be scheduled  to address challenges , give 
participants additional encouragement, support, and create a specific plan  to promote adherence.  
 
Continuous Glucose Monitor . All participants will be trained to wear a blinded continuous glucose monitor 
sensor using manufactu rer educational materials under the supervision of research staff. Participants will be 
asked to wear the CGM for the duration of the study. During each study visit, the CGM reader will be connected 
to the site database to create an individual participant report. Participants will be provided enough sensors to 
replace the sensor every 1 4 days. The participants and guardians will be educated on how to use the CGM and 
receive 1:1 coaching on how to change the sensor, which will be completed either independently or under study 
team guidance. At each weekly phone meeting, study staff will monitor any challenges related to CGM wear, 
including partici pant discomfort, skin adherence, and other issues.  
 
Measurements : The study team will conduct all assessments at week 0, 4, and 12. All data was collected and 
stored in REDCap.  
 
Statistic al Analysis Plan:  
Primary Outcome —Feasibility  
Compliance with the recommended eating windows was collected from adolescents  during the weekly  phone 
calls with the study team. Adolescents were asked to record the  time they started and finished eating daily, the 
number of days they adhered to their prescribed  eating schedule, and barriers to adherence. Adolescents were 
instructed to wear  their CGM daily for the duration of the study and to report deviation from the p rotocol  during 
the phone calls . 
 
Secondary Outcome  
Anthropometrics. All participants received a wireless Bluetooth scale upon consent.  Participants’ height and 
weight were collected by [CONTACT_690945]/guardian at  home with the research coordinator monit oring 
the measurement collection via a HIPAA  compliant virtual platform. Height was measured using a portable wall 
height indicator  tape ruler, accurate to 0.5 cm (Posh Rulers, Quick Medical, Issaquah, WA). Weight was  
measured on a self -calibrating Etekcit y Digital Body Weight Scale, accurate to 0.2 kg  (Etekcity, San Diego, CA). 
Adolescents wore minimal clothing during the height and  weight measurements. BMI was calculated as 
kilograms per meter squared excess percent of the 95th p ercentile (%BMIp95) was determined utilizing  the CDC 
growth charts.  
 
Continuous Glucose Monitori ng 
CGM data were downloaded weekly by [CONTACT_3476]. CGM data were evaluated  continuously over the study 
period. This data was utilized to compute the following  measures: mean, maximum, and minimum glucose levels; 
standard deviation of glucose;  mean ampli tude of glycemic excursion; and overall percent of total time spent in 
euglycemic  range (percent time in range = 70 –180 mg/dL). All CGM data were housed in Clarity  (Dexcom and 
Dexcom CLARITY are registered trademarks of Dexcom, Inc., San Diego,  CA, [LOCATION_003]) and the study team had 
weekly access to assess all glycemic excursions that  occurred during the self -reported fasting periods [50 –53]. 
For those in the TLE + real -time 
 
Statistical Analysis  
The study was a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], thus we opted for a convenient sample size of 50 participants  to estimate parameters 
for a larger, fully powered trial. Analyses  were based on the intention to treat (ITT) population using the last 
observation carried  forward. The ITT population was defined as at least tw o visits (baseline and 1 month).  The 
study was designed as a three -group intervention analysis; however, given that very  few adolescents in the TLE+ 
real-time CGM feedback group looked at their real -time data,  we completed a post hoc analysis combining bot h 
TLE groups compared to control for all  analyses performed.  Baseline characteristics (age, sex, race, BMI status, 
household income) were summarized  descriptively across arms for the ITT population using mean and standard 
deviation  (SD) or median and inter quartile range as appropriate for the distribution of continuous  variables. 
Categorical variables are described as a frequency and percentage. Continuous  variables that are skewed were 
analyzed in log scale. The differences in demographics,  anthropometrics  baseline, and eating window 
distributions among intervention groups  were examined using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher’s Exact 
test. Adherence  was operationalized as the number of days adolescents complied with their prescribed  eating 
window, num ber of days they wore their CGM, and number of weekly phone calls  and scheduled research visits 
they attended, and satisfaction scores were summarized using  mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and 
maximum score between TLE and control.  The TLE effect on mean change of %BMIp95 between week [ADDRESS_937347] on the change in quality - of-life assessment, where the scores are 
reported in percentages, with no data below 0  or above 100. Then, the non -additive effects of TLE were also 
examined; specifically,  whether the change on clinical outcomes during the study period varied by [CONTACT_690946] -effect models. In addition, sensitivity  analysis was 
performed to examine whether the weight change o bserved in the data  was influenced by  [CONTACT_690947] a weight loss of greater than 15% from  baseline weight. All results are described in beta estimate, β, 
percent change, and odds  ratio with its associated 95% confidence interval and p -value.  The statistical 
significance  level was set at 0.05 with two -sided throughout the analyses. All statistical computations  were done 
in Stata/SE 17.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, [LOCATION_003]).

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY   
This research is being done to find the effectiveness of a diet plan (Time Limited Eating or TLE) in adolescents 
with obesity.  
 
NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS  
Up to [ADDRESS_937349] 16 weeks with up to 5 in -person study visits at CHLA.  
 
PROCEDURES  
If you volunteer to be in this study, we will ask you to do the following things:  
 
You will be randomized into 1 of 3 groups below. A computer program will randomly (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin) 
assign you to one of the following groups after 1 week of wearing a continuous glucose monitor (CGM):  
 
o Group 1: Non -TLE (Non Time Limited Eating) - 12-hour or more eating window without 
mealtime restrictions  
o Group 2: TLE (Time Limited Eating) – 8-hour eating window 7 days per week  + blinded 
continuous glucose monitor data  
o Group 3: TLE (Time Limited Eating) – 8-hour eating window 7 days per week + real -time 
continuous glucose monitor data  
During the research study you will be asked to do the following things (each of these items is specific for the 
research study and not considered standard of care for your condition):  
 
▪ Follow the dietary guidelines provided to you by [CONTACT_3476]:  
o TLE (Group 2 only):  only eat during an 8 -hour window i.e.  11 AM – 7 PM 7 days per week.  
▪ Continuous glucose monitor ( all groups): You will wear a continuous glucose monitor called the Dexcom 
G6 Mobile CGM system  every day to monitor your blood sugar level. The study t eam will create a Dexcom 
research account on your behalf using a research email. The study team will review your blood sugar levels 
with you over the phone each week. We will provide you with the device to use for 12 weeks. You will be 
trained on the use o f this device. The Dexcom app will be downloaded to your or family member’s 
personal smart phone . If you, your parent, legal guardian family member does not own a Dexcom 
compatible smart phone, you will use the Dexcom receiver. Please see appendix B for in formation about 
this device.  
▪ Phone Follow Up (both groups): A member of the research team will call you once a week to discuss any 
barriers you may be experiencing. These conversations will be audio -recorded for educational purposes 
and should last approx imately 15 -30 minutes. A code name [CONTACT_690957].  
▪ Follow -up plan (both groups): At the end of the intervention, your participation in this study will be 
complete.  
 
In addition to the above, the following research p rocedures will be done to all subjects in both groups through 
the end of the study:  
▪ Weight and height checks: At every visit, we will weigh you and measure your height. This will be done in 
a private area.  
▪ Surveys: You will complete several surveys at ever y visit. These surveys collect information such as your 
eating behaviors, how well you cope with stress, and satisfaction with the intervention. Each survey will 
take approximately [ADDRESS_937350] the option of completing the survey s virtually 
via WebEx or over the phone.  
▪ Dietary Recall: You will complete a dietary recall of all the food and beverages you consumed over 2 days 
(48 hours) prior to the day of the visit. This will take approximately [ADDRESS_937351] at your in -person visits or virtually via WebEx or over the 
phone. Daily Eating Log: You will complete eating logs every day. These logs will collect the time you 
started eating and the time you stoppe d eating each day for [ADDRESS_937352] your logs once a week.  
▪ Medical record review: If you are a patient at CHLA,  as part of your regular care, you  may  have blood work 
done every year to evaluate for your health. We will  review your medical record and collect the results of 
your blood work if they occurred in the last 8 weeks from the consent date.  
▪ Research blood draws (fasting blood tests are considered standard of care at baseline for anyone 
entering into a weight manag ement program): Approximately 9 mL (2 teaspoon) of blood will be collected 
by [CONTACT_690949] a needle in a vein of your arm for each blood draw. You will have to fast (not eat anything for at 
least 6 hours) before each blood draw. Blood draws will occur at visit 1 and 5.  
▪ Research images (during Onboarding [visit 1] and at day 84 [Visit 5]):  
o DEXA scan: this will take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_690936] 30 minutes to obtain the image.  
 
FOR YOUR PARENT/GUARDIAN OR OTHER FAMILY MEMBER  
Your participation is optional if your child is over the age of 18 years.  
▪ Surveys : Your family member will be asked to complete several surveys. These surveys will collect 
information such as age, job, health insurance, and ethnicity. Each survey will tak e about 5 -10 minutes to 
complete. Your parent/legal guardian or family member will spend approximately [ADDRESS_937353] the option to complete at in person visits or virtually via WebEx or over the phone.  
▪ Weight and Height : Your f amily members’ height and weight will be measured.  
 
Your family member will need to travel to CHLA with you for your in -person study visits and/or to complete in 
person study procedures.  
 
RESULTS OF TESTS PERFORMED FOR THE STUDY  
The results of the follow ing research tests and research information will be shared with you and your doctor 
upon request:  
• Lab Testing : hemoglobin A1c, glucose level, liver function tests (AST&ALT), insulin, lipid panel, c -
reactive protein (CRP), c -peptide, Insulin -Like Growth Fa ctor (IGF -1). 
• Research image studies – DEXA scans  
• Weight trends over the study period  
 
Any abnormal lab test results from this study will be sent to your doctor as they may be important to your 
safety.   
 
POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
Surveys: You may fe el uncomfortable answering some of the questions. You can choose to skip or stop 
answering questions at any time. Surveys that will be completed by [CONTACT_690950]. If you report extreme anxiety, binge eating dis order, or depression, we will refer you 
to a healthcare provider for immediate evaluation and a referral for mental health services if appropriate. This 
may result in additional costs to you if you require additional procedures, tests and/or treatments as 
determined by [CONTACT_690951].  
 
Research blood draws: Having blood taken may cause pain, swelling, bruising, redness, and/or minor bleeding 
at the site of the needle stick. In rare cases, an infection or small blood clot may happen.  
 
Imaging:  
Risk associated with DEXA : You will be exposed to a small amount of radiation during your DEXA scan 
(radiation dose of 0.001 mSv) which is equivalent to [ADDRESS_937354] round trip airline flight which is about 0.03 mSv and poses minimal risk.  
Unexpected (incidental) Findings : It is possible that unexpected findings may be discovered from the 
research DEXA or MRI which you may find upsetting. You will be notified by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_690937]. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_690938] -up with your physician. These 
findings may result in the need for you to have additiona l procedures, testing, and/or treatments as 
determined by [CONTACT_29591]. This may result in additional costs to you and/or your health insurance.  
 
Time Limited Eating: There are risks and discomforts associated with calorie restricted diet, such as hunger , 
anxiety, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, low blood pressure and, in rare cases, 
fainting. These diet interventions may also cause abnormal heart rhythms, short -term nutrient deficiency, and 
a weakened immune response.  
 
Continuous  Glucose Monitor: While wearing the Continuous Glucose Monitor, you are at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_690939], bleeding, or burning at the insertion site. In rare cases, an infection may develop.  
 
Psychological risks: It is possible that you may become upset thinki ng about some of the questions or topi[INVESTIGATOR_690940].   
 
Bullying or violence: If we suspect that you are a victim of bullying or violence at home or in your 
neighborhood, either through completion of the questionnaires, we will implement the following pr ocedures: 
1) we will make you are aware of resources available in your community; 2) we will work with you to develop 
a safety plan for addressing bullying or violence; 3) we will ascertain the risk to you. If we suspect that you 
have been abused or witnes sed domestic violence, we will make a report to child protective services. 
Children/adolescents who are victims of bullying or domestic violence will not be dropped from the study, 
unless they ask to drop out.  
 
Suicidal Behavior: If we suspect that you ar e suicidal, we will follow the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration SAFE -T: Suicide Assessment Five -Step Evaluation and Triage approach to determining 
risk and clinical response. The five steps are Identify Risk Factors, Identify Prote ctive Factors, Conduct Suicide 
Inquiry, Determine Risk Level/Intervention, and Document (which includes intervention and follow -up).  
Adolescents who experience psychiatric emergencies such as suicidal behavior will not be dropped from the 
study, unless th ey request to terminate their participation.   
 
Binge Eating Behavior : If we suspect that you are developi[INVESTIGATOR_690941] a research staff during a weekly phone meeting, we will 
implement the following procedure: (1) we will make you aware of resources available in your community, (2) 
we will encourage you to contact [CONTACT_690952], (3) we w ill ascertain risk to you and (4) the PI [INVESTIGATOR_690942]. If we suspect that you 
are purging or placing yourself in immediate medical danger, we will conta ct your parent or guardian and 
instruct you to go the local emergency room for evaluation.  
 
Privacy Risks (for both youth and the parent/legal guardian/family member subjects) : As this study involves 
the use of your identifiable, personal information, ther e is a chance that a loss of confidentiality may occur. 
The researchers have procedures in place to lessen the possibility of this happening (see the CONFIDENTIALITY 
section below for details).  
 
There may be additional risks to participation in this resear ch that we do not know about and therefore 
cannot describe.

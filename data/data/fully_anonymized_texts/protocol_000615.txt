2 PRÉCIS  
Background : 
• Interleukin -15 (IL -15) is a stimulatory cytokine with a number of desirable 
immunotherapeutic features , and clinical trials evaluating recombinant human (rh) IL -[ADDRESS_911622].  
• In cont rast to IL -2, IL -15 treatment does not stimulate activation -induced cell death of T -
cells; potentially inhibits immunosuppressive CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells , contributes 
to the proliferation, differentiation and activation of CD8+ T-cells and NK -cells and the 
maintenance of long -term CD8+ mem ory T -cells.  
• IL-15 is active in a number of syngeneic mouse preclinical tumor models , and vaccinia -
based constructs expressing IL-15 induced long -lasting, high -avidity cytotoxic CD8+ T-
lymphocyte response that appears to be more effective than similar IL -2–expressing 
vaccines.  
• Pharmacology/t oxicology (pharm/tox) experiments in non -human primate (NHP) rhesus 
macaques and preliminary results from the first -in-human phase I trial examining rhIL -15 
given as an IV bolus (IVB) for 12 consecutive days indicate si gnificant stimulation and 
expansion of NK -cells and CD8+ T-cells.  
• rhIL-15 given as an IVB at 1 mcg/kg dose level appears to be well tolerated despi[INVESTIGATOR_674582] -related side effects  indicating that 0.1  mcg/kg/day is 
an appropriat e initial dose level for a phase  I safety trial of continuous intravenous 
infusion (CIV) of rhIL-15.  
• Comparison of the p harmacokinetic and immunologic assessments from the IVB phase I 
trial with the data from  both sets of NHP pharm/tox experiments suggest  that CIV  of 
rhIL-[ADDRESS_911623] greater potential for stimulating an anticancer cellular immune 
response with a more manageable safety profile . 
Objective:  
• Determine the safety, toxicity profile, dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) o f rhIL -15 administered as a CIV for 10 consecutive days (240 
hours)  or for 5 days  (120 hours)  in subjects with metastatic unresectable cancers for 
which curative or palliative measures either do not exist or are not associated with a 
survival advantage.  
Eligibility Criteria:  
• Patients ≥18 years -old, ECOG PS ≤ [ADDRESS_911624] or are 
not associated with a survival advantage.  
• Patients with measurable o r evaluable disease , normal organ and bone marrow function  
Design:    
• This is a single -institution, open -label, non -randomized 3 + 3 design phase I dose -
escalation study.  
• Groups of 3 to 6 subjects will receive CIV rhIL -15 at doses of 0.1, 0. 25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 
mcg/kg/day for 10 days provided that DLT ha s not been observed.

3 • After  assessments of the 10-day dosing cohorts have  been completed, new groups of 3 to 
6 subjects will receive CIVrhIL -15 at doses of 3, 4 and 5 mcg/kg/day for 5 days provided 
that a DLT has not been observed.  
• Patients with evidence of response and the absence of significant toxicities will be 
eligible for repeat cycles of treatment.  
• Samples for c orrelative studies will be obtained prior to treatment and at specific times 
points during  and after treatment to assess pharmacokinetics of rhIL -15, the effect of 
rhIL-15 on immune cell subset populations and pro -inflammatory cytokine levels in the 
peripheral blood and for the development of neutralizing anti -rhIL-15 antibodies .

7 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1.1 Primary Objective  
• Determine the safety, toxicity profile, dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) , and maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) of recombinant human interleukin -15 (rhIL -15) administered as a 
continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) for 10 consecutive days  (240 hours)  or for 5 days 
(120 hours)  in subjects with met astatic unresectable cancers for which curative or 
palliative measures either do not exist or are not associated with a survival advantage.  
1.1.2 Secondary Objectives  
• Determin e rhIL-15 pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and the biological effects of rhIL -15 on 
immune cells r eflected in the changes in the percentages and absolute numbers of 
circulating lymphocytes (T and NK cells)  and T cell subsets (naïve, central or effector 
memory subsets) based on flow cytometric analysis of CD56, CD3, CD4, CD8, 
CD45RO, CD45RA , CD28 , CD95,  CCR7 and CD62L expression and on the plasma 
levels of pro -inflammatory cytokines . 
• Evaluate the potential antitumor activity of rhIL -15 by [CONTACT_674618].  
• Assess the nature of the T-cell infiltration and cytokine and check -point inhibitor gene 
expression by [CONTACT_674619] - and post -treatment biopsies obtained from selected patients 
with easily accessible tumor deposits.  
1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.2.1 Interleukin -15 (IL -15)  
The cytokine that is now called interleukin -15 was initially reported nearly simultaneously by 
[CONTACT_674620], one at the NCI and the other at Immunex Corporation (1, 2). Since 
this discovery, IL -15 has been and remains one of the key focuses of the Waldmann laboratory’s 
research efforts. While not the exclusive proprietor of all the important publications regarding 
the biology of IL -15, many subsequent reports from this laboratory have described a number of 
key biologic features and therapeutic potential of IL -15 (3-9). The clinical application of the 
laborat ory effort that  defined IL -15’s immunologic role and pathophysiologic contribution to 
human T -cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV -1)–related diseases and T -cell large granular 
lymphocyte leukemia (LGL) first le d to clinical investigations with the anti -IL-15Rβ  chain 
antibody Mikβ1 (10, 11) that still continue. More recently , the long -awaited first -in-human phase 
I trial evaluating rhIL -15 as an immunotherapeutic was initiated. This trial is examining the 
safety and efficacy of rhIL -15 given as an IV bolus to patients with advanced incurable 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma and melanoma and soon will be followed by [CONTACT_674621].  
Interleukin -15 is produced primarily by [CONTACT_488] -presenting cells (APCs) like dendritic cells 
(DCs) but also by [CONTACT_674622] -stranded RNA, 
viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens and also type 1 interferons (IFNs) (12-15). While 
constitutive IL -[ADDRESS_911626] is rather 
unique. IL -15 is bound with high affini ty by [CONTACT_24977] -15Rα chain , which can be membrane bound 

Abbreviated Title:  Ph I Study of CIV rhIL -15 
Version Date:  06/13 /[ADDRESS_911627] often is with IL -15Rα on the cell surface of APCs and presented in trans to nearby 
[CONTACT_20411] T and NK cells (16, 17). Interleukin -15 has a heterotrimeric receptor (IL -15R) composed 
of a unique alpha subunit ( IL-15Rα chain), a beta subunit that it shares with IL -2 (IL -2R/IL -
15Rβ chain) and the common gamma -chain γc) that is also present on the receptors for 
cytokines IL -4, IL -7, IL -9 and IL -21 (18-20). While IL -[ADDRESS_911628] a number of other 
similarities as activators of NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ effector T -cells, there are some important 
biologic features distinctiv e to each of these cytokines.  In contrast to IL -2, IL -15 does not cause 
activation -induced cell death (AICD ), and seemingly has greater capacity to maintain high -
avidity CD8+ memory T -cell responses to invading pathogens by [CONTACT_674623] 
T-cells (6, 21-23). In addition to pro moting the global CD8+ response (24), IL-[ADDRESS_911629] active CD8+, CD95+, CCR7-, CD28- effector memory cells, and increases their 
T-cell receptor  avidity by [CONTACT_674624]8αβ , which as expected augments 
these cells ’ functional capacity (25). Administration of IL -15 has also been show n to upregulate 
IL-15Rα expression , which allows the effector cells to respond to lower local concentrations of 
IL-15 that resulted in increased production of secondary stimulatory cyto kines such as IFNγ  and 
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and increased production of lytic molecules such as perforin 
(26, 27). 
In addition to IL -15’s well -described effects on cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells and NK cells, a number 
of recent publications have demonstrated that IL -15 promotes CD4+ cellular responses more than 
originally recognized (28-30). Again, the effects are more prevalent in the effector memory 
subset; but more importantly , IL-15 provides  limited stimulation of immunosuppressive  CD4+ T 
regulatory cells (T r egs). IL-2 is clearly a potent stimulator of CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ T-cells, and 
some reports have demonstrated that IL -15 can inhibit T regs  function (31). As research 
continued into the relationship of IL -15 and T regs , it became cl ear that the biology is complex 
(32-35). The data regarding the effects of IL -15 on T regs  is conflicting with some reports 
demonstrating th at IL -15 suppresses T reg function (34, 35). It is clear that IL -15 can stimulate T 
regs directly or indirectly ; the specif ic milieu and associated cells have important contributions 
in determining IL -15’s impact  on the nearby T regs . While IL -15 effects on these 
immunosuppressive cells are again pleotropic, at a minimum , the data indicate IL -15 has inferior 
capacity to stimul ate T regs  compared to IL -2 (31-33).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Interleukin -[ADDRESS_911630] been tested, but IL -2 remains the 
prototypic agent and a central feature of many effective immunotherapy strategies (36, 37). 
While IL -2 has advantageous features shown to contribute to the in vivo  anti-tumor immune 
response, the less desirable consequences of high -dose IL -2 (HD IL -2) treatment such as 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_674583], hypotension, and the previously cited roles in AICD and 
stimulation of immunosuppressive T regs  must be recognized. Like IL -2, IL -15 has been 
shown in many model systems to be a potent stimulator of T and NK cell functions, but IL -
15 lacks a number of IL-2’s negative characteristics and suggests that IL -15 has greater 
clinical potential as an immunotherapeutic in oncology (38, 39).  
Preclinical experiments indicate that IL -15 is superior to IL -2 in the maintenance of NK 
cells, NK -T cells, intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_674584]8+ T-cells (1-5). 
The antitumor effect of IL -2 probably results from its ability to expand lymphocyte 

Abbreviated Title:  Ph I Study of CIV rhIL -15 
Version Date:  06/13 /2018  
9 populations in vivo  and to increase the effector functio ns of these cells , thereby [CONTACT_674625]. The ongoing cellular therapy effort pi[INVESTIGATOR_674585] (TILs) and chimeric antigen receptor T -cells (CARs) (37, 40) 
and the recently published randomized phase III gp100 peptide vaccine trial (41) have 
demonstrated clinical efficacy for combination treatments with HD IL -2. Although 
numerous individual reports have listed positive clinical results from less intensive IL -2 
regimens, published results from the limited number of comparative trials indicate the HD 
three times daily (tid) dosing regimen is the most consistently ac tive IL -2 treatment (42, 43). 
In composite, the current data suggest higher doses of IL-[ADDRESS_911631] new rh 
cytokines being examined in clinical trials are not given as dose -intense inpatient regimens 
(44, 45). Biologically , we now understand better the limits of stimulation of HD IL -2 on 
effector T -cells (AICD, T regs ) (12, 34, 38) and NK cel ls as well as the ability of patients to 
tolerate prolonged IL -2 treatment  (36). The current development plan for IL -15 given at an 
active but not intensive dose coincides with the philosophic shift to less toxic regimens for 
new immunotherapeutics being evaluated in clinical trials (44-46). Analogous to the 
investigation into IL -15, a number of new immunotherapeutic agents identified by [CONTACT_674626] a productive immune response are directed at homeostatic or 
counter -regulatory cellular processes like CTLA4, PD1, indoleamin e 2,3 -dioxygenase and 
immunosuppressive T regs  or macrophage -derived suppressor cells (MDSC) that are 
induced sometimes indirectly by [CONTACT_8668]-2 treatment (33, 46-51). IL-15’s considerable ability to 
activate crucial effector T -cells and NK -cells, its inhibition of AICD, the lack of a 
meaningful contribution to the generation of T regs , potential for cyclic r estimulation of 
effector cells and its unique capacity to maintain the func tion of CD8+ memory T -cells; 
indicate that IL -15 has greater potential than IL -2 as a cancer immunotherapeutic.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Interleukin -[ADDRESS_911632] proven  effective 
(7, 14, 52). The importance of IL -15 in the elimination of syngeneic MC38 colon  carcinoma 
has been examined using IL -15 transgenic mice that produce large quantities of IL -15. 
Wild -type C57Bl/6 mice died due to substantial pulmonary involvement by 40 days after 
infusio n of the MC38 carcinoma cells, but similarly exposed IL -15 transgenic mice did not 
develop such metastases and survived.  The role of IL -15Rα -mediated transpresentation in 
the therapeutic action of IL -15 was evaluated in a related model when the IL -15Rα 
expression element was transfected into MC38 colon carcinoma cells.  The administration of 
unmodified MC38 cells to wild -type mice led to death within 40 days, whereas mice with 
normal IL -15 production given IL -15Rα–transfected tumor cells did not develop tumo rs 
(53). In this system, IL -15Rα on the surface of tumor cells bound circulating IL -[ADDRESS_911633] -26 colon carcinoma cells.  Klebanoff and coworkers (7) also showed that IL -
15 enhanced the in vivo  activity of tumor reactive CD8+ T-cells in the T -cell receptor 
transgenic mouse (Pmel -1) whose CD8+ T-cells recognize an epi[INVESTIGATOR_674586]100 and stimulated the in vivo  antitumor activity of these T -cells in a 
B16 melanoma model.  The synergy of IL -21 and IL -15 in stimulating CD8+ T-cell 
expansion and functional capacity also produced apparent cures of established large B16  

Abbreviated Title:  Ph I Study of CIV rhIL -15 
Version Date:  06/13 /2018  
10 melanomas (52). In addition, the IL -[ADDRESS_911634] over untreated controls.  Systemic IL -15 given in 
combination with a fowlpox TRICOM vaccine encoding B7-1, ICAM -1, and LFA -3 
improved survival in a mouse subcapsular renal cell cancer model compared to TRICOM 
vaccination alone or TRICOM plus systemic IL -2 (54).  
IL-15 has also been shown to promote anti -viral T -cell responses. Vaccinia vectors co -
expressing IL -15 and an HIV antigen gly coprotein 160 (gp 160) induced long -lasting robust 
cytotoxic T -lymphocyte  (CTL ) response in contrast to the short -lived T -cell immunity from 
a vector expressing IL -2. Administration of DNA vaccines containing an optimized plasmid 
encoding IL -15 improved th e function and longevity of CD8+ T-cell response to influenza 
virus hema gglutinin protein (24). IL-15 was shown to increase long -lived antigen specific 
memory CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in rhesus macaques (29, 55-57), and to  increase effector 
memory CD8+ T-cells and NK -cells in Simian immunodeficient virus (SIV) –infected 
macaques (29). In this study, recombinant rhesus macaque (rm ) IL-15 treatment in 9 
SIVmac 251 –infected cynomolgus monke ys was given twice weekly for 4 weeks at a low 
dose of 10 mcg/kg  and a high dose 100 mcg/kg. Compared to saline controls, rmIL -15 
treatment induced a nearly three -fold increase in peripheral CD8+CD3- NK cells.  
Furthermore, CD8+ T-cell numbers increased mor e than two -fold mainly due to an increase 
in CD45RA- , CD62L-, and CD45RA+ CD62L- effector memory CD8+ T-cells.   
To support this proposal, the Lymphoid Malignancies  Branch has recently performed 
additional murine experiments to assess the potential of CIV IL -15 (Zhang and Waldmann 
unpublished) using an analogous subcutaneous (SC) minipump  system. Protocol mice were 
infused intraperitoneally (IP) with MC -38 tumor cells and IP injection  or SC minipump 
treatment of the 5 experimental groups were  initiated 1 day later.  The 5 treatment groups 
included a  phosphate buffered saline ( PB5) control, human IL -15 at 5 mcg/day IP for 14 
days (5 x 14), human IL -15 at 2.5 mcg/day  IP fo r 14 days (2.5 x 14), human IL -15 at 5 mcg 
given every  other day IP over 14 days for 7 doses (5 x 7) and human IL -15 via an implanted 
pump (2.5 mcg/day) fo r 14 days  that demonstrated more favorable pharmacokinetics for 2.5 
mcg/day infusion pump route of ad ministration with sustained serum IL -15 levels in 3500 to 
8000 pg/mL range in comparison for short high exposures (> 30, 000 pg/mL) for the daily 
IP injections .  
Increase s in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) w ere seen in the groups receiving rhIL-15 
and nea rly identical  absolute number s of CD8+ lymphocytes w ere seen in  animals receiving 
2.5 mcg/day via the pump a s those receiving 5 mcg/day as an IP injection ( Figure 1, top 
figure ). All treatment regimens produced s imilar increases in the percentage of NK cells, but 
increases in the percentage of CD8+ and CD44hi CD8+ terminal effector cells were highest in 
the animals treated via the pump at 2.5 mcg/day.  It is also important to note that IL -[ADDRESS_911635] majority of the CD8+ cells to become  CD44hi activated effector 
cells. These data suggest that continuous administration of IL -15 as oppos ed to bolus dosing 
stimulate s different populations of lymphocytes and may be a better dosing schedule to 
stimulate a T -cell or CD8+ cells response  that also includes a slower decline  CD8+ cell 
numbers after the cytokine treatment has been stopped compared  to animals treated with a 
daily IP injection.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Results from Non-Human Primate (NHP) Toxicology Studies  
The Lymphoid Malignancies Branch had previously performed a toxicology study in NHP 

Abbreviated Title:  Ph I Study of CIV rhIL -15 
Version Date:  06/13 /2018  
11 in support of the  IND application for the ongoing  IVB clinical protoc ol (56, 57). In this 
toxicology study, 24 ad ult rhesus macaques were divided  into 4 treatment groups of 6 
animals  each. The groups of monkeys received vehicle diluent control alone, or rhIL -15 at 
10, 20 or 50 mcg/kg /day IVB daily for [ADDRESS_911636] s that included  hematology, 
serum chemistries, coagulation studies, PK analysis of serum rhIL -15, immunologic 
parameters , a survey of autoimmune markers and a complete necropsy with gross and 
histopathological examination. After 8 days of treatment , the animal receiving 200 
mcg/kg /day and to a lesser degree those animals receiving 50 mcg/kg /day exhibited 
lethargy, a disheveled appearance, diarrhea an d dehydrat ion that in some cases required IV  
fluid s. Laborator y results from  this time period showed t ransient grade 3/ 4 granulocytopenia 
in the rhesus macaques receiving rhIL -15 at a dose of 50 m cg/kg/day, but no infections were 
seen and concurrent b one marrow samp les (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_12752] ) showed a hypercellular 
marrow containing all elements of the granulocytes series.  Histologic examination of t he 
macaques’ livers demonstrated granu locytes and other leukocytes in the sinusoids adjacent 
to normal appeari ng hepatocy tes suggesting that redistribution  to the tissues as a 
contributing factor in the apparent  neutropenia.  Normal or elevated granulocyte counts were 
restored within [ADDRESS_911637] rhIL -15 were d etected in the animals , and no animals developed anti-nuclear 
antibodies (ANA) . At necropsy, the only gross or microscopic abno rmalities were loss of

blood cells  (WBCs)  in the liver sinusoids.  No animal deaths occurred on this study.  
To support a NIAID -planned sponsored clinical trial, a similar toxicolog y study was 
performed to evaluate the effects of CIV treatment and more frequent administration of SC 
rhIL-15 to rhesus m acaques .  Fifteen male macaques were divided into 5 groups of animals 
and were treated with  either  CIV or SC rhIL -15 as shown below in Table 1 with one group 
of animals receiving vehicle alone serving as the control . The SC rhIL -15 was administered 
either on a twice weekly schedule for 2 weeks or f or 10 consecutive days , and the CIV 
dosing was  also given continuous ly for 10 days. In the initial phase of the study animal s 
receiving CIV IL-15 were subdivided into two groups (groups 2 and 3) to eva luate 
responses to different  preparations of rhIL-15 distinguished by [CONTACT_674627] (identified as high -D and l ow-D forms).  Initially the plan was for two treatment 
cycles separated by [CONTACT_1629] [ADDRESS_911638] 
biochemical and hematologic laboratory tests and several immunologic parameters  similar 
to the previous IVB NHP study . The tests also  included monitoring serum IL-15 PK, 
production of secondary cytokines in animal s receiving CIV rh IL-15, development of 
antibodies to IL -15, and changes in lymphocyte subsets by [CONTACT_4133].

during the first [ADDRESS_911640] but 
appearing to resolve completely by [CONTACT_4475] 13 or 14.  These findings correlated with changes in 
the clinical chemistries that yielded treatment -related abnormal res ults includ ing elevated 
mean serum  alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate ami notransferase (AST), 
decreased albumin, total protein and calcium concentrations in animals given eit her 20 
mcg/kg high -D or low -D CIV  in the day  [ADDRESS_911641] lik ely related 
to terminal events. Because of the findings in the small bowel, intussusception was 
considered as a possible cause of this animal’s death, but this was not seen at the initial 
examination of the animal ’s abdominal cavity . Ultimately, no clear c ause of death was 
identified in this animal based on the gross and microscopic results.  
There was no consistent difference noted in the immune activation or lymphocytosis 
produced by [CONTACT_674628] D rhIL -15 preparations. Compared to the lymphocytosis 
noted in the NHP IVB toxicology study, the increase in WBCs and ALC noted in the groups 
(high D and low D  combined  in graphs ) receiving the 20 mcg/kg CIV dose represented is a 
striking ( Figure 1) with ALC showing 20 -fold expansion from baseline by [CONTACT_253898] 10 time

substantially present through day [ADDRESS_911642] increases in CD4+ cells, substantial increases in (CD3- CD16+) NK

Extensive PK was not performed in the animals receiving CIV rhIL -15, with only single 
time points on days  2 and 10 of infusion assessed.  IL-15 levels reached the low ng/m L level 
on day 2 and ranged from 2.1 to approximately 6.3 n g/mL . Day 10 values during cours e 1 
were generall y lower.  During subsequent cours es the peak values observed were also in the 
ng/m L range , and in some animals , the day 10 values were higher than on day 2 ( Figure 3). 
Day 17 an d 24 samples ([ADDRESS_911643] day of infusion) had no detectable human 
IL-15 in t he serum. The greater than 20-fold expansion of IL-15–responsive cells 
(presumably IL -15 receptor –positive cells ) might contribute to the decrease in free 
circulating rhIL -15 measured at the day 10 time point, but the dif ferences in IL -15 PK 
during cours e 2 as well as decreased cours e 2 and 3 leukocytosis are not yet explained and 
remain under investigation. Preclinical testing of rh cytokines in NHP provides valuable 
preclinical information for clinical trials ; species differences will occasionally cause

An important cause of the PK and stimulation differences to be eliminated was the

[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Experience from the Completed IV Bolus Phase I Study 
The first in -human (FIH) trial that tested a daily 30 -minute infusion (IVB) for 12 days in 
subjects with metastatic melanoma and renal cell cancer has been completed after treating 
18 subjects (58). Doses assessed in this tri al were 3, 1 and 0.3 µg/kg ; with the 0.3 µg/kg 
dose determined to be the MTD for this schedule. DLTs at the 3 µg/kg dose were grade 3 
hypotension and grade 3 thrombocytopenia; DLTs at the 1 µg/kg dose were grade 3 
elevations of transaminases. One Serious Adverse Event (SAE) grade [ADDRESS_911648]’s second cycle of treatment.  
The frequency and severity of common cytokine related toxicities such as fever, rigors, 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_674587] w ere generally proportional to the dose of rhIL -15.  
Abnormal laboratory results were seen in all subjects and most often were CTC grade 1 or 2 
events. Laboratory adverse events (AEs) were less clearly proportional to the dose of rhIL -
15 both in frequency a nd severity as indicated by [CONTACT_674629] 2 
laboratory AEs in the 3 µg/kg cohort, whereas both DLTs in the 1 µg/kg dosing cohort were 
elevated AST/ALT. The 0.3 µg/kg dosing cohort also had a high frequency of laboratory 
abnormalitie s including non -DLT grade 3 elevation of ALT/AST in one patient. There was a 
consistent temporal pattern of post -treatment AEs most clearly seen in 3 µg/kg cohort with 
fever beginning approximately [ADDRESS_911649] immediately by [CONTACT_674630] (BP) . 
A similar but less severe set of post treatment toxicities were seen in the 1 µg/kg subjects 
with chills rather than rigors, less significant increase s in temperature , but no appreciable 
BP changes . There was a very low frequency or absence of these post infusional events in 
the 0.3 µg/kg dosing cohort.  Serial analyses of inflammatory cytokine levels (IL -1β, IL -6, 
IL-8, IL -10 and TNFα) showed marked increases in serum levels of these inflammatory 
cytokines that coincided with these clinical toxicities and was most closely matched with the 
IL-6 levels. As predicted by [CONTACT_674631] T -cells and NK cells, but the increase in 
lymphocytes was statistically significant only for the group that received the 3 µg/kg dose 
that produced a 10 -fold increase in NK cells, a more than 3 -fold increase in T -cells mostly 
due to expansion of the terminally differentiated (memor y and effector memory) CD8+ cells. 
The half -life (t ½) was approximately 2 1/2 hours with Cmax 47,800, 15,900 and 1260 
pg/mL respectively for the [ADDRESS_911650] response.  However,  5 sub jects manifested a decrease between 10 and 30% 
in their marker lesions, with 2 of these subjects having improvement or clearance of some 
lung lesions.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Previous Clinical Experience for Patients treated in this Protocol  
Twenty -five patients have been enroll ed and treated in this protocol. Patients [ADDRESS_911651] 3 dose levels (0.1 mcg/kg, 0.25 mcg/kg and 0.5 mcg/kg) and had no DLTs 
or significant toxicities.  
Patients # 11 through 16 were treated at the 1 mcg/kg dose level without additional issues 
except patient #11 who was taken off treatment because he experienced DLT: grade 3

17 hypoxia on Cycle 1 Day 6. The patient’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_674588] [ADDRESS_911652] with the patient after 
discharge. The patient reported some dyspnea on exertion during the trip from the airport, 
but was comfortable on the same low flow oxygen when finally sett led at home and had no 
new complaints. When next contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], the patient’s family reported that when the patient 
was checked approximately one hour after going to bed, he was found to be unresponsive. 
Paramedics were called and determined that the patient h ad already expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697]. No 
resuscitation attempts were made and a post mortem exam was not performed due to the 
family’s wishes. This death was reported on NIH Problem Form iRIS # 335749 .   
Patients #17 through 19 tolerated the 2 mcg/kg dose level without sign ificant toxicities or 
DLT.  
Patients #20 and 21 treated at the 4 mcg/kg dose level both had serious DLTs that required 
early discontinuation of their treatment. Patient # 20 was a 64 -year-old male with a history 
of relapsed refractory high mitotic rate spin dle cell gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST ) of 
the small bowel which was initially diagnosed in August 2010.  The patient began CIV rhIL -
15 treatment on 3 February 2015 and initially tolerated his treatment with the expected side 
effects; but by [CONTACT_22058] t day [ADDRESS_911653] pulmonary angiogram 
confirmed the patient had no pulmonary emboli and over the course of the next few days his 
abnormal LFTs, encephalopathy, hypoxia and general condition improved to the point that 
the patient was discharged home. His overall improvement continued for the next 10 to 14 
days and he had returned to his pretreatment functional status when he began to complain of 
increased abdominal/RUQ pain, decreased appetite and wors ening performance status. 
Restaging CT scans performed on cycle 1 day 28 confirmed physical exam findings of 
worsening hepatomegaly and dramatic progression of his intrahepatic as well as an increase 
in intra -abdominal disease compared to his pretreatment scans. He was taken off protocol at 
this time. The patient was assessed as recovered from his acute rhIL -15 toxicities and his 
late general decline was attributed to massive progression of his hepatic and abdominal 
disease. The patient was unable to qualif y for any additional research studies due to his poor 
performance status and worsening organ dysfunction. He died in Home Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_674589] 28 April 
2015.  
Patient #21 was a 61year old female with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)  at the base of the 
tongue (BOT) initi ally diagnosed in August of [ADDRESS_911654] inoperable 
locally recurrent or metastatic disease in December of 2014. This patient began treatment 
rhIL-15 (4 mcg/kg/day by [CONTACT_674632] 240 hours) on 9 February  2015 . Her treatment was 
complicated by [CONTACT_674633] a change in her G -
tube nutritional supplement and later antibiotic related enteritis from empi[INVESTIGATOR_674590]/Sulbactam (Una syn®) that eventually required interruption of her CIV rhIL -15

18 treatment on day 3. The patient’s diarrhea improved with a [ADDRESS_911655] 
patchy ischemia involving all of her stomach, small and large bowel that could not be 
addressed by [CONTACT_78043].  A detailed description of her co urse and her grade 5 
Visceral Ar terial Ischemia was reported to the IRB in an NIH Problem Form .  
The 4 mcg/kg dose level was clearly above the MTD for these 2 patients. As a result, we 
dropped to the next lower dose level of 2mg/kg for subsequent patients.  
Patient # 22 tolerated his 2 cycles of treatment at the 2 mcg/kg dose level relatively well 
with intermittent temperature spi[INVESTIGATOR_674591]. This patient did however have prolo nged fatigue 
after both cycles which gradually improved to baseline or near baseline P erformance Score 
(PS) level by [CONTACT_674634] [ADDRESS_911656] cycle 2 restaging demonstrated disease progression and the patient was taken off study.  
Patient # 23 had metastatic recurrent uterine mixed papi[INVESTIGATOR_674592] 2 mcg/kg dose level fairly well with the expected 
side effects of fatigue, fevers, chills but had appreciable rises in her serum creatinine during 
both cycles of treatment. She also developed pr ogressive dyspnea associated with a 
moderate right sided pleural effusion and mild hypoxia near the end cycle [ADDRESS_911657] eting her 240 hours of CIV rhIL -15 after which 
her dyspnea and hypoxia resolved. The patient had returned to her baseline PS within a few 
days of completing her cycle 1 and after her restaging scans documented stable disease, she 
went on to receive her sec ond cycle of treatment. She tolerated her second cycle of 
treatment with less dyspnea, developed a smaller pleural effusion and only a relative 
decrease in her oxygen saturation that did not require supplemental oxygen, but again had a 
therapeutic thoracen tesis after completing treatment to i mprove her respi[INVESTIGATOR_82219]. 
Analyses of both thoracentese s showed exudative pleural fluid with ≈ 400 to 650 
WBCs/mm3 primarily lymphocytes, few neutrophils, some “other cells” possibly tumor 
cells and were microbiolo gically sterile. The patient was known to have fairly extensive 
right sided sub -diaphragmatic metastatic disease and had previousl y undergone debulking 
surgery  that included resection of some of her right hemi -diaphragm. We concluded that 
these treatment -related effusions represented rhIL -15 related inflammation at this site of 
tumor because the patient did not develop a left sided pleural or any other body cavity 
effusion during her treatment. The patient’s post cycle 2 restaging showed stable disease; 
she was taken off treatment and remains on study without any treatment related issues.  
Patient # 24 who had a diagnosis of NSCLC with EGFR mutation (exome 19 deletion 
normally associated with EGFR -TKI responsiveness) received one cycle of therapy at the 2 
mcg/kg dose level. The patient was noted to have a new right inferior temporal lesion on her 
cycle [ADDRESS_911658] 7 
new enhancing lesions that were consistent with new CNS metastases. The patie nt was 
started on dexamethasone and sent for consultation with Radiation Oncology. She was taken 
off study for disease progression and initiation of another salvage therapy.  
Patient #25 tolerated 2 cycles of treatment without any significant toxicities. Tr eatment was

Version Date:  06/13 /[ADDRESS_911659] cycle 2 restaging which demonstrated no significant 
improvement in her disease and she was subsequently taken off protocol when restaging 
scans performed at home showed disease progression.  
The protocol and the IND w ere placed on clinical hold in May 2015 due to concern s about 
pharmacy infusion preparation procedures after discovery of several vials of human serum 
albumin contaminated with fungus in the lot that had been used to prepare infusion mixtures 
for 4 of the patients treated in this protocol (NIH Problem Form iRIS #  346817 ). No 
evidence of infection  or unusual clinical events was  seen in a period of prolonged 
observation and the FDA has recently specified changes in the drug preparation procedure 
that will all ow the protocol to resume.  
Since resumption of the protocol in 2017, the last two patients #26 and 27 in the 2 mcg/kg 
expansion cohort for the [ADDRESS_911660] two patients #28 and 29 trea ted with 3 mcg/kg on the [ADDRESS_911661] one cycle of treatment without unexpected problems or DLT.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rationale for Phase I Evaluation of Repeated Cycles of rhIL-15 given on  either  a 
10-day or 5-day CIV Schedule  
When rh cytokines firs t became widely available for clinical trials, in addition to identifying 
appropriate dosing , different routes of administration (IV B, CIV, SC, intracavitary or IP) 
and schedules were evaluated. At the time the NCI Surgery Branch was pi[INVESTIGATOR_674593] (tid) IVB regimen that has become the standard HD  IL-2 regimen, the so called 
“West” regime n with  CIV HD IL -2 given over 5 days  (120 hours ) was being investigated in 
numerous clinical trial s. The initial publication for this CIV regimen reported a  higher 
response rate (RR)  along with  a similar spectrum of typi[INVESTIGATOR_639157] -induced side effects, 
but did not show the roller coaster (peak valley) course of BP, capi[INVESTIGATOR_674594] 
A-a gradien t characteristic of the tid HD IL -2 regimen (59, 60). An importan t feature that 
made this treatment plan  popular with certain practitioners was the gradual emergence of 
more serious or DLTs  as the patient’s limit o f tolerance was approached more slow ly. The 
every [ADDRESS_911662] recent dose ; these toxicities  can occur early in the treatment cycle . In addition, 
patients can rapid ly transition from a tolerable treatment course to severe complications in 
the space of a few consecutive doses (36). With CIV HD  IL-2, there is no rapid variation in 
immune activation or secondary cytokine levels , and the patients approach their 
unacceptable toxicity threshold at a steadier and usually slower rate. This  CIV HD IL-[ADDRESS_911663] been 
evaluated by [CONTACT_674635] (60), in the treatment of patients  with HIV 
(61). It is also interesting to note t hat recently a positive phase III licensing trial for the anti -
GD2 chimeric antibody ch14.18 in the treatment of advanced pediatric neuroblastoma (62) 
used a CIV IL -2 regimen as part of a multi -agent treatment . This trial was initiated with a 6 -
week cycle length based on data from the NHP toxicology study that validated the treatment 
regimen  given every 6 weeks . An ongoing clinical multicenter trial (NCI protocol 13 -C-
0045 or CITN 11 -02) evaluating a similar rh IL-15 SC outpatient regimen (M -F for 2 
consecutive weeks) has demonstrated that rhI L-[ADDRESS_911664] 2 cycles of treatment to be  eligible for additional treatment cycles . The clinical course

clinical (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_674595]) monitoring 
and at least daily lab oratory assessments. The current rhIL -[ADDRESS_911666] all events in 
humans is clearly evident. Current results strongly indicate that transient biochem ical 
abnormalities such as elevated liver function tests, decreased leucocytes, lymphocytes and 
platelets can normalize even if CIV rhIL -15 is continued and will resolve to baseline after 
discontinuation of treatment.  Unlike the patients treated with the h igher doses in the IVB 
trial, none of the CIVrhIL -15 treated patients through the 2 mcg/kg dose level have 
demonstrated meaningful blood pressure changes , spi[INVESTIGATOR_674596] -
15 IVB patients . There has been  no correlation between IL -15–induced lymphocytosis and 
the intensity of side effects for patients tr eated in this s tudy or with the IVB regimen  that 
indicate CIV rhIL -15 reproduced the striking  lymphocytosis seen in the NHP toxicology 
studies would automatically be at higher risk f or SAEs. Hematologic and immunologic data 
from patients previously treated in this trial and the SC trial (protocol 13 -C-0045)  (63-65) 
also have indicated some divergence in the rhIL -[ADDRESS_911667] to the NHP data, the CIV and SC rhIL -15 treated patients 
are showing  appreciably greater in vivo increases in absolute NK cell numbers (20 -50x 
pretreatment), but much lower increases in CD8 T -cells (≈ 2 -3x pretreatment) al beit at lower 
rhIL-15 doses than  was well tolerated in the NHP. There is preliminary data suggesting 
differences in the kinetics for upregulation of the IL -15 receptor β chain (CD122) between 
NK and CD8 cells for the patients treated in this trial that may play a role in this finding. 
The safety profile and AEs for the patients treated at the 0.5, 1 and 2 mcg/kg dose levels 
were not appreciably different and suggested the true MTD for the CIV regimen was higher. 
The SAEs that occurred for the 2 patients treated at the 4 mcg/kg dose level were totally 
unacceptable and by [CONTACT_674636] e MTD had been exceeded for 
the CIV regimen, but there are unique features to each patient that should be recognized. 
The start of patient #20’s treatment was delayed 6 weeks for approval of a prior amendment 
during which time his disease became abruptly m ore aggressive resulting in substantial 
progression of his hepatic disease burden. The patient had recovered from his hepatic 
encephalopathy within a week to 10 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_674597] -15 with slower improvement 
of his liver function tests. When the patie nt was taken off protocol due to disease 
progression his scans demonstrated multiple hepatic and mesenteric masses in excess of 10 
cm in diameter and large volume replacement of his liver with the patient’s malignancy. 
Patient #21’s grade 5 SAE was problem atic on many levels including the ultimate inability 
to define the primary pathophysiology that occurred with  this event. The patient was 
assessed as initially having an osmotic diarrhea related to change in her G -tube oral 
supplementation that was potenti ated by [CONTACT_597818][INVESTIGATOR_674598]/sulbactam 
(Una syn) that frequently causes antibiotic associated enteritis. Prior experience in NCI and 

Abbreviated Title:  Ph I Study of CIV rhIL -15 
Version Date:  06/13 /2018  
21 extramural rhIL -15 clinical trials had not shown any real evidence of IL -15 related diarrhea 
or potentiation o f diarrhea due to another cause despi[INVESTIGATOR_674599]. The diffuse patchy ischemia seen in the patient’s 
stomach, small and large bowel at laparotomy infers that rhIL -[ADDRESS_911668] potentiated 
localized inf lammation that compromised small vessel blood flow. We believe that both of 
these patients represent very unique situations that can be avoided by [CONTACT_674637], dose adjustment algorithm and DLT criteria to allow evaluation of rhIL -15 above 
2 mcg/kg in a 5-day treatment schedule with sufficient safety margin.   
The effort to identify the optimal regimen for any new immunotherapeutic requires clinical 
evaluation of the various routes of administration and different schedules. Most of the 
murine preclinical IL -[ADDRESS_911669] 
notable for NK and CD8+ cells predominantly in the  stem, central and effector memory 
subsets. Early data from the current IVB clinical trial has demons trated less consistent 
expansion of CD8+ cells.  Comparison of the immune activation derived from IVB and CIV 
dosing in these NHP toxicology experiments showed that CIV produced a significantly 
greater ALC expansion (2.5 -fold vs.10 to 25 -fold) after a single cycle of rhIL -15 treatment.

Patients will receive CIV rhIL-15 for 1 0 consecutive  days (240 hours) and will be assigned to a 
dose level  sequentially  based on their order of entry into the study. The starting dose will be 0.1 
mcg/kg/day  and i n the absence of significant toxicities, dose escalation will proceed to evaluate 
dose levels of 0.25, 0.5, 1 , 2 and 4 mcg/kg/day.  Cycles [ADDRESS_911681] -treatment (day 12 and week  
4) assessments before additiona l cycles of rhIL -15 can be initiated .  
Radiologic reassessments  for 10-day treatment cycle patients  will be performed  during week 4  
(days 2 6 to 35) of Cycles 1 a nd 2 and at off -treatment and off -study visits.  

Abbreviated Title:  Ph I Study of CIV rhIL -15 
Version Date:  06/13 /2018  
26 After treatment of patients in the expansion cohort for the 10-day schedule is completed, new 
cohorts of 3 to 6 patients each will begin treatment with the 5-day (120 h our) schedule at dose 
levels of 3, 4 or  5 mcg/kg/day to define the MTD for this shorter CIV rhIL -[ADDRESS_911682] enrolled on Dose Levels 1 -6; with 2 more 
to be enrolled in Dose Level 6 after Amendment G. When the study is re -opened for enrollment, 
an additional 17 -23 evaluable patients will be enrolled.  
A total of  9 patients will potentially be treated at  the MTD  or maximum administered dose  for 
both schedule s to better characterize the clinical activity of CIV rhIL -15 in this patient 
population . 
Radiologic reassessments  for both the 10 day and 5-day dosing cohorts  will be performed after 
every other cycle ( 2, 4, 6, 8 etc.)  including the  subjects that go onto to receive additional cycles 
of treatment.  
Patients receiving the 10-day treatment schedule without evidence of an ongoing response after 
any 2 consecutive cycl es of treatment will discontinue rhIL -15 and be followed until disease 
progression is documented or they go off study for another reason. (Ongoing response is defined 
as: > 15% decrease in sum of marker lesions and/or improvement or disappearance of some n on-
measurable lesions and/or > 10% decrease in tumor markers.)  Patients receiving the 5-day 
treatment schedule will have 4 cycl es of treatment to demonstrate  responsiveness to rhIL -15, so 
that patients are given an equal number of rhIL -15 doses  to confirm the treatment has sufficient 
activity to justify more prolonged treatment.   
Patients who demonstrate a complete response (CR) to treatment will receive [ADDRESS_911683] re sponse after 2 consecutive cycles of treatment is stable disease and those 
who stop treatment due to toxicity will be followed with routine exams and restaging x -rays 
(every 60 days x 3 and then quarterly) unless progressive disease is documented or they b egin 
another treatment for their cancer.  
3.[ADDRESS_911684] an initial decrease  in their 
total white blood cell (WBC) counts, significant lymphopenia and occasionall y some degree of 
neutropenia early in the course of their treatment (66, 67). Unlike cyt openias noted in patients 
receiving cytotoxic chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], these drops are usually transient and presumed to be related 
to increased margination (adherence to blood vessel endothelium) or alterations in trafficking 
that reduces the number of circulating  cells rather than the destruction of the mature effector and  
bone marrow precursor cells (68). The impediment to normal trafficking (chemotaxis) of various 
classes of leucocytes best describ ed for patients treated wi th HD IL-2 marginally increases the 
risk for infections, especially central catheter –associated bacteremia; but the rate of infections in 
cytokine -treated patients is substantially less than leucopenic and neutropenic chemothe rapy-
treated patients (69).  
As such, rh cytokine treatment resulting in grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, especially lymphopenia, in 
the absence of signs of infection is usually not interrupted.  Less commonly, patients receiving

these cells are activated and generally large lymphocyt es, toxicities seen in leukemic patients 
with elevated WBC counts are not encountered and therapy is not interrupted based purely on an 
arbitrary WBC number. In the completed IVB trial and in this protocol, we have observed most 
commonly during the first 7  days of treatment transient increases in liver function tests (alkaline 
phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] which 
usually begin to improve while the subject  continues treatment and have not been associated with  
any clinical signs of hepatotoxicity.  During the IVB trial, treatment was discontinued for grade 3 
elevations (> [ADDRESS_911686]) of AST and/ALT in [ADDRESS_911687] s treated at the 1 mcg/kg dose level

Grade [ADDRESS_911691] cycle of treatment , with 
the following exceptions:  
Hematologic exceptions:  
• Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia  
o rhIL-15 will be continued in the event of asymptomatic  grade  3 or 4 lymphopenia , 
unless there are clinical signs of significant infection (persistent fevers, labile blood 
pressure, localized complaints or findings on physical exam, hypoxia  or organ 
dysfunction ).  
• Grade 3 granulocytopenia   
o rhIL-15 will be continued in the event of grade 3 granulocytopenia unless there are 
clinical signs  indicating a significant infection , as listed above.   
• Grade 3 leukocytosis (WBC > 100, 000/mm3) in the absence of signs of leukostasis  or 
other toxicities possibly related to the expansion of activated cells.  
Non-hematologic exceptions :

another cycle of treatment unless restaging has demonstrated progression of their disease ). The 
MTD is the dose level at which no more than [ADDRESS_911695] 2 (of ≤  6) patients have DLT as a result of the drug. If a patient did 
not experience DLT and did not finish 1 cycle of treatment  (42 days) , he or she will not be 
evaluable for determination of the MTD  and will be replaced in the dose level . 
Dose escalation will follow the rules outlined in the Table below.  
Number of Patients with 
DLT  at a Given Dose 
Level  Escalation Decision Rule  
0 out of 3  Enter up to 3 patients at the next dose level  
> 2 Dose escalation will be stopped.  This dose level will be declared the 
maximally administered dose (highest dose administered).  Up to [ADDRESS_911696] dose level if only 3 
patients were treated previously at that dose.

The MTD has already been defined for patients treated with the 10-day regimen. For patients 
treated with the 5-day regimen dose escalation will continue through the 5 mcg/kg/day dose level 
in the absence of  ≥ 2 DLTs for the patients treated for any of the dose levels being evaluated for 
the 5-day regimen. If an MTD is not identified up to 9 patients may be treated at the maximum 
administered dose (MAD) of 5 mcg/kg/day to better evaluate the therapeutic potential of rhIL -15 
given  by [CONTACT_138332] .   
3.4 DRUG ADMINISTRATION  
For all dose levels, the dose of rhIL -15 will be diluted in the appropriate volume of 0.1% human 
serum albumin (HSA)  in 5% dextrose in water, USP (D5W) to reach a final rhIL -15 
concentration of 1 mcg/mL . The rhIL -15 treatment  will be administered to the patient by

Lymphoid Malignancies Branch  Clinical Research personnel will arrange for these samples to be 
sent via courier  to Clinical Support Laboratory  in Frederick (specified above) for assay of  the 
anti-IL-15 antibodies.  
Sampling times for the 10-day infusion schedule are as follows : 
• Day 1 pre -treatment, days 12, 28  and off -treatment visit: One SST tube will be drawn 
to assess for the formation of anti -IL-15 antibodies.  
• Patients will have to demonstrate an absence of anti -IL-[ADDRESS_911725] -
treatment (days 12 and 28) assessments before additiona l cycles of rhIL -15 can be 
initiated.   
Sampling times for the 5-day infusion schedule are as follows:  
• Day 1 pre -treatment, days 6, 21 , day 1 of subsequent cycle s and off -treatment visit: 
One SST tube will be drawn to assess for the formation of anti -IL-15 antibodies.  
• Patients will have to demonstrate an absence of anti -IL-[ADDRESS_911726] -
treatment assessments before additional cycles of rhIL -15 can be initiated.  
5.1.5 Optional Tumor Biopsies  
Subjects with easily accessible superficial tumor deposits will be aske d to sign a separate consent 
for core biopsies that would be performed by [CONTACT_674649]’ Interventional Radiologists (IR) and evaluated by [CONTACT_674650] [pre -treatment and after treatment has started (anytime from Day 8 to 
Day 21)] to assess the dynamics of T -cell infiltration and changes in gene expression associated 
with rhIL -15 treatment.  The biopsies should be processed as follows:  
• LYMB laboratory staff will provide sample tubes with an adequate amount of 
RNAlater® for 1 or 2 cores or an excisional biopsy.  After the biopsy material is placed in 
RNAlater®, the specimen will be refrigerated for 12 to 72 hours in room 4B40 prior to 
being sent via courier to t he Clinical Support  Laboratory in Frederick  for cataloging and 
long-term storage at -80°C.  
• A separate core biopsy (18g) will also be obtained. This sample will be transported to the 
NCI Pathology Department for confirmation  that the specimen contains tumor and for 
perform ing routine histologic and immunohistochemical analyses. Alternatively, if fine 
needle biopsy is performed, the sample will be transported  to Cytology.  
• If excisional biopsy is performed, [CONTACT_674664] will view the size of the specimen to make 
sure an adequate volume of RNAlater® is used to breakdown tissue/denature proteins 
and decide if there is an adequate amount of tissue to perform immunohistochemistry.   
5.2 SAMPLE STORAGE , TRACKING AND DISPOSITION  
Samples will be ordered in CRIS and tracked through a Clinical Trial Data Management system.  
Should a CRIS screen not be available, the CRIS downtime procedures will be followed.  
Samples will not be sent outside NIH without IRB notification and an executed MTA.

Laboratory, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc.in Frederick, MD:  
The Clinical Support Laboratory,  Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc . processes and cryopreserves 
samples in support of IRB -approved, NCI clinical trials. All laboratory pe rsonnel with access to 
patient information annually complete the NIH online course in Protection of Human Subjects.  
The laboratory is CLIA certified for CD4 immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_674611] a Quality Assurance Plan with documented S tandard Operating Procedures that are 
reviewed annually.  Laboratory personnel are assessed for competency prior to being permitted to 
work with patient samples.  Efforts to ensure protection of patient information include:  
• The laboratory is located in a con trolled -access building and laboratory doors are kept 
locked at all times. Visitors to the laboratory are required to be accompanied by 
[CONTACT_79922].   
• Hard copy records or electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_138704].  
• An electronic database is used to store information related to patient samples processed 
by [CONTACT_25699].   
• The database resides on a dedicated program server that is kept in a central, l ocked 
computer facility.   
• The facility is supported by [CONTACT_138761].   
• Program access is limited to specified computers as designated by [CONTACT_138762].  
Each of  these computers has a password restricted login screen.   
• The database sample entry program itself is accessed through a password protected entry 
screen.   
• The database program has different levels of access approval to limit unauthorized 
changes to specimen records and the program maintains a sample history.   
• Upon specimen receipt, each sample is assigned a unique, sequential laboratory accession 
ID number.  All products generated by [CONTACT_674651] a central repository facility are identified by [CONTACT_138764].  
• Inventory information will be stored at the vial level and each vial will be labeled with 
both a sample ID and a vial sequence number.   
• Vial labels do not contain any personal identi fier information.   
• Samples are stored inventoried in locked laboratory freezers and are routinely transferred 
to the NCI -Frederick repository facilities for long -term storage.    
• Access to stored clinical samples is restricted.  Investigators establish sampl e collections 
under “Source Codes” and the investigator responsible for the collections, typi[INVESTIGATOR_151169], specifies who has access to the collection.  
• Specific permissions will be required to view, input or withdraw samples fro m a 
collection. Sample withdrawal requests submitted to approved laboratory staff by [CONTACT_674652].  The repository facility will also notify the Source Code holder of any submitted 
requests for sample withdrawal.  
• It is the responsibility of the Source Code holder (generally the NCI Principal 
Investigator) to ensure that samples requested and approved for withdrawal are being 
used in a manner consistent with IRB approval .

40 • The Clinical Support Laboratory  in Frederick  does perform testing services that may be 
requested by [CONTACT_151227], but not limited to, immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_674612].   
• When requests are submitted by [CONTACT_138766] a Material 
Transfer Agreement is in place that covers the specimen transfer.  The laboratory does not 
provide patient identifier information as part of the transfer process but may, at the 
discretion of the NCI investigator, group samples from individual patients when that is 
critical to the testing process.    
• The NCI investigator responsible for the sampl e collection is responsible for ensuring 
appropriate IRB approvals are in place and that a Material Transfer Agreement has been 
executed prior to requesting the laboratory to ship samples outside of the NIH.   
5.2.2 Sample Handling , Data Collection and Sample Dis position for the Blood Processing Core 
(Figg Lab ) 
•  The samples will be processed, barcoded, and stored in [CONTACT_62583]’s lab until requested by 
[CONTACT_093].  
• All samples sent to the Blood Processing Core  (BPC) will be barcoded, with data entered 
and stored  in the LABrador  (a.k.a . LabSamples) utilized by [CONTACT_74908] . This is a secure 
program, with access to LABrador  limited to defined BPC personnel, who are issued 
individual user accounts. Installation of LABrador is limited to computers specified by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Figg. T hese computers all have a password restricted login screen. All BPC personnel 
with access to patient information annually complete the NIH online Protection of 
Human Subjects course.  
• LABrador creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, which cannot 
be traced back to patients without LABrador access. The data recorded for each sample 
includes the patient ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, 
dose, m aterial type, as well as box and freezer location. Patient demographics associated 
with the clinical center patient number are provided in the system. For each sample, there 
are notes associated with the processing method (delay in sample processing, stora ge 
conditions on the ward, etc.).  
• Following completion of this study, samples will remain in storage as detailed above. 
Access to these samples will only be granted following IRB approval of an additional 
protocol, granting the rights to use the material.  
• Sample barcodes are linked to patient demographics and limited clinical information. 
This information will only be provided to investigators listed on this protocol, via 
registered use of LABrador . It is critical that the sample remains linked to patient 
information such as race, age, dates of diagnosis and death, and histological information 
about the tumor, in order to correlate genotype with these variables.  
5.2.3 Disposition  of samples  
• All specimens obtained in the protocol are used as defined in the protoc ol. Any 
specimens that are remaining at the completion of the protocol will be stored i n the 
conditions described above . The study will remain open so long as sample or data 
analysis continues.  Samples from consenting subjects will be stored until they are  no 
longer of scientific value or if a subject withdraws consent for their continued use, at 
which time they will be destroyed. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_674613]:  Ph I Study of CIV rhIL -15

• Blood and tissue s pecimens collected in the course of this research project may be banked 
and used in the future to investigate new scientific questions related to this study.  
However, this research may only be done if the risks of the new questions were covered 
in the cons ent document and the proposed research has undergone prospective IRB 
review and approval.  If new risks are associated with the research (e.g., analysis of 
germline genetic mutations) , the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_674614] c onsent from all research subjects.  
• Once primary research objectives for the protocol are achieved, intramural researchers 
can request access to remaining samples provided they have an IRB -approved protocol 
and subject  consent.  Access to these samples will only be granted following IRB 
approval of an additional protocol, granting the rights to use the material.  
• Samples will be stored for future use following completion of the study in only those 
subjects who have consented to do so in the Optional Studies se ction of the Consent 
Document . 
• If, at any time, a subject  withdraws from the study and does not wish for their existing 
samples to be utilized, the individual must provide a written request. Following receipt of 
this request, the samples will be destroyed (or returned to the subject , if so requested), 
and reported as such to the IRB.  
• The PI [INVESTIGATOR_118372] (ex. broken freezer or lack of dry ice in a shippi[INVESTIGATOR_34919] ) or if a patient withdraws consent. Samples will also be reported as lost if they 
are lost in transit between facilities or misplaced by a researcher.  Freezer problems, lost 
samples or other problems associated with samples will also be reported to the IR B, the 
NCI Clinical Director, and the office of the CCR, NCI.

investigator, associate investigators/research nurses and/or a contracted data manager will assist 
with the data management efforts . All data obtained during the conduct of the protocol will be 
kept in secure network drives or in approved alternative sites that comply with NIH security 
standards. Primary and final analyzed data will have identifiers so that research data can be 
attributed to an individual human subject participant.  
All adverse events, including  clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, 
regardless of severity, will be followed until return to baseline or stabilization of event. Patients 
will be followed for adverse events for at least [ADDRESS_911728].  
An abnormal laboratory value will be recorded in the database as an AE only if the laboratory

subject confidentiality and trial data has occurred, the IRB will be notified.  
6.2 RESPONSE CRITE RIA 
6.2.1 Radiographic Evaluation and Laboratory Assessments for Clinical Responses  
• All patients will have repeat baseline radiologic studies to assess marker lesions 
(measurable) and evaluable lesions (non -measurable) performed on day 28 ± 3 days of 
each treatm ent cycle for comparison to their pre -treatment studies.  
• Patients with evidence of a partial or complete response (RECIST criteria) may undergo a 
confirmatory scan that will be performed at least [ADDRESS_911729] met 
the criteria for a c linical response to rhIL -15 treatment.  
• Appropriate patients with tumors known to have tumor markers (PSA, CEA, and CA125) 
will have the serum level of these markers assessed at the time of their radiographic 
restaging to gain further insight into the poten tial efficacy of rhIL -15 treatment.  
6.2.2 Solid Tumors  
Response and progression for all solid tumors with the exception of non -Hodgkin’s lymphomas 
will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_674653] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) (70). Changes 
in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest 
diameter in the case of malignant lymph no des are used in the RECIST criteria.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity : All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first 
treatment with rhIL-15. 
Evaluable for objective response : Only those patients who have measurable disease present 
at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -
evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. These patients will have their response 
classified accordi ng to the definitions stated below. (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective 
disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response : Patients who have lesions present at baseline that 
are eval uable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least 
one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable 
for non -target disease. The response assessment is based on the presence, absence , or 
unequivocal progression of the lesions.

ray, as >[ADDRESS_911732] scan, or >[ADDRESS_911733] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be  >[ADDRESS_911734] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed.  
Non-measurable disease . All other lesions (or sites of disease ), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are 
considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonit is, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -measurable.  
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should 
not be considered as malignant lesions (neithe r measurable nor non -measurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic 
lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
Target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions 
in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identif ied as target lesions  and 
recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their 
size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to  reproducible repeated measurements.  It 
may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible 
measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the  diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short 
axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non-target lesions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above  the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the 
presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout  follow -up.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Methods for Evaluation of Measur able Disease   
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and nev er more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to e valuation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
Abbreviated Title:  Ph I Study of CIV rhIL -15 
Version Date:  06/13 /2018  
44 Clinical lesions : Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lym ph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x -ray: Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI : This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickne ss is [ADDRESS_911735] slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the 
slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable glob ally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical 
specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the 
type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be 
the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same 
pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI 
pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type 
of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely 
as possible to prior scans.  Body  scans should be performed with breath -hold scanning 
techniques, if possible.  
PET-CT: At present, the low dose or attenuation correct ion CT portion of a combined PET -
CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  
However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical 
diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the 
PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with 
conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the 
PET portion of the CT introduces additi onal data which may bias an investigator if it is not 
routinely or serially performed.   
Ultrasound : Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in the ir entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to 
the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation 
by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be 
used instead of CT in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy : The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation 
is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological 
response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence 
following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor marke rs: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in 
Abbreviated Title:  Ph I Study of CIV rhIL -15 
Version Date:  06/13 /2018  
45 complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published (71-
73). In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -[ADDRESS_911736] -line trials 
in ovarian cancer (74). 
Cytology, Histology : These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., resi dual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria  for response or stable 
disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be 
a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
FDG -PET: While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes  
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of 
FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the positive FDG -
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654],  this is PD.  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the ini tial abnormal 
FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this 
is not PD.  
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner  similar to a biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described 
in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical litera ture for the indication.  
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive 
CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that 
is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance  of one or more 

Abbreviated Title:  Ph I Study of CIV rhIL -15 
Version Date:  06/13 /2018  
46 new lesions is also considered progressions).  
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, t hey must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or  more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression  of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not normally 
trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a 
single lesion increase .   
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12999], and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evalu ation of Best Overall Response   
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment  started).  The patient's best response assignment 
will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response : The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smalles t measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
Duration of stable disease : Stabl e disease is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
6.2.3 Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma   
Response and  progression for non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma will be evaluated in this study using the  
International Working Group Recommendations  (75).  
Complete Response (CR) requires the following:  
• Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease -related 
symptoms if present before therapy.  
• Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357] -avid lymphoma: in patients with no pretreatment PET scan or when the 
PET scan was positive before therapy, a post-treatment residual mass of any size is 
permitted as long as it is PET n egative.  

Abbreviated Title:  Ph I Study of CIV rhIL -15 
Version Date:  06/13 /2018  
48 • Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown: in patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymph nodes and nodal masses 
must have regressed on CT to normal size ( 1.[ADDRESS_911738] transve rse diameter 
for nodes > 1.5 cm before therapy).  Previously involved nodes that were 1.[ADDRESS_911739] 
decreased to 1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment.  
• The spleen a nd/or liver, if considered enlarged before therapy on the basis of a physical 
examination or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical examination and should be 
considered normal size by [CONTACT_20521], and nodules related to lymphoma should 
disappear.  However, determination of splenic involvement is not always reliable because 
a spleen considered normal in size may still contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged 
spleen may reflect variations in anatomy, blood volume, the use of hematopoietic growth 
factors,  or causes other than lymphoma.  
• If the bone marrow was involved by [CONTACT_22679], the infiltrate must have 
cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy. The biopsy sample on which this determination is 
made must be adequate (with a goal of >  20 mm unil ateral core).  If the sample is 
indeterminate by [CONTACT_5293], it should be negative by [CONTACT_9064].  A sample 
that is negative by [CONTACT_248288] a small population of 
clonal lymphocytes by [CONTACT_127891]  a CR until data become 
available demonstrating a clear difference in patient outcome.  
Partial Response (PR) requires:  
• At least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six of the 
largest dominant nodes or nodal masses.  These nodes or masses should be selected 
according to all of the following: they should be clearly measurable in at least 
2 perpendicular dimensions; if possible they should be from disparate regions of the 
body; and they should include mediastinal and retroperi toneal areas of disease whenever 
these sites are involved.  
• No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen.  
• Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by 50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, in 
the greatest transverse diameter.  
• With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually 
assessable and no measurable disease should be present.  
• Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was 
positive before t reatment.  However, if positive, the cell type should be specified (e.g., 
large -cell lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells).  Patients who achieve a CR by [CONTACT_164435], but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be 
considered parti al responders.   
When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a clinical CR was achieved, but 
with no bone marrow assessment after treatment, patients should be considered partial 
responders.  
• No new sites of disease should be observed.  
• Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] , FDG-avid lymphoma: for patients with no pretreatment PET scan or if the PET 
scan was positive before therapy, the post-treatment PET should be positive in at least one 
previously involved site. Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidity unknown: for 
patients without a pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, CT 

Abbreviated Title:  Ph I Study of CIV rhIL -15 
Version Date:  06/13 /2018  
49 criteria should be used.  
Stable disease is defined as less than a PR (see above) but is not progressive disease (see 
below) : 
• A patient is considered to have SD when he or she f ails to attain the criteria needed for a 
CR or PR, but does not fulfill those for progressive disease (see Relapsed Disease [after 
CR]/Progressive Disease [after PR, SD]).  
• Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] , FGD -avid lymphomas: the PET should be positive at prior sites of disease  with 
no new areas of involvement on the post-treatment CT or PET.  
• Variably FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidity unknown: for patients without a 
pretreatment PET scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change 
in the size of the previous lesions on the post -treatment CT scan.  
Relapsed disease (after CR)/Progressive disease (after PR/SD) requires the following:    
• Appearance of any new lesion more than 1.[ADDRESS_911740] are m ostly benign.  Thus, a therapeutic 
decision should not be made solely on the basis of the PET without histologic 
confirmation. 
• At least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved nodes, or in a 
single involved node, or the size of other  lesions (e.g., splenic or hepatic nodules).  To be 
considered progressive disease, a lymph node with a diameter of the short axis of less than 
1.[ADDRESS_911741] increase by 50% and to a size of 1.5 x 1.5 cm or more than 1.5 cm in the 
long axis. 
• At least a 50% i ncrease in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node 
more than 1 cm in its short axis.  
• Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_20359] -avid lymphoma or the lesion 
was PET positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with current 
PET systems (< 1.[ADDRESS_911742]).  
6.2.4 Time to Progression  
Time to progression will be measured from the date of protocol consent until death of 
progressive disease is documented.  
6.2.5 Immunologic Response Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Biologically Active Dose  
• ≥ 50% increase of the circulating absolute NK -cell number (product of absolute number 
of mononuclear cells and the proportion of NK cells) that is maintained for at least 1  
week as determined by [CONTACT_674654]’s pre -treatment NK -cell count 
(APPENDIX B). The baseline will be defined in each patient as the number of NK cells 
determined no more than 1 month prior to rhIL -15 administration.  
• The study will aim at determining a range of biologic ally active doses meeting the above  
criteria.

50 [IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Biologic Study Endpoints  
In mice and non -human primates, another sensitive indicator of biological activity following 
IL-15 administration has been the expansion of the T -memory phenotype CD44hiCD8+ (T-
cell memory phenotype compartment in mice) cel l. Therefore, the secondary biological 
endpoint will aim at determining signs of expansion of the counterpart T -cell population in 
humans.  
• Doubling  in the absolute number of CD45RO+ CD8+ T-cells that is maintained for at least 
1 week as determined by [CONTACT_674654]’s pre -treatment CD45RO+ CD8+ 
T-cell count.  The baseline will be defined in each patient as the number of these  cells 
determined no more than 1 month prior to rhIL -15 administrat ion. 
• The immunogenicity of the infused rhIL -15 will be defined using a 2 -arm capture ELISA 
method ( APPENDIX B). 
• At least a 2 -fold increase in serum soluble IL -2R-alpha (sIL -2R-alpha) levels.

considered related to the subject’s participation in the research .  
7.1.2  Suspected adverse reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable poss ibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesse r degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
7.1.3 Unexpected adverse reaction  
An adverse event  or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in 
the investigator broch ure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, 
if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. 
"Unexpected”, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in 
the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specif ically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation.

• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in d eath, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

7.3.1 Reporting  Pregnanc y 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Maternal  exposure  
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the study treatment should be 
discontinued immediately and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor. The potential risk of 

Abbreviated Title:  Ph I Study of CIV rhIL -15 
Version Date:  06/13 /2018  
53 exposure of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agents (s) should be 
documented in box B5 of the MedWatch form “Describe Event or Problem”.  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_674615] s of a contraceptive medication. 
However, as patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the fetus 
to agents which may be teratogenic, the CCR is requesting that pregnancy should be 
reported in an expedited manner as Grade 3 “Pregna ncy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions - Other (pregnancy )” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions SOC.  
Congenital abnormalities or birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported 
and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as 
AEs. The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic 
pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented.  
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the investigator should inform the 
Sponsor within 1 day, i.e., immediately, but no later than 24 hours of when he or she 
becomes aware of it.  
The designated Sponsor representative will work with the investigator to ensure that  all 
relevant information is provided to the Sponsor within 1 to 5 calendar days for SAEs and 
within 30 days for all other pregnancies.  
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Paternal exposure  
Male patients should refrain from fath ering a child or donating sperm during the study and 
for [ADDRESS_911749] dose of rhIL -15. 
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of 
all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ecto pic pregnancy, normal 
birth, or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until [ADDRESS_911750] dose should, if possible, be followed up and documented.  
7.4 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
7.4.1 Principal Investigator/Research Team  
The clinical research team will meet on a weekly basis when patients are being actively treated 
on the trial to discuss each patient. Decisions about dose level enrollment and dose escalation if 
applicable will be made based on the toxi city data from prior  patients.  
All data will be collected in a timely manner and reviewed by [CONTACT_458]. Adverse 
events will be reported as required above. Any safety concerns, new information that might 
affect either the ethical and or scientific conduct of the trial, or protocol deviations will be 
immediately reported to the IRB using iRIS and if applicable to the Sponsor.

7.4.2 Sponsor Monitoring Plan  
Abbreviated Title:  Ph I Study of CIV rhIL -15 
Version Date:  06/13 /2018  
54 As a sponsor for clinical trials, FDA regulations require the CCR t o maintain a monitoring 
program. The CCR’s program allows for confirmation of: study data, specifically data that could 
affect the interpretation of primary study endpoints; adherence to the protocol, regulations, and 
SOPs; and human subjects protection. T his is done through independent verification of study 
data with source documentation focusing on:  
• Informed consent process  
• Eligibility confirmation  
• Drug administration and accountability  
• Adverse events monitoring  
• Response assessment.  
The monitoring program  also extends to multi -site research when the CCR is the coordinating 
center.  
This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_62561] a  CCR contractor. Monitors are qualified 
by [CONTACT_12293]. Personn el monitoring this 
study will not be affiliated in any way with the trial conduct.   
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The primary objective of this trial is to determine the safety, toxicity profile, DLT and MTD of 
CIV rhIL-15 administered for 10 consecutive days (240 hours) or 5 consecutive days (120 hours) 
in subjects with metastatic unresectable cancers for which curative or palliative measures either 
do not exist or are not associated with a survival advantage.   
The secondary objectives include determination of rhIL -15 PK, including time to reach serum 
steady state, decline if any at later time  points, changes in serum concentration associated with 
the expected lymphocytosis and decline following discontinuation of th e CIV infusion ; 
characteriz ation of the biological effects of rhIL -15 on the percentages and absolute numbers of 
circulating lymphocyte sets (NK and T-cells) and T -cell subsets  (naïve, central or effector 
memory subsets based on expression of CD56, CD4, CD 8, CD45RO, CD45RA, CD28, CD95, 
CCR7 and CD62L) by [CONTACT_674655] -inflammatory cytokines . The 
potential a ntitumor activity of rhIL -15 will be assess ed by  [CONTACT_674656]; and a ssessment of the nature of T-cell infiltration and 
cytokine and check -point inhibitor gene expression by [CONTACT_674619] - and post -treatment 
biopsies obtained from  selected patients with easily accessible tumor  deposits . All evaluations of 
these secondary endpoints will be considered exploratory.  
There are [ADDRESS_911751] of patients (0/3 or 0 -
1/6 patients) treated at that dose experience a DLT, with the next higher dose level demonstrating 
a one -third o r greater number of patients (≥ 2/3 or ≥ 2/6 patients) having DLT . If a patient did 
not experience DLT and did not finish 1 cycle of treatment  (either 42 or 21 days) , he or she will 
not be evaluable for determination of the MTD and will be replaced in the dose level . An 
additional 3 to 6 patients will be enrolled at the MTD or , if no severe or dose -limiting toxicities 
are encountered,  the maximum administered dose of rhIL -15, so that a total of 9 patients will 
potentially be treated at MTD for  either schedu le to better characterize the clinical activity of 
Abbreviated Title:  Ph I Study of CIV rhIL -15 
Version Date:  06/13 /2018  
55 CIV rhIL -15 in this patient population. If feasible , the patients enrolled in this expansion cohort 
will be limited to histologic cancer subtypes previously shown to be sensitive to immunotherapy  
(renal ce ll carcinoma, melanoma, prostate, colorectal and ovarian cancer) .  
As of April [ADDRESS_911752] enrolled on Dose Levels 1 -6; with 2 more 
to be enrolled in Dose Level 6 after Amendment G . A maximum of 6 evaluable patients may be 
enrolled at DL 7 & 8  with an additional 9 at DL 9. If all dose levels are evaluated ( with 6 patients 
per remaining dose level s and 9 total patients at the MTD or maximum administered dose) , a 
maximum of 47 evaluab le patients will be enrolled.  An additional 5 patients may be enrolled to 
compensate for  inevaluable patients ; thus , bringing the maximum accrual ceiling to 52. 
Similarly, if all dose levels are evaluated, t he minimum number of patients required will be 41 
([ADDRESS_911753] enrolled at DL 1 -6; with 2 more to be enrolled in Dose Level 6 after 
Amendment G and with 3 patients enrolled at DL 7 & 8; 9 at DL 9; and 5 inevaluable patients  a 
minimum of 46 will be reached ).  
Patients with tumors known to h ave tumor markers (PSA, CEA, CA125) will have the serum 
level of these markers assessed at the time of their radiographic restaging to gain further insight 
into the potential efficacy of rhIL -[ADDRESS_911754] normalize  for the patient to be considered a complete response. 
Specific guidelines for  serum tumor markers previously reported (CA125 and PSA) will be used 
to assess responses to rhIL -15 treatment.  
Using the two dose escalation schedules , the probability of escalating to the next dose level, 
based on the true rate of DLT at the current dose  for each schedule , is given by [CONTACT_541062] (each group will be consider ed independently of the other):  
True Toxicity at 
a Given Dose  10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 
Probability of 
Escalating  .91 .71 .49 .31 .17 .08 
Thus, if the true underlying proportion of DLTs is 50% at the current dose, there is a 17% chance 
of escalating to the next dose.

10.4 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
The discomfort s of a 10-day CIV of rh IL-[ADDRESS_911758] on humans (biological activity).  Recently there has been 
new evidence to suggest that patients with solid tumor s may respond to immunotherapeutics or 
that infiltration  of their tumor deposits by [CONTACT_674658] T -cells is as sociated with an 
improved survival. These finding lend additional weight to the notion that the administration of 

Abbreviated Title:  Ph I Study of CIV rhIL -15 
Version Date:  06/13 /2018  
57 rhIL-15 might be associated with a partial or complete response of the patient’s tumor more 
commonly associated with the immune -based treatmen t of metastatic melanoma and metastatic 
renal cell cancer.  
10.[ADDRESS_911759] letters or emails will be  sent to the regional University referral 
center’s Medical Oncologists informing them of this trial. In addition , the information will be 
provided on the NCI Clinical Trials and Clinical Trials.gov web pages . 
10.6 RISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS  
The success of this effo rt cannot be predicted at this time. Because all patients in this  protocol 
have incurable metastatic cancer and limited life expectancies , the potential benefit is  thought to 
outweigh the potential risks.  
Given the prospect of direct benefit, this same risks/benefits analysis applies also to adults who 
may become unable to consent during participation.

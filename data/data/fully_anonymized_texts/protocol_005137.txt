[ADDRESS_1152021] that can be directly impacted by [CONTACT_830114] a mathematical based surgical plan for the suggested treatment of the patient’s refractive spherical magnitude, the astigmatic magnitude, and the astigmatic axis. Consequently, it is anticipated that Phorcides will prove to be a powerful surgical planning tool directly resulting in improved postoperative patient satisfaction with visual acuity and visual symptoms.  The decision to choose between a Phorcides derived Contoura LASIK ablation versus other various refractive procedures often times can be a difficult decision because of a lack of previous research analyzing patient satisfaction with their postoperative uncorrected visual acuity and visual symptoms. The purpose of this study is to determine the percentage of subjects satisfied with vision after Phorcides Planned Contoura LASIK. 6.  OBJECTIVE(S) To determine the percentage of subjects satisfied (Completely Satisfied or Very Satisfied) with vision after Phorcides Planned Contoura LASIK. 7.  SUBJECTS 7.1. Subject Population  Eligible test subjects will be [ADDRESS_1152022] meet the inclusion criteria. Prior to enrollment, subjects will be provided information on the study and asked to sign a patient information and consent form to participate. The patient information and consent form will be approved by [CONTACT_140284]. 7.2. Inclusion Criteria Subjects are eligible for the study if they meet the following criteria: Note: Ocular criteria must be met in both eyes. • Appropriate candidate for uncomplicated bilateral LASIK surgery  • Gender: Males and Females.   • Age: 21 to 39 years of age.

Exclusion Criteria If any of the following exclusion criteria are applicable to the subject or either eye, the subject should not be enrolled in the study. • Subjects with history of previous ocular surgery.  • Subjects with topographic evidence of keratoconus, or ectasia.  • Subjects with autoimmune diseases. • Subjects who are pregnant or nursing. • Systemic disease likely to affect wound healing, such as diabetes and severe atopy. • Any ocular disease (including un-controlled dry eye) which in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_830113]. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_98132] a patient ineligible or non-evaluable based on medical evidence that indicates they are unsuitable for the trial.   Pregnancy has a known effect on the stability of refractions and visual acuity. As such, subjects who become pregnant during the study will not be discontinued but their data may be excluded from analyses of effectiveness. 8.  STUDY DESIGN 8.1. Study Design  This study is a single site, single-arm, prospective, observational study of subject satisfaction, after successful bilateral LASIK surgery. Subjects will be assessed pre-operatively, operatively and at [ADDRESS_1152024] refraction, and topography, aberrometry, and administration of the OSDI and PROWL questionnaires.  The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of subjects satisfied (Completely Satisfied or Very Satisfied) with vision after Phorcides Planned Contoura LASIK based on PROWL Questionnaire preoperative vs postoperative (question #1 only).  
Satisfaction with Contoura LASIK using Phorcides Page 8 of 20 v 1.0  11 Apr 2023  Secondary outcome measures are as follows: • Percentage of eyes with post-op spherical equivalent within +/- 0.50 D.  Exploratory outcome measures are as follows: • Preoperative and postoperative higher order aberrations (spherical aberration and coma). • Preoperative and postoperative responses on the PROWL questionnaire (Q2-Q33). • Preoperative and postoperative OSDI scores. • Correlation of postoperative OSDI score and responses on the postoperative PROWL questionnaire (Q1).  8.2. Methods Used to Minimize Bias  As a single-arm study there is no expected bias. Patient selection will be based on the patient’s interest and the surgeon’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_140279] a suitable candidate for LASIK.  The measurement of visual acuity will be conducted in a systematic fashion to minimize bias. Individuals conducting visual acuity measures will be instructed to perform the same testing in the same fashion for all subjects, with the same level of encouragement to subjects. Questionnaire instructions will be provided to all patients in a similar manner.  All data collection will be completed through provided Case Report Forms (CRFs) or computer files generated by [CONTACT_140285]. All site personnel involved in the study will be trained in regard to conducting study-specific procedures. 9.  STUDY PROCEDURE  9.1. Informed Consent / Subject enrollment  No subject will be enrolled into the study who does not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and does not sign the current approved informed consent document. Informed consent will be obtained prior to collecting any data for the study. The original signed documents will be maintained by [CONTACT_1694] a permanent part of the subject's medical records. A signed copy will be provided to the subject.  9.2. Visits and Examinations  Subjects will participate in 3 study visits, including one visit for bilateral surgery. Visits will include an uptake visit, and one operative visit (Visit numbers 1-2 below).  The visit schedule, complete with window and associated CRF forms, are displayed in Table 9.2-1.  Details of each study visit, including testing to be conducted, are provided below.

After subjects are consented, they will be qualified for the study (compared with inclusion/exclusion criteria) and assigned a study ID/subject number.  Subject numbers will be assigned sequentially at each site in the order of enrollment.  A medical history will be taken and exams will include the tests described below: § manifest refraction, § visual acuity, § slit lamp exam, § dilated fundus exam, § topography, § aberrometry, § OSDI questionnaire, § PROWL questionnaire  In addition, all site-specific, routine, usual standard of care preoperative measures should be undertaken.   Measurements should be made as described in section 9.3 below.   9.2.2. Operative (Surgery)  All subjects will undergo bilateral LASIK surgery. The surgeon’s usual standard of care with regard to treatment and medication will be used for all study subjects. Surgery planning will be performed using the surgeon’s preferred method.  
Satisfaction with Contoura LASIK using Phorcides Page 10 of 20 v 1.0  11 Apr 2023  Any adverse events/serious adverse events (AEs/ SAEs) occurring during surgery will be noted at this visit. Any other problems during surgery and comments regarding surgery will be documented.  Any subject whose surgery is not completed successfully will be documented in the appropriate case report form. These subjects will be monitored for safety but clinical performance data may be excluded from the analysis. 9.2.3. Postoperative [ADDRESS_1152026] refraction, slit lamp examination (Section 9.3). Any device deficiencies or adverse events will be monitored.  9.2.4. Postoperative [ADDRESS_1152027] refraction, slit lamp examination (Section 9.3). Any device deficiencies or adverse events will be monitored.  9.2.4. Postoperative [ADDRESS_1152028] refraction, slit lamp examination, dilated fundus exam, topography, aberrometry, and complete the OSDI and PROWL questionnaires (Section 9.3). Any device deficiencies or adverse events will be monitored.  9.2.3. Exit Procedures In the event of premature exit from the study, all study related examinations should be completed where possible. The Exit CRF should be completed, noting that the subject did not complete the study and the reason for premature study exit.  If no premature exit from the study occurs, the Exit CRF should be completed at the end of Visit 5.   9.3. Study Methods and Measurements All routine testing and basic eye examinations should be carried out at each study visit.  Abnormalities should be recorded in the CRF “Comment” section.  Specific study examination procedures are outlined below.    9.3.1. Manifest Refraction Perform a manifest refraction with a high contrast early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) chart under photopic lighting conditions.  Document refraction results with sphere, cylinder and axis readings.  If uncorrected visual 
Satisfaction with Contoura LASIK using Phorcides Page [ADDRESS_1152029] refraction, use zero for sphere and cylinder and draw a line through the blank for the axis.   Note:  Each subject should be manually refracted to his/her best correction by [CONTACT_4674], optometrist, or a skilled technician using a phoropter or trial lenses.     9.3.2. Visual Acuity (VA) Distance VA Measure distance visual acuity using a high contrast ETDRS chart under photopic lighting at a distance of [ADDRESS_1152030] an exit visit or who come into the office to be exited prior to the scheduled final study visit. Subjects may be discontinued from the study at any time if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], their continued participation in the study poses a risk to their health. The reasons for discontinuation include: a. Adverse event; b. Lost to follow-up; c. Subject decision unrelated to an adverse event; d. Protocol violation; e. Treatment failure; f. Other.  To ensure the safety of all subjects who discontinue prior to Visit 5, investigators should assess each subject and, if necessary, advise them of any therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265]/or medical procedures that might be needed to maintain their health. Any changes in medical health and/or use of concomitant medications should also be captured. 10.  ANALYSIS PLAN 10.1. Analysis Data Sets All subjects who are enrolled in the study will be evaluated for safety.  Efficacy analyses will be performed based on data from those eyes with uncomplicated LASIK surgery.   
Satisfaction with Contoura LASIK using Phorcides Page [ADDRESS_1152031].  10.3. General Statistical Considerations The statistical analyses will be performed using R, version 4.1.2 or higher.  Any statistical tests of hypotheses will employ a level of significance of alpha=0.05. 11.  SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION We estimate that the study would require a sample size of 46 subjects (number of pairs) to achieve a power of 90% and a level of significance of 5%, for detecting a mean of difference of 25 points in satisfaction (using the PROWL questionnaire) between pairs, and assuming the standard deviation of the differences to be 50 points.3 To account for dropout, 52 subjects will be enrolled.  12. CONFIDENTIALITY/PUBLICATION OF THE STUDY The existence of this Study is confidential and should not be discussed with persons outside of the Study. Results will be submitted for publication and presentation at national and/or international meetings. A manuscript will be submitted to peer-review journals for publication but there is no guarantee of acceptance.  All study data will be collected on appropriate Case Report Forms (CRFs). No protected health information will be included on the forms. CRFs will be retained in the patient’s file for a minimum period of [ADDRESS_1152032] access to your study records:   •    Study Doctor and staff involved with the study  •    Study Monitor or Auditor  •    Sponsor Company or Research Institution  •    Review boards or accrediting agencies  •    Other State or Federal Regulatory Agencies 
Satisfaction with Contoura LASIK using Phorcides Page [ADDRESS_1152033] any adverse event is included on each case report form. 13.1. General Information An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who is administered. a study treatment regardless of whether or not the event has a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study treatment, whether or not related to the treatment. In clinical studies, an AE can include an untoward medical occurrence occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 13.2. Monitoring for Adverse Events At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any problems, the Investigator should inquire about AEs by [CONTACT_140286].  13.3. Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs Subsequent to signing an informed consent form, all untoward medical occurrences that occur during the course of the study must be documented on an Adverse Event Form (AEF). A separate AEF must be filled out for each event. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be documented as one comprehensive event. For each recorded event, the AE documentation must include the onset date, outcome, resolution date (if event is resolved), intensity (i.e., severity), any action with study treatment taken as a result of the event, and an assessment of the adverse event’s relationship to the study treatment. Nonserious Adverse Events A nonserious AE is defined as any untoward change in a subject's medical health that does not meet serious criteria noted below (e.g., is not life-threatening, does not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], does not prolong a current hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], is not disabling, etc.). All adverse events must be reported regardless of whether or not they are related to the study treatment.  For nonserious adverse events, an AEF containing all available information will be collected on a routine basis and submitted to the Medical Monitor at the close of the study.   Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any adverse experience that meets any of the following criteria: • Results in death. 
Satisfaction with Contoura LASIK using Phorcides Page 14 of 20 v 1.0  11 Apr 2023  • Is life-threatening. NOTE: Life-threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. NOTE: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140280]/or treatment (usually involving an overnight stay) that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or an out-patient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred, the event should be considered serious. • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, or accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. • Is an important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124495], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All available information on a serious adverse event(s) and any other associated AE, if applicable, must be forwarded to the study coordinator for forwarding to the Medical Monitor immediately (i.e., within one working day of the Investigator’s or site’s knowledge of the event) as follows: o In studies utilizing EDC (electronic data capture), all available information for the SAE and any associated AE(s) must be entered immediately into the EDC system.  o Additional information for any applicable event is to be reported as soon as it becomes available.  In addition to the reporting of serious adverse events to the study Medical Monitor, the SAE must be reported to the IRB / IEC according to their requirements.  The investigator must document all adverse device events (serious and nonserious but related) and all serious adverse events (related and unrelated) on the Adverse Device Effect and Serious Adverse Event Form. Any device quality complaints will also be documented.   
Satisfaction with Contoura LASIK using Phorcides Page 15 of 20 v 1.0  11 Apr 2023  • Both the Quality Complaint Form and the Adverse Device Effect and Serious Adverse Event Form must be e-mailed immediately to the study coordinator (Melissa Hamann Wright). • Additional relevant information is to be reported as soon as it becomes available.    Study coordinator contact [CONTACT_76533].

The investigator must also report all adverse events and quality complaints according to the relevant IRB requirements.  12.3.[ADDRESS_1152034] assess the causality as Related or Not Related to the medical device under investigation. An assessment of causality will also be performed by [CONTACT_140288], as shown below:  Causality Related An adverse event or quality complaint classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly related where a direct cause and effect relationship with the medical device has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event or quality complaint was caused by [CONTACT_140289].   Not Related An adverse event or quality complaint classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or simply unlikely to be related (i.e., there are other more likely causes for the adverse event or quality complaint).  
Satisfaction with Contoura LASIK using Phorcides Page [ADDRESS_1152035] assess the intensity (severity) of the adverse event as mild, moderate, or severe based on medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:   Intensity (Severity) Mild An adverse event is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign or symptom. Moderate An adverse event is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant enough to cause interference with the subject’s usual activities. Severe An adverse event is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the subject’s inability to work or engage in their usual activities.  The investigator must document any action taken (i.e., medication, intervention, or treatment plan) and outcome of the adverse event or quality complaint when applicable. 13.4. Follow-Up of Adverse Events and Quality Complaints The investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow-up procedures are maintained after the study.  Any additional data from these follow-up procedures must be documented and available to the study coordinator who, with the Medical Monitor, will determine when the data need to be documented on the CRFs.  13.5. Safety Analyses The type, severity, duration and frequency of reported ocular adverse events will be tabulated.  Adverse events will also be summarized for events that were considered treatment-related.   14. GCP, ICH and ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS This study will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), including International Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines, and in general, consistent with the [ADDRESS_1152036] regulations.  The investigator will obtain appropriate IRB/ethics committee approval prior to initiating the study.  The study will be registered with clinicaltrials.gov.

  CONFIDENTIAL  1 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in 
accordance with the applicable [LOCATION_002] government regulations and Mayo Clinic research 
policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
 
There has been a rapid rise in opi[INVESTIGATOR_713254] (US) due to 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_280148]. In 2017 the Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that 72,[ADDRESS_970864] emming from 
prescription medications. This rate was an approximate two -fold increase over the previous 
decade and does not include an additional 2 million who are estimated to suffer from a substance 
abuse disorder related to opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007].1,2 The hig h rate of opi[INVESTIGATOR_388567] -prescription 
following surgery is thought to contribute to the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_901].3 In 2014 the National Survey 
on Drug Use and Health estimated that more than 10 million people in the [LOCATION_002] used 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_713255], and that 55% of the medication was obtained from a 
friend or relative.[ADDRESS_970865] opi[INVESTIGATOR_279734] ( Combatting Opi[INVESTIGATOR_289031]. 2017. 
https://www.aaos.org/AAOSNow/2017/Jun/YourAAOS/youraaos10/?ssopc=1 ). Previous work 
demonstrated that surgeons prescribe three times the narcotics required by [CONTACT_713276].5-8 Additionally, in a separate study, 
13% of narcotic naïve patients became prolonged opi[INVESTIGATOR_713256].[ADDRESS_970866] demonstrated that a collaborative approach between the anesthesia 
and orthopedic teams, utilizing both local and regional nerve blocks,  reduced pain scores with a 
simultaneous 43% decrease in oral morphine equivalents consumed during the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].10,[ADDRESS_970867] not 
evaluated the efficacy of these regimens with adductor pa in catheters.12-17 We recently performed 
a randomized, prospective, double -blinded, placebo -controlled trial using a multimodal regimen 
with and without schedule II opi[INVESTIGATOR_713257]. In that study we utilized 
an adductor canal pain catheter with a c ontinuous infusion for four days postoperatively. We 
demonstrated equivalent postoperative pain scores in the oxycodone and placebo group with use 
of the adductor catheter. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_713258], 20% of the oxycodone 
cohort required continued narcotic medication at 60 days postoperatively ( submitted for 
publication ).  
 
It is currently unknown if a continuous infusion is the most efficacious form of medication 
delivery through the catheter. Recent studies have begun to evaluate intermittent bolus infusions, 
with the belief that catheter placement is less critical when com pared to a continuous infusion. 
Adductor Catheter Efficacy Following Total Knee Arthroplasty  Version 3.4 
    
Page 8 of 27 
  CONFIDENTIAL  Our study is intended to directly compare these delivery modes in a double -blinded, randomized 
controlled trial.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
 
This study is not evaluating a specific drug, but rather the safety and efficacy of delivery modes 
for an adductor canal pain catheter following total knee arthroplasty.  
1.3 Clinical Data to Date 
 
Research has focused on prescribing practices, demonstrating the risks of long -term opi[INVESTIGATOR_713259].5,8,20  This has led hospi[INVESTIGATOR_713260]. For example, 
Wyles et al. demonstrated a reduction in the average oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) prescribed 
at discharge from [ADDRESS_970868] prescribing guidelines. Interestingly, the authors reported no increase in refill rates, 
suggesting that the change largely reduced the amount of unused med ication.21   
  
At our own center we reported that the number of OMEs prescribed at discharge was not predictive 
of patients requesting a refill of their medication. We instead found that patients with lower pain 
scores on postoperative day #1, but not postoperative day # 2, had a lower risk of requiring a refill 
of their pain medication.11 We hypothesized that patients who developed an early reliance on 
narcotics would be harder to wean from the medication and be at a greater risk of long -term opi[INVESTIGATOR_173942]. Due to this we be gan to utilize an adductor canal pain catheter for total knee arthroplasty 
patients to provide improved pain control early in the postoperative period. Following adoption of 
the adductor canal catheter we reported a subsequent 43% decrease with in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_713261].10 
Building upon this we then completed a prospective, randomized, double -blinded, placebo -
controlled trial comparing our multimodal regimen with and without schedule II narcotics 
(oxycodone). In that study we demonstrated equivalent pain sco res between the narcotic and 
placebo group when using a continuous infusion adductor canal pain catheter. The narcotic group, 
however, had a higher proportion of patients that required pain medication at 60 days 
postoperatively ( submitted for publication ). 
 
Our goal is to expand upon our previous work and evaluate the safety and efficacy of differing 
modes of medication delivery with the adductor catheter in order to further optimize postoperative 
pain control ( Aim 1 ). It is hypothesized that intermittent bolus infusions of the medication will 
provide improved pain control when compared to a continuous infusion due to the ability to more 
completely saturate the surrounding anatomy in cases where the catheter is not pl aced in the 
optimal location adjacent to th e nerve.  We additionally intend to compare the use of patient -
administered dosing ( Aim 2 ) and overall duration of narcotic use between cohorts (Aim 3 ).

2 Study Objectives  
Primary Objective  
 
The primary objective will be to compare postoperative pain levels between the treatment groups, 
using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).  
 
 
Secondary Objective  
 
The secondary objectives will be to compare the amount of patient -administered medication use 
between groups as well as duration of narcotic use between groups.  
 
[ADDRESS_970870] will be condu cted as a three -arm double -blinded, randomized controlled trial 
comparing differing modes of medication dispersion using the adductor canal pain catheters. The 
three arms will be a single shot adductor canal block (with saline filled  catheter ) compared to 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.2% continuous infusion, and ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.2% intermittent bolus infusions. 
Treatment groups will be assigned to patients using computer -based randomization via the 
dynamic allocation method of Pocock and Simon. Subje cts will be screened in the outpatient clinic 
setting and those interested and eligible will be consented and enrolled in the trial.

  CONFIDENTIAL  surgery and bolused with 10 mL of 0.5 % ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] . The pumps will be loaded with saline (single 
shot adductor canal group) , or ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.2%,  dispersed in either a continuous infusion (6 
mL/hr)  or pulsed intermittent bolus (8 mL every 2 hours). All  groups will have a patient demand 
dose of 6 mL/hr for anterior knee pain. The medication for the adductor catheter will be dispersed 
to the anesthesia team by [CONTACT_56636]. The anesthesia team will place the catheter under 
ultrasound guidance in the recovery room. They will adjust the delivery mode based on patient 
randomization. The anesthesia team will record the serial number of the pump at the time of 
placement.  
 
Questionnaires will be sent electronically to the patient. Results will be collected daily for [ADDRESS_970872] pain and KOOS Jr. scores. The questionnaires will be sent in the morning; if a 
patient fails to fill out the questionnaire by [CONTACT_713277], a member of the research team will 
contact [CONTACT_713278]. The questionnaires will document numerical rating scale 
(NRS) pain scores, information on symptoms  of nausea, vomiting, and constipation, and will 
inquire if the patient is still consuming narcotic medication.  
 
Following discon tinuation of the catheter  the patient will remove and return the device to the 
supplier. The supplier will then provide the rate of on -demand usage to the research team by [CONTACT_713279]. This information will be stored in Redcap.  
 
Subjects will be withdrawn prior to completion if they ask to be removed from the study. They 
may also be withdrawn from the study if they have a serious adverse reaction to one of the 
prescribed medications. Finally, subjects may be withdrawn at the discr etion of the treating 
physician. If subjects are withdrawn early their last recorded pain score will be carried forward 
until study conclusion in order to perform intention to treat analysis. The study will continue to 
ascertain duration of narcotic use wi th weekly questionnaires, until the patient has stopped the 
medication.

6 Study Procedures  
 
6.1 Visit 1  
 
At visit #[ADDRESS_970880] (continuous or ordinal endpoints) or Fisher’s exact test 
(categorical endpoints).  Missing data will be imputed using either the last observation carried 
forward method, a regression -based approach, or another method, depe nding on the extent of 
missing data. In order to adjust for the three pair -wise comparisons between treatment groups that 
will be made for each endpoint, we will utilize a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, after 
which p-values of < 0.0167 will be considered as statistically significant. All statistical tests will 
be two -sided.  
 
Primary Hypothesis:   
 
We hypothesize that the intermittent bolus infusion cohort will report improved pain scores 
compared to continuous infusion catheters and placebo cohorts.  
 
Secondary Hypothesis:    
 
We hypothesize that the intermittent bolus cohort will require fewer doses of patient -administered 
medication and will use narcotic medication for a shorter duration when compared to the 
continuous infusion and placebo groups.   
 
Interim Analysis  
 
We will evaluate the first twenty patients. If 50% of the patients are withdrawn from the study 
for poor pain control or serious adverse reactions to the study medication, then we will close the 
study early.  
 
Adductor Catheter Efficacy Following Total Knee Arthroplasty  Version 3.[ADDRESS_970881] Population(s) for Analysis  
All patients who completed the study will be included in the final analysis. Additionally, we will 
note patient withdrawal rates as well as the reasons for patient withdrawal.  
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
● Serious : Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be 
physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the 
subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: ( 1) 
death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or 
prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) 
breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. 
publications, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_274921], safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or 
substantially compromise the research data, AND  
● Unanticipated : (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already 
described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is 
"unanticipated" whe n it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or 
event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased 
severity than expected, AND  
● Related : A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research procedures.  
 
Adverse Event  
An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e.  drug, 
device, biologic) in a patient or research subject.  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  Serious problems/events can be well 
defined and include;  
● death  
● life threatening adverse experience  
● hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
● inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity  
● persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
● birth defect/anomaly  
 
and/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_37021] -investigator 
may have adversely affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or 
substantially compromised the research data.  
 
 
Adductor Catheter Efficacy Following Total Knee Arthroplasty  Version 3.4 
    
Page 20 of 27 
  CONFIDENTIAL  All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious, should be regarded as non-
serious adverse events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
 
For this study the follow -up period is defined as 2 weeks following the surgical procedure.  
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the 
condition worsens during the study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that 
meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and docum ented as an adverse 
event.   
 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_456] -investigator until the events are 
resolved, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last 
scheduled visit, the sponsor -investigator should instruc t each subject to report, to the sponsor -
investigator, any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, 
believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if the post -treatment 
liver or renal function labs demonstrate a significant elevation from the recorded baseline value.  
 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_202110] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in 
this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be document ed as an adverse event 
if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances: Elective surgical procedures.

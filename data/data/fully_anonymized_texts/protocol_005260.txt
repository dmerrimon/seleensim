 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
Alzheimer ’s disease (AD) is a  progressive neurodege nerative disorder. Its clinical features  
include cognitive dysfunction, memory abnormalities, progressive impairment in activities o f 
daily living (ADL), and a host of behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms 
(Cummings  2004 ; Lyketsos et al. 2011 ). While the diagnostic criteria for AD focus mostly on 
the related cognitive deficits, it is the behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms that are  
most troublesome for caregivers and lead to poor quality of life for patients 
(Herrmann  and Lanct ot 2007 ). These symptoms include agitation, aggres sive behaviors, and 
psychosis. Agitation and aggression are a major cause of acute care inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] 
(Soto et al. 2012 ) and pose a major challenge for AD patient care. Antipsychotics are 
frequ ently used, with limited efficacy and associated long -term safety risks. Considering the 
large number of AD patients, the increasing incidence, and the high prevalence of agitation  in 
later stages of the disease, this unmet need for safe and effective trea tments has a major 
public health impact ( Peters et al. 2015 ). 
Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are now considered as core features of AD and may occur 
at any stage of the disease. Approximately 90% of AD patients develop NPS over the course 
of their disease  (Lyketsos et al. 2002 ; Di Iulio et al. 2010 ). Neuropsychiatric symptoms are 
frequently associated with increased morbidity and are a leading cause of nursing home 
placement ( Steele et al. 1990 ; Cohen -Mansfield et al. 1989 ). The prevalence of NPS 
increases  and symptom profile evolves with disease progression ( Lopez et al. 2003 ). 
Alzheimer ’s disease patients with mild dementia often present with depression, anxiety, 
apathy, and irritability ( Feldman et al. 2004 ), while patients in the advanced stages can 
exhibit agitation/aggression, delusions, hallucina tions, and disinhibition ( Lopez et al.  2003;  
Rockwood et al.  2015 ). 
Agitation is one of the most troublesome dementia symptoms, characterized by [CONTACT_149710], vocal, or motor activity that can be independent of perceptible needs or confusion 
(Cohen -Mansfield and Billig  1986 ; Cummings et al. 2015 b). These verbal and physical 
behaviors can deviate from social norms and include irrelevant vocalizations, screaming, 
cursing, restlessness, wandering, str ange movements, and handling things inappropriately 
(Cohen -Mansfield et al. 1995 ). Such disruptive behaviors are a major source of stress for 
caregivers and loved ones and take a significant toll over time. Thus, the detection, 
management, and treatment of  NPS including agitation, is critical in AD patient care 
(Lyketsos et al. 2006 ). 
In North America, there are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of agitation and/or 
aggression in AD. In the European Union (EU), risperidone is indicated for the short -term 
treatment of persistent aggression with a limited indication ( Janssen -Cilag Ltd 2015 ). Since Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0

Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 17 of 117
 NPS, especially agitation and aggression, are a major challenge in AD patient care, 
antipsychotics are frequently used off -label, despi[INVESTIGATOR_149652]-term safety risks ( Salzman et al. 2008 ). Antidepressants are also frequently used in the 
management of NPS in AD, despi[INVESTIGATOR_149653] ( Finkel 2 004; Koppel et al. 
2014 ; Teri et al. 2000 ). Adverse effects related to antipsychotics can include sedation, 
parkinsonism, gait disturbances, peripheral edema, chest infections, pneumonia, 
thromboembolic events, stroke , and death. M eta-analyses have confirm ed this adverse events 
(AEs) pattern to be associated with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_149654] a marked increase in the risk of stroke and mortality ( Ballard and Howard  2006 ). 
In addition, a doubling in the expected rate of cognit ive deterioration was reported in a 2-year 
prospective, longitudinal study among patients treated with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709] 
(McShane  et al. 2006 ). Moreover, a retrospective cohort study reported that traditional 
antipsychotics are as likely as atypi[INVESTIGATOR_149655] ( Wang et al. 2005 ). 
Approved drugs for symptomatic treatment of A D have limited benefit on NPS. 
Cholinesterase inhibitors appear to have a small but measurable effect on depression, 
dysphoria , apathy/indifference, and anxiety but are probably not an effective short -term 
treatment for agitation or aggression ( Gauthier et al. 2002 ). Memantine has shown 
inconsistent benefits in the treatment of irritability, agitation/aggression, and psychosis in  AD 
patients ( Gauthier et al. 2008 ; McShane et al. 2006; Wilcock et al. 2008 ). However, 
well-controlled randomized trials in moderate to severe AD patients with clinically 
significant agitation did not demonstrate a reduction in agitation with memantine 
(Ballard  et al. 2015 ; Fox et al. 2012 ). Anticonvulsants, including valproic acid, have not 
shown positive results in recent studies ( Amann et al. 2009 ; Tariot et al. 2005 ; 
Tariot  et al. 2011 ). Citalopram has been shown to be effective in the treatment of agitation 
and aggression in AD, but can have significant safety concerns including QT prolongation 
and impaired cognition ( Porsteinsson et al. 2014 ). An early clinical trial of 
dextromethorphan/quinidine s howed improvement in agitation in patients with AD 
(Cummings et al. 2015 a), but there may be safety concerns with quinidine including drug 
interactions and QT prolongation.  
Therefore, there remains an urgent clinical priority for effective and safe treatments of NPS 
in AD, including treatment of agitation/aggression. Ongoing efforts for identifying novel 
pharmacological treatments for AD agitation and aggression include development of 
non-dopaminergic, non -cholinergic, 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5 -HT 2A) receptor blocking 
compounds. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_149656] a highly selective inverse agonist of

1.1 Investigational Drug  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] (pi[INVESTIGATOR_149641], or ACP -103) is the tartrate salt o f the active moiety 
urea, N-[(4-fluorophenyl)methyl] -N-(1-methyl -4-pi[INVESTIGATOR_33214]) -N’-[[4-(2-
methylpropoxy)phenyl]methyl] -,(2R, 3R)-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioate (2:1) and is a novel  
small molecule designed to specifically block serotoninergic neurotransmission mediated by 
[CONTACT_941] 5-HT 2A receptor.  At higher doses pi[INVESTIGATOR_149657] 5HT 2C receptors 
(Vanover  et al. 2006 ). Polymorphisms of serotonin receptors and transporters have been 
implicated in AD agitation ( Cummings and Zhong  2006 ). 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_149658], adrenergic, histaminergic, or 
muscarinic receptors. Activity at these receptors has been implicated in a range of dose -
limiting side effects as sociated with existing antipsychotic drugs including cognitive dulling 
(Saeedi et al. 2006 ; Mehta et al. 2004 ; Peretti et al. 1997 ) and an increased risk of mortality 
in elderly patients with dementia ( Wang et al. 2005 ). On the basis of its novel receptor 
binding profile, pi[INVESTIGATOR_149659], and 
may have added benefits in regard to overall tolerability relative to other antipsychotic 
agents.

 included dyspepsia, nausea, constipation, and vomiting; severe nausea and vomiting were 
dose limiting in a few cases. Reported psychiatric conditions included such even ts as 
agitation, insomnia, and confusional state. In controlled studies of pi[INVESTIGATOR_149660], the most frequent TEAEs experienced by [CONTACT_149711][INVESTIGATOR_4256] [ADDRESS_172503] infection (UTI) (7.4% 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34 mg vs. 6.9% placebo), nausea (6.9% pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34 mg vs. 4.3% placebo), 
peripheral edema (6.9% pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34 mg, 2.2% placebo), fall (6.4% pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34 mg 
vs. 9.1% placebo), and confusional state (5 .9% pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34 mg vs. 2.6% placebo). In the 
long-term open -label studies in subjects with PDP, the most frequent AEs include fall 
(29.3%), UTI (18.5%), hallucination (14.5%), decreased weight (12.4%), and confusional 
state (11.0%). It is difficult to interpret these incidence rates in the absence of a concurrent 
control group, but the overall incidence appears within what would be expected in subjects 
with the underlying neurodegenerative disease, psychosis, and advanced age.  
Clinical and non -clinical safety pharmacology studies of pi[INVESTIGATOR_149661] a potential 
risk for QT prolongation. The magnitude of effect in humans has been assessed in a thorough  
QT study with doses of pi[INVESTIGATOR_149662] 17 to 68 mg and in the Phase 3 PDP 
program with a c linical dose of 34 mg. There was observed an average prolongation of 
approximately 5 -8 milliseconds ( ms). No clinically significant patterns have been observed in 
serious adverse events (SAEs) and there has been no evidence of pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] -related 
laborato ry abnormalities. As of [ADDRESS_172504] died during study 
participation with the majority of deaths considered not related or unlikely related to study 
drug. Five of these deaths occurred in 6 -week double -blind studies ([ADDRESS_172505] received 8.5 mg pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256], and 3 subjects received 34 mg 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256]), and 62 deaths occurred in the multi -year, long -term open -label extension 
studies where the majority of subjects ha d been treated with pi[INVESTIGATOR_149663]

3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Overall Study Design  
This study is an open -label extension study of the safety and tolerability of pi[INVESTIGATOR_149672] 
(McKhann  et al. 2011 ). This  study will be conducted as a 52-week , open -label, flexible -dose 
extension of Study ACP -103-032. Subjects in Study ACP -103-[ADDRESS_172508] meet eligibility criteria.  Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0
Date: [ADDRESS_172509]  be consented prior to the final procedures being  
performed for Study ACP -103-032 at Week 12. Procedures from the Week 12 visit of 
Study ACP -103-032 will be carried over to the ACP -103-033 study to be include d as baseline 
information and this visit  will be considered the Baseline Visit (Visit 1)  of the ACP -103-033 
study.  
Study periods:  
 Open -label treatment  period  (Baseline  through 52 weeks  of treatment ) 
 Safety follow -up period (~ [ADDRESS_172510] dose of study drug) 
Treatment Period  (Baseline through Week 52) 
All subjects will receive once daily (QD) doses of pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] (active study drug) over 
52 week s of treatment, starting with 20  mg a day.  At the Week 2 visit, the  pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 
20 mg dose may be increased to 34 mg a day based on the Investigator ’s assessment  of 
clinical response. The Investigator may then adjust the dose from 20 mg to 34 mg or from 
34 mg to 20 mg at any visit based on clinical response. A dose change at a time other than at 
a scheduled clinic visit will require an unscheduled visit to dispense the a ppropriate dose of 
study drug. Unscheduled clinic visits may occur as needed.  
During the Treatment Period, clinic visits will be conducted at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 
12, 20, 28, 36, 44, and 52, or upon early termination (ET) from the s tudy.  
It is recommended that the study drug  be taken at approximately the same time each day.   
Doses of concomitant or over -the-counter medications s hould not exceed those  indicated for 
Permitted and Prohibited Concomitant Therapy and Rescue Medication  (see Section 5.6).  
Follow -up of Study  Completers  
A follow -up safety assessment will be conducted via telephone approximately [ADDRESS_172511] dose of study drug for s ubjects  who complete the 52-week  treatment period  and for 
those who discontinue  prematurely from the study . 
3.1.1 Study Duration  
The duration of participation for individual subjects will be up to approximately 56 weeks : 
each subject will participate in a 52-week  treatment period  followed by [CONTACT_149713] 
30-day follow -up period.  The end of the clinical trial will be when the last subject completes 
the last scheduled assessment (i .e., 30-day follow -up). Study: ACP-103-033

 3.2 Dose Rationale  
In previous studies of pi[INVESTIGATOR_149673], a dose of 34  mg of pi[INVESTIGATOR_149674] a consistent signal of efficacy across a number of measures, including the 
Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS ), Clinical Global Impression - 
Improvement (CGI-I), Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson 's disease -Sleep Scale  
(SCOPA -Sleep) nighttime sleep measure and caregiver burden scale. Additionally, long -term 
open -label studies of pi[INVESTIGATOR_149675] t hat pi[INVESTIGATOR_149676] 34 mg and 51 mg.  Parkinson ’s disease  and AD have similar 
neuropsychiatric symptoms that include psychosis, agitation , and other behavioral problems 
that can have a heterogeneous presentation . These symptom s can be responsive to treatment 
with antipsychotics ; pi[INVESTIGATOR_149677]. Thus, a dose of 34 mg 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_149678] e in the treatment of PDP 
(Cummings  et al. 2014 ) is included as the high dose in this study.  A dose of [ADDRESS_172512] may be enrolled in the study  at a site , ACADIA and/or designee must obtain 
a copy of essential documents  for that site  including the following:  
 Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC) approval of the protocol  
 IRB- or EC -approved Informed Consent  Form (ICF)  
 Financial disclosure form(s), as applicable  
 Other documents required by [CONTACT_427], as applicable  
Each subject and their study partner/ caregiver  must sign the approved ICF prior to enrolling 
in the study . Each subject will have the same subject identification number in this study as 
they did  in Study ACP -103-032. Study: ACP-103-033

5.6 Concomitant Medications  
All ongoing  concomitant medications will be captured from the preceding double -blind study 
(ACP -103-032) and will be recorded from  Baseline through  the EOS/ET visit . 
In order to ensure that appropriate concomitant therapy is administered, it is essential that 
subjects be instructed not to take any medication without prior consultation with the 
Investigator.  
The Investigator may prescribe, adjust, or disco ntinue appropriate medication to treat or 
manage AEs. The Sponsor and Investigator will confer to determine whether it is appropriate 
to continue such a subject in the trial if a prohibited medication is prescribed.  
Subjects who take prohibited concomitant  medications during the trial will be discontinued, 
unless the discontinuation presents an unacceptable medical risk. The justification to allow 
the subject to continue in the trial will be made by [CONTACT_149717], and will be documented.  If allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as 
a major protocol deviation and not a waiver.  All follow -up safety assessments must be 
completed and documented as outlined in the protocol.

6 EFFICACY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
6.1 Efficacy Assessments  
The following efficacy endpoints wil l be assessed in this study using the measures described 
in this section: CMAI, ZBI, NPI-C, MMSE, mADCS -CGIC, KSS, and ADCS -ADL.  
Of the measures listed in the following sections, the CMAI  should be completed first, followed 
by [CONTACT_149720].  For each scale, the time period assessed will be from 
the time of the last scheduled assessment.  All Baseline assessments that are referred to in the 
following sections will be carried over from the Week 12 visit of Study ACP -103-032, where 
applicable.  
6.1.1 Cohen -Mansfield Agitation Inventory  
The CMAI was developed to assess the frequency of manifestations of agitated behaviors in 
elderly persons ( Cohen -Mansfield 1989 ; see Appendix D). 
The CMAI is a 29 -item scale designed to systematically assess agitation, rated on a 7 point 
(1-7) scale of frequency. Subjects are rated by [CONTACT_149721], physically non -aggressive and 
verbally agitated behaviors. The CMAI may be self -administered (by a caregiver) or , as in 
this study,  it may be completed by [CONTACT_30230]. Ratings are inclusive of the 2 or 4 weeks  prior 
to the administration of the scale. Separate scores for agitation and aggression behaviors can 
be derived from the CMAI in addition to the total score.  
The CMAI will be performed at Baseline (Day 1)  and at all scheduled clinic visits . 
6.1.2 Zarit Burden I nterview  
The ZBI was designed to assess the stresses experienced by [CONTACT_149722] ( Zarit et al.  1980 ; see Appendix E). The ZBI can be self -reported or , as in this 
study,  administered as an interview. Caregivers are ask ed to respond to a series of 
[ADDRESS_172535] of the patient ’s disabilities on their life. For each item, 
caregivers are to indicate how often they felt that way (never, rarely, sometimes, quite 
frequently, or nearly always). The ZBI will be administered a t Baseline (Day 1) and at 
Weeks  2, 4, 8, 12 , 20, 28, 36, 44, and 52  (EOS/ET) .  Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0

Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 37 of 117
 Note: Professional caregiver s do not complete this form .  
6.1.3 Neuropsychiatric Inventory  – Clinician Rating  Scale  
The NPI -C (de Medeiros et al. 2010 ) was developed to assess psychopathology in patients 
with dementia  (Appendix F). The NPI -C evaluates NPS across multiple behavioral domains, 
as in the NPI  (Cummings et al. 1994 ), as a standalone  measure for specific NPS domai ns 
(e.g., dysphoria, agitation),  or as a comb ination of both (presence of NPS across domains 
plus particular focus on one or more specific domains) . The score of each item, if present, is 
clinically evaluated based on the symptom frequency , severity /intensity, and distress of a 
behavior . Multiple behaviors within a category are rated and included in the score. The 
NPI-C version of the NPI  [INVESTIGATOR_149686] a professional caregiver or other involved person as 
long as they have detailed knowledge of the subject ’s behavior.  If a subject is not able to 
provide reliable information (e .g., due to cognitive impairment, or is uncooperative), the 
NPI-C should be rated by [CONTACT_149723].  
The complete NPI -C (i.e., all domains) will be performed at Baseline, Weeks 12, 28, and 
52 (i.e., Visits 1, 5, 7, and 10 [EOS/ET ]). The agitation and aggression domains of the NPI -C 
alone will be performed at Weeks 2,  4, and 8 (i.e., Visits 2, 3, and 4). 
6.1.4 Mini –Mental State Examination  
The MMSE is a brief 30 -point questionnaire that is used to quantitatively assess cognition 
(Folstein et al. 1975 ; see Appendix G). The MMSE includes simple questions and problems 
in a number of areas: the time and place of the test, repeating lists of words, arithmetic, 
language use and comprehension, and copying a d rawing. It can be used to screen for 
cognitive impairment, to estimate the severity of cognitive impairment at a given point in 
time, to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time, and to document 
an individual ’s response to treatmen t. The MMSE will be administered at Baseline  (Visit 1)  
and at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, and 52 ( i.e., Visits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 [EOS/ET ]). 
6.1.5 Modified Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study - Clinical Global Impression -
Change  
The mADCS -CGIC  scale ( Schneider et al. 1997 ) will be used to allow the Investigator to 
determine the subjec t’s overall clinical condition as it relates to their symptoms of agitation 
and aggression, and to address the clinical significance of changes from Baseline in other 
psychometric measures  (Appendix H). The mADCS -CGIC interview will be performed by 
[CONTACT_29517] a medically qualified rater . After completion of the interview, the rater will 
be asked to rate the subject ’s symptoms of agitation and aggression relative to the Baseline Study: ACP-103-033

 interview  from the parent study (ACP -103-032), using a standardized 7 -point 
scale (1=marked improvement to 7 =marked worsening).  
The mADCS -CGIC will be administered at Baseline (Visit 1) and at all scheduled clinic 
visits . 
6.1.6 Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Inventory  
The ADCS -ADL  is an inventory to assess activities of daily living in subject s with AD 
(Galasko et al. 1997 ; see Appendix I). This is a caregiver -rated  questionnaire that includes 
[ADDRESS_172536]  ADLs. The instrument assesses functional capacity acr oss a large 
spectrum of dementia severity.  The A DCS -ADL will be administered at Base line (Visit  1) 
and at Weeks 12, 28, and 52 ( i.e., Visits 5, 7, and 10 [EOS/ET] ). 
6.1.[ADDRESS_172537]'s level of  drowsiness  
(Akerstedt  and  Gillberg  2009 ; Johns  2009 ; see Appendix J). With the modified version 
(Geiger Brown et  al. 2014 ) respondents must choose which of [ADDRESS_172538] accurately 
describes their level of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_149687] a period of time, which for this  study will be “on 
average over the previous week” (see Appendix J ). The KSS will be administered at Baseline  
(Visit 1)  and at Weeks 12, 28 , and 52 (i.e., Visits 5, 7, and 10 [EOS/ET] ).

6.2.3 Physical Examinations  
Physical and neurological examinations will be conducted at Baseline (Visit 1) and Week s 12 
and 52 (i.e., Visits 5 and 10  [EOS/ET] ). The examinations may include a review of all body 
systems (urogenital exam ination  is required only if indicated) and should  include a 
neurological examination (e.g.,  level of consciousness, speech, cranial nerves [including 
pupil equality and reactivity], motor assessment, sensory assessment, coordination, gait, 
reflexes, and Romberg test ). 
6.2.4 Vital Signs

6.2.9 Suicidal Ideation and Behavior  
The Global Clinician Assessment of Suicidality (GCAS) will be used to assess the occurrence 
of treatment -emergent suicidal ideation and behavior.  
The GCAS is a  clinician -rated, [ADDRESS_172542]’s suicidality 
based on the report of the subject, the report of the study partner/caregiver, and the clinician’s 
global assessment. Ratings can be 0 (Absent), 1 (Feels life is not worth l iving), 2  (Wishes 
he/she were dead or any thoughts of possible death to self), 3 (Suicidal ideas or gesture), or 
4 (Attempt at suicide). The Investigator will record a subject rating, a partner/caregiver 
rating, and a clinician rating. For a rating of 3 or  4 based on the clinician ’s assessment,  the 
date of event will be  recorded. At each visit, suicidality since the previous visit will be 
assessed.   
7 ADVERSE EVENTS/SERIO US ADVERSE EVENTS AN D REPORTING  
7.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events occurring after the completion of procedures at the Week 12 visit in the 
double -blind Study ACP -103-032 will be recorded in the open -label Study ACP -103-033. 
Adverse events  during ACP -103-033 will be recorded through the follow -up safety 
assessment (conduc ted by [CONTACT_65859]) approximately [ADDRESS_172543] dose of  
open -label  study drug. All ongoing AEs from Study ACP -103-032 will be carried over and 
will be recorded from Baseline until resolution, or through the Week 52 ( EOS/ET ) visit. All Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0
Date: [ADDRESS_172544] be either resolved or stable at the Week 52 ( EOS /ET) visit . For those that are 
ongoing at the end of the study , the subject should be referred for appropriate treatment.  
7.2 Definition  of Adverse Events  
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related ” (CDER  2012 ). 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any 
judgment about causality or seriousness. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., 
off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, 
formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
An adverse reaction means any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all  
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the 
event.  
Suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the adverse event.  
AEs do not include the following:  
 Stable or intermittent chronic conditions (such as myopia requiring eyeglasses) that a re 
present prior to baseline  and do not worsen during the study  
 Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion). The condition that leads to the procedure is an AE if not present at 
baseline.  
 Overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or 
symptoms unless the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913]  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120004] (situation where an 
untoward medical occurrence has not occurred)  
 Pregnancy will not be considered an AE, and if it occurs, it will be reported on a 
pregnancy form.  
When possible, clinical AEs should be described by [CONTACT_149724] (e.g ., 
“cold” or “seasonal allergies ” instead of “runny nose ”). 
All AEs, whether or not related to the study drug , must be fully and completely docume nted 
on the AE eCRF and in the subject ’s notes. The description of each AE should use the 
following definition s: Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0
Date: 30 November 2017
Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 43 of 117
 Severity  
The severity of each AE will be graded on a  3-point scale and reported in detail as indicated 
on the  eCRF : 
 Mild : awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with normal everyday activities  
 Moderate : sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
 Severe : incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities  
Relationship to Investigational Drug  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by [CONTACT_149725] “related ” or 
“not related. ” An event is considered related  if there is “a reasonable possibility ” that t he 
event may have been caused by [CONTACT_95107] (i.e., there are facts, 
evidence, or arguments to suggest possible causati on). 
Consider the following when assessing causality:  
 Temporal associations between the agent and the event,  
 Response to c essation (de -chall enge) or re -challenge,  
 Compatibility with known class effect,  
 Known effects of concomitant medications,  
 Pre-existing  risk factors,  
 A plausible mechanism, and  
 Concurrent illnesses.  
Duration  
The duration of the AE should be recorded using the following criteria:  
 Start:  Date of the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_149688]

different since your last visit? ”) to assess  whether any AEs have been experienced s ince the  
last report or visit.  
Note that any use of medication (and specifically any newly prescribed medication) during 
the course of a study may indicate the occurrence of an AE that may need to be recorded on 
both the AE eCRF and the concomitant medication  page.  Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0
Date: [ADDRESS_172546] current version of the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE eCRF page using appropriate 
medical terminology. Severity and relationship to study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_149726].  
7.3 Serious Adverse Events and Unexpected Adverse Events  
In addition to the severity rating, each AE will be classified by [CONTACT_5256] “serious” 
or “not serious. ” The seriousness of  an event will be defined according to the applicable 
regulations and generally refers to the outcome of an event. An SAE is one that meets one o r 
more of the following:  
 Is fatal,  
 Is immediately life threatening,  
 Results  in disability or permanent damage,  
 Requires  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  
 Prolongs  existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in an offspring),  or 
 Is medically significant.  
Definition of Life Threatening  
A life threatening event p laces the subject at immediate  risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. This does not include an AE, which, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death.  
Definition of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149690] a full admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l for diagnosis and 
treatment . This includes prolongation of an existing in -patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Examples of visits to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149691]:  
 Emergency room visits (that do not result in a full hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063])  
 Outpatient  surgery  
 Preplanned or elective procedures (see  Section  7.3.1 ) 
 Protocol procedures  Study: ACP-103-033
Protocol Amendment 3Final Version: 1.0
Date: 30 November 2017
Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 46 of 117
  Social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], defined as inadequate family s upport or care at the subject's 
primary residence that results in the subject being admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149692] a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions.  
Definition of Medically Significant  
Important medical events (medically significant events) that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149693], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of  
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for aller gic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149694].  
An SAE may also include any other event that the Investigator or Medical Monitor judges to 
be serious or that suggests  a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution.  
Definition of Unexpectedness  
An AE, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product informati on. 
7.3.1 Elective Procedures and Surgeries  
For the purposes of this p rotocol, the following conventions will apply for SAE reporting of 
elective procedures and surgeries:  
A prescheduled elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment is not to be considere d 
an SAE, even if the subject  is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], provided the sit e stipulates that:  
 The condition requiring the prescheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress between the subject ’s 
consent to participate in the clinical trial and the time of the procedu re or treatment,  
 The prescheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment is the sole 
reason for admission and intervention.  
An untoward medical event occurring during the prescheduled elective procedure or 
routinely scheduled treatment should be recorded as an AE or an SAE. Any concurrent 
medications should also be recorded on the eCRF.  Study: ACP-103-033

 7.4 Other Reportable Information  
In addition, and for the purposes of monitoring, the following should be reported via the AE, 
SAE, and/or Pregnancy reporting forms , as appropriate:  
 Instances of overdose of study drug (where there are associated symptoms ) (see 
Section  5.3 for definition of overdose);  
 Any occurrence of pregnancy (with or without AEs).  
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be withdrawn from the study and 
will be followed through  the first well -baby [CONTACT_765] . Women of childbearing potential are 
permitted in this study. Women of non -childbearing potential are defined as those who have 
been postmenopausal for at least [ADDRESS_172547] undergone bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and /or have both ovaries removed.  
7.5 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is a serious adverse reaction 
assessed as unexpected by [CONTACT_149727] a reasonable causal relationship to a medical product.  
7.5.1 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The reporting of SAEs by [CONTACT_149728] a regulatory requirement. 
Each Regula tory Authority has established a timetable for reporting SAEs ba sed upon 
established criteria.  
Serious AEs and Other Reportable Information ( Sections  7.3 and 7.4) must be reported 
within 24 hours of discov ery to ACADIA or its designee. The SAE (initial and/or follow -up), 
pregnancy, new diagnosis of cancer, or overdose of study drug must be reported within 
24 hours by [CONTACT_149729], SAE, and/or Pregnancy forms, as appropriate (refer to the 
Study Reference Manual  for details).  
At a minimum, events identified by [CONTACT_149730], 
unexpected, and possibly related to study drug must be brought to the at tention of the 
responsible IRB/ EC. For EU member states, ACADIA or its designee will provide reports of 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs directly to the ECs, as required by [CONTACT_19666]. In all other countries, it is the 
Investigator’s responsibility to provide these expedited reports to the responsible IRB/ EC. It 
is also the Investigator’s responsibility  to notify the responsible IRB/ EC regard ing any new 
and significant safety information.  
For this study , sites will complete the paper  SAE, overdose, and/or pregnancy form (for 
initial and/or follow -up information), including available supporting documentation relevant Study: ACP-103-033

designated on the SAE form provided to the sites.  
Subjects will be followed until EOS/ET for any SAEs and/or other reportable information or 
until such events have resolved or the Investigator, in conjunction with ACADIA, deems 
them to be chronic or stable.  
In the event of any SAE (other than death), the study subject will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_3786] (or designee) using the telephone number provided in the ICF. All subjects 
experiencing an SAE will be seen by [CONTACT_149731].  
Serious AEs occurring after the study follow -up period should be reported if in the judgmen t 
of the Investigator there is “a reasonable  possibility ” that the event may have been caused  by 
[CONTACT_77425].  
SAEs should also be reported to the IRB /EC according to local regulations.  
7.6 Routine Safety Monitoring  
A Safety Management Team (SMT), internal to ACADIA, will regularly monitor all aspects 
of subject safety throughout this study. The SMT will be comprised of qualified 
representatives from Clinical Development, Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance, and 
Regulatory Affairs, as well as other ad hoc representatives as appropriate. The SMT will me et 
regularly to review all S AEs and will examine aggregate non-serious  AEs, clinical laboratory 
data, and other relevant safety data.  
7.[ADDRESS_172548] who becomes pregnant during the study (with or without AEs) must be 
withdrawn from the study and t he pregnancy must be reported on the pregnancy form. Any 
female subject who becomes pregnant during the study will be followed through the  first 
well-baby [CONTACT_765] . 
Any AEs that are the consequence of pregnancy and which meet the criteria for serious 
(Section  7.3) should also be reported via the SAE forms provided and according to the 
directions in  Section  7.6.

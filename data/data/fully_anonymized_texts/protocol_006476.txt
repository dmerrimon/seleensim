 2 PRÉCIS 
Background:  
• We have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both α and β chains of a 
murine T- cell receptor ( mTCR) that recognizes the NY -ESO -1 (ESO) tumor antigen, 
which can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this TCR with h igh efficiency.  
• In co -cultures with HLA -A2 and ESO double positive tumors, anti- ESO mTCR 
trans duced T- cells secreted significant amount s of IFN -γ with high specificity.  
Objective:  
• Primary objective:  
o To determine whether  the administration of  anti-ESO mTCR -engineered peripheral 
blood lymphocytes (PBL) plus high -dose aldesleukin following a non- myel oablative, 
lymphodepleting preparative regimen may result in objective  tumor regression in 
patients with metastatic cancer  including melanoma expressing the ESO antig en.  
Eligibility:  
• Age ≥ 15 years and ≤ [ADDRESS_922374] 50 kg. 
• HLA -A*0201 positive 
• Metastatic cancer including melanoma whose tumors express the ESO antigen  
• Previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred after receiving standard care for metastatic disease 
• No c ontraindications for high-dose aldesleukin administration  
Design:  
• Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) obtained by [CONTACT_681246]-CD3 (OKT3) and aldesleukin to stimulate T -cell growth.  
• Transduction is initiated by [CONTACT_681247] -ESO mTCR genes.  This mTCR targets the exact same epi[INVESTIGATOR_681223].  
• All patients will receive a non -myeloablative , lymphodepleting preparative regimen of 
cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. 
• On D ay 0, patients will receive anti- ESO mTCR gene -transduced PBMC and then begin 
high-dose aldesleukin.  
• A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted 6 weeks ( ± 2 weeks) 
following the administration of the cell product. 
• The study will be conducted using a phase II optimal design. The  objective will be to 
determine if the treatment regimen  is able to be associated with a clinical response rate 
that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of a modest 20% PR + CR rate (p1=0.20).  
• A total of up to 43 patients may be enrolled (41, plus allowing for up to 2 non- evaluable 
patients).

 7 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1.1 Primary Objective  
• To determine whether the administration of anti -ESO mTCR -engineered peripheral blood 
lymphocytes plus high -dose aldesleukin following a non- myeloablative , lymphodepleting 
preparative regimen may result in objective tumor regression in patients with metastatic 
cancer including melanoma expressing the ESO antigen. 
1.1.2 Secondary Objectives 
• Determine the in vivo survival of TCR gene- engineered cells.  
• Determine the toxicity profile of this treatment re gimen. 
1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.2.1 Adoptive Cell Transfer E xperience at the NCI Surgery Branch  
The National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch ( NCI-SB) has pi[INVESTIGATOR_681224] T- cell based cancer 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_140550] -refractory cancers and continues efforts to  expand their application. 
This work has its foundation in the successful treatment of metastatic cutaneous melanoma with adoptive transfer of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL)
(1). We have reported the results of 
adoptive transfer therapy in 93 patients with metastatic melanoma who received TIL following a lymphodepleting regimen plus aldesleukin administration, with or without total body irradiation (
Figure 1)(2). Forty -three patients received a non -myeloablative chemotherapy consisting of 60 
mg/kg cyclophosphamide daily x 2 and 25mg/m2 fludarabine daily x 5 prior to cell transfer and 
aldesleukin administration. Twenty- five patients each also received the same chemotherapy 
agents in conjunction with either 200 or 1200 cGy total body irradiation (TBI) prior to cell infusion and aldesleukin administration. The overall objective response rate using RECIST criteria in these 93 patients was 56%. The clinical results in these three trials are shown in  
Table 
1. There was one treatment related death in these 93 patients , which occurred in a patient  who 
received 200cGy TBI who had an undetected diverticular abscess prior to beginning therapy. Of 
the 52 responding patients in this trial, 42 had disease that was refractory to aldesleukin therapy and 22 had disease that was refractory to prior aldesleukin plus chemotherapy. Thus, TIL therapy 
shows promise as an effective treatment for chemotherapy refractory metastatic cutaneous melanoma.

Version Date: August 6, [ADDRESS_922382] proteins, T- cells recognize short 
peptide fragments (8-18 amino acids) that are presented on the surface of class I or II major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules and it has been show n that tumor antigens are presented 
and recognized by T -cells in this fashion. The molecule that recognizes these peptide fragments 
is the T -cell receptor (TCR). The TCR is analogous to the antibody immunoglobulin molecule in 
that, two separate proteins (t he TCR alpha and beta chains) are brought together to form the 
functional TCR molecule. The goal of this protocol is to transfer tumor- associated antigen 
(TAA) -reactive TCR genes isolated from mice immunized against the NY -ESO -1 cancer testis 
antigen into normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) derived from cancer patients and to return these engineered cells to patients aimed at mediating regression of their tumors. This trial is similar to previous NCI -SB TCR gene transfer adoptive immunot herapy protocols  using 
human and mouse TCRs. 
1.2.3 NY-ESO -1 as a Target for Cell Transfer Clinical Studies  
The NY -ESO -1 molecule, which was initially identified by [CONTACT_15249] a cDNA expression library 
with an antiserum from a patient with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, represents a tumor 
antigen that can be targeted in patients bearing a wide variety of malignancies
(3). Expression of 
NY-ESO -[ADDRESS_922383], prostate, 
lung ovarian, thyroid and bladder cancer, but is limited in normal tissues to germ cells and trophoblasts
(4). A related cancer/testis antigen, LAGE -1, has also been identified and shown to 
possess 84% amino acid similarity to the NY -ESO -1 protein(5). Further studies resulted in the 
identification of an identical peptide corresponding to amino acids 157 to 165 of the NY- ESO -1 
and LAGE -1 proteins SLLMWITQC as a dominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_681225]- A2 restricted, 
NY-ESO -1 reactive T -cells(6). An HLA- A2 restricted epi[INVESTIGATOR_681226] t he NY -ESO -1 and LAGE-1 transcripts has also 
been described(7) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_681227]- A31 have  been described(8). In addition, NY- ESO -1 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_681228](9-11).  
Utilizing modifications to a human anti -ESO TCR directed against the dominant NY- ESO -
1:157-165 T- cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230], a Phase II clinical trial (08 -C-0121) was opened for accrual in April 
[ADDRESS_922384] time 
with the anti- ESO TCR . Patients were entered into 4 cohorts. Cohorts 1 and 3 include patients 
with metastatic melanoma or renal cell cancer; cohort s [ADDRESS_922385] cancer.  The vaccine was supplied by [CONTACT_681248]:  Anti- NY-ESO-1 mTCR PBL  
Version Date: August 6, 2018  
 10 withdrew the supply. There were no apparent effects of the vaccine and it is no longer available.  
The combined responses to the rapy are shown in Table 2.

This regimen (08-C-0121) resulted in objective cancer regression in 50% ( 9/18) patients with 
melanoma, 4  of whom are ongoing, and in 63% (10 /16) patients with synovial sarcoma 3  of 
which are ongoing. Non-hematologic and hematologic toxicities were those expected from IL -2 
and the myelosuppressive chemotherapy and none were attributed to any off-tumor target 
toxicity  due to recognition of NY- ESO -1. Grade 2, 3 and 4 toxicities attributable to the anti- ESO 
TCR are shown in Table 3. There were no  mortalities  related to the cell therapy; one patient died 
from sepsis secondary to myelosuppression from the chemotherapy, a second patient developed renal failure due to aldesleukin .

 11 Robbins et al. reported preliminary results from this protocol in March of 2011(12). The clinical 
responses observed in the [ADDRESS_922386] clinical 
trial targeting this antigen. However, given the short duration of some responses seen in the current clinical trial, methods to increase the potential efficacy of the TCR were investigated. One possible reason for decreased efficacy is that by [CONTACT_2359] a TCR, mixed TCR dimers can be formed, which could harbor potentially harmful spe cificities and off -target effects, as well as 
decreasing the TCR expression of both the introduced and endogenous TCRs
(13). Studies have 
shown that the pairing of endogenous and introduced TCR chains in TCR gene-modified T- cells 
can lead to the formation of self -reactive TCRs, leading to  cytokine- driven autoimmune 
pathology in mouse models(14). These toxicities have not been seen in our prior studies targeting 
the same epi[INVESTIGATOR_681229]. Murine-human hybrid TCRs have been investigated as a method to improve the expression of the transduced TCR. These studies demonstrated that  by 
[CONTACT_681249] a murine constant region in place of the human constant region, a higher expression  of the receptors were found on the surface of the human lymphocytes, caused by [CONTACT_681250]
(15). The murine- human TCRs mediated  higher 
levels of cytokine secretion and cell lysis, which was associated with  improved CD3 stability(15).  
To generate high avidity mTCRs against NY -ESO -1 antigen, we employed a transgenic mouse 
model that expresses the human HLA-A*0201 molecule. Transgenic mice expressing the full-lengt h HLA -A*0201 molecule were immunized with a previously identified naturally processed 
and presented HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide from NY- ESO -1 (SLLMWITQC). Following two 
immunizations, murine T -cells were harvested from the spleen and stimulated in vitro  with the 
respective peptide and IL -2. Bulk T- cell cultures were tested for specific reactivity using LPS -
blast cells and T2 cells both pulsed with the relevant peptide after three in vitro  stimulations. 
Reactive T -cells from positive wells from both the first and the third bulk stimulations were then 
cloned by [CONTACT_681251].  
TCR α - and β -chains from each tumor reactive T -cell clone were cloned using SMART
TM RACE 
cDNA amplification kit with gene specific primers in the constant region of mouse TCR α and β -
chains. After the identification of the variable regions of α - and β -chains and the specific 
constant region of the β -chain, specific primers were used to amplify the full length TCR α and 
β-chains from cDNA. The TCR α - and β -chains that showed the highest level of specific 
reactivity were then cloned into an MSGV1- based retroviral vectors with expression cassettes 
consisting of MSGV1 ESO- 157muTCRA2aB and MSGV1 ESO -157 muTCRB2aA ( Figure 2A ). 
The TCR expression in this vector is driven by [CONTACT_681252], α and β chains are expressed as a single open reading frame using the 2A linker peptide
(16, 17). Human PBL were stimulated for 3 
days and then transduced twice. FACS analysis of transduced PBL using the anti-mouse TCR- β 
chain revealed th at both CD8 + and CD4 + cells had been transduced with these TCR vectors 
(Figure 2B ). These transduced PBL were then expanded using our rapid expansion protocol 
(REP), along with the human NY- ESO -1 TCR used in our current clinical trial for comparison. 
The percentage of  transduced cells was evaluated after one stimulation and after REP ( Figure 
2C), which showed an increase in the percentage of positively transduced mTCR cells after REP.

 13 To evaluate the recognition by  [CONTACT_681253] -ESO -1 TCRs, transduced PBL were subjected 
to co -culture assay with peptid e pulsed T2 cells. mTCR transduced PBL specifically secreted 
IFN-γ upon encounter with the antigenic peptide in a dose dependent manner ( Figure 3 ), and at 
higher levels after REP. PBL transduced with the ESO mTCR recognized T2 cells pulsed with as 
little as 0.1 ng/ml NY- ESO -1 peptide indicating that the TCR was a relatively high avidity 
receptor.  To assess the specific recognition of tumor cells, TCR engineered PBL were co -
cultured with a panel of HLA-A*0201 + and HLA-A*0201 - melanoma and lung tumor derived 
cell lines. Specific release of IFN -γ was observed when the TCR engineered PBL were  co-
cultured with HLA- A*0201 +/NY- ESO -1+ cell lines but not HLA -A*0201 -/NY- ESO -1+ or HLA - 
A*0201 +/NY- ESO -1- cell lines ( Figure 4 ). Higher levels of IFN- γ were secreted by [CONTACT_681254]. These cells were also capable of specific cell lysis of HLA -A*0201
+/NY- ESO -1+ tumor cell lines ( Figure 5 ).

Version Date: August 6, [ADDRESS_922387] reconstituted their 
hematopoietic systems.  In October 2017, one patient enrolled to this protocol diagnosed with 
synovial cell sarcoma and extensive lung disease experienced a constellation of toxicities after receiving 69.1x10
9 anti-ESO -1 murine TCR- gene engineered lymphocytes  and one dose 
aldesleukin. Toxicities included mental status changes (somnolence, depressed consciousness), kidney and liver abnormalities, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], and altered heart functioning. The events were determined to be possibly related to anti -ESO -[ADDRESS_922388] administered up to 1.5x10
11 TIL with widely heterogeneous 
reactivity including CD4, CD8, and NK cells without difficulty. As discussed above, the 
expansion of tumor reactive cells is a desirable outcome following the infusion of antigen reactive T -cells. We do not bel ieve the transfer of these gene -modified  cells has a significant risk 
for malignant transformation in this patient population. While the risk of insertional mutagenesis is a known possibility using retroviral vectors, this has only been observed in the setting of infants treated for XSCID , WAS, and X- CGD using retroviral vector- mediated gene transfer into 
CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. In the case of retroviral vector -mediated gene transfer into 
mature T -cells, there has been no evidence of long- term toxicities associated with these 
procedures since the first NCI sponsored gene transfer study in 1989. Although continued follow-up of all gene therapy patients will be required, data suggest that the introduction of retroviral vectors transd uced into mature T -cells is a safe procedure. While we believe the risk of 
insertional mutagenesis is extremely low, the proposed protocol follows all current FDA guidelines regarding testing and follow up of patients receiving gene transduced cells. Murin e 
TCRs have been used in four previous TCR gene therapy trials at the Surgery Branch (04-C-0241, 07-C-0174, 09-C-0047,11-C-0062). The introduction of murine or murinized TCRs and the possibility of immune responses against murine antigens has been studied in two of our clinical trials in which cancer patients were treated with murine TCRs specific for the antigens p53 and gp100; this study found that 23% of patients treated with the mTCRs developed antibodies directed towards the murine variable regions and not to the constant region common to all mTCR
(18). These antibodies were not detected for 3-4 months after cell transfer and t he 
production of these antibodies was not associated with the level of transduced cell  persistence or 
response to therapy.

 Randomization and Arm Assignment 
This is a non-randomized study. All patients will be directly assigned based on cohort as follows: 
• Patients in Cohorts 1-2 will be directly assigned to Arm 1.  
3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION 
3.1 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1.1 Pre-Treatment Phase: Cell Preparation Performed on 03-C-0277 
PBMC will be obtained by [CONTACT_74886] (approxi mately 1x1010 cells ). Whole PBMC will be 
cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and aldesleukin to stimulate T -cell growth. 
Transduction is initiated by [CONTACT_74887] 1x107 to 5x108 cells to supernatant 
containing the anti- ESO ret roviral vector. These transduced cells will be expanded and tested for 
their anti-tumor activity. Successful TCR gene transfer will be determined by [CONTACT_681256]- tumor reactivity will be tested by [CONTACT_681257] T2 cells. Successful TCR gene transfer for each transduced PBL population will be defined as >10% TCR positive cells and for biological activity, gamma- interferon secretion 
must be at least 200  pg/m L. Cells will be administered at a dose of between 1x10
9 to 2x1011 
lymphocytes and will be given over 20-30 minutes. 
3.1.2 Treatment Phase  
The study will be conducted using a Phase II design. Patients will receive up to 2x1011 anti-ESO 
mTCR engineered PBL. A minimum of approximately 1x109 cells will be given. The cells 
administered vary depending on their growth characteristic. The percent of TCR+ cells will be 
recorded for each patient and the number of TCR+ cells administered per kg will be calculated for each patient at the time of the IRB continuing review, the annual report to the FDA, and in 
the event of any serious adverse events related to the cell product.  
Patients will receive no other experimental agents while on this protocol.

 34 5.8 MONITORING GENE THERAPY TRIALS : PERSISTENCE AND RCR  
• Engineered cell survival. TCR and vector presence will be quantitated in PBMC samples 
using established PCR techniques. Immunological monitoring using both tetramer analysis and staining for the TCR will be used to augment PCR- based analysis.  This will 
provide data to estimate the in vivo survival of lymphocytes derived from the infused cells. In addition, measurement of CD4 and CD8 T-cells will be conducted and studies of these T -cell subsets in the circulation will be determined by [CONTACT_681262] r etroviral vector engineered T-
cell. Note:  Samples will be batched and assayed at the conclusion of the study. 
• Patients will be co -enrolled on protocol 09-C-0161 and will adhere to the follow-up 
schedule described in that protocol. Patients’  blood samples will be obtained and undergo 
analysis for detection of RCR by [CONTACT_330421] [ADDRESS_922435] by [CONTACT_681263]. The results of these tests are maintained by [CONTACT_681264] -SB research team.  
5.9 S
AMPLE STORAGE , TRACKING AND DISPOSITION  FOR SURGERY BRANCH CELL 
PRODUCTION FACILITY  
Blood and tissue collected during the course of this study will follow the Cell Tracking and Labeling System established by [CONTACT_144512] -CPF. The Cell Tracking and Labeling System is designed 
to unambiguously ensure that patient/data verification is consistent. The patients ’ cell samples 
(blood or tissue) are tracked by [CONTACT_195150] a unique patient identifier and date of specimen collection. Cryopreserved blood and tissue samples also bear the date the sample was frozen.  All cryopr eserved samples are tracked for freezer location and 
storage criteria.  All samples are stored in monitored freezers/refrigerators in 3NW NCI -SB 
laboratories at specified temperatures with alarm systems in place.  Serum samples will be sent to 
the Blood Proc essing Core  (BPC ) for storage.  Samples will be barcoded and stored on site or 
offsite at NCI Frederick Central Repository Services in  Frederick, MD.  All samples collected 
(blood or tissue) are entered into a central computer database with identification and storage location, and this database is backed up every night. 
If, at any time, a patient withdraws from the study and does not wish for their existing samples to 
be utilized, the individual must provide a written request. Following receipt of this request, the samples will be destroyed and reported as such to the IRB. Any samples lost (in transit or by a researcher) or destroyed due to unknown sample integrity (i.e. broken freezer allows for extensive sample thawing, etc.) will be reported as such to the IRB.  
Blood and tissue collected during the course of this study will be stored, tracked, and disposed of as specified in protocol 03-C-0277.

 35 5.10 SAMPLE STORAGE , TRACKING AND DISPOSITION FOR  FIGG  LAB 
5.10.1 Sample Data Collection  
All samples sent to the BPC will be ba rcoded, with data entered and stored in the LABrador (aka 
LabSamples) utilized by [CONTACT_74908], and data will be updated to the NCI -SB central computer 
database weekly. This is a secure program, with access to LABrador limited to defined Figg Lab 
personnel, who are issued individual user accounts. Installation of LABrador is limited to 
computers specified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Figg. These computers all have a password-restricted login screen. All Figg Lab personnel with access to patient information annually complete the NIH online 
Protection of Human Subjects course.  
LABrador creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, which cannot be traced 
back to patients without LABrador access. The data recorded for each sample includes the patient ID, name, trial name/p rotocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, dose, material type, 
as well as box and freezer location. Patient demographics associated with the clinical center patient number are provided in the system. For each sample, there are notes associated with the processing method (delay in sample processing, storage conditions on the ward, etc.). 
5.10.2 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Barcoded samples are stored in barcoded boxes in a locked freezer at either -20 or -80°C 
according to stability requirements.  These freezers are located onsite in the BPC and offsite at 
NCI Frederick Central Repository Services in Frederick, MD. Visitors to the laboratory are 
required to be accompanied by [CONTACT_79922].  
Access to stored clinical samples is restricted. Sample s will be stored until requested by a 
researcher named on the protocol. All requests are monitored and tracked in LABrador. All 
researchers are required to sign a form stating that the samples are only to be used for research purposes associated with this trial (as per the IRB -approved protocol) and that any unused 
samples must be returned to the BPC. It is the responsibility of the NCI Principal Investigator (PI) to ensure that the samples requested are being used in a manner consistent with IRB approval. 
Following completion of this study, samples will remain in storage as detailed above. Access to 
these samples will only be granted following IRB approval of an additional protocol, granting the rights to use the material.  
If, at any time, a patient withdr aws from the study and does not wish for their existing samples to 
be utilized, the individual must provide a written request. Following receipt of this request, the 
samples will be destroyed and reported as such to the IRB. Any samples lost (in transit or by a researcher) or destroyed due to unknown sample integrity (i.e. broken freezer allows for extensive sample thawing, etc.) will be reported as such to the IRB. 
Sample barcodes are linked to patient demographics and limited clinical information. This 
information will only be provided to investigators listed on this protocol, via registered use of the 
LABrador. It is critical that the sample remains linked to patient information such as race, age, dates of diagnosis and death, and histological information about the tumor, in order to correlate genotype with these variables.

electronic system  (C3D) and ensuring data accuracy, consistency and timeliness. The PI , 
associate investigators  (AI), research nurses , and/or a contracted data manager will assist with 
the data management efforts.  All data obtained during the conduct of the protocol will be kept in 
secure network dri ves or in approved alternative sites that comply with NIH security standards. 
Primary and final analyzed data will have identifiers so that research data can be attributed to an individual human subject participant. Data will be entered into the NCI CCR C3D database.   
All adverse events ( AEs), including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory 
evaluations, regardless of severity, will be followed until return to baseline or stabilization of event.  Patients will be followed for AEs  until their first follow -up evaluation  (6 weeks (± 2 
weeks) following administration of the cell product) or until off-study, whichever comes first. 
An abnormal laboratory value will be recorded in the database as an AE  only if the laboratory 
abnormality is characteri zed by [CONTACT_39132]: 
• Results in discontinuation from the study 
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention  
• Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Is judged by [CONTACT_52374] 
• If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will 
provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s 
outcome. 
All AEs must be recorded on the AE case report form unless otherwise noted below in Section 6.1.1. 
End of study procedures: Data will be stored according to HHS and  FDA regulations , and NIH 
Intramural Records Retention Schedule as applicable.  Loss or destruction of data: Should we become aware that a major breach in our plan to protect 
subject confidentiality and trial data has occurred, the IRB will be notified.  6.1.1 Exclusions to Routine Adverse Event Reporting 
Patients will be receiving multiple agents , which include commercially available agents 
(fludarabine , cyclophosphamide, aldesleukin, and supportive medications) in combination with 
the investigational agents ; therefore, grade [ADDRESS_922437] will not be

ATA SHARING PLAN 
6.2.1 Human Data Sharing Plan 
De-identified h uman data generated for use in future and ongoing research will be shared 
through a NIH-funded or approved repository (ClinicalTrials.gov) and BTRIS. At the completion 
Abbreviated Title:  Anti- NY-ESO-1 mTCR PBL  
Version Date: August 6, 2018  
 37 data analysis, data will be submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov either before publication or  at the time 
of publication or shortly thereafter. Data may also be used to support long- term research efforts 
within the NCI -SB, and de -identified data may also be shared with collaborators as specified in 
protocol 03-C-0277. 
6.2.2 Genomic Data Sharing Plan  
The NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy does not apply to this study. 
6.3 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re-evaluated for response at 6 and 12 weeks (± 
2 weeks), then every 3 months (± 1 month) x3, then every 6 months (± 1 month) x [ADDRESS_922438] 4 weeks ( but not less than 4 weeks ) 
following initial documentation of objective respons e. 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_681265] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.0).  
6.3.1 Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity: All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first 
treatment with cyclophosphamide. 
Evaluable for objective response : Only those patients who have measurable disease present at 
baseline, have received at least one course of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated 
will be considered evaluable for response. These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below. (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease 
progression prior to the end of course 1 will also b e considered evaluable.)  
Evaluable non-t arget disease response: Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are 
evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one course of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -target 
disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression 
of the lesions. 
6.3.2 Disease Parameters  
Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can  be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as: 
• By [CONTACT_13190] x -ray: ≥ 20 mm  
• By [CONTACT_3610]:  
o Scan slice thickness 5 mm or under: ≥ 10 mm  
o Scan slice thickness > 5 mm: double the slice thickness  
• With calipers on clinical exa m: ≥ [ADDRESS_922439] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be >[ADDRESS_922440] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
Abbreviated Title:  Anti- NY-ESO-1 mTCR PBL  
Version Date: August 6, 2018  
 38 recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will 
be measured and followed. 
Non-measurable disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm  or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal mass es 
(not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non- measurable.  
Target lesions : All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected based on  their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated m easurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the 
sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non-target lesions : All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up. 
6.3.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks befor e the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_681266](s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
Clinical lesions : Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diame ter as assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_922441] slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
MRI is also acceptable in certain situat ions (e.g. for body scans). Ideally, the same type of 
scanner should be used, and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.

Version Date: August 6, 2018  
 39 FDG -PET: While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions based on  FDG- PET 
imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion. 
• No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up: If the positive FDG- PET 
at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If the 
positive FDG- PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow- up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly pr ogression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -
PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre- existing site of 
disease on CT that is not progressing based on the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
• FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in 
cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in 
the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623]- specific medical literature for the indication.  
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sens itivity.  
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
6.3.4 Response Criteria  
 Evaluation of T arget Lesions 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 10 lesions representative of all involved organs 
should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions 
should be selected based on  their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for 
accurate repetitive measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD  will be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor 
response of the measurable dimension of the disease.
  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions . 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longe st diameter (LD) of target 
lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.  
Progression (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference 
the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD.  
Abbreviated Title:  Anti- NY-ESO-1 mTCR PBL  
Version Date: August 6, 2018  
 40 
 Evaluation of Non-T arget Lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non- target lesions and should also 
be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required, and these lesions should be followed as 
“present” or “absent.”  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  
Non-Complete Response: Persistence of one or more non- target lesions . 
Progression (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions. Unequivocal progression of existing 
non-target lesions .  
 Evaluation of B est O verall Response 
The best overall  response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient ’s best response assignmen t will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria. 
Target Lesions  Non-Target Lesions  New Lesions  Overall Response 
CR CR No CR 
CR Non-CR/Non -PD No PR 
PR Non-PD No PR 
SD Non-PD No SD 
PD Any Yes or No  PD 
Any PD Yes or No  PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
 Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response 
Confirmation: To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_74909] [ADDRESS_922442] once after study entry at a minimum interval of 6 -8 weeks. 
Duration of Overall Response : The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement cr iteria are met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The du ration of overall 
complete response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of Stable Disease : Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.

 Central Radiology Review  
We will centrally (NCI) review all MRI scans that have been designated as a partial or complete 
response. [CONTACT_681274] of NIH Neuro- Radiology or his designee will assist in the review of 
all MRI scans.  
 Neurological Exam ination  
Since it is not used for determining response, an objective assessment of the neurological exam will not be required data. Nevertheless, the neurological exam could be useful as a corollary pi[INVESTIGATOR_681233]. Thus, we will request (but not require) that the following information will be recorded at each follow-up visit: 
• Normal versus abnormal neurologic exam  
• Status of neurologic exam compared to last exam : 
o Definitely better  
o Possibly better 
o Stable  
o Possibly worse

example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.  
7.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the pur poses of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.

An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in 
the Investigator ’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; 
or, if an Investigator ’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. “Unexpected” also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in 
the Investigator ’s Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
7.1.4 Serious 
An U nanticipated Problem or Protocol Deviation is serious if it meets the definition of a Serious 
Adverse Event or if it compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others.  7.1.5 Serious Adverse Event  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_233003]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

1.  Is unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to:  
a. the research risks that are described in the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents, and 
b. the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND 
2. Is related or possibly related to participation in the research; AND  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm  (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
7.2 IRB  AND CLINICAL DIRECTOR (CD)  REPORTING  
7.2.1 IRB and NCI CD Expedited Reporting of Unanticipated Problems and Deaths 
The Protocol PI [INVESTIGATOR_681234] : 
• All deaths, except deaths due to progressive disease  
• All protocol deviations  
• All unanticipated problems 
• All non- compliance  
Reports must be received within 7 days of PI [INVESTIGATOR_10039].  
7.2.2 IRB Requirements for PI [INVESTIGATOR_681235]:  
1. A summary of all protocol deviations in a tabular format to include the date the deviation occurred, a brief description of the deviation and any corrective action. 
2. A summary of any instances of non -compliance.

research  
• All Grade 5 events regardless of attribution  
• All serious events regardless of attribution.  
Note : Grade 1 events are not required to be reported.  
7.2.3 IRB Reporting of IND Safety Reports 
Only IND Safety Reports that meet the def inition of an unanticipated probl em will need to be 
reported to the IRB.  
Abbreviated Title:  Anti- NY-ESO-1 mTCR PBL

Non-UP Adverse Events 
Patients may receive p rophylaxis for pneumocystis, HSV, and VZV for at least  [ADDRESS_922447]-
chemotherapy  (see Section 4.1.2). The investigators are requesting a waiver from IRB reporting 
for a missed prophylactic dose. A missed prophylactic dose will not be considered a protocol deviation, and thus a deviation wil l not be reported to the IRB, if the patient is compliant with 
taking at least 75 percent of their required dose.  
If the rate of these events exceeds the rate anticipated  in the protocol (i.e., the patient takes less 
than 75 percent of their required dose), the events will be classified and reported as though they 
are unanticipated problems. 
7.[ADDRESS_922448] receives the investigational agent/intervention to the time of the first 
follow-up evaluation (6 weeks (± 2 weeks) following the administration of the cell product), the investigator must immediately report to the sponsor, using the mandatory MedWatch Form FDA  
3500A or equivalent, any serious adverse event, whether or not considered drug- related, 
including those listed in the protocol or Investigator ’s Brochure and must include an assessment 
of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event . For serious adverse 
events that occur after the first follow -up evaluation, only those events that have an attribution of 
at least possibly related to the agent/intervention will be reported.  
Required timing for reporting per the above guidelines: 
• Death (except death due to progressive disease) must be reported via email within [ADDRESS_922449] be submitted within one business day. 
• Other serious adverse events as well as deaths due to progressive disease must be 
reported within one business day. 
Events will be submitted to the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) at: [EMAIL_13018].g ov 
and to the CCR PI [INVESTIGATOR_32528]. 
7.3.1 Waiver of Expedited Reporting to CCR 
The investigators are requesting a waiver from reporting specific events in an expedited manner 
to the CCR.  Patients will be receiving commercially available agents, such as f ludarabine, 
cyclophosphamide, and aldesleukin. The majority of toxicities observed on NCI -SB adoptive c ell 
therapy (ACT) protocols are expected toxicities of the non- myeloablative , lymphodepleting 
preparative regimen or IL -2 and occur in approximately 95% of the patients enrolled, therefore, 
we are requesting a waiver from reporting the following events in an expedited manner to the CCR:  
• Grade 3 or greater myelosuppression, defined as lymphopenia, neutropenia, decreased hemoglobin, and thrombocytopenia. 
• Grade 3 or greater nausea, vomiting, mucositis - oral, anorexia, diarrhea, fever, chills, 
fatigue, and rash maculo -papular. 
• Grade 3 hypoxia, dyspnea, hematuria, hypotension, sinus tachycardia, urine output 
decreased, confusion, infections, and febrile neutropenia.

Version Date: August 6, [ADDRESS_922450], every 6 months. The report shall include the number of patients treated in the 
timeframe, the number of events per AE term per grade which occurred in the 6 -month 
timeframe and in total since the start of the study, attribution, and type/category of serious.  
Reports will be submitted to the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) at: [EMAIL_1231]  
7.3.[ADDRESS_922451] four months following treatment, 
the study treatment should be discontinued immediately and the pregnancy should be reported to the Sponsor. The potential risk of exposure of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agents (s) should be documented in box B5 of the MedW atch form “Describe 
Event or Problem”.  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an SAE. However, as patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the fetus to agents which may be teratogenic, the CCR is requesting that pregnancy should be reported in an expedited manner as g rade 3 “Pregnancy, puerperium 
and perinatal conditions - Other (pregnancy)” under the “ Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions ” SOC.  
Congenital abnormalities or birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented. 
If any pregnancy occurs during the course of the study, then the investigator should inform the 
Sponsor within one day, i.e., immediately, but no later than [ADDRESS_922452] dose of aldesleukin. 
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until [ADDRESS_922453] dose should, if possible, be followed up and documented.

ATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
7.5.1 Principal Investigator/Research Team  
The clinical research team will meet on a regular basis when patients are being actively treated on the trial to discuss each patient. Decisions about enrollment will be made based on the toxicity data from prior patients.  
All data will be collected in a timely manner and reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_83852]. Ad verse events will 
be reported as required above. Any safety concerns, new information that might affect either the 
ethical and or scientific conduct of the trial, or protocol deviations will be reported to the IRB using iRIS. 
The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_681236]. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_681237].  7.5.2 Sponsor Monitoring Plan 
As a sponsor for clinical trials, FDA regulations require the CCR to maintain a monitoring 
program. The CCR’s program allows for confirmation of: study data, specifically data that could affect the interpretation of primary study endpoints; adherence to the protocol, regulations, and SOPs; and human subject’s protection. This is done through independent verification of study data with source documentation focusing on: 
• Informed consent process 
• Eligibility confirmation  
• Drug administration and accountability 
• Adverse events monitoring 
• Response assessment  
The monitoring program also extends to multi- site research when the CCR is the coordinating 
center.  
This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_62561] a  CCR contractor. Monitors are qualified 
by [CONTACT_12293]. Personnel monitoring this study will not be affiliated in any way with the trial conduct.  
7.5.3 Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC)  
This protocol will requi re oversight from the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC).  Initial 
review will occur as soon as possible after the annual IRB continuing review date.  Subsequently, 
each protocol will be reviewed as close to annually as the quarterly meeting schedule permits or 
more frequently as may be required by [CONTACT_4484].  For initial and subsequent reviews, protocols 
will not be reviewed if there is no accrual within the review period. Written outcome letters will be generated in response to the monitoring activities and submitted to the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_681238], CCR, NCI.

can experience a clinical response (PR + CR) to therapy.   
The study will be conducted using a phase II optimal design(19). The  objective will be to 
determine if the combination of high-dose aldesleukin, lymphodepleting chemotherapy, and anti-ESO TCR -gene engineered lymphocytes is able to be associated with a clinical response rate that 
can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of a modest 20% PR + CR rate (p1=0.20).

Under the null hypothesis (5% response rate), the probability of early termination is 72%.

responses seen at day 28 and maintained at 4 months will be considered a positive response for

Subjects from both genders and all racial/ethnic groups are eligible for this study if they meet the eligibility criteria.  To date, there is no information that suggests that differences in drug 
metabolism or disease response would be expected in one group compared to another. Efforts will be made to extend accrual to a representative population, but in this preliminary study, a balance must be struck between patient safety considerations and limitations on the number of individuals exposed to potentially toxic and/or ineffective treatments  on the one hand and the 
need to explore gender and ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other hand. If differences in

follow- up study may be written to in vestigate those differences more fully.  
10.2  PARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN  
The use of the non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen in this protocol is a major procedure which entails serious discomforts and hazards for the patient, such that fatal complications are possible. It is therefore only appropriate to carry out this experimental 
procedure in the context of life threatening metastatic cancer.  Since the efficacy of this 
experimental procedure is unknown, it does not seem reasonable to expose children under the age of 15 to this risk without further evidence of benefit. We will only treat adolescents who are of adult stature (must be ≥ 50 kg) and thus can safely receive the protocol treatment regimen; we 
do not anticipate the need for consultation with the pediatric oncology service although this will always remain an option. 
Should results of this study indicate efficacy in treating metastatic cancer, which is not 
responsive to other standard forms of therapy, future research can be conducted in the younger pediatric population to evaluate potential benefit in that patient population. 
10.[ADDRESS_922459] benefi t from 
research participation (S ection 10.5), all subjects ≥ age 18 will be offered the opportunity to fill 
in their wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH Advance Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form so that another 
person can make decisions about their medical care in the event that they become incapacitated or cognitively impaired during the course of the study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_681239] N IH Ability 
to Consent Assessment Team (ACAT) for evaluation  as needed for the following: an 
independent assessment of whether an individual has the capacity to provide consent; assistance in identifying and assessing an appropriate surrogate when indicated; and/or an assessment of the capacity to appoint a surrogate. For those subjects that become incapacitated and do not have a pre-determined substitute decision maker, the procedures described in MAS Policy 87-4 and 
OHSRP  SOP 14E for appointing a surrogate decision maker for adult subjects who are (a) 
decisionally impaired, and (b) who do not have a legal guardian or durable power of attorney, will be followed.  
10.4 
 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
The experimental treatment has a chance to provide clinical benefit though this is unknown. The NCI-SB has extensive experience with ACT following treatment with high -dose aldesleukin, 
however, this experimental treatment is only available at a very few centers throughout the country. Although we have seen responses to this treatment, we do not know if this change in our process will improve patient outcome. The risks associated with ACT are substantial, including a delay in treatment due to the need to harvest and grow the cells; a surgical procedure (possibly major) to obtain tumor for the cell produc t; the possibility that a c ell product cannot be 
generated;  infection and sepsis due to the non- myeloablative , lymphodepleting preparative 
regimen; intubation ; rena l toxicities due to aldesleukin; and death. The risks in this treatment are 
detailed in S ection 11.   
Abbreviated Title:  Anti- NY-ESO-1 mTCR PBL  
Version Date: August 6, 2018  
 50 10.5  RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSIS  
Because all patients in this protocol have metastatic cancer and limited life expectancies , the 
potential benefit is thought to outweigh the potential risks. The risk/benefit analysis for adults 
with the capacity to consent, as well as for adults who may become unable to provide consent, is greater than minimal risk but presenting the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects based on the risks and potential benefits described in Section 10.4. The risk/benefit analysis for pediatric patients falls under Category 2, [ADDRESS_922460] benefit to the individual child subjects involved in the research. 
10.6 
 CONSENT PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION  
Patients are initially consented on protocols 99-C-0128 and 03-C-0277. If the patient has a tumor 
that is found to be NY- ESO -1 positive by [CONTACT_9064], and if the lymphocytes can be 
generated for infusion and the patient meets the thorough screening for eligibility, the patient  and 
their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) if applicable , with family members or friends at the request of 
the patient, will be presented with a detailed  description of the protocol treatment. The specific 
requirements, objectives, and potential advantages and disadvantages will be presented. If the 
patient is under 18 years of age, the consent process includes both the patient and the parent(s)/ guardian(s ), and a signed informed consent document will be obtained prior to entry 
onto the study. The informed consent document is given to the patient, and the parent (s)/guardian(s)  if applicable, who is requested to review it and to ask questions prior to 
agreeing to participate in receiving treatment on this protocol. The patient is reassured that 
participation on trial is entirely voluntary and that he/she can withdraw or decide against treatment at any time without adverse consequences. The PI , AI, or clinical fellow is responsible 
for completing the consent process and a copy of the consent is offered to the patient, and the parent(s)/guardian(s), if applicable. 
The investigators are requesting a waiver from the IRB to allow only one parent to sign the 
informed consent to enter a child on the protocol. Because many pa tients must travel to the NIH 
from long distances at substantial expense, requiring both parents to be present for the consent process could be a financial hardship for many families. When guardianship status of the child is uncertain, documentation of custody status must be obtained. In situations where there is joint 
custody of a child, both parents must sign consent. If only one parent can be present at NIH, the other parent’s consent can be obtained by [CONTACT_681268] 10.6.2. 
Where deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_83953]’s parent(s) or legal guardian (s), the 
child will also be included in all discussions about the tr ial and age -appropriate language will be 
used to describe the procedures and tests involved in this study, along with the risks, discomforts 
and benefits of participation. The parent(s)/guardian(s) will sign and date the informed consent to provide permission for the child to take part in the study. Written assent will be obtained from children as the study holds out the prospect of direct benefit that is important to the health and well-being of the child and is available only in the context of the research. Written assent will be 
obtained as appropriate for children ages 15-17, and the parent (s)/guardian (s) will sign  on the 
designated line on the informed consent attesting to the fact that the child has given assent. The consent/assent process will be documented in the child’s medical record, including the assessment of the child’s ability to provide written assent, as a pplicable.  All children will be

wish to continue on the trial and informed consent will be obtained from them at that time.  
10.6.[ADDRESS_922462] reaches age 18, continued participation (including ongoing interactions 
with the subject or continued analysis of identifiable data) will require consenting of the now adult with the standard protocol consent document to ensure legally effective informed consent has been obtained. We request waiver of informed consent for those individuals who become lost to follow-up during their participation in the research study. 
Requirements for Waiver of Consent consistent with 45 CFR 46.116 (d): 
1. The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects. 
a. Analysis of samples and data from this study involves no additional risks to subjects. 
2. The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects.  
a. Retention of these samples or data does not affect the welfare of subjects.  
3. The research could not practicably be carried out without t he waiver or alteration.  
a. Considering the length of time between the minor’s last contact [CONTACT_83954], it will likely be very difficult to locate them again. A significant reduction in the number of samples analyzed is l ikely to impact the quality 
of the research.  
4. Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information 
after participation.  
a. We request a waiver of consent for those subjects who have been lost to follow-up or 
who have been taken off -study before reaching the age of majority.  
10.6.2 Telephone Consent 
In situations where the second parent is unable to be physically present to give consent, the 
informed consent document will be sent to that parent or legally authorized representative. An explanation of the study will be provided over the telephone after the second parent or legally authorized representative has had the opportunity to read the consent form. The second parent or legally authorized representative will sign and date the in formed consent. A witness to the 
second parent or legally authorized representative’s signature [CONTACT_131838]. 
The original informed consent document will be sent back to the consenting investigator who 
will sign and date the consent form with the date the consent was obtained via telephone.  
A fully executed copy will be returned via mail for the subject’s records.  
The informed consent process will be documented on a progress note by [CONTACT_330429] a copy of the informed consent document and note will be kept in the subject’s research record.

We request prospective IRB approval of the use of the short form process for non- English 
speaking subjects and will notify the IRB at the time of continuing review of the frequency of the 
use of the Short Form. 
11 PHARMACEUTICAL INFOR MATION   
Cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and aldesleukin, the commercial drugs used in this study, will 
not alter labeling of the FDA -approved drugs. The investigation is not intended to support a new 
indication for use or any other significant changes to labeling or advertising in cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, or aldesleukin. The investigation does not involve a route of administration or dosage level in use in a patient population or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the acceptabi lity of the risks) associated with the use of the drug 
products. 
11.1 I
NVESTIGATIONAL REGIMEN  
11.1.1 Anti-ESO TCR Transduced PBL 
The procedure for expanding the human PBL and the CoA are similar to those approved by [CONTACT_5212], and used at the NCI in ongoing protocols evaluating cell therapy in the NCI -SB. The CoA is included in Appendix E. The PBL will be transduced with retroviral 
supernatant containing the α -chain and β -chain genes of the anti- ESO mTCR.  
 Retroviral Vector Containing the anti- ESO TCR Gene  
The retroviral vector supernatant (PG13- ESO -157m TCR (C1) encoding a T- cell receptor 
directed against NY -ESO -1, was prepared and preserved following cGMP conditions in the 
Indiana University Vector Production Facility (IUVPF). Transgenic mice expressing full- length 
human HLA-A*0201 gene were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and immunized with human NY- ESO -1 peptide (SLLMWI TQC).  Murine T- cells reactive to this 
peptide were used as a source to isolate the TCR alpha and beta chain genes (TCR alpha chain TRAV6D and beta chain TRBV26). Based on the DNA sequence of the TCR alpha and beta 
chains, a DNA sequence was chemically synt hesized to link the beta and alpha TCR genes using 
a peptide linker. This synthetic DNA was then inserted into the gamma -retroviral vector MSGV1 
to produce the murine anti- NY-ESO -1 TCR vector, (MSGV1 ESO-157 muTCR B2aA). Plasmid 
DNA for this vector was used to make the PG13 virus producer cell clone. The alpha and beta chains are linked by a T2A peptide.  
Abbreviated Title:  Anti- NY-ESO-1 mTCR PBL  
Version Date: August 6, 2018  
 53 The physical titer will be determined by [CONTACT_681269]. 
TCR expression on the cell surface will be measured usin g FACS following staining with an 
anti-mouse constant region antibody. The titer will be measured as transducing units per 
milliliter.  Portions of the supernatant will be stored at  -80°C at NCI -SB, as well as at Fisher 
Bioservices  in Rockville, MD. This storage facility is equipped with around-the- clock 
temperature monitoring. Upon request, supernatant will be delivered on dry ice to be used in ex vivo transduction of patient PBL. There will be no re-use of the same unit of supernatant for 
different patients. Retroviral titer has been shown to be stable after immediate thawing and immediate administration (coating the tissue culture wells previously coated with Retronectin). Handling of the vector should follow the guidelines of Biosafety Level- 2 (BSL -2). The specific 
guidelines for Biosafety Level -2 (BSL -2) can be viewed at  http://bmbl.od.nih.gov/sect3bsl2.htm. 
Note:  Penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamycin will not be used in the manufacture of products 
for patients with documented allergies to these  drugs.  
11.1.2  Interleukin-2 (Aldesleukin, Proleukin, Recombinant Human Interleukin 2) 
How Supplied: Interleukin-2 (aldesleukin) will be provided by [CONTACT_74914].   
Formulation/Reconstitution : Aldesleukin, NSC #373364, is provided as single- use vials 
containing 22 million IU ( −1.3 mg) IL- 2 as a sterile, white to off -white  lyophilized cake plus 50 
mg mannitol and 0.18 mg sodium dodecyl sulfate, buffered with approximately 0.17 mg monobasic and 0.89 mg dibasic sodium phosphate to a pH of 7.5 (range 7.2 to 7.8). The vial is reconstituted with 1.2 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, and the resultant concentration is 18 million IU/m L or 1.1 mg/mL. Diluent should be directed against the side of the vial to avoid 
excess  foaming. Swirl contents gently until completely dissolved.  Do not shake. Since vials 
contain no preservative, reconstituted solution should be used with 24 hours. 
Storage : Intact vials are stored in the refrigerator (2 -8°C) protected from light. Each vial  bears an 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_320].  
Dilution/Stability : Reconstituted aldesleukin should be further diluted with 50 mL of 5% Human 
Serum Albumin (HSA). The HSA should be added to the diluent prior to the addition of RIL-2. Dilutions of the reconstituted solution over a 1000-fold range (i.e., 1 mg/mL to 1 mcg/mL) are acceptable in either glass bottles or polyvinyl chloride bags. Aldesleukin is chemically stable for 48 hours at refrigerated and room temperatures, 2-30°C.  
Administration : The dosage will be calculated based on total body weight. The final dilution of 
aldesleukin will be infused over 15 minutes. Aldesleukin will be administered as an inpatient.   
Toxicities: Expected toxicities of aldesleukin are listed in the product label and in Appendix B  
and Appendix C . Grade 3 toxicities common to aldesleukin include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, 
hypotension, skin changes, anorexia, mucositis, dysphagia, or constitutional symptoms and laboratory changes as detailed in  Appendix B . Additional grade 3 and 4 toxicities seen with 
aldesleukin are detailed in  Appendix C .  
11.1.3  Fludarabine 
(Please refer to the FDA -approved package insert for complete product information)  
Abbreviated Title:  Anti- NY-ESO-1 mTCR PBL  
Version Date: August 6, 2018  
 54 Description: Fludarabine phosphate is a synthetic purine nucleoside that differs from physiologic 
nucleosides in that the sugar moiety is arabinose instead of ribose or deoxyribose. Fludarabine is 
a purine antagonist antimetabolite.  
How Supplied: It will be purchased by [CONTACT_74915]. Fludarabine is supplied in a 50 mg vial as a fludarabine phosphate powder in the form of a white, lyophilized solid cake.  
Stability : Following reconstitution with 2 mL of sterile water for injection to a concentration of 
25 mg/mL, the solution has a pH of 7.7. The fludarabine powder is stable for at least 18 months at 2-8°C; when reconstituted, fludarabine is stable for at least 16 days at room temperature. 
Because no preservative is present,  reconstituted fludarabine will typi[INVESTIGATOR_330394] 8 hours. Specialized references should be consulted for specific compatibility information. Fludarabine is dephosphorylated in serum, transported intracellularly and converted to the nucleotide fludarabine triphosphate; this 2- fluoro -ara-ATP molecule is thought to be 
required for the drug’s cytotoxic effects. Fludarabine inhibits DNA polymerase, ribnucleotide reductase, DNA primase, and may interfere with chain elongation, and RNA and protein synthesis. 
Storage : Intact vials should be stored refrigerated (2-8°C). 
Administration : Fludarabine is administered as an IV infusion in 100 mL 0.9% sodium chloride, 
USP over 15-30 minutes. The doses will be based on body surface area (BSA). If patient is obese 
(BMI > 35), drug dosage will be calculated using practical weight as described in  Appendix A .  
Toxicities : At doses of 25 mg/m2/day for [ADDRESS_922463] is myelosuppression; 
however, thrombocytopenia is responsible for most cases of severe and life-t hreatening 
hematologic toxicity.  Serious opportunistic infections have occurred in CLL patients treated with 
fludarabine. Hemolytic anemia has been reported after one or more courses of fludarabine with 
or without a prior history of a positive Coomb’s test; fatal hemolytic anemia has been reported. In addition, bone marrow fibrosis has been observed after fludarabine therapy. Other common adverse effects include malaise, fever, chills, fatigue, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and weakness.  Irreversible and potentially fatal central nervous system toxicity in the form of 
progressive encephalopathy, blindness, and coma is only rarely obser ved at the currently 
administered doses of fludarabine. More common neurologic side effects at the current doses of fludarabine include weakness, pain, malaise, fatigue, paresthesia, visual or hearing disturbances, and sleep disorders. Adverse respi[INVESTIGATOR_83864], dyspnea, allergic 
or idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis.  Tumor lysis syndrome has been rarely observed in 
fludarabine treatment of CLL.  Treatment on previous ACT  protocols in the NCI -SB have caused 
persistently low (b elow 200) CD4 counts, and one patient developed polyneuropathy manifested 
by [CONTACT_74916], and motor and sensory defects. 
11.1.4  Cyclophosphamide 
(Please r efer to the FDA -approved package insert for complete product information) 
Description : Cyclophosphamide is a nitrogen mustard- derivative alkylating agent.  Following 
conversion to active metabolites in the liver, cyclophosphamide functions as an alkyating agent; the drug also possesses potent immunosuppressive activity. The serum half -life after IV 
administr ation ranges from 3-12 hours; the drug and/or its metabolites can be detected in the 
serum for up to 72 hours after administration.  
Abbreviated Title:  Anti- NY-ESO-1 mTCR PBL  
Version Date: August 6, 2018  
 55 How Supplied: Cyclophosphamide will be obtained from commercially available sources by [CONTACT_330433].   
Stability : Following reconstitution as directed with sterile water for injection, cyclophosphamide 
is stable for 24 hours at room temperature or 6 days when kept at 2-8°C.  
Administration : It will be diluted in 250 mL D5W and infused over one hour. The dose will be 
based on the patient’s body weight. If patient is obese (BMI > 35) , drug dosage will be 
calculated using practical weight as described in  Appendix A . 
Toxicities : Hematologic toxicity occurring with cyclophosphamide usually includes leukopenia 
and thrombocytopenia. Anorexia, nausea and vomiting, rash and alopecia occur, especially after 
high-dose cyclophosphamide; diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, infertility, and mucosal and oral 
ulceration have been reported.  Sterile hemorrhagic cystitis occurs in about 20% of patients; 
severity can range from microscopic hematuria to extensive cystitis with  bladder fibrosis. 
Although the incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis associated with cyclophosphamide appears to be lower than that associated with ifosfamide, mesna (sodium 2- mercaptoethanesulfonate) has been 
used prophylactically as a uroprotective agent in patients receiving cyclophosphamide. 
Prophylactic mesna is not effective in preventing hemorrhagic cystitis in all patients.  Patients 
who receive high-dose cyclophosphamide may develop interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, which can 
be fatal.  Hyperuricemia due to rapid cellular destruction may occur, particularly in patients with 
hematologic malignancy.  Hyperuricemia may be minimized by [CONTACT_74918], 
alkalinization of the urine, and/or administration of allopurinol. If allopurinol is administered, patient s should be watched closely for cyclophosphamide toxicity (due to allopurinol induction 
of hepatic microsomal enzymes).  At high doses, cyclophosphamide can result in a syndrome of 
inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion; hyponatremia with progressive weight gain without edema occurs.  At high doses, cyclophosphamide can result in cardiotoxicity. Deaths have 
occurred from diffuse hemorrhagic myocardial necrosis and from a syndrome of acute myopericarditis; in such cases, congestive heart failure may occu r within a few days of the first 
dose. Other consequences of cyclophosphamide cardiotoxicity include arrhythmias, potentially irreversible cardiomyopathy, and pericarditis. Other reported adverse effects of cyclophosphamide include headache, dizziness, and myxedema; faintness, facial flushing, and diaphoresis have occurred following IV administration. Mesna (sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulphonate; given by [CONTACT_51215]) is a synthetic sulfhydryl compound that can chemically interact with urotoxic metabolites of cyclophosphamide (acrolein and 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide) to decrease the incidence and severity of hemorrhagic cystitis.  
11.2 SUPPORT MEDICATIONS  
11.2.1  Mesna  (Sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate, Mesnum, Mesnex, NSC-113891)

Filgrastim will be obtained commercially by [CONTACT_74920] 300 µ g/mL and 480 µg/1.[ADDRESS_922464] 10 months when refrigerated.  The appropriate dose is drawn up into a 
syringe.  
Filgrastim will be given as a daily subcutaneous injection. The side effects of f ilgrastim are skin 
rash, myalgia and bone pain, an increase of preexisting inflammatory conditions, enlarged spleen with occasional associated low platelet counts, alopecia (with prolonged use) elevated blood chemistry levels.  
11.2.3  Trimethoprim and Sulfamethoxazole Double Strength (TMP/SMX DS) 
TMP/SMX DS  will be obtained by [CONTACT_74922].  It will be used for the prevention of PCP pneumonia. The oral dose is 1 tablet PO daily 
three times a week (MUST be on non -consecutive days) beginning Day [ADDRESS_922465] 6 months and until the CD4 count is > 200 on two  consecutive lab studies. Like other sulfa drugs, TMP/SMX DS can cause allergies, fever,  
photosensitivity, nausea, and vomiting. Allergies typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y develop as a widespread itchy red 
rash with fever 8-[ADDRESS_922466] dose. Neutropenia, a reduction in the number of neutrophils, can also occur.  
Dapsone (in G6PD sufficient patient), atovaquone, or pentamidine will may be substitute d for 
TMP/SMX -DS in patients with sulfa allergies.  
 Dapsone 
Dapsone will be obtained by [CONTACT_74922]. It will be used for the prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia. The dose is 100 mg by [CONTACT_34048], startin g on Day 0 (± 7 days) and continuing at least 6 months and until the CD4+ 
count is > 200 on two consecutive lab studies. It is supplied as 25 mg and 100 mg tablets. Dapsone contains a sulfa group, although the cross reactivity in patients with sulfa allergies is quite low. Dapsone may be considered in patients with mild to moderate sulfa allergies. Dapsone should be avoided in patients with severe (i.e., a history of anaphylaxis or other equally serious reaction) reactions to sulfa drugs. Additionally, dapsone has been reported to cause hemolytic anemia is patients with G6PD deficiency. It is rec ommended that patients be tested for G6PD 
deficiency prior to the initiation of dapsone therapy. Dapsone is generally well tolerated, but may cause a number of  hematologic adverse reactions, including increased reticulocyte counts, 
hemolysis, decreased hemoglobin, methemoglobinemia, agranulocytosis, anemia, and leukopenia. Other rare but serious adverse reactions include bullous exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], pancreatitis, interstitial pneumonitis, and 
pulmonary eosinophilia. For more detailed information about adverse reactions, consult the package insert.

 61 13 APPENDICES  
13.1 APPENDIX A: MODIFICATION OF DOSE CALCULATIONS * IN PATIENTS WHOSE BMI  IS 
GREATER THAN 35 
 
Unless otherwise specified in this protocol, actual body weight is used for dose calculations of 
treatment agents.  In patients who are determined to be obese (BMI > 35), the practical weight  
(see 3 below) will be used. 
 
1. BMI Determination: 
 BMI = weight (kg) / [height (m)]2  
 
2. Calculation of ideal body weight: 
Male = 50 kg + 2.3 (number of inches over 60 inches) 
Example:  Ideal body weight of 5’10 ” male  
50 + 2.3 (10) = 73 kg 
 
Female = 45.5 kg + 2.3 (number of inches over 60 inches) 
Example:  Ideal body weight of 5’3 ” female  
45.5 + 2.3 (3) = 57 kg  
3. Calculation of “practical weight”: 
 
Calculate the average of the actual and the ideal body weights.  This is the practical 
weight to be used in calculating the doses of chemotherapy and associated agents 
designated in the protocol. 
 
*Practical weight will NOT be used in the calculation of dose for aldesleukin.

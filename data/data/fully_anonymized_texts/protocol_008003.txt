Version 3.0  (24.Jun.2020) Page 7 of 231.0 Background  and Study Rationale
1.1 Introduction
Cathter ablation of  atrial fibrillation (AF) has become a common ablation procedure performed worldwide. The 
cornerstone of this procedure is pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). PVI can be achieved by [CONTACT_424972], the two 
most common being radiofrequency (RF) and cryoablation.  Energy delivery may extend beyond the atrial 
myocardium and result in damage to adjacent structures, including the esophagus. Atrio-esophageal fistula (AEF) 
is a rare, but a well-recognized complication of percutaneous AF ablation with an estimated incidence of 0.02–
0.11%1. Although the pathophysiology is not entirely understood, it is clear that thermal injury to the esophagus 
during ablation of the posterior left atrial wall plays a crucial role in triggering a cascade of events that eventually 
results in the development of AEF. Common clinical strategies to prevent esophageal injury include delivery of lower 
ablation energy along the posterior left atrium as well as the use of a luminal esophageal temperature (LET) probe 
aimed to alert and guide energy delivery. Nonetheless, esophageal injury is still common, and AEF continues to be 
reported despi[INVESTIGATOR_286532]. 
1.[ADDRESS_1135620] assessed the outcomes of >[ADDRESS_1135621]-time catheter ablation of AF followed by [CONTACT_286543] 4 days of the procedure. They found that 82% of patients 
had EGD without esophageal lesions and no subsequent esophageal events. Of the patients with esophageal 
abnormalities, two-thirds had erythema with no further complications. The 5 documented esophageal perforations 
occurred in patients with esophageal ulceration (ratio of esophageal perforation to ulcer, 1:10)2. Another study 
showed evidence of esophageal thermal injury in 9/20 (45%) on EGD the day after the ablation procedure3. 
1.3 Name  [CONTACT_819738] (EnsoETM) is an FDA approved device.  The EnsoETM is a 
non-sterile multi-lumen silicone tube placed in the esophagus for the purpose of cooling or warming a patient while 
simultaneously allowing gastric decompression and drainage. Modulation and control of the patient’s temperature 
is achieved by [CONTACT_286551] (Blanketrol III, Cincinnati SubZero). Two 
lumens connect to the external heat exchanger, while a third central lumen provides stomach access for connection 
to a fluid collection device with low intermittent suction for gastric decompression. Distilled water circulates within 
the EnsoETM just like a water blanket. The EnsoETM is made of standard medical-grade silicone. The versatile 
device can be placed by [CONTACT_819729] a procedure or operating room, emergency room, or intensive care unit. 
Providers placing devices will be appropriately trained.  The EnsoETM is a single-use, disposable, non-implantable 
device with an intended duration of use of 72 hours or less. For this study, the device will be used during cardiac 
ablation procedures for the intended indication of patient temperature management using approved 
settings/parameters as detailed in the product instructions for use document. 
1.3.1 Nonclinical  Data
While, there is no  published pre-clinical animal data with this device, an in-vivo animal study using a different 
esophageal balloon device has been performed. Using an animal model, Arruda, et al. demonstrated that the use 
of a compliant balloon device that circulates cold fluid between 5-10C can prevent collateral thermal injury to the 
esophagus4 during RF ablation. In this study, the authors demonstrate that they were able to safely perform 
esophageal cooling to prevent esophageal thermal injury without adversely affecting the surrounding structures or 
the biophysical parameters of the radiofrequency ablation lesions4.   In this study, cryoenergy will be used to perform 
PVI.  The EnsoETM device will be used to circulate warm water (42C) in order to try and prevent thermal lesion 
formation within the esophagus.

Version 3.0  (24.Jun.2020) Page 8 of 231.3.2 Clinical  Data to Date
One clinical  observational study has indicated that esophageal cooling can reduce thermal injury during RF AF 
ablation, but this strategy is not routinely used in clinical practice and has not been evaluated for cryoablation PVI. 
Ahmed, et al. reported in an observational study that included 67 patients that the incidence of thermal injury during 
cryoablation for AF is 17%5. Based on these and prior studies, it is our hypothesis that the use of the EnsoETM 
device may reduce the occurrence and/or severity of esophageal thermal injury as it is a compliant balloon 
technology that can reach a warming temperature of 42 C. In addition, it is FDA cleared and has been used safely 
in thousands of patients for temperature control making it the ideal device to use for this study.
2 Study Objectives
The purpose of  the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_819720] (EnsoETM) limits the frequency or severity of thermal injury during cryoballoon ablation of 
atrial fibrillation. 
2.1 Primary  Objectives
1. To  determine the occurrence rate of esophageal thermal injury between groups
2. To  determine the severity and size of esophageal injury between groups
2.2 Secondary  Objectives 
1. Determine  the occurrence and location of any acute PV reconnection between groups
2. Determine  freedom from AF at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months
3 Investigational  Plan 
3.1 General  Design
This is  a small-scale, pi[INVESTIGATOR_819721] (EnsoETM) limits the frequency or severity of thermal injury during catheter ablation of atrial 
fibrillation.  This prospective, randomized study will include 40 patients with symptomatic AF undergoing index PVI 
under general anesthesia at the Northwestern Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion with 20 
patients (Group A) randomized to undergo the ablation procedure with esophageal warming and the other 20 patients 
(Group B) will serve as the control group and will not have the EnsoETM device used. Patients randomized to Group A 
will have the EnsoETM device placed in the electrophysiology laboratory following intubation and prior to the ablation 
procedure. AF ablation will be carried out in a standard fashion.  All patients will undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy 
(EGD) 1-[ADDRESS_1135622]-time AF ablation procedure will be approached by [CONTACT_286547] (co-investigators) or 
a member of the research team prior to the AF ablation procedure.  All potentially eligible patients will first have 
signed an informed consent for the clinical procedure by [CONTACT_128049].  We will follow applicable 
University regulations and Illinois law pertaining to consent process and obtaining signatures. Written informed 
consent for the research study (use of EnsoETM + EGDs) will be obtained the morning of the clinical procedure 
prior to any research procedures taking place.
3.1.[ADDRESS_1135623] signed the research study consent form will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the study 
device (EnsoETM) or to standard of care (standard temperature probe monitoring). Insertion of the study device will 
be in place of the standard temperature probe and will not add any additional time or change the protocol of the

Version 3.0  (24.Jun.2020) Page [ADDRESS_1135624] of care (SOC) arms during the clinical ablation procedure.  
Ablation Procedure (Day 0)
Cryoballoon ablation for PVI under general anesthesia will be performed via the standard technique. For those patients 
randomized to group A, the EnsoETM will be placed immediately following induction of general anesthesia.
Endoscopic Evaluation (Day 1)
All patients will undergo EGD the day after the ablation procedure. These will be performed via a standard technique.  
Studies will be interpreted for research purposes by [CONTACT_819730]’s 
study group. Esophageal injury will be attributed to ablation if located on the anterior wall of the mid-esophagus (20 to 
30 cm from the incisors). EGD findings of thermal injury will be classified into four injury grades: (1) erythema – mild 
injury; (2) superficial ulceration – moderate injury; (3) deep ulceration – significant injury; and (4) fistula/perforation. 
Clinical interpretation of the EGD study will still be performed and reported in Epic by a Northwestern gastroenterologist 
according to standard clinical guidelines.

7.2 Sample  Size and Power Determination
Based on  prior studies, esophageal injury following ablation is anticipated to be approximately 17% in the control 
group. However, as we do not know the occurrence rate of the primary outcome of esophageal injury using the 
Northwestern ablation technique that would represent the control group nor in the device arm we are unable to 
accurately perform a power calculation for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. We believe that a total of [ADDRESS_1135638] 
lesions identified per patient for comparison between patient groups. The score will be a four-digit number WXYZ 
where each digit represents the number of lesions at each severity level per patient defined as: Z: Grade 1; Y: 
Grade 2; X Grade 3; W: Grade 4. This will be inputted into the following formula in order to calculate the thermal 
injury score for each patient: Score = 1000*W + 100*X + 10*Y + Z.

and standard deviation for continuous variables such as age and standard percentages for categorical variables 
such as gender).
7.3.2 Efficacy Analysis  
This is  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_286540]/or reduction of 
esophageal thermal injury during atrial fibrillation ablation procedures. This analysis will be performed using the 
calculated esophageal lesions score as described above based on the primary outcome data of thermal injury 
occurrence rate, severity (Grade 1-4) of injuries, and number of distinct injuries present between study groups. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_1135640]  Population(s) for Analysis
All patients  enrolled, randomized to a study arm, and complete the initial phase of the study (ablation procedure 
and EGD) will be included for analysis. 
[ADDRESS_1135641], problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, 
or welfare of subjects.
Serious injury:
IRB #: STU00209610-MOD0003 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 7/6/2020 through 6/7/2021.
Version 3.0  (24.Jun.2020) Page 16 of 23Any injury  or illness that is any one of the following: 
life-threatening
results  in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to body structure
necessitates  medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or 
permanent damage to a body structure
8.1.2 Adverse  Event
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the 
course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of 
diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:
results in  study withdrawal
is  associated with a serious adverse event
is  associated with clinical signs or symptoms
leads  to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests
is  considered by [CONTACT_1372]
8.1.3 Serious  Adverse Event
Serious Adverse Event
Adverse events  are classified as serious or non-serious.  A serious adverse event is any AE that is: 
fatal
life-threatening
requires  or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]
results in  persistent or significant disability or incapacity
a  congenital anomaly or birth defect
an important  medical event
Important medical events  are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical 
significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in-patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_60062]. 
All adverse events  that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious adverse 
events. 
8.1.4 Unanticipated  Problems(UP) Involving Risk to Subjects or Others
Any incident, experience,  or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 
Unexpected  in nature, severity, or frequency (i.e. not described in study-related documents such as the IRB-
approved protocol  or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)
Related or  possibly related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly related means there is a reasonable 
possibility that  the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_226592])
Suggests  that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or  social harm).
8.1.5 Preexisting Condition
A preexisting  condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be recorded 
as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.
IRB #: STU00209610-MOD0003 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 7/6/2020 through 6/7/2021.
Version 3.0  (24.Jun.2020) Page 17 of 238.1.6 General  Physical Examination Findings
At screening,  any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the 
study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be 
recorded and documented as an adverse event. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_1135642] to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or 
the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  
8.1.8 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819725] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for 
additional surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for and adverse 
event. 
Neither the condition,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in 
the following circumstances:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_267848] a preexisting 
condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery 
was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819726].
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819727], unless it is a 
worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844].
8.[ADDRESS_1135643], the investigator will seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_71997], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source 
document, and also in the appropriate adverse event case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, 
and clinically significant abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be recorded in the source document, though 
should be grouped under one diagnosis.
All adverse  events occurring during the study period (consent through Visit 3, 3 month follow up) will be recorded.  
The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that 
the study intervention or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of 
the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study intervention or study participation will be recorded 
and reported immediately.
8.3 Classification of Adverse  Events
Severity
Grade  1: mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention is not 
indicated.
Grade  2: moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention is indicated; limiting to age-appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living (ADL; instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16208], using the telephone, managing money, etc.).
Grade  3: severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_286542]; disabling; limiting to self-care ADL (self-care ADL refers to bathing, dressing 
and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden).
Grade  4: life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention is indicated.

Version 3.0  (24.Jun.2020) Page 18 of 23Grade  5: death due to an AE.
Relatedness
1) Definite:  the AE is clearly related to the research procedures
2) Probably:  the AE is likely related to the research procedures
3) Possible:  the AE may be related to the research procedures
4) Unlikely:  the AE is doubtfully related to the research procedures
5) Unrelated:  the AE is clearly not related to the research procedures
Expectedness
AEs must  be assessed as to whether they were expected to occur or were unexpected, meaning not anticipated 
based on current knowledge found in the protocol, investigator brochure, product insert, or label.
Expected: an  AE known to be associated with the intervention or condition under study.
OHRP defines  an unexpected AE as any AE occurring in one or more subjects participating in a research protocol, 
the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with either:
1) the known  or foreseeable risk of AEs associated with the procedures involved in the research that are 
described in a) the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol, any 
applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB-approved informed consent document, and b) other 
relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts; or
2) the expected  natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject(s) 
experiencing the AE and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the AE.
 
8.[ADDRESS_1135644] be reported is defined as the period from the initiation of 
any study procedures (consent) to the end of the study follow-up (Visit3).  Adverse events that do not require 
expedited reporting will be reported in summary to the IRB at continuing review.
8.5 Expedited  Reporting of Events
Any study-related unanticipated  problem posing risk to subjects or others, and any type of serious adverse event 
or unanticipated device reaction, will be reported to the IRB and funding sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event.  Investigators will use the appropriate SAE/UP CRF to record events and a line item will also be added 
to the AE log CRF.
The minimum  necessary information to be provided at the time of the initial expedited event report includes:
Study  identifier
Study  Center
Subject  number
A  description of the event
Date  of onsetCurrent  status
Whether  study intervention was discontinued
The reason  why the event is classified as serious
Investigator  assessment of the association 
between the event and study intervention
8.5.[ADDRESS_1135645] has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new 
information arises that changes the investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow-up report including all relevant 
new or reassessed information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) should be submitted to the IRB. The 
investigator is responsible for ensuring that all events are followed until either resolved or stable. 
IRB #: STU00209610-MOD0003 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 7/6/2020 through 6/7/2021.
Version 3.0  (24.Jun.2020) Page 19 of 238.5.2 Sponsor  reporting: Notifying the Funding Sponsor 
Electronic notification  of any adverse events related to the use of the EnsoETM study device will be sent to the 
funding sponsor as determined by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_36749]. 
8.[ADDRESS_1135646] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject 
authorization informing the subject of the following: 
What protected health  information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study
Who will have  access to that information and why
Who will use  or disclose that information
The  rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI. 
In the  event a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability 
to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked 
authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. 
that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.
9.2 Data  Collection and Management 
Data will  be collected by [CONTACT_286560].  Source and CRFs will be 
entered into a RedCap data management system (DMS).  Participants will be assigned a Participant ID “PID” for 
use on CRF data collection in for entry into the DMS to protect and ensure confidentiality.  
Source data  is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial 
necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.  
Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded 
data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], 
microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x-rays, subject files, and records kept at the 
pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico-technical departments involved in the clinical trial.
The study  case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested on the 
CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the 
procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual 
case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct 
such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such

uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it. 
The study  data will be stored indefinitely.  A de-identified data set may be shared with the funding sponsor.  
9.3 Records  Retention 
Study records, including  administrative and participant related source and CRFs, will be retained for 3 years after 
the completion of the research (often marked by a final progress report). 
10 Study Monitoring, Auditing,  and Inspecting
10.1 Study  Monitoring Plan
The investigator  and research team will allocate adequate time for monitoring activities, as necessary.  The 
Investigator will also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to 
all the above noted study-related documents and study related facilities (e.g. clinical EP laboratories), and has 
adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.
10.2 Auditing and  Inspecting
The investigator  will permit study-related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], government regulatory 
bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. source 
documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the 
capability for inspections of applicable study-related facilities.
Participation as an  investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_116631].
[ADDRESS_1135648] (IRB), in 
agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the IRB 
concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be 
provided to the funding sponsor before commencement of this study if required. The formal consent of a subject, 
using the IRB-approved consent form, must be obtained before that subject undergoes any study procedure.  The 
consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_17257], and the appropriately delegated 
research staff obtaining the consent.
11.1 Risks
Risks of  the ablation procedure will be explained using the clinical procedure consent.
Additional risks  of the study procedures are described below:
EnsoETM device  risks: Placement of the EnsoETM device, similar to any device in the esophagus, can result in or 
exacerbate esophageal  tissue damage, particularly in patients with known esophageal deformity or evidence of 
esophageal trauma. We believe these risks are similar to those whom receive the standard of care temperature 
monitor probes inserted into the esophagus during routine clinical procedures. 
EGD procedure risks:   Diagnostic upper endoscopy procedures are considered very safe and rarely can result in 
complications including  bleeding, infection, and/or perforation. Large studies have reported the occurrence of any

Loss of Confidentiality  Risks:  there is the potential for loss of confidentiality during data collection. 
11.[ADDRESS_1135649] benefits to the participants in this study.  There may be a benefit to warming the 
esophagus to reduce or prevent damage during the ablation procedure.  The knowledge gained by [CONTACT_819735] a whole in the future and potentially lead to additional studies. 
11.3 Risk Benefit  Assessment
The risks  of participating in the study are outweighed by [CONTACT_286562]. 
11.4 Informed  Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization 
Participants will  be provided an IRB approved consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information 
for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study. A verbal review of the consent form 
will take place with the participant and delegated personnel. This consent form will include HIPAA authorization 
language which will also be reviewed with the participant.  The formal consent of a subject, using the IRB-approved 
consent form, will be obtained before that subject undergoes any study procedure.  The consent form must be 
signed by [CONTACT_17257], and the investigator-designated research professional 
obtaining the consent. The participant will be consented in a private clinical space and will be given ample time to 
ask questions and have questions answered.  As the majority of the procedures that will occur are standard of care, 
we will clearly discuss what the research part of the day and days after will include. The voluntary nature of the 
study will be reviewed and participants will be told that should they choose not to consent, their clinical care will not 
be affected.  
11.4.1 Electronic  Consent 
The Northwestern University  IRB approved consent will be developed on the RedCap platform for electronic 
consent. RedCap  is a secure, HIPAA compliant, web-based application for building and managing online data 
capture for  research studies. The consent form built is in RedCap as a survey and mirrors that of the Northwestern 
University IRB approved consent. 
An email  containing a link to the e-Consent will be sent to the patient’s email address provided by [CONTACT_819736]. The email will include the research team’s contact [CONTACT_3031] (phone, NM email) in case the 
subject has questions. The participant can choose to review the consent form with the coordinator over the phone 
or review independently. If the patient decides to participate s/he will complete the consent process by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_819728], date and sign using a mouse or touch screen (depending on device). The research team will receive an 
email notification when participant completes the consent process in RedCap and sign/date and follow-up with the 
participant to ensure all questions are addressed. 
A copy of  the signed consent form will be sent in PDF format automatically upon participant’s signature, along with 
site contact [CONTACT_819737]. Subjects will also be informed they can request a paper copy be mailed 
to them. 
Use of eConsent  provides the following patient benefits: 
Convenience  – Where unnecessary, participants do not have to commute to the research site 
Less  pressure – Participants can review the consent form on their own and with family without feeling 
pressure to sign right away 
More  Informed – Subjects can take their time reading through the form thereby [CONTACT_7328] a more informed 
decision

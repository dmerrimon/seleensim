Protocol Title: A Phase 1 Study of Oral TAK -788 to Evaluate the Drug -Drug Interaction with Itraconazole and 
Rifampin in Healthy Adult Subjects
Study Design:
This is a 2 -part study. Each part will be conducted as an open -label, 2 -period, fixed sequence study with TAK -788 
designed to characterize TAK -788 drug -drug interaction with either a strong cytochrome P -450 (CYP)3A inhibitor, 
itraconazole (Part 1) or with a st rong CYP3A inducer, rifampin (Part 2) in healthy adult subjects. Subjects 
participating in Part 1 will be different from those participating in Part 2. Additionally, Part 1 will be a sequential study
design; Part 1 Cohort 2 will not start until pharmacokin etic (PK) data from Part 1 Cohort 1 (up to Period 2 Day 15) has 
been evaluated. The study parts may be conducted concurrently.
Part 1: TAK -788 assessment with Itraconazole
Part 1 will be conducted in 2 cohorts: Cohort 1 will enroll 4 subjects and will asse ss whether the 20 mg dose of 
TAK -788 is an appropriate dose for the TAK -788/itraconazole drug -drug interaction study; depending on the PK 
results, Cohort 2 will either continue to enroll 8 more subjects at this same dose level or enroll 12 more subjects at a 
revised TAK -788 dose level. Other than the dose of TAK -788, the study design will be exactly the same for each 
cohort. 
This study part will comprise of a screening period, 2 treatment periods and a follow -up pho ne call in up to 16 healthy 
subjects. Dos e administration and PK collection scheme for the treatment period is outlined in the table below.

Abbreviation: PK=Pharmacokinetics; P O=per oral; QD=once daily
On Period 1 Day 1, subjects will receive a single 20 mg oral dose of TAK -788 or a TAK -788 oral dose to be 
determined (TBD) (Cohort 2) as capsules (fasting). A standardized meal will be provided at least 4 hours postdose. 
Subjects will remain in the clinic research unit (CRU) until the morning of Day 4 after the 72 -hour PK sample is 
collected. Additional PK samples will be taken as an outpatient up to 168 hours postdose (Period 1 Day 8, which is the same as Period 2 Day 1). 
In Period 2, subjects will receiv e 200 mg itraconazole once daily (QD) alone as an oral solution on an empty stomach 
(no food from at least [ADDRESS_49825] 2 hours after dosing). Subjects will be admitted to the CRU in Period 2 
Day 4. In the morning of Period 2 Day 5, subjects will receive 200 mg itraconazole together with 20 mg oral TAK-788 
or TBD oral dose of TAK-788 (fasting). A standardized meal will be provided at least 4 hours postdose. Subjects will 
be furloughed from the CRU after the 72 -hour PK sample is collected in t he morning of Period 2 Day 8. There will be 
outpatient visits to the CRU for dosing itraconazole and/or PK sampling from Day [ADDRESS_49826] PK sampling ( Table 3.a) will occur at [ADDRESS_49827] -Day  5 TAK -788 dose

(Period 2 Day 15). 
All PK data (TAK -788 and its 2 active metabolites, AP32960 and AP32914) collected in Cohort 1 (up to Day 15) will 
be evalu ated to determine the dose of TAK -788 administered to subjects in Cohort 2 of the study. The TAK -788 dose 
in Co hort 2 may  remain at 20 mg or may be modified to an appropriate level to approximate a similar exposure 
compared to the geometric mean of single -dose exposure previously observed at 160 mg single dose TAK -788 alone 
in healthy  subjects. 
Part 2: TAK -788 assessment with Rifampin
Part 2 will comprise of a screening period, 2 treatment periods, and a follow -up pho ne call in 12 subjects. Dose

On Period 1 Day 1, a different group of subjects from Part 1 will receive a single 160 mg oral dose of TAK -788 as 
capsules (fasting). A standardized meal will be provided at least 4 hours postdose. Subjects will remain in the CRU 
until the morning of Day 4 after the 72 -hour PK sample is collected. Additional PK samples ( Table 3.b) will be taken 
as an outpatie nt up to 168 hours postdose (Period 1 Day 8, which is the same as Period 2 Day 1). 
In Period 2, subjects will receive 600 mg rifampin QD alone as capsules (fasting). Subjects will be admitted to the 
CRU on Day 6. In the morning of Day 7, subjects will rec eive 160 mg oral TAK -788 together with 600 mg rifampin 
(fasting). A standardized meal will be provided at least 4 hours postdose. Subjects will be furloughed from the CRU after the 72- hour PK sample is collected in the morning of Day 10. There will be outp atient visits to the CRU for 
dosing rifampin and/or PK sampling from Day [ADDRESS_49829] Day 7 dose (Day 14). 
Part 1 and Part 2: 
TAK -788 and rifampin will be orally administered with approximately 240 mL of water. For itraconazole dosing, a 
total aqueous volume of approximately 240 mL will be administered; this will include the dose of itraconazole oral 
solution and two rinses of the full dose unit container with water followed by [CONTACT_47359]. All doses of TAK -788, itraconazole, and rifampin will be administered at the CRU during this study, either during 
confinement or on an outpatient basis.
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_47335] (PFT) is required to be performed and be assessed as normal at screening. 
Post-dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_47336], at the discretion of the 
Investigator or designee. A final safety follow -up pho ne call will occur 30 ± [ADDRESS_49830] TAK -788 dose to determine if any adverse 
events (AEs) have occurred since the last study visit .
Any subject who experiences emesis within [ADDRESS_49831] dosing with TAK -788 will be excluded in the final data 
analy sis. Replacement of discontinued or withdrawn subjects due to any reason will be assessed on a case by [CONTACT_47360] a minimum of 10 PK -evaluable subjects complete in each part of 
study.

the current study.
Main Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:
The following PK parameters will be analyzed for TAK -788 and its active metabolites, AP32960 and AP32914, when 
administered alone and when coadministered with itraconazole (Part 1) or with rifampin (Part 2):
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
The primary endpoints of the study are:
Maximum observed concentration (C max).
Area under the concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_49850] 
quantifiable concentration (AUC ).
Area under the concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_49851] quantifiab le concentration (AUC last). 
Time of first occurrence of C max(Tmax).
Additional Endpoints
In addition, the following plasma PK parameters for TAK -788 and its active metabolites, AP32960 and AP32914 will 
be calculated:
Terminal disposition phase half -life (t½),
Terminal disposition phase rate constant (λ z),
Apparent clearance after extravascular administration (CL/F) for TAK -788 only,
Apparent volume of distribution during the terminal disposition phase after extravascular administration (Vz/F) 
for TAK -788 only.
Safety Endpoints
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_47364] (TEAEs), clinical laboratory values, physical examinations, ECGs, and vital signs
Statistical Considerations:
Pharmacokinetics:
The PK parameters of TAK -788 and its active metabolites (AP32960 and AP32914) will be calculated based on 
plasma concentration -time profiles of TAK -788 and metabolites (AP32960 and AP32914) will be calculated as 
described in Section 11.0, and outlined in the SAP.
A linear mixed -effects model will be used for the analysis on the ln transformed C maxand AUC (AUC lastor AUC tif 
AUC is not available) for TAK -[ADDRESS_49852] transformed combined molar Cmaxand AUC ∞ for TAK -788, AP32960, and 
AP32914. The model will include treatment as a fixed-effect and subject as a random -effect. Each model will include 
calculation of least squares means (LSMs) as well as the difference between treatment LSMs.
Gemetric mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals, consistent with the two one sided test [Schuirmann 1987 ], will be 
calculated using the exponentiation of the diff erence between treatment LSMs from the analyses on the 
ln -transformed C maxand AUC (AUC lastor AUC tif AUC is not available) for TAK -788 as well as the combined 
molar C maxand AUC ∞ of TAK -788, AP32960, and AP32914. These ratios will be expressed as a pe rcentage of the 
following comparisons:
Treatment B (itraconazole+20 mg TAK -788) relative to Treatment A (20 mg TAK -788)
Treatment D (rifampin+160 mg TAK -788) relative to Treatment C (160 mg TAK -788)
And if applicable Treatment F (itraconazole+TBD TAK -788 d ose) relative to Treatment E (TBD TAK -788 dose)
Safety:
Quantitative safety data as well as the difference to baseline, when appropriate, will be summarized using the 
appropriate descriptive statistics.

Protocol Final 16 April 2019
Sample Size Justification:
The sample size calculation was based on the expected 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in the 
paired, log -transformed AUC means of TAK -788 in the absence and presence of itraconazole or rifampin. The 
within -patient coefficient of variation for TAK -788 AUC was estimated to be 17.2% on the basis of data from a 
clinical study conducted in healthy subjects (TAK -788- 1001). If the AUC ratio for TAK -788 in the presence versus 
absence of itraconazole or rifampin is X (an AUC geometric mean ratios (GMR) t o be determined in this study), with 
a sample size of 10, the 90% CI for the AUC ratio is expected to be 0.868X to 1.15X on the basis of the variance 
assumptions.

4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
4.1.1 TAK-788
Aberrant activation of epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) and human epi[INVESTIGATOR_47339] 2 (HER2) plays a causal role in a subset of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other 
cancers. As inhibition of wild-type (WT) EGFR is associated with dose- limiting toxicities, a 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that inhibits oncogenic EGFR and HER2 variants more potently 
than WT EGFR is more likely to be dosed at the more efficacious levels. Multiple classes of 
activating mutations have been identified in EGFR and HER2 that vary widely in their sensitivity 
to available TKIs. TAK-788, formerly known as AP32788, was designed to be a potent, selective 
inhibitor of all activated forms of EGFR and HER2, including exon 20 insertions (not targeted by 
[CONTACT_47366]), more potently than it inhibits WT EGFR.

4.1.[ADDRESS_49861] spectrum antifungal agent which exerts its 
pharmacological action by [CONTACT_47367] P450s (CYPs)-dependent enzymes resulting in 
blocked ergosterol synthesis. It is indicated for the treatment of oropharyngeal and esophageal 
candidiasis. For patients with oropharyngeal candidi asis unresponsive/refract ory to treatment with 
fluconazole tablets, the recommended dose is 100 mg (10 mL) twice a day. The recommended 
dosage of Sporanox®Oral Solution for esophageal candidiasis is 100 mg (10 mL) daily for a 
minimum treatment of 3 weeks. Treatment should continue for 2 weeks following resolution of 
symptoms. Doses up to 200 mg (20 mL) per day may be used based on medical judgment of the 
patient’s response to therapy (Sporanox 2011) .
Itraconazole is highly protein bound (>99%) and penetrates extensively into human tissue, but it 
has limited penetration into the cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872]. Itraconazole is extensively metabolized, 
predominantly by [CONTACT_2750]3A4 enzymes, and is known to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. 
Hydroxyitraconazole is the major metabolite and shows antifungal activity equal to that of the 
parent (Brüggemann et al. 2009) .
Metabolism of itraconazole is saturable and might explain the more than proportional increase in 
itraconazole plasma concentration with increasing single doses and after chronic dosing. Following multiple oral dose administration of itraconazole capsules, peak concentrations are 
observed at approximately 4.5 hours, with an elimination half-life of about 64 hours (compared to 
about 21 hours following a single oral dose). Metabolites of itraconazole are excreted into the 
urine (40% of metabolites) and bile (55% of metabolites) (Brüggemann et al. 2009) . Itraconazole 
is a substrate for and an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of P-gp (Sporanox 2011) .CCI

Protocol Final 16 April 2019
Itraconazole will be used as a strong CYP3A inhibitor in this study, as it is listed as a strong index 
inhibitor of CYP3A 4 in the recommendat ions of the FDA guidance Clinical Drug Interaction 
Studi es -Study  Design, Data Analysis, and Clinical Implicat ions Guidance for Industry  
(FDA 2017). An oral so lution of itraconazole showed higher oral absor ption than an oral capsule 
formulation and dosing on an empt y stom ach will  ensure the greatest oral absorption as 
determined by [CONTACT_47369] (Willems et al . 2001). The maximal inhibit ion of CYP3A 
enzymes is visib le wit h doses of 200 mg or 400 mg ( Peng et al . 2011). However, [ADDRESS_49862] exposure to unnecessary  drug. Oral  administrati on of  100 –[ADDRESS_49863] shown adequat ely strong CYP3A4 inhibitor in 
several itraconazo le DDI studies (Liuet al. 2016).
4.1.3 Rifampin
Rifampin is a semi -synthetic ant ibiotic derivat ive of rifamycin SV which acts by [CONTACT_47370] (DNA) -dependent ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase act ivity in 
suscept ible species of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Its activit y does not impede mammalian 
enzyme RNA po lymerase, therefore it is an effective treatment for both tuberculosis and 
meningococcus infect ions. Rifampin can be administered by [CONTACT_47371] n of 
30minutes to 3 hours. The IV doses are the same as oral doses ( Rifadin 2013 ).
Rifampin is readily absorbed fro m the gastrointestinal tract and is considered to be a highly 
variable drug in healthy adults and pediatric populations. A single oral dose of 600 mg of rifampin in healt hy adults has an average peak serum concentration of 7 μg/mL ranging fro m 4 t o 32 μg/mL 
with an average half -life of 3.35 ±0.66 hours. Gastri c absorpti on wi th food reduces the 
bioavailabilit y of rifampin by [CONTACT_2902] 30%. Rifampin is widely distributed throughout the body and 
can reach effect ive concentrations in various organs and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872]. Rifampin is 80% 
protein bound in the blood whi le the remaining unbound fract ion is not ionized and can readily 
diffuse into tissues (Rifadin 2013).
Rifampin is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_47340]; during this 
process, gradual deacet ylation of the drug occurs so that nearly  all the drug in the bile is in this 
form [ADDRESS_49864] ive and exhibit s ant ibacterial 
properties. Moreover, intestinal reabsorption is reduced by [CONTACT_47372]. 
Rifampin will be used as a strong CYP3A inducer as per the recommended in the FDA guidance Clinical Drug Interaction Studies -Study  Design, Data Analysis, and Clinical Implicat ions 
Guidance for Industry  (FDA 2017 ). Rifam pin dose of 600 mg QD and lead- in doses of 5 –[ADDRESS_49865] ion of CYP3A4 in humans for drug interaction studies

4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study
TAK-788, formerly known as AP32788, was designed to  be a selective inhibitor of all mutant 
forms of EGFR and HER2, including exon 20 insertions (not targeted by [CONTACT_47366]), more 
potently than it inhibits WT EGFR. Although TAK-788 is intended for the treatment of NSCLC, it 
is neither a mutagenic nor genotoxic agent and was generally well tolerated in the previous clinical 
pharmacology studies (TAK-788-1001 and TAK-788-1002, a total of 64 subjects) in healthy 
subjects in the single dose range of 20 – [ADDRESS_49867] irritation during fasting. The maximal inhibition of CYP3A enzymes will be 
achieved with repeated doses of 200 mg itraconazole. The 4 days of lead-in administration of 
itraconazole ensure that CYP3A4 is maximally i nhibited prior to coadmin istration w ith TAK-788. 
Rifampin will be used as a strong CYP3A inducer in this study per the recommendations of the 
FDA guidance Clinical Drug Interaction Studies - Study Design, Data Analysis, and Clinical 
Implications Guid ance for Industry (FDA 2017) . Rifampin was selected as a [ADDRESS_49868] among TAK-788 and 
its active metabolites, oral administration of rifampin will continue for 6 days after 
coadministration of TAK- 788 for sus tainable induction of CYP3A enzymes.
Because TAK-788 is mainly metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A, it is anti cipated that TAK-788 exposure will 
likely be increased significantly  when TAK-788 is conc omitantly administered with itraconazole. 
The itraconazole drug -drug interaction assessment portion of this study (Part 1) will consist of two CCI

active metabo lites (AP32960 and AP32914) is current ly unknown, the planned dose of TAK -788 
(with itraconazol e) for Cohort [ADDRESS_49870] single dose of 160 mg evaluated in healt hy subjects. PK data will be reviewed after d osing 
a cohort of 4 subjects in order to confirm the dose for the second cohort. TAK -788 dose in the 
second cohort may  be modified (based on data from Cohort 1) to select a dose that would be 
anticipated during co -administration wit h itraconazole to achiev e exposures similar to the 
previously observed exposures at the 160 mg single dose alone in healt hy subjects. The dose of 
TAK -788 selected for the drug- drug interaction study  with rifampin (Part 2) will be 160 mg 
(recommended Phase 2 dose).
Similar to most oncol ogy drugs, ≤25% loss in TAK -788 exposure when conco mitantly 
administered with a CYP inducer and ≤30% increase in exposure when conco mitantly 
administered with a CYP inhibitor can be inferred not to be clinically relevant to efficacy and 
safet y when v iewed in context of moderate TAK -788 PK variabilit y (43% CV for AUC in cancer 
patients) ( Teo et al. 2014, IB 2019 ).
4.3 Benefit/Risk Profile
The clinical safet y data available as of [ADDRESS_49871] commo n 
treatm ent-emergent AEs (TEAE) occurring in ≥20% of patients by [CONTACT_47373] 79 (78.2%), nausea 40 (39.6%), decreas ed appeti te 31 (30.7%), rash 30 (29.7%), vomit ing 
24 (23.8%) and fat igue 23 (22.8%). The most commo n TEAE occurring in ≥20% of pat ients 
overall by [CONTACT_47374] 69 (68.3%), nausea 30 (29.7%), rash 26 (25.7%), and 
decreased appet ite 21 (20.8%) which are commo nly observed wi th other EGFR TKIs ( IB 2019 ).
There will be no direct health benefit for study participants fro m receipt of study drugs. An indirect 
healt h benefit to the healt hy subjects enro lled in this study is the free m edical  tests received at 
screening and during the study .
The ri sk of dosing itraconazo le and rifampin in combinat ion with TAK -788 is unknown in this 
study . However, the risk of dose of itraconazo le plus TAK -788 administered in Part 1 and the dose
or rifampin plus TAK -788 administered in Part 2 are anticipated to be similar to those previously 
reported for each o f the individual drugs as reported in the TAK -788 IB, and in the full prescribing 
inform ation for Sporanox®and Rifadin®since i traconazol e and rifampin are administered 
according to the dosing recommendations found therein.
The inclusio n and exclusio n criteria, screening, and safet y monitoring practices emplo yed by  [CONTACT_47375]  (i.e., 12 l ead ECG, vi tal signs, clinical laboratory  tests, AE questioning, PFT 
(spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]), and physical examinat ion are adequate to protect the subject’s safety and should 
detect all TEAEs.

6.2 Dose Escalation
Part 1 will be conducted in 2 cohorts: Cohort 1 will enroll 4 subjects and will assess whether the 
20mg dose of TAK -788 i s an appropri ate dose for the TAK -788/i traconazole drug -drug 
interact ion study  (see Secti on 4.2); depending on the PK results, Cohort 2 will eit her continue to 
enroll 8 more subjects at this same dose level (20 mg) or enroll 12 more subjects at a revised 
TAK -788 dose level (TBD dose TAK -788). Other than the dose of TAK -788, the study design will 
be exact ly the same for each cohort. 
A sequent ial dosing design was selected to dose subjects in [ADDRESS_49883] cohort of 4 subjects 
will be studied unt il the end of Period 2 Day  15 and PK will be revie wed. The dose may be 
maintained for Cohort 2 or raised to a maximum of 160 mg while ensuring the drug interaction between TAK -788 and itraconazo le does not exceed the exposure of TAK -788 l evels previously 
seen in healt hy adult subjects. The dose level for TAK -788 in Cohort 2 will be a dose anticipated 
during coadministration wit h itraconazole to achieve exposures similar to the previously observed 
exposures at the 160 mg single dose alone in healt hy subjects.

There will be no dose modificat ions for Part 2.
6.3 Rationale for Study Design, Dose, and Endpoints
6.3.1 Rationale of Study Design and Dose
Part 1:
Because TAK -788 i s mainly metabo lized by [CONTACT_097]3A, it is ant icipated that TAK -788 exposure will 
likely  be increased si gnificant ly when TAK -788 i s concomitant ly adminis tered wi th itraconazole. 
The itraconazo le drug -drug interaction assessment portion of this study (Part 1) will consist of two 
cohorts. As the magnitude of the effect of strong CYP3A inhibit ion on the PK of TAK -788 and its 
active metabo lites (AP32960 and AP [ZIP_CODE]) is current ly unknown, the planned dose of TAK -788 
(with itraconazol e) for Cohort [ADDRESS_49884] single dose of 160 mg evaluated in healt hy subjects. PK data will be reviewed after dosing 
a cohort of 4 subjects in order to confirm the dose for the second cohort. TAK -788 dose in the 
second cohort may  be modified (based on data from Cohort 1) to select a dose that would be 
anticipated during co -administration wit h itraconazole to achieve exposur es similar to the 
previously observed exposures at the 160 mg single dose alone in healt hy subjects. The dose of 
TAK -788 selected for the drug- drug interaction study  with rifampin (Part 2) will be 160 mg 
(recommended Phase 2 dose).
In thi s first study  part, subjects will be dosed with TAK -[ADDRESS_49885] a drug -drug interaction 
[Varis et al. 2000 , Yoshitzato et al. 2012 ]. Dosing of itraconazole after Day 5 unt il the end of the 
PK sampling time will ensure cont inued inhi bition of CYP3A. Varis_2000 Yoshizato_2012
No clinically significant drug -drug interaction may be conclusive if ≤30% increase in exposure to 
TAK -788 or combined mo lar exposure to TAK -788, AP3296 0, and AP32914 will occur when 
concomitant ly administered with a strong CYP3A inhibitor. A change of this magnitude may be 
inferred not to be clinically relevant to safet y when viewed in the context of moderate TAK -788 
PK vari ability (approximately  43% CV for AUC 24in cancer patients).
Part 2:
In the second study part, subjects will be dosed with TAK -[ADDRESS_49886] ion after 5 –7 days of lead-in dosing 
[Duus et al. 2018, Upreti et al. 2011, Srinivas 2016 ]. A dose of [ADDRESS_49887] ion in previous literature. Rifampin will cont inue to be administered until 
the end of the PK sampling time in Period 2 to maintain induction levels. 
The dose of TAK -788 selected for the drug-drug interaction study  with rifampin (Part 2) will be 
160 m g (recommended Phase 2 dose). Since a reduction in exposure is ant icipated the 
coadministration of these two study  drugs shoul d be well -tolerated.

A ≤25% l oss in TAK -788 exposure or combined m olar exposure to TAK -788, AP32960, and 
AP32914 when concomitant ly administered with a strong CYP inducer may be inferred not to be 
clinically relevant to efficacy when viewed in context of moderate TAK -788 PK vari ability 
(approximately 43% CV for AUC 24in cancer patients).
Part 1 and Part 2:
On PK days, all study medicat ion (TAK -788 alo ne, TAK -788 plus itraconazo le, or TAK -788 plus 
rifampin) will be given after an overnight fast of at least [ADDRESS_49888] 
after dosing to avo id interference of food. On other dosing days, itraconazole will be administered 
on an empt y stom ach (no food from at least [ADDRESS_49889] 2 hours after dosing) and 
rifampin will be administered under fasted conditions. 
6.3.2 Rationale for Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
The pharmacokinet ic endpo ints are standard for this ty pe of study .
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Endpoints 
The key safet y endpo ints are typi[INVESTIGATOR_47341] [ADDRESS_49890] dosing and may be used in the future to 
perform  metabo lite profiling. Tubes or container will be ident ified wit h a barcode using an 
appropriate label.
No di seases/condit ions, deoxy ribonucleic acid, or ribo nucleic acid will be the focus of these 
analyses. The analyses will focus on metabo lite prof iling for TAK -[ADDRESS_49891] 
access to the sam ples and/or the data that resulted from the analysis, if performed. 
By [CONTACT_12568], subjects agree to the possible future analysis of these samples. At any time, the 
subjects can contact [CONTACT_47376] e PK

[IP_ADDRESS] Plasma PK Measurements
PK parameters for plasma TAK -788 and metabo lites AP32960 and AP32914 concentrations will 
be calculated as follows, as appropri ate, following oral administration:
AUC last: The area under the concentration versus time curve, from time [ADDRESS_49939] 
observed non- zero concentration, as calculated by  [CONTACT_47389].
AUC t Area under the concentration -time curve from  time 0 to time t
AUC : The area under the concentration versus time curve, from time 0 
extrapol ated to infinit y. AUCis calculated as AUC tor AUC last plus the ratio 
of the l ast m easurable blood concentration to the eliminat ion rate constant.
AUC %extrap : Percent of AUC extrapol ated, represented as ([ADDRESS_49940]/AUC)*100.
CL/F Apparent total plasma clearance after oral (extravascular) administration, 
calculated as Dose/AUC (TAK -788 only).
Cmax: Maximum observed concentration.
tmax: Time to reach C max. If the m aximum  value occurs at m ore than one time 
point, t maxis defined as the first time po int with this value.
t½: Apparent first -order terminal eliminat ion half-life will be calculated as 
0.693/λ z.
Where λ zis the apparent first order terminal elimination rate constant 
calculated from  a semil og pl ot of  the pl asma concentrati on versus time 
curve. The parameter will be calculated by  [CONTACT_47390] -squares -regression 
analysis using the maximum number of points i n the terminal log- linear 
phase (e.g., three or more non -zero plasma concentrations).
Vz/F Apparent volume o f distribut ion during the terminal eliminat ion phase after 
oral (extravascular) administration, calculated as Dose/(AUC x λ z) 
(TAK -788 only).
No value for λ z, AUC , AUC %extrap , CL/F, Vz/F, or t½ will be reported for cases that do not exhibit  
a terminal log -linear phase in the concentration versus time profile. 
No PK parameters will be calculated for subjects with detectable concentrations at 2 or fewer

TAK -[ADDRESS_49942] who has 
signed inform ed consent to participate in a study; it does not necessarily  have to have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a cli nically significant abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a drug, whether or 
not it is considered related to the drug.
An untoward finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a preexist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing condit ions or underlying disease should not be considered AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discontinuation or a change in dose of st udy medicat ion or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_47392].
Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately  as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory  values or ECG parameters maybe considered AEs if they are judged to 
be clinically  significant (i e, if som e act ion or intervent ion is required or if the Invest igator 
judges the change to be beyo nd the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A l aboratory  
re-test and/or continued m onitoring of an abnormal value are not considered an intervention. In 
addition, repeated or addit ional noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluat ion or m onitoring 
of an abnorm ality is not considered an intervention.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
A pre -exist ing condit ion (present at the time o f signing of informed consent) is considered a 
concurrent medical history  condi tion and shoul d NOT be recorded as an AE. A baseline 
evaluat ion (eg, laboratory  test, ECG, X -ray, etc) shoul d NOT be recorded as an AE unless 
related to a study  procedure. Howev er, if the subject experiences a worsening or complicat ion

of such a concurrent medical history  condi tion, the worsening or complication should be 
recorded appropriately as an AE (worsening or complicat ion occurs after informed consent is 
signed). Invest igators shoul d ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the 
condi tion (eg, “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_45283] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]), any occurrence of an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_47349] e more frequent, seri ous, or 
severe in nature, that is, Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change from Baseline in the condit ion (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent condition (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis), 
worsening of the condit ion should only be captured as an AE if occurring to a greater extent to 
that which would be expected. Again, Invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Worsening of AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complicatio n of an AE aft er the first administration of 
study  medicat ion or after any  change in study  medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion 
shoul d be recorded as a new AE. Invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Changes in severit y of AEs:
If the subject experiences a change in the severit y of an AE that is not associated with a change 
in study  medica tion, the event shoul d be captured once with the maximum severit y recorded.
Prepl anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
inform ed consent are not considered AEs. However, if a pr eplanned procedure is performed 
early (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the worsening o f 
the condi tion shoul d be captured appropriately  as an AE. Com plicati ons resul ting fro m any 
planned surgery  should be reported as A Es.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as AEs but should be documented in the subject’s source documents. 
Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery  should be reported as AEs.
Overdose:
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of investigational

10.2 AE Procedures
10.2.1 Assigning Severity/Intensity of AEs
In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any  laboratory  abnorm ality, will be determined 
using the National Cancer Inst itute, Commo n Termino logy Criteria f or Adverse Events (NCI 
CTCAE), versio n 5.0, dated 27 November 2017 [ CTCAE 2017]. Cl arificati on shoul d be m ade 
between an SAE and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 or 4) because the terms 
serious and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term severe is often used to describe the 
intensity (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may  be of  relatively minor 
medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is NOT the same as serious , which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria described above and is usually  associa ted wi th 
events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or abilit y to functi on. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does 
not necessarily need to be considered serious. For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3
to <2000/mm3is considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not 
intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory  reporting obligations.

10.2.2 Assigning Causality of AEs
The rel ationship of each AE to study  medicati on(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing 
categori es:
Relat ed: An AE that fo llows a reasonable temporal sequence fro m administration of a 
drug (including the course after withdrawal o f the drug), or for whi ch a causal  
relationship is at least a reasonable possibilit y, i.e., the rel ationship cannot be 
ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, 
complicat ions, conco mitant drugs and concurrent treatments, may also be 
responsible.
Not Rel ated: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence fro m ad ministration 
of a drug and/ or that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as 
underlying diseases, complicat ions, conco mitant medi cations and concurrent 
treatm ents.
10.2.[ADDRESS_49946] signs/symptoms were noted by  [CONTACT_423] a nd/or 
Invest igator.
10.2.[ADDRESS_49947] died.
10.2.5 Action Taken With Study Treatment
Drug withdrawn –a study  medicat ion is stopped due to the particula r AE.
Dose not changed –the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study  medicat ion.
Unknown –only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.
Not applicable –a study  medicat ion was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE 
eg,the study  has been terminated, the subject died, dosing with study  medicat ion had not y et 
started or dosing wit h study  medicat ion was already  stopped before the onset of the AE.
Dose reduced –the dose was reduced due to the particular AE.
Dose increased –the dose was increased due to the particular AE.
Drug interrupted –the dose was interrupted due to the particular AE.
10.2.6 Outcome 
Recovered/reso lved –subject retu rned to first assessment status with respect to the AE.

Recovering/resolving –the intensit y is lowered by  [CONTACT_45332] m ore stages: the diagnosis has or 
signs/symptom s have alm ost disappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has 
not returned to the norm al range or to the baseline value; the subject died from a cause other 
than the particular AE with the condit ion rem aining “recovering/resolving.”
Not recovered/not resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of thediagnosis, signs/symptoms or laboratory  value on the l ast day  of the observed 
study peri od has beco me worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital ano maly; the 
subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE state remaining “Not recove red/not 
resolved.”
Recovered/Resolved with sequelae –the subject recovered fro m an acute AE but was left wit h 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis).
Fatal  –an AE that is considere d as the cause of death.
Unknown –the course of the AE cannot be fo llowed up due to hospi [INVESTIGATOR_47350]’s participation in the study .

11.3 Determination of Sample Size
The sample size calculat ion was based on the expected 2 -sided 90% CI for the difference in the 
paired, l og-transform ed AUC means of TAK -788 in the absence and presence of itraconazole or 
rifampin. The within -patient coefficient of variation for TAK -788 AUC was est imated to be 
17.2% on the basis of data from a clini cal study  conducted in healt hy subjects (TAK -788- 1001). If 
the AUC ratio for TAK -788 in the presence versus absence of itraconazole or rifampin is X (an 
AUC GMR to be determined in this study ), with a sam ple size of 10, the 90% CI for the AUC 
ratio is expected to be 0.868X to 1.15X on the basis of the variance assumpt ions.
Up to 28 healthy adult subjects will be enrolled int o 2 Parts (up to 16 in Part 1, and 12 in Part 2) to

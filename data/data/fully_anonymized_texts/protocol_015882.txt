 1 Background  
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of death in the [LOCATION_002] 
and worldwide. In [ADDRESS_46400] involved 5 –8Fr 
shea ths with hemostasis achieved with manual compression at the vascular access 
site.[ADDRESS_46401]/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44220]. Arteriotomy closure devices were introduced in 1995 as adjuncts or 
alternatives  to manual compression in an attempt to reduce vascular complications, 
reduce time to hemostasis and ambulation and improve patient comfort.5 Currently, a 
number of vascular closure devices (VCD) exist for closure of small femoral arterial 
access sites. Th ese devices are categorized by [CONTACT_44242] -Seal™ ( Terumo Corporation , Tokyo, JP ); clip -based closure  : 
StarClose SE ® (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA,  [LOCATION_003]); sealing agents: Mynx ® 
(AccessClosure, Mountain View , CA, [LOCATION_003]); and sutures for placement around the 
femoral artery: Prostar XL® Percutaneous Vascular Surgical Device and Perclose 
ProGlide ® Suture -Mediated Closure System (Abbott Vascular, CA, [LOCATION_003]).[ADDRESS_46402] primary been developed for peri pheral interventions.

 1.1 Need For Large Arteriotomy VCD  
An increasing number of interventional procedures require large -sheath technology (> 
12 Fr), including abdominal aortic aneurysm repair,  thoracic aortic aneurysm repair,  
balloon valvuloplasty, percutane ous aortic valve replacement, and a variety of 
percutaneous ventricular -assist devices. These procedures create challenges for 
hemostasis and minimization of vascular complications. The ability to achieve access 
and closure without surgical cut -down has be come an important part of the vascular 
closure device arena.  
 
Aortic stenosis is a disease with a long latency period followed by [CONTACT_44243] - approximately 50% of untreated patients will die within 
the first 2 year s after symptoms appear.7,8 Surgical replacement of the aortic valve in the 
absence of serious co -morbidities is associated with low operative mortality. However, 
approximately 30% of patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis do not undergo 
surgery due to  advanced age, left ventricular dysfunction, and/or presence of multiple 
co-existing conditions.4, 5 For these high -risk patients, a less invasive treatment, such as 
percutaneous aortic balloon valvuloplasty (BAV), introduced in [ADDRESS_46403]. Cribier , is a 
less invasive alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for severe aortic 
stenosis in high risk patients.9 The procedure , generally carried out from a transfemoral 
artery approach, involves placement of one or more balloons across a sten otic valve 
followed by [CONTACT_44244].10 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_44221], 
early enthusiasm for BAV was tempered due to high restenosis rates and a failure to 
improve survival rates.11, 12 Echocardiographic restenosis rates at 1 yea r were reported

experiencing a resurgence largely due to improvements in BAV techniques, changing 
patterns and indications for use, and outcome improvements from initial reports .8, 13 
 
The development of the TAVR/TAVI technique in clinical practice has also generated the 
need for VCD capable of accomplishing effective hemostasis after large diameter 
arteriotomies (up to 24Fr, recently down to 14Fr) as vascular access and closure 
remains a challenge.[ADDRESS_46405] reported randomized stud ies to compare the safety and efficacy of percutaneous 
access with surgical  cutdown in transfemoral TAVR demonstrated no difference in the

 primary endpoint of VARC -2 major and minor complications .16 The overall rate of V ARC -
2 major vascular complications in the study was 13%. A recent meta -analysis of studies 
reporting on percutaneous (PC) versus surgical cut -down (SC) access in TAVR resulted 
in the inclusion of [ADDRESS_46406] similar safety profiles and 
outcomes when used appropriately in selected patients.  
 
Minimally invasive approaches for the treatment of other forms of aortic pathology such 
as endovascular aortic repa ir procedures are now also very common. Endovascular 
aneurysm repair (or endovascular aortic repair /EVAR) , is a type of endovascular surgery 
used to treat pathology of the aorta, most commonly an abdominal aortic aneurysm 
(AAA). EVAR, invented in the early  1990’s, involves placing a stent graft into the 
aneurysm. Over the years the procedure has been refined to include new generation 
stent -graft and delivery systems. Studies have shown that patients treated with EVAR or 
traditional open surgery demonstrated  fewer early complications with the minimally 
invasive approach and some studies have also observed a lower mortality rate with 
EVAR.18, 19 
 
When used to treat thoracic aortic disease, the procedure is termed thoracic 
endovascular aortic/aneurysm repair (T EVAR). Originally developed by [CONTACT_44245] 1984 
using the same p rinciples as EVAR20, TEVAR  also involves the percutaneous placement 
of an expandable stent graft within the aorta.  
 
1.2 Current Large Arteriotomy VCDs  
Although BAV, TAVR/TAVI, EVAR, and TEVAR are less invasive alternatives to  
conventional surgical approaches, large sized delivery sheaths are still required.  
Management of the arterial access sites often represent a challenge and usually 
requires prolonged manual compression or alternatively suture -mediated closure 
techniques, two of which are commercially available. The Pro star XL was originally 
approved in the US and EU for closure of 5 –8Fr access sites and has since gained a CE 
mark for up to 24Fr. The Perclose Pro Glide® was originally approved for 5 -8Fr and now 
is approved for up to 21Fr. The ProStar® XL, which provides f our suture needles but, as

devices are required. More recently, a technique has been described using three 
ProGlides; this presumably grabs more segments of the arterial wa ll and provides 
redundancy in case one of the closures fails.21 In the ProGlide® US FDA approval study, 
the majority of cases used two (74%) or three (18%) devices and some  
used four (4%) and five (2%) closure devices in the procedure.22 
 
1.2.1  Clinical Experien ce With Suture -Based VCDs  
Extensive published clinical experience with the suture based ProGlide and Prostar XL 
for percutaneous closure of large arterial access sites demonstrate relatively high rate of 
technical success and low access -related complication rates with ranges of 81 -100% 
and 6 -19% respectively.15, [ADDRESS_46408] failure rate (2.1%), when deployment was unsuccessful, it was 
associated with the highest vascular complication rate as compared t o unsuccessful 
deployment of suture -based or nitinol clip -based VCDs. Deployment failure of suture 
based  VCDs did not impact the vascular complication rate as compared with its  
successful deployment. It was proposed by [CONTACT_44246], in part, to the 
availability of a “bailout” mechanism in the event of deployment failure that permits 
control of the arteriotomy site with sheath replacement or a second attempt at closure 
with VCDs. No bailout mechanism is readily available for the collagen plug -based or the 
nitinol clip -based VCDs.

interventional catheterization procedures using 8F r to 18F r sheaths.  The Cross -SealTM 
System includes the Cross -SealTM Device and three accessories ( Cross -SealTM Knot 
Tyer, Cross -SealTM Knot Pusher, and Cross -SealTM Suture Trimmer). The concept is 
similar to the suture -based VCDs described above but is designed to reduce the 
possible number of devices needed to close  the arteriotomy and to reduce the steps 
required. One device deploys two (2) sutures in three (3) steps. Therefore, in addition to 
the aforementioned potential advantages of suture -based VCDs, other potential 
advantages of the Cross -SealTM System include reduction in number of devices required 
and ease of use . 
 
1.4 Description of Device  
The Cross -SealTM Suture Mediated Vascular Closure Device System ( Cross -SealTM 
System) includes the Cross -SealTM Device and three accessories ( Cross -SealTM Knot 
Tyer, Cross -SealTM Knot Pusher, and Cross -SealTM Suture Trimmer). The Cross -SealTM 
Device ( Figure 1 ) is composed of a Catheter, Suture Delivery System and Handle.  The 
device tracks over a standard 0.038” or 0.035” (minimum length 130  cm) guidewire. A 
HEMOSTASIS VALVE loca ted in the middle of the CATHETER limits blood flow from the 
GUIDEWIRE PORT through the CATHETER with or without the guidewire in place.  The 
Suture Delivery System contains NEEDLES, LOCATOR WINGS, and the NEEDLE 
BARREL that control suture placement around  the arteriotomy. The Handle contains the 
SLIDER, BLEEDING INDICATOR, PLUNGER, RESET 1 BUTTON (SLIDER 
RETRACTOR), and RESET 2 BUTTON  (LOCATOR WINGS RETRACTOR). The 
SLIDER triggers a mechanism that opens the LOCATOR WINGS and creates a 
sandwich configuratio n to stabilize the delivery system within the vessel wall. The

 BLEEDING INDICATOR connects to a lumen that has an intraluminal port positioned at 
the distal end of the Suture Delivery System to allow back bleeding  which ensures the 
Suture Delivery System is positioned properly in the femoral artery. The NEEDLE 
BARREL keeps the Cross -SealTM Device from moving deeper inside the vessel, 
stabilizes the device once the LOCATOR WINGS are open and retrieves the disengaged 
suture -carrying NEEDLES. The PLUNGER trig gers the NEEDLES to deploy the sutures 
and simultaneously closes the LOCATOR WINGS.

The Cross -SealTM System includes the following three accessories:  
 
1) Cross -SealTM Knot Tyer is used to provide pre -tie fisherman’s knots (also 
named Improve Clinch Knot) in the suture.  
2) Cross -SealTM Knot Pusher is used to advance pre -tied knots percutaneously 
to the top of the arteriotomy and secure the knots.  
3) Cross -SealTM Suture Trimmer is used to cut sutures after knots are 
delivered and secured to the top of the arteriotomy.  
 
The Cross -SealTM Knot Tyer ( Figure 2 ) is used for making a Fisherman’s knot.  
• The TOP and SIDE HO OK are used to hook the two ends of suture.  
• The RING TAB, which is connected to PRELOAD STRING, is pulled to trigger 
the process of making the knot. The non -rail end of suture will be brought into 
a preconfigured PRELOAD STRING on the ROTOR.   
• The SLIDER i s activated to release the loops and slide down the knot.

1.5 Summary of Clinical Studies  
 
1.5.1  Clinical Feasibility (FIH) Study  
A First -in-Human clinical study was conducted to assess the initial safety and 
feasibility of the Cross -SealTM System GEN 1 .0 to facilitate hemostasis in patients 
undergoing percutaneous transcatheter interventions involving access through the 
femoral arte ry using an 8 -18Fr introducer sheath. Results are demonstrated as 
shown in Table 1 . A total of ten (10) subjects were enrolled at a single site in 
Asuncion, Paraguay between October 26 and 27, 2015. A total of 10 patients 
completed the study. As shown in Table 1 , the patient population consisted of 6 
(60%) men and 4 (40%) women with a mean age of 66.0 years (range 56.3 to 80.2 
years) and mean BMI of 29.2 kg/m2 (range 24.2 to 36.7). The mean estimated 
diameter of femoral artery lumen at the closure site was 9.0 mm and ranged from 
7.1 to 11.0 mm as measured via duplex ultrasound. Size  14Fr introducers were 
utilized in 2 patients and 18Fr introducers were used in 8 patients. The mean

 Cross -SealTM System procedure time was 4 minutes (range 1 -8) and mean TTH 
was 3 minutes and 5 seconds (range 0 -13:00). Total estimated blood loss 
including the interventional procedure was 97.2 mL (range 50 -150). The mean 
Time-to-Ambulation was 3 hours and 12 minutes (range 1:25 -9:12) and mean 
time-to-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -discharge was 18 hours  and 17 minutes (range 14:05 to 22:22). 
Four adverse events occurred in 3 patients; [ADDRESS_46411] obstructive flow in the femoral artery. None of the adverse events were 
serious or unanticipated. All of the events reported were re lated to the procedure 
and not to the device and were resolved without any further action required. 100% 
of patients met the Cross -SealTM System success defined as closure of the 
arteriotomy without the need for any access site related adjunctive surgical or 
endovascular procedures stemming from hemorrhagic, infectious, or ischemic 
complications. 100% of the patients met the primary and sec ondary safety 
endpoints - none had a major or minor vascular complication directly related to the 
Cross -SealTM System as defined by [CONTACT_44248] -2 (Valve Academic Research 
Consortium -2). The results of this feasibility study demonstrated that the Cross -
SealTM System is safe and performed as intended.

1.5.2   CE Study  
The CE study was a prospective, multi -center, and single arm study conducted in 
OUS countries. The primary endpoint of effectiveness was technical success 
defined as closure of the arteriotomy without the need for any access -site-related 
adjunctive surgica l or endovascular procedures. The primary endpoint of safety 
was freedom from major VARC -2 events within 30 days of the procedure. Results 
are demonstrated as shown in Table 2. 
 
A total of twenty -six (26) subjects were enrolled across 5 sites in Australia (1), New 
Zealand ( 3), and Taiwan (1), between May 30, 2017 and January 12, 2018.  Study 
results from the total of 26 patients’ data were monitored and shown in  Table 2 . 
The patie nt population consisted of 20 (77%) men and 6 (23%) women with a 
mean age of 76.5 years (range 33 – 91 years) and mean BMI is 25.7 (range 20.7 -

8Fr introducer sheath was utilized in 1 (3.85%) subject, 9Fr introducer sheath was 
utilized in 1 (3.85%) subject, 10Fr introducer sheat hs were utilized in 3 (11.54%) 
subjects, 12Fr introducer sheaths were utilized in 5 (19.23%) subjects, 14Fr 
introducer sheaths were utilized in 7 (26.92%) subjects, 16Fr introducer sheaths 
were utilized in 3 (11.54%) subjects and 18Fr introducer sheaths we re utilized in 6 
(23.08%) subjects. The mean TTH was 1 minute and 11 seconds (range 00:01 – 
11:54). The mean estimated total blood loss including the interventional procedure 
was 158 ml (range 5 – 600 ml).  
 
A successful ipsilateral “pre -close” percutaneous  technique, defined as closure 
with the  Cross -SealTM System, was achieved in 100% of the subjects with no major 
ipsilateral access site vascular complication at 30 days follow -up.

There were 35 adverse events which occurred in 12 subjects. Among the events, 
one is device related, one is probably device related, and 33 are non -device 
related. All adverse events related to access sites complications are in freedom 
from major VARC -2 events within 30 days of the procedure.  
 
One (1) “device related ” adverse event occurred as the operators passed the 
device between the catheter  too quickly  at > 90 degree s that led to pre -damage  of 
the guidewire catheter  port. The device was then withdrawn from the tortuous 
vessel resulting  in catheter breakage. The broken portion was successfully 
removed and access site closure was achieved using a second Cross -SealTM 
device. The IFU and training materials were updated accordingly to reinforce the 
importance of passing the device coaxially with an angle less than 60 degree s to 
prevent catheter bending or cracking. Additional on -site training s were provided to 
the operators with agreement that under normal use condition s, catheter breakage 
should not  occur . After training, no catheter bending  or kinking was observed in the 
following 21 cases.  
 
One “probably device related ” adverse event,  a small ps eudoaneuysm, was 
observed. Such event s are expected potential adverse events from suture -

7 General Procedures  
 
7.1 Baseline/Pre -Procedure Visit  
Prior to the procedure, subjects must sign the informed consent form, meet all of the 
inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria and complete the following assessments:  
 
The following baseline evaluations are required within 30 days prior to  the Index 
Procedure unless otherwise specified:  
• Informed Consent Form  
• Eligibility Criteria  
• Blood Tests including Complete Blood Count (CBC), Platelet Count, Serum 
Creatinine, Hemoglobin (HGB), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), and Hematocrit 
(HCT) to assess eligibility crit eria (collected within 2 weeks prior to index 
procedure)  
• Medical History/Demographics  
• Pregnancy test if female of child -bearing potential (within [ADDRESS_46442] of care ) 
• Target limb  standard of care  CT Imaging to docum ent eligibility  criteria 
requirements for CFA diameter and stenosis (performed up to 6 months prior to 
index procedure)  
• Concomitant Medications (Anticoagulation / Antiplatelets Only)  
 
Note:  For subject s that do not have a standard of care  CT Imaging modality, a micro 
puncture and angiogram intra -procedure, may be utilized to confirm eligibility criteria.  
 
Clinical Investigational Plan  
Cross -SealTM IDE Trial  
Protocol Number:  TIS2018 -[ADDRESS_46443] their scheduled interventional procedure (i.e., index procedure) performed in 
accordance with investigator/investigational site standard practices. Subjects on warfarin 
or anti -Xa inhibitors must be managed per institutional pre -interventional procedure 
standard of care.  
 
Prior to the use of the investigational device, the investigator will assess the subject for 
the intra -procedure eligibility criteria to confirm enrollment in the study. If the subject is 
enrolled (i.e., signed informed consent and meets all eligibility c riteria, including intra -
procedural), the investigational device will be utilized for femoral artery closure according 
to the IFU.  Enrolled subjects must also receive anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet 
medication during the index procedure in accordance wit h the IFU.  
 
If the subject does not meet all eligibility criteria, the subject cannot be enrolled. The 
subject will be considered a screen ing failure and will not have the investigational device 
utilized. The investigator will perform the femoral artery cl osure according to their 
standard practice and the subject will not be followed as part of the study protocol. After 
completion of the interventional procedure, subjects will be treated in accordance with 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44228].   
 
Note:  Only one single access site per subject will be eligible for use of the 
investigational device  and any additional access sites will be managed according to the 
operator’s standard of care. It is recommended the investigational device be used on th e 
primary access site (i.e., ipsilateral) as on the side with the intended larger procedural 
sheath size.  Should the procedure require a sheath that exceeds 18Fr  at the primary 
access site  (i.e., does not meet the eligibility criteria), the subject may st ill be enrolled if 
the secondary access site (i.e., contralateral to the primary access site) is within the 
acceptable range of 8 -18Fr and meets the eligibility criteria.  
 
At the end of the index procedure  and p rior to closure of the arteriotomy with the 
investigational device , the Activated Clotting Time (ACT ) for heparinized subjects will be 
determined. It is required that the ACT < 350 seconds immediately prior to sheath 
removal to minimize the risk of bleeding; the investigator may use their standard o f care 
and/or medication to control the ACT.  In addition, if uncontrolled hypertension (systolic

(Systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg) is observed just prior to planned vascula r closure, 
every effort should be made to appropriately manage according to the investigator’s 
standards of care.  
 
After the vascular closure has been completed, cutaneous or subcuta neous oozing may 
be treated with light (non -occlusive) pressure applied to the access site manually, with a 
dressing, or as per the investigator’s standard procedure for suture -mediated closure 
devices. Such oozing will not affect the TTH assessment or be consid ered an adverse 
event unless severe enough to require further treatment (i.e. surgery or other 
intervention). TTH, defined as elapsed time from procedural sheath removal to the first 
observed cessation of CFA bleeding (excluding cutaneous or subcutaneous o ozing  at 
access site ), will be recorded.  If a sheathless system is used during the procedure, TTH 
will be calculated from final introducer sheath removal to first observed cessation of CFA 
bleeding (excluding cutaneous or subcutaneous oozing  at access site ) in the target limb.  
 
In the event of  failure to achieve hemostasis  following use of the investigational device 
and based on the investigator’s assessment  of bleeding , a bail -out method  such as 
manual compression, compression assisted devices , secondary c losure device  and/or a 
surgical repair to obtain hemostasis should be performed according to the investigator’s 
standard practice and the subject will be followed per the protocol.  Should a secondary 
closure device be utilized for the bail -out method, it must be commercially available and 
cannot be the investigational device.  
 
The following will be conducte d during the index procedure:  
• Eligibility Criteria (including intra -procedure)  
• Femoral artery angiography to assess femoral artery and puncture site pri or to 
utilizing the investigational device and after procedure for assessment of major  
and/or minor complications  
• Activated Clotting Time (ACT)  
• Time -to-Hemostasis (TTH)  
• Concomitant Medications (Anticoagulation / Antiplatelets Only)  
• Adverse Events (observed from time of enrollment)

the primary study index procedure and subjects should return as soon as reasonably 
possible unless the patient wishes to be withdrawn from the study.  
 
The following data will be collected  during the unscheduled visit:     
• DUS for assessment of groin/access site related complications  in target limb only (if 
not completed already or if repeat is needed (e.g., missed 30 -day and/or 60 -day 
visit))  
• Targeted physical exam, including groin exam (if not completed already or if repeat 
is nee ded (e.g., missed 30 -day and/or 60 -day visit))  
• Concomitant Medications (Anticoagulation / Antiplatelets Only)  
• Adverse Events  
 
If the patient will not or cannot return for an unscheduled visit , the study site should 
contact [CONTACT_44256] .  
 
7.[ADDRESS_46456] demographics, eligibility requirements, procedure summary, 
concomitant mediations as well as any procedure complications and/or adverse events will 
be collected on e CRFs provided by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor. The eCRFs should accurately reflect data 
contained in the subject’s  medical  records (i.e. source documents) . 
 
[ADDRESS_46457] safety will be monitored via the reporting of adverse events occurring from the time 
of enrollment through study completion. Any pre -existing condition known to the investigator 
will not be reportable as an adverse event unless that condition worse ns during the study.   
Clinical Investigational Plan  
Cross -SealTM IDE Trial  
Protocol Number:  TIS2018 -[ADDRESS_46458] has completed/exited the study.  If the investigator learns of any adverse event  at 
any time after a subject’s exit  from the study, and there is a reasonable possibility that it is 
related to investigational device, the  investigator should promptly report it to the Sponsor.  
 
8.1 Definitions  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an unwanted medical occurrence in a subject. This 
definition does not imply that there is a relationship between the AE and the device 
under investigation. This can include, but is not limited to, a change in the subject ’s 
health status from baseline that is related to the disease process, interventional 
procedures, investigational  device, and/or side effects to medications.   
 
An adverse device effect  is defined as those adverse events that are caused by , or 
related to , the investigational device.  
 
An unanticipated adverse device effect  (UADE) is an adverse device effect that is not 
described in the study risk assessm ent or the informed consent.  “A ny serious adverse 
effect on health or safety or any life -threatening prob lem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified 
in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application 
(including a supplementary plan or application), or  any other unanticipated serious 
problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects” 
(21 CFR 812.3(s)).  
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is an adverse event that led to a death or led to a 
serious deterioration in the health of a subject that:  
1. Resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury,  
2. Resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function,  
Clinical Investigational Plan  
Cross -SealTM IDE Trial  
Protocol Number:  TIS2018 -[ADDRESS_46459].   
 
Each AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_44257] -
serious.  (Note:  The term serious is not synonymous with severity, which is used to 
describe the intensity of an event experienced by [CONTACT_423]).   
 
A serious adverse device effect  is an adverse even t that is both serious and device 
related.  
 
8.2 Potential Adverse Events (AEs)  
Potential complications associated with the investigational device  as with all other suture 
mediated closure devices may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 
• Allergic r eaction or hypersensitivity to device components  
• Anemia  
• Arterial stenosis/occlusion  
• Arteriovenous fistula  
• Bleeding/hemorrhage  
• Bruising  
• Death  
• Deep vein thrombosis  
• Device entrapment  
• Device failure/malfunction/misplacement  
• Diminished pulses distal t o closure site  
• Embolism  
• Extended Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] / Delayed time to ambulation

• Wound dehiscence  
 
8.[ADDRESS_46461] be reported on the eCRF. All adverse events will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of symptoms  through study completion  and/or the subject withdraws c onsent. 
Resolution means that the subject has returned to a baseline state of health. Stabilization 
means that the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the 
adverse event.   
 
8.4 Causality Rating  
The causal relationship of an adverse event to the investigational device will be rated as 
follows:  
 
Not Related :   An event for which an alternative explanation is conclusively identified - e.g., 
concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), and/or the relationship i n time suggests that a 
causal relationship is highly unlikely.

Protocol Number:  TIS2018 -[ADDRESS_46462] 2018                                          CONFIDENTIAL  Page 53 of 73 Possible:   An event that is unlikely due to the use of the investigational device. An 
alternative explanation - e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s) - is inconclusive. 
The relatio nship in time is reasonable; therefore,  the causal relationship cannot be excluded.  
 
Probable:    An event that might be due to the use of the investigational device. An 
alternative explanation is less likely - e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease (s). The 
relationship in time is suggestive.  
 
Definitely:   An event that is due to the use of the investigational device. The event cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_4867] - e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant 
disease(s).  
 
8.5 Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of an AE will be rated as follows:  
Mild An adverse event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal 
discomfort and does not interfere with everyday activities.  
Moderate  An adverse event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities; intervention may be needed.  
Severe  An adverse event that prevents normal everyday activities; treatment or 
other intervention usually needed.  
 
 
8.6 Events Requiring Expedited Reporting  
Expedited Events refer to events that the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_44230]/Sponsor  within twenty -four (24) hours of knowledge of the event. The appropriate 
eCRF and related documents should be completed in the data management system.  
 
If a non -serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant follow -up in formation must 
also be reported using the appropriate eCRF.  
 
The Sponsor will immediately conduct an evaluation of any unanticipated adverse device 
effects (UADEs). If the effect is determined by [CONTACT_44258], all investigations or parts of the investigation presenting that risk will be

The CEC is composed of physicians who are interventional and/or non -interventional 
cardiologists, who are not participating in this st udy, and who do not have any investment 
with the study Sponsor. The CEC is charged with the review and classification of adverse 
events (AEs), including deaths. The CEC will establish rules outlining the minimum amount 
of data required and the algorithm fo llowed in order to classify AEs. All members of the CEC 
will meet regularly to review and classify AEs. All appropriate data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_44259]. The CEC will forward a report of event reviews and classifications as outlined in the 
CEC charter.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_46465] (DSMB)  
The DSMB will be appointed to monitor the conduct of the study and subject safety by 
[CONTACT_44260]. The DSMB will oversee the overall safety of 
current and future study subjects by [CONTACT_44261]. The DSMB will 
review adverse events and other relevant study data and will recommend study t ermination 
if safety concerns warrant such action. The DSMB will also establish guideline criteria for 
recommen ding study termination, to the extent possible that the DSM B can predict adverse 
events or outcomes, before the propos ed study begins.  
 
The DSMB will be an independent committee with no direct involvement in the day -to-day 
undertaking of the study and no investment i n the Sponsor. DSMB members and activities 
may overlap with the CEC as appropriate. The DSMB will consist of physicians, including 
one chairperson and a statistician who will provide an independent review of the data. The 
physicians will include an interve ntional cardiologist and vascular surgeon experienced in 
vascular closure to ensure appropriate review of vascular complications in the study. The 
DSMB report will detail all serious and unexpected adverse events or other unanticipated 
problems that involv e potential risk to future study participants. If the DSMB has concerns 
regarding the study, the DSMB will notify the Sponsor, who will provide the relevant 
summaries to local IRBs. Actions taken by [CONTACT_44262] t o the DSMB.

protocol. Subjects will have visit s with the investigator or his/her designee to monitor 
the subjects’ status  pre-procedure, intra -procedure, and post -procedure . 
• A DUS will be performed at [ADDRESS_46468] regular assessments according to the investigator ’s standards of care . The data 
collec ted during the clinical study will provide further  understanding how the Cross -SealTM 
System  is clinically beneficial. Potential benefits may include:  
• Reduced Time -to-Ambulation (TTA)  
• Reduced Time -to-Hemostasis (TTH)  
• Improved quality of life  
 
10 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Reimbursement  
The Sponsor will seek applicable Medicare coverage in compliance with CMS requirements 
for this study. Based on the target study population including mean age, approximately 
70% of subjects enr olled in this study will utilize CMS/Medicare reimbursement during their 
participation.   
 
The study will be conducted in compliance with all applicable Federal regulations concerning 
the protection of human subjects found at 21 CFR parts 50, 56, and 812, and 45 CFR part 
46. In addition, the study will be registered with the National Institutes of Health National 
Library of Medicine’s ClinicalTrials.gov.  
 
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to the regulatory authorities to fully report all results 
of sp onsored clinical studies. No investigat ional  procedures other than those in this protocol 
shall be undertaken. The sponsor intends to submit a formal report to FDA following 
completion of the last subject visit required for primary endpoint analysis. Shoul d the study 
be terminated early, the Sponsor will make every effort to expedite reporting of study 
Clinical Investigational Plan  
Cross -SealTM IDE Trial  
Protocol Number:  TIS2018 -[ADDRESS_46469] operating procedures (SOPs) and the approved Monitoring Plan. Any CRO 
monitors have the same rights and responsibilities as monitors from the Sponsor 
organization.  
 
At the site, monitors will perform and ver ify the following:  
• The adequacy and experience of the study center  including Sponsor notification of 
any problems relating to facilities, technical equipment or medical staff  
• Written Informed Consent has been obtained from all subjects prior to any study 
related procedures being performed and that data is recorded correctly and 
completely  
• Source Document Verification (SDV):  c omparing data in the  eCRFs  to ensure they  
correspond with applicable  source data, and to inform the Sponsor and investigator 
of any discrepancies, errors or omissions  
• Ensure a dherence to the protocol and applicable regulations  at the investigational 
site and notify the Sponsor promptly of any deviations  
• Evaluate s ubject compliance and support subject retention efforts at the sit e 
• Device  accountability and appropriate storage conditions are maintained according 
to the IFU   
 
Data will be collected using eCRFs for this study. Investigative sites will enter data directly 
into the eCRFs via a web -based system. A Sponsor representativ e will provide training and 
technical assistance to the investigator and site staff on the procedural application, intended 
use, and performance characteristics of the investigational device.  In addition, a Sponsor 
representative will schedule periodic, on -site visits to observe clinical procedures, under

Protocol Number:  TIS2018 -[ADDRESS_46470] 2018                                          CONFIDENTIAL  Page 59 of 73 supervision of the investigator, and to answer questions or concerns regarding the 
investigational device.  
 
Given that on -site monitoring at some trial locations may be impacted due to the COVID -19 
pandemic, the Sponsor has implemented both central and remote monitoring to maintain 
oversight of  the clinical study and sites. This includes, but is not limited to, telephone and/or 
email contacts with the sites (to review study procedures, trial  participant status, and study 
progress), remote review of de -identified source, remote access to electronic medical 
records (EMR), and frequent eCRF reviews.  Given the ongoing and unpredictable nature of 
the COVID -19 pandemic, individual site variability  on permitting remote EMR and/or the 
transmission of de -identified source, as well as continually changing local and state 
mandates governing travel, the Sponsor may have to adapt its monitoring processes 
regularly to fulfill its obligations as a Sponsor u nder federal law and regulations.  The 
Sponsor will continuously assess each site and will monitor study data at the earliest 
possible opportunity, either in person or remotely.

Device malfunctions occurri ng in roll -in subjects will be additionally evaluated  for potential 
relationship with the learning curve of the investigational device (e.g., operator applies 
excess tension to suture during pre -closure causing break)  
 
In the case where a device has  malfunctioned/failed, the i nvestigator must make every 
possible effort to return the device to the Sponsor , unless there is a known contamination 
with an infectious disease (i.e. Hepatitis B, C or HIV).  
 
14 Statistical Methods  
14.1 Sample Size  Determination  
The sample size calculations were performed using PASS 2020 Version 20.0.2iii.  The 
appendix included the output from the software.  The sample size for the study is based 
on power considerations for the primary effectiveness endpoint. As will be described

14.2 Statistical  Analyses  
 
14.2.1  General  Considerations  
Except where otherwise specified, the following g eneral principles apply to the planned 
statistical analyses. All statistical analyses will be conducted using {SAS version 9.3 or 
later (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)} or other widely accepted statistical or graphical 
software as required.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Descriptive Statistics  
Continuous data will be summarized with mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
maximum, and number of evaluable observations. Categorical variables will be 
summarized with frequency counts and percentages. Confidence intervals may be 
presented, where appropriate, using the t -distribution for continuous data and exact 
binomial method for categorical variables.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study  Visit  
Study visit Day 0 is the date of the index procedure. Day in the study will be calculated 
relative to the index procedure as follows:  
Study Day = Assessment Date – Index Procedure Date  
Each subject duration in the study will be based on the last study contact [CONTACT_568], which is 
the latest date of all follow -up visits, assessments, adverse event onset or res olution, 
and study exit, including date of death.  
Duration will be calculated as follows: Duration Days = Start Date – End Date  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Visit Windows  
Unless otherwise specified, visit assessments will be analyzed for each analysis time 
point according to the visit  entered in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Statistical  Significance  
Unless otherwise specified, hypothesis testing will be performed at the two -sided 0.05 
significance level. P -values will be rounded to three decimal places. If a p -value is less

reported as ">0.999".  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Precision  
Unless otherwise specified, the following conventions will apply for data display. In 
general, percentages will be displayed to  [ADDRESS_46482]. Percentages <0.05% will be 
reported to [ADDRESS_46483] 
deviation will be reported to 2 additi onal decimal places than the measured value. 
Minimum and maximum values will be reported to the same precision as the measured 
value.  
14.2.2  Analysis  Populations  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Full Analysis Set  
The full analysis set (FAS) as defined by [CONTACT_11580] E9v as "The set of subjects that  is as 
close as possible to the ideal implied by [CONTACT_44266] -to-treat principle." The guideline 
also defined the Intention -To-Treat Principle as the effect of a treatment policy can be 
best assessed by [CONTACT_44267] a subject  (i.e., the planned 
treatment regimen) rather than the actual treatment given.  Therefore, the FAS includes 
all patients that were consented, enrolled, and met the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Per-Protocol Analysis Set  
The protocol definition of the TTH e ndpoint includes only those patients that received the 
test device and did not have adjunctive therapy other than light compression applied to 
the access site manually, with a dressing, or as per the investigator's standard procedure 
for suture -mediated cl osure devices.  Therefore, the per -protocol analysis set (PPS) 
includes those patients in the FAS where the patient received the test device and did not 
have adjunctive therapy other than light compression.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Full Roll -In Analysis Set  
The full roll -in analy sis set (FAS_RI) are those patients that meet the same criteria as the 
FAS but are identified as roll -in patients.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Per-Protocol Roll -In Analysis Set  
The per -protocol roll -in analysis(PPS_RI) set are those patients that meet the same 
criteria as the PPS but  are identified as roll -in patients.

Protocol Number:  TIS2018 -[ADDRESS_46484] 2018                                          CONFIDENTIAL  Page 65 of 73 [IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy Analysis Set  
Due to the challenges during the pandemic, the number of patients in a non -missing 
primary efficacy endpoint may drop below the lowest accepted power (80%) for approval 
trial design (< 86 patients).  If the number of patients in the PPS is <= 86, the efficacy 
analysis set will include the patients in the PPS and the last 18 sequentially enrolled 
patients from the PPS_RI.  If the number of patients in the PPS is > 86, then the efficacy 
analy sis set will only include PPS patients.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Analysis Set  
Due to the challenges during the pandemic, the number of patients in a non -missing 
primary safety endpoint may drop below the lowest accepted power (80%) for approval 
trial design (< 78 patients).  If the number of patients in the FAS is <= 78, the safety 
analysis set will include the patients in the FAS and the last 18 sequentially enrolled 
patients from the FAS_RI.  If the number of patients in the FAS is > 78, then the safety 
analysis set will on ly include FAS patients.  
14.2.3  Poolability  Analyses  
All investigational sites will follow the requirements of a common protocol and 
standardized  data collection procedures and forms. The primary endpoints will be 
presented separately (major  and minor complications will be presented separately for the 
primary safety endpoint) for each site using descriptive statistics. Poolability of the 
primary endpoints across the investigational site will be evaluated using a regression 
model with fixed eff ects for the site using the FAS for the primary safety endpoint and 
PPS for primary efficacy endpoint. Sites enrolling less than five subjects will be 
combined with the geographically nearest site. If the p -value for the site effect is <0.15, 
additional ex ploratory analyses will be performed to understand any variations in 
outcomes by [CONTACT_3725].

Cross -SealTM IDE Trial  
Protocol Number:  TIS2018 -[ADDRESS_46490]  Disposition  
Subjects who are screened and signed an informed consent form, but do not meet all 
protocol eligibility criteria (i.e., screening failure), will be excluded from the statistical 
analyses. These subjects will be summarized in a subject accountability table  only.  
Subject accountability will be summarized by [CONTACT_44269].  The number of 
subjects who are enrolled, eligible for follow -up, and number completing clinical follow -up 
will be summarized for each protocol -required  visit. 
14.2.9  Demographics and Baseline  Characteristics  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for clinically relevant baseline demographic, 
medical history, and clinical characteristic variables.  
14.2.10  Analysis of Study  Endpoints  
Study success is defined as the successful rejection of the corresponding null 
hypotheses for each of the primary safety and effectiveness endpoints.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Efficacy  Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be evaluated using the using the efficacy analysis set.  
The mean and standar d error will be reported for the primary efficacy endpoint.  A one -
sample t -distribution will be used for calculating the upper 97.5% confidence limit.   
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Sensitivity Analyses  
There will be three sensitivity analyses:  
1. The primary efficacy endpoint analysis will be repeated with the PPS patients only if 
PPS_RI patients are added to the efficacy analysis set  
2. Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_44234] 14.2.6  
3. The primary efficacy endpoint analysis will be repeated with the PPS_RI and the 
efficacy analysis set combined.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Safety Analysis  
The primary safety endpoint will be evaluated using the FAS or the safety analysis set if 
roll-ins are needed.  The endpoint will be presented as the proportion of subjects with

Clopper -Pearson exact methodvi.  If the one -sided 95% confidenc e limit is greater than 
85.2%, then the device will have met the performance goal for safety.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Sensitivity Analyses  
There will be three sensitivity analyses:  
1. The primary safety endpoint analysis will be repeated with the FAS patients only if 
FAS_RI patients  are added to the safety analysis set  
2. Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_44235], as described in 
section 14.2.6 . 
3. The primary efficacy endpoint analysis will be repeated with the FAS_RI and the 
safety analysis set combined.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Endpoints  
No formal hypothesis tests for the secondary and exploratory endpoints will be 
performed; endpoints will be summarized using the FAS with descriptive statistics.  
14.2.11  Subgroup  Analyses  
Subgroup analysis of the primary safety (major and minor complications analyzed 
separately) and efficacy endpoints will be performed for the following subgroups: gender, 
age (Age<65, Age≥65), and race (whi te vs. non -white). These analyses are intended to 
assess the consistency of results across subgroups.  
Subgroup analyses will be performed using the efficacy analysis set for the primary 
efficacy endpoint and the safety analysis set for the primary safety e ndpoint. For each 
subgroup, a regression model will be fit that includes fixed effects for subgroup 
membership.  
14.2.12  Interim  Analyses  
There are no formal plans for interim analyses for the purposes of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_44236] . Interim safety reports will be performed as 
requested by [CONTACT_44270]. Unless otherwise specified, methods for such reports 
may follow those outlined in this document.

Any additional changes to planned statistical analyses determined necessary before 
performing the analyses will be documented in an amended Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version 1.4 and approved before the analysis when possible. Any other deviations or 
changes from the planned analyses deemed  necessary due to violation of critical 
underlying statistical assumptions, data characteristics, or missing data will be clearly

Title of Study:
An open -label, multi -center study  to evaluate the safet y and pharmacokinetics of IGSC 20% 
administered for 6 months in subjects with primary immunodeficiency
Study Number :
GTI1502
Phase:
3
Number of Subjects Planned:
Approximately  50 subjects
Study Centers Planned:
Approximately  30 study  centers
Study Objectives:
Primary Pharmacokinetic (PK) Objective
To determine a dose of weekl y subcutaneousl y administered Immune Globulin Subcutaneous 
(Human), 20% Capry late/Chromatograph y Purified (Grifols) (IGSC 20%) that produces 
steady -state AUC of total IgG that is non- inferior to that of the regularly  administered IV 
dose of Immune Globulin I njection (Human), 10% Capry late/Chromatography  Purified 
(Grifols) (IGIV -C 10%) in primary  immunodeficiency  (PI)subjects
Secondary  Objective
To determine if IGSC 20% replacement therap y maintains mean stead y-state trough total IgG 
levels that are comparable to the mean trough total IgG levels with the IGIV -C 10% 
replacement therap y in PI [INVESTIGATOR_535796] y and tolerability of IGSC 20% as an IgG replacement therap y in subjects 
with PI
[INVESTIGATOR_535797]:
This is a prospective, multi -center, open -label, single -sequence, 6 -month, PK and safety  and 
tolerability  study  of IGSC 20% in subjects wit h PI. Approximately  [ADDRESS_697353] approximately  30 adult subjects and 12 to 18 pediatric subjects (age 
2-16years) completing treatment with subcutaneously  administered IGSC 20%.  Pediatric 
enrollment will be stratified by  [CONTACT_535841] a target of 4 to 6 children for each group: 
2to 5 years, >5 to 12 years, and >12 to 16 years of age . The PK profiles of total IgG 
following administration of both IV (IGIV- C 10%) administration and SC (IGSC 20%) 
administration under approximate steady -state conditions wi ll be determined and compared.
This study  will include 3 treatment phases: Run -In Phase , IV Phase ( IV administration of 
Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment 2 15 Mar 2016
CONFIDENTIAL Page 14of 94IGIV -C 10% treatment), and SC Phase (SC administration of IGSC 20%). Before a subject is 
to be enr olled (entering either the Run -Inor IV P hase) into the study , the subject will be 
screened during the Screening Phase of upto 28 day s (following the first assessment of 
subject eligibility ).
Subjects, depending on their current IgG treatment regimen, may be required to enter the 
Run-In Phase to receive IV IGIV -C 10% treatment (Sponsor provided)  to achieve an 
approximately  stead y-state condition prior to entering the IV Phase . They  will then enter the 
IV Phase to determine the AUC profiles of IV infusions of IGIV-C 10%.
Subjects with a qualify ing IV IGIV -C 10% treatment regimen (on stable IGIV -C 10% doses
of 300 -800 mg/kg) can enter the IV Phase directl y where they will receive IGIV -C 10% 
(Sponsor provided). In the IV Phase , steady -state IV PK assessments i ncluding AUC will be 
performed.
After completing the IV Phase , subjects will enter the SC Phase to receive weekl y SC doses 
of IGSC 20% for at least 24 weeks. The IGSC 20% dose will be determined by [CONTACT_535842] I V to SC dose adjustment factor of 1.37. After reaching an approximately  stead y-state 
condition, the SC PK profiles including AUC at SC Week #13 will be determined.
Comparison of the IV PK profiles and IGSC 20% PK profiles in the first 6 adult/adolescent 
subjects will be performed through an interim PK anal ysis. If the dose adjustment factor is 
deemed acceptable (SC dose of IGSC 20% is non -inferior to the subject’s IV dose) 
(Section 3.1.5 ), all subjects will continue to complete treatment and assessments through 
Week#25 (no further monthly  extension visits). Otherwise, a new dose adjustment factor will 
be employ ed for all subjects following the procedures described in Section 3.1.5 , and 
subjects will receive 24 weeks of IGSC 20% tre atment at the new IGSC 20% dose . In this 
study , the PK profiles will be assessed in all subjects. Subjects aged 2 to 5 y ears old will be 
assessed using an abbreviated sampling schedule for PK profiles.
The interim serial PK samples (for both the IGIV -C 10% IV and the IGSC 20% SC dosing 
phases) may  be obtained at an alternate location.  If an outside agency  is utilized for sample 
collection, the samples will be drawn and processed per protocol and laboratory  manual 
instructions.

Statistical Methods:
Study  Populations:
Safety  Population
The safet y population will include all subjects who received an y amount of study drugs 
(IGIV -C 10% and/or IGSC 20%) and will be used for safety  anal ysis.
PK Population
The PK population will consist of all subjects who receive study  drugs and have sufficient 
and valid total IgG concentration vs. time data for either the IV or SC Phase to all ow 
calculation of AUC 0-τ,SCor AUC 0-τ,IV(the primary PK endpoint).
The validity  of total IgG concentrations  will be reviewed and determined before the database 
lock based on consideration of treatment compliance and blood sampling/testing issues (such 
ascollection problem). Any  invalid total IgG concentrations will be flagged with the reason 
for invalidity  in the listing.
IgG Population
The IgG population will consist of all subjects who receive study drugs and have an y total 
IgG concentration data. The summary  of total IgG concentration data will be based on IgG 
Population.
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics:
The demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized. For quantitative variables, 
mean, SD, median, and minimum/maximum will be provided. For qualitative variables, the 
frequency  and percentage will be provided.
Study  Anal yses:
Primary  PK Analy ses
The Primary  PK endpoint is the steady -state AUC over a dosing interval defined as follows:
AUC 0-τ,SC, the AUC over a weekl y dosing in terval (τ) at an approximate stead y-state 
condition following weekly  SC infusion, ie, AUC 0-7 days.
AUC 0-τ,IV, the AUC over a regular dosing interval (τ) at an approximate steady -state 
condition following the regular IV infusion, either every  3 weeks or every  4 weeks, ie, 
AUC 0-21 days or AUC 0-28 days , respectively .
AUC 0-τ,SCis to be obtained after the 13th SC dose of IGSC 20% at the weekly  dose 
calculated using the final dose adjustment factor, and AUC 0-τ,IVis to be obtained following 
IV infusion of IGIV -C 10% at the IV#1 visit.  Since the dosing interval (τ) is 7 day s for the 
SC dose, AUC 0-τ,SCis determined as AUC 0-7 days.  For IV dosing, the dosing interval (τ) is 
21or 28 day s for the 3 -week or 4- week subjects, AUC 0-τ,IVis determined as AUC 0-21days or 
Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment 2 15 Mar 2016
CONFIDENTIAL Page 21of 94AUC 0-28 days , respectively.
Prior to statistical comparison of AUC 0-τ’sbetween the IV IGIV -C 10% and SC I GSC 20% 
doses, the AUC 0-21days from the IV infusion in subjects on a 3- week IV dosing interval will 
be divided by  3 or the AUC 0-28days from IV dosing in subjects on a 4- week IV dosing 
interval divided by  4 for comparison with AUC 0-7days from the weekl y SC infusion.
The hy pothesis to be tested is that the weekl y SC dose of IGSC 20% will achieve an 
approximate steady -state AUC 0-τ,SCof total IgG that is non -inferior to that achieved b y a 
regular IV dose of IGIV -C 10% (AUC 0-τ,IVdivided by  3 or 4 depending on the IV dosing 
intervals).  Non -inferiority  of steady -state IgG AUC between SC dose of IGSC 20% and IV 
IGIV -C 10% administrat ion will be tested based on established regulatory guidelines for 
bioequivalence testing. The 90% confidence interval (CI) of the geometric LSM ratio of SC 
AUC to I V AUC will be calculated.  The SC dose is considered to be non- inferior to the IV 
dose if the low bound of the 90% CIfor the geometric L SM AUC ratio is above 0.80 based 
on loge -transformed data.
Secondary  and Exploratory  PK Anal ysis
Secondary and exploratory  PK endpoints include the steady -state mean trough concentration 
of total IgG and the C max, tmaxof total IgG. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for the 
steady -state mean trough concentration of total IgG and for Cmaxandtmaxof total IgG.  All 
pre-infusion total IgG concentrations obtained before and at the 13th SC dose of IGSC 20% 
will be evaluated to determine if an approximate steady- state condition has been achieved b y 
the 13th SC dose.  The stead y-state mean trough concentrations of total IgG following SC 
administrated IGSC 20% will be determined as the average value of C trough measurements 
obtained at Weeks#13, #14, #17, and #21. The mean stead y-state trough concentrations of 
total IgG following IV administrated I GIV-C 10% will be determined as the average value of 
Ctrough measurements obtained at the IV#1 visit and at 21 or 28 d ays after the IV#1 IGIV -C 
10% dose (depending on dosing interval), ie, immediatel y prior to the administration of IV 
dose at IV#2 visit.
Summaries will be provided for trough concentration of total IgG and each of its subclasses 
between IV infusion of IGIV -C 10% and SC administration of I GSC 20%.  Summaries of 
trough level concentration of antibody  titers against S. pneumonia, H.influenza, and C. tetani
will also be provided.
Depending on the number of subjects being dosed on IGIV -C 10% at 3 -or 4-week dosing 
interval, subgroup anal yses may  be performed to evaluate PK variables by  [CONTACT_535845]. Subgroup anal yses willadditionally  include age, sex, race, ethnicity  and other 
factors as appropriate .
Additional exploratory  variables will be summarized descriptively. The number and 
proportion of subjects having SBI, infections, days on antibiotics, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_535805], and days of work/school/daily  activities missed due to infections will be calculated 
and summarized. Furthermore, the total number of events or day s and corresponding 
annualized rate per subject of SBIs, infections, day s on antibiotics, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_535806] t o 
infection, and day s of work/school/daily  activities missed due to infections will be calculated 
Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment [ADDRESS_697360] 6
adult/adolescent subjects (age ≥12-75 years) have completed the PK sampling schedule for 
both the IV and SC (after the 13th SC dose) phases of the trial.  PK data from these 
6adult/adolescent subjects will be analyzed using procedures as described above under 
primary  efficacy  anal ysis.  A decision on whether to modify  the dose adjustment factor for 
calculating the SC dose will be made base d on this interim PK analy sis.
Final PK and statistical analy sis will be based on the PK data obtained after the final (or 
adjusted, if an y) SC dose administered in all completed subjects.
Safety  Anal ysis
The safet y analyses are based on the safet y population.
All AEs ,suspected ADRs , AR, and SAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs and SAEs will be 
summarized by  [CONTACT_535846]. The summaries will be presented b y MedDRA sy stem organ class and preferred 
term. AE summaries b y severit y will also be provided. Local infusion site reactions and non-
serious infections will be similarly  summarized.
Subjects with deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to premature discontinuation from the study  
will be listed and presented in a narrative form.
Adverse events temporally  associated with IV or SC administration of study  drug will be 
defined as those occurring during or within 72 hours of completion of an infusion. 
Additionally , local infusion site reactions will be tabulated and summarized for the total 
duration of the study  and by  [CONTACT_535847] 20% infusion week.
For all laboratory  tests and vital signs, the original value and the change from Baseline will 
be summarized for numeric results and frequency/percentage will be summarized for 
qualitative results. For laboratory  tests with normal ranges, out of normal range values will 
be flagged and shift tables will be provided.
Determinati on of Sample Size
The planned number of subjects (50 enrolled to provide 30 completing adult subjects and 
12to 18 completing pediatric subjects). This sample size is primarily  based on safet y 
assessment consideration. Also a sample size of [ADDRESS_697361] 24 scheduled 
administrations of I GSC 20% would provide the clinical experience data on a total of more 
than 1008 to 1080 IGSC 20% dosing administrations for safety  assessment.
The planned minimum enrollment of 42 completing subjects should be more than adequate to 
establish that the AUC for total IgG for IGSC 20% is non -inferior to that achieved b y 
IGIV -C 10%.

1.1 Primary  Immunodeficiency
Primary  Immunodeficiency  (PI) diseases are a family  of congenital disorders of the immune 
system that lead to an increase in frequency  of infections, notably , but not limited to, 
bacterial infections of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_53121] ( 1). Results from a recent study  suggest that in the 
[LOCATION_002] (US) alone 1 in 2,000 children and 1 in 1,200 persons (including adults and 
children) are diagnosed with PI , yielding a total US PI  [INVESTIGATOR_535809]  250,000 adults and children ( 2). Worldwide upper estimates suggest that six 
million people (638,000 in Europe) may  be living with a PI , although orders of magnitude 
fewer patients have been identified in registries ( 3). Patients with inherited deficiencies 
leading to impaired humoral immunity  are highl y susceptible to a wide range of infections, 
most commonly  bacterial infections. The efficacy  of immunoglobulin G (IgG) replacement in 
the treatment o f these disorders has been well established ( 4,5) since 1952 when the use of 
serum globulin fraction was reported to reduce the frequency  of infections in a patient with 
agammaglobulinemia. The therapeutic management of PI  [INVESTIGATOR_535810] (IM), intravenous (IV), and subcutaneous (SC) injections of various IgG 
preparations ( 6,7).
1.2 Immunoglobulin Replacement Therapy
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_160942], the infusion of IV immune globulin (IVIG) is problematic in 
some patients, especiall y those who have poor venous access or develop s ystemic adverse 
events (AEs), such as headaches, fever, chills, or my algias from this route of administration 
(8,9). In children, difficulty  in obtaining venous access can prevent or delay IVIG therap y 
(7,10,11).Over the last several years sub cutaneously  delivered immune globulin (SCI G) has 
been developed for administration in the home setting for treatment of PI [INVESTIGATOR_535811] ( 10,11,12).
Theresults of several adult PI [INVESTIGATOR_535812] G products have shown good efficacy  of 
replacement therap y and control of bacterial infections ( 13,14,15). Additionally , the results 
of several pediatric studies also showed that SC in fusion of IgG in children (ages 1 -15 years) 
at home was feasible and safe and also resulted in maintenance of the IgG levels above 
500mg/dL ( 12,16,17), a level that is considered as suf ficient to protect against serious 
bacterial infections (SBI s) in adults and pediatric PI  [CONTACT_1962]. It is now generall y accepted 
that repeated SC infusions of IgG cause few, if any, adverse s ystemic reactions and for some 
patients, including children, the SC route has become a preferred route of administration 
(8,18-29).
Advantages of home -based SCI G infusions in adults and children with PI  [INVESTIGATOR_535813] y-of-life improvement, specifically , greater independence, better 
control of the therapy  situation, and an overall improvement in daily  life afforded by  [CONTACT_233553] -
based therap y. Moreover, the technique involved is deemed eas y to learn by [CONTACT_535848] ( 6,7,24,30).
Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment [ADDRESS_697368] order kinetics over a period of approximately  3to 4 weeks ( 18,31). 
Consequently  the patient experiences substantial IgG concentration variations rather than a 
steady  IgG level throughout the IV dosing period. Maintenance of higher IgG trough levels 
may benefit patients receiving IgG via the SC route at more frequent intervals ( 18).
Recent studies with SCIG regimens have documented the SCI G regimen results in much less 
variability  in IgG levels, and higher and more consistent trough levels when compared to the 
IVIG regimens ( 32). One possible reason for the stable blood concentrations is that the SC 
infused IgG probably  remains in the SC fat lay er as a depot with a slow and continuous 
release into the circulatory s ystem ( 6) in addition to the increased frequency  of dosing. It has 
been reported that the uptake of the antibodies fro m SC tissue is high and the antibodies are 
not locally  destro yed (18,33), which results in IgG reaching the circulation intact.
Several SCIG products, ranging in protein IgG concentrations from 10% to 20%, are 
currentl y being used to treat PI  [INVESTIGATOR_535814] y by [CONTACT_535849]. 
IGIV -C 10%, a 10% immunoglobulin product, is licensed in the US and some other countries 
(eg, IGIVnex in Canada) for both IV and SC administration. The advantage of higher 
concentration SCI G products (20%) is primaril y reduced infusion volume and sh orter 
infusion time thereby  [CONTACT_535850].
1.[ADDRESS_697369] (I P) in this study  is Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 
20% Capry late/Chromatography  Purified (IGSC 20%), Grifols company  designation 
GRF6017. Henceforth in this document , this product will be referred to as IGSC 20%. The 
second study  drug is Immune Globulin I njection (Human), 10% Capry late/Chromatograph y 
Purified, henceforth referred to as IGIV -C 10% which is approved for the indication of PI
[INVESTIGATOR_535815]- In Phase and IV Phase ( Section 3.1 ).
The primary  objective of this study  is to determine a dose of subcutaneously  administered 
IGSC 20% that produces steady -state area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) of total 
IgG b y weekly SC administration that is not inferior to that of a regularl y administered IV 
dose of Immune Globulin Injection (Human), 10% Capry late/Chromatography  Purified 
(Grifols IGIV -C 10%).  IGIV -C 10% is a 10% Grifols immunoglobulin product, licensed in 
the US as GAMUNEX®and some other countries (eg, IGIVnex in Canada ) for both IV and 
SC administration.  The add itional objective of the trial is to assess the safety  of the new 
IGSC 20% formulation.
In addition to the information provided here, please also refer to the Investigator’s Brochure 
(IB) of IGSC 20% and IGIV -C 10% .
Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment [ADDRESS_697370] historically  been in the range of 1.37 to 
1.53 across products (eg, Gamunex -C,  Hizentra, Gammagard), and this study  will 
commence with an IVIG :IGSC 20% dose adjustment ratio of 1.37, which is the same ratio 
used for the SC IGIV -C 10%.
For IGSC 20% preclinical data support an IVIG:IGSC 20% dose adjustment factor of 1.37. 
In a single dose study  in New Zealand White rabbits, the AUC plasma fractional availability  
was calculated for IGSC 20% v s.IGIV -C 10%. A single 100 mg/kg IV bolus injection was 
compared with IGSC 20% at doses of 1.0, 1.15, 1.3, and 1.5 times the IV dose level. IGSC 
20% produced an AUC that was 74%, 80%, 89%, and 95%, respectivel y, of the AUC 
produced b y 100 mg/kg IV IGIV -C 10%. Thus, it is expected, that an IGSC 20% dose in the 
range of 1.3 to 1.5 times the IGIV -C 10% dose level will produce comparable AUC ( see 
IGSC 20% IB) .
The new product, IGSC 20%, is manufactured in a similar manner to IGIV -C 10% with an 
additional nanofiltration step and a higher final IgG concentrat ion (20%). As such, it is 
anticipated that the clinical dosing strategy , safety, and efficacy attributes of IGSC 20% will 
be similar to I GIV-C 10% in patients with PI . IGIV -C 10% is currentl y approved for SC 
administration in PI  [INVESTIGATOR_535816]. The dose adjustment ratio employ ed in 
this protocol (1.37) for the transition from IV to SC route has been successfully  evaluated 
with I GIV-C 10% in 2 Grifols clinical studies ([ZIP_CODE] and T5004 -401). Accordingl y in this 
study , a 1:1.37 IV to SC dose adj ustment factor will be initially  employ ed for the transition 
from IVIG to IGSC 20% treatment and will be evaluated in the interim PK anal ysis.
Grifols Study  060001 showed that weekly  SC administration of I GIV-C 10% in 
32 adult/adolescents PI [INVESTIGATOR_535817] a relatively  constant steady -state trough 
concentration of total IgG (1140 mg/dL). The steady -state trough levels of IgG following SC 
infusions were found to be 19% higher than those from IV infusions. There were no SBIs 
reported in the 24 -week SC treatment phase ( 34). This study  demonstrated that the 1:1.[ADDRESS_697371] squares mean 
(LSM) ratio of AUC SC vs. AUC IVof 0.888, with a 90% confidence interval (CI) of 0.861 to 
0.917 (anal ysis of variance [ANOVA]). The lower bound of the 90% CI was above 0.80 
indicating that the SC dose was non -inferior to the IV dose in terms of AUC. I n additi on, the 
90% CI  was within the limit of 0.80 to 1.25, a criterion for concluding “bioequivalence” 
between the 2 treatments ( SC and IV doses of IGIV -C 10%).
Additionally , a recentl y completed pediatric stud y (Grifols Study  T5004- 401) of weekly  SC 
administrat ion of IGIV -C 10% in 11 pediatric subjects (age range 4 -15 years) also resulted in 
no SBI reported in the 12 -week SC treatment period. The mean steady -state minimum
concentration (Ctrough) of total IgG was1325 mg/dL following weekl y SC infusion of IGIV -C 
10% which was 31% higher than that of the IV dosing C trough (997 mg/dL )(1.37 dose 
adjustment factor relative to I V). The mean of the ratios of SC AUC vs. IV AUC was also 
favorable (mean ±SD: 1.05 ±0.104).

3INVESTIGA TIONAL PLA N
3.1 Stud y Design and Plan
This is a prospective, multi -center, open -label, single -sequence, 6 -month, PK and safety  and 
tolerability  study  of IGSC 20% in subjects with PI. Approximately  [ADDRESS_697372] approximately  30 adult subjects and 12 to 18 pediatric subjects (age 
2-16years) completing treatment  with subcutaneously  administered IGSC 20%.  Pediatric 
enrollment will be st ratified by  [CONTACT_535841] a target of 4 to 6 children for each group: 2
to 5 years, >5 to 12 years, and >12 to 16 years of age . The PK profiles of total IgG following 
administration of both I V (IGIV -C 10%) administration and SC (IGSC 20%) administration 
under approximate steady- state conditions will be determined and compared.  The primary  
objective is to determine a weekl y SC dose of IGSC 20% that achieves an AUC of total IgG 
that is non -inferior to that achieved b y a subject’s IV dose of immune globulin .
This study  will include 3 treatment phases: Run -In Phase, IV Phase (IV administration of 
IGIV -C 10% treatment), and SC Phase (SC administration of IGSC 20%). Before a subject is 
to be enrolled (entering either the Run- In or IV Phase) into the study , the subject will be 
screened during the Screening Phase , which is up to 28days. The specific inclusion and 
exclusion criteria for this study  are described in Section 3.2 .
Subjects, depending on their current IgG treatment regimen, may  be required to enter the 
Run-In Phase to receive IV IGIV -C 10% treatment (Sponsor provided)  to achieve an 
approximately  stead y-state condition prior to entering the IV Phase. They  will then enter the 
IV Phase to determine the AUC profile of IV infusions of I GIV-C 10%.
Subjects with a qualify ing IV IGIV -C 10% treatment regimen (on stable IGIV -C 10% doses
of 300-800 mg/kg) can enter the IV Phase directl y where they will receive IGIV -C 10%
(Sponsor provided). In the IV Phase , steady -state IV PK assessments i ncluding AUC will be 
performed.
After completing the IV Phase , subjects will enter the SC Phase to receive weekl y SC doses 
of IGSC 20% for at least 24 weeks. The IGSC 20% dose will be de termined by  [CONTACT_535842] I V to SC dose adjustment factor of 1.37. After r eaching an approximate steady -state 
condition, the SC PK profiles including AUC at SC Week#13 will be determined.
The interim serial PK samples (for both the IGIV -C 10% IVand the IGSC 20% SC dosing 
phases) may  be obtained at an alternate location.  If an outside agency  is utilized for sample 
collection, the sample swill be drawn and processed per protocol and laboratory  manual 
instructions.
Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment 2 15 Mar 2016
CONFIDENTIAL Page 35of 94Comparison of the IV PK profiles and IGS C 20% PK profiles in the first 6 adult/adolescent 
subjects will be performed through an interim PK anal ysis. If the dose adjustment factor is 
deemed acceptable (SC dose of IGSC 20% is non -inferior to the subject’s IV dose) 
(Section 3.1.5 ), all subjects will continue to complete treatment and assessments through 
Week#25 (no further monthly  extension visits) . Otherwise, a new dose adjustment factor will 
be employ ed for all subjects following the procedures d escribed in Section 3.1.5 ,and 
subjects will receive 24 weeks of IGSC 20% treatment at th enew IGSC 20% dose .In this 
study , the PK profiles will be assessed in all subjects. Subjects aged [ADDRESS_697373] entry  criteria 
are described in Table 3-1.

10% intravenousl y at a dose of 300 to 800 mg/kg every  3 to 4 weeks (dose and interval to be 
determined based on the investigator’s clinical judgment) for a period of up to 4months prior 
to the I V#[ADDRESS_697378] 4 Run -In visits . 
3.1.3 IV Phase
In the IV Phase, subjects will receive 2 IV infusions of IGIV -C 10%. At the IV#[ADDRESS_697379] at screening entered directl y into the IV P hase of the study  will receive a 
dose of IV IGIV -C 10% equivalent to their current IgG dose.  Subjects who have been 
required to go through a Run- In Phase will receive the same dose of IV IGIV -C 10% as have 
been admi nistered during that pre- requisite Run -In period.  Blood draws for PK profiling will 
begin just prior to the first I GIV-C 10% infusion (IV#1) and will continue throughout the 
subject’s normal dosing period (3 or 4 weeks total).  At the end of this period a nd in order to 
ensure that the subject shave adequate total IgG levels prior to initiating study  drug b y SC, a 
second dose of IV IG IV-C 10% will be administered (IV#2). The SC P hase will begi n 1 
week after the IV#2 visit.
3.1.4 SC Phase
One week (7 day s) after t he second IV dose (IV#2), subjects will return to the clinic to begin 
the weekl y SC administrations of IGSC 20%.  The SC Phase will continue for a total of 
24weeks (6 months).  The initial weekly SC dose is calculated as described in Section 3.3.2 .
Briefl y, the SC dose is calculated using the following formula:
After 12 weeks (3 months) of weekly  SC therapy , determination of PK profiles for total IgG 
during the SC P hase will begin at the blood draw just prior to the 13thSC infusion with the 
last sam ple collected immediately prior to the 14thSC infusion (7 day s total).

Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment 2 15 Mar 2016
CONFIDENTIAL Page 39of 943.1.5 Interim PK Analysis
The dosing regimen for SC administration of I GSC 20% is based on literature data of the 
bioavailability  of subcutaneous administered IgG and p rior experience with SC I GIV-C 10% . 
The weekl y IGSC 20% dosing regimen to be evaluated herein (1.37 times the currently  stable 
IV IgG dose divided b y 4 for subjects on an every -4-week dosing schedule or divided by  
3for subjects on an every -3-week dosing schedule) is predicted to provide an steady -state 
AUC of total IgG levels not inferior to that of the prior IV dose based on the established 
bioequivalence acceptance data.
While it is believed that a dose adjustment factor of 1.37 for determining an SC dose of 
IGSC 20% (from an IV dose) is suitable, an interim PK analy sis is planned to confirm that 
this SC dose adjustment factor calculation is adequate and to allow for potential modification 
of the dose adjustment factor if necessary .  The interim PK anal ysis will be performed as 
soon as practical after the first 6 adult/adolescent subjects (age ≥12-75 years) have completed 
the stead y-state PK sampling schedule for both the IV (IV#2) and SC Phases (SC#14) of the 
trial.  Data from these 6 adult/adolescent subjects will be anal yzed using standard PK and 
statistical methodology  (Section 5 ) to evaluate and compare the AUC 0-τ’sof total IgG from 
the IV administration of IGIV -C 10% and SC administration of I GSC 20%.
The outcome of this interim analy sis will determine whether the dose adjustment factor will 
be modified. If the ratio of geometric LSM for AUC 0-7, SCvs.adjusted AUC 0-7, IV falls below 
10% of the desired 1.0 (ie, <0.9) , and the mean trough concentrations for the SC 
administration of IGSC 20% falls below the target level in more than 3 of the 6 
adult/adole scent subjects, then a dose adjustment factor increase would be implemented to 
ensure that the subjects receive an optimal IGSC 20% and are not susceptible to p otential 
bacterial infections.
If the ratio of geometric LSM for AUC 0-7, SCvs. adjusted AUC 0-7,IV, achieves ≥0.9, there will 
be no change in the dose adjustment factor.
Subjects enrolled early  in the trial may  complete their regularly  scheduled 24 weeks of SC 
therap y on the initial IGSC 20% dose before a decision from the interim analysis is availa ble. 
In this event, these subjects will continue to receive weekl y SC infusions of IGSC 20% until 
the interim PK analy sis deems whether or not a new dose adjustment factor would be 
required.  Subjects will return to the study  center every  [ADDRESS_697380] the 
same study  procedures performed as those at SC Week#21 with (at less frequent intervals)
safet y laboratory  assessments , IgG subclass levels, and specific antibody titers for S. 
pneumoniae , H. influenzae , and C. tetani (tetanus) every  8 weeks as detailed in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  This will continue until the interim analy sis is completed.  If the results of 
the interim anal ysis do not indicate a need for a dose adjustment factor change, subjects will 
be brought into the clinic and end of stud y procedures will be performed.
If the need for changing the dose adjustment factor arises, the revised dose adjustment factor 
will be calculated based on the ratio of the geometric L SM for AUC 0-7, SCvs. adjusted
AUC 0-7, IV with consideration of mean trough levels obtained from the SC administration of 
IGSC 20%.

3.3.2 Rationale for Selection of Doses/Timing of Investigational Products
[IP_ADDRESS] Selection of Doses and Timing of Dosing in the Study
In the current study , the initial IV to SC dose adjustment calculation formula used is: 
The selection of dosing regimen for SC administration of IGSC 20% is based on literature
data of the bioavailability of SC administered IgG and prior experience with other products 
(Section 1.3.1 ). The weekly  IGSC 20% SC dosing regimen to be evaluated herein 
(1.37 times the currently  stable IV I GIV-C 10% dose divided by  4 for subjects on an 
every -4-week dosing interval or divided by 3 for subjects on an every -3-week dosing 
interval) should provide a stead y-state AUC of total IgG levels not inferior to that of the 
approved IV dose based on the est ablished bioequivalence acceptance data.
The initial SC dose selected based on a dose adjustment factor of 1.[ADDRESS_697390] 6 adult/adolescent subjects have completed both the IV and 
SC PK sampling schedule. If the interim PK analysis suggests that modification of the SC 
dose adjustment factor is needed, a new SC dose adjustment factor will be calculated and the 
procedures in Section 3.1.5 will be followed.300 to 800 mg/kg (IV dose)
3 or 4 (regular IV dosing interval in week)× 1.37 (IV to SC dose adjustment factor)
Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment 2 15 Mar 2016
CONFIDENTIAL Page 45of 94As described in Section 3.1 , the initial I V IGIV- C 10% dose (Run -In or IV Phase) and dosing 
interval will be individualized based on the treatment each subject is receiving for their PI [INVESTIGATOR_535820] (see Table 3-1).
[IP_ADDRESS] Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
The IV and SC dose of study  drug will be individualized based on each subject’s current IgG 
regimen which is assumed to be an effective dose. Subjects are required to have been 
clinically  stable for at least [ADDRESS_697391]. The IV IGIV -C 10% dose will be 
between 300 and 800 mg/kg during the Run- in phase and IV#1 and IV# 2.See Table 3-1.
Subjects currentl y on stable IV IGIV -C 10% (for at least 3 months) will receive their first IV 
dose of IGIV -
C 10% at the IV#1 visit.  Subjects currentl y on IVIG therap y other than IV 
IGIV -C 10% will receive IV IGIV- C 10% for at least 3 months (during Run -In Phase) prior 
to the I V#1 visit. Subjects currentl y on SCIG therapy, or whose IVIG dose is not stable for 
the 3 months prior to Screening, or IVIG dose is not between 300 and 800 mg/kg per infusion 
or not receiving infusions every  3 or 4 weeks at Screening will receive IV IG IV-C 10% for at 
least 4 months in Run- In Phase prior to the IV#1 visit. Subjects will return to the clinic at 
their next scheduled IV dosing interval (ie, 3 or 4 weeks later) to receive a 2nd IV IGIV- C 
10% dose (IV#2 Visit).
The first SC administered IGSC 20% will be initiated 7 day s after the 2nd IV IGIV -C 10% 
dose (at the SC Week#1 visit).  Weekly  (q 7 day s ±1 day ) SC administrations of IGSC 20% 
will continue for a tota l of [ADDRESS_697392] is on a 3 week dosing regimen multiplied by 1.37 as previously  described.
If the interim PK anal ysis suggests that modification of the SC dose adjustment factor is 
needed, a new SC dose adjustment factor will be calculated and the procedures in 
Section 3.1.5 will be followed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Subcutaneous Administration Procedures for IGSC 20%
The number of injection sites, infusion rate, and the specific times of the day  for the SC 
infusion may  be individualized by  [CONTACT_81903]. The first [ADDRESS_697393] will be trained thoroughl y on its u se.  
The PK focus of the study will be emphasized t o all the subjects/caregivers. Subjects will be 
instructed to closely  adhere to their individualized dosing regimen accurately  and cautioned 
not to round-up to the whole vial or to under dose.  The exact IGSC 20% dose (and dose 
volume) based on the predetermined adjustment factor and the stable IV dose of IGIV -C 10% 
willbe administered and recorded.
Details regarding infusion rate and infusion administration are located in the pharmacy /study  
manual. Subjec ts may  use the same anatomical area or rotate anatomical areas for SC 
infusions throughout the study . No more than 8 infusion sites per infusion will be used. The 
minimum distance between infusion sites is recommended to be no less than 2 inches. The

CONFIDENTIAL Page 46of 94targe t infusion rate will be no greater than 25 mL/hour/site as tolerated by  [CONTACT_535853]’s discretion; the I nvestigator will tailor the infusion configuration for each 
subject. Once the target infusion rate is achieved, it should not be changed in the middle of 
an infusion unless the subject experiences tolerability  issues at that infusion rate. In the event 
that the subject is not able to tolerate the set infusion rate, the rate may  be decreased for 
better tolerability . Conversely , if the target infusion rate is well tolerated during 2 infusions ,
an increase of 20% in infusion rate and volume per site is allowed at the discretion of the 
Investigator at the time of theclinic visit.
The volume infused, number of infusion sites, infusion start date/time, infusion end 
date/time, the location(s) of infusions, and the initial and final rate of infusion for each 
infusion site, and other SC infusion information will be recorded in the SC In fusion Diary  by

[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment and Recording of Infections
The site is to record non -serious infections (b y category ), which include infections of any  
kind including for example acute sinusitis, ex acerbation of chronic sinusitis, acute otitis 
media, pneumonia, acute bronchitis, infectious diarrhea, etc., which will be recorded as an 
AE with the Investigator answering the following question affirmativel y in the eCRF: “Is this 
an infection? ”(verbatim term delineating nature of infection). Also record validated 
infections documented by [CONTACT_415257], fever (>38°C oral or >39°C rectal), culture, or 
diagnostic testing for microorganisms eg, bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoal pathogens (for 
instance, rapid streptococcal antigen test). The specific evaluations performed to validate 
infections must be recorded in the eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Virus Safety Testing
Virus safet y (viral NAT and viral serology) retain samples collected at SC Week#1 prior to

consistent with HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV, or B19V infection while participating in the study . 
Virus safet y samples will be retained until all analyses in support of the study are complete . 
Additional blood samples for viral NAT and viral serology  testing may  be collected and 
tested during the study  only  if the subject exhibits clinical signs and s ymptoms consistent 
with HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV, or B19V infection while participating in the study . Note: For 
pediatric subjects, at the discretion of the Investigator, virus safety  retain samples may  be
drawn 1 or 2 day sprior to SC Week#1 instead of combining with other blood draws on a 
single day .
Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment 2 15 Mar 2016
CONFIDENTIAL Page 63of [IP_ADDRESS] D-dimer and Wells Score
The Wells Score for DVT and PE with associated citations is described in Appendix 4 which 
provides full details for assigning point score for each of these individual condition s. At 
Screening and prior to administering IGSC 20% for the first time at the SC Week #1 Clinic 
Visit ,Wells Score and blood draw for D -dimer will be performed to establish a pretreatment 
benchma rk (prior to receiving IGIV- C 10% and pr ior to beginning IGSC 20%, respectively ).
At subsequent visits during the SC Phase, the Wells Score and blood draw for D -dimer will 
be performed only if the abbreviated ph ysical exam and Specific Signs/S ymptoms Check 
(defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]) raise s any clinical/medical concerns regarding possible presence 
of DVT or PE. 
As delineated in Appendix [ADDRESS_697435] with a total Wells prediction score >1 for the DVT
assessment or >[ADDRESS_697436] has a 
high negative predictive value.  If the D -dimer is positive at any  time after the Screening time 
point (ie, above Screening value, exceeding cutoff range of the reporting laboratory ), redraw 
a blood sample for repeat D -dimer testing at the central laboratory  within one week to 
confirm. In all situations, the Investigator should use best medical judgment to evaluate the 
subject as medicall y indicated.
3.7 Removal of Subjects
Subjects will withdraw or be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:
At their own request or at the request of their legally  acceptable representative
If, in the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation in the study  would be detrimental to the
subject's well -being
At the specific request of the Sponsor
Also, subjects willbe withdrawn from I P/study  drug or the study  for the following reasons :
Subjects with an occurrence of a concomitant disease, or an y medical condition which,
either because of its severity  or duration or necessary  change in treatment, contravenes
the condition of the study or puts the subj ect at unnecessary  risk or harm
Subje cts with an occurrence of an AE which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3755]/or
subject requires termination of treatment
Subjects who develop an SBI prior to the first dose of IGSC 20%
Subjects who are noncompliant with the protocol per the Investigator’s discretion
Pregnancy
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the eCRF and in the subject's 
source documentation.
Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment [ADDRESS_697437] discontinues study  after receiving IGIV -C 10% but prior to receiving the first 
dose of IGSC 20%, an addition al subject may  be recruited into the study  to assure that 30 
adults and 12 children complete IGSC 20% treatment .
3.8 Follow -up of Subjects Withdrawn from Study
Subjects who receive an y amount of I P/study  drug and discontinue early  from the study  will 
be reques ted to return clinic to have all assessments completed for the Early  Termination 
Visit (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Appendix 1 ) as close as practical to [ADDRESS_697438] 
administration of the I P/study  drug .
3.9 Premature Termination of Study /Closure of Center
The Sponsor, I RB/EC, and/or regulatory  authorities have the right to close this study  or a 
study  center, and the Investigator/Sponsor has the right to close a center, at any  time, 
although this should occur only  after consultation among involved parties. The I RB/EC must 
be informed. Should the study /center be closed prematurel y, all stud y materials (except 
documentation that has to remain stored at site) must be returned to the Sponsor. The 
Investigator will retain all other documents until notification given b y the Sponsor for 
destruction.
A study  center c an be closed for the following reasons:
Lack of enrollment
Non-compliance with the requirements of the study protocol
Non-compliance with International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice
(ICH GCP)
STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_535826] A W HOLE :
As a conservative measure, if 5 subjects on IGSC 20% develop an SAE of exactly  the same 
type (ie, the same MedDRA [Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities] preferred term) 
which is not an infection or manifestation of an underly ing disorder documented in medical 
history , then this would constitute an unanticipated clustering which could signal a potential 
safety concern. If this situation were to arise, the Sponsor will constitute a Safety  Review 
Committee (SRC) whose members (from Grifols) will be impartial and independent of the 
clinical trial team. In cases where there is a clear medical plausibility  supporting an 
uncommon clustering of SAEs of the same t ype (not including infections), and these sentinel 
SAEs are designated as ‘definitely  related’, ‘ probably  related’, or ‘possibly  related’ by  [CONTACT_535863], consideration would be given to possibly  discontinuing the 
study .
4ADVERSE EVENTS
4.1 Warnings/Precautions
For complete informa tion on IGSC 20% or IGIV-C 10%, refer to their respective IBs.
Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment [ADDRESS_697439] be carefully monitored for AEs. This monitoring includes clinical and 
laboratory  tests and ph ysical signs. Adverse events should be assessed in terms of their 
seriousness, severity , and causal relationship to the I P/study  drug .
4.[ADDRESS_697440] a causal relationship with this treatment . An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an y abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not c onsidered related 
to the medicinal product.
Any AE that occurs at any  time between the signature [CONTACT_406912]’s 
participation in the clinical trial must be reported and recorded in the AE eCRF.
All infusion site reactions will be recorded. For the subset of local infusion site reactions 
where the s ymptoms/signs lead to infusion interruption or discontinuation, require 
concomitant medication, or have an impact on the general condition of the subject as judged 
by [CONTACT_737] ,these will be considered as AEs .
4.3.2 Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions/Adverse Reactions
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product or study  treatment related to 
any dose should be considered suspected ADRs. The phrase “responses to a medicinal 
product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product or study  treatment and 
an AE is at least a reasonable possibility , that is, the relationship cannot be ruled out. In the 
framework of this study , a suspected ADR with a causal relationshi p of “definite” will be 
labeled as an AR; thus, ARs are a subset of suspected ADRs.
The Sponsor is responsible for assessing the suspected ADR expectedness during the clinical 
trial.
4.3.3 Causality of Adverse Event
The Investigator is required to provide a caus ality assessment for each AE reported to the 
Sponsor. The Sponsor will consider the Investigator’s causality  assessment. Assessment of 
the causal relationship to the study  drug will be made according to the following 
classifications based on Karch FE et al . (39):
Definite : An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
treatment or in which the treatment level has been established in body  fluids or tissues; and 
that is confirmed b y improvement on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_56220] (dechallenge), and reappearance 
of the event on repeated exposure (rechallenge).
Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment 2 15 Mar 2016
CONFIDENTIAL Page 66of 94Probable : An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
treatment; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_23827]; and that could not be reasonably  explained by  
[CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state.
Possible : An event that follows a reason able temporal sequence from administration of the 
treatment but that could have been produced by  [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other modes of 
therap y administered to the subject.
Doubtful/Unlikely: An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence fro m 
administration of the treatment; but that could not be reasonabl y explained by [CONTACT_93735]’s clinical state.
Unrelated : Any  event that does not meet the criteria above.
The operational tool to decide the AE causal relationshi p is based on algorithms by  [CONTACT_535864]. and Naranjo CA et al. ( 40,41).
When an AE is classified, assessing causal relationship by  [CONTACT_29256], as definitive, ie, 
“probable”, “possible” or “doubt ful/unlikely ”, the event will be defined as a suspected ADR. 
A suspected ADR with a causal relationship of “definite” will be defined as an AR. When the 
causal relationship is labeled “unrelated”, then it will be considered that the AE is not 
imputable to the study  treatment and it is not a suspected ADR.
In addition, when a causal relationship between the study  treatment and the AE cannot be 
ruled out by  [CONTACT_11219]/or Sponsor, it means that the AE cannot be labeled 
“unrelated”.
For an y subject, a ll AEs that occur at any  time from the beginning of IP/study  drug
administration until the final visit of the clinical trial will be considered as treatment 
emergent AEs (TEAEs).
For AEs that occur during infusions, the infusion rate in effect at the time of onset of the AE, 
the time of onset of the AE and the time of AE change materiall y in intensity and/or resolve 
will be captured.
4.3.4 Severity of Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction
AEs and suspected ADRs will be classified depending on their sev erity according to the 
following definitions:
1.Mild: an AE which is well tolerated by  [CONTACT_423], causing minimum degree of malaise
and without affecting normal activities.
2.Moderate: an AE that interferes with the subject’s normal activities.
3.Severe: an AE that prevents the subject from performing their normal activities.
Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment [ADDRESS_697441] is considered “unexpected” if the nature, seriousness, severit y or 
outcome of the reaction(s) is not consistent with the reference information. The expectedness 
of an AR sha ll be determined by  [CONTACT_535865] (ie , IB).
Events not listed for the particular drug under investigation in the IB are considered 
“unexpected” and those listed are considered “expected.”  When new Serious ADRs 
(potentiall y related SAEs) are received, it is the Sponsor’s responsibility to determine 
whether the event sare “unexpected” for expedited safet y reporting purposes.
4.3.6 Seriousness of Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction; 
Serious Adverse Event
An AE or suspected ADR is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:
1.Death
2.Life-threatening AE (life -threatening in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event
which hy potheticall y might have caused death if it were more severe)
3.In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
4.A persistent or significant incapacit y or subs tantial disruption of the ability  to conduct
normal life functions
5.A congenital anomal y/birth defect
6.An important medical event (important medical event in the definition of “serious” refers
to those events which may not be immediatel y life -threatening, or result in death, or
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but from medical and scientific judgment may  jeopardize the subject
or/and may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes
listed above).
This definition permits either the Sponsor or the Investigator to decide whether an event is 
“serious”. If either the Sponsor or the Investigator believes that the event is serious, the event 
must be considered “serious” and evaluated b y the S ponsor for expedited reporting.
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs. The term “severe” is used to 
describe the intensit y (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of 
relative minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is no t the same as 
“serious”, which is defined on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually  associated 
Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment [ADDRESS_697442]’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severit y) is a 
medical term while severity  is a subjective term.
According to the medical criteria, an AE or a suspected ADR can be classified as serious, 
although it does not fulfill the conditions fixed in this section, if it is considered important 
from a medical point of view.
4.3.[ADDRESS_697443] has signed the ICF through the Final Visit (ie, 
end of study ) must be fully  recorded in the subject’s eCRF or SAE form and medical record. 
If no AE has occurred during the study period, this should also be indi cated in the eCRF.
It is the responsibility  of the I nvestigator to ensure that AEs are appropriately  recorded.
At each visit, AEs will be elicited b y asking the individual a non -leading question such as 
“Do you feel different in any way  since the last visi t?”  Moreover, AEs will also be collected 
through directl y observed events or spontaneously volunteered b y the subject. Clearl y related 
signs, s ymptoms and abnormal diagnostic procedures should preferabl y be grouped together 
and recorded as a single diagno sis or s yndrome wherever possible.
The following variables must be recorded in the AE eCRF:
1.the verbatim term (a diagnosis is preferred)
2.date/time of onset
3.date/time of resolution
4.severit y (mild, moderate, severe)
5.causality  (unrelated, doubtful/unlikely , possible, probable, definite)*
6.seriousness (y es, no)
7.action taken (with regard to I P/study  drug)
8.other action (to treat the event)
9.outcome and sequel (follow -up on AE)
*Causality  assessment will be made only  when the AE occurs after the subject has
initiat ed at least one infusion of the I P/study  drug. An AE occurring before subject's
exposure to I P/study  drug will be alway s labeled as "unrelated".
For AEs that occur during infusions, the infusion rate in effect at the time of onset of the AE, 
the time of o nset of the AE and the time of AE change materiall y in intensity and/or resolve 
will be captured in the eCRF.
In addition to the I nvestigator’s own description of the AEs, each AE will be encoded 
according to the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activitie s (MedDRA).
For example, a laboratory test abnormality  considered clinically  relevant, eg,causing the 
subject to withdraw from the study , requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical 
Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment [ADDRESS_697444] be described in detail along with start and stop dates, severit y, relationship to 
IP/study  drug , action taken, and outcome. Each event must be adequatel y supported by
[CONTACT_422385]’s medical or case file.
A pregnancy  not verified before the screening visit but occurring during the course of the 
study  will not be considered an AE unless a relation to the study  drug is at least suspected. In 
any case, a Pregnancy  Report Form must be completed and sent within [ADDRESS_697445] has 
been resolved. If an AE/suspected ADR/SAE is present when the subject has completed the 
study , the course of the event must be followed until the final outcome is know n, or the event 
has been stabilized and no further change is expected and the Investigator decides that no 
further follow -up is necessary .
Any pregnancy  must be followed by  [CONTACT_406899] .
4.4 Reporting of Serious A dverse E vents or Pregnancy
4.4.1 Reporting Serious Adverse Event
Any SAE (see 
Section 4.3.6 ) that occurs after signing the study ICF through the Final 
Visit (ie, end of study) must be expeditiously  reported whether or not considered attributable 
to the study  drug. Each SAE must be fully  recorded in the subject’s eCRF and SAE Report 
Form.
SAEs will be reported using the designated SAE Report Form. When the In vestigator 
becomes aware of an SAE, she/he must submit a completed, signed and dated SAE Report 
Form (in English) within 24 hours to the Sponsor by  [CONTACT_6968]/fax.
Each SAE must be followed up until resolution or stabilization. After the initial report, all 
relevant information for SAE follow up, and for the outcome, must also be supplied to the 
Sponsor in a timely  manner (within 3 day s from its identification or within 24 hours for 
relevant new information) by  [CONTACT_406898]. In addition, the Spon sor or 
contract research organization (CRO) may  request additional information and/or reports.
All SAE Report Forms and Pregnancy  Report Form smust be reported to:

5.1.[ADDRESS_697449] Populations for Analysis
Safety  Population
The safet y population will include all subjects who received any  amount of study  drugs 
(IGIV -C 10% and/or IGSC 20%) and will be used for safety  anal ysis.
PK Population
The PK population will consist of all subjects who receive study  drugs and have sufficient 
and vali d total IgG concentration vs. time data for either the IV or SC P hase to allow 
calculation of AUC 0-τ,SCor AUC 0-τ,IV(the primary PK endpoint).
The validity  of total IgG concentrations  will be reviewed and determined before the database 
lock based on consideration of treatment compliance and blood sampling/testing issues (such 
as collection problem). Any  invalid total IgG concentrations will be flagged with the reason 
for invalidity  in the listing.
Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment [ADDRESS_697450] an y total 
IgG concentration data. The summary  of total IgG concentration data will be based on IgG 
Population.
5.1.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
The demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized. F or quantitative variables, 
mean, SD, median, and minimum/maximum will be provided. For qualitative variables, the 
frequency  and percentage will be provided.
5.1.3 Pharmacokinetic Analysis
All subjects in the PK Population as defined above will be included in the PK analy sis.  Total 
IgG concentrations will be summarized for IV and SC by [CONTACT_535866].  Individual and 
mean total IgG concentrations vs. time curves will be plotted.  PK parameters of total IgG 
will be determined b y noncompartmental PK methods using W inNonlin Professional version 
6.4 or above (Pharsight Corporation, Cary , NC).  Steady -state PK parameters to be 
calculated, as appropriate ,or as permitted b y data, will include AUC, C max, and t max.  All PK 
parameters will be calculated separatel y for IV a nd SC administration and will be tabulated 
and summarized descriptively .  The mean and the lower and upper bounds of the 90% CI will 
be calculated on ln -transformed AUC parameters.  These mean and lower and upper bounds 
will be back-transformed (exponentiated) to provide the geometric mean and 90% CI  on the 
original scale .
The Primary  PK endpoint is the steady -state AUC over a dosing interval defined as follows:
AUC 0-τ,SC , the AUC over a weekly dosing interval (τ) at an approximate steady -state
condition following weekly  SC infusion, ie, AUC 0-7 days.
AUC 0-τ,IV , the AUC over a regular dosing interval (τ) at an approximate steady -state
condition following the regular IV infusion, either every  3 wee ks or every  4 weeks, ie,
AUC 0-21 days or AUC 0-28 days , respectively .
AUC 0-τ,SCis to be obtained after the 13th SC dose of IGSC 20% at the weekly  dose 
calculated using the final dose adjustment factor, and AUC 0-τ,IV is to be obtained following 
IV infusi on of IGIV -C 10% at the IV#1 visit.  Since the dosing interval (τ) is 7 day s for the 
SC dose, AUC 0-τ,SC is determined as AUC 0-7 days .  For IV dosing, the dosing interval (τ) is 
21or 28 day s for the 3 -week or 4- week subjects, AUC 0-τ,IVis determined as AUC 0-21 days or 
AUC 0-28 days , respectively.
Prior to statistical comparison of AUC 0- τ’s between the IV IGIV -C 10% and SC I GSC 20% 
doses, the AUC 0-21 days from the IV infusion in subjects on a 3- week IV dosing interval will be 
divided by  3 or the AUC 0-28 days from IV dosing in subjects on a 4 -week IV dosing interval 
divided by  4 for comparison with AUC 0-7 days from the weekl y SC infusion.
Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment 2 15 Mar 2016
CONFIDENTIAL Page 72of 94The hy pothesis to be tested is that the weekl y SC dose of IGSC 20% will achieve an 
approximate steady -state AUC 0-τ,SCof total IgG that is non -inferior to that achieved b y a 
regular IV dose of IGIV -C 10% (AUC 0-τ,IVdivided by  3 or 4 depending on the IV dosing 
intervals).  Non -inferiority  of steady -state IgG AUC between SC dose of IGSC 20% and IV 
IGIV -C 10% administration will be tested based on established regulatory guidelines for 
bioequivalence testing. The 90% CIof the geometric L SM ratio of SC AUC to I V AUC will 
be calculated.  The SC dose is considered to be non-inferior to the IV dose if the low bound 
of the 90% CIfor the geometric L SM AUC ratio is above 0.80 based on loge -transformed 
data.
Secondary  and Exploratory  PK Anal ysis
Secondary and exploratory  PK endpoints include the steady -state mean trough concentration 
of total IgG and the C max, tmaxof total IgG.  D escriptive statistics will be calculated for the 
steady -state mean trough concentration of total IgG and for the C max, andtmaxof total IgG.  
All pre -infusion total IgG concentrations obtained before and at the 13th SC dose of I GSC 
20% will be evaluated to determine if an approximate steady -state condition has been 
achieved b y the 13th SC dose.  The stead y-state mean trough concentrations of total IgG 
following SC administrated IGSC 20% will be determined as the average value of C trough
measurements obtain ed at Weeks#13, #14, #17, and #21. The average steady -state trough 
concentrations of total IgG following IV administrated IGIV -C 10% will be determined as 
the average value of C trough measurements obtained at the IV#1 visit and at 21 or 28 day s 
after the IV#1 IGIV -C10% dose (depending on dosing interval), ie, immediately  prior to the 
administration of IV dose at IV#2 visit.
Summaries will be provided for trough concentration of total IgG and each of its subclasses 
between IV infusion of IGIV -C 10% and SC administration of I GSC 20%.  Summaries of 
trough level concentration of antibody  titers against S. pneumonia, H.influenza, and C. tetani 
will also be provided.
Depending on the number of subjects being dosed on IGIV -C 10% at [ADDRESS_697451] 6 adult/adolescent subjects (aged ≥12-75 years) 
have completed the PK sampling schedule for both the IV and SC (after the 13th SC dose) 
Phases of the trial.  PK data from these 6 adult/adolescent subjects will be anal yzed using 
procedures as described in Section 5.1.3 above.  A decision on whether to modify  the dose 
adjustment factor for calculating the SC dose will be made base d on this interim PK analy sis.
Final PK and statistical analy sis will be based on the PK data obtained after the final (or 
adjusted, if an y) SC dose administered in all completed subjects.

Other exploratory  variables include the following:
Serious bacterial infections
All infections of an y kind (serious/nonserious including acute sinusitis, e xacerbation of
chronic sinusitis, acute otitis media, pneumonia, acute bronchitis, infectious diarrhea,
etc.) which will be recorded as an AE with the Investigator answering the following
question affirmativel y in the eCRF: “Is this an infection? (verbat imterm delineating
infection).
Validated infections documented by  [CONTACT_415257], fever (>38°C oral or >39°C
rectal), culture, or diagnostic testing for microorganisms , eg, bacterial, viral, fungal or
protozoal pathogens (for instance, rapid streptococcal antigen detection test).
Number of day s on antibiotics (including oral, parenteral, oral plus parenteral,
prophy lactic and therapeutic). Use of prophy lactic antibiotics will be distinguished from
antibiotics for treatment of acute infection.
Number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_415190]
Number of day s of work/school/daily  activities missed due to infections and their
treatment.
These parameters will be summarized descriptively. The number and p roportion of subjects 
having any SBI, infections, d ays on antibiotics, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_415190], and days of 
work/school/daily  activities missed due to infections will be calculated and summarized. 
Furthermore, the total number of events or day s and corresponding annualized rate per 
subject of SBIs, infections, days on antibiotics, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_415190], and day s of 
work/school/daily  activities missed due to infections will be calculated and summarized.
5.1.6 Safety Analysis
The safet y analyses are based on the safet y population.
All AEs , suspected ADRs, ARs , SAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs and SAEs will be 
summarized by  [CONTACT_535846]. The summaries will be presented b y MedDRA sy stem organ class and preferred 
term. A E summaries b y severit y will also be provided. L ocal infusion site reactions will be 
similarly  summarized. Non-serious infections of any  kind (including acute sinusitis, 
exacerbation of chronic sinusitis, acute otitis media, pneumonia, acute bronchitis, in fectious 
diarrhea, etc.) as determined by  [CONTACT_535867] a safet y endpoint and 
will be similarly  summarized .
Subjects with deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to premature discontinuation from the study  
will be listed and presented in a narrative form.
Adverse events temporally  associated with IV or SC administration of study  drug will be 
defined as those occurring during or within 72 hours of completion of an infusion. 
Protocol GTI1502 – Amendment 2 15 Mar 2016
CONFIDENTIAL Page 74of 94Additionally , local infusion site reactions will be tabulated and su mmarized for the total 
duration of the study  and by  [CONTACT_535847] 20% infusion week.
For all laboratory  tests and vital signs, the original value and the change from Baseline will 
be summarized for numeric results and frequency/percentage will be summarized for 
qualitative results. For laboratory  tests with normal ranges, out of normal range values will 
be flagged and shift tables will be provided.

aTwo of the following should be present to make the diagnosis of sepsis in adults: temperature >38°C oral/ 
>39°C rectal or <36°C oral or <37°C rectal; heart rate >90 beats/min; respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] >20 breaths/min , or 
PaCO 2 <32 mmHg; WBC count >12,000/mm3, <4,000/mm3, or >10% immature (band) forms (42).For 
pediatric subjects, w e recommend you employ the definition of sepsis using age -specific crit eria as 
recommended by [CONTACT_415281] (43).
bIndw elling catheter -or vascular access device -related blood -borne infections are not included because 
evidence is lacking that these are preventable w ith IVIG replacement therapy. For subjects w ithout indwelling 
catheters or vascular access devices, a single blood c ulture positive for a pathogenic organism will meet the 
diagnostic criteria for bacteremia. (Multiple blood cultures are typi[INVESTIGATOR_415238]/sepsis, as per standard medical practice, and the finding of a single positive cult ure should prompt 
additional confirmatory cultures). Subjects meeting criteria for positive blood culture but without 2 or more of 
the sepsis criteria listed above will be classified as having bacteremia.
cA blood culture positive for grow th of S. pneumon iae, Neisseria meningitides , or H. influenzae, in 
combination with CSF leukocytosis and/or decrease in CSF glucose, can serve to confirm the diagnosis of 
acute bacterial meningitis (44).

dFor the diagnosis of pneumonia in adults, commonly at least 2 of the listed symptoms and/or signs should be 
present in conjunction with at least one laboratory and one imaging studies diagnostic element. How ever, for 
the purposes of counting serious infection epi[INVESTIGATOR_11630] a clinical trial of IVIG, the finding of a new pulmonary 
infiltrate with consolidation on CXR is considered sufficient. To establish the diagnosis of bacterial 
pneumonia for pediatric patients, most of the same diagnostic criteria listed may be used, with the following 
exceptions: Because pediatric patients may not produce a sputum specimen for culture, blood cultures or 
serology may be substituted to identify th e etiologic bacterial pathogen. In infants age [ADDRESS_697494] a higher baseline temperature, fever is defined as a rectal temperature >38.3°C (101°F). In 
children >2 years, fever is more commonly defined as a rectal temperature >38°C (100 .4°F). In pediatric 
patients, elevations of WBC counts >15,000/mm3are frequent but could be variable in patients with bacterial 
pneumonia, or leukopenia with WBC count <5000/mm3may be observed, usually associated w ith severe 
infection (45).

 Enhancing Older Adult's Everyday Memory Function  
Study Protoc ol 
NCT #: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]    
12/07/[ADDRESS_565489] Overview  
The Everyday Memory and Metacognitive Intervention (EMMI) is assessed in comparison to an Active Control 
group (MSC).  Participants are randomly assigned to either the EMMI group or MSC gr oup. All participants, 
regardless of being assigned to the EMMI group versus MSC group , follow the same procedure  (outlined 
below) . The only difference between the two groups is the type of memory training the participants receive , 
which corresponds to the type of shapi[INVESTIGATOR_444610].  
 
The intervention was administered in small groups of 3 -6 persons all from the same intervention arm (MSC or 
EMMI).  There were four group learning experiences (GLEs), [ADDRESS_565490] and assistants.  These sessions lasted 3 hours and 
emphasized interaction and group discussion of key points, as well opportunities for participants to share with 
each other ideas or insights they gained through working on in -class exercises.   Participants  also completed 
assigned homework  tasks practicing trained skills  between each session.  Homework was discussed in the next 
GLE, but was also reviewed in one -on-one shapi[INVESTIGATOR_444611], in which  a member of the team contact[CONTACT_444622], with specific reference to 
homework exercises.  
 
A key measurement method for the study was using smartphone apps on burner Samsung Galaxy phones that 
were locked down so as to ena ble use of the phone only for the research study.  Individuals reported on 
everyday memory experiences via event -based memory problem reporting and an end -of-day diary that 
recorded reports of memory failures that had occurred that day.  The training progr am for participants 
required extensive technical support in how to use these burner phones for ecological momentary assessment 
(EMA).

Re-Design to Accommodate COVID -[ADDRESS_565495] on the campus of Georgia Tech, as 
was done with our original intervention study (Pearman et al., 2020).  The pandemic forced us to convert to 
completely remote assessment, which also required providing technical support to participants in using web -
based platforms.  All questionnaires, surveys, and cognitive tests were administered via Qualtri cs forms, except 
the proprietary iFunction programs used to simulate everyday complex IADLs.  Programs had to be modified to 
account for computing power and bandwidth  issues for some participants, identified in pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299].  Some (but 
relatively little) data were lost through lost internet connections, program crashes, etc.

Background:  It has been widely recognized that severe disease from SARS -CoV -2 infection has been attributed 
to a substantial dysregulation of the immune system leading to significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798], end organ 
damage and death (1). Central to this immune response are certain cytokines, specifically those that activate the 
Type 2 (Th 2) pathway of inflammation, which have been associated with severe disease in COVID -19 (2,3) . 
Interleukin -13 (IL -13) has been identified as a key driver in respi[INVESTIGATOR_485771] -19 and, when neutralized in mice, has shown reduced disease severity. Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], an 
inhibitor of IL -13 and IL -4 used curren tly in treatment of atopic disease, has also been associated with reduced 
disease severity when observing outcomes of those diagnosed with COVID -19 who are concomitantly prescribed 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (2). This therefore raises the possibility of successful use of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485772] -[ADDRESS_624103] for more targeted anti -inflammatory therapy in these patients.  
 
Clinical Experience:  Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], an anti -interleukin -[ADDRESS_624104] been implicated, including asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (4).

3.0 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
3.1 Background and Scientific Rationale  
It has been widely recognized that severe disease from SARS -CoV -2 infection has been attributed to a substantial 
dysregulation of the immune system leading to significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798], end organ damage and death 
(1). This has been further exemplified through finding a reduction in mortality of COVID -19 patients requiring 
oxygen with use of dexamethasone when compared to patients not receiving steroids (11). Central to this 
inflammatory process are cytokines, including interleukin -6 (IL -6), which have led to clinical trials investigating 
their blockade in severe COVID -19 infection (12). However, due to the significant heterogeneity of cytokine 
elevations seen in SARS -CoV -2 infection, it has been difficult to identify specific targets for intervention that are 
associated with and can provide clinical benefit for patients with COVID -19 (12–14). Nevertheless some studies 
have implicated type 2 (Th 2) cytokines in severe disease (3). 
 
Elevated interleukin -13 (IL -13), a Th 2 cytokine, has been shown to be  a central component of the immune 
response leading to ventilation in patients with SARS -CoV -2 infection. This was validated in two separate patient 
cohorts from University of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center, and is consistent 
with findings of Lucas et al. in demonstrating an association of IL -13 with severe COVID -19 disease (2,3) . 
Furthermore, Lucas et al. show increasing levels of IL -13 through the course of disease, with elevations out to day 
25 of illness (3).  IL-[ADDRESS_624121] hyperresponsiveness and atopic disease (15). 
Inhibition of IL -13 in a K18 - hACE2 transgenic  mouse model led to improved clinical scores and reduced weight 
loss when infected with SARS -CoV -2. RNAseq analysis of mice infected with SARS -CoV -2 further found 
elevations in type 2 associated genes (2). Hyaluronan, a pulmonary glycosaminoglycan whose low molecular 
weight form is proinflammatory and implicated in numerous other lung pathologies, was identified as a driver of 
pulmonary disease in COVID -[ADDRESS_624122] or of IL -13 (2,16) . 
 
This has led to consideration of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], an anti -interleukoin -4 receptor -α monoclonal antibody which blocks 
signaling by [CONTACT_485864]-4 and IL -13, as a treatment for moderate to severe COVID -19 infection. In a large

patients of similar comorbidities (2).

successfully shown to reduce disease severity in not only those with atopic dermatitis but in other allergic diseases 
where Th [ADDRESS_624124] been implicated, including asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (4). Original clinical trials 
noted limited adverse events in addition to its favorability in use for treatment of atopic patients as a steroid 
sparing regimen (5,6) . Overall, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]’s excellent safety profile, its demonstrated ability in reduce other Th [ADDRESS_624125] FDA approved in the [LOCATION_002] for treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in 
adults uncontrolled with topic al medications. In 2018, it was approved in patients with moderated to severe 
asthma aged 12 years or older with eosinophilic phenotypes or with oral steroid dependent asthma (4). In 2019 , 
the FDA approved its use in adults with nasal polyps accompanied by [CONTACT_485865] (17). Its use in atopic 
dermatitis was extended to children aged 6 -11 years old in 2020 for those with moderate to severe disease not 
adequately controlled with topi[INVESTIGATOR_485792] (18). Studies of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485793] 2 associated biomarkers in addition to reduction in expression of genes 
involved in Th 2 inflammation including IL -13 (4,19) . Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485794] a single -dose pre filled syringe of 
either 300 mg per 2mL solution or 200 mg per 1.14 mL solution, which are administered subcutaneously. For 
atopic dermatitis, a 600 mg initial dose followed by [CONTACT_36527] 300 mg injecte d every other week is 
recommended (4). A peak mean concentration of drug is reached within one week of initial dosing. Although 
trough concentrations were noted to be lower in adult patients with higher body weights, no dose adjustments are 
recommended. In addition, while  there have not been any studies on the pharmacokinetics of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485795], no dose adjustments are recommended in these patients (4).  
 
Adverse events (AEs)  identified through clinical trials with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485796] -analysis 
studies (4). Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485797] a lower risk of skin infections which is suspected 
to be due to its normalization of the skin barrier (4,9) . Prescribing information additionally lists conjunctivitis as 
an AE with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485798], although this increased risk was not seen in asthma and 
chronic sinusitis trials. Conjunctivitis epi[INVESTIGATOR_485799] e in severity with rare need for drug 
discontinuation (4). Additional prescribing information for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485800] (9). Although no trials  to date  have been devoted to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485801], there  are trials ongoing in this patient population (20).  
 
Clinical trials in asthma patients revealed similar rates of AEs across study groups. Common AEs from these 
trials included injection site reactions, nasopharyngitis, nausea, conjunctivitis, headache, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_67705], bronchitis,  and sinusitis. Transient eosinophilia (>500  cells/  µL) was noted in both phase 2 and phase 3 
asthma clinical trials  (4). In the LIBERTY ASTHMA VENTURE phase 3 international, randomized, double -
blind, placebo -controlled trial enrolling 210 asthma patients found asymptomatic eosinophilia in 14% of 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485802] 1% of placebo patients. Per the trial authors, eosinophilia was of no 
clinical consequence in these patients  (10). In LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST phase 3 randomized, double -blind - 
placebo -controlled, parallel group enrolling 1,902 asthma patients, eosinophilia was seen in 4.1% of the 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485802] 0.6% of the placebo treated patients, with 1.2% of d upi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] -treated with 
eosinophil counts of greater than 3,000 cells/µL. Eosinophilia in this trial resulted in eight patients to be 
discontinued from the trial (7 in the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_125311] 1 in the control group)  (7). In a multicenter 
retrospective cohort enrolling 214 patients with atopic dermatitis  found higher rates of eosinophilia than in the 
clinical trials, reporting  57% had eosinophilia out of [ADDRESS_624126] 1 eosinophil count measured 
Version date: 2-2-22 13 with 29.8% with hypereosinophilia (>1500 cells/ µL) and a maximum count of 7800 cells/ µL. A total of five of 
these patients discontinued the drug due to persistent hypereosinophilia (21).

5.8 Known potential risks  
5.8.1 Conjunctivitis  
Prescribing information for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485809], although this increased risk was not seen in asthma and chronic sinusitis trials (4). A meta -
analysis done with clinical trials for use  of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485810] a reported conjunctivitis 
rate of 8% in those treated with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485811] 3.6% receiving placebo (18). Another meta -
analysis comparing twenty -two unique studies involving dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485812] a 
pooled proportion of 26.1% in those receiving dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]. In most studies , details of conjunctivitis 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_485813] (1 9). Regardless, given the high occurrence of ocular disease in these patients, and in some 
circumstance’s severe disease, we will exclude patients with history of certain ocular diseases as listed in 
our exclusion criteria. Occurrence of ocular symptoms wil l be assessed and managed per the investigator 
team with consultation of Ophthalmology  depending on clinical severity.  
 
5.8.2 Herpes Reactivation  
Prescribing information for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485814] (4). Initial clinical trials for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485815] 
6.1% of participants treated with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24767] 5.2% in those treated with placebo (18). Subsequent 
meta -analysis of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485816] 
 
12C-reactive protein and ferritin levels will be analyzed through UVAMC clinical lab.  
13Patient will be required to have mandatory in person follow up 14 days after initial dupi[INVESTIGATOR_161289]. Therefore, if patient 
inpatient through day 14 thus receiving 2nd dupi[INVESTIGATOR_161289], will be required to follow up 14 days after (same for day 28 
injection).  
Version date: 2-2-22 18 and herpes infections, with a decrease odds of eczema herpeticum. They additionally found no  association 
between dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485817] (2 0). Another meta -analysis comparing twenty -two unique 
studies involving dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485818] a pooled proportion of 5.8% of herpes simplex 
virus (19). Given this, any concern for herpes infection will be assessed and managed per investig ator 
team. Severe manifestation of herpes virus including ocular herpes infection or herpes eczema herp eticum 
will involve prompt consultation of appropriate subspecialty teams and initiation  of treatment therapi[INVESTIGATOR_485819].  
 
5.8.[ADDRESS_624137] common adverse reaction found with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485820], 
which according to a meta -analysis of clinical trials for use in atopic dermatitis, occurred in 13.2% of 
those receiving dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485811] 6.5% in  those receiving placebo (18). Bothersome injection site 
reactions will be assessed and managed with appropriate symptomatic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
5.8.[ADDRESS_624138] been case reports of 
patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_485821] (21). Response to initial and 
second injection of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485822]. Any concern for 
acute hypersensitivity reaction will involve prompt assessment from the investigator or primary team and, 
if warranted, treatment with appropriate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (i.e. epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], steroids, diphenhydramine etc.).  
 
5.8.5 Hypereosinophilic Syndrome  
Hypereosinophilia  (HE) is defined as an eosinophil count  >1.5 k/µl on peripheral laboratory 
measurement and/or pathologic evaluation via tissue staining with evidence of : eosinophils exceeding 
20% of all nucleated cells  in a bone marrow section  and/or pathologist opi[INVESTIGATOR_485823]/or marked deposition of eosinophil granules. Hypereosinophilic syndrome  (HES)  is 
defined as meeting criteria for HE plus organ damage and/or dysfunction attributable to HE, and 
exclusion of other disorders a s a major reason for organ damage (22). While eosinophilia and HE were 
reported in dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485824], most of these instances 
were considered asymptomatic with no subsequent clinical consequences. In the phase 2b trial assessing 
efficacy and safety of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485825] 300 asthma patients  with a baseline blood eosinophil count >0.3 
k/µl, one subject discontinued study treatment due to HES, which was noted to resolve with subsequent 
steroid treatment (5). Patients will be monitored via lab work for eosinophilia, hypereosinophilia and HES 
as laid out in the treatment plan with frequent assessments of symptoms. Subjects  will be discontinued 
from study treatment and managed with appropriate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (i.e. high dose glucocorticoids etc.) with 
any evidence of or concern for HES as deemed by [CONTACT_92142].  
 
6.0 PREPARATION  AND ADMINISTRATION  OF DUPI[INVESTIGATOR_485826] ( normal  saline) will be maintained in prefilled syringe s as prepared by [CONTACT_485867] . Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485827]. Per package insert, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485828] 36°F 
to 46°F in original carton to protect from light. If necessary pre -filled syringes can be kept at room temperature 
up to 77°F for a maximum of [ADDRESS_624139] sun light (9).  
Subcutaneous injection will occur in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_485829], thigh or lower abdomen (avoiding areas within 
2 inches of navel)  and avoiding areas where skin is damaged or tender.  If an AE develops directly after injection, 
management will occur per investigator and clinical care team discretion (i.e. if perceived as allergic reaction, 
will treat with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], steroids, diphenhydramine as dictated per guidelines for anaphylaxis ). Subjects should 
be removed from the trial if life threatening or severe AEs  are deemed to have developed due to first or any 
subsequent dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485806] .

proportion of patients alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation at 28 days . The study will also evaluate the 
incidence of other serious a dverse reactions as the secondary outcome.  This study will use an automated central 
randomization procedure to allocate patients in a 1:1 ratio to each of the two treatment groups. The randomization 
will be stratified based on disease severity : patients who are on 15L or less of oxygen by [CONTACT_21294]  (severity 
group A)  and those requiring more than 15L of oxygen by [CONTACT_485868]  (severity group B) .

7.4 Analysis of AE data  
Analysis of AE data will primarily be descriptive based on DAIDS  coding of events. The proportion of subjects 
experiencing an SAE and the proportion experiencing a Grade 3 or higher will be recorded. AE will be compared 
to published data.  
 
7.5 Endpoints   
7.5.1 Primary Endpoint : 
• Proportion of patients alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation at 28 days.  
 
7.5.2 Secondary Endpoints :

7.6 Statistical  analysis.  
All subjects who received one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analysis. Each primary and 
secondary efficacy outcome measure will be analyzed for the intent -to-treat (ITT) and evaluable population. The 
intent -to-treat principle is that participants will be analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized, 
regardless of whet her they received the randomized study medication. Another analysis population of interest is 
the as -treated population. The as -treated population will consist of onl y participants who were inducted onto study 
medication, even one dose of drug. Safety outcome will be primarily analyzed for the as -treated population. 
Summary statistics for each endpoint will be provided for each relevant comparison group including the results  of 
statistical tests. All subjects who have a result for the baseline and a follow -up and who have received at least one 
dose of study drug will be included for the analysis of efficacy.   
 
After the 14th day of the 20th patient enrolled, the proportion and rate of change of C - reactive protein and ferritin 
levels will be calculated from day [ADDRESS_624148] party and remain blinded to the study investigators.  
   
Data will be summarized as frequency , with percentage for categorical clinical variables , and as mean ± standard 
deviation or median with interquartile range for continuous variables. The difference between  dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485835] -square for categorical measures ( e.g., the primary efficacy endpoint) and 
two-sample t -test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous measures  (e.g., age or biomarkers) . Due to the 
relatively small sample size in the study, the adjusted treatment effect of  dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485836] (e.g., age, sex, race and co -morbidities). Data transformation will be considered 
for the  outcomes with skewed distribution such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (LOS) and ICU LOS. The trajectory of 
each immune biomarker over the follow -up time points will be plott ed to characterize the change of immune 
responses over time, and difference in biomarker (or transformed biomarker to improve normal distribution, if 
necessary) trajectories between the two study arms will be assessed in the mixed effects model.  
Since this is intended to be an early stage, proof of concept study for which the primary goal is to inform future 
trials rather than to perform formal hypothesis testing, no multiplicity adjustment is planned. In addition, machine 
learning methods such as  random forests algorithm will be applied to fully evaluate the treatment effect and 
predictability of  dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485837] -parametrically.

11.0 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SAFETY EVALUATION  
Adverse events will be evaluated and scored using Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of 
Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 2.1  (DAIDS  v2.1). 
(https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/daidsgradingcorrectedv21.pdf  ) 
 
11.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event will be considered any undesirable sign, symptom, medical, or psychological condition even if 
the event is not considered to be related to the investigational drug/intervention. Medical condition/diseases present 
before starting the invest igational drug/intervention will be considered adverse events only if they worsen after 
starting study treatment/intervention.  An adverse event is also any undesirable and unintended effect of research 
occurring in human subjects as a result of the collec tion of identifiable private information under the research.  
Adverse events also include any problems associated with the use of an investigational drug that adversely affects 
the rights, safety or welfare of subjects.  
 
11.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adverse event (AE) is considered a serious adverse event (SAE) if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death,  
• a life -threatening adverse event,  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, 
or  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20967], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and 
may require medical or surgical interven tion to p revent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples 
of suc h medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
11.3 Unexpected Adverse event: (UAE)  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_118631].  An AE will be considered 
unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously 
described for the study inter vention.  
Version date: 2-2-22 26 11.4 Unanticipated Problem (UP)  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems (UPs) (may include a data 
breach) involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that 
meets all of the following crite ria: 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given the research procedures that are described in 
the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved research protocol 
and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research ("possibly related" means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_226592]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_624153] that is NOT approved by [CONTACT_8236]’s IRB prior to its initiation or implementation, OR 
deviation from standard operating procedures, Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), federal, state or local regulations. 
Protocol violations may or may not be under the control of the study team or UVA staff. These protocol violations 
may be major or minor violations.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_624154] and for the following 60 days 
or until un -enrollment from the study, whichever comes sooner. All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution 
even if this extends beyond the study -reporting period. Resolution of an adverse event is defined as the return to 
pre-treatment status or stabilization of the condition with the expectation that it will remain chronic.  
 
11.7 Investigator’s Assessment of Adverse Events  
The determination of seriousness, severity, and causality will be made by [CONTACT_63689] -site investigator who is qualified 
(licensed) to diagnose adverse event information, provide a medical evaluation of adverse events, and classify 
adverse events based upon medi cal judgment. This includes but is not limited to physicians, physician assistants, 
and nurse practitioners.  
 
11.8 Assessment of S everity  
For AEs not included in the protocol -defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to describe 
severity.  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term 
“severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious” . 
 
11.[ADDRESS_624155] their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_167682]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about 
causality will be graded using the c ategories below.  
• Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, 
Version date: 2-2-22 27 occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention administration and cannot be explained by 
[CONTACT_9153].  
 
• Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors 
is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable 
time after administration of the study intervention, is unlik ely to be attributed to concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals.  
 
• Possibly Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred 
within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have 
contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition , other concomitant events).  
• Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose temporal 
relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event 
did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the st udy intervention) and in which other 
drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant treatments).  
 
• Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or evidence 
exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology.  
 
. 
12.0 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
All AEs  meeting DAIDS  grade 3 severity or above including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria 
for SAEs will be captured. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s 
assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_60435] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs  meeting DAIDS  grade [ADDRESS_624156] be documented appropriately r egardless of relationship. All AEs  meeting 
DAIDS  grade 3 severity or above  will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition (including a laboratory abnormality) that is present at the time that the participant is 
screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each 
level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration 
of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
AEs meeting DAIDS  grade [ADDRESS_624157] be recorded into the case report forms and  will be  reported 
per the following guidelines ( Error! Reference source not found. 2). 
 
It is the responsibility of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_485841], identify and report 
protocol deviations. Major protocol deviations must be reported to the UVA IRB -HSR per the following 
guidelines (Table 2 ).  Minor deviations do not need to be reported to the UVA IRB -HSR.  All deviations must be 
addressed in study source documents.

13.0 SAFETY OVERSIGHT  
 
13.1 Independent Medical Monitor  
An independent medical monitor will provide additional safety oversight for this study.  The medical monitor  will 
report to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_291700].  They will review the following:  
• All adverse events  
• Audit results  
• Application of study designed stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/decision rules  
• Whether the study accrual pattern warrants continuation/action  
• Protocol violations  
 
The medical monitor will review the information listed above every two months (or more frequently if needed 
based on rate of accrual or safety issues)  for aggregate review of data.  Issues of immediate concern by [CONTACT_485869]/ IND sponsor (and if appropriate to 
the IRB) and a formal response from the IND -sponsor is requested.   
 
13.[ADDRESS_624159], data and biological specimen 
collection, documentation and completion according to institutional policies.  A safety review and analysis will be 
conducted after the 10th and 40th participant is enrolled.  
Version date: 2-2-[ADDRESS_624160] -approval Monitoring either a) at random or b) requested by a study team 
member or any member of the I RB-HSR.   
The purpose of Post -approval Monitoring audits is to ensure that documentation of clinical research studies is of 
the highest quality, verify protocol adherence, and ensure that all Federal and local rules concerning clinical 
research are being fulfilled.  Post-approval monitoring is done by [CONTACT_485870] (VPR) in accordance with their Standard Operating Procedures. The conduct of an on -site review may 
include but is not limited to:  
• requests for progress reports from investigators,  
• examinations of research records, including signed informed consent documents, protocol modifications, 
and unexpected, serious, and/or related adverse experience reports,  
• contacts with research subjects, or  
• observation of the consent process and/or research procedures. Examples of when observation of the 
consent process could occur are:  
• Full board IRB determines during review of a project that a conflict of interest exists such that the 
informed consent process should be observed by a neutral party;  
• IRB is made aware of a complaint or concern with regard to the informed consent process; or  
• IRB determines as a result of the monitoring process that the consent process is insufficient and 
education/training is required for conduct of consent.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_624161] safety 
is at risk of being compromised:  
1. Death within one hour of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485808]  
2. Occurrence of a life -threatening allergic/hypersensitivity reaction (anaphylaxis), manifested by 
[CONTACT_287177]  
3. One subject with a grade 4 or persistent grade 3 (≥72 hours) associated with study product.  
4. Two subjects with persistent Grade  3 (≥ 72 hours) or higher lab toxicity for the same parameter associated 
with study product.  
5. An overall pattern of symptomatic, clinical, or laboratory events that the medical monitor, ISM, or SMC 
consider associated with study product and that may appear minor in terms of individual events but that 
collectively may represent a serious potential c oncern for safety.  
6. Any other event(s) which is considered to be a serious adverse event in the good clinical judgment of the 
attending physician team.  This will be appropriately documented.  
 
Upon completion of this review and receipt of the advice of the independent medical monitor, the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_485842].  
 
14.[ADDRESS_624162]  
Injection  of study drug  (i.e., patient will not receive any further dupi[INVESTIGATOR_485843] -specified time periods)  will be halted if any of the following manifestations of anaphylaxis develop and 
will not be restarted:  
1. Skin or mucous membrane manifestations: hives, pruritus, flushing, swollen lips, tongue or uvula  
2. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798]: dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, hypoxemia  
Version date: 2-2-22 31 3. A decrease in systolic blood pressure to < 90 mmHg or >30% decrease from baseline or a diastolic drop of 
>30% from baseline.  
4. Tachycardia with an increase in resting heart rate to > 130bpm; or bradycardia <[ADDRESS_624163] (IRB) Approval  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance with federally mandated 
regulations.  The IRB should approve the consent form and protocol.  
 
15.2 Informed Consent  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and 
continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Consent forms will be Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) -approved and the participan t will be asked to read and review the document. A member of the study team 
will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. A verbal explanation 
will be provided in terms suited to the participant’s comprehension  of the purposes, procedures, and potential 
risks of the study and of their rights as research participants.  Participants will have the opportunity to carefully 
review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing.  The participants should have the opportunity 
to discuss the study with their family or surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. If the 
participant is deemed incapable of making their own medical decisions  (i.e., mechanically ventilated, or otherwise 
incapacita ted), a surrogate decision maker or legally authorized representative will be provided with the study 
information as detailed above and may consent to enrollment on behalf of the participant . The participant  (or 
surrogate decision maker ) will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done 
specifically for the study.  
 
Results from procedures completed prior to consent for standard of care purposes may be used for research

APPENDIX:  
NIAID 8 -POINT ORDINAL SCALE FOR CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT   
• The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given 
study day. The scale is as follows: 8) Death; 7) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on invasive mechanical 
ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 6) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on non -
invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 5) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring 
supplemental oxygen; 4) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057],  not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring 
ongoing medical care (COVID -19 related or otherwise); 3) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring 
supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care; 2) Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], 
limitation on activities and/or requirin g home oxygen; 1) Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], no 
limitations on activities.

Study Protocol  
 
Scientific Background  
 
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends a flu vaccination to everyone aged 6+ 
months, with rare exception; almost anyone can benefit from the vaccine, which can reduce 
illnesses, missed work, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and death. Flu shots are particularly important for 
patients at high risk of experiencing se vere outcomes.  
 
During the 2020 -21 and 2021 -22 flu seasons, the study team sent messages to Geisinger 
patients in the top 10% of risk for flu and complications according to an artificial intelligence 
algorithm. Messages that told patients they were at high  risk significantly increased their 
likelihood of getting vaccinated.  
 
Objectives  
 
The present study extend s previous work by [CONTACT_858224]. In previous campaigns , patients 
received messages via all communication modalities patients were eligible for (mailed letter, 
SMS text, and/or patient portal message). In this study, patients were  randomized to receive 
high-risk messages in one or more modalities.  
 
Design   
 
This study  is a randomized controlled trial  with up to  [ADDRESS_1195863] divided into the following modality 
groups  according to the modalities they were eligible for : 
 
A. Letter + Patient portal + SMS (29,505 patients)  
B. Letter + Patient portal (4,980 patients)  
C. Letter only  (4,366 patients)  
D. Letter + SMS  (4,364 patients ) 
E. Patient portal + SMS  (8 patients)  
F. SMS only  (2 patients ) 
 
Note: there were no eligible patients who had Patient portal access only.  
 
Then, each modality group was  randomized across study  arms  the patients were eligible for:   
 
1. Control (no message)  
2. Letter only  
3. Patient portal only  
4. SMS only  
5. Patient portal + SMS  
 6. Letter + Patient portal + SMS  
 
For example,  patients who are eligible to receive a letter and an SMS (modality group D) were 
randomized to Control  (study arm 1 ), Letter only (study arm 2 ), or SMS only (study arm 4 ). 
 
Note: Due to power limitations, we did not test all possible combinations of modalities (e.g., we 
did not include a Letter + SMS study arm).  
 
Power Analysis  
 
Our primary analysis sample includes patients in modality group A, with patients eligible for all 
three modalities . This group includes between 4 ,916 and 4 ,919 patients per arm. This sample 
size allows  80% power to detect an increase in flu vaccination rates from 35% to 37.7% with 
alpha = .05. 
 
Project Status  
 
All intervention messages have been sent. Letters were sent on 9/6/22. Patient portal messages 
and SMS were sent on 9/8/22, to match the date whe n the majority of patients were expected to 
receive the letter  (i.e., 2 days after the letters are  sent) . The primary outcome date was 10/4/22.  
 
As of this writing, t he study team has not yet obtained or analyzed any outcome data from the 
study.  
 
 
Statist ical Analysis Plan  
 
Analysis Exclusion  Criteria  
 
We will remove patients from analysis who received a flu shot prior to 9/ 6/22, the study start 
date, because they could not have been influenced by [CONTACT_369885] a flu shot.  
 
Planned Analyses  
 
Primary Outcome : Flu vaccination within [ADDRESS_1195864] message send date  [ Time 
Frame: [ADDRESS_1195865] messages are sent in the study  ] 
 
The primary analysis sample will be patients in modalit y group A, who are eligible for all 3 
modalities and were randomized across all study arms.  We will address the following four 
questions in this primary analysis sample:  
 
Question 1: Are flu shot rates higher  when a  high-risk flu shot  message is sent in any modalit y 
or combination of modalities  independently  compared to when no message is sent ? 
 
Hypotheses:  
1.a. Flu shot rates will be higher in the Letter only arm than the Control arm  
1.b. Flu shot rates will be higher in the Patient portal only arm than the Control arm  
1.c. Flu shot rates will be higher in the SMS only arm than the Control arm  
1.d. Flu shot rates will be higher in the Patient portal +SMS arm than the Control arm  
1.e. Flu shot rates will be higher in the  Letter + Patient portal + SMS arm than the Control arm  
 
 Analysis 1 ( Confirmatory ): We will run an OLS regression with a categorical independent 
variable coding for study arm with the Control arm coded as baseline.  All 5 hypotheses above 
will be tested wit hin the same regression.  
 
Question 2: Which modality on its own most effectively increases flu shots?  
 
Analysis 2 (Exploratory):  We will run an OLS regression with a categorical independent variable  
coding for study arm , including only patients randomized to be  sent messages in one modality  
(Letter only, Patient portal  only, SMS  only).  We will test for significant pairwise differences  in flu 
vaccination rates  between the study arms  by [CONTACT_858225]’s HSD test. 
 
Question 3:  Are Patient portal and SMS messages better in combination than either modality 
alone?  
 
Analysis 3 (Exploratory):  We will run an OLS regression including patients in the Patient portal 
only, SMS only, and Patient portal + SMS arms, with a categorical independent variable coding 
for study arm. The Patient portal + SMS arm will be coded as baseline , so the individual Patient 
portal and SMS modalities can be compared directly against the combination of the two 
modalities.  
 
Question 4: Is there value to sending a letter in addition to Patient portal and SMS  messages ? 
 
Analysis 4 (Exploratory) : We will run an OLS regression comparing the Patient portal + SMS 
study arm to the Letter + Patient portal + SMS arm , with a categorical independen t variable 
coding for study  arm.  
 
Analyses with additional modality groups  
 
We also will run  the following  additional analyses  on the primary outcome:  
 
Within  modality groups B and D (Letter + Patient portal, Letter + SMS , respectively ), we will run 
Analyses 1 and 2 (comparing active study arms to the control arm, and comparing active study 
arms to one another).  
 
For modality group C  (Letter only), we will run Analysis 1, compar ing the letter arm to control.  
 
Because there are so few patients in modality groups E  (8 patients) and F (2 patients), we will 
not separately analyze data on these groups.  
 
Finally, we will run Analyses 1 and 2 on the entire sample, with all modality groups combined.  
 
 
Sensitivity Analyses and Robustness Checks   
 
Recent work suggests that OLS regressions are appropriate in randomized experiments with 
binary outcome variables such as ours (Gomilla, 2021). However, as a robustness check, we 
will also run  the regressions described above as logistic regressions instead of OLS 
regressions.  
 
Other  Pre-specified Outcomes  
 
 Other Pre -specified Outcomes listed below include flu outcomes (diag nosis, complications) and 
COVID -[ADDRESS_1195866] certainly be increased flu vaccination. Therefore, we will only 
run analyses on Other Pre-specified Outcomes for analyses above where there is a difference 
in flu vaccination.  
 
1. High confidence flu diagnosis  
 
Patient received a flu diagnosis via a positive polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR)/antigen/molecular test (yes/no) during the 2022 -23 flu season (from the first 
message send date through April 30, 2023).  
 
[Time Frame: Up to 8 mon ths] 
 
2. "Likely flu" diagnosis  
 
Received a "high confidence flu" diagnosis (with positive PCR/antigen/molecular test) 
and/or "likely flu" diagnosis (as assessed via International Classification of Disease [ICD] 
codes or Tamiflu administration or positive PCR/antigen/molecular test) (yes/no) during 
the 2022 -23 flu season (from the first message send date through April 30, 2023).  
 
Note that "likely flu" is a superset of the "high confidence flu" diagnoses.  
 
[Time Frame: Up to 8 months]  
 
3. Flu complica tions  
 
Diagnosed with flu -related complications (yes/no) from the first message send date 
through July 31, 2023.  
 
[Time Frame: Up to 11 months]  
 
4. ER visits  
 
Number of ER visits from the first message send date through July 31, 2023.  
 
[Time Frame: Up to 11 m onths]  
 
5. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858223] 31, 2023.  
 
[Time Frame: Up to 11 months]  
 
6. COVID -[ADDRESS_1195867] one COVID -19 vaccination (yes/no) during the 2022 -23 flu season 
(from  the first message send date through April 30, 2023).  
 
[Time Frame: Up to 8 months]  
 
  
Additional Exploratory Analyses  
 
1. Age and gender  
 
While older patients tend to be aware of their increased vulnerability, younger patients 
may be more surprised to learn of their high -risk status. Additionally, our previous work 
suggests that males and females are differently likely to get vaccinated as a  function of 
age, with younger females  more  likely to get vaccinated than males , and older females 
less likely to get vaccinated than older males.  
 
We will therefore run an OLS regression including binned age (18 -24, 35 -44,45 -54, 65+), 
gender,  and their in teraction.   
 
We will also test for an interaction between age, gender and study arm , as people of 
different ages and genders may be differentially receptive to different modalities . 
 
2. Timing of shot  
 
We will run regression models to test whether intervention messages influenced the 
timing (time elapsed since the beginning of the intervention, September 6, 202 2) of flu 
shots.  
 
3. Risk level  
 
As in our studies in the 2020 -21 and 2021 -22 flu seasons, patient s who were in the top 
3% of risk were told they were in the top 3% of risk, while those in the next 7% (i.e., the 
top 4 -10% of risk) were told they were in the top 10% of risk. We will test whether flu 
vaccination rates differ across risk level (top 3%, to p 10%) and whether risk level 
interacts with study arm among patients in modality group A  who have access to all 3 
modalities.

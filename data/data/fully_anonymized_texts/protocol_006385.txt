3. Objectives of current sub- studies : 
 
The broad objective of the studies proposed under this protocol is to use 
transcranial brain stimulation, methods of non- invasive brain stimulation, to 
address questions about the functional anatomy of the human brain. Under this 
protocol These stimulation techniques  offer advantages over measurement 
techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in that they support inferences about causation, as opposed to correlation. The stimulation techniques covered by [CONTACT_219618] (TMS) and transcranial current stimulation (tCS).  Previous  work carried out by [CONTACT_978]’s group under protocol 
2011- 0608 (which the present protocol is intended to replace) indicates that 
TMS interacts in interesting ways with cortical oscillations, and therefore offers a unique way to study the function of these physiological phenomena. The experiments described in this pr otocol fall into several methodological 
categories: simultaneous TMS and fMRI;  repetitive  or single -pulse TMS, which 
is administered alone, simultaneously with EEG, or before fMRI scanning; and tCS, which is administered via a cap that also affords simultaneous EEG recording. In all cases, these studies follow from work that has been carried out by [CONTACT_978]’s group under protocol 2011- 0608.  In all cases, the experiments 
carried out under this protocol will test hypotheses about the neural bases of human perception, attention, and memory. Specific  experiments differ from one 
another in terms of the details of the cognitive task(s) that subjects perform, but 
not in terms of the general TMS and/or physiological measurement (i.e., fMRI or EEG) procedures that are used. For this reason, this protocol will follow the 
09/25/23 
 
 
 4 convention used in 2011- 0608, in which each experiment is described as a “sub-
study” of the protocol.  
Simultaneous TMS and fMRI  studies will begin with an MRI scan in order to 
acquire information about the subject’s brain that is used for guiding the delivery 
of TMS (i.e., for “targeting”). On a different day, fMRI scanning is performed with a TMS coil that has been custom -designed to be compatible with the strong 
magnetic field generated by [CONTACT_168525]. Repetitive TMS  or Single- pulse 
TMS  studies will also begin with an MRI or fMRI scan, followed, on a different 
day, by [CONTACT_219619]- pulse TMS th at is delivered either alone. T he EEG is 
recorded simultaneously , or before fMRI recordings. The initial scan is an MRI 
scan for experiments for which anatomical landmarks will be targeted by [CONTACT_7712]. It is an fMRI scan  of one or more areas of task -related activity are to be targeted 
with repetitive TMS. In such cases, subjects perform the cognitive task both during the initial fMRI scan and the subsequent repetitive TMS session. In some instances, high density EEG data (collected without concurrent TMS) can be recorded simultaneously with fMRI  to obtain a higher temporal resolution, and to 
allow correlations between electrical activity and hemodynamic changes in the brain during tasks.  EEG data can also be useful for pi[INVESTIGATOR_219568] a simultaneous repetitive 
TMS and EEG  study is launched. Finally, tCS will be administered via a wireless 
hybrid EEG/tCS 8 -channel neurostimulator system (model name “StarStim 8”) 
manufactured by [CONTACT_111620]. The system’s electrodes are held in a neoprene headcap that is worn by [CONTACT_423]. The cap is designed to allow for multiple configurations of tCS electrodes and EEG electrodes. This design affords the ability to record EEG signals prior to, during, and/or after st imulation.  
 
3. Rationale :  
 In general, different substudies  will utilize different approaches that rely on the 
various devices described in turn below. None of the substudies are intended to evaluate the safety/effectiveness of the devices. Rather, the devices are intended to be incorporated into this research as a tool to facilitate collection of data appropriate to address the over -arching research hypotheses.  Any studies 
intended to evaluate device safety/effectiveness would be submitted under a 
separate protocol.  
 
3.A. The inferential limits of neuroimaging  
fMRI (as well as all other neurophysiological measurement methods, such 
as electrophysiology and positron emission tomography (PET)) is a correlative measure, and as such, data produced by [CONTACT_219620] “does region X make a necessary contribution to 
function Y?” The only way to address conclusively questions about necessity is to alter the function of an area and to observe whether this perturbation has an effect on the function in question. The repetitive TMS  experiment draws on this 
logic to ask questions of necessity that have arisen from previous neuroimaging studies.

 5 3.B. Transcranial magnetic stimulation  
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique introduced in 1985 
(Barker, Jalinous, & al., 1985)  that uses the principle of electromagnetic 
induction (the “right -hand rule” from high school physics) to get electrical energy 
across the scalp and skull in order to produce changes in neural activity in the 
brain. It involves placing a small coil of wire on the scalp and passing a very 
brief and powerful current through it. This produces a magnetic field that passes unimpeded through the tissues of the head. The magnetic field, in turn, induces a much weaker electrical current in the brain that is capable of activating nerve 
cells in the cerebral cortex. Thus, a TMS pulse produces a powerful but brief magnetic field that passes through the skin, soft tissue, and skull, and induces electrical current in neurons, causing depolarization that then may have behavioral effects. For example, if the hand area of primary motor area of the 
cortex is stimulated, twitches are easily recordable in hand muscles on the contralateral side of the body. TMS can be used to map the representation of body parts in the motor cor tex on an individual basis, and is regularly used in 
neurology to determine central conduction times. (E.g., it is routinely used to track the progression of multiple sclerosis.) Subjectively, magnetic stimulation of motor cortex feels much like a tendon r eflex movement (George, Lisanby, & al., 
1999) . 
Applied as single pulses appropriately delivered in time and space, or 
applied in trains of repetitive stimuli at an appropriate frequency and intensity, TMS can be used to transiently alter the function of a given cortical target. In some applications it can have the effect of momentarily disrupting ongoing neural activity, thereby [CONTACT_40397] a temporary `virtual brain lesion' ( Pascual -
Leone, Walsh et al. 2000) . This makes it possible to study two aspects of the 
contribution of a given cortical region to a specific behavior: `what does it do?' and `when does it do it?' For example, functional imaging studies of early or congenitally blind subjects reveal that their primary visual cortex can be activated by [CONTACT_219621]. However, this activation could be an epi[INVESTIGATOR_219569]. Using TMS, it was shown that disrupting neural activ ity in primary visual 
cortex induced reading errors and distorted the tactile perceptions of congenitally or early blind subjects, thus demonstrating that the visual cortex is actually required for tactile spatial processing by [CONTACT_219622] (Cohen et al., 1997) . There is a large body of work that has used TMS to induce ‘virtual 
lesions’ in order to establish the causal role of a cortical region in a given function, such as primary visual cortex in visual imagery, motor cortex in mental rotation, parietal cortex in attention, neglect and extinction, and frontal cortex in random number generation and working memory (Pascual -Leone et al., 2000; 
Walsh & Cowey, 2000) . Indeed, the PI’s group has published several such 
studies under protocol H -2003- 033 and 2011- 0608 (Feredoes, Tononi et al. 
2006; Postle, Ferrarelli et al. 2006; Feredoes, Tononi et al. 2007; Hamidi, 
Tononi et al. 2008 ; Hamidi, Tononi et al. 2009; Feredoes and Postle 2010) . 
Interestingly, TMS can be used not only to induce virtual brain lesions, 
but also to enhance functioning. There are two classes of examples of this. The 
09/25/[ADDRESS_263920] antidepressant properties (George et al., 1999) . TMS has also been 
applied in schizophrenic subjects (Boroojerdi, Topper, & al., 1999; Cohen et al., 1999; Davey & Puri, 2000; Feinsod, Kreinin, Chistyakov, & Klein, 1998; Geller, Grisaru, Abarbanel, Lemberg, & Belmaker, 1997; Grisaru, Amir, Cohen, & Kaplan, 1998; Grisaru, Chudakov, Yaroslavsky, & Belmaker, 1998; Klein, Kolsky et al., 1999; Klein, Kreinin et al., 1999) . For example, several studies have 
shown that TMS applied to temporal cortex of schizophrenic subjects can reduce the frequency and intensity of auditory hallucinations (Hoffman et al., 1999; Hoffman et al., 2000) . These studies have triggered great interest in the 
potential therapeutic applications of TMS. The second class of “enhancing” effects has been pi[INVESTIGATOR_219570]’s group, with the discovery (via simultaneous TMS -EEG) that repetitive TMS can have differi ng results on task -
related EEG for different subjects, with these effects predicting whether repetitive TMS will have performance- enhancing or performance- impairing 
effects for any given individual ( Hamidi, Slagter et al. 2009; Johnson, Hamidi et 
al. 2010) . More recently, repetitive TMS using a continuous theta burst 
stimulation paradigm ( TBS, similar to sub -study G, which has been completed 
on the 2011- 0608 protocol ) has been shown to induce robust performance-
impairing effects during working memory tasks that can last up to one hour (Morgan et al, 2013; Lee and D’Esposito 2013). It has also been demonstrated that several daily sessions of TBS can have positive clini cal effects in 
pathological disorders such as auditory hallucination (Kindler et al, 2013) a nd 
amblyopia (Clavagnier et al, 2013). These results are exciting, in that they 
suggest that it may be possible to tailor the delivery of repetitive TMS to an individual such that it can be used either therapeutically or diagnostically.  
However, the satisfactory development of such applications requires a 
better understanding of which brain circuits are activated or deactivated as a result of TMS of a given brain area ( Pascual -Leone, Walsh et al. 2000) . For 
example, investigators are only beginning to appreciate that whether repetitive TMS has disruptive or facilitative effects on cognitive task performance can depend on the frequency of repetitive TMS with respect to the subject’s IAF (Klimesch et al, 2003; Luber et al., 2007). In this context, recent work attempting 
to combine TMS with functional neuroimaging is particularly relevant.  
3.C. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional neuroimaging 
Paus et al.  (Paus et al., 1997)  were the first to introduce the combined 
techniques of TMS and functional neuroimaging as a means of mappi[INVESTIGATOR_219571]. They used TMS to stimulate directly a selected cortical area; simultaneously, they measured changes in brain activity, 
indexed by [CONTACT_219623] (CBF). Ilmoniemi et al.  (Ilmoniemi, Virtanen et al. 
1997)  used a similar approach for studying cerebral connectivity in humans 
using a combination of TMS and quantitative EEG. In their first study, Paus et al.  
(Paus et al., 1997)  applied TMS to the left frontal eye fields of human subjects 
and found a significant positive correlation between the number of TMS pulses 
09/25/[ADDRESS_263921] to engage in any specific behavior (Paus, 1999) . Mottaghy et al. (Mottaghy, Krause et al. 2000)  have combined 
TMS and PET in humans to investigate the role of prefrontal cortex in working memory. They found that, while both left and right prefrontal TMS affect performance in a working memory task, right -sided TMS has stronger and 
longer effects. Int erestingly, the PET study showed that left dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex TMS produced reductions in cortical activity only in the directly targeted prefrontal region. By [CONTACT_22242], TMS to the right prefrontal cortex significantly reduced activity in the ri ght prefrontal region, the right fronto-
temporal pole, and bilateral parietal regions. This result indicates that, while the anatomical connectivity of left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is similar, their effective connectivity may be quite diff erent.  
In the first combined simultaneous fMRI/TMS study in humans, Bohning et 
al. showed that 18- second trains of TMS pulses at 1 Hz (18 pulses at 110% of 
motor threshold (MT)) induced 3% -4% increases in the blood oxygenation level -
dependent (BOLD) -fMRI signal in the area of stimulation (Bohning et al., 1999; 
Bohning et al., 1998) . Although that study had an imaging time resolution of 3 
seconds rather than the approximately 60 seconds in the  PET studies, it used a block design stimulation pattern, so the hemodynamic response could not be directly compared with the hemodynamic resp onse observed in cognitive task 
single -event studies. Bohning et al. also demonstrated BOLD -fMRI responses to 
single TMS pulses over human motor cortex in both the ipsilateral motor cortex under the TMS coil and the contralateral motor cortex (Bohning et al., 2000) . 
The associated BOLD signal increase showed the typi[INVESTIGATOR_219572]. More recently, using TBS on the prefrontal cortex before a working memory task performed in the MRI scanner, Lee and D’Esposito showed a decreased of the tuning of extrastriate cortex responses, coinciding 
with decrements in performance. They also found that activity in the homologous prefrontal region in the non- stimulated hemisphere predicted 
performance following disruption (Lee and D’Esposito, 2012). Similarl y, TBS on 
the prefrontal or parietal cortices has been shown to selectively impair working memory for visual -spatial conjunctions (Morgan et al, 2013). The combination of 
TMS and fMRI technique is important because it allows the comparison of different TMS  events using their associated BOLD responses. These studies 
demonstrate the feasibility of combined fMRI/TMS paradigms in humans to probe activity in different brain regions in a systematic manner.  
 
3.D. Combining TMS and EEG  
In TMS, the cerebral cortex is stimulated non -invasively by [CONTACT_57148] a 
brief but strong magnetic pulse (<1 ms, up to 2 Tesla) through a coil applied to the surface of the scalp. The rapid change in magnetic field strength induces a 
09/25/23 
 
 
 8 current flow in the tissue, which results in the activation of underlying neuronal 
populations (Hallet, 2000). The synchronous volley of action potentials thus initiated propagates along the available connection pathways and can produce an evoked response in target cortical regions. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], if the primary motor area of the cortex is stimulated, twitches are recordable in muscles on the other side of the body. Most of the electrophysiological studies on TMS -evoked 
responses have been limited to the measur ement of the motor output. Until 
recently, the effects of TMS on cortices other than motor cortex have been limited solely to the registration of the behavioral effects of the stimulation. The first studies of cortico -cortical responsiveness have used TMS and positron 
emission tomography (PET) in conjunction (Paus et al., 1997; Paus, 1999). This approach offers a good spatial resolution but suffers from a very low temporal resolution with respect to the actual dynamics of the response.  
The combination of TMS and EEG represents a unique tool for investigating 
the effects of repetitive TMS on endogenous oscillations in neuronal populations, a factor that may determine whether the effects of repetitive TMS on behavior are facilitatory or di sruptive in any particular situation. The 
simultaneous use of TMS and EEG, however, is challenging and has required the solution of several technical problems. A major one is the EEG artifact induced by [CONTACT_219624]. During stimulation, the strong magnetic field generated by [CONTACT_219625], i.e. six orders of magnitude larger than the typi[INVESTIGATOR_219573]. The volt -level peak in the leads saturates the input stages of the 
standard EEG a mplifier, requiring several seconds for the circuits to return in the 
linear operating range. To overcome this problem, Virtanen and collaborators 
have designed and built a 60- channel EEG acquisition system that prevents 
large artifacts thanks to gain- control and sample- and-hold circuits that pin the 
amplifier output to a constant level during the pulse (Virtanen et al., 1999). In a first study combining TMS/EEG, the motor cortex of normal volunteers was activated by [CONTACT_219626] 20 
scalp electrodes (Ilmoniemi, et al., 1997). After the pulse, an immediate response over the left sensory -motor area was followed by [CONTACT_219627] 5- 10 ms and to homologous 
regions of the opposite hemisphere within 20 ms. In a more recent study by [CONTACT_219628] (Komssi et al., 2002), TMS -evoked scalp potentials were recorded 
with a high- density array (60 leads) and superimposed on magnetic resonance 
images. The results confirm ed specific ipsi - and contralateral EEG responses 
that varied depending on the precise site of stimulation in the left sensory -motor 
cortex. Using a similar technique, Paus et al. (2001) demonstrated that TMS in the human primary motor cortex induces both local synchronization and evoked waves at distant locations. Interestingly these responses were often detectable 
in single EEG traces. Altogether, these results indicate that the effects of TMS 
on endogenous oscillatory activity can now be studied in the human brain with 
high spatial resolution and on a millisecond time scale by [CONTACT_219629]. As described in his HS -IRB protocol # 2003- 238, [CONTACT_219711]’s group 
acquired the first commercially available version of the system used by [CONTACT_219630] 
09/25/23 
 
 
 9 et al. (2002), which is manufactured and sold by [CONTACT_219631], Ltd. [CONTACT_219712]’s group 
has now acquired an identical system, which is located at the HealthEmotions 
Research Institute (HERI), and the proposed repetitive TMS -EEG experiments 
will be performed with this system . 
 3.E. Combining EEG and fMRI  
 
Simultaneous EEG -fMRI recordings offer the possibility of enriching the 
significance and the interpretation of results from single modality experiments because they provide simultaneous, complementary measures of the same neural processes underway in the s ame brain. The combination of EEG with 
fMRI has been successfully used by [CONTACT_219632] (Scheeringa et al 2009, Michels et al 2010, 2012, Chaudhary et al 2012, White et al 2012). For instance, Sheeringa et al (2009) identified the emergence of functional (MRI) networks related to alpha and theta EEG power increases during working memory maintenance, and showed that theta power during encoding predicted subsequent -memory 
performance and default mode network deactivation (White et al 2012). The coupling of frequency band oscillation and the BOLD signal in task -related areas 
permits the observation of changes with cognitive load, e.g., theta band power increased with load in frontal midline regions (Michels et al 2010). These studies demonstrate the feasibility of combined EEG -fMRI paradigms which provide 
complementary information: fMRI can show changes in blood flow and activity in deeper brain structures while EEG, which is limited to elect rical activity at the 
brain surface, has the best temporal resolution and can measure changes in 
activity much more quickly than fMRI. Note that the EEG system (Brain Products GmBH, [LOCATION_013]) is compatible with the MRI equipment, and has been approved for use in the identical MRI conditions by [CONTACT_219633] -IRB in previous 
protocols from [CONTACT_219711]’s group (H -2004- 0023, H -2007- 0150, H -2013-
0019), and the PI’s previous protocol, 2011- 0608.  
 3.F. tCS  
 3.F.1.   General description of method 
Transcranial current stimulation (tCS) is a non -invasive painless method to 
affect cortical excitability by [CONTACT_219634] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_4942] 1-to-2 mA) applied to the scalp of the subject. tCS can be administered in 
three modes: direct -current stimulation (tDCS); alternating -current stimulation 
(tACS); and random -noise stimulation (tRNS). The literature contains reports of 
thousands of tCS sessions that, when following standard procedures, have been carried out without any injury to skin or underlying tissue (Woods, Antal et al. 
2016) . We will begin with tDCS, because its principles and application are 
easiest  to explain.   
 
3.F.[ADDRESS_263922] -current device. By [CONTACT_218171], a battery is a device that we all 
09/25/[ADDRESS_263923] current. If one connects a fresh 9- volt 
battery to an oscilloscope, one will see the scope jump from 0 volts to 9 volts as 
soon as the battery terminals (the positive (i.e., the cathode) and the negative (i.e., the  anode)) are attached to the two probes. When one of these probes is 
taken off, the circuit is “broken”, and the measured voltage returns to 0 volts. 
The method of  tDCS entails  passing precisely this same kind of constant current  
(albeit at markedly lower intensity)  through a circuit, with the tissue of the brain 
serving as a part of the circuit , typi[INVESTIGATOR_116389] a fairly long period of time (e.g., 20 
min). Importantly, the electrical currents from tDCS ( typi[INVESTIGATOR_897]  1-2mA on the 
scalp) are far too low to directly induce action potentials in cortical neurons. Instead, their effects are on cortical excitability via changing the transmembrane potential of neurons (Iyer et al., 2005; Nitsche & Paulus, 2000; Wagner et al., 2007) . This has the functional effect of modulating the processing carried out by 
[CONTACT_219635]. For example, Nitsche and Paulus (2000) showed that exciteability of primary motor cortex can be modulated by [CONTACT_8622] 40% with tDCS as measured by [CONTACT_219636] (TMS). That is, tDCS  all by [CONTACT_219637]’t generate motor 
evoked potentials, but the amplitude of potentials evoked by a pulse of TMS was higher when TMS was delivered concurrently with tD CS. Similar results have 
been found for changes to TMS -evoked phosphenes when applying tDCS to 
primary visual cortex (Antal, Kincses, Nitsche, & Paulus, 2003) . Importantly, the 
direction of the effect of tDCS –  that is, excitation or suppression of exciteability 
-- depends on the polarity of the stimulation. Cortical excitability tends to be 
reduced in brain tissue nearest the cathode, whereas it is increased i n tissue 
nearest the anode. In typi[INVESTIGATOR_219574], only the anode or the 
cathode of the stimulator is placed over cortex, with the other terminal placed on a part of the body away from the brain. Thus, a tDCS stimulation protocol is 
referred to as being “anodal” or “cathodal”.  
 
3.F.3 . tACS  also involves passing current through the skin, skull, and 
brain with an electrical stimulator. The difference from tDCS, as conveyed in the name, is that tACS entails the delivery of alternating current (rather than the direct current of tDCS). That is, with tACS the current fluctuates sinusoidally , 
such that during one half of each cycle one electrode serves as ano de and the 
other one as cathode, and for the other half of the cycle the pattern reverses. 
Thus, during tACS , the average membrane potential doe s not deviate from its 
baseline level. Unlike tDCS for which the experimental goal is to tACS is  put a 
region of the brain into a prolonged, steady state of increased or decreased exciteability,  tACS is  typi[INVESTIGATOR_219575] (Herrmann 
et al., 2013).  
 
3.F.4 . tRNS  is a variant of tDCS, but for which the DC current is held at any 
given level for a relatively brief period of time (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], on the order of seconds), and is randomly stepped between different levels. The mechanisms by [CONTACT_219638], although the 
principle of stochastic resonance has been proposed. Because we are not 
09/25/23 
 
 
 11 proposing to use tCS in tRNS mode, tRNS will not be considered further in this 
protocol.  
  
4. Potential Adverse Events:  
Please note that each of the entries on this list is “hypothetical”, in the sense 
that the nature of these procedures is such that it is reasonable to be concerned 
that such potential adverse events might be a possibility, and in many cases 
there is a literature exploring such potential events. In the experience of our 
laboratory, however, which extends back to 2007 with EEG (2003- 033), to 2003 
with TMS (2003- 033 and 2011- 0608) , and to 2000 with fMRI (2005- 503 and 
2012- 0652) ), no instance of any of these potential adverse events has occurred.  
 
4.A. TMS  
 
4.A.1. Seizure Induction 
The major safety concern about TMS is the possibility of eliciting a seizure, 
although TMS has rarely been associated with the induction of seizure, even in patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. TMS regimes are subdivided into single- pulse, low 
frequency (<= 1Hz), and high frequency (> 1Hz). Seizure induction, although exceedingly rare, is almost exclusively observed after high- frequency TMS well 
above 1Hz and  with long stimulation trains (Hallett, Wassermann, Pascual -
Leone, & Valls -Sole, 1999; Wassermann, 1998). A few reports have suggested 
TMS -related seizures occurred after single pulses, but all of these were in 
subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_219576] (Classen et al., 1995) . No 
seizures have been reported in normal volunteers receiving single pulse TMS, nor in patients diagnosed with depression or schizophrenia. Seizures have never been reported in subjects receiving 1 Hz TMS. For high frequency studies (i.e., repetitive TMS ), precise stimulation guidelines have been published that 
specify conservative safe stimulation regimes ( Wassermann 1998) . More 
recently, these were reaffirmed by [CONTACT_219639] ( Rossi, 
Hallett et al. 2009) . In the simultaneous fMRI/TMS study, we will exclusively 
employ single- pulse or low -frequency stimulation regimes (less than or equal to 
a single pulse/sec), which are safe with respect to seizure induction. In the repetitive TMS study, the combination of  stimulation parameters (i.e., intensity, 
rate, and duration) will fall within the established safety parameters established at the International Workshop on the Safety of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (Chen and al. 1997; Wassermann 1998) . For repetitive TMS using 
TBS, the risk of seizure is comparable to or less than the other conventional high frequency repetitive TMS protocols (Rossi et al 2009, Oberman et al, 2011).  The bulk of the existing literature on the safety of magnetic brain 
stimulation has focused on single pulse TMS, and no adverse effects have been reported in the numerous studies in normal and clinical populations. It is considered safe with magnetic fields up to 2T, charge density of less than 40 µC/cm
2 per phase, and at repetition rates less than 3 per second (Agnew & 
McCreery, 1987; Gordon et al., 1990). The Magstim magnetic stimulator used in 
09/25/23 
 
 
 12 this protocol has a maximal magnetic field strength of 2T (which diminishes to 
0.[ADDRESS_263924] from the coil), and the maximum repetition rate is 8 per second at full power (30 per second maximum). In reference to single pulse stimulation, the FDA has reported that “this type of transcranial magnetic stimulator does not now present a potential risk to health, safety, or welfare of subjects” (Glass, 1995). Prospective studies designed to systematically evaluate health effects have not found changes in EE G, blood pressure, pulse, serum 
cortisol, serum prolactin, cerebral blood flow, memory or cognition (Hamano, Kaji, Fukuyama, Sadato, & Kimura, 1993; Levy, Amassian, Schmid, & Jungreis, 1991; Wassermann et al., 1996) , (see Wassermann 1998 for review ). Single 
pulse TMS of the motor cortex has been used safely in normal children and infants as young as 2 weeks of age (Muller, Homberg, Coppenrath, & Lenard, 1991; Rossini & Caramia, 1992) . Single pulse TMS is now in routine clinical 
diagnostic use in hundreds of neurophysiological laboratories world- wide.  
As the potential for the use of TMS has grown, repetitive TMS is being 
utilized in neuropsychological experiments more often. The major risk that is associated with repetitive TMS is seizures. Repetitive TMS has been known to elicit seizures in a small num ber of subjects since its introduction in 1989. In all 
cases, the seizures showed immediate slowing after the TMS was shut off and was normalized within [ADDRESS_263925] or his or her family, then repetitive TMS can be safely utilized in 
scientific experiments (Anand and Hotson, 2002; Wasserman, 1998; Rossi et al., 2009, Anderson, 2006). Previous studies producing momentary disruption of cognitive f unctions of the cerebral cortex with repetitive TMS have used 
stimulation parameters well within the safety parameters mentioned above (Pascual -Leone and Hallett, 1994; Mottaghy, et al. 2002). Testing of subjects 
following repetitive TMS stimulation has shown no neuropsychological deficits (Pascual -Leone, et al. 1993).  
 
4.A.2. Headache and mood changes  
The most commonly reported side effect of TMS is headache of muscular 
origin (<5%). Neck pain or scalp pain may also occur. Both typi[INVESTIGATOR_219577] a few hours on the day of stimulation and are usually managed easily with standard analgesics (single doses of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_219578]). 1Hz TMS given to the prefrontal cortex has been reported to improve mood in patients with depression. Mood assessments will be conducted to detect if any mood effects are seen in this study. We will inform subjects about pos sible alterations in 
mood and ask them to report any change immediately.  
 
4.A.3. Magnetic Effects  
Human tissue is virtually nonreactive to magnetic fields (Cadwell, 1991) . 
The peak field strength of the device used in this protocol is <2T and the peak 
09/25/23 
 
 
 13 magnetic field achieved with the 70 mm figure eight or 90mm circular stimulating 
coil is <1.5T. These figures are within federal guidelines for whole body exposure to static magnetic fields during Magnetic Resonance Imaging ((Schaefer, Bourland et al. 2000); [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration, 
Magnetic Resonance Diagnostic Devices Criteria for Significant Risk Investigations, at URL http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/magdev.html
, 1997). 
According to the World Health Organization task group report, there are no adverse effects on human health from short -term exposure to static fields up to 
2T. Exposure to the static field during an MRI is commonly on the order of two hours. For comparison, the maximal cumulative exposure time to magnetic fields in this protocol is less than 0.[ADDRESS_263926] 
the functioning of such implants.  
 
4.A.4. Effects of Induced Electrical Current  
  The maximal induced electrical current from individual TMS pulses is well 
below levels that would lead to neuropathic effects. The maximum induced electrical field and current density per phase are 410V/m and 14 mA/cm
2. These 
values are similar to those used with conventional transcranial and direct cortical electrical stimulation. The maximal charge density per phase is calculated to be ≈ 0.94 µC/cm2 (Jalinous, 1991) . In animal studies, Agnew and McCreery (1987)  
found no signs of neuronal damage with a higher charge per phase of 10µC/cm
[ADDRESS_263927] intracranial electrical stimulation at 50 Hz continuously for 24 hours. The threshold for neuronal injury was a charge density per phase of 40 µC/ cm
2. 
Many histopathological studies in animals have failed to show pathological 
changes in brain after repeated magnetic stimulation (Sgro, Ghatak, Stanton, Emerson, & Blair, 1991) . The safety of repeated pulses may be proportional to 
the degree to which they exceed motor threshold. Matsumiya (1992)  found that 
repeated pulses only produced structural changes when their intensity exceeded 3.[ADDRESS_263928] had histochemical evaluation of surgically removed temporal lobes following rapid- rate TMS up to 16 Hz, 10 sec 
trains, and up to 1260 total stimuli. No pathological changes attributable to TMS were found (Gates, Dhuna, & Pascual -Leone, 1992) . 
 
4.A.5. Sound Exposure  
When producing a magnetic pulse train, the stimulating coil produces a 
series of brief clicks. Animal studies have demonstrated that ear plugs prevent changes in auditory thresholds despi[INVESTIGATOR_219579], repeated, high intensity stimulation with associated sound output of up to 157 dB peak sound- pressure levels (Counter, 1994) . No evidence of hearing loss 
has been found in humans exposed to TMS, despi[INVESTIGATOR_219580] (Pascual- Leone et al., 1992) . Subjects 
09/25/23 
 
 
 14 will either wear earplugs (if no EEG recording) or earphones through which a 
white noise will be played throughout each TMS session. This latter procedure has been successfully applied in previous studies in order to prevent contamination of TMS -evoked EEG  potentials by [CONTACT_219640]’s ‘click’ (Massimini et al 2005, 2010, Rosanova et al 2012, Johnson et al 2012).  
 
  
4.B. fMRI  
 The functional MRI experiments will be conducted using a 3.0 tesla scanner 
(GE Discovery MR750 ) at the Lane Neuroimaging Laboratory (HERI). This fMRI 
system is FDA approved, and its software incorporates the necessary limitations for meeting FDA regulations for safe scanning of patients. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_219581] -IRB approval to use these scanners under HS -IRB 
2012- 0652.  
Patient screening for MRI contraindications : each subject will be required to 
fill out an MRI screening form that will determine whether the subject has any contraindications for MRI. If it is determined that a subject has a specific contraindication, such as metal or electronic implants, he/she will be excluded. 
(Note that this does not apply to subjects in “EEG -only” sessions that do not 
involve MRI or fMRI.)  
Patient comfort. S
 tudy subjects will be monitored both visually and by 
[CONTACT_219641], so that if the need should arise, they will be moved promptly from the magnet. Fans, intercom, cushions, blankets, hearing protection and proper lighting are standard comforts for all patient s inside the magnet.   
 
4.C. EEG  
 
Electroencephalography is a technique commonly used to measure non-
invasively electric brain activity both in research and in the clinic. In this study we intend to employ an EEG amplifier specifically designed for TMS compatibility. The HS -IRB has previously determined, for the PI’s protocol 2003-
238, and more recently, 2011- 0608, that this device can be categorized as “non-
significant risk (NSR)”. This device, produced by [CONTACT_219642]. (Helsinki, Finland), is the first commercially available TMS -compatible EEG amplifier and 
conforms to applicable safety standards for medical devices IEC60601- 1, 
IEC60601-1- 4, IEC60601 -2-26 (certificates by [CONTACT_219643] -IRB protocol 2003- 238, and more recently, 
2011- 0608). The device is based on a standard electroencephalographer but 
features a proprietary circuitry that allows the rejection of the artifact caused by [CONTACT_28911], thus making possible continuous EEG acquisition during TMS. We will also use another EEG system that is compatible with MRI (Brain Products GmBH, BrainAmp MR Plus MRI compatible high density EEG system, [LOCATION_013]). See http://www.brainproducts.com/productdetails.php?id=6). Finally, 
09/25/23 
 
 
 15 for some of the “EEG -only” studies  (see section 8.C. below)  included in the 
protocol, we will use an EEG system that will be housed in the PI’s laboratory at 
the Brogden Psychology building. Although this system is not intended to be used with TMS for this research protocol, t he system is TMS -compatible (Brain 
Products  (brain products .com) actiCHamp Plus 64 -channel  high density EEG 
System , [LOCATION_003]).   
Electroencephalographers are considered non- significant risk devices by 
[CONTACT_8415] [21 CFR 812.2(b). An NSR device is defined as a device that does NOT present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject and is NOT: (1.) an implant; (2.) used in supporting or sustaining human life; (3.) of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease, or otherwise prevents impairment of human health; (4.) otherwise a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subjects. The device s have  
previously been found by [CONTACT_219633] -IRB to meet criteria from 1 to 4 of the FDA 
information sheets, and the procedure to obtain the EEG is regularly carried out by [CONTACT_219644].  
We foresee no risk from EEG recording. However, some individuals with very 
sensitive skin may experience, on rare occasion, a slight irritation at the site of sensor application due to the use of mildly saline conductive gel.  Regarding the 
combination of EEG with fMRI, there are no foreseeable additional risks.  
 
4.D. Positioning System  
 
The EEG system from Nexstim  Ltd. (Helsinki, Finland) also includes a 
frameless positioning device, namely, an optical tracking system that measures the 3D position of markers, and thereby [CONTACT_219645] -time position and 
orientation of the tool with markers. The frameless positioning unit helps to relate the location of a tool outside the subject's head with respect to the subject's structural magnetic resonance images. The product is designed to support and guide the positioning of non- invasive magnetic stimulation coil (not 
included) over predefined anatomical structures in scientific and clinical 
procedures. The optical tracking unit applies harmless infrared light to measure the location of the tools. The unit is manufactured by [CONTACT_219646], Canada, according to the applicable medical safety standards IEC60601- [ADDRESS_263929]/patient, the device is harmless.  
 
4.E. tCS 
 
tCS is delivered via an electrodes  encased in sponge (to prevent direct 
contact [CONTACT_8124]), with the sponge moistened with a conductive medium, typi[INVESTIGATOR_219582]. The tDCS parameters employed under this protocol will always be within the range used in published work with respect to variables that are relevant to safety: current density, current strength (up to 1.75 
09/25/23 
 
 
 16 mA), duration (up to 20 minutes) of treatment, and total charge. We will not 
exceed a current of 1.75 mA; using this current and electrodes with a contact 
[CONTACT_219647] 5x7 cm, we will have a maximum current density at the skin of .05 mA/cm
2, a value well within safety guidelines proposed by [CONTACT_219648]. (2003). 
These currents are also well below those induced by [CONTACT_196959], which is in the range 14 mA/cm
2, and is approved by [CONTACT_219649], including the PI’s 2016- 0500. McCreery et al. (1990) have shown 
that current densities below 25 mA/cm2 do not induce brain tissue damage even 
by [CONTACT_219650]- frequency stimulation over several hours. For comparison, the 
maximum current we propose to apply is 500 times lower than this. Additionally, given the brief duration of the stimulation (up to 20 minutes per session), the delivered amount of charge of .06 C/cm
2 which is 3600 times less than the 
minimum amount of charge associated with tissue damage (216 C/cm2, Yuen et 
al., 1981).  
Stimulation will be conducted by [CONTACT_1716][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a trained 
research assistant. Research assistants conducting the study will always undergo a formal training session in the use of the device by [CONTACT_458]. The training session will include hands -on practice soaking the 
electrode pads in saline solution. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_219583]. 
Experiments involving the administration of tDCS will have the same 
essential design; we will seek evidence of tDCS on behavioral tasks that have minimal risk. To this end, subjects will typi[INVESTIGATOR_219584]; effects of tDCS (either dis ruption or enhancement) will be sought by [CONTACT_219651] (i.e. during vs. post -stimulation). The identical procedure will be used within a single study 
to allow for comparison between conditions,  however the procedure may 
change between studies. For example, in a case of an task that lasts for longer than 15- 20 minutes (the typi[INVESTIGATOR_219585]), the most powerful 
way to measure effects of stimulation is to assess performance during the initial part of the experiment that includes stimulation and compare it to performance in the latter part of the experiment (post -stimulation). By [CONTACT_219652] (i.e., slope difference) for performance during stimulation and post -
stimulatio n as a function of stimulation condition (sham, cathodal, anodal), we 
can effectively measure the effect of different stimulation conditions.  
The experiments will also include a sham stimulation condition. In this 
condition, a 1- 1.[ADDRESS_263930] found that subjects could not distinguish between real and sham treatment (Gan diga et al, 2006).

09/25/[ADDRESS_263935] for them to fine- tune the procedures and 
eventually interpret the results. The second category is individuals affiliated with the lab but not directly working on this study, who may wish to v olunteer in a 
“moonlighting” capacity; that is, to earn money by [CONTACT_7466] a research participant. Explicit policy of the laboratory forbids direct recruitment of status -relationship 
subjects falling under either category. We do not, however, forbid voluntary,  self-
initiated participation. In all cases, regardless of the circumstances of recruitment, participation as a subject will be entirely voluntary. One’s choice with regard to participation in this study will in no way affect one’s grades, evaluation, or position at the University of Wisconsin.  
The subject population for each of the proposed repetitive TMS 
experiments  will consist of 24 young adults.  Our experience with several studies 
performed under protocol H -2003- 033 and 2011 -0608 has been that an initial 
recruitment of 24 subjects is necessary to yield a final N of 16. The reasons for this are varied; in some subjects, abnormalities from the MRI scan precludes further involvement, others meet exclusion criteria, as determined by [CONTACT_219653]; still others simply fail to participate in all stages of the experiment (common attrition). Our goal is to have [ADDRESS_263936] sub-studies. In some cases, we may require more based on relevant 
literature or findings from pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602].  This will permit us to directly compare the 
results from these sub- studies with those of Hamidi et al. (2009), the study from 
the PI’s group that first characterized the individual differences in the effects of repetitive TMS on the EEG and on behavior. B ecause of its precedence, this 
experiment serves as the normative dataset against which the results of all the sub-studies proposed here will be c ompared.  
We have not yet carried out a study with tCS, but our working 
assumption, based on careful reading of the literature and consultation with colleagues, is that the reasoning that we have applied to the design of TMS studies will also apply to tCS studies.  
  
8. Procedures  
8.A. Simultaneous TMS -fMRI stud y (involves sub -studies T.1 and T.2) : 
 
8.A.1. MRI Scan  
In order to determine the stimulation sites, a T1- weighted 3D volumetric 
scan will be obtained from each subject prior to repetitive TMS administration. This will provide a structural map of each subject’s brain. The map will enable a 
09/25/[ADDRESS_263937]’s brain, which will be utilized for 
exact positioning of the TMS coil.  
The procedures of the anatomical MRI will be the same as those 
approved for this PI [INVESTIGATOR_219586] -IRB #2007- 0075 and #2012- 0652. There will be no 
TMS stimulation during this stage of the study.  
 
8.A.2.  TMS Motor Threshold (MT)  
All TMS will be performed using a Magstim Super Rapid2 Magnetic 
stimulator (Magstim Company Limited, Spring Gardens, Whitland, Wales, [LOCATION_006], 
http://www.jalimedical.com/rapid2.pdf) with two special nonferromagnetic TMS coils with a figure -8 design. For simultaneous fMRI/TMS stimulations, two [ADDRESS_263938] the coil to the stimulator console positioned outside the scanner door.  
The delivery of TMS pulses will be controlled by [CONTACT_219654] a 
TTL pulse to trigger the Magstim stimulator via  its external trigger interface. The 
pulses will be delivered 100 msec after an image acquisition, once every 20 sec; see below.  
Single TMS pulses will be used to determine MT in each subject. MT is 
defined as the minimum magnetic flux needed to elicit a threshold EMG response (50 µV in peak to peak amplitude) in a target muscle in [ADDRESS_263939] in the field for determining the intensity of TMS (George et al., 1999) . An authoritative set of safety guidelines for determining 
motor threshold is universally observed by [CONTACT_219655] – “Risk and safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation: 
report and suggested guidelines from the International Workshop on the Safety of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, June 5- 6, 1996” (Wassermann 
1998) . These guidelines specify the combined maximum levels of three 
stimulation parameters – intensity, rate, and duration – that have been 
demonstrated to be safe with human subjects. The guidelines published in (Wassermann 1998) (and subsequently reaffirmed in Rossi et al., 2009) indicate 
that an intensity of maximum stimulator output at a rate of 1 Hz for a duration of 5 sec falls within the safe range. Therefore, our method of beginning the MT determination procedure at 75% of stimulator output, possibly increasing 
intensity to as much as 100% of stimulator output, and delivering single TMS pulses at a rate no higher than .1 Hz (1 every 10 sec), falls within established norms for safe usage of TMS.  
A “safety certified ” member of the research team will be in the room with 
subjects during all TMS procedures. To qualify as safety certified , a member of 
the research team must undergo the following safety training: 1. Adult CPR and First Aid (American Red Cross OR American Heart Association Certified Courses and Instructor; 8 hour training). The CPR course teaches the skills of CPR, relief of  an obstructed airway for victims of all ages, and rescue breathing 
including bag valve mask and barrier device. First aid will include emergency management of common acute medical situations. Both courses are intended for people who provide health care to patients in a wide variety of settings. 
09/25/23 
 
 
 21 Written and skill testing is required. 2. Seizure identification and emergency 
management. (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_219587]; 1.5 hour training.) The course will include education in seizure types and their typi[INVESTIGATOR_219588] (aided by [CONTACT_219656]); emergency management of seizures, and seizure first aid. This training will be completed with staff instructors from the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_219589].  
These training certifications will be documented, and remain current while 
the personnel are involved with any of our studies. A full list of safety certified 
personnel will be a part of the “Key Personnel” list included in each Continuing Review report. Additionally, all additions to this list will be submitted to the HS -
IRB via a Change of Protocol application.  
In the event of a seizure or any other medical emergency during a research 
session, the policy will be the same as the UW Psychiatric Clinic, which operates in the same facility as our laboratory spaces. The policy states that the first response is to call  [ADDRESS_263940] postings of emergency procedures for seizures, as well as well -
marked postings of emergency response numbers (e.g. 911). Additionally, a phone list for key personnel by [CONTACT_219657].  
 
8.A.3
. Scanning  
 MRI studies will be performed on the 3 tesla MRI scanner (GE SIGNA, 
Milwaukee, WI) located in the Lane Family Neuroimaging Laboratory.  
 
8.A.3.a. Positioning of the TMS coil  
TMS coils will be mounted in the MR head coil (either a single coil or one coil on the right side and one on the left) with vitamin E capsules placed at the ends and center of each TMS coil to help locate its position in the structural images. Subjects will wear earplugs, and vision will be unconstrained. While lying on the gantry outside the scanner bore, the subjects will insert their heads into the MR head coil. Several vitamin E tablets will be affixed to the surface of each TMS coil to visualize placement within the MRI scanner. Vitamin E tablets are visible in MR images. Prior to scanning, the positions on the head surface for the initial coil placement will be estimated for the stimulated anatomic regions using the positioning apparatus and procedure described in section 4.D (“4. Potential Adverse Events, D. Positioning System”) and the capsules will be fixed to the head surface. The subject will be positioned in the scanner and a high resolution 3D T1 -weighted SPGR sequence will be run (the TMS device will be off) with a 
1x1x2 mm voxel size (260x260x120 mm FOV with a 256x128x60 acquisition matrix). The acquisition time for the T1- weighted sequence is 3 minutes (using a 
21 msec TR). The locations of the vitamin E tablets will be compared relative to 
09/25/[ADDRESS_263941] 3D T1 -weighted 
image set.  
 
8.A.3.b. Behavioral tasks for current, ongoing sub- studies  
  
4. Sub- study T.1.  TMS -fMRI of the category -level 
representation of the UMI.  
Sub-study T.1. will largely replicate the behavioral task of sub-
study L.1.  (two-item dual -retrocue task) , using simultaneous 
fMRI rather than EEG . fMRI will provide higher spatial 
sensitivity and allow us to additionally use iterative LASSO 
(regularized regression for identifying voxels representing stimulus specific information) to identify parietal areas for TMS targeting. The study will be compr ised of three sessions (a 
training session, TMS/fMR I session targeting IPS, TMS/fMRI 
session targeting LASSO -identified cortex).  
 5.  Sub- study T.2.  
 Sub-study T.2 will largely replicate the behavioral tasks of sub-
study L.2. Training data will be generated from a scanning 
session during which 420 unique directions of motion and 420 unique colors are presented for 4 sec, each flashing at 1 Hz, with 8 stimulus -presentation epochs occurring serially to 
constitute a mini -block, and a 4- sec period at the end of each 
mini- block during which subjects indicate the number of 
speed/luminance changes they detected. During each mini -
block, one randomly determined 4- sec epoch will be blank. (5 
scans * 12 -miniblock/scan * 84 stimuli/mini -block = 420 
stimuli.) The 420 stimuli will be drawn at random, without 
replacement, from a set that is equally spaced around the 
360° range of the stimulus space. The training session will comprise 10 7.2- min scans, with color and motion scans 
alternating during the course of the roughly 1 hr 20 min of EPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_219590]. The ex perimental task will feature two 
conditions: two-stimulus trials and one-stimulus trials . On two 
stimulus trials, t he target s will be a set of moving white dots, or 
a set of stationary colored dots. Subjects will then be cued as 
to whether direction or col or will be probed . Subjects will then 
indicate whether or not a probe stimulus exactly matches the 
09/25/[ADDRESS_263942] the dimension specified by [CONTACT_219658]. The rationale is to quantify (with Forward Encoding 
Model fits) the dynamics of the “reactivation” effect found in sub-study L.1., and to measure TMS -evoked effective 
connectivity within the voxels that contribute to the 
representation of  the UMI (using iterative LASSO as in sub-
study T.1.), and between these voxels  those that may 
maintain a top- down “pointer” to them.  
 
 
 
8.A.3.c. Dosing of TMS  
It has been demonstrated that TMS motor threshold in part depends on the 
distance from the coil to the underlying cortex, suggesting that dosing TMS should take into account the distance from scalp to cortex over the specific area to be stimulated (McConnell et al., 2001; Stokes et al., 2007) . To achieve this, 
the distance from the scalp to the cortical target will be calculated with the frameless stereotaxic system that we use to guide the targeting of TMS (NexStim NBS), and any difference between this distance and the scalp- to-
cortex distanc e for the location used to calculate MT will be corrected with the 
formula described by [CONTACT_219659]. (2007).  
 
8.A.3.d. Experimental design  
 
4.   Sub- study T.1 . 
The design:  3 (stimulus category: direction; face; word) x 2 
(cueing: stay/switch) behavioral task. The IPS and the 
LASSO -identified targets will be in opposite hemispheres, 
and the latter will always be at least [ADDRESS_263943] lip of the IPS. 108 trials per session yield 36 trials during which the critical stimulus category is a UMI.  Single 
pulses of TMS, delivered at 110% of resting motor threshold intensity will be delivered on each trial during either the delay.  
Theref ore, based on Guller et al. (2012),  two scanning 
sessions will be required to generate a sufficient number of trials for each stimulation site.  
 5.   Sub- study T.2.   
The design: The experiment will use the behavioral design of 3 (stimulus category: direction; face; word) x 2 (cueing: stay/switch).  Iterative LASSO; FEM; and TMS -fMRI will be 
09/25/23 
 
 
 24 involved. The rationale is to quantify (with FEM fits) the 
dynamics of the “reactivation” and to measure TMS -evoked 
effective connectivity within the voxels that contribute to the representation of the UMI (Interative LASSO), and between the voxels that maintain a top- down pointer to them.   
 
 
 
8.A.3.e. TMS and fMRI acquisition  
Functional imaging with TMS will be performed using an event related 
experimental design.  The functional MRI pulse sequence is a standard pulse 
sequence that comes installed on the GE Discovery MR750 system, and is 
currently used by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_219591]- going fMRI studies (PI: 
[INVESTIGATOR_219592]; HS -IRB 2012- 0652). EPI [INVESTIGATOR_219593]: TR = 2 seconds, 
TE = 30 msec, 64x64 acquisition matrix, 200x200 mm FOV, sagittal acquisition, 36 slices (4 mm thick with 0.5 mm gap) over the entire brain will be prescribed. 
During the acquisition period, subjects will watch a featureless black screen.  
 Neither single pulse TMS (i.e., less than or equal to 1 Hz), as employed in 
the simultaneous fMRI/TMS study) nor repetitive TMS require IDE approval because of the low risk associated with these techniques, as evidenced by [CONTACT_219660] (e.g., Ashbridge, Walsh, & Cowey, 1997; Beckers & Hombert, 1991; Brandt, Ploner, Meyer, Leistner, & Villringer, 1998; Chen & al., 1997; Duzel, Hufnagel, Helmstaedter, & Elger, 1996; Epstein, 1998; Grafman & Wasserman, 1999; Hufnagel, Claus, Brunhoelzl, & S udhop, 1993; Jahanshahi et 
al., 1998; Mottagh, Gangitano, Sparing, Krause, & Pascual -Leone, 2002; Muri,

8.B. Repetitive TMS and Single Pulse TMS study : involv es sub- studies  
L.3, M.1, M.[ADDRESS_263944]’s brain. The map will enable a 3-dimensional reproduction of each subject’s brain, which will be utilized for exact positioning of the TMS coil.  
The procedures of the anatomical MRI will be the same as those 
approved for this PI [INVESTIGATOR_219594]-IRB 2012- 0652. There will be no TMS 
stimulation during MRI scanning.   
 
 
09/25/23 
 
 
 25 8.B.2. Determining individual alpha frequency (IAF) with EEG . 
Each individual’s EEG cycles at a slightly different rate, the so- called IAF. To 
measure this, a 60- electrode cap will be applied and connected to the TMS -
compatible EEG amplifiers. The subject will then sit comfortably with her/his 
eyes open and closed for six alternating blocks of 30 sec each. (This is the typi[INVESTIGATOR_219595], because alpha is strongest when the subject is resting and not engaged in task performance.) The resultant EEG data will be band -pass filtered to isolate 
components oscillating from 8- [ADDRESS_263945] fourier transform 
(FFT) to determine at what frequency, within this range, the power is greatest. The frequency with the greatest power in the spectrum is the IAF.  
 
8.B.3. TMS Motor Threshold (MT)  
This will be identical to the procedure described for the simultaneous TMS -
fMRI study  under section 8.A.2., above.  
 
8.B.4. Scanning    8.B.4.a. Behavioral Tasks  
 
4. Sub- study M. 1. Comparing the effects of repetitive TMS 
delivered at multiple frequencies (MRI -guided)  on visual 
short -term memory for the direction of motion.   
Briefly, subjects will be asked to remember for short periods of 
time the direction of a group of dots moving (serial 
presentation) . At the end of the delay period, a dial appears, 
and subjects will rotate the dial such that its line matches as 
closely as possible the direction of motion they had to 
remember. During the first session, subjects will be scanned in 
the fMRI while performing the task in order to identify the 
targets for subsequent rTMS. On a second day, behavioral 
tasks will be performed while recording EEG. Delay period 
rTMS  will occur on two -thirds of the trials (10Hz, p=.5; or 20Hz, 
p=.5) with the remaining trials having no TMS. Stimulation  will 
be applied on the middle temporal cortex (MT+) and 
intraparietal sulcus (IPS) on separate days . 10Hz is the 
frequency at which rTMS has been delivered on all of our 
previous studies and it is also the natural frequency of the 
posterior areas (including MT+) whereas 20Hz is the natural 
frequency of parietal areas (including IPS) as reported by 
[CONTACT_219661] M, Casali A, Bellina V, Resta F, Mariotti M,

corticothalamic circuits. J Neurosci.17;29(24):7679- 85 
 
5. Sub- study M.2 . Comparing the effects of repetitive TMS 
delivered at multiple frequencies (MRI -guided) on visual 
09/25/23 
 
 
 26 short term memory across stimulus dimensions.   
This study will replicate sub- study M.1. with the exception that 
subjects will be remembering both directions of motion and 
colors. Depending on which item is tested, the probe will either 
be identical to sub- study M.1. (motion) otherwise the dial will be 
a color  wheel that subjects adjust to match the cued target.  
 
 
 
 
8.B.4.b . Positioning of the TMS coil  
 
TMS will be performed in a clinic setting at the Wisconsin Psychiatric Institute 
and Clinic (WisPIC). For each subject, a digital 3D reconstruction of the 
subject’s brain will be produced from the MRI data. After the subject is comfortably seated in a chair, s/he is fitted with a headband that contains fiducial markers that can be detected with an infrared camera. After these markers are calibrated with the 3D reconstruction of the brain scan, this 3D image moves on a computer screen, in real time, in precisely the same way as the subject’s head (and, therefore, as her/his brain). The TMS coil is also detected by [CONTACT_219662]. W hen it is positioned over the subject’s skull, a 
representation of the TMS coil and its zone of maximal stimulation can be viewed in relation to the brain. In this way, precise positioning of the TMS coil with respect to the brain can be achieved, and we will target specifically the regions described abo ve. The TMS coil will be held by [CONTACT_219663]. Note that this is the apparatus and procedure described in Section 4. D. (“4. Potential Adverse Events, D. Positioning System”).  
 
 8.B.4. c. Dosing of TMS  
 
In several previous studies performed under protocol s H-2003- 033 and 
2011- 0608, the PI’s group has delivered trains of repetitive TMS at a rate of 10 
Hz, with stimulator intensity 10 % above- motor threshold ( Feredoes, Tononi et 
al. 2006; Postle, Ferrarelli et al. 2006; Feredoes, Tononi et al. 2007; Hamidi, 
Tononi et al. 2008 ; Hamidi, Tononi et al. 2009; Feredoes and Postle 2010) . 
These stimulation parameters, together with a 5 sec inter -trial interval, fell within 
the safety guidelines for repetitive TMS (Wasserman, 1998; Rossi et al., 2009). Although we will stick to these parameters for some of the proposed studies, recent results obtained with these parameters (Hamidi et al., 2009) have created scientific reasons to vary these stimulation parameters systematically, as described above in Sections 8.B.4.a.1 and 8.B.4.a.2.  Specifically, some of the 
proposed studies entail repetitive TMS at the frequency of sustained delay -
period oscillatory power, which ranges across subjects from 10 Hz through 20 Hz, or at the natural frequency of the superior parietal lobule, which ranges  
across subjects from 18 Hz – 24 Hz. Following the published repetitive TMS 
09/25/23 
 
 
 27 safety guidelines of Wasserman (1998), which were recently confirmed in a 10-
year follow -up by [CONTACT_219639] (Rossi et al., 2009), 
repetitive TMS trains of between 10 Hz and 20 Hz, delivered at 110% of motor threshold, are considered safe if delivered for a duration not exceeding 1.2 sec (i.e., a total ≤ 24 pulses), and repetitive TMS trains of up to 25 Hz, delivered at 110% of motor threshold, are considered safe if delivered for a duration not exceeding 0.7 sec (i.e., a total ≤ 17 puls es). Note that these parameters also 
include an inter -train interval ≥ 5 sec. Thus, proposed studies featuring repetitive 
TMS delivered at a frequency greater than 10 Hz but ≤ 20 Hz will feature 1.2 sec-long stimulation trains, and studies featuring repetitive TMS delivered at a 
frequency of between 20 and 25 Hz will feature 0.7 sec -long stimulation trains. 
Another procedure that we would like to implement in our research skill is TBS  
which is another form of repetitive TMS that has been recently shown to be suitable for fMRI studies.  
 
1. Sub- study L.3 
Single -pulse TMS will be delivered at 90- 110 V/m during the 
delay period between 2 and 3 seconds after the cue on each 
TMS present trial. Over the course of a 2 hour session, 
participants will receive a total of 540 pulses.  
 
2. Sub- study M. 1 
Repetitive TMS will be delivered in 500 m sec-long trains of 10 
Hz (5 pulses/train) and  20Hz  (10 pulses/train)  at 90% of 
phosphene threshold, at the beginning of the delay period. 
There will be a minimum of 9- second interval between all 
trains . 
3. Sub- study M. 2 
Repetitive TMS will be delivered in 500 msec -long trains of 10 
Hz (5 pulses/train) and 20Hz (10 pulses/train) at 90% of 
phosphene threshold, at the beginning of the delay period. 
There will be a minimum of 9- second interval between all 
trains.  
 
 
 
8.B.4.d. Experimental Design  
 
 
 
1. Sub- study M. 1. 
Repetitive TMS trains at 10 Hz and 20Hz will be applied for 500 
msec and delivered at 90% of phosphene threshold intensity 
during the delay period to MT+ and to IPS in separate 
sessions. There will be a 9 second interval between all trains . 
09/25/23 
 
 
 28 Subjects will perform eighteen blocks (consisting of 34 trials) 
per stimulation site. (Total of 612 trials per stimulation site with 
408 featuring repetitive TMS, 1/2 of these at 10Hz and 1/2 of  
these at 20Hz). The number of pulses that could be delivered 
on one stimulation site is maximum 3,060. 
 
2. Sub- study M.2.  
The design will replicate M.1. with the exception that subjects 
will be asked to remember both directions of motion and colors.  
    
  
TMS will be performed with a Magstim Super Rapid
2 Magnetic stimulator 
(Magstim  Company Limited, Spring Gardens, Whitland, Wales, [LOCATION_006])  equipped 
with a circular and a figure -[ADDRESS_263946]. This program can be interrupted by [CONTACT_219664]. Neither single pulse TMS nor repetitive TMS (as proposed for the require IDE approval because of the low risk associated with these techniques, as evidenced by [CONTACT_219665] (e.g., 
Ashbridge et al., 1997; Beckers & Hombert, 1991; Brandt et al., 1998; Chen & al., 1997; Duzel et al., 1996; Epstein, 1998; Grafman & Wasserman, 1999; Hufnagel et al., 1993; Jahanshahi et al., 1998; Mottaghy et al., 2002; Muri et al., 1996; Oyachi & Ohtsuka, 1995; Pascual -Leone et al., 1999; Pascual -Leone et 
al., 2000; Ro et al., 1998; Walsh & Cowey, 2000; Wassermann, 1998) . 
 
8.C. EEG -only: includes sub- studies O, U, V, Y, Z, AA, AB, AC, AD, 
AE, & AF  
 
A separate set of EEG  only experiments will build upon the questions and 
findings from previous sub- studies approved under this protocol  and others from 
the PI (2012- 0652) , using new behavioral tasks that better assess questions 
answered using electroencephalography without fMRI or TMS. The procedure for these sub studies will be similar to those of Repetitive TMS studies (8.B.) except that there will be no initial fMRI session, and once subjects are fitted with an EEG cap, they will perform the behavioral tasks without the use  of TMS 
procedures.  
 8.C.1 .A. Behavioral tasks  
 
1. Sub- study O:  Comparing biased- competition versus 
passive- decay models with EEG  
This sub -study will replicate the procedure of approved sub-
study J.2. the PIs fMRI IRB (2012- 0652) using the same 
09/25/23 
 
 
 29 behavioral task. The experimental task will begin with the 
presentation of a search target, drawn from the set of three stimulus types. After a delay, a “search array” comprising the target plus a second stimulus is presented. Both stimuli in the search array flicker, and each changes  state a randomly 
determined 0- 3 times during each trial. Subjects count the 
number of changes in the target image, ignoring changes in the nontarget image, and, at the offset of the array, report the number of target changes. MVPA will be performed on EEG 
data in an attempt to classify neural activity associated with the three stimulus categories and evaluate biased competition as a mechanism for changes in the decode- ability of these patterns . 
 
2. Sub- study U:  Pre and post -training session EEG 
recordings  
This sub -study performs pre and post -training sessions where 
subjects perform a number of tasks designed to measure various aspects of working memory and attention. The sub-study compares performance on these tasks after two different sets of training regi mens to the performance before training.  
Electroencephalography (EEG) is used to record  for the 
entirety of these sessions using the EGI Geodesic GES System [ADDRESS_263947] approximately 3.75 hours, with 2.25 hours of that 
spent engaging in the tasks and breaks given approximately every 9 minutes. Each session consists of seven different tasks testing differing aspects of working memory and attention. The 
tasks descriptions are below.   #1. Digit Span: On each trial, a variable number of digits are presented one after another in the center of the screen. The subject’s job is to remember all the digits in the order they were presented. Between [ADDRESS_263948]  is prompted to write down the digits he/she sees in 
order on the sheet, with an emphasis on accuracy.  
 #2. N -Back: On each trial, the subject hears a letter and sees a 
bluesquare somewhere on the screen. On the one- back trials, 
the subject presses the “A” key only if the spoken letter is the same as the one on the previous trial. Additionally, the subject 
presses the “L” key only if the square is in the same position as 
on the previous trial.  The subject only has a few seconds to 
respond, and the emphasis is on accuracy. After a variable number of trials, the subject is asked to report whether the 
09/25/23 
 
 
 30 letter and/or square are the same as those presented two trials 
back (2 -back).  This applies for 3- back trials, 4 -back trials etc.   
 #3. ANT: At the beginning of each trial, the subject sees a cross in the center of the screen.  The subject focuses on the cross. After a period of time, either a single blue arrow head or a group of blue arrow heads appear either above or below the 
cross. In the single arrow condition, the subject hits the left arrow key as quickly as possible if the arrow is pointing to the left, and the subject hits the right arrow key as quickly as possible if the arrow is pointing to the right.  In the group arrow condition, the subject hits the left arrow key as quickly as possible if the center arrow is pointing to the left. The subject hits the right arrow key as quickly as possible if the center arrow key is pointing to the right. In addition to the arrows, there ar e either one or two blue asterisks that appear near the 
cross right before the onset of the arrows.  In the single asterisk condition, the arrow target eventually appears in the same position as the asterisk.  In the double asterisk condition, the arrow ta rget appears either above or below the cross. The cues 
help the subject to respond more quickly.  
 #4. PI[CONTACT_116544]: At the beginning of each trial, there is a white cross in the center of the screen. Four circles appear in the corners of the screen. Each circle will contain a number of moving dots.  
The focus is only on the red/blue circles.  After a brief dur ation, 
the four circles disappear, and a single white circle with moving dots will appear in the center of the screen.  If the dots in the white circle are moving in the same direction as the dots in one of the target circles (red/blue), the subject should hit the “1” 
key. If the white dots are moving in a different direction than the ones from the target, the subject should hit the “2” key. There are six blocks, each lasting about 8 minutes.  
 #5. OSPAN: At the beginning of each trial, there is a math problem on the screen. The task is to indicate whether or not the answer to the math problem is correct. If the answer is correct, the subject should hit the left arrow key.  If the answer is incorrect, the subject should hit the right arrow key. Shortly after, the math problem is replaced with a letter. The subject should remember this letter. The subject receives anywhere 
between [ADDRESS_263949] write down all of the letters that 
he/she recalls seeing in the previous trials in the order they were presented.  
09/25/23 
 
 
 31  
#6. Filtering: On each trial, the subject sees a display of colored lines. The display appears, disappears, and reappears. The task is to determine whether the red lines changed position from the first to the second display, focusing only on the red lines.   A change in the red line position is indicated by [CONTACT_219666]. No change in the red line position is indicated by [CONTACT_219667].  
 #7. RAPM Pre (post version for post -test): A series of patterns  
on the screen appear, but a pi[INVESTIGATOR_219596]. The subject’s task is to select the pi[INVESTIGATOR_219597]/she thinks best fits the pattern by [CONTACT_219668]. The subject has 20 minutes to complete as many patterns as possible.   
3. Sub- study V: ( FREQMOD)  Speed of alpha oscillations and 
temporal resolution of perception measured with EEG  
This sub -study addresses the question of whether there is a 
correlation between the speed of individuals’ alpha oscillations (measured with EEG) and the temporal resolution of their perception. EEG data is recorded from a 60- channel cap 
connected to an Exi mia 60- channel amplifier (Nextim, Helsinki, 
Finland) while subjects complete a two- flash fusion task.  The task 
aims to determine the minimum time between two successive light flashes needed to perceive two, as opposed to one, distinct 
flashes.  Subjects are seated [ADDRESS_263950] from the monitor with a 100 Hz screen- refresh rate.  Each trial begins with a central 
fixation cross (.98 degrees of visual angle) that reduces luminance to prepare subjects for the stimuli.  The duration of the warning period is drawn from a uniform distribution between [ADDRESS_263951]. The experiment takes 1.5 hours in total.  
 4. Sub- study Y: (2Back EEG) Tracking unattended memory 
representation in a 2 -back task with EEG  
This sub -study addresses the question of whether neural activity 
(measured with EEG) can be decoded to reveal the orientation of 
09/25/23 
 
 
 32 objects that were briefly seen moments ago. EEG data is recorded 
from a 60- channel cap connected to an Eximia 60- channel 
amplifier (Nextim, Helsinki, Finland) while subjects complete a two -
back orientation recognition task.  Each block consists of serial 
presentation of orientation grating stimuli (set of 6 possible 
orientations), with subjects indicating at each presented stimulus, starting at number 3, whether it matches that shown two stimuli ago. The goal will be to decode, using multivariate pattern vox el 
analysis (MVPA) and inverted encoding models (IEM), the neural activity associated with each of the 6 orientations, and to identify differences in activation when the memory report is accurate versus inaccurate. The experiment will take 2 hours in total .  
 5. Sub- study Z: (SPACEORDEREEG)  
The aim of the study is to investigate the oscillatory and representational dynamics of contextual information in visual working memory.  EEG data is recorded from a 60- channel cap 
connected to an Eximia 60- channel amplifier (Nextim, Helsinki, 
Finland) while subjects complete a working memory orientation recognition task.  Each block consists of serial presentation of 
orientation grating stimuli with subjects indicating their memory for those stimuli. The experiment will take 3- 4 hours in total.   
 6. Sub- study AA: (SPACETIME EEG)  
The aim of the study is to investigate how spatial and temporal 
expectation of forthcoming visual stimuli modulate both behaviour and brain oscillations.  EEG data is recorded from a 60- channel 
cap connected to an Eximia 60- channel amplifier (Nextim, Helsinki, 
Finland) while subjects complete a working memory orientation recognition task.  Each block consists of serial presentation of 
orientation grating stimuli with subjects indicating their memory for those stimuli. The experiment will take 3- 4 hours in tot al.  
 7. Sub- study AB: (LTM EEG)  
The aim of the study is to shed light on the working memory -long 
term memory transfer mechanisms.  EEG data is recorded from a 
60-channel cap connected to an Eximia 60- channel amplifier 
(Nextim, Helsinki, Finland) while subjects complete a working memory orientation recognition task.  Each block consists of 
presentation of dot -motion  stimuli with subjects indicating their 
memory for those stimuli. The EEG portion of the experiment will 
take 6- 8 hours in total , split over two sessions, with an additional 
1-hour behavioral session.   
 
8. Sub- study AC: (DACOM)  
09/25/23 
 
 
 33 The purpose of the study is to 1) investigate the trial -to-trial 
adaptive control of working memory in handling distraction from 
the discrimination stimuli, and 2) examine the neural correlates of the control processes in working memory, specifically testi ng the 
temporal and spatial characteristics of the control signal.  EEG data 
are recorded from a Brain Products (brainproducts.com) actiCHamp Plus [ADDRESS_263952] will appear and participants will perform a psychophysical discrimination task on its orientation and report whether it is clockwise or counterclockwise compared to a ver tical 
orientation. The experiment will take 3- 4 hours in total.  
 9. Sub- study AD: (MFE) 
The purpose of the study is to 1) find a neural marker of binding multiple features into VWM, and 2) investigate whether position 
information is an  especially important feature for VWM binding.  
EEG data are recorded from a Brain Products (brainproducts.com) 
actiCHamp Plus 64 -channel high density EEG System while 
subjects complete a typi[INVESTIGATOR_219598] (VWM ) task. 
Before memory array display, at the beginning of each trial, an arrow will be presented for 200 msec as a cue to notice either the left or right side of the memory array to be memorized. Four colored bars will be presented as the memory array then. The session will be separated into three block conditions to require participants to remember either Color and Orientation, Color and Position, or only Color in each block, respectively. At the end of each trial, one o f the required features will be tested. All three 
blocks will be conducted with a counterbalanced order across participants.  The experiment will take 3- 4 hours in total.  
 10. Sub -study AE: (HAMS)  
The purpose of this study  is to find the neural mechanism whereby 
[CONTACT_219669].  EEG 
data are recorded from a Brain Products (brainproducts.com) actiCHamp Plus 64 -channel high density EEG System while 
subjects complete a typi[INVESTIGATOR_219598] (VWM ) task.
 
The participant will be required to make memory -based judgments 
of images in two tasks. The first task will include the presentation of three to- be-remembered oriented line patches with a memory 
judgment a bout one of the memory items after a brief delay period. 
09/25/23 
 
 
 34 Patches may be presented sequentially or simultaneously, at the 
same location on the screen or at different locations across two conditions, and cued to be retained or dropped after a short delay in order to report the remembered orientation by [CONTACT_219670] a 180-
degree dial. The second task will include the presentation of one patch and subjects will be asked to report the orientation of it after a delay.  The experiment will take 4 hours total.  
 11. Sub -study AF: (P[INVESTIGATOR_51381]I) 
The purpose of the study is to investigate the ways in which prioritization of information in working memory protects its representation from interference to support more accurate behavior based on those memories. This study will test this directly both at  the behavioral and neural levels. EEG data are recorded 
from a Brain Products (brainproducts.com) actiCHamp Plus 64-
channel high density EEG System while subjects complete a typi[INVESTIGATOR_219598] (VWM ) task.
 The participant will be 
required to mak e memory -based judgments of images in two 
tasks. The first task will be a double- serial retrocue (DSR) task 
much like those typi[INVESTIGATOR_219599]'s studies. The DSR task will involve the sequential presentation of two oriented patches. After a bri ef delay, a retrocue in the form of a digit ('1' or 
'2') will indicate which memory of the two oriented patches will be 
tested. After a longer delay of 4s, a test stimulus ('recall') will 
appear on the screen, which includes a line whose orientation can be adjusted by a trackball mouse to match the remembered 
orientation. To remind participants which item they are to recall, 
the retrocue digit will also re- appear on the recall display. After the 
participant makes their adjustment response, feedback will be 
provided by [CONTACT_219671], yellow, or red, corresponding to small, mid, or large errors, respectively. Then, a second retrocue will appear that may be the 
same digit (50% of trials) or the other digit (50% of tr ials), followed 
by a shorter delay of 1s, and a second recall interval and feedback 
response. The second task will be comprised of 'neutral cue' trials that will serve as a control condition to understand the effects on 
performance of the meaningful retroc ues. This task will be similar 
to the first portion of the DSR task with the sequential presentation 
of two oriented patches followed by a delay period. During the 
retrocue period, a '0' digit will appear to equate the task dynamics with the DSR task, but to be uninformative about which item will be 
tested. After the longer delay of 4s, the recall display will appear 
with a '1' or '2' digit indicating which item will be tested and the 
participant will make their adjustment as in the DSR task and 
receive feedback. At this point, the trial will end.  The experiment 
will take 4 hours total.

 8.D. tCS: includes sub- studies W and X  
 
The sub- studies employing tCS are designed to address questions raised by [CONTACT_219672], for example, Samaha et al., in press) and sub- study V, published as (Samaha and Postle, 2015).  
 8.D.1.A. Behavioral tasks  
 
1. Sub- study W : tACS study of the s peed of alpha 
oscillations and temporal resolution of perception measured with EEG  
This sub -study will replicate the procedure of approved sub-
study V, using the same behavioral task. Subjects are seated 
[ADDRESS_263953] from the monitor with a 100 Hz screen- refresh 
rate.  Each trial begins with a central fixation cross (.98 degrees of visual angle) that reduces luminance to prepare subjects for the stimuli.  The duration of the warning perio d is drawn from a 
uniform distribution between [ADDRESS_263954]. The experiment takes 1.5 hours in total.  
 
2. Sub- study X : tCS of 2 -choice orientation discrimination 
with confidence ratings.  
On each trial a black and white grating stimulus will appear at the center of a computer screen for a short period (33 ms). The stimulus will either be tilted to the left or to the right of vertical by [ADDRESS_263955]’s  task is to decide whether the 
grating was tilted to the left or right. Following this response, they will rate their confidence in their decision on a 1- 4 scale 
using the computer keys. The experimental manipulation is 
whether t CS or sham tCS  is applied over occipi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -parietal 
cortex . Subjects  will complete the task under both conditions, 
the order of which will be counter balanced. EEG will also be 
recorded from 6 occipi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -parietal electrode sites. Prior to this 
main task a short (3 min) staircasing procedure will be run in 
09/25/[ADDRESS_263956] of the grating stimulus to achieve 
task performance of ~75% accuracy. Total task time will be 1 1/2 hrs, which, with an estimated 30 minutes of setup, will result in ~2 Hrs of total experiment time.

10. Study Evaluations .  
 
10.A.  Pre-Study Screening:  
 
The Informed Consent will be reviewed and signed prior to any study 
procedures being completed. Individuals currently taking a psychoactive medication, will not be allowed to enter this study. The following procedures will be completed: MRI Screening Form and Health Screening Form.  Information 
obtained from those who fail to pass the screening will not be retained. Following these assessments, the subject will be scheduled for the experiment 
at HERI. A technician will conduct a follow -up interview to inquire about the 
subjects’ comments and concerns about the experimental procedure.  
 
 10.B.  Efficacy Evaluations :  
 N/A 
 
10.C.  Safety Evaluations:  
 
09/25/23 
 
 
 38 10.C.1. Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_219677], vital 
sign measurements and lab evaluations. HERI is staffed by [CONTACT_219678] (EEG), respi[INVESTIGATOR_72789] (Ambu bag, oxygen tank and mask), and management of seizure (intravenous line materials, injectable anticonvulsant medication). A phys ician on 
call will be available at all times during testing. To prevent the risk of metallic objects being propelled by [CONTACT_219679], metallic objects will be removed from the close 
vicinity of the device (< 10cm), as recommended by [CONTACT_3455]. This will include removing jewelry. Watches and magnetic sensitive devices (credit cards) will be kept at least 50 cm awa y from the coil.  
The safety procedures in this protocol were drawn from the IFCN committee recommendations and studies of the safety of TMS (Wassermann 1998)  and from a study of “tolerability and safety of 
high daily doses of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in healthy young men” (Anderson, 2006) . Subjects will be screened 
for any history of seizure in themselves or family members (including febrile seizure), medications or conditions known to decrease seizure threshold (ETOH), implanted metallic objects or devices (e.g. pacemaker, TENS, cochlear implant, surgical clips), and any neurological or medical conditions.  
 10.C.2. Data Safety and Monitoring Plan  
• Seizure induction is the type of adverse event that is 
explicitly captured under the monitoring plan; however,  
unanticipated adverse events that pose a serious physical risk to subjects are also included.  
Each safety certified member of the study team 
is responsible for alerting the PI (Postle) as soon as possible after the 
occurrence of a serious  
• Adverse event.  
• With regard to the “frequency of assessments/analysis of 
data or events captured by [CONTACT_219680],” this procedure is 
in place for each experimental session.  
• The time frame for reporting an adverse event is as soon as 
possible once the safety and care of the subject has been addressed.  
• The stop rule will be triggered by a single incidence of a 
serious adverse event.  
• Unanticipated problems or adverse events will be reported 
to the HS -IRB per the IRB’s posted reporting policy.  
• Adherence to the IRB -approved protocol is monitored 
weekly by [CONTACT_978], via 1 -on-1 meetings that he holds with each 
safety certified member of the study team who is actively running a sub-study.

 39 10.D. Imaging: Adventitious Findings  
 
A radiologist reviews all scans. Scans from all subjects are 
reviewed, although, if a study involves a series of scans within a 6-month period, only the [ADDRESS_263957] overseeing the reading of scans for MRI studies. Clinically significant results will be reported to subjects no later than 37 calendar days from the day the imaging was completed ([ADDRESS_263958] the research participant). Subjects are given the option to have their physician informed of clinically significant findings as well.

 51 Appendix A: Seizure Identification and Emergency Management  
 
Seizure Identification  
There are many different types of seizures. People may experience just one 
type or more than one. The kind of seizure a person has depends on which part and how much of the brain is affected by [CONTACT_219690]. Experts divide seizures into generalized seizures (absence, atonic, tonic -clonic, myoclonic), partial (simple and complex) seizures, 
nonepi[INVESTIGATOR_219604].  
  
Generalized – Generalized seizures affect both cerebral hemispheres from 
the beginning of the seizure. They produce loss of consciousness, either briefly or for a longer period of time, and are sub- categorized into several major types: 
generalized tonic clonic; myoclonic; absence; and atonic.  
  
Partial – In partial seizures the electrical disturbance is limited to a specific 
area of one cerebral hemisphere. Partial seizures are subdivided into simple partial seizures (in which consciousness is retained); and complex partial seizures (in which consciousness is impaired or lost). Partial seizures may spread to cause a generalized seizure, in which case the classification category is partial seizures secondarily generalized.  
  Partial seizures are the most common type of seizure experienced by 
[CONTACT_219691][INVESTIGATOR_002]. Virtually any movement, sensory, or emotional symptom can occur as part of a partial seizure, including complex visual or auditory hallucinations.  
• Simple - People who have simple partial seizures do not lose 
consciousness during the seizure. However, some people, although fully aware of what's going on, find they can't speak or move until the seizure is over. They remain awake and aware throughout. Sometimes they can talk quite normally to other people during the seizure. And they can usually remember exactly what happened to them while it was going on. However, simple partial seizures can affect movement, emotion, sensations, and feelings in unusual and sometimes even frightening ways. 
• Complex - Complex partial seizures affect a larger area of the brain than 
simple partial seizures and they  affect consciousness. During a complex 
partial seizure, a person cannot interact normally with other people, is not in control of his or her movements, speech or actions; cannot control what he or she is  doing; and does not remember afterwards what 
happened during the seizure.   
• Non-epi[INVESTIGATOR_23935]  – Non-epi[INVESTIGATOR_219605] a 
person's behavior and often look like epi[INVESTIGATOR_122174]. The person having non- epi[INVESTIGATOR_219606]. The difference in these two kinds of epi[INVESTIGATOR_219607], even by 
09/25/[ADDRESS_263962] aid should be provided in order to assure safety for all individuals involved and nearby.  
• Keep calm and reassure onlookers.  
• Don't hold the person down or try to stop his movements.  
• Time the seizure with your watch.  
• Clear the area around the person of anything hard or sharp.  
• Loosen ties or anything around the neck that may make breathing difficult.  
• Put something flat and soft, like a folded jacket, under the head.  
• Turn him or her gently onto one side. This will help keep the airway clear. Do not try to force the mouth open with any hard implement or with fingers. It is not true that a person having a seizure can swallow his tongue. Efforts to hold the tongue down can injure teeth or jaw.  
• Don't attempt artificial respi[INVESTIGATOR_219608] a person does not start breathing again after the seizure has stopped.  
• Stay with the person until the seizure ends naturally.  
• Be friendly and reassuring as consciousness returns.  
• C[INVESTIGATOR_2394]tact [INVESTIGATOR_2394]- call physician.  
• If, at the discretion of the physician, the subject does not require admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], accompany him/her to his/her home to insure that he/she arrives safely.  
 Non Convulsive  
 
For individuals that experience non- convulsive, the following first aid should be 
provided in order to assure safety for all individuals involved and nearby.  
09/25/23 
 
 
 53 • Watch the person carefully and explain to others what is happening. 
Often people who don't recognize this kind of behavior as a seizure think that the dazed person is drunk or on drugs.  
• Speak quietly and calmly in a friendly way.  
• Guide the person gently away from any danger, such as a steep flight of steps, a busy highway, or a hot stove. Don't grab hold, however, unless some immediate danger threatens. People having this kind of seizure are on "automatic pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]" so far as their mov ements are concerned. Instinct 
may make them struggle or lash out at the person who is trying to hold them.  
• Stay with the person until full consciousness returns.  
• C[INVESTIGATOR_2394]tact [INVESTIGATOR_2394]- call physician.  
• If, at the discretion of the physician, the subject does not require admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], accompany him/her to his/her home to insure that he/she arrives safely.

 54 Appendix B: Completed S tudies Category A  
 
1. Sub- study A: The role of parietal regions as sources of attentional 
control for spatial attention and spatial working memory.  
The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that single pulses of TMS 
delivered to the superior parietal lobule (SPL) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), areas implicated in the control of attention, will alter posterior task -related 
activity in a similar way for spatial delayed recognition as they do for spatial attention. More specifically, we predict that when subjects are attending to a location of space to, for example, the left of central fixation, the response evoked by a single pulse of TMS will  be greater in magnitude in visual regions in 
the right hemisphere than in the left. The same pattern is predicted when subjects are remembering the locations of stimuli that had been presented to the left of fixation at the beginning of a delayed- recognit ion (i.e., “working memory”) 
task. Study A will combine a delayed- recognition task with a variant that requires 
spatial attention rather than spatial working memory. In the delayed- recognition 
task subjects will be presented with four dark -gray shapes appearing serially in 
four different locations on the (lighter gray) screen. The center of the screen is marked with a cross on which the subjects must keep their eyes throughout the trial. The stimuli are followed by a [ADDRESS_263963] a 
briefly presented, faint target that will appear with an unpredictable latency. The single pulse of TMS wi ll be delivered with the same timing during both the 
working memory task and the attention task. During the inter -trial interval (ITI), 
the subject will perform a visuomotor tracking task that requires moving a cursor so that it stays on top of a moving target stimulus. The subject moves the cursor by [CONTACT_219692] a keypad. Performance is measured as the error between the position of the target and position of the cursor, as well as of the velocity of the cursor (e.g., if it stops moving).  
Experimental Design:  The design, 3 (task: attention; delayed recognition; no 
task) x 2 (visual field) x 2 (TMS: present, absent) factorial (modified to exclude empty and nonsensical cells), yields blocks/scans of 18 trials each. Single 
pulses of TMS, delivered at 110% of resting motor threshold intensity will be delivered to the right SPL, right IPS, and right postcentral gyrus (PoCG, a control area selected because it is not involved in the cognitive constructs under investigation). Stimulation will be bloc ked by [CONTACT_11338], with the order 
counterbalanced across subjects, with 3 consecutive blocks per region. (Total of 162 trials, 81 featuring TMS; therefore, total of [ADDRESS_263964] to whether or not a TMS pulse is delivered, the minimum time between pulses will be 18 sec (when pulses are delivered on two consecutive trials).)  
 
09/25/[ADDRESS_263965] -based attentional control the same for nonmemory 
attention tasks as for working memory tasks?  
The attention task will present a flickering (750 msec on, 250 msec off) shape of 
approximately [ADDRESS_263966]’s task is to indicate with a button press each time a feature of the shape changes. Shapes will be drawn from a set of polygons that have been normatively determined to be difficult to verbalize, and have been used in several of the PI’s studies of object working memory. There are [ADDRESS_263967] one salient feature, and changes among the 4 will occur unpredictably an average of 3 times (range = 1 – 5) per trial. The delayed-
recognition task will draw from the same pool of stimuli as the attention task, with invalid probes drawn from one of the 3 variants of the target shape from that trial. The regions to be targeted will be the frontal eye fields (FEF), a region previ ously targeted in two studies conducted under protocol H -[ADDRESS_263968] results, plus the leg 
area of somatosensory cortex in the postcentral gyrus (PoCG), an area used as a stimulation control area i n many of the studies completed under protocol H -
2003- 033. During the inter -trial interval (ITI), the subject will perform a 
visuomotor tracking task that requires moving a cursor so that it stays on top of a moving target stimulus. The subject moves the c ursor by [CONTACT_219693] a keypad. Performance is measured as the error between the position of the target and position of the cursor, as well as of the velocity of the cursor (e.g., if it stops moving). Experimental Design: The design, 3 (tas k: attention; delayed recognition; no 
task) x 2 (visual field) x 2 (TMS: present, absent) factorial (modified to exclude empty and nonsensical cells), yields blocks/scans of 18 trials each. Single 
pulses of TMS, delivered at 110% of resting motor threshold intensity will be delivered to the right FEF, right SPL or IPS, and right PoCG. Stimulation will be blocked by [CONTACT_11338], with the order counterbalanced across subjects, with 3 consecutive blocks per region. (Total of 162 trials, 81 featuring TMS; therefore,  
total of [ADDRESS_263969] to whether or not a TMS pulse is delivered, the minimum time between pulses will be 18 sec (when pulses are delivered on two consecutive trials).)  
 
 
3. Sub- study C.  
Further investigation of the mechanisms of object -based attentional control and 
its relation to object working memory.  
The logic will be to cross two stimulus types – faces and houses – with two task 
types – attention and working memory. Tokens of the two stimulus types will 
always be presented superimposed at central fixation, a procedure that has 
been used to demonstrate that object -based attention can selectively bias 
activity in regions associated with processing either stimulus type, depending on 
task instructions. The responses evoked by [CONTACT_219694] e a source of object -
09/25/[ADDRESS_263970] differential 
effects on face -selective vs. house- selective cortex as a function of task 
instructions. The regions to be targeted will be the same as those from Study B. During the inter -trial interval (ITI), the subject will perform a visuomotor tracking 
task that requires moving a cursor so that it stays on top of a moving target stimulus. The subject moves the cursor by [CONTACT_219692] a keypad. Performance  is measured as the error between the position of the 
target and position of the cursor, as well as of the velocity of the cursor (e.g., if it stops moving).  
Experimental Design:  The design, 3 (task: attention; delayed recognition; no 
task) x 2 (visual field) x 2 (TMS: present, absent) factorial (modified to exclude empty and nonsensical cells), yields blocks/scans of 18 trials each. Single 
pulses of TMS, delivered at 110% of resting motor threshold intensity will be delivered to the three from sub- study B. Stimulation will be blocked by [CONTACT_11338], 
with the order counterbalanced across subjects, with 3 consecutive blocks per region. (Total of 162 trials, 81 featuring TMS; therefore, total of [ADDRESS_263971] to whether or not a TMS pulse is delivered, the minimum time between pulses will be 18 sec (when pulses are delivered on two consecutive trials).)   
 4. Sub- study D. Comparing the effects on spatial working memory of 
repetitive TMS delivered at multiple frequencies (MRI -guided)  
This study modifies the procedure of the working memory task from sub -study A  
by [CONTACT_219695] 3 sec, simultaneously recording the EEG, including three EEG sessions, and varying the frequency at with repetitive TMS is delivered, so as to compare the effects of repetitive TMS delivered at 10 Hz, IAF+1Hz, and the fre quency of sustained delay -period oscillatory power in the 
10 - 20 Hz range. In this sub- study subjects will be presented with four dark -gray 
shapes appearing serially in four different locations on the (lighter gray) screen. The center of the screen is marked with a cross on which the subjects must keep their eyes throughout the trial. The stimuli are followed by a [ADDRESS_263972] for varying reasons: 10 Hz  is 
the frequency at which repetitive TMS has been delivered on all of our previous studies of spatial working memory, and comparison of results with the other two frequencies vs. the “gold standard” of 10 Hz will thus be very informative. IAF+1 
Hz is the frequency at which Klimesch et al. (2003) have reported facilitatory 
effects of repetitive TMS, and offers a parameter by [CONTACT_219696]. Sustained 
delay -period oscillatory power  has been observed in many published EEG 
studies, including Hamidi, M., Slagter, H.A., Tononi, G., and Postle, B.R. (2009). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation affects behavior by [CONTACT_219685]. Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience, 3 :14. 
doi:10.3389/neuro.07.014.2009. PMC2707056.  Thus, it offers a second task -
09/25/[ADDRESS_263973]  will be the brief “eyes open/eyes closed” session 
to determine IAF, the second will entail repetitive TMS at 10 Hz and at IAF +1, 
the third, repetitive TMS at [ADDRESS_263974] revealed individual differences in the effects of 
repetitive TMS on both behavior and task -related EEG (Hamidi et al., 2009; 
Sub-study L), we do not yet know whether these patterns of individual 
differences are stable over time. That is, if [ADDRESS_263975], and a 
decrease in alpha- band power and an increase in accuracy for subject #2 
(mirroring what we saw in Hamidi et al (2009)), will these same two subjects show similar effect s if they perform the same experiment on a different day? In 
other words, what is the test -retest reliability of our procedure? The third session 
will occur on a different day than the second.  
Experimental Design:  Repetitive TMS will be delivered in 1.2 sec -long trains of 
10 Hz, IAF +1, and sustained delay -period oscillatory power, at 110% of the 
resting motor threshold intensity, at the beginning of the delay period. There will be a 5 second interval between all trials.  
  5. Sub- study E. The effects on spatial working memory of repetitive TMS 
delivered at a region’s natural frequency (MRI -guided)  
The natural frequency of a corticothalamic circuit is the frequency with which a 
brain region oscillates when stimulated by a pulse of TMS (analogous to the “ringing” that results from striking a bell, Rosanova et al., 2009). For the superior parietal lobule (SPL) this corresponds to [ADDRESS_263976] has produced interesting behavioral and EEG results (i.e., Hamidi et al., 2008; 2009). The purpose of this sub- study is to 
compare the results of repetitive TMS of SPL at [ADDRESS_263977] at this region’s natural frequency, which can vary between 18 –  [ADDRESS_263978] of a region’s corticothalamic architecture that does not influence that region’s function. The procedure for Sub- study E will replicate that of Sub -study D, wit h 
the exceptions that there will be two sessions (instead of 3; Session 1 will entail IAF estimation and natural frequency estimation, and Session 2 will entail task performance), and repetitive TMS will be delivered concurrent with behavioral task perform ance at IAF +[ADDRESS_263979]’s natural frequency.  
Experimental Design:  Depending on the natural frequency of SPL for a given 
subject, all repetitive TMS trains will be delivered for either 1.2 sec (if natural frequency ≤ 20 Hz) or 0.7 sec (if natural  frequency > 20 Hz and ≤ 25 Hz), at 
frequencies of IAF+1Hz and of the subject’s natural frequency, at 110% of the 
09/25/23 
 
 
 58 resting motor threshold intensity, at the beginning of the 3 sec -long delay period. 
There will be a 5 second interval between all trials.  
 
 
6. Sub- study F. The effects of cognitive training on sustained delay- period 
brain activity.  
Analyses of data from two previous studies performed by [CONTACT_978]’s group under 
protocol H -2003- [ADDRESS_263980] that all subjects are performing the same task, and are generally doing so at the same level of proficiency. They raise such question as: Do these differences underlie individual differences in behavior? Do they reflect differences in the cognitive processes engaged by [CONTACT_219697], or, instead, perhaps differences in trait -like physiological profiles that do not relate directly to task 
performance? Answers to these questions will contribute importantly to 
understanding which elements of sustained delay -period oscillations are critical 
for working memory -task performance. The strategy for addressing these 
questions, to be implemented in this sub- study, will be twofold: a) administer 
several psychometric tests that measure important cognitive and affective traits, 
and evaluate which covary with sustained delay -period oscillations; and b) 
assess the effects on sustained delay -period oscillations of a 5 week -long 
course of cognitive traini ng on a working memory task. Previous work indicates 
that such training can produce improvement on working memory -task 
performance that generalizes to other cognitive domains (e.g., Olesen et al., 
2004). Our question will be which, if any, aspects of sustained delay -period 
oscillations  are also sensitive to cognitive training. Thus, there are three 
categories of behavioral task in this sub- study: the EEG and TMS -EEG tasks 
during which sustained delay -period oscillations  are measured, the 
psychometric tasks, and the training task .  
a) EEG and TMS- EEG . The EEG recording session 
will proceed in four blocks, each comprising 150 trials. For Block 1 , subjects will perform a spatial 
delayed- recognition task (similar to those 
conducted under H -2003- 033), in which either [ADDRESS_263981] that either 
does or does not (with equal probability) appear in 
one of the cued locations. For the three 
subsequent blocks the task will be repeated, but in 
Block 2 , two pulses of TMS will be delivered 
during the delay period (this TMS procedure will 
be identical to the one previously approved by [CONTACT_219698]-IRB under protocol fH -2003- 033); in Block 3 , 
09/25/23 
 
 
 59 irrelevant (i.e., not  to be remembered) squares will 
be presented in an uncued quadrant of the screen 
at the same time as the to -be-remembered 
squares; and in Block 4 , irrelevant (i.e., not to be 
remembered) squares will be presented during the delay period of the trial.  
b) Psychometric tasks. Each of these has been 
selected to estimate a psychological construct believed to related to working memory -task 
performance.  
i) Change Detection. This task is frequently used to 
estimate “visual short -term memory [VSTM] 
capacity” (e.g., Vogel & Machizawa, 2005). After a 200 ms fixation plus a cue to covertly attend to either the left or right visual hemifield, a target memory array of randomly colored squares is presented for 100 ms with set sizes of 3, 4, 6, or 8 items. Subjects remember the target colors in the cued hemifield and ignore the other field. Following probe array, subjects indicate match versus non -match with button pr ess.  
ii) P
recision Task  (Bays & Husain, 2008) - This task 
will assess the precision with which an item’s orientation is remembered. An array of colored bars is presented in one hemifield for [ADDRESS_263982] indicate whether or not there was an orientation change.  
iii) O
peration Span task: This is a standard test to 
assess “working memory capacity” (Turner & Engle, 1989) Serial presentation of stimuli (letters) is interleaved with arithmetic problems that subjects must solve as they are presented. The task ends unpredictably, after varying numbers of 
letters are presented, with a cue requiring recall of the order of the letters  
iv) Sustained attention task. (Demeter et al., 2008). Subjects fixate on the center of the screen and report if they perceived the stimulus after probe tone. On 50% of trials the stimulus, a small gray box, will flash at fixation. A distractor condition 
09/25/23 
 
 
 60 adds a flashing background to the baseline task 
making the target less distinguishable.  
v) Guided search: This task probes ability to control attention via internal representations (e.g., Gold et al., 2007). Subjects see a template shape (a bracket oriented up, down, left, or right). Next, an array of similar items (distractors) and one template  match are presented. Subjects search 
the array for a match and indicate if a match exists. The task is “guided” via internal representation of the target. RT and accuracy will be measured. Difficulty is varied by [CONTACT_219699] (4,8,12, or 16 distractors).  
vi) Stroop Task  (Stroop, 1935):  This is a classic test 
assessing selective attention, cognitive flexibility, and processing speed. Subjects name [CONTACT_219710], with difficulty increased when, e.g., the word “red” is presented in blue ink.  
vii) A
ttention Control Scale : This 20- question 
inventory quantifies self -reported ability to control 
attention through assessment of attention focusing and flexibility (for example multitasking; Derryberry and Reed, 2002; Derryberry and Rothbard). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_219609] “When concentrating I ignore feelings of hunger and thirst”. Subjects report how often they agree with the statement on a 4- point 
scale. The inventory is self -paced.  
viii)R
aven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (Raven 
et al., 2003): This is a nonverbal test to assess the 
construct of “general fluid intelligence” (gF). Each matrix problem is a set of eight pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], arranged in a [ADDRESS_263983] consists of a set of 36 problems in increasing order of difficulty, administered via paper and pencil. Subjects solve as many matrix problems as 
possible within 40 minutes.  
ix) S
pi[INVESTIGATOR_73593]- Trait Anxiety Inventory  (STAI -
X2, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_57601]., 1983) is a common measure of trait -like individual differences in non-
clinical anxiety (i.e., it is not designed to assess clinical anxiety disorder). This 20- question 
inventory determines if a person has anxiety as a 
09/25/23 
 
 
 61 trait (versus a state - STAI -X1). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_219610] “I feel secure” and “I wish I could be as 
happy as others seem to be” where the subject rates how often the statement is applicable.  
x) BIS/BAS (Behavioral inhibition system/ activation 
system) - This widely employed 24- item 
questionnaire assesses behavioral inhibition and activation (Carver & White, 1994). The BIS is postulated to regulate aversive motivational behavior towards environmental factors such as punishment and inhibits movement towar ds a 
goal. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_219611] “Criticism or scolding hurts me quite a bit”. The BAS system is postulated to control appetitive behavior regulated by [CONTACT_219700]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_219612] “I go out of my way to get things I want”. The subject indicates how much they agree or disagree with the statement.  
xi) B
artlett Impulsivity Scale (BIS -11, Patton et al., 
1995). This is a [ADDRESS_263984] order factors including attention, motor, self -
control, cognitive complexity, perseverance, and cognitive instability. Representative items include “I am a careful thinker”. Items are scored on a 4 point scale where 1=rarely to 4=always. Scale reliability has been confirmed, and the inventory has been reassessed to accommodate updated findings in the field. 
xii) P
ersonality Research Form E:  This 20 -question 
inventory is widely used for assessing personality traits including impulsivity, aggression, autonomy, and nurturance (Jackson, 1974).  
c) Training Task . The training task will be an 
adaptive spatial n- back task (Olesen et al., 2004), 
in which subjects view a 4 x 4 grid, stimuli are presented serially in different cells (duration = 500 msec, interstimulus interval = 2500 msec, 1 trial is 3000 ms) and subjects indicate for each whether the current stimulus appears in the same location as had the stimulus n items previously. (E.g., in the 1- back condition, subjects compare the current 
item to the previous one, in the 2- back condition, 
they compare the current item to the item -before-
last, etc.) The task is adaptive in that the n varies 
09/25/23 
 
 
 62 as a function of performance, according to the 
following algorithm: there are 20 trials per block, performance > 90% will increase the n- level, 
performance on 3 consecutive blocks that are < 50% will decrease the n- level. Each day, the 
sessions start at n = 2. Subjects will perform this task for 40 min per day, M -F, for 5 consecutive 
weeks. Subjects can take a break every 10 blocks. Training will be performed in the PI’s laboratory at the Brogden Psychology building.  
Experimental Design:  2 pulses of TMS wi ll be 
delivered at 110% of MT during the delay period. The timing of the first pulse will be jittered relative to the onset of the delay period, and averaging a latency of 750 msec (+/ - 250) for the first pulse 
and [ADDRESS_263985] stimulation 
on spatial working memory as measured by [CONTACT_40394] -EEG. Behavioral tasks will 
be performed during fMRI scanning and will be similar to those approved as sub-study G under the PI’s protocol HS -IRB #2012 -0652. Briefly, subjects will be 
asked to remember for short periods of time (8 seconds) the direction of a gro up 
of dots moving. On any given trial, one, two, or three of the dot patterns can be moving. At the end of the delay period, a dial appears, and subjects will rotate 
the dial such that its line matches as closely as possible the direction of motion of the color -matching dot pattern. During the first day’s scanning session, 
subjects will perform [ADDRESS_263986] three runs. A short perceptual task will also be added on each day to control for potential perception modification in the encodi ng phase 
and it will be done before the main task.  
 
The aim of this study is to explore the neural mechanisms 
underlying findings from previous fMRI studies by [CONTACT_978]’s group. In Riggall and Postle (2012), we showed that the 
contents of a single item held in visual short term memory (STM) can be decoded from sensory visual cortex, despi[INVESTIGATOR_219613], sustained activity. In Emrich SM, Riggall AC, Larocque JJ and  Postle 
BR (2013), we confirmed these results, and also discovered showed that the neural representations changes as a function of load, in manner that corresponded to load- dependent 
declines in mnemonic resolution. Thus, the aim of this sub-study is to be tter understand how these visual 
09/25/23 
 
 
 63 representations and related brain circuits are disrupted as a 
result of TBS of a given brain area (i.e., middle temporal visual cortex – MT and inferior parietal sulcus -  IPS). More 
specifically, we would like to investigate how item -specific and 
load- spec ific visual STM representations are affected by [CONTACT_219701]. Lee and D’Esposito (2012) stimulated the prefrontal cortex (PFC) with TBS before a working memory task, and showed that PFC disruption dec reased the tuning of 
extrastriate cortex responses, coinciding with decrements in working memory performance. They also found that activity in the homologous PFC region in the nonstimulated hemisphere predicted performance following disruption (i.e., parti cipants 
with greater homologous PFC activity and greater connectivity between this region and extrastriate cortex were the most resistant to PFC disruption). What if we directly stimulate the sensory cortex which holds the visual representation of the visual STM (versus the parietal lobe)? Our main hypothesizes would be that after TBS of occipi[INVESTIGATOR_96067] (i.e., MT area known to be involved in motion), there will be a decrement in behavioral responses and a decreased memory representation in the visual cortex, which might most strongly affect the high memory load trials. After TBS of parietal cortex (i.e., IPS known to be involved with the load), we might expect to also have a decrease of behavioral 
responses (probably with high load) but the representation of the information per se in the visual cortices should stay the same, confirming a role for attentional control, but not stimulus representation, per se, in this region.  
 Experimental Design:  TBS is an innovative non- invasive 
repetitive TMS technique that has been recently shown to have several advantages over the conventional repetitive TMS. First, the conventional repetitive TMS can induce performance- enhancing or performance- impairing effect s for 
any given individual, which creates variability in the data. Second, at present, conventional repetitive TMS cannot be used during fMRI scanning due to a number of practical considerations. In particular, the heating of the TMS c oil, 
which builds up over repeated high- frequency trains, would 
pose a complication. Outside of the fMRI lab, an air -cooled 
system counteracts this, but this apparatus does not fit inside 
the bore of the magnet. Thus, a repetitive TMS protocol inside 
the s canner would need to incorporate periodic lengthy 
pauses to allow the cooling down of the coil. Third, applying conventional repetitive TMS before fMRI scanning, in a 
09/25/23 
 
 
 64 manner comparable to what we are proposing to do with TBS, 
the effects would be short lasting (usually 15 minutes or less) and often weak and highly variable (Gangitano et al., 2002). TBS is therefore ideally suited for studying the effects of repetitive T MS with fMRI because of its rapid and safe 
administration as well as its robust and less variable responses across populations of subjects. We propose to use a continuous TBS  protocol that consists of 50 Hz trains of 
three TMS pulses repeated every 200 ms continuously over a period of 40 seconds (600 pulses total). Continuous TBS has been shown to depress activity in the stimulated brain region for up to 60 minutes following stimulation (Huang et al., 2005, 2009). The TBS procedure will be the same as in pr eviously 
published studies (Huang et al., 2005, 2009; Lee and D’Esposito, 2012; Andoh and Zatorre, 2012; Morgan et al, 2013) and will follow the established safety guidelines (Rossi et al, 2009; Oberman et al, 2011). The risk of adverse events during TBS i s comparable to or less than the other 
conventional high frequency repetitive TMS protocols (Rossi et al 2009, Oberman et al, 2011).  
 
8.Sub- study H. Comparing the effect of repetitive TMS on items inside and 
outside of the focus of attention. This study replicates procedures from Zokaei et al. (2013) where 4 pulses of 20Hz rTMS at 60% of stimulator output was shown to abolish any recency effect from serial presentation and even improve performance on non- privileged items. In addition, these par ameters are 
applied to dual retrocueing paradigms previously used by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Postle’s group. Experiment 1 will replicate the Zokaei et al. (2013) design. Experiment [ADDRESS_263987] the attentional retrocueing paradigm. Experiment 1 will measure only the behavioral effects of rTMS, while both experiments 2 and 3 will be carried out while simultaneously  
collecting EEG data. All subjects will undergo a functional localizer in the MRI (fMRI) during the 1
st session (behavioral neurological testing and MRI) to identify 
optimal motion sensitive target locations in MT+. In all studies we will be including an active control where the same TMS parameters are applied to primary somatosensory cortex.  
Experimental Design: 4 pulses of 20Hz rTMS (150ms train) will be delivered at 
110% of adjusted motor threshold (Stokes et al., 2005) to motion sensitive areas of MT+ (identified by [CONTACT_219702]) or primary somatosensory cortex (S1). The task structure is such that  there is never less than 5000ms between 
trains.  
 
 
 Experiment 1: Subjects will view 2 random dot 
kinematograms  (RDKs) presented serially (300ms 
09/25/23 
 
 
 65 each) at fixation (one red, one green). The center 
of the screen is marked by a white cross on which subjects must maintain fixation throughout the trial. The stimuli are each followed by a mask and then a delay. On half of the trials, TMS is applied delay  
following either the 1st or 2nd RDK and mask. The second delay is followed by a response probe consisting of a circular aperture and a radial line (either red or green) indicating which stimulus to respond to. The subjects are instructed to adjust the lin e until it points in the same direction as the 
motion in the indicated RDK stimulus.  
 Experiment 2: This task will be identical to Experiment 1 with the exception that the timing will be changed to allow for spectral -power EEG 
analyses.  
 Experiment 3 (2 sessions): Subjects will view 2 
random dot kinematograms (RDKs) presented serially (300ms each) at fixation (one red, one green). The center of the screen is marked by a white cross on which subjects must maintain fixation throughout the trial. The stimuli are each followed by a mask and then a delay. The fixation 
cross will then either turn red or green indicating a retrocue as to which stimulus will be probed Retrocues are always 100% informative. TMS is then applied during the delay period following the first retrocue on half of the trials. A subset of trials will then probe the cued stimulus (this condition serves to force participants to utilize the 1
st retrocue 
and not simply rely on the 2nd retrocue for probe 
information). The probes will be identical to those from experiment 1. A second retrocue then appears (on half the trials, the same stimulus will be cued again), followed by a final delay and the probe.  
 
9.Sub- study I. Testing the effects of TMS on connectivity between delay-
active frontal and parietal regions with posterior visual regions involved in stimulus -specific storage.  Participants will perform a delayed- recall task for 
visual motion and color (motion and color on separate blocks of trials). Each trial will begin with the  presentation of an endogenous cue arrow (1 s), indicating the 
visual hemifield to be attended to dur ing the trial. Following the cue, three sets 
of dots will be presented sequenti ally (500 ms each, 250 ms ISI) on each side of 
the screen,  with either 1 or all 3 sets on each side moving/colored. Following a 
09/25/23 
 
 
 66 delay period (2 s), participants will be required to recall the color or direction 
of motion of one of the stimuli from the attended side, indicated by a numeral 
representing the sequential position of the dot  pattern to recall in the center of 
the screen.  Participants will recall this direction/color by [CONTACT_219703] (with a 
trackball) an indicate bar within a circular  aperture/color wheel until it points 
towards the remembered color or direction. During the delay period (randomly 750ms -1250ms into) single pulse TMS will be delivered to one of three sites 
identified using fMRI localizer scans collected earlier: 1: Area MT+ (identified with a moving vs. static dot pattern localizer task), 2: interparietal sulcus (IPS) (identified from areas showing a parametric increase in activity during the delay period between loads one and three and 3: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) (identified similarly to IPS).  
Experimental Design:  Single -pulse TMS, at 100 V/m as calculated by [CONTACT_219704], will 
be delivered once per trial during the delay period.  There will be a minimum of 
7.5 seconds between TMS pulses.  Subjects will complete a total of 576 trials, 
for a total of 576 pulses delivered duri ng the experiment.  
 10. Sub- study K. Oscillatory dynamics of near -threshold TMS -induced 
percepts. This study examines the neural dynamics associated with conscious perception of TMS -induced percepts called phosphenes.  While recording EEG 
and finding near -threshold stimulation intensities whereby [CONTACT_219705]  50% of trials, we aim to exam the pre-
stimulus EEG activity that is predictive of whether a participant experiences a phosphene on that trial or not.  We also aim to examine the n eural activity 
occurring after the TMS pulse that distinguishes trials where phosphenes were reported from those when they were not.  Participants will first complete a structural MRI scan for later use in TMS targeting.  Participants will then receive TMS  to their primary visual cortex as well as posterior parietal cortex, where 
phosphenes have been reported in the past.  For each stimulation site, and after each pulse is delivered, participants will respond verbally if a percept was present or not.  The TMS stimulation intensity will be gradually increased until a threshold is found for each participant where [ADDRESS_263988] not reported percepts after 100 stimulations at 90% of the maximum stimulator output.  This threshold will be used for the remainder of the behavioral task.  Participants will then be seated in front of a computer screen and, while recording EEG, will be asked  to maintain fixation on 
a crosshair in the center of the black screen.  TMS pulses will be delivered at pseudo- random intervals, followed by a 1 second black screen.  Using a 
computer mouse, participants will then report on a sliding scale (1- 100) their 
confidence that a percept was present.  
Experimental Design:  A total of 800 TMS pulses will be delivered: [ADDRESS_263989] on different days.

 67 11.Sub- study N. Examining the role of DLPFC in promoting visual -stimulus 
awareness and emotional regulation using TMS (MRI -guided). In a within -
subjects design, following the delivery of TMS to either the dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or a control region, postcentral gyrus (PoCG), 
behavioral tasks will be performed during an EEG session and will be similar to 
those approved in protocols HS -IRB #2011 -0542 and SE -IRB # 2012 -0100 
(Lapate et al., 2014). Behavioral tasks will comprise two tasks: the emotional 
misattribution paradigm, and a visual awareness task. Briefly, in the emotional 
misattribution paradigm, participants will be shown valenced facial expressions, 
which will be followed by [CONTACT_219706] (neutral faces, abstract images) shortly 
thereafter (1000- 5000ms). Participants will then be asked to indicate with a 
button press their preference ratings for the novel neutral stimuli. EEG data will 
be continuously recorded. In addition, pupil diameter and skin conductance 
responses may be collected to obtain information about the magnitude of 
emotional change evoked throughout the session. Following this task, 
participants’ vis ual awareness of the valenced facial expressions will be 
assessed using two 2- alternative forced choice paradigms (2AFC) where 
individuals will be asked to report on stimulus properties (e.g., face orientation; 
facial expression), as well as subjective vis ibility (i.e., clarity of the visual 
experience) using the Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS). These 2 tasks 
combined will comprise no more than 288 trials and will take no longer than 40 
minutes to complete, totaling a session (per TMS target; DLPFC and PoC G) of 
less than 1 hour. Participants will also be asked to complete questionnaires 
assessing their mood. We will pi[INVESTIGATOR_219614] 
(sub-studies A and G), offline theta- burst repetitive (tb) TMS, and online single 
pulse to determine which method is best suited for DLPFC inhibition in the 
context of this experiment. Both online and offline TMS modes of stimulation fall 
under the safe use guidelines of TMS that our lab has followed on all previous 
sub-studies (for TBS risk/benefit differences/similarities, see sub- studies A & G). 
In the session with single- pulse TMS to DLPFC vs. PoCG, th e single TMS pulse 
will be delivered immediately prior to the presentation of the valenced facial 
expressions.  
The two aims  of this study are (1) to directly probe whether DLPFC plays a 
causal role in preventing emotional misattribution when individuals are aware of 
emotional stimuli and (2) to examine whether the hypothesized DLPFC role in 
preventing emotional misattribution is mediated via its effect on subjective visual awareness of the emotional stimuli. Conscious (e.g., visual) awareness of an emotional stimulus has been reported to modulate behavior following emotional processing, with greater emotional misattribution following unaware relative to 
aware emotional -stimulus processing, which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_219615] -
congruent shifts in evaluative ratings (e.g., likeability) of novel neutral stimuli (Li, Moallem, Paller, & Gottfried, 2007; Murphy & Zajonc, 1993; Rotteveel, de Groot, Geutskens, & Phaf, 2001). The neural bases of this effect have begun to be explored (Lapate et al, submitted) and are consistent with the role DLPFC is known to play in emotional regulation (Delgado, Nearing, Ledoux, & Phelps, 2008; Erk et al., 2010; Lee, Heller, van Reekum, Nelson, & Davidson, 2012)  and 
09/25/23 
 
 
 68 behavioral regulation (Figner et al., 2010; Hare, Camerer, & Rangel, 2009; 
Knoch, Schneider, Schunk, Hohmann, & Fehr, 2009; Steinbeis, Bernhardt, & Singer, 2012) . Critically, DLPFC engagement during visual -stimulus processing 
is a neural correlate of subjective visual awareness (Lau & Passingham, 2006), i.e., being associated with the internal representation of the stimulus that facilitates conscious access to it.  Accordingly, depression of DLPFC via tbTMS 
impairs subjective access to visual stimuli, namely, simple geometric shapes (Rounis, Maniscalco, Rothwell, Passingham, & Lau, 2010). Given the evidence for the role of DLPFC function for promoting subjective awareness of visual stimuli, and goal -oriented (rather than stimulus -driven) behavior, it is 
hypothesized that inhibitory TMS stimulation over DLPFC  (vs. control area, 
PoCG) will produce increased emotional misattribution . Further,  subjective 
awareness of the visual stimuli is postulated to be reduced via DLPFC inhibition and to function as a plausible mediator of the DLPFC inhibition effect on emotional misattribution. The current study aims to test these two hypotheses by [CONTACT_219707].  
 Experimental Design: Theta- burst TMS (tbTMS) 
As in Study G, we propose to use a continuous TBS protocol that consists of 50 Hz 
trains of three  TMS  pulses repeated every 200 ms continuously over a period of 40 
seconds (600 pulses total). Continuous TBS has been shown to depress activity in the 
stimula ted brain region for up to 60 minutes following stimulation (Huang et al., 2005, 
2009). The TBS procedure will be the same as in previously published studies (Huang et 
al., 2005, 2009; Lee and D’Esposito, 2012; Andoh and Zatorre, 2012; Morgan et al, 
2013) and will follow the established safety guidelines (Rossi et al, 2009; Oberman et al, 
2011). The risk of adverse events during TBS is comparable to or less than the other 
conventional high frequency repetitive TMS  protocols (Rossi et al 2009, Oberman et al, 
2011). Single-pulse TMS As in Study A, Single-pulse TMS, at 100 V/m as calculated by 
[CONTACT_219704], will be delivered once per trial, immediately prior to the presentation of the 
valenced facial expressions. There will be a minimum of 6 seconds between TMS 
pulses. When combining the emotional misattribution and awareness tasks for each 
PoCG and DLPFC sites, subjects will complete a total of 576 trials, for a maximum total 
of 576 pulses delivered during the experiment.  
Questionnaires : 
Subjects will fill out several well- validated questionnaires to evaluate mood and 
assess potential TMS - induced mood chances, which will be completed during 
their visits at the Waisman and HERI Laboratory. They will take approximately 
15 minutes to complete, and will include the following measures:  
1. Positive and Negative Affect Scales -State & - Trait 
(PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988)  
2. The Implicit Positive and Negative Affect Test (IPANAT; Quirin et al., 2009)  
3. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_219616] X -1 & Spi[INVESTIGATOR_219617] X -2 (STAIX; Martuza & Kalistrom, 1974)  
4. The Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS; Parker et al., 2003)  
09/25/23 
 
 
 69 5. The Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (by [CONTACT_219708])  
6. Inhibitory Control Scale from the Adult Temperament 
Questionnaire (Evans & Rothbart, 2007)  
7. Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (Gross & John, 2003)  
  12.Sub -study P: Temporal Expectations as measured with EEG  
This sub -study will build on the findings of sub- study K. Behavioral task will be 
completed while EEG is recorded from an EGI system [ADDRESS_263990] when the stimulus would appear. Subjects are instructed to us e 
the cue to anticipate when the stimulus would appear.  This is done while EEG data is recorded.   
 13.Sub- study Q: Speed of alpha oscillations and temporal resolution of 
perception measured with EEG  
This sub -study addresses the question of whether there is a correlation between 
the speed of individuals’ alpha oscillations (measured with EEG) and the temporal resolution of their perception. EEG data is recorded from a 60- channel 
cap connected to an Exi mia 60 -channel amplifier (Nextim, Helsinki, Finland) 
while subjects complete a two- flash fusion task.  The task aims to determine the 
minimum time between two successive light flashes needed to perceive two, as opposed to one, distinct flashes.  Subjects are seated [ADDRESS_263991] from the monitor with a 100 Hz screen- refresh rate.  Each trial begins with a central 
fixation cross (.98 degrees of visual angle) that reduces luminance to prepare subjects for the stimuli.  The duration of the warning period is drawn from a 
uniform distribution between [ADDRESS_263992]. The experiment takes 1.5 hours in total.  
 14. Sub- study R: Investigation of visual perception  
In this experiment (lasting approximately 2 hours total), EEG and fMRI signal will be simultaneously recorded while subjects perform a visual detection task. A stimulus will be presented, and subjects will be asked whether it was a face or a 
09/25/23 
 
 
 70 house; then, they will be asked how visible the stimulus was on a pseudo-
continuous scale.  
 
 
 
15.Sub- study L.1 Comparing the effects of single pulse TMS to attended 
and unattended items in short -term memory (MRI -guided) .  
In this sub- study subjects will be presented with two stimuli (a face, a word, or a 
patch of coherently dots moving in a random direction). The center of the screen 
is marked with a cross on which the subjects must keep their eyes throughout the trial. The stimuli are followed by a 5 second delay period and then a cue 
(arrows) indicating which item (top or bottom) is to be remembered for an upcoming memory probe. A single pulse of TMS is applied 2.5 seconds after the cue; the memory probe is presented 2 sec onds after the TMS pulse. Then 
another cue is presented to indicate which item is to be remembered for a second memory probe presented after another 4.5- second delay. Subjects 
indicate with a button press whether or not the memory probe matches the cued item. The difference in the TMS evoked response on the EEG during the delay 
period when subjects are remembering attended (cued) versus unattended (uncued) items in short -term memory is of interest. Therefore, in each of the 
three EEG sessions, TMS is target ed to an area identified as important for 
representing each category of stimulus (face, word, motion) during a short -term 
memory delay period, providing observations of the TMS evoked response when the targeted category is in each of three states: attended, unattended, or absent on that trial.  Single pulse TMS will be delivered at 90- 110 V/m 2.5 
seconds after the cue on each trial.  Single pulse TMS delivered at 90- 110 V/m 
will be applied during the delay period to a face selective, word selective, or motion selective region of interest. There will be a 3 second interval between all trials. Subjects will perform eight blocks (consisting of 24 trials) per stimulation site. (Total of 192 trials.)  
 
16.Sub- study L.2. Comparing behavioral effects of single pulse TMS on 
reactivation of representations for unattended memory items.   
Sub-study L.2 will replicate the procedures of L.1., except that on half of the 
trials the uncued item will be tested (25% of total trials for the first probe and 
25% of total trials for the second probe). For this sub- study, subjects will have 
only the anatomical fMRI and no task will be completed in the scanner. No EEG will be recorded during this task.  Single pulse TMS will be delivered at 90- 110 
V/m after the cue on each trial.  Single pulse TMS delivered at 90- 110 V/m will 
be applied during the delay period to the Precuneus (a portion of the superior parietal lobule). There will be a 2 second interval between all trials. Subjects will perform ten blocks (consisting of 36 trials) per stimulation site. (Total of 360 trials.) Half of the total trials (180) will probe the uncued item. Half of these ‘catch’ trials will occur on the first and the other on the second probe. Probe 1 ‘catch’ trials will end after the first probe.  
 
09/25/[ADDRESS_263993] the 
hypothesis that cortical area MT in humans is crucial for representing multiple 
directions of simultaneously moving stimuli both during the stimulus presentation period and during the Working Memory (WM) delay period that follo ws the visual 
stimuli. Human subjects will first view visual stimuli composed of random dots moving simultaneously in two directions, which gives rise to the percept of two superimposed surfaces moving transparently in different directions. The angle of separation between these moving dot surfaces is systematically varied from 0-
[ADDRESS_263994]. After a 1 second delay period following this initial presentation (the “sample”), the subject will be cued as to which set of moving dots they s hould respond to. The subjects will then be 
presented with a circle, at the center of which is the mouse cursor (“probe”). They will make an outwardly radial mouse movement towards the outer edge of the circle in the direction they perceived the cued stimulus to have been traveling (“response”). When the probe is presented following a delay, information about motion needs to be stored in visual WM for subsequent output as a mouse movement. We will deliver repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) to cortical area MT of human subjects either during the visual stimulation period or the WM delay period, with simultaneous recoding of 
EEG. In addition to the blocks of trials performed with MT stimulation, we will perform a smaller number of trial blocks  with area S1 stimulation as a control. 
We will measure behavioral performance in terms of the error between the response and sample directions and compare these measures under both TMS -
on and TMS -off conditions. Many of the results obtained here will help guide the 
study design for future experiments probing this same question in monkeys as part of a collaboration with Xin Huang.  Repetitive TMS trains at 10 Hz delivered 
at 110% of the resting motor threshold intensity, will be applied for 1.0 sec either during the delay period or during the stimulus presentation to area MT/V5 plus to a postcentral gyrus control site (S1). There wil l be a 2 second interval 
between all trials, meaning subjects will not experience successive trains of rTMS with an interval shorter than 6 seconds. Subjects will perform 7 blocks (consisting of 30 trials) at the MT/V5 stimulation site and 3 blocks of 30 trials at the postcentral gyrus control stimulation site. This gives a total of 300 trials, 200 featuring repetitive TMS (for eac h block, 1/[ADDRESS_263995] rTMS during the delay 
period, 1/[ADDRESS_263996] rTMS duing the stimulus presentation period and 1/[ADDRESS_263997] no rTMS; all are randomly distributed throughout a block). The total 
number of pulses that will be delivered in this exper iment is 2000.  Repetitive 
TMS will be delivered in 1.0 sec -long trains of 10 Hz at 110% of the resting 
motor threshold intensity, at either the beginning of the delay period or at the 
start of stimulus presentation. There will be a [ADDRESS_263998] possible time between successive trains of

followed by a “stimulus period stimulation” trial).  
 
 Sub- study S: Decoding memory for visual motion.  
This sub -study attempts to decode a subject’s memory for visual motion. The 
study duration is one fMRI scan which takes approximately 2.[ADDRESS_263999]’s peripheral vision. The dots alternate between 
moving or remaining stationary. The subject is instructed to pay attention to the 
patch of dots without averting his/her gaze away from the central colored dot.  After three rounds of this task, the second task  begins. For the second task, the 
subject fixates on a central white cross that brightens just before the trial starts. Shortly after, the dots appear to be moving in one direction. The goal of the task is for the subject to remember the direction of the m oving dots by [CONTACT_219709]. A few seconds later, a wheel with a central radial spoke appears on the screen.  To indicate the direction of motion of the moving dots from the subject’s memor y, 
the subject aligns the spoke with the direction the dots were traveling and click the left trackball button. After the response, the central cross changes color to indicate the accuracy of the response.

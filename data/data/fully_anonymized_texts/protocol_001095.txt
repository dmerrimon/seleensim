Version 12.0 
(10/19/16 ) 9.2, 10.4.9, 11.2, 12.1.8, Table 2  Prior to Version 12.0 of the protocol, three strategies were used to address 
participants’ nutritional status: 1) Consultation with a study registered 
dietician (RD) at baseline for participants who are malnourished ( Mini 
Nutritional Assessment -Short Form (MNA® -SF) score ≤7), at risk for 
malnutrition (MNA ®-SF score 8 -11), or with  serum albumin ≤3.5 g/dl; 2) 
Consultation with a study RD if there is weight loss of 2% or more between 
weight assessments performed every four weeks in the course of the 
intervention visits, and 3) Referral for follow -up and/or medical evaluation 
for possible malnutrition if the MNA ®-SF score at follow -up is ≤7.  
 
In Version 12.0, to streamline procedures , we eliminated the third strategy 
(MNA screening for malnutrition at follow -up). Identifying nutritional 
deficiencies at baseline (the first strategy) and monitoring weight loss 
throughout the intervention period  (the second strategy)  will be sufficient for 
addressing  participants’ nutritional status.  
 
In the event that a weight measurement is not obtained at the last PT 
intervention visit, the participant’s weight at the 16 -week  follow -up 
assessment will be compared to his or her baseline weight and, if there has 
been weight loss  of 5% or more , the c linical site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_505155]’s weight trajectory, baseline 
body mass i ndex, baseline MNA® -SF score, and registered dietician’s 
documentation and, if warranted based on clinical judgment, will refer the 
participant to a dietician or medical provider for follow -up of possible poor 
nutritional status.

 1, 6.1, 8.1, 10, 11  In order to conserve resources, we eliminated several secondary and tertiary 
outcome measures, while retaining measures needed for the assessment and 
adjudication of the primary outcome, to determine study eligibility, to ensure 
participant safety, to monitor adverse events, and to describe  characteristics 
of the participant population.  
Version 11.0 
(8/26/16) 9.2, 10.6.1, 11.3  In order to conserve resources, we eliminated the collection of information

 All sections  
 
 Prior to Version 10.0 of the protocol, follow -up assessment visits occurred 
16 weeks and 40 weeks from the date of randomization, telephone 
interviews were conducted every four weeks during the 40 -week study 
period for a total of 10 telephone interviews, a nd participants received 
vitamin D, calcium, and multivitamin supplements for a total of 40 weeks. In 
order to conserve resources and preserve the primary outcome , the protocol 
was revised so that study participation of participants randomized after 
approv al of Version 10.0 of the protocol will end after the 16 -week follow -
up assessment. The wording of the protocol has been changed accordingly.

given week to be replaced by [CONTACT_505232] 
(not to exceed 3 visits in any given week) as long as the visits are on non -
consecutive days. Furthermore, if the participant has not had 32 visits by [CONTACT_13195] 16 weeks,  we are allowing  makeup  visits to be  performed during the 
subsequent two weeks to get as close as possible to the target of 32 visits.  
The purpose of this modification is to increase intervention adherence.

2 In the previous protocol  participants who were at risk of malnutrition and 
those who were malnourished, based on the Mini Nutritional Assessment -
Short Form (MNA® -SF) score and serum albumin level, received an in -
person visit from a registered dietician (RD). However, it was found that 
many participants in the at -risk group did not require an in -person visit. 
Therefore, in the proposed  protocol, participants in the at -risk group based 
MNA® -SF score and with a normal serum albumin level will receive a 
phone call from the RD and will only receive a follow -up in -person visit if 
the RD believes it is necessary .

probability of participation than the unselected hip fracture pa tients who are 
approached for the study in the acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  The new recruitment 
strategies include  screening at rehabilitation facilities , home care agencies,

Version 6.0  
(11/21/14)  All sections  In the previous protocol, participants received three intervention visits per 
week in the first eight weeks of the intervention and two intervention visits 
per week in the second eight weeks. In this version of the protocol, the 
frequency in the first eigh t weeks has been reduced to two times per week so 
that participants will receive two visits per week for all 16 weeks. The 
intensity and total duration of the intervention s will not change and there is 
no evidence in the literature indicating that a frequency of three days per 
week is superior to two days per week for improving strength or function.  
Reducing the frequency may increase participation, may increase 
participants ’ willingness to start the intervention earlier in the post-fracture 
period, and may improve adherence to the intervention schedule.  Changes 
were made throughout the protocol to reflect the reduction in the total 
number of intervention visits from 40 to 32 . 
Version 6.0  
(11/21/14)  All sections  Changes were made throughout the protocol to reflect  revisions made to the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
Version 6.0  
(11/21/14)  All sections  We have removed references to the appendices throughout the protocol and 
removed Section 22 (Supplements/Appendix). Appendices provided with the 
original protocol submission represented draft documents and are no longer 
current, as these items continue to be modified to meet the operational needs 
of the study.   
 
Summary of Modifications to Protocol Version 5.0 for Version 5.0 .1 
 
Summary of Modifications to Protocol Version 4.0.1 for Version 5.0  Version 6.0  
(11/21/14)  7.2 (criterion 1.1)  We have removed the ICD codes from this criterion.  The operational 
definition of hip fracture diagnosis is not based on ICD codes since they are 
not available at the time of screening .   
Version 6.0  
(11/21/14)  7.2 (criteria 1.3 and 1.6)  Unilateral hip fracture and stress fracture were deleted as e ligibility criteria  
since patients with these types of fractures can safely perform and can 
benefit from the study interventions.  
Version 6.0  
(11/21/14)  7.2 (criterion 1.7)  Orthopedic surgeon permission to contact [CONTACT_505233] a study -
wide exclusion criterion sinc e this is not required at all sites.  
Version 6.0  
(11/21/14)  7.3 (criterion 4.5)  The interval between hospi[INVESTIGATOR_505156] 
26 weeks. This may help increase participation of people who need more 
time to complete usual home t herapy before starting the study interventions.  
Version 6.0  
(11/21/14)  7.3 (criteria 5.3 -5.10, 5.12, 5.13, 
5.16, and 6.11 -6.13)  These 14 medical criteria were deleted as exclusions to avoid unnecessarily 
screening out patients who could safely perform the  study interventions and 
benefit from them. Clinical site clinicians will review all potentially eligible 
patients to ensure that they can safely participate in the study.  
Version 6.0  
(11/21/14)  7.3 (criterion 5.18)  Severe lower extremity pain with ambulation was deleted as an exclusion  
criterion . Significant pain while walking will now be assessed during the 
baseline administration of the Six -Minute Walk Test (SMWT) (criterion 
6.10).  
Version 6.0  
(11/21/14)  7.3 (criterion 6.10)  This criterion has be en revised to exclude patients who develop severe pain 
during the baseline SMWT . 
Version 6.0  
(11/21/14)  7.3 (criterion 5.21)  The exclusion criterion was revised to be specific to receiving physical 
therapy in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_505157]. Patients receiving physical therapy at home will be eligible 
to begin the study interventions.    
Version 6.0  
(11/21/14)  7.3 (criterion 6.7)  This criterion was revised to exclude people who are not fully weight -
bearing on either the fractured or non -fractured leg at time of randomization.  
Version 6.0

Summary of Modifications to Protocol Version 4.0 for Version 4.0 .1 Version 5.0  
(4/17/14) All sections  Changes were made  throughout the protocol to capture revisions made to the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
Version 5.0  
(4/17/14)  7.2 (criteri on 1.4)  Eliminated the restriction for surgical fixation within seven days of 
admission.  
Version 5.0 
(4/17/14)  7.2 (criteri on 2.1) Lowered the age limit to 60 and older at time of randomization.  
Version 5.0  
(4/17/14)  7.3 (criterion 4.5)  
 Widened the randomization window to [ADDRESS_651689] admission (10 ± 
10 weeks). This will help maximize participation of people who receive a 
shorter duration of regular PT post hip fracture and of those who receive a 
longer duration of PT.  
Version 5.0  
(4/17/14)  7.3 (criteri on 5.4) Modified the BMI cutpoint to 17 and dele ted the weight restriction  due to 
some older hip fracture patients being of short stature .  
Version 5.0  
(4/17/14)  7.3 (criteri on 5.6) This criterion has been broken out into 3  separate items in order to allow for 
specific operationalization related to Parkinson’s Disease and for multiple 
sclerosis . 
Version 5.0  
(4/17/14)  7.3 (criteri on 5.13)  Deleted this criterion since individuals with contractures will be captured 
with other criteria.  
Version 5.0  
(4/17/14)  7.3 (criterion 5.20)  Revised the criterion to be specific to receiving PT related to the hip fracture 
and removed OT since this should not interfere with the study.  
Version 5.0  
(4/17/14)  7.3 (criteria 6.11 -6.13)  These three items were edited to capture recent surgeries and fractures of 
lower extremities to cover both the  period prior to the hip fracture but also 
the period during screening for the study.  
Version 5.0  
(4/17/14)  7.3 (criteria 7.1 -7.3) Deleted these three items since they do not cause a safety risk for 
participating in the PT interventions. These items will be handled like 
history of kidney stones and participants will  not receive calcium 
supplementation.   
Version 5.0  
(4/17/14)  Table [ADDRESS_651690] the edits to the criteria described above.

evaluating medical eligibility and safety and to reviewing RAEs, provided 
those professionals are permitted by [CONTACT_505234] (not 
under physician supervision) in the jurisdiction and the institution in which 
the c linical site is located. This change will facilitate clinical sites’ access to 
appropriate clinicians who are available for time -sensitive study activities.

medical eligibility, safety and reviewing RAEs. This will vary according to 
state regulations. This will facilitate clinical sit es’ access to appropriate 
clinicians who are available for time -sensitive activities. Clinical Site

that will be implemented in the three clinical sites, accounting for local 
differences in staffing and institutional i nfrastructure . Exclusion criteria 
collected from the medical chart will continue to be obtained at phase 1. 
However, assessment of e xclusion criteria requiring patient self -report has

Version 2.1  
(12/17/12)  3.2.3  The plan for distribution of the vitamins and supplements has been modified 
to be consistent with the MOP.   Each treatmen t kit contains five individual 
packs, numbered 1 -5.  Packs 1 -4 each contain a 4 -week supply of vitamin 
D3, calcium, and a multivitamin. Pack 5 contains a 24 -week supply that will 
be provided to participants at the conclusion of the 16 -week intervention 
period.   
Version 2.1  
(12/17/12)  6.[ADDRESS_651697] received training and 
certification on randomization procedures, including the clinical site PI, 
clinical site coordinator, or other unblinde d personnel not performing 
evaluations.  This is now consistent with the MOP.  Further clarification has 
also been added about blinding of interventionists to study outcomes and 
about restricting access to the participant binder which will contain sensitiv e 
information about treatment assignment.  
Version 2.1  
(12/17/12)  6.4 We added clarification that clinical site PIs and clinical site coordinators 
who are responsible for assigning work and assessing  treatment fidelity for 
PTs in both groups are completel y unblinded.  Only those who will perform 
evaluations (clinical site visits and telephone interviews) after randomization 
and the Independent Safety Monitor (ISM) will be blinded to treatment 
assignment.  
Version 2.1  
(12/17/12)  9.2 The section on the nutri tional intervention has been revised to clarify that a 
participant who loses 2% or more body weight in a four -week period will 
receive another telephone consultation by [CONTACT_505235], regardless of 
whether the participant is trying to lose weight.   Nutritio nal experts serving 
on the advisory committee providing Specialized Support for Exercise and 
Nutrition believe that loss of 2% or more body weight in this elderly 
population warrants follow -up from a registered dietician, who can 
determine whether weight l oss was intentional.   
Version 2.1  
(12/17/12)  13 and Figures  5b-5d Changes were made to this section to indicate that the responsibility for 
determining relatedness of RAEs will entirely be the responsibility of the 
independent safety monitor (ISM), who will remain blinded.  RAE reports 
and supporting documents sent to the ISM will be redacted to conceal 
treatment assignment.

for clarity and consistency with the MOP.  These changes can be seen with 
Track Changes. All significant changes are summarized in the remaining 
section s of this table.  
Version 2.0  
(10/31/12)  All sections  Changes were made to the naming of the physical therapy interventions.  
“Shuttle Plus” is now PUSH.  “TENS Plus” is now PULSE. We wanted to 
use names for the interventions that did not include the device name [CONTACT_505357].  
Version 2.0  
(10/31/12)  All sections  In the original proposal, data capture, data management, and randomization 
were to be implemented by [CONTACT_505236] (CSPCC) in Perry Point, MD. However, 
because of administrative and regulatory changes at the CSPCC, it was 
necessary to identify a different data group to handle these tasks. We have 
contracted with Axio Research, LLC (Seattle, WA) to provide data services. 
Throughou t the current protocol version, “CSPCC” has been changed to 
“Axio Research, LLC” or “Axio” to reflect this change. References to 
DataFax (the data capture system that was proposed in the original protocol) 
have been removed to reflect the change to paper - and web -based data entry.  
Version 2.0  
(10/31/12)  All sections  The name [CONTACT_505358] “tracking database” to 
“study management database” to more accurately reflect its role.

procedures related to change to Axio as provider of data services.  
Version 2.0  
(10/31/12)  6.2 “The date and time of randomization is the time of study entry for each 
participant” was changed to “The date  of randomization will mark the start 
of follow -up for each participant”. This correction was made to avoid 
contradicting the statement that “Date of enrollment in the trial is defined as 
the date of informed consent” (7.6.1).   
Version 2.0

included as reasons why someone is not eligible.  
A correction was made to item 5.18.  The gait speed is still the same, but it is 
based on walking less than 4 meters in 40 seconds.  
Version 2.0

(10/31/12)  20 Updates made to the Study Team Roster.  
 
Summary of Modifications to Protocol Version 1.2 for Version 1.3  
 
Summary of Modifications to Protocol Version 1. 1 for Version 1.2  
 
Summar y of Modifications to Protocol V ersion 1. 0 for Version 1.1  Version 
(date)  Section  Brief Summary of Modification  
Version 1.3 
(5/31/2012)  15.5 Changes were made to the text to clarify the inefficacy/harm boundary of the 
interim analysis plan.  
Version 
(date)  Section  Brief Summary of Modification  
Version 1.2 
(4/17/2012)  13.4.3  Edited this section for clarity  using the term injury consistently to delineate 
events that need to be reported while under study supervision .   
Version 1.2 
(4/17/2012)  7.2 (criterion 1.7)  Moved this item from eligibility section 6 since it is an initial inclusion 
criterion.  
Version 1.2 
(4/17/2012)  7.3 (criterion 4.5)  Added a criterion to capture the maximum randomization date of [ADDRESS_651704] admission.  
Version 1.2 
(4/17/2012)  7.3 (criterion 5.20)  Added a criterion for still receiving PT or OT at time of randomization.  
Version 1.2  
(4/17/2012)  7.3 (criterion 6.11)  Added a criterion that excludes patients with a prior hip fracture or total hip 
replacement on the same side as the study index hip fracture to avoid 
misclassification of the injury when the source could be due to failure of 
prior surgery or prosthesis.  
Version 1.2 
(4/17/2012)  7.3 (criteria 6.12 and 6.13)  Added 2 criteria to exclude patients who are in the process of recovering 
from another recent lower extremity musculoskeletal event or procedure.  
Version 1.2 
(4/17/2012 ) 13.5, 13.6, 13.7, 13.[ADDRESS_651705] to the DSMB and NIA directly.   
Version 1.2 
(4/17/2012)  15.[ADDRESS_651706] provided more details about our 
approach to the interim analyses.  
Version 1.2 
(4/17/2012)  15.6  Power was re-calculated using R software to account for 1) the group 
sequential design and 2) the impact of non -compliance on variances.  
Version 
(date)  Section  Brief Summary of Modification  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)   Incorporates recommendations from the DSMB meeting on 12/12/2011 and 
Steering Committee’s edits  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  Executive Summary, 4.2, 10.4.5, 
15.2.2  Corrected wording of tertiary outcome to be consistent across the protocol: 
"increase of 50 meters or more in distance walked."  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  Executive Summary, 3.2.3, 6.3, 
9.3, 12.1.7  Increased the amount of time participants will receive study medications to 
include the period beyond the 16 -week intervention period. Participants will 
now receive vitamin D, calcium, and multivitamin daily for the entire 40 -
week study period, as per the DSMB recommendation.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  Executive Summary, 3.2.3, 6.3, 
9.3 Removed one -time loading dose of 100,000 IU of vitamin  D3 at 
randomization due to safety concerns in the recent literature and as per 
DSMB recommendation.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  Executive Summary, 3.2.3, 6.3, 
9.3 Edited the amount of calcium provided from 1000 mg (500 mg twice a day), 
to 600 mg once a day a s per DSMB recommendation.   
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  Executive Summary, 9.2, 12.1.7  Changed procedure for nutritional intervention based on recommendation of 
Clinical Direction Committee. If a participant has a serum albumin level 2.5 -
3.5, he/she will rec eive a diet consultation visit from the registered dietitian 
following the same protocol as for those who are at risk according to the 
Mini Nutritional Assessment –Short Form.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  3.1.6 (DCC)  Added "...implement the data analysis plan"  to DCC’s list of responsibilities.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  3.2.3, 12.1.7  Added calculated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min obtained from blood 
draw as a contraindication for calcium supplementation.  Participants with 
contraindications for calcium will receive vitamin D and multivitamin.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  6.1 (Figure 1)  Included revised Figure 1 for clarity.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  4.2 Corrected an error. "…following initiation of the intervention” was replaced 
by “...following randomization."  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  7.1, 10.1, 11.4 (Table 3)  Based on the DSMB’s recommendations, we have added three exclusion 
criteria: hemoglobin < 9 g/dl, calculated creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min, 
and serum albumin < 2.5 g/dl. The blood can be obtained between phases 2 
and 3, but no more than 4 weeks prior to randomization.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  7.1 Updated Figure 2 incorporating the blood draw and additional exclusion 
criteria and possibility of phase 2 being an in -person visit.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  7.1, 7.5, 7.6, 17.2  We are no longer requiring that informed consent be obtained at the baseline 
visit (phase 3 screening). For greater flexibility and to maximize enrollment, 
we are now allowing informed consent to be obtained at any time prior to 
data collec tion that is not covered by [CONTACT_505237].  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  7.2 (criterion 3)  Edited item for clarity.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  7.2 (criterion 3.3)  Moved this item from eligibility section 5 since it is defining our target 
popula tion. 
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  7.2 (criterion 5.1)  As per DSMB, added new exclusion criterion of calculated creatinine 
clearance < 15 ml/min as a medical impediment to participation.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  7.2 (criterion 5.2)  As per DSMB, added new exclusion criterion of serum albumin < 2.5 g/dl as 
a medical impediment to participation.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  7.2 (criterion 5.5)  Deleted "legally blind" since we capture this in criterion 5.4 (severe sensory 
impairment (visual or hearing)).  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  7.2 (criterion 5.7)  "History of Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis…." moved from 
eligibility section 6 since the criterion captures medical impediments to 
participation.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  7.2 (criterion 6.1)  As per DSMB, added new exclusion criterion of hemoglobin < 9 g/dl for 
safety.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  7.2 (criterion 7)  Edited the category so that it is just contraindications for calcium 
supplementation.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  7.2 (criterion 7.2)  
 Deleted glomerular fil tration rate (<30 ml/min) obtained from the medical 
chart  since we are now obtaining a calculated creatinine clearance from 
blood drawn within 4 weeks prior to randomization. A calculated creatinine 
clearance <30 ml/min will be a contraindication for rece iving calcium 
supplementation.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  7.2 (criterion 8)  Deleted "Other" as a criterion.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  7.2 (Table 1)  Edited Table [ADDRESS_651707] all changes to the eligibility criteria.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  9.2, 10.6.1, 11.[ADDRESS_651708] -intervention period 
using self -report questions administered during the 4 -week phone calls.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  10.1.1  Correction: Height will be measured in feet and inches and weight will be 
measured in pounds.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  10.3.2  Added clarification on the scoring of the balance measure.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  10.3.[ADDRESS_651709] 
walking speed.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  10.4.[ADDRESS_651710] statement about summing the scores for obtaining the 
standing balance subscale.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  11 (Table 2)  Updated the table to reflect the timing of informed consent, addition of a 
blood draw, and assessment of adherence to study medications beyond 
intervention period.    
 
 Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  11.4 (Table 3)  With the add ition of the blood, the timing of informed consent and phase [ADDRESS_651711] -admission  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  11.[ADDRESS_651712] (SMWT) be administered 
only by [CONTACT_505238] -
study staff. We have clarified that, at follow -up, self -report or proxy -report 
of walking ability will be used for p articipants who cannot perform the 
SMWT because of non -physical reasons (e.g., cognitive or sensory 
impairment).  
We have clarified that our approach to classification will reduce bias by 
[CONTACT_505239].  
We have removed the sample self/proxy -report question that will be used to 
assess walking ability. The actual question will be added to the data 
collection forms and the Manual of Procedures.  
The adjudication process has been c larified.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  11.5, 15.1  At follow -up, participants who cannot perform the SMWT because of 
illness, sickness, or death will be considered treatment failures in both the 
primary and secondary analyses. They were considered missing in se condary 
analysis in the previous version.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  11.5 (Figure 4)  Updated Figure [ADDRESS_651713] changes to the classification of the primary 
outcome as described in section 11.5.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  13.5, 13.8  Updated text and Figures 5b -5d to incorporate NIH reporting timelines for 
serious adverse events.   SAEs will be reported to the DSMB and NIA by [CONTACT_505240] 48 hours of when the event is known and reported by 
[CONTACT_464].  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  15.1 Clarified primary outcome as "…able to walk 300 meters or more in six 
minutes..."  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  15.[ADDRESS_651714] replaced "beta spending" with "lower bound spending" because 
the spending is actually computed under the null hypothesis.  
Our in terim analysis is asymmetrical, but we plan to perform a two -sided 
(symmetrical) test at the end. To clarify, we have added: “The two -sided test 
with nominal alpha=0.05 will be operationalized at the final analysis by 
[CONTACT_505241] |Z| > 2.03.”  
Version 1.1  
(1/26/2012)  15.6.[ADDRESS_651715] size for the economic evaluation was recalculated with 
alpha=0.05, instead of alpha=0.01.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  16.4 Clarified that site visit reports will only be sent to the Steering Committee 
(SC) not to the DSMB and the SC.  
Version 1.1 
(1/26/2012)  20 Updates made to the Study Team Roster.

CAP Protocol version 12.0  1 Section 1:  Executive Summary  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_505161], significant residual disability remains in older 
persons after a hip fracture.1-[ADDRESS_651722] -surgery. One year 
after hip fracture, 20% of patients need help putting on pants, 50% need assistance to walk, and 
90% need assistance to cl imb stairs.[ADDRESS_651723] -hip fracture rehabilitation ( i.e., usual care) fails to return many 
patients to pre -fracture levels of function. In contrast to stroke and heart disease, other 
commonly occurring acute conditions in the older population, there are few intervention trials 
focused on decreasing disabili ty following hip fracture. None of the trials for hip fracture has 
examined the effect of early post -fracture intervention on the ability to ambulate at a level 
required for independent function in the community (i.e., community  ambulation ). Thus, there is 
a paucity of evidence to justify extending medical management beyond usual care in persons 
following hip fracture to achieve community, rather than merely household, ambulation.  
 
Study Title  
Improving Community Ambulation after Hip Fract ure (hereafter referred to as  the Community 
Ambulation Project or “CAP”)  
 
Objectives  
The primary outcome will be ability to walk [ADDRESS_651724] on a set of tertiary  outcomes . Precursors to 
community ambulation include measures of endurance, dynamic balance,  walking speed, 
quadriceps  strength , and lower extremity  function . Tertiary  outcomes include activities of daily 
living ( ADLs ), quality of life, physical activity, lower extremity physical performance, balance 
confidence, increase of 50 meters or more in distance walked in six minutes, nutritional status, 
cognitive status, and depressi ve symptoms .  
 
Design and Outcomes  
A randomiz ed controlled trial (RCT) including  [ADDRESS_651725] experienced a hip 
fracture will be carried out at three clinical sites with half of the subjects receiving a specific 
multi -component intervention ( PUSH ) and the other half receiving a non-specific multi -
component intervention ( PULSE ).  Randomization of [ADDRESS_651726] 
(SMWT) at [ADDRESS_651727] had surgical 
repair for hip fracture will be  identified at the three clinical sites and evaluated for eligibility. 
Following consent to participate, eligible participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline 
assessment.  Participants completing the entire baseline assessment will be randomized to one 
of the two treatment groups.   
 
The two groups will be compared on measures of endurance, dynamic balance, walking speed, 
quadriceps strength, and lower extremity function using the  distance walked in six minutes , 
Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), dynamometry for quadriceps strength, an d 
Modified Physical Performance Test (mPPT).  Resource utilization will be tracked using 
CAP Protocol version 12.[ADDRESS_651728] on quality -adjusted life years 
(QALYs), cost, and cost per QALY gained over the period  following randomization. The cost -
effectiveness analyses will address both the within trial comparison of the study interventions 
and a model -based comparison of the study interve ntions and usual care. This RCT will also 
compare the effect of the interventions on the following tertiary  outcomes that are relat ed to 
community ambulation: ADLs, balance confidence, quality of life, physical activity, lower 
extremity physical performanc e, depressi ve symptoms , increase of 50 meters or more in 
distance walked in six minutes, cognitive status, and nutritional status. Telephone interviews 
every four weeks will also obtain information on adverse events  (AEs) , and will help reduce loss 
to follow -up by [CONTACT_505242].  
 
For participants randomized prior to version 10.[ADDRESS_651729] -randomization.  
 
In version 11.0 of the protocol, we will eliminate several secondary and tertiary outcome 
measures . 
 
Interventions and Duration  
Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: 1) PUSH  or 2) PULSE . 
Within a week of randomization, participants will initiate the intervention with a  physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]  
(PT) in their home and receive counseling with a registered dietician to ensure body weight 
stability and adequate nutrient intake inclusive of a healthy diet.  Participants in both intervention 
groups will also receive vitamin D, calci um and multivitamin supplements during the 16-week 
study  period.   
 
Both groups will receive [ADDRESS_651730] in the participant’s  place of residence.  
 
PUSH  Intervention  
The PUSH  intervention is based on improving specific precursors to community ambulation . The 
intervention addresses  endurance  with continuous upright exercise for 20 minutes; function  by 
[CONTACT_505243] , standing from a chair, and stair 
negotiation; muscle  performance  by [CONTACT_505244] -appropriate movements and ranges; 
and balance by [CONTACT_505245]. 
The components of  exercise are woven together into one program that minimizes participant 
burden.  By [CONTACT_505246], p articipants will be instructed to complete the 
endurance component independently one to two times/week by [CONTACT_46138] a similar duration  
and intensity as they have been doing with the PT during the supervised visits.  
 
The strength components of the muscle performance intervention will be performed using a 
portable progressive resistive exercise device (Shuttle® MiniPress, Contemporary Des ign 
Company, [PO_BOX], Glacier, WA [ZIP_CODE]).  Muscle performance will focus on bilateral hip 
extensors, hip abductors, knee extensors, and plantar flexors because of their role in function, 
specifically gait and transfer activities.  Balance and strengt h will be addressed with additional 
exercises performed while standing.  The endurance intervention will begin initially with two to 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  3 three minutes of continuous upper and lower extremity active range of motion (AROM) with the 
participant sitting. These exe rcises are intended to increase the participants’ heart rate (HR)  or 
exertion closer to the target zone. The participant will then be asked to walk on level surfaces 
and up and down a single or multiple steps, if able and available, to keep the HR within t he 
training zone for 20 minutes. The PT may also engage the participant in additional exercises 
such as upper and lower extremity AROM  exercises to keep the HR elevated.  
 
PULSE  Intervention  
The PULSE  intervention group will receive flexibility exercises, AROM for the upper and lower 
extremities, breathing exercises and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). During 
the AROM exercises, participants will be working to increase flexibility and range of motion in 
order to increase the motion the par ticipant produces. The exercises will include the neck, 
shoulders, arms, trunk, hips, knees and ankles.  During all of the AROM exercises, the 
participant will focus on deep breathing t echniques. Progression will be gradual by [CONTACT_505247] [ADDRESS_651731] approximately 20 -30 minutes.  
 
After the AROM exercises, the second part of the session will use sensory level electric al 
stimulation on lower extremity muscle groups. The TENS portion of intervention is intended to 
decrease pain thereby [CONTACT_505248]. Conventional TENS uses low -level 
electrical current to stimulate superficial cutaneous nerve fibers th rough the skin. The amount of 
current for sensory level stimulation is that level which the participant detects as a "tingling" 
sensation and is not high enough to produce a visible muscle contraction (below motor 
threshold).5  Flexible carbonized, disposable electrodes coated with a self -adhesive conductive 
polyme r will be applied to the skin. The electrodes will be placed bilaterally near the motor 
points on muscle bellies (the gluteal complex, the quadriceps, and the gastrocnemius) for seven 
minutes per muscle group. The muscle regions selected are important for function after hip 
fracture.   
 
Nutrition Intervention  
Given the importance of maintaining nutrition in both study groups, we will provide all 
participants (regardless of group) with 2000 IU vitamin D3, 600 mg of calcium, and a 
multivitamin daily for the 16-week study  period . Nutritional counseling will also be provided to 
ensure weight stability, adequate nutrient intake of 1.2-1.5 g protein/kg body  weight inclusive of 
a healthy diet (50% carbohydrate, 20% protein, 30% fat).  Participants will be screened  at the 
time of randomization to assess nutritional risk using the Mini Nutritional Assessment -Short 
Form (MNA® -SF).6 Those who score ≤7 (malnourished) on the MNA® -SF at baseline and 
participants with serum albumin 2.5 -3.5 g/dl (regardless of the score on MNA® -SF) will receive 
a visit from a registered dietician (RD) from our study in their place of residence within seve n 
days of randomization. The RD will evaluate and counsel them on making dietary modifications 
based on their protein, caloric and other dietary deficiencies using a standardized approach 
across the three study sites.7-[ADDRESS_651732] will follow up with participants by [CONTACT_505249]. Participants 
who score 8 -11 (at risk of malnutrition) at baseline  and have serum albumin level >3.5 g/dl will 
receive a telephone dietary consultation with the RD within seven days of randomization . Based 
on the participant's eating habits and food intake, the RD may make the clinical determination 
that an in -person con sultation is warranted. In these cases, the RD will schedule an in -person 
dietary consultation, following the same protocol as those who score in the malnourished range. 
Those with a score ≥12 on the MNA® -SF and who have serum albumin level >3.5 g/dl at 
baseline will receive brief telephone contact [CONTACT_505250]. Weight will be monitored during home PT 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  4 visits every four weeks and those who lose 2% or more body weight in  a four -week period will 
receive another telephone consultation by [CONTACT_505235].  
 
Participants randomized p rior to version 10.[ADDRESS_651733] -
randomization.  
 
Sample Size and Population  
The target sample size is 210 randomized hip fracture patients across three clinical sites (with 
approxi mately 35 in each treatment group at each site).  Study inclusion criteria are: 1) Closed, 
non-pathologic, minimal trauma hip fracture with surgical fixation; 2) Age 6 0 or older at time of 
randomization; 3) Living in the community at time of fracture and at time of randomization; and 
4) Ambulating without human assistance during the two months prior to fracture.  Participants 
for whom it is not safe to participate in the  interventions will be excluded, as will those who are 
very unlikely to benefit and in whom the interventions are not feasible.

CAP Protocol version 12.0  12 Section 4:  Study Objectives  
 
4.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective  will be to determine if a specific multi -component  16-week intervention 
based on aerobic conditioning, specificity of training, and muscle overload (the PUSH 
intervention),  initiated up to 26  weeks following admission  to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_505172] , will be  
more successful in producing community ambulation at 16 weeks after study entry 
(approximately six months post -fracture) compared to a non -specific multi -component 
intervention of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), flexibility activities, and 
AROM exercises  (the PULSE intervent ion).   
 
The primary hypothesis is that there will be a [ADDRESS_651740] (SMWT).  
 
4.[ADDRESS_651741] on secondary and tertiary outcomes . There are five variables (endurance, dynamic 
balance, walking speed, quadriceps strength, and lower extremity function) that are 
hypothesized to be precursors to community ambulation. To gain a better understanding of the 
interventions’ mechanisms, the two groups will be compared at [ADDRESS_651742] of the inte rventions on 
several tertiary outcomes including ADLs, balance confidence, quality of life, physical activity, 
lower extremity physical performance, depressive symptoms, increase of ≥ [ADDRESS_651743] will provide critical information on whether the specific PUSH  intervention 
can improve a hip fracture patient’s ability to ambulate in the community in a cost -effective 
manner compared to the non-specific PULSE  intervention. To address the econom ic value of 
trial interventions versus usual care, a model -based analysis that combines trial data with other 
data sources also will be undertaken.  
 
Section 5:  Background  
Current standard Medicare -reimbursed rehabilitation therapy fails to restore community 
ambulati on to older persons who have had a hip fracture. A residual mobility disability similar to 
that reported for stroke occurs in the majority of persons who “recover” from hip fracture.10,[ADDRESS_651744] to hip fracture patients, their families and the 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  13 health care system is between $14 and $[ADDRESS_651745]-hip fracture concluded that there is not sufficient evidence to 
determine if the intervention s evaluated  substantially reduce residual disability and enhance 
community ambulation.20 
 
5.1  Residual Deficits in Precursors of Community Ambulation  
Effective community ambulation requires sufficiency in five physical precursors: endurance; 
dynamic balance; lower limb muscle strength; walking speed; and lower extremi ty function. The 
precursors enable the person to get up out of bed, get out the front door, and participate in 
community activities. Previous studies indicate significant residual impairments for persons with 
hip fracture who have completed “usual” care.  
 
Endurance . Deconditioning is expected following a hip fracture, but there is a paucity of 
evidence on aerobic capacity from maximal treadmill or cycle ergometry exercise tests.21-25 The 
only study that examined peak oxygen uptake ( VO 2 peak ) values in [ADDRESS_651746]-fracture. This contrasts to 400 
meters reported for 80 -year-olds living in the community30 or 350 meters reported for a sample 
of comparable age in the Cardiovascular Health Study.31 
 
Balance.  Dynamic balance is compromised after hip fracture. For example, at the end of usual 
care ( 2-[ADDRESS_651747] -fracture), 20% who had regained independence in ADL reported falling; 
those who had fallen since hospi[INVESTIGATOR_505173].10,[ADDRESS_651748] -fracture and 18% were readmitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_505174]-related injury.[ADDRESS_651749]-fracture is between 30% and 83%, depending on the study .34-[ADDRESS_651750]-fracture (Magaziner 2000) 
suggesting that interventions prior to that time might add to the natural recovery process .  
 
Lower Extremity Muscle Strength . Hip fracture is accompanied by [CONTACT_505258].[ADDRESS_651751]-fracture when 
physical recovery is reported to plateau, a limited proportion  of hip fracture patients report 
climbing a flight of stairs (8%) or walking one half a mile (6%).2,[ADDRESS_651752] hip fracture patients do not return to pre -fracture functional status.2,45,47-
50  They walk more unsteadily and more slowl y for shorter distances.51,52  
 
Summary : The numbers and costs of hip fracture are significant, and one to two  months of 
usual care is inadequate for restoring function to this patient group.  Most hip fracture patients 
do not regain pre -fracture mobility status. Endurance, dynamic balance, walki ng speed, lower 
extremity muscle strength, an d lower extremity function are compromised and contribute to 
failure to achieve community ambulation.  
 
5.2 Exercise Studies in Persons after Hip Fracture  
Based on the results of Mangione’s survey of [ADDRESS_651753] -hip fracture.  Seven trials26,55-60 provided intervention early 
(approximately two  months) after hip fracture. Various combinations of low intensity AROM or 
flexibility exercises, functional training, strengthening, and balance exercise did not produce 
outcomes that were different from “usual care” with three exceptions.26,55,[ADDRESS_651754] trial ,26 which included aerobic conditioning during in -patient 
rehabilitation, demonstrated improved endurance (VO 2 peak), increased mobility, and improve d 
balance.  
 
The other clinical trials began six months or later after hip fracture, with interventions that 
included  various combinations of strengthening exercise, balance training, functional training, 
and AROM/flexibility. Three of these included endur ance training but lacked at least one of the 
other components of the program we are proposing. Results show positive outcomes in terms of 
function, gait speed, balance, strength, and endurance.22,29,63-[ADDRESS_651755] -fracture, but no changes in  dynamic balance or walking speed.69 Since hip 
fracture recovery is reported to plateau at six months (which is when the interventions in these 
studies began) , the results of these studies are comparable to the exercise findings reported in 
older adults without hip fracture, i.e., that older adults benefit from increased activity. These 
studies indicate that use of higher intensity exercise with endurance train ing beginning six 
months post -fracture reduces impairments in precursors to community ambulation.  
 
CAP Protocol version 12.[ADDRESS_651756] of the joint -specific 
therapeutic exercises reported involved AROM, with very few therapi[INVESTIGATOR_505175] (manual, elastic bands, or weights) for a specific exercise. This study will 
compare  the effect of two interventions that provide  additional supervised exercise in the home 
following completion of post-acute  rehabilitation . One intervention will be specific in delivering 
exercise focused on addressing the precursors of ambulation in the community (PUSH ). The 
other intervention (PULSE ) will be non -specific and will be similar to the joint -specific 
therapeutic exercises described in the Mangione et al. trial71 and will add a  modality for pain 
relief.[ADDRESS_651757] reported effects of exercise interventions on 
improved physical function, balance, endurance, mobility and/or falls in community -dwelling 
elders without hip fracture.22,77,78,81-85  Studies reporting positive outcomes had similar content 
(strength, balance, and endurance), used high exercise intensity, and the exercises were 
tailored to the individual’s needs rather than using a generic pro tocol. Task -oriented functional 
activities81,83 were more effective in achieving positive outcomes than t raditional regimens that 
included isometric or isotonic strength training, static standing balance training, and/or cycle 
ergometry.77,82 
 
Principles deri ved from exercise physiology will be used to determine the intensity of the 
endurance and muscle performance exercises.  According to the overload principle, exercise 
should be performed at an intensity higher than the usual load to increase the metabolic 
demand and facilitate a training response .80,86-88  Overload  will be achieved by [CONTACT_505259] (effort or load), or frequency and duration (number of repetitions, number of sets). 
Manipulation of intensity, frequency, or duration alters the exercise dose - heart rate for 
endurance training or the amount of muscle force produced for muscle strengthening.[ADDRESS_651758] been cited to 
account for this impairment including inactivity, fear of moving the injured limb,  and pain. 
Arthrogenic muscle response (AMR) , defined as an ongoing reflex reaction of the musculature 
surrounding a joint after distension or damage to structures of that joint , is another reported 
consequence of joint injury.71 AMR has been suggested to be the result of inhibition of a 
muscle’s motoneuron pool excitab ility and appears to be independent of pain and swelling and 
may persist after the acute injury has resolved. A current hypothesis is that AMR occurs in 
response to distorted articular sensory receptors after joint injury. Although AMR has been 
studied in the knee, shoulder, elbow and ankle, this response may also occur in the hip muscle 
following hip fracture and surgical repair. One reason, therefore, that TENS will be applied to the 
gluteal, quadriceps, and gastroc -soleus muscles is to promote somatosens ory input; the goal of 
this input is to induce changes in the excitabil ity of the motor neurons and to somatosensory 
motor cortex to assist in activation of the  motor neurons .[ADDRESS_651759] in pain management. 
Herrick et al (2004) grouped persons with hip fracture as moderate/severe or mild/no pain.97 
Forty -two percent  of the sample reported moderate/severe pain at baseline. The other benefit of 
TENS will be to reduce pain which may lead to an increased activity level. TENS has been 
demonstrated to be effective in  managing both acute and chronic pain for a number of 
conditions. Cheing and Hui -Chan (2004), for example, reported that TENS alone applied to 
persons with chronic pain secondary to knee osteoarthritis resulted in  an increase in knee ROM  
during walking and increased gait speed.98 TENS was compared with a sham control after 
surgical repair of hip fracture. When TENS was applied after surgery, pain on movement was 
reduced and health -related quality of life improved.99 Gorodetskyi (2007)  compared  the effect of 
electrical stimulation to a sham c ontrol in [ADDRESS_651760] that includes the ability to accommodate change in level 
and terrain irregularity (necessary to enter and leave the home and for curb management), 
avoid obstacles and walk a requisite distance.[ADDRESS_651761] fewer postural transitions (turning the head, extending their reach, or 
changing direction).[ADDRESS_651762] 
suggesting that both are correlates of community ambulation.110 The SMWT also has been used 
as an outcome measure to determine the effectiveness of exercise interventions for elderly 
patients with and without hip fracture.29,63,111 
 
Distance . Some investigators use a 400 m threshold (2 -3 city blocks) for the SMWT to identify 
community -dwelling elders at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a mobility disability.27,82,107,108,112-[ADDRESS_651763] include:   1) 
at six months post -fracture or post-stroke, average group performance is < 300 m29,63,72,109,115; 2) 
achieving < 300 m on the SMWT is a predictor of mortality ;28 3) average distance from parking 
space in a supermarket parking lot to task completion in the supermarket in both urban and rural 
communities is [ADDRESS_651764] been developed to include the community walker (i.e., independent in all home 
and community activities).  A reported gait speed of 0.8 m/s signifies the community 
walker.121,[ADDRESS_651765] -hip fracture, usual gait speeds range from 0.44  to 0.97 m/s , 
29,33,56,57,64,72,123-[ADDRESS_651766]  reported that a speed threshold of 0.8 m/s is a useful and discriminative primary endpoint 
in clinical trials of exercise rehabilitation.125 
 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  18 Summary and Primary Endpoint : The SMWT is an assessment with excellent psychometric 
properties, and there is sound justification for a 300 m distance threshold on the SMWT 
(equivale nt to walking at 0 .8 m/s) to serve as an indicator for community ambulatory ability.

expected  AEs, and to help reduce loss to follow -up by [CONTACT_505260]. An honorarium will be given at the completion of both study assessment visits.  
 
For participants randomized p rior to version 10.0 of the protocol, follow -up assessment visits 
occurred 16 weeks and 40 weeks from the date of randomization and telephone interviews were 
conducted every four weeks during the 40 -week study period for a total of 10 telephone 
interviews.  
 
6.2 Randomization  
Randomization will occur up to 26  weeks  after admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] a hip fracture. The 
randomization schedule for each clinical site will ensure that treatments are randomly assigned 
within blocks of 2, 4, 6, or 8 , with equal numbers of participan ts assigned to each treatment 
within each block. Block sizes (two to eight pa rticipant s per block) will be randomly selected with 
the probability of each block size specified by [CONTACT_183285].  
 
To ensure that those performing evaluations remain blinded to tre atment assignment, 
randomization will only be performed by [CONTACT_505261].  T he clinical site PI, clinical site 
coordinator , or another unblinded designee  will perform the randomization. Random treatment 
assignments will be obtained using a secure Web -based randomization system. Each member 
of the study staff who has permission to randomize participants will be assigned a unique, 
nontransferable user ID that  will be required to obtain random treatment allocations. The study 
staff member will access the system by [CONTACT_505262] a secure (encrypted) Web site and receive the 
treatment assignment after responding to prompts confirming that the participant meets all 
inclusion and exclusion criteria and has given informed consent for enrollment. A printable 
report will be available as part of the Web system. Site staff will be instructed to print the report 
and retain it in the participant’s binder. Access to the binders is limited to the clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_497514].  The date of randomization will mark the start of follow -up for each participant; a 
computer record is maintained for each attempt to randomize a participant.  The clinical site 
coordinator will inform par ticipants of their group assignment and will tell them when their PT 
sessions will begin. The coordinator will also provide the name [CONTACT_505359][CONTACT_224259]. The coordinator will then alert the assign ed PT who will contact [CONTACT_505263].  
 
6.[ADDRESS_651771] in participants’  
place of residence. The PUSH  intervention group will be receiving a specific multi -component 
training intervention and the PULSE  intervention group will receive a  non-specific  multi -
component intervention that stimulates the same muscle groups as in the PUSH  group . 
Participants in both intervention  groups  will receive  2000 IU of vitamin D3, 600 mg of calcium, 
and a multivitamin daily for the duration of the study  and nutritional counseling to ensure weight 
stability  and adequate nutrient intake inclusive o f a healthy diet.  
 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  20 6.4 Blinding of Study Staff  
Given the nature of the interventions being tested in this study, it will not be possible to blind the 
participants or the PTs providing the intervention s. To minimize “contamination” of the 
interventions, each PT will provide only one of the interventions and PTs will not have contact 
[CONTACT_505264]. The 
interventionists will be told that this is a study comparing a specific multi -component intervention 
and a non -specific  multi -component intervention to increase mobility following hip fracture, but 
specific hypotheses or rationale of the study will not be discussed with them.  The 
interventionists will be blinded to participants’ study  outcomes.   
 
Clinical site PIs and clinical site coordinators who are responsible for assigning work and/or 
assessing for treatment fidelity of PTs in both groups are unblinded.  Unblinded s tudy staff 
involved in randomization will not perform follow -up data collection.  
 
Only those who will perform evaluations (clinical site visits and telephone interviews) after 
randomization and the Independent Safety Monitor (ISM) will be blinded to treatment 
assignment.  Blinded s tudy staff perform ing follow -up assess ments or telephone interviews are 
instructed not to ask about treatment assignment when in contact [CONTACT_20688]. Participants 
will be asked not to discuss their treatment experience (including the identi ty of the PT providing 
the intervention) during study visits and telephone calls  conducted by [CONTACT_201218] .  
 
Only a small number of DCC  staff members and members of the DSMB  will see group -specific 
study results. In the event of inadvertent unblinding of study staff, a protocol deviation  will be 
repor ted and a notation will be made in the participant binder specifying  the circumstances of 
the unblinding event and a list of all persons unblinded.  
 
Section 7:  Selection and Enrollment of Participants  
 
7.1 Eligibility    
Participants will be evaluated for eligibility in three phases (see Figure 2), all of which must be 
completed no more than 26 weeks  after admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] a hip fracture.  In phase 1, 
patients will be assessed for inclusion criteria and medica l exclusions. Information for phase 1 
will be collected from the patient’s medical chart.  Patients who are provisionally eligible based 
on medical chart review at phase 1 will be approached in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (or soon after discharge) 
and told about the stud y. Interested patients (or their legally authorized representative) will be

other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_505182]. We will obtain approval of our 
study protocol from the UMB  IRB, from each of the three clinical sites , and from each study 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  23 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
Clinical site PIs will identify other method(s) of recruitment that are appropriate for their 
respective sites.   
 
7.5 Participant Screening and Recruitment  
Participants will be evaluated for eligibility in three phases to be completed no later than 26 
weeks after admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_505172].  Information for phase 1 will be collected 
from the patient’s medical chart . For those identified in acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] , study staff  with 
adequate medical training and experience reviewing medical records will check the admitting 
records and operating room logs of study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_505183]. A 
HIPAA Partial Privacy Waiver (for recruitment) or verbal consent to review the medical chart for 
eligibility will be obtained for patients identified at study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Patients who are provisionally 
eligible based on medical c hart review at phase 1 will be approached in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (or soon 
after discharge) and told about the study.  Written permission from the patient will be obtained to 
allow future contact [CONTACT_505270]. Patients who are iden tified 
through means of recruitment  other than screening in study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_505184] 1 eligibility criteria.  
Clinical sites will address specific recruitment methods and content (e.g., customized landing 
pages for websites, print advertisements and flyers) in their local IRB applications.   
 
Phase [ADDRESS_651778] -admission, potential 
participants and others identified b y patients (e.g., caregiver or other family member) will be 
provided with additional information about what participation in the study entails.  
 
7.6 Informed Consent  
Written informed consent and appropriate HIPAA authorization s and/or waivers  will be obtained 
in compliance with procedures reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_977] s’ IRBs  prior to any 
data collection. Informed consent can be obtained anytime upon completion of phase [ADDRESS_651779] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. Regardles s of when informed consent 
is obtained, study staff will follow the Good Clinical Practice guidelines for informed consent. A 
copy of the informed consent form (ICF) will always be provided (either in person or by [CONTACT_2319]) to 
potential participants to allow f or adequate review of the information and to allow review with 
family members. Prior to obtaining informed consent, time will be given to the potential 
participant to review the consent form and ask questions. If a participant ha s vision impairments 
that prevent her/him  from reading the ICF, the consent form will be read aloud to them and the 
informed consent process will be witnessed . The witness should also sign and personally date 
the consent form attesting that the information in the consent form and any other written 
information was accurately explained to, and apparently understood by, the participant and that 
informed consent was freely given. Even when the participant reads the consent form on their 
own, study staff will sum marize all components of the ICF and remind potential participants that 
participation in the study is voluntary and that s/he has the right to withdraw at any time . It will 
also be explained that signing the consent form allows the study to confirm final e ligibility before 
randomization to a treatment group. The consent process will be performed without the use of 
any coercive language or behavior, and with respect for the person's autonomy.  
 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  24 The goal of the informed consent process is to increase potentia l participants’ understanding of 
the study in order to better enable them to decide whether or not to enroll.   Therefore, every 
effort will be made to help potential participants understand the research project.  During the 
informed consent process, study staff will provide participants with adequate information 
concerning the study procedures, respond to questions and concerns, and ensure that each 
individual understands all the information provided by [CONTACT_505271].   
 
Potential participants who choose to enroll will be assessed for their ability to provide informed 
consent using a  local IRB-approved method , such as using the Evaluation to Sign Consent  
measure .  Individuals who do not understand the study purpose, methods, risks, and benefits 
are not  able to provide their own informed consent  and will not be eligible for participation . The 
informed consent process will be documented by [CONTACT_505272]: that the study was explained, questions (if any) were answered, ability to 
provide informed consent was assessed, subject agreed to participate and signed the consent 
form and HIPAA Authorization , the presence of a witness for individuals with hearing or vision  
impairments, and a copy of the signed consent form and HIPAA Authorization was given to 
participant  and, if necessary, left in the chart of facility .  For people who provide informed 
consent, the original signed ICF will be submitted to the study office a nd a copy of the signed 
ICF will be given to the participant.  If the person provided consent while in a medical facility, a 
copy of the  ICF will go into her/his chart.  The clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or designee will ensure the 
accuracy, completeness, legibility , and timeliness of the informed consent process conducted by 
[CONTACT_505273] 3 eligibility data are collected.

8.[ADDRESS_651780] information on expected  AEs and RAEs . These regular phone contacts also help with 
retention.  Partici pants  will be reminded of the next phone call and follow -up assessment .   
 
If participants are unable to come to the clinical site  for the follow -up assessment , a visit at 
another location (home or another facility) will be scheduled. Telephone interviews will be 
scheduled if in -person visits cannot be completed.  
 
Clinical sites will keep detailed records of rescheduled and missed study assessment visits, 
missed phone interviews, and missed intervention visits. Participant retention will be monitored, 
and e fforts will be made to provide support and encouragement to participants who are at risk of 
being lost to follow -up. 
 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  25 8.2 Drop -out Prevention  Efforts  
The following procedures will be implemented to minimize and monitor missed follow -up 
assessments, telephone i nterviews, and intervention visits:  
 Providing pre -visit reminders (e.g., postcards and phone calls) for upcoming assessment 
visits. Also, reminders about the upcoming follow -up assessment will be provided during 
the four -week phone calls.  
 Calling participa nts the night before a follow -up assessment to remind them of the visit 
and the time for transportation pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up, if appropriate.  
 Utilizing an Access study management  database developed by [CONTACT_505274], so that staff will be immediately 
alerted to a missed intervention or assessment visit.  
 Contact[CONTACT_220379] (or significant others) when they miss a visit.  
 Rescheduling the visit within the same window, if possible.  
 Rescheduling the visit during the out-of-window  interval , if necessary.  
 
Some randomized participants may not actively participate in the study, either by [CONTACT_505275]/or by [CONTACT_201230] -up assessments. These participants will be 
followed until t he end of the study unless they explicitly request not to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. Study staff 
will make contact [CONTACT_505276]. Also, considerable effo rt will be expended to 
collect data on the primary outcome at the follow -up assessment.  
 
8.3 Monitoring Recruitment and Retention  
The CCC will monitor recruitment and retention with the help of a study management  database 
(see Section 16: ), which will be used to track all participant contacts, status of participants, 
activity of study staff members, form completion, and form submission. The CCC wi ll track 
screening and recruitment yields against the number expected per site. The CCC will work 
closely with clinical site PIs and the Recruitment and Evaluation SOC to identify and reduce 
barriers to recruitment. We will review the number of patients sc reened relative to the number of 
participants recruited through each recruitment source quarterly and initiate additional 
enrollment strategies if recruitment goals are not being met.  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_651781] with clinic staff  to: 
1. Review recruitment goals and yields for clinical sites,  
2. Review the recruitment plan and progress in achieving the objectives outlined in 
the plan,  
3. Share successful and unsuccessful  recruitment methods, and  
4. Review retention.  
CAP Protocol version 12.0  26  
If clinical sites encounter difficulties in recruitment or retention, the CCC (or a subgroup it 
designates) will provide a graduated set of assistance responses that are based on the degree 
of recruitment or re tention shortfall. Solutions will be developed that are based on site -specific 
issues.  
 
 
Section 9:  Study Interventions  
 
9.1 Overview  
Participants will be assigned to one of two treatment groups: 1) PUSH  or 2) PULSE . The PUSH  
intervention group will receive a specific multi -component training intervention and the PULSE  
intervention group will receive a non -specific intervention that stimulates the same muscle 
groups as the PUSH  intervention. Both groups will receive [ADDRESS_651782] in the 
participant’s place of residence.  
 
9.2 Nutritional Intervention  
Given the importance of ensuring adequate nutrition in both study groups, we will provide all 
participants with 2000 IU of vitamin D3, 600 mg of calcium, and a multivitamin daily for the 
duration of the 16-week study  and nutritional counseling to ensure weight stability, adequate 
nutrient intake of 1 g protein/kg body weight inclusive of a healthy diet (50% carbohydrate, 20% 
protein, 30% fat).  Participants will be screened at the time of randomization to assess 
nutritional risk using the Mini Nutritional Assessment -Short Form ( MNA® -SF).6 Those who score 
≤7 (malnourished) at baseline and parti cipants with serum albumin 2.5 -3.5 g/dl ( regardless of 
the score on MNA® -SF) will receive a visit from a registered dietician (RD) in their place of 
residence within seven days of randomization. The RD will evaluate and counsel them on 
making dietary modif ications based on their protein, caloric and other dietary deficiencies using 
a standardized approach across the three study sites.7-[ADDRESS_651783] will follow up with participants 
by [CONTACT_505277]. Participants who score 8 -11 (at risk of malnutrition) at baseline and have 
serum albumin level >3.5 g/dl will receive a telephone dietary consultation with the RD within 
seven days of randomization. Based on the participant's eating habits and food intake, the RD 
may make the clinical determination that an in -person consultation is warranted. In these cases, 
the RD will schedule an in -person dietary consultation, following the same protocol as those 
who score in the malnourished range. Those with a score ≥12 on the MNA® -SF and who have 
serum albumin level >3.5 g/dl at baseline will receive brief telephone contact [CONTACT_505278].  
 
Weight will be monitored during home PT visits every four weeks and those who lose 2%  or 
more  body weight in a four -week period will receive another telephone consultation by [CONTACT_505279]. This protocol applies to anyone who loses 2% or more of body weight, regardless of 
whether the participant is trying to lose weight . In the event that a weight measurement is not 
obtained at the last PT visit, the participant’s weight at the 16 -week follow -up assessment will be 
compared to his or her baseline weight and, i f there is weight loss of 5% or more, t he clinical 
site PI [INVESTIGATOR_505185]’s weight trajectory, baseline BMI, 
baseline MNA® -SF score, and registered dietician’s documentation and, if warranted based on 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  27 clinical judgment, will refer the participant to a die tician or medical provider for follow -up of 
possible poor nutritional status.  
Participants randomized p rior to version 10.0 of the protocol received vitamin D, calcium, and 
multivitamin supplements for a total of 40 weeks.  
 
9.3 PUSH  Intervention  
This intervention is based on improving specific precursors to community ambulation by 
[CONTACT_505280] 20 minutes in duration; function  such 
as walking, standing from a chair, and stair negotiation; muscle  performance  by [CONTACT_505281] -appropriate movements and ranges; and balance by [CONTACT_505282]. The se components of exercise  will be woven 
together into one program that minimizes participant burden. By [CONTACT_505283]/ week by [CONTACT_46138] a sim ilar duration and intensity as they have been doing with the PT 
during the supervised visits.  
 
The strength components of the muscle performance intervention will be performed using a 
portable progressive resistive exercise device  (Shuttle ® Mini Press , Con temporary Design 
Company, [PO_BOX], Glacier, WA [ZIP_CODE]) . The device  has six latex bands each with a 
starting load equal to approximately  seven  pounds. At full excursion one band can provide 
approximately [ADDRESS_651784] during the leg press motion 
since this mimics the functional activity of rising from a chair or going up a step. Hip abductors 
will be trained in 5° of adduction and to 10 -15° of abduction.  Fifteen degrees of movement was 
chosen because it approximates the 8° of motion associated with gait and takes into account 
variations in hip positions while standing.141  Hip extension will also be trained in standing from 
35° of flexion  to extension to a neutral position. This ROM approximates the time in the gait 
cycle when the gluteus maximus shows the highest muscle activity , i.e., from heel contact 
[CONTACT_10782] 20% of stride.[ADDRESS_651785] body weight77 
because of their role in the push -off phase of gait and the strong association of  plantar  flexion 
power and walking speed.77,138-142  The intensity of strength training will be determined during 
Day 1 of intervention at the participant ’s residence. The PT will determine the amount of 
resistance the participant  can push against so that s/he can complete a maximum of  eight 
repetitions (eight  repetitions maximum (RM) or 8-RM). 8 -RM was chosen because it is strongly 
related to the 1 -RM143 and determining the 8 -RM will allow the PT to know the training intensity 
without further sub -calculations (e.g. 80% of the 1 -RM). Studies have shown that the [ADDRESS_651786] session through the 
remainder of the program, participants will perform 3 sets of 8 repetitions at an intensity of the 8 -
CAP Protocol version 12.0  28 Figure 3. Shuttle Device (arrows indicate direction of lower extremity motion)  
  
   
3a   3b   
3c   
 RM. The PT will  
provide strong 
verbal 
encouragement 
during each 
repetition for the 
participant to 
move as “fast and 
as hard as possible” during the concentric phase and to move slowly and in a controlled way in 
the eccentric phase. Intensity will be reviewed every two we eks. 
 
The participants will be supi[INVESTIGATOR_505186]: the combination of hip and knee extension 
exercise (leg press) and the hip abduction exercise (Figure 3a & 3b). The device  will be placed 
on the bed or floor (if the participant  is able to be assiste d safely to and from the floor) so that 
the participant’s foot will rest on the footplate and the hip will be flexed to 90°. The participant 
will push the leg out into full hip and knee extension against the pre -determined resistance. For 
the hip abductors , the participant will start in 5° of adduction and move 15° into abduction. The 
participant’s foot will be strapped to the footplate as the participant moves the leg outward.  
 
Balance and strength will be addressed with two additional exercises performed  in standing. 
Balance will be addressed by [CONTACT_505284] -legged activities or to stand 
upright with a decreased base of support. The first exercise that combines balance training and 
strength training  will be standing hip extension (Figure 3c). The leg will be flexed approximately 
35° of flexion and the participant will extend to neutral position. Upright balance  will be 
challenged as the participant  moves the carriage of the exercise device with one leg as the 
other leg maintains st ability.  
 
The second exercise that combines balance and strength training  will be standing plantar  
flexion. Initially, participant s will be asked to decrease their standing base of support by [CONTACT_505285]. This ex ercise also strengthens the plantar  flexors. Balance and strength  
will be progressively challenged by [CONTACT_505286].  For hip 
extension and plantar flexion, the person may hold lightly onto an assistive device for balance or 
support. The PT will encourage the participant to use less external support for balance during 
each session. Resistance (load in pounds) and repetitions for each  exercise performed will be 
recorded in a training log .29   
 
HR will be measured by [CONTACT_505287] 20 minutes of continuous exercise. The PT will calculate the HR training zone 
based on the heart rate reserve (HRR) method (HR max -HR rest) multiplied by 50% and then 
added to HR rest. HR max will be calculated as 220 m inus the participant’s age. This 
prescription is consistent with moderate intensity exercise and has been shown to increase 
aerobic capacity in elders.147-149 If the person is taking medication that controls heart rate (e.g., 
beta-blockers), Borg’s Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale will be used.150  The training 
intensity using the RP E scale will be “moderate” work as consistent with a 3 -5 on the 0 -10 scale.   
 
The endurance intervention will begin initially with two to three minutes of continuous upper and 
lower extremity AROM with the participant sitting. These exercises are intended  to increase the 
participants’ HR or exertion closer to the target zone. The participant will then be asked to walk 
on level surfaces and up and down one or more steps, if able and available, to keep the HR 
within the training zone for 20 minutes. The PT c an also engage the participant in additional 
exercises such as upper and lower extremity AROM  exercises to keep the HR elevated. The 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  29 target HR will be 30% of HRR in the first week of the program, 40% of HRR in the second week, 
and 50% of HRR in weeks [ADDRESS_651787] 
approximately 20 -30 minutes.  
 
The second part of the session will use sensor y level electrical stimulation to the lower extremity 
muscle groups.  The TENS portion of intervention is intended to decrease pain and increase 
muscle recruitment thereby [CONTACT_505248].  Conventional TENS uses low -level 
electrical curre nt to stimulate superficial cutaneous nerve fibers through the skin. The amount of 
current for sensory level stimulation is th e level which the participant detects as a "tingling" 
sensation and is not high enough to produce a visible muscle contraction (be low motor 
threshold).5 To achieve sensory level stimulation, we will use a frequency of 80 pulses per 
second, pulse duration 50 µsec, and amplitude which produces a comfortable paresthesia 
(tingling or 'pi[INVESTIGATOR_5625]' sensation).  Flexible carbonized, disposable electrodes co ated 
with a self -adhesive conductive polymer will be applied to the skin. The electrodes will be placed 
bilaterally near the motor points on muscle bellies (the gluteal complex, the quadriceps, and the 
gastrocnemius) for seven minutes per muscle group. The  muscle regions selected are important 
for function after hip fracture.  Repetitions and duration of the AROM program, as well as TENS 
intensity will be recorded in the training log.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_651788] to: (1) design, which focuses on whether 
the interventions are consistent with underlying theories, and whether the study is free of 
contamination such as treatment crossover or unintended motivational interventions; (2) 
training, which addresses skill acquisition and maintenance in PTs; (3) delivery, or the 
assessment that the two interventions were implemented as intended; (4) receipt, which focuses 
on whe ther or not the participant understood and received the intervention as intended.  Overall, 
treatment fidelity data will provide information on the adherence of the PTs to the interventions, 
and the adherence of the participants to the prescribed activitie s.  Monitoring treatment fidelity 
also will provide an opportunity to address potential study problems, such as drift from the 
intervention protocols which could threaten the study’s ability to detect treatment differences.  
 
9.5.1  Initial Training for Procedural  Reliability  
The Intervention Monitor (IM) will train PTs in either PUSH  intervention or PULSE  intervention 
procedures.  In order to minimize crossover, the PTs will only be trained on one intervention. 
There will be separate training sessions for each intervention and the PTs will not know the 
details of the other intervention.  
 
Knowledge of proc edures will be tested by [CONTACT_505288].  The IM will document that PTs are “CAP certified PTs” and provide a 
certificate of completion after they demonstrate competence on the written exam and video 
observation.  PTs also need to bring evidence to the training session that they are currently 
CAP Protocol version 12.[ADDRESS_651789] Observation: Direct observations of PTs as they perform the interventions will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_505289]. 
The coordinators will document their observations using a structured checklist that 
addresses data completeness, physical performance, qualitative observations, and verbal 
and non -verbal communication. In the PUSH  intervention group, the checklist will also 
document whether the participant completed the necessary repetitions at the appropriate 
intensity and whether the participant completed [ADDRESS_651790] for the PULSE intervention group will document that the participants 
completed the AROM exercises, had electrodes placed appropriately, and received the 
TENS at the appropriate level and for the proper amount of time. There will be two 
observation visits during the P T’s first assigned participant’s 16-week intervention period  
and then one observation per quarter for PTs who have conducted a  complete [ADDRESS_651791] is less than 
90%, the IM a nd clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_10718]. A remediation plan will be proposed that will 
offer refresher training to ensure accurate understanding of the protocol, follow -up 
observation visits, and possible dismissal if warranted.     
 
Mandatory Conference  Calls  with PTs: The IM will conduct monthly telephone calls with the 
PTs who are currently active with participants. The Treatment Fidelity Manager will take 
minutes of the telephone meetings to document ongoing training. During these calls (which 
will be done separately for the PTs in the two groups), the IM will ask questions to identify 
problems with delivering the intervention. If problems are identified, the IM will schedule an 
individual telephone call and review of PT log books. Additional follow -up will be mandated if 
there are modifications to the exercise prescription that are due to PT factors. A remediation 
plan will be followed if there is ongoing lack of progress.  
 
Periodic Review of Intervention Logs:  Clinical site coordinators will review PT inter vention 
logs when the PTs come to the study office to pi[INVESTIGATOR_505187]. The coordinator will note if PTs are completing logs and if there are 
modifications to the intervention protocols. This information will be sent to the IM for 
discussion during the monthly phone calls.  
 
IM Site Visits: The IM will visit each site semi -annually to meet with all the PTs, with 
separate meetings for each intervention group. This will be a team building visit emphasizing 
proper delivery of the intervention and discussing issues specific to the site.   
 
9.5.3  Monitoring Physiologic Response  
As a measure of treatment fidelity, we will monitor physiologic response (heart rate) during the 
intervention sess ions using Polar heart rate monitors. The monitors will be worn by [CONTACT_505290]. The Polar monitor allows the operator to indicate the 
start and end of distinct time segments referred to as “laps” by [CONTACT_8121]’s software s ystem. 
Each intervention session will consist of four laps, defined as follows:   
CAP Protocol version 12.0  31  
Lap PUSH Intervention  PULSE Intervention  
1 Greeting, health questions, BP, HR  Greeting, health questions, BP, HR  
2 Strength training, BP, HR  AROM training, BP, HR  
3 Endurance training  TENS  
4 Wrap -up Wrap -up 
BP=blood pressure; HR=heart rate; AROM=active range of motion; TENS=transcutaneous 
electrical nerve stimulation.  
 
The Polar monitoring will provide a dichotomous variable reflecting whether, during laps 2 and 3 
of each intervention session, the participant’s average HR was equal to or greater than his or 
her target heart rate (±5 beats). The target heart rate is defined as 50% of heart rate reserve 
and is calculated as follows:  
 
Target HR=(((220 -age) – RHR)*0.5)+ RHR, where RHR=resting heart rate.  
 
In addition, the IM will perform ongoing qualitative reviews of the HR curves that are generated 
by [CONTACT_19915]. She will examine the duration of the laps as well as the pattern of activity within 
the laps (height of cu rve, duration of the rise in HR, number of times HR rises within a lap) and 
compare them to pre -specified criteria established for each intervention. If the pattern of HR 
curves deviates from the pre -established expectations, she will confer with the PT re garding the 
possible reasons and implement appropriate actions as necessary.  
 
9.6 Scheduling Intervention Visits  
There are three requirements for scheduling of intervention visits:  
1. The first intervention visit should occur on Day 7 or earlier, where the day of randomization = 
Day 0.    
2. The schedule of intervention visits is anchored to the date of randomization regardless of 
when the intervention starts.   
3. Intervention visits s hould never occur on two consecutive days, even when moving from one 
week to the next.  
 
For all randomized participants, Week [ADDRESS_651792] -randomization, whichever is earlier.  Subsequent weeks wi ll start on the same day of 
the week as Week 1. For example, if the participant’s first intervention visit is on a Wednesday, 
each intervention week for that participant will extend from Wednesday to Tuesday (inclusively).  
Alternatively, if the first visi t has not yet occurred by [CONTACT_2006] 7 and Day 7 is a Monday, then the 
participant’s intervention weeks will extend from Monday to Sunday (inclusively).  
 
In certain circumstances (e.g., illness, travel), the first intervention visit may be scheduled after 
Day 7.  
 
Ideally participants will receive [ADDRESS_651793] -randomization (32 visits 
total). However, m issed visits in a given week can be replaced by [CONTACT_505291] (not to exceed 3 visits in any given week) as long as the vi sits are on non -consecutive 
days. If the participant has not had 32 visits by [CONTACT_5638] 16 weeks, makeup  visits can be 
performed during the subsequent two weeks to get as close as possible to the target of 32 
visits.  
 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  32 Section 10:  Study Measures  
A list of st udy measur es is provided below. All of the measures will be interview -based or based 
on observations of performance or physiological assessments. No proxy data will be allowed at 
baseline. However, at the 16 -week follow -up visit, a proxy may be contact[CONTACT_505292]’s walking ability. This information will be used as part of the 
adjudication process, as described in section 11.5.   Also, the four -week phone calls will be 
conducted with a proxy when the participant is not available . 
 
In the description  of measures  below, we identify the measures that will not be collected for 
participants consented under protocol v ersion 11.0 or later . 
 
10.1 Screening Evaluations  
There will be three primary components to the screening process: the chart review in the acute 
care setting (phase 1), the phase 2  screen , and screening for final eligibility (phase 3) that 
includes calculated BMI, the 3MS, and the SMWT.  These components will be typi[INVESTIGATOR_505188], in-person or by [CONTACT_756] (phase 2) .  Those who qualify after 
phases [ADDRESS_651794] clinic visit for phase 3 screening (see section 7.5). 
 
10.1.1  Weight, Height , and BMI  
Height (in feet and inches ) will be measured o nce at the baseline visit using a standard 
stadiometer. Weight (in pounds ) will be measured using a digital scale at baseline and at each 
follow -up visit.  Measured height and weight will be used to calculate BMI.  
 
10.1.2  Modified Mini -Mental State Examination (3 MS) 
The 3MS is a test of global cognitive function which assesses a broad variety of cognitive 
dimensions and is an expanded 100 point version of the original Folstein Mini -Mental State 
Exam.153,154 The 3MS will be used at the baseline visit to identify and exclude participants with 
cognitive impairment  (3MS score <73) .155     
 
10.2 Primary Outcome Measure: Community Ambulation  
The primary study outcome reflects the concept of a minimum distance a person needs to be 
able to walk to carry out usual activities in the community. This will be defined as achieving the 
threshold value of 300 meters or more on the SMWT.  
 
Performance of the SMWT at the baseline assessment also will be used to define final eligibility 
prior to the collection of additional baseline data.  Participants who walk less than four meters in 
40 seconds (<0.1 m/sec) or who walk 300 meters  or more  in six minutes will be excluded from 
the trial.  Participants with angina , extreme shortness of breath , or ambulating with severe pain  
during the SMWT also will be excluded.  
 
Participants will be asked t o walk back and forth on a measured path marked clearly at both 
ends for turning purposes, while being told when each minute has passed, and receiving verbal 
encouragement (“you’re doing well” or “keep up the good work”) every [ADDRESS_651795] 
reliability in older adults is excellent (r = .95).107 Concurren t validity with V0 2 peak (r=.64) and 
cycle ergometry (r=.58) have been reported.105,156,157   
 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  33 10.3 Secondary Outcome Measures - Precursors to Community Ambulation  
 
10.3.1  Endurance  
To as sess endurance, t he SMWT (described above) will be used to obtain  a continuous 
measure of total distance walked in six minutes .[ADDRESS_651796] maximal 
treadmill or cycle ergometry exercise tests.31,159   
 
10.3.2  Balance   
We will use an enhanced balance measure that includes  the balance subscale of the Short 
Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and two additional single leg stands (eyes open and eyes 
closed), as use d in the National Health and Aging Trends Study  (NHATS ).[ADDRESS_651797] of 
standing balance, participants are asked to maintain balance  in three positions, characterized 
by a progressive narrowing of the base support: with feet together (side -by-side position), the 
heel of one foot beside the big toe of the other foot (semi -tandem position), and the heel of one 
foot in front of and touchi ng the toes of the other foot (tandem position). For each of the three 
positions, participants are timed to a maximum of 10 seconds. Participants are then asked to 
stand on one leg (on the side of the fracture) with eyes open and again with eyes closed. Ea ch 
of the single leg stands are held for up to 30 seconds. The number of seconds is then summed 
across the 5 items to obtain the measure of balance. These tests are hierarchical such that 
when a participant fails an item, the harder ones are not administer ed and receive a score of 0 . 
 
10.3.3  Quadriceps  Muscle Strength  
Isometric force for bilateral knee extensors will be measured with a portable, hand -held 
dynamometer (Microfet2 Manual Muscle Tester).  Participants will be seated on the strength 
testing chair , with  hip flexion 90° and  knee flexed to 70°, stabilization straps on the pelvis and 
thigh, and resistance applied just proximal to the ankle on the anterior surface of the leg .[ADDRESS_651798] reliability with hand -held dynamometry is excellent (r>.90) if tested in one session and in 
subjects with muscle weakness (intraclass correlation coefficient  ≥ .90).162-[ADDRESS_651799] (mPPT)165 will be used to measure lower 
extremity function at baseline and follow -up. The modification, used by [CONTACT_201209]., substitutes 
a chair -rise task and a balance task for writing and eating tasks, in order to emphasize lower 
extremity function.68  The modified PPT includes nine standardized tasks that will be timed (e.g., 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_85354] a penny from the floor, standing up five times from a 16 -inch chair). The tasks are 
performed twice and the times from t he two trials are averaged. The score for each item ranges 
from [ADDRESS_651800] Effectiveness: Health Care Utilization  
Resource utilization will be tracked every four weeks via telephone interview and unit costs will 
be assigned to each resource for which data are obtained.  Resource use will reflect health ca re 
use (including both formal and informal care)  since the last telephone interview . This interview 
will be patterned after that used in the NIH -sponsored Spi[INVESTIGATOR_246922] 
(SPORT).[ADDRESS_651801] the desirability for health  outcomes on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 1 
(best imaginable health state). To estimate QALYs, health state values will be obtained using 
the SF -6D health state classification system ,167 which defines health states using participant 
responses to the SF -36 (described below). QALYs estimated using SF -6D are consistent with 
recommendations to use societal values in economic evaluations in health and medicine.[ADDRESS_651802] utilized SF -36 in similar hip fracture populations.  
 
Costs associated with par ticipant -reported resource utilization will be estimated using the 
Resource -Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS)168-170, which is used by [CONTACT_505293] (CMS) to reimburse physicians for their services.  This ap proach has the 
advantage of reflecting national fee schedules and relating them to the RBRVS.  To estimate 
costs of other health care services not consistently covered by [CONTACT_170311], providers will be 
surveyed on charges for services at the geographic locati ons involved in this study.  For each 
item, units of utilization will be multiplied by [CONTACT_505294]. To estimate indirect costs, information about informal caregivers’ employment status 
and job class will be obt ained at baseline. This will allow for estimation of the indirect economic 
costs associated with informal caregiving. Costs associated with providing the interventions will 
be estimated based on the amount of physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_505189].  
 
This measure will not be collected for participants consented under protocol version 11.0 or 
later. 
 
10.4 Tertiary  Outcomes  
A series of outcomes that are relevant for the recovering hip fracture participant also will be 
evaluated. These were selected since: 1) all are affected by a hip fracture; and 2) all are 
important in understanding the degree to which hip fracture patients  recover.  
 
10.4.1  Activities of Daily Living (ADL s) 
We will measure ADLs  using the Pepper Assessment Tool for Disability (PAT -D)171,[ADDRESS_651803], two items (walking a quarter mile and walking across a small room) were 
added to address perceived gaps in the original PAT -D scale. This modification is consistent 
with the version used in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders study .173  
Second, two items (walking several blocks and lifting heavy objects) were deleted to avoid 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  35 duplication with other items in the scale. The resulting 19 -item scale allows examination of three 
subscales (bas ic ADL, functional limitations, and instrumental ADL).  
 
This measure will not be collected for participants consented under protocol version 11.0 or 
later. 
 
10.4.2  Quality of Life (SF -36) 
We will use an interviewer -administered version of the SF -36, a health survey that assesses 
quality of life in eight subscales (physical function, social function, role -physical, role -emotional, 
bodily pain, mental health, general health, and vitality) .174  The measure has be en validated as a 
generic measure of quality of life in many different populations, including patient and non -patient 
samples.174 68,175,176   
 
This measure will not be collected for participants consented under protocol version 11.0 or 
later. 
 
10.4.3  Balance Confidence  
The Activities -specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale177 is a [ADDRESS_651804] reliability, internal consistency, and concurrent validity with fall  and physical activity 
are high.177,178 This measure has been used successfully in hip fracture patients.32,179  
 
This measure will not be collected for participants consented under protocol version 11.0 or 
later.  
  
10.4.4  Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS)  
This interviewer -administered questionnaire includes five categories of common activities 
related to work, exercise, and recreation performed during a typi[INVESTIGATOR_505190] .180 
The YPAS increases the sensitivity of other physical activity surveys by [CONTACT_76725] a wider 
range of lower intensity activities that older adults often engage in.  Participation in each activity 
(hrs/week) will be multiplied by [CONTACT_505295] (kcal/min) and then summed over all activities 
to calculate a weekly energy expenditure summary. The measure has been validated against 
several physiological variables of habitual activity.180,[ADDRESS_651805] 50 meters in the distance walked on the SMWT 
will be assessed as a tertiary outcome. This distance has been shown to be clinically 
meaningful .183,184 
 
10.4.6  Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)  
The SPPB evaluates lower extremity performance in older persons based on timed short 
distance walk, re peated chair stands, and a set of balance tests .184-[ADDRESS_651806] occurred. The SPPB components and total 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  36 score are derived from normative values obtained from a population -based study .184,186  The 
total score ranges from 0 to 12; there are three subscales  embedded in the SPPB.   
 
Standing balance.  For the test of standing balance, participants are asked to maintain 
balance in three positions, characterized by a progressive narrowing of the base support:, 
with feet together (side -by-side position), the heel of one foot beside the big toe of the other  
foot (semi -tandem position), and the heel of one foot in front of and touching the toes of the 
other foot (tandem position). For each of the three positions, participants are timed to a 
maximum of 10 seconds.   
 
Walking speed . Walking speed is assessed by  [CONTACT_505296] a 4 m course. Participants are instructed to stand with both feet touching the 
starting line and to start walking after a specific verbal command. Participants are allowed to 
use walking aids (cane, wal ker, or other walking aid) if necessary, but not the assistance of 
another person. Timing begins as soon as  the participant  starts to walk and the time in 
seconds needed to complete the entire distance is recorded. The faster of two walks is used 
to compute walking speed.  
 
Chair stands.  The repeated chair stands test is performed using a straight -backed chair, 
which is placed with its back a gainst a wall. Participants are first asked to stand once from a 
sitting position with their arms folded across their chest. If they are able to perform the task, 
they are then asked to stand up and sit down five times, as quickly as possible. The time to 
complete the task is recorded.  
 
10.4.7  Depressi ve Symptoms   
Depressive symptoms  will be measured  using the 20 -item Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_87963] (CES -D) scale ,[ADDRESS_651807] -fracture is delayed in the presence of 
depression.188-191 This scale ranges from 0 -60 with higher scores indicating greater depressi on.   
 
10.4.8  Cognitive Status  
Cognitive status will be assessed at follow -up using the 3MS  (see section  10.1.2 ). 
 
This measure will not be collected for participants consented under protocol version 11.0 or 
later. 
 
10.4.9  Nutritional Status  
Nutritional status will be assessed using the Min i Nutritional Assessment -Short Form (MNA® -
SF),6,192 a validated and widely used malnutrition screening tool.192-195 We are using a modified 
version of the MNA®, approved by [CONTACT_227417]’s developer (the Nestlé company) , to facilitate use 
as an interviewer -administered tool in a research setting. Scores range from 0 to 14; 
participants scoring ≤7 will be considered malnourished; those scoring 8 -11 will be considered 
to be at risk of malnutrition; and those scoring [ADDRESS_651808] normal 
nutritional status.6,192   
 
This measure will not be collected at follow -up for participants consented under protocol version 
12.0 or later . 
 
10.5  Clinical and Background Characteristics  
Information on a small number of other patient characteristics will be collected to allow 
description of the study population, to allow analyses of differential effects in subgroups (i.e., 
CAP Protocol version 12.[ADDRESS_651809] modification), and to help in the interpretation of results.    
 
10.5.1  Demographic and Surgical Characteristics  
For descriptive purposes, information on the following participant characteristics will be collected 
either during screening or at the baseline assessment: age, gender, race, living situation, marital 
status, ed ucational level, fracture type, and surgery type.  
 
10.5.2  Functional Comorbidity Index  
The Functional Comorbidity Index (FCI) is a clinically based measure developed by [CONTACT_505297].   
This index includes a checklist of [ADDRESS_651810] -Revised  (LOT -R)  
The LOT -R assesses self -reported optimism and pessimism. A total of six brief statements is 
read to the participant, and response categories range from strongly disagree to strongly agree 
on a 5 -point Likert type scale; three items measure optimism and three items measure 
pessimism.197 
 
Brief Resilience Scale  
The Brief Resilience Scale assesses self -reported ability to bounce back after a stressful event. 
A total of six brief statements is read, and response categories rang e from strongly disagree to 
strongly agree on a 5 -point Likert -type scale .198 
 
10.6  Other Measures to be Monitored  
 
10.6.1  Adherence  
Adherence with PT interventions.   PTs will submit a visit form for each of the 32 visits that 
records date of visit; start and end time of the visit; reason for missed visit; what activities were 
performed; and whether activities were performe d as prescribed. For the PUSH  group, w e will 
also obtain information about the intensity of each activity at initiation of the intervention and 
every four weeks during the intervention period. Logs completed by [CONTACT_505298]. Reasons for protocol variations will be noted in the PT log books.  
 
Additionally, at the end of each intervention visit, the PT will retrieve the average HRs for laps [ADDRESS_651811] them in the logbook and on the 
appropriate data forms. The Polar heart rate monitoring will pro vide a dichotomous variable 
reflecting whether, during laps 2 and 3 of each intervention session, the participant’s average 
HR was equal to or greater than his or her target heart rate (±5 beats). In addition, the IM will 
perform ongoing qualitative review s of the HR curves to ensure that the pattern of activity is 
consistent with pre -specified criteria established for each intervention.  
 
Adherence with study vitamins/supplements.   Vitamin D, calcium, and multivitamin adherence 
will be monitored by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_505191] -
report during the 4 -week telephone calls for the entire 16-week  study period . 
 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  38 In protocol v ersion 11.0, we will eliminate the collection of information on use of study -provided 
dietary supplements. However, procedures for drug accountability will remain  unchanged (see 
section 3.2.3 ).  
 
10.6.[ADDRESS_651812] digital scale.   
 
10.6.3  Reportable  Adverse Events  (RAEs)  
Reportable adverse events (RAEs), which include serious adverse events (SAEs ), unexpected 
AEs or injury that occurs under supervision by [CONTACT_464], will also be obtained during the study. 
These events will be tracked in a separate database by [CONTACT_145859].  RAEs  will be captured every 
four weeks during the telephone interviews u sing standardized questions on the Reportable  
Adverse Events Form .  Participants (or their proxies) will be asked about life -threatening or 
significant medical events and the outcomes of these events .  RAEs  will also be asked about  by 
[CONTACT_505299] -up assessment .  RAEs  may be 
spontaneously reported to any study staff member throughout the study  (see section  13.4.1 ).   
 
10.6.4  Expected Adverse Events  (AEs)  
Expected AEs will be assessed every four weeks during  the telephone interview.  Participants 
(or their proxies) will be asked a series of standardized questions related to pain  (feet, hip, back, 
knee s); breathing problems or chest pain; skin irritations , rash , or skin tears; numbness or 
tingling ; and falls (with and without injury) .

11.4 Timing of Study Procedures  
The target  date for completion of the pre -randomization (i.e., screening) assessments will be 
anchored to the date of admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_505172].  The target  date for completion 
of all other assessm ents will be anchored to the date of randomization  (see Table 1).   
 
CAP Protocol version 12.[ADDRESS_651816] -randomization  +[ADDRESS_651817]-randomization  +[ADDRESS_651818] -randomization  -1 week, +3 weeks

randomization  -1 week, +[ADDRESS_651819] -randomization  +[ADDRESS_651820] in a non -study clinical facility or, failing that, at another non -
study location or the participant’s home. All cases for which, despi[INVESTIGATOR_299094], 
administration of the SMWT is not possible will be submitted for adjudication. See Figure 4.  
 
Although there is an absence of highly sensitive and specific surrogate measures for the ability 
to walk ≥ [ADDRESS_651821] that there are factors that are highly 
predictive of the inability  to walk at that speed. Therefore, the purpose of the adjudication will be 
to reduce the number of participants with missing outcomes by [CONTACT_505300]. Based on the adjudication, participants who 
meet one or more of the following criteria at the follow -up assessment will be classified as 
treatment failures in the primary analysis for the g iven follow -up time:  
 
1) Participant died  
2) Participant was too sick, based on adjudicators’ review of source documentation, to walk 
300 m or more in six minutes  
3) Gait speed based on SPPB four -meter walk was less than 0.6 m/s (very slow speed 
incompatible with ability to walk 300 m in six minutes)  
4) Participant or proxy reports (a) participant limitation in walking several blocks or (b) in 
walking across a small room without help from another person  
 
Criterion 4a is an item from the Activity Limitations section of  the SF -36 and was chosen 
because, in a previous hip fracture study performed by [CONTACT_27156], 100% of 27 participants 
meeting the criterion were unable to walk 300 m or more in six minutes (unpublished data). 
Also, in that study, 85% of 26 participants who h ad a missing SMWT reported this level of 
walking limitation, suggesting that use of this item will allow us to assign a classification to a 
large proportion of those who were not tested on the SMWT. Criterion 4b is an item from the 
Pepper Assessment Tool f or Disability and was chosen because it has high face validity for 
predicting treatment failure. To improve our ability to classify the outcome status of participants 
whose SMWT was not administered, we will make intensive efforts to obtain self - or proxy -
CAP Protocol version 12.0  41 reported information on these two items in person or by [CONTACT_756], even when other data 
cannot be collected at the given follow -up time.  
 
There will be three adjudicators, all experts in mobility assessment and the clinical management 
of older persons. Eac h adjudication case will be randomly assigned to two of the adjudicators 
who will independently review all the relevant documents and classify participants as treatment 
failures or indeterminate. If the two adjudicators disagree on the classification, the case will be 
discussed in a meeting with the two adjudicators. If there is no consensus after discussion 
between the two assigned adjudicators, the case will be discussed in a meeting with all three 
adjudicators. Discrepancies will be resolved by a vote if  the three adjudicators cannot reach a 
consensus. To monitor the adjudication process, an unblinded statistician will calculate, among 
the cases submitted for adjudication, the outcome of adjudication (proportion classified as 
failure and indeterminate), b y treatment group. The incorporation of adjudication results into the 
analysis plan is described in Section 15.1.  
 
Cases  where the SMWT was adminis tered but not according to protocol (e.g., using a walking 
course of less than 10 m) will also be submitted for adjudication. The adjudicators will review the 
description of the circumstances and outcome of the testing as recorded by [CONTACT_505301]’s classification (treatment success or treatment failure) based 
on the distance walked is valid. If not, the participant will be classified as ‘indeterminate’. For 
simplicity, this part of the process is not depi[INVESTIGATOR_505192] e 4.

12.1.3  Safety Considerations for the PUSH  Intervention  
There is no expectation that the PUSH  intervention will evoke serious cardiovascular responses; 
however, participants will be warned of a possible risk. Cardiac events are rare, with estimates 
of one event per 60,000 participant -hours in aerobic exercise programs .200  No signific ant 
cardiac events were reported after performing 1 -RM testing for over 6600 healthy subjects.201 
The American Heart Association’s guidelines for resistance training for adults with and without 
cardiovascular disease reports the safety of high intensity resistance training and te sting in 
persons with coronary disease which found an absence of anginal symptoms, ischemic ST -
segment depression, abnormal hemodynamics, complex ventricular dysrhythmias, and 
cardiovascular complications.202,[ADDRESS_651824] been designed to minimize this risk. The risk 
of inducing a compression fracture  will be minimized because the exercises are performed in 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_505195].204 The PT will also remind 
the participant to minimize flexion to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_201168]. Using an exercise 
device that eliminates the risk of weights falling on a person, and using only voluntary muscle 
contractio ns during isometric testing, will reduce the risk of lower extremity fracture. We do not 
anticipate additional risk for the PUSH  intervention for the following reasons: 1) by [ADDRESS_651825]-fracture, there is moderate stability from the bone callus formatio n, 2) participants will only 
be included if they have medical clearance to participate in full weight bearing activities, and 3) 
the device  limit is 100 pounds (which in most cases is less than body weight) resulting in less 
load than walking up and down s tairs. Delayed onset muscle soreness is a common occurrence 
after the initiation of an exercise program. The soreness occurs in the muscle belly [ADDRESS_651826] their primary care provider (PCP) as necessary. 
Please see Table 3 below for a  summary of alerts and appropriate action during the PT 
intervention visits.  
 
12.1.4  Safety Measures during the PUSH  Intervention  
The PUSH  intervention  will be conduc ted in the participant’s place of residence and all sessions  
will be conducted and supervised by [CONTACT_505302], who monitor potential adverse experiences 
and symptoms. PTs  will be trained to de al with medical emergencies that occur d uring the 
PUSH  sessions and  will be CPR certified . Also, community EMS services  will be activated if 
needed.  
 
In order to  minimize discomfort and maximize safety, participants will be taught the proper 
method for performing each exercise and the importance of following the proper method. 
Intensity is gradually increased, and exercise technique is commented on during each ses sion. 
Participants will be instructed to talk with the PTs about any muscle soreness, pain or 
discomfort.  
 
Every effort will be made to prevent harm by  [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_505196], dizziness, significant shortness of breath, or severe musculoskeletal pain .  
PTs will monitor blood pressure at the start of the training session, mid -session, and when 
participants are finished with the session. Blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored using 
a standard b lood pressure cuff and palpation of peripheral pulse. If blood pressure is elevated 
above 1 70/100, the participant will rest quietly for a few minutes. The PT will monitor the 
participant  for signs of muscle strain, dizziness, or hypotension and appropriat e palliative 
methods will be discussed with the participants and appropriate medical referrals will be made .

12.1.6  Safety Measures for the PULSE  Intervention  
The intervention visits  will be conduc ted in the participant’s place of residence and all sessions  
will be conducted and supervised by [CONTACT_505302], who monitor potential adverse experiences 
and symptoms. PTs  will be trained to de al with medical emergencies that occur d uring the 
CAP Protocol version 12.[ADDRESS_651831] low calcium and vitamin D intake.205  Individuals enrolled in the study will 
be screened with the MNA® -SF and if their scores indicate that they are malnourished , they will 
receive in -person nutritional counseling by a registered dietician.  Individuals enrolled that have 
a serum albumin value 2.5 -3.5 will also receive in -person nutritional counseling by a registered 
dietician, r egardless of score on the MNA® -SF. Participants who are at risk or not at risk for 
malnutrition will receive a telephone consultation from the dietician on maintaining proper diet. 
The RD will schedule an in -person visit for those at risk if he/she feels i t is necessary based on 
the telephone consultation, All subjects will receive vitamin D, calcium, and multivitamin 
supplementation  for the 16-week  study period , all of which represent best practices for this 
disabled group of participants.  There are small  risks associated with vitamin D, calcium, and 
multivitamins including gastrointestinal complaints (including mild constipation or diarrhea, 
stomach upset) and kidney stones.  Those with a calculated creatinine clearance <30 ml/min , 
elevated total or ionized calcium,  or history of kidney stones , primary hyperparathyroidism, or 
sarcoidosis will not receive calcium supplements. A participant who experiences an epi[INVESTIGATOR_505197].   
 
12.1.8  Safety Measures for the Nutritional Intervention  
If a participant loses 2% or more body weight in a four -week period, the participant will be 
referred to the registered dietician for follow -up by [CONTACT_756].  In the event that a weight 
measurement is not obtai ned at the last PT visit, the participant’s weight at the 16 -week follow -
up assessment will be compared to his or her baseline weight and, i f there is weight loss of 5% 
or more, the clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_505185]’s weight trajectory, 
baseline BMI, baseline MNA® -SF score, and registered dietician’s documentation and, if 
warranted based on clinical judgment, will refer the participant to a dietician or medical provider 
for follow -up of possible poor nutritional status.  
CAP Protocol version 12.0  49 12.2 Confidentiality  
Confidentiality of data will be maintained by [CONTACT_505303]. Safeguards will be established to ensure the 
security and privacy of participants’ study records.  Data will be stored in locked files and on 
computer disks, with access limited to the investigators and key study personnel. Computer 
data files will not include participant names, addresses, initials, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329177], or any 
other personal identif iers. Computer security procedures, including multiple levels of password 
protection will be instituted. Data for publication will be presented only in aggregate form, 
preventing identification of individual participants. After the study is completed, loca l data will be 
archived in a secured storage area.  
 
In compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the 
Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information of the Department of Health 
and Human Services, CAP will access personal health information and medical records only 
after receiving approval for a HIPAA Partial Privacy Waiver for Recruitment.  Only information 
necessary for determining eligibility will be obtained.   
12.3 Participant Education abo ut Potential Risks  
Potential risks associated with study -related activities and interventions will be explained to 
each participant by [CONTACT_505304]. Each 
participant will be instructed to report the occurrence  of an AE to appropriate study staff at 
scheduled data collection times, to PTs administering the intervention, or spontaneously at any 
other time. Participants also will be encouraged to report concerns about the safety of 
participating in the CAP study.   
 
 
Section 13:  Reportable  Adverse Events (RAEs) and Expected Adverse 
Events  (AEs)  
 
13.1 Overview  
In this study we will capture study -defined expected  adverse events ( AEs) through structured 
telephone interviews with blinded assessors every four weeks. Reportable AEs  (RAEs)  are 
defined as serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs that have potential implications for participant 
safety, unexpected AEs, and injury  that occur s while a participant is under the supervision of 
study related personnel. These RAEs  will require individual e vent reporting as described in 
section 13.4.  The timely and complete account of RAEs  will be a critical requirement for the 
protection of human subjects in the CAP trial.     
 
The CAP DSMB will review and approve study -defined expecte d AEs and will be involved in 
regular monitoring of the RAE reporting system.  Study -wide reporting of expected AEs to the 
CCC, the DSMB, the NIA, and the clinical site IRBs will be mediated through a central database.  
RAEs  will be monitored and tracked s eparately by [CONTACT_505305]  13.8. 
                                                                                                              
Clinical site staff will have responsibility for reporting RAEs  to their own local IRB according to 
local policies.  
 
CAP Protocol version 12.[ADDRESS_651832], including any abnormal sign, symptom, 
or disease, whether or not related to participation in the research   
 
For the purposes of this study, any event that meets the criteria for an SAE, is unexpected, or 
results in injury  to the participant while s/he is under the supervision of study related personnel 
will be classified as an RAE .   
 
Adequate review, assessment, and monitoring of RAEs  require that they be classified as to 
severity, expectedness, and potential relatedness to the study intervention.   
 
13.2.1  Severity  
The following guidelines will be used to determine level of severity:  
 
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and causing no loss of time from 
normal activities. No specific medical intervention is required.  
 
Moderate : Discomfort enough to cause a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
participant and may  interfere with daily activities. Symptoms m ay require minimal, local, or 
noninvasive medical intervention only.  
 
Severe:   Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and are usually incapacitating. 
Significant symptoms may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_505198].  
 
Life threatening : Events that may involve acute, life -threatening metabolic or cardiovascular 
complications (such as circulatory failure, hemorrhage, sepsis) or life -threatening physiological 
consequences. Intensi ve care or emergent invasive procedure is required.  
 
Fatal : Causing death.  
 
Severity is not synonymous with seriousness. A severe headache is not necessarily an RAE.  
However, mild chest pain may result in a day’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_505199]. 
 
13.2.2  Expectedness  
AEs will be assessed as to whether they were expected or unexpected based on current 
knowledge. Categories are:  
 
Expected:  An AE that is anticipated on the basis of prior experience with the intervention under 
investigation; an  event that can be attributed to the underlying condition of the participant being 
studied; or an event that can be attributed to the patient population being studied (see section 
13.3). Expected AEs are captured in a standardized way by [CONTACT_229191].  
 
Unexpected : An AE that was not anticipated on the basis of prior experience with the 
intervention under investigation;  an event that cannot be attributed to the underlying condition of 
the participant being studied or to the patient population; or an expected event whose frequency 
or severity exceeds what was anticipated (see section  13.4.2 ).  Unexpected AEs are reportable.  
 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  51 13.2.3  Relatedness   
An independent safety monitor (ISM) who is blinded to treatment assignment will determine the 
degree to which RAEs  are related to CAP study procedures or to procedures conducted as part 
of an ancillary study to CAP using the criteria shown below.  
 
Definitely related : The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational procedure – i.e., an 
event that follows a reasonable temp oral sequence from administration of the study intervention, 
follows a known or expected pattern of response to the study intervention, that is confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_505200] , and that could 
not be r easonably explained by [CONTACT_82977]’s clinical state.  
 
Possibly related :  An adverse event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study intervention or that follows a known or expected pattern  of response 
to the study intervention, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other 
factors.  
 
Not related :  The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational procedure (i.e., 
another cause of the event is most plausible; an d/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is 
inconsistent with the onset of the event and the study intervention and/or a causal relationship is 
considered biologically implausible).

 foot pain  
 hip pain  
 back pain  
 knee  pain  
 breathing problems  
 chest pain or discomfort  
 skin tears, rash, or skin irritations  
 numbness or tingling  
 fall (with or without injury)  
 
13.[ADDRESS_651834] one of the following categories:  
1. Serious adverse events  (SAEs)  
2. Unexpected AEs, and  
3. Injury that occurs while a participant is under the supervision of study personnel.  
 
Events that cannot be clearly defined as “reportable” will be discussed with the clinical site 
clinician  and clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_505201].  
 
13.4.1  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
SAEs will be defined as any event that:  
 Results in death  
 Is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death (e.g., MI, 
stroke/TIA)  
CAP Protocol version 12.0  52  Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Causes significant disability or incapacity (e.g., torn muscle or ligament)  
 Requires medical or surgical intervention to pre vent significant disability (e.g., hip 
fracture)  
 
SAEs will be captured through telephone interviews every four weeks by [CONTACT_229191], 
using the Reportable  Adverse Events Form .  SAEs will also be assessed  at the beginning of 
each PT visit and clinical  site follow -up visit, and by [CONTACT_505306] a serious 
event.  
 
13.4.2  Unexpected Adverse Event  
Unexpected AEs will be defined as medical events that occur during study participation, but do 
not commonly occur in the CAP study population and which are not listed in the ICF or study 
protocol (section  13.3).  An unexpected AE may be witnessed by a member of the research 
team, or staff may be told about an unexpected event that may meet the criteria for reporting.  
Unexpected AEs that have a pote ntial relationship to study procedures  and activities will be 
captured on an Incident Report and submitted to the clinical site study office where they will be 
logged in the participant binder and then reported to the CCC and the Independent Safety 
Monitor  (ISM).   
 
A reportable unexpected AE will be one that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected, in terms of nature, severity, or frequency, given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and ICF; and (b) the characteristics of the study 
population;  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research ( meaning that there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been 
cause d by [CONTACT_3459]);  
 Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
 
The medical and scientific judgment of the clinical site clinician  and the clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_505202]. In addition, difficulty 
determining whether or not an event is unexpected and/or attributabl e to the intervention will be 
addressed by [CONTACT_71498], who will determine if the event is to be reported.  
 
13.4.3  Injury  that Occur s while Under the Supervision of Study Related Personnel  
Any injury  that occurs while the participant is under the supervision of study -related personnel is 
reportable.  The injury can happen on site (during an assessment visit  or during the conduct of 
an ancillary study to CAP ) or off -site (in the participant’s home during a PT visit or if the study 
offers supervision during transportati on).  These events will be captured on the Reportable 
Adverse Events Form.   
 
13.5 Expected AE and R AE Collection and Reporting  
The requirements for reporting RAEs  will begin when the participant provides informed consent 
and will end 30 days after the particip ant’s involvement in the study has ended. Expected AEs 
will be assessed every four weeks post -randomization.  Figures 5a -d provide algorithms 
describing the reporting process .

The RAE reporting schedule is shown  below:  
1. RAEs  will be reported to the clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_505206].  
2. The clinical site PI (or designee) will redact documents to conceal treatment assignment 
and report all RAEs  to the CCC in writing (by [CONTACT_40743]) within 24 hours of the event 
being reported to the investigator.  
3. The CCC  will report all RAEs  to the DSMB and NIA in writing (by [CONTACT_40743]) within [ADDRESS_651838] the clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_505207]. To ensure the appropriate classification of events, the 
clinical site clinician  and/or clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_505208].  
 
The ISM will be responsible for providing follow -up for ongoing reportable events, as follows:  
 
1. The ISM will follow up on RAEs  until a final status has been determined for the event (e.g., 
recovered, ended in death, is still present, or stat us is unknown). Some RAEs  may have a 
status of still present at the conclusion of the study. These are the categories of RAE status:  
a. ‘Resolved’ is an event that has ended , with or without residual deficits . 
b. ‘Still present’ is an event that is ongoing.  
c. ‘Unknown’ should be used when the site is unable to make contact [CONTACT_505310].  
d. ‘Died’ is for an event that ended in death.  
2. If there are follow -ups to an event (and the event is ongoing), the ISM will use the Reportable 
Event Evaluation and Follow -up Form  to record the event follow -up and submit to the CCC.  
3. Once the event is no longer ongoing and a final status for the event h as been determined, 
the ISM will record the final status, enter the closed date, and sign and date the Reportable 
Adverse Event Evaluation and Follow -up Form that will be submitted to the CCC.  
 
The CCC will be responsible for reporting RAEs  to the DSMB, NI A, and clinical sites, as 
needed.  Clinical sites will be responsible for reporting RAEs  to their respective IRBs according 
to local requirements.  
 
13.6.[ADDRESS_651839] 
the decision to the CCC . The DSMB will be notified of the recommended course of action  by [CONTACT_505311] .  Actions taken in response to the RAE will fall into one of five categories:  
 Study intervention modified  
 Study intervention suspended temporarily  
 Study intervention stopped permanently   Study assessment modified  
 No action taken  
CAP Protocol version 12.[ADDRESS_651840] primary responsibility for the safety of participants as it relates to the study 
protocol.  Clinical site coordinators will be responsible for reviewing RAEs  and assuring 
accurate and timely reporting of RAEs .  Clinical site clinician s will be responsible for reviewing 
RAEs before they are sent to the CCC.  Blinded ISMs will  evaluate and classify RAEs  and 
provide follow -up for events until they are resolved. The DSMB will be responsible for reviewing 
monitoring data for evidence of har m attributable to participation in CAP.  
 
13.7.1  Clinical Site Clinician  
The clinical site clinician  will be available by [CONTACT_505312] -based interventions or at 
clinical assessment sites. In addition, the clinical site clinician  will be responsible for reviewing 
and RAEs  requiring immediate n otification of the IRB and CCC and for being “on call” for study -
related emergencies. The clinical site clinician  may delegate  responsibilities related to 
immediate notification to a “covering” clinician . 
 
13.7.2  Independent Safety Monitor (ISM)  
Physicians serving on the C linical Direction SOC and who are not affiliated with a clinical site 
will serve as ISMs to review RAEs  reported to the CCC on a rotating basis. Other members on 
the Clinical Direction SOC will also serve as an ISM when necessary, but cannot review events 
from their clinical site.  When a RAE is identified by a clinical site the information will be 
redacted  to conceal treatment assignment, reported to the CCC, and then forwarded to the on -
call ISM to make a determination.  The ISM will be responsible for:  
 
 Reviewing reports of RAEs ;  
 Confirming or refuting classification of the event as an RAE; 
 Making a dete rmination about relatedness  of the RAE;  
 Requesting additional information as needed in order to make a determination;  
 Providing the CCC with follow -up reports for ongoing RAEs  as new information 
becomes available; and  
 Notifying the CCC of the final status  for the event once it has been determined.

the individual Reportable Adverse Event Records, including a narrative for each event, as well 
as a table showing all RAEs  to the DSMB and NIA semi -annually.  The DSMB will review all 
RAEs  that are temporally related to the interventions in aggregate form at its scheduled 
meetings.  
 
All RAEs  that relate to hazards of the study interventions or are cause for urgent concern will be 
reported to the CCC and the CCC  will report these to the DSMB  chairman, NIA, and the UMB 
IRB immediately after recognition of their importance. If the DSMB chairman concludes that an 
RAE is of universal and immediate concern, the CCC  will notify local clinical site s at once. The 
DSMB chairman may recommend convening  the DSMB to review participant safety based on 
any individual report or accumulating evidence , including evidence according to treatment 
assignments.  
 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  59 Section 14:  Intervention Discontinuation  
Certain RAEs may result in a temporary interruption or early discontinuati on of the trial 
assessments and interventions or components of these assessments and interventions. Please 
refer to the appropriate MOP chapter(s) for specific instructions on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_505209], intervention, and follow -up assessments.  
 
After such RAEs occur, a participant may resume the trial intervention when the clinical site 
clinician  and the primary care provider (if participant has one) agree that it is appropriate. For 
mild problems that require temporary cessation of intervention, the clinical site investigator, in 
consultation with the clinical site clinician  and participant, may agree to reintroduce the 
participant to the study intervention.  
 
At any time, the DSMB may recommend discontinuation of any component or intervention gro up 
of the study for any of the following reasons:  
1)  Compelling evidence from this or any other study of an adverse effect of the 
study intervention(s) that is sufficient to override any potential benefit of the 
interventions to the target population.  
2)  Compelling evidence from this or any other study of a significant beneficial effect 
of the study intervention(s), such that its continued denial to other study group(s) 
would be unethical.  
3)  A very low probability of addressing the study goals within  a feasible time frame.  
 
Section 15:  Data Analyses  
Analyses for all aims will be performed according to the intention -to-treat (ITT) paradigm. Prior 
to confirmatory analysis, exploratory data analyses will be performed. These exploratory 
analyses will consist of histograms for continuous outcomes to examin e whether a 
transformation is needed to meet modeling assumptions and frequencies for categorical data to 
assess whether the data are sparse. With the exception of the statistical test of the primary 
hypothesis, a ll statistical tests will be two -sided and will not be adjusted for multiple 
comparisons . As described in greater detail below, the test of the primary hypothesis 
(comparing the groups with respect to proportion who are community ambulators at 16 weeks) 
will be based on a one -sided 0.[ADDRESS_651842] performed at five time points 
throughout the trial.  
 
15.1 Primary Aim  
The primary aim is to determine if a 16 -week intervention based on aerobic conditioning, 
specificity of training, and muscle overload for strengthening (the PUSH  intervention)  is more 
successful in producing community ambulation at [ADDRESS_651843] -randomization than an 
intervention of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, flexibility, and AROM  exercises (the 
PULSE  intervention).   Therefore, the one-sided null hypothesis that the PUSH intervention does 
not result in a higher  proportion of community ambulators [ADDRESS_651844] -randomization will be 
tested . This hypothesis will be tested  at five time points based on a Z -statistic (which is 
equivalent to the square root of the Pearso n chi -square statistic). The critical values for each 
time point were chosen to preserve an overall type -1 error rate of 0.025.206 If the exploratory 
analyses reveal data sparseness (expected frequency less than [ADDRESS_651845] one combination 
of treatment group and community ambulation status), Fisher’s exact test will b e performed 
instead of using the chi -square statistic . The difference in proportions with a 95% confidence 
interval will also be reported.   
 
CAP Protocol version 12.[ADDRESS_651846] 300 meters in six minutes (yes/no). 
This variable will  take the value of ‘yes’ if the participant was tested with the SMWT and walked 
300 m or more in six minutes. This variable will take the value of ‘no’ if 1) the participant was 
tested with the SMWT and walked less than 300 m in six minutes or 2) the parti cipant was not 
tested with the SMWT  (or the participant was tested but not according to protocol)  and 
adjudication resulted in the participant’s being classified as a treatment failure  (see 11.5 for 
description of the adjudication procedure) . Participants whose adjudication result is 
‘indeterminate’ will be excluded from the primary analysis.  
 
In a secondary analysis, an alternative  outcome variable will be created to represent the 
participant’s community ambulation status at 16-week follow -up. This secondary variable will 
take the value of ‘yes’ if the participant was tested with the SMWT and walked 300 m or more in 
six minutes. The  secondary variable will take the value of ‘no’ if 1) the participant was tested 
with the SMWT and walked less than 300 m in six minutes , 2) the participant was not tested 
with the SMWT and adjudication resulted in the participant’s being classified as a t reatment 
failure because of death, sickness, or gait speed < 0. 6 m/s, or 3) the participant was tested with 
the SMWT but not according to protocol and adjudication resulted in the participant’s being 
classified as a treatment failure, whatever the reason . The secondary variable will take the value 
of ‘missing’ if 1) the participant was not tested with the SMWT and adjudication resulted in the 
participant’s being classified as a treatment failure based only on self - or proxy -reported walking 
limitation or 2)  the participant was not tested with the SMWT (or the participant was tested but 
not according to protocol) and adjudication resulted in the participant’s being classified as 
‘indeterminate’.  All participants, including those with a missing value for the a lternative outcome 
variable , will be  included in the secondary analysis. To be consistent with the principle of ITT, 
weighted estimated equations (described below) will be used for this analysis.  
 
Study site will be investigated as a modifier of the effect  of the intervention by [CONTACT_6310] a site -by-
intervention interaction term. If study site is an effect modifier, we will report 1) site -specific 
treatment effects and 2) a summary measure of treatment effect using standardization. 
Standardization will be acco mplished using inverse probability of treatment weighting (as a 
function of study site) in a marginal structural model.[ADDRESS_651847] of the 
PUSH  intervention relative to the PULSE  intervention in subgroups defined by [CONTACT_505313] 12.0  61 characteristics. To do this, a variable -by-intervention interaction term will be tested for each of 
the following variables:  
1. Gender  
2. Age at baseline (≥85 yea rs versus 60-84 years)  
3. Baseline depression (CES -D score ≥ 16 versus CES -D score < 16)  
4. Baseline balance confidence (with median Activities -Specific Balance Confidence scale 
score as the cutpoint to define the subgroups)  
5. Baseline nutritional status ( MNA® -SF score <8 versus MNA® -SF score ≥8) 
6. Baseline cognitive status (3MS score < 91 versus 3MS score ≥ 91) 
If the interaction term for any of these subgroup variables is significant, results will be presented 
separately in strata of the subgroup variable.  
 
15.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
15.2.1  Delayed and Sustained Effects  
Generalized estimating equations (GEEs)[ADDRESS_651848] to missp ecification of the working model (e.g., 
binomial, normal, etc.). This approach accounts for intra -participant correlation between 
repeated measures. With the use of GEEs we will be able to relate outcomes, at specific time 
points, to treatment group. For a ll analyses using GEE, the empi[INVESTIGATOR_505210]. The longitudinal model for this aim will be fit 
using a binomial working model and is expressed by [CONTACT_8028]:  
 
Logit(p) = a + b1 X + b2 t 40 + b3 Xt40,   (Eq. 1)  
 
where p is the probability of a particular outcome, Logit(p) = ln(p/(1 -p)), X is the intervention 
indicator (1/0) variable; b1 is the treatment effect at 16 weeks; t40 is the [ADDRESS_651849]-randomization indicator (0=16  weeks; 1=40 weeks); and Xt40 is the intervention -by-time 
interaction variable. The fitted coefficients in Eq.[ADDRESS_651850] the null hypothesis H 0: (b1+b3)=[ADDRESS_651851] of 
the PUSH intervention on community ambulation at 40 weeks; if there is no evidence for a 
difference in proportion of community ambulators at [ADDRESS_651852] the null hypothesis H 0: b3=[ADDRESS_651853] with type I error of 0.05. All treatment effects will be reported with their 
respective 95% confidence intervals.  
 
A similar approach will be used to examine delayed and sustained effects for the secondary and 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  62 tertiary outcomes described below.  
 
15.2.2  Secondary and Tertiary Outcomes  
Secondary outcomes include five variables (endurance, d ynamic balance, walking speed, 
quadriceps strength, and lower extremity function) that are hypothesized to be precursors to 
community ambulation. In addition, we will examine the difference between the treatments with 
respect to the following tertiary outc omes: ADLs, balance confidence, quality of life, physical 
activity, lower extremity physical performance, depressive symptoms, increase of ≥ [ADDRESS_651854] -randomization. Increase 
of ≥ 50 m  in distance walked , a dichotomous outcome, will be analyzed using the same method 
as the primary outcome. All of the other secondary and tertiary outcomes are continuous; 
therefore, a normal working model will be used to estimate the parameters in the following 
equation:  
                  = a + b1 X + b2 t16 + b3 t40 + b4 Xt16 + b5 Xt40,       (Eq. 2)  
 
where  is the mean of a particular outcome, X is the intervention indicator (1/0) variable; t16 
and t40 are the [ADDRESS_651855] -randomization indicators, respectively; and 
Xt16 and Xt40 are the intervention -by-time interaction variables. This  model accounts for 
outcomes at three time points: baseline, [ADDRESS_651856] -randomization will be compared using Eq. 2 by [CONTACT_6310] H 0: b4=b5=[ADDRESS_651857] with type -I error of 0.05. All treatment effects will be reported with their 
respective 95% confidence intervals.  
 
15.2.[ADDRESS_651858] analyses of within -
trial comparisons for the economic endpoints (resource utilization/costs and SF -6D/QALYs) and 
will also undertake a model -based analysis that allows the economic value of both study 
interventions to be assessed relative to usual care. Longitudinal modeling appropriate for 
repeated measures data will be used to make inferences on the overall differences in cost and 
QALYs assoc iated with the study interventions. The basic statistical analyses of cost and 
QALYs will be similar to the approach described for other study endpoints, but will be 
undertaken in the EEC in close collaboration with the DCC.  
 
Statistical analyses of SF -6D will produce an estimate of the incremental QALYs associated 
with the PUSH  intervention at each time point where SF -[ADDRESS_651859] data, 
which will be adjusted to a constant dollar year (e.g., 2012 US dollars), will produce an estimate 
of the incremental costs associated with the PUSH  vs.PULSE  intervention.  
 
The incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is defined as the net change in cost 
divided by [CONTACT_505314] (QALYs) when interventions are ranked in order of 
increasing cost, is the focus of the economic  analysis.  When estimated as added cost per 
QALY gained, the ICER allows the value of interventions in hip fracture to be compared with 
interventions in other diseases. ICERs will be estimated using both the statistical analysis of 
cost and QALY data (i.e ., trial -based ICER) and a model -based analysis that combines trial 
results with other existing data (i.e., model -based ICER). The trial -based ICER addresses the 
economic value of the PUSH  intervention relative to the PULSE , while the model -based ICER 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  63 estimates the economic value of the study interventions relative to usual care (as described 
below).  
 
The second objective of the cost -effectiveness analysis is to develop and implement a decision -
analytic modeling framework that will incorporate within -trial findings regarding costs and 
QALYs for the purpose of evaluating the cost -effectiveness of the PUSH  intervention and 
PULSE  relative to usual care. Model -based analyses are commonly employed to extend or 
augment clinical trials because the cost of trials pr ecludes study of all interventions of interest 
and because it is often desirable to consider the value of interventions over a longer time 
horizon than what is observed in the trial. To make inferences about the economic value of the 
study interventions re lative to usual care, a Markov state -transition modeling framework that 
incorporates trial results will be developed and utilized. Estimates of the cost of the study 
interventions will be derived from time estimates recorded in the field over the course of  the 
study. Estimates of the QALY impact of usual care will be derived from existing hip fracture 
cohorts (control arms of other trials). Estimates of changes in SF -6D for similar patient groups 
are available from the con trol arms of BHS RCTs. Because thes e studies have tracked resource 
utilization with few questions and follow up measures, extensive sensitivity analyses that vary 
the impact of the interventions on resource utilization will be undertaken to characterize the 
magnitude of change in costs that  would be required to qualitatively affect the conclusions of the 
economic analysis.  
 
The model -based ICER for the study interventions relative to usual care will be compared 
qualitatively with the costs per additional QALY estimates of other commonly acce pted medical 
interventions. Uncertainty in the model -based analysis will include estimation of cost -
effectiveness acceptability curves, which represent the probability that a particular cost -
effectiveness threshold (e.g., $100,000 per QALY gained) is achie ved when variability in cost 
and QALYs is considered in probabilistic sensitivity analyses.  
 
15.[ADDRESS_651860] published rules for 
handling missing scale items (e.g., the CES -D and the SF -36) will be calculated using those 
rules. All other scales will be considered missing if any part of the scale is missing. To correct 
for potential selection bi as from missing data, we will perform a weighted estimating equations 
(WEE) analysis.[ADDRESS_651861] the probability of being  observed (not 
missing) is calculated as a function of predictors of missingness. Next the relationship of 
treatment group to outcome is assessed using the inverse probability of being observed as a 
weight in the GEE model. WEEs are advantageous because a)  they are consistent with the ITT 
principle because participants with missing data are included in the analysis through the 
estimated weight, and b) unlike other methods for addressing missing data, they can be 
performed in conjunction with marginal struct ural modeling by [CONTACT_505315].

the null. To address this issue, we will examine adherence (defined as proportion of intervention 
visits completed) in both intervention groups. If adherence is less than 80% in either group, we 
will perform a secondary analysis adapting marginal structural m odeling to address 
noncompliance. In this case, the weight will be the inverse probability of treatment received as a 
function of treatment assignment and factors that may affect treatment compliance. This method 
has the benefit of accounting for intermedi ary factors that may impact compliance without 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  64 distorting the randomization by [CONTACT_505316] (i.e., a marginal analysis rather 
than a conditional analysis). Precedents for this approach are available in the literature by 
[CONTACT_284147].[ADDRESS_651863] 28.6% of the data. 
We plan to perform three additional  interim analyses (based on the first 40%, 60%, and 80% of 
data availab le), where the boundary values for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_505211] -Shih-Decani spending function approximation to the O’Brien -Fleming alpha -spending

(delta>0) at the first interim analysis, Z> 3.09 would denote efficacy, and Z< -1.76 would denote 
inefficacy/harm. Table 4 shows the anticipated proportion of the sample accrued at each of the 
remaini ng interim analyses along with the corresponding critical values for declaring significance 
(or lack thereof) at each time point . The critical values are subject to change if the actual 
information available at the time of the analysis differs from the exp ected information available. 
These critical values were calculated using the gsDesign package in R version 2.10.1.

of the primary outcome results.  
 
15.6 Sample Size Adequacy  
  
15.6.1  Primary Aim  
The original power calculations for this study were based on the assumption of a 10% loss to 
follow -up and a 10% rate of nonadherence. However, based on data on the first 88 study 
participants, the estimated rate of loss to follow -up was 6.8% and the rate of nonadherence was 
12.2%. These estimates were used to revise the power calculations using a  new total sample 
size of 210.  
 
The threshold defined for the primary outcome, the ability to walk 300 meters or more in six 
minutes, was exceeded by [CONTACT_3450] 9% of subjects in the BHS [ADDRESS_651867]-fracture (which corresponds approximat ely to the [ADDRESS_651868] -randomization follow -up in 
the proposed trial). Furthermore, 23% of controls in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_505212] 300 meter threshold. The midpoint of this range (9% to 23%) is 16% and this was 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  65 used as the basis for power calculations for the primary outcome, using the R version [IP_ADDRESS]  
Binder et al ,[ADDRESS_651869] size corresponds to a 
difference in six -minute walk distances of about 50 meters for hip fracture patients; a 50 -meter 
difference has been determined by [CONTACT_431315].183 to be clinically meaningful.  Assuming normal 
distributions for the SMWT, and with 16% surpassing the [ADDRESS_651870] size projects to a 19 percentage point difference in the 
proportion of community ambulators between the PUSH  group and the PULSE  group. A 
difference of 20 percentage points or more in the proportion of participant s achieving community 
ambulation is thus considered an achievable and clinically meaningful goal.  
 
Using a group sequential design with four interim analyses (see Section  15.5), and assuming an 
overall loss to follow -up of 6.8% and treatment non -compliance of 12.2%, a total sample of 210 
enrolled patients ( 105 patients per group) is sufficient to achieve over 80% power for the 
detection of a 20 percentage point  difference between the groups, with 16% achieving the 300 
m threshold of the SMWT in the PULSE  group vs 36% in the PUSH  group, using a one-sided 
0.025 significance level. The power specified is for the detection of a time -specific difference at 
the 16 -week follow -up. This calculation accounts for the sample size inflation of 2.4%  needed to 
account for the group sequential design211,[ADDRESS_651871] o f the difference in proportions at the 2.5% 
significance level. The table indicates that the study has  adequate power for detecting

[ADDRESS_651873] -randomization for those 
consented under  version 10.0  of the protocol.  We estimate that there will be approximately 150 
participants (not the full 210) for whom the 40 -week measure of community ambulation will be 
available.   In addition, based on our experience to date, we estimate that the commun ity 
ambulation outcome will be indeterminate for 10% of the participants at the 40 -week 
assessment.  If we assume a sample size of 150  then there is 64% power for detecting a 
difference of 20 percentage points at alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_651874] with alpha=0.05, a sample 
of 210 patients with 6.8% loss to follow -up and 12.2% treatment noncompliance will provide 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  66 80% power to detect effect sizes of 0.[ADDRESS_651875] deviation as patients assigned to the PULSE  group.  Collection of some outcome 
measures will end after implementation of protocol version 11.0 (see Section 11: ). For these 
measures, w e estimate that there will be approximately 160 participants (not the full 210) for 
whom the 16 -week measure will be available. Under the same assumptions, a sample of 160 
will provide 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_651876] deviation of 0.10 (based on unpub lished data 
from the fourth BHS cohort study), and assuming that non -compliers assigned to the PUSH  
group have an equal mean and standard deviation as patients assigned to the PULSE  group, a 
sample size of [ADDRESS_651877] a between -group difference in means of 
0.055 with 80% power and using a two -sided 0.[ADDRESS_651878] and QALYs on 
the ICER. To address power for the economic evaluation, we computed the minimum detectable 
incremental net benefits (INB) for the planned s tudy size.216 To complete this calculation, a 
threshold ICER, , must be specified, which is the maximum one is willing to pay per QALY 
gained. INB is then defined as a function of changes ( ) in QALY a nd costs as follows: 
*QALY -Cost. We utilized ICER thresholds ( ) of $25,000, $50,000, and $100,000 in these 
computations with α=0.05 (two -sided) and 80% power, and utilized variances and covariances 
between QALYs (estimated by [CONTACT_67307] -6D) and cumulative costs from the observational, non -
operative treatment arms of  the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_246922]. Although these 
subjects differ from hip fracture patients, they have similar ongoing musculoskeletal concerns 
and variation in QALYs.  For ’s of $25,00 0, $50,000, and $100,000, minimal detectable INBs 
are $2,638 , $4,079 , and $ 7,234 , respectively.  
 
Section 16:  Data Capture, Data Management, and Quality Assurance  
16.[ADDRESS_651879] Operating Procedures (SOPs) designed to com ply with NIH 
and FDA requirements.  
 
A hybrid system will be employed in which some of the data forms are completed on paper and 
others using a Web form. All data will be stored and cleaned using Clintrial (Oracle/Phase 
Forward, Waltham, MA), a commercial clinical data management system in wi de use. Data 
collected during intervention visits and telephone interviews will be entered using a Web system 
developed and validated by [CONTACT_505317]. Some  forms will be completed on paper and forwarded in 
batches to Axio for processing. This model was chosen to m inimize costs and to provide 
maximum flexibility for each of the different types of data collection (clinical assessment, 
intervention visit, telephone interview). All systems used in this study will be validated according 
to Axio’s SOPs prior to being put  into production.  
 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  67 Axio will draft and maintain a Data Management Plan (DMP) for this study. This plan outlines 
the study data management processes including detailed descriptions of the data entry 
systems, the study database, data standards, data edit rul es, query processing procedures 
(both automated and manual), and coding procedures. The database annotated data forms and 
details of the edit checks will be included as appendices in the DMP. Minor changes may be 
made to the DMP during the course of the st udy as appropriate.  
 
16.2 Data Captur e 
Data capture will utilize a hybrid system; some of the forms will be completed on paper and 
forwarded to Axio for entry and verification. Others, in particular forms completed at intervention 
visits and during telephone interviews, will be completed online (Web data entry) using a 
validated Web data collection tool. The original of all paper forms submitted will be filed in the 
participant binder and kept at the clinical site. Forms entered using the Web tool will be prin ted 
from the Web site and filed in the participant binder. It will be the clinical sites’ responsibility to 
ensure that all forms are complete and submitted within the required time frame. For paper 
forms, the person who collected the data will sign and da te the form attesting to its accuracy 
and completeness. For the Web -based forms, the person who entered the data will print the 
form after completion and will sign and date the form attesting to its accuracy and 
completeness. If the person who entered the data is not the person who collected the data, the 
latter will review the form and sign and date it to affirm its accuracy and completeness. Source 
documents and other study paperwork will be turned into the office on a regular basis by [CONTACT_38992].  
 
16.3 Data Management  
 
16.3.1  Processing of Paper Data Forms  
Paper data forms will be completed by [CONTACT_133654], scanned and emailed to Axio for entry, 
verification and cleaning. The database will be established using Clintrial (version 4.7). This 
clinical data manag ement system is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry. This database 
will reside on the Oracle Database Server, located at Axio. Using Clintrial, Axio will set up a 
logging and tracking system to make sure that each form page received is processed in a timely 
manner. Each table in the database will be carefully checked to ensure that all the variables 
specified on the form have been appropriately entered into the database in the proper format 
(e.g. integer, date/time). Before implementing the data entr y system and database, a sampling 
of data will be entered and loaded into the database. The resulting data from each data table 
will be tested to make sure that the entire process results in a database as expected.  
 
Axio staff will program the data entry s creens for the study using Clintrial. A screen may 
correspond to a paper data form page or to some portion thereof. The screens are programmed 
to require that numeric fields be re -keyed by a second data entry technician (double -data entry) 
for quality cont rol.  
 
Axio will define a data cleaning system comprised of: 1) computerized data validation rules to 
check for legitimate/expected values, completeness of data forms, and logical consistency; and 
2) manual screening checks. The DCC will review and approve  the data edit query definitions 
before Axio begins programming them. A complete list of the data edits will be maintained as an 
appendix to the DMP.  
 
Upon receipt of paper CRF data, the data management staff will log receipt into the study study 
managemen t database and will review the data form prior to data entry. Potential problems with 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  68 the data (e.g., missing or illegible identification data) will be identified by [CONTACT_505318] “ad hoc” data queries, distributed an d tracked for resolution. A data 
technician will enter the data from each data form page received. A separate data technician will 
verify the first entry by [CONTACT_505319] a second time (blinded double entry -verification). Text 
fields will be visually v erified during this second pass.  
 
Data edit checks will be run as each batch of data is entered and verified. Axio’s data 
coordinator will review the resulting list of problems, determine which problems should be sent 
as queries, and interact with the clin ical site staff to clarify issues and answer questions . 
Queries will be printed to PDF and delivered to the sites via email by [CONTACT_505320]. Data 
edit queries will be distributed within one week of receipt of the data forms. Shorter turn -around 
will be provided in advance of DSMB meetings and towards the end of the study in order to 
freeze or close the database.  
 
Using the query tracking reports, the data coordinator will make sure that all queries are 
promptly and completely addressed, following up  on data problems and initiating communication 
when necessary to make sure that data problems are promptly addressed.  
 
Clinical site staff and DCC staff may submit “ad hoc” queries that are tracked and processed in 
the same way as the programmed queries. Clinical site staff may also initiate ad hoc 
corrections.  
 
Clintrial provides a complete 21CFR11 -compliant electronic audit trail of all changes made to 
the database. The audit trail includes the name [CONTACT_25773], the date/time 
of the c hange and the reason for the change.  
 
16.3.[ADDRESS_651880] of participants randomized at the user’s site. Entry of the letter code by [CONTACT_505321]. The application will display the 
assessment times and allow the user to select the assessment  time and form for entry. Edit 
checks will be included for within -form logical, completeness and value/range checks. Once a 
form has been entered and submitted, the link will be disabled. At that point, the application will 
generate a print/readable PDF im age of the data form that can be downloaded or printed.  
 
On a daily basis, data from the Web system will be downloaded to the Clintrial (Oracle) 
database. Further edits will be applied to the data in Clintrial. Queries and updates to data 
entered over the Web will be handled as data from paper data forms, as described above.  
 
The Web system is based on a “Survey Tool” that has been in use at Axio for over 5 years. The 
tool has been reliably implemented for a wide range of studies including some involving 
participant reported outcomes.  
  
16.3.3  Reportable Adverse Events Coding  
RAEs will be coded using MedDRA (version 15.1, release date September 1, 2012). The 
MedDRA coding dictionary is integrated with the Clintrial database.  
 
16.3.4  Extraction of Data for Analysis and Rep orting  
Data will be extracted to SAS data sets for analysis and reporting.  Where required, data will be 
merged and recoded using validated SAS code to create “analysis data sets”.  Specifications for 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  69 these analysis data sets will be drafted and updated as  needed. Testing will be performed by [CONTACT_76691]/SAS programmer per Axio’s SOPs.  
 
16.4 Protection of Data  
 
16.4.1  Physical Security and Backup  
Axio 
Axio’s offices remain locked at all times.  Access is controlled by [CONTACT_505322] -assigned PIN 
codes. Vi sitors are required to sign in and be accompanied at all times by [CONTACT_505323]. 
Axio maintains a dedicated, access -controlled server room within its facility. The server room is 
supported by [CONTACT_505324], a dedicated heating , ventilation and air 
conditioning (HVAC) system, a temperature and humidity monitor and a facility fire detection 
system.  
 
All corporate data and resources including users and computers are administered and secured 
in a Windows domain type network environment using Microsoft’s Active Directory services. 
Access to the data and the programs on the network is secured using group based privileges.  
Passwords are required to be changed every 90 days and the strength and length of the 
passwords are set ac cording to rules specified by [CONTACT_505325] (IT).  
 
Internet access is provided by [CONTACT_87733] -speed connections, a dedicated Ethernet line and a 
Comcast business class connection. The Axio phone system is supported by a separate, 
dedicated T -[ADDRESS_651881] encryption  and additional 
security features.   
 
Remote access to the corporate network is provided using the virtual private network services 
supported by [CONTACT_505326]. Access to the corporate network is controlled 
by [CONTACT_505327]’s Active D irectory services in the Axio domain.  
 
Clintrial resides on an Oracle server located inside Axio’s corporate firewall and on a server 
located within Axio’s dedicated access -controlled server room, described above.  Access to the 
Clintrial database is contr olled by a security model imposed by [CONTACT_19915], which requires 
login with an individually assigned user name [CONTACT_2383].  A role -based security model 
assures that staff are allowed to perform only those functions which are appropriate for their role 
(e.g., data entry/verification only, managing data queries, etc.).  Backups are performed as 
described below.  
 
The Axio collocation facility is located at the AdHost data center in Seattle, WA.  The AdHost 
facility is access -controlled, monitored by [CONTACT_505328]. The server hardware at AdHost is monitored 24 hours/day, 365 
days/year, by [CONTACT_505329], located on site.  The AdHost 
facility is supported by [CONTACT_505330]: (1) a diesel generation 
backup with rooftop helicopter delivery of fuel, (2) uninterruptable power supplies for each bank 
of cabinets, (3) a carrier neutral environment with nine separate ISPs, and (4) a fully redundant 
HVAC system. The AdHost facility meets or exceeds the [LOCATION_004] seismic zone [ADDRESS_651882].  
 
Axio maintains a disaster recovery plan that addresses all aspects of business activities. The 
technical portion of the plan incl udes processes for recovery of critical systems, e -mail, data and 
support services under a variety of scenarios. Axio maintains a collocation facility that is capable 
of hosting all critical functions in the event of a disaster.  The disaster recovery plan  is reviewed 
yearly and major technical portions of the plan are exercised quarterly.  
 
Data Coordinating Center at University of Maryland, Baltimore  
All files, including programs used for data management functions, are fully archived once every 
week with a n incremental backup (one in which only records containing new or modified data 
are archived) as well. The backup system is designed to permit the restoration of the system 
with a minimum expenditure of time and money should any file be destroyed. Every fo ur weeks, 
the backup devices are copi[INVESTIGATOR_505213]. Prior to any major change in the operating 
system, backup devices of the main database are created and saved for as long as needed.  
 
Economic Evaluation Core at Dartmouth University  
The Economic  Evaluation Core (EEC) has offices located at Dartmouth -Hitchcock Medical 
Center (DHMC) with computing support provided by [CONTACT_505331] (TDI) computing services and Geisel School of Medicine Computing. All  
computers operating on the DHMC campus are fully encrypted. TDI provides [ADDRESS_651883] disk, along 
with several more teraby[CONTACT_505332].  Data are protected by [CONTACT_505333], which provide on -the-fly 256 -bit level encryption.  All connections to this server are 
secured by [CONTACT_505334].  Authorized users may access the system only via VPN, or locally 
through the firewalled intranet, using Red Hat Linux workstations.  
 
Current research is supported by a cluster of 2 D ell 2950 servers using the VMWare 
virtualization suite, which allows multiple “virtual machines” to run simultaneously on each 
physical machine. Physical machines communicate together in a cluster to automatically share 
resource load and to assume the work  of physical machines that experience hardware failure, 
minimizing possible down -time. Each of the two VMWare servers is configured with two dual -
core 3.[ADDRESS_651884] two fault tolerant (RAID -5) Network Attached Disk arrays. The RAID 
(Redundant Array of Independent Disks) configuration prevents a single disk failure from 
affecting data in tegrity or resulting in data loss. For backup an 80/160 GB tape and another 
400/[ADDRESS_651885] are used. Additionally, two external APC 3000 and one 1500 
universal power supply along with PowerChute software minimizes short -term power loss and 
allows for graceful shutdown during extended power outages to prevent corrupted data. In 
addition to the clustered VMWare servers, the Research Computing Service has Dell 
PowerEdge 2600 and 750 systems. Each has its own RAID -5-based internal disk storage and  
the 2600 has dual -CPUs and dual -power supplies for additional fault -tolerance.  
 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  71 Databases are implemented through Microsoft SQL -Server relational database management 
system. Data on the research workstations is protected through a "near disk" online backu p 
strategy along with a tape facility for long -term, off -site storage. All workstations in the CAP 
EEC’s domain are backed up in real time to the server disks to provide short -term file and disk 
recovery using Symantec Backup Exec software. These workstati on backups along with all 
server changes are then backed up nightly to tape for long -term and off -site storage. 
Additionally, file copi[INVESTIGATOR_505214] -Laptop Option.  
 
16.4.[ADDRESS_651886].  
Passwords will be required to adhere to specific rules to ensure strong security and will be reset 
every 180 days.  The application will encrypt all transactions (https:// web site).  Data will reside 
on a SQL/Server protected from the internet by [INVESTIGATOR_327172].  Separate passwords will protect the 
SQL/Server databases.  All transactions will be logged, recording the user ID of the person 
performing the transaction and the server and  local date/time of the transaction.  
 
Analysis Data  
Data for statistical analysis and reporting will be downloaded from the Web systems described 
above and from Clintrial.  All files will be stored to a file server located at Axio.   
 
Access to the directories where study data will be retained will be controlled by a security group 
model, allowing only those Axio staff working on this trial to have access to the files and data.  
Access to unblinded randomization assignment data will be further restri cted to those 
specifically designated by [CONTACT_505335].  
 
16.5 Study Management  Database  
An A ccess® database will be used to track study visits, generate schedules of future study visits, 
status of participants , activities of study staff members, form completion, and form submission. 
The database will provide a standard way for the clinical sites to track time -sensitive study 
activities throughout the study and for the CCC to track activities across all three cl inical sites.  
Each clinical site will house the  study management  database on a password -protected 
computer drive that will be automatically backed up daily. Access to the database will be 
restricted to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_505215], if necessary, one o ther study staff member who 
has no participant contact. There will be several standard reports available in the database for 
the clinical sites to use for a variety of tracking issues.  Additional reports will be created as 
needed.  Data for the tracking d atabase will come from tracking forms completed by [CONTACT_464].   
 
16.6 Quality Assurance (QA)  
Quality assurance (QA) will be a shared responsibility of all investigators. The goal of QA 
monitoring will be to track study progress and develop the information nec essary to ensure: 1) 
enrollment of the required number of participants; 2) adherence to treatment protocol; 3) that 
data are reported completely, verifiably and in a timely fashion; and 4) participant safety, by 
[CONTACT_505336], NIA, and 
IRBs. Study monitoring will be based on early implementation of reviews of accumulating data 
with rapid feedback to the clinical sites regarding problem areas. The Steering Committee will 
regularly review progre ss. 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  72  
16.6.1  Training  
Staff from each clinical site will be trained at the initial central training session(s). Certification 
and recertification will be required in order to assure that clinic staff have a clear understanding 
of the CAP Protocol and Manual of Pro cedures (MOP). Separate training sessions will be 
provided for staff conducting study assessments, telephone interviewers, PTs providing the 
PUSH  intervention, PTs providing the PULSE  intervention, staff conducting screening and 
informed consent procedures, and the registered dieticians.  The clinical site coordinator will 
attend all training sessions.  
 
Training sessions will cover recruitment; obtaining informed consent; collection of  protocol -
specified data (both questionnaire and performance -based measures); scoring; completion of 
forms; randomization; capturing and reporting expected AEs and RAEs; administering the 
interventions; performing diet consults; and using the paper -based a nd web -based  data entry 
system s.  
 
In preparation for training, staff will be asked to read background material (e.g., designated 
chapters in the MOP). The training session will involve both didactic and interactive 
components. Training for the different s essions will be provided by [CONTACT_505337]. For example, training the PTs to deliver the study interventions will be 
provided by [CONTACT_505338], training in consent, enrollment, and assessment procedures will be provided 
by [CONTACT_505339], while training in randomization and forms completion will be provided by 
[CONTACT_505340]. Whenever appropriate, trainees will be required to demonstrate acquired 
skills. These demonstrations will be observed and critiqued by [CONTACT_505341]. 
Trainees will be certified to perform study procedures after successfully completing written and 
(when appropriate) performance tests.  
 
Local recertification sessions will be held annually for all staff groups. In addition to refresher 
training on  all study procedures, these sessions will focus on current issues facing the staff, new 
components implemented in the clinical sites, and problem areas. Recertification procedures 
improve compliance with the protocol and the maintenance of study skills ov er the course of the 
trial. The clinical site coordinator will be responsible for documenting that certification and 
recertification training has been completed and forwarding that information to the CCC.

be suspended and the situation will be reviewed by [CONTACT_16274], DSMB, and/or NIA, depending on 
the nature of the deviations .  This review could result either in more aggressive remedial efforts 
or in termination of the clinical site.  The DCC will document minor deviations in performance 
reports, as well as notifying the clinical sites of them. Repeated minor deviations that a re not 
corrected may result in suspension of the clinical site. Such a clinical site can only resume study 
activities once a corrective action plan has been submitted and approved by [CONTACT_131458].   Clinical sites with enrolled participants will b e required to complete data collection 
for those participants even if randomization is suspended. Prior to separation of a clinical site 
from the study, the directors of the DCC and CCC will visit the clinical site and provide a site 
visit report to the DS MB for recommendation on final action.  
 
Major deviations will be reported promptly by [CONTACT_505342] a protocol deviation log, which will then be stored in a study -wide 
cumulative report in the CCC.  The following classifications of protocol deviations will be 
captured, documented, and reviewed:  
 
1) Enrollment, consent, and randomization deviations  
a. Randomization of an ineligible participant  
b. Failure to obtain informed consent  
c. Enrollment of par ticipant into another study  
 
2) IRB deviations  
a. Failure to keep IRB approval up to date  
b. Failure to submit study modification for approval  
 
3) Intervention deviations  
a. Wrong intervention administered to participant  
b. Required a spects of intervention not administered (e.g., dietician referral)  
 
16.[ADDRESS_651889] once a year during the enrollment 
and follow -up period, and again for a close -out visit six months after the completion of data 
collection. If problems are identified, the CCC will develop a corrective action plan for t he clinical 
site with clearly defined tasks and timelines. The CCC will track the implementation of the plan 
and assure that all tasks are completed within the defined timeframe.  
 
Site visitors will discuss any difficulties clinical site staff are having a nd will work cooperatively to 
try to resolve them. Additional visits will be made to clinical sites experiencing difficulty in 
meeting their goals for recruitment or in delivering the study intervention, and recommendations 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  74 for improvement will be made to them. Additional visits will also be made if there are concerns 
about data quality or protocol adherence. Following each visit, a report will be sent to the SC. 
The SC will review site deficiencies and protocol deviations; remedial action and/or site 
suspe nsion will be recommended based on severity and frequency of occurrence.  
 
The purposes of the monitoring visits  will be to: 
 assure the rights and safety of participants  
 assure that informed consent has been obtained and documented in accordance 
with the pr otocol and NIH regulations   
 verify adherence to the protocol and examine staff knowledge via interviews and 
formal testing  
 observe staff performing screening, informed consent, evaluations and 
interventions to confirm that study conduct follows the guidel ines of Good Clinical 
Practice  
 observe office space and procedures to assure secure maintenance of required 
documents  
 observe location for the storage of study medications and revi ew temperature 
logs 
 review drug accountability logs  
 review files for docume ntation of informed consent and to monitor the quality of 
data collected  
 review participant binders for completeness  
 assure the information recorded on the forms is complete and accurate  
 assure there are no omissions in the reports of specific data elemen ts 
 assure participant status at study exit is accurately recorded  
 assure accurate reporting and documentation of all AEs  
 
Clinical site investigators must provide the QC monitors access to all requested study 
documents, including ICFs, drug accountability records, and source documents. During these 
visits, a spot -check of the accuracy of selected participant records will be carried out based on 
data already submitted to the DCC.   
 
Additional QA monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_505343][INVESTIGATOR_505216] -week telephone calls.  A 
random sample of the recordings will be reviewed centrally to confirm the date, time, and length 
of call; completeness and accuracy of administration of the questions; and completeness and 
accuracy of the responses re corded on the data collection form.  
 
Section 17:  Participant Rights and Confidentiality  
 
17.[ADDRESS_651890] (IRB)  
The study  protocol for scientific oversight and management will be reviewed by [CONTACT_505344]  (excluding aspects specific to human subjects that will be addressed by 
[CONTACT_145889]’ IRBs ). Subsequent modifications to the umbrella protocol  must be approved by 
[CONTACT_505345][INVESTIGATOR_600] .  
 
The study chair will be responsible for sending DSMB recommendations  to individual clinical 
site PIs, who in turn  will be required to distribute the report to their local IRBs.  
 
CAP Protocol version 12.0  75 17.2 Informed Consent Forms  (ICF)  
It will be the sole responsibility of each clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_201190]/his site.  The ICF will 
describe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, alterna tives to participation, 
and the risks and benefits of participation.  It will also be explained that signing the consent form 
allows the study to confirm eligibility before randomization to a treatment group.  Written 
informed consent will be obtained acco rding to procedures reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_42042] s’ IRBs.  Informed consent can be obtained anytime upon completion of phase [ADDRESS_651891] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. Consent by a legally 
authorized representative will not be accepted.   
 
In some cases, a local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_505217]’s IRB approved  consent form 
and/or the HIPAA Authorization Form.  However, clinical site IRBs and local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_505218]. The 
clinical sites will be responsible for ensuring that the correct version of the ICF is used at their 
site. 
 
If there is a change in any of the study procedures or risks that may affect the participant,  the 
ICF must be revised and undergo appropriate IRB review and approval.  Any participants 
enrolled in the study prior to such changes and who are still active in the study must sign the 
amended consent form.  
 
The study consent form will be provided to a potential  participant  for review  prior to obtaining 
informed consent . The ICF may also be mailed to the participant and/or a family member  so that 
s/he has sufficient time to read the document and, if desired , to have a family member or friend 
review the f orm before signing.  During the informed consent process, study staff will provide 
participants with adequate information concerning the study procedures, respond to individuals’ 
questions and concerns, and ensure that each individual understands all the i nformation 
provided  by [CONTACT_505346] .  A more detailed description of the 
informed consent process can be found in section  7.6.   
 
17.2.[ADDRESS_651892] identifiers and protected health information (PHI), these forms will 
not be submitted with the data collection forms.  Originals of the ICF will be filed and maintained 
by [CONTACT_201287] a locked cabinet 
or office, separate from source documents that include no PHI.  A copy of the signed consent 
form will be given to the participant and this fact will be documented in the participant’s record.   
 
17.2.2  HIPAA Authorization  
The HIPAA Authorization for Research is an individual's signed permission to allow the study 
investigators to use or disclose the individual's PHI described in the authorization.  Once an 
individual  has agreed to participate in the study and written informed consent has been 
obtained, the HIPAA Authorization  for Research must also be explained and signed.  The 
HIPAA Authorization may be a stand -alone document or wording for the HIPAA Authorization 
may be incorporated into the text of the ICF.  The original signed authorization will be submitted 
to the study office and a signed copy will be given to the participant.   
 
17.3 Participant Confidentiality  
Potential participants will be provided with a clear understanding of how the information they 
provi de will be  used.  All investigators and staff involved in the study will be required to complete 
training on the  protection of human subjects and HIPAA and to maintain proper certifications.    
CAP Protocol version 12.0  76  
Information may be entered by [CONTACT_505347] (e.g., Facebook) 
or other online communications. These web -based tools must meet HIPAA guidelines to ensure 
that protected health information is kept private and secure and use of these technologies will 
be subject to approval by [CONTACT_145889]’ IRBs.  
 
To ensure confidentiality of study data, completed questionnaires and study forms will be kept in 
participant binders stored in locked offices at each clinical site, no unauthori zed person will be 
permitted to see the binder or forms, names will be used only for the necessary purpose of 
making sure that the recorded information is for the person to whom it refers, and data will be 
summarized so that published results cannot be tra ced to individuals.  
 
On data collection forms, participants will be identified only by a unique study identification 
number and letter code. Clinical sites will record names, contact [CONTACT_3031], and other direct 
identifiers to enable them to maintain con tact with participants. Logs accessible only to the local 
clinical site investigators and key study personnel will link the study identification number to 
names.  
 
To protect study data from theft or unauthorized perusal or alteration, access to all compute r 
files will be restricted to designated personnel through the use of passwords.  Access to the 
database and programs will be on a "need to use" basis (e.g., coordination staff cannot access 
main system programs).   
 
Computer security procedures, including  multiple levels of password protection will be instituted. 
The study records will be identified by a unique participant identification number. Identification 
numbers will be recorded on each page of the paper forms.  The participant's letter code and a 
study status date (e.g., date of randomization) will be used as a second level of check.  Names 
and addresses of participants corresponding to each identification number will be kept in secure 
files at the clinical sites. Final analysis data sets will not co ntain any directly or indirectly 
identifying information.   Thus, dates of birth will be converted to age, other dates will be 
changed to counts of days from study entry, identification numbers will be replaced with 
sequence numbers, variables that could l ead to deductive disclosure of the identity of individual 
participants will not be included nor will indirect identifiers such as infrequently occurring (e.g., 
fewer than 20 participants) outwardly manifest characteristics.  
 
In the final year of award, aft er the completion of a final data edit, DCC staff will prepare a data 
file in SAS containing all study variables intended for use in publications; identifying information 
and administrative data (e.g., edit trail) will not be included in this data file. A de-identified data 
set will be created which merges all the essential data from all time points of the study. 
Documentation (including abstracts of published works and calculated variable definitions) and 
form images will be included with the data file. Th e data file will be provided to the NIA/NIH after 
the end of the period of funding for sharing with other investigators according to NIH policy.  
 
Section 18:  Research Publication Polic y 
Publications will be operationally defined as manuscripts for publication; abstrac ts for platform 
or poster presentation at scientific and other professional meetings; slides for presentation at 
scientific and other professional meetings; doctoral dissertations; and master’s theses.  
 
The goal of our publication policy is to encourage an d facilitate the publication of study results.  
The purposes of this policy are to ensure the following:  1) CAP publications will be of the 
CAP Protocol version 12.[ADDRESS_651893] scientific quality; 2) CAP will be described in a consistent manner across publications; 3) 
measures are re ported in consistent ways across publications; 4) proper acknowledgements are 
included; and 4) appropriate authorship credit is determined prior to submission of manuscripts 
for publication consideration.  
 
Publications from CAP will be overseen by [CONTACT_505348] 
(PASC).  In addition to committee co -chairs, the PASC will have at least one representative 
from the DCC, CCC, EEC, and each clinical site.  The PASC will make recom mendations to the 
SC.   
 
A document describing the CAP Publication Policy and Procedures appears in the Manual of 
Procedures.  
 
Section 19:  Ancillary Studies Policies  
An ancillary study will be defined as a study that (1) uses supplementary data that will be 
collected on participants who are recruited in CAP, over and above the data collection required 
by [CONTACT_505349], (2) collects biological specimens (e.g., blood)  or performs diagnostic tests 
(e.g., bone density scans) ; and/or (3) collects data on subjects not enrolled in CAP but who may 
be compared to CAP subjects (e.g., participants who receive an alternate intervention).  
Ancillary studies will be distinct from databank studies, which use data previously collected on  
participants who are enrolled in CAP.   
 
Ancillary studies will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_505350].   All approved ancillary 
studies will also be  reviewed by [CONTACT_505351].  If approved, the ancillary 
study PI [INVESTIGATOR_505219]. Review by [CONTACT_505352] 
(and approval by [CONTACT_16274]) will also be required for presen tation or publication of an cillary study 
results.   
 
CAP investigators will be encouraged to consider ancillary studies and to involve other 
investigators, within and outside of CAP personnel. Participation in an ancillary study will be 
subject to the approval of the CAP PASC, SC, a nd DSMB, The following factors will be 
considered in determining approval of a proposed ancillary study:  
1. Participant burden  
a. The proposed study must be acceptable to the participants (e.g. in terms of time, 
discomfort, privacy).  
b. The proposed study must n ot reduce enrollment or hamper continued participation in 
the main study.  
2. Study interference  
a. The proposed study must not interfere with other parts of the main study.  
b. The proposed study must put no additional demand on CAP resources.  
3. The proposed study mu st be of the highest scientific merit.  
4. The investigators must have adequate resources to effectively complete the ancillary study, 
including:  
a. Sufficient budget (including enough to offset any costs to CAP).  
b. Staff having the requisite expertise to meet the objectives of the project.

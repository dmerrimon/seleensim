 STUDY PROTOCOL  
** please note, this protocol is the next step in studying home TTNS ( HSC -MS-17-0423 .) 
Since feasibility has been established, we are looking to study efficacy with this proposed 
randomized sham -control trial.**  
 
 
1. BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
 
There are over [ADDRESS_49047] injury (SCI) with devastating functional 
impairments including paralysis and bowel/bladder dysfunction.[ADDRESS_49048] treatment of neuro genic bladder involves the 
use of anticholinergic bladder medications, which suffers from non -compliance and adverse 
medication effects.3 Improving bowel and bladder function is the number one priority that people 
living with SCI wish to achieve.4 Treatmen ts such as bladder neuromodulation with tibial nerve 
stimulation (TNS), have been shown to improve bladder function in SCI without adverse effects.5 6 
Percutaneous TNS (PTNS) is performed using a needle inserted into the skin to direct the electric 
current , provided by [CONTACT_46502]. 
This requires frequent visits in a population with known accessibility challenges. Transcutaneous 
TNS (TTNS) accomplishes the same goal, but uses non -invasive surfa ce electrodes. However, 
this modality has only been performed in the clinic setting. There is currently a gap in our 
knowledge about the safety and feasibility of TTNS at home for bladder neuromodulation in SCI. 
The proposed research is innovative, in our opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], because it represents a substantive  departure 
from the status quo by [CONTACT_46503] a 
dignified treatment that can improve quality of  life. 
 
Electric stimulation is routinely being used in neu rorehabilitation. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_46474], describing the use of FES and NMES in SCI for 
motor/sensory recovery, decreasing spasticity, and improving neuropathic pain.7-[ADDRESS_49049]. 0813, 2020

1. General Introduction  
 
The management of NLUTD in SCI includes: maintaining continence via timed voiding, 
catheterization (intermittent or indwelling), use of OAB medications, chemodenervation, and/or 
surgery. While t hese approaches have dramatically improved morbidity and mortality related to the 
upper urinary tracts, they are also associated with significant functional impairment11, challenges to 
community re -entry12-14, expense14 15, adverse effects 11 14, and ultim ately QOL 11 (see Table 1 ). 
 
We propose a non-invasive, readily -available, and inexpensive approach that can be used at 
home (and reduces reliance on the health care system) to improve bladder -related health and 
function, while overcoming existing barriers: TTNS (transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation) , 
the transcutaneous adaptation of PTNS (percutaneous TNS). PTNS has demonstr ated equal 
efficacy to newer OAB medications in a randomized control trial of 100 SCI subjects, while 
boasting fewer adverse events. 6 Although a large study of this nature has not been performed 
with TTNS in SCI, in the population of people with NLUTD due  to Multiple Sclerosis (MS), TTNS 
has been shown to improve urinary urgency in more than 80% of the subjects, reduce urinary 
frequency, and had a positive impact on QOL measures. 16

The Stamobil + is an electric stimulation unit used for the rehabilitation of those with paralysis. It is 
currently used at TIRR Memorial Hermann on nearly every patient with paralysis for the purposes 
of motor and sensory recovery. We have used the propos ed TTNS protocol for research purposes 
(HSC -MS-15-0806, HSC -MS-17-0423). Based on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_46475], we believe we should test 
the efficacy of the protocol for home use in a randomized control trial. The proposed protocol is 
using the device in a new w ay, to stimulate the nerves of the legs which is known to effect the 
bladder in a process described as “neuromodulation.”  
 
Electric stimulation is currently being used in neurorehabilitation. The candidate has published 
reviews on the current state of reha bilitation in SCI, describing the use of FES and NMES in acute 
SCI for motor/sensory recovery, decreasing spasticity, and improving neuropathic pain.9, [ADDRESS_49050]. 0813, 2020

hypothesis has been tested in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_46477].10 
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] I, Safety and Bladder Capacity:  TTNS in acute SCI was performed in a 
randomized sham -control trial of TTNS for 30 minutes x 10 days using a commercially/readily 
available n euromuscular electric stimulation (NMES) device. In this trial, there were no safety 
events, compliance was 100%, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46478]. Decrease in bladder 
capacity and detrusor -sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) events were both mitigated in the TTNS 
group ( Fig. 1 ). Also, evidence of the proposed mechanism was seen with significantly 
increased volumes to sensation in the TTNS group compared to the controls post -trial. These 
findings suggest that TTNS has the potential to mitigate the development o f morbid 
neurogenic bladder in acute SCI. We also provided evidence of altering the nervous system 
response to bladder filling in a cohort of these subjects, suggesting the ability of reducing AD.18 
We then investigated home use of TTNS as the next phase of study.

chronic SCI. Preliminary data of TTNS performed at home  provides evidence of high compliance,  
feasibility, and efficacy . Unlike the clinic -based treatment required for PTNS, compliance for the 
home -based treatment with TTNS is nearly double t hat of PTNS based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299].13 
 
 
 
b. Rationale for Doses  Selected  
 
Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4250], tibial nerve stimulation protocols use submotor current intensity with a 
duration of 200 µs and frequency of 10Hz. 10 TTNS will be used 5 days weekly.  
 
c. Rational e for Study  Population  
 
Participants:  Participants will include SCI performing intermittent catheterization (IC) and using 
OAB medications, ages [ADDRESS_49059] incontinence than those with an indwelling catheter. If patients 
are interested, we will trial stimulati on in clinic. We will exclude those who we cannot produce toe 
flexion with posterior tibial nerve stimulation.  
After 2 weeks of home stimulation, those that are on bladder medicine will discontinue the 
medication. There is no other harm from rapid disconti nuation of bladder medication, except for 
possible incontinence. The outcome measures are measure of bladder medication doses and 
surveys. The Incontinence Quality of Life (I -QOL) survey reflects the quality of life related to 
incontinence. 20 The Neurogen ic Bladder Symptom Score (NBSS) measures and scores  
symptoms related to NGB. [ADDRESS_49060] -discharge. 
The medication + TTNS adherence survey and Medication + TTNS % survey. Adherence scales 
will measure adherenc e to medication and transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation. Will be  
conducted at baseline, then every 4 weeks. The Connor -Davidson Resilience Scale (CD -RISC -25) 
will measure resilience. Conducted at baseline, week 6 and at the end of trial. The PROMIS 
General Self -Efficacy (GSE) will measure self -efficacy. (There is no validated Spanish version. 
Therefore, a conclusion cannot be made.) Conducted at baseline, week [ADDRESS_49061]. 0813, 2020

 2. HYPOTHESIS AND  OBJECTIVES  
 
 
1. Hypothesis  
 
Specific Aim 1. In a randomized sham -control trial (n=60), determine the efficacy of home TTNS  
in SCI . 
Hypothesis 1.1: Those in the TTNS group will be able to reduce their OAB medication dosages 
while maintaining continence compared to controls over a peri od of 3 months.  
Hypothesis 1.2: Symptoms of NGB measured by [CONTACT_46507] 
(NBSS) and a voiding diary (VD) will be reduced in the TTNS group compared to controls.  
 
Specific Aim 2. Determine the impact on quality of life using TTNS at home . 
Hypothesis 2.1: Incontinence -related QOL (I -QOL) will be increased in the TTNS group compared 
to the controls and from baseline.  
Hypothesis 2.2: Anticholinergic side effects will be decreased in the TTNS group at 3 -months 
compared to the controls and from baseline.  
 
2. Primary Objectives  
 
OBJECTIVE: to advance the science and care around bladder function and management among 
people with spi[INVESTIGATOR_46482]/disease (SCI/D) and NLUTD with TTNS (and if so, we anticipate 
translating this research to other populations with NLUTD). Specifically, we seek to demonstrate 
that TTNS will improve NLUTD in SCI/D by:  
 
1. intervening acutely with neuromodulation of the neurogenic bladder via TTNS to maintain 
bladder capacity by [CONTACT_46508], DH and  DSD;  
 
2. altering  pathologic  autonomic  nervous  system  (ANS)  responses  and reducing  autonomic 
dysreflexia  (AD).  
 
3. improving the quality of life (QOL) of those living with SCI/D by [CONTACT_1541] a feasible, non - 
pharmacologic, and dignified intervention for NLUTD that can be performed at  home;  
 
In this proposed study, we seek to provide evidence for overall objective #3 usin g home TTNS. We 
hypothesize that TTNS can be used in the home setting to maintain continence while reducing 
OAB medication dosages and improve quality of life.  
 
Primary Objective 1: Evidence of TTNS efficacy with reduced OAB medication dosage 
Primary Objec tive 2: Evidence of TTNS efficacy with reduced NGB symptoms as measured by 
[CONTACT_46509]  
 
 
3. Secondary  Objectives

Page  14 of 33 IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0518 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 10/20/2020   
 Secondary Objective 1: I-QOL scores will be increased in the TTNS group compared to the 
controls  
 
Secondary Objec tive 2: Anticholinergic side effects will be reduced in the TTNS group compared 
to the controls.  
 
4. Potential Risks and  Benefits:  
 
a. End Points - Efficacy  
Primary Objective 1: Evidence of TTNS efficacy with a greater proportion of bladder medication 
reduction in the TTNS group compared to the control group. Time to achieve this endpoint will be 
approximately [ADDRESS_49063] 
recruitment.  
 
Priamry Objective 2: Evidence of TTNS efficacy with reduced NGB symptoms as measured by 
[CONTACT_46510]. Time to achieve this endpoint will be approximately [ADDRESS_49064] recruitment.  
 
b. End Points - Quality of  Life 
 
Secondary Objective 1: Improved QOL in the TTNS group compared to the controls at the end of 
the [ADDRESS_49065] recruitment.  
 
Secondary Objective 2: Decreased anticholinergic side effects in the TTNS group compared to 
the controls at the end of the [ADDRESS_49066]. 0813, 2020

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 10/20/[ADDRESS_49067] Infection (UTI) risk:  
We expect the rates of morbidity to be the same between those who participate and those who do 
not. However, because UTI is directly related to the bladder, we will focus on the occurrence of 
UTI. Based on literature, the overall rate of UTI in SCI is abou t 2.[ADDRESS_49068] the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_46483] 20% UTI rate using lower 90% exact Blyth -Still- 
Casella confidence bounds . If the number of patients with UTI exceed [ADDRESS_49069] comprised of SCI experts.  
 
Bladder medication disco ntinuation risk:  
- Worsened incontinence  
 
Electric Stimulation Risks:  
Electric stimulation is commonly performed on the extremities of those with spi[INVESTIGATOR_46484]. There are few adverse reactions to electric stimulation. The comm on ones 
include:  
- Pain with electric stimulation: in these cases, the intensity is reduced until it is  comfortable.  
- Skin irritation: it is common for redness to occur on the skin at the site of the surface 
electrode. This typi[INVESTIGATOR_46485]. In some 
cases, the redness remains the next day. In these cases, they are likely sensitive to  the 
adhesive used and a hypoallergenic skin electrode will be  provided.  
 
 
3. STUDY POPULATION  
 
1. List the number of subjects to be  enrolled . 
60 subjects. Consecutive SCI clinic encounters meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be 
asked to enroll. Children and pregnant women will be excluded.  
 
2. Criteria for  Recruitment  
 
- Initial screening will be performed in the clinic with the subject and  PI 
- In those interested, they will be given an IRB -approved consent form to review and to  sign.  
- Those  with tetraplegia  will unlikely  have  the ability  to sign and we will have  a 3rd party  attest  to 
the consent.  
- Patients  will ideally  decide  to participate  in clinic,  but can always  decide  at a later date and 
return to clinic to trial the TTNS as part of the I/E  criteria.  
- Flyers will be posted and distributed in the outpatient clinic to incre ase study  awareness.

TTNS protocol:  Same TTNS setting will be used as protocols HSC -MS-15-0806 and  HSC -MS- 
17-0423. Electrodes 2 inch by 2 inch will be placed according to anatomic landmarks, with the 
negative electrode behind the internal malleolus and the positive electrode 10cm superior to 
the negative electrode, verified with rhythmic flexion of the  toes secondary to stimulation of 
the flexor digitorum and hallicus brevis. The intensity level will be set to the amperage 
immediately under the threshold for motor contraction. If there is not contraction seen, 
patients will be excluded. In addition, if the patient perceives pain, the intensity will be lowered 
until comfortable. Stimulation frequency of 10 Hz and pulse width of 200ms in continuous 
mode will be used.13, 14 
 
Sham protocol and rationale:  Toe flexion will be attempted, as in the TTNS protocol . Then the 
stimulation will be reduced to 1 mA for 30 minutes. Rationale:  In order to make this a 
convincing blind, the TTNS protocol must be simulated closely as subjects may interact and 
discuss. Rather than turning the device off, they will be instructe d that the stimulation required 
is below motor threshold, at 1 mA. Based on the knowledge of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_46487] 
40mA for TTNS, and the amperage for needle -driven PTNS adjacent to the tibial nerve at 0.5  
– 1mA, it is unrealistic that 1mA via su rface electrodes is sufficient to activate the tibial nerve. 
Both TTNS and sham participants will be instructed to use the device for 30 minutes, 5 days 
per week.  
 
Medication reduction protocol:  Subjects will be using up to [ADDRESS_49082], tolerable dose and we will attempt weaning the following  week.

data spreadsheet. Missing data will be requested from the attending physician or directly  
from the  patient.  
b. Transcutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TTNS) will be placed by [CONTACT_46512] I/E criteria. Skin inspection will 
be performed before and after the trial stimulation session a t the electrode sites.  Blood 
pressure will also be monitored during this trial for an additional safety measure to 
ensure autonomic dysreflexia is not  occurring.  
c. The Bladder diary will be used to collect data use of TTNS with amperage and  presence 
of toe f lexion, pain score 0 -10, as well as incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_46488]. The 
research assistant (RA) will call weekly to capture the written data and monitor progress 
with the  protocol.  
d. The RA will also perform the survey outcome measures (NBSS, I -QOL,CD -RISC, GSE, 
Medication adherence surveys and anticholinergic side effect questionnaire) at  baseline 
every 4 weeks, 6 weeks and at 3 -months. Surveys can be conducted over the 
telephone.  
 
2. Randomization and  Blinding  
 
Subjects will be randomized to either TTNS or sham control (1:1) using a block 
size of 4 and stratified based on complete/incomplete SCI to ensure the equal 
allocation of the most severely injured in the two groups. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_46489], managed by [CONTACT_46513].

 4. Study Visits and  Procedures  
 
- Screening Visits and  Procedures  
 
Screening will be performed in the SCI clinic by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -I SCI attendings.  
 
Those that meet the I/E criteria will be approached for the study by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -I attendings. 
They have until the study period is complete to decide whether they want to participate.  
However, they will have to return to clinic to have the TTNS trial perf ormed and the directions for 
home use.  
 
- Study Visits and  Procedures  
 
Subjects will have their first study visit after their normal clinic visit. Once consented, we will trial 
TTNS for a response of toe flexion. If they have a response, they will be inclu ded in the study. If 
no response or not tolerating electric stimulation, they will not be included in the study.  
 
Participants will have direction in clinic on the use of the Stamobil+, including written, oral, and 
smartphone images/video if they have acce ss. 
 
The electric stimulation protocol will use stimulation frequency of [ADDRESS_49090] the subjects to remind them to begin recording in their voiding  
diary for 2  days.

 8. TREATMENT  
1. Rationale for Selection of  Dose  
 
Neuromodulation of the bladder is currently available with percutaneou s TNS in the clinic 
setting, for a variety of patient populations. Stimulation frequency of 10 Hz and pulse width of 
200ms in continuous mode will be used.13,14 
 
Neuromodulation of the bladder has been shown to be effective after 6 -8 sessions, with 
session s performed once weekly over 12 weeks or 3 times weekly. The 30 minute stimulation 
session is commonly used for bladder neuromodulation.23, 24

Page  28 of 33 IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0518 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 10/20/[ADDRESS_49094] will be used, as followed: An 
unanticipated adverse device effect as defined by [CONTACT_46514] 2CFR 812.3(s) – Any 
serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a 
supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with 
a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
Skin irritation, inflammation, and electrode burn beneath the electrodes are potential adverse 
events directly related to the use of electric stimulation.  
 
 
2. Collecting, Recording and Reporting of Adverse  Events  
 
The Investigator will be responsible for collecting and reporting adverse events during the UDS. 
The research assistant and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_46490]. 
 
Grading of the severity of the adverse events will be m ade by [CONTACT_978], using the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 developed by [CONTACT_29630]. The 
relevant “Burn” category is included below.

 3. Safety Monitoring  Plan  
 
The Data Safety Mon itoring Plan (DSMP) for the research study includes periodic statistical 
analysis on rates of morbidity of study participants compared to controls by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_46494]. Because of the rolling recruitment in the proposed protocol, we anticipate th e 
number of recruited individuals will be sufficient for morbidity review quarterly.  
 
Specifically, we will focus on the occurrence of UTI. We hypothesize that the rate of UTIs in 
TTNS group will be similar to the SCI population. Based on literature, the o verall rate of UTI in 
SCI is about 2.[ADDRESS_49096] the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_46495] 20% UTI rate using lower 90% exact Blyth -Still-Casella confidence bounds. If the number of 
patients with UTI exceed [ADDRESS_49097]. 0813, 2020

 10. DATA  ANALYSIS  
1. Data Quality  Assurance  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_46496]. Single data entry will be 
performed with plans to check 10% of primary variables as a quality control. Single data entry 
error rates are slightly higher than 0.5% when performed by [CONTACT_46515].25 Data anomalies will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_46497] /or correction 
will be performed. Incomplete entries will be reviewed and corrected if information is available.  
 
 
2. Data Entry and  Storage  
 
Data will be entered on a UTH google drive spreadsheet file, with permission to access 
controlled by [CONTACT_978]. Data collected by [CONTACT_46516]. Data will be coded by [CONTACT_9178].  
 
The RA will have the linking log of the patients to their subject ID in her password -protected 
desktop in the TIRR Memorial Hermann Research building.

 11. SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL  METHODS  
 
1. Determination of Sample  Size 
 
Sample size will be determined from Aim 1.1 . Assuming that 40% o f the subjects in the control 
group are able to reduce their bladder medications (placebo effect), the study would require a 
sample size of 21 for each group (i.e. a total sample size of 42), to achieve a power of 80% for 
detecting a difference in proporti ons of 43% between the two groups (83% in TTNS group – 40% 
in control group) at a two sided p -value of 0.05. Accounting for 40% dropout, we will recruit 30 
subjects in each arm for a total of 60 subjects. In Aim 1.2 , the NBSS has demonstrated 
responsivenes s to change after bladder chemodenervation with a mean difference of 11.8 
(11),22 which would require a sample size of 20. For Aim 2.1 , a 7±[ADDRESS_49099], estimated as 3 
points. With power of 80% and a more conservative standard deviation of [ADDRESS_49100] at a type I error rate of 0.05. The 
sample size determined by [CONTACT_45061] 1.1 is sufficient for this  aim. 
 
2. Statistical and Analytical  Plans  
Patients will be randomized to control and TTNS at a 1:[ADDRESS_49101].  
Descriptive statistics and mean plots will be provided for the longitudinal measurements. 
Multilevel mixed -effects regression models will be used for longitudinal analyses of treatment 
effects, controlling for confounding variables including age, sex, seve rity of SCI, compliance 
(number of sessions), and OAB medication dosages. Multiple testing will be adjusted by 
[CONTACT_46517]. Non -random missing data will be analyzed using the 
method in Ibrahim and Molenberghs.[ADDRESS_49102] on some outcomes by [CONTACT_22518] (frequentist) 
analyses. We plan a Bayesian analysis (with either skeptical or neutral priors) to estimate the 
probability (with 95% credible interval s) of treatment effect. Conventional analysis will be 
performed in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary NC) and Bayesian analysis will be performed in  R 
3.5.0 using packages like R2WinBUGS.

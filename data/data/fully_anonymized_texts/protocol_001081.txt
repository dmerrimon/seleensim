IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/2020            Summary of the amendment  
The protocol is being revised with inclusion of an additional cohort that would allow testing a 
combination of the CMVPepVax vaccine and a newly approved anti -viral agent Prevymis (letermovir) in 
order to address possible synergy between CMV suppression by [CONTACT_505493] -CMV 
immunity by [CONTACT_505494]. For this purpose the accrual of the cohort including 61 patients not 
administered Prevymis is closed, and accrual of a new cohort of 36 patie nts is proposed where all 
patients would be administered Prevymis and co-administered CMVPepVax or placebo (blinded and 
randomized 1:1).  
This new design will allow addressing the unmet need of stimulating CMV -specific immunity and 
lowering reactivation ri sk for patients after cessation of Prevymis dosing .

Participating Sites:

Center, Ohio State University , Emory University  
Rationale for this Study:  
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation with ensuing viremia is one of the main infectious complications 
in the first 100 days following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)  [1-6].   While anti-viral 
agents that limit viral replication may keep CMV viremia initially in check, they may also result in 
significant toxicity and fail to protect against late -onset CMV disease, including reactivation and failure 
to reconstitute CMV-specific immunity .  
CMVPepVax (IND BB -[ZIP_CODE]) is a peptide vaccine composed of an antigenic HLA A*0201 restricted 
pp65495-503 CMV CD8 cytotoxic T cell (CTL) epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230], covalently linked to a universal tetanus T helper 
(TH) epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] [7] and co-administered with [COMPANY_007] PF -03512676 adjuvant [8].  HLA-restricted peptide 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_462436] a promis ing option to develop a safe, non -infectious subunit CMV vaccine, avoiding CMV 
immune-evasion mechanisms  [9]. Moreover, it has been reported that T cells specific for CMV -pp65, a 
principal target for CTLs can protect HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505391]  [9, 10]. The PF-03512676 
adjuvant is a single strand DNA -based sequence containing bacterial CpG DNA motifs, which activates 
Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9) leading to potent immunostimulatory effects, such as B cell and NK cell

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/2020            activation and proinflammatory cytokine prod uction. 
A Phase Ib trial conducted in HLA A*0201 healthy adults (COH IRB [ZIP_CODE]) indicates that CMVPepVax is 
safe and induces robust expansion of CMV -pp65 CD8 T cells in the healthy adult population [8]. A 
second Phase 1b pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (COH IRB [ZIP_CODE]) was conducted in CMV seropositive  HLA A*0201 adult 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505392] (MRD) or unrelated donor (MUD) HCT. A total of 36 patients were 
randomized to Vaccine Arm (VA) or Observation Arm (OA); those who were assigned to VA received 
CMVPepVax on days [ADDRESS_652037] and those in OA were followed for clinical and immunologic 
data monitoring (open label).  
Preliminary results from this target population indicate excellent tolerability, safety and 
immunogenicity of CMVPepVax compared to the observation arm. CMV viremia (DNAemi a) was 
observed in [ADDRESS_652038] that CMVPepVax may improve transplant related outcomes such as chronic 
GVHD (cGVHD) and disease relapse. Now that safety and preliminary immunogenicity have been 
established in the target population with the day [ADDRESS_652039] CMV reactivation and disease.   
 
Rationale for the revised aims and design based on the interim analysis:  
The interim analysis (after 48 patients reached day 100 follow up) for the primary endpoint (Section 
12.4 Data Analysis Plan) unexpectedly showed that more CMV events observed on the vaccine arm (5 
events) than on the placebo arm (3 events), thus meeting t he futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]. Additional data on 
these 48 patients (24 in CMVPepVax arm, 24 in placebo arm) are detailed in Table 2.5.  While the 
clinical efficacy was not seen for the primary endpoint, the immunologic recovery was favorable for 
the CMVPepVax arm, and no safety issues have been found. Taking the abovementioned finding into 
account the cohort of patients that were enrolled initially (61 patient)  is now closed for accrual. Anti-
viral agent Prevymis was approved for CMV prophylaxis after the stud y was initiated, and while 
CMVPepVax is not currently thought to be a suitable alternative for Prevymis administration, it can 
possibly address the significant risk of CMV reactivation that occurs  after the completion of Prevymis 
administration [11]. This unmet need motivated the amendment of the protocol for  the study to 
include an additional cohort, which could verify a possible synergy in treatment of the patients with a 
combination of Prevymis and CMVPepVax. Complementing antivirals with a vaccine that harnesses the 
abundant native immune response to CMV m ay improve outcomes for HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  [12]. In addition, 
this approach may allow achieving protective immunity ahead of the early reactivation that may occur 
during the prophylaxis period and was observed in the absence of Prevymis prophylaxis. Because 7 of 
the 8 primary outcomes occurred prior to  the second planned injection, the rationale for using 
CMVPepVax in the context of Prevymis prophylaxis is thought to be directly relevant to the nature of 
the events that led to early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007].

100), comparable to the evaluation of an expansion cohort in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], or the futilit y 
stage of a phase II trial.  
2)   To determine if CMVPepVax increases levels, function and kinetics of CMV -specific T cell 
immunity in vaccinated HCT patients who receive standard Prevymis prophylaxis. 
 
Secondary Objectives:  
1. To determine, within the constraints of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_138886],  if CMVPepVax reduces the 
frequency of CMV events alone or in combination with Prevymis defined as reactivation or 
CMV disease in HLA A*[ADDRESS_652041] -R+.  A CMV event encompasses any detection 
of CMV by [CONTACT_505495] (term ed “reactivation”: DNAemia ≥500 gc/ml or by [CONTACT_505496] 
(end-organ disease).  
2. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CMVPepVax by [CONTACT_161200]:  non -
relapse mortality (NRM) at [ADDRESS_652042], severe (grade 3 -4) acute GVHD (aGVHD), 
and grade 3-4 AEs (CTCAE 4.0) probably or definitely related to the vaccination within 2 
weeks from each vaccination.  
3. To characterize CMV reactivation and CMV disease in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505393] (defined as num ber of days from transplantation 
to the date of ≥500 CMV gc/mL), duration of viremia, recurrence of viremia, incidence of 
late CMV viremia/disease (>100 and ≤ [ADDRESS_652043]), use of antiviral drugs (triggered 
by [CONTACT_505497], cumulati ve number of CMV specific antiviral treatment 
days. To evaluate the impact of CMVPepVax on transplant related outcomes by [CONTACT_505498] (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), relapse, non -relapse 
mortality, all-cause mortality, non-CMV infections.  
4. To determine whether vaccination induces adaptive NK cell population changes, and 
increase in the highly cytotoxic memory NKG2C + NK cells,  
5. To determine the impact of CMVPepvax on CMV immune reconstitution in patients who 
undergo treatment with an tiviral agent Prevymis 
6. To explore GVHD biomarkers and compare between the vaccine and placebo groups,  
7. To characterize CMV reactivation after day 180  
 
 
Study Design: 
Overall design:  
 This is a multi-center, randomized, blinded, placebo -controlled, parallel -group Phase II trial to 
evaluate: a) increase in CMV cellular immunity, in HLA A*[ADDRESS_652044] -R+ vaccinated with 
CMVPepVax relative to those injected with placebo , b) reduction in the frequency of CMV reactivation 
and disease (CMV events) . This trial is designed to 1:1 randomly allocate  97 HLA A*[ADDRESS_652045] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505390] 8 of 91 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/[ADDRESS_652046]-R+ at risk for CMV complications to CMVPepVax arm or placebo arm  [13].  
The revised protocol after the interim analysis will enr oll 36 patients (18 in the CMVPepVax arm, 18 in 
the placebo arm) to provide an initial evaluation of vaccination in combination with Prevymis to help 
plan future studies if the futility endpoint is not met  and T-cell results are favorable . Final immunologic 
analysis will include both the new (n=36) cohort as a subgroup and combined cohort s (n=97). 
Treatment categories for the 18 vs 18 cohort include either Prevymis + CMVPepVax, or Prevymis + 
Placebo. No treatment category in this cohort incl udes CMVPepVax only, placebo only, or CMVPepVax 
+ placebo.  
 
Enrollment and randomization:   
The enrolment and randomization of the Prevymis cohort will continue as originally planned. Eligible 
HCT-R+ will be consented and enrolled pre -HCT, and registered th rough the COH data coordinating 
center (COH-DCC). A computer-generated randomization program, stratified by [CONTACT_505499]; the treatment assignment will be 
generated and provided to  site pharmacists, who are unmasked to treatment -group allocation,  in 
advance of planned vaccination. Registered  participants will be followed for the course of tra nsplant 
and be assessed for vaccine administration criteria  for ‘Day-[ADDRESS_652047]’ vaccination. Participants who 
meet vaccine administration criteria  will receive the vaccine ; participants who do not meet criteria  will 
discontinue study participation and be replaced.  Only participants who receive a vaccine (CMVPepVax 
or placebo) will be considered “randomized”. Information regarding registered participants who do 
not receive vaccine will be entered into the computer -generated randomization program to inform the 
randomization algorithm for subsequent treatment assignments.   
After the interim analysis of [ADDRESS_652048] closed 
accrual of the initial cohort (61 patients) who did not receive Prevymis and propose to enroll a new 
cohort of 36 patients to be assigned to either CMVPepVax, or placebo groups , and all of whom will 
concurrently receive Prevymis. Every patient in the new cohort of 36 patients (18 vs 18) will receive 
Prevymis as standard of care. The combined enrollment will be conducted up to a total of 97 patients. 
Administration of CMVPepVax/Placebo:  A 1 ml volume of vaccine (CMVPepVax or placebo) is 
administered subcutaneously (SC) on days [ADDRESS_652049].  
Administration of Prevymis : Patients in both Prevymis arms will receive Prevymis at a dose of [ADDRESS_652050]. 
Duration of participation : Study participation will be completed on Day [ADDRESS_652051] for all 
participants who receive vaccine or placebo administration. P articipants who do not receive a vaccine 
or placebo administration will discontinue further follow -up once the determination is made that the 
injection will not be administered.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_505394]:   Rigorous stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_505395], and will 
include three major safety endpoints; non -relapse mortality (NRM) at [ADDRESS_652052], severe 
(grade 3-4) acute GVHD (aGVHD),  and serious AEs (SAE, grade 3 -4) related to the vaccination within [ADDRESS_652053] 48 patients are 
evaluable for the primary endpoint (frequency of CMV reactivation before day 100 ). If the observed 
CMV event-rate in the  CMVPepVax arm is higher than on the placebo arm, the study will be 
suspended for NCI and DSMC review  [14].   The loss of power of invoking a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_505396] 50% of  
accrual is less than 0.02  [14], under the event rate s assumed for planning.  In light of the lower

Endpoints: 
Primary endpoint s:     
For the entire cohort (n=97): Immunological endpoints  - levels of CD8+ T cells binding to A2 -CMV-
dextramers®, combined with T and NK cell phenotype and function. 
For the combination cohort (n=36) : CMV reactivation  [≥1,250 IU/mL] or CMV disease between day [ADDRESS_652055] Prevymis prophylaxis (from day 14 through 
day 100). 
Secondary endpoints:  
Key safety endpoints:  Non-relapse mortality (NRM) at [ADDRESS_652056], severe (grade 3 -4) aGVHD, 
and grade 3-4 AEs (CTCAE 4.0) probably or  definitely related to the vaccination within 2 weeks from 
each vaccination.  
CMV reactivation  [≥1,250 IU/mL] or CMV disease prior to day [ADDRESS_652057]. Timing and recurrence of 
events are included in the primary analysis.  
CMV-related endpoints:   Duration of viremia, incidence of late CMV viremia (>100 and ≤ [ADDRESS_652058]), use of antiviral drugs (triggered by [CONTACT_505497]), cumulative number of CMV 
specific antiviral treatment days.  
Clinical endpoints:  Time to engraftment, incidence of aGVHD, chronic GVHD (cGVHD), relapse, non-
relapse mortality, all -cause mortality, non-CMV infections.   
Immunologic endpoints for the combination cohort (n=36): Immune reconstitution measured as levels, 
function and kinetics of CMV -specific T cells through day [ADDRESS_652059] Prevymis prophylaxis (day 14 through day 100) . 
Sample Size: 
The target of this Phase II multicenter study was originally to randomize 97 HLA A*[ADDRESS_652060]-R+ to either the CMVPepVax  vaccine arm (N=48), or to the placebo arm (N=48). With the expected 
dropout rate of 10-15% prior to randomization, the total accrual is expected to be 106 -115.   
Following the results of the interim analysis the original cohort (n=61) that included patien ts without 
Prevymis administration is closed for accrual.  
New cohort (Prevymis cohort) is opening for accrual in which 36 patients will be randomized 1:1 
(18/18) for CMVPepVax or Placebo.  The number of patients for this cohort (36 patients) is based on 
budgetary constraints, the futility rules for the new cohort are independent and are based on the 
original futility rules.  Based on a Phase III trial of Prevymis, we expect [ADDRESS_652061] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505390] 10 of 91 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/2020            the power for a non -futile finding.  
If CMVPepVax offers no protection, there would be a 50 perc ent chance of a futility finding, and T -cell 
data would likely indicate many subjects with poor CMVPepVax antigen recognition. If CMVPepVax has 
strong protection (5% reactivation), a finding of futility is unlikely (12 percent) and an evident 
biological effect would be expected in most patients.  
 
Estimated Duration of the Study  
Over the past five years, COH and UMN combined have performed on -average ~ [ADDRESS_652062] procedures annually. We anticipate about 70 to be eligible annually being HLA A*0201 and CMV 
seropositive. It is estimated that accrual will be completed in < [ADDRESS_652063] Eligibility Criteria:

*Participants who do not meet vaccine administration crit eria will be removed from the trial and 
replaced. This is not an eligibility criteria for the trial. 
Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:  
Participants will be randomized to receive either  CMVPepVax vaccine or the placebo vaccine.  The 
pharmacy will know the randomization status of participants, while the clinical study team and 
participants will r emain blinded. Vaccine (1 ml of placebo or CMVPepVax) will be administered 
subcutaneously in the upper a rm on Days [ADDRESS_652068]. Time window for the administration is 
+/- [ADDRESS_652069] meet vaccine administration 
criteria in order to receive the vaccine.  
CMVPepVax vaccine is constituted of approx. 2.5 mg Tet-CMV + 1.08 mg PF-03512676[8] adjuvant 
diluted in normal saline and sodium acetate.   
Placebo vaccine comprises an isotonic solution of cGMP -grade solution of sodium acetate and NeutTM 
(0.4% Sodium Bicarbonate Additive Solution).   
 
Clinical Observations and Tests to be Performed: 
Clinical observations/clinical tests:  Medical history, physical exams, performance status, routine 
laboratory tests (CBC, chemistry panel), CMV qPCR, GVHD assessment, AE assessment, diagnostics for 
disease relapse assessment (bone marrow and im aging studies), diagnostics for CMV disease 
assessment,  according to institutional standard of care. All of the study endpoints listed above will be 
monitored and recorded. Clinical CMV disease and use of anti -viral drugs will be prospectively 
monitored and recorded. 
Immunologic studies:  Immunologic studies will include monitoring  levels of CD8+ T cells binding to 
pp65 A2-CMV-dextramers®, combined with immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_50391]  [15, 16].  The phenotypic 
ratios of CMV-specific T cells will be related to improvement in control of CMV viremia. Highly 
cytotoxic memory NKG2C+ NK cells [17], linked to CMV reactivation and critical for CMV adaptive 
immune response will be characterized at UMN  [18-20].   
Statistical Considerations:  
Planning for measures of immune function is based on results of COH protocol [ZIP_CODE], the open -label 
analog of this placebo -controlled protocol.  In that trial, 10 of 18 vaccinated subjects developed CMV 
pp65-specific CD8+ T-cells that were strongly concentrated (> 80% ) in effector memory phenotypes, 
and did so without CMV reactivation.  This can be compared to 1 of 14 non -vaccinated subjects who 
did not reactivate.  In the current study, the planned sample size of 48 subjects per arm would provide 
approximately 80% power for a one -sided 0.05-level test assuming a 50% rate of this event fro m a 25% 
rate on the placebo arm.  Beyond this meas ure of vaccine-induced immune function, the data will be 
used to describe the longitudinal changes in immune function with and without vaccine, in subjects to 
do and do not reactivate CMV. With this amendment, we will similarly describe the longitudinal 
changes in patients receiving Prevymis as prophylaxis. The combined analysis T -cell data using all 
subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_505500], and the original power calculation remains relevan t to this 
comparison. 
CMVPepVax vs. Placebo for the control of CMV in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505390] 12 of 91 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/[ADDRESS_652070] a reduction in CMV reactivation from 40% to 15% at [ADDRESS_652071], providing 
90% power at one -sided 10% significance level (these are the typi[INVESTIGATOR_505397]  [21]).  The aim of detecting an overall benefit in all vaccinate patients has 
been abandoned after the interim analysis for futility, and continued enrollment is based on the new 
primary aims.  
 
The comparison of CMV event rates across CMVPepVax arms for the new Prevymis cohort is motivated 
as a futility analysis, for informing a subseque nt decision about further development of CMVPepVax.  
The Operating characteristics of that evaluation, analogous to the power of a hypothesis test, are 
described above, under Sample size.  
Formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_505398]. Clinical data will be 
monitored as they accumulate, and investigation of CMVPepVax will be suspended for safety review if 
there is evidence of serious treatment -related AEs. 
Monitoring of the Prevymis  cohort will, as described above, be done conservatively as both a 
continued monitoring of a series of patients receiving CMVPepVax, and as monitoring of a new series 
of patients receiving CMVPepVax in combination with Prevymis.  
 
Specifically: 
(1)  [ADDRESS_652072] on the vaccine arm reaches the 
100 day evaluation point.  Operationally, the CRA will notify the monitoring statistician as cohorts of 24 
patients (12 vaccinated) near the 100 day  mark. If NRM frequencies exceed 4, 6, or 8, at the 
designated 100 day evaluation point, then the trial will be suspended for safety review by [CONTACT_505501]. These numbers were selected to limit the overall false -alarm probability for thi s 
endpoint to less than 0.02 when there is no additional risk due to immunization.  
 (2) Severe acute GVHD (aGVHD, grade 3 -4) will be monitored as every 12th subject on the vaccine arm 
reaches the 100 day evaluation point. aGVHD will be scored using Keyston e consensus criteria [22]. The 
trial will be interrupted at each respective center for safety review by [CONTACT_505502] [ADDRESS_652073] 12 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], or 9 of 24, or 11 of 36, experience Grade 3-4 aGVHD.  This 
would be a significant elevation from the COH/UMN historical benchmark of  15% of allogeneic HCT 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505399]  [23].  These rules are determined to limit the overall aGVHD 
false alarm probability to 0.02 if vaccination does not increase risk  [23].

Primary Objective s:  
For the entire cohort (n=97):  
1) To determine if CMVPepVax  increases levels, function and kinetics of CMV -specific T cell immunity in 
vaccinated compared to placebo treated HLA A*0201, CMV seropositive HCT -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840],  
For the Prevymis combination cohort (n=36)  
1) To provide a preliminary evaluation of  the incidence of CMV reactivation between day [ADDRESS_652091] Prevymis prophylaxis (from day 14 through day 100) , 
comparable to the evaluation of an expansion cohort in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], or the futility stage of a 
phase II trial 
2)  To determine if CMVPepVax increases levels, function and kinetics of CMV -specific T cell 
immunity in vaccinated HCT patients who receive standard Prevymis prophylaxis. 
 
Secondary Objectives :  
1. To determine, within the constraints of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_138886],  if CMVPepVax reduces the frequency of 
CMV events alone or in combination with Prevymis defined as reactivation or CMV disease in 
HLA A*[ADDRESS_652092] -R+.  A CMV event encompasses any detection of CMV by [CONTACT_505505] (termed “reactivation”: DNAemia ≥500 gc/ml  or by [CONTACT_505496] (end -organ disease).  
2. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CMVPepVax by [CONTACT_161200]:  non -relapse 
mortality (NRM) at [ADDRESS_652093], severe (grade 3 -4) acute GVHD (aGVHD), and grade 3 -4 
AEs (CTCAE 4.0) probably or definitely related to the vaccination within 2 weeks from each 
vaccination. 
3. To characterize CMV reactivation and CMV disease in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505407] (defined as number of days fr om transplantation to the 
date of ≥500 CMV gc/mL), duration of viremia, recurrence of viremia, incidence of late CMV 
viremia/disease (>100 and ≤ [ADDRESS_652094]), use of antiviral drugs (triggered by [CONTACT_505506], cumulative number of C MV specific antiviral treatment days.  To evaluate the

2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
Human CMV is a highly prevalent, globally -occurring infection that rarely elicits disease in healthy 
immunocompetent hosts. The human immune system is unable to clear CMV infection and latency, but 
mounts a spi[INVESTIGATOR_505408] -defense targeting multiple immune -evasion genes encoded by [CONTACT_505508] -
stranded DNA β-herpes virus. Encoding around [ADDRESS_652096] complex 
of known viruses  [9]. The size of the CMV -specific cellular immune response is the most striking aspect 
of the dynamic, life -long interaction between the host and CMV. CMV-specific T cells are essential to 
restrain CMV viral replication and prevent disease, though do not eliminate the virus or preclude 
transmission. 
Significant suppression of host antiviral immunity can alter the life -or-death immune surveillance 
homeostasis, allowing either CMV reactivation to become detectable or primary infection to cause 
clinical symptoms. Uncontrolled viral replication and dissemination results in the development of life -
threatening end -organ damage (CMV disease)  [24-26]. CMV infection is the cause of major 
complications and significant morbidity in the recovery of immune -compromised recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505409]- HCT [3, 5, 6]. HCT patients are vulnerable to herpes virus infections, including CMV, 
as a result of immunosuppression associated with treatment strategies aimed at preventing rejection or 
GVHD [27-29]. Pharmacologic agents used to limit virus replication, such as, GCV or its oral form VAL, 
and FOS have become the methods of choice for prophylaxis of CMV infection  [3, 30]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], CMV 
remains an important cause of mortality after HCT diminishing the full curative potential of this 
successful cancer therapy  [10, 31]. Furthermore, anti -viral chemotherapy has major side effects, 
including nephroto xicity, neutropenia, and delayed immune reconstitution which exposes HCT 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505410], bacterial and fungal infections  [6, 32]. For example, the use of 
GCV/VAL is associated with a higher pr oportion of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505411]  [6, 32]. As GCV/VAL therapy has become ubiquitous in practice, 
delayed onset of CMV -pneumonia (interstitial pneumonitis, IP) is more freque nt which suggests that 
GCV/VAL impairs immunologic reconstitution  [33, 34]. When antivirals are stopped or when virus 
resistance occurs, the same disease symptoms appear; only frame shifted to ~[ADDRESS_652097] [5, 35-
37]. Thus, different strategies to control CMV are eagerly sought, since  antivirals are at best a stop -gap 
measure, and their use does not address the major risks of late -onset CMV-IP including early CMV 
reactivation and failure to reconstitute CMV -specific immunity  [31]. Additionally costs associated with 
the usage of antivirals are significant, with one single course of GCV/VAL reaching $25,000.  
Prevymis has been approved by [CONTACT_505509][INVESTIGATOR_505412].  
In a separate cohort we are intending to study the highly novel combination of Prevymis and 
CMVPepVax vaccine developed by [CONTACT_502256]. This comb ination has no overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685], and is 
potentially synergistic, or at least should possess additive protective effect for CMV infection. This is 
particularly promising since CMV -specific T cell immune reconstitution has not been described in 
patients receiving Prevymis, and late CMV reactivation after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_505413] [ADDRESS_652098] 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] ([ADDRESS_652099]) may reduce CMV morbidity and the use of antivirals  [12]. It has 
been shown that control of CMV infection is primarily associated with cellular immune responses  [38].  
The abundant tegument pp65 protein is a major contributor to shapi[INVESTIGATOR_100025] T cell repertoire in CMV -
CMVPepVax vs. Placebo for the control of CMV in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505390] 20 of 91 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/2020            exposed individuals  [39-41], and is a principal target for HLA Class I -restricted CD8+ CTL [9]. CMV-
infected cells express pp65 both early and late after infection, making it an appropriate v accine target 
[42-45]. Early clinical studies showed that pp65 CTL development is necessary to overcome CMV disease 
in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  [2, 46, 47]. Adoptive transfer of pp65 -specific CTL reduced CMV viremia after HCT in 
Phase I trials [48-52].  In patients who have measurable CMV viremia, expansion of pp65 specific CD8+ T 
cells occurs, especially after viral reactivation  [53, 54].  In agreement with those observations, studies 
showed that CMV reactivation and disease were detectable only in patients with low level of CMV -
tetramer+ CD8+ T cells [10, 55]. Importantly, several reports have associated protection from CMV 
complications in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505414]-specific CD8+ T cell levels (including pp65 -specific T cells) 
between 7-10/µL [10, 13]. A vaccine that induces protective levels of pp65 CTL has the potential to be of 
therapeutic benefit to an HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505415]  [9, 10, 43-45, 48, 52, 56].  
Our group has identified a repertoire of CTL epi[INVESTIGATOR_505416]65 protein that can expand human 
pp65-specific memory CTLs in vitro [39, 40, 57]. The pp65495-503 epi[INVESTIGATOR_505417] A*0201 allele has been extensively characterized  [39-41]. Usage of the pp65495-503 CTL epi[INVESTIGATOR_505418]  [40, 57, 58]. Additionally, using HLA-
restricted CTL epi[INVESTIGATOR_505419] a non -infectious subunit CMV vaccine can eliminate the safety 
concerns for HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505420] -attenuated CMV or recombinant live viral vaccines, while avoiding 
the many CMV-encoded products involved in immune-evasion [43, 59, 60].  
We discovered that covalently linking the pp65 CTL epi[INVESTIGATOR_505421], dramatically enhanced the immunogenicity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_505422]  [7, 8]. In HLA A*0201 Tg mice, 
two candidate vaccine peptides containing the HLA A*0201  pp65 495-503 CD8+ T cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_505423] T H epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] (either the synthetic PADRE or a natural Tetanus sequence)  showed favorable 
immunogenicity profiles  [7, 8, 61, 62].  The vaccine peptide s were named PADRE -CMV and Tet-CMV, 
respectively [8]. Co-injection with PF -03512676 adjuvant  (a synthetic single stranded CpG DNA with 
immunostimulatory activity  [63]) further augmented their activity, providing a means to lower vaccine 
dosage [7, 64].  
cGMP-grade PADRE-CMV and Tet-CMV, with or without PF-03512676 adjuvant were clinically evaluated 
for safety and immunogenicity. The Phase Ib dose -escalation clinical trial (COH IRB [ZIP_CODE], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]@www.clinicaltrials.gov .) was conducted in HLA A*0201 healthy adults  and indicated that 
the CMV peptides co -injected with PF-03512676 were safe and immunogenic. In particular, 2.5 mg Tet-
CMV +  PF-[ADDRESS_652100] setting [8] of this formulation of Tet-CMV combined 
with PF-03512676, which was renamed CMVPepVax.   
In HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505424]4+ T cell deficit, 
stimulation of TLR9 by [INVESTIGATOR_16335]-03512676 may substitute for the requirement of CD4 -TH to sustain immune 
responses [65]. TLR9 is implicated as an endosomal receptor for bacterial CpG DNA motifs exemplified 
by [INVESTIGATOR_16335]-03512676 [63, 66]. While immune-reconstitution can be limited in allo -HCT population, 
CMVPepVax has the potential for greater potency when injected into CMV+ HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], since 
massive expansion of pp65 -specific T cells have been shown in HCT patients under the conditions of 
CMV infection [10, 52]. Based on these findings, we performed an evaluation of safety and 
immunogenicity of two injections of CMVPepVax,  in HLA A*[ADDRESS_652101] for hematologic malignancies  (COH IRB [ZIP_CODE] 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]@www.clinicaltrials.gov .) which as of January 15th, [ADDRESS_652102] CMV positive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (R+) are randomized either to 
the CMVPepVax vaccine arm or the observational arm. HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505425] [ADDRESS_652103] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505390] 21 of 91 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/[ADDRESS_652104] predictably occurs (~day 40 -100) [35, 67].  CMVPepVax has been safely administered 
to 18 HLA A*0201 R+ patients. Preliminary results indicate excellent tolerability, safety and substantial 
increases of CMV pp65 495-[ADDRESS_652105] -R+ with 
CMVPepVax, but a crucial unattained objective is to assess vaccine  protection against CMV reactivation 
and disease by [CONTACT_505510]. Consequently, there is 
a strong rationale to test CMVPepVax using a randomized, blinded and placebo controlled Phase II 
efficacy trial. This proposed clinical study is designed to be a multicenter trial . Moreover, NCI NExT is 
providing a new lot of vaccine to support this multi -center Phase II study.  
2.[ADDRESS_652106] CMV reactivation and disease in HLA A*0201 HLA -matched 
allogeneic (related or unrelated donor) HCT R+ (CMV positive HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840])  who are at significant risk 
for CMV complica tions [13]. The primary hypothesis to be tested is that immunizing HLA A*[ADDRESS_652107]-R+ with CMVPepVax will provide superior protective benefit compar ed to a placebo.  The 
secondary hypothesis is that CMVPepVax  immunizations will induce protective leve ls of CMV cellular 
immunity in HCT-R+ [63, 68, 69]. It is anticipated that the trial will provide definitive data on vaccine -
induced protective immunity against CMV reactivation and disease, in allogeneic HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] [10].  
Participants must be planned recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22880] a first 8/8 HLA -matched [70-73] allogeneic HCT for 
hematological malignancies,  be HLA A*0201, CMV -positive, age 18 -75 (chronologic age is no longer 
considered a contraindication for HCT [74, 75]), and willing to be monitored for [ADDRESS_652108] procedure, as the prospective participant is 
likely better able to fully consider the study and provide an informed decision as the prospective 
participant’s status is more stable during this period. Vaccine administration  criteria will be assessed on 
the day of planned vaccine administration (Day [ADDRESS_652109]). The Day-28-Post-HCT criteria exclude 
participants who, post HCT, have experienced relapse of disease, have experienced CMV viremia or end 
organ disease, have received anti -viral treatment, have received high doses of steroids within 7 days of 
planned vaccine administration, or are experiencing ongoing grade 3 toxicities.   
This phase II efficacy trial will enroll and vaccinate  97 HLA A*[ADDRESS_652110] -R+, randomized 1:1 to 
either the CMVPepVax arm (N=48), or to the placebo arm (N=48). The first 61 subjects did not receive 
Prevymis, and were closed to accrual after the interim analysis, while the next cohort consisting of 36 of 
these randomized subjects will receive Prevymis treatment in addition to CMVPepVax or placebo. The 
resulting data will be stratified by [CONTACT_505511] (vaccine or placebo) and Prevymis 
administration (Prevymis or no Prevymis). Thus, the study will be blind ed for CMVPepVax and open label 
for Prevymis. Because approximately 10 -15% of enrolled participants may fail to meet post -HCT vaccine 
administration criteria, the total study accrual is expected to reach 106-115 participants. All patients in 
the new cohort (36 patients, 18 vs 18) will receive Prevymis as a  standard of care.  The size of the new 
cohort is based on the budgetary constraints of the original study plan.

predictably occurs (~day 40 -100)[35, 67]. Both the CMVPepVax and placebo agents are administered at 
a final 1.0 ml volume, in the up per arm by [CONTACT_30933].  
CMVPepVax vaccine formulation and dosage  (approx. 2.5 mg Tet-CMV + 1.08 mg PF-03512676 adjuvant  
diluted in sodium acetate) were chosen based on the data from the Phase Ib trial in healthy adults ( COH 
IRB [ZIP_CODE]), indicating mild reactogenicity and a favorable safety profile for this specific formulation when 
up to 4 SC injections were administered to healthy volunteers  [8].  Preliminary results from the 
completed Phase Ib trial (COH IRB [ZIP_CODE]) in  HLA A*[ADDRESS_652112] R+ indicate excellent 
tolerability, safety and substantial increases of CMV pp65 495-[ADDRESS_652113], the same schedule to be 
used in this study.  
CMVPepVax administration  provides a dose of 2.48 mg Tet-CMV Peptide + 1.06mg PF -03512676 when 
the vaccine is prepared using the currently available Tet -CMV (LOT#  L0402009, 11mg/1.1mL vial) . 
CMVPepVax administration provides a dose of 2.64mg Tet-CMV Peptide + 1.08mg PF -03512676 when 
the vaccine is prepared using the new lot of Tet -CMV (LOT#L1501005, 3.3 mg/ml, fill volume 1.2 mL ). 
 
Participants in the placebo arm will be vaccinated with an isotonic solution of cGMP-grade solution of 
sodium acetate/ NeutTM (4% Sodium Bicarbonate A dditive Solution) , the diluent used in the Phase Ib 
dose-escalation clinical trial (COH IRB [ZIP_CODE], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]@www.clinicaltrials.gov .) for Tet-CMV 
without PF-[ADDRESS_652114] (Day 28) vaccine will be replaced 
and removed from the study. All participants who receive the first vaccine will be followed and assessed 
through Day [ADDRESS_652115] of care (SOC) practices through Day [ADDRESS_652116] of weekly or 
biweekly SOC assessments of CMV  qPCR, clinical laboratory tests, engraftment assessment, GVHD 
assessment and physical exam, and, when clinically indicated, CMV disease assessment and disease 
relapse assessment; disease relapse is also routinely assessed at pre -determined time points per SOC. 
The procedures and clinical care provided to participants should not differ from that provided routinely 
to all post-HCT patients with the exception of restrictions on concomitant medications that might 
impact study endpoints such as prophylactic antivir al treatment, and T -cell depleting agents, and the 
administration of other vaccines whose prohibition is lifted after the second vaccination.   
From Day [ADDRESS_652117] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505390] 23 of 91 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/2020            study visits will occur up to and including Day 36 5 to ensure periodic documentation  and/or evaluation  
of clinical endpoints and for the collection of  research blood samples.  
Because data from the phase 1b study in HCT CMV -positive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505426], the study will investigate the impact of CMVPepVax 
on transplant related outcomes such as GVHD, disease relapse, mortality, and infection rate.  
Rigorous stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_505395], and will include three major safety endpoints; non-relapse 
mortality (NRM) at [ADDRESS_652118], severe (grade 3 -4) acute GVHD (aGVHD),  and grade 3-4 AEs 
(CTCAEv4) related to the vaccination within [ADDRESS_652119] 48 patients are evaluable for the frequency of CMV reactivation before day 
100 (included in the primary endpoint). If the observed CMV viremia-rate in the CMVPepVax arm is 
higher than on the placebo arm, the study will be suspended for NCI and DSMC review  [14].   The loss of 
power of invoking a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_505396] 50% of accrual is less than 0.02 [14].  
CMV-specific immunogenicity (included in the secondary endpoints) will be evaluated in all vaccinated 
participants from all arms (N=97) every [ADDRESS_652120] on 
days 140, 180, 270, 365. Immunologic studies will include monitoring levels of CD8+ T cells binding to 
pp65 A2-CMV-dextramers®, combined with immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_50391]  [15, 16].  The phenotypic ratios 
of CMV-specific T cells will be related to improvement in control of CMV viremia. Based on the 
encouraging results of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_505427]  (COH IRB [ZIP_CODE]), levels of pp65 -specific T cells associated with 
protection from CMV viremia and disease are anticipated to be detected in a significantly higher 
proportion of vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505428]  [10]. Additional 
correlative immunogenicity studies (included in the secondary endpoints) will include measuring levels 
of highly cytotoxic memory NKG2C+ NK cells, linked to CMV reactivation, critical for CMV adaptive 
immune response and potentially linked to relapse reduction [17]. In the phase Ib trial of CMVPepVax in 
HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (COH IRB 120 22) CMVPepVax administration was associated with reduced risk of chronic 
GVHD while there was no increase in acute GVHD. To further investigate potential immunologic impacts 
of CMVPepVax on GVHD, various GVHD biomark ers will be evaluated including various cytokines and 
hepatocyte growth factor  for systemic GVHD  [76, 77],  elafin for skin GVHD [78], regenerating islet -
derived 3α (REG3α) for gastrointestinal GVHD  [79], suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) for steroid -
refractoriness 5 [80], and CXCL9 [81, 82]and B cell –activating factor (BAFF) for chronic GVHD  [81, 82]. 
The levels of these GVHD biomarkers will be compared between the vaccine group and placebo group, 
as well as between GVHD+ and – groups.   
 
2.3 Preclinical Studies  
2.3.1 cGMP-grade Tet-CMV ± PF-03512676 adjuvant  
Tet-CMV ± PF-03512676 adjuvant  (CMVPepVax = 2.5 mg Tet-CMV + 1 mg PF-03512676) has been 
extensively tested in Tg mouse models adults [7]. The cGMP-grade CMV vaccine products were evaluated 
in HLA A*0201 HHDII Tg mice, and potency results were confirmed, as illustrated in Figure 2.3.1 [8].

immunized mice.  
2.3.2 Animal Toxicology  
Pre-clinical toxicology studies  in rats revealed little to no toxicity of the cGMP -grade CMV peptides at all 
investigated dosages (from Southern Research Institute , Protocol [ZIP_CODE].11.01).  
2.[ADDRESS_652122] in a clinical study performed in a 
cohort of healthy volunteers  (IRB [ZIP_CODE]), and subsequently in a single center pi[INVESTIGATOR_505429], that was completed  at COH (IRB [ZIP_CODE]) .  
In particular, based on  IRB ([ZIP_CODE]) and FDA (IND, BB-[ZIP_CODE]) approval, cGMP-grade PADRE-CMV and Tet-
CMV, with or without PF-03512676 adjuvant were clinically evaluated for safety and immunogenicity 
(Phase Ib trial) in healthy adults, expressing the HLA A*[ADDRESS_652123] expansi on of CMV-pp65 CD8 T cells. 
These data supported further evaluation of  CMVPepVax in HLA A*[ADDRESS_652124] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840][8]. The 
completed Phase Ib pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (IRB [ZIP_CODE]) is designed to evaluate safety  of administering CMVPepVax to 
HLA A*[ADDRESS_652125] or MUD R+ at risk for CMV complications [13]. The published results have shown 
reliable safety, reduced CMV reactivation and cGVHD in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505430] . 
2.4.1 Phase Ib clinical trial in healthy adults (COH IRB [ZIP_CODE])  
The Phase Ib safety and immunogeni city clinical trial, performed at COH in healthy individuals was a 
non-randomized, open label, dose escalating study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]@www.clinicaltrials.gov )[8]. Healthy 
male and female volunteers, 18 and 55 years old, CMV-seropositive or seronegative, and molecularly 
subtyped as HLA A*0201 -positive were enrolled after signing informed consent. Participants were 
eligible unless they had ≥1 of the following exclusion criteria: abnormal serum chemistry and blood 
count; hepatitis B or C positive; immunodeficiency, including HIV;  taking daily medications for chronic 
illness, surgery within 6 months of vaccination requiring general anesthesia ; known cardiac disease 
including patients being treated for hypertension and high cholestero l; positive urine pregnancy 
test/planning to become pregnant within 6 months from vaccination;  immunization with other vaccines 
within 1 month of the study period; participation in a CMV immunotherapy trial in the previous 6 months;  
history of cancer, depr ession, allergic diatheses, frequent migraines.   

CMVPepVax vs. Placebo for the control of CMV in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505390] 25 of 91 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/2020            The safety (primary endpoint) and immunogenicity (secondary endpoint) evaluation of CMV peptides (Tet -
CMV, and PADRE -CMV) was performed separately in two concomitant stages:  Tet-CMV or PADRE-CMV 
peptide alone and Tet -CMV or PADRE-CMV peptide co-injected with 1 mg PF-03512676 adjuvant  [83].  The 
vaccine dose escalation (0.5, 2.5, 10 mg vaccine) was based on previous peptide vaccine studies [84]. A 
cGMP-grade sodium acetate solution was used as peptide diluent. Tet-CMV peptide formulation was 
comprised of [ADDRESS_652126] pH; Tet-CMV peptide 
with adjuvant was comprised of 1.0 ml of peptide solution and 0.1 ml PF -03512676 (1 mg). The final 1.0 
ml injection volume was administered SC in the upper arm.  To assess safety of multiple injections, 
booster doses of vaccine ± PF-03512676 (1 mg) were given at day 21, 42, 63.  Six volunteers were allotted 
to each dose level and the vaccine was administered by [CONTACT_505512].  
Safety in Healthy Adults: Adverse Events  
The peptide vaccines were safe and tolerated in most subjects, though addition of the PF-03512676 (1 
mg) adjuvant increased reactogenicity (Table 2.4.1a). Most common AEs included mild to moderate 
cutaneous reactions at the injection site and systemic flu -like symptoms. The duration of related Grade 
1 and 2 AEs ranged from 1 -2 days. Grade 3 AEs included  marked malaise, 39.4 –40.5C fever, urticaria 
and were resolved with non -prescription analgesics (acetaminophen and antihistamine respectively), 
within 8 days. Of participants receiving Tet-CMV + PF-03512676 2 (15.3%) subjects experienced Grade 2 
and 1 (7.7%) Grade [ADDRESS_652127] possibly related to CMV peptide (Tet -CMV and PADRE -
CMV) with or without adjuvant in healthy volunteers

In particular, in the cohort immunized with 2.5 mg Tet -CMV +  1 mg PF-03512676 adjuvant (the vaccine 
formulation used in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505431]-named CMVPepVax ) a single Grade 2 AE (38.7 –39.3C fever) 
resolved in 1 day was reported for one vaccinated volunteer (Table 2 .4.1b).

Safety in Healthy Adults: Analysis of Double Stranded DNA Autoantibodies  
Sera from immunized volunteers were longitudinally evaluated during the whole study observation 
period (from day -120 to ~[ADDRESS_652129] immunization), for levels of double stranded (ds) DNA 
autoantibodies. These analyses were performed since mouse models of sys temic autoimmune diseases 
have indicated  involvement of TLRs in the generation of autoreactive immune responses [85]. The semi-
quantitative detection of human dsDNA IgG autoantibodies in serum was performe d using the dsDNA 
ELISA kit system, by [CONTACT_505513] ( Princeton, NJ) at COH General Clinic Research Centre. As 
shown in Figure 2.4.1a (lowest plot), no individuals (N=21) vaccinated with the CMV peptides only 
showed levels of dsDNA autoantibodies ab ove the positivity threshold (>180 AAU/ml). In contrast, 
66.7% (total N=18, not shown) and 36.4% (total N=11, Figure 2.4.1a top plots) of the healthy volunteers 
vaccinated respectively with Tet -CMV + PF-03512676 adjuvant  demonstrated levels of dsDNA 
autoantibodies transiently raised above the positivity threshold following vaccination ; by [CONTACT_4475] 360 these 
levels returned within the normal range. Importantly, none of the immunized volunteers co -injected 
with PF-03512676 CpGDNA had any evidence of developi[INVESTIGATOR_505432]-related pathologies, including UPN 228 (2.5 mg Tet -CMV + PF-03512676) who maintained 
the same levels of dsDNA autoantibodies slightly above positivity threshold, before and after 
vaccination.

Immunogenicity of CMVPepVax in Health y Adults 
The induction of post -vaccination ex vivo immune responses was monitored by [CONTACT_129321], 
using FACSCantoTM with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) [7]. Positive post-vaccination responses, 
defined as a >3 fold increase in either MHC class I  pp65495-503 tetramer binding or IFN -γ expression by 
[CONTACT_398]8+ T cells compared to baseline were exclusively detected in volunteers who received the vaccine co -
administered with PF-03512676 (Figure 2.4.1b)[44]. 
Comparing the longitudinal profiles  of ex vivo pp65495-503 tetramer+ CD8+ T cell levels, a striking difference  
(Figure 2.4.1b; p=0.004, Wilcoxon rank -sum test comparing post -vaccination averages between d14 -77) 
was noted in immunized volunteers whose pre-vaccination pp65495-503 tetramer CD8+ T cell levels were 
minimal-low (<0.2%, referred as CMV+ <0.2%). For these CMV pp65 495-503 -immune-negative volunteers,

In all responders, ex vivo CMV responses were still detectable at day 77  (Figure 2.4.1b, right bottom

Though volunteers vaccinated with CMV peptide alone(without adjuvant) did not show ex vivo post-
vaccination increases in pp65495-503 CD8+ T cells, by [CONTACT_505514] 
T cell responses (>10 fold expansions)  in ~30% (4 of 14)  of CMV+<0.2% and ~40% (3 of 7) of CMV -

seronegatives and in 4 CMV -seropositive volunteers vaccinated with CMV peptide + PF-03512676 who 
failed to demonstrate ex vivo responses. Confirming the ex vivo data, the correlative IVS studies showed 
that usage of PF-03512676 adjuvant induced significantly higher (p=0.002, two -sided Fisher’s exact test) 
post-vaccination responses when comparing responses of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505436] + PF-[ADDRESS_652132] limitations, due to

period for levels of double stranded (ds) DNA autoantibodies. These analyses were performed  since 
mouse models of systemic autoimmune diseases have indicated  involvement of TLRs in the generation 
of autoreactive immune responses [85]. The semi-quantitative detection of human dsDNA IgG 
autoantibodies in seru m was performed using the dsDNA ELISA kit system, by [CONTACT_505513] 
(Princeton, NJ) at COH . Interestingly, none of the 14 R+ patients vaccinated with CMVPepVax showed 
levels of dsDNA autoantibodies above the positivity threshold (>180 AAU/ml).  Furthermore, none of 
them reached the so called equivocal threshold ( >150 AAU/ml, Figure 2.4.2a) being all levels < 150 
AAU/ml.  
These results in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505442], 
This difference is likely due to defects in cellular and humoral immunity which persist for over one yea r 
after HCT, with delayed immune reconstitution especially marked for B cell s[86, 87].

Safety of CMVPepVax in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: Impact on GVHD  
Importantly, there was no  increased incidence of aGVHD, in patients immunized with CMVPepVax. An 
unexpected and striking finding was the difference in rates of cGVHD  in patients who reached day 180 in 
the vaccine arm (3/11) vs. the observational arm (8/13, p=0.0347), as shown in Figure 2.4.2b. 
Noteworthy is that the vaccine formulation is more likely to stimulate TH1 responses, yet TH2 immunity 
is mechanistically associated with cGVHD. Additionally, CpG DNA PF03512676 the adjuvant in 
CMVPepVax is known to leading to potent immunostimulatory effects, such NK cell activation [63] which 
have been described to be inversely correlated to cGVHD onset  [88]. Thus CMVPepVax vaccinated HCT

CMVPepVax in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: Immunogenicity studies  
Vaccine specific immune responses have been evaluated by [CONTACT_505515] -specific CD8+ T cells, using 
multi-color flow cytometric analysis.  Levels of CD8+ T cells (cells/µL) binding to CMV -pp65495-503 HLA 
*0201 pentamers (Proimmune, Oxford. [LOCATION_006]) have been measured for thirty-one participants; fourteen  of 
them were from the CMVPepVax vaccine intervention and seventeen from the observational arm. All 
HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505446] a measurable and consistent increase in 
pp65 levels post-vaccination, as plotted in Figure 2.4.2c (upper plot).  
This pattern is consistent with a vaccine effect, and a formal statistical analysis has been performed.  In 
nine vaccine arm patients and in ten observational patients who reached day [ADDRESS_652148] 
(p=0.02). Thus CMVPepVax significantly expanded CMV-pp65 CD8 T cells which have been described to

reactivation, combined TEM and T EMRA phenotypes constituted a median of 90% of pp [ZIP_CODE]-503-specific 
CD8 T cells in these vaccinated patients. CMV viremia was not detectable in the CMVPepVax patients, 
although their pp [ZIP_CODE]-503-specific CD8 T cell profiles were strikingly similar to those  observed in viremic 
patients, who did not receive the vaccine. Collectively, our analysis indicates that, in the absence of 
clinically relevant viremia, CMVPepVax reconstituted significant levels of differentiated effector memory 
pp65495-503-specific CD8 T cells early post -HCT. The body of data from this current study indicates that the 
rapid reconstitution of CMV -specific T cells, with marked levels of effector phenotypes may have been 
key to the favorable outcomes of the CMVPepVax clinical trial.  ([91], [92]) 
 
 
2.5 Interim analysis and rationale for continuation of the trial  
The interim analysis for the primary endpoint (Section 12.4 Data Analysis Plan) unexpectedly showed

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/2020            Unanticipated features of the interim analysis:  
- The overall CMV reactivation  rate was lower than past  clinical experience at COH, yielding only  8 
events at the interim analysis. If the vaccine was effective, 13 events would be  expected. If it 
were ineffective, 19 events would be expected .  The lower overall event rate increases th e 
chance of inappropriately stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_505450] 2% as originally planned , 
to about 27%, assuming the vaccine still prevents half  of all CMV reactivations.   
 
- A second unanticipated feature was  the early timing of most reactivations:  7 of the 8 events 
occurred before day 100 which is prior to the second vaccination (scheduled for day 56).   
 
Safety and immunologic data at the interim analysis:  
- There have been no safety concerns to date. The immunologic recovery based on the number of 
patients achieving 2 -fold or 4-fold increase in CMV -specific T cells was favorable in the vaccine 
arm (Table 2.5).  
 
Rationale/justification for continued accrual : 
1)  For the entire cohort of [ADDRESS_652158] week 18 despi[INVESTIGATOR_505451] . 
The combined reactivation rate at this point was 8/48, or 17%, very close to the 15% rate that was 
hoped for on the vaccine arm, but much lower than expected for the placebo arm.   At such low 
reactivation rates, th e futility rule has a much higher false alarm rate tha n planned.  If the vaccine offers 
the same degree of protection originally planned , (i.e. preventing 25 of 40 reactivations) then the futility 
rule would have a false alarm rate of approximately 27%.   The interim result is thus not inconsistent with 
the original targeted effect size, and does not provide a satisfactory contradictory signal to the success 
seen in protocol IRB#[ZIP_CODE].  
There will be a useful gain in clinical and scientific knowledge by [CONTACT_505517] [ADDRESS_652159] was futile at the low reactivation rates  for 
the initial cohort .  
In addition, there are further factors that likely contributed to the current results such as more libe ral 
eligibility criteria in [ZIP_CODE] compared with the previous successful pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (IRB#[ZIP_CODE], detailed in 
section 2.4.2 above), and heterogeneity in CMV detection methods and preemptive therapy across 
participating sites, with some events occurring early .  Therefore, to be more consistent with the original 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_505452]#[ZIP_CODE], we will exclude any grade 3-4 aGVHD before randomization (day 28) and any level 
of detectable viremia prior to day 28. In addition, we will remove from efficacy analysis if a pati ent was 
found to be viremic on the day of vaccination (retroactive since the result will be available only after 1 -2 
days from the vaccination).  
2)  For the new cohort of [ADDRESS_652160] of CMVPepVax in patients who experience 
CMV reactivation during or after the administration of Prevymis – an antiviral agent used for CMV 
disease prophylaxis.  Prevymis has been approved by [CONTACT_505509][INVESTIGATOR_841] s, 
and accordingly, the City of Hope HCT SOP has adopted the use of Prevymis.

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/[ADDRESS_652161] of CMVPepVax 
administered during Prevymis prophylaxis. 
There is no known or theoretical overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_505453].   
Clinical and scientific significance  
- Late CMV reactivation after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_505413] 100 remains a major clinical problem, which can 
potentially be overcome by [CONTACT_505518]. 
Novelty 
- The combination of CMVPepVax (developed at COH, IND held by [CONTACT_502256]) and Prevymis is a highly novel 
combination. 
- CMV-specific T cell immune reconstitution has not been described in patients receiving Prevymis. Thus 
the immunologic data of patients receiving Prevymis, even in a small cohort of 18, are highly informative 
and novel. 
- The clinical and immunological imp act of CMVPepVax when combined with Prevymis has not been 
studied. The proposed amendment allows better understanding the vaccine -induced immunologic 
protection for CMV reactivation occurring after day 100.

4.0 PARTICIPANT ENROLLME NT AND RANDOMIZATION  
4.1 Pre-Enrollment Informed Consent and Screening Procedures  
Diagnostic or laboratory studies performed exclusively to determine eligibility will be done only after 
obtaining written informed consent.  Studies or procedures that are performed for clinical indications 
(not exclusively to determine study eligibility) may be used for baseline values and/or to determine pre -
eligibility, even if the studies were done before informed consent was obtained. The informed consent 
process is to be fully documented, and the prospective participant must receive a copy of the signed 
informed consent document.  See Table [ADDRESS_652168] Information  
Eligible subjects will be registered on the study centrally by [CONTACT_36909] (DCC) at City of 
Hope.  DCC staff are available between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00p.m.  PST, Monday through 
Friday (except holidays).    DCC contact [CONTACT_10856]:  
 phone: ([PHONE_594] ext. [ZIP_CODE] 
 e-mail: [EMAIL_1833] 
4.2.2 Slot verification and reservation  
As the study nears completion of accrual, study team personnel (including physicians, protocol nurses 
and/or CRCs) may wish to contact [CONTACT_505521].  Slots may only be held for a limited time which will be determined by 
[CONTACT_36925]. The Data Coordinating Center should be notified of cancellations of prospective participants 
holding slots as soon as possible. 
4.2.3 Registration procedure  
To register a participant, the subsequent procedure is to be followed.  
1. The participating site’s data manager/coordinator/research nurse should contact [CONTACT_505522] t he pending registration  and 
communicate desired timeline of the registration, especially if it must be completed 
promptly to meet the registration window ( [ADDRESS_652169]).  
2. The data manager/coordinator/research nurse should then e-mail copi[INVESTIGATOR_24305] 
[EMAIL_1833]  of the following documents to the DCC:  
CMVPepVax vs. Placebo for the control of CMV in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505390] 42 of 91 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/2020            o Registration Cover Sheet  (Appendix H ) 
o Completed Eligibility Criteria List (printed  from Section 3.1-2 of the 
protocol) 
o Source documentation to support  eligibility criteria**  
o Signed informed consent document  
o Signed HIPAA authorization form (if separate from the informed consent 
document) 
o Signed subject’s Bill of Rights (COH only)  
**For COH participants , provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_505455] a finalized record in the COH EMR  
3. After having received all transferred documentation, the DCC will review the documents 
to verify eligibility, working with the participating site as needed to resolve any missing 
required source elements. A subject failing to meet all protocol eligibility requirements 
will not be registered.  
4. Once eligibility has been confirmed,  DCC staff will register the participant by : [CONTACT_20526] a 
subject accession number, r egister the subject on study centrall y into MIDAS for 
external site participants (the COH CRC will directly accession into MIDAS ), and enter the 
subject into the eCRF system, Medidata RAVE. 
5. Once registration has been completed, DCC staff will send a Confirmation of Registration 
Form, including the participant study number and planned date of HCT procedure to:  
o the site study team:  site PI, treating physician, protocol nurse, CRC and 
pharmacy 
o the sponsor team: (Drs. Nakamura, La Rosa , and the COH CRC ) 
 
4.3 Randomization  
The vaccine treatment assignment will be masked from patients and health care providers, but known 
to the DCC coordinators, study monitors, auditors, pharmacy personnel, and the statistician.   See 
Section 5.2 for additional information about maintaining a blinded ra ndomization. 
The DCC staff will use a computer-generated randomization progr am, stratified by [CONTACT_505523]. The treatment 
assignment will be generated and provided to pharmacists in advance (usually ~day [ADDRESS_652170]) of 
planned vaccination . The DCC staff will confirm that the treatment assignment was received by [CONTACT_38766].  
The DCC specialist will request a copy of source documents regarding donor CMV serostatus , if not 
already provided/available. The DCC staff may contact [CONTACT_505524].  
As soon as the study team is aware that a registered participant will  not meet the criteria  to receive the 
initial vaccine, this should be promptly communicated to the DCC.  This information will be entered into 
the computer-generated randomization program to inform subsequent treatment assignments.  
Only participants who receive a vaccination (CMVPepVax or Placebo) will be considered “randomized”.

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/2020            4.4 Emergency De -Blinding Procedures  
Participant ’s randomization status will be un-blinded in the event a patient on this study develops a life -
threatening toxicity or serious adverse event for which the pa rticipant’s physician or other health care 
professional feels that it is in the patient’s best interest to know the randomization status of the 
participant. 
The following procedure should be followed:  
Information regarding the rationale for de -blinding will be provided to the Site PI, the COH DCC, 
and the Study PI.  
The Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_505456]-
blind patient’s treatment .  
In this very unlikely event, the PMT will determine if and how the de -blinding should impact the 
participant’s continued participation in the study or analysis of collection points post de -blinding. This 
plan will be provided to the IRB of record and the COH IRB and DSMC as per COH institutional 
requirements. The date and reason for de -blinding must be noted in the medical record and captured in 
the eCRF. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_652171] of a vaccine administration of either CMVPepVax  (N=48) or placebo 
(N=48), depending on participant randomization. All patients in the new cohort (36 patients, 18 vs 18) 
will receive Prevymis as a standard of care.  
Participants will receive vaccine administration on days [ADDRESS_652172] if vaccine administration 
criteria are met (Sections 6.1 and 6.2) and confirmed by [CONTACT_15791] (who will notify the study team 
pharmacy of the confirmation) . 
Participants who do not receive the Day [ADDRESS_652173].  
Windows for vaccine administration are detailed in Section 10, Study Activity Calendar . 
All participants in the new cohort (36 patients, 18 vs 18)  will be assigned to Prevymis standard of care 
group and will receive Prevymis at the dose of [ADDRESS_652174]. 
5.2 Maintaining blinded randomization  
The vaccine treatment assignment will be masked from patients and health care providers, but known 
to the DCC coordinator s, study monitors, auditors, pharmacy personnel, and the statistician . Due to 
differences in appearance of the active agent and the placebo, the person administering the vaccine 
(placebo or active agent)  should limit discussions regarding the characteristics regarding the agent’s 
appearance or administration (i.e. ease or difficulty of administration) to the study pharmacist . Since the 
person administering the vaccine may detect a difference in appearance  between placebo or active 
agent, he/she will be furthermore excluded from perform ing any protocol -required procedures or 
providing day-to-day medical care of the participant for the duration of the trial. The pharmacist will 
keep the treatment assignments and accountability documentation such that the documents cannot be

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/[ADDRESS_652175] for Pharmacy. Disclosure of any knowledge of the randomization 
status to persons other than those permitted to know the randomization status would result in a 
protocol violation.  
5.3 Vaccine Administration  and Pre -Vaccination Prophylaxis  
Note: the vaccine must be administered within 90 minut es of start of vaccine preparation . As such, 
coordination between the pharmacy and the staff administering the vaccine is essential.   
5.3.1 Pre-vaccination preemptive therapy  
At the discretion of the treating investigator and/or participant, within 15 minutes prior to vaccine 
administration a single dose of oral acetaminophen (Tylenol) at a recommended dose of [ADDRESS_652176] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505457] .  
Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) [ADDRESS_652177] ration, the 
participant will be monitored for 30 minutes for apparent vital sign changes, and local and systemic 
reactogenicity.  
The time when the  agent was administered (as noted on the vaccine label or accompanying pharmacy 
documents) and the time of va ccination will be noted in the medical record.  
5.[ADDRESS_652178] are extensively monitored for safety according to institutional SOC practices. 
The following assessments will occur for safety and/or endpoint analysis with the schedule ind icated in 
Study Activity Calendar (Section 10), per institutional SOC, and as clinically indicated.  
5.4.1 GVHD assessment  and performance status  
Acute GVHD will be assessed and graded according to the Keystone Consensus grading system  
(Appendix B). Chronic GVHD will be classified per Appendix C by [CONTACT_505525] (progressive, interrupted, 
de novo, or chronic); basis of diagnosis (histologic/biopsy proven, clinical evidence, both, or unknown); 
Limited or Extensive chronic GVHD; and overall severity of GVHD (mild, moderate, or severe) . 
Performance status will be evaluated utilizing the Karnofsky Performance Scale  (Appendix D).

gc/ml, reported in WHO IU/ml (conversion factor 2.5; 250gc/ml=625IU/ml, note all PCR values in this 
protocol are expressed by [CONTACT_505527]/ml based on the COH assay).  
Clinical CMV disease status will be documented at each study visit, which may include the  absence or 
presence of suspected CMV disease.  When clinically indicated and per SOC, CMV disease will be 
assessed and, when present, the site (upper GI, lower GI, other, specify) and met hod of detection in the 
tissue (tissue culture, pathology etc.) will be documented.  Presentations or suspected presentations of 
CMV disease in the absence of qPCR ≥500 gc/ml will be evaluated by [CONTACT_505528] a determination is made.  
5.4.3 Engraftment assessment  
Engraftment will be assessed by [CONTACT_505529][INVESTIGATOR_841]’s absolute neutrophil count . The date of 
engraftment is defined as the first of 3 consecutive days when the peripheral blood absolute neutroph il 
count is ≥ 500/mm3; for the purposes of recording into the case report form, the date of engraftment 
can be derived from the ANC values in the clinical laboratory results  so long as there is accompanying 
documentation in the medical record that engraftm ent did occur.  
Graft failure following engraftment (secondary graft failure) is defined as a fall in the absolute neutrophil 
count below 500/ mm3 for greater than 3 consecutive days following initial engraftment that is not due 
to disease relapse/progressi on, infection or secondary medication effect; the date of graft failure will be 
defined as the date when the criteria for graft failure are confirmed  by [CONTACT_15370]-investigator. 
5.4.4 Disease relapse 
Disease relapse will be assessed (including timing of assessment) according to institutional SOC practice 
for the participant’s specific hematologic malignancy.  At defined clinic visits, the disease relapse status 
should be documented, which may include the presence or absence of clinical  signs of disease relapse.  
Relapse is defined as “morphologic relapse” for acute/chronic leukemia including AML, ALL, MDS, CML. 
Patients who are found to be in relapse only by [CONTACT_505530], except for cases which received conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. The 
following FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors/hypomethylating agents are allowed in case of 
molecular/cytogenetic relapse: imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, ponatinib, sorafenib, azacitidine and 
decitabine. 
 
5.4.[ADDRESS_652181]  
A complete metabolic panel will include the following 18 blood chemistry parameters (CMP): glucose, 
BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatinine, uric acid, total proteins, albumin, calcium, phosphorous, so dium, 
potassium, chlorine, total CO 2, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT (alanine transaminase), AST 
(aspartate aminotransferase), LDH  (lactate dehydrogenase) , total cholesterol.  
For women of child bearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test  is acceptable.   
The hematology testing will include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential.  
5.4.6 Adverse event assessment (CTCAE)  
All adverse events will be assessed using NCI CTCAE v. 4.0, which can be found at the following link: 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010 -06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf8.1 . Adverse 
events recorded in the case report forms include:

documentation guidelines. Additional documentation will be made, where necessary, to support the 
concomitant medication data collected in the study case report forms:  
o Anti-viral medications, including indication, start and stop date  
o Immunosuppressive agents  
o Prednisone dosage for the 7 days prior to vaccine administration  
o Prohibited medications  
5.4.9 Immunogenicity testing  
All participants will undergo serial blood sampling fo r future immunogenicity testing . Section 9.0 details 
regarding sample collection, storage, and processing procedures for immunogenicity studies.  
5.5 Criteria for Completing /Discontinuing  Study Participation  
Participation may continue until one of the following criteria applies:  
o Participant does not meet criteria for Day 28 vaccine  (such participant  are not 
randomized and will be replaced) 
o Completion of study procedures  
o Participant withdraw s from the study 
o General or specific changes in the participant 's condition that render the participant  
unacceptable for participation in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_80021].  
Documentation of the reason for completing study participation  and the date effective should be made 
in the medical record and appropriate eCRF.  The COH DCC should be promptly notified of the change in 
participant status.  
5.6 Follow -Up and Duration of Participation  
The length and involvement of study participation will vary based on vaccine administration, disease 
relapse, or decisio n to withdraw from the study, as detailed in the subsections that follow:  
5.6.[ADDRESS_652184] procedures performed and 
documented up to that time of determination of relapse, and then will be followed for survival only

Participants who withdraw from the study after receiving a vaccine administration may continue with 
follow-up per the participant’s agreement: 
– may elect to continue study monitoring procedures without Day 56 vaccine (if not already 
administered). 
 
– may elect to continue to be monitored for survival (including reason for mortality) until Day 365 only, 
or  
– may elect to withdraw completely; further follow-up or assessments will not occur.  
 
5.6.5 All other participant s (vaccine administered, have not relapsed or withdrawn)  
All participants who received at least one vaccine, have yet to have disease relapse, and have not 
withdrawn from the study, will continue follow up assessments and research blood draws as indicated  in 
the Study Activity C alendar (Section 10) through day [ADDRESS_652186].   
 
5.7 Supportive Care, Other Concomitant Therapy, Prohibited Medications  
Optional preemptive treatment prior to vaccine administration is detailed in Section 5.3.  
In general, the use of any concomitant medication/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_505458]/appropriate for the care of the participant are all owed, with the following exceptions:  
o No other investigational agents may be given to patients  
o Alemtuzumab or any equivalent in vivo T -cell depleting agent  is not permitted in this study  
following HCT, because its administration results in in vivo depletion of B, T and dendritic 
cells, potentially negating any positive e ffect of vaccinating the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505459] . 
o Prophylactic therapy with CMV immunoglobulin or prophylactic antiviral CMV treatment 
(GCV/VAL, FOS, Cidofovir, CMX -001) is not allowed  following HCT with the exception of 
Prevymis administration in Prevymi s cohort. GCV/VAL, FOS, Cidofovir, CMX-001 may be used 
according to institutional  SOC for preemptive management of CMV viraemia. In general, 
preemptive therapy should not commence until after CMV qPCR ≥500 gc/ml; for preemptive 
therapy for qPCR< 500, the study PIs are to be consulted.  
o Prophylatic antiviral treatment for HSV, HHV6, EBV and adenovirus including the use of 
GCV/VAL, FOS, Cidofovir, CMX -[ADDRESS_652187] are 
prohibited up to 14 days after the second vaccination (day [ADDRESS_652188]). Medications in this 
category include, but are not limited to:  
 Live attenuated vaccines  
 Medically indicated subunit (Engerix -B for HBV; Gardasil for HPV) or killed vac cines 
(e.g. influenza, pneumococcal, or allergy treatment with antigen injections)  
o Steroid therapy with prednisone, or equivalent, is permitted (see section 6.0 for specific 
steroid dose criteria for vaccinations) .

7.3 Definitions  
7.3.1 Adverse event (AE)  
An adverse event is any untow ard medical experience or change of an existing condition that occurs 
during or after treatment, whether or not it is considered to be related to the protocol intervention.  
7.3.2 Unexpected Adverse Event [21 CFR 312.32 (a) ] 
An adverse event is unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator’s brochure and/or package insert; is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the protocol and/or consent; is not an expected natural progre ssion of any underlying 
disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of the research participant experiencing the 
adverse event. 
7.3.3 Expected Adverse Event  
Any event that does not meet the criteria for an unexpected event OR is an expected natural  
progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of the research 
participant experiencing the adverse event  
7.3.4 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) [Modified from 21 CFR 312.32]  
A serious adverse event is defined as any expected or unexpected adverse event  that results in any of 
the following outcomes:  
 Death

IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/2020             Life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred)  
 Unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (equal or greater than 24 hours)  or prolongation of 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity   
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Secondary Malignancy  
 Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject’s healt h and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above (examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasisas or  convulsions that do n ot result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
7.3.5 Unanticipated problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
An unanticipated problem is any  incident, experience or outcome that meets all three  of the following 
criteria: 
1. Unexpected (in term s of nature, severity, or frequency) given the following: a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol -related documents such as the IRB approved research 
protocol, informed consent document or Investigator Brochure (IB); and b) the characteristics of 
the subject population being studied; AND 
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcomes may have been caused by [CONTACT_177435], devices or proced ures involved in the research); AND 
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than previously known or recognized.  
7.3.[ADDRESS_652199] recent version of  Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized to characterize AEs, a copy of which can be found

in the CTCAE Version 4.  
7.3.7 AE Attribution 
The relationship of e vent to study drug will be documented by [CONTACT_73951]:  
 Unrelated: The event is clearly related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, other 
therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs administered to the participant.  
 Unlikely: The event is doubtfully related to investigational agent(s). The event was most likely 
related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions, or 
concomitant drugs.  
 Possible: The event follows a reasona ble temporal sequence from the time of drug administration, 
but could have been produced by [CONTACT_248290]’s clinical state, other 
therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs.  
 Probable: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequ ence from the time of drug administration, 
and follows a known response pattern to the study drug. The event cannot be reasonably explained

[COMPANY_007] PF-03512676 (previously referred as CPG 7909 and CPG ODN 2006 [66]) adjuvant is a pure 
substance named Agatolimod Sodium,  and is classified as an investigational agent .  PF-03512676 is an 
immunostimulatory single -stranded, phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide containing four 
unmethylated deoxycytosine-deoxyguanine dinucleotide (CpG) motifs  and synthesized with a nuclease -
resistant phosphorothioate backbone. PF-03512676 is 24 nucleotides in length. Its structural formula is:  
(3'-5')d(P-thio)(T-C-G-T-C-G-T-T-T-T-G-T-C-G-T-T-T-T-G-T-C-G-T-T) tricosasodium salt. Its molecular

Use of PF-03512676 as a vaccine adjuvant at doses of 1.08 mg SC/injection results in an AE profile 
consisting of frequently reported mild to moderate injection site reactions and flu -like symptoms.  
At dosing significantly higher than the dose/injection proposed in this trial, e.g., in monkeys the no -
effect dose level for complement activation is 2 -5 mg/kg. The toxicity of PF-03512676 includes effects of 
immune stimulation (liver and spleen enlargement and inflammatory infiltrates in rodents), activation of 
the alternative complement pathway and inhibition of the in trinsic coagulation pathway (shock -like 
syndrome in monkeys following rapid infusion), and dose -related histopathologic changes in liver and 
kidney during subacute and chronic administration.  PF-03512676 had been determined to be

9.0 CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES  
9.1 Immunogenicity testing  
The correlative immunogenicity studies will include monitoring levels and quality of CMV -specific CD8+ T 
cells and highly cytotoxic memory NKG2C+ NK cells, by [CONTACT_7163]-color flow cytometric analyses . 
9.1.1 Specimen Collection and Transport to Processing Laboratory  
All participants will undergo serial blood sampling for immunogenicity testing  at the schedule indicated 
in the Study Activity Calendar (Section 10), which, in general , includes days 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 100, 140, 
180, [ADDRESS_652219].  
 Approximately 30 ml of blood in heparin (green -top) tubes, gently inverted several times to mix anti -
coagulant,  will be kept at room temperature and  transported to authorized personnel of the 
Department of Experimental Therapeutics (DET)  at COH or an assigned Laboratory at external trial sites .  
Where sample processing at an external site is not possible, whole blood will be shipped at room 
temperature to COH for processing. Patient name, MRN and date of birth should be defaced on the 
blood tube label. UPN  and visit date only for the sample should be recorded on a sheet of paper sent 
with the blood draw.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_652220] density gradient centrifugation methods *, washed, re-
suspended in fetal calf se rum (FCS) with 10% DMSO, aliquo ted, and cryopreserved in a centrally 
monitored liquid nitrogen tanks at the COH DET and or external trial sites . Samples will be processed 
and stored according to institutional SOP; it is recommended to freeze 5 million cells per aliquot.   
Samples will be labeled with the study timepoint (e.g. Day 42), date of collection, and study protocol 
number (COH [ZIP_CODE]) and participant study number (e.g. UMN -006). 
*During the processing of the PBMCs, [ADDRESS_652221] ored at -70C.  
When requested by [CONTACT_505544], s amples will be batch shipped to COH 
overnight on dry ice.   
9.1.3 Analytical Method  
CMV-specific CD8+ T cells   
Immunogenicity studies of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells will be performed at the COH DET and will include 
immune-monitoring  of levels of CD8+ T cells binding to A2-CMV-dextramers® (Immudex, Copenhagen, 
Denmark) and PD-1 expression on pp65-specific T cells, poly functionality and phenotype assessment of 
CMV-specific T cells[8, 10, 67]. Additionally, CMV -specific T cell growth kinetics and early cell death we 
be monitored. The proposed Phase II blinded placebo controlled study will definitively assess the level of 
association between reduced CMV reactivation and CMV pp65 specific T cells.  
CMVPepVax vs. Placebo for the control of CMV in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505390] 61 of 91 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/2020            Multicolor FACS analyses will be used to assess po ly functionality and phenotype of CMV-specific T 
cells[8, 10, 67]. All immune-monitoring studies will be performed by [CONTACT_505545] ( Beckman Coulter Inc, Brea  CA). 
All immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_505466].  PBMC will be stained with each fluorochrome -conjugated antibody combination using standard 
methods with commercially fluoresceinated antibodies (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), as described in 
our published studies  [93, 94].  Briefly, PBMC will be stained with either CMV pp65 495-503 or HIVgag77-85 
(as control) APC-conjugated dextramers® and antibodies against CD3, CD8 and  PD-1 labeled with APC -
Cy7, FITC and PE, respectively (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). PBMC will be analyzed for levels of CD8+ T 
cells binding to the dextramers and PD-1 expression by [CONTACT_7811]. In combination with CBC, we will be able 
to calculate the absolute number of pp65495-503–specific CD8+ T cells/L.   
Assessment of CMV-specific T cell growth kinetics will be performed using the carboxyfluorescein 
diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dilutio n method for cell division tracking as previously detailed  [95]. 
Briefly, proliferation will be analyzed using the CFSE dilution method, according to the manufacturer’s 
procedure (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA). To assess CD8 T cell proliferation, PBMC will CFSE labeled 
and incubated for 6 days with 1 µg/ml pp65495-503 peptide or DMSO  diluent as control, in the presence of 
anti-CD49b and CD28 (1 µg/ml). Cells will be then washed and co -stained with anti -CD8 (all antibodies 
from BD Biosciences) and FACS analyzed for CFSE fluorescence levels.  Early cell death will be determined 
using the BD ApoAlert annexin V -FITC Apoptosis Kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions, and cells will be analyzed by  [CONTACT_7811] [89]. 
Natural Killer cell phenotype and function  
Assessment of NK phenotype and function (cytotoxicity and cytokine production) will be performed at 
UMN TLL. These studies will de termine whether vaccination of  HLA A*[ADDRESS_652222]-R+ induces 
adaptive NK cell population changes, and increase in the highly cytotoxic memory NKG2C+ NK cells, 
linked to CMV reactivation, critical for CMV adaptive immune response and potentially linked to relapse 
reduction[17-20]. Since in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_505427], CMVPepVax appeared to reduce reactivation, cGVHD and 
relapse we will assess whether vaccinated patients have increased levels of this potent subset of NK 
cells[18-20]. The NK analyses will be performed at a single cell level by [CONTACT_2329] a 9 -color flow 
approach[18]. COH will provide aliquots of patient PBMC for this analysis.  
 GVHD Biomarkers  
In the phase Ib trial of CMVPepVax in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (COH IRB [ZIP_CODE]) CMVPepVax administration was 
associated with reduced risk of chronic GVHD while there was n o increase in acute GVHD. To further 
investigate potential immunologic impacts of CMVPepVax on GVHD, the following GVHD biomarkers will 
be evaluated in Fox South, 1002.  
o interleukin-2 receptor α (IL2Ra), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), hepatocyte 
growth factor (HGF), interleukin 6 (IL6) and interl eukin-8 (IL8) for systemic GVHD [76, 77] 
o elafin for skin GVHD [78] 
o regenerating islet -derived 3α (R EG3α) for gastrointestinal GVHD [79] 
o suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) for steroid -refractoriness [80] 
o CXCL9 and B cell –activating factor (BAFF) for chronic GVHD [81, 82] 
The levels of these GVHD biomarkers will be compared between the vaccine group and placebo group, 
as well as between GVHD+ and – groups.

12.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 Study Design  
This is a randomized, blinded and placebo controlled Phase II trial conducted at multiple centers, with 
data coordination at COH.  After the trial met its fu tility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_107160], the trial has been amended 
to include a cohort of patients on Prevymis prophylaxis.  This constitutes a major change of the clinical 
setting, with Prevymis prophylaxis required for eligibility.  Because 7 of the 8 primary outcome  events in 
the initial trial occurred prior to the second CMVPepVax injection, the change in eligibility is thought to 
be directly relevant to the reason for the futility outcome.    The primary aims are given in the previous 
section 1, and include evaluat ion of cellular immunity both in general, via stratified analysis, and in the 
Prevymis cohort as a subgroup.  Evaluation of CMV events will expose the therapeutic concept to a 
futility assessment, a strategy that often motivates expansion cohorts in early -phase trials.  The study 
includes rules for periodic safety monitoring, but futility assessment now applies to the full CMVPepVax 
arm of the Prevymis cohort. and an interim analysis for futility.  
Update at the time of amendment  
Enrollment was stopped when 48 subjects had been followed for 100 days, because  8 of the subjects 
with reactivation events by d100, more than half (5 of the 8) were on the vaccine arm, these events 
triggered the futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877].   The combined reactivation rate at this point was 8/48, or 17%, very 
close to the 15% rate that was expected for the vaccine arm, but much lower than expected for the 
placebo arm.  At such low reactivation rates, the futility ru le has a much higher false alarm rate that 
planned.  If the vaccine offers the same degree of protection originally planned for (i.e. preventing 25 of 
40 reactivations) the futility rule would have a false alarm rate of approximately 27%.   The interim result 
is thus not inconsistent with the original targeted effect size, and does not provide a satisfactory 
CMVPepVax vs. Placebo for the control of CMV in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505390] 66 of 91 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/[ADDRESS_652237]-R+ will be consented and enrolled 
pre-HCT, and registered through COH DCC.  A computer-generated randomization progr am, stratified by 
[CONTACT_505547]; the 
treatment assignment will be generated and provided to site pharmacists, who are unmasked to 
treatment-group allocation,  in advance of planned vaccination. Registered participants will be followed 
for the course of transplant and be assess ed for the eligibility for ‘Day [ADDRESS_652238]’ vaccination.  
Participants who meet the initial vaccine administration criteria  will receive an injection; participants 
failing to meet the criteria  will discontinue study participation and be replaced.  Only participants who 
receive an injection will be considered “rand omized”. Information regarding registered participants who 
do not receive vaccine will be entered into the computer -generated randomization program to inform 
subsequent treatment assignments.  Participants who do not meet the criteria to receive the first 
vaccine (CMVPepVax or placebo)  will leave the study, without further treatment or follow -up, but their 
data collected up to study departure will be included in the trial dataset as non -randomized subjects, 
and these data will be incorporated into estimates of event rates post -HCT based on the intention to 
treat.   
12.[ADDRESS_652239]-R+, in a 1:1 ratio, to either the CMVPepVax vaccine 
arm (N=48 or 49), or to the placebo arm (N= 49 or 48).  The amended trial will use the same 
randomization procedures to assign the final 36 subjects, 18 to each arm.  Each patient in the new 
cohort (36 patients, 18 vs 18) will receive Prevymis as standard of care. The uncertainty in the per -arm 
totals is due to continued masking at the time of amendment.   With the expected dropout rate of 10-
15% prior to randomization, the total accrual is expected to be [ADDRESS_652240] performed on -average ~[ADDRESS_652241] procedures annually. We anticipate about 70 to be eligible annually being HLA A*0201 
and CMV seropositive. Accrual should be completed in <4 years from the start date of the trial, and we 
anticipate 1 year of follow up and d ata analysis.  
Planning for measures of immune function is based on results of COH protocol [ZIP_CODE], the open -label 
analog of this placebo -controlled protocol.  In that trial, 10 of 18 vaccinated subjects developed CMV 
pp65-specific CD8+ T-cells that were st rongly concentrated (> 80%) in effector memory phenotypes, and 
did so without CMV reactivation.  This can be compared to 1 of 14 non -vaccinated subjects who did not 
reactivate.  In the current study, the planned sample size of 48 subjects per arm would pro vide 
approximately 80% power for a one -sided 0.05-level test assuming a 50% rate of this event from a 25% 
rate on the placebo arm.  Beyond this measure of vaccine -induced immune function, the data will be 
used to describe the longitudinal changes in immune  function with and without vaccine, in subjects who  
CMVPepVax vs. Placebo for the control of CMV in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505390] 67 of 91 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/[ADDRESS_652242] a reduction in CMV reactivation from 40% to 15% at [ADDRESS_652243], providing 
90% power at one -sided 10% significance level (these are the typi[INVESTIGATOR_505467]  [21]).  The aim of this hypothesis test has been abandoned after the interim 
analysis and substituted with a preliminary analysis of patients receiving Prevymis prophylaxis.  For the 
Prevymis cohort the 36 patients will be randomized 1:1 (18/18) to receive CMVPepVax or Placebo. 
Based on a Phase III trial of Prevymis, we expect 17 percent of placebo subjects to reactivate after 
second vaccination on week 8. This is based on the expectation that 33 percent will be high -risk 
subjects. Assuming that CMVPepVax vaccination during prophylaxis can reduce the week 8 through 
week 26 reactivation rate to 5 percent, the pro bability that there are more reactivations on the placebo 
arm than on the CMVPepVax arm is approximately 88 percent, which can be regarded as the power for a 
non-futile finding.   If CMVPepVax offers no protection, there would be a 50 percent chance of a f utility 
finding, and T-cell data would likely indicate many subjects with poor CMVPepVax antigen recognition. If 
CMVPepvax has strong protection (5% reactivation), a finding of futility is unlikely (12 percent)  and an 
evident biological effect would be expected in most patients.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_652244] will be followed according to the study calendar (section 11 ) for the 
occurrence of CMV reactivation events, which are defined in section [ADDRESS_652245] will, in all other 
respects, continue on the study with all planned treatments and data collections.  The primary analysis 
will focus on arm -specific counts of subjects with events in the defined period, with binomial confidence 
intervals, and comparison by [CONTACT_3493]’s exact test.  In addition, vaccine and placebo groups will be 
compared with regard to (a) the hazard of  CMV events, using time to event models ; and (b) the total 
days of CMV-directed antiviral therapy per individual , using the Mann -Whitney statistic .   
CMVPepVax vs. Placebo for the control of CMV in HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505390] 68 of 91 
IRB Protocol No. [ZIP_CODE]      Version:  28      Dated: 02/19/[ADDRESS_652246] 48 randomized subjects were evaluable for 
the primary endpoint (i.e. had a CMV event or reached 100 days without a CMV event).  Among the 36 
subjects planned for the Prevymis cohort, the inciden ce of more CMV events on the CMVPepVax arm 
than the placebo arm would constitute a futility signal, so there will be no separate interim analysis for 
futility. 
12.5 Safety Monitoring  
Clinical data will be monitored as they accumulate , and investigation of CMVPepVax will be suspended 
for safety review  if there is evidence of serious treatment -related AEs.  
Monitoring of the Prevymis cohort will be done conservatively as both a continuation of the original 
monitoring plan, and as a restart of that same monitoring plan applied to the new patients receiving 
CMVPepVax in combination with Prevymis.  
 
Specifically: 
(1) 100 days non-relapse mortality (NRM) will be monitored as the 12th, 24th and 36th subject on the 
vaccine arm reaches the 100 day evaluation point.  Operationally, the CRA will notify the 
monitoring statistician as cohorts of 24 patients (12 vaccinated) near the 100 day mark. If NRM 
frequencies exceed 4, 6, or 8, at the designated 100 day evaluation point, then the trial will be 
suspended for safety re view by [CONTACT_505548]. These numbers were selected 
to limit the overall false -alarm probability for this endpoint to less than 0.02 when there is no 
additional risk due to immunization  and were based on a benchmark risk of 10% . 
(2) Severe acute GVHD (aGVHD, grade 3 -4) will be monitored as every 12th subject on the vaccine 
arm reaches the [ADDRESS_652247] 12 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], or 9 of 24, or 11 of 36, experience Grade 3 -4 aGVHD.  This would be a significant 
elevation from the COH/UMN historical benchmark of  15% of allogeneic HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_505468] [23].  These rules are determined to limit the overall a GVHD false alarm 
probability to 0.02 if vaccination does not increase risk [23].  
(3) Any serious AEs (SAE, grade 3 -4) related to the vaccination within [ADDRESS_652248] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]

associated informed consent documents by [CONTACT_505553] a current US Federalwide 
Assurance issued by [CONTACT_505554] (OHRP). A ny 
documents that the IRB  may need to fulfill its responsibilities (such  as protocol, protocol amendments, 
Investigator’s Brochure, consent forms, information concerning patient recruitment, payment or 
compensation procedures, or other pertinent information) will be submit ted to the IRB.  The IRB’ s 
written unconditional approv al of the study protocol and the informed consent document will be in the 
possession of the Investigator, and , for sites external to COH, the possession of the coordinating center, 
before the study is initiated.  The Investigator will obtain assurance of IR B/IEC compliance with 
regulations. 
The IRB will be informed of revisions to other documents originally submitted for review; serious 
unexpected or unanticipated adverse experiences occurring during the study , and any additional 
adverse experiences  in accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB; new 
information that may affect adversely the safety of the patients of the conduct of the study; an annual 
update and/or request for re -approval; and when the study has been co mpleted. 
Any amendment to the protocol document and accompanying informed consent document/template, 
as developed and provided by [CONTACT_1016],  will require review and approval by [CONTACT_505555].  The protocol and c onsent will reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_505556] a participating site IRB.  
16.4 Informed Consent  
For a multi-site study, each participating institution will be provided with a model informed consent 
form. Each institution may revise or add  information to comply with local and/or institutional 
requirements, but may not remove procedural or risk content from the model consent form.  
Furthermore, prior to submission to the IRB  (initial submission and amendments) , the consent and 
accompanying HIP AA form, if separate to the consent, must be reviewed an d approved by [CONTACT_245745].  
After the study has been fully explained, written informed consent will be obtained from either the 
patient or his/her guardian or legal representative befo re study participation.  The method of obtaining 
and documenting the informed consent and the contents of the consent must comply with the ICH -GCP 
and all applicable regulatory requirements . 
Before implementing any study procedure, informed consent shall b e documented by [CONTACT_2224] a 
written consent form approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC and signed and dated by [CONTACT_12718]’s 
legally authorized representative at the time of consent.  A copy of the signed informed consent will be 
given to the patient or patient’s legally authorized representative.  The original signed consent must be 
maintained by [CONTACT_505557], or 
regulatory authority at any time.  
Informed consent is a process that i s initiated prior to the individual agreeing to participate in the study 
and continues throughout study participation.

individuals exposed to potentially toxic or ineffective treatments on the one hand and the need to 
explore gender, racial, and ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other.  If differences in outcome 
that correlate to gender, r acial, or ethnic identity are noted, accrual may be expanded or additional 
studies may be performed to investigate those differences more fully.  
Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant are excluded from participation because PF-
03512676, the adju vant used in CMVPepVax , has been determined to be embryolethal and teratogenic 
in animal testing , and as such, CMVPepVax has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.  
Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to 
treatment of the mother with the administered vaccine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if t he 
mother is enrolled on this study.   
16.5.2 Exclusion of Pediatric Patients  
Pediatric recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] ( children <18 years old of age) are excluded from this study because insufficient data 
are available in adults to judge potential risks in children.  Additionally, vaccine dosage and the blood 
volume established for immune -monitoring in adults cannot be applicable for both adults and children. 
Finally, the risk of CMV complications is inversely related to age, and the inclusion of younger children 
could bias the endp oint observations.

Brief Summary of Research (250 -400 words):  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefits and the ideal timing of treating a surgical scar 
of the skin with an ablative fractionated CO2 laser.  An attempt to quanti fy the amount of collagen 
that gets deposited during the healing process after being treated with the fractionated CO2 laser 
as compared to an untreated area of the scar will be performed through a spi[INVESTIGATOR_145245].  Subjects 
will be placed in one of three  categories, based on the timing of when their scar will receive 
intervention  after the excisional surgery.  The clinical appearance of the scar will then be 
documented over several office visits and at week 16 of the scar having been treated with the CO2 
laser, a biopsy will be taken of the treated half of the scar and also one from the untreated half.  
These samples will be evaluated by [CONTACT_145254] H+E staining to quantify the amount 
of collagen deposition as well as the architectural changes in both the treated and untreated areas 
of the surgical scar.  
 
1) Objectives : 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential benefits of treating a surgical scar 
post excision with an ablative fractionated CO2 laser with the goal of decreasing the 
appearance and size of the scar.  The hypothesis of the study is that the portion of the scar 
treated with laser will have an improved appearance and texture.  An attempt will be made 
to quantify the difference in collagen deposition and architecture with the  theory being that 
the treated portion of the scar will have an architectural change similar to normal “scar -
less” tissue. A secondary objective of the study is to try and determine the ideal time to 
treat the surgical scar post -excision.

Revised 7/20/12  2) Background  
Improvement of scar appearance after surgery has been a concept that has been looked at for 
many years.  Katz et al. showed in the early 90’s through a split scar study that mechanica Fel 
dermabrasion improved the clinical appearance of excision scars of the skin w hen performed [ADDRESS_166163] indicated that a noticeable clinical  improvement can be achieved when 
treating these types of scars with a fractionated CO2 laser.  Fractional photothermolysis 
produces a unique thermal damage pattern known as microthermal treatment zones.  These 
zones can be characterized as multiple column s of thermal damage surrounded by [CONTACT_145255].  It is this intervention  pattern that has revolutionized the arena of ablative 
laser therapy and enabled laser platforms such as the erbium:YAG (2,940 nm) and the carbon 
dioxide (10,600) lasers t o provide effective results with significantly less side effects and 
much shorter recovery time.  A study published in the Feb. 2010 Archives of Dermatology by 
[CONTACT_142586]. looked at treating atrophic surgical and traumatic scars with ablative fractional 
resurfacing and found it to be a safe and effective intervention for improving the clinical 
appearance of scars.  It is felt that the zones of ablation and coagulation that are created 
produce dermal remodeling, tissue tightening, new collagen formation and  thus lead to a 
clinical improvement in atrophic scars.  While the study by [CONTACT_142586]. attempted to quantify 
the subjective improvement of the treated scars with objective topographical skin imaging, 
there has not been an established methodology for quan titatively assessing dermal collagen 
architecture.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_145246]. in the Feb. 2011 article in The 
American Journal of Pathology titled  “A Quantitative Approach to Scar Analysis”  
 
3) Setting of the Human Research  
Subjects will attend their study visits in the outpatient offices at the 85th street FPA clinic, 5th 
floor, Department of Dermatology  
 
4) Resources Available to Conduct the Human Research  
Meeting the recruitment  goals of this project will be feasible as the surgical division of Mount 
Sinai’s Dermatology Department performs over 500 surge ries in a six month time period and 
the study is looking to recruit 45 patients, thus the study needs to recruit less then 10% of the 
patients having surgery.            
At this time there will be 2 staff members involved in this research and each member h as 
already participated in IRB approved protocols at Mount Sinai and currently work at the only

f) Procedures Involved in the Huma n Research  
All patients participating in this investigator initiated  split-scar study will receive ablative 
fractional resurfacing with the Deep and Active FXTM platforms of the Lumenis Ultrapulse 
CO2 laser.  The settings for interventions of scars on the face with the Deep platform will 
be 15% coverage, 15mJ at 150 Hz and 15% coverage, 12.[ADDRESS_166167] of reviewing inclusion/exclusion criteria and obtai ning 
informed consent.  There will be a total of [ADDRESS_166168] -op visit that 
correlates approximately with 8 weeks a fter having been treated with the laser (weeks [ADDRESS_166169] groups and week 17 for the final study group).  These biopsy samples 
will be taken for the purpose of analyzing the ultrastructure of the collagen architecture.  
To evaluate this ultra structure, confocal microscopy using fractional dimension and 
lacunarity analysis will be used.  Further scar analysis will be performed by H&E staining 
photographs captured on an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus America Inc. Center 
Valley, PA) equipped wi th MicroFire 2.2 digital camera (Optronics, Goleta, CA) using 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_145248] 2.0 software at 40X magnification.  Image analysis will then be performed 
using NIH’s shareware program, ImageJ and the Scar index will be determined.   Subjects 
will have the option  of having the untreated portion of their scar treated at no charge at 
the end of the study if the subject is satisfied with the results of the study

h) Data Management and Confidentiality  
All records identifying the subject will be kept  confidential and, to the extent permitted by 
[CONTACT_29695]/or regulations, will not be made publicly available. Only the 
subject number will be recorded in the CRF, and if the subject name [CONTACT_145258], it must be obliterated be fore a copy of the document is supplied to the sponsor. 
Study findings stored on a password protected computer will be encrypted and stored in 
accordance with local data protection laws.  As part of the informed consent process, the 
subjects will be inform ed in writing that representatives of the IRB, or regulatory 
authorities may inspect their medical records to verify the information collected, and that 
all personal information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest 
confidence and in a ccordance with local data protection laws.  If the results of the study 
are published, the subject’s identity will remain confidential.  Only the investigator will 
maintain a list to enable subjects to be identified.   The biopsy specimens will be sent 
directly to the dermatopathology lab as per standard operating procedure of the 
department.   The specimens will be analyzed then destroyed immediately as per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_145249] .  Photogra phs will be taken of the scar.   If the 
scar is present on the face, we will focus the pi[INVESTIGATOR_145250]  a manner that the subject’s  facial 
features are not identifiable to maintain their  privacy. These photographs will be labeled

which time they will be transferred onto a disc or USB drive and stored with th e rest of the 
study documents. We will use the study photograp hs to study the effects of the laser on 
scars.  The photographs will be used for documentation of the study and for the purpose of 
being viewed by [CONTACT_145256].  The camera 
will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in the  PI’s office which has a [ADDRESS_166170] protected desktop computer located in the PI’s office.  Only investigators and 
co-investigators will have access to  the photo files

6) Risks to Subjects  
The potential risks of this study include erythema post -laser intervention . Some patients may 
be at risk for potential pi[INVESTIGATOR_145252] a risk ; however, 
laser settings will be adj usted according to the particular area of the body being treated.  In 
addition Fitz patrick skin type s  III-V will be excluded from the study in order to minimize this 
risk. Common minor side effects may include crusting, mild swel ling, redness or brown 
discoloration at the intervention  site.  In rare cases, hypertrophic scarring or infection may 
occur. The potential risks of having a biopsy include pain, local swelling, bleeding and/or 
infection.   A small scar may result at the bio psy site.  To minimize the appearance of scarring 
from the biopsy the size of the punch biopsy will be limited to 3 mm.  
 
7) Provisions for Research Related Injury  
In the event of related harm or injury the patient will be clinically evaluated by [CONTACT_30780].  If harm is deemed to have occurred the patient will be triaged and treated in 
clinically standard treatment protocols.  In the case of worsening scar then may consider other 
modalities (e.g. surgery with a z plasty, dermabrasion, intralesional kenalog, other lasers) or 
discoloration (other lasers to correct color or topi[INVESTIGATOR_12491]).  
8) Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Potential benefit for the subjects will be improved cosmetic appearance of the excision scar 
that is treated with the laser.   In order to minimize any worsening of the scar appearance from 
the biopsy performed in the study, the size of the biopsy will be limited to [ADDRESS_166172] and investigators feel the intervention will improve the 
appearance of the biopsy site

During participation in this study, subjects will not be able to access their 
research records. This will be done to prevent the knowledge of study results 
from affecting the reliability of the study. Subjects’ informati on will be 
available should an emergency arise that would require their treating 
physician to know this information to best treat them. Subjects will have 
access to their research record and any study information that is part of that 
record when the study is over or earlier, if possible. The investigator is not 
required to release to subjects research information that is not part of their 
medical record. Subjects will always have access to their own clinical medical 
records while participating in this study .

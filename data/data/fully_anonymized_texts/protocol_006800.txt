Introduction, Background Information and Scientific Rationale  2.1. Background Information and Relevant Literature Hypertension is a common medical condition that increases the risk of ischemic heart disease, stroke, pe-ripheral vascular disease, and other cardiovascular diseases. Currently the gold standard for blood pres-sure management is an invasive intra-arterial blood pressure monitor.  A noninvasive wristband device has been developed for measurement of intermittent blood pressure. It is intended to be work in day-to-day life by [CONTACT_33899]-sure monitoring is important.  The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy of the non-invasive wristband device when com-pared to the invasive gold standard.  Lehman LW, Saeed M, Talmor D, Mark R, Malhotra A. Methods of blood pressure measurement in the ICU. Crit Care Med. 2013;41:34–40. doi: 10.1097/CCM.0b013e318265ea46. 2.2. Name [CONTACT_33915] a wristband device for measurement of intermittent blood pressure. It does not require any action by [CONTACT_33900]. The device uses no inflatable mechanics or moving parts. The wristband is watertight and can be worn as any type of bracelet. See at-tachment for device image.  The wristband device meets the criteria for IDE exemption because it is a diagnostic device that:  (i) Is noninvasive,  (ii) Does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents significant risk,  (iii) Does not by [CONTACT_33901] a subject, and  (iv) Is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by [CONTACT_20904], medically es-tablished diagnostic product or procedure.

 2.3. Potential Risks & Benefits 2.3.1. Known Potential Risks The only potential risk is the possible discomfort associated with wearing the wristband device. 2.3.2. Known Potential Benefits There is no potential benefit to participating in this study. In the future, the device may be used to benefit patients with high blood pressure or other conditions in which blood pressure monitoring is important.  3. Objectives and Purpose 3.1. Primary Objective The primary objective of the present investigation is to determine the accuracy of a non-invasive non-oscil-lometric blood pressure wristband device when compared to invasive intra-arterial blood pressure monitors within the ISO-[ZIP_CODE]-2 requirements 3.2. Secondary Objectives (if applicable) N/A 4. Study Design and Endpoints 4.1. Description of Study Design  1. A medical professional will measure simultaneous non-invasive auscultatory readings to determine the lateral difference for later adjustment of calculation accordingly. Calculation of lateral difference is provided in section (Error! Reference source not found.). All data from a subject shall be ex-cluded if: i) the lateral difference of the reference systolic BP readings is more than 15 mmHg (2,00 kPa); or ii) the lateral difference of the reference diastolic BP readings is more than 10 mmHg (1,33 kPa).  2. If subject's reading is eligible, the medical professional or research personnel will place the Live-Metric wristband on the opposite limb than the one having the A-line, providing the location of the placement has intact skin.  3. During the measurement stage, BP values are simultaneously recorded from the reference invasive A-line and the LiveMetric device. In addition, other vital signs from the monitoring equipment can be collected as available (ECG, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], Pleth, and HR). The invasive BP values and other vital signs are captured from the Vital Signs Monitor (available in the patient’s room) and the LiveMetric device. A measurement session of [ADDRESS_33305]: only up to [ADDRESS_33306] will be analyzed; measurement will be made over 30 seconds of recording; consecutive meas-
Study number: 17-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 6 Version:V3 07/18/[ADDRESS_33307] a 60 second interval. Meas-urement (data points) is defined as recording or acquisition of signal from the monitor. The medical professional will take off the wristband at the end of this process. 4. All measurements will be processed and analyzed retrospectively according to the requirements of the standard (ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2) as detailed below in section (Error! Reference source not found.). A 30-minute session of measurements will be conducted for each subject.  All the data will be pro-cessed and analyzed post measurement according to the following considerations as required by [CONTACT_33902]; only up to [ADDRESS_33308] will be analyzed; measurement will be made over 30 seconds of recording; consecutive measurement will be considered as the next [ADDRESS_33309] party (bio-statistician).  6. Demographics of the subject will be anonymous collected from the electronic medical record – height, weight, age, current medications, and general condition. 7. Blood pressure measurements from both the wristband and the intra-arterial blood pressure moni-tor will be compared.  4.2. Study Endpoints 4.2.1. Primary Study Endpoints  The study endpoint will be the time when [ADDRESS_33310] meet all of the following criteria: 1. Adult (>18 years old) ICU patient who already has an intra-arterial blood pressure measurement in place.  5.2. Exclusion Criteria An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study: 1. Body habitus that precludes patients from wearing a device on their wrist 2. Subjects without normal palpable radial artery pulse, whether congenital, due to medical interven-tion, or otherwise  3. Subjects with wrist circumference less than 155mm or greater than 210mm 4. Subjects implanted with VAD’s or other mechanical circulatory support device whether intracorpo-real or extracorporeal 5. Patients that do not have an intra-arterial blood pressure line.    
Study number: 17-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 7 Version:V3 07/18/[ADDRESS_33311] will not be considered. 5.4.1. Use of DataCore/Epic Information for Recruitment Purposes Potential subjects will be identified using the daily NYU Langone Health ICU and NYU Langone Brooklyn ICU census. The study investigators have a clinical relationship with these patients and will approach them for participation. No DataCore/Epic information will be used for recruitment.  5.5. Duration of Study Participation The total duration of subject participation in the study is expected to be approximately [ADDRESS_33312]. An investigator may terminate participation in the study if: • Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the partic-ipant • The participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously recog-nized) that precludes further study participation  5.7.2. Handling of Participant Withdrawals or Termination A subject may withdraw from the study at any time. If a subject withdraws, his or her data will not be in-cluded in this analysis. An additional subject will be needed to allow for the goal sample size to be achieved.  5.8. Premature Termination or Suspension of Study   
Study number: 17-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 8 Version:V3 07/18/2019   
 This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_33903]. If the study is prematurely terminated or sus-pended, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_33894](s) for the termination or suspen-sion. Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to: • Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants • Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] • Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements • Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable • Determination of futility  Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, data quality are addressed and sat-isfy the sponsor, IRB and/or FDA.  6. Study Agent (Study drug, device, biologic, vaccine etc.) and/or Procedural Intervention  6.1. Study Agent(s) and Control Description The device is a wristband. Because the subjects also have an intra-arterial blood pressure monitor in place, the subjects will serve as their own control. 6.1.1. Acquisition LiveMetric will provide the blood pressure wristbands for use in this study.  6.1.2. Device Specific Considerations The device is a wristband that will be worn by [CONTACT_33904] [ADDRESS_33313] will be directly observed by [CONTACT_33905]-sure compliance.  6.2. Study Procedures/Evaluations Blood pressure measurements from the arterial line will be recorded directly from the intra-arterial blood pressure monitor screen. Blood pressure measurements from the wristband device will be downloaded to a laptop computer using Medicollector software. No patient information will be in-cluded. 6.2.1. Study Specific Procedures  The following information will be collected anonymously for each subject: Age, weight, current   inpatient medications, general condition. No PHI will be saved.   
Study number: 17-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 9 Version:V3 07/18/[ADDRESS_33314] to determine willing-ness to participate in the study and to obtain verbal consent. 7. Assessment of Safety  7.1. Specification of Safety Parameters  No specific safety parameters. The only anticipated risk is the potential discomfort associated with wear-ing the wristband device. 7.1.1. Definition of Adverse Events (AE)  An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality: • results in study withdrawal • is associated with a serious adverse event • is associated with clinical signs or symptoms • leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests • is considered by [CONTACT_1372]  7.1.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)   Serious Adverse Event Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.  A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  • fatal • life-threatening • requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] • results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity • a congenital anomaly or birth defect • an important medical event  Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].   All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious ad-verse events.   7.1.3. Definition of Unanticipated Problems (UP)  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  • Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency  (i.e. not described in study-related documents such as the IRB-approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc) 
Study number: 17-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 10 Version:V3 07/18/2019   
 • Related or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_33906]-cedures involved in the research) • Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm).  This definition could include an unanticipated adverse device effect, any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investiga-tional plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated seri-ous problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects (21 CFR 812.3(s)).  7.2. Classification of an Adverse Event 7.2.1. Severity of Event  For AEs not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to de-scribe severity.  • Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily ac-tivities. • Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. • Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug ther-apy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or incapacitating.  7.2.2. Relationship to Study Agent  The clinician’s assessment of an AE's relationship to study agent (drug, biologic, device) is part of the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. All AEs must have their relationship to study agent assessed. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be sus-pect. To help assess, the following guidelines are used.  • Related – The AE is known to occur with the study agent, there is a reasonable possibility that the study agent caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study agent and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study agent and the AE. • Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study agent caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study agent and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.   7.2.3. Expectedness The only expected potential risk is the possible discomfort associated with wearing the wristband. No other adverse events are expected.   7.3. Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow-Up  
Study number: 17-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 11 Version:V3 07/18/2019   
 The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and in-terviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. All AEs in-cluding local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate RF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of sever-ity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagno-sis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be docu-mented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. UPs will be recorded in the data collection system through-out the study.  Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of on-set and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_33895]-tained until 7 (for non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.   All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the sub-ject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The investi-gator should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.   7.4. Reporting Procedures – Notifying the IRB   7.4.1. Adverse Event Reporting Adverse events will be reported to the investigators, the involved subject, the IRB, and to LiveMetric within [ADDRESS_33315], the IRB, and to Live-Metric within 24 hours of the event.  7.4.3. Unanticipated Problem Reporting   Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for UPs require the creation and completion of an UP re-port form. It is the site investigator’s responsibility to report UPs to their IRB and to the DCC/study spon-sor. The UP report will include the following information:  • Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number; • A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome; 
Study number: 17-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 12 Version:V3 07/18/2019   
 • An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome repre-sents an UP; • A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the UP.  To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:  • UPs that are SAEs will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor within <insert time-line in accordance with policy> of the investigator becoming aware of the event. • Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor within <insert timeline in accordance with policy> of the investigator becoming aware of the problem. • All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s writ-ten reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and OHRP within<insert timeline in accordance with policy> of the IR’s receipt of the report of the problem from the investi-gator.  7.5. Reporting Procedures – Notifying the Study Sponsor   The study clinician will complete a SAE Form within the following timelines:  • All deaths and immediately life-threatening events, whether related or unrelated, will be recorded on the SAE Form and submitted to the DCC/study sponsor within [ADDRESS_33316] information. • Other SAEs regardless of relationship will be submitted to the DCC/study sponsor within 72 hours of site awareness.  All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site investigator deems the event to be chronic or the adherence to be stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by [CONTACT_15791]/study sponsor and should be provided as soon as possible.   As a follow-up to the initial report, within the following [ADDRESS_33317] receives notice of the 
Study number: 17-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 13 Version:V3 07/18/[ADDRESS_33318] as FDA requests.   7.6. Study Halting Rules  If any SAE occurs, during the study, the study will be stopped.  7.7. Safety Oversight  It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of ad-verse events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety-monitoring plan. Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.   8. Clinical Monitoring  PI [INVESTIGATOR_33896].   9. Statistical Considerations Data from the A-line monitor and from the LiveMetric device shall be collected and pro-cessed using a validated Software. Categorical parameters shall be presented in percent-ages and will be compared using X2 testing. Continuous variables shall be reported as mean   standard deviation and will be compared using the Student’s t-test. Correlation shall be determined via linear regression analysis. Agreement shall be determined via the Bland and Altman technique. The analysis shall be conducted for intermittent values by [CONTACT_33907]-plying the reference ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2:2013. The LiveMetric device shall provide values for each intermittent session and shall be com-pared to a range measured by [CONTACT_941] A-Line (data point). The data point is defined as the interval between the lower and higher value read by [CONTACT_941] A-Line, providing: the interval is no less than 30 seconds; the difference range from the reference device is less than the permissible highest range of [ADDRESS_33319] edges of the reference reading to the values obtained by [CONTACT_33908] 9.1. Statistical and Analytical Plans (SAP) Baseline demographics including age, weight, current medications, and general medical condi-tion will be collected anonymously.  For each of the subjects, [ADDRESS_33320] devia-tion of 10 mm Hg (+/-5 mm Hg). Diastolic blood pressure measurements will be compared using an acceptable standard devia-tion of 10 mm Hg (+/-5 mm Hg). 
Study number: 17-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 14 Version:V3 07/18/[ADDRESS_33321] deviation of 5 mm Hg (+/- 2.5 mm Hg).  The percentage of blood pressure measurements falling within the acceptable standard devia-tion will be compared. The percentage of blood pressure measurements for each patient falling within the acceptable standard deviation will also be compared.  9.2. Statistical Hypothesis The hypothesis is that >90% of wristband blood pressure measurements will be within the ac-cepted standard deviation when compared to the intra-arterial blood pressure measurements.  9.2.1. General Approach All statistal analysis for this study will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Patricia Ayoung-Chee, MD, MPH u-sing Stat 15 software when needed. 9.2.2. Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s) N/A 9.2.3. Baseline Descriptive Statistics N/A  9.2.4. Planned Interim Analysis N/A  9.3.1. Determining the reference BP The invasive SYS and DIA BP values shall be determined from the recordings. (The BP reading will be recorded beat to beat, without any averaging, from the A-line and from the LiveMetric device). The mean and experimental standard deviation of the SYS and DIA BP from the record-ings will be determined.  Since there is no cuff inflation interruption by [CONTACT_33908], the A-line ranges shall be determined from the recording for a duration of 30 seconds, while simultaneously recording the same period of the data point from the LiveMetric device.  The reference SYS is defined as the range of a ± [ADDRESS_33322] deviation around the mean value of the invasive systolic BP values obtained during the data point range performed by [CONTACT_33908]. The reference DIA BP is defined as the range of ±[ADDRESS_33323] deviation around the mean value of the invasive diastolic BP values obtained during the same period. Isolated VPB’s shall be addressed by [CONTACT_33909].

 9.3.2. If the value obtained from the LiveMetric determination lies within the range of the reference BP as determined in (Error! Reference source not found.), assign an error of 0 mmHg (0 kPa) to this determination.  If the value obtained from the LiveMetric determination lies outside the range of the reference BP as determined in (Error! Reference source not found.) subtract the value of the determination from the adjacent limit of the range of the variation of BP. That difference represents the error for this determination. The arithmetic mean of the error is calculated and its experimental standard deviation from the errors of each recording for each BP value (SYS & DIA) and determination for each patient.   9.3.3. Data Analysis The data set will be collected for clinical investigation purposes andwill be processed and ana-lyzed according to the formulas provided in the ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2: 2013. The lateral difference will be calculated initially as the average difference between the readings or determination made on each limb according to Formula: 𝐿𝐷=13		×()𝑃𝑖,-./−)𝑃𝑗,2./3; i is the index for the determination on the limb used for the sphygmomanometer-under-test de-termination; j is the index for the reading on the limb used for the reference reading. Only data within the inclusion criteria as defined in section (Error! Reference source not found.) will be processed for the purpose of clinical investigations.  The mean value of the errors for SYS and DIA BP,  xn of the n individual paired determination of the LiveMetric device as determined above for all subjects, will be calculated according to For-mula: 𝑋67=	1𝑛	×)𝑋/72./ and Formula: 𝑆7=	:1𝑛−1×)(𝑋-−𝑋67)72./ Where;  𝑋/ is the error of the ith individual determination as determined in (Error! Reference source not found.);  
Study number: 17-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 16 Version:V3 07/18/2019   
 n is the total number of determinations;  i is the index for the individual determination. Mean or standard deviation outside the specified ranges above, mandate further algorithm mod-ification until subsequent testing with new data sets done in accordance with this protocol meets the above criteria.  9.3.4. Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint Primary Endpoint is determined by [CONTACT_33910]-ned by [CONTACT_5891] [ZIP_CODE]-2: 2013 9.5. Sample Size As determined in ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2 / 2013; a reference invasive BP monitoring equipment clinical investigation shall consist of a minimum of [ADDRESS_33324] and the wristband that is applied during the study.  10. Source Documents and Access to Source Data/Documents   Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clin-ical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dis-pensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_33897]-cation as being accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic me-dia, x-rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico-technical departments involved in the clinical trial. It is acceptable to use CRFs as source documents. If this is the case, it should be stated in this section what data will be collected on CRFs and what data will be col-lected from other sources.  The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data re-quested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.  Access to study records will be limited to IRB-approved members of the study team. The investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201]/EC, the sponsor, government regula-tory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study-related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
Study number: 17-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 17 Version:V3 07/18/2019   
 Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_17256].  11. Quality Assurance and Quality Control   QC procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data QC checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution.  Following written SOPs, the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)).  The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, and re-ports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456], and inspection by [CONTACT_3482].   12. Ethics/Protection of Human Subjects 12.1. Ethical Standard   The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with Regulations for the Protec-tion of Human Subjects of Research codified in 45 CFR Part 46, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 CFR Part 56, and/or the ICH E6.  12.2. Institutional Review Board   The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials will be submit-ted to the IRB for review and approval. Approval of both the protocol and the consent form must be ob-tained before any participant is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by [CONTACT_3484]. All changes to the consent form will be IRB approved; a determination will be made regarding whether previously consented participants need to be re-consented.  12.3. Informed Consent Process  12.3.1. Consent/Assent and Other Informational Documents Provided to Participants An IRB-approved consent script will be provided to the patient and verbal consent will be obtained from the subject or LAR. 12.3.2. Consent Procedures and Documentation  Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Discussion of risks and possible benefits of participation will be provided to the participants and their families. Consent forms will be IRB-approved 
Study number: 17-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 18 Version:V3 07/18/[ADDRESS_33325]’s research record. We are requesting a waiver of written documentation of consent and a waiver of HIPAA authorization because the only record linking the subject and the research would be the consent document, and the principal risk of the research would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confi-dentiality.     12.4. Participant and Data Confidentiality No PHI will be collected. All data will be stored anonymously.  No signed consent documents will exist. Only verbal consent will be obtained. Data collection will end at the time the wristband is removed.  13. Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  13.1 Data Collection and Management Responsibilities  Only anonymous data will be collected. No PHI will be retained. Anonymous data will be recorded and saved electronically. Intra-arterial blood pressure monitor data will be recorded automatically as per ICU standards. Data collection will be the responsibility of the investigators and will be stored on REDCap.  13.1. Study Records Retention  Study documents will be retained for the longer of 3 years after close-out, 5 years after final report-ing/publication, or [ADDRESS_33326] approval of a marketing application is approved for the drug for the indication for which it is being investigated or 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and FDA is notified if no application is to be filed or if the application has not been approved for such indication. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.  13.2. Protocol Deviations Any deviation in protocol will be reviewed by [CONTACT_33911]-jects can be included. If not, additional subjects will be required to obtain the goal sample size.  A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, GCP, or Manual of Procedures (MOP) requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or

 the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_33912]-mented promptly.  These practices are consistent with ICH E6: • 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3 • 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1 • 5.[ADDRESS_33327] be reported to the local IRB per their guidelines. The site PI/study staff is re-sponsible for knowing and adhering to their IRB requirements. Further details about the handling of proto-col deviations will be included in the MOP.  13.4. Publication and Data Sharing Policy  This study will comply with the NIH Public Access Policy, which ensures that the public has access to the published results of NIH funded research. It requires scientists to submit final peer-reviewed journal man-uscripts that arise from NIH funds to the digital archive PubMed Central upon acceptance for publication.  The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have adopted a clinical trials registration policy as a condition for publication. The ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human subjects to intervention or concurrent comparison or control groups to study the cause-and-effect relationship between a medical intervention and a health outcome. Medical interventions include drugs, surgical procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, process-of-care changes, and the like. Health outcomes include any biomedical or health-related measures obtained in patients or participants, including pharmacokinetic measures and adverse events. The ICMJE policy, and the Section [ADDRESS_33328] of 2007, requires that all clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov, which is sponsored by [CONTACT_1055]. Other biomedical journals are considering adopting similar policies. For interventional clinical trials performed under NIH IC grants and cooperative agreements, it is the grantee’s responsibility to register the trial in an acceptable registry, so the research results may be considered for publication in ICMJE member journals. The ICMJE does not review specific studies to determine whether registration is necessary; instead, the committee recommends that researchers who have questions about the need to register err on the side of registration or consult the editorial office of the journal in which they wish to publish.  FDAAA mandates that a "responsible party" (i.e., the sponsor or designated principal investigator) register and report results of certain "applicable clinical trials":  • Trials of Drugs and Biologics: Controlled, clinical investigations, other than Phase I investigations of a product subject to FDA regulation; • Trials of Devices: Controlled trials with health outcomes of a product subject to FDA regulation (other than small feasibility studies) and pediatric postmarket surveillance studies. • NIH grantees must take specific steps to ensure compliance with NIH implementation of FDAAA.  14. Study Finances 14.1. Funding Source LiveMetric will provide the investigational wristband device. No other funding is being received.  14.2. Costs to the Participant There is no cost to the subject for participation in this study.

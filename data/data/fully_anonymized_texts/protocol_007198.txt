Page 4SUMMARY
Indication:
Patients who have been treated in previous [COMPANY_007] sponsored oncology  studies ,with axitinib 
either as monotherap y or in combination with another anticancer drug .
Rationale:
Some patients in axitinib clinical trials may be experiencing clinical benefit from axitinib 
treatment either as monotherap y or in combination with another anticancer drug and may  
wish to continue treatment following completion of the trial. Such patients, a fter a written 
reconsent, may continue to receive axitinib and the combination study  drug (if applicable) at 
the same dose and schedule as specified in their prior axitinib protocol with the consensus of 
the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_453130], develop unacceptable toxicity  or withdraw consent. Complete 
information for the stud y drug(s) may be found in the Single Reference Safety Documents, 
which for this study  are the curren t Investigator Brochures (IBs).
Objectives:
The objective of the trial is to provide continued access to axitinib tablets and study  drug(s) 
given in combination (if applicable) to patients who have completed their participation in a 
prior axitinib monother apy or combination study  and who have documented stable or 
responding disease at the time they  discontinued in the trial. Continuing access will be 
provided to patients who have Progressive Disease (PD) but continue to experience clinical 
benefit from pre vious study treatment; in this case, clinical benefit is defined as the Sum of 
Longest Diameters (SLD) of measurable lesions remaining less than or equal to the baseline 
SLD in the previous axitinib trial (either monotherapy  or combination).  These patient s must 
not be eligible for treatment with other available approved therap y for the disease under 
study . 
Trial Design:
Axitinib trials (either monotherap y or combination) have been designed with a maximum 
number of treatment cy cles or length of treatment t ime.  However, some patients may  be 
deriving clinical benefit from the drug(s) and want to continue treatment with the 
investigational agent(s) but are unable to continue in their present trial.
This protocol will provide continued access to axitinib table ts and the combination study  
drug(s) if applicable for patients who were assigned to an axitinib -containing treatment arm 
in an axitinib clinical trial. For patients in combination treatment, if axitinib is interrupted 
due to toxicity , the continuation of the combination drug will be evaluated on a case b y case 
analysis after discussion with the Sponsor (based on the benefit risk assessment and other 
available options).

Final Protocol Amendment #7, [ADDRESS_577883] been receiving axitinib tablets (either 
monotherap y or combination) at the time their previous trial ended and have had Stable 
Disease (SD) or responding disease (PR or CR) according to the disease response criteria in 
the previous axitinib trial.  Patients who have Progressive Disease ( PD) but continue to 
experience clinical benefit in previous axitinib study  will be eligible for enrollment; in this 
case, clinical benefit is defined as the Sum of Longest Diameters (SLD) of measurable 
lesions remaining less than or equal to the baseline S LD in the previous axitinib trial.  These 
patients must not be eligible for treatment with other available approved therap y for the 
disease under stud y.  These patients will be allowed to continue receiving study  treatment(s) 
until the SLD of measurable le sions becomes greater than the baseline SL
D in the previous 
trial.
During treatment on this protocol, all patients will be evaluated for safet y per local standard 
clinical practice. Axitinib dosing or combination therapy  (if applicable) and concomitant 
treatments will be monitored. Follow up information on alive/death status will be collected 
every  [ADDRESS_577884] study  visit. Efficacy  parameters will not be evaluated as 
part of this protocol. Pending drug availability , patients may  continue to receive axitinib 
tablets or the combination drug(s) (if applicable) until the axitinib development program is 
terminated or when they  are no longer receiving benefit (defined as no longer having stable 
or responding disease according to institutional s tandards), or clinical benefit for eligible 
patients with PD as previously  defined.  
Endpoints:
All patients will be assessed for safet y by [CONTACT_453136].  Response to therap y will not be collected as part of this 
protocol.
Trial Treatments –Axitinib :
Axitinib will be supplied as 1 -mg and 5 -mg film -coated tablets for oral administration.
Trial Treatments – Combination Drug (if applicable) :
The study  drug(s) given in combination with ax itinib will be supplied according to the 
indications reported in the parent stud y protocol included in the Appendix 1 .
Statistical Methods:
Safety  data will be summarized for all treated patients using appropriate tabulations and 
descriptive statistics (see Section 9.2).

[IP_ADDRESS]. O verall Clinical Safety of Axitinib
As of 01 June 2012, a total of 4372 patients were enrolled into clinical studies in the axitinib 
clinical program and included in the safet
y (serious adverse event) database.  Of these, 
[ADDRESS_577894] current version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
Overall, the adverse events reported in axitinib clinical studies are considered manageable 
and were generall y reversible and expected f or this class of agents.  For single -agent axitinib, 
the most common adverse events reported from 699 cancer patients regardless of causalit y 
included diarrhea (397 patients, 56.8%), fatigue (368 patients, 52.6%), h ypertension 
(318 patients, 45.5%), decrea se appetite (286 patients, 40.9%), nausea (264 patients, 37.8%), 
dysphonia (242 patients, 34.6%), palmar -plantar ery throd ysaesthesia s yndrome (202 patients, 
28.9%), weight decreased (197 patients, 28.2%), vomiting (166 patients, 23.7%), 
constipation (165 patients, 23.6%), headache (151 patients, 21.6%), cough (149 patients, 
21.3%), arthralgia and d yspnea (140 patients, 20%).  Additionally, h ypoth yroidism and 
proteinuria were reported as adverse events in 122 patients (17.5%) and 117 patients 
(16.7 %), respe ctivel y.  Grade 3+ events occurred most frequently for h ypertension 
(134 patients, 19.2%), fatigue (90 patients, 12.9%), and diarrhea (65 patients, 9.3%).
In patients with solid tumors who received single -agent axitinib from completed studies, the 
majorit y of the hematological test abnormalities were Grade 1 and 2, however 53 patients 
(7.9%) reported Grade 3 ly mphocy topenia, and the following Grade 3 or 4 events were 
reported: 9 patients (1.3%) hemoglobin decreased, 9 patients (1.3%) neutrophils decreased,
3patients (0.4%) white blood cells decreased, 2 patients (0.3%) platelets decreased.  As per 
clinical chemistry , Grade 3 or 4 lipase abnormalities were reported in 26 patients (7%), 
hyponatremia in 34 patients (5%), hy pergl ycemia in 23 patients (3.3%), h yperkalemia in 
22 patients (3.2%), elevations in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), aspartate

[IP_ADDRESS]. Overall Clinical Safety of Combination Drug (if applicable)
An overview of safety  and information on study  drug(s)given in combination with the 
Axitinib is ava ilable in the parent protocol(s) in the Appendix 1 . 
Additional information for the study  drug (s) may  be found in the Single Reference Safet y 
Document, which for this study  are the current Investigator Brochure ( IBs).
1.3.Rationale
Some patients in axitinib clinical trials may be experiencing clinical benefit from axitinib
either as monotherap y or in combination with another anticancer drug and may  wish to 
continue treatment following completion of the trial.  Such patients , after a wr itten 
re-consent, may  continue to receive axitinib and the combination study drug (if applicable) at 
the same dose and schedule as specified in their prior axitinib protocol , with the consensus of 
the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_453131], develop unacceptable toxicity  or withdraw consent .
Complete information for the study  drug(s) may be found in the Single Reference Safety  
Documents, which for this study  are the current Investig ator Brochures.
2.TRIAL OBJECTIVES
The objective of the trial is to provide continued access to axitinib tablets and to the study  
drug(s) given in combination (if applicable) to patients who have completed their 
participation in a prior axitinib monotherapy  or combination study and who ha vedocumented 
stable disease, responding disease or clinical benefit as described below at the time they  
discontinued from the previous trial.
3.
TRIAL DESIGN
Axitinib trials (either monotherap y or combination) have been designe d with a maximum 
number of treatment cy cles.  However, some patients may  be deriving clinical benefit from 
the drug(s) and want to continue treatment with the investigational agent(s) but are unable to 
continue in their present trial.
This protocol will provide continued access to axitinib tablets and the combination study  
drug(s) if applicable for patients who were assigned to an axitinib -containing treatment arm 
in an axitinib clinical trial.  For patients in combination treatment, if axitinib is interrup ted 
due to toxicity , the continuation of the combination drug will be evaluated on a case b y case 
analysis after discussion with the Sponsor (based on the benefit risk assessment and other 
available options).

Patients treated wi th axitinib will be issued blood pressure cuffs (provided by  [CONTACT_4618]) for 
home monitoring and instructed to measure their blood pressure (BP) twice daily , prior to 
taking each dose.  All blood pressure measurements will be recorded in a diary  and brought 
tothe nurse or stud y coordinator at each clinic visit for review.  Patients should be instructed 
by [CONTACT_453142] 150 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure rises ab ove 100 mm Hg, or if they  
develop s ymptoms perceived to be related to elevated BP (eg, headache, visual disturbance).   
See below for dose modifications for h ypertension.
New or additional antihypertensive therap y (See Section 5.4, Concomitant Medication(s) for 
guidance) should be started if [ADDRESS_577901] 1 hour, show the following: 2 s ystolic blood pressure readings greater than 150 or 
2
diastolic blood pressure readings greater than 100 mm Hg.  Alternatel y, the dose of existing 
antihy pertensive medication(s) may  be increased.  Note: the earl y introduction of 
antihy pertensive agents for Grade 1 and Grade 2 hypertension in order to minimi ze the 
occurrence of more severe or persistent h ypertension while undergoing treatment with 
axitinib will not constitute a Grade 3 toxicity .
If the patient is alread y on maximal antihy pertensive treatment, the stud y drug should be 
reduced b y 1dose level.
Patients on maximal antihy pertensive treatment (to be defined on an individual patient basis 
according to the judgment of the investigator, but may  include up to 4 anti-hypertensive 
medications given for 2 weeks) who have [ADDRESS_577902] treatment with axitinib held.  (Note: if study 
drug is held, patients receiving antih ypertensive medications should monitor closely  for 
hypotension). 
Blood pressure may  decrease within [ADDRESS_577903] 
antihy pertensive medications should be done in the clinic.  Plasma half -life of axitinib is 
2-4hours and BP usually decreases within 1 -2 days following dose interruption. 
Treatment with axitinib should be restarted at 1 lower dose level, rounded down to 
accommodate dosage form availabilit y, after the systolic blood pressure reduces to less than 
150mm Hg and the diastolic blood pressure reduces to less than 100 mm Hg.

[IP_ADDRESS].2. Dose Reduction for Hemoptysis (Axitinib Monotherapy)
Bleeding from the lungs as evi denced b y hemopt ysis will be graded according to the 
Hemorrhage category  of CTCAE.
Treatment with axitinib will be discontinued for hemopty sis of >½ tsp of bright red blood per 
day.  In addition, a radiologic assessment (eg, chest x -ray) should be considered for patients 
who have hemopt ysis >½ tsp of bright red blood per day .  If the hemopt ysis resolves to 
baseline within 1 week and there is no evidence of disease cavitation, treatment with axitinib 
may continue at the current dose level.  Patients who expe rience hemopt ysis without 
resolution to baseline within 1 week, or with evidence of disease cavitation should 
discontinue from treatment with axitinib.
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Dose Reduction for Proteinuria (Axitinib Monotherapy)
Monitoring for proteinuria before initiation of an d periodicall y throughout treatment with 
axitinib is recommended, as per clinical judgment.  For patients who develop moderate to 
severe proteinuria, monitoring, and dose reduction or temporary  interruption of axitinib given 
in monotherapy  should be considered.

Page 22General guidelines are reported below.  Medical judgment, and the patient’s clinical 
conditions, should always be considered to determine the most appropriate monitoring of 
proteinuria.  Safeguard of the patient’s safet y and a positive risk -benefit a ssessment should 
alway s be evaluated when less restrictive monitoring is adopted.
Perform dipstick proteinuria (or equivalent semi- quantitative test) at regular frequency .  At 
documentation of >2+ or equivalent proteinuria by [CONTACT_5230], patients should have a 24-hour 
urine collection for total protein.  Axitinib dosing may  continue while waiting for test results.
If <2 g proteinuria/24 -hour is reported, treatment with axitinib may  continue without dose 
reduction.
If 2 g proteinuria/24 -hour is reported, trea tment with axitinib should be interrupted.  A 
24-hour urine collection for total protein and creatinine clearance should be performed 
weekl y until results show <2 g proteinuria/[ADDRESS_577913] 
weekl y monitoring for proteinuria by [CONTACT_325270] (eg, dipstick) as long as the 
proteinuria reading is 2+ or higher, or, alternatively , by [CONTACT_453144] 1g/24-hour.  The 24- hour urine collection to monitor the degree of 
proteinuria should be repeated every  4weeks until it has decreased to <500 mg/24 -hour.
If recurrent 2g proteinuria/24

[IP_ADDRESS]. Dose Interruption and Reductions (Combination Therapy, if applicable)
The recommended dose modifications of the combination therap y with axitinib and other 
anticancer stud y drug(s) are detailed i n the relevant parent protocol ( Appendix 1 ). 
In case the patient withdraws the drug given in combination with axitinib, and continue 
on axitinib alone, the dose interruptions and modifications will follow the study 
A4061008 axiti nib monotherapy dose modification rules. 
5.3. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability (Axitinib and Combination Drug, if 
applicable)
The investigator or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist) will ensure that all trial drugs 
are stored in a secure area, under recommended storage conditions and in accordance with 
applicable regulatory  requirements.  
Axitinib and the other anticancer drug(s) given in combination should be stored at controlled 
room temperature (15 -30C), in provided packaging.

Axitinib is a hazardous drug (due to possible reproductive toxici ty), and should be handled 
according to the recommended procedures described in the current edition of the American 
Society  of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128579] (ASHP), Technical Assistance Bulletin on Handling 
Cytotoxic and Hazardous Drugs, American Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_453132] (AHFS) Drug

5.4.Concomitant Medication(s) 
5.4.1. Concomitant Medication(s) (Axitinib Monotherapy)
Palliative and supportive care for disease -related sy mptoms will be offered to all patients on 
this trial.  L ow-dose oral steroids (defined as 5 mg per day  prednisone or equivalent) or 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_453134] .  The therapeutic use of 
colony -stimulating factors is a matter of clinical judgment.  Prophy lactic u se is permitted in 
patients who have experienced infection or grade [ADDRESS_577916] labeling and 
should be documented in the patient's medical record. 
In vitro studies with human liver microenz ymes and recombinant CYP450 enzy mes indicated 
that axitinib metabolism was primaril y mediated by [CONTACT_33641] -metabolizing enzy me CYP3A, 
and to a lesser extent by  [CONTACT_097]1A2, CYP2C19 and UGT1A1.  Clinically , there is like lihood 
that axitinib plasma concentrations may  be increased in the presence of co -administered 
strong inhibitors of CYP3A.  The potential exists for drug -drug interactions with CYP3A 
inhibitors such as grapefruit juice, ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazo le, ery thromy cin, 
clarithrom ycin, verapamil, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], and 
delavirdine.  Caution should be exercised in patients receiving axitinib in combination with 
these and other strong CYP3A inhibitors Axitinib metaboli sm may  be induced in patients 
taking CYP3A4 inducers (carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], dexamethasone, felbamate, omeprazole, 
phenobarbital, phen ytoin, primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, and St John’s wort ) and this may  
reduce axitinib plasma concentrations.  Patients who requi re concomitant treatment with 
strong CYP3A inducers are not eligible for the trial.  Since CYP1A2 is also known to be 
induced in chronic smokers, there is likelihood that axitinib plasma concentrations may  be 
reduced in these individuals.

Page 24The ability  of axitinib to increase concentrations of co -administered drugs was also 
investigated in studies with human liver microsomes.  At expected therapeutic plasma 
concentrations (0.01 to 1.0 µg/mL), axitinib appears most likely  to inhibit the drug 
metabolizing enzy mes CYP1A2 and CYP2C8, 2 enzy mes not frequentl y observed as 
predominant drug metabolizing enzy mes.  However co- administration of axitinib with 
paclitaxel, a CYP2C8 substrate did not increase plasma concentrations of paclitaxel in 
patients, indicating lack of clinical CYP2C8 inhibition.  Axitinib is highly  bound to proteins 
in human plasma (99.5% bound at concentrations of 0.2 to 20 µg/mL).  Therefore, drug 
interactions with other agents that are also highl y bound to plasma proteins are a possibility .
Patients who need to be on chronic antacid therapy  with histamine H 2antagonists (eg, 
cimetidine [Tagamet®], famotidine [Pepcid®], nizatidine [Axid®], ranitidine [Zantac]) or 
proton- pump inhibitors (eg, lansoprazole [Prevacid®], rabeprazole [Aciphex®], pantopr azole 
[Protonix®], and esomeprazole [Nexium®]) or locally  acting antacids (eg, Maalox®, Milk of 
Magnesia®, Amphojel®) should stagger the timing of their axitinib and antacid dosing.  
Patients should avoid use of antacids for [ADDRESS_577917] drug -drug interactions with commonly  used antihy pertensive 
agents belonging to the class of ACE inhibitors including angiotensin II receptor antagonists 
(enalapril, captopril, losartan, vasarta n), beta -blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, labetalol), or 
diuretics (h ydrochlorothiazide, furosemide).  Within the class of calcium channel blockers, 
verapamil, and to a lesser extent nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nicardipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and diltiazem have a potential for 
increasing axi tinib plasma concentrations, due to CYP3A inhibition and should not be used 
as first choice in antihy pertensive treatment.  Other calcium channel blockers (amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
bepridil, felodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) are less likely  to raise axitinib plasma levels.  The above inform ation is 
based on preclinical data from studies using human and animal metabolizing enz yme 
systems.
Patients who need to be on anticoagulant therap y during treatment with axitinib should be 
treated with low molecular weight heparin as the preferred therap y. 
All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as interventions (eg, analgesic use 
or paracentesis) received by  [CONTACT_453146] (eCRF).
Regarding t he concomitant surgery , no formal studies of the effect of axitinib on wound 
healing have been conducted, however caution is advise based on the mechanism of action. 
If a major surgery or an interventional procedure (eg ,endoscop y) is required, treatment with 
axitinib must be interrupted at least 24 hours before the procedure. 
Patients may  resume the treatment with axitinib according to the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], 
when wound has completely  healed and there are no wound healing complications (eg ,
delayed healing, wound infection or fistula).

6.4.Patient Withdrawal
A patient may  withdraw from the trial at an y time at their own request, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety or behavioral 
reasons, or the inability  of the patient to comply  with the protocol required schedule of study  
visits or proc edures at a given stud y site.  If a patient does not return for a scheduled visit, 
every  effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_102].  I n any  circumstance, every  effort should 
be made to document patient outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inqu ire about the 
reason for withdrawal, request the patient to return all unused investigational product(s), 
request the patient to return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow -up with the patient 
regarding an y unresolved adverse events (AEs).

data collected before such withdrawal of consent.
7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS
The safet y of axitinib and the study  drug(s) given in combination should be evaluated using 
the local standard clinical practice. 
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However it is anticip ated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test.  In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safet y and well being of the pa tient.  When a protocol required test cannot be performed, the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions 
which he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  
The study te am will be informed of these incidents in a timely  manner.
Patients receiving axitinib (either as monotherap y or in combination therapy) should be 
monitored for signs and sy mptoms of hy pothy roidism, such as fatigue, deepening of voice, 
cold intolerance, co nstipation, anorexia, periorbital edema, m yxedema, or changes in skin or 
hair.  Hy pothy roidism should be treated per standard medical practice to maintain euthy roid 
state.
In case of combination therap y, additional texts or examination might be required in
accordance with the parent protocol(s) (see Section 6.2and 6.3above and, for more details, 
see relevant sections in parent protocol Appendix 1 ).
Pregnancy Test
For female patients of child bearing potential (ie, who in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_453135] y capable of having children and sexually active), a serum or urine pregnancy test 
will be performed at scre ening/baseline visit.  Pregnancy  tests will also be done whenever 
one menstrual cy cle is missed during the active treatment period (or when potential 
pregnancy  is otherwise suspected).  Tests may  also be repeated as per request of I RB/IECs or 
if required b y local regulations.
8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING 
8.1.Adverse Events
All observed or volunteered adverse events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections . 
For all adverse events the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to 
determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the criteria for 
classification as a serious adverse event (See Section 8.6) requiring immediate notification to 

Axitinib (AG-013736 )
Protocol A4061008
Final Protocol Amendment #7, [ADDRESS_577920] ed from 
the investigator to provide clarit y and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study . 
8.2.Reporting Period
For serious adverse events, the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated 
representative begins from the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is 
obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study , ie, prior to undergoing an y 
study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and including 
28calendar day s (longer follow up period might need to be adopted based on the 
combination drug characteristics) after the last administration of the investigational product.  
SAEs occurring to a subject after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to 
the sponsor if th e investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational 
product are to be reported to the S ponsor.Adverse events (serious and non -serious) should be 
recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has taken at least one dose of investigational 
product through last patient
’s last visit.
If a patient begins a new anticancer therap y, the adverse event reporting period for 
non-serious adverse events ends at the time the new treatment is started. 
Death must be reported if it occurs during the serious adverse event reporting period after the 
last dose of investigational product, irrespective of an y intervening treatment.
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An a dverse event is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient 
administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal 
relationship with the treatment or usage.  Examples of adverse events include but are not 
limited to:  
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 29Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdos e;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse;
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy ;
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;
Occupational exposure ;
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy  under trial should be reported as 
adverse e vents in the appropriate section of the CRF.  Disease progression assessed 
by [CONTACT_292109].
8.4.Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result, in this study , from the administration or consumption of the 
wrong product, b y the wrong subject, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.  
Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication 
error CRF , which is a specific vers ion of the Adverse Event ( AE)page, and on the SAE form 
when appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified 
immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including :
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.

Axitinib (AG-013736 )
Protocol A4061008
Final Protocol Amendment #7, 08 November 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 30Whether or not the medication error is accom panied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error is captured on the medication error version of the AE page 
and, if applicable, an y associated AE(s) are captured on an AE CRF page.  
8.5.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determini ng whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an adverse event are as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in trial dosing outside of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments or discontinuation from the trial, significant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other therapy; and/or
Test result is considered to be an adverse event b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an adverse event. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does 
not require reporting as an adverse event.
8.6.Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity ; (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Progression of the malignancy  under stud y (including signs and s ymptoms of progression) 
should not be reported as an SAE unless the outcome is fatal within the safety  reporting 
period.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_185569] s ymptoms of disease progression should not be 
reported as an SAE.  If the malignancy  has a fatal outcome during the study or within the 
safet y reporting period, then the event leading to death must be recorded as an AE and as an 
SAE with CTCAE Grade 5 (see the Section 8.8 Severity  Assessment ).

Axitinib (AG-013736 )
Protocol A4061008
Final Protocol Amendment #7, 08 November 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 31Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an event is an 
important medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life 
threatening and/or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the 
event may  jeopardize the patient ormay require intervention to prevent one of the other AE 
outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.6.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events 
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study . All SAEs will be reported by  [CONTACT_4688], and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y 
database (see the section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements). 
8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induc ed Liver Injury
Abnormal values in AST and/or ALT concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin 
that meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury  are 
considered potential cases of drug -induced liver injury  (poten tial Hy ’s Law cases) and should 
alway s be considered important medical events. 
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug -induced liver injury  
depends on the patient’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.  Pati ents who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Patients with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subs equently  present with AST or AL T values 3 times the upper limit of 
normal (X ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value [ADDRESS_577921] with no evidence 
of hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase value  2X ULN or not available.
For patients with preexisting ALT OR AST OR total bilirubin values above the upper 
limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition 
mentioned above:
For patients with pre -existing AST or ALT baseline values above the normal 
range: AST or ALT values 
2times the baseline values and  [ADDRESS_577922], or 
[ADDRESS_577923] (whichever is smaller).
Concurrent with :
For patients with pre -existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin increased by  [CONTACT_292110]≥3 times the 
upper l imit of normal (whichever is smaller).

Axitinib (AG-013736 )
Protocol A4061008
Final Protocol Amendment #7, 08 November 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 32The patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory tests, detailed history  and phy sical assessment.  The possibility  of hepatic 
neoplasia (primary  or secondary ) should be also considered.  In addition to repeating AST 
and ALT, laboratory  tests should include albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and 
indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl transferase, prothrombin time (PT)/I NR, and alkaline 
phosphatase.  A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, 
acetaminophen , recreational drug and supplement consumption, family  history , occupat ional 
exposure, sexual history , travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced patient, surgery , 
blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  
Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary  tract) 
may be warranted.  All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria 
defined above, with no other cause for LFT abnormalities identified at the time should be 
considered potential Hy ’s Law cases irrespective of availability  of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology  of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy ’s 
Law cases should be reported as SAEs.
8.7.Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47575] y initial admission (eve n less than 24 hours) in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8843].  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, med ical floor to a coronary  care unit, neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).
An emergency  room visit does not necessarily  constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; however, the 
event leading to the emergency  room visit should be assessed for medical importance.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593];
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (eg, caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same day  surgeries (as outpatient/same day /ambulatory  procedures).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] o r prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149327] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical 
adverse event is not in itself a serious adverse event.  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the preexisting condition 
(eg, for work -up of persistent pre -treatment lab abnormality );

Axitinib (AG-013736 )
Protocol A4061008
Final Protocol Amendment #7, 08 November 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 33Social admission (eg, patient has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol -specified admission during a clinical trial (eg, for a procedure required by  
[CONTACT_47519]);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_10244] (eg, for 
elective cosmetic surgery);
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE ;
Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;
Admission exclusively  for the administration of blood products.
Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as adverse events.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported and it meets the definition of an adverse event.  For example, 
an acute ap pendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported 
as the adverse event, and the resulting appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the 
adverse event.
8.8.Severity Assessment
If required on the adverse event case report forms, the investigator will use the following 
definitions of severit y in accordance with National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.[ADDRESS_577924] be consistent with the description of CTCAE grade included in the narrative section of 
the serious adverse event report. 
GRADE Clinical Description of Severity 
0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in 
the Version 4.03 document but may  be used in certain circumstances.)
1 MILD Adverse Event
2 MODERATE Adverse Event
3 SEVERE Adverse Event
4 LIFE -THREATENING OR DI SABLING Adverse Event
5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event

Axitinib (AG-013736 )
Protocol A4061008
Final Protocol Amendment #7, 08 November 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 34Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe 
event is not necessarily  a serious event.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes 
significantl y with patient's usual function) but would no t be classified as serious unless it met 
one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above.
8.9.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all adverse events (serious 
and non- serious), the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting 
requirements if applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of 
whether there exists a rea sonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or 
contributed to an adverse event; generally , the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a 
causal relationship should be provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the 
investig ational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to 
investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined b y the Sponsor (See the Section 
on Reporting Requirements ).  If the invest igator's causality  assessment is “unknown but not 
related to investigational product,” this should be clearl y documented on trialrecords. 
In addition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse event is associated with trial
procedures, the investi gator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and 
CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse 
event reporting requirements, if applicable.
8.10. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy (EDP) occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg , because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational
product, or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed t o the investigational product; 
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_4490] 
a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg , a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products) ;
A male has been exposed, (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure), to 
the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exp osed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .
If any stud y patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to [COMPANY_007] drug s afety unit on an 
SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental 
form, regardless whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit 
information regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a 

Axitinib (AG-013736 )
Protocol A4061008
Final Protocol Amendment #7, [ADDRESS_577925] by  [CONTACT_453150][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an 
adverse event has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The 
informat ion submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for 
information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome 
forall EDP reports with an unknown outcome.   The investigator will follow the pregnancy  
until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a 
follow up to the initial EDP supplemental form. 
In the case of a live birth, the structural integrit y of the neonate can b e assessed at the time of 
birth.  I n the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if 
clinically  possible, the structural integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed b y gross 
visual inspection (unless pre -proce dure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y 
and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for a serious adverse event (ie, ectopic 
pregnancy , spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise neonatal death , or congenital 
anomaly  [in a live born baby , a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal 
death], the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting serious adverse events.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that a re reported as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_577926]. 
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_093].  Further 
follow -
up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the study  patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of Informat ion 
Form to deliver to his partner.  The Investigator must document in the source documents that 
the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
8.11. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, d uring the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.

Axitinib (AG-013736 )
Protocol A4061008
Final Protocol Amendment #7, 08 November 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 36An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unit within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a CRF; howe ver, a copy  of the completed SAE report form 
is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Patient Withdrawal ,Section 6.4)
Withdrawal due to adverse events
should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other 
causes, according to the definition of adverse event noted earlier, and recorded on the 
appropriate adverse event CRF page. 
When a patient withdraws because of a serious ad verse event, the serious adverse event must 
be reported in accordance with the reporting requirements defined below.
8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events 
spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_4694].  In addition, each study patient will be 
questioned about adverse events.
8.14. Reporting Requirements 
Each adverse event is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for serious adverse 
event.  If a serious adverse ev ent occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and 
international regulations, as appropriate.
8.14.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If a serious adverse event occurs, [COMPANY_007] is to be notified within [ADDRESS_577927] be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available adverse event information.  
This timeframe also applies to additional new information (fol low-up) on previously  
forwarded serious adverse event reports as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of 
EDP and exposure via breastfeeding cases. 
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a serious 
adver se event immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  patient initially  seeks treatment 
elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and 
document the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse event.
For all serio us adverse events, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information 
to [COMPANY_007] in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an 
investigator may  be requested by  [CONTACT_4695] -up information in 
an expedited fashion.  This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that 
captured on the adverse event case report form.  In general, this will include a description of 
the adverse event in sufficient detail to allow for a comple te medical assessment of the case 

Axitinib (AG-013736 )
Protocol A4061008
Final Protocol Amendment #7, 08 November 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 37and independent determination of possible causality .  Information on other possible causes of 
the event, such as concomitant medications, vaccines, and/or illnesses must be provided.  In 
the case of a patient death, a summar y of available autopsy findings must be submitted as 
soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative. 
8.14.2. Non-
Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All adverse events are to be reported on the adverse event page of the CRF.  I t should be 
noted that the form for collection of SAE information is not the same as the AE CRF.  Where 
the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For 
example, the same AE term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reporte d using 
concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE 
information.
8.14.3. Sponsor Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse event reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
9.1.Sample Size Determination
The sample size is not statistically  driven and is dependent upon the number of patients 
included in the clinical trial program for axiti nib (as monotherap y or in combination therapy) 
who are eligible for this extension study  and wish to continue with the treatment.
9.2.Safety Analysis
All patients receiving at least 1 dose of axitinib (as monotherap y or combination therap y) 
under this protocol will be included in the safet y analyses.  Adverse events will be coded and 
grouped b y bod y system.  The incidence of each adverse event will be tabulated and 
display ed by [CONTACT_325280].  Tabulations b y maximum severity  and relationship to 
Axitinib a nd/or with another anticancer drug(s) given in combination with axitinib, if 
applicable will also be included.  Summary patient listings will be provided for SAEs, 
adverse events resulting in discontinuation of axitinib, and deaths within 28 day s of drug 
discontinuation and possibly  or probabl y related to axitinib or to the anticancer drug(s) given 
in combination with axitinib.
9.3.Efficacy Analysis
Efficacy  will not be assessed in this protocol.
9.4.Data Monitoring Committee 
This study  will not use an external Da ta Monitoring Committee/[COMPANY_007] Safety  
Committee/I nternal Oncology  Business Unit -Safety  Data Monitoring Committee.

Axitinib (AG-013736 )

Ethics Committee (I EC), and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by  [CONTACT_4618], or 
companies working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_36550].
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process. 
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term Case Report Form (CRF) should be understood to refer to 
either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, dependi ng on the data collection 
method used in this trial.
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any  other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  CRFs 
must be signed b y the inve stigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the data 
contained on the CRF is true.  Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source 
documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents will be the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s or the phy sician’s chart.  In cases 
where the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31019]’s chart, the information 
collected on the CRFs must match those charts. 

Axitinib (AG-013736 )
Protocol A4061008
Final Protocol Amendment #7, 08 November 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 39In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as the source document.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as t he 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identit y of all participating patients (sufficient 
information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed 
consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], serious adverse event forms, source documents, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, mee ting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be 
retained b y the investigator according to International Conference on Harmonisation (I CH), 
local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study  Agreement, whichever is longer.
If the invest igator relocates, retires, or for any  reason withdraws from the trial, [COMPANY_007] should 
be prospectivel y notified.  The trial records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to 
[COMPANY_007], such as another investigator, another institution, or to an independe nt third party  
arranged b y [COMPANY_007].  Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_577929] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permis sion before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the trial protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, eg, 
recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/IEC approvals shoul d be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/ IEC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Trial
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelin es for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World 
Medical Association 2008).  Where mandated b y local law, complianc e with 1996 version of 
the Declaration of Helsinki applies.

The investigator must ensure that each study  patient, or his/her legal representative, is fully  
informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with 
participation.  The investigator, or a person designated by  [CONTACT_093], will obtain written 
informed consent from each patient or the patient’s legal representative before an y 
study -specific activity  is performed.  The investigator will retain the original of each patient’s 
signed consent form.
12.4. Reporting Of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
Competent Authority  in any  area of the World, or if the investigator is aware of a ny new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the 
investigational product, [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately. 
In addition, the investigator will inform [COMPANY_007] immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study  patients against any  immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial in all Participating Countries 
End of Tri al in all participating countries is defined as the time at which all patients enrolled

Title:   CrYobiopsy with Radial UltraSound Guidance (CYRUS)  - a Randomized Controlled Study  
Protocol Version Number and Date:  Protocol Version 11, Date: 12/12/2017  
Purpose  
Hypothesis  
Transbronchial cryobiopsy carr ies a higher chance of establishing pathological diagnosis in diffuse parenchymal 
lung disease  (DPLD) than traditional transbronchial forceps guided biopsy1. It is a novel technique capable of 
obtaining large, high -quality samples of lung tissue in a minimally invasive manner. This procedure may 
decrease  the need for surgical lung biopsy in 75% of cases2. However,  there is an increased risk of 
pneumothorax and airway bleeding comp ared to  traditional transbronchial forceps guided biopsy3.  
Several  strategies are used by [CONTACT_366662] . These includ e prophylactic placement of an endobronchial blocker, the use of fluoroscopy  
guidance , instillation of cold saline  to promote vasoconstriction , and establishment of a secure airway with  
endotracheal tube  placement  or rigid bronchoscopy4.   
Vanderbilt University Medical Center is one of the most active centers in terms  of cryobiopsies performed as 
part of the diagnostic workup of DPLD . Currently all transbronchial cryobiopsies here are performed under 
fluoroscopic guidance, with endotracheal tube intubation and endobronchial blocker placement5. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_222860], p ost biopsy bleeding complications occur and can substantially lengthen the duration of the 
procedure and occasionally ex pose patients to procedural complications.  
Radial ultrasound has been well utilized to define anatomy of peripheral lung and localization of peripheral 
pulmonary nodule s6. We postulate that  using radial ultrasound to identify peribronchial lung parenchyma with 
low vascularity will mitigate the  risk of hemorrhage during peripheral lung cryobiopsy in patients with DPLD  
and hence improve patient safety .  
Aims and Objectives  
To study the impact of radial probe ultrasound guid ance for localization of areas of low vascularity to decrease 
bleeding com plications af ter cryobiopsies .

Expected Outcomes   
We anticipate that using radial ultrasound guidance  during t ransbronchial cryobiopsy  will result in decreased 
bleeding . This will be measured  by [CONTACT_366663]  (primary endpoint) . Other 
endpoints will  include grade of bleeding after each biopsy, use of additional modalities to control bleeding, size 
of biopsy , histologic evidence of vascular structures and histologic diagnosis (secondary endpoints).   
Background  
Diffuse parenchymal lung diseases comprise a group of noninfectious, non -neoplastic lung diseases, each 
characterized by [CONTACT_366664] o f the parenchyma of both lung s. The 
differentiation of these disorders may requ ire biopsy material, particularly in patients with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_366644]. Cryobiopsies offer specialists the advantage of being able to collect much larger 
specimens than can be collected with forceps biopsy,  while  preserv ing the underlying lung architecture  (no 
crush artifact) . The biggest disadvantage of cryobiopsy  is a higher risk of procedural bleeding and , to a lesser 
extent, pneumothorax than conventional transbronchial lung biopsies.  
Existing cryobiopsy literature is signif icantly limited by [CONTACT_366665], variable diagnostic 
endpoints  and non-uniform grading of complications .  Surgical lung biopsy, currently the gold standard for 
histological diagnosis of DPLD , is associated with significant morbidity and mortality . The rate of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_366645] 1.7% in a large dataset, with a complication rate of 
30% (including post -operative pneumothorax, pneumonia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_366646])7. Mortality was slightly lower at 
1.5% for elective operations but markedly higher at 16% for operations labeled “ non-elective ,” presumably 
performed in the setting of acute disease exacerbations.  Clearly, less invasive strategies, such as cryobiopsy, are 
urgently needed.  
Recent studies demonstrate  that there might be a trend toward more bleeding complications with transbronchial 
cryobiopsies8. The increased risk of bleeding is due to the larger biopsies thus obtained, and the necessity to 
retrieve bronchoscope and cryoprobe en -bloc as biopsies are too large to be pulled through he working channel 
of the bronchoscope, preventing the proceduralist f rom keepi[INVESTIGATOR_366647]. 9Accordingly, mo st proceduralists perform cryobiopsy with  prophylactic  
placement of bronchial blocker positioned proximal to the selected lobe to occlude the segmental airway  after 
biopsy . While this technique has essentially eliminated the risk of life -threatening bleeding after cryobiopsies, 
significant bleeding complications persist and can occasio nally substantially  lengthen the duration of the 
procedure, leading to premature termination and potentially  quantitatively  inadequate biopsy acquisition .  
Conceptually it seems that the ability to select a less vascular area for a somewhat larger cryobiopsy may result 
in decreased risk of hemorrhage and/or reduction in bleeding severity. Average peripheral cryobiopsy size 
varies significantly and may be dependent on freezing time and cryoprobe size10-12. Increase in resource 
utilization due to the use of radial ultrasound could be offset by a decrease in complication rate , decreased 
procedural time  and potentially decreased endobronchial blocker need.  This use of radial probe ultrasound use

has not been widely r eported in literature except for a recent single center retrospective review of 10 patients 
undergoing transbronchial cryobiopsies for ILD (Berim, 2017) . Six of these patients underwent vascular 
localizati on with radial probe endobronchial localization with trends towards less bleeding.  
The purported benefit of radial ultrasound -guided transbronchial cryobiopsy  is the avoidance of excessive 
bleeding , which has been associated with this procedure . With the systematic use of a prophylactic bronchial 
blocker, an ideal endpoint for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_366648] . We propose to 
study in a prospective, double -blind, randomized controlled fashion, the  efficacy of radial endobronchial 
ultrasound  (in combination with fluoroscopy) guided  transbronchial cryobiopsy  as compared to conventional 
fluoroscopy guided cryobiopsy in reducing time needed to achieve hemostasis (primary endpoint) and need for 
addition al modalities to control bleeding and  size of biopsies obtained  (secondary endpoints ).

[ADDRESS_458311] (blinded to biopsy technique) states out loud “Ready for new biopsy”. This 
way the study coordinator will be prompted to stop the stop watch, time recorded and scope will be 
handed back to primary bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_366653].  
15. At the discretion of the operator the process w ill be  repeated in different location in the same lobe to 
achieve up to 4 biopsies.  
 
 
Process of Randomization and Blinding:  
 
1: 1 randomization will be performed with random permuted blocks of 4 to randomize allocation 
between intervention and control arms.  
Each biopsy will be randomly allocated into intervention (radial prob e ultrasound and fluoroscopy 
guided ) and control ( fluoroscopy -guided) groups by o pening an opaque study envelope just prior to 
starting the procedure containing group assignment.  
Patients and Blinding Process  
Patients will be informed that as a part of the trial we plan to obtain 4 cryobiopsies(2 with radial probe 
assistance and 2 wit hout). This is also the same as average number of biopsies we obtain in patients who 
are not a part of this trial as a standard of care. The criteria to stop the procedure earlier if needed are the 
same as those for patients not on this trial.  
Patient will  receive cryobiopsy by [CONTACT_366670], as standard of care.   
Proceduralists and Blinding Process:  
Three proceduralists will be involved in the procedure.  Primary bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_366654] , after the biopsy is determined to be in the control or 
the intervention group.  He/she will also then perfor m the cryobiopsy per protocol. A bedside assistant 
will be assisting in managing the endobronchial blocker at all times. He/she  will inflate the 
endobronchial blocker balloon  as soon as the bronchoscope is removed en -bloc with the cryoprobe .

[ADDRESS_458312] will be stationed outside the bronchoscopy OR during this initial part of the 
procedure  (localization and obtaining cryobiopsy ). He will then be prompted to  enter the room by 
[CONTACT_366671] . Secondary bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541] , will be blinded to 
the use or non-use of radial probe ultrasound for that particular biopsy. Research coordinator will be 
present at all times and will coordinate the switching process between the proceduralists. Attention will 
be paid that the personnel  present in the room do es not mention the use or non -use radial ultrasound 
probe to the secondary bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541] . The reference image of the radial USG determining the biopsy 
location on monitor s will be erased before secondary bron choscopi[INVESTIGATOR_366655].  
Recording of Outcomes  
The time to achieve hemostasis will be recorded with help of a stop watch by [CONTACT_366672] . Stop watch will be turned on from the time bronchoscope and the cryoprobe are removed en 
bloc after obtaining cryobiopsy  and turned off at the time it is determined to be safe to proceed to the next 
cryobiopsy (secondary bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541], blinded to biopsy t echnique states out loud ”Ready for new biopsy”.   
The procedure  can be terminated prematurely , as standard of care,  if any the following occur:  
1. Significant bleeding precluding obtaining further cryobiopsy  
2. Hemodynamic  instability  
3. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_34300]  
4. At the primary bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s discretion  
 
Post-procedure PA/lateral chest radiograph will be performed to assess for development of pneumothorax  as per 
standard of care .  
 
Outcomes:  
Primary endpoint:  
 
1. Time to achieve hemostasis after obtaining cryobiopsy:  
 
This is defined as time from  when the  bronchoscope and cryoprobe are removed en bloc after obtaining the 
cryobiopsy to the time when it is determined to be safe to proceed to next cryobiopsy(“Ready for next biopsy”).  
 
This study is a randomized controlled trial designed to test the hypothesis that the time to achieve hemostasis in 
cryobiopsy performed with additional r adial probe guidance  will be less than th at of cryobiopsy performed  
without radial probe ultrasound localization  of presence of vasculature . The estimated minimal clinically 
important difference is  60 seconds .

All biopsies are currently being independently analyzed as part of our ongoing QI project COOL_HUES 
(IRB# 161260 ). This will allow us to collect following secondary end points:  
 
3. Biopsy specimen quality  
4. Biopsy size  
 
 
Variables recorded:  
• Past medical history  
• Demographic data  
• Smoking histor y

• Laboratory data (complete blood count, electrolytes, creatinine, coagulation profile if available)  
 
Statistical methodology  
Power calculation  
The primary goal of this study is to compare the  performing cryobiopsy with and without use of radial 
ultrasound.   The primary endpoint of the study is time needed for each biopsy.  Without the  use of radial 
ultrasound , we observed time needed for one biopsy (min) of 2  ± 1 (mean ± SD) .  We usually perform 4 
biopsies in each patient  in practice . Thus,  we plan to randomize the biopsies into convention  (without use of 
radial ultr asound)  and intervention arms ( with use of radial ultrasound) within each patient.   Sample size is 
calculated from paired t -test. Compared to the convention arm,  a sample size of 10 patients achieves  80% power 
to detect [ADDRESS_458313] for categorical variables (such as incidences of pneumothorax, 
grade of bleeding )

[ADDRESS_458314] that use of radial ult rasound for additional localization  will result in an increased risk for the 
patient.  
Adverse event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product, 
which does not necessarily have a causal r elationship with the treatment.   
The procedures being performed, transbronchial cryobiopsy with or without radial probe ultrasound guidance  
are standard of care/routine procedures. There are no research procedures post -treatment, and patients will not 
be followed for study purposes.  Only adverse events related to research procedures (the consent process, 
HIPAA compliance, etc.) will be collec ted. PI [INVESTIGATOR_366656], ensure that PHI is protected and 
review all AEs and SAEs and report all SAEs within 5 business days to the IRB . Serious adverse events will be 
recorded as part of the study.  
 
Serious adverse event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event  (SAE)  is an undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition  
which:  
•         is fatal or life -threatening;  
•         requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
•         results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
•         constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or  
•         jeopardizes the participant and requires medical or surgical intervention to  
               prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:  
 
•         routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with  any deterioration in 
condition, or for elective procedures  
•         elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not  worsen  
•         emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria  outlined above and not 
resulting in inpatient admission respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] . 
 
If a massive bleed is encountered after cryobiopsy, the managemen t is initiated with immediate attempt to 
occlude the bleeding airway. Dedicated endobronchial balloon or the bronchoscope itself can be used for this 
purpose. The patient will be  then rotated to a lateral position with bleeding side down. Instillation of i ce-cold 
saline can help in achievement of hemostasis by [CONTACT_366673] -induced vascular constriction.  Selective 
intubation of nonbleeding lung can performed in persistent severe bleeding. Patient can be  referred to 
interventional radiology for localization a nd embolization of the bleeding vessel. Fatality from such hemorrhage 
is extremely rare, however, has been described previously3.

[ADDRESS_458315] of this research, the 
Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (APCCM) Data Safety and Monitorin g Committee (DSMC) 
will be formally asked to review the study and the situation that required DSMC intervention.  
  
Personnel from the APCCM Division will monitor the trial and may periodically visit the investigative site to 
assure proper conduct of the tr ial and proper collection of the data. These monitoring visits may occur remotely 
or on -site. The investigator will allow the monitor to review all source documents used in the preparation of the 
case reports.   
  
Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_366657] (eCRF) are required and will be completed for each included participant. The 
completed dataset will not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives 
of appropriate Health/Regulatory Auth orities, without written permission from Vanderbilt, per the clinical trial 
agreement and patient signed informed consent.  
  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from health authorities and Vanderbilt, the investigator agrees to keep 
records including: The identity of all participants (sufficient information to link records; e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), 
all original signed informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_129299], and detailed records of drug 
disposition. The records should be retain ed by [CONTACT_129332].  
  
During data entry, range and missing data checks will be automated through REDCap (when appropriate and 
able). The checks to be performed will be documented in the Data Monitoring Plan for the study.  Corrections 
will be made by [CONTACT_3991]. This will be done on an ongoing basis.  
 
 
General design of the study  
See CONSOR diagram / flow chart at tached .  
 
Data Collection:  
Data will be collected using a centralized electronic case report form called REDCap, currently locatable 
at:https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/ .  REDCap is a highly secure, web based, reaserch spec ific, and customizable

system that provides HIPPA complaint and study administration capabilities. The system is capable of storing 
basic protocol information (e.g. IRB approval dates, dates for annual renewals) and clinical trials research data, 
and it fu lly integrates study administration functionality including protocol tracking, patient registration, review 
committee tracking, and SAE tracking, with clinical data management functionality including electronic case 
report forms (eCRF) design, clinical dat a capture, protocol and regulatory compliance monitoring.  
REDCap allows the investigator to define specific protocol requirements and generate data collection forms. 
REDCap permits specification of study protocols, management of patient enrollment, clinica l data entry and 
viewing, and the generation of patient or study -specific reports based on time stampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. REDCap provides 
several reporting features specifically addressing the reporting requirements needed for the DSMC. Data may 
also be exported in a form at suitable for import into another database, spreadsheets or analysis 
systems.   REDCap is maintained and supported by [CONTACT_202998].  
 
Risks  
 
Complications of transbronch ial cryobiopsy  have been reported with variable incidence in se veral case series. 
According to recently reported experience at Vanderbilt Medical Center , main complications include 
pneumothorax (approximately 3%), bleeding ( 3-5%) and re spi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]  (2%). These are standard 
complications of the procedure and we do not expect that  using radial ultrasonography  additionally for 
localization  will be associated with an increased rate of complications given the available data.  
 
Benefits  
 
There is no guarantee that the subjects will receive any benefit from this study.  
 
Payment and Remuneration  
 
Subjects will not be paid to participate in the study.  
 
Costs  
 
There will be no additional costs to subjects for participating in this study. Subj ects and/or their insurance 
companies will be responsible for all care provided as part of the diagnostic transbronchial crybiopsy  as this 
service is part of the standard of care they would receive for their condition.

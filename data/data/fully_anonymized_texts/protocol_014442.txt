Background and Rationale   6.1 Glucose Spi[INVESTIGATOR_501839]. The pancreas works to stabilize blood sugar levels by [CONTACT_501850] a surge of insulin to help move glucose into our cells or storage. However, even after excess glucose has been cleared, our insulin levels remain high. This leads to an overcorrection and subsequent low blood sugar. Unstable blood sugar is linked to depressed and anxious mood, “brain fog,” impaired cognitive performance, disturbed sleep, chronic pain, and poor workout performance. Conversely, stable blood sugar can boost our energy levels, mood, productivity, and overall well-being.2  Glucose variability is not only a problem for individuals with diagnosed health conditions relating to glucose. According to a 2018 study, “[ADDRESS_646613]-meal glucose spi[INVESTIGATOR_501840] 15 percent of the time”3. Additionally, a [ADDRESS_646614] of chronic conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney failure, cancer, retina damage, and cognitive decline. Eating to promote stable blood sugar and developi[INVESTIGATOR_501841]-term health and wellbeing5.   6.2 Canagliflozin Canagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor. It is a compound also known under the name [CONTACT_501871]. Canagliflozin is used (with diet and other medications) to treat type 2 diabetes (a condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Canagliflozin works by [CONTACT_501851]2, a protein that helps the body reabsorb glucose from urine to the bloodstream. The body instead excretes glucose through urine. 1   Clinical studies Canagliflozin Tablets were studied as monotherapy and as combination therapy to metformin, insulin, or other treatments. The treatment effects on HbA1c levels and one-hour postprandial glucose levels are summarized for four placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized studies conducted in the [LOCATION_002]. The placebo-subtracted treatment differences, which are summarized below, were statistically significant for both variables in all of these studies.  Study 1: (n=584) This study showed that canagliflozin caused a significant reduction in blood sugar soon after taking canagliflozin. This was true at both doses of 100 mg canagliflozin as well as with 300 mg of canagliflozin. Hba1c levels dropped by 0.8 mg/dl with the 100 mg treatment and by 1.0 mg/dl with the 300 mg treatment. 1  Study 2: (n=20) Canagliflozin reduced postprandial plasma glucose by 35% and insulin excursions by 43% in this study (P < 0.001 for both). It also increased urinary glucose excretion (UGE0–6h, 18.2 ± 5.6 vs. <0.2 g; P < 0.001). It reduced blood glucose by [CONTACT_501852]. 6  Study 3: (n=1450) Canagliflozin at 100 mg and 300 mg reduced A1c levels by −0.65% and −0.74%, respectively, over a treatment period of 104 weeks. Also, it reduced systolic blood pressure by -2.0 mmHg with the 100 mg dose and by -3.1 mmHg with the 300 mg dose. 7

Adverse events related to the kidneys were lower with canagliflozin treatment of [ADDRESS_646615] normally-functioning glucose disposal, or stay well hydrated by [CONTACT_501853].10 Glucose spi[INVESTIGATOR_501842], and are common in healthy, non-diabetic individuals after high carbohydrate intake.  6.4 Rationale and Hypothesis  Canagliflozin is a prime candidate to reduce glucose spi[INVESTIGATOR_501843]. It has consistently acted to treat type 2 diabetes and has been shown to improve biomarkers such as fasted glucose and glucose spi[INVESTIGATOR_2988].  The current FDA-approved use of the drug is for use together with diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. Canagliflozin is sometimes used in combination with insulin or other diabetes medications taken orally. It is routinely prescribed at equal or higher doses than the ones proposed in this trial.  AgelessRx Trial doses: 100 mg and 150 mg doses, taken every day and every-other day, respectively.  FDA-approved dose: Maximum recommended dose: [ADDRESS_646616] potential for some side effects, though the drug is generally well tolerated.  This trial will use a lower dose than the maximum one recommended by [CONTACT_1622]. We are using a maximum of 150 mg in one day vs the maximum of 300 mg each day recommended by [CONTACT_1622]. At this smaller dose, side effects are less common8. This dose has been shown to be generally safe.  Our hypothesis is three-fold: 1. Canagliflozin can be used safely and is well tolerated at doses of 100 mg per day or 150 mg every two days in healthy, non-diabetic individuals.  2. Usage of canagliflozin at these doses can effectively reduce glucose spi[INVESTIGATOR_2988] (and their detrimental effects) and blood sugar levels measured by [CONTACT_501854] a healthy population.  3. Usage on alternate days will be effective as measured by [CONTACT_501855].  7. Objectives  7.1 Primary Objective To measure the effects that Canagliflozin intervention has on blood glucose at the tested doses. This will be measured by [CONTACT_501856][INVESTIGATOR_501844] a high-carbohydrate meal at the tested doses, as well as by [CONTACT_501857].

The volunteers can be within 18-85 years of age at the time of enrollment. Participants will provide informed consent via AgelessRx EMR. If eligible, prescriptions will be provided online through the AgelessRx website (www.agelessrx.com). Participants will be randomized into two arms: Arm A will take 100 mg of canagliflozin each day for a total of 7 doses, while Arm B will take 150 mg of canagliflozin every other day for a total of 4 doses. Participants in Arm B will also be provided a pi[INVESTIGATOR_501845] 300mg tablet. All participants will begin the trial on the day that they apply a continuous glucose monitor (considered Day 0) and will be asked to take daily blood pressure reading. After one week of baseline readings, both arms will start their canagliflozin dosing protocols. Participants will be asked to complete 7 total surveys to outline side effects and tolerability, one each day starting after their canagliflozin consumption. Participants will be asked to complete a dietary intake journal through Day 0 – Day 14. Lifesum (https://lifesum.com/) should be used to track Carbohydrate/Protein/Fat consumption. Participants will share their dietary intake journal twice over their participation (Day 7 & Day 14).   8.[ADDRESS_646617]. Sajad Zalzala via the AgelessRx website (www.agelessrx.com).

It is known under the name [CONTACT_501871], when mixed with other compounds. It is chemically known as (2S,3R,4R,5S,6R)-2-[3-[[5-(4-fluorophenyl)thiophen-2-yl]methyl] -4-methylphenyl]-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxane-3,4,5-triol. It has a molecular weight of 444.52 g/mol and is an off-white powder. It is used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (a condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). It works by [CONTACT_61670] a sodium-glucose pump in the kidneys, SGLT2, leading to increased glucose excretion through urine. This helps reduce blood glucose levels as glucose is not reabsorbed into the blood.  11.[ADDRESS_646621] from heat and light.

These guidelines were based on the World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Helsinki, adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, in Jun, 1964; and amended by [CONTACT_941]:  29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_646628] WMA General Assembly, Washington DC, [LOCATION_003], October 2002 (Note of Clarification added) 55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 2004 (Note of Clarification added) 59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Republic of Korea, October 2008 64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013  Preamble  1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable human material and data.  The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians. The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.  General Principles  3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient’s best interest when providing medical care.”  4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well-being and rights of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician’s knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.  5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subjects.  6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proven interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human subjects and protect their health and rights.  8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.  9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self-determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though they have given consent.

All vulnerable groups and individuals should receive specifically considered protection.  20. Medical research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the research is responsive to the health needs or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a non-vulnerable group. In addition, this group should stand to benefit from the knowledge, practices or interventions that result from the research.  Scientific Requirements and Research Protocols

Protocol Number: ALRx008                      Approval Date: Jan. 24, 2024 Approval Number: IRCM-2024-384              Continuing Review Date: Jan. 8, [ADDRESS_646630], incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study.  In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post-trial provisions.  Research Ethics Committees  23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence and must be duly qualified. It must take into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by [CONTACT_942]. After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions.  Privacy and Confidentiality  24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of their personal information.  Informed Consent  25. Participation by [CONTACT_208724]. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees.  26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, post study provisions and any other relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention should be given to the specific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information.  After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non-written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the general outcome and results of the study.

Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research group. In such circumstances the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorised representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research must be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorised representative. 31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study must never adversely affect the patient- physician relationship.  32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where consent would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  Use of Placebo  33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances: Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or  Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention  and the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of not receiving the best proven intervention.  Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  Post-Trial Provisions  34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should make provisions for post-trial access for all participants who still need an intervention identified as beneficial in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to participants during the informed consent process.  Research Registration and Publication and Dissemination of Results

This intervention should subsequently be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

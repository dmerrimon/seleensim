Dosage calculations for the Erchonia® FX -635™  
 
Equations :  
1) Intensity = W/cm2  
2) Dosage = (J/cm2)=(W/cm2) x τ(s)  
3) Oval Surface area = π x (r1/2) x (r2/2)  
MW = miliwatts  
W= Watts  
 
Intensity:  
Intensity ÷ oval surface area = intensity at tissue  
1) 17.5 mW / 1000 = 0.0175 W (Intensity conversion from mW to W)  
2) π x (9cm/2) x (9.5cm/2) = 21.375 cm2 (surface area o f treated region at single diode at 
3.5” above the skin surface.  
3) 0.0175 / 21.375 cm2 = 8.2 x10 -4 W/cm2 (intensity for single diode at skin)  
4) 8.2 x 10 -4 W/cm2 x (3 diodes) = 2.46 x10 -3 W/cm2 (intensity for all 3 diodes combined at the 
skin)

STATISTICS  
Around $[ADDRESS_315141] common 
neurological ailment in the [LOCATION_002] , second only to headache.  
 
Over a lifetime, 80% of people have lower back pain,  with 26% of American adults reporting pain of 
at least one day in duration every three months. 41% of adults aged between [ADDRESS_315142] frequently between ages 30 and 50, due in part to the aging process but also as a result of 
sedentary life sty les with too little (sometimes punctuated by [CONTACT_259276]) exercise.  
 
DESCRIPTION  & DEFINITION  
Low back pain  is a common musculoskeletal disorder affecting 80% of people at some point in their 
lives.  
 
➢ Anatomy of the back  
The lumbar region (lower back region) is comprised  of five 
vertebrae (L1 -L5). In between these vertebrae lie 
fibrocartilage discs (interverteb ral discs), which act as 
cushions, preventing the vertebrae from rubbing together 
while at the same time protecting the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. Nerves 
stem from the spi[INVESTIGATOR_259212], providing muscles with snsations and motor 
associat ed messages. Stability of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_259213], lower back 
and abdomen. Small joints which prevent, as well as 
direct, motion of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_259214] 
(zygapophysial joints) . 
 
➢ Etiologies of low back pain  
The vast majority of low back pain (with many estimates as high as 99% incidence) stems from 
benign musculoskeletal problems, referred to as non-specific low back pain  (meaning that the  
precise cause can be difficult to determine ) – the etiology being evaluated in this study . It is caused 
by [CONTACT_259277]  a stretch injury to the ligaments, tendons, and/or muscles of the low 
back. The stretching incident results in microscopic tears of varying degrees in the  soft tissues  of 
the lower back . The injury can occur because of overuse, improper use or trauma.  A diagnosis of 
nonspecific low back pain occurs in the absence of any serious underlying pathology or nerve root 
compromise.  
 
Other etiologies of low back pain that are no t being evaluated in this study include  the following:  
✓ Mechanical: Apophyseal osteoarthritis ; diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis ; degenerative 
discs ; Scheuermann's kyphosis ; s ("slipped disc") ; thoracic or lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078] ; 

Erchonia® FX -635™ Low Back Pain Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 4.2       Page 10  January 7,  2017 spondylolisthesis and other congenital abnormalities ; fractures ; leg length difference ; restricted 
hip motion ; misaligned pelvis - pelvic obliquity ; anteversion or retroversion ; and a bnormal foot 
pronation  
✓ Inflammatory: Seronegative spondylarthritides (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis) ; rheumatoid arthritis ; 
infection - epi[INVESTIGATOR_259215]  
✓ Neoplastic: bone tumors (primary or metastatic) ; and intradural spi[INVESTIGATOR_158314]  
✓ Metabolic: osteoporotic fractures ; osteomalacia ; ochronosis ; and c hondrocalcinosis .  
✓ Psychosomatic : Tension myositis syndrome  
✓ Paget's disease  
✓ Referred pain: Pelvic/abdominal disease ; prostate cancer ; and p osture  
✓ Depression  
✓ Oxygen deprivation  
 
➢ Classification of  low back pain  
 
✓ Acute  low back pain  generally lasts from a few days to less than 4  weeks.  
✓ Sub-acute low back pain  lasts 4 -12 weeks  
✓ Chronic  low back pain  is defined as pain  in the lower back region  that persists for more than 
3 months . It is often progressi ve, and the cause is typi[INVESTIGATOR_259216] -specific in 
nature; that is, the cause can be difficult to determine.  
 
➢ Presentation of  low back pain  
Lumbar sprain strain is characterized by [CONTACT_259278]. The severity of the injury  can range from 
mild to severe, depending on the degree of strain and resulting s pasm of the muscles of the low 
back.  
 
➢ Diagnosis  
 
Diagnosis of low back pain  
Medical history and physical exam can usually identify any dangerous conditions or family history 
that may be associated with the low back pain. Factors such as  the onset, site, and severity of the 
pain; duration of symptoms and any limitations in movement;  and history of previous epi[INVESTIGATOR_259217] . The physician will examine 
the back and conduct neurologic tests to determine the cause of pain and appropriate treatment. 
Blood tests and imaging tests may be performed  to rule out more serious sources of the pain such 
as tumors.  
 
Diagnostic methods available to confirm the cause of low back pain  include:  
✓ X-ray imaging  to look  for broken bones or an injured vertebra. Tissue masses such as injured 
muscles and ligaments or painful conditions such as a bulging disc are not visible on 
conventional x -rays.  
✓ Computerized tomography (CT)  is used when disc rupture, spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078], or damage to 
vertebrae is suspected as a cause of low back pain.  
✓ Magnetic r esonance imaging (MRI)  is used to evaluate the lumbar region for bone degeneration 
or injury or disease in tissues and nerves, muscles, ligaments, and blood vessels.  
✓ Electrodiagnostic procedures  include electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction studies, and 
evoked potential (EP) studies  to assess the electrical activity in a nerve to detect if muscle 
weakness results from injury or a problem with the nerves that control the muscles.

Version 4.2       Page 11  January 7,  2017 CURRENT THER APEUTIC APPROACHES TO THE MANAGEMENT OF EPI[INVESTIGATOR_259218]: 
 
✓ resting  the back to avoid reinjury,  
✓ medications  to relieve pain and muscle spasm  such as o ver-the-counter analgesics , including 
NSAIDs (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], naproxen, and ibuprofen) to reduce stiffness, swelling, and inflammation and 
to ease mild to moderate low back pain; c ounter -irritants  applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_259219] a cream 
or spray stimulate the nerve endings in the skin to provide feelings of warmth or cold and dull 
the sense of pain, and to reduce inflammation and stimulate blood flow; a nticonvulsants  which 
may be u seful in treating certain types of nerve pain; some antidepressants , particularly tricyclic 
antidepressants such as amitriptyline and desipramine; o pi[INVESTIGATOR_259220], oxycodone, 
hydrocodone, and morphine  
✓ local heat  applications  
✓ massage , and  
✓ reconditi oning exercises  to strengthen the low back and abdominal muscles after healing.  
✓ Spi[INVESTIGATOR_259221], alternative  options  are 
available, such as : 
 
✓ Acupuncture . It is believe d this process trig gers the release of naturally occurring painkilling 
molecules called peptides and keeps the body’s normal flow of energy unblocked.  
✓ Biofeedback  is used to help the  patient learn to effect a change in his or her response to pain, 
for example, by [CONTACT_259279].  
✓ Traction  involves the use of weights to apply constant or intermittent force to gradually “pull” the 
skeletal structure into better alignment.  
✓ Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) : TENS may also help stimulate the brain’s 
production of endorphins (chemicals that have pain -relieving properties).  
✓ Ultrasound  is used to warm the body’s internal tissues, caus ing the  muscles to relax. Sound 
waves pass through the skin and into the injure d muscles and other soft tissues.  
 
Alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_259222] -effects compared with traditional treatments, especially medications . 
 
Surgical procedures are also a treatment option for low back pain. However, the outcomes are often 
poor and not lasting ; yet still, back operations are the 3rd most common form of surgery in the 
United State s, with about 300,000 back surgeries performed annually in  the U.S.

Version 4.2       Page 12  January 7,  2017 THEORY OF MECHANISM OF OPERATION OF THE APPLICATION OF LOW LEVEL LASER 
LIGHT USING THE ERCHONIA® FX-635™  TO PROVIDE TEMPORARY ACUTE RELIEF OF 
MINOR EPI[INVESTIGATOR_259223] 1916.  
The biological effects of low -level laser therapy (LLLT) have been studied for forty years all around 
the globe, and no unwanted side effects have been noted  anywhere . The safety record is strong .  
 
All the cells in the body have receptors on their cell membranes that are able to read different 
frequencies of energy contained in the electromagnetic spectrum. This spectrum includes 
ultraviolet, infrared, and vi sible light. Soft (low -level) lasers produce visible and infrared light. The 
different frequencies of light communicate information to the cells that is understood by [CONTACT_259280]’s mitochondrion  (the 
enzymatic engine of the cell). This energetic information eventually reaches the cell’s DNA, which 
directly controls cell function.  
 
When the cells are able to receive better information, they work better. When cells function better 
so do the tissues  that they comprise, like bones, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, etc. In this way , 
LLLT promotes the healing and regeneration of damaged tissues. The energy from soft lasers is 
able to affect every tissue and system in  the body. Scientists have shown that s oft laser light is able 
to penetrate into the body; research has demonstrated that it has both local effects on tissue 
function and also systemic effects that are carried through out the body by [CONTACT_259281] p ossibly 
also by [CONTACT_259282] . 
 
The key  basic physiological effects of low level laser light include:  
 
1) increased cell membrane polarization and permeability  
2) increased ATP production and respi[INVESTIGATOR_259224]  
3) increased enzyme activity  
4) increased collagen and epi[INVESTIGATOR_259225]  
5) increased capi[INVESTIGATOR_131725]  
6) increased macrophage (immune) activity  
7) analgesic effects due to elevated endorphin production, electrolytic nerve blockage, and 
improved blood and lymph flow  
8) anti -inflammatory effect due to improved circulation an d accelerated tissue regeneration; and 9) 
increased production of antioxidants.  
 
Of additional benefit is that light energy from low level lasers will only be absorbed by [CONTACT_259283]. Soft lase r light has no effect on healthy 
cells.

Version 4.2       Page 14  January 7,  2017 ➢ Tri-length  laser  therapy associated to tecar therapy in the treatment of  low-back  pain in 
adults: a preliminary report of a prospective case series.  
Osti R, Pari C,  Salvatori G,  Massari L.  
Lasers  Med Sci.  2015 Jan;30(1):407 -12.  
 
Low-back  pain is very frequent, especially in active adult population. There are several different 
orthopaedic condition that can cause  low-back  pain, and the pain worsen the qual ity of life 
significantly. The treatments vary from drugs, physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], kinesiology, local infiltrations, and 
so on.Laser  therapy has an important role in the treatment of the inflammatory causes of pain, with 
several studies that demonstrate the ef ficacy of  low and high energy  laser  therapy in the treatment 
of low-back  pain. Sixty -six consecutive patients with  low-back  pain with or without leg pain were 
treated using a combination of Tri -length  laser  I-Triax® (Mectronic Medicale, Bergamo, Italy) and  
Pharon® tecar therapy (Mectronic Medicale, Bergamo, Italy). The patients were treated three times 
a week, every other day, for a total of 10 sessions. Clinical results were evaluated using visual 
analogic scale for individual pain (0 to 10) and the Oswest ry disability scale (ODS). Tests started 
before the beginning of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265] 8 weeks after the end of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Visual analogic scale 
(VAS) score significantly improved from an average value of 8.1 ± 1.[ADDRESS_315144]-treatment of 2.63 ± 2.74 (P < .01). ODS values start from a pre -treatment 
average value of 53.0 ± 13.[ADDRESS_315145] -treatment average value of 23.5 ± 19.8 (P < .01). A higher 
improvement both in VAS and in ODS was denoted in the group of patient with  low-back pain and 
leg pain (respectively, VAS from 8.66 ± 1.58 to 2.86 ± 2.94 and ODS from 57.8 ± 15.5 to 
23.7 ± 19.5).  Low-back  pain, associated or not with leg pain, is a very common clinical situation. 
The treatments of this condition are different, and an i mportant role can be given to 
the laser  therapy. The conclusion of this study is that the association between  laser  therapy 
iLux-Triax® and tecar therapy Pharon® in the treatment of  low-back  pain, with or without leg 
pain, can significantly reduce pain and  improve the quality of life in patients with

Photomed  Laser  Surg.  2014 Sep;32(9):490 -4.  
 
BACKGROUND DATA : Low back  pain is a common, highly debilitating condition, whose severity 
is variable. This study evaluated the efficacy of treatment with Ga -Al-As  diode laser  (980 nm) with 
a large diameter spot (32 cm(2)), in association with exercise therapy, in reducing pain.  
 
OBJECTIVE : The present study aimed to evaluate the pain reduction efficacy of treatment with the 
Ga-Al-As diode  laser  (980 nm) in com bination with exercise therapy, in patients with 
chronic  low back  pain (CLBP).  
 
METHODS : This study evaluated 100 patients with CLBP (mean age 60 years) who were randomly 
assigned to two groups. The  laser  plus exercises group (Laser+EX: 50 patients) received  low-
level laser  therapy (LLLT) with a diode  laser, 980 nm, with a specific handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] [32 cm(2) 
irradiation spot size, power [ADDRESS_315146] (CW), fluence 37.5J/cm(2), total energy per 
point 1200 J] thrice weekly, and followed a d aily exercise schedule for 3 weeks (5 days/week). The 
exercises group (EX: 50 patients) received placebo  laser  therapy plus daily exercises. The 
outcome was evaluated on the visual analogue pain scale (VAS), before and after treatment.  
RESULTS : At the end of the 3 week period, the  Laser+EX group showed a significantly 
greater decrease in pain than did the EX group.  There was a significant difference between the 
Erchonia® FX -635™ Low Back Pain Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 4.2       Page 15  January 7,  2017 two groups, with average Δ VAS scores of 3.96 (Laser+EX group) and 2.23 (EX group). The 
Student's  t test demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the two groups, at 
p<0.001.  
 
CONCLUSIONS : This study demonstrated that the use of diode  laser  (980 nm) with large 
diameter spot size, in association with exercise therapy, appears to be ef fective . Such 
treatment might be considered a valid therapeutic option within rehabilitation programs for 
nonspecific CLBP.

➢ Short -term therapeutic effects of 890 -nanometer light therapy for chronic  low back  pain: 
a double -blind randomized placebo -controlled study.  
Hsieh RL,  Lee WC.  
Lasers  Med Sci.  2014 Mar;29(2):671 -9.  
 
We conducted a double -blind randomized placebo -controlled study to investigate the effects of 
short -term 890 -nm light therapy in patients with chronic  low back  pain in a rehabilitation clinic. 
Thirty -eight women and 22 men with chronic  low back  pain (mean age, 60.3  years; range, 32 -
80 years) received 40 -min sessions of hot -pack therapy combined with active or placebo 890 -nm 
light therapy (wavelen gth = 890  nm, radiant power output = 6.24  W, power density = 34.7  mW/cm(2) 
for 40  min, total energy = 83.2  J/cm(2)) over the lower  back  three times weekly for 2  weeks. 
Participants were assessed before and after treatment by [CONTACT_2329] a range of motion measure ments, 
a visual analog scale evaluation of pain, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, the Biodex Stability 
System, the Fear -Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, repeated chair -rising times, the Frenchay 
Activity Index, the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ), and the Osteoarthritis Quality of Life 
Questionnaire. The severity of disability based on the ODQ score was used as the primary clinical 
outcome measurement. Compared to the baseline measurements, participants in the treatment 
group reported signifi cant reductions in fear -avoidance beliefs regarding physical activity 
(P = 0.040) and work (P = 0.007) and in the severity of disability (P = 0.021). Treatment with hot -
pack therapy and 890 -nm light therapy was associated with reductions in the severity of  
disability and fear avoidance beliefs in patients with chronic  low back  pain.

Laser  Ther.  2012 Sep 30;21(3):193 -7.  
 
BACKGROUND AND AIMS : In previous studies we have reported the benefits of  low level laser 
therapy  (LLLT) for chronic shoulder joint  pain, elbow, hand and finger  pain, and  low back pain. The 
present study is a report on the effects of LLLT for chronic neck  pain.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHOD S: Over a [ADDRESS_315147], 20.1 J/cm(2)/point, and three shots were given per session (1 treatment) with twice a week 
for 4 weeks.  
RESULTS : 1. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to determine the effects  of LLLT for 
chronic  pain and after the end of the treatment regimen a significant improvement was observed 
(p<0.001). 2. After treatment, no significant differences in cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_259233]® FX -635™ Low Back Pain Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 4.2       Page 16  January 7,  2017 observed. 3. Discussions with the patients revealed  that in order to receive continued benefits from 
treatment, it was important for them to be taught how to avoid postures that would cause them 
neck  pain in everyday life.  
 
CONCLUSION : The present study demonstrates that LLLT was an effective form of treat ment 
for neck and  back  pain caused by [CONTACT_259284], reinforced by [CONTACT_259285] .

➢ Low power laser in the treatment of the acute low back pain  
Mandić M, Rancié N.  
Vojnosanit  Pregl. 2011 Jan;68(1):57 -61. 
 
BACKGROUND/AIM: Acute low back pain (ALBP) is one of the most frequent painful conditions in 
the human population. The objective of the paper was to compare the efficacy of the low power 
laser (LPL) in the pain and the muscul ar spasm reduction with conservative methods of physical 
medicine.  
 
METHOD: The prospective cohort study involved 70 patients, men and women, from 25 to 64 years 
of age with the diagnosis of ALBP. There were t wo groups: [ADDRESS_315148] with frequency of 73 Hz. The second group was the control group, and it consisted of 
30 patients treated with conservative methods of physical medicine (electrotherapy: diadynamic 
currents CP +/ - 3 and CP +/ - 3, interferent currents --90 Hz for 15 min; electrophoresis with 
novocaine). The ALBP were diagnosed by [CONTACT_259286] (NMRI). The low power laser --Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) was used. The laser device 
consisted of 4 laser diodes, each p owered of 15 mW, wavelength 904 nm and with frequency 73 
Hz. The total period of time for each treatment was 10 minutes and the total dose per treatment 
was 15 J. The intensity of acute low back pain was assessed by [CONTACT_259287]'s scale. The degree of the 
spasm was assessed in the relaxed position and during movements.  
 
RESULTS: The average score in the first group before the onset of rehabilitation was 3.3 +/ - 1.1 
(Me = 3.0), and in the control group, it was 3.43 +/ - 0.89 (Me = 3.0). After five treatments, in patients 
who were treated with LPL, the average Roland's scale score decreased (1.12 +/ - 1.3, Me = 2.0) 
while there was no change for scores in the control group. After [ADDRESS_315149] was obtained in 82.5% o f patients from the test group and in 20% of patients in the 
control group. The analgesic effect in patients of the test group was obtained after 7.5 +/ - 2.1 
treatments and in the second group after 17.9 +/ - 3.2 treatments. The difference was statistically  
significant (t = 15.652173, p < 0.001). The spasm disappeared in 92.5% of patients in the test group 
and in 20% of patients in the control group after 7.02 +/ - 2.2 and 17.9 +/ - 3.2 treatments respectively. 
The difference was statistically significant (t =  15.652173, p < 0.001).  
 
CONCLUSION: Pain and spasm reduction were obtained in the greater number of patients 
by [CONTACT_259288].

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether low power 
laser therapy (Gallium -Arsenide) is useful or not for the therapy of chronic low back pain (LBP).  
 
STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 75 patients (laser + exercise -
25, laser alone -25, and exercise alone -25) with LBP. Visual analogue scale (VAS), Sch ober test, 
flexion and lateral flexion measures, Roland Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) and Modified Oswestry 
Disability Questionnaire (MODQ) were used in the clinical and functional evaluations pre and post 
therapeutically. A physician, who was not aware o f the therapy undertaken, evaluated the patients.  
 
RESULTS: Significant improvements were noted in all groups with respect to all outcome 
parameters, except lateral flexion (P < 0.05).  
 
CONCLUSIONS: Low power laser therapy seemed to be an effective method in reducing pain 
and functional disability in the therapy of chronic LBP .

Aust J Physiother . 2007;53(3):155 -60. 
 
QUESTION: Is low level laser therapy an effective adjuvant intervention for chronic low back pain . 
 
DESIGN: Randomized trial with concealed allocation, blinded assessors and intent -to-treat 
analysis.  
 
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty -one patients who had low back pain for at least 12 weeks.  
 
INTERVENTION: One group received laser therapy alone, one received laser therapy and exercise, 
and the thi rd group received placebo laser therapy and exercise. Laser therapy was performed 
twice a week for 6 weeks.  
 
OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were pain severity measured using a [ADDRESS_315150] and maximum active fl exion, extension and lateral 
flexion, and disability measured with the Oswestry Disability Index on admission to the study, after 
6 weeks of intervention, and after another 6 weeks of no intervention.  
 
RESULTS: I n the laser therapy + exercise group, pain d ecreased by 1.8 cm (95% CI 0.1 to 3.3, p 
= 0.03), lumbar range of movement increased by 0.9 cm (95% CI 0.2 to 1.8, p < 0.01) on the 
Schober Test and by 15 deg (95% CI 5 to 25, p < 0.01) of active flexion, and disability reduced by 
9.4 points (95% CI 2.7 to  16.0, p = 0.03) more than in the exercise group at 12 weeks.  
 
CONCLUSION : In chronic low back pain low level laser therapy combined with exercise is 
more beneficial than exercise alone in the long term.

OBJECTIVE:  The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical effects of low -level laser therapy 
(LLLT) in patients with acute low back pain (LBP) with radiculopathy.  
 
BACKGROUND DATA:  Acute LBP with radiculopathy is associated with pain and disability and the 
important pathogenic role of inflammation. LLLT has shown significant anti -inflammatory effects in 
many studies.  
 
MATERIALS & METHODS:  A randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial was performed on 
546 patients. Group A (182 patients) was treated wit h nimesulide 200 mg/day and additionally with 
active LLLT; group B (182 patients) was treated only with nimesulide; and group C (182 patients) 
was treated with nimesulide and placebo LLLT. LLLT was applied behind the involved spi[INVESTIGATOR_259234] a stationa ry skin -contact [INVESTIGATOR_12183]. Patients were treated 5 times weekly, for a total 
of 15 treatments, with the following parameters: wavelength 904 nm; frequency 5000 Hz; 100 -mW 
average diode power; power density of 20 mW/cm(2) and dose of 3 J/cm(2); treatment time 150 
sec at whole doses of 12 J/cm(2). The outcomes were pain intensity measured with a visual analog 
scale (VAS); lumbar movement, with a modified Schober test; pain disability, with Oswestry 
disability score; and quality of life, with a 12 -item short -form health survey questionnaire (SF -12). 
Subjects were evaluated before and after treatment. Statistical analyses were done with SPSS 
11.5.  
 
RESULTS:  Statistically significant differences were found in all outcomes measured (p < 0.001), 
but were larger in gr oup A than in B (p < 0.0005) and C (p < 0.0005). The results in group C were 
better than in group B (p < 0.0005). Conclusions: The results of this study show better 
improvement in acute LBP treated with LLLT used as additional therapy .

BACKGROUND:  Class IV laser therapy is a recent modality used to treat pain and promote healing 
of muscular tissue. The procedure is minimally invasive and easily performed. Laser therapy was 
added to conventional chiropractic treatment of spi[INVESTIGATOR_259236]. The objective of this investigatio n was to assess efficacy and safety 
of the combination and generate preliminary results for a randomized controlled trial.  
 
METHODS:  Between 9/2009 and 2/2010, a total of 55 patients with non -surgical lower back pain 
(sciatica) presented to my office and g ave consent for treatment. Twenty -four patients with back 
pain received spi[INVESTIGATOR_259237]. Twenty -one 
patients (historical controls) received spi[INVESTIGATOR_259238]. All pati ents 
completed VAS scales before treatment (VAS0), at one week (VAS1), and at four weeks (VAS4). 
Regardless of treatment group, all patients received a personalized regimen of spi[INVESTIGATOR_197974], 
manual therapy, and exercise, under the direction of the pr incipal investigator (LDM). Percent 
difference between VAS0 and VAS4 was compared between groups.  
 
Erchonia® FX -635™ Low Back Pain Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 4.2       Page 19  January 7,  2017 RESULTS:  Demographics were similar for both groups (Table 1). Patients in the manipulation + 
laser group reported pain relief after 2 -3 sessions of laser the rapy (clinical observation). No adverse 
events were noted following laser therapy . 
 
A positive -valued percent differences of VAS between pretreatment and 4wk points; indicate that a 
quantitative reduction in pain by [CONTACT_259289]. Statistical comparison of the groups using 
an unpaired t -test indicated that the manipulation + laser offers greater pain reduction when 
compared to manipulation only (p=0.007). Interval estimates indicate a 21.18 larger reduction in 
VAS (95% Confidence In terval: 6.00, 36.35) in the manipulation + laser group.  
 
Conclusions:  These results indicate that both treatments successfully reduced the VAS by [CONTACT_259290], and that a higher reduction in VAS occurred in the group treated by 
[CONTACT_259291]  + laser at week four.  
 
In summary, Class IV laser therapy is a safe and effective modality for treating low back pain 
when added to conventional treatment of manipulation and exercise .

Hegyi Gabriella. Albert Szent -Gyorgyi Medical University, Szeged, Hungary  
INTRODUCTION:  Conventional and complimentary medicine offer numerous possibilities for 
reduction or elimination of chronic pain. In a large majority of cases, convent ional therapy affords a 
satisfactory result. In a significant number of subjects however, the improvement is not appropriate. 
The present work has the aim of demonstrating the opportunities provided by [CONTACT_259292], ac upuncture. This report summarizes the results attained by 
[CONTACT_259293] -therapy. METHODS:  90 patients with chronic pain 
in the low back took part in the study. They received laser -acupuncture treatment administrated to 
acupuncture points in the ear and in the body that corresponded to the principles of traditional 
Chinese medicine. The instrumental parameters, applied: Seirin laser pen Ga A, As diode, 780nm 
laser category 3B, 5mW, 10Hz. RESULTS and CONCLUSIONS:  Prior to th e acupuncture 
treatment, these [ADDRESS_315151] not observed 
recurrence of the pain.  These results demonstrate that lasting freedom from pain can be attained 
in cases, which do not respond to conventional therapy. At the same time, it draws attention to the 
necessity of the application of modern imaging procedures in  order to make an accurate diagnosis 
in those subjects who do not improve satisfactorily.”

"There are also very promising 'trigger points", i.e. myo facial zones of particular sensibility and of 
highest projection of pain focal points, due to ischaemic conditions. The effect of LLLT and the 
results obtained after clinical treatment of more than 200 patients (headaches, facial pain, skeletal

low back and radicular pain , Achilles tendonitis) to whom "trigger points" were applied turned out 
to be better than we have ever expected. According to clinical parameters , it has been observed 
that the rigidity decreases, the mobility is restored and that also the spontaneous or induced pain 
decreases or even disappears. LLLT improves microcirculation and it can also improve oxygen 
supply. Results  measured according to VAS /VRS/PTM: acute pain diminished by 72% and 
chronic pain by 66%. ”

SUBJECT GROUPS  
 
Each subject will be randomized to the test procedure group or to the placebo procedure gro up, as 
follows:  
 
Test procedure group : Subjects randomized to the test procedure group will receive  the study 
procedures with the active (true) Erchonia® FX-635™  laser .  
 
Control procedure group : Subjects randomized to the control procedure group will receive the study 
procedures with a ‘fake’ (placebo) Erchonia® FX-635™  laser .   
 
The ‘fake’  (placebo)  laser device  will appear to the subject to be an active device, but will n ot 
produce any therapeutic light output . The placebo laser device is designed to have the same 
physical appearance as the actual (active test) laser device, including the appearance of any visible  
light output. Therefore, both the test and control devices emit light when activated that is 
indistinguishable to the subject. As the laser light does not put out any notable degree of heat or 
noise, these are not distinguishing factors for subjects between the active and control device s.  
 
Apart from the distinction of whether or not the subject  receives  the study proced ures with the actual 
or the fake  laser device , all subjects and investigat ive parties  will adhere to all phases  of the entire 
protocol design.   
 
DOUBLE BLIND DESIGN  
This clinical study will be a double -blind design, such that neither the subject nor the investigator 
will be aware of whether a subject is receiving the study treatments with the active (test procedure 
group assignment) or the ‘fake’ (placebo procedure gr oup assignment) Erchonia® FX-635™  until 
after the study is completed.  
 
Maintenance of study double -blind throughout the entire course of the study will be achieved 
through the following means:  
 
1) Each subject will be randomly assigned to Procedure Group A o r to Procedure Group B by [CONTACT_259294]. Subjects assigned to Procedure Group A will be treated with the 
Erchonia® FX-635™  A and subjects assigned to Procedure Group B will be treated with 
Erchonia® FX-635™  B. Only the study Sponsor will kn ow which label (‘A’ or ‘B’) corresponds 
to the actual (test) FX-635™  device and which label corresponds to the ‘fake’ device until the 
final study data analysis is complete. The Sponsor will ensure that this information is stored and 
maintained confidentia lly at the Sponsor’s work site. This knowledge will not be shared with the 
investigators, the subjects, or the study Monitor until the final data analysis is complete.  
 
2) The fake (placebo) Erchonia® FX-635™  is designed to have the same physical appearance a s 
the actual Erchonia® FX-635™ , including the appearance of any visible  light output. Therefore, 
both the test and sham devices emit light when activated that is indistinguishable to both the 
subject and to the investigator. As the laser light does not put  out any notable degree of heat or 
noise, these are not distinguishing factors for subjects between the two groups.  
 
Erchonia® FX -635™ Low Back Pain Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 4.2       Page 32  January 7,  2017 3) There will be two independent investigators interacting with subjects:  
 
(i) Administration Investigator : who will be responsibl e for administ rating the study treatment s 
to the subject; and  
(ii) Assessment  Investigator : who will be responsible for recording the study outcome 
measures. Only the administration investigator will be aware of whether a subject is 
assigned to Procedure Group A or B, althou gh he or she will not be made aware of whether 
A or B corresponds to the true or fake laser. Neither the assessment investigator nor the 
subject will be aware of the subject’s A/B Group assignment. In this way, the assessment 
investigator will not be able to form an association between A/B Procedure Group and 
active/sham device over the course of the study if a treatment effect is observed.  
 
4) During the laser procedures, both the subject and the administration investigator will wear NiOR 
LaserShields® MLA gl asses that filter out the laser light spectrum.  
 
RANDOMIZATION  
 
Subject allocation to procedure group will be via variable block randomization with varying block 
sizes of two, four and six used at random to minimize the likelihood of predicting the next procedure 
group assignment. In addition, randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_259295].  
 
Randomization will be attained using computer generation sequence methodology,  insuring that 
the randomization methodology and the generated allocation sequence i s concealed from the 
investigator and subjects.  
 
Concealment will be insured as follows:  
 
(ii) Each computer -generated randomization sequence is unique and will therefore not be able to 
be replicated.  
(iii) Randomization will occur to either ‘Procedure Group A’ or t o ‘Procedure Group B’ rather than 
to a test or placebo group, and only the study Sponsor will know which assignment (A or B) 
corresponds to the active device and which corresponds to the fake device. The Sponsor will 
not reveal this information to any sour ce (investigators, subjects, or study Monitor) until the final 
study data analysis is complete.

Erchonia® FX -635™ Low Back Pain Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 4.[ADDRESS_315158] been established for the 
purposes of assessing efficacy of the  Erchonia® FX-635™  in this clinical study : 
 
➢ Individual subject success criteria defined as a 30% or greater reduction  in self-reported Degree 
of Pain rating on the 0-100 VAS from baseline  to study endpoint evaluation .  
➢ Overall study success criteria  defined as  a minimum  35% difference between the test dev ice 
group and the placebo device group in  the proportion of individual successes.  
➢ It is anticipated that about 55% of subjects in the test device group and about 20% of subjects 
in the placebo device group will meet the individual success criteria, and  
➢ Intended application of a two -tailed test w ith an alpha value of 0.05 and Power of 0.8  
 
The clinical relevance  of a 30% change in VAS score and a 35% difference in the proportion of 
individual successes between procedure groups has been well previously established over the past 
8 years by [CONTACT_8415]’s Division of Surgical, Orthopedic and Restorative Devices through numerous pre -
IDE reviews, the resul ts of said studies that were subsequently used to successfully support various 
pain-reduction related indications for various Erchonia Corporation light therapy devices under 
Product Code NHN for the 510(k)s as listed below:  
 
1. K101430 ; 06/22/10: “The FX-635™-AC DermaScanner™ is indicated, while using the red 
diodes, for adjunctive use in providing temporary relief of minor chronic neck and shoulder pain 
of musculoskeletal origin.”  
2. K100509 ; 06/08/10: “The Erchonia THL1 is indicated for use in providing temporary relief of 
minor chronic neck and shoulder pain of musculoskeletal origin.”  
3. K072206 ; 04/24/08: “The Erchonia EML Laser is indicated for the temporary reduction in post -
surgery pain at [ADDRESS_315159] augmentation  surgery.”  
4. K050672 ; 06/02/05: “The Erchonia EVRL Laser is generally indicated while using the red diode 
for adjunctive use in providing temporary relief of minor chronic neck and shoulder pain of 
musculoskeletal origin.”  
5. K041139 ; 09/30/04: “The Erchonia EM L Laser is indicated as an adjunct to liposuction 
procedures of the thighs, hips and stomach for reduction of pain associated with the recovery 
process.”  
 
In consideration of the above parameters established for the purposes of sample size calculation, 
the sample size of 29 subjects per procedure group (test group and placebo group , separately ) has 
been determined using  the following reference calculator : Hypothesis Testing: Categorical Data - 
Estimation of Sample Size and Power for Comparing Two Binomial P roportions  in Bernard Rosner's 
Fundamentals of Biostatistics . 
 
It is anticipated that about one -twentieth of subjects overall may withdraw from the study prior to 
completion for various reasons. Therefore, the following formula is used to determine the final 
needed starti ng sample size for each group:  
 
Final sample size = sample size X 1/(1 -d); where d = # exp ected dropouts/# subjects enrolled.  
Final sample size = 29 X 1/(1 -0.083) 
Final sample size = 29 X 1/0. 917 = 29 X 1.0905 = 31.62, rounded to 32  subjects per group . 
 
Therefore, a minimum starting sample size of 32 subjects in each procedure group is needed to 
ensure that  a sufficient number remains at the end of the trial ( 29 subjects per group) for any 
significant differences found between groups to be considered statistically valid and representative 
of the general population being sampled.  This results in a total of 64 subjects being enrolled in this 
study across both study  procedure groups .

QUALIFICATION EVALUATION TOOLS  
 
THE SIMPLIFIED CALCULATED OSTEOPOROSIS RISK ESTIMATION (SCORE)  
 
The Simplified Calculated Osteoporosis Risk Estimation (SCORE)  questionnaire , developed by 
[CONTACT_259296]., is  a screening tool used to determine if a woman should be evaluated for osteoporosis 
by [CONTACT_232766].  
 
SCORE performed well when compared to other prediction rules. Performance characteristics  for 
SCORE are:  
 
T-score  Sensitivity  Specificity  
< -2 98% 28% 
< -1 91% 31% 
 
SCORE is comprised of the following 6 questions:  
 
(1) age  
(2) race  
(3) body weight in pounds  
(4) history of rheumatoid arthritis  
(5) history of estrogen therapy  
(6) types of nontraumatic fractures after the age of 45  
 
Scoring and Total SCORE  calculation  is as follows:

DUAL -ENERGY X -RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY (DEXA)  
 
DEXA is the most accurate means of bone mineral density measurement .  A bone density test 
measures the density of minerals (such as  calcium ) in the bones using a special  X-ray, the results 
of which are used to estimate bone strength. DEXA uses two different X -ray beams to estimate 
bone density in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_35632].   Strong, dense bones allow less of the X -ray beam to pass 
through them. The amounts of each X -ray beam that are blocked by [CONTACT_259297]. D EXA can measure as little as 2% of bone loss per year. It is fast and 
uses very low doses of radiation.  

Erchonia® FX -635™ Low Back Pain Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 4.2       Page 38  January 7,  2017 DEXA assessment generates a  T-score  which represent the individual’s bone density compared

RESCUE PAIN MEDICATION USE  
 
For the purpose of standardization and comparability of outcome assessment across the study 
subject population, t his clinical study will incorporate the use of rescue pain medication  for subject 
as-needed management of low back pain throughout study participation duration.  
 
The rescue pain medication to be used in this study will be over -the-counter Regular Strength 
Tylenol® tablets. Each s ubject will be instructed to take a dosage of Tylenol as needed to control 
any low back  pain he or she may be experiencing, ensuring that the directions for use on the labeling 
are followed.  
 
The s ubject will be instructed to record in the Subject D aily Diary  each time he or she takes a  dose 
of the study rescue pain medication at any time during the entire course of his or her study 
participation from study enrollment through to the final post -procedure administration visit . 
 
The s ubject will be inst ructed to not take a dose of any other over -the-counter or prescription 
medications for the indication of pain relief, including NSAIDs  other than  the specified study rescue 
pain medication , across the entire course of his or her study participation from s tudy enrollment 
through to the final post -procedure administration visit . 
 
The s ubject will be instructed not to record a VAS pain rating (whenever indicated) any sooner than 
six hours after taking a dosage of the stud y pain relief rescue medication to ens ure that the effect 
of the pain relief rescue medication does not influence the recorded effect of the study procedures 
with the Erchonia® FX-635™  device. That is, a VAS rating is only to be recorded once the effect of 
any previously -consumed rescue pain m edication has dissipated. The subject will be able to take 
another dosage of the study pain relief rescue medication immediately after recording the VAS 
rating, if needed  to manage his or her low back pain .  
 
Throughout the course of his or her study parti cipation, a subject can continue to take any other 
over-the-counter and/or prescription medication(s) that he or she usually takes for any other (non -
pain relief) indication(s), as he or she usually takes them, as reported at Baseline evaluation and 
approv ed by [CONTACT_1704]. Subjects will be required to record each time he or she takes a 
dose of any non -pain relief indicated medication in the Subject Daily Diary across study participation 
duration.   
 
OUTCOME ASSESSMENT TOOLS  
 
VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) DEGREE OF PAIN RATING  
 
Subjects will be asked to rate the overall degree of pain experienc ed in the lower back  region  on 
the following 0 -100 mm (0 -10 cm) Visual Analog Pain Scale, by [CONTACT_259300] : 
 
“Using the scale  below, please mark with a cross (X) the spot along the [ADDRESS_315163] shows h ow much  pain you feel in your lower back  right now. ‘0’ means you feel  no pain at 
all and ‘100’ means you feel the worst pain imaginable.  Please mark only one spot.”    
 
                     no pain                                                worst pain imaginable  
 
 

Erchonia® FX -635™ Low Back Pain Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 4.2       Page 40  January 7,  2017 The Visual Analog Pain Scale  (VAS)  is one of the three most commonly used scales for assessing 
chronic pain. It is a simple scale that consists of a line anchored at one end by a label such as "NO 
PAIN" and at the other end "WORST POSSIBLE PAIN". The subject  marks on the line the spot for 
the pain intensity, which is then measured.  
 
Standard guidelines for effective use of the VAS that are followed in this clinical study are:  
 
i. The line should be 10, [ADDRESS_315164] be in absolute terms (e.g. worst pain imaginable);  
iv. The line itself should be clear of any markings and should be horizontal rather than vertical, for 
more reliable  measurements.  
 
Used in the above way, it has been shown that the VAS is a proper ratio scale. Like a thermometer, 
this means that its two ends are rooted, and a doubling of the score does accurately reflect a 
doubling of the pain. Consequently, sensitive  t-tests and ANOVA methods can be used in the 
analysis, so that significant differences can be identified with relatively small sample sizes or small 
differences between groups.

her study rescue pain relief medication immediately after recording a VAS rating, if needed.  
 
THE OSWESTRY DISABILITY INDEX (ODI) /OSWESTRY LOW BACK PAIN QUESTIONNAIRE  
 
The Oswestry Disability Index  (ODI) is an index derived from the Oswestry Low Back Pain 
Questionnaire used by [CONTACT_259302]. The ODI is currently considered the gold standard of low back functional outcome tools for 
measuring degree of disability and estimating quality of life in a person with low back pain.  
 
The validated questionnaire was first published by [CONTACT_259303]. in  Physiotherapy  in 1980. 
The current version was published in the journal  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_259248] 2000.  The self -completed questionnaire 
evaluates the patient’s perceived level of disability in 10 everyday activities of daily living concerning 
intensity of pain, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability 
to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel.   
 
Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the 
patient's life relating to the topic. The patient then checks the statement which most closely 
resembles their situation.  
 
Scoring  
Each question is scored on a scale of [ADDRESS_315166] score is used to calculate the ODI.  
 
The ODI is expressed as a percentage and calculated by [CONTACT_259304] (that is dependent on how many questions are 
answere d) and multiplying by 100.  
Erchonia® FX -635™ Low Back Pain Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 4.2       Page 41  January 7,  2017 Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible. 
 
Minimum detectable change (90% confidence) is 10% points  
 
Scoring Interpretation  
 0 to 20: minimal disability  
• 21-40: moderate disability  
• 41-60: severe disability  
• 61-80: crippling back pain  
• 81-100: these patients are either bed -bound or have an exaggeration of their symptoms.

RANGE OF MOTION (ROM ) 
 
The subject’s ROM measurements for flexion, exte nsion, left lateral flexion and right lateral flexion 
will be taken using a goniometer and following the American Medical Association Guides (2nd and 
4th editions) recommend ation  using measurements of thoracolumbar and lumbar range of 
movement, respectively, to estimate the percentage of impairment in patients with chronic low back 
pain.  These measurements evaluate the mobility of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_259249] a

PROCEDURE ADMINISTRATION PROTOCOL   
 
➢ The procedure administration phase of the study will commence within one hour subsequent t o 
completion o f the pre -procedure phase .    
➢ The procedure administration phase will extend over 4 consecutive weeks.  
➢ Each subject will receive 8 total procedures with the Erchonia ® FX-635™  across the consecutive 
4-week procedure administration phase : 2 procedure administrations per week, each procedure 
administration approximately evenly spaced  (3 to 4 days apart) . 
➢ Each procedure administration lasts a total of 20 minutes  
➢ Each procedure administration with the Erchonia® FX-635™  will be administered at the 
investigator’s test site.  
➢ The procedure administration protocol for each session is as follows:  
 
1. The subject enters the procedure room and lies comfortably on his or her stomach  on the 
table such that the back  area of the subject’s body is facing upwards.  
2. The subject is correctly fitted with the NoIR protective eyewear.  
3. The center diode of the Erchonia® FX-635™  is positioned at a distance of [ADDRESS_315180]’s back, centered on the lower back, with the other 2 diodes centered one each on 
each of the 2 hip flexors.   
4. The Erchonia® FX-635™  is activated for [ADDRESS_315181] pattern totally random and independent from the others. These patterns overlap each 
other to guarantee total c overa ge within the target area . The target area is approximately  8 x 
10 inches or 80 square inches (approx. 516 square centimeters).   
5. The subject’s protective eyewear is removed and the session is over.  
 
Justification for the Procedure Administration Protocol  
 
In the prior clinical study evaluating efficacy of Erchonia LLLT on the reduction of low back pain, 
the procedure administration protocol implemented comprised six 15 -minute procedure 
administrations over 3 weeks; [ADDRESS_315182] (the clinically meaningful pain reduction outcome) appeared to 
develop at a slower rate over a longer period of time  than that which had been demonstrated in 
prior Erchonia Corporation clinical studies for pain reduction indications such as for neck and 
shoulder pain (K100509) and for chronic heel (plantar fasciitis) pain (K132940), indicating that the 
condition of chronic low back pain is a more  resistant to therapy than the other chronic pain 
conditions previously evaluated and therefore necessitates a slightly enhanced procedure 
administration protocol that does not increase the risk to the subject nor compromise subj ect safety 
in any way in its implementation.  
 
Therefore, it was decided that slight increments in and modifications to each of the procedure 
administration outputs variables was warranted to attain a comparable treatment effect for the 
reduction of chronic  low back pain as had been attained in prior Erchonia Corporation pain reduction 
clinical trials, as shown in the comparative table below:

day of the procedure administration phase . 
 
The rescue pain medication (OTC Tylenol) use count on da y one of the procedure administration 
phase will serve as the subject’s initial (baseline) pain medication count for the purpose of 
subsequent evaluation of change in utilization of pain relief medication throughout study 
participation.

determination of relation ship to the study treatment and whether or not any corrective action needs 
to be taken.  All potential adverse events recorded will be appropriately reported to the governing 
IRB, as applicable . 
 
It is unlikely and not expected that any adverse events will result from implementation of this clinical 
study protocol. Prior clinical trials using low level laser  light have not  typi[INVESTIGATOR_259270] . However, p otential adv erse events that may feasibly occur from application of 
the Erchonia® FX-635™  include, but are not necessarily limited to: skin irritation, discoloring, rash, 
indentations and infection.

Version 4.2       Page 56  January 7,  2017 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
PRIMARY EFFICACY OUTCOME MEASURE : CHANGE IN SUBJECT SELF -REPORTED VAS 
PAIN RATING  FROM BASELINE TO STUDY ENDPOINT    
 
Primary efficacy outcome measure for this clinical study will be a statistically significant difference 
in the proportion of subjects between test and control groups who achieve a clinically meaningful 
and statistically significant decrease in self-reported VAS pain rating  from baseline  to study 
endpoint .    
 
Subjects meeting Individual Success Criteria  
The individual subject success criteria is defined as a 30% or greater decrease in self-reported VAS 
pain rating at study endpoint relative to baseline.  
 
Overall Study Success Criteria.   
Overall study success criteria is defined as at least a 35% difference between procedure groups, 
comparing the proportion of in dividual successes in each group. It is anticipated that about 55% of 
subjects in the test group will meet the individ ual success criteria and about 20% of subjects in the 
control group will meet the individual success criteria.  
 
The clinical relevance of  a 30% change in VAS score has been well previously established by [CONTACT_8415]’s 
Division of Surgical, Orthopedic and Restorative Devices through numerous pre -IDE reviews, the 
results of said studies that were subsequently used to successfully support various pain-reduction 
related indications for various Erchonia Corporation light therapy devices under Product Code NHN 
for the 510(k)s listed below over the past 8 years:  
 
1. K101430; 06/22/10: “The MLS -AC DermaScanner™ is indicated, while using the red diodes, 
for adj unctive use in providing temporary relief of minor chronic neck and shoulder pain of 
musculoskeletal origin.”  
 
2. K100509; 06/08/10: “The Erchonia THL1 is indicated for use in providing temporary relief of 
minor chronic neck and shoulder pain of musculoskelet al origin.”  
 
3. K072206; 04/24/08: “The Erchonia EML Laser is indicated for the temporary reduction in post -
surgery pain at [ADDRESS_315192] augmentation surgery.”  
 
4. K050672; 06/02/05: “The Erchonia EVRL Laser is generally indicated while using the red diode 
for adjunctive use in providing temporary relief of minor chronic neck and shoulder pain of 
musculoskeletal origin.”  
 
5. K041139; 09/30/04: “The Erchonia EML Laser is indicated as an adjunct to liposuction 
procedures of the  thighs, hips and stomach for reduction of pain associated with the recovery 
process.”

procedure evaluation relative to baseline evaluation .   
 
The rationale and validation for the timing of the study endpoint is based a combination of factors, 
as follows:   
 
➢ The long-term follow -up results of the following Erchonia Corporation clinical trial that 
successfully supported the following FDA 510(k) clearance for market, demonstrate d that while 
a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in pain did occur over the course of 
the treatment administration period, the therapeutic effects prevail ed, extend ed and int ensif ied 
over the longer  term, and the difference in efficacy results between active and control groups 
widened for chronic pain conditions.

Product Code:  NHN  
Clearance Date:  04/14/14  
Indication for Use:  The Erchonia® Allay™ laser is indicated as an adjunct to reducing chronic 
heel pain arising from plantar fasciitis.  
 
The chart below shows the average VAS heel pain ratings for [ADDRESS_315194]-procedure. It can be seen that while at study endpoint evaluation ([ADDRESS_315195] -
procedure), a statistically significant and clinically me aningful decrease in mean VAS ratings 
occurred, this effect prevailed through to [ADDRESS_315196] 
negligible recordable pain levels.

Erchonia® FX -635™ Low Back Pain Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 4.2       Page 58  January 7,  2017 We believe this phenomenon occurs for two primary reasons:  
 
(i) It is hypothesized from the understanding of the general mechanism of operation of LLLT to 
pain reduction (as explained in detail in the clinical study protocol), that the increase in the 
production of ATP and activate enzymes in the underlying targeted ce lls of the tissue that 
cultivate a growth factor response within the cells and promote tissue healing, and new, 
healthier cell and tissue growth to strengthen and support muscles and tendons, to restore 
strength and flexibility and to protect against furth er damage, together with the anti -inflammatory 
properties of low level lasers that reduce nerve irritation and inflammation to provide pain relief, 
neither ends nor peaks at completion of treatment administration, but rather the therapeutic 
properties of t he LLLT continue to take effect and to intensify over the prevailing weeks and 
months.  
 
(ii) Inherent in individuals with chronic pain conditions is the hope in finding a means of substantial 
and durable pain relief, which is observable in the typi[INVESTIGATOR_259271]. Therefore, the need for a longer -term 
evaluation period in order for subjects to distinguish true and enduring pain relief from that of 
wishful pain relief, and for the true active therapeutic effect versus placebo to prevail is evident.

510(k)#:  K132940  
Manufacturer:  Erchonia Corporation  
Device Class:  Class II  
Product Code:  NHN  
Clearance Date:  04/14/14  
Indication for Use:  The Erchonia® Allay™ laser is indicated as an adjunct to reducing 
chronic heel pain arising from plantar fasciitis.  
 
➢ The findings of this study are consistent with and supported by [CONTACT_259308]. Many of these practitioners have reported to Erchonia Corporation that 
patients treated with the Erchonia laser for neck and shoulder pain and heel pain have reported 
anecdotally at follow -up visits many months after treatment end that their pain has continued to 
lessen over time.  
 
➢ Further support comes from prior clinical trials by [CONTACT_259309] 510(k) market clearances for LLLT devi ces to the reduction 
of pain associated with chronic pain conditions. Most notable of these is the MicroLight 830 
LLLT study whose results were used to support the indication of the reduction of pain associated 
with the musculoskeletal condition of carpal tunnel syndrome (K010175). In this study, the study 
evaluation endpoint was 12 weeks (3 months) post -procedure.  
 
It is for all of the above reasons that it was decided that in the present clinical study, a longer post -
procedure endpoint evaluation is warra nted to attain a more accurate representation of optimal 
treatment effect of LLLT application with the Erchonia® FX-635™  laser device  to the chronic pain 
condition of low back pain of musculoskeletal origin .

Version 4.2       Page 59  January 7,  2017 Hypotheses  
 
➢ Null Hypothesis : There will be no statistically significant difference in the proportion of individual 
success es, as defined , between the test and control groups.  
➢ Alternative  Hypothesis : There will be a statistically significant difference in the proportion of 
individual success es, as defined , between the test and control groups , to the effect of 3 5% or 
greater . 
 
PRIMARY EFFICACY OUTCOME STATISTICAL EVALUATION METHODS  
 
➢ Intent to Treat (ITT) Principle : Primary efficacy  analysis will be according to the intent to treat 
(ITT) principle; wherein subjects will be included in the analysis if they were randomized to study 
procedure group, had a valid baseline (pre -procedure) visit including the required low back pain 
VAS recor ding; and received at least the first study procedure administration.  
 
➢ Missing data  will be handled through  Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) : by [CONTACT_259310].  
 
➢ Per-Protocol Analysis  will also be performed for the set of all subjects who were randomized 
to procedure group and completed the study according to the full protocol.  
 
➢ Primary analysis of efficacy  will be according to intent to treat  (ITT) analysis through the 
applic ation of:  
 
1) Fisher's exact test  to compare the proportion of success between the test and the control 
groups, considering that randomization has been diligently conducted and important 
covariates between the two groups are well balanced.  
 
2) Parametric ANCOVA model  analysis with the mean c hange from baseline to study endpoint 
in low back  pain rating on the VAS as the dependent variable, procedure group as the 
independent variable of interest and baseline low back  pain VAS rating as a covariate. A two -
tailed significance level of 5% will be considered to be statistically significant.  
  
➢ Covariates: The following potential covariate baseline variables will be adjusted, as applicable, 
through application of an ANCOVA analysis for the continuous variables and linear regression 
analysis for categ orical variables.  
 
✓ Baseline Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score  
✓ Age

Version 4.2       Page 60  January 7,  2017 SUPPORTIVE SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE : OSWESTRY DISABILITY INDEX (ODI) 
SCORE  
 
ODI scores will be considered a secondary endpoint to support the primary pain evaluation outcome 
measure of subject self -reported degree of low back pain levels recorded on the 0 -100 Visual 
Analog Scale (VAS).  
 
The ODI score will be evaluated as follows:  
 
➢ Change in ODI score from study baseline to endpoint evaluation will be calculated , with a 
clinically meaningful change determined to be 10% decrease in point s, based on the established 
minimum detectable change (90% confidence) of 10% points . Statistical  significance of the 
change will be evaluated through parametric t -test and ANCOVA analysis, with a  two-way 
significance level of 5% considered to be statistically significant.  
➢ Correlation analysis will be performed to evaluate the strength of the relatio nship between the 
change in VAS ratings and the corresponding change in ODI scores from baseline to study 
endpoint  evaluation.   
 
ADDITIONAL SUPPORTIVE OUTCOME MEASURES  EVALUATION  
 
The following  additional  supportive outcome measures will also be evaluated  as exploratory 
qualitative trending of the following, without claims of statistical significance : 
 
a) mean changes in low back pain VAS ratings across and between all study evaluation time 
points, within and  between procedure groups  
b) mean changes in ODI scores  across and between all study evaluation time points, within and 
between procedure groups  
c) Mean changes in each of the range of motion measurements across and between all evaluation 
points, within and between procedure groups  
d) Differences in satisfaction with Study Outcome Ratings between procedure groups at both 
evaluated time points, and change between   
 
EVALUATION OF RESCUE PAIN MEDICATION USE  
 
The impact of rescue pain medication use during the study will be evaluated using descriptive 
statistics and qualitative comparisons.  
 
BLINDING EFFICACY EVALUATION  
 
Blinding efficacy evaluation will be conducted through analysis of findings from the Subject and the 
Assessment Investigator Percei ved Subject Group Allocation and Rationale responses, recorded 
at completion of the four -week procedure administration phase and again at study endpoint 
evaluation at [ADDRESS_315197] -procedure administration.  
 
Statistical evaluation of blinding efficacy will  be performed as follows:  
 
(i) The percentage of subjects who correctly perceived their procedure group assignment and the 
percentage of subjects who did not correctly perceive their procedure group assignment will be 
calculated.  
Erchonia® FX -635™ Low Back Pain Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 4.2       Page 61  January 7,  2017 (ii) The percentage of times the as sessment investigators correctly perceived subjects’ procedure 
group assignment and the percentage of times the assessment investigators did not correctly 
perceive subjects’ procedure group assignment will be calculated.  
(iii) The Fischer’s Exact categorical ana lysis technique  for comparison of proportion of 
successes (accurate procedure group assignment determination) and failures (inaccurate 
procedure group assignment determination) between subject groups will be performed  for each 
of the subject  and assessment investigator determinations.  
(iv) Qualitative analysis confirmation:  Evaluation of the co mments provided by [CONTACT_259311] a ssignment will 
be evaluated and interpreted as follows to either support or negate the numerical findings:   
 
➢ Positive blinding efficacy  will be supported through qualitative assessment of comments 
provided to support perceived group assignment that pertain to the determination being 
made based on treatment efficacy or lack thereof; e.g.: ‘I can bend down and walk around  
more  easily and with less pain than before, so I believe I got the real treatment’ or ‘I haven’t 
noticed any change in my low back  pain, so I believe I got the fake treatment.’  
 
➢ Blinding will be determined to have failed  if comments provided to support perceived group 
assignment pertain to factors such as sensation/visual clues, such as ‘I saw/didn’t see a 
light go on’, or other factors that p ertain to blinding having been compromised such as ‘I 
overheard the doctor saying I wasn’t getting the real treatment.’  
 
SAFETY ANALYSES   
 
Safety analyses will be based on all subjects who were randomized to the test or to the placebo 
procedure group. Safe ty will be assessed by [CONTACT_259312]/or reported adverse events between test and placebo procedure groups. A chi -
square test with a continuity correction will be performed to compare the percentage of subj ects 
who had adverse events between test and placebo group subjects.  
 
Analysis of results will be performed by [CONTACT_259313]. Application 
of a balanced test -control group study design incorporating a varied block by [CONTACT_259314].

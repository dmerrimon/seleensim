Visit will be treated as the repeated measure with an unstructured covariance matrix used to model the within-patient measurements. The adjusted mean change from baseline (and the related standard error) will be calculated for each group and will be used for the MCPMod to determine therapeutic dose. 
The analyses for dose-finding will be performed using MCPMod 
whereby [CONTACT_195873] (patterns) will be evaluated to identify the best-fitting model or subset of models.
Regarding analyses of the secondary endpoints, 
1. MMRM will be used for the analysis for the change of UACR 
in First Morning Void 
2. Descriptive statistics will be provided for the change of UACR 
in First Morning Void urine/10-hour urine and the UACR response rate along with figures.

ivThe timepoint of first treatment (Visit 3) defines Day 1.  
vVisits [ADDRESS_232574] an End of Treatment (EoT) visi t, if they agree. Please see section 6.2.4 for 
details.
viiThese visits can either be performed at the Investigational site or at the patient’s home. All local approvals for this must be  in place and confirmed by [CONTACT_456]. Consent 
for home visits must also be obtained from the patient. See section 6.2.1 for further details. 
viiiThere are various ways that Telemedicine contacts (phone call or video call) can be used during this trial:
1. Telemedicine contact [CONTACT_195875]’s urine sampling. Before the patient does their first UACR and eGFR sampl ing at home (before Visit 2) the 
investigational site staff should contact [CONTACT_195876]. The other  timepoints marked as ‘(X)’ are suggested 
times to contact [CONTACT_195877][INVESTIGATOR_195852]. The site may, at their discretion, 
offer support with further home sampling according to the individual needs of a patient. 
2. Telemedicine calls at visit 6 (marked as “O”) and/or FUp2. If this visit is being performed at the patient’s home by a nurse,  a telemedicine contact [CONTACT_195878], patient and an Investigator who will guide the nurse through the physical exam (see section 6.2.1 ).
3. FUp1 must be performed as telemedicine contact [CONTACT_195879], unless they prefer to come to the trial site.
4. Phone/ video calls may also take place at any other time if needed to support the patient.
ixInformed consent does not need to be obtained on the day of the screening visit but must be obtained before the first screening  assessment and within 35 days of 
randomisation (visit 3). The consent discussion should include showing the patient the home sampling kits and explaining this pr ocedure.
xOnce screening assessments have been completed, a member of the trial team will contact [CONTACT_195880].
xiAt Visits [ADDRESS_232575] at Screening (Visit  1), thereafter a urine pregnancy test will be 
performed.

screening be borderline out of range and not match inclusion criteria due to UACR variability, this test can be repeated once.  The result must be available and eligibility 
confirmed before the baseline UACR sampling starts. If the second result does not meet the eligibility criteria the patient sho uld be screen failed
xixTraining on how to use the  device and how to do the FMV and 10-hour sampling will be provided to the patient at the screening visit. This will 
include instructions regarding sample shipments / what to bring in for clinic visits.
xx  performed at home can be returned by e.g. post or courier (if permitted by [CONTACT_195882]-specific regulations and other local guidan ce). If not allowed 
locally, the patient should return the samples to the investigational site. Countries may be exempted from microsampling if use  of the  is not permitted in that 
country.
xxiPatients will need to complete 2 different diaries. The ‘Diary for Urine and Blood Collection and Trial Drug Times’ will enable  the site to record information entered during 
urine and blood collection at home and 2 days prior to PK sampling including times of trial drug intake, start and stop times o f collection and volumes. The ‘Daily Diary 
for Trial Drug Intake’ will help to check the compliance of the patient and a possible need for down-titration. If the patient c hooses they will be able to download an app 
containing the diaries to their phone at visit [ADDRESS_232577] dose.
xxiiiAll AEs, SAEs and AESIs will be collected from informed consent until FUp1 (end of residual effect period). Please see section [IP_ADDRESS].1 .
xxivAfter FUp1 until the individual patient’s end of trial, the investigator should report any cancers of new histology and exacerb ations of existing cancer, all trial treatment 
related SAEs and all trial treatment related AESIs. Please see section [IP_ADDRESS].1
xxvAs detailed in section [IP_ADDRESS].1 after the individual patient’s end of the trial the investigator does not need to actively monitor the patient for new AEs but should report any 
occurrence of cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs of which the investigator may become aw are of by [CONTACT_23321], e.g. 
phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI SAE form (see section [IP_ADDRESS].2 ), but not on the CRF.

No signal for a pharmacodynamic interaction leading to low blood pressure was detected. BI 
[ADDRESS_232603] trial a responder was defined as a patient whose decrease from baseline in 
Urine Albumin Creatinine Ratio (UACR) was at least 20%. For UACR measured in morning void urine, 15.8 to 27.8% of analysed patients receiving BI 685509 in DG1 to DG3 (3 to 5 patients) were responders, compared with 1 patient (7.1%) receiving placebo. For UACR measured in 10-hour urine, ≥50% of analysed patients receiving BI 685509 in DG2 and DG3 
(8 to 10 patients) were responders, compared with no patients receiving placebo [c30365927-
01].
Based on recent data from a clinical trial (1366-0020) in patients with cirrhosis Child-Pugh 
stage A (24 patients) and B (25 patients), an effect of BI 685509 on the predicted placebo-corrected change from baseline QTcF ( ∆∆QTcF) was seen. Dosing regimens up to [ADDRESS_232604] dose group in this trial, were used.  In both patient groups, there was a dose dependent increase of ∆∆QTcF up to 13.7 ms, with the upper 90% CI >20 ms. In one 
patient group (Child-Pugh B) this was concomitant with a change of the predicted placebo-corrected change from baseline heart rate ( ∆∆HR) of > 10 beats per minute (bpm), but not in 
the other patient group. No such effect was seen in a healthy Caucasian volunteers trial (1366-0010) for dosing regimens used in this trial.  In a healthy Asian volunteers trial (1366-0013), at a dose regimen relevant for this study (i.e. starting with 1 mg tid up to a final dose of 3 mg tid), an increase of ∆∆QTcF was seen up to 11.7 ms with 90% CI <20 ms, 
concomitant with an increase of ∆∆HR of nearly [ADDRESS_232605] on human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) channel at doses used

1.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE TRIAL
ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs are currently recommended 
for diabetic renal patients with at least microalbuminuria while in non-diabetic CKD patients this is the case for macroalbuminuria only. The SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin has recently shown a relative risk reduction of 30% for the composite endpoint of doubling of serum

US, under regulatory review in other parts of the world and has been incorporated in several important guidelines. Regarding additional treatment options for non-diabetic CKD patients, the recent early discontinuation for efficacy of the DAPA-CKD trial holds promise but the exact results will only become available over the coming months.  Given the potential that SGLT2 inhibitors may be used in the near future in non-diabetic population, consideration has been made in terms of inclusion/ exclusion criteria and also in stratifying randomisation for this trial.
In summary, the residual renal as well as cardiovascular risk for patients remains 
unacceptably high warranting continued efforts to provide further treatment options.
The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK and PD of three oral 
doses of BI [ADDRESS_232608] of care according to respective guidelines. The results of this trial will be crucial for the decision about further development of BI 685509 and will support the dose selection for future trials.
In order to be able to address future scientific questions, patients will be asked to voluntarily 
donate biospecimens for banking (please see section 5.5 ). If the patient agrees, banked 
samples may be used for future biomarker research and drug development projects, e.g. to 
identify patients that are more likely to benefit from a treatment or experience an adverse event (AE), or to gain a mechanistic or genetic understanding of drug effects and thereby [CONTACT_195883][INVESTIGATOR_014].

Treatment with BI 685509 will potentially result in decreased progression towards dialysis or kidney transplantation due to preventing the progression of renal damage, which may directly translate into relevant improvements for patients’ morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. Beyond that, it may reduce the number of cardiovascular events in the target population.
Patients may also benefit from more frequent clinical monitoring as a result of being part of a 
clinical trial.

A steering committee consisting of the coordinating investigators in trial 1366-0005 (a matching trial to investigate BI 685509 in DKD) and other selected investigators as well as members of the BI trial team will meet in regular intervals and look at blinded safety data to identify potential risks that need further safety measures. A charter will be available before trial initiation to define the specific data reviews and meeting intervals.
1.4.3 Discussion
Based on pre-clinical results, BI 685509 has the potential to slow progression of renal 
damage, delay end stage renal disease (ESRD) and reduce cardiovascular events such as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23224].  In addition, clinical studies in healthy volunteers and Diabetic Kidney Disease patients have shown that it is well tolerated when up-titrated to the doses to be administered in this trial. 
A placebo arm is needed to allow for a true assessment of the effects of BI [ADDRESS_232614] on progression of 
non-diabetic kidney disease in humans and based on the safety profile of BI 685509, the benefit-risk evaluation of the compound is considered favourable for the intended population.

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN 
This trial is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind (within dose groups), parallel, placebo-
controlled clinical trial to compare three doses of BI [ADDRESS_232618] of care according to local guidelines.
A schematic illustration of the trial design is presented in Figure 3.1: 1
Figure 3.1: 1Trial design
Patients will be enrolled (screened) in the trial once they have signed the informed consent.  
They will undergo a screening period of up to 3 weeks from the time of informed consent.  After their eligibility has been confirmed at screening, patients will continue in a 2-week baseline run-in period. Patients who successfully complete the screening and baseline run-in period and meet the inclusion/ exclusion criteria will be randomised equally into one of three parallel dose groups, and in each dose group to treatment either with BI 685509 or matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio (see Figure 3.1:1 .).
From the start of the run-in until the end of the trial, at various timepoints patients will collect 
their urine for UACR sampling.  These timepoints are listed in the UACR and eGFR 
sampling Flow Chart .  For each day that UACR is collected patients will start by [CONTACT_54315] a
First Morning Void urine in the container provided.  As soon as the First Morning Void 
sample is collected the clock starts for the10-hour urine collection.  During this 10-hourperiod every time the patient urinates they collect their urine into the provided container.  An aliquot of this urine will be taken and used as the 10-hour UACR sample.

A first follow-up telephone call (FUp1) at least [ADDRESS_232621] Period (REP).  Until the end of REP all AEs and changes to concomitant medication need to be collected, documented and reported.
During the entire follow-up period the patient will not be treated with trial medication but 
should if possible continue with any background treatment they were on, and will collect additional urine and/ or blood samples at home. At the end of the 4-week follow-up a last physical visit will occur where again blood and urine samples will be collected. Depending on local regulations and approvals this visit may occur at the site or the patient’s home. With the conclusion of this visit the trial participation is complete for the individual patient.
Historical serum creatinine data will be collected in the trial over a period of [ADDRESS_232622] completed their final visit.

UACR was chosen as primary endpoint (10-hour collection) and secondary endpoint 
(responder rate and First Morning Void (FMV)) because it was shown in previous phase II trials by [CONTACT_195885], differentiating different doses, broad in its dynamic range and reaching a stable plateau within a reasonable time after start of treatment. It has been accepted by [CONTACT_195886]. In the MRD phase I trial in patients (1366-0004) UACR in 10-hour urine collected over the day (approximately starting with the morning dose) showed a greater difference to placebo compared to FMV urine. It is considered that 10-hour urine is able to capture the drug effect during the dosing schedule, while FMV urine contains the urine produced over night. While a 10-hour urine at daytime may be easier for patient to collect, a 24-hour collection would be more burdensome and prone to error during night time collection. Also 10-hour UACR may be superior to FMV urine as the latter is depending on many factors such as nocturia and time of the first urination in the morning.
Furthermore, the change in UACR upon treatment within approximately 16 weeks of full 
dose correlates with long-term patient relevant outcomes. Based on this and including a 4-week up-titration, until the target dose is achieved, the full duration of treatment has been selected to be 20 weeks.  Since UACR is a parameter that varies intra-individually over time, multiple measurements are required at baseline and during the treatment period especially towards the end of treatment where a stable response to the drug should be achieved. Sequential collection of urine during a 4-week follow-up period may deliver exploratory results of response stability and potential rebound effects.
To further characterise haemodynamic effects and potential early benefit on renal function 
serum creatinine will be measured at regular intervals for exploratory analysis.
In this parallel design, double-blind conditions regarding the patient’s treatment (active or 
placebo) are maintained within each dose group.  It is not feasible to apply double-blind conditions between dose groups because the individual tablet strengths and matching placebo look different. Therefore Investigators will know which dose group their patient is in but will be blinded to whether they are on active drug or placebo.  Patients will be blinded to both the dose group they are on and whether they are taking active drug or placebo.  Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_195856] a day on top of the extensive background medication they already receive, which is considered too burdensome for this clinical trial. However, in order to minimise possible observer bias with regard to dose dependent effects, the dose group will be blinded to the patient as much as possible by [CONTACT_195887]:

identifiable to the patient from the label 
∀Every effort should be made by [CONTACT_195888]
∀Up-titration or “pseudo-titration” will occur for all patients two weeks after the start 
of trial medication and again after another two weeks, regardless of dose group (seetable [IP_ADDRESS]:1 ).  Pseudo-titration is a term used to describe when patients are told that 
they are potentially assigned to a higher dose, but actually remain on the same dose.
oPatients in Dose Group 1 (1 mg TID) will be “pseudo-titrated” to 1 mg TID 
after two weeks and to 1 mg TID two weeks after that.  
oPatients in Dose Group 2 (2 mg TID) will be up-titrated from 1 mg TID to 2 
mg TID after two weeks and then “pseudo-titrated” to 2 mg TID two weeks after that.  
oPatients in Dose Group 3 (3 mg TID) will be up-titrated from 1 mg TID to 2 
mg TID after two weeks and to 3 mg TID two weeks after that. 
∀However, in case the patient experiences a related adverse event or for any other 
reason the patient pauses trial treatment the investigator will need to decide whether a down-titration is needed based on the rules reflected in section 4.1.[ADDRESS_232626] dose already.
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
It is expected that 240 patients will be randomised from approximately 100 sites.  Screening 
of patients for this trial is competitive, i.e. screening for the trial will stop at all sites at the same time once a sufficient number of patients has been screened. Investigators will be notified about screening completion and will then not be allowed to screen additional patients for this trial unless screening needs to be re-opened due to a higher rate of screen failures.
A log of all patients screened into the trial (i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the Investigator Site File (ISF) irrespective of whether they have been treated with investigational drug or not.
If a patient is randomised in error (does not meet all inclusion criteria or meets one or more 
exclusion criteria), the sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_15608].

Randomisation codes will be generated through a validated randomisation software and kept 
blinded to the trial team, sites and patients.
An Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system will be used to screen patients, perform 
drug assignment, manage initial/ re-supply ordering of drug supplies and handle emergency un-blinding.
The investigator will receive all necessary instructions from the Sponsor to access the IRT. 
Detailed IRT functions and procedures will be documented in the User Requirement Specifications mutually agreed by [CONTACT_195893]. Note that the medication number is different from the patient number (the latter is generated during screening via the IRT System).
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
All patients, regardless of dose group assigned, will start on a dose of 1 mg TID of BI 685509 
or matching placebo. Up-titration or pseudo up-titration will occur after 14 days and after 28 days in each dose group, until the maximum planned dose for that dose group is reached. Patients who do not tolerate an up-titration, e.g., due to orthostatic dysregulation, should follow the guidance in section [IP_ADDRESS] .
The treatment assignments and dose regimen are detailed in Table 4.1.4: 1.

If no true up-titration is required for a patient at regular timepoints (i.e. Visit 4 and again at Visit 5), then the patient will still get new medication at the same dose as before.  All patientswill be told that the medication could either be the same or a higher dose depending on the treatment and dose group to which the patient is allocated. 
During a COVID-19 or similar pandemic, physical visits to the sites may need to be restricted 
to ensure patient safety. Based on a thorough assessment of the benefits and risks, the investigator may still decide to continue the trial treatment and trial medication may be shipped to the patient’s home if acceptable according to local law and regulations (for more details see section 6.2.1 ). Shipment of trial medication to the patient’s home will also be 
allowed to support regular visits performed at the patient’s home.
Potential down-titrations (dose reductions) can be done based on the dose group known by 
[CONTACT_2727].  This will be managed via the IRT system.  Dose reductions may not be performed by [CONTACT_195894].  While the patient will not get to know the precise rules as listed in sections [IP_ADDRESS] and4.1.4.2 ,t h e

following rules will apply for the safety of the patient:
∀An interruption of trial treatment is defined as any occurrence where 4 consecutive 
doses* or more were not administered (i.e. missed or dosing temporarily discontinued). *One dose refers to an individual timepoint e.g. morning dose, or 
lunchtime/ middle dose or evening dose.
oIf less than 4 consecutive doses of trial medication are missed then the next 
dose of trial medication should be taken as scheduled.
∀After an interruption of trial treatment the patient should be restarted at 1 mg BI 
685509/ placebo TID independent from the dose the patient was on before unless the patient was down-titrated due to an adverse event (see section [IP_ADDRESS] ) in which case:
oIf they had been on 2mg/3mg BI 685509/ placebo they would re-start on 1mg 
BI 685509/ placebo.  
oIf they had been on 1mg BI 685509/ placebo then they should restart on 
placebo (matching 1 mg BI 685509).
∀Before any up-titration occurs the patient must have taken the preceding dose for at 
least 7 consecutive days.  This applies throughout the treatment period.
oThis may mean that a patient due to be up-titrated at visit 4 or 5 (as per Table 
4.1.4:1 ) is held at their current dose until their next scheduled visit.  They 
could also be up-titrated at an unscheduled visit once this requirement is met.
∀If interruption for any reason occurs after Visit 5, subsequent up-titration will be 
allowed either at a scheduled or unscheduled visits.
∀Patients with an interruption on 2mg or 3mg or matching placebo will need to return 
to the clinic either for the next scheduled or an unscheduled visit to receive 1mg tablets before continuation of trial treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rules for down-titration in case of intolerance to trial treatment
If a patient has an adverse event that the Investigator believes may be related to trial 
medication then the Investigator may either interrupt a patient’s trial medication (re-start to follow the rules above ( section [IP_ADDRESS] ) or dose reduce the patient as described below.  See 
Appendix 10.3 for a schematic guidance on down-titration:
∀If the patient is on 1 mg TID or matching placebo the patient will be down-titrated to 
placebo matching 1 mg.
∀If the patient is on 2 mg TID or 3 mg TID (or corresponding matching placebo) and 
interrupts trial treatment 
oless than 4 consecutive doses, then the patient will be down-titrated one level 
i.e.
2mg /placebo goes to 1 mg TID/ placebo.

TID or placebo.

related and they have already had an interruption/ down-titration, then the patient should permanently discontinue trial treatment.  
∀In case of persistent adverse events despi[INVESTIGATOR_16574], or severe effects at any 
dose, permanent treatment discontinuation should be considered.
∀Uptitration for patients who were down-titrated or interrupted for a related AE is not

4.1.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding
[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding
Patients, investigators and everyone involved in trial conduct or analysis or with any other 
interest except the Trial Pharmacometrician, PK programmer and Trial bioanalyst in this double-blind trial will remain blinded with regard to the randomised treatment assignments within each dose group until after database lock.  The access to the randomisation code will be kept restricted until its release for analysis.
The randomisation codes will be provided to bioanalytics prior to last patient completed to 
allow for the exclusion from the analyses of pharmacokinetic (PK) samples taken from placebo patients. Bioanalytics will not disclose the randomisation code or the results of their measurements until the trial is officially unblinded.
In order to expedite the population PK and PK/PD analyses and ensure timely delivery of 
PK/PD results after DBL, specific data must be unblinded and the treatment information must be made available to selected individuals. The unblinding procedure and logistics specific to this purpose will be provided in a separate document. It should be noted no PK/PD results will be communicated to the project and trial team prior to database lock.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding and breaking the code
Emergency unblinding will be available to the investigator via IRT. It must only be used in
an emergency situation when the identity of the trial drug must be known to the investigatorin order to provide appropriate medical treatment or otherwise assure safety of trialparticipants. The reason for unblinding must be documented in the source documents and/or appropriate CRF page.
Due to the requirements to report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs), it may be necessary for a representative from BI’s Pharmacovigilance group to access the randomisation code for individual patients during trial conduct. The access to the code will only be given to authorised Pharmacovigilance representatives for processing in the Pharmacovigilance (PV) database system and not be shared further.

5.1 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY
5.1.1 UACR
Urinary albumin and creatinine measurements are the basis for the calculation of urinary 
albumin creatinine ratio (UACR). FMV and 10-hour urine samples will be collected by [CONTACT_44126].  
The first morning void is the first urination after the patient wakes up at their usual time to 
start their day. Thus, if the patient goes back to sleep after urinating early in the morning this void does not need to be collected or documented. This applies also to any urinations earlier during the night in patients who have nocturia. There may be cases when a patient might go back to bed after their usual rising time. In those cases, the void at their usual rising time constitutes the first morning void.
Starting with the baseline period, UACR will be determined on two consecutive days to 
average biological variability at the timepoints indicated in the Flow Chart. On each 
collection day a sample must be obtained from the patient’s FMV and from the total of urine 
collected over [ADDRESS_232665] and store their urine samples. Further collection and sample storage instructions are given in the laboratory manual in the ISF and instructions to the patient.
Urinary albumin and creatinine will be analysed at a central laboratory using routine 
validated methods. Urinary creatinine may also be used for normalisation of exploratory urinary biomarkers (see section 5.4.1 ).

Lab tests may need to be repeated in case of required medical follow-up due to an adverse 
event or if a test was not successful due to incorrect specimen handling or storage. Should a patient not fulfil all lab requirements to take part in the trial due to a transitional medical condition, the patient may continue in the run-in phase but not be randomised until the retest of the lab result has shown eligibility of the patient.

The samples collected at visits will be compared to the eGFR calculations based on the common safety blood sample to show comparability for future trials.
In case the criteria for a potential severe DILI are fulfilled, a number of additional measures 
will be performed (please see section [IP_ADDRESS] and the DILI Checklist provided in the eDC

[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of AEs 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_232678] a causal relationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The following should also be recorded as an AE in the CRF and BI SAE form (if applicable):
∀Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre-existing conditions 
∀Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results, if they 
are judged clinically relevant by [CONTACT_093].
If such abnormalities already exist prior to trial inclusion, they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Serious adverse eventA serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE, which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria:
- results in death,- is life-threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe,
- requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574]- results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,- is a congenital anomaly / birth defect,- is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23236]. 
For Japan only: An event that possibly leads to disability will be handled as “deemed serious 
for any other reason” and therefore reported as an SAE.

Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by [CONTACT_15623], can always be

defined above.
The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC system. A copy of the latest 
list of “Always Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should always be reported as SAEs as described in section [IP_ADDRESS].
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as described in section [IP_ADDRESS] , subsections “AE Collection” and “AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines”.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_232680] (AESI) relates to any specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see section [IP_ADDRESS].2 .
The following are considered as AESIs:
∀Severe orthostatic dysregulation as judged by [CONTACT_093]
∀Severe hypotension as judged by [CONTACT_093]
∀Syncope
∀Potential Severe DILI:
A potential severe DILI that requires follow-up is defined by [CONTACT_195900]: 
∀An elevation of AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and/or ALT (Alanine 
Aminotransferase) ≥[ADDRESS_232681] combined with an elevation of 
total bilirubin ≥[ADDRESS_232682] measured in the same blood sample, or in samples 
drawn within 30 days of each other, or
∀ALT and/or AST elevations ≥[ADDRESS_232683].
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the eDC system.
In case of clinical symptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy, unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters areanalysed, if necessary in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the procedures described in the “DILI checklist” should be followed

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_232684]-03 (18.0) / Saved on: 10 Jul [ZIP_CODE].[IP_ADDRESS] Intensity (severity) of AEs
The intensity (severity) of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or symptom(s) that is/are easily tolerated.
Moderate: Sufficient discomfort to cause interference with usual activity.Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_232685] that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:
∀The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug.
∀The event is known to be caused by [CONTACT_23320].
∀A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
∀Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re-introduced.
∀No medically sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, or co-medications).
∀The event is typi[INVESTIGATOR_23239]-related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome).
∀An indication of dose-response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is reduced).
Arguments that may suggest that there is no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:
∀No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre-treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days / weeks of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug concerned).
∀Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_15576], taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half-lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_15577].
∀Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. 
situations where other drugs or underlying diseases appear to provide a more likely 
explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
∀Disappearance of the event even though the trial drug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.

The treatment period in this trial is 20 weeks.  All visit procedures should be completed as 
indicated in the Flow Chart.
6.2.4 Early discontinuation of Treatment
Patients who discontinue treatment prematurely and who do not withdraw their informed 
consent should return for an End of Treatment visit.
If the patient has stopped taking trial drug the day of a scheduled visit, or one day prior, the 
scheduled visits should be performed as an EoT visit.  All samples including PK and all biomarkers ( , UACR and others) should be collected in addition to safety samples. If the early discontinuation does not coincide with a scheduled visit, the patient should return for an EoT Visit.  PK and biomarker samples should not be collected, but all safety assessments must be performed as indicated in the flow chart. 
The patient should be encouraged to complete all visits and procedures in the follow-up 
period (see section 6.2.5 ).  If the patient does not wish to complete all of these visits or 
procedures they should have FUp1 as a minimum.
6.2.[ADDRESS_232708] Period (REP) in this study  is 7 days, visit FUp1 should therefore be 
performed no earlier than 7 days after the End of Treatment Visit.  Follow-up visits FUp2 and FUp3 should also be scheduled relative to the EoT visit, i.e. FUp2 will be 2 weeks after EoT,3 weeks after EoT there will be home sampling without a visit, and FUp3 should be 4 weeks after EoT.
Visit FUp3 may be conducted as a home visit where permitted (see section 6.2.1 ), however 
should a patient have any adverse event(s) that require assessment then the Investigator may 
request they attend the site for a full assessment.
Participation in this trial is concluded once FUp3 has been completed.

SAMPLE SIZE
This is a Phase II, randomised, double-blind (within dose groups), placebo-controlled and 
parallel group trial to investigate the effect of different doses of BI 685509 on UACR reduction over 20 weeks in patients with non-diabetic kidney disease. 
The primary endpoint for patients is Change from baseline in log transformed UACR 
measured in 10-hour urine after 20 weeks of trial treatment. The purpose of this trial is to 
demonstrate PoC (proof of concept) of clinical activity of BI 685509 on the primary endpoint and to determine the optimal dose for phase III. The methodology for dose finding employing both multiple comparison procedures and modelling techniques (MCPMod) will be applied to the [ADDRESS_232710] protecting the overall probability of Type I error (one-sided α of 5 
%). The pre-specified models and their parameters used for this test are outlined in Section 
7.2.1.
7.2 PLANNED ANALYSES
7.2.1 General considerations
The following analysis sets will be defined for statistical analyses:
Entered Set (ES): This patient set includes all patients who signed informed consent. The ES 
will be used for the analysis of patient disposition.
Randomised Set (RS): This patient set includes all entered and randomised patients. The RS 
will be used for the analyses of protocol deviations as well as demographics and baseline characteristics.
Treated Set (TS): This patient set includes all patients who received at least one dose of study 
medication. The TS is used for safety analyses and exposure.

The second primary objective is to determine therapeutic dose. The trial will characterize the dose-response curve for BI 685509 in patients with non-diabetic kidney disease by [CONTACT_58833] 3 doses and placebo. The response is the change from baseline in log transformed UACR measured in 10-hour urine after 20 weeks of trial treatment. Patients will be evaluated in the dose group they were assigned to at randomisation for primary analysis in the MCPMod analysis.The analyses for dose-finding will be performed using MCPMod whereby [CONTACT_195873] (patterns) will be evaluated to identify the best-fitting model or subset of models (refer to Figure 7.5: 1 ). If PoC is established, the statistically significant (best 
fitting) model(s) from the candidate set are refitted to the data to generate new estimates for 
all model parameters from the data. The final model will be obtained via model averaging across the significant models based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The target dose(s) can be estimated from that model by [CONTACT_195910]. Doses within the dose range investigated (0 to 9 mg, total daily dose) will be considered.

drug-related AE. In addition, summary of subjects with down-titration due to AE will be provided.
Frequency, severity, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_195912] (MedDRA).
Laboratory data will be analysed both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the reference range as well as values defined as clinically relevant will be summarised. Treatment groups will be compared descriptively with regard to distribution parameters as well as with regard to frequency and percentage of patients with abnormal values or clinically relevant abnormal values.
Vital signs, physical examinations, or other safety-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the trial and at the end-of-trial evaluation will be assessed with regard to possible changes compared to findings before start of treatment.
Further details will be provided in the TSAP.
7.2.7 Interim Analyses
No interim analysis is planned in this trial.
7.3 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA
In the primary analysis of all continuous endpoints, missing data will not be imputed. 
Missing or incomplete AE dates will be imputed according to BI standards. Handling of missing data for secondary endpoints as well as for sensitivity analysis will be described in the TSAP.
Handling of missing PK data will be performed according to the relevant internal procedures.

Description of change The text in footnote xviii about pre-screening for UACR has 
been moved to footnote iii.  In addition eGFR has been added as a test that patients can be pre-screened for if consent is given
Rationale for change The text about eGFR has been added as this is not always 
done regularly and several patients have failed screening for this.  Allowing pre-screening for eGFR means less unnecessary screening procedures for patients who would not be eligible due to eGFR.
The UACR pre-screening text has been moved as it’s more 
appropriate to have all screening text together.

Section to be changed Section 1.2 Drug Profile
Description of change The following text was added:
Based on recent data from a clinical trial (1366-0020) in 
patients with cirrhosis Child-Pugh stage A (24 patients) and B (25 patients), an effect of BI 685509 on the predicted placebo-corrected change from baseline QTcF ( ∆∆QTcF) was seen. 
Dosing regimens up to [ADDRESS_232762] dose group in this trial, were used.  In both patient groups, there was a dose dependent increase of ∆∆QTcF up to 13.7 ms, with 
the upper 90% CI >20 ms. In one patient group (Child-Pugh 
B) this was concomitant with a change of the predicted placebo-corrected change from baseline heart rate ( ∆∆HR) of 
> 10 beats per minute (bpm), but not in the other patient group. No such effect was seen in a healthy Caucasian volunteers trial (1366-0010) for dosing regimens used in this trial.  In a healthy Asian volunteers trial (1366-0013), at a dose regimen relevant for this study (i.e. starting with 1 mg tid up to a final dose of 3 mg tid), an increase of ∆∆QTcF was 
seen up to 11.7 ms with 90% CI <20 ms, concomitant with an increase of ∆∆HR of nearly [ADDRESS_232763] on human ether-a-go-go related gene 
(hERG) channel at doses used in this clinical trial, and no effect on QT-interval was seen in conscious animal studies.
Rationale for change To provide new information, this also serves as the detailed 
rationale behind the additional measures being included in this amendment

Was changed to 
∀The patient needs to take concomitant medication that 
interferes with the safety of the investigational medicinal product, refer to sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2.  If there is no safety concern then the Sponsor will review on a case-by-case basis as to whether it’s appropriate for the patients to continue.  This decision will be based on factors such as duration of treatment, dose etc. If the patient needs to modify a dose, where a stable dose is permitted only, this will not automatically require a discontinuation. In this case the sponsor should be consulted.
Rationale for change The patient may remain on trial treatment in an exceptional 
case once the patient uses restricted medication, if there are no safety concerns.  The patient will be analysed according to the TSAP.

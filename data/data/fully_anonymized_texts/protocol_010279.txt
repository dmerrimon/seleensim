1. Study Protocol  
Potential participants were Veterans with recurrent binge eating seeking weight loss were recruited from VA’s 
Weight Management Program, MOVE! at two VA sites: West Haven, CT and Northampton, MA between January [ADDRESS_142850] recruited from in -person MOVE! orientation sessions between January 2018 and March 
2020 and then additionally from VA’s remote TeleMOVE! program starting in July 2020. Eligibility required age 21+, Body Mass Index (BMI)>=25, and DSM- 5 clinical/subclinical BED. Exclusions were: attendance of 
more than 4 MOVE! group sessions in the prior year, active psychosis or suicidal ideation, medical or psychiatric illness or cognitive deficits that interfere with providing consent or completing assessments, and pregnancy or lactation. The study received IRB approval by [CONTACT_126838], which provides oversight for both West Haven, CT, and Northampton, MA facilities.  
 1.[ADDRESS_142851] -treatment (3 -months), and 6- and 
12-month follow -ups (9- and 15-months after randomization). Primary outcomes included eating pathology and 
binge eating, secondary outcomes included measures of mental health, quality of life, and other eating behavior. Weight outcomes were explored. Participants were compensated $25 for baseline, $[ADDRESS_142852]- treatment, and 
$50 and then $60 for follow- up assessments.  
 1.2 Diagnostic and Primary Outcomes: Eating Pathology and Binge Eating  
Eating  Disorder  Examination- Interview  17.0th Edition  (EDE) [1] is the structured  diagnostic  interview  that is  
considered  the gold- standard  to diagnose,  and assess the symptoms of, eating  disorders including binge eating  
and eating  disorder pathology. Binge  Frequency was  defined as the average number of  monthly  binge epi[INVESTIGATOR_126834],  and average number of monthly binge  epi[INVESTIGATOR_126835] -
treatment and  follow -up assessments.  Binge Remission  was defined as zero binge epi[INVESTIGATOR_126836].  
 
Eating Disorder Examination -Self-report Questionnaire  (EDE -Q)[2] is the self -report version of the more 
intensive EDE interview. Research has documented that the EDE- Q performs well a s a measure of change in 
treatment trials [3] and has adequate convergence with the interview format[4, 5] . The EDE- Q generates the 
same frequency data for binge eating in the past 28 days, as well as a total score for overall eating pathology and subscale scores for dietary restraint, weight concern and shape concern, and eating concern.  
 
1.3 Secondary Outcomes:  Mental Health, Quality of Life  and Other  Eating  Behaviors 
The Patient  Health  Questionnaire-9 (PHQ -9)[6] is  a 9-item self-report questionnaire used  to assess for the 
presence and  severity  of the symptoms  of depression. The  PHQ-9 has been  shown to  be a reliable  and valid  
measure of depression severity  [7]. The PTSD  Checklist (PCL -5)[8] is  a 20- item self-report measure assessing  
the 20 DSM -5 PTSD  symptoms. The Weight and Eat ing Quality of Life (WE -QOL) [9] is an [ADDRESS_142853] weight and eating has on quality -of-life outcomes [9] . The European 
Quality of Life (EQ -ED-5L)[10] is a 5 -item self -report instrument for measurement of quality of life outcomes 
that has specifically been used in weight loss trials with Veterans[11]. The Loss  of Control Eating  
Scale (LOCES) [12] is  a 7-item scale assessing  the sense of loss of control overeating, an important  BED 
characteristic.  The LOCES has proven to  be valid  and is  significa ntly correlated  with  eating  disturbances,  
general distress,  functional impairment,  and general self -control [12] . The  Night Eating  Questionnaire  
(NEQ) [13] is  a 14- item self-report questionnaire used to measure the severity  of Night  Eating  Syndrome. 
Finally,  the Modified Yale  Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (mYFAS  2.0)[14] is a 13- itme self-administered  scale 
used to assess the features of food addiction. Lower  scores reflect  better  functioning on mental health,  WE-
QOL,  and eatin g behavior measures;  higher scores reflect  better  functioning on the EQ -ED-5L measure.   
 
1.4 Weight Outcomes  
Weight Control Strategies  Scale (WCSS) [15] is  a self -report instrument that  assesses the use of specific weight  
loss behaviors.  The measure  has been  shown to  be valid, reliable,  and predictive of  weight loss [15]. Percent 
Weight Loss and 5% Weight Loss. Height at baseline, and weight at every assessment point, were measured 
with clinic scales f or the in -person cohort and at home for the virtual cohort. Veteran MOVE! participant self-
report of heights and weights have been shown to be reliable [16] . Percent weight loss was calculated with 
baseline weigh t minus the assessment weight and then dividing that number by [CONTACT_126839]. This 
percentage was dichotomized to create a 5% weight loss variable.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_142854]’s first case and then randomly selected audio recordings 
for 10% of CBT sessions thereafter. Recordings were rated on 13 dichotomized items c overing therapeutic 
alliance, session content (skills), homework and goal setting, and session management. Mean scores resulted in 
totals ranging from 0 to 1 with higher scores representing greater adherence.  
 
1.6 Randomization  
Stratified randomization (clinical BED (n=101) and subclinical BED (n=8)) to the two conditions was performed with a computer- generated sequence.  
 1.7 Treatment Conditions  
MOVE! (Treatment -as-Usual)  
All participants received VA’s Weight Management Program, MOVE!, as administered at their site, without 
research staff involvement. MOVE! is an evidence-based behavioral weight management program that includes 
treatment procedures, clinical algorithms, patient and provider information, and instructional materia ls. The 
program was widely disseminated and implemented beginning in January 2006 [17]. The 60-minute groups cycle every 16 weeks and are led by [CONTACT_126840] m onitored MOVE! clinicians who are from the following 
disciplines: primary care, psychology, nutrition, and physical therapy.  Clinicians utilize materials available in hard copy or on-line, and encourage the use of, but do not require or provide, food diar ies. Due to the COVID-
19 pandemic, MOVE! modalities offered for the present study were expanded to include VA's virtual MOVE! and TeleMOVE! programs. Virtual MOVE! involves synchronous delivery of MOVE! groups via VA Video Connect (i.e., telehealth). TeleMOVE! involves asynchronous delivery of MOVE! content via home-based technology and as needed clinician phone contact. Thus, MOVE! in the present study involved two cohorts: 1) in-person  MOVE! (n=40), and 2) virtual  MOVE! or TeleMOVE! (n=69).  
 
Brief, Clinician -led Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for BED 
One-half of participants received CBT in addition to MOVE!. The CBT was administered via [ADDRESS_142855]. Based upon a manual from previous studies [18, 19], the manual was adapted for the VA healthcare user population using iterative input from VA clinicians experienced with Veteran and eating disorde r care, a Veteran 
Engagement Group paid to provide investigators with feedback about the design of Veteran research, and a Veteran who served as one of the study clinicians for this project. The most notable adaptions included person-first language, Vetera n-centered examples, graphical representation of concepts, and writing at the seventh -
grade reading level. Four clinicians received training from the Principal Investigator (PI; RM), feedback on 
videorecording of every session for clinicians’ first two cases, feedback and adherence ratings of 10% of sessions thereafter, and weekly supervision from the PI (RM). Participants completed daily records of food 
intake and binge epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], and these were reviewed and checked weekly by [CONTACT_15098]. The treatment consisted of three overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_126837]. The first phase involved building a collaborative therapeutic relationship, educating the patient about the diagnosis of BED and maintaining factors of binge eating, and utilizing 
behavioral strategies (self-monitoring and goal setting and problem-solving to achieve structured patterning, 
timing and settings for eating). The second phase integrated cognitive skills such that patients learned to identify and challenge maladaptive thoughts and emotional triggers related to eating/restriction and 
weight/shape. The final phase focused on the maintenance of change and relapse prevention.  Brief clinician -led 
CBT was conducted in -person before the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic and by [CONTACT_39364]. 
 
2. Statistical Analysis Plan  
Baseline characteristics were compared between the treatment groups using ANOVA and chi -squares as 
appropriate in order to determine the level of success of the randomization. Distributions of outcomes were examined to determine if assumptions of specific model types were met. Change of model type as well as 
transformation of the data were  considered if model assumptions were not met. Mixed -effects models, a method 
for statistical modeling that uses both fixed effects and random effects, were  used to examine continuous 
outcomes such as eating pathology binge eating frequency, mental health symptoms, and percent weight loss for 
completer, as well as intent -to-treat (all randomized persons) , analyses. Logistic regression models were used 
for categorical outcomes such as binge remission and achieving clinically meaningful weight loss (i.e., 5% weight loss or greater). The outcomes were transformed to approach normality as needed and models controlled for treatment, time, gender, age, and baseline BMI.   2.1 Cohort (in- person vs remote) analyses.  There were 40 (37%) subjects in cohort 1 and 69 (63%) in cohort 2. 
All the analyses with cohort (categorical variable) added to the models were run an d conclusions were 
substantively the same.  
2.2 Missing Data. Missing data was minimized by [CONTACT_126841]. The mixed -effects models addressed missing data for continuous outcomes as the modeling makes 
use of all available data for each participant, even when ther e are different numbers of observations. [79]  
2.3 Missingness analyses. We focused on the missingness of the primary outcome averages binge per month (over past 3 months). Outcome was missing for 11.9% of subjects at month 3, 19.3% at month 9, and 24.8% a t 
month 15. Overall, these 3 timepoints, 35.8% of subjects had incomplete outcome data (missing outcome at any of timepoints). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in missingness at any timepoint or overall (all p -values>=.10). 
 2.4 Variabl es predictive of missingness.  Those with incomplete outcome data were more likely to be male 
(p=.05) and younger (p=.01), and have higher baseline BMI (p=0.03), greater highest weight (p=0.01), better weight quality of life at baseline (p=0.03) and lower food addiction at baseline (p=.03). Gender, age, and baseline BMI were already covariates in the models. We repeated the primary analyses to include the other three variables associated with missingness in the models and conclusions stayed the same.

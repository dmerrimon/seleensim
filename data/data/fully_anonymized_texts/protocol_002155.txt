Background and Purpose  
Cannabis sativa contains more than 100 chemical compounds known as cannabiniods.1 Cannabidiol (CBD) , 
one of the most prevalent co mpounds  in Cannabis,  has no intoxicating effects to users. It s prevalence is 
second only to delta- 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive compound  in cannabis.2 Hemp and 
marijuana are two strains of Cannabis . Hemp contains an abundance of CBD, but no more than 0.3% of THC ;3 
marijuana contains both,  with levels of THC reaching over  30%.4-[ADDRESS_541148] of 2018 removed hemp from this 
classification, which resulted in an explosion of CBD -infused consumer goods  that are under the regulatory 
authority of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) .8 
CBD- infused products , available in small specialty shops as well as  large mainstream retailers , are predicted to 
reach over $[ADDRESS_541149] misperceptions, the  FDA mandates that products containing CBD cannot be marketed 
as having therapeutic benefits  without prior FDA approval.12 The FDA has approved CBD for one drug 
(Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]®) to treat specific epi[INVESTIGATOR_31630].[ADDRESS_541150] is approved or endorsed by [CONTACT_1622],  without such approval.12  
Recently, the FDA issued warning letters to online retailers  for marketing CBD with false claims and illegally 
promoting it as  a drug for  a variety of medical conditions, including preventing Alzheimer’s disease , curing 
cancer  and relieving chronic pain.[ADDRESS_541151] document ed CBD health claims at the point -of-sale. Furthermore, there is substantial

 evidence that retail  advertising influences consumer perceptions and behaviors for other substances (e.g. 
tobacco, food), but no such evidence exists for how CBD health claims impact consumer behavior .  
 
Therefore, the objective of our study  is to inform regulatory science by [CONTACT_428065], evaluate consumer perceptions of them, and evaluate their impact on consumer purchase 
behavior.  
Objective (s) 
The overarching goal of this web survey is to  assess consumer  claim  perceptions  and claim meanings  of CBD 
advertisements  documented in a sample of brick and mortar retailers in North Carolina, Maryland, and 
Colorado, as well as willingness to try, perceived product safety, perceived benefits, and outcome 
expectancies.  
 
Online Consumer Perceptions Survey PROTOCOL  
 
Methods and Measures  
 
Design 
We will conduct a cross- sectional online survey  with a national ly representative probability -based sample of 
adults (ages 18 -65) recruited from the AmeriSpeak  panel, funded and operated by [CONTACT_428066]. All panel members aged 18- [ADDRESS_541152] 30 days (current users), those who have ever used CBD (ever), and those who have never used CBD (non- users) will be invited to participate. We will assess consumer perceptions of documented health claims 
made inside CBD retailers . Given NORC’s estimated response rate of 34% and prevalence estimates for CBD 
use between 14- 25%, we estimate a random sample of 22,000 adults will be screened to achieve our goal of 
3,000 completed surveys consisting or 1,000 current CBD users, 1,000 ever CBD users, and 1,000 non- users. 
AmeriSpeak participants will receive points , worth approximately $5, for completing the survey.  No incentive 
will be provided for completing the screener. Although our goal is to have 3000 completed surveys, we 
anticipate having up to 6 00 additional completed surveys since this is an online survey and we will allow 
anyone who is taking the survey to complete it and receive the incentive. We will monitor the number of 
completed surveys by [CONTACT_428067] a daily basis to achieve the targeted goal of 3000 completes and 
minimize additional surveys over the targeted goal. Thus , our sample size is n= [ADDRESS_541153] 
met both of the following criteria to be included in the study: 1) at least 75% of the outcome variables answered (not skipped) and 2) survey completion time of > 5min. All completed surveys will be used in data analysis.  
 To assess eligibility,  participants will be asked their age and several questions about CBD use.  If eligible, 
participants will be invited to complete the full survey . For the survey, participants will be randomly assigned to 
a panel consisting of up to 10 CBD advertisements that include FDA prohibited or potentially -prohibited claims. 
Participants will complete questions  while the stimuli are shown on the survey webpage .  After the interview, 
participants will receive a link to electronic resources with up -to-date CBD information based on the literature, 
guidance documents from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and organizations including the Center for 
Disease Control (CDC) and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
  
 Setting  
Survey participants will complete the online survey in a location of their choosing.  
 
Subjects Selection Criteria  
AmeriSpeak is an active panel, funded and operated by [CONTACT_428068] C at the University of Chicago that is designed to 
be representative of the U.S. household population. U.S. households are randomly selected within NORC’s 
National Sample Frame and supplemented by [CONTACT_49761] -based sample frames . This is conducted through a two-
stage sampling process. The first stage is the primary sampling unit, which is a National Frame Area of an 
entire metropolitan area or county . The second stage oc curs within this sampling unit. Sec ondary sampling

4 
 units are segments defined from Census tracts or block groups. Within these segments, all housing units are 
listed using the U.S. Postal Service Delivery Sequence File. The final National Frame contains approximately 3 
million households. Selected households are invited to join AmeriSpeak ™ by [CONTACT_428069], and 
participate in research studies 2- 3 times a month. For this study, all 18 -65 year old panel members will be 
screened by [CONTACT_428070] ™. Individuals who are a current CBD user within the past 30 da ys will be invited to 
participate in the study. We will also include a sample of ever -CBD and non- CBD users to understand 
consumer perceptions from those who do not currently use, as well.  W e will oversample CBD users so the 
final respondent sample is comprised of 1/3  current CBD users, 1/3 ever CBD users, and 1/3  never-users. It is 
expected that AmeriSpeak ™ will screen 22,000  adults to obtain the sample size.   
 
(Approxi mately 1,000 current  CBD users; 1,000 ever CBD users, and 1,000 non- users ). Therefore, the survey 
will begin with a short screener survey about CBD use.  
 
Screener  
All interested individuals will be able to complete our screener. Interested i ndividuals will click on the link to the 
survey and be routed to a website to review consent language and complete the survey.  Participants will 
complete a one -minute screener to determine if they are eligible for the full survey based on their age and CB D 
use. If eligible, they will be consented and then proceed to take the survey.  
 Inclusion Criteria  
• Age 18- 65 
• US Residents  
 
Exclusion Criteria  
• Non-English speakers  
• Younger than 18 or older than 65

achieve our goal of 3, 525 completed surveys.   
 
Interventions and Interactions  
Individuals will be contact[CONTACT_428071] ™ to participate in the survey, and if interested, will complete a 
screener to determine eligibility. After completing the screener, participants who are  ineligible will be thanked 
for their time and will exit the survey. They will not receive an incentive for completing the screener . 
Participants who meet eligibility criteria will be invited to complete the full survey. The full survey will last

 approximately 15- 20 minutes. After completing the survey, participants will receive a small incentive in the form 
that they’ve agreed to with their panel (approximately $5).  
 
Outcome Measure(s)  
 
Outcome Measure  
This is a post -test only experimental design. The primary outcome is claim perception by [CONTACT_428072] . We 
will determine if advertisements are interpreted by [CONTACT_428073] (i.e. drug effect; FDA approved/endorsed; dietary supplement; food additive; 
false/misleading- youth; false/misleading- science ). We will assess this using the following items, all of which will 
use a 5 -point response scale, (1) Not at all to (5) Extremely.  
 
To assess drug effect claims, all participants will be asked “ How much does this ad suggest  that CBD can 
cure, prevent, or treat a health condition?”   
To assess FDA endorsement claims, participants will be asked “How much does this ad suggest that the 
advertised CBD is approved or endorsed by [CONTACT_428074] (FDA)?”   
To assess dietary supplement or vitamin claims, participants will be asked “How much does this ad suggest 
that CBD is a dietary supplement or vitamin?”   
To assess food additive claims, participants will be asked “How much does this ad suggest CBD is a main 
ingredient in a food or beverage?   
To assess if a claim is false and misleading participants will be asked “How much does this ad suggest the information shown is based on scientific evidence?”  and “How much would this ad appeal to youth 
under the age of 18?”   
 We will also assess perceived product safety , appeal and perceived benefits, outcome expectancies, and 
willingness to try  CBD (non -CBD users only). For CBD users, we will ask additional questions about their use 
of CBD (i.e. frequency, product type, reasons for use, and use with other cannabinoids). All participants will be 
asked about their demographic and health status.  
 
Analytic Plan  
 
The goals of the  analysis are to 1) determine if CBD use status is associated with interpreting our main 
outcome and secondary outcomes (main = claim perception as one of the prohibited claim types, secondary = 
appeal of advertisements and perceived product safety) ; 2) identify which claims are interpreted by [CONTACT_428075]; and 3 ) explore participant characteristics  (beyond use 
status) that are  associated with interpreting a claim as one of the prohibited claim  types . 
First, analyzing all claims together, we will assess the mean score for each claim type ( i.e. drug effect; FDA 
approved/endorsed; dietary supplement; food additive; false/misleading -youth; false/misleading -science ) to determine 
if CBD use status is associated with interpreting ads as containing one of the prohibited claim types. We will 
also assess the mean for perceived product safety and appeal by [CONTACT_428076]. For each of the advertisements , 
we will then estimate the proportion of participants that interpret the claim as one or more of the prohibited 
claim types (i.e. drug effect, FDA approved/endorsed; dietary supplement; food additive; false and misleading). 
Chi-squared tests will compare proportions between CBD users and non- users. N ext, analyzing all claims 
together, w e will model the likelihood of interpreting a claim as a prohibited claim type as a function of CBD use 
status, sex , race/ethnicity , claim meaning score, and chronic health conditions  using random -effects logistic 
regression modeling to account for the repeated measures within an individual. Odds ratios from the models 
will be used to identify differences between groups  in their perceptions of claims. All statistical tests will be two -
sided with a 0.[ADDRESS_541154] Recruitment Methods

6 
 Participants will be recruited and screened by [CONTACT_428070] ™ according to age (18 -65) and CBD use status 
(current CBD (users within the last 30 days), ever CBD users, and non- users ). All panel members who are 18 -
65 years old will be screened for the survey, and those who are classified as a CBD user, ever user, or non-
user will be invited to participate in the study. Eligible participants will continue to review the informed consent 
and complete the full survey.    
Informed Consent  
A waiver of signed consent/assent s requested. This is an online survey and individual participation involves 
providing voluntary responses to survey questionnaires. The research presents no more than mi nimal risk of 
harm to subjects.  Consent language will be included in the survey  and participants will be asked to check a 
box to indicate that they agree to participate.

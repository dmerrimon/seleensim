 3 1.0  OBJECTIVES  
1.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:  
1.1.1 To evaluate if Xofigo can reduce symptomatic skeletal events (SSE) in patients with 
NSCLC and bone metastases who have had stable  or responding disease following initial 
systemic chemotherapy.  
 
1.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:  
1.2.[ADDRESS_111891] of treatment with Xofigo on alkaline phosphatase levels in patients 
with NSCLC and bone metastases.  
 
1.2.5 To measure progression -free survival and overall survival of patients with NSCLC and bone 
metastases  and stable or responding disease after front -line chemotherapy treated with  Xofigo.   
 
2.0  BACKGROUND  
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC):  Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer 
death worldwide, with an estimated 1,600,000 new cases and 1,380,000 deaths per year.1 In the 
[LOCATION_002], there are an estimated 228,000 new c ases of lung cancer and 159,500 deaths, 
yearly.2  
Bone Metastases from NSCLC:  Approximately 50% of patients with advanced lung cancer will 
develop progressive bone metastases during the course of their illness.3 Bone metastases from 
NSCLC are frequently symptomatic leading to significant morbidity d ue to pain, pathologic 
fracture  and neural compression. Primary treatment has relied upon radiation therapy.3-6 Local 
external -beam radiation can be effective in patients with a small number of metastases, but its 
clinical utility in patients with disseminated metastatic bone disease is limited by [CONTACT_101424]. The potential for toxicity to neighboring tissues at an effective radiation 
dose can also limit retreatment to certain sites. Chemotherapy can be helpful until the disease 
becomes refractory.3 
Bisphosphonates and Denosumab in NSCLC and Bone Metastases:  Bisphosphonates have  a 
modest  impact in reduction of skeletal related events in NSCLC and other solid tumors.7-9 In the 
phase III study of zoledronic acid for patients with bone metastases from solid tumors, the time to 
a skeletal related event was increased from 163 days to 230 days with zoledronic acid versus 
  
5/31/14, 8/25/14, 8/26/14, 9/2/14, 9/5/14, 9/10/14, 10/21/14, 12/2/14 IND Exemption, 12/8/14, 12/17/14,1/8/15,

 4 placebo. In this study, approximately 40% of patients with bone metastases from NSCLC had a 
new skeletal related event within [ADDRESS_111892] primarily on osteoclasts and do not treat metastases directly. 
Furthermore, they each are associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw.7-10 
Radium -223 (Xofigo):  Xofigo is an alpha -particle emitting radiotherapeutic drug (radium -223 
dichloride) which mimics calcium and forms complexes with hydroxyapatite at areas of increased 
bone turnover, such as bone metastases.11 Xofigo targets bone metastase s by [CONTACT_101425] -
energy, short -range (<100 um) alpha -particles. These alpha particles can potentially provide 
greater dose to the exact site of bone metastases while also reducing marrow toxicity due to their 
shorter path length. 12 The phase III, doub le blind ALSYMPCA study randomized patients 2:1 to 
receive Xofigo, 6 injections every 4 weeks or placebo. Xofigo significantly improved overall 
survival in patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer (median overall survival 14.9 versus 
11.3 months; P  < 0.001).[ADDRESS_111893] Front -line Treatment of NSCLC and Optimal Role for Xofigo:  The initial 
treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC who do not have a driver mutation (EGFR or ALK 
mutation) involves combination chemotherapy for [ADDRESS_111894] new 
symptomatic skeletal  event s within the next 4 months.7,8 It is within this period following 
completion of front -line chemotherapy that this protocol will investigate Xofigo.

 7 within +/ - 3 days  of cycle due date ). Treatment delays of up to 14 days due to patient, physician 
or facility scheduling issues should be reported but will not constitute a deviation. Weight used 
for drug order is to be from pre -cycle assessment (done within 7 days prior to cycle start). 
Patients are to be dosed based on drug order weight and weight collected the day of dosing, prior 
to dosing, is to only be used to confirm patient’s weight has not changed by [CONTACT_726] 10% (see 
section 5.1). Patient’s dose is not to be adjusted based on day o f weight.  
For dosing please refer to appendices  F and G   
 
Filling of the syringe should take place in a safety bench or similar in the radiopharmacy/Nuclear 
Medicine department. Personnel should wear medical gloves and  eye protection during syringe 
filling  to prevent contamination of the radioactive solution to  skin and eyes. The individual 
responsible for study drug preparation will draw the correct volume of study drug into a syringe.  
 
The syringe should be handed over to the nuclear medicine personnel who will perform the 
injection. There is no need for shielding from alpha particle radiation during preparation and 
administration of the patient doses. (Alpha particles from radioactive decay of radium -223 and 
progeny are easily stopped by [CONTACT_101426] o f a sheet of a paper or the walls of a glass vial.)  
 
Aseptic technique should be used in the administration of Xof igo. The agent is administered as a 
slow bolus intravenous injection. After administration, the equipment  used in connection with the 
preparat ion and administration of drug, are to be treated as  radioactive waste and should be 
disposed in accordance with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101390].  
 
In general, the administration of radioactive drugs involves a potential risk fo r third parties, due 
to radiation from the patient and due to possible contamination by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_101391]. When 
Xofigo has been injected intravenously into a patient, the risk for  external radiation exposure to 
third parties is extremely low, due to the short range of the  alpha particles (<100 μm) and the very 
low portion of beta and gamma radiation. For these reasons the product can be administered on an 
outpatient basis.  
 
Patients are informed to practice good hygiene for at least 1 week after stud y administration 
including washing hands, flushing the toilet several times after each use and washing clothes that 
are soiled with stool or urine promptly and separately from other clothes.  
 
4.1 Duration of Treatment  
Xofigo will be administered every 4 weeks for a maximum of 6  treatments. See 5.2 for reasons 
for study discontinuation . (Treatment should be administered within +/ - 3 days). Treatment 
delays of up to 14 days due to patient, physician or facility scheduling issues should be reported 
but will not constitute a deviation.

required to be met before dosing cycle 1:  
 ANC must be > 1.5 prior to day 1 dose  of treatment (cycle 1)  
 (PLT) count must be ≥ 100,000/mm3 prior to day 1 dose of treatment (cycle 1)  
 Hemoglobin (Hgb) must be  > 9g/dl prior to day 1 dose of treatment (cycle 1)  
 
A new course  (cycle 2 -6) of treatment should not begin until the following criteria are met:  
 Platelets > 50,000x109/L 
 Granulocytes >1000x109/L (1000/mm3) 
 Recovery from other treatment related, non -hematologic toxicities to < Grade 2    
 Diarrhea < grade 2  
 Nausea or vomiting < grade 2 or to baseline levels  
 If the patient does not meet these criteria delay day 1 until these requirements are met.  
Patients who require a treatment delay of more than 4 weeks from the scheduled treatment 
day due to toxicity will be removed from prot ocol treatment.  
 
**Weight prior to cycles [ADDRESS_111909] again be 
assessed the day of drug administration , but this weight is only to be used to confirm  patient’s 
weight  has not change d by > 10% since the prior assessment pre -dosing (for example 7 days  
prior ). If weight has not changed by >10% then , the patient is considered okay to treat. See 
section 6 sub script K for more details**  
 
5.2   Dose Modification /Study Discontinuation   
Toxicity:  NCI common toxicity version [ADDRESS_111910] ment of dose level is not permitted.   
•  Blood transfusion  at baseline  is acceptable  to obtain baseline value of  >9 and between 
study drug administrations , but not on the same day as Xofigo administration. Use  of 
biologic myeloid growth factors such as G -CSF, is allowed in the management of acute 
toxicity.  
Gastrointestinal events:  
Diarrhea should be treated as per local institutional practice s.  The next cycle should not be gin 
before diarrhea is recovered to CT CAE v4 Grade 2 or less .  
Nausea or vomiting should be treated as per local practice.  A further dose of study medication 
should not be given before nausea or vomiting is recovered to CTCAE v.4 Grade 2 or baseline 
levels.  
Xofigo will be permanently discontinued for the following:

 9  Symptomatic Skeletal Event:  
- Pathologic fracture :  Pathologic fractures are to be treated in a manner that attempts to 
maintain the best functional status and quality of life. Study treatment should be 
discontinued if the pathologic fractures are due to disease.  
- Spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377] : If the patient e xperiences spi[INVESTIGATOR_101392], the patient should be treated for the event, and may not receive further 
study drug administration.  
- Radiation therapy to bone  
- Surgery to bone  
 
 Patients with lung cancer progression requir ing treatment with chemotherapy, radiation 
or surgery.  
 Unacceptable toxicity (see section 5)  
 Surgical Intervention: If surgery is required, and not due to disease progression, the 
patient may continue with study treatment, following a period of at least 4  weeks, if this 
is considered safe in the treating Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  
 Non-pathological fractures: For traumatic fractures in weight -bearing bones during 
treatment phase, the study drug administration should be discontinued.  
 Incidental, asymptomatic new or worsening bone metastases will not require 
discontinuation of Xofigo.

11/30 /[ADDRESS_111925] manufacturer  
Algeta’s  Institute for Energy Technology, Isotope laboratories, Kjeller, Norway. The product is 
produced according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The product will be delivered in a 
glass vial, ready -to-use w ith a certified activity. Radium Ra 223 dichloride is shipped in a lead 
container and Type A radioactive package according to international transportation guidelines for 
radioactive materials.  
 
The volume per vial is 6 mL, corresponding to 6 MBq (6.[ADDRESS_111926] update) at the reference day.  Radium Ra 223 dichloride has a shelf life of 28 days from 
production day, when stored at ambient temperature. The shelf life has been demonstrated for 
temperatures from cold storage (2 -8°C) up to 4 0°C. In addition, it has been shown that the 
product quality is not jeopardized upon freezing.  
 
All study drugs will be labeled according to the requirements of local law and legislation. For all 
study drugs, a system of numbering in accordance with all re quirements of GMP will be used, 
ensuring that each dose of study drug can be traced back to the respective bulkware of the 
ingredients  
9.1.2  Mechanism of Action   
The active moiety of Radium Ra 223 dichloride is the alpha particle -emitting isotope radium -223 
(as radium Ra 223 dichloride), which mimics calcium and forms complexes with the bone 
mineral hydroxyapatite at areas of increased bone turnover, such as bone metastases. The high 
linear energy transfer of alpha emitters (80 keV/micrometer) leads to a hi gh frequency of double -
strand DNA breaks in adjacent cells, resulting in an anti -tumor effect on bone metastases. The 
alpha particle range from radium -223 dichloride is less than 100 micrometers (less than 10 cell 
diameters) which limits damage to the surr ounding normal tissue.  
 
9.1.3  Instructions for use/ handling  
9.1.[ADDRESS_111927] to the regulations and/or appropriate licenses of the competent official organization. 
Radium 223  dichloride should be handled by [CONTACT_30799] a manner which satisfies both radiation 
safety and pharmaceutical quali ty requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken.  
 
9.1.3 .2 Radiation protection  
The administration of Radium Ra 223 dichloride is associated with potential risks for other 
persons (e.g. medical staff, care givers and members of the patient ’s family) from radiation or 
contamination from spi[INVESTIGATOR_101393], feces, or vomit. Therefore, radiation 
protection precautions must be taken in accordance with national and local regulations.  
 
 
 
For drug handling  
Follow the normal working procedures for the handling of radiopharmaceuticals and use 
universal precautions for handling and administration such as gloves and barrier gowns when 
handling blood and bodily fluids to avoid contamination. In case of contact [CONTACT_101427], the 
affected area should be flushed immediately with water. In the event of spi[INVESTIGATOR_101394] 
  
5/31/14, 8/25/14, 8/26/14, 9/2/14, 9/5/14, 9/10/14, 10/21/14, 12/2/14 IND Exemption, 12/8/14, 12/17/14,1/8/15,

 15 223 dichloride, the local radiation safety officer should be contact[CONTACT_101428]. A complexing agent 
such as 0.01 M ethylene -diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution is recommended to remove 
contamination.  
 
For patient care  
Whenever possible, patients should use a toilet and the toilet should be flushed se veral times after 
each use. When handling bodily fluids, simply wearing gloves and hand washing will protect 
caregivers. Clothing soiled with Radium Ra 223 dichloride or patient fecal matter or urine should 
be washed promptly and separately from other clot hing.  
 
Radium -223 is primarily an alpha emitter, with a 95.3% fraction of energy emitted as alpha -
particles. The fraction emitted as beta -particles is 3.6%, and the fraction emitted as gamma -
radiation is 1.1%. The external radiation exposure associated wit h handling of patient doses is 
considerably lower in comparison to other radiopharmaceuticals for therapeutic purposes as the 
administered radioactivity will usually be below 8 MBq (0.216 mCi)  8.8MBq(0.238mCi  after 
implementation of  NIST . In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_101395] (ALARA) 
principle, for minimization  of radiation exposure, it is recommended to minimize the time spent 
in radiation areas, to maximize the distance to radiation sources, and to use adequate shielding. 
Any unused produc t or materials used in connection with the preparation or administration are to 
be treated as radioactive waste and should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations.

determine the decay correction factor, count the number of days before or after the reference date.  
The Decay Correction Factor Table includes a correction to account for the 7 hour time difference 
between 12 noon Central European Time (CET) at the site of manufacture and [ADDRESS_111930], 
which is 7 hours earlier than CET.  
Immediately before and after ad ministration, the net patient dose of administered radium -223 
should be determined by [CONTACT_101429] a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable radium -
[ADDRESS_111931] (a new reference vial will be sent to each center corresponding to the updated NIST 
reference material) and corrected for decay using the date and time of calibration. The dose 
calibrator must be calibrated with nationally recognized standards, carrie d out at the time of 
commissioning, after any maintenance procedure that could affect the dosimetry and at intervals 
not to exceed one year.  
As of December 2015, Bayer visited the Nuclear Medicine department located at the Miriam 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101396] m the  new [ADDRESS_111932] reference material for establishing the 
revised dial setting on the  dose calibrator.  The Nuclear medicine de partment was informed that 
the new dial setting is not to be used until  Bayer  has obtained approval from the FDA of an  
activation date  in the 2nd quarter of 2016.  Additionally Bayer has agreed to send notification via 
memo to BrUOG  of the implementation date  and the memo has been approved at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s 
IRB.  Radium Ra 223 dic hloride can be measured in a normal dose calibrator instrument. 
Different clinical study centers possess dose calibrators  from various suppliers; thus, the isotope 
calibration factor may differ from center to center. Consequently, each center must perform the 
Radium Ra 223 dichloride dial setting on their relevant dose calibrator(s). For dial setting, the 
clinical study center will receive a sealed vial containing a Radium Ra 223 dichloride solution for 
calibration only. The vial is identical to the vials u sed for study treatment. The amount of Radium 
Ra 223 dichloride in the vial will be stated on the label. Instructions for the dial setting, including 
the calibration log form, will be enclosed with the dispatch of the calibration sample.

11/30 /[ADDRESS_111933] Stand ardization Update  
 
The quantification of radium -223 radioactivity in Xofigo (radium -223 dichloride;  BAY 88 -8223) 
is based on the primary standardization performed by [CONTACT_101430].  National Institute of 
Standards and Technology prepares the standard reference material (SRM) using an official dial 
setting (primary standardization) as published ( 17).The NIST SRM is used to calibrate the 
instruments in production and quality control fo r both the drug substance and drug product. 
Additionally, the NIST SRM is used to prepare the NIST traceable Ra -223 reference materials 
which are then sent to the end -users (e.g., nuclear medicine laboratory physicians or technicians) 
for dial -setting of t heir dose calibrators, to allow verification of the patient dose.  
In 2014, NIST performed a re -assessment of the primary standardization based on preliminary 
information suggesting a potential discrepancy of approximately 8 -10% between the published 
NIST primary standardization ( 17) and results obtained by [CONTACT_101431] 
([LOCATION_008], [LOCATION_013], Japan). After completion of there -assessment, NIST reported their 
findings ( 18) and had issued a revised NIST SRM in 2015.The discrepancy in the NIST 
standardization was determined to be −9.5% between activity values obtained using the old 
reference standard relative to the new primary standardization. Consequently the current 
numerical values need to be corrected by [CONTACT_101432]. + 10.5%.

new dial settings until the site IRB  has received and approved the Bayer activation memo 
documenting the implementation date for the change.   
The change in the numerical description of the patient’s dose, product strength and labeled vial

9.1.6 Dosimetry  
The absorbed radiation dose calculation was performed based on clinical biodistribution data. 
Calculations of absorbed doses were performed  using OLINDA/EXM (Organ Level INternal 
Dose Assessment/EXponential Modeling), a software based on the Medical Internal Radiation 
Dose (MIRD) algorithm, which is widely used for established beta and gamma emitting 
radionuclides. For radium -223, which is pr imarily an alpha emitter, additional assumptions were 
made for the intestine, red marrow and bone/osteogenic cells to provide the best possible 
absorbed dose calculations for Radium Ra 223 dichloride, considering its observed 
biodistribution and specific c haracteristics.  
 
For an administered activity of 3.65 MBq (0.0987 mCi) (50 kBq (0.[ZIP_CODE] mCi)  (55kBq (.[ADDRESS_111937] update)  per kg body weight to a 73 -kg adult), the calculated absorbed doses to the 
bone (osteogenic cells) is 4.2050 Gy (420.5 rad) and t o the red marrow is 0.5066 Gy (50.66 rad).

small intestine wall, 0.1180 Gy (11.8 rad) for the upper large intestine wall and 0.1696 Gy (16.96 
rad) for the lower lar ge intestine wall.  
The calculated absorbed doses to other organs are low, e.g. heart wall (0.0063 Gy, 0.63 rad), lung 
(0.0003 Gy, 0.03 rad), liver (0.0109 Gy, 1.09 rad), kidneys (0.0117 Gy, 1.17 rad), urinary bladder 
wall (0.0147 Gy, 1.47 rad), testes (0. 0003 Gy, 0.03 rad), and spleen (0.0003  Gy, 0.03 rad).

9.1.9 Dose preparation  
Personnel should use appropriate protective clothing and equipment during syringe filling and 
application to prevent contamination with the radioactive solution (medical gloves / protective 
glasses). The individual responsible for study drug preparation will draw the correct volume of 
study drug into a syringe. The size o f the syringe should be chosen according to the applied 
volume to reach the required dosing accuracy. Radium Ra 223 dichloride should not be diluted or 
mixed with any solutions. Do not store above 40°C (104°F). If the vials have been stored in a 
refrigerat or, they should be left at room temperature for [ADDRESS_111939] be well hydrated; the patient should be 
instructed to  drink ad libitum. Aseptic technique should be used in the administration of Radium 
Ra 223 dichloride. The syringe should be handed over to the individual who will perform the

 19 injection. The study medication will be administered as a bolus intravenous (IV)  injection (up to 1 
minute). After administration, the equipment used in connection with the preparation and 
administration of drug is to be treated as radioactive waste and should be disposed in accordance 
with local procedure for the handling of radioact ive material. The short penetration of the alpha 
particles allows for the use of standard radiation protection measures dur ing shippi[INVESTIGATOR_101397]. S tandard dose calibrators and  regular contamination monitors  are used during

thus waste can be stored for [ADDRESS_111940] common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) in patients receiving Radium Ra 223 dichloride 
were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting , and peripheral edema . Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were 
reported among 57% of Radium Ra 223 dichloride -treated patients and 63% of placebo  treated 
patients. The most common hematologic laboratory abnormalities in Radium Ra 223 dichloride -
treated patients (≥ 10 %) were anemia, lymphocytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and 
neutr openia . Treatment discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 17% of patients who 
received Radium Ra 223 dichloride and 21% of patients who received placebo.  
 
The most common hematologic laboratory abnormalities leading to discontinuation for Radium 
Ra 223 dichloride were anemia (2%) and thrombocytopenia (2%).

As an adverse reaction, grade 3 -4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 6% of patients on 
Radium Ra 223 dichloride and in 2% of patients on placebo. Among patients who received 
Radium Ra 223 dichloride, the laboratory abnormality grade 3 -4 thrombocytopenia occu rred 
in 1% of docetaxel naïve patients and in 4% of patients who had received prior docetaxel. 
Grade 3 -4 neutropenia occurred in 1% of docetaxel naïve patients and in 3% of patients who 
have received prior docetaxel.  
 
Fluid Status  
Dehydration occurred in 3% of patients on Radium Ra 223 dichloride and 1% of patients on 
placebo. Radium Ra 223 dichloride increases adverse reactions such as diarrhea, nausea, and 
vomiting which may result in dehydration. Monitor patients’ oral intake and fluid status 
carefully and promptly treat patients who display signs or symptoms of dehydration or 
hypovolemia.

resulting from therapeutic exposure may r esult in higher incidence of cancer (e.g. sarcomas of 
the bone, or leukemia), mutations and a potential for development of hereditary defects.  
 
Bone Marrow Suppression  
In the randomized trial, 2% of patients on the Radium Ra 223 dichloride arm experienced 
bone marrow failure or ongoing pancytopenia compared to no patients treated with placebo. 
There were two deaths due to bone marrow failure and for 7 of 13 patients treated with 
Radium Ra 223 dichloride, bone marrow failure was ongoing at the time of death.  Among the 
13 patients who experienced bone marrow failure, 54% required blood transfusions. Four 
percent (4%) of patients on the Radium Ra 223 dichloride arm and 2% on the placebo arm 
permanently discontinued therapy due to bone marrow suppression.  
In the  randomized trial, deaths related to vascular hemorrhage in association with 
myelosuppression were observed in 1% of Radium Ra 223 dichloride -treated patients

Myelosuppression; notably thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, and leukopenia; 
has been reported in patients tre ated with Radium Ra 223 dichloride. In the randomized trial, 
complete blood counts (CBCs) were obtained every [ADDRESS_111942] administration of Radium Ra 223 dichloride, the 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, the plate let count ≥ 100 x 109/L 
and hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL. Before subsequent administrations of Radium Ra 223 dichloride, 
the ANC should be ≥ 1 x 109/L and the platelet  count ≥ 50 x 109/L. Patients with evidence of 
compromised bone marrow reserve should be monitored  closely and provided with 
supportive care measures when  
clinically indicated. Discontinue Radium Ra [ADDRESS_111943] 
not been established. Outside of a clinical trial, concomitant use with chemotherapy is not 
recommended due to the potential for additive myelosuppression. If chemotherapy, other 
systemic radioisotopes  or hemibody external radiotherapy are administered during the 
treatment period, Radium Ra 223 dichloride should be discontinued.  
 
10.0 AGENT ACCOUNTABILITY  
Agent Inventory Records  – The investigator, or a responsible party designated by [CONTACT_093], 
must maintain a careful record of the inventory and disposition of all agents received from 
manufacturer using a Drug Accountability Record Form.  The nuclear medicine department  will 
maintain records of drug receipt drug preparation, and dispensing, including the applicable lot 
numbers. Any discrepancy between the calculated dose and dose administered and the reason for 
the discrepancy must be recorded in the source documents.  
It is required that each drug order form and drug destruction form be sent to the BrUOG office for 
tracking and record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 
Destruction and Return  
At the end of the study, unused supplies of Ra [ADDRESS_111944] ug. 
 
  
5/31/14, 8/25/14, 8/26/14, 9/2/14, 9/5/14, 9/10/14, 10/21/14, 12/2/14 IND Exemption, 12/8/14, 12/17/14,1/8/15, 
Amendment #1 5/19/15 approved Bayer, Amendment # 2 2/19/16, Amendment # 3 3/3/16 , Amendment # 4 
11/30 /[ADDRESS_111945] Form. The certificate of 
destruction for Ra 223 dichloride should be sent to BrUOG each time.  
   
10.1 Treatment Compliance  
Records of study medication used, dosages administered, and intervals between visits will be 
recorded during the study. Drug accountability will be noted.  
 
All drugs will be administered to eligible patients under the supervision of the investigator or 
identified sub -investigator( s).  The nuclear medicine department  will maintain records of drug 
receipt drug preparation, and dispensing, including the applicable lot numbers. Any discrepancy 
between the calculated dose and dose administered and the reason for the discrepancy must be 
recorded in the source doc uments.  
 
11.0 ADVERSE DRUG REACTION (ADR) REPORTING  
BrUOG considers the SAE reporting period to begin when the subject signs the study specific 
informed consent.  
 
This study will utilize the descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common 
Terminolo gy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version [ADDRESS_111946] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4. A copy of the 
CTCAE version 4can be downloaded from the CTEP web site (http://ctep.cancer. gov).  
 
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have to 
have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can  therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of Xofigo ® whether or not considered related to Xofigo ®. This includes 
any newly occurring event or previ ous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since 
the administration of drug.  
 
During clinical trials, adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended 
questioning, examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects 
should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more adverse events.)  
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded in the case report form for the duration of the trial, 
regardless of whether or not the ev ent(s) are considered related to trial medication. All AEs 
considered related to trial medication will be followed until resolution even if this occurs post -
trial.

Amendment #1 5/19/15 approved Bayer, Amendment # 2 2/19/16, Amendment # 3 3/3/16 , Amendment # 4 
11/30 /16 
 23 An adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes (CFR 
312.32):  
 death  
 is life -threatening  
 inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101398], transfusional support, disease staging/re -staging procedures, 
concomitant radi otherapy, thoracentesis / paracentesis, or placement of an indwelling 
catheter, unless associated with other serious events.  
 persistent or significant disability or incapacity,  
 congenital anomaly / birth defect.  
 
The definition of serious adverse event (e xperience) also includes important medical event . 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in  death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79467].  These should 
also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive t reatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. A new diagnosis 
of cancer during the course of treatment should be c onsidered an important medical event.  
 
The definition of “related” being that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the 
adverse experience . 
 
Unexpected adverse event  
An adverse event that is not mentioned in the Investigator's Brochure or package insert or the 
specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the investigator's brochure or package 
insert.  
 
Life-threatening  
Any adverse drug experience that places the patient or subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate ris k of death from the reaction as it occurred.  It does not include a reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
11.2 Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation  
Adverse events, both serious and non -serious, an d deaths that occur during the patient’s study 
participation will be recorded in the source documents.  All SAEs should be monitored until they 
are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or 
intercurrent illn ess(es).  
 
11.3 BRUOG ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS   
Investigators are required by [CONTACT_101433]. Question 
regarding drugs as used in this study should be directed to the Brown University Oncology 
Research Group (BrUOG) Central Office, Phone: (401) 863 -3000 Fax (401) 863 -3820, which 
will in turn notify the Principal Investigator.  
 
  
5/31/14, 8/25/14, 8/26/14, 9/2/14, 9/5/14, 9/10/14, 10/21/14, 12/2/14 IND Exemption, 12/8/14, 12/17/14,1/8/15,

11/30 /16 
 24 Intensity for each adverse event will be scored using CTCAE Version 4.  A copy of the CTCAE 
Version 4can be downloaded from the CTEP homepage ( http://ctep.info.nih.gov ).  All 
appropriate treatment areas have access to a copy of the CTCAE Version 4.  All adverse clinical 
experiences, whether observed by [CONTACT_56313],  must be recorded, 
with details about the duration and intensity of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the action taken with respect to the 
test drug, and the patient’s outcome.  The investigator must evaluate each adverse experience for 
its relationship to the test drug and f or its seriousness.  
 
11.3.[ADDRESS_111948]’s last 
dose of study drug are considered expedited reportable events.  If the subject is on study drug, the 
study drug is t o be discontinued immediately.  The pregnancy must be reported to the Brown 
University Oncology Research Group with 24 hours and BrUOG will in turn report to Bayer 
within 24 hours (1 working day) of the Investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy by [CONTACT_101434]/or facsimile using the SAE Form. Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a 
positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the 
subject is on IP, or within 4 weeks (30 days) of the subject’s last dose of IP, are considered 
immediately reportable events. IP is to be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy, suspected 
pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Bayer Drug Safety immediately by 
[CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method (to b e done by [CONTACT_101435]), using the Medwatch3500A form 
(MedWatch 3500A -to be completed by [CONTACT_3725]).  
 
The Investigator will follow the subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must notify Bayer 
(by [CONTACT_101436]) of the outcome as specified below.  The Investi gator will provide this 
information as a follow -up to the initial report .If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria 
for immediate classification as a SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly 
detected in an aborted fetus is to be doc umented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital 
anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs (i.e., report the event 
to BrUOG who will then report to Bayer by [CONTACT_31950] 24 hours (1 working day) of being 
made aware o f the event).  
 
Any suspected fetal exposure to Xofigo ® must be reported to BrUOG within 24 hours who will 
then report to Bayer within 1 working day of being made aware of the event.  The patient should 
be referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienc ed in reproductive toxicity for further 
evaluation and counseling.  
 
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_111949] to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator suspects  to be 
related to the in utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported. In the case of a live 
“normal” birth, Bayer should be advised as soon as the information is available.  
 
If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the male 
subject taking IP should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be 
advised to call their healthcare provider immediately.

Phone:    [PHONE_2341]  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_101399]’s (BrUOG) office who in return will report to the FDA, 
Bayer, and all sites participating in the trial.  All SAE reports will be forwarded to Bayer Product 
Safety by [CONTACT_101435]. All events reported to the FDA by [CONTACT_101437] 3500A (MedWatch Form).  Sites must alert BrUOG to SAEs within [ADDRESS_111953] 5 business days to submit formal notification via the 3500A  (5 days 
from date of being notified of event) . BrUOG will then alert Bayer within 1 business day  when 
possible . BrUOG will submit the SAE memo, and Medwatch 3500A to the FDA within 7 days.  
 
Expedited Reporting by [CONTACT_101438] (SAE) are defined above.  All events must be reported, by [CONTACT_101439], 
to the Brown University Oncology Research Group who must inform Bayer in writing using a 
MEDWATCH 3500A form  of any SAE within 1 business day  (when possible)  of being aware of 
the event .  The written report must be completed and it will then be supplied by [CONTACT_101440] 24 hours/1 business day  (when possible)  of BrUOG being made aware of the 
event .  The initial report must be as complete as possible, including an assessment of the causal 
relationship between t he event and the investigational product(s), if available.  Information not 
available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the adverse event or laboratory

 26 values received after the report) must be documented on a follow -up report.  A fi nal report to 
document resolution of the SAE (such as discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) is required.  The Bayer 
tracking number ( ONC -2014 -099) and the institutional protocol number should be included on 
SAE reports (or on the fax cover letter) sent to Bayer .  A copy of the fax transmission 
confirmation of the SAE report to Bayer should be attached to the SAE and retained with the 
study records at BrUOG. (Bayer does NOT send a confirmation so BrUOG will have to use 
documentation from their fax that it was sent ) 
All adverse events and special reporting situations, whether serious or non -serious, related or 
unrelated, will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until [ADDRESS_111954] withdraws conse nt from study participation (declines 
participation) or at the time patient becomes a screen failure, whichever occurs first . 
All deaths during treatment or within [ADDRESS_111955] be reported to 
BrUOG within 24 hours of the investigator being made aware of the event.  
 
Any serious adverse event occurring after the patient has provided informed consent and until 4 
weeks (30 days  +1 week ) after the patient has stopped study participation must be reported. This 
includes the period in which the study protocol interferes with the standard medical trea tment 
given to a patient (e.g. treatment withdrawal during washout period, change in treatment to a 
fixed dose of concomitant medication).  If a patient begins a new therapy AE evaluation is to stop 
but SAEs are to continue if SAE is thought to be possibly related to Xofigo.  
 
Serious adverse events occurring more than 4 weeks after study discontinuation need only be 
reported if a relationship to the Bayer study drug (or therapy) is suspected.  
For Comparator Drugs/Secondary Suspects (Concomitant Medications) , all serious adverse 
experiences will be forwarded to the product manufacturer by [CONTACT_093].  
 
11.4 Reporting requirements and procedures depend upon:  
1. Whether investigational agents are suspected of causing toxicity;  
2. Whether the possibility of such a toxicity was reported in the protocol, consent form, or 
manufacturer’s literature (Expected toxicity); and  
3. The severity of grade of the toxicity.   
 
11.5 Assessing Causality:  
Investigators are required to assess whether t here is a reasonable possibility that treatment caused 
or contributed to an adverse event.  The following general guidance may be used:  
 
Yes: if the temporal relationship of the clinical event to treatment administration makes a  
causal relationship possib le, and other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions 
do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
 
No:if the temporal relationship of the clinical event to treatment administration makes a  
causal relationship unlikely , or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.

BrUOG will send to: Bayer via Email: [EMAIL_772]  
 
b. IND Annual Reports, for IND study only  
If the FDA has granted an IND number, it is a requirement of 21 CFR 312.33, that an annual 
report is provided to the FDA within 60 -days of the IND a nniversary date.   21 CRF 312.33 
provides the data elements  that are to be submitted in the report.   The Annual Report should be 
filed in the study's Regulatory Binder, and a copy provided to Bayer Corporation as a supporter of 
this study as follows.  
11.9 A dverse event updates/IND safety reports  
Bayer shall notify the Brown University Oncology Research Group (BrUOG) via an IND Safety 
Report of the following information:  
 Any AE associated with the use of study drug in this study or in other studies that is bo th 
serious and unexpected.  
 Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human 
subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  
 
BrUOG will then notify the sites who shall notify their IRB/ EC promptly of these new serious 
and unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
 
 
12.0 REMOVAL OF PATIENTS FROM PROTOCOL THERAPY  
Extraordinary medical circumstances or withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_102]: If, at any time, the 
constraints of this protocol are detrimental to the patient's health, and/or the patient no longer wishes 
to continue protocol therapy, the patient sh all be withdrawn from protocol therapy.  Patients will also 
be withdrawn from study for the following reasons:  
1. Disease Progression: Any patient with disease progression should be removed 
from study  as per section 7.1 and 7.2 .  Details and tumor measurements should 
be documented on flow sheets.  
2. Patient is unable to tolerate the toxicity resulting from the study treatment, even with 
optimal supportive care, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_101401]. Adverse event(s) that, in the 
judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or permanent harm or wh ich rule out 
continuation of study drug.  
3. The physician feels it is in the best interest of the patient to stop the treatment.  
4. Inter current illness that would, in the judgment of the Investigator, affect assessment of 
clinical status to a significant degr ee or require discontinuation of study treatment

14.[ADDRESS_111963]:  
Any change or addition (excluding administrative) to this protocol requires a written protocol 
amendment that must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_101443], 
Bayer and the investigator before implem entation. Amendments significantly affecting the safety 
of subjects, the scope of the investigation or the scientific quality of the study require additional 
approval by [CONTACT_112].  A copy of the written approval of the IRB must be 
provi ded to Brown University Oncology Research Group, and Bayer.  
 Examples of amendments requiring such approval  
 Increases in drug dose or duration of exposure of subjects  
 Significant changes in the study design (e.g. addition or deletion of a control group)  
 Increases in the number of invasive procedures  
 Addition or deletions of a test procedure required for monitoring of safety.  
These requirements for approval should in no way prevent any immediate action from being 
taken by [CONTACT_101444].  If an immediate change to 
the protocol is felt to be necessary by [CONTACT_101445] y Oncology Research Group and Bayer must be notified and the IRB at the 
center must be informed immediately. Amendments affecting only administrative aspects of the 
study do not require formal protocol amendments or IRB approval but the IRB must be kept 
informed of such administrative changes.

 34 All trials initiated by [CONTACT_101448] (BrUOG) are subject to 
oversight by [CONTACT_16627] (DSMB).  This board  meets two times per year 
with any additional meetings scheduled when needed.  The responsibilities are as follows:  
 Familiarize themselves with the research protocol (s)  
 The DSMB reviews trial performance information such as accrual information.   
 Review interim analyses of outcome data and cumulative toxicity data summaries to 
determine whether the trial should continue as originally designed, should be changed, or 
should be terminated based on these data.   
 The DSMB also determines whether and to whom ou tcome results should be released 
prior to the reporting of study results.  
 All adverse events are reviewed by [CONTACT_942], with assurances that these have been 
in fact sent for review to all pertinent IRBs.  
 Review of reports of related studies to determine whether the monitored study needs to be 
changed or terminated.  
 Review major proposed modifications to the study prior to their implementation (e.g., 
termination, droppi[INVESTIGATOR_101404], 
increasi ng target sample size).  
 Following each DSMB meeting, provide the study leadership with written information 
concerning findings for the trial as a whole related to cumulative toxicities observed and 
any relevant recommendations related to continuing, changi ng, or terminating the trial.  
 
The study leadership will provide information on cumulative toxicities and relevant

Angela Taber , in collaboration with Brown University Oncology Research Grou p (BrUOG), 
which will serve as the central coordinating office for the study.  
You are being asked to take part in this study because you ha ve been diagnosed with advanced 
lung cancer which has spread to your bones. You have already received standard chemotherapy 
for your lung cancer .  
In this study you will receive the medicine Xofigo which is a radioactive drug that is FDA 
approved to treat  prostate cancer that has spread to the bones. Cancer that has spread to the bones 
can cause pain and increase t he risk of a broken bone (fracture) by [CONTACT_101450]. If the 
cancer has spread to the bones of your spi[INVESTIGATOR_101407] a risk that a damaged bone could put 
pressure on your spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], causing paralysis. In patients with prostate cancer  that had spread t o 
the bones , treatment with Xofigo reduced the risks of bone pain and fractures and prolonged 
survival.  Xofigo has not previously been tested to treat lung cancer that has spread to the bones. 
Your doctors are studying the effects, good and bad, of Xofigo  when used to treat lung cancer 
that has spread to the bone s. 
This study is supported by [CONTACT_8996], the makers of Xofigo . 
How Many People will take part in the Study?  
We expect to enroll a pproximately 36  subjects into this study. The study is sponsored by [CONTACT_101451] [INVESTIGATOR_101408], MD.

You should drink plenty of fluids (at least 2 liters/day) the day that you receive Xofigo.  
How long will I be in the study?  
You will receive Xofigo for up to six months (6  treatments) or as long as your cancer does not 
grow or spread or cause worsening bone pain or a fracture for which you require surgery or 
radiation and you do not have s evere side effects from Xofigo . After completion of Xofigo , you 
will be followed for u p to 1 year for survival.  
 
 
Off study and follow -up: 
 
 Your physician may decide to order CT scan s of your chest , abdomen , and pelvis  or PET 
scans  in follow -up as necessary  
 Physical examination inclusive of vital signs, weight, toxicity assessment, performance 
assessment.  
 Toxicity assessment again approximately [ADDRESS_111973] dose of Xofigo  
 Blood tests (about 3 tablespoons)  
 Quality of life questionnaires  
 Follow -up for disease status and survival information every 2-3 months for 1 year 
 
Can I  stop being in the study?  
Yes. You can decide to stop at any time.  Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_101409].  He or she will tell you how to stop safely.   
It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking abo ut stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_101410].  Another reason to tell your 
doctor that you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_60769] -up care and testing 
could be most helpful for you.

You may have side effects while on this study.  We will monitor everyone in the study for any 
side effects. Contact [CONTACT_101454] a side effect or have any questions about 
possible side  effects.  
 
Side effects may be mild or serious.  We may give you medicines to help lessen side effects.  
Some side effects will go away as soon as you stop taking the drug.  In some cases, side effects 
can be serious, long -lasting, or may never go away. Ta king part in this study may lead to time 
away from work.  
 
Xofigo  
The following side effects are expected to occur in less than 20% of patients  
 Nausea  
 Diarrhea  
 Vomiting  
 Swelling in the hands and legs  
 Low red blood cells (which can cause fatigue)  
 Low white blood cells (which can increase the risk of infection ). 
 Low platelets (which can increase the risk of bleeding ). 
 Inflammation and pain at the injection site.  
 Kidney damage  
 Dehydration.  
 
Risk of Secondary Cancers or Leukemia: Xofigo may increase t he risk of other cancers or 
leukemia (a blood cancer).

 41 In general, when a person is given a radioactive drug, there is a potential risk for the pe ople 
around you, due to radiation from your body and due to possible contamination by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_101412] . When Xofigo has been injected into a patient, the risk for external radiation exposure to 
other people is extremely low, due to the short range of the radiation particles in Xofigo (less than 
1mm , which is less than one -twenty -fifth of an inch). For thes e reasons the product can be 
administered on an outpatient basis. However, you should practice good hygiene including  
washing hands, flushing  the toilet several times after each use and washing clothes that are soiled 
with stool or urine promptly and sepa rately from other clothes , for _ 7__ days after each Xofigo 
treatment . 
 
Reproductive Risks  
Xofigo  may decrease sperm count. This is usually temporary but is infrequently permanent, 
which would result in sterility. Because the drugs in this study can affect an unborn baby, you 
should not become pregnant while on this study Ask your study doctor for mor e information 
regarding preventing pregnancy during the study treatments.  You should not nurse your baby 
[CONTACT_56035]. If you are premenopausal, your periods are likely to stop temporarily and 
may stop permanently due to the study treatments, which may lead to symptoms of menopause, 
such as hot flashes, and the inability to become pregnant, which may be permanent. If you are 
concerned about this, ask your study doctor about options for preserving your reproductive 
choices, which may include referral to a specialist in this field.   
By [CONTACT_101455].  
Antiemetics (anti -nausea medications): Various medications used to prevent and treat nausea 
and vomiting may cause drowsiness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation, headache, restlessness, 
agitation, anxiety, dizziness, involuntary tremors, skin rash, and possible allergic reaction.  
 
Venipuncture (inserting a needle into a vein to o btain blood or give medication): May cause 
inflammation, pain, bruising, bleeding, or infection.  
When you receive Xofigo  by [CONTACT_59570], there is a slight risk that some of the drug may leak out around 
the needle at the injection site. A skin burn may result. Mos t skin burns are treatable and heal 
well.  
In order to monitor the side effects, your physician will examine you frequently and obtain 
laboratory tests (blood tests, chest x -rays, or CT scans as needed) to determine the effects of your 
treatment.  
Risk of CT  imaging:  CT imaging uses x -rays. The radiation dose associated with this procedure 
is estimated to be a small fraction of the annual permissible dose to an x -ray technologist.  
There may be other side effects that have not been reported. If you have any un usual symptoms, 
you should report them immediately to your doctor or nurse.

11/30 /[ADDRESS_111974] if I do not take part in this study?  
You have just finished receiving standard chemotherapy for lung ca ncer. You may already be 
taking another medicine to reduce the risk of bone pain or frac ture. Other options may include  
 Additional chemotherapy  
 Radiation  
 Observation  
 Taking part in another study  
 Getting no treatment  
 Getting comfort care, also called palliative or supportive care. This type of care helps reduce 
pain, tiredness, appetite proble ms, and other problems caused by [CONTACT_62565]. It does not treat 
the cancer directly, but instead tries to improve how you feel. Comfort care tries to keep you 
as active and comfortable as possible.  
 
Talk to your doctor about your choices before you decide if you will take part in this study.  
 
Refusal/Withdrawal  
It is up to you whether you want to be in the study.  You are not required to enroll or participate.  
If you decide to participate, you can always change your mind and quit at any time.  If you decid e 
not to be in the study, or if you quit later, you will still be able to get the health care services you

Medical Treatment/Payment in Case of Injury  
A resear ch injury is any physical or mental injury or illness caused by [CONTACT_98690]. If 
you are injured by a medical treatment or procedure you would have received even if you 
were not in the study that is not a research injury. To help avoid research injur y and added 
medical expenses, it is very important to follow all study directions carefully. If you do 
experience a research injury, <INSERT HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_101405]>   or the study doctor can arrange 
medical treatment for you. Such treatment will be paid for as descr ibed below.  
 
Medical treatment will be available if you suffer a research related injury; however, you 
and/or your health insurance company will be charged for this treatment. The study will not 
pay for this medical treatment.  Neither [CONTACT_101471] , the sponsor of the study, nor 
BrUOG, the coordinating center, nor Bayer, the maker of the drug Xofigo, have money set 
aside to reimburse you for medical bills from treatment of a research related injury or 
otherwise compensate you in the event of a study -related injury.  
 
If you have insurance and have a research injury that is not covered by [CONTACT_1758], it is 
possible that some or all of the cost of treating you could be billed to your insurer. If your 
health insurance will not cover such costs, it is possibl e you would have to pay out of pocket. 
In some cases, <INSERT HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_101405]>   might be able to help you pay if you qualify 
for free care under <INSERT HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_101405]>   policy. However, <INSERT HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_101413]>   has no policy to cover payment for such things a s lost wages, expenses other than 
medical care, or pain and suffering.

 56 APPENDIX F:  
Treatment for use pre -Bayer activation memo for NIST standards:  
 
The current dose calibration is referenced to the [ADDRESS_111986] and corresponds to 
50KBq/kg.  
 
 
The volume to be administered to a given patient should be calculated using the:  
 
– Patient’s body weight (kg)  
– Dosage level 50 kBq/kg body weight  or 1.35 microcurie/kg body weight –
 Radioactivity concentration of the product (1 ,000 kBq/mL; 27 microcurie/mL  at the 
reference date  
– Decay correction factor to correct for physical decay of radium -223. 
 
The total amount (volume to be drawn into the syringe) to be administered to a patient should be 
calculated as follows:  
 
Volume to  be administered (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (50 kBq/kg b.w)  
                                                          DK factor x 1,000 kBq (0.027 mCi)/mL  
 
 
A table with decay correction factors will be provided with each vial of Xofigo.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Weight used for drug order is to be from pre -cycle assessment (done within 7 days prior to cycle start). 
Patients are to be dosed each cycle based on drug order weight and weight collected the day of dosing 
(prior to dosing), is to only be used to confirm patient ’s weight has not changed by [CONTACT_726] 10% (see 
section 5.1). Patient’s dose is not to be adjusted based on day of weight.

Treatment:  
The revised  dose  55kBq/kg  corresponds to the new NIST standard reference material (NIST 
2015 ), which is to be  used upon IRB approval of Bayer activation memo but cannot be used prior 
to the date indicated in Bayer activation memo  expected in 2Qof 2016.  
 
 
 
The volume to be administered to a given patient should be calculated using the:  
 
– Patient’ s body weight (kg)  
– Dosage level 55 kBq/kg body weight or 1.49 microcurie /kg body weight –
 Radioactivity concentration of the product 1,100 kBq/mL;29.7 microcurie/mL at the 
reference date  
– Decay correction factor to correct for physical decay of radium -223. 
 
The total amount (volume to be drawn into the syringe) to be administered to a patient should be 
calculated as follows:  
 
Volume to be administered (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (55 kBq/kg b.w)  
                                                          DK factor x 1,100 kBq (29.7 microcurie)/mL  
 
 
 
A table with decay correction factors will be provided with each vial of Xofigo.  
 
 
Weight used for drug order is to be from pre -cycle assessment (done within 7 days prior to cycle 
start). Patients are to be dosed each cycle based on drug order weight and weight collected the 
day of dosing (prior to dosing), is to only be used to confirm patient’s weight has not changed by 
[CONTACT_726] 10% (see section 5.1). Patient’s dose is not to be adjusted based on day of we ight.

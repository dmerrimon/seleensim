3. Abstract:  
 
Loss of mobility and cognitive ability are serious conditions that threaten the independence of 
older adults. Importantly, both of these conditions are mechanistically linked by [CONTACT_694547]. Frontal lobe dysfunction  has been implicated as a factor contributing 
to gait deficits in some individuals with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia and 
vascular dementia. There is a critical gap in knowledge about what therapeutic strategies are 
effective for maintaining  or reinstating function in this critical brain region in order to preserve 
physical and cognitive health in older adults. The goal of our research is to develop a novel 
therapeutic intervention to enhance both mobility and cognition via neuroplasticity of  
frontal/executive control circuits. We will engage neuroplasticity of frontal circuits in two ways. 
The first is through neurorehabilitation with “complex walking tasks” (CWTs), such as obstacle 
crossing, obstacle avoidance and walking on non -uniform surf aces. CWTs are a potent 
behavioral approach for engaging prefrontal circuits. Furthermore, CWTs are crucial to 
successful ambulation in the home and community settings and therefore provide an 
ecologically valid therapeutic approach. The second approach th at we will use to engage 
neuroplasticity of frontal circuits is anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Anodal 
tDCS is a safe, non -invasive neuromodulation technique. It has previously been shown to 
induce excitatory effects on brain tissue and, in single -session assessments, to improve 
performance during complex walking tasks. tDCS has also been shown to be an effective 
adjuvant for enhancing the effects of cognitive training. The objective of this study is to calculate 
effect size, establis h variance of response and demonstrate feasibility of the experimental 
interventions in order to plan for a full scale clinical trial. Participants will include thirty older 
adults who demonstrate evidence of frontal/executive impairment. Participants will  be 
randomized to one of three groups: 1) standard walking neurorehabilitation with sham tDCS 
(‘standard/sham’ group), 2) complex walking neurorehabilitation with sham tDCS 
(‘complex/sham’ group), or 3) complex walking neurorehabilitation with active anoda l tDCS 
(‘complex/active’ group). Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will be used to explore 
intervention -induced changes in prefrontal cortical activity. Assessments will be conducted at 
baseline, post -treatment and 3 -month follow up. We propose  the following specific aims:  
Specific Aim 1: Determine preliminary efficacy for recovery of mobility and cognitive function.  
Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate feasibility/safety of tDCS as an adjuvant to rehabilitation.  
Specific Aim 3: Explore the relationship between prefrontal activity and behavioral outcomes  
The data collected here will provide the information needed to justify and plan a future full scale 
clinical trial to assess the relative efficacy and underlying mechanisms of each interventi on 
approach.

4. Background:  
 
Age-related mobility deficits and/or cognitive deficits are present in a large proportion of older 
adults. Those who have mobility deficits have higher rates of morbidity and mortality, more 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], poorer quality  of life, and are less likely to remain independent. Those who 
have cognitive deficits experience reduced ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living 
and have a reduced quality of life. Standard therapeutic approaches are insufficient for 
addressing age -related impairment of physical and cognitive function. There is a clear and 
urgent need for alternative or adjuvant strategies that can directly target specific mechanisms of 
impairment in order to yield greater gains. Deficits in cerebral fun ction are known to affect 
cognition, and are also likely to be an important mechanism contributing to mobility deficits.  
Physical interventions that are designed to target cerebral mechanisms may not only improve 
walking function, but may also improve cog nitive function. Directly combating age -related 
dysfunction of frontal/executive circuits may considerably enhance mobility and cognitive 
function.  
The important role of cerebral structure and function on walking and cognitive ability is made 
clear by [CONTACT_694548]/disease such as stroke, 
traumatic brain injury, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s Disease. A less appreciated issue is 
that older adults also exhibit substantial but sub -clinical impairments of cerebral structure and 
function. These impairments include (but are not limited to) reduced intracortical excitability, 
reduced cortical thickness, loss of gray matter volume and increased presence of white matter 
hyperintensities [42-49]. Accu mulating evidence indicates that age -related degradation of the 
brain is a common and important factor contributing to decline of mobility and cognition.  
Frontal cerebral circuits are particularly important because they have broad effects on executive 
functions that are important to planning, initiating and coordinating both cognitive and motor 
behaviors. Our recent research suggests that older adults who exhibit a greater level of 
prefrontal cerebral activity (measured by [CONTACT_694549]) during complex walking task s also perform 
those tasks better . Evidence also indicates that the prefrontal cortex and other frontal lobe brain 
regions are particularly susceptible to age -related dysfunction . The prefrontal cortex is an 
important component of multiple major cerebral circuits that have been linked to walking 
function.  
Neurorehabilitation of Walking  
Neurorehabilitation is a behavioral therapeutic approach for enhancing the neural control of task 
performance. Our neurorehabilitation intervention for walking will incorporate many evidence -
based principles of motor recovery including:  
Restoration of function : We seek to restore walking function through neuroplastic adaptations of 
locomotor circuitry. We will discourage the use of compensatory movement strategies or 
assistive devices because such approaches may limit or counteract the neurophysiological 
adaptations that we seek to  promote.  
Specificity of training : Rehabilitation is most effective when targeting specific neural circuits that 
underlie behavioral deficits.  
Sensory input to the nervous system :  Sensory input in this context refers to movement 
strategies that promote ta sk-appropriate afferent activity. A number of proprioceptive and 
somatosensory factors are known to be important for triggering initiation and performance of 
gait cycle events. These include achieving sufficient limb loading and leg extension to promote 
robust forward propulsion, followed by [CONTACT_694550]201602317  Page 3 of 13

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 2/19/2019  swing phase. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_694540], hip 
extension and symmetry during key events/phases of the gait cyc le. 
Intensity, Repetition and Progression of training : Neuroplasticity requires repeated and intense 
practice. Furthermore, progression of intensity ensures a high training stimulus even as 
capability improves.  
We will use two neurorehabilitation interven tions: steady state walking (control intervention) and 
complex walking tasks (experimental intervention). The objective of the complex walking task 
intervention is to engage frontal/executive circuits to induce beneficial activity -dependent 
neuroplasticity  (e.g., synaptic connectivity). We have previously shown that complex walking 
tasks are a potent approach for engaging prefrontal cortex during walking. Furthermore, 
complex walking tasks are important and ecologically valid because they are crucial to 
successful mobility in the home and community environments.  
Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and augmentation of mobility and cognition  
tDCS will be used to induce positive neuromodulation of frontal/executive circuits to make them 
more amenable  to the “activity -dependent neuroplasticity” that is known to occur with behavioral 
neurorehabilitation. Specifically, tDCS may facilitate the efficacy of our walking 
neurorehabilitation intervention by [CONTACT_694551].  Deeper frontal circuits may also experience neuromodulation through applied field 
effects. tDCS involves the application of a weak electrical current through two or more 
electrodes placed on the scalp. The principal mechanism of action is  subthreshold modulation of 
neuronal membrane potentials, which alters cortical excitability and neuronal activity dependent 
on the current flow direction through the target neurons. We propose that integrating anodal 
tDCS into a neurorehabilitation interv ention will increase its effectiveness. Indeed, the 
neurocognitive literature reveals evidence that  modulatory effects accumulate when tDCS is 
applied during multiple, consecutive sessions, and that tDCS effects are most prominent when a 
consolidation peri od is allowed. Furthermore, applying tDCS during practice of the desired 
functional task has been found to trigger effects that outlast the stimulation period and facilitate 
longer term neuroplasticity.

1st Informed Consent  and Onsite Screening  
 
Upon arriving to the research site, participants will undergo informed consent for screening and 
functional assessments.  All questions from the phone screening will be repeated, and 
additional  health/medical  screeni ng criteria will be evaluated  as noted in the table below . As part 
of screening, we will explain in the detail the full study protocol including rehabilitation 
intervention with transcranial direct current stimulation.  
 
Screening will usually occur over two separate study visits, occurring within a span of about 1 -2 
weeks.  The following assessments will be conducted  during the screening visit : 
• 10-meter walking speed  
• NIH Toolbox : A subset of the NIH Toolbox cognitive battery will be conducted, with 
emphasis on tests of attention, executiv e functions, and working memory. This testing 
can be completed in 30 minutes.  
• Activities Specifi c Balance Confidence Scale : The ABC Scale is a 16 -item questionnaire 
that gauges confide nce (on a scale of 0 -100%) on various balance and walking tasks 
relevant to household and community ambulation.  
• Tests of foot tactile sensation. This includes touching a vibrating probe  to the foot, as 
well as  pressing plastic probes or monofilaments (similar to hairbrush bristles) of vari ous 
size/stiffness to the sole of the fo ot to determine sensitivity of  sensation.  
• Resting blood pressure    
• Basic visual examination  with standard eye chart  
• Height, weight, age, sex  
• Obtain list of medications that the participant is currently using

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 2/19/2019  • Walking test with active or sham transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS). For full 
details about tDCS, please see section below (Rehabilitation Intervention; Transcranial 
direct current stimulation). This test serves two purposes . One is to allow th e participants 
to experience tDCS prior to enrolling in the study intervention . This will help to fully 
inform the participants and may help us to avoid drop -outs. The second purpose is to 
allow us to collect cross sectional data to assess whether  active tDCS aids with motor 
learning in the context of walking. This is consistent with the overall aims of the study. 
The walking test will involve a walking course of [ADDRESS_942193], participants may be asked to wear an accelerometer (activity monitor) 
so we can assess how smoothly they walk. They may also be asked to wear sensors on 
their fingers that measure s kin conductivity, which  is a probe o f sympathetic nervous 
system arousal.  
• Videos and/or photos may be taken during assessments to document the functional 
abilities of participants, and for possible use in research presentations or education. At 
the time of consent, participants will choose w hat their videos/photos can be used for. 
We will avoid capturing images of the participants face, and will delete any such images 
that are accidentally captured.  
 
Following the screening visit, study staff will evaluate performance/responses relative to the 
following study enrollment criteria. Individuals who meet all criteria will be invited to enroll in the 
full study (i.e., the rehabilitation intervention).

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 2/19/2019  At the discretion of the Principal Investigator, any individual may be deemed ineligible for further 
participation in  any component of  this study if there are concerns about the individual’s 
capability to perform study procedures  or if it may be unsafe for the volunteer to participate in 
the study.  Furtherm ore, minor exceptions to the inclusion/exclusion criteria may be permitted at 
the discretion of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_102742]. 
For example, small deviations from the target range of walking speed or cogn itive performance. 
This is important to ensure that individuals are not excluded for insignificant reasons and to 
facilitate meeting enrollment benchmarks.  
___________________________________________________________________________  
 
2nd Informed Consent  and Baseline Assessment  
 
Participants will complete a 2nd informed consent in order to take part in the full study 
procedures.  All study procedures will be described in detail and all questions will be answered.  
 
Assessment sessions  
 
Assessments will be conducted at the following time points:  
Baseline - generally within two weeks before starting the intervention  
Post-Intervention  – generally within one week after completing the intervention  
3-month follow -up - generally about three months after completing the intervention  
 
The following assessments will be completed at each intervention:  
 
Walking  and Balance  Tests  
 
Figure -[ADDRESS_942195]: this test  involves walking in straight and curved paths and was designed to 
represent walking skill in everyday life [92]. It has been shown to be associated with executive 
functions and performance on various other mobility -related tests  in older adults  [92]. 
Other “complex” walking tasks: Participants will be asked to perform a battery of walking tasks 
that are designed to be similar to conditions that are encountered in the home and community 
settings. These tasks may include walking over/around obstacles, walking while carrying an 
object, walking in dim lighting, walking while performing a cognitive tas k, walking up/down stairs, 
walking over a soft foam surface (exercise mats), walking backwards, gait initiation, gait 
termination, and/or similar tasks, and/or or a combination of these tasks.  
 
Quiet standing on a force platform :  This test measures center of pressure and sway during 
quiet standing  with eyes open and with eyes closed.  
 
Berg Balance Scale : A 14-item scale designed to measure balance of the older adult in a clinical 
setting.  
 
During these tests, prefrontal cortical activity wil l be recorded with functional near infrared 
spectroscopy, which is described below.  Participants may also be asked to perform these tasks 
while wearing textured shoe insoles that mildly increase sensation from the soles of the feet.  
 
Cognitive Tests  
 
NIH EXAMINER : this is a computer based standardized assessment that tests  the 
cognitive /executive  domains of planning, set shifting, working memory, inhibition, and fluency. It 
calculates separate factor scores for each domain as well as a composite executive score . 
Tower of Hanoi : the objective of this puzzle is to move a stack of differently sized disks from one 
rod to another while obeying the following rules: only one disk can be moved at a time; a disk 
can only be moved if it is the upp ermost disk on a stack; no disk may be placed on top of a 
smaller disk. The time and number of moves to complete the puzzle will be recorded.

IRB v ersion 03.09.04  
PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 2/19/2019  Trail making Tests A & B : The task requires a subject to connect a sequence of [ADDRESS_942196]: in the first, the targets are all numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) and the test taker 
needs to connect them in sequential order. In the second part, the subject alter nates between 
numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B, etc.). The goal of the test is for the subject is to finish both parts 
as quickly as possible, with the time taken to complete the test being as the primary outcome . 
Digit Span Test : memory span is the longest  list of items that a person can repeat back in 
correct order immediately after presentation. The task is known as digit span when numbers are 
used.  
 
During all cognitive tests, prefrontal cortical activity may be recorded with functional near 
infrared spectroscopy, which is described below.  
 
Functional near infrared spectroscopy  (fNIRS)  
 
fNIRS is a safe non -invasive technology for indirectly assessing cortical activation based on 
changes in blood flow and oxygenation. Sensors are placed on the forehead, and produce 
infrared light that is able to pass through the skull and is absorbed or reflected by [CONTACT_694555].  Infrared light is considered safe and there is no sensation association 
with this procedure.   Calculations made  from the relative amount of ligh t absorption/reflection 
provide  an estimate of the metabolic activity level of underlying cortical tissue.  We will use a 
commercially available fNIRS monitor ( Octamon  by [CONTACT_173408]).  
 
Sympathetic nervous system activity measured by [CONTACT_694556], participants may be asked to wear sensors on their fingers 
that measure s kin conductivity, which  is a probe of sympatheti c nervous system arousal.  
___________________________________________________________________________  
 
Rehabilitation Intervention  
 
Participants will take part in a 6 -week, 18 -session neurorehabilitation led by [CONTACT_694557]. Participants will be randomized to one of three groups: 1) standard 
walking neurorehabilitation with sham tDCS (‘ standard/sham’ group ), 2) complex walking 
neurorehabilitation with sham tDCS (‘ complex/sham’ group ), or 3) complex walking 
neurorehabilitation with active anodal tDCS (‘ complex/active’ group ). Training logs will be 
maintained to gauge the content and intensity of training. To cont rol for intensity, participants 
will maintain a rating of perceived exertion of 4 (moderate to strong) on the Borg Category/Ratio 
Scale during walking. Exertion will be adjusted by [CONTACT_694558]/or by [CONTACT_694559] b outs.  Training logs will also include information on attendance 
and adverse events. From these logs we will determine adherence (# of sessions attended), 
retention (completion of rehabilitation and post -therapy assessment) and number of adverse 
events.   
 
Complex Walking Task Intervention  
 
Two of the three experimental groups will tra in using complex walking tasks. All of the complex 
walking tasks that we use have been used previously in our research protocols and/or have 
been previously reported in the rehabilitation research literature and/or are components of 
validated clinical instruments. Accordingly, all of the  tasks have been demonstrated to be 
feasible and appropriate for use in our cohort. The following walking tasks will be used: over 
obstacles, navigating around obstacles, changing speeds, on soft surfaces ( exercise  mat), in 
dim lighting, while conversing w ith the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], up/down ramps and climbing/descending stairs.

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 2/19/[ADDRESS_942197] Current Stimulation (tDCS)  
 
During therapy session, all participants will receive active or sham tDCS, which is a mild form of 
non-invasive brain stimulation.  The electrode placement for the tDCS is designed to engage the 
frontal lobes bilaterally.  tDCS will be applied and operated by [CONTACT_694560] (with all required training in human subjects research) who have been thoroughly trained 
in the use and safety of tDCS by [CONTACT_20685].  
 
Active  tDCS:  For each session, a Soterix Direct Current Stimulator will apply up to [ADDRESS_942198] current through two biocarbon rubber electrodes encased in saline soaked 5cm2 
sponges (10cc of 0.9% saline solution) placed over the frontal cortices at F3 a nd F4 ( based on 
the “10-20 system ” of brain mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ). Current inflow will occur on the right (F4), and outflow on 
the left (F3). Impedance quality will be ≤10kΩ to insure proper stimulation of brain tissue.  
Sham tDCS:  Sham stimulation is performed with the  same device and all procedures will be 
identical except for the duration of stimulation. Participants will receive [ADDRESS_942199] current stimulation at the beginning of the session. Participants habituate to the sensation 
of tDCS within 30 -60 seconds of stimulation. This procedure provides the same sensation of 
tDCS without the full duration of stimulation, making it a highly effective sham procedure.  
 
During assessment or rehabilitation sessions, v ideos and/or photos may be taken during to 
document the functional abilities of participants, and for possible use in research presentations 
or education. At the time of consent, participants will choose what their videos/photos can be 
used for. We will avoid capturing images of the participants fa ce, and will delete any such 
images that are accidentally captured.

Post -Intervention Assessment and 3 -Month Follow -Up Assessment  
 
The procedures will be identical to what is described for the baseline assessment

7. Possible Discomforts and Risks:  
As with all physical activity, there is a risk of falling while we test or train walking ability. Falls ca n 
lead to injuries ranging from minor to serious. It is also possible that participants could experience 
musculoskeletal injury such as an ankle sprain. It is possible that the participant may experience 
fatigue, soreness, and discomfort due to physical ac tivity associated with this study. These are 
unlikely to be worse than what he/she would experience due to increased physical activity outside 
of our study. These are normal responses to exercise and  most discomfort would  gene rally 
disappear within a matter of days.  In general, walking exercise is strongly recommended for all 
adults, including elderly adults with medical conditions.  
Transcranial direct current stimulation is considered safe but some  people do experience some 
side effects.  The most common side effects are itching and tingling or mild discomfort at the 
area of stimulation, and headache.  Other possible  but uncommon  side effects include dizziness 
and nausea.  Whenever an electrical stimulation is applied to the body, it could possibly cause a

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 2/19/[ADDRESS_942200] current 
stimulation parameters used in this study.  tDCS will be applied and operated by [CONTACT_694561] (with all req uired training in human subjects research) who have been 
thoroughly trained in the use and safety of tDCS by [CONTACT_20685].  
fNIRS is considered safe.  The infrared light used in assessment is not known to cause any harm 
to alter the brain in any wa y.  The sensors are secured to the participant’s  head using adhesive 
tape, which may cause minor skin irritation in some people, or more substantial irritation in people 
who are sensitive/allergic to adhesives.  We will check with participants about any kn own 
sensitivities to adhesives.  
There is a risk that participant s may find cognitive and functional tests challenging or 
uncomfortable if they have  difficult y succeeding with the tasks.  Participants  may skip any 
question that they do not wish to respond do . 
 
8. Possible Benefits:  
 
There is no direct benefit to the participant.  
 
9. Conflict of Interest:  
 
None.  
 
10. Statistical Analysis Plan  
This is an R21 study that is designed to acquire data for planning a full scale clinical trial. 
Summary statistics will be provided for all primary measures, as well as for demographic and 
clinical characteristics. For the primary outcome of each hypothesi s, group mean differences 
and standard deviations will be used to calculate effect sizes. With this information we will be 
able to conduct a power analyses to plan for a future full -scale clinical trial.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board  
This study will use the Pepper Safety Committee for data and safety monitoring.  This 
committee , henceforth called the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  is used for most studies 
that are affiliated with the UF Claude Pepper Older America ns Independence Center. The three 
members of this committee have no affiliation with the study. The committee meets every 6 
months.

Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse events (including expected, unexpected, serious and non -serious) will be tracked i n a 
cumulative table. Adverse events will be reported according to the guidelines of the University of 
[LOCATION_012] Institutional Review.  Specifically, adverse events that are serious and unexpected  (see 
definitions below) will be reported to the UF IRB within  5 working days of when study personnel 
learned about it.  Reports of adverse events that are not serious or that are expected (e.g., 
muscle soreness) will be added to the cumulative adverse event table and reported to the UF 
IRB annually.  
A serious advers e event  is any adverse event that results in any of the following outcomes:   
• death,  
• a life -threatening adverse event,  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102750],  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• or a c ongenital anomaly/birth defect.   
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serio us adverse event when the event may jeopardize the 
patient or subject and/or may require medic al or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definition above.  
An unexpected adverse event  is any adverse event that not consistent with the current 
investigator brochure, protocol, consent form, or is not part of the normal dis ease progression.  
In addition, known adverse events may occur more frequently th an expected.  If so, then this 
meets the definition of “unexpected” and must be reported to the IRB.  
Protection Against Risk  
Staff training :  All personnel will be thoroughly trained in the study procedures by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_694545] , and will complete all required 
trainings concerning human subjects resear ch at the University of [LOCATION_012].  Perso nnel involved 
with administering tDCS will be trained in the lab of [CONTACT_694563], who has extensive experience 
with this tech nology.  
Health  monitoring  and medical response : Volunteers at risk of health problems due to recent  
history of medical conditions (e. g., serious cardiac or pulmonary conditions) will be excluded, as 
noted  above in the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Any adverse events will be recorded and 
monitored as required by [CONTACT_102772]. On -site medical

without prejudice.  Minimization of risk  during neurorehabilitation and ass essments  will be 
accomplished by [CONTACT_49126], with prescribed criteria  for termination of the testing  
session .  Vital signs will be monitored before, during and after assessment.  Contraindications 
for participation will include resting heart rate >100 bpm or <50 bpm, res ting systolic blood 
pressure >18 0 mmHg or < [ADDRESS_942202] ing diastolic blood pressure >10 0 mmHg.  
Indications to terminate physical activity will include heart rate that exceeds age -predicted 
maximum (220 -age), sudden drop in heart rate exceeding 15 bpm, systolic blood pressure >2 20 
mmHg or < 100 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure >[ADDRESS_942203], the patient’s p rimary physician 
will be called and patient referred for evaluation. If the patient complains of angina at rest, loss 
of consciousness occurs, or cardiac arrest, emergency medical services through 911 will be 
called immediately.   Portable defibrillators wi ll be available.  
Confidentiality :  Data will be used only in aggregate and no identifying characteristics of 
individuals will be published or presented. Confidentiality of data will be maintained by [CONTACT_694562]. Safeguards will be 
established to ensure the security and privacy of participants’ study records. Appropriate 
measures will be taken to prevent unauthorized use of study information. Data other than 
demographic information will not use  names as an identifier. The research ID number will be 
used. The research records will be kept in a locked room in the study site. The files matching 
participants' names and demographic information with research ID numbers will be kept in a 
locked file th at uses a different key from that of all other files. Only trained and certified study 
personnel will have access to these files, and they will be asked to sign a document that they 
agree to maintain the confidentiality of the information.  Electronic reco rds will be stored on 
password protected network server maintained by [CONTACT_173413].  In compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
and the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identi fiable Health Information of the Department of 
Health and Human Services, we access personal health information and medical records only 
after receiving signed informed consent.  
Safety during neurorehabilitation :  Neurorehabilitation sessions will be led b y a licensed physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_694546] .  The intensity 
and duration of walking activity will be carefully monitored to ensure that it is appropriate to the 
participant’s capabilities. Particip ants will wear a gait belt during neurorehabilitation, which will 
better enable the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_102752]/or assistants to provide support in the event of a loss of balance.  
Falls or near -falls during neurorehabilitation will be tracked on the therapy log and rep orted to 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_43323].  
tDCS Safety :  Our protocol uses stimulation parameters that are considered standard practice, 
and have been used safely in prior research. The FDA has ruled that the tDCS stimulator used 
in this study is a “non -significant risk” device. The most common side effects o f tDCS are slight 
itching, tingling, and reddening of the skin under the electrode. Participants typi[INVESTIGATOR_173404] [ADDRESS_942204] been reported to stop 
when stimulation is terminated.  To minimize risk associated with tDCS, participants will be 
monitored throughout stimulation sessions and asked to report any discomfort. If scalp 
sensation is uncomfortable, stimula tion levels will be decreased to a comfortable level or will be

the headache or nausea is no longer present) or will be stopped. All tDCS sessions will be 
admi nistered and continually supervised by a trained experimenter.  
fNIRS Safety : fNIRS poses no safety risk. Infrared light from the fNIRS device is not harmful and 
elicits no sensation. Sensors may be secured to the skin using adhesive tape, which could lead  
to mild skin irritation in those who are sensitive to adhesives. If a person indicates or displays 
such a sensitivity, we will avoid using adhesive tape and instead use elastic fabric or straps to 
secure the sensors.  
Questionnaire administration : Question naire data are collected in secure spaces where the 
interview cannot be overheard. Participants will be informed that they are not required to answer 
questions that they do not wish to answer.

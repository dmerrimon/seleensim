1 Introduction 
1.1 Background 
Urticaria is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by [CONTACT_579070]/or angioedema. 
Chronic urticaria is defined as urticaria that has  been continuously or intermittently present  for more than 6 weeks ( Maurer, et  al 2013, Bernstein, et al 2014). Chronic urticaria is then 
further divided into two subgroups: Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) and Inducible Urticaria (IU) the latter including physical urticaria such as heat -, cold- , or pressure -urticaria, 
and special variants such as cholinergic urticaria. CSU is defined as spontaneous appearance  of itchy wheals, angioedema, or both ≥ 6 weeks due to known or unknown causes ( Zuberbier,  
et al 2014). A combination of both the CSU and an inducible form of urticaria is possible,  such as the frequently observed combination of asymptomatic dermographic urticaria and CSU.  
Previously, all chronic urticaria forms without a known trigger were named “chronic idiopathic urticaria” (CIU). Due to medical progress it is now known that in some of the previously considered “idiopathic” urticaria forms in fact auto- antibodies may be detected. 
However, the daily fluctuating appearance of the sym ptoms in this chronic urticaria with auto - 
antibodies still remains unpredictable and is not induced by a demonstrable trigger, hence appear spontaneously. In order to reflect in the terminology correctly that some of the former “idiopathic” forms in fact may have detectable auto -antibodies, this population is now  
referred to as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) according to the international guideline (Maurer, et al 2013, Zuberbier, et al 2014). The use of the expression “chronic idiopathic 
urticaria” in medical practice is no longer recommended. However, this new naming convention is not implemented in all parts of the world and in countries such as the [LOCATION_002] and Canada the patient po pulation with chronic urticaria with a non -specific etiology, 
or unknown triggers is still referred to as chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). Following the International Guideline, the disease entity will be referred to as CSU throughout this document for consistency. 
The lifetime prevalence of CSU is approximately 1.8%, and 20% of CSU patients still have 
the disease after 20 years ( Greaves 2000, Zuberbier, et al 2010). Affected patients experien ce 
frequent pruritic hives with associated erythema and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_157048]. Angioedema is reported to be associated with approximately 33- 67% of CSU cases ( Juhlin 1981, Toubi, et 
al 2004, Zuberbier, et al 2010, Maurer, et al 2011). The classic skin lesion in urticaria is a 
wheal and flare with a pale elevated lesion and surrounding erythema, ranging in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters across, usually occurring in groups and often coalescing to form large confluent lesions.

reatment of CSU is a challenge and non -sedating (second generation) H1- antihistamin es 
(H1-AH) are the mainstay of symptomatic therapy of CSU. While H1- AH at approved doses 
provide relief for some patients, more than 50% of patients do not respond to H1- AH at 
regular doses. Even when up- dosing up to fourfold of the approved dose according to the 
second step of the treatment algorithm of the current International Guideline ( Zuberbier, et al  
2014), a substantial part of patients do not experience control of urticaria symptoms ( Maurer,  
et al 2011, Marrouche, et al 2014). For patients without disease control at fourfold doses of 
H1-AH, the third step of the treatment algorithm of the Internat ional Guideline foresees the 
addition of omalizumab, or ciclosporin A, or montelukast to the H1- AH. 
The level of evidence for the efficacy of leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) in urticaria is low but best for montelukast which consequently led to only a weak recommendation from experts for this off -label treatment. Short courses (max. 10 days) of systemic corticosteroids 
can be added to the 3rd level treatment regimens, if exacerbations demand this. Due to the adverse effects associated with chronic s ystemic corticosteroid exposure, a longer duration of 
treatment is not advisable. Other treatment options that were previously used such as intravenous immunoglobulin G, dapsone, hydroxychloroquine, H2 -antihistamines (H2 -AH), 
methotrexate, and cyclophospha mide, have an unfavorable benefit risk profile or significant 
side- effect profile and are no longer recommended for therapy of CSU ( Kaplan 2002, Powell,  
et al 2007, Zuberbier, et al 2014). However, given that H2- AH is still used in certain countries, 
in this protocol, we allow the use of H2-AH as background therapy. 
Omalizumab (Xolair
®), a humanized monoclonal antibody against human IgE, has recently 
been approved for the treatment of CSU among subjects whose symptoms cannot be 
adequately controlled by H1- AHs.

to re-treatment with  QGE031. 
 
1.2 Purpose 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate long- term safety as well as efficacy outcome of 
QGE031 240 mg sc administered every 4 weeks for 12 months in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) who completed the CQGE031C2201 study. Safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted during the treatment epoch and the 48- week post -treatment 
epoch and the latter allows an assessment of sustained remission among responders. The efficacy of retreatment among subjects who were exposed to different dose levels of QGE031 in the core study will also be assessed. In this study, QGE031 is administered as an add-on therapy to H1- AH alone at approved or increased doses or in combination with H2- AH and/or 
a LTRA.  
 
2 Study objectives 
2.1 Primary objective(s)  
The primary objective of this study is to assess the long-term safety of QGE031 in adult CSU patients who completed the core study CQGE031C2201 using the following evaluations: 
• Incidence and severity of non- serious and serious adverse events including any events of 
special  interest  
• Changes in vital signs, laboratory assessments, and ECGs  
2.2 Secondary objectives 
The secondary objective of this study is to assess the long-term efficacy of QGE031 in adult 
CSU patients who completed the CQGE031C2201 study using the following evaluations: 
• Sustained remission defined as maintaining UAS7 ≤ [ADDRESS_760759] visit 201 - 203 in the follow -up epoch in 
study CQGE031C2201 and present with active disease, as defined by [CONTACT_311052]7≥12. The study consists of two epochs: open- label treatment  and post -treatment follow up epoch. At or after 
visit 203, when the subjects become eligible to enroll in this extension study, they will complete all assessments associated with Visit [ADDRESS_760760] -treatment follow -up epoch, the patients will be followed at 
12-week intervals for 48 weeks. See Figure 3-1 for study design. 
As in the core study, patients will continue using their background medication i.e H1- AH at 
approved or increased doses alone or in combination with H2- AH and/or a LTRA.  
 
 
Open- label study Treatment Epoch:  
• Visit 301 - 313 
• This treatment epoch consists of 52 weeks of open label treatment with QGE031 240 mg sc every 4  weeks.  
• All lab assessments done as a part of end of core study visit (Visit 206) will be used to determine eligibility to enroll into the extension  study. 

[COMPANY_001]  
Clinical trial protocol v00  Confidential  Page 17

• The informed consent will be signed at visit 206 
• The subjects will continue to complete eDiary assessments between visits 206 and 301 
• Visit 301 should occur approximately 14 - 21 days after visit 206 core study assessments. 
Only in exceptional circumstances, when information concerning eligibility is outstanding (e.g., pending laboratory data), visit 301 can be extended.  
• Subjects relevan t medical conditions and concomitant medications will be reviewed at 
visits 206 
• Subjects receive their first dose of QGE031 at visit [ADDRESS_760761] -treatment follow -up Epoch:  
• Visit 401 – 405 
• [ADDRESS_760762]-treatment follow up consisting of visits every 12 weeks.  
• No study treatment will be given during the post- treatment follow -up epoch; however, 
patients are allowed to take background medication and rescue medication. If a subject 
relapses i .e. develops symptoms with an UAS7 ≥12, the investigator should be contact[CONTACT_579071] -hoc visit to consider treatment with standard of care or other therapy.

3.2 Rationale of study design 
An open- label study design was chosen to obtain information on the long- term safety and 
efficacy of QGE031 (240 mg) given s.c. q4w for [ADDRESS_760763] - 
treatment follow -up epoch will assess safety following treatment discontinuation, as well as to 
evaluate  including sustained remission.  

[COMPANY_001]

3.3 Rationale of dose/regimen, route of administration and duration 
of treatment 
Given that the primary goal of this study is to assess the long- term safety of QGE031 in 
chronic spontaneous urticaria patients, the highest dose tested in the core study - 240 mg 
QGE031 administered sc q4w for 52 weeks is used for this extension study.  
         
 
    
 
    
 
The subcutaneous (s.c.) route of administration is selected since this is the route of administration in the core study, favorable bioavailability demonstrated with QGE031 in previous studies and its ease for both patients and caregivers. 
 
3.4 Rationale for choice of comparator 
Not applicable.  
 
3.5 Purpose and timing of interim analyses/design adaptations 
An interim analysis of  safety and efficacy data will be performed at the end of open -label 
treatment epoch to collect information that might be relevant for the planning of other trials. Of note, the study procedures will not be modified as a result of this interim analysis. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_760764] likely to benefit from participating in the study and are consistent with the criteria used in the core study CQGE031C2201. The overall risk to patients wi ll be minimized by [CONTACT_201046]/exclusion criteria and clinical monitoring.  

[COMPANY_001]  
Clinical trial protocol v00  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_760765] of care treatment, and exhibits a favorable benefit -risk profile. It is a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that 
binds to IgE- specific epi[INVESTIGATOR_579061] C3 (FcεRI binding) region of the IgE molecule and is 
indicated in many countries for the treatment of CSU refractory to standard therapy. 
QGE031, although similar in principle to omalizumab, is still in clinical de velopment. The 
risks associated with QGE031 are not fully characterized; however it is expected that the risk 
will be similar to Xolair. As of [ADDRESS_760766] been exposed to 
QGE031 across 8 studies (up to 6 SC administrations of 280 mg q2w and a single IV 
administration of 10 mg/kg). About [ADDRESS_760767] entered into the one year open label extension study (QGE031 dose 240 mg sc 
q4w). In all the completed and currently ongoing clinical studies with QGE031, no deaths related to QGE031 have been reported. QGE031 administration has been safe and well - 
tolerated with the most commonly reported adverse events being procedure -related adverse 
events, such as injection -site pain, swelling, bruising, or redness and other hypersensitivity 
reactions (e.g. rash, swelling of throat and/or tongue) including anaphylaxis. 
One case of anaphylaxis has been observed with QGE031 in study CQGE031B2201E1 as of 
31 July 2015. The risk of significant hypersensitivity reactions is mitigated by [CONTACT_579072]. (please refer to the Investigator Brochure (IB) for the complete safety summary). In addition, epi[INVESTIGATOR_579062].  
Although the clinical benefits and safety profile of QGE031 in patients with CSU have not  yet 
been established, given the similar mode of action as omalizumab, the benefit to the patient from study participation is that treatment with QGE031 will likely improve itch, hives and angioedema. The risk for patients participating in this study includes the potential for known safety issues such as hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, as well as for any unknown safety effects that could occur. 
 
[ADDRESS_760768] of male and female adult patients (≥18 years old, ≤ 75 years old at the time of enrollment into the core study). All patients who received either various doses of QGE031 or Xolair or placebo in the core study and present active disease defined as UAS ≥ [ADDRESS_760769] to fulfill all of the following criteria:  
1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed. 
2. Patients who complete the treatment epoch in study CQGE031C2201 and complete at 
least Visit 203 (Week 32 of the follow- up epoch, ≥[ADDRESS_760770] injection) and

3. Patients must not have any missing eDiary entries in the 7 days prior to Visit 301 (patients 
are allowed to repeat until this criterion is  met).  
4. Willing and able to complete a daily symptom eDiary for the duration of the study and 
adhere to the study visit schedules.  
 
4.2 Exclusion criteria 
As in the core study CQGE031C2201, patients fulfilling any of the following criteria are not eligible for inclusion in this study. 
No additional exclusions may be applied by [CONTACT_093], in order to ensure that the study 
population will be representat ive of all eligible patients.  
1. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment into the extension study or 
within 30 days or 5- half-lives prior to visit 206, whichever is longer 
2. Patients with a stool examination positive for ova and parasites ( stool sample taken at  visit 
206). 
3. New onset or signs and symptoms of any form of chronic urticaria other than CSU during 
the follow-up epoch of study CQGE031C2201. This includes the following: 
• Inducible urticaria: urticaria factitia, cold, heat, solar, pressure, delayed pressure, 
aquagenic, cholinergic, or contact [CONTACT_579073]’s evaluation

5 Treatment  
5.1 Protocol requested treatment 
5.1.1  Study treatment  
The following will be prepared by [CONTACT_579074]- label 
medication of liquid formulation vials:  
• QGE031 120mg/mL solution for subcutaneous injection is provided in 2mL glass vials each containing 1mL QGE031 solution at 120mg/mL.  
The solution is clear to 
opalescent, colorless to yellowish in 2mL glass vials with rubber stopper and aluminum flip-off cap and is ready- to-use for subcutaneous injection.  
 
5.1.2  Additional study  treatment  
No additional treatment beyond study treatment is requested for this trial. 
Patients will continue to use their background medication i.e H1- AH at approved or increased 
doses alone or in combination with H2- AH and/or a LTRA (standard of care) with a stable 
regimen during the study. 
 
5.2 Treatment arms 
Patients will all be treated with  QGE031 240 mg sc q 4 weeks for 52 weeks (13 treatments) in 
this open label study. 
 
5.3 Treatment assignment, randomization 
This is a single -arm study and all patients will receive QGE031 treatment.  
At Visit 301, all eligible patients will be enrolled via Interactive Response Technology (IRT). 
The investigator or his/her delegate will contact [CONTACT_579075]/exclusion criteria. The IRT will a ssign a unique medication 

[COMPANY_001]  
Clinical trial protocol v00  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_760772] package of study treatment (QGE031) to be dispensed to the patient. 
There will be no  randomization. 
 
5.4 Treatment blinding 
In this extension study, treatment is open- label; patients, investigator s taff, persons 
performing the assessments, the sponsor and data analysts will know that all patients receive 
QGE031  q4w. 
Randomization/treatment assignment data from the study CQGE031C2201 will be kept strictly confidential and will not be unblinded to the extension study sites at least until the core study CQGE031C2201 is fully completed. The site staff including the unblinded pharmacist who prepared the study treatment in the core study CQGE031C2201 must ensure that blinding for the core study is strictly maintained. To avoid any biased assessments in the extension study, the unblinded pharmacist or designee from the core study cannot be involved in the extension study other than to prepare and/or administer the open -label QGE031 in the 
extension study. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_760773] numbers will remain the same as assigned during the core study CQGE031C2201; no new subject numbers will be assigned. 
The same RDC database will be used for both the core and the extension study. Study visits 
related to the extension study will become available once the patient has completed the core study and the site has indicated in the eCRFs that the patient will continue into the extension study. 
Upon signing the informed consent for the extension study, the investigator or his/her staff 
will contact [CONTACT_579076].  
If the patient fails to be treated for  any reason, the IRT must be notified within 2 days that the 
patient was not treated. The reason for not being treated will be entered on the Treatment Epoch Disposition form. 
 
5.5.2  Dispensing the investigational  treatment 
Each study site will be supplied by [CONTACT_144949].  
All patients will receive QGE031 240mg (2 vials) at each study drug administration and 
supplies will be provided in 2 boxes (1 vial in one box). Each vial is 120mg/1ml. The investi gational treatment packaging has a 2 -part label. A unique medication number is printed 
on each part of this label. Investigator staff will identify the investigational treatment package(s) to dispense to the patient by [CONTACT_579077] v00  Confidential  Page 24

number. Immediately before dispensing the medication to the patient, investigator staff will 
detach the outer part of the label from the packaging and affix it to the source document (Drug 
Label Form) for that patient’s unique subject number.  
 
5.5.3  Handling of study  treatment  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Handling of investigational  treatment  
Investigational treatment must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and stored safely and properly, and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator and designees have access. Upon receipt, all investigational treatmen t should be stored 
according to the instructions specified on the labels. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. Technical complaints are to be reported to the respective [COMPANY_001] CPO Quality Assurance. 
Medication label s will be in the local language and comply with the legal requirements of 
each country. They will include storage conditions for the investigational treatment but no 
information about the patient except for the medication number. 
The investigator must main tain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of 
investigational treatment in a drug accountability log. Monitoring of drug accountability will 
be performed by [CONTACT_579078]. Pa tients will be asked to return all unused investigational treatment and packaging 
throughout, at the end of the study or at the time of discontinuation of investigational treatment.  
At the conclusion of the study, and as appropriate during the course of the study, the investigator will return all unused investigational treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug accountability log to the [COMPANY_001] monitor or to the [COMPANY_001] address provided in the investigator folder at each site.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Handling of other study  treatment  
Not applicable.  
 
5.5.[ADDRESS_760774] 3 study drug administrations (Visit 301, 302 and 303) and 30 minutes for subsequent drug administration visits (304 to 313). This observation period follows the recommendation suggested by [CONTACT_572], Lung, and Blood Institute and by [CONTACT_579079], Asthma& Immunology and the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Executive Committees Joint Task Force ( Cox et al 2007) for the anti IgE therapy currently available (omalizumab).  
Two injections are required to administer the dose of 240 mg. The injections can be administered in the deltoid region on the right and/or left arm, and/or on the right and/or left thigh, or the abdomen as preferred by [CONTACT_109796]/or site. The injections are administered 

[COMPANY_001]  
Clinical trial protocol v00  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_760775] be administered at a different site (e.g., right arm and left thigh). 
The guidelines for the preparation and administration of study medication are described in the 
pharmacist manual.  
All dosages prescribed and dispensed to the patient and all dose changes during the study must be recorded on the Dosage Administration Record CRF.  
 
5.5.5  Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study  treatment  
Study drug dose adjustments are not permitted. Study drug interruption is only permitted if  
the investigator considers an interruption necessary for the treatment of an adverse event. An 
interruption of two (2) consecutive study drug administrations or three or more 
administrations in total should be discussed with [COMPANY_001] or delegate regarding the patient’s eligibility to continue investigational treatment.  
Any missed or altered study drug administrations must be recorded on the Dosage 
Administration Record CRF in order to reconstruct an accurate dosing history for each patient. 
 
5.5.6  Rescue medication  
Fexofenadine, loratadine, and cetirizine (H1- AH), in addition to being used as background 
medication will be allowed as rescue medication and used on an as needed basis during treatment and follow -up epochs. The selection of any one rescue medication should be made 
once for an individual patient. A switch of the rescue medication for an individual patient or between the core and extension study is not permitted. The patients will use the rescue medication at the indicated dose. If required for symptomatic relief, patients may take up to  4x the approved dose of the rescue medication, depending on local clinical practice and guideline. H1- AH rescue medication will be sourced  locally.  
 
 
As an additional safety precaution for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions, patients will be supplied with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], either via an auto- injector (if available) or as per other local 
standard of care. The investigator will train the patients on how  to detect such reactions and 
how to use epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. After any use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], patients will need to seek immediate medical attention to ensure that the initial reaction has been successfully controlled and/or to trigger additional therapeutic steps.  
The use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_579064]. 
 
5.5.7  Concomitant  treatment 
This study requires concurrent use of H1- AH alone (at approved doses as per local health 
authority guidance or at increased doses up to four -fold) or in combination with H2- AH 
and/or LTRA (montelukast, zafirlukast, pranlukast) as background medication. 

[COMPANY_001]  
Clinical trial protocol v00  Confidential  Page 26

It is recommended that patients should remain on a stable treatment regimen (H1 -AH alone or 
in combination with H2-AH and/or LTRA) throughout the study. 
The investigator should instruct the patient to notify the study site about any new medications 
he/she takes after the patient was enrolled into the study. All medications, procedures and significant non- drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including physical therapy and blood transfusions) 
administered after the patient was enrolled into the study must be recor ded on the respective 
CRF pages.  
 
5.5.[ADDRESS_760776] discontinue  use of the prohibited treatment if 
he/she wishes to continue in the study. If the patient received a live virus vaccination during the study, the patient must discontinue study treatment

Study completion for individual patients will be when he/she has completed the extension 
study 52 weeks of treatment and the full follow-up epoch up to and including Visit 405. 
Treatment completion will be when the patient completed the full 52 -week treatment epoch. If 
patients relapse during the follow -up epoch of the extension study as defined by a UAS7 ≥ 12, 
they will be allowed to exit the study if desired and receive conventional therapy at the 
discretion of the investigator. 
Completion of the study will be considered when all patients will have completed [ADDRESS_760778]’s completion or discontinuation of the study and the reason for 
discontinuation of the study will be recorded on the appropriate Study Epoch Completion eCRF page.  
When the patient has completed all scheduled study assessments, the investigator must call or logon to the IRT system to record the patient completion as per above completion definitions. 
The following is recommended for initiating other treatment outside or post study: 
• A wash -out of QGE031 of at least 4 months is advised prior to commencing Xolair® 
treatment  
 
5.6.2  Discontinuation of study  treatm ent 
Patients may voluntarily discontinue study treatment for any reason at any time. 
The investigator should discontinue study treatment for a given patient if, on balance, he/she 
believes that continuation would be detrimental to the patient’s well-being. 
As in study CQGE031C2201E1, study treatment must be discontinued under the following 
circumstances:  
• Adverse events for which continued exposure to the study drug would be detrimental 
• Abnormal renal laboratory results requiring discontinuation (see Section  7.4) 
• Abnormal liver laboratory results requiring discontinuation (see Appendix 2) 
• Platelets < [ZIP_CODE]/ µL 
• Pregnancy  
• If a patient develops a medical condition that requires use of prohibited treatment as per  
Section 5.5.8, or if patient exhibits a behavior of non- compliance regarding prohibited 
medications  
• Patient received a live virus vaccination during the study 
• If a patient experiences an unexpected hypersensitivity reaction of grade 4, as defined by 
[CONTACT_201076] ( Cox 2010), see Appendix 3 
• Lower  or upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]: Respi[INVESTIGATOR_579065] v00  Confidential  Page 28

• Or cardiovascular: Hypotension with or without loss of consciousness 
• Emergency use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_201030]  
• Any protocol deviation that results in a significant risk to the patient’s  safety  
Patients who discontinue study treatment should NOT be considered withdrawn from the 
study. They will be expected to perform the Visit 313 (PSW) assessments four weeks after their last dose (except receiving study drug as a part of visit 313) and will be expected to perform all follow -up assessments (Visit 401- 405). If they fail to return for these assessments 
for unknown reasons, every effort (e.g., telephone, e -mail, letter) should be made to contact 
[CONTACT_476].  
The investigator must provide follow -up medical care for all patients who are prematurely 
withdrawn from the study, or must refer them for appropriate ongoing care. This care may include initiating another treatment outside of the study as deemed appropria te by [CONTACT_579080]’s discontinuation from study 
treatment.  
 
 
5.6.[ADDRESS_760779] make every effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, 
letter) to determine the primary reason for th is decision and record this information. 
Investigational treatment must be discontinued and no further assessments conducted. All 
biological material that has not been analyzed at the time of withdrawal must not be used. Further attempts to contact [CONTACT_141005]-up. 
 
5.6.4  Loss to follow -up 
For patients whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to withdraw, the investigator should show "due  diligence" by [CONTACT_540344], family or family physician as agreed in the informed consent and by [CONTACT_268295], e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A patient should not be considered lost to follow -up until his/her 
scheduled end of study visit (Visit 405) would have occurred. 
 
5.6.5  Early study  termination  
The study can be terminated at any time for any reason by [CONTACT_5343]. Should this be necessary, the patient should be seen as soon as possible and treated for a prematurely withdrawn patient. 

[COMPANY_001]

The investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure 
that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient’s interests. The 
investigator will be responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRBs/IECs) of the early termination of the  trial. 
Given that this is a safety extension study to the core CQGE031C2201 study, if the core study is terminated for any reason including the outcome of interim analysis or the program is terminated, then the current study will als o be terminated.

6.1 Information to be collected on screen/ roll-over  failures 
All p atients who have signed informed consent but are not administered study drug will have 
the study phase completion page for the screening epoch, patient visit dates, 
inclusion/exclusion, and serious adverse event (SAE) data collected. Adverse events that ar e 
not SAEs will be followed by [CONTACT_90200]. 
 
6.2 Patient demographics/other baseline characteristics 
Patient demographic and baseline characteristic data including date of birth, age, sex, race and ethnicity that was collected as a part of the core study will be used for this extension study. Relevant medical history/ medical condition will be reviewed at Visit 206 prior to signing the 
informed consent. Data on patient’s family history on malignancies will also be collected at Visit [ADDRESS_760785] eCRF for 
each injection.  
 
6.4 Efficacy 
A number of efficacy variables will be assessed during the study. Efficacy will be assessed for each patient individually based on the baseline data collected  between Visit 206 and Visit 301. 
 
6.4.1 eDiary Assesments  
All patients will be provided with an electronic device (eDiary). Similar to the core study, the 
eDiary will consist of two components: Urticaria Patient Daily Diary (UPDD)  
. The patients will receive clear instructions on the 
completion of the eDiary twice daily or once daily depending on the questions. The patients 
will continue using the eDiary between visit 206 and 301. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Urticaria Patient Daily Diary (UPDD)  
UPDD includes UAS7 (itch and hives) for clinical symptoms, use of rescue medication, sleep 
and activity interference, angioedema occurrence and its management, and number of calls 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Hives severity score  (HSS)  
The wheals (hives) severity score, defined by [CONTACT_157098], will be recorded by [CONTACT_579082], on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (intense/severe) (see Table 6 -2). A  

[COMPANY_001]

weekly score (HSS7) is derived by [CONTACT_201065] 7 days preceding 
the visit. The possible range of the weekly score is therefor e 0 – 21. 
When either the morning or evening score is missing, the non- missing score for that day 
(morning or evening) will be used as the daily score. When one or more of the daily scores are 
missing, the following principles will be applied to handle the missing data:  
If a patient has atleast [ADDRESS_760786] a non- missing ediary score, mult iplied by 7. If there are less than 
4 non- missing daily scores within the prior 7 days, then the weekly score is missing for the 
week.  
Complete hives response is defined as HSS7 = 0.

[IP_ADDRESS].2  Itch Severity Score (ISS)  
The severity of the itch will be recorded by [CONTACT_579083], on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (intense/severe) (see Table 6 -3). A weekly score (ISS7) is derived by [CONTACT_201067] 7 days preceding the visit. The possible range of the weekly 
score is therefore 0 – 21. Partially missing ediary entries will be handled in the same way as 
described for the hives severity score. 
Complete itch response is defined as ISS7 = 0.

[IP_ADDRESS].3  Weekly Urticaria Activity Score  (UAS7)  
The UAS7 is the sum of the HSS7 score and the ISS7 score. The possible range of the weekly 
UAS7 score is 0 – 42. Complete UAS7 response is defined as UAS7 = 0. Clinical remission is 
defined as UAS7 ≤ 6, and the status of “remission” and “sustained remission” will be assessed 
during treatment and post -treatment epoch, respectively. Clinical relapse is defined as 
UAS7≥12.

However, based on the current experts’ feedback, the hives are more objective and specific to underlying condition being studied, whereas the itch is very subjective, non- specific and can 
be of different origin. 
Disease recurrence after study drug is withdrawn will be measured during the post -treatment 
follow- up epoch. For all patients, symptom scores will be measured during both the treatment 
and post- treatment follow -up epochs. 
 
6.5 Safety 
Main safety and tolerability assessments include: 
• AEs and SAEs, including AEs leading to treatment discontinuation and events of interest 
such as anaphylaxis, pre- malignancy/malignancy, cardio- cerebrovascular  events  
• Physical  examination  
• Vital signs  
• Laboratory evaluations  
• ECG  
6.5.1 Physical  examination  
A complete physical examination will include the examination of general appearance, skin, neck (including thyroid), eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, vascular and neurological. If indicated based on medical history and/or symptoms, rectal, external genitalia, breast, and pelvic exams will be performed at Visit 301.  
A short physical exam will include the examination of general appearance and vital signs (blood pressure [SBP and DBP] and pulse). A short physical exam will be at all visits starting 
from Visit 302. 
Information for all physical examinations must be included in the source documentation at the 
study site. Significant findings made after first administration of investigational drug which meet the defini tion of an Adverse Event must be recorded on the Adverse Event section of the 
CRF.  
 
6.5.2 Vital signs  
Vital signs include BP and pulse measurements. After the patient has been sitting for five minutes, with back supported and both feet placed on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured three times using an automated validated device, e.g. OMRON, 

[COMPANY_001]  
Clinical trial protocol v00  Confidential  Page 39
4 Protocol No. 
  
 
with an appropriately sized cuff. The repeat sitting measurements will be made at 1 - 2 minute 
intervals and the mean of the three  measurements will be used. In case the cuff sizes available 
are not large enough for the patient's arm circumference, a sphygmomanometer with an 
appropriately sized cuff may be used. 
Clinically notable vital signs are defined in Appendix 1. 
 
6.5.3 Height and weight  
Body weight (to the nearest 0.1 kilogram (kg) in indoor clothing, but without shoes) will be 
measured. Height will be taken from the baseline assessment in the core study and will not be repeated for the extension study. 
 
6.5.4 Laboratory  evaluations 
A central l aboratory will be used to analyze and report blood chemistry/hematology, urine (if 
abnormal dip stick at site), and any stool samples. Details on the collections, shipment of samples and reporting of results by [CONTACT_82672]. 
Clinically notable laboratory findings are defined in Appendix 1. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hematology  
Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count with differential, and 
platelet count will b e measured. Also coagulation will be assessed by [CONTACT_328795]  (INR).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical chemistry  
Albumin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, chloride, calcium, sodium, 
potassium, magnesium, LDH, creatinine, inorganic phosphorus, urea/BUN, uric acid and hs - 
CRP will be measured. If the total bilirubin concentration is increased above 1.[ADDRESS_760788] reacting bilirubin should be differentiated. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Urinalysis  
Semi -quantitative “dipstick” evaluation  will be performed at site including but not limited to 
specific gravity, glucose, protein, bilirubin, ketones, leukocytes and blood. Only when a dipstick evaluation is abnormal, e.g. positive for WBC and/or blood, a urine sample needs to be sent to the Central Lab for further examination including but not limited to RBC and WBC. Please refer to Section 7.4 and Table 7 -1 for, specific actions and assessments needed in case 
of any abnormal findings related to renal function. 
Dipsticks will be provided to the sites by [CONTACT_265277].

[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of parasitic infections  
 
 
 
All s ubjects will have a stool sample collected at Visit [ADDRESS_760789] d ose of study drug 
administration, additional assessments for parasitic infections would be performed and study treatment would not be resumed until results are obtained. 
 
6.5.5 Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Standard [ADDRESS_760790] 10 minutes. The preferred sequence of cardiovascular data collection 
during study visits is to perform the ECG prior to vital signs, and blood sampling. The Fridericia’s QT correction formula (QTcF) shou ld be used for clinical decisions. 
Triplicate ECGs (3 ECG measurements taken at approximately 1 min intervals) will be recorded at Visits 206, 313 and 405. For patients whose ECG is abnormal at Visit 206 due to technical/mechanical faults, a repeat ECG may  be performed. All electrocardiograms must be 
performed using a [ADDRESS_760791] lead. For those patients who prematurely discontinue from the study, an ECG tracing will be taken at Visit 405. 
For each ECG performed original traces and identical duplicate traces will be produced. The 
original trace will be sent electronically to the CRO directly from the provided ECG machine. Two ‘identical’ duplicate print -outs will be generated and kept at the investigator site as 
source documentation and as back -up for submission to the vendor in case of problems with 
the electronic transmission. The ‘identical’ duplicates kept at the investigator site will be dated and signed and will be archived at the study site. The subject's number, subject initials, the date, actual time  of the tracing, and Study Code (CQGE031C2201E1) must appear on 
each page of the ECG  tracing. 
Full details of all procedures relating to the ECG collection and reporting will be contained in an investigator manual to be provided by [CONTACT_201072].  
Clinically significant ECG findings prior to dosing with investigational treatment must be discussed with the sponsor. 
Clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded on the relevant section of the medical 
history/Current medical conditions if present at visit [ADDRESS_760792] kits will be provided to the sites by [CONTACT_265277]. 
 
6.5.7 Anaphylaxis assessment  
An adjudication committee (AC) is in place to determine whether cases identified through a search algorithm based on the Standardized MedDRA Queries of hypersensitivity may represent cases of anaphylaxis. Further details regarding the AC will be documented in the AC charter. See Section 8.[ADDRESS_760793] such as suspected anaphylaxis, neoplastic events, and cardiovascular 
events will be monitored and will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_579084].

7 Safety monitoring 
7.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (i.e., any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a patient or 
clinical investigation patient after providing written informed consent for participation in the study. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of an investigational product. 
For all patients who have signed informed consent and are entered into the next epoch 
(Extension 1 Treatment epoch) of the study, all adverse events occurring after informed consent is signed will be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF. 
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by [CONTACT_105]- directive questioning of the patient 
at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered 
by [CONTACT_24479], laboratory test, or other assessments.  
Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria: 
• they induce clinical signs or symptoms, 
• they are considered clinically  significant,  
• they require therap y. 

[COMPANY_001]  
Clinical trial protocol v00  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_760794] results should be identified through a 
review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from 
baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non- typi[INVESTIGATOR_90160]. Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safety of individual patient and identifying adverse events. Alert ranges for labs and other test abnormalities are included in Appendix 1 and will be described in the laboratory manual. 
Adverse events should be recorded in the Adverse Events CRF under the signs, symptoms or 
diagnosis associated with them, accompanied by [CONTACT_6644]: 
• the severity  grade  
• mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities  
• moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities  
• severe: prevents normal  activities  
• its relationship to the investigational treatment (no/yes),  or 
• its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing an outcome of not recovered/not resolved should be reported.  
• whether it constitutes a SAE (see Section 7.2.1 for definition of SAE)  
• action taken regarding investigational treatment.  
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Treatment may include one or more of the following: 
• no action taken (i.e. further observ ation  only)  
• investigational treatment dosage adjusted/temporarily  interrupted  
• investigational treatment permanently discontinued due to this adverse event  
• concomitant medication  given 
• non-drug therapy given  
• patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]/patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279833] 
• its outcome (not recovered/not resolved;  recovered/resolved;  recovering/resolving, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae; fatal; or  unknown)  
Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. 
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be 
found in the Investigator Brochure (IB) or will be communicated between IB updates in the form of Investigator Notifications. This information will be included in the patient informed 
consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed. 
The investigator should also instruct each patient to report any new adverse event (beyond the 
protocol observation period) that the patient, or the patient’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to study treatment. This information should be recorded in the 

[COMPANY_001]  
Clinical trial protocol v00  Confidential  Page 45
4 Protocol No. 
  
 
investigator’s source documents; however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE, it must be 
reported to [COMPANY_001]. 
 
7.2 Serious adverse  events  
7.2.1  Definition of  SAE 
An SAE is defined as any adverse event (appearance of (or worsening of any pre -existing) 
undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s) which meets any one of the 
following criteria:  
• is fatal or  life-threatening  
• results in persistent or significa nt disability/incapacity  
• constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]: 
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition (specify what this includes)  
• elective or pre- planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent  
• treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
• social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_064]’s 
general condition 
• is medically significant, i.e. defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require 
medical or surgical  intervention. 
All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other 
seriousness criteria are not met.  
Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the reaction ; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have 
caused death if more severe (see Annex IV, ICH -E2D Guideline). 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be 
immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76593]. Examples of such events  are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6536] (see Annex IV, ICH- E2D Guideline).  
Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction.  
All AEs (serious and non- serious) are captured on the CRF, SAEs also require individual 
reporting to DS&E as per section 7.2.[ADDRESS_760795] study visit (Visit 405) must be 
reported to [COMPANY_001] within [ADDRESS_760796] be 
submitted within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE 
that is considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.  
Information about all SAEs (either initial or follow -up information) is collected and recorded 
in English on the paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form or the electronic Serious Adverse Event Form within the Oracle Clinical/Remote D ata Capture (OC/RDC) system (where 
available). The investigator must assess the relationship to each specific component of the study treatment (if the study treatment consists of several components). 
SAEs (initial and follow -up) that are recorded on the paper SAE form should be faxed within 
[ADDRESS_760797] be kept with the case report form documentation at the study site. Follow -up 
information should be provided using a new paper SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow-up to a previously reported SAE. 
SAEs (initial and follow -up) that are recorded electronically in the OC/RDC system should be 
entered, saved and e -signed within 24 hours of awareness of the SAE or changes to an 
existing SAE. These data will automatically be submitted to [COMPANY_001] Drug Safety & 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_579066] [ADDRESS_760798]. 
Follow- up information provided should describe whether  the event has resolved or continues, 
if and how it was treated and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation. Each re -occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be 
reported as a follow-up to that event r egardless of when it occurs.  
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the investigational treatment a Drug Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_187869]. [COMPANY_001] may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same investigational treatment that this SAE has  been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions  (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  will be collected  and reported  to the competent  authorities  and 

[COMPANY_001]  
Clinical trial protocol v00  Confidential  Page 47

relevant ethics committees in accordance with EU Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or as per national 
regulatory requirements in participating countries. 
 
7.3 Liver safety monitoring 
To ensure patient safety and enhance reliability in determining the hepatotoxic potentia l of an 
investigational drug, a standardized process for identification, monitoring and evaluation of 
liver events has to be followed. 
The following two categories of abnormalities / adverse events have to be considered during 
the course of the study: 
• Liver laboratory triggers, which will require repeated assessments of the abnormal 
laboratory parameter  
• Liver events, which will require close observation, follow-up monitoring and completion of the standard base liver CRF  pages  
Please refer to Table 13-1 in Appendix 2 for complete definitions of liver laboratory triggers 
and liver events. 
Every liver laboratory trigger or liver event as defined in Table 13 -1 of Appendix 2 should be 
followed up by [CONTACT_121967]. 
Detailed information is outlined in Table 13 -2 in Appendix 2. 
For the liver laboratory trigger: 
• Repeating the LFT within the next week to confirm elevation.  
These LFT repeats should be performed using the central laboratory if possible. If this is not possible, then the repeats can be performed at a local laboratory to monitor the safety of the patient. Repeats laboratory should then be performed at central laboratory as soon as possible. If a liver event is subsequently reported, any local LFTs previously conducted that are associated with this event should be reported on the Liver CRF pages. 
• If the elevation is confirmed, close observation of the patient will be initiated, including consideration of treatment interruption if deemed  appropriate.  
For the liver events: 
• Repeating the LFT to confirm elevation as  appropriate  
• Discontinuation of the investigational drug if appropriate  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_560100]  
• A causality assessment of the liver event via exclusion of alternative causes (e.g., disease, co-medications)  
• An investigation of the liver event which needs to be followed until resolution. 
These investigations can include serology tests, imaging and pathology assessments, hepatologist’s consultancy, based on investigator’s discretion. All follow -up information, and 
the procedures performed should be recorded on appropriate CRF pages, including the liver event overview CRF pages.

7.5 Reporting of study treatment errors including misuse/ abuse  
Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or 
monitoring of study drug while under the control of a healthcare professional, patient or 
consumer 
Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal product is inten tionally and inappropriately 
used not in accordance with the protocol. 
Abuse corresponds to the persistent or sporadic intentional excessive use of a medicinal 
product which is accompanied by [CONTACT_3584]. 
Study treatment errors and uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol will be collected in 
the DAR (dose administration record) eCRF irrespective of whether or not associated with an AE/SAE and reported to safety only if associated with an SAE. Misuse or abuse will be collected and reported in the safety database irrespective of it being associated with an

8 Data review and database  management  
8.1 Site monitoring 
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a [COMPANY_001] 
representative will review the protocol and CRFs with the investigators and their staff. During the study, [COMPANY_001] employs several methods of ensuring protocol and GCP compliance and the quality/integrity of the sites’ data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment. The study monitor will also ensure that study drug is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each site’s data may be performed by a centralized [COMPANY_001] CRA organization. Additionally, a central analytics organization may analyze data and identify risks and trends for site operational parameters, and provide reports to Novar tis 
Clinical Teams to assist with trial oversight. 
The investigator must maintain source documents for each patient in the study, consisting of 
case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the patient's file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by [CONTACT_102] (a signed copy is given to the patient).  
The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the CRF entries. [COMPANY_001] monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study- specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the 
patients will be  disclosed. 
 
8.2 Data collection 
Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by [CONTACT_109051]/RDC system. Designated investigator site staff will not be given access to the system until they have been trained. Data from both the core study (CQGE031C2201) and extension study (CQGE031C2201E1) will be entered into the same database.  
Automatic validation procedures within the system check for data discrepancies during and after data entry and, by [CONTACT_105273], allow the data to be confirmed or corrected online by [CONTACT_105274]. The investigator must certify that 
the data entered into the electronic Case Report Forms are complete and accurate. After database lock, the investigator will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_105196].

9 Data  analysis 
9.1 Analysis sets  
Safety Set (SS): The SS consists of all patients who received at least one dose of open- label 
study drug during this open- label study and who had at least one post -baseline (Visit 301) 
safety assessment.  
All safety and efficacy analyses will be performed on the safety an alysis set and for the total 
population (not broken down by [CONTACT_3148]) unless otherwise specified. 
 
9.2 Patient demographics and other baseline characteristics  
Demographic and background information will be summarized and be presented based on the 
Safety Set. Medical history/current medical condition before the start of open- label extension 
study will be summarized by [CONTACT_579087]. 
 
9.3 Treatments 
The number of patients and the length of time (in days) exposed to study drug will be summarized by [CONTACT_579088].  
Concomitant medications will be summarized for the safety set separated for urticaria related background medications and non- urticaria related medications. Urticaria related background 
medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_094] -specified categories (including dose) and preferred 
term. Non- urticaria related concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_11702]. 
Use of rescue medication will be summarized as well.  
 
9.4 Analysis of the primary variable(s)  
Descriptive safety analyses will be conducted using the S afety Set.  
 
9.4.1  Variable(s)  
The primary objective of this study is to obtain additional data on the long- term safety and 
tolerability of QGE031 for 12 months of treatment in CSU patients. 
The primary variables are: for AEs/SAEs, ECGs, laboratory assessments, vital signs data and 
events of special interest such as hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis, cardio- cerebrovascular events, and pre- and malignancies.  
Baseline for the safety analysis is the last visit (Visit 206) of the core study CQGE031C2201, except  for parameters which are newly assessed at Visit 301, in which case Visit [ADDRESS_760803] dose will be considered as a treatment emergent adverse event. 

[COMPANY_001]  
Clinical trial protocol v00  Confidential  Page 53
4 Protocol No. 
  
 
Treatment emergent adverse events may be presented in 2 sub- groups; those which started 
after first study drug dose and within [ADDRESS_760804] dose. Adverse events that started during the follow -up epoch of the 
core study will be reported and analyzed in the core study and will not be included in tables of 
the extension study unless they become more severe. They will, however, be included in listings with additional collected information (e.g., outcome) as applicable. Adverse events that s tarted in the core study but became more severe in the extension study will be reported 
and analyzed as new events. 
Treatment emergent adverse events with the number and percentage of patients having any 
adverse event overall, by [CONTACT_579089]:  
• All adverse events  
• Adverse events by [CONTACT_764]  
• Adverse events suspected by [CONTACT_579090]- related  
• Serious adverse events  
• Adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug 
AEs of Speci al Interest 
Hypersensitivity assessment  
All hypersensitivity reactions that are possible cases of anaphylaxis will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_579091]. The adjudicated hypersensitivity reactions will be summarized by [CONTACT_315297].  
 
Cardi o- and Cerebrovascular events  
All cardio - and cerebrovascular events will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_579092]. 
 
Malignancies  
Frequency of adjudicated malignancies whether newly detected or worsening of existing malignancies will be repo rted. 
 
Laboratory data  
The following analyses will be performed, where appropriate, for measurements of urinalysis, hematology and blood chemistry tests: 
Standard descriptive statistics for values measured at baseline and post -baseline visits 
including cha nges from baseline, shift tables relative to the normal ranges between baseline 
and post -baseline visits, number (and percentage) of patients with clinically notable changes 
for selected tests.

This clinical study was designed and shall be implemented and reported in accordance with 
the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with applicable local 
regulations (including European Directive 2001/20/EC, US CFR 21, and Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare), and with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
 
10.2 Informed consent procedures 
Eligible patients may only be included in the study after providing written (witnessed, where 
required by [CONTACT_6617]), IRB/IEC -approved informed consent, or, if incapable of doing 
so, after such consent has been provided by a legally acceptable repr esentative of the patient. 
In cases where the patient’s representative gives consent, the patient should be informed about 
the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding. If the patient is capable of doing so, he/she should indicate assent by [CONTACT_560233] a separate assent form. Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study- specific procedures (i.e. all of the procedures described in the protocol). 
The process of obtaining informed consent should be documented in the patient source documents. 
[COMPANY_001] will provide to investigators in a separate document a proposed informed consent 
form that complies with the ICH GCP guideline and regulatory requirements and is considered appropriate for this study. Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by 
[CONTACT_90219]/IEC, and a copy of the approved version must be provided to the [COMPANY_001] monitor after IRB/IEC approval. 
Women of child bearing potential should be informed that taking the study treatment may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contra ception requirement for the 
duration of the study. If there is any question that the patient will not reliably comply, they should not be entered in the study. 
 
10.3 Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB/IEC 
Before initiating a trial, the investigator/institution should obtain approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_30757]/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) for the trial protocol, written informed consent form, consent form updates, subject  recruitment 
procedures (e.g., advertisements) and any other written information to be provided to patients. Prior to study start, the investigator is required to sign a protocol signature [CONTACT_5389]/her agreement to conduct the study in accordance with these documents and all of the instructions and procedures found in this protocol and to give access to all relevant data and records to [COMPANY_001] monitors, auditors, [COMPANY_001] Clinical Quality Assurance representatives, designated  agents  of [COMPANY_001],  IRBs/IECs,  and regulatory authorities  as required.

13 Appendices  
13.1 Appendix 1: Clinically notable laboratory values and vital signs 
Refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_760813] been identified for this study: 
• AST, ALT or INR above 1.5x ULN 
• Creatinine above ULN  
• Platelets  <75,000μL. 
• Stool test result positive for ova or parasites  
Any patient that has AST, ALT, INR or creatinine levels above the limits specified above or a 
stool test result positive for ova or parasites at Visit 206, should be excluded from the study. 
Any patients that  have AST, ALT, INR or creatinine levels above the limits specified above, 
after the patient has started treatment in the extension study, should have regular laboratory 
assessments to monitor those laboratory parameters, until they return to baseline values (or within normal range), or the investigator indicates that post baseline values are sufficiently close to baseline that no further follow-up is warranted for patient safety. 
Any patients that have platelets <75,000μL after the patient has started treatment should be 
discontinued from study drug. 
For all other laboratory assessments, the Central Laboratory will flag laboratory values falling 
outside of the normal ranges on the Central Laboratory Report (which the investigator should review and sign- off) and the investigator will report any values considered clinically 
significant in the eCRF.  
Notable values for vital signs and change from baseline will be summarized. A notable value is defined as follows: heart rate of <40 and >90 bpm; systolic blood pre ssure of <90 and >140 
mmHg; diastolic blood pressure of <65 and >90 mmHg.  
For ECGs a notable QTc value is defined as a QTc (Fridericia’s) interval of greater than 450 ms for males and > 460 for females – all such ECGs require assessment for clinical relevance 
by [CONTACT_737]. Patients with a heart rate of >100 bpm measured on 2 occasions, approximately 10 minutes apart, while resting, should be discontinued from study treatment.

1.1 Study  Objectives
Assess the efficacy of the vein visualization device AccuVein (AccuVein, Inc., Huntington, NY) 
in comparison to a standard technique for establishing intravenous (IV) access in the infant 
population (<2 years old)
1.[ADDRESS_42182] attempt IV induction in children varies from 32 – 92% depending on 
provider experience. Various techniques have been tried in the past that include application of 
warming devices and use of ultrasound. Recent literature suggests use of infrared illumination to 
aid vein visualization, with a device such as the AccuVein (AccuVein, Inc., Huntington, NY), 
has been successfully used.
2.3 Study  Rationale
There are few reports of use of the AccuVein device in the infant population. Our experience 
with this device in infant population has been positive. Additionally, we think that this will be a 
good learning tool for residents to help identify a target vein for IV access.

Approval: 2/18/2021
Page 7 of  11 (V.04/04/2017) 7.[ADDRESS_42188] is deemed ready for intravenous access attempt, a tourniquet will be applied 
on the corresponding limb where IV access is contemplated.
For those randomized to  the control group (standard technique group), the standard technique 
for establishing IV access will be used.  The standard technique involves directly identifying the 
vein after application of a tourniquet, cleaning with alcohol and then siting the intravenous 
catheter. 
For those randomized to  the vein visualization group, the AccuVein device will be used as an aid 
to identify the vein after application of a tourniquet. The technique of actual insertion of the 
intravenous catheter will be the same as the standard technique. The device will be used to 
better visualize and identify the vein.
If, after  [ADDRESS_42189] was assigned (standard or vein finder), the care provider will use the other 
technique (standard or vein finder) to attempt to insert the IV line. 
In order  to avoid operator variation, the intravenous catheter will be inserted by [CONTACT_40457] a member of the research team. Currently all the pediatric 
anesthesia faculty members are familiar with, and have used, the vein finder in case of difficult 
intravenous access. If a complication develops while attempting to start an IV using the vein 
finder or standard technique, and a rapid IV access is needed, it will be at the attending 
anesthesiologist’s discretion to perform the IV rapi[INVESTIGATOR_40452], since our faculty 
anesthesiologists are proficient with both techniques. Multiple anesthesiologists may attempt 
the IV simultaneously. This is how we would normally manage this situation and is the standard 
of care. If this happens we will withdraw the child from the study.
Data to be  collected:
The time  to successful IV insertion will be from the first time that the canula touches the skin to 
until successful IV access; up to [ADDRESS_42190] attempt, if still unsuccessful, the 
alternative technique will be used as rescue. Again, time to successful insertion will be noted. 
Success at IV will be determined by [CONTACT_40458] 5 ml of sterile normal saline.  The site(s) of 
access will also be recorded.
Medical Record  Information:  This information will include, but is not limited to:  Age, gender, 
physical status, weight, height, skin color, surgical procedure, presenting underlying conditions 
and co-morbidities.
7.3 Duration  of Participation
Patient participation  will end at the end of surgery.

8.1 Number  of Subjects
A sample  size of 160 patients to include a 15% margin above the number indicated by [CONTACT_40459], to allow for subject withdrawal or situations of incomplete subject data.
8.2 Sample  size determination
Assuming 90% success rate  with the vein visualization device and 95% confidence level, a sample size of 
139 patients would be needed to be enrolled in the study.  
8.3 Statistical  methods
Sigmastat software  will be used for statistical analysis. A p-value<0.[ADDRESS_42192] search.
Increase in  the number of IV access attempts and/or time to successful IV placement.
12.0 Potential Benefits  to Subjects and Others
12.1 Potential  Benefits to Subjects
If you  are assigned to the vein visualization group, it is possible that the insertion of your IV access line 
may take less time or need fewer needle sticks, but this is not guaranteed.
12.2 Potential  Benefits to Others
This study should  provide evidence of whether the AccuVein vein visualization device can decrease the 
number of attempts or the time to successful IV insertion in the infant population.

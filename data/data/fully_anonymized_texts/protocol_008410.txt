Background/Significance  
The pandemic of coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) began in December of last year Hubei Province of 
China has now spread to 124 countries. The number of confirmed cases and deaths grow daily 
by [CONTACT_883242]. The Institute for Health metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at University of 
Washington most conservative estimates indicate that even if al l preventative measures taken 
to slow the spread of this disease, 100,[ADDRESS_1235612] advanced healthcare 
systems will be overwhelmed, and resources will be severely constrained8 which is the current 
reality at the proposed study site, University of Colorado Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
Interstitial pneumonia and Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_883234] (ARDS) are the most common 
serious manifestation of COVID -19 which has an estimated case -fatality rate of 0.25 -3%, with a 
definitive increased risk for patients older than [ADDRESS_1235613] an estimated mortality rate of 
10%. Patients eva luated using chest CT have shown to present with bilateral ground -glass 
opacities (GGO) that are peripheral in distribution that progress to and consolidative pulmonary 
opacities as the disease progresses. Changes in CT due to COVID have been shown to mani fest 
in many patients prior to symptoms and before the PCR for the virus becomes positive. 
Although CT has been shown to be more sensitive than PCR in the detection of this 
disease10the American College of Radiology has recommended against using this modal ity as a 
screening tool in patients with suspected COVID -[ADDRESS_1235614] 
data demonstrating it high accuracy, feasibility (easy to learn and perform), patient 
centeredness (avoids rad iation and improves patient satisfaction), and the reduction in time to 
diagnosis associated with its use14. In addition, there is growing evidence that it improves 
patient outcomes15. This endorsement by [CONTACT_883243]. Devices 
with good image resolution that can be plugged into small tablet devices and cost $[ADDRESS_1235615], is not available. The data collected from the proposed study will serve as 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_49452] a larger multicenter study to evaluate implementation in settings of diverse 
typologies allowing for the expedited disseminati on of LUS to all clinical settings.  
 
Brief Approach  
 
Objective :  Evaluate this pi[INVESTIGATOR_883235], 
Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE -AIM) framework.  
 
Conceptual Framework  
We will use the Practical, Robust, Implementation, and Sustainability Model (PRISM) as the 
conceptual framework for our study. PRISM is the conceptually expanded version of RE -AIM 
developed from different models arising from other spheres important to impl ementing 
evidenced -based practice including chronic illness care, diffusion of innovation, and quality 
improvement concepts17. The contextual domains of PRISM allow for evaluation of how an 
intervention is received by [CONTACT_110871][INVESTIGATOR_883236],  helpi[INVESTIGATOR_883237] a better fit between intervention and setting and 
ultimately resulting in improved implementation and effectiveness as measured by [CONTACT_39505] -AIM 
domains of PRISM which are Reach, Effectiveness , Adoption, Implementation, and 
Maintenance. Contextual domains in PRISM include: External context (i.e. national policies, 
guidelines, incentives) and Internal context (i.e. multilevel organizational characteristics, 
perspectives, implementation and susta inability infrastructure). Use of  
  
PRISM allows for consideration of a multilevel, dynamic context and will guide us in adapting 
and tailoring our implementation strategies to our dynamic inpatient context enhancing 
implementation and effectiveness.  
 
Stud y overview:.  
We will begin LUS implementation using strategies that target barriers already identified by 
[CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_883238]. We will then proceed to conduct weekly rapid Plan -
Do-Study -Act cycles informed by [CONTACT_883244] -AIM, in order to ensure timely identification 
of implementation barriers. Rapid Iterative RE - AIM18 is an innovative application of the RE -
AIM framework in which screening assessments of RE -AIM outcomes (e.g. level of reach, 
adoption, implementation) which is p erformed at regular intervals during implementation and 
has been shown to be a feasible means of assessing interval implementation. For outcomes not 
meeting target implementation at our interval assessments, we will perform rapid qualitative 
interviews of key stakeholders to identify current barriers. Using the contextual domains of 
PRISM and rapid qualitative data from stakeholders we will select new or adapt existing 
implementation strategies, facilitating robust implementation. Study outcomes will be 
mea sured using the RE -AIM outcomes from PRISM including Reach, Adoption, Implementation. 
Effectiveness and Maintenance will not be evaluated given this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Data collection 
will occur over 12 months.  
 
Study Setting:  University of Colorado Hospit al is a 620 beds academic level 1 trauma center in 
Denver, Colorado.  
 
Participant Recruitment: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_883239] 100 physician a nd 
advanced practice clinicians (APPs) and who care for [ADDRESS_1235616] 
service.  
 
Study Procedures:  
All hospi[INVESTIGATOR_883240]. Once a provider has 
completed training, they may begin performing LUS on COVID patients. The images will be 
wirelessly uploaded into PACS. The provider’s LUS interpretation will be documented in the 
EMR. Rapid Iterative RE -AIM will be performed on a bi weekly basis as a means of iteratively 
screening for implementation barriers. The implementation outcomes of both fidelity and 
adaptation will be prioritized although all aspects of implementation will be evaluated. Interval 
Reach will be screened for using EMR data. For RE -AIM domains with poor implementation, we 
will use qualitative methods19 to obtain stakeholder perspectives of barriers and suggestions 
for adaptations to existing strategies or new strategies.  
 
Measures/Data C ollection Study Outcomes:  
Reach: We will measure the percentage of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191546] a positive COVID test 
result who received a LUS during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. We will compare the demographics and 
characteristics of the eligible patients who rece ived a LUS versus those that did not in order to 
identify disparities in implementation that can be addressed by [CONTACT_883245]. We will explore the underlying reasons for disparities in Reach using qualitative 
interviews of provide rs and other stakeholders as appropriate.  
 
 
Adoption:  
Adoption by [CONTACT_883246][INVESTIGATOR_631602]. We will also measure the 
percentage of clinici ans who performed at least 1 LUS exam. We will evaluate for differences 
between providers who did and did not complete training. We will interview hospi[INVESTIGATOR_883241].  
 
Implementation:  
We will focus on collecting implementation outcomes that are particularly relevant to the 
evaluation of diagnostic tests. Fidelity will be measured using data available through the EMR 
and through qualitative interviews of providers regarding their clinical decision -making. EMR 
data will be gathered by [CONTACT_883247] 10% of LUS exams within the EMR over 
the prior 30 days using the following 3 components to evaluate fidelity. 1. Image quality: 
Through the EMR, we will assess whethe r image acquisition was adequate using a checklist of 
image requirements. 2. Image interpretation: we will review interpretation of POCUS by 
[CONTACT_883248] a checklist 3. Clinical Decision -making using the 
LUS result: Assess appropriate integration of POCUS findings into the clinical decision -making by 
[CONTACT_883249].  
 
Analysis:  
 
Descriptive statistics will be performed for the outcome

Abbreviated title:  GI-6207 in MTC  
Version Date: May 14, [ADDRESS_987992] a 
calcitonin doubling time of <24 months vs. >24 months at baseline. 
The primary endpoint will be the change from baseline to 6 months of the growth rate parameter.  
With 17 total patients per arm (34 total), with complete measurements of this main parameter at 
baseline and at 6 months after randomization, there would be 80% power to detect a difference between the two groups with respect to a change from baseline to [ADDRESS_987993] deviations of the change (1.[ADDRESS_987994] size) using a two-tailed 0.[ADDRESS_987995]. In 
practice, if the differences from baseline to 6 months are not normally distributed on both arms (that is, if p<0.[ADDRESS_987996]) then a Wilcoxon rank sum test will be performed instead.  
As an important secondary objective, using the surveillance arm, two related secondary endpoints will be explored, both the actual magnitude of the change in the growth rate parameter as well as the fraction who exhibit a substantial, 50% decline in the growth rate as a result of 
treatment.  
For the 17 patients will be enrolled on the surveillance arm, t he growth rate determined at 
12 months (after 6 months of vaccine) will be subtracted from that obtained at 6 months (after surveillance) to determine the actual change in the growth rate  for receiving vaccine after 
6 months of surveillance. With 17 patients, there is 82% power to detect a difference in the values at the two time points equal to ¾ of the SD of the change (.[ADDRESS_987997] size) assuming that a two-tailed 0.[ADDRESS_987998] is used.  
Also, as an additional secondary exploration, using all 17 patients on the surveillance arm, the fraction that experiences a 50% decline relative to the time of starting vaccine will be determined. Using an exact binomial tes t, [ADDRESS_987999] 83% power to test whether the 
fraction exceeds a null fraction of 20% and is consistent with 50% who have 50% declines, with a one-tailed 0.[ADDRESS_988000]. In practice, the fraction with a 50% decline will have a 95% confidence interval created about the result in order to describe what values it would be consistent with.  
Exploratory analyses will also be performed to compare the growth rate changes at additional time points, such as 7, 10 and 12 months. 
It is expected that the  trial will accrue approximately 1 -2 patients per month may be accrued; 
thus it is expected that this study may enroll 34 evaluable patients within 24 -30 months. To allow 
for the possibility of a rare inevaluable patient, the accrual ceiling will be set at 37.

Surveillance (n=17)  
• All patients enrolled will have evaluable disease  
• Consistent with phase 1 study dosing, all patients will be given GI -6207 
every 2 weeks for 3 months and then monthly.  Dose = 40/YU. 
• Half of the patients will be on surveillance for 6 months to determine a 
growth rate for comparison to those who start GI-6207 immediately  
• The primary endpoint will compare the c alcitonin growth rate in the 
GI-6207 arm at 6 months, with patients on the surveillance arm at 
6 months. 
• A secondary endpoint will compare the surveillance arm growth rate 
after 6 months of GI-6207 to each patient’s own baseline growth rate determined after 6 months of surveillance. 
•  Patients will be evaluated with radiographic ima ging at enrollment and 
every 3 months while on study 
• Patients will be removed from treatment if there is clinical progression or radiographic progression (based on the immune- related  response 
criteria) while on GI -6207 treatment 
• Patients will be stratified  based on pre- treatment doubling time of less 
than or greater than 24 months. 
• Once patients have completed one year of therapy with GI -6207, patients 
without radiographic progression will have the option to receive vaccine every 3 months for an additional 12 months.  Patients who remain on 
vaccine will continue to be scanned every 3 months. 6 months

Background: 
• CEA is overexpressed in multiple malignancies , including medullary thyroid cancer  where 
CEA is universally expressed on tumor cells. 
• There is no standard treatment for patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, 
metastatic medullary thyroid cancer . The only effective FDA -approved therapy (vandetanib) 
comes with significant toxicity, so it is not used until patients have symptomatic or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_32660].  
• Preclinical studies have shown that GI-6207 can induce a strong immune response to CEA  as 
well as therapeutic anti -tumor responses.  
• A previous phase 1  GI-6207 study has demonstrated safety and enhanced immune respons e 
in some patients.  
• Preliminary data suggests that tumor growth rates can be calculated in medullary thyroid  
cancer patients within 3 months. 
• Retrospective data from prostate cancer studies suggest that vaccines can alter tumor growth rates within 3 -4 months. 
 
Objective:  
Primary  
• To determine the effect of GI -6207 on calcitonin growth rate kinetics after 6 months of  
therapy in patients with medullary thyroid cancer . 
 
Eligibility:  
• Patients will have evidence of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer including disease that is 
evaluable on bone or CT scan.  
• Patients with minimal or no disease related -symptoms (minimal symptoms will include those 
that do not affect activities of daily living or pain that does not require regularly schedule 
narcotics) . 
• ECOG 0 -1 
• No previous chemotherapy 
• No previous vandetanib 
• Should have no autoimmune diseases; no evidence of being immunocompromised; no 
serious inter -current medical illness; no cardiac disease; no prior splenectomy. (History of 
previous thyroid autoimmune disease wil l be allowed as these patients will have had total 
thyroidectomy.) 
• No brain metastasis, history of seizures, encephalitis, or multiple sclerosis  
• No pericardial -based masses greater than 1 cm or thoracic lesions larger than 2 cm

Design:  
• Randomized, phase [ADDRESS_988003] of GI -6207 on calcitonin growth rate after 
6 months of GI-6207 
• Patients will be randomized to either initial GI -6207 therapy or 6 months of surveillance 
followed by [CONTACT_723544]-6207 therapy.   
• GI-[ADDRESS_988004] units per site, 
biweekly for 7 visits (day 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85), then monthly up to 1 year  of treatment.  
(For patients randomized to surveillance and then GI -6207, they will get a full year of GI -
6207 after a 6 month surveillance period.) 
• Once patients have completed one year of therapy with GI -6207, patients without 
radiographic progression will have the option to receive vaccine every 3 months for an 
additional 12 months.  Patients who remain on vaccine will continue to be scanned every 3 months. 
• Immune monitoring via apheresis will be done prior to enrollment and at 6 months for all 
appropriate and consenting patients. Patients who are evaluable for immunologic response by 
[CONTACT_723545] (HLA 02, 03 and 24) will have apheresis at start of GI -6207 therapy and 
then every 3 months while on GI-6207 treatment when feasible.

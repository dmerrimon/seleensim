Racial/Ethnic  Minority  Populations  
 
Principal Investigators: Moon S. Chen, Jr., Ph.D., M.P.H., Professor; Lorenzo  
Nardo,  M.D.,  Ph.D., Associate [CONTACT_115340]: 09/14/2021  
 
2) Objectives  
• Using the total -body PET/CT scanner, gather preliminary data from racial/ethnic  
minority  healthy volunteers to  compare with  patients with tumors  
• Conduct quantitative, genetics -based estimates of ancestry (e.g., African, Chinese,  
Colombian, Western European, Mexican, Vietnamese, etc.) in racial/ethnic minority  
healthy volunteers  
• Compare participants’ self -reported racial/ethnic identity with the quantitative,  
genetic -based  estimates  of ancestry  
 
3) Background  
The EXPLORER PET/CT scanner is the world’s first and only FDA -cleared Total -Body  
scanner and the world’s first device to offer the ability to tomographically image all body  
parts simultaneously. It has a signal sensitivity gain of ~40 fold compare d to existing  
commercial devices for total -body applications. Spatial resolution is also comparable to  
or better than all other commercial clinical devices available today. The EXPLORER  
scanner allows for (a) substantial reduction in scan times or (b) subs tantial improvements  
in image  quality  or (c)  substantial reduction in  administered activity or (d) combination  
of (a-c) and (e) total -body coverage. 1-3 With its unprecedented and unmatched potential  
for cancer detection and characterization, exploiting EX PLORER may result in detection  
of tumors while they are at earlier stages, and improving the management of cancer  
therapy  throughout  the course  of the disease.  
 
One specific  gap with ongoing  research  out of the EXPLORER  Molecular  Imaging  
Center  (EMIC) is the  need to have  “healthy”  (non-cancer)  participants.  
The aim of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_115284]/ethnic  minority  populations.  This will advance  research  being  conducted  at EMIC  
by [CONTACT_1541] “controls”  or comparisons to differentiate between images from patients  
with cancer versus healthy people of the same racial/ethnic ancestry. In addition, blood  
samples from participants to this study will be utilized for quantitative, genetics -based  
estimates of an cestry (e.g., African, Chinese, Colombian, Western European, Mexican,  
Vietnamese, etc.), which is especially valuable in the case of admixed individuals. In  
order to accomplish this, we will utilize the UCDCCC’s Genomics Shared Resource  
(GSR)  for Whole -exome sequencing  (WES)  and contemporary  computational  analyses.

 6) Study  Endpoints  
A. To collect  preliminary  data about  total body  FDG  perfusion  and early  biodistribution  
in a cohort of racial/ethnic minority volunteers  
B. To allow  the study  team  to supplement  participants’  self-reported  racial/ethnic  identity  
and ancestral origin  with Ancestry  Informative  Markers  (AIMS)  analysis.  
 
7) Procedures  Involved  
Subject  recruitment  
Up to [ADDRESS_128773] with diverse  
audiences, newsrooms will be supplied with video (b -roll) and interviews (soundbites)  
conducted with racially -diverse community advisory board members who took a “ride”  
on the EXPLORER during a tour of the facility and were interviewed about their  
experience afterwards.  
 
We will also include a paid Facebook campaign that will drive qualified leads to the 
EXPLORER’s StudyPages. The targeted audience will be Sacramento -area residents ages  
18 and older with an emphasis on racial/ethnic minorities (African Americans, Asian  
Americans,  and Latinos).  Lastly, we will use a recruitment flyer to share with poten tial 
candidates and community members.  
 
Study  procedures  
Consenting and screening : Informed consent for this study will be obtained through a  
method approved by [CONTACT_45102].  Consenting and screening for this study will occur not  
earlier  than 4 weeks  before  the imaging  visit.  During  screening, subjects  will be asked  to 
self-disclose  their racial/ethnic population affiliation.  
 
Imaging Visit : Participants will be asked to fast for [ADDRESS_128774]  fingerstick  method  per Radiology’s standard  operating 
procedures, at no  charge.  
Following this, an intravenous (IV) line will be placed by [CONTACT_115308]/CT technologist  
or study  physician and  the participant will  be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_115286].  
We will also ask all subjects if they had a bowel movement  from  the time they are  
injected with  FDG  until they complete their scan(s).  
Study participants will be injected with 10 +/ - [ADDRESS_128775] scan (less than 1 minute ) wi ll be acquired for attenuation correction  
purposes only. After the dynamic scan, participants will be able to get off the scanner and  
rest in a quiet  room  at EMIC.  
Ninety (90) minutes after being injected with FDG, participants will be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_115287]:  EXPLORER  PET/CT:  Evaluation  of Healthy  Individuals  from  Racial/Ethnic  
Minority  Populations  
Page [ADDRESS_128776] scan (less than 1  
minute) will be acquired for attenuation correction purposes only.  This will be followed  
by a [ADDRESS_128777] for a few minutes.  One-hundred and  
twenty  (120) minutes  after being injected  with FDG, participants will be positioned  
supi[INVESTIGATOR_115288].  At this time, a lo w dose CT scan (less than 1  
minute) will be acquired once again for attenuation correction purposes.  This will be  
followed by [CONTACT_115309] 20 minute static scan on EXPLORER.  After the scans, the patient 
will get off the scanner. The IV line will be removed  after completion  of the study.   
 
AIMS : Prior to the scans, whole blood samples (3 -5 mL) will be drawn using a butterfly 
method with the time recorded. The blood samples  will be collected into purple -top 
tubes and subsequently submitted to the UCDCCC GSR  for isolation of genomic DNA 
(gDNA) using the Gentra Puregene Blood Kit (Qiagen),  which yields genomic DNA of 
required quality (e.g., purity, high molecular weight) and  quantity (>35ug). Whole -
exome sequencing will be performed at the UC Sequencing  Consort ium. Raw 
sequencing data (FASTQ) will be returned to the UCDCCC GSR for  data analysis.  
Results will be used to estimate the proportion of ancestry from a  particular geographical 
area and to supplement participant’s self -reported racial/ethnic  and ancestral  origin.  
 
The PET/CT images created for this study are for research and are not meant to evaluate  
the subject’s health, as they would be if they were part of a clinical (non -research) visit to  
the doctor or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The images will not receive any routine  clinical review by  
[CONTACT_115310]/CT scans. This means that some findings may be  
overlooked or misinterpreted.  However, if the PET/CT technologists do notice findings  
that cause concern, they will notify the Study Radiologist. Additionally , if a member of  
the research team notices any findings that cause concern while conducting image review  
for study purposes, they will notify the Study Radiologist. The Study Radiologist will  
conduct a brief review of part of the study images for quality p urposes. If the Study  
Radiologist thinks a  clinical  problem  is present,  one of  the IRB -approved study  
physicians will discuss these possible problems with the subject within 8 weeks or  
immediately upon recognition of any critical finding that requires imme diate and/or  
urgent intervention as described in the Department of Radiology Critical Findings policy  
(full dataset of images are sometimes not available for review in less than 3 days).  Upon  
written request, we will provide the subject with a copy of a su bset of their CT images to  
take to the physician of their choosing. A subset of PET images may also be shared with  
the subject  unless  the images  from  the study  are clinically  uninterpretable.  In addition,  
the sponsor may restrict sharing of PET images due to the nature of the research protocol  
or to protect intellectual property (e.g. proprietary radiotracers). We will send a standard  
letter to the designated licensed medical provider identified by [CONTACT_115311] a  
copy of the subject’s r adiology report. The standard letter will state that (i) the subject’s  
images  were  acquired  exclusively  for a research  study  and incidental  findings  that may be 
related to a medical condition were observed by a UC Davis radiologist; (ii) the images  
did not receive  any dedicated  routine  clinical review and  findings  may have  been  
overlooked or misinterpreted; (iii) the subject’s physician can contact [CONTACT_115312]’s findings. In  
addition, [CONTACT_115341] or a designee may contact [CONTACT_115313] -up, if any, they received.  
PROTOCOL  TITLE:  EXPLORER  PET/CT:  Evaluation  of Healthy  Individuals  from  Racial/Ethnic  
Minority  Populations  
Page [ADDRESS_128778] as not meeting the  
inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g. metastatic disease, marked claustrophobia leading to  
incomplete scans), this event will be reported and the subject will be excluded from the  
study.  An additional  participant  will be added  to meet  the recruitment  goal.  
 
Data analysis plan  
Image reconstruction and analysis: Data from EXPLORER will be acquired and image  
quality, quantitative comparisons and preliminary biodistribution data collection will be  
performed by [CONTACT_115314] (ROIs) drawn in different organs and tissue  
types  where pi[INVESTIGATOR_115289].  
 
Statistical considerations: Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_115290] a first -of-its kind  
scanner, no formal power analysis is presented. Exploratory data anal ysis will be  
conducted to examine the distribution of the data. Graphical methods including box -plots  
and histograms will be employed to examine the distributions of the measures. For all  
continuous variables, descriptive statistics, including means, range s, and standard  
deviations will be computed. Ninety -five percent confidence intervals will be computed  
for means and proportions to obtain interval estimates of all measurements across image.  
For categorical  data, frequency,  proportions,  and percentages  will be calculated.  
 
Compensation  
Participants  will be compensated  with gift cards  at a rate of $25 (upon  enrollment  
and radiotracer  injection),  plus an additional  $25 for each hour of participation:   up 
to 3 hours; maximum total of $100 . 
There  is no compe nsation  associated  with initial  consenting  and screening  visit.  
 
8) Data  and/or  Specimen  Management  and Confidentiality  
☒ I understand that if this study involves the use of  the UC Davis Health Electronic  
Health Record (EMR/EPIC) it also contains the clinical data for Marshall Medical Center  
(MMC). I understand that MMC patient data cannot be accessed for research purposes  
and that I must take the necessary steps to ensure that MMC data is not accessed, used, or  
disclosed  for UC  Davis  Health  research p urposes.  
At the time of acquisition, identifiable information will be entered in the UC Davis  
system database. Electronic image files, radiation dose reports and pertinent medical  
information will be stored on the EXPLORER Research Cluster located at EMIC on 
dedicated  encrypted  password -protected  hard disks  and workstations  at UC Davis,  which  
project staff may access; in addition, electronic image files, radiation dose reports and  
pertinent medical information will be stored on the UC Davis radiology depart ment  
PACS system, Radimetrics dose reporting system and Electronic Medical Record. These  
files will contain  the patient  identifiers.  When  this data is transferred  for analysis  to any 
other computer/device which is not encrypted and password protected, it will be  
anonymized. We will assign participants a unique subject/code number that will be used  
to identify them in our database. Our data will be in the form of anonymized images and  
coded medical records recorded in an Excel spreadsheet and images in electronic format.  
The Excel spreadsheet and the images containing the subjects coded medical records will

Page [ADDRESS_128779] names/medical record numbers and correspo nding subject code  
numbers in a secured location separate from the data. Only study team will have access 
to the data. Requests to use the data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978]. If approved, PI [INVESTIGATOR_115291] -identified data. Quality control will include r egular data verification and 
protocol  compliance checks by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_115292]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_115293].  
 
9) Data  and/or  Specimen  Banking  
All the imaging data will  be banked indefinitely for future use. Data will be saved on the  
EXPLORER Research Cluster located at EMIC and/or on dedicated encrypted password - 
protected hard disks and workstatations  at UC Davis with access limited to authorized  
personnel. In addition, electronic image files, radiation dose reports and pertinent medical  
information will be stored on the UC Davis Radiology Department PACS system and  
Electronic Medical Record. A radiati on dose report will be generated. This will be part of  
the banked data and will contain Protected Health Information. It will be sent to  
Radimetric  system,  which  is a mandated  tracking  system  for lifetime  radiation  dose.  
 
Future use of bank data may includ e improved image analysis, use as a normal  
atlas/comparator,  and use  for other  research  purposes.  
 
In addition, investigators from other entities may contact [CONTACT_115315]. Anonymous data may be shared with other entities if appropriate data  
use agreements are in place (e.g., DTA, UC Reliance) and if approved by [CONTACT_115316].  
 
Urine samples and blood samples are used for screening purposes  and for AIMS 
analysis.  After the results are re corded these  biological  specimens  will be discarded.  
 
10) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
Throughout the conduct of this study, study personnel will consult with the UC Davis  
Health Radiation Safety Officer and the local IRB regarding the monitoring and reporting  
of adverse events and follow their recommendations.  Protocol changes involving the  
radiation dose will first receive approvals from the Radiation Use Committee prior to  
submitting  a modification request  to the IRB.  
 
Participants will be informed about the study risks during the initial consenting and  
screening  visit.  
 
Protocol  changes  will not be  implement ed prior  to UC Davis  IRB approval  unless  
necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate  hazards  to the research  subjects.  
 
If any incidental  findings  are detected, they will  be managed  as described  above  in this 
protocol.  
 
Data  safety  monitoring  
After  acquisition  of data,  we will assign  participants  a unique  subject/code  number  that we

Confidentiality will be protected through periodic assessment, as new study materials and  
communication methods among project staff develop. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_115296]  
 
11) Withdrawal  of Subjects  
Subjects  will be withdrawn  from  the study  without  their consent  if: 
• They do not follow the study rules or they no longer meet the requirements to be in  
the study  
• The study  is stopped  by [CONTACT_115317]  
• The investigators  feel it is in the participants’  best interest  to discontinue  
participation. Such circumstances may include unanticipated discomfort and/or  
fatigue from laying on the scanner table and/or feelings of fear or anxiety related  
to staying in  a confined space  (e.g.,  the PET/CT  scanner)  
 
12) Risks  to Subjects  
May include:  
• Discomfort  and/or  fatigu e from  laying  on the scanner  table  
• Feelings  of fear or anxiety  related  to staying  in a confined  space  (e.g.,  the 
PET/CT  scanner)  
• Bruising  and/or infection  at the IV  site 
• Radiation Risks:  This study involves a radiation exposure that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_115297].  The amount  of radiation  exposure  received  in 
this study is below the levels that are thought to result in a significant risk of harmful  
effects.  
• It is possible that EXPLORER PET/CT may detect false positive findings that may  
require further follow -up (clinical, imaging or surgical) with all the risks associated  
with these follow -up procedures. These risks range from minor risks to severe risks  
including death and permanent disabilities . In addition, a misinterpreted or missed  
findings  may give false  information  to the subjects  about  their health  status.  
• Hypoglycemia  from  prolonged  fasting.  
13) Potential  Benefits  to Subjects  
In general, we expect there to be no benefit to the subject. If any incidental fin ding 
will be detected, they will be managed as described above in section “Procedures  
PROTOCOL  TITLE:  EXPLORER  PET/CT:  Evaluation  of Healthy  Individuals  from  Racial/Ethnic  
Minority  Populations

 Involved” of this protocol.  
 
14) Sharing  of Results  with  Subjects  
The results of this research will not be shared with subjects. However, if any incidental  
finding are  detected, they will be managed as described above in section “Procedures  
Involved” of this protocol.  
 
15) Prior  Approvals  
This study  has been approved  by [CONTACT_115318].  
 
16) Provisions  to Protect  the Privacy  Interests  of Subjects  
The research team member obtaining consent will meet with the candidate in a private  
setting and will dedicate sufficient time to explain the study procedures and answer any  
questions. It will be explained that participation is strictly voluntary and declining to  
participate will not affect them in any way. A HIPAA disclosure form will be signed by  
[CONTACT_115319].  
 
17) Compensation  for Research -Related  Injury  
If a subject is injured as a result of  being in this study, the University of  [LOCATION_004] will  
provide the necessary medical treatment. Depending on the circumstances, the costs of the  
treatment may be covered by [CONTACT_115320]’s insurance co mpany just like other medical costs. The University and the study  
sponsor do not normally provide any other form of compensation for injury. For more  
information about compensation, the subject may contact [CONTACT_115321] (916)  
703-9151  or [EMAIL_2285]  
 
18) Economic  Burden  to Subjects

Key Information about This Research Study  
You are invited to participate in a research study. The purpose of this research is  to test the performance 
of a new P ositron Emission Tomography /Computerized Tomography (PET/CT)  scanner, which is a type 
of medical scanner. It is called EXPLORER and it is the first FDA -cleared medical scanner to be able to 
scan the entire human body at the same time. EXPLORER is much more efficient tha n previous PET/ CT 
scanners and has the potential to make a big impact in medical care and research . You are invited to be 
in this study because you are a healthy volunteer who has expressed an interest in participating  and you 
identify as a racial/ethnic minor ity.  
Your participation in this research may involve up to two visits. The first visit (consenting and 
screening ) will inform you of study details  and determine your eligibility . During this visit you will be 
asked to sign an informed consent if you want to tak e part in the study  before proceed ing to  the 
screening part .  The other  visit will involve the study scanning procedure  which will last approximately  
[ADDRESS_128781] 20 people will participate in this research at UC Davis.  
Participation in this study will involve PET/CT scans. For the PET/CT scan, you will be injected with a 
small amount of a radioactive sugar (called F -18 fluorodeoxyglucose, or FDG) and you will lay on your 
back inside a long PET/CT scanner (the EXPLORER  scanner ).  
We will also ask you for a blood sample to use in doing studies of your ancestry.  Some of the tests we 
will perform on your  blood sample  will be genetic testing, which is done on your DNA. DNA, or 
deoxyribonucleic acid, carries the genetic instructions for the cells that make up your body. Genes tell

All research studies involve some risk. These risks are described in detail later in this document. We do 
not expect that you will  benefit from participation in this study. Here are some reasons you may not 
want to participate in this research .  The scanning visit could last up to 3 hours. Avoiding strenuous 
exercise,  the day before, and fasting for 6 hours prior to the PET/CT visits, may be undesirable . For 
some people l ying inside the scanner may cause fear or anxiety due to the confined space , and/or 
discomfort . Also, the scan may reveal suspi[INVESTIGATOR_115298]/or findings of unclear cause  which may 
need further follow -up procedure(s)  or give you false reassurance  about your health conditions . Medical 
follow -up may include doctor's visits, more scans or surgery  and may expose you to additional risks 
from the follow -up procedure (s). 
Your participation in this study is voluntary. You do not have to participate in this study if you do not 
want to. There may be other choices ava ilable to you. You will not lose any services, benefits, or rights 
you would normally have if you choose not to participate.

 How is this research funded?   
This research is being funded by  [CONTACT_115325] (NIH)  also called the sponsor. 
Sponsors may change or be added.  
The University of [LOCATION_004] has a financial interest in this study. The University has granted a license to 
a private company to develop the device being tested in this study. If the device proves to be safe and 
effective, the University could financially benefit from the sales of the device.  
Why is this research being done?  
One specific gap with ongoing research out  of the EXPLO RER Molecular Imaging Center  (EMIC) is 
the need to have “healthy” (non -cancer)  participants. The aim of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_115300]/ethnic minority populations. This will  advance research being 
conducted at  EMIC by  [CONTACT_1541] “controls” or comparisons to differentiate  between images from 
patients with cancer versus  healthy people of the same racial/ethnic ancestry.  In addition, blood samples 
from participants to  this study will be utilized for quantitative, g enetics -based  estimates of ancestry (e.g., 
African,  Chinese, Colombian, Western European, Mexican,  Vietnamese, etc.), which is especially 
valuable  in the case of admixed individuals. In order to  accomplish this, we will utilize the UCDCCC’s  
Genomics Shared Resource (GSR) for Whole -exome  sequencing (WES) and contemporary  
computational analyses.  
What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research ?

scans. So, you need to avoid drinking soda  or anything sweet. Drink water if you are thirsty .  
• You will also need to avoid caffeine and nicotine for six hours prior to your PET/CT scans.  
• On the day of your PET/CT scans, you will come to EMIC  at 3195, Folsom Boulevard  in 
Sacramento .  
• A technologist will ask you some questions and/or give you some tests  (to test blood sugar level 
and pregnancy if applicable)  to make sure everything is OK for the PET scan.    
• A urine pregnancy test will be administered at no charge to all participants who are able to get 
pregnant between 18 to 60 years old, unless documented hysterectomy or bilateral ovarian 
removal is available . 
• Your blood sugar level will be measured with a needle -stick to make sure you do not have too 
high a blood sugar level for the study to work . 
• Your height and weight will be measured.  
• You will be asked to remove your clothing and wear a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115301].  
• You will have an IV needle placed in a vein for injection of 8-12 mCi of 
[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a radioactive sugar.   
• Before the  scans  begin , you will have 3 -5ml of blood (about a tablespoon) drawn through a 
needle from a vein in your arm for genetic ancestry testing.  
• You will then receive a whole -body CT scan (quicker tha n 1 minute on the same scanner) . This 
will be followed by a  PET scan on the EXPLORER scanner lasting 60 minutes which starts 
when the radioactive sugar is injected . 
• You can then get off the scanner, stretch , use the restroom , or rest in a quiet room at EMIC  
• We will also ask you if you had any bowel movements after injection  with FDG  until you 
complete your scans .

• [ADDRESS_128789] scan (quicker than 1 minute on the same scanner)  
• The total amount of time you will spend on this second  visit is approximately 3 hours.  
How is being in this study different from my regular  health care?  
If you take part in this study, the main difference between your regular care and the study is  that your 
regular health care does not involve any procedures done in this study including PET/CT scans.   
Do I have to be in th is study? What if I say “yes” now and change my mind later?  
No, you do not have to be in this study. Taking part in research is voluntary. You can choose to be in the 
study or not be in the study. If you decide to be in the study, you can choose to leave the  study at any 
time.

Can I be removed from the research without my OK?  
The researchers may t ake you out of the study, even if you want to continue, if : 
• you do not follow the study rules , or you no longer meet the requirements to be in the study  
• the study is stopped by [CONTACT_115328] . 
• the investigators feel it is in your best interest to discontinue participation. Such circumstances 
may include unanticipated discomfort and/or fatigue from laying on the scanner table, and 
feelings of fear or anxiety related to staying in a confined space  in the scanner  
Is there anyway  being in this study could be bad for me ? 
There are risks to participating in this research. The study doctor and study team will monitor you to see 
if you are experiencing any harm related to your participation.  If you expe rience any pain or discomfort, 
you must inform the study team as soon as possible.  
Radiation risks: This study involves a radiation exposure that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_45090]. The amount of radiation exposure received in t his study is below the levels that are 
thought to result in a significant risk of harmful effects.  
You are  exposed to radiation on a daily  basis,  both from  natural  (sun and earth) and manmade sources.  
The estimated  radiation dose  that you will  receive  as a participant  for this type of research  has been 
compared to the limits  allowed  for a radiation worker.  This limit  is low and is not expected to be 
harmful.  The person  obtaining  your consent  can answer any questions  you have and  provide detailed  
written  information  about  the amount  of radiation resulting  from this  study.  
PET scans  involve  the risks  of radiation  (see above).   If you have  had a PET scan or have been  exposed  
to radiation  while  participating in other research  during the past year,  you should  inform  the 
researcher(s).  This will enable  the researcher(s) to determine  your total  radiation  exposure  and make  sure 
it does not exceed  accepted  safety  guidelines.  If you participate  in future studies  that involve  the use of 
X-rays or radioisotopes,  you should discuss  the safety  guidelines  for radiation  exposure  with the 
researcher who  is performing the study.  
 
Risk of the Radiotracer (18F -FDG): A side  effect from Fludeoxyglucose F18 Injections is  uncommon. 
Side effects include allergic reactions,  itching, rash, and water retention.  To minimize radiation exposure 
to your bladder,  you should drink at least an 8 oz glass of water  before injection with the radiotracer and 
after your  PET/CT scans. To help protect yourself and  others,  you should flush the toilet several times 
after each  use for [ADDRESS_128791]

wash them  separately from other clothes.  
 
Minor risks:  
• Blood draw risks: Blood draws may cause temporary discomfort from the needle stick , bruising 
and, rarely infection and fainting.  If more than one unit  of blood is to be drawn within an 8 -
week period, a medically appropriate precaution concerning subsequent blood donation is 
required  
• Bruising or infection at the site of the injection . 
• Discomfort from lying on the scanner table multiple times for up to 60  min.  
• Feelings of fear or anxiety related to staying in a confined space  
• There is risk for having low blood glucose  because of prolonged fasting . 
 
There is a possibility that the scan (s) will reveal some suspi[INVESTIGATOR_115302], 
that may require further medical follow -up.  If this is the case, your doctor will be notified within 8 
weeks, or immediately if the finding indicates an urgent nature. This is discussed f urther on page 7 of 
this consent .  As with all research, there is a chance that confidentiality could be compromised ; that is,  
that your information cou ld become known to someone not involved in this study . To minimize the risks 
of breach of confidentialit y, we will include information that directly identifies you only during the 
acquisition  and storage  of data  including encrypted external password protected hard -driver and the UC 
Davis PACS system . PACS refers to  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_115303], which consists of 
multiple machines, computers, and /or devices  connected together for easy access to huge number of 
medical image s. However , any information that directly  identifies  you will not be show n in publications, 
talks or any other presentations about this research .  
 
What about Birth Control ?  
Contraception Requirements for Women  
The study  involves radiation  that may harm a fetus or a breastfeeding baby. If you are pregnant or 
breastfeeding , you cannot take part in this study. If you think you may be pregnant, you should not 
volunteer for this study. A urine pregnancy test will be administered at no charge to all participants who 
are able to get pregnant between [ADDRESS_128793] ? 
Being in this study will not help you directly. But your participation in the study may benefit other 
people in the future by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_115304] . This study is not a substitute for 
your regular medical care. You should continue to see your regular medical providers.

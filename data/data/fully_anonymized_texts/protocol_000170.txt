[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Efficacy Analysis  29 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  [ADDRESS_829649] 25 years,years, focal/grid laser photocoagulation had been the mainstay of treatment 
for DME. In the ETDRS, focal/grid photocoagulation of eyes with DME reduced the risk of 
moderate visual loss by [CONTACT_3450] 50% (from 24% to 12%) three years after initiation of 
treatment. The advent of intravitreal pha rmacotherapy with intraocular steroids and anti -VEGF 
agents have led to numerous clinical trials investigating new therapy for DME.  
 
A study conducted by [CONTACT_377432].net, A Randomized Trial Comparing Intravitreal Triamcinolone 
Acetonide and Focal/grid Photocoagul ation for DME (DRCR.net Protocol B), showed triamcinolone 
as monotherapy was not superior to use with the ETDRS focal/grid laser technique for central -
involved DME.  Results from a DRCR.net study (“Intravitreal Ranibizumab or Triamcinolone 
Acetonide  in Co mbination with Laser Photocoagulation for Diabetic Macular Edema”(DRCR.net 
Protocol  I) indicate that treatment for DME with intravitreal anti -vascular endothelial growth factor 
(anti- VEGF) therapy (0.5 mg ranibizumab) plus deferred (>24 weeks) or prompt focal/grid laser 
provides visual acuity outcomes at one year and two years that are superior to prompt focal/grid laser 
alone or intravitreal triamcinolone with prompt focal/grid laser, providing definitive confirmation of 
the important role of VEGF in DME  and the role of anti -VEGF drugs in the treatment of DME. 
These results with ranibizumab DME therapy were confirmed with other phase 3 trials, including the 
RISE, RIDE and RESTORE studies. Participants in RISE and RIDE were randomized to continuous 
monthly  0.5 or 0.3 mg ranibizumab versus sham injections as treatment for DME with macular laser 
available to all treatment arms. The percentage of individuals gaining > 15 letters from baseline  
at 24 months was significantly higher in the ranibizumab groups in b oth studies. In RESTORE, both 
ranibizumab (0.5mg) monotherapy and combination ranibizumab+laser treatment resulted in better 
visual acuity outcomes than laser alone in patients with DME. Ranibizumab therapy was well -
tolerated in these studies although the overall rate of Antiplatelet Trialists’ Collaboration events was 
slightly higher in the 0.3 mg (5.6%) and 0.5 mg (7.2%) groups as compared with the sham group 
(5.2%) in the pooled data from the RISE and RIDE studies. Deaths were also more frequent in the 
ranibizumab groups (0.8% and 1.6% of sham and 2.4 -4.8% of ranibizumab treated patients) in these 
trials. The rate of non -fatal cerebrovascular events in this pooled analysis was numerically higher in 
the 0.5mg group (2%) than in the sham (1.2%) or 0.3mg gro up (0.8%) but the rate of non -fatal 
myocardial infarctions was similar across treatment groups (2.8%, 2.8% and 2.4% in the sham, 
 0.3mg and 0.5mg groups, respectively.  The results of the RISE and RIDE studies led to the FDA’s 
approval of 0.[ADDRESS_829650] of care 
for DME.  
 
Aflibercept is composed of key domains from human VEGF receptors 1 and 2 fused to the Fc 
domain of human IgG1 and has approximately 100 -fold greater binding affinity to VEGF -A than  
either bevacizumab or ranibizumab.  Intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI; also known in the 
scientific literature as VEGF Trap -Eye or IVT -AFL) was recently demonstrated to have clinically 
equivalent efficacy to monthly ranibizumab in neovascular age -related macular degeneration 
(AMD), whether it was administered monthly or by a more convenient every two months regimen 
following three initial monthly doses.  
 
The VISTA and VIVID studies are the first phase 3 studies directly comparing VEGF -blockade 
alone with laser alone in DME. The studies demonstrated mean BCVA gains from baseline to week 
52 in the IAI 2q4 and 2q8 groups vs the laser group were 12.5 and 10.7 vs 0.2 letters ( P<0.0001) in 
VISTA, and 10.5 and 10.7 vs 1.2 letters ( P<0.0001) in VIVID. The cor responding proportions of 
eyes gaining ≥15 letters were 41.6% and 31.1% vs 7.8% ( P<0.0001) in VISTA, and 32.4% and 
33.3% vs 9.1% ( P<0.0001) in VIVID. Similarly, mean reductions in central retinal thickness were 
185.9 and 183.1 vs 73.3 µm ( P<0.0001) in VIST A, and 195.0 and 192.4 vs 66.2 µm ( P<0.0001) in 
VIVID. Overall incidences of ocular and non -ocular adverse events and serious adverse events, 
including the Anti -Platelet Trialists’ Collaboration -defined arterial thromboembolic events and 
vascular deaths, w ere similar across treatment groups. IAI demonstrated significant superiority in 
functional and anatomic endpoints over laser at week [ADDRESS_829651] led to the recent FDA 
approval of IAI for DME with 2q8 week dosing after 5 consecutive monthly d oses. Thus, IAI dosed 
every 8 weeks (after 5 initial monthly doses) could provide a therapeutic option that may reduce the 
total number of injections and necessary office visits, substantially reducing burden on patients, 
physicians, and the health care sy stem.  More recently, DRCR protocol T demonstrated IAI has 
superior visual acuity outcomes compared to bevacizumab or ranibizumab  and bevacizumab  for eyes 
with DME and baseline visual acuity <20/[ADDRESS_829652] thickness at one year decreased 
on average by 169 µm ( IAI),  147 µm (ranibizumab) , and 101 µm (bevacizumab)  (P < .001 for both 
IAI vs. Bevacizumab and Ranibizumab vs. Bevacizumab ; P=.036 for IAI  vs. Ranbizumab ). At [ADDRESS_829653] thickness at two years 
decreased on average by 171 µm (IAI ), 149 µm (ranibizumab) and 126 µm (bevacizumab) 
demonstrating superior anat omic  improvement via IAI  and ranibizumab  over bevacizumab  (P<.001 
for IAI  vs. Bevacizumab and Ranibizumab vs. Bevacizumab ; P=.26 for IAI  vs. Ranibizumab) .  
 
With the above confirmation of the important role and efficacy of anti -VEGF therapy for DME, 
bevacizuma b has evolved to be commonly used as an off -label DME therapy by [CONTACT_623056]. 
Bevacizumab has been shown to potentially be efficacious for DME and is low cost and readily 
available and used by [CONTACT_623056].   
With FDA approval and availability o f IAI for DME, many eyes with persistent DME after 
bevacizumab and ranibizumab, may be switched to IAI. While previous experience and smaller 
reports exist for comparing and switching from one anti -VEGF agent to another anti -VEGF agent, 
there is limited ex perience with switching from bevacizumab/ranibizumab to the now approved IAI. 
It is likely that a common clinical scenario for switching from previous bevacizumab/ranibizumab to 
IAI will occur in eyes with persistent DME or in eyes with resolved DME after frequent anti -vegf 
injections in an attempt to reduce frequent dosing when recurrent DME occurs.   In light of the 
DRCR T results, IAI may be optimal therapy for persistent DME after previous anti -VEGF therapy.  
 
The DRCR network protocol U has initiated a t rial to assess the short -term effects of 
combination steroid+anti -VEGF therapy on retinal thickness on OCT and visual acuity in 
comparison with that of continued anti -VEGF therapy alone in pseudophakic eyes with persistent 
central -involved DME and visual a cuity impairment despi[INVESTIGATOR_623037] -VEGF treatment. The trial 
has revised enrollment criteria as recruitment of eligible eyes has been challenging.  Thus, 
prospective and rigorous assessment of alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_623038] - VEGF therapy may be more difficult than anticipated.  
 
We fortunately have a potential population of eyes with persistent DME enrolled in the 
ROTATE study evaluating the safety and efficacy of 0.3 mg ranibizumab in eyes with persistent 
DME after  recent and frequent bevacizumab (at least [ADDRESS_829654] 6 bevacizumab injections within 8 months of enrollment). In order to 
evaluate potential differences in dosing regimens  of ranibizumab after prev ious bevacizumab, eyes 
were randomized to 12 monthly required injections of 0.3 mg ranibizumab over 1 year or 6 monthly 
required injections of 0.3 mg ranibizumab for 6 months, followed by [CONTACT_214605] (required 
 ranibizumab if DME persistent on OCT and ETDRS BCVA <20/20) for [ADDRESS_829655] thickness was 116 m overall, with a 92 m and a 
127 m decrease in the Sustained and PRN groups, respectively. The ocular and systemic safety 
signals  observed  were consistent with other anti -VEGF trials in the DME population.  These eyes 
represent a unique cohort for evaluation of IAI in eyes with persistent DME after chronic, recent and 
frequent anti - VEGF therapy. In addition, the larger, prospective anti -VEGF DME studies such as 
RISE/RIDE, DRCR protocol T comparing aflibercept, bevacizumab and ranibizumab, and 
VIVID/VISTA have required a washout period of at least 3 months without anti -VEGF therapy. Our 
cohort is unique in that eyes with more recent anti -VEGF therapy can prospectively be evaluated 
when switched to another anti -VEGF agent.    
 
This cohort provide d to opportunity to evaluate if IAI can improve anatomic and visual 
outcomes in eyes with persistent DME despi[INVESTIGATOR_623039] -term bevacizumab and /or 0.3 mg  or 0.5 
mg ranibizumab. In addition, improvement or maintenance of anatomic and visual outcomes will be 
evaluated with q 8weeks  dosing with IAI.  Given the favorable IAI DRCR protocol T results at 1 year , 
as well as trends at year two especially  of IAI compared to bevacizumab, evaluation of switching 
chronic DME eyes to IAI  remains important. Amendment I (9 May  2016) was created to expand the 
inclusion criteria to include additional patients with persistent DME undergoing treatment with 
bevacizumab and/or ranibizumab beyond those that had been previously enrolled in the ROTA TE 
trial.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_829656] 
required lengthy washout periods and may not represent the frequent clinical scenario where 
switching to a different anti -VEGF agent is considered.  Switching to IAI will and is often 
considered given the results of DRCR protocol T as well as the less frequent recommended IAI 
dosing with q8 weeks.  The proposed study will provide important data in a prospective manner  
regarding outcomes when switching to IAI for eyes with recalcitrant DME after frequent and 
recent bevacizumab and /or ranibizumab.   
 1.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection  
Phase 3 clinic al trials evaluated 2 mg IAI administered every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks for 3 
years. Additionally, 2mg IAI has been approved for the treatment of choroidal 
neovascularization due to age -related macular degeneration , retinal vein occlusion  and diabetic 
macular edema .

reasons.  An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal of patients  will be avoided.  
 
Should a patient  (or a patient’s  legally authorized guardian or representative) decide to withdraw, all 
efforts will be made to complete and report observations as thoroughly as possible.  Early 
termination procedures will be followed.  
 
4.4 Replacement of Patients  
Patients prematurely discontinued from the study will not be replaced.  
 
5. STU DY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Investigational Treatment  
The study treatment is 2.0 mg IAI, which will be supplied at a concentration of 40 mg/mL solution 
for intravitreal injection in a single -use vial.  The injection volume will be 50 μL (0.05 mL) and will 
be administered  to the patients by [CONTACT_63385].   
 
Study eyes will receive 5 required initial monthly IAI doses of 2 mg followed by 2q8 IAI for a total 
of 52 weeks.   
  
Starting at week  20 patients may be eligible to receive additional 2mg IAI (2q4) treatment if  both of 
the following criteria is met and the investigator feels additional treatment would be beneficial:  
 Loss of >[ADDRESS_829666] recorded BCVA  
 Presence of new or recurrent intraretinal fluid or subretinal fluid as assessed by  [CONTACT_623055] 24, rescue therapy with macular laser photocoagulation may be administered if any 
the following criteria are met  
 Loss of > [ADDRESS_829667] previously recorded BCVA and loss of acuity felt to be 
secondary to DME a nd not from other cause (i.e., cataract, epi[INVESTIGATOR_43691], vitreous 
hemorrhage, etc) and investigator feels patient would benefit from rescue therapy  
 Increase in SD OCT CSF > [ADDRESS_829668] the right to withdraw from the study at any  time for any reason.  
 
The patient  may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: if it is in the best 
interest of the patient , intercurrent illness, adverse events, or worsening condition. Southeast 
Retina Center of [CONTACT_623069]  may request the withdrawal of a patient  due to protocol 
violations, administrative reasons, or any other valid or ethical reason.  
 
If a patient  discontinues from the study, they will not be allowed to re -enter the study.  
Reasons for patient  discontinuation m ay include, but are not limited to:  
 Investigator determination that it is not in the best interest of the patient  to 
continue participation for any reason  
 Pregnancy  
 Need for alternative therapy in the study eye  
  Any serious adverse event  
 Safety concerns  
 
5.[ADDRESS_829669] Retina Center  or Regeneron may terminate this study  at any time. Reasons for 
terminating the study include, but are not limited to:  
 The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies using intravitreal 
aflibe rcept indicating that there is a potential health hazard to patient s 
 Patient  enrollment is unsatisfactory

5.4 Treatment Logistics and Accountability  
5.4.1 Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
2.0 mg intravitreal aflibercept in jection is formulated as a sterile liquid to a final concentration 
of 40 mg/mL intravitreal aflibercept injection in 5% sucrose, 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.3, 
0.03% polysorbate 20, and 40 mM NaCl. Intravitreal aflibercept injection 2.0 mg study drug will 
be supplied by [CONTACT_393798]. in sealed, sterile 3 mL vials with a 
“withdrawable” volume of approximately 0.[ADDRESS_829670] be used only once (defined as 
entered with a needle). The volume of injection will be 0.05 mL for the 2 mg dose. Fo r study 
drug in vials, the study drug will be withdrawn using aseptic technique.  
 
Study drug will be shipped to the site via overnight shippi[INVESTIGATOR_623042] a 
temperature of 2° to 8° C. The Investigator, or an approved representative (e.g.  pharmacist), will 
ensure that all study drugs are stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions 
and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. The shippi[INVESTIGATOR_623043] a refrigerat or intended for investigational products at a 
temperature of 2° to 8°C.  
 
When vials are removed from the refrigerator, the solution should be visually inspected and it 
should have no evidence of turbidity. If particulates, cloudiness, or discoloration are  visible, the 
vial must not be used. Exposure of the material to temperatures outside these limits, except for 
warming prior to administration, is not recommended and may result in loss of activity. Records 
 of actual storage conditions (i.e. temperature lo g) at the study site must be maintained; and must 
include a record of the dates, when the refrigerator was checked, the initials of person checking, 
and the temperature.  
 
5.4.2 Supply and Disposition of Treatments  
Study drug will be shipped  at a temperature of 2 ° to 8°C  to the investigator or designee at 
regular intervals or as needed during the study. At the end of the study, and following drug 
reconciliation and documentation , all used and unused vials will be returned or disposed of 
according to Regeneron IST standard operating procedures.  
 
5.4.3 Treatment Accountability  
All drug accountability records will be kept current.  
The investigator will account for all opened and unopened vials of study drug.  These records 
will contain the dates, quantity, and study medicat ion: 
 dispensed to each patient – or –  
 disposed of at the site or returned to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or designee  
All accountability records will be made available for inspection by [CONTACT_623057]’s  
treatment compliance.  
 
5.5 Concomitant M edications  
5.5.1 Study Eye  
Patients may not receive any medications (approved or investigational) for DME in the study 
eye other than the assigned study treatment (2 mg IAI) until they have completed the end of the 
study (week 52) or early termination visit.  Th is includes medications administered locally (eg 
IVT, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], juxtascleral, or periorbital routes), as well as those administered systemically, with 
the intent of treating the study eye and/or fellow eye.  
 
5.5.2 Fellow eye  
If a patient requires anti -VEGF  therap y in the fellow eye, IAI  will be utilized per investigator 
discretion  (IAI provided by [CONTACT_112608]). Follow -up visits for study eye occur every 4 weeks for  
52 weeks.  The fellow eye may receive treatment on the same day as the study eye or at an 
 unscheduled v isit but it will not be considered an additional study eye. Safety of the fellow eye 
will be monitored and all AEs will be collected.  
 
5.5.3 Permitted Medications  
Any other medication that are considered necessary for the patient’s welfare, and that are not 
expe cted to interfere with the evaluation of the study drug, may be given at the discretion of the 
investigator.

6.1.[ADDRESS_829672] a causal relationship with the study drug.  Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory fin ding), symptom, or disease which is 
temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.   
 
An AE also includes any worsening (i.e. any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a pr e-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_829673] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrel ated 
to study drug (e.g. a car accident in which a patient  is a passenger).  
 Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient  is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event.  This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
 Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869].  In -
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24927] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101803] 24 hours.  Prolongation of exis ting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_623046], or is prolonged due to 
the development of a new AE as determined by [CONTACT_31598].  
 Results in persistent or significan t disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of one’s 
ability to conduct normal life functions).  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is an important medical event – Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient  or 
may require intervention to prevent 1 of the other serious outcomes listed above (e.g., 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that d o not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse).  Any malignancy (other than basal cell skin cancers) would 
be considered a medically important event.  
7.2 Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs will be recorde d on the CRF and in the patient’s source documents.  
 
Vital sign abnormalities will be recorded as AEs only if they are medically relevant.  
 
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of causal relationship to study drug will be reported to 
Regeneron Pharmaceutical s, Inc.  
 
The investigator will promptly report to the IRB all unanticipated problems involving risks to 
patients. This includes death from any cause and all SAEs related to the use of the study drug. 
All SAEs will be reported to the IRB, regardless of asse ssed causality.  
 
7.2.1 Deaths  
Any AE that results in death is considered an SAE. Deaths that occur from the time the patietns 
signs the ICF until 30 days after dosing will be reported to the appropriate IRB and to Regeneron 
Pharmacovigilance and Risk Manaagemen t (or designee) within 24 hours of learning of the 
death.  
Any available autopsy reports and relevant medical reports will be sent to Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as soon as possible.  
To report an SAE, Regeneron will be contact[CONTACT_308846]:  
 [EMAIL_6084]  
  Fax: (914) 345 -7476  
 SAE hotline: (914) 593 -1504  
 
7.2.2 Pregnancy and Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting  
The following events will be reported to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. within 24 hours of 
learning of the event:  
1. Overdose : Accidental or intentional overdose of the study drug or concomitant medication, 
whether or not it is considered an AE . 
2. Pregnancy: Although it is not considered an AE, the investigator will report to  Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., any pregnancy occurring in a female patient  or female partner of a 
male patient , during the study or within [ADDRESS_829674] dose of study drug.  The 
investigator will follow the pregnancy until delivery, or long er.  If the pregnancy continues 
to term (delivery), the health of the infant will also be reported to Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
These AEs will be reported to:  
[EMAIL_6084]  
 Fax: (91 4) 345 -7476  
 SAE hotline: (914) 593 -1504  
 
7.2.3 Reporting Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from the Study  
All AEs that lead to a patient ’s withdrawal from the study will be reported to Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals Inc. within 30 days. All SAEs leading to a patient’s withdrawal from the study 
will be reported. To report an SAE, Regeneron will be contact[CONTACT_308846]:  
[EMAIL_6084]  
 Fax: (914) 345 -7476  
 SAE hotline: (914) [ADDRESS_829675] finding will be reported as an 
AE are as follows:  
 the test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
  the test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/ surgical intervention, and/or  
 the test result leads to a change in dosing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose adjustments), 
discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other 
therapy.  
 
Repeating an abnormal test, i n the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. 
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_829676] make every effort to obtain follow -up information on the outcome of any 
SAE until the event is considered chronic and/or stable.  
 
7.3 Evaluation of Severity  
The severity of an AE will be graded by [CONTACT_55296] a 3 –point scale (mild, moderate, or 
severe) and reported in detail as indicated on the CRF and/or SAE form, as appropriate.  
 Mild:   Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient’ s normal functioni ng level.  It 
may be an annoyance.  Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptoms, but 
may be given because of personality of the  patient . 
 Moderate:   Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health.  It is 
uncom fortable or an embarrassment.  Treatment for symptom may be needed.  
 Severe:   Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a definite 
hazard to the patient ’s health.  Treatment for symptom may be given and/or patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity will be based on the degree of physiological 
impairment the value indicates.    
 
7.4 Evaluation of Causality  
The relationship to treatment will be determined by [CONTACT_623058] d/or 
SAE form, as appropriate.  The following terms will be used:  
Not Related:   likely or clearly due to causes other than the study drug.  
 Related:   possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug.

16. APPENDIX 1  
Injection Procedure  
Intravitreal aflibercept injection is formulated as a sterile liquid to a final concentration of 40 mg/mL. 
The volume of injection will be 50 l (0.05 mL) for the [ADDRESS_829686] be adhered to for administration of the dose in this clinical trial.   
 Preparation  (please see below regarding the optional use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_623050]):  
a. Apply topi [INVESTIGATOR_15413].  
b. Apply povidone iodine to eyelid margins, eyelashes, and con junctival surface.  For patients 
who have a known sensitivity to povidone iodine, another equally effective agent may be 
used.  
c. Place 1 or 2 drops of 5% povidone -iodine on the ocula r surface at the intended injection site.  
d. Optional:  inject 0.5 mL of 2% xylocaine without epi[INVESTIGATOR_623051]; (the entry site of the needle for the intravitreous injection should be 
3.0-3.5 mm from the limbus in aphakic/pseudophakic patients, and 3.5 -4.0 mm in the phakic 
patients).   
e. Single us e Proparacaine bottles should be used for all patients. “Fluoracaine” or other 
combination Fluorescein Sodium and Proparacaine HCl mixtures should NOT be used.  
f. Apply addition al drop of povidone -iodine to site of injection.  
 
 Study Drug Administration:  
a. Inser t needle at marked injection point.  
b. Gently inject study drug.  
c. As the needle is withdrawn, a sterile cotton tip applicator should be rolled over the entry site 
to minimize t he risk of drug reflux. This should be held in place for a full 10 seconds.  
 
 Post-Injection Procedures  
Measure patient’s IOP before the end of the observation period for each injection.  See guidelines below 
for additional post -injection management procedu res.   
 
Guidelines for Pre and Post -injection Management  
  Use of Topi[INVESTIGATOR_623052], the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_623053], both in the 
preparation and post injection varies considerably between the  different practices. There is no consensus 
on the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_8163], the agen t to be used and the dose to be administered. In this protocol, it 
is recommended that a broad -spectrum topi[INVESTIGATOR_623054], and as prophylaxis in the days immediately fo llowing the injection.   
 
Suggested use:  
o Instruct the patient to self -administer [ADDRESS_829687] the patient to self -administer 1 -2 drops of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] a ntibiotic to 
the injected eye, 3 times a day, for additional 3 days.  
 
 Post-injecti on reperfusion of the optic nerve  
Visualize the optic nerve to verify reperfusion of the central retinal artery in the immediate post -injection 
period.  Verify intravitreal l ocation of therapeutic agent when possible.  Verify that the retina is attached 
and that there is no new intraocular hemorrhage.  
 
 Intraocular pressure  
Monitor intraocular pressure (IOP) before the end of the approximate [ADDRESS_829688] 
each injection.  Check the IOP while maintaining a clean field.   Monitor the IOP cl osely until it is below 
30 mm Hg. If a Tono -pen™ is used to check pressure, a clean Tono -pen™ condom should be placed on 
the tip before taking each measurement. If Goldmann a pplanation tonometry is used, the applanator tip 
should be swabbed with alcohol and let to dry before using it to measure IOP.  IOP may be lowered by 
[CONTACT_623067], if required.   Treatment should be initiated whenever IOP is 
incre ased to the extent that the central retinal artery remains closed and the patient has no light 
perception for more than [ADDRESS_829689] all IOP measurements in the source document and on the 
appropriate eCRF page, and  related treatments in the concomitant medications section of the source 
documents and the eCRF.  
 
 Discharge  
No special precautions are required before discharge of a patient who has had an u neventful recovery 
from intravitreal injection, but patients and/or caregivers should be educated to avoid rubbing the eye 
and to recognize the signs and symptoms of endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, or intraocular 
hemorrhage; these are eye pain or incr eased discomfort, increased redness of the eye (compared to 
immediately after injection), blurred or decreased vision, and increased ocular sensitivity to light.  
Patients should be informed that some blurring of vision is common post -injection, which is o ften 
described as seeing spots floating in the eye.  The floaters usually resolve after a few days or weeks.  
Patients who experience post -injection adverse events that require additional monitoring should remain 
in the clinic for longer than 30 minutes, a nd treated according to the investigator’s medical judgment.

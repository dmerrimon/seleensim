To input text click in the light grey area below.  
Purpose : 
To assess  the impact of Driscoll Health Plan’s Nurture program on pregnancy outcomes among 
participating members.  
 
Background : 
Driscoll Health Plan (DHP) is a non -profit, community -based health insurance plan that 
provides coverage to South [LOCATION_007] and the Rio Grande  Valley communities. Their insurance 
products include STAR Medicaid, STAR Kids, CHIP, and CHIP Perinatal. Affiliated with Driscoll 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], DHP offers healthcare services at specialty centers and clinics in various 
locations, including McAllen,  Harlingen, Brownsville, Laredo, Rio Grande City, Eagle Pass, 
Edinburg, Victoria, and Weslaco.  
 
Maternal health has gained increasing attention . Senate Bill (S.B.) 750, 86th Legislature, 
Regular Session, 2019, Section 3 , for example,  mandates the [LOCATION_007] Hea lth and Human Services 
Commission (HHSC) to develop or enhance statewide initiatives for improving the quality of 
maternal health care services  (Kolkhorst, 2019). It specifies initiatives that contracted managed 
care organizations (MCOs) must implement and  requires progress reporting to the legislature 
MCOs are also encouraged to incorporate their own initiatives to enhance maternal healthcare 
services.  
 
In response, DHP , with input from our Factor Health lab at Dell Med ical School , introduced the 
Nurture p rogram  for its members  as a quality improvement initiative , designed to expand 
members ’ access to nutrition education and food purchase support to improve health and 
pregnancy outcomes.  
 
DHP’s Nurture Program:  
 
Page 3 of 16 
 The Nurture  program focuse d on promoting healt hy eating through nutrition education and 
food purchasing support with monthly  gift cards for a main  local grocery store  at the Corpus 
Christi area . Specifically, t he program includes the following components:  
 
1. Nurture Monthly Packages:  Sent every four wee ks until the member reaches the end of 
pregnancy (delivery or other reasons, e.g., miscarriage), with a maximum of eight 
packages. Each package includes:  
• A US$[ADDRESS_341881] (2 x $20 each) to a grocery store . 
• A healthy eating information sheet selected from Brighter Bites project 
(https://brighterbites.org/ ).  
• A set of three recipes.  
• Nutrition -related Frequently Asked Questions (included in four out of the eight 
packages).  
 
2. Two 30 -Minute Nutritional Consultations  over the phone : Designed by a Registered 
Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) who trained a bilingual nutrition specialist to deliver the 
consultations . Topi[INVESTIGATOR_280121], such as food 
choices, portion sizes, budget -friendly sh oppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], food safety, and food preparation.  No 
nutrition therapy advice to manage diseases was provided.  
 
Members ha d the flexibility to opt out of the program at any time and discontinue receiving 
packages. Consultations were  optional . If they opted out, t hey continued to receive the DHP 
benefits as part of their regular coverage . 
 
Secondary Data Analysis Proposal:  With funding from the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_280122], we 
will conduct a secondary data analysis to evaluate  the DHP’s  Nurture program using their 
existing administrative data from claims.

under certain health care programs . (S.B. 750). 86th Legislature, Regular Session .

[ADDRESS_341882] of DHP’s quality improvement pi[INVESTIGATOR_29426] (called, 
Nurture ), which included nutrition education and food support  offered  to a subset of 
pregnant women age d 30 years and above and were covered by [CONTACT_280128] 4 of 16 
 Care Organization (MCO) plan in their “STAR” and “CHIP” programs during October 
2022 and Ju ly 2023 .  
 
From this population, DHP randomly selected a subset of approximately 500 women 
during that period , from which approximately 200 were in the program , the “exposed  
group .” The women who were covered during the same period but were not selected  
were not exposed  to the program  and will compose the “ comparison group .” 
 
The objective is to compare maternal and neonatal outcomes between those who 
participated in the program  (exposed group) and those who did not  (comparison 
group) . 
 
Analysis Plan:  
Claims data will be pulled retrospectively from the insurer's database  and other 
administrative sources . Informati on will include healthcare utilization, maternal 
outcomes  during pregnancy , and neonatal outcomes at and post -delivery . The primary 
analysis i nvolve s comparing the outcomes of the exposed  group with the comparison 
group . Statistical methods appropriate for this type of administrative  data will be 
employed to assess the differences between the two groups, adjusting for potential 
confounders.  
 
The Nurture  program’s impact will be evaluated using  claims data received from DHP  
concerning two composite outcomes: adverse maternal health outcomes (Composite 1) 
and adverse neonatal outcomes (Composite 2), as shown in Table 1 below. In addition, 
we wil l explore single outcomes, such as delivery mode (vaginal vs c -section) , cost data,  
and birthweight,  adding nuance to our understanding of the program's impact.  
 
We will primarily use logistic regressions to predict the primary, binary composite 
outcomes for mothers and newborns, adjust ed for risk factors such as maternal age, 
gestation al age at the time of enrollment, pre -existing diabetes, hypertension, and 
being overweight pre -pregnancy (shown in Table 2). The program “dose ” variables are 
anticipated to  be continuous predictors that include both ‘usual care’ (i.e., prenatal care 
visits) and Nurture  program elements (the dollar value of the gift cards spent up to 30 
days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_280123], total number of nutrition consult minutes); see Table 
3.  
Because we expect cost data to be continuously distributed, linear regressions are 
expected to be more appropriate. The predictors will remain the same in all models 
irrespective of outcome, including the “dose ” variables.

DHP’s Nurture enrollment : 
1. DHP receive s daily new health plan enrollees from the TX State. Their data 
analytics team identified new pregnant members aged 30 or older  in bi -weekly 
“cycles”  and ran an algorithm to randomly select a list of names to be notified 
and contact[CONTACT_280129]’s Community Health Workers (CHWs).  
2. Notifications: Members on the roster to be called received an SMS text with a 
URL to an informational page , which was also mailed as  a hard copy to the 
member’s address  on file . 
3. Welcome calls: DHP’s CHWs called up to [ADDRESS_341883], confirm address for 
mailing out the packages, and book two phone nutrition al consultations.  
o Individuals who could not be reached by [CONTACT_280130].

The end of participation in the program is marked by [CONTACT_280131] (in 
the form of a claim to the health plan that would flag delivery or a 
miscarriage/abortion/stillbirth ). If such a claim does not reach DHP’s system  in a timely 
manner , the woman in the Nurture  program could receive up to 8 mailo ut packages.  
 
The [LOCATION_007] Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) reviewed and approved key 
member -facing materials, such as SMS text and the informational letter , as part of their 
regular review process of member -facing materials.  
 
Third group: The wom en who were selected to be offered the program, but DHP staff 
could not connect during telephonic outreach , compose a third group. Administrative 
data on this group will enable us to explore how they compare with the other two 
groups in terms of their popu lation descriptors and demographics shown in Table 2 
above . Answering evaluation questions such as how do those who were reached by [CONTACT_280132]’t, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_280125].

To input text click in the light grey area below.  
 
Members of the Driscoll Health Plan could be enrolled in the program if they were 
pregnant and aged [ADDRESS_341885] to receive data from approximately 1700 DHP members broken down as the 
following (approximate numbers):  
 
Page 9 of 16 
 • Exposed group: DHP selected [ADDRESS_341886] and, therefore, 
could not confirm address and book consultations . We will rec eive the 
demographic data on this group to explore how they compare with the 
other two groups  in terms of their population descriptors  (Table 2 in 
section 3) . 
• Comparison group: approximately 1200 women who were 30 years old or older 
and pregnant during the  same enrollment period  and were not selected during 
the DHP’s enrollment process.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_341887] ing statistically 
significant differences more challenging , requi ring l arger sample sizes to ensure the 
reliability of the findings in such studies using these binary  outcomes —which is the case 
of Nurture.  
 
Statistical power is critically dependent  on the base rate of the outcome metrics among 
the comparison subjects . But, when the comparison group is composed of  unmatched 
subjects that is at least  four times the size of the exposure group, s tatistical power  
tends to be maximize d.  
 
That being said, the analysis needs to include all women as described in the previous 
section.  
 
Because we do not know the incidence rate of the outcomes of interest, w e estimated 
the effect sizes we can capture at 80% power with alpha = 0.05 assuming different rates 
among comparison subjects  (30% and 35%) and four different rates among exposed 
subjects  (25%, 23%, 20%, 18%).  
 
Table [ADDRESS_341888] differences between the exposed 
and comparison groups, assuming Nurture  produces certain effects . If the composite 
outcome rate is around 30% among comparison subjec ts, we have enough power to

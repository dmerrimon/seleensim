TITLE: A comparison of two different platelet -rich plasma injections for patellar tendinosis: a 
randomized, double  blinded comparative trial.   
 
I. Objective:  
The purpose of this study is to compare two different platelet -rich plasma (PRP) in jections for patellar 
tendinosis.   
Introduction/Background:  
Patellar tendinosis is a frustrating ailment commonly encountered in sports medicine . Treating this 
condition continues to be a significant challenge for sports medicine physicians .3, 11, 13  The tendinosis 
lesion is ch aracterized by [CONTACT_66480].  One method of 
treating this problem is using platelet rich plasma (PRP), which is a concentration of platelets from the 
patient’s own blood that provides a high dose of growth factors  aimed at stimulating tendon healing.  
These injections have been used extensively to treat many tendon disorders including patellar 
tendinosis.  Several studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of using PRP to treat patellar 
tendinosis.1, 2, 4 -6, 12, 14   
 
One growth factor that is known to be helpful in tendon healing is insulin -like gr owth factor (IGF).7, 9  
However, IGF  is not found  in PRP but rather  in the free plasma that is spun off during the PRP 
processing .8 This free plasma or platelet poor plasma  (PPP)  is typi[INVESTIGATOR_66477] a known source 
of IGF.  We have shown that concentrating PPP in the FDA cleared Plasmax device yields an increased 
concentration of IGF.[ADDRESS_72279] on clinical outcomes h as never been studied in a controlled fashion.7 
 
Aim: To perform a randomized, double  blinded study  comparing the clinical effect of PRP versus PRP + 
concentrated IGF in patients w ith patellar tendinosis.    
   
III. Procedures:  
A. Research Design:  Double  blinded randomized comparative trial.  
B. Patients:  
Sample: 38 total volunteers (19 per treatment arm, accounting for 15% dropout with goal of 16

difference).

Outcome measures  (all assessed at baseline, 1,3 and 6 months).     
1) Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment -patellar tendon (VISA -P) 
2) Visual analog scale -Pain with ADL and S port  (VAS -P ADL and VAS -P Sport)   
3) Tegner activity scale  
4) Marx scale  
5) Blazina  
 
Ultrasound measurements (performed at clinic visit at no additional cost) at baseline and 6 
months  
1) Tendon thickness  
2) Modified Ohberg scale  
Primary outcome:  VISA -P at 6 months .   
 
In the case of competitive athletics, we will monitor time to return to sport .  We will also 
monitor continuously for adverse events.

Outcomes will be completed by [CONTACT_60572] ([CONTACT_66483]) who will be blinded to the treatment 
allocation.   
 
D. Detailed Study Procedures: 38  patients  will be randomly assigned using a computer randomization 
scheme (from RedCap) to a treatment arm, with [ADDRESS_72284] 
sterile procedures out of view of the patient to ensure patients are adequately blinded.  The injecting  
physician (Baria) will not be blinded to randomization scheme.   
 
 
 
 
PRP: 
Procedure will be carried out with excellent sterile technique.  54ml of whole blood will be drawn .  54ml 
will be processed by [CONTACT_66481] (Zimmer Biomet , Warsaw, IN) and 1 ml will 
undergo a complete blood count (for a baseline comparison to determine the fold increase in platelets).   
The resultant PRP ( 5ml) will be injected (after 5ml 1% lidocaine has been injected into the skin for 
comfort) into the patellar tendon using ultrasound guidance to accurately direct the injection to the site 
of the tendon abnormality.  The patient will rest after the injection for 15 minutes and then be 
dismissed.      
 
PRP + concentrated IGF  
The PRP preparation  and blood draw  will be identical to the above.  55ml of whole blood will be drawn 
(1ml will undergo a CBC and the remaining 54 ml will be used to make PRP).  In addition to preparing the 
PRP, the  resultant  PPP (instead of discarding it) will be placed into  the Plasmax device (Zimmer Biomet, 
Warsaw, IN) and concentrated via a second  centrifugation cycle.  The plasmax concentrate 
(concentrated IGF) will be  added to the PRP (3ml of PRP + 2ml of plasmax concentrate for a total of 5ml) 
and then  will be  injected  (after 5ml 1% lidocaine has been injected into the skin for comfort)  under 
ultrasound guidance followed by [CONTACT_66482].  
The injection volume for each group will be identical (5ml total).  
*For each patient, 1ml of whole blood of 1ml of PRP will be tested for a total cell count*   
 
After Care  
Patients will avoid NSAIDs for the remainder of the trial.  They may ice  and use Tylenol .  
For the 1st month, patients will be given a home rehabilitation plan consisting of range of motion and 
gentle strengt hening.  
In month 2, they will be allowed to return to sport as tolerated.  
 
F. Data Analysis: Continuous variables will be checked for normality and subsequently compared using 
either unpaired t -tests (for normally distributed data) or Mann -Whitney U test (for non -normally 
distributed data.  
 
Patient incentive:

7. INTRODUCTION 7.1  Background Information 
Liver disease is one of the leading co-morbidities of HIV-infection, highly prevalent even 
in those without hepatitis B or C co-infection.  Studies of hepatitis B- and C-negative adults with treated HIV demonstrate 20-60% prevalence of elevated liver enzymes [1-4].  Among this 
group, 60-70% of HIV-monoinfected individuals with elevated liver enzymes have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [5, 6].  NAFLD may also be present in the absence of liver enzyme 
elevation, and, overall, it is estimated to occur in up to 30-40% of patients with HIV [7, 8].   
 NAFLD is of significant concern in the context of HIV-infection for two reasons.  First, the 
disease spectrum of NAFLD encompasses not only steatosis but also inflammation, hepatocellular damage, and fibrosis, which are hallmarks of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).  NASH, in turn, may progress to cirrhos is and eventual liver failure. NASH is also a 
significant risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma [9].  Second, NAFLD is strongly associated with visceral adiposity and other cardiometabolic abnormalities, including insulin resistance (IR) 
and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [7]. Abundant  evidence suggests a causal link between 
NAFLD and IR, and emerging data suggest that NAFLD may also be causal in CVD. Thus, 
understanding NAFLD in HIV and developi[INVESTIGATOR_434642].    
Accumulation of triglyceride (TG) in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes is the sine qua non of 
NAFLD.  Sources of hepatic TG are (i) dietary fats; (ii) uptake of circulating free fatty acid (FFA), mediated by [CONTACT_434666] (primarily FATP2 and FATP5); and (iii) hepatic DNL whereby [CONTACT_261172],  particularly during conditions of carbohydrate 
excess [10, 11].  Investigation with stable isotope tracers suggests that approximately 59% of hepatic TG are from uptake of circulating FFA , 25% from hepatic DNL, and 15% from the diet 
[10].  We hypothesize that both hepatic FFA flux – and therefore FFA uptake – and hepatic DNL are increased in HIV-infected individuals with NAFLD, and, further, that GHRH treatment may decrease these two processes and thereby [CONTACT_434667].    Hepatic DNL is stimulated by [CONTACT_52004], acting through carbohydrate response element 
binding protein (ChREBP), and by [CONTACT_134755], acting through sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c).  Activation of these transcription factors increases the expression of 
lipogenic genes, including acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), both of 
which encode enzymes in the pathway through which glucose is used as a precursor to produce palmitate.  Importantly, even in the context of significant hepatic IR, insulin retains the ability to promote lipogenesis in the liver [12-14].  This paradoxical preservation of hepatic DNL in the context of hepatic and whole body IR is a critical factor promoting NAFLD.  
 DNL is increased in HIV-infection [15] and in NAFLD [16, 17]. Lambert et al. have 
recently shown that DNL is more than twice as high in those with high liver fat compared to controls [16].  Moreover, DNL is significantly positively associated with quantity of intrahepatic TG [16].  Importantly, GH administration suppresses hepatic DNL both in animal models [18-22] and in individuals with HIV-associated abdominal obesity [23].  The effects of tesamorelin per se on DNL have never been investigated.  We hypothesize that one of the mechanisms by [CONTACT_434668]. 
 Free fatty acids from the circulation comprise approximately 60% of hepatic TG 
accumulation in NAFLD [10], and increased FFA flux plays an important role in the development of NAFLD, because of both increased delivery of lipid substrate and the resulting increases in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction due to lipotoxicity [24-29]. Stable isotope studies 
show strong associations between increased ad ipocyte lipolysis – resulting from impaired 
insulin suppression of lipolysis due to IR – and increased liver TG content [25, 26].  Visceral 
adipose tissue (VAT), which is highly lipolytic and re leases FFA directly to the portal circulation, 
may be particularly pathogenic. Quantity of VAT is strongly associated with NAFLD and NASH

 in both the general population [30, 31] and HIV-infected individuals [7, 8].  In vitro lipolytic 
activity of visceral but not subcutaneous adipocytes is significantly associated with increased liver fat [32, 33].  Further, fatty acids derived fr om visceral fat comprise a significantly greater 
percent of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) in individuals with fatty liver and IR than in 
controls, suggesting significantly greater hepatic fl ux of FFA derived from visceral fat in NAFLD 
[26, 34].  We have previously demonstrated that  reductions in liver fat were significantly 
associated with reductions in VAT, and we hypothesize that reduction in visceral fat, resulting in 
decreased FFA flux to the liver, is another mechanism whereby [CONTACT_434669].   
The pathophysiological mechanisms distinguishing simple steatosis from NASH are not 
yet well understood, but one mechanism thought to play a central role in the development of steatohepatitis is alteration in adipokines and inflammatory cytokines consistent with a pro-inflammatory milieu [27, 35, 36].  In particular, NASH appears to be closely linked to changes in adipose tissue production of adipokines and inflammatory cytokines.  In rodent models, a high fat diet leads to increased adipose tissue macrophage activation and pro-inflammatory gene expression within a few weeks, and the magnitude of these inflammatory changes in adipose 
tissue portends subsequent inflammatory chan ges in the liver and development of NASH 
several weeks later [37, 38].  In humans, adipose tissue expression of macrophage markers and 
inflammatory cytokines is increased in those with NAFLD, independent of obesity [39, 40].  Conversely, expression of the insulin sensitizing hormone adiponectin is decreased in NAFLD, independent of obesity [40], and adiponectin levels are significantly inversely associated with 
steatosis and features of steatohepatitis [41, 42].  Measurement of circulating adipocytokines 
shows similar results, with elevated TNF α [43] and CRP [44] and decreased serum adiponectin 
in NAFLD and NASH.  In a cohort of 80 individuals with NASH and 29 with simple steatosis, adiponectin was significantly reduced in NASH as  compared to simple steatosis, suggesting a 
role for adiponectin in preventing steatohepatitis as well as steatosis [43].  Further suggesting a 
role for adiponectin, a model of C57BL/6 mice fed high fat diet showed that treatment with 
adiponectin reverses steatosis and significantly improves inflammation [45].   
 Its contribution to a pro-inflammatory milieu is another respect in which visceral fat is likely central in the etiology of NASH.  Visceral adipose tissue shows significantly higher monocyte/macrophage infiltration compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue [46-48], as well as significantly increased expression of pro-infl ammatory cytokines and reduced expression of 
adiponectin [49-51].  As an example of the contribution of visceral cytokines to hepatic and systemic inflammation, Fontana et al. found that portal vein concentrations of IL-6 are 50% higher than those in the systemic circulation, presumably due to elevated visceral production of IL-6 [52].  In individuals with NAFLD, visceral adipose tissue volume is significantly associated with the extent of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, even after adjusting for both IR and hepatic 
lipid content, suggesting a strong contribution of visceral fat to the pathogenesis of NAFLD [31]. 
Thus we anticipate that VAT reduction achieved with GHRH analogue will be accompanied by [CONTACT_434670].  We  have previously shown that VAT reductions 
achieved with GHRH analogue are significantly associated with increases in adiponectin and improvements in fibrinolytic markers tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) [53, 54].  In the current proposal, we will perform more 
comprehensive analysis of changes in circulating inflammatory cytokines as well as hepatic 
expression of pro-inflammatory genes to better assess changes in inflammation achieved with 
GHRH treatment and associated VAT reduction in a specific HIV population with NAFLD. 
Independent of its effects to decrease VAT, we expect that GHRH analogue will have 
direct effects on hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation. Indeed, in the large Phase III 
studies leading to FDA approval of tesamorelin to reduce visceral fat, triglycerides levels 
significantly decreased in the tesamorelin vs. placebo-treated subjects (-37±139 vs. +6±112 
mg/dl, P<0.001; net difference 43mg/dL). Abundant data show the importance of the GH-IGF-[ADDRESS_550644] that deficiencies in this axis increase the risk of

 hepatosteatosis.  IGF-1 levels are lower in individuals with NAFLD compared to controls [55], 
and, among those with NAFLD, IGF-1 levels are inversely associated with degree of steatosis and fibrosis [56-58]. Further, liver IGF-1 mRNA expression is inversely associated with histological Kleiner score [56]. Supporting these findings, adults with GH deficiency due to 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_434643] a significantly higher prevalence of NAFLD than controls, and GH 
replacement improves histological findings associated with NAFLD [59-61].   
 In vitro and animal models also highlight the significance of the GH-IGF-[ADDRESS_550645] hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation in other respects.  Mice with liver-
specific GH-receptor knock-out (GHRLD) demonstrate severe hepatic steatosis, in conjunction 
with increased hepatic lipogenesis [62].  These changes are accompanied by [CONTACT_434671]1c, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- γ (PPARγ), and CD36 fatty acid 
transporter, all of which promote hepatic lipogenesis [62].  Adenovirus-mediated rescue of GHR expression reverses these changes and normalizes hepatic triglyceride output [62].  In this model, IGF-1 treatment did not reverse the phenotype, suggesting important metabolic effects 
of GH independent of IGF-1.  Other studies, how ever, demonstrate that IGF-1 also plays a 
significant role in hepatic lipid metabolism.  The spontaneous dwarf rat (SDR), which has a 
truncated GH gene resulting in severe GH deficiency, also demonstrates hepatic steatosis and fibrosis.  In the SDR model, contrasting with the GHRLD model, treatment with either GH or 
IGF-1 reverses steatosis and fibrosis [63].  On a cellular level, hepatocyte mitochondria in the 
SDR rat are small and irregularly shaped, and mRNA  expression of the rate-limiting enzyme for 
β-oxidation, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1), is significantly decreased, whereas hepatic 
expression of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), which catalyzes the first step in TG 
synthesis, is increased, consistent with increased hepatic lipogenesis [63].  Treatment with either GH or IGF-1 restores normal mitochondrial morphology and reverses the observed 
changes in gene expression [63].  Further, in vitro data show that treatment of HepG2 cells with 
IGF-1 attenuates the pro-inflammatory effects of IL-6 exposure [56], and gene transfer of IGF-1 to cirrhotic hepatic tissue decreases fibrosis and improves liver function [64].  Taken together, 
these data demonstrate potentially critical effects of GH and IGF-1 in hepatic metabolism and inflammation.  Whereas some of these effects appear to be unique to GH, acting independently of IGF-1, others may be IGF-1 mediated.   
  
7.2  Rationale   There are currently no highly effective strategies to decrease liver fat in HIV-infected patients with NAFLD. In previous work, treatment with a growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) analogue in HIV-infected individuals with abdominal adiposity reduces liver fat as 
measured by 
1H-MRS spectroscopy [65]. The current protocol builds upon these data, 
investigating GHRH analogue in a cohort specifically chosen for NAFLD.    The current protocol 
also investigates mechanisms by [CONTACT_434672]. Mechanistic study is 
particularly critical in the HIV-infected population, as metabolic changes caused by [CONTACT_434673].  For example, 
hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is known to be increased in HIV infection [15] and is also a 
critical pathway underlying NAFLD. Further, many of the mechanisms thought to cause 
progression from NAFLD to NASH – including in creased expression of inflammatory cytokines 
and impaired mitochondrial function – are also characteristics of HIV infection, such that HIV-
infection may alter the natural history of NAFLD and increase the risk of progression to NASH. The current protocol assesses the effects of GHRH on steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis at a 
tissue level also assesses effects on mRNA expression of genes involved in substrate 
metabolism.    7.3  Study Hypotheses

Page 12 of 51   
  We hypothesize that GHRH analogue will reduce liver fat in patients with NAFLD and 
NASH (Specific Aim 1), and, in conjunction, will reduce inflammation and may improve 
indices of hepatocellular damage and fibrosis (Specific Aim 2).  
 We hypothesize that GHRH analogue will reduce hepatic de novo lipogenesis and 
expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-lipogenic genes (Specific Aim 3a and 3c).  We further hypothesize that reductions in liv er fat will result in improved hepatic and 
peripheral insulin sensitivity (Specific Aim 3b). 
 
8. OBJECTIVES  & STUDY ENDPOINTS 
8.1 Primary Objective:  To determine the whether tesamorelin treatment for 1 year reduces 
liver fat quantity compared to placebo treatment for 1 year.   
 8.2 Secondary Objectives:  To compare the effects of tesamorelin treatment for 1 year 
compared to identical placebo on the following 
a) Hepatic enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT)  
b) histologic features of steatohepatitis (steatosis, inflammation, hepatocellular 
ballooning, and fibrosis)  
c) serum CK-18, a marker of hepatocellular inflammation  
d) hepatic glucose metabolism  
e) hepatic lipid metabolism  
 
8.3 Exploratory Objectives:  N/A 
 
8.4 Primary Endpoint:  Change in hepatic fat fraction, as measured by 
1H-MRS, between 
baseline and [ADDRESS_550646] of tesamorelin to decrease liver fat as compared to placebo over 6 months of 
treatment.  We hypothesize that changes in liver fat may be associated with improvements 
in steatohepatitis and hepatic substrate metabolism, which will be assessed as secondary endpoints. 
 
8.5 Secondary Endpoints: 
a) Change in ALT, AST, and GGT over 12 months 
 These are chosen as clinically relevant markers of hepatocellular inflammation, 
which we hypothesize will decrease with tesamorelin treatment as compared to placebo. 
 
b) Change in histologic scores for steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooing, 
and change in histologic staging of fibrosis after 12 months 
 Examination of histologic features of steatohepatitis is critical to determine the 
effects of tesamorelin on hepatocellular inflammation and fibrosis, beyond its effects 
to reduce liver fat per se.  NAFLD activity score (NAS) will be assessed using the 
sum of subscores for steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning.  Fibrosis stage will also be assessed.  These assessments are standard in studies of NAFLD and have been developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kleiner and others as tools to assess the effect of interventions for NAFLD.   
 
TESLA protocol 
Version  6.2 
06/17/2019 
 
Page 13 of 51   
 c) Change in CK-18 after 12 months 
 
CK-18 is expressed by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_1663], including hepatocytes, and CK-18 cleavage fragments are released during apoptosis.  CK-18 is a well-validated marker of 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and will be assessed as a measure of apoptotic activity 
and NAFLD severity.    
d) Change in hepatic glucose metabolism as measured by [CONTACT_434674] (EGP) during the fasting state and suppressibility of EGP during low-dose 
insulin clamp (assessed at MGH only) 
 
NAFLD is strongly associated with insulin resistance, and we hypothesize that improvements in NAFLD may improve hepatic glucose metabolism, i.e., decrease hepatic insulin resistance.  This will be assessed through two measures, namely measurement of EGP in the fasting state using stable isotopes and subsequent 
assessment of the suppressibility of EGP in response to “low-dose” insulin clamp. 
 
e) Change in hepatic lipid metabolism as measured by [CONTACT_434675], using deuterium incorporation into palmitate (assessed at MGH only) 
 An etiologic contributor to NAFLD is increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis, which is increased in HIV infection and thought to be reduced by [CONTACT_221485].  We will assess whether treatment with tesamorelin decreases hepatic de novo lipogenesis using stable isotopes (deuterated water consumption, followed by [CONTACT_434676]).

 At MGH, subjects will be recruited from local primary care, infectious disease, and 
gastroenterology practices as well as community organizations and the MGH Clinical Research Program’s Research Subject Volunteer database (RSVP). We anticipate that some subjects will be known to have NAFLD or NASH and may al ready be followed by (and referred from) 
gastroenterologists, whereas other patients may not have a known diagnosis and will be either self-referred or referred from their primary care or infectious disease providers due to high likelihood of NAFLD or NASH based on clinical factors such as abdominal adiposity and elevated transaminases.  For self-referred pat ients, phone screening will be used to select 
volunteers for screening who have a high likelihood of qualifying for the study based on either 
history of elevated transaminases or signi ficant abdominal adiposity and/or metabolic 
abnormalities. 
 Participants who are interested in the study will be asked to contact [CONTACT_3019].  Flyers with our contact [CONTACT_434680], and flyers will also be sent to community organizations.  In addition, if a physician obtains 
permission from his/her patient for us to contact [CONTACT_102], then we may contact [CONTACT_102].   
 Advertisement of the study in community organizations will increase participation of women and minorities.    
10.[ADDRESS_550652] any unanswered questions.  Subjects who wish to discontinue participation for any reason will be asked to discuss possible solutions that may allow them to 
continue participation, and subjects will also be reminded that their participation is voluntary and 
they are free to discontinue at any time.  11. INTERVENTIONS 11.1 Biomedical Interventions (Study Drug) 11.1.1 Regimen 
 Double blind phase (first 12 months):  subjects will receive tesamorelin vs. identical 
placebo, formulated as described below, according to their randomization. 
 Open label phase (last 6 months):  subjects  will receive tesamorelin, formulated as 
described below 
 Tesamorelin and identical placebo will be pr ovided by [CONTACT_434681], Inc. (Montreal, 
Canada).  The dose of tesamorelin will be [ADDRESS_550653]’s IGF-1 is ≥3 (see below and Section 14.4.1).  All 
doses will be self-administered by [CONTACT_423], after s/he receives instruction in 
reconstitution and administration and demonstrates competence in self-injection. Dosing is based on prior studies of this compound in HIV-infected patients with fat accumulation in which GHRH
1-44 at 2mg significantly reduced visceral fat, improved lipid parameters, 
while achieving a generally physiologic increa se in IGF-I of 80% vs. placebo over 6 
months [54].  
 Dose adjustment:  If a subject who is receiving tesamorelin in either the double-blind 
phase or open-label phase has an IGF-1 z-score ≥3, a dose reduction to 1mg will be 
performed.  If the subject is in the double-blind phase, this will be accompanied by a dummy dose reduction for a placebo subject in order to maintain blinding, as described in 14.4.1.  If the subject’s next IGF-1 level shows z-score ≥ 3, s/he will be discontinued 
from the study.  If the next IGF-1 z-score is <3, the subject will continue in the study at

participation in the study. 
 11.1.[ADDRESS_550655] Formulation and Preparation 
A three month supply of tesamorelin or identical-appearing placebo will be dispensed at each 
study visit. The dose of study drug is 2mg subcutaneous daily, which requires administration of two reconstituted vial of medication.  Each vial of tesamorelin contains 1.1mg, which are reconstituted to provide 1mg dose.  Each vial of placebo contains 55 mg of mannitol. Subjects will be instructed to refrigerate the vials between 36-46° F, and will be expected to dilute, mix, 
and administer daily injections of the study drug or placebo. [CONTACT_434732] holds an IND for the 
use of GHRH
1-44 in HIV lipodystrophy (IND 77,473, S. Grinspoon) that has been amended to 
include this protocol.  GHRH1-44 (Tesamorelin) has been approved by [CONTACT_434682].  Medication adherence will be assessed by [CONTACT_434683].   
 
Patients will receive detailed instruction regarding proper storage and self-administration of the 
study agent in accordance with the manufacturer’s product information. 
 
11.1.3 Device Studies:  N/A 
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_550656] Supply and Accountability   Tesamorelin and identical placebo will be procured from Theratechnologies, Inc. (Montreal, 
Canada).  Medication will be dispensed by [CONTACT_434684].  A three month supply of medication will be dispensed to patients at the baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 month visits.  Medication and supplies dispensed will be as follows: 
 190 vials of study drug, comprising a 95 day supply 
 100 vials of sterile water, to be used to reconstitute study drug.  A total of 2.2 cc of sterile 
water is used for the reconstitution of the medication in both vials, and 2cc solution is withdrawn and administered. 
 100 3cc syringes with 18 gauge, 1.5 inch needles.   
 100 additional 18 gauge, 1.5 inch needles 
 95 27 gauge, ½ inch needles 
 Box of alcohol swabs 
 Sharps container 
 Cooler with 2 ice packs for transporting medication home 
 Study drug diary 
At each dispensation, the subject’s identity will be confirmed using 2 identifiers that match the prescription labeling, and the randomization number will also be verified.  The number of vials 
provided will be recorded, along with the Lot # for the medication and, if applicable, kit and/or 
box #s as well.    The MGH and NIH research pharmacies will receive vials of tesmorelin and placebo from Theratechnologies.  The pharmacies will be able to identify which vials are active vs. placebo, but this will not be apparent to investigators or subjects by [CONTACT_434685].       
 
Subjects will be asked to return used and unused medication at the 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 month visits.  The number of used and unused vials will be recorded prior to destruction of used and unused drug.

12.2.3 Total Blood Volume  
The total blood drawn for subjects completing the study is equivalent to approximately 730 cc 
over a period of 18 months for those subj ects in the subset receiving euglycemic 
hyperinsulinemic clamp and stable isotopes at MGH, and approximately 540cc over 18 months 
for those at NIH (where clamp/isotope will not be performed).  The maximum amount of blood drawn at any given visit will be approximately 1 70cc, which will be drawn at the baseline and 12 
month visits.  A total of 730cc (less than 2 blood donations) over 18 months does not pose excessive risk to patients, nor does withdrawal of up to 170cc at a single timepoint.    Patients with a hemoglobin < 11 g/dL will be excluded from the study.   The amount of blood drawn for research purposes will be within the limits allowed for adult 
subjects at the NIH Clinical Center (Medical Ad ministrative Series Policy M95-9 Guidelines for 
Limits of Blood Drawn for Research Purposes in the Clinical Center: http://cc-
internal.cc.nih.gov/policies/PDF/M95-9.pdf).  The amount is also within Partners Human Research Committee guidelines (MGH IRB).  
12.3 Study Methods 
12.3.1 
1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy(MRS) & MRI 
After a 12-hour overnight fast subjects will undergo 1H -MRS of the liver.  A breath-hold true fast 
imaging with steady precession sequence will be obtained.  A voxel measuring 20 x 20 x 20 mm 
(8 ml) will be placed within the right lobe of the liver, avoiding vessels or artifact, and with 
position within the liver confirmed by [ADDRESS_550665] will be used.  The total amount of time in the magnet will be approximately 1 hour.  A subset of patients at the NIH (no more than 5) may be 
offered an opportunity for a repeat validation scan to establish test-retest reliability and will be 
compensated an additional $50 for this procedure.   Proton density fat fraction will be calculated from integral lipid and water peak areas as previously described [70, 71].  The imaging procedure will be identical at both the MGH and NIH sites. [CONTACT_434733] will read all the MRS scans centrally at MGH, including data sent from MRS scans obtained at NIH, to ensure 
uniformity in the assessment hepatic fat by [CONTACT_434692].  
 12.3.2 Transient Elastography 
Liver stiffness will be determined using transient elastography.[72].  At least ten measurements 
will be made using the M-probe according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and the median will be expressed in kilopascal (kPa) units.  If measurements from the M-probe are 
unsuccessful at the baseline assessment, the XL probe may be used at the operator’s discretion.  Use of the XL probe at baseline will be noted, and the XL probe will also be used for subsequent assessment of that subject.  12.3.3 Liver Biopsy  
Following MRS/MRI, a percutaneous liver biopsy will be performed under ultrasound guidance using an 18-gauge needle by [CONTACT_434693].  Participants with any 
contraindication to liver biopsy, including platelets < 75,000, elevated PT or PTT, or chronic use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_434647]-platelet agents will not undergo biopsy.  Use of other anti-coagulants will

Individuals on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_434648] ≥[ADDRESS_550667] performing the procedure.  A maximum of 3 passes will be performed during the biopsy.  A biopsy fragment will be fixed in 10% formalin. These will be sent to the NIH for central review by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. David Kleiner using standard histopathologic techniques.  Semi-quantitative scoring will use validated scoring systems, including the modi fied Histologic Activity Index [73] and NASH 
Clinical Research Network scoring system [74].  If sufficient tissue exists, a second fragment will be placed in an RNA stabilization reagent (RNAlater, Qiagen) for gene expression analysis.  Microarray of liver tissue will be used to study the expression of inflammation, fibrosis and 
metabolism related genes in liver tissue.    12.3.4 Genetic Analysis   
PBMC’s will be stored and analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphisms that may affect liver fat content.  This analysis will be performed at the NIH.  12.3.[ADDRESS_550668] will be performed with sampling for insulin and glucose at 0, 
30, 60, 90, and 120 min.  
 12.3.6 Whole Body DEXA will be performed to determine total body and regional percent fat 
and lean body mass.  The technique has a precision error (1 SD) of 3% for fat and 1.5% for lean 
body mass[75]. Trunk, extremity and trunk to extremity ratio will also be assessed [76, 77].  
 
12.3.[ADDRESS_550669] at baseline, 12 months, and 18 months will be analyzed for protein, carbohydrate, fat, micronutrient, dietary supplements and alcohol intake (Nutrition Data Systems).   
12.3.[ADDRESS_550670] to hip ratio, leg circumference, arm circumference, shoulders, back of 
neck, and neck circumference will be performed using a standardized technique [78].  12.3.9 Activity  
Modifiable Activity Questionnaire (MAQ) will be used to assess physical activity [79].   
 12.3.[ADDRESS_550671]’s medical history, including any previous surgical procedures and any previous 
significant medical conditions.  A comprehensive review of systems will also be performed.  A 
detailed medication history will be taken.  Subjects will specifically be asked about any previous use of growth hormone or growth hormone releasing hormone, as well as antiretroviral medication history.  Allergies and all current medications will be recorded.  Interval history , 
performed at all subsequent visits, will consist of questioning subjects about any new medical issues or any noted changes in health, as well as any symptoms of developi[INVESTIGATOR_434649].  The most recent medication list will be reviewed with subjects to assess 
for any changes in dosing, new medicati ons, or medication discontinuation.  Physical 
examination will consist of a review of vital signs obtained by [CONTACT_434694] (visualization), heart (auscultation), lungs (auscultation),

 abdomen (palpation and auscultation), and extremities (visualization and palpation).  Additional 
elements of the physical examination may be perform ed at the investigator’s discretion.     
 12.3.11 Stable Isotopes and Clamp  Subjects who participate at the MGH will  undergo stable 
isotope and euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies, in order to assess the following:  de novo lipogenesis (stable isotopes), hepatic insuli n sensitivity (stable isotopes and low dose 
clamp to measure insulin suppression of gluconeogenesis), and peripheral insulin sensitivity (“full” dose clamp).  Assessment of hepatic gluconeogenesis and de novo lipogenesis will utilize 6,6-2H-glucose and deuterium oxide stable isotopes, respectively.  Two intravenous (IV) 
catheters will be inserted:  (1) one placed in the hand when access is available, otherwise in the 
forearm or antecubital space, to be used for venous sampling; (2) one placed in the antecubital space or proximal forearm and used for administration of stable isotopes, insulin, and 20% dextrose as below.  Starting at 7am, 1g/kg of deuterated water will be consumed PO and a priming dose (3.0 mg/kg) of 6,6-2H-glucose will be administered intravenously, followed by a 
continuous infusion (0.03 mg/kg/min) of 6,6-2H-glucose until 11am.  Baseline fasting samples 
for isotopic analysis will be collected at -20, -10, and 0 minutes.  Samples will be collected at 60, 
100, 110, and 120 minutes for 6,6-2H-glucose enrichment for assessment of fasting gluconeogenesis. At 120 minutes, a “low dose”  euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp will be 
performed with an insulin dose of 20 mU/m
2/min to detect differential suppression of hepatic 
gluconeogenesis.  Blood will be sampled for isotopic enrichment of 6,6-2H-glucose at 180, 220, 
230, and 240 minutes.  At 240 minutes, a “full dose” insulin clamp will commence with an insulin 
infusion of 80mU/m2/min. Blood will be sampled for deuterium incorporation into palmitate at 
340, 350, and [ADDRESS_550672] largely hepatic DNL because DNL plays only a minor role in adipose tissue metabolism [17] and does 
not significantly contribute to circulating FFA.  Peripheral insulin sensitivity will be determined 
during the last 20 minutes of the full dose clamp using the DeFronzo method [80].   Clamp procedure will be as follows.   
 Insulin infusate will be prepared by [CONTACT_434695]. 
 The hand/forearm with the IV that will be used for venous sampling will be placed in a 
warming box for the duration of the clamp procedure, although it may be withdrawn if the subject finds the warmth uncomfortable.   
 At time “120” (approximately 10am), a priming dose of 100mU/m
2/min of insulin will be 
given for 2 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of 20mU/m2/min for the next 118 
minutes, comprising the “low dose” clamp.   
 At 240 minutes (approximately 12pm), the dose of insulin will be increased to a priming 
dose of 400mU/m2/min for 2 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of 80mU/m2/min 
from 240-360 minutes, comprising the “full dose” clamp.   
 From 0-240 minutes, a sample ( ≤ 0.5cc) of venous blood will be drawn every [ADDRESS_550673] two runs is ≥ 4mg/dL.  Samples for serum insulin concentration will be drawn at 
times 120, 200, 220, 240, 320, 340, 360. 
 Starting at 125 minutes (5 minutes after commencing insulin infusion), a variable 20% 
dextrose infusion will be administered to ac hieve a target glucose of 90mg/dL (range 85-
95mg/dL).  The rate will be adjusted by [CONTACT_093], an MD or NP who is trained in clamp procedure.  The initial infusion rate of 20% dextrose will be 0-30cc/hr, with the exact rate determined by [CONTACT_178447]’s fasting glucose, 
available clinical information, and, if avail able, data from the subject’s previous clamp 
procedure for the study.  (For example, a subject who is known clinically to be insulin

 resistant and has a fasting glucose of 110mg/dL would be started at a rate of 0cc/hr, 
whereas a lean, muscular subject who exercises regularly and has a fasting glucose of 70mg/dL would be started at 30cc/hr.) 
 The rate of 20% dextrose infusion will be adjusted up or down for the duration of the 
clamp procedure by [CONTACT_093].  Rate changes of 0-40cc/hr will be made by [CONTACT_434696] [ADDRESS_550674]’s venous glucose and rate of change 
in glucose, to achieve target glucose of 90mg/dL.   
 At 360 minutes, the insulin infusion will be discontinued, and the glucose infusion will 
continue for 30 more minutes.  During this time, subjects will be given a meal.  At 390 
minutes, venous glucose will be checked, and the glucose infusion will be discontinued if venous glucose ≥ 80mg/dL.  If glucose is <80mg/dL, the glucose infusion will be 
continued and will be weaned by [CONTACT_434697], with repeat venous glucose sampling every 10 minutes until the glucose is ≥80mg/dL and the infusion is 
stopped.   
 After the clamp, all subjects are counseled concerning the symptoms of hypoglycemia 
and are asked to report immediately any sy mptoms.  Subjects are observed on the CRC 
for at least 20 minutes following discontinuation of glucose infusion.   
 12.4 Schedule of Procedures/Evaluations:  Timing and Definitions   12.4.1 Screening:  The period that commences at the signing of informed consent and ends 
when subjects are either (1) informed that they are not eligible for participation; (2) informed that they are eligible but decline participation; or (3 ) informed that they are eligible, choose to 
participate, and are scheduled for a baseline assessment and randomized.    12.4.2 Enrollment:  For IRB purposes, participants who sign a consent form are considered to 
be enrolled.  However, the sample size of 60 refers to the number of individuals who screen, are 
eligible, choose to participate, and are randomized to treatment. 
 12.4.3 HIV Counseling and Testing:  Individuals will not be invited to screen for the study unless 
they are known to have HIV infection.  Thus HIV counseling and testing will not take place under this protocol. 
 
12.4.4 Follow-Up:  Please see description of follow-up visits in section 12.1 
 12.4.5 Early Termination Visit:  Subjects who end the study early will be asked come for a study 
termination visit (please see Appendix A).  
12.4.6 Pregnancy Visit:  Every effort will be made, both through absolute eligibility criteria and 
ongoing counseling about contraception and risk for participating women of child-bearing age, to 
prevent pregnancy during the study.  Should pregnancy occur, a participant would be asked to discontinue the medication immediately and to come for a visit in order to discuss the situation with the Site PI.  Such participants would also be asked to remain in contact [CONTACT_118735] [INVESTIGATOR_434650]. 
 
12.4.7 Other Visits:  Aside from the visits described in this section and in 12.1, no other visits 
are anticipated.

procedures, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], such that safety can be monitored between study visits.  All adverse events will be collected and reported as described below.  The Co-PI’s (Hadigan 
and Grinspoon) will periodically review adverse events, and the study will also be monitored by 
[CONTACT_434698], as the protocol is conducted under an IND for tesamorelin (77,473 to S.Grinspoon). 
 
13.[ADDRESS_550677], information regarding adverse events will be elicited by 
[CONTACT_4524]:  
 immediately documented in the subjec t’s medical record/source document, 
 recorded on the Adverse Event Case Report Form (AE CRF) or electronic database, and 
 reported as outlined below (e.g., IND Sponsor, IRB). 
 
13.2.1 Definitions 
Adverse Event (AE) An adverse event is any untoward or unfav orable medical occurrence in a human subject, 
including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’ s participation in the research, whether or not 
considered related to the research.  
Adverse Reaction (AR) 
An adverse event that is caused by [CONTACT_4523] (drug or biologic).  Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) An adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational agent 
caused the adverse event. ‘Reasonable possibility ’ means that there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction 
implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction which implies a high degree of certainty.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A Serious Adverse Event is an AE that results in one or more of the following outcomes: 
 death 
 a life threatening (i.e., an immediate threat to life) event 
 an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] 
 a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions 
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 a medically important event* 
 
* Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life 
TESLA protocol 
Version  6.2 
06/17/[ADDRESS_550678] or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.   Unexpected Adverse Event 
An AE is unexpected if it is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure  or Package Insert (for 
marketed products) or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  It is the 
responsibility of the IND Sponsor to make this determination.  Serious and Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) 
A S[LOCATION_003]R is a Suspected Adverse Reaction that is both Serious and Unexpected.   
 Unanticipated Problem (UP) An Unanticipated Problem is any event, inci dent, experience, or outcome that is 
1. unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to 
a. the research risks that are described in the IRB-approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents; and 
b. the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and 
2. possibly, probably, or definitely related to participation in the research; and 3. places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. (Per the IND Sponsor, 
an AE with a serious outcome will be considered increased risk.) 
 
Unanticipated Problem that is not an Adverse Event (UPnonAE) Unanticipated problem that is not an Adverse Event (UPnonAE): An unanticipated problem that does not fit the definition of an adverse event, but which may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], 
involve risk to the subject, affect others in the re search study, or significantly impact the integrity 
of research data.  Such events would be considered a non-serious UP. For example, we will 
report occurrences of breaches of confidentiality , accidental destruction of study records, or 
unaccounted-for study drug.  Protocol Deviation:  Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB approved study 
procedures in a research protocol. Protocol deviations are designated as serious or non-serious and further characterized as 
1. Those that occur because a member of the research team deviates from the protocol. 2. Those that are identified before they occur, but cannot be prevented. 3. Those that are discovered after they occur 
 Serious Protocol Deviation:  A deviation that meets the definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
or compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others.  Non-compliance: The failure to comply with applicable NIH HRPP policies, IRB requirements, or regulatory requirements for the protection of human subjects. Non-compliance is further 
characterized as 
1. Serious: Non-compliance that 
a. Increases risks, or causes harm, to participants 
b. Decreases potential benefits to participants c. Compromises the integrity of the NIH-HRPP 
d. Invalidates the study data 
2. Continuing: Non-compliance that is recurring 
3. Minor: Non-compliance that, is neither serious nor continuing.

 13.2.2 Investigator Reporting Responsibilities to the IND Sponsor  
 
Adverse Events Line listings, frequency tables, and other summary AE data will be submitted to the IND 
Sponsor when needed for periodic safety assessments, review of IND annual reports, review of 
IND safety reports, and preparation of final study reports.  Serious Adverse Events All SAEs (regardless of relationship and whether or not they are also UPs) must be reported to 
the IND Sponsor within [ADDRESS_550679] be reported to the IND Sponsor and 
the DAIDS Clinical Representative no later than 7 calendar days of site awareness of the event. 
UPs that are not AEs are not reported to the IND Sponsor.  Pregnancy 
Pregnancy itself is not an AE. However, complications of pregnancies are AEs and may be 
SAEs. Pertinent obstetrical information for all pregnancies will be reported to the IND Sponsor via fax or email within 3 business days from site awareness of the pregnancy.    Pregnancy outcome data (e.g., delivery outcome, spontaneous or elective termination of the 
pregnancy) will be reported to the IND Sponsor within 3 business days of the site’s awareness. 
 In the event of a pregnancy, the DSMB and the IRB will be notified. The participant will  
 Discontinue the study agent 
 Withdraw from the study but continue in follow-up for safety 
 Be advised to notify her obstetrician of study agent exposure

13.2.4 Reporting Procedures to the MGH IRB 
Partners Human Research Committee policy dictates the following reporting procedures.  Expedited Reporting to the MGH IRB  The following will be reported within 7 calendar days of investigator awareness: 
 Internal adverse events that are unexpected, and related or possibly related to the 
research and that indicate there are new or increased risks to subjects 
 External adverse events that are serious, unexpected, and related or possibly related to 
the research and that indicate there are new or increased risks to subjects that require some action (e.g., modification of the protocol, consent process, or informing subjects) 
 Deviation from the approved research protocol or plan without IRB approval in order to 
eliminate apparent immediate hazard to subjects or harm to others 
 Deviation from the approved research protocol or plan that placed subjects or others at 
an increased risk of harm regardless of whether there was actual harm to subjects or 
others 
 Breach of confidentiality or violation of HIPAA (e.g., lost or stolen laptop) 
 Medication, procedural or laboratory error (e.g., errors in drug administration or dosing, 
surgical or other procedure, or testing of samples or test results) regardless of whether subjects experienced any harm 
 Interim analysis, safety monitoring report, publication in a peer-reviewed journal, or other 
finding that indicates that there are new or increased risks to subjects or others or that 
subjects are less likely to receive any direct benefits from the research 
 Change in FDA labeling (e.g., black box warning), withdrawal from market, manufacturer 
alert from the sponsor, or recall of an FDA-approved drug, device, or biologic used in the research 
 Complaint by/on behalf of a research subject that indicates that the rights, welfare, or 
 safety of the subject have been adversely affected or that cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_941] 
 investigator 
 Incarceration of a research subject during participation in research that is not approved 
for involvement of prisoners as subjects 
 Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements or determinations of the IRB 
identified by [CONTACT_261187] (e.g., FDA Form 483 or Warning Letter) that indicates that the rights, welfare, or safety of subjects have been adversely affected 
 Suspension or termination of the research, in whole or in part, based on information that 
indicates that the research places subjects at an increased risk of harm than previously known or recognized (e.g., FDA clinical hold) 
 Suspension or disqualification of an investigator by [CONTACT_8415], sponsor, or others 
 Scientific misconduct  
 Any other problem that indicates that the research places subjects or others at an 
increased risk of harm or otherwise adversely affect the rights, welfare or safety of subjects or others.   
Annual Reporting to the MGH IRB  The following items will be reported to the MGH IRB in summary at the time of Continuing 
Review: 
- Serious and non-serious unanticipated problems  
TESLA protocol 
Version  6.2 
06/17/[ADDRESS_550680] (by [CONTACT_79844]) are followed until the final outcome is known or until the end of the study follow-up period.   SAEs that have not resolved by [CONTACT_1008]-up period are followed until final outcome is known. If it is not possible to obtain a final outcome for an SAE (e.g., the subject is lost to  
follow-up), the reason a final outcome could not be obtained will be recorded by [CONTACT_434699] (if the CRF is still open).  
 SAEs that occur after the study follow-up period that are report ed to and are assessed by [CONTACT_70563], probably, or definitely related must be reported to the IND Sponsor, as described above. 
 
14. CLINICAL MANAGEMENT   
 
Clinical Management of Adverse Events If a diagnosis is clinically evident (or subsequently determined), the diagnosis rather than the 
individual signs and symptoms or lab abnormalities will be recorded as the AE. 
 All AEs occurring from the time the informed consent is signed through the study follow-up period will be documented, recorded, and reported.  The Investigator will evaluate all AEs with respect to Seriousness (criteria listed above), 
Severity (intensity or grade), and Causality  (relationship to study agent and relationship to 
research) according to the following guidelines.   Severity The Investigator will grade the severity of each AE according to the “Division of AIDS Table for 
Grading fhe Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events” Version 2.0, November, 2014, 
which can be found at:   
https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical-research -sites/daids-adverse-event-grading-tables    
    Some grade 1 lab parameters on the DAIDS Toxicity Table (Fibrinogen, Potassium (low), Uric Acid (males only, elevated)) fall within the NIH lab reference range for normal values.  These 
normal values will not be reported as grade 1 adverse events. The grade 1 values for these 
tests will be reported as follows: 
 Fibrinogen: 100-176 mg/dL 
 Potassium (low): 3.0-3.3 mmol/L 
 Uric Acid (males): 8.7-10.0 mg/dL  
 
TESLA protocol 
Version  6.2 
06/17/2019 
 
Page 30 of 51   
 Causality    
Causality (likelihood that the event is related to the study agent)  will be assessed considering the factors listed under the following categories:   
Definitely Related    
 reasonable temporal relationship 
 follows a known response pattern 
 clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
 there is no alternative etiology 
 
Probably Related  
 reasonable temporal relationship 
 follows a suspected response pattern (based on similar agents) 
 no evidence of a more likely alternative etiology 
 
Possibly Related  
 reasonable temporal relationship 
 little evidence for a more likely alternative etiology 
 
Unlikely Related  
 does not have a reasonable temporal relationship  
OR 
 good evidence for a more likely alternative etiology 
 
Not Related  
 does not have a temporal relationship          
OR 
 definitely due to an alternative etiology 
 
Note: Other factors (e.g., dechallenge, rechallenge) should also be considered for each 
causality category when appropriate. Causality assessment is based on available information at 
the time of the assessment of the AE. The investigator may revise the causality assessment as additional information becomes available.  
14.1 Other Disease Events  
Occurrence of other disease events will be immediately brought to the attention of the Site PI.  The participant’s clinical care providers will be contact[CONTACT_434700]/her participation in the study and to discuss whether or not the study drug should be discontinued, either temporarily or 
permanently, and whether or not the participant can safely continue in the protocol.

14.3 Criteria for Discontinuation  
TESLA protocol 
Version  6.2 
06/17/2019 
 
Page 31 of 51   
 14.3.1 Criteria for Permanent Intervention Discontinuation for an Individual Participant 
The criteria for permanent discontinuation of further study intervention for an individual 
participant are 
 Fasting glucose >150mg/dL, or >180 mg/dL for individuals with known type 2 diabetes at 
study entry,  at any visit, confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-draw 
 Erythema and/or pruritis extending ≥ 3cm beyond the immediate injection site, indicating 
allergic reaction 
 Pregnancy 
 Active malignancy 
 Evolving medical condition (e.g., progressive liv er disease, acute critical illness) such 
that continued participation in the study may incur risk will also be discontinued.   
 Significant symptoms of GH excess felt to be related to the study drug 
 IGF-1 level that remains ≥ [ADDRESS_550682] deviations above the mean following a dose 
adjustment 
 Development or worsening of retinopathy 
 Clinical conditions, which in the best judgment of the investigator are believed to be 
harmful or potentially life-threatening to the participant, even if not felt to be related to the study drug and/or not addressed in the AE management section of the protocol. 
 Request by [CONTACT_434701] e study product(s)/intervention(s) 
 14.3.2 Criteria for Premature Study Discontinuation for an Individual Participant  
The criteria for premature discontinuation from the study for an individual participant are:  
 Lost to follow up as evidenced by [CONTACT_434702] a safety visit after 
multiple attempts at rescheduling, at the discretion of the site investigator  
 Request by [CONTACT_434703]  
 Request of the primary care provider if s/he thinks the study is no longer in the best 
interest of the participant  
 Participant judged by [CONTACT_434704]  
 
14.[ADDRESS_550683] patient safety and well-being; compliance with study requirements will not compromise such treatment.  Guidelines for the management of known side effects of tesamorelin that do not require immediate discontinuation of study drug are as follows. 
 
14.4.1 Elevated IGF-1:  IGF-[ADDRESS_550684] receiving tesamorelin has an IGF-1 z-score of ≥ 3, the endocrinologist 
will contact [CONTACT_434705] a dose-decrease of study drug to 1mg 
daily.  If the subject is in the double-blind phase of treatment, the independent 
endocrinologist will simultaneously recommend a dose decrease for a placebo subject from the same site whose visit was temporally closest to the visit of the tesamorelin subject requiring dose reduction.  Dose reductions should be enacted within [ADDRESS_550685] IGF-1 z-
score ≥  [ADDRESS_550686] will be discontinued from the study.    
14.4.2 Injection site reaction:  A mild degree of non-pruritic swelling and mild erythema at the 
site of the injection that resolves within a few hours is relatively common with 
TESLA protocol 
Version  6.2 
06/17/2019 
 
Page 32 of 51   
 tesamorelin and does not necessarily represent a hypersensitivity reaction.  Subjects 
who present with this reaction will be asked to monitor for resolution and to let the study investigator know of any spread beyond the injection site or any pruritis, either of which may represent hypersensitivity.  Eryt hema and pruritis extending >3cm beyond the 
injection site will be treated as a likely hypersensitivity reaction.  If this is accompanied by [CONTACT_434706], subjects will be discontinued from the study immediately and will be directed to immediate care.  If the erythem a and pruritis are not accompanied by [CONTACT_434707], subjects will be asked to hold the study drug until resolution of the 
symptoms.  At the study investigator’s discretion, the subject may restart study drug 
once to determine if the reaction recurs.  With recurrence, subjects will be discontinued from the study. 
14.4.3 Joint pain:  Joint pain of varying severity is a possible side effect of tesamorelin.  For 
mild joint pain , subjects will be offered the choice of continuing the study drug or 
discontinuing the medication to see if the joint pain resolves.  If joint pain resolves with 
discontinuation and thus is presumably related to tesamorelin, the subject may elect to 
discontinue or to continue in the study with careful monitoring as long as the joint pain is mild.  Lack of resolution will prompt referral to the subject’s usual care providers for further evaluation.  For moderate to severe joint pain, i.e., pain that interferes with sleep 
or affects physical function, subjects will be asked to discontinue the study drug to 
determine if the joint pain resolves.  If the joint pain resolves and thus is presumably 
related to tesamorelin, subjects will be discontinued.  If joint pain does not resolve, subjects will continue to hold the study drug and will be referred to their usual care providers for evaluation.  If an alternate etiology is found, subjects may elect to resume study drug. 
14.4.4 Peripheral edema:  Peripheral edema will be carefully assessed at baseline, as many 
subjects may have some degree of edema.  If peripheral edema worsens during the study, subjects will be asked to have evaluation with their regular care provider for possible etiologies (cardiac, renal), with the understanding that an increase in edema may also be due to study drug.  If no other etiology is found and if the edema does not interfere with physical function, the subject may continue in the study with careful 
monitoring if s/he wishes.   
14.4.5 Hyperglycemia/glucose intolerance:  Fasting glucose will be checked at every visit.  For 
any fasting glucose of >150mg/dL, or >180 mg/dL for individuals with known type 2 
diabetes at study entry, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_434708] a re-draw.  If fasting glucose persists >150mg/dL, or >180 mg/dL for individuals with known type 2 diabetes 
at study entry, subjects will be discontinued.  Subjects without diabetes at study entry 
who develop fasting glucose >126mg/dL but <150mg/dL during the study, or any subjects who are found to have increases in HbA1c or adverse changes in glucose tolerance, will be reminded that tesamorelin may contribute to increased blood sugar and will receive additional counseling regarding limiting caloric intake.  They will also be asked to discuss their glucose control with their regular care provider.  Such subjects 
may continue in the study if they wish, with continued monitoring of glucose per protocol.   
14.4.6 Malignancy:  There is no evidence linking tesamorelin to the development of or 
worsening of malignancy.  Nonetheless, there is theoretical concern that increasing 
growth hormone levels may promote tumor growth.  Consequently, subjects with active malignancy will not be allowed in the study, and subjects with any new malignancy 
discovered during the study will be discontinued from the study.

TESLA protocol 
Version  6.2 
06/17/[ADDRESS_550687] retention and to gather longer-term safety data.   
 
15.2 Study Endpoints 15.2.1 Primary Endpoint:  change in hepatic fat fraction as measured by 
1H-MRS after 1 year of 
randomized treatment.   
15.2.2 Secondary endpoints will include changes in the following:  overall NAS score; fibrosis 
stage and NAS scores for ballooning degeneration, inflammation, and steatosis;  
transient elastography measurement; AST and ALT; fasting lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]; fasting insulin, 
glucose, HOMA-IR; adiponectin and markers of inflammation and cellular injury including circulating CK-18 and hepatic mRNA expression of IL-6 and TNF α; and, in a subset, 
hepatic DNL and gluconeogenesis.   
15.2.3 Exploratory endpoints:  none 
 
15.3 Study Aims and Hypotheses 
Specific Aim 1:  Tesamorelin will significantly decrease liver fat in HIV-infected patients with NAFLD.  We hypothesize that, after 12 months, compared to placebo a) tesamorelin will significantly decrease hepatic fat fraction as measured by 
1H-MRS 
(primary endpoint). 
b) improvements in hepatic fat fraction will be reflected in reductions in steatosis as 
assessed by [CONTACT_434709]. 
 Specific Aim 2:   Tesamorelin will reduce inflammation and improve histological 
findings.  We hypothesize that a significant proportion of our patients will demonstrate 
histologically confirmed NASH on biopsy and t hat after 12 months, compared to placebo, 
a) tesamorelin will improve hepatocellular ballooning and reduce inflammation on liver biopsy. b) tesamorelin will reduce fibrosis on liv er biopsy, and as measured by [CONTACT_434710] (e.g. FibroScan ®). 
c) expression of pro-inflammatory genes in the liver will be reduced, and adiponectin 
expression will increase. 
d) tesamorelin will significantly decrease AST and ALT.  Specific Aim 3:  Reduction in liver fat with tesamorelin will be associated with beneficial changes in hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. 
a) tesamorelin will decrease hepatic de novo lipogenesis as measured by [CONTACT_434711]. 
b) reduction in liver fat will be associated with improved hepatic insulin sensitivity, as measured by [CONTACT_434712], and 
peripheral insulin sensitivity. c) hepatic expression of lipogenic genes will decrease. 
 
15.4 Sample Size Considerations In our previous study of GHRH in HIV, the c hange in liver fat over 6 months among individuals 
who started with hepatic fat fraction >5% was -2.5 ± 11.9 lipid-to-water percent in placebo vs. -9.1 ± 7.[ADDRESS_550688] deviation of the 1 year change is 11%. Using this data we estimate that an 
initial sample size of 60 will provide 82% power  to detect a clinically relevant treatment 
difference of 9.4% or larger 1 year mean changes in liver fat (lipid to water %) at α = 0.05 if the 
TESLA protocol

Page 34 of 51   
 discontinuation rate is 20% (48 evaluable patients), or 80% power if the discontinuation rate is 
25%. For secondary variables collected at both sites, the sample size will provide 85% power to determine a 0.89 SD difference in 1 year mean changes between treatment groups at α = 0.[ADDRESS_550689] 85% power to detect a change of 7 U/L in AST and 8 U/L in ALT.  Power will be lower for secondary assessment of insulin sensitivity assessed by [CONTACT_434713], performed only at MGH.  15.5 Stratification/Randomization/Blinding Procedures/Unblinding Procedures  
 Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_3725] (NIH or MGH) and vitamin E use ( ≥400 IU 
daily or not) 
 Randomization lists will be prepared by [CONTACT_434714] (Hang Lee, PhD) 
using 1:1 treatment allocation, using a permuted block algorithm with randomly 
varying block sizes  
 [CONTACT_6321] will send the site specific randomization lists to the NIH and MGH research 
pharmacies.   
 Randomization procedure:  
o   Eligible participants who have a baseline visit scheduled will be randomized 
in the 1-2 weeks prior to the baseline visit, so that the research pharmacy can 
prepare their study drug.   
o At the time of randomization, study staff will assign the next randomization 
number in sequence and write this in the randomization form as well as on 
the prescription sent to pharmacy.  (e.g., numbers 101, 102, then 103 will be 
assigned sequentially for subjects at MGH who are not using Vitamin E.)   
o Upon receiving a prescription for a new participant, the pharmacy will record 
the participant’s name [CONTACT_434729]. 
o Randomization numbers will not be re-used, even if a participant is 
randomized and then fails to come for baseline assessment.  The next randomization number in sequence will always be assigned.  
 Blinding will be maintained, as the only parties who will know the randomization 
assignment of subjects will be the research pharmacists and an independent endocrinologist at MGH who reviews IGF-1 levels.  Reports of IGF-1 levels will not be made available to study staff, as this would unblind the study.   
 Should a situation arise in which a subj ect or subject’s medical provider needed to 
know their treatment assignment for medical reasons, the Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_434651].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_434652], as well as the DSMB, will be made aware of the unblinding.   
 
15.6 Maintenance of Trial Treatment Randomization Codes  
As above, randomization codes will be held by [CONTACT_25733]’s research pharmacy, and pharmacy staff will record participant assignments.  These lists will be distributed to the PIs and other 
study staff only after every participant has completed the double-blind phase of the study, and 
all data have been entered, verified, and locked.  15.7 Participant Enrollment and Follow-up Please see Section 10 for details regarding recruitment and enrollment of participants, and please see section 12 for details regarding study visits, including all follow-up visits.

 15.8.1 Planned Interim Analyses and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_130]:  N/A  
 
15.8.[ADDRESS_550690]:   
 
Because this study will generate randomized, blinded data, NIAID intramural policy mandates 
that it be reviewed by [CONTACT_434715].  The DSMB has been constituted to review the data and analysis plans of all intramural NIAID clinical studies that require DSMB oversight and consists of experts in infectious diseases, biostatistics, and clinical trials.  The DSMB is responsible for reviewing the IRB approved protocol, informed consent documents, the data and 
safety monitoring plan, and the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_434653], unless 
otherwise waived by [CONTACT_434716].     During the course of the study, the DSMB will re view cumulative study data twice per year to 
evaluate safety, efficacy, study conduct, and scientific validity and integrity of the trial.  As part of this responsibility, DSMB members must be satisfied that the timeliness, completeness, and 
accuracy of the data submitted to them for review are sufficient for evaluation of the safety and 
welfare of study subjects.  The DSMB will al so assess the performance of overall study 
operations and any other relevant issues, as necessary.  The DSMB may also convene outside 
of the biannual meeting if other safety issues arise that the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_434654].   
 
Study Pause Criteria: There will be no predetermined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_434655], however if 3 or more similar grade 4 events that are possible, probably or definitely related to the study drug, or a single SAE that is possibly, probably or  definitely related to study drug are reported, the DSMB will be asked to convene to determine if early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_434656].  
 Items reviewed by [CONTACT_143437]:  
 Interim/cumulative data for evidence of study-related adverse events; 
 Data quality, completeness, and timeliness; 
 Demographic information on study subjects; 
 Site monitoring reports related to adherence to the protocol and applicable regulations; 
 Factors that might affect the study outcome or compromise the confidentiality of the trial 
data (such as protocol violations, unblinding, etc.); and, 
 Factors external to the study such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may 
impact subject safety or the ethics of the study. 
   
Prior to opening the study to enrollment, the st atistician will provide the DSMB Executive 
Secretary with blinding codes in case the DSMB requires this information to make its 
recommendations.  If the DSMB decides to unblind the safety data, the DSMB Executive Secretary will inform the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_434657] e-mail as soon as possible. 
 
The trial will be conducted in compliance with Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
and any applicable regulatory requirements.    The Investigator is responsible for assuring that the data collected is complete, accurate, and 
recorded in a timely manner.  Source documentation (the point of initial recording of information) 
should support the data collected and must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_1024]/or

laboratory reports, radiologist's reports, subject's diaries, biopsy reports, progress notes, 
pharmacy records, and any other similar reports or records of procedures performed during the 
subject's participation in the study.  15.8.3 Progress and Safety Monitoring:  Reports on subject accrual and toxicity will be provided 
to the Division of AIDS Clinical Representative every month (or more frequently if 
necessary). In addition, periodic reports of data pooled over arm will be provided to the 
team that details accrual, participant st atus, delinquency of forms and specimens, and 
toxicity.

longitudinal mixed effects model approach utilizing all available observation will provide unbiased effect size estimates. However, we will perform sensitivity analyses if the dropout rate 
is higher than expected or differs between groups. We will initially consider applying the last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) as a conservative approach. We will also consider multiple imputations (MI) based analysis.  
For the 6-month open-label extension, hepatic fat on MRS and relevant secondary 
endpoints including HOMA-IR and OGTT, fibrosis as assessed by [CONTACT_331436], and 
AST and ALT will be determined.  Although the primary purpose of the 6-month open label 
extension is to increase recruitment and retention, analysis of data from the group receiving tesamorelin for 18 months will provide information regarding whether reductions in liver fat translate into sustained longer-term improvements in transaminases, glucose homeostasis and

17. CLINICAL SITE MONITORING  As per ICH-GCP 5.18 and  FDA 21 CFR 312.50, clinical protocols are required to be adequately 
monitored by [CONTACT_4530]. This study m onitoring will be conducted according to the 
“NIAID Intramural Clinical Monitoring Guidelines.” Monitors under contract to the NIAID/OCRPRO and NIAID/DAIDS will visit the NIAID and MGH clinical research sites to monitor aspects of the study in accordance with the appropriate regulations and the approved protocol. The objectives of a monitoring visit will be: 1) to verify the existence of signed informed consent documents and documentation of the in formed consent process for each monitored 
subject; 2) to verify the prompt and accurate recording of all monitored data points, and prompt reporting of all SAEs; 3) to compare CRIMSON data abstracts (NIH) or written CRF’s (MGH) with individual subjects’ records and source documents (subjects’ charts, laboratory analyses and test results, physicians’ progress notes, nur ses’ notes, and any other relevant original 
subject information); and 4) to help ensure investigators’ are in compliance with the protocol. The monitors also will inspect the clinical site regulatory files to ensure that regulatory 
requirements (Office for Human Research Protections-OHRP, FDA)  and applicable guidelines 
(ICH-GCP) are being followed. During the monitoring visits, the investigator (and/or designee) 
and other study personnel will be available to discuss the study progress and monitoring visit.  The investigator (and/or designee) will make study documents (e.g., consent forms, CRIMSON 
data abstracts or CRFs) and pertinent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_434658], the FDA,  the site monitors, and the NIAID staff, for confirmation of the study 
data.   A specific protocol monitoring plan will be discussed with the Principal Investigator(s) and study 
staff prior to enrollment. The plan will outline the frequency of monitoring visits based on such 
factors as study enrollment, data collection status, and regulatory obligations. 
 
18. HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTIONS 18.[ADDRESS_550695]/Ethics Committee The protocol has been approved by [CONTACT_66926] (MGH IRB) and 
the NIH NIAID IRB, and research will be conducted with oversight from these IRBs.  Each site PI [INVESTIGATOR_434659], AEs, protocol deviations, and other necessary reporting per the requirements of each site’s IRB.

06/17/[ADDRESS_550697]'s involvement in the research. Discussions about the 
research will provide essential information about the study and include: purpose, duration, 
experimental procedures, alternativ es, risks and benefits. Subjects will be given the opportunity 
to ask questions and have them answered.  
 
Written informed consent will be obtained by a physi cian investigator.  A copy of the informed 
consent document will be given to the subjects for their records. The researcher will document the signing of the consent form in the subject’s medical record. The rights and welfare of the subjects will be protected by [CONTACT_434717].

18.3.[ADDRESS_550698]’s chart.  In addition, the consent form will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_434718], and the original signed/dated consent form will be kept in the subject’s study record.  A copy of the informed consent docum ent will be given to the subject, and a copy may 
also be stored in the subject’s medical record, according to site-specific guidelines.  18.3.4 Waiver of Informed Consent:  N/A 
 
18.3.5 Waiver of Documentation of Informed Consent:  N/A 
 
18.3.6 Stored Samples and Associated Data Considerations  
 Subjects at both sites will be informed that de-identified tissue samples from liver biopsy 
will be sent to the NIH, where they will be analyzed and potentially banked.   
 At MGH, subjects will be asked permission for researchers to also utilize their blood  
samples for future related research.  Consent or non-consent is noted by a check-box and initials section on the consent form.  Subjects who agree to have their blood samples used for related studies will have their samples used as described below, and will be informed that they can withdraw this  consent in writing at any time for any 
remaining identifiable samples.  Subjects at MGH who do not agree will have any 
remaining blood samples discarded after their study participation and protocol-specified 
analyses of banked samples are complete. 
 At NIH, subjects must agree to use of samples for related research as an inclusion 
criterion for study participation. 
 Use of samples for related research is described as below: 
 Intended Use: Samples and data collected under this protocol may be used to study 
the effects of tesamorelin on liver fat and liver histology and related health conditions in individuals with HIV. Genetic testing will be performed. Any other research or experimental treatments will be done under this or other protocols for which separate 
signed informed consent documents will be obtained. 
 Storage: Access to stored samples will be limited using either a locked freezer or (at NIH) a secure repository facility in Frederick. Samples and data will be stored using codes assigned by [CONTACT_473]. Data will be kept in password-protected 
computers. Only investigators will have access to the samples and data.  
TESLA protocol 
Version  6.2

Page 40 of 51   
  Tracking: Samples and data acquired as part of this protocol will be tracked at NIH 
using the CRIMSON database system.  Samples acquired and stored at MGH will be tracked by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Grinspoon. 
 Disposition at the Completion of the Protocol:  
 In the future, other investigators (both at NIH and outside) may wish to study these samples and/or data. In that case, IRB approval must be sought prior to any sharing of samples and/or data. Any clinical information shared about the sample would similarly require prior IRB approval.  
 At the completion of the protocol (termination), samples and data will either 
be destroyed, or after IRB approval, transferred to another existing protocol.  
 Reporting the Loss or Destruction of Samples/Specimens/Data to the IRB: 
 Any loss or unanticipated destruction of samples or data (for example, due to 
freezer malfunction) that meets the definition of Protocol Deviation and/or compromises the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study, will be reported to the IRB.  
 Additionally, subjects may decide at any point not to have their samples 
stored.  In this case, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_434660]. Subjects at NIH will not be able to participate if they refuse to have samples stored but this decision will not affect the subject’s participation in other protocols at NIH. 
 18.4 Risks 18.4.1 Radiation    
The total amount of radiation exposure from 3 DEXA scans is 0.[ZIP_CODE] – 0.[ZIP_CODE] rem (0.9 to 1.5 microSeiverts). The radiation exposure in this study  is below the limit of [ADDRESS_550699] evidence 
that radiation exposure at this level is harmful, but, as with all radiation exposure, there may be 
a very slight increase in the risk of cancer.  The average person in the [LOCATION_002] receives a radiation exposure of 0.3 rem per year from 
natural sources, such as the sun, outer space, and the earth's air and soil. A copy of the 
pamphlet, “An Introduction to Radiation for NIH Res earch Subjects”, will be provided to subjects 
by [CONTACT_32236]. 
 
18.4.2 Venipuncture/IV Catheter Placement 
There will be minimal risk and discomfort associated with blood drawing and IV placement. The 
risks of these procedures are minor bruising or bleeding at the site of the blood draw or IV catheter. 
 
18.4.[ADDRESS_550700] interventional 
radiology procedure.  The risks associated with liver biopsy include pain, transient hypotension (vasovagal response), bleeding, and transient bacteremia.  Participants with known contraindication to liver biopsy, including platelets < 75,000, elevated PT or PTT, or chronic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_434661].  Individuals on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_434662] ≥[ADDRESS_550701]-procedure monitoring and

Version  6.2 
06/17/[ADDRESS_550702]-procedure pain has resolved and that no new symptoms are present.  Subjects with persistent 
pain or other concerning symptoms will be asked to return for evaluation. 
 18.4.4 Study Drug 
Administration of all medications will be overs een by [CONTACT_434719]. A 
physician will be available on-call 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, to all study participants for any questions or concerns. Participants will self-administer the study drug at home, with the exception of observed administration at the clinical research center during baseline and 12 month visits.  Please see the Intervention section above for more information regarding study drug risks and benefits.  
 GHRH
1-44 analogue (tesamorelin, Theratechnologies, Inc.) for treatment purposes has been 
used in a number of studies, including the protocol in a prior completed R-01 grant described in preliminary data, with minimal side effects.  In two large, Phase III studies conducted in individuals with HIV-infection and abdominal adiposity, adverse events that were more common 
in the treatment vs. placebo group were injection site erythema (8.5% in treated vs. 2.7% in 
placebo), injection site pruritis (7.6% of treated vs. 0.8% placebo), and peripheral edema (6.1% in treated vs. 2.3% in placebo).  With respect to serious adverse events (SAEs), prevalence was not statistically different (3.7% in treated vs. 4.2% in placebo).  Clinically significant changes 
were not observed for liver function (alanine transaminase), kidney function (creatinine), or 
blood pressure (diastolic and systolic). The majority of the reported side effects were mild in 
severity.  Tesamorelin is FDA approved for HIV-lipodystrophy and has now been prescribed to 
approximately [ADDRESS_550703] of tesamorelin on glucose tolerance after 1 year of administration.  Although there is a theoretical risk of neoplasm with an agent that increases GH and IGF-I, there is no evidence of increased malignancy with GHRH
1-44.  This risk is further minimized based on the data from 
previous studies showing achievement of physiol ogic, rather than pharmacologic, increases in 
IGF-1 SD scores. Nonetheless, subjects with active malignancy will be excluded from the study.  
For potential participants with previous malignancy that has been treated and cured, their health care providers will be contact[CONTACT_434720]. The study investigators, potential participant, and participants’ providers will work together to weigh the potential benefits of the study drug against the risk of recurrence; only if an agreement is 
reached that participation poses no increased risk of recurrence will subjects with previous 
history of cured malignancy be enrolled.  IGF-1 Z-score ≥[ADDRESS_550704] receiving tesamorelin has an IGF-1 Z-score ≥3 (i.e., an IGF-1 level of 3 SD or more 
above the mean for age and gender), then the endocrinologist will contact [CONTACT_434721] a dose decrease to 1mg.  If the subject is in the double-blind portion of the study (first 12 months), a dummy dose decrease will also be requested for a placebo patient seen at the 
same site during the same time-frame in order to maintain blinding.  If the IGF-1 Z-score for the 
TESLA protocol 
Version  6.2 
06/17/[ADDRESS_550705] remains ≥[ADDRESS_550706] will continue to be followed for safety.   
 18.4.5 Euglycemic Hyperinsulinem ic Clamp/Insulin (MGH Only) 
Administration of insulin infusion can cause hypoglycemia. Blood sugar will be monitored every 5 minutes during the insulin clamp, and 20% dextrose is infused per protocol to achieve target blood glucose of 90mg/dL. In the event of hypoglycemia, 50% dextrose is available at the 
bedside, and a physician or nurse practitioner is present throughout the insulin clamp 
procedure.   18.4.[ADDRESS_550707] and his/her primary care physician will be notified.  18.[ADDRESS_550708] participant privacy and confidentiality, it is possible that participants' involvement in the study could become known to others, and that participants may experience stigmatization or discrimination as a result of being perceived as being HIV-infected or at risk for HIV infection. For example, participants could be treated unfairly, or could have problems being 
accepted by [CONTACT_18115]/or communities. Pr oblems may also occur in circumstances in 
which study participation is not disclosed, such as impact on employment related to time taken 
for study visits. In the event that a participant reports a social impact event, every effort will be 
made by [CONTACT_434722] e, and/or referrals to appropriate resources.  
 
Social impact events are documented and reviewed on a scheduled basis by [CONTACT_434723].  Social impact events that are judged by [CONTACT_434724], unexpected, or more severe or frequent than anticipated, will be reported to the responsible site’s IRB promptly, or 
otherwise in accordance with the IRB’s requirements. 
 18.[ADDRESS_550709] 6 months during the final open-label extension.  Tesamorelin is established to reduce visceral fat in a majority of patients and to lower triglyceride, on average.  In addition, based on our preliminary data, subjects may experience reductions in liver fat, and potentia lly related improvements in metabolism and 
reductions in inflammation.  Further, the information obtained from this study will inform the use of GHRH analogue and possibly other strategies to treat NAFLD in HIV.  Therefore, the benefits are felt to outweigh the risks described above.   18.7 Compensation

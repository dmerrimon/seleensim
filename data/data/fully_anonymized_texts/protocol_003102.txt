Original Protocol  16 October 2020  
Amendment 5: 
This amendment is considered substantial based on the criteria defined in Article  10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union 
because of significant  changes in the conduct or management  of the study . 
Overall rationale for the current Amendment:   
The purpose of this amendment is to remove Dose [ADDRESS_641811] RSV -confirmed LRTD was 
67.18% [97.5% CI: 48.19, 80.04]. The VE against severe LRTD was 78. 83% (95% CI: 
52.59, 91.96).  
The study also evaluated efficacy following an annual revaccination schedule. Over 
2 seasons, the VE in participants who received a second dose of the vaccine before 
Season 2 was similar to the VE in participants who had receive d a single dose of vaccine 
prior to Season 1 with VE of 67.12% (97.5% CI: 48.09, 80.00) against RSV -confirmed 
LRTD. These data suggest that a revaccination administered approximately [ADDRESS_641812] -Dose 2 were consistent with previous  results from the 
Phase 3 program.  Based on available reactogenicity and safety data  up to the end of 
Season 2 in the NH (DLP 31 March 2023) , with a median follow -up time from Dose 1 up 
to DLP of approximately 18.2 months, and from Dose 2 up to DLP of approximately 
6.7 months, the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine showed a clinically acceptable 
safety profile in adults ≥  [ADDRESS_641813] of the solicited events 
being mild to moderate and of short duration . No safety concerns were identified with 
currentl y available data.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  8 Based o n these observation s, the study design was modified to remove the next planned 
dose of the study intervention (Dose 3 pre -Season 3 ) in the NH. The clinical development 
program will continue to evaluate long -term follow -up and the optimal timing for 
revaccination .  
To evaluate further the correlation between humoral immune response and protection, an 
additional blood sample has been added at Visit 5NH for all participants  who are not in 
the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset . 
This amendment does not impact participants enrolled in the SH as they have completed 
the [ADDRESS_641814] been correcte d. 
Other updates are described in the table below :

Section # and  title Description of change  Brief rationale  
Title page; sponsor approval page; 
investigator agreement page  
3. Objectives and endpoints  
7.1 Discontinuation of study 
intervention  
[IP_ADDRESS] Quality of life  ‘Annual revaccination doses’ has been changed to ‘Ann ual revaccination’ and 
‘Annual revaccinations’ has been changed to ‘Annual revaccination’.  As Dose [ADDRESS_641816]-Dose 1 did not confer additional benefit in 
prevention of RSV -confirmed LRTD, the study 
design was modified to rem ove the next planned 
dose of the study vaccine (Dose 3 pre -Season 3). 
These sections were thus updated to reflect this 
change.  
1.1 Synopsis  
2.1 Study rationale  
2.2 Background  
4.2.2 Rationale for the use of Placebo  Clinical development status of [COMPANY_004]’s RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine has 
been updated.  
Marketing authorization approval of the study vaccine has been added.  As [COMPANY_004]’s RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine is 
now approved for use, the clinical development 
status of the study vaccine was modi fied from 
‘developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]’ to ‘developed’ and the market 
authorization approval details have been added.  
1.3 Schedule of activities

Table  5) For Table [ADDRESS_641817] their Visit 5NH after the approval of the current Protocol 
Amendment  5 (Table 2).   
Intervals between study visits/contact [CONTACT_499023].  
Corrections have been made in the table footnotes to align with the changes made 
in the tables.  
Section has been  updated to reflect that a b lood sample will be taken at Visit 5NH 
from all participants in the NH who have their Visit 5NH after the approval of the 
current Protocol Amendment  5. 
Option for use of paper questionnaire for atrial fibrillation has been remov ed. 
Corrections in the footnotes were made to algin with the changes made in the table.  To align with the changes made to the study 
design with respect to  removal of Dose 3 (pre -
Season 3) and study procedures related to Dose 3 
administration.  
Blood samples collection  from all participants  in the 
NH at Visit 5 NH (pre -Season 3) was added  to allow 
for further assessment of correlation between 
humoral immune response and protection.  
As only electronic questionnaires will be used for 
follow -up of at rial fibrillation, the option for paper 
questionnaire was removed.

would be assessed for only 1 annual rev accination before Season 2.  
The term ‘pre -Dose 3’ has been removed from the secondary and tertiary 
immunogenicity endpoints.  To align with the changes made to the study 
design with respect to  removal of Dose 3 (pre -
Season 3) and study procedures related t o Dose 3 
administration.

modified in indicate that RSVPreF3 IgG -binding antibody concentration will also be 
assessed at pre -Season 3 for all particip ants in the NH.  To allow for further assessment of correlation 
between humoral immune response and 
protection.

12 July 2023  22 1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1. Synopsis  (Amended, 12 July 2023 ) 
Rationale:  
GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA ([COMPANY_004])  has developed  a new  RSV PreFusion protein 
F3 Older Adult ( RSVPreF3 OA ) vaccine against RSV -associated (subtypes A and B) 
disease in adults ≥ 60 years of age ( YOA ).  
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of the RSVPreF3  OA 
investigational vaccine in the prevention of reverse -transcriptase polymerase chain 
reaction (RT -PCR) -confirmed lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4371] (LRTD) caused by [CONTACT_4510] A 
and/or B in adults ≥ [ADDRESS_641843] RT -PCR -
confirm ed LRTD caused by [CONTACT_499024] (hMPV) will also be evaluated . In 
addition, the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine will be assessed  after each dose . 
Surveillance for acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375]  (ARI) will be carried out during the entire study 
via spontaneous reporting by [CONTACT_87755] (starting on the first vaccination day 
[Visit 1 ]) and via scheduled site staff contacts  (as of Visit 2 onwards) . 
Based on the first results obtained in the Phase 1/2 dose formulation selection study for 
the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine (RSV  OA=ADJ -002), RSVPreF3  recombinant 
antigen 120 µg adjuvanted with AS01 E as a single dose was selected for further 
evaluati on in the Phase 3 program.  
Objectives and endpoints:  
Refer to Table 8 in Section 3 for an overview of the study objectives and endpoints . 
1.2. Schema  
Refer to Figure  1 for an overview of the study design.  
1.3. Schedule of activities  (Amended, 12 July 2023 ) 
For participants who will have the Visit 5NH ( pre-Season 3 visit) taking place 
BEFORE the approval  of this Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_641844] the Visit 5NH ( pre-Season 3 visit) taking place AFTER 
the approval  of this Protocol Amendment 5 , the study procedures should be performed 
according to the current Protocol Amendment 5 : Dose [ADDRESS_641845] 5 should be cancelled  for these participants . Blood sample should be collected

2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Study r ationale  (Amended , 12 July 2023 ) 
[COMPANY_004]  has developed a new RSVPreF3 OA  vaccine against RSV -associated (subtypes A 
and B) disease in adults ≥ 60 YOA . 
The purpose of the current study is to demonstrate the efficacy of the RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine in the prevention of RT -PCR -confirmed LRTD caused by [CONTACT_4510] A 
and/or B in adults ≥ [ADDRESS_641926] RT -PCR -confirmed 
LRTD caused by [CONTACT_499024] (hMPV) will also be evaluated . In addition, 
the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine will be assessed  after each dose . 
The rationale for the study design is presented in Section 4.2. 
2.2. Background  (Amended , 12 July 2023)  
RSV is a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus of which [ADDRESS_641927], 
referred to as RSV A and RSV B [ Borchers , 2013]. RSV is a highly contagious human 
pathogen that cause s respi[INVESTIGATOR_498903]. In temperate 
climates throughout the world, RSV predictably causes fall -winter  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7509] . In (sub) 
tropi[INVESTIGATOR_190566], viral activity is more endemic , and outbreaks are less temporally 
focused.

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  39 As the global population ages, the morbidity and mortality of respi[INVESTIGATOR_498904] [ Lee, 2013; Binder , 2017] . 
Based on epi[INVESTIGATOR_448814] 2008 -2010 in 14 countries 
worldwide (including North America, Europe and East Asia), the average percentage of 
documented RSV infection s in older adults ( ≥ 65 years) with influenza -like illness is 
7.4%, with values between 0% and  17.1% across countries [ Falsey , 2014].  In 2015, an 
estimated 1.5  million epi[INVESTIGATOR_498905] -related acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_498906]; approximately 14.5% of these epi[INVESTIGATOR_448817] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] [ Nam , 2019]. Further information on RSV incidence and disease 
burden  can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
Previous infection with RSV does not prevent subsequent infections. Therefore, re -
infection with RSV occurs throughout an individual’s lifetime and is common in all age 
groups [ Simoes , 1999; Krilov , 2011]. Generally, these re -infections go undiagnosed 
becau se they usually manifest as common acute upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014] . 
However, in more vulnerable individuals (e.g. , immunocompromised  person s or older 
adults), re -infections can also lead to severe disease [ Graham , 2011].  
hMPV is a n RNA pneumovirus related to RSV, sharing similar genomic/structural 
organizations and associated clinical manifestations [ ICTV , 2019]. Similar to RSV, 
hMPV is a highly contagious human pathogen causing upper and lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_498907]. In older adults , clinical manifestations can be 
asym ptomatic or ranging from mild upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_498908] [ Walsh , 2008]. Older adults aged 65 years or above are at increased ris k of 
severe hMPV disease and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] [ Falsey , 2003; Walsh , 2008; Widmer , 2012].  
Rates of intensive care unit admissions, mechanical ventilation, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498909], RSV and influenza infected adults [Haas , 
2013; Walsh , 2008; Widmer , 2012 ]. 
At the time of initiation of this study, no vaccine nor other prophylac tic treatment was 
available against RSV or hMPV in older adults. Since then, [COMPANY_004]’s RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine was first approved for use in an adults ≥ [ADDRESS_641928] time to adults 
60–80 YOA according to a 0, 2 -month intramuscular vaccination schedule in another 
clinical study (RSV OA=ADJ -002). The vaccine formulation and schedule used in the 
present study , i.e., RSVPreF3 recombinant antigen,  120 µg adjuvanted with AS01 E as a 
single dose,  was selected based on safety and immunogenicity data from the 
RSV  OA=ADJ -002 study.  In addition, the Phase 1 study RSV OA=ADJ -003 has been  
conducted in Japan to evaluate the safety , reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the 
RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine (RSVPreF3 recombinant antigen, 120 µg 
adjuvanted with AS01 B) in 40 healthy ethnic Japanese adults 60 -80 YOA . No safety 
concerns were identified so far.

the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine .

12 July 2023  40 2.3. Benefit/Risk a ssessment  
In this study, up to  [ADDRESS_641929] one dose of the 
RSVPreF3  OA investigational vacc ine, whereas up to 12  500 participants will receive a 
placebo  (refer to Section 9.2 for more details on the number of participants to be 
enrolled) . 
2.3.1.  Risk assessment  
Information about the reasonably expected adverse events (AEs) and the known and 
expected benefits and potential  risks (potential syncope, hypersensitivity) of the 
RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine or the adjuvant system (potential immune -
mediated diseases [pI[INVESTIGATOR_159170]]) can be found in the IB and the Development Safety Update 
Report (DSUR).  
Intramuscular vaccination co mmonly precipi[INVESTIGATOR_14263] a transient and self -limiting local 
inflammatory reaction. This may typi[INVESTIGATOR_227187], erythema and 
swelling.  
In addition to potential risks related to the vaccine, there may be risks related to the blood 
sampling  planned in the study:  
• Pain and bruising may occur at the site where blood is drawn; as a mitigation 
strategy, a topi[INVESTIGATOR_227188].  
• Syncope (fainting) can occur following or even before any blood draw as  a 
psychogenic response to the needle insertion.  
For details of study procedures, dose and study design justification, refer to Section s 1.3 
and 4, respectively . 
2.3.2.  Benefit assessment  (Amended, 12 July 2023)  
At the start of this study, the efficacy of the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine was 
not demonstrated yet. Hence it was unknown if t he participants receiving the RSVPreF3 
OA investigational vaccine would  benefit from this vaccination . Since then,  the efficacy 
of RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine was demonstrated and the study primary 
confirmatory objective was met. One dose of RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine has 
shown a favorable benefit/risk profile . The vaccine was approved for use in an a dults 
≥ 60 YOA in the US on 3 May 2023, followed by [CONTACT_499031] 6 June 2023.   
The VE Analysis 3 data showed that revaccination administered approximately 12 
months after Dose 1 did not confer additional benefit in prevention of RSV -confirmed 
LRTD  for the overall population of adults ≥ 60 YOA, while the second dose of vaccine 
has a clinically acceptable safety profile. The clinical development program will 
continue to evaluate longer term follow -up and the optimal timing for potential 
revaccination .

12 July 2023  41 Another benefit for all study participants may include gaining of information about their 
general health status through the medical evaluations/assessments associated with this 
study (i.e., physical examination).  
2.3.3.  Overall Benefit /Risk conclusion  
The RSVPr eF3 OA investigational vaccine is in clinical development. Considering  the 
measures  taken  to minimize the risk to participants in this study, the potential risks are 
justified by [CONTACT_499032].

vaccine or placebo) on Day 1 followed by  [CONTACT_499042] 
(RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine or placebo)  as follows : 
− Participants from  the NH who will have their Visit 5NH before the approval of 
the current Protocol Amendment 5, will receive 2 additional doses, 1 before 
Season 2 and 1 before Season 3.  
− Participants from  the NH who will have their Visit 5NH after the approval of 
the current Protocol Amendm ent 5, will not receive any study intervention at 
pre-Season 3 visit (Visit 5NH ). These participants had received 1 additional 
dose before Season  2.  
− Participants from the SH will receive 1 additional dose before Season 2.  
• Safety monitoring:  An IDMC , in addition to the existing [COMPANY_004]’s Safety Review 
Team (SRT) , will oversee the safety of the study participants and study conduct  
(refer to Section 8.2.3 ). 
• ARI s urveillance : Surveillance for ARI detection  will be carried out during the 
entire study, via spontaneous reporting by [CONTACT_87755] (starting on the  first 
vaccination  day* [Visit 1]) and via scheduled site staff contact s (starting from Visit 2 
onwards)  with different frequencies of contact [CONTACT_499043] -
season periods  (refer to Section 8.1.1 ). Swab samples will be taken in all participant s 
meeting pre -specified criteria for ARI case definition  (refer to Section  4.2.1 ). 
Diagnosis and treatment of each ARI should be performed according to the local 
standard of care.  
* For detailed information on activities involved in ARI surveillance, refer to Table 
4. 
4.1.1.  Overview of the recruitment plan  
The aim is to enroll between at least  16 000 and up to 23  000 participants in the NH and 
between 1  500 to 2  000 participants in the SH with a rando mization  ratio of 1:1:1:3 for 
Part 1 of the study ( RSVPreF3 Lot 1/2/3 v ersus Placebo) and a rando mization  ratio of 1:1 
for Part 2 ( RSVPreF3 Lot 4 v ersus Placebo) before Season 1 . Refer to Section 9.2.1  for 
details on the sample size calculation.  
The recruitment plan may be adapted based on the actual number of participants enrolled 
in each hemisphere or within each sex. In case a hemisphere or country would fall behind 
in participant recruitment (in a specific age group or overall), a redistribution of the 
enrol lment target per hemisphere/country may be made to allow the other participating 
country(ies) to enroll additional participants in an effort to ensure full and timely 
enrol lment of the overall ta rgeted number of participants specified in this protocol.  
The procedures for participants identification/recruitment ha ve to be approved by [CONTACT_448846] (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB)  together with the 
material intended for participants identification/recruitment and participants use. Refer to 
the Study Procedures Manual (SPM) for additional details.

212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  52 4.1.2.  Enrol lment  rules  
Overall, participants will be enrolled in 3 age categories reflecting  an approximate age 
distribution  in the general population with a balance between males and females . It is 
therefore intended to enroll:  
• Approximately  40% of participants 60-69 YOA, approximately 30% of participants 
70-79 YOA and approximately 10% of participants  ≥ 80 YOA. The remaining 20% 
can be distributed freely a cross the 3 age categories . 
• Approximately 40% of participants from each sex; the remaining 20% can be 
distributed freely  between the 2 sexes . 
Participants from both community dwelling (CD) and long -term care facilities (LTCFs ) 
may be enrolled.  
Allocation of participants to the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset:  
Participants contributing to the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset will be 
recruited from a selected number of countries and selected number of sites  in Part 1. In 
the selected sites, the investigator will allocate the first participants in each age categor y 
to the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset until the allocated target is reached.  
4.2. Scientific rationale for study design  (Amended, 12 July 
2023)  
The study is designed as a Phase 3, observer -blind, placebo -controlled study enrolling 
adults  ≥ [ADDRESS_641958] 2 consecutive  RSV seasons in the SH. The study population will be represent ative 
of the global population beyond 60 YOA . Older adults living in the community (CD 
participants ) and LTCFs residents (LTCF participant s) with medically stable conditions  
may be enrolled . Please refer to Section 10.5.2  (Glossary of terms ) for the definition of 
CD participants and LTCF.  
There is uncertainty about the persistence of the immune response to the RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine administered as a single dose and the level of immune response 
that may be required for protection. In addition, older adults may require repeated dosing 
to maintain protection against the RSV disease over several se asons. This study has been 
designed to consider the possibility of a decline in the immune response and level of 
protection through the assessment of annual revaccination  doses administered before the 
start of each season.  
For that reason, the study will not only evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, safety and 
reactogenicity profile following a single dose vaccination regimen of the RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine in adults ≥60 YOA, but will also evaluate the efficacy, safety and 
reactogenicity of add itional vaccine dose s through annual revaccination . The RSV_1dose 
group will  allow the evaluation of multi -year protection of a single dose of the RSVPreF3 
OA vaccine  and the RSV_annual group will allow the evaluation of VE of annual 
revaccination  doses of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_641959] -
Dose 2 were consistent with previous results from the Phase 3 program.  
Based on  this observation , the study design was modified to remove the next annual 
revaccination dose of study vaccine (Dose 3 pre -Season 3) in the NH. The clinical 
development program will continue to evaluate long term follow -up and the optimal 
timing for revacc ination.  
4.2.1.  Case definitions for evaluation of vaccine efficacy  
All participants reporting at least 2 ARI symptoms /signs  meeting the ARI case definition 
(see Table 10) will be followed  up for ARI assessment. Diagnosis and treatment of each 
ARI should be performed according to the local standard of care. RT-PCR testing for 
RSV/hMPV will be performed at [COMPANY_004] clinical laboratory or designated laboratory . 
Therefore, all participants with ARI will be requested to follow all study procedures and 
study contacts defined for the ARI surveillance (i.e., reporting of ARI symptoms /signs , 
ARI visit and follow -up contacts , completion of QoL questionnaires, etc.).

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  55 4.2.2.  Rationale for the use of placebo  (Amended , 12 July 2023)  
As there was no licensed RSV vaccine available  at the time of initiation of this study , a 
placebo group (receiving saline solution) is used as control for the efficacy, 
safety /reactogenicity  and immunogenicity assessments.  
4.2.3.  Rationale for s tudy blinding  
Given the difference in reconstitution and visual appearance of the RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine  and the saline solution used as placebo , double blinding is not 
possible , and the study wi ll be conducted in an observer -blind manner.  Please refer to 
Section 10.5.2  (Glossary of Terms) for the definition of observer -blind.  
Further i nformation on blinding and unblinding is provided in Section 6.3.[ADDRESS_641966] -Dose 2 from study  RSV  OA=ADJ -002, a single 
dose regimen (0.5 mL) and the 120 µg RSVPreF3/AS01 E formulation were selected for 
further evaluat ion in the Phase 3 clinical program . The RSV OA=ADJ -[ADDRESS_641967] RSV and vaccine efficacy over several seasons. Based on the 
data from clinical development programs for AS01 -adjuvanted protein ant igen vaccines 
in OA, such as Shingrix  and the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
investigational vaccine, it was expected that immunological responses would reach 
higher levels [ADDRESS_641968] -Dose 1. However, th e 
RSV  OA=AD J-[ADDRESS_641969] dose had no added value in terms of humoral and/or cellular  immune responses. The 
humoral response, both in terms of RSV  A neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs ) 
and RSVPreF3 -binding IgG geometric mean concentrations ( GMCs ), peaked [ADDRESS_641970] 
dose.  For the rationale of the annual revaccination s, please refer to Section 4.2. 
The results from study  RSV  OA=AD J-[ADDRESS_641971] 
one of the 30 µg and 60 µg formulation s with the same adjuvant content or unadjuvanted. 
An increase in the RSVPreF3 -binding  IgG GMCs and fold increase over baseline was 
also observed with increase in antigen dose from 30  µg to 120 µg.  The data demonstrated 
an immunologic benefit of any AS01 E or AS01 B formulations over unadjuvanted 
formulations in terms of frequency of RSVPreF3 -specific CD4+ T  cells expressing at 
least 2 markers. Importantly, despi[INVESTIGATOR_498930] d in OA, the AS01 -
containing formulations induced CD4+ T cells frequencies at a close or similar level as in 
Young Adults, that is not observed with the unadjuvanted formulations.  
There was no safety concern detected in unadjuvanted groups to be linked to the 
RSVPreF3 antigen assessed for the first time in OA. T he acceptable safety/reactogenicity 
profile in all 120 µg groups, together with the immunological benefit demonstrated for 
the 120 µg antigen dose, supports the selection of a 120 µg based formulatio n. The

5.3. Caregiver support  
Study participants may decide to assign a caregiv er to help them fulfilling the study 
procedures. Please refer to Section 10.5.2  for the definition of a caregiver.  
A caregiver can be appointed  by [CONTACT_499045], when the 
participant feels it’s necessary. Each caregiver should receive the caregiver information 
letter before providing support to the study participant. Ideally, a single caregiver should 
be appointed b y the participant but, in some situations, it may happen that several 
caregivers will support a study participant throughout the conduct of the study (for 
example in LTCF setting). This should be recorded in the source documents.  
Caregivers may help the st udy participants with performing some practical study 
procedures such as receiving or making phone calls to study staff, planning study visits, 
transcribing responses to questionnaires and diaries, performing the nasal swab, 
transportation to and from the study site, etc. However, at no time, the caregiver should 
evaluate the participant’s health status while answering diaries and/or questionnaires or 
make decisions on behalf of the participant. At the time of recruitment, the study staff 
should inform the participant of the possibility to appoint a caregiver. Then, at each study 
visit with the exception of the end of study visits (Visit 7NH/Visit 5SH) , the site staff 
should check with the participant if he/she wishes to appoint a caregiver or if there were 
or will be changes in caregiver.  
Please refer to the SPM for additional information on the appointment of a caregiver .

6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
The study vaccine  must be stored in a safe, locked place  at the temperature specified on 
the vaccine label. The storage temperature should be continuously monitored with 
calibrated (if not validated) temperature monitoring device(s) and recorded. Only 
authorized  study personnel sho uld be allo wed access to the study vaccine . Storage 
conditions will be assessed by a sponsor study contact [CONTACT_227246] -study activities. Refer 
to the section on Study Supplies in the SPM for more details on storage and handling of 
the study vaccine . 
6.3. Measure s to minimi ze bias: randomi zation and blinding  
6.3.1.  Participant  identification  
Participant identification numbers will be assigned to the participants who have 
consented to participate in the study, according to the range of participant identification 
numbers a llocated to each study center.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  63 6.3.2.  Randomi zation to study intervention  (Amended, 12 July 2023)  
For Dose 1, the randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_14455]:  
• In Part 1, the study participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:3 ratio to 1 of 
the 4  study groups a t Visit 1 (Day 1).  
• In Part 2, the study participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 
2 study groups at Visit 1 (Day 1).  Part 2 will be initiated when the vaccine lots for 
Part 1 are no longer available at the study sites.  
To allow [COMPANY_004] to take advantage of greater rates of recruitment in this multi -center study 
and to thus reduce the overall study recruitment period, an over -randomization of 
supplies will be prepared.  
At Visit 3 (pre -Season 2), all participants who received 1 of the RSVP reF3 vaccine lots  
will be re -randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 2  sub-groups (RSV_annual group and 
RSV_1dose group) to receive annual revaccination  (Dose 2 and Dose 3 * in NH and Dose 
2 in SH) . 
* Participants in the NH who will have their Visit 5NH after  the approval  of the 
current Protocol Amendment 5 will not receive any study intervention at pre -Season  3 
visit (Visit 5NH).  
The randomization of supplies within blocks will be performed at [COMPANY_004], using MATerial 
EXcellence (MAtEx), a program developed for use in St atistical Analysis System (SAS) 
(Cary, NC, [LOCATION_002] [US]) by [CONTACT_23983]. Entire blocks will be shipped to the study 
centers/warehouse(s).  
6.3.3.  Intervention allocation to the participant  
An automated internet -based system (Source data Base for Internet Randomization 
[SBIR]) will be used for randomization and for identification of intervention material. 
For Dose 1  in Part 1, t he system’s randomization algorithm will use a  stratification by 
[CONTACT_499046] (participants included in reactogenicity/immunogenicity sub set or not)  and a 
minimization procedure accounting for center, age and region within each subset . For 
Dose 1 in Part  2, the system’s randomization algorithm will use a minimization procedure 
accounting for center, age and region . Minimization factors will  have equal weight in the 
minimization algorithm.  
The intervention numbers will be allocated by [CONTACT_301899].  
Upon providing the participant identification number and the participant’s category for 
all minimization factors, the randomization system will determine the study group and 
will provide the intervention  number to be used for the vaccination.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  64 When all participants will be randomized for their Dose 1 in the SBIR system, a re -
randomization will be run as follows:  
• The randomization file related to Do se 1 will be extracted from SBIR.  
• A re-randomization of the participants included in the RSVPreF3 groups will be 
prepared to identify which of those participants will be allocated to the RSV_annual 
groups or to the RSV_1dose groups in a 1:1 ratio.  
This re -randomization will be accounting for:  
− The different stratification and minimization factors used for the initial 
randomization: part (Part 1 or Part 2), subset (participants included in 
reactogenicity/immunogenicity subset or not), center, age and region;  
− The RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine lot allocated for Dose 1 (Lot 1, 2, 3 
or 4).  
• The updated randomization file including the allocation of participants to one of the 
2 groups for each lot (RSV_annual group  or RSV_1dose group) will be uploaded in 
SBIR . 
The re -randomization file will be prepared by [CONTACT_499047]. It 
will not be accounting for any data collected in the eCRF, but only for data collected in 
SBIR for the allocation to the initial study group.  
Upon providing the parti cipant identification number, the randomization system will 
provide the intervention  number to be used for the re -vaccination doses.  
When SBIR is not available, please refer to the SBIR user guide or SPM for specific 
instructions.  
Refer to the SPM for addi tional information relative to the intervention number  
allocation.  
6.3.4.  Allocation of participants to assay subsets  
Evaluation of solicited events and the humoral immune response  will be performed in a  
subset of participant s, referred to as r eactogenicity and immunogenicity subset . This 
subset will include a pproximately 1800 participant s (corresponding to ~ 7% of the total 
study population) from the 3 RSVPreF3  OA investigational vaccine lot groups and 
placebo group  (1:1:1:3  ratio) in Part 1 , including participan ts from NH and SH, as 
indicated in  Table 13.

Participants contributing to the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset will be 
recruited from a selected number of  countries and selected number of sites. In the 
selected sites, the investigator will allocate the first participants in each age category to 
the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset until the allocated target is reached.  
At time of randomization for D ose 1, the subset will be entered in SBIR as stratification 
factor. A randomization blocking scheme (1:1:1:3 ratio) will be used to ensure that 
balance between interventions is maintained. The randomization algorithm will use a 
minimization procedure accou nting for center, age and region within the subset. All 
minimization factors will have equal weight in the minimization algorithm.  
6.3.5.  Blinding and unblinding   
Data will be collected in an observer -blind manner. To do so, vaccine will be prepared 
and administe red by [CONTACT_9260] (unblinded) who will not participate in 
data collection, evaluation  or review of any study endpoint (i.e. , reactogenicity, safety, 
efficacy).  
The unblinded study personnel are allowed to transcribe source data into the eCRF 
without interpretation or generation of data.  
The laboratory in charge of the sample testing will be blinded to the intervention 
assignment. Codes will be used to link the participant and study (without any link to the 
intervention attributed to the participant) to each sample.  
At different analyses, there will be a risk of individual unblinding. Given that summary 
safety results may unblind some specific participants (e.g. , an AE occurring only in a 
single g roup), anyone having access to these analyses could become unblinded regarding 
that specific case. In order to maintain the whole team (Central, Local, Investigators) and 
participants blinded at the individual participant level , a firewall team will be set  up. This 
firewall team will  allow all analyses until the implementation of Protocol Amendment 4  
to be performed and results reported to the relevant authorities while the study blind is 
maintained.  In case no participant is reported in 1 group (e.g. , a certain event being only 
reported in participants in the other  study group), the blinding of results is managed by [CONTACT_499048]  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  66 Independent External Statistician (IES).  In this situation, exact results per group are not 
provided  to the blinded team members and the investigators . The firewall team will 
review the results before they are distributed to the study team, to prevent these data 
potentially leading to unblinding at participant level of the study team. Further details of 
this approach can be found in the firewall charter.  
For analyses planned a s of the implementation of Protocol Amendment 4, [COMPANY_004] RSV OA 
team members  will be unblinded at the individual participant level  in order to support the 
regulatory activities and study  results  interpretation , with the exception of [COMPANY_004]  RSV OA 
team members  involved in clinical evaluation (i.e. , personnel involved in data review and 
validation , ARI/LRTD case adjudication, lab oratory  testing) , study participants, 
investigators and site perso nnel involved in  the clinical evaluation of the participants , 
who will remain blinded at the individual participant level up to end of study. In case no 
participant is reported in 1 group (e.g. , a certain event being only reported in participants 
in the other study group), exact results per group will not be provided to blinded team 
members and the investigators. The firewall team will no  longer be active.  
A participant may continue in the study if that participant’s intervention assignment is 
unblinde d (see Sections [IP_ADDRESS]  and [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Emerge ncy unblinding   
Unblinding a participant’s individual intervention number should occur ONLY in case of 
a medical emergency when knowledge of the intervention is essential for the clinical 
management or welfare of the participant.  
The emergency unblinding process enables the investigator to have unrestricted, 
immediate and direct access to the participant’s individual study intervention  via SBIR . 
As back -up process, the investigator has the option of contact[CONTACT_30697] a [COMPANY_004] Helpdesk (refer  
to the Table 14) if he/she needs help performing the unblinding (i.e. , he/she cannot access 
SBIR ). 
A non -investigator physician (e.g. , physician from emergency room) or 
participant/caregiver member may also request emergency unblinding either via the 
investigator (preferred option) or via the [COMPANY_004] Helpdesk (back -up process). The 
patient/participant card lists contact [CONTACT_499049].  
[COMPANY_004]’s Global Safety staff may unblind the intervention assignment for any participant 
with a n SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or 
more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identifying the participant’s intervention 
assignment, may be sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or [COMPANY_004] 
policy.

7. DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY INTERVENTION AN D 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1. Discontinuation of study intervention  (Amended , 12 July 
2023)  
‘Discontinuation’ of study intervention means any participant who has not received all 
planned doses of vaccine. A participant who discontinued study intervention may, if 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093], continue other study procedures (e.g. , subsequent 
dose, efficacy, safety or immunogenicity) if planned in the study pro tocol.  
The primary reason for premature discontinuation of the study intervention will be 
documented in the eCRF based on the following:  
• Adverse event requiring expedited reporting to [COMPANY_004]  
• Unsolicited non -serious AE  
• Solicited event  
• Not willing to be vaccinated  
• Other (specify).  
Refer to Section 7.1.2  for contraindications to subsequent vaccination. Refer to Section  
10.5.2  (glossary of terms) for the definition of intervention.  
Participants who do not consent for the annual revaccination will be considered 
withdrawals from the study.  
7.1.1.  Criteria for temporar y delay for enrol lment and/or vaccination  
Study vaccine  administration may be postponed within the permitted time frame for each 
study vaccination within eac h country until transient circumstances cited below are 
resolved:  
• Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccination. Fever is defined as a 
temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F by [CONTACT_28414]. The route  for measuring temperature 
can be oral , axillary or tympanic . 
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  71 • Participants with symptoms suggestive of active Coronavirus Disea se 2019 (COVID -
19) infection (e.g. fever, cough, etc.). The return to the site of the participant will 
follow the specific guidance from local public health and other competent authorities 
(e.g., free of symptoms, COVID -19 negative testing,  etc.). 
• Particip ants with known COVID -[ADDRESS_641985] 14 days after the exposure if 
the participant  remains symptom free.  
• Participants with a minor illness (such as mild diarrh ea, mild upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_42977]) without fever may be vaccinated at the discretion of the investigator.  
• In case of administration of inactivated and subunit influenza vaccines: 
Postponement of study vaccine  administration  within given protocol timelines to 
allow respect of  the 14 day -interval between flu vaccination and study vaccine  
administration . 
Refer to Table  5 and Table 6 in Section 1.3 for the allowed time intervals  in Northern and 
Southern hemisp heres, respectively . 
7.1.2.  Contraindications to subsequent vaccine administration  
(Amended, 12 July 2023)  
Participants must be evaluated to confirm that there are no contraindications  for 
subsequent vaccination before administering each additional study vaccine dose.  
Participants who meet any of the criteria listed below or criteria listed in Sections 5.2.1 , 
5.2.2  and 5.2.3  should not receive  additional  vaccinations . However, these participants 
should be encouraged to continue other study procedures at the discretion of the 
investigator (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). The relevant criteria for discontinuing vaccination must 
be recorded in the eCRF.  
• Participants  who experience any SAE judged to be possibly or probably related to 
the study vaccine or non -study concomitant vaccines, including hypersensitivity 
reactions.  
• Participants who develop any new condition which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], may pose additional risk to the participant if he/she continues to 
participate in the study.  
• Occurrence of  a new pI[INVESTIGATOR_498933], in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], exposes the participant to unacceptable risk from 
subsequent vaccination. In such cases, the investigator should use his/her clinical 
judgment prior to administer ing the next dose of the vaccine. Refer to Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]  for the definition of pI[INVESTIGATOR_159170].  
Note: This section  is not applicable at pre -Season [ADDRESS_641986] their Visit 5NH after the approval  of the current Protocol Amendment 5 and

12 July 2023  72 7.2. Participant discontinuation/withdrawal from the study  
A participant i s considered a ‘withdrawal’ from the study when no study procedure has 
occurred, no follow -up has been performed and no further information has been collected 
for this participant from the date of withdrawal/last contact.  
From an analysis perspective, a ‘w ithdrawal’ from the study refers to any participant who 
did not return  for the concluding visit  foreseen in the protocol.  Investigators will attempt 
to contact [CONTACT_499050] -up. All data 
and samples col lected until the date of withdrawal/last contact [CONTACT_499051].  
The primary reason for study withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF based on the 
list below:  
• AEs requiring expedited  reporting to [COMPANY_004] (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for details)  
• Unsolicited non -serious  AE 
• Solicited event  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_3445], not due to an AE* 
• Migrated/ moved from the study area  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Sponsor study termination  
• Other (specify) . 
* If a participant is withdrawn from the study because he/she has withdrawn consent and 
provided the reason for its withdrawal, the investigator must document this reason in the 
eCRF.  
Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of SAEs/AEs must be clearly 
distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will 
follow participants who are withdrawn from the study as result of an SAE/AE until the 
event is resolved (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
7.3. Lost to follow -up 
A participant will be considered ‘lost to follow -up’ if he or she fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298].  
Please refer to the SPM for a description of the actions to be taken before considering the 
participant as lost to follow -up.

(AMENDED , 12 JULY 2023)  
Study p rocedures and their timing s are summari zed in  Table 1 and Table 2 for 
participants in NH, Table 3 for participants in SH and Table  4 for ARI surveillance 
(Section  1.3). The intervals between study visits are  provided in Table  5, Table [ADDRESS_641987].  
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed unless necessary for the management  of 
an immediate safety concern . 
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor as soon as they occur or 
when the study team is aware of them. The purpose of this communication is to 
determine if the participant(s) should discontinue the study intervention.  
The SPM provides the investigator and site personnel with administrative and detailed 
technical information that does not impact participant safety.  
During special circumstances (e.g., COVID -19 pandemic), the specific guidance from 
local public health and other competent authorities regarding the protection of 
individuals’ welfare must be applied. For the duration of such special circumstances, the 
following measures may be implemented for enrolled participants:  
• Safety follow -up may be made by a telephone call, other means of virtual contact [CONTACT_227249]  (from the site staff or from home care service system) , if appropriate.  
• Diary cards may be transmitted fro m and to the site by [CONTACT_499052]’s  residence . 
• Visits for suspected ARI may take place in a different location* other than the study 
site or at participant’s home. If this is not feasible, then the medical  evaluation of 
ARI may take place virtually with documentation of ARI symptom s and other 
relevant ARI information  by [CONTACT_499053] . 
• Biological samples may be collected at a different location* other than the study site 
or at participant’s home. Biological samples should not be collected if they cannot be 
processed in a timely manner or appropriately stored until the intended use.  
• Throat and/or nasal swab samples collected at ARI visits may be taken by [CONTACT_499054] (for example , a swab sample may be taken by [CONTACT_22805])  with site staff supervision and guidance , if required by [CONTACT_13125].

for this visit may be extended up to maximum 14 days after ARI onset  (i.e., until 
Day 15, refer to Figure 3 for ARI flow) . In any case , the participant should be 
encour aged to take the self -swab as per  protocol (i.e., preferably within 48 hours 
after ARI onset but not later than 5 days after ARI onset) to maximize the chance to 
detect the virus.  
* It is the investigator’s responsibility to identify an alternate location.  The investigator 
should ensure that this alternate location meets ICH GCP requirements, such as 
adequate facilities to perform study procedures, appropriate training of the staff and 
documented delegation of responsibilities in this location. This alterna te location should 
be covered by [CONTACT_499055] a site other than the designated study site. Refer to EMA Guidance on the 
Management of Clinical Trials during the COVID -19 (Coronavirus ) pandemic (version

12 July 2023  75 [IP_ADDRESS].1.  Nasal self -swab training with the study participant  
At Visit 2, the study participants may be invited to practice a nasal self -swab in the 
presence of site staff to guide them through the instructions and the procedure. The n asal 
self-swab training can be repeated at any subsequent visit if the participant raises the need 
for a new training. This swab should be discarded after the training, it should not be sent 
to the central laboratory . 
ARI surveillance starts as of Visit 1,  however no nasal self -swab will be requested from 
the participant for ARI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] s occurring before Visit 2.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Definitions for ARI surveillance  
• ARI onset (Day 1):  will be defined as the first day when the study participant 
presents at least 2 concomitant  ARI symptoms /signs  meeting the ARI case definition  
(see Table 10 in Section 4.2.1 ). The ARI case must be confirmed by [CONTACT_1275]/ site staff  or delegate during the ARI visit.  
Note: The start and end date of each individual symptom  and the presence/absence of 
each sign  will be recorded in the eCRF. It may happen that the start date of an 
individual symptom/sign is before  the ARI onset date, if the first symptom/sign 
started before the second symptom/sign needed to reach the ARI case definition.  
• ARI end: will be defined a s the first day when all ARI symptoms/signs of the 
participant have returned to baseline or when they diminished  significantly as judged 
by [CONTACT_093] . 
• New ARI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]: An ARI epi[INVESTIGATOR_498937] a new epi[INVESTIGATOR_498938]. Between [ADDRESS_641989] 
7 days free of symptoms/signs (or at baseline level) or at least 7 days with 
significantly diminished symptoms/ signs as judged by [CONTACT_093].

the entire study, starting on the first vaccination day (Visit 1) . The relationship of 
these complications to an ARI epi[INVESTIGATOR_498939].  
− Respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800] : 
• Pneumonia : A clinical diagnosis of pneumonia based on signs and 
symptoms, with or without chest radiograph that demonstrates a new or 
progressive infiltrate.  
• New diagnosis of COPD or exacerbation of COPD : A new diagnosis of 
COPD or, in a participant with previously diagnosed COPD, a worsening of 
COPD necessitating to increase the dosage or modify the treatment 
administered.  
• New diagnosis of asthma or exacerbation of asthma : A new diagnosis of 
asthma or, in  a participant with previously diagnosed asthma, a worsening 
of asthma necessitating to increase the dosage or modify the treatment 
administered.

Each ARI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (including if several epi[INVESTIGATOR_498941]) will be 
assigned a sequential case number. All relevant ARI information will be reported in a 
specific ARI eCRF screen.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Spontaneous reporting by [CONTACT_499057] l be instructed to contact [CONTACT_499058]/site staff 
promptly if they experience at least 2 ARI symptoms/signs (see Table 10 in Section 
4.2.1 ). The surveillance for ARI will start on the first vaccination day (Visit 1). At Visit 
1, participants will be provided with instruction materia l to guide them in the detection of 
ARI symptoms/signs.  At Visit 2, participants will be invited to practice  nasal self -swab 
collection (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 ). Note that no nasal self -swab will be requested from 
the participant for ARI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] s occurring before Visit 2.  
At each study visit/contact, participants should be reminded to contact [CONTACT_1275]/site staff if they experience respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y symptoms meeting the ARI case

NH: Northern hemisphere; SH: Southern hemisphere.  
In some SH countries, recruitment might start during an RSV Season (Season 0).  
Surveillance for ARI will be carried out during the entire study, via spontaneous reporting by [CONTACT_87755] 
(starting on the day of  first vaccination [Visit 1]) and by [CONTACT_499059] s (starting from V isit 2 onwards)  with 
different frequencies of contact [CONTACT_499043] -season periods.  
The site staff surveillance contacts will be performed: every 2 weeks during the RSV seasons (Solid blue ) and every 
month during the inter -season per iods (Shaded blue). The RSV seasons defined for this study are: from 1  October to 
30 April in NH and from 1  March to 30  September in SH.  Based on the observed RSV circulation during the season , 
the ARI surveillance and/or the DLP for analyses could be adap ted for the ongoing and/or subsequent seasons.  
Note: If following the sample size re -assessment an additional cohort needs to be enrolled before the next season in 
NH (see Section 9.2.3 ), similar ARI surveillance will apply up to the end of the third season for those participants. 
Study Year 1 corresponds to the year in which the enrollment started for the cohort.  
* The last study visit in SH (Visit  5 SH) will occur  approximately 2 months after the start of Season 3 in SH ; yet the site 
staff surveillance contacts will be performed monthly during these last months ( i.e., continuation of the inter -season 
frequency of contacts).  
Multiple formats can be proposed by [CONTACT_499060]. 
This may be done via e -mail, text message , fax or phone call for example, or via a visit 
for LTCF participants. The most appropriate format should be agreed between  site staff 
and the study participant. Text messages, e -mail and fax may be used as a screening to 
check if the participant has anything to report. If the participant answers yes for at least 
one of the items of interest, a phone call must be done to get t he details on the event(s). 
Receipt of the message must be confirmed by [CONTACT_448857], as applicable.  
At each scheduled  contact, participants will be asked if they have experienced:

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_642044] -study AE/SAE is defined as any event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE 
reporting periods defined in  Table  23 . Investigators are not obligated to actively seek 
AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator lea rns of any 
SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the 
study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study vaccine, the 
investigator will promptly notify the Study Contact [CONTACT_499085] 25. 
8.3.2.  Method of detecting AEs and SAEs and other events  
Methods of detecting and recording AE/SAE/ AESI  (including pI[CONTACT_28839] s and AF)  are 
detailed in Section  10.3.8 . The assessment of AE/SAE intensity, causality and outcome 
are provided  in the Section 10.3.9 .

method of acquiring information related to an AE/ SAE/ AESI ( including pI[CONTACT_28839] s and AF) . 
8.3.3.  Regulatory r eporting requirements for SAEs  and other events   
Once an investigator (or designee) becomes aware that a study participant has 
experienced a n SAE/ AESI  (including pI[CONTACT_28839] s and AF) , he/she must report it to [COMPANY_004] 
using the required documentation, and within the timeframes, mentioned in  Table 24. 
This is essential for meeting legal obligations and ethical responsibilities f or participant 
safety and the safety o f a study intervention  under clinical investigation.  
For SAEs/ AESIs  (including pI[CONTACT_28839] s and AF) , the investigator will always provide an 
assessment of causality at the time of the initial report, as defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy for the preparation of an investigator 
safety report for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) must be 
followed. These reports will be forwarded to investigators as necessary.  
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify local authorities and other regulatory 
agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor 
will comply w ith country -specific regulatory requirements related to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC, and investigators.

This analysis will also include data from participants enrolled in SH  available at that 
time. 
If the number of cases triggering VE Analysis 1 ( at least 56 cases) is not achieved at the 
end of Season [ADDRESS_642050] been accrued  (at the end of Season 1 in NH  or later) . In that case, an 
adjustment of the Type  I error will be done in order to maintain the overall significance 
level at 2.5%. The Wan g-Tsiatis approach which is an alpha spending method giving 
boundaries between O’Brien -Fleming and Pocock boundaries will be used [ Wang , 1987] 
to determine the adjusted alpha levels for the interim (α1) and the final (α2) analyses . If 
the interim analysis is performed, then the final analysis will be performed when at least 
60 cases a re accrued in the primary cohort for efficacy  or when all data associated to the 
primary objective are available . 
Table 26 provides the 1 -sided adjusted alpha levels obtained using the Wang -Tsiatis 
method with Δ = 0.3, depending on the quantity  of information accumulated at the time

9.2. Sample size determination  
The study will enroll up to  25 000 participant s, distributed as follows : 
• Between at least 16 000 and up to 23 000 participants in the NH, and  
• Between 1  500 and 2 000 participants in the SH.  
Approximately 1  800 participant s will be included in the reactogenicity and 
immunogenicity subset with 1  620 participant s in NH and 180 participant s in SH.  
The sections below describe the assumptions and methodology used for the sample size 
calculation.  
Withdrawals will not be replaced.  
9.2.1.  Primary objective: Vaccine efficacy  
The overall Type I error is equal to 2.5% (1 -sided alpha=0.025). The sample size has 
been calculated based on the number of cases needed to demonstrate a VE against 
RSV  confirmed LRTD during the first season in NH, with the criterion of a LL of the 
95% CIs >20%.  
Hypothesis to show VE can be written as follows:  
H0: VE  20% versus Ha: VE >20%

9.2.3.  Sample size re -assessment  
The number of RSV -confirmed LRTD cases for the primary objective will be monitored 
on an ongoing basis during Season 1. This wi ll be performed in a blinded way by 
[CONTACT_499094].  
If the total number of cases reported up to early April  is low compared to the trigger for 
analysis (at least 56 cases), a second cohort (new participants) might be enrolled before 
the next season in NH, in order to continue the accrual of the cases at the next season 
(Season 1 of second  cohort) and to increas e the number of cases needed to demonstrate 
the primary objective.  
At the time of evaluation, the following rule will be applied for the enrol lment of the 
second cohort:  
• If the total number of cases is greater than 50 cases or lower than 12 cases:  No 
enrollment of second cohort. The monitoring will continue and VE Analysis 1 will 
be performed as described in Section 9.1.1 . 
• If the total number of cases is included in [ 12, 50 cases]: Enrol lment of a second 
cohort. In that case, new participants in NH will be enrolled and vaccinated before 
the next season in NH. The monitoring will continue and VE Analysis [ADDRESS_642073]

12 July 2023  110 According to feasi bility of enrol lment of this second cohort before the next season, it is 
estimated that a maximum number of 10  000 participants might be enrolled in the second 
cohort.  
[COMPANY_004] can decide to cancel this re -enrol lment if the final analysis (at least 56 cases) is 
performed at the end of Season 1 in NH or if the interim analysis is successful.  
The participants in this second cohort will be randomized in 3 study groups: RSV_annual 
group, RSV_1dose group and Placebo gr oup, according to a 1:1:[ADDRESS_642074] cohort.  
The system’s randomization algorithm will use a minimization procedure accounting for 
center, age and region . Minimization fa ctors will have equal weight in the minimization 
algorithm.  
9.2.4.  Reactogenicity subset  
Solicited events  information will be collected for a subset of participants using paper 
diaries . Approximately 1800 participants will be included in the reactogenicity subset  
from  both NH and SH  (see Table 13). 
Table [ADDRESS_642075] one event, depending on the true AE 
rate, for 900 participants per group as well as for smaller subsets, as reactogenicity 
analysis might be done on several subgroups (e.g. , by [CONTACT_67579], region). A subset of

[IP_ADDRESS].  Demography  
For a given participant and a given demog raphic variable, missing measurements will not 
be replaced.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Efficacy  
All reported ARI cases will be reviewed by [CONTACT_11136], qualified [COMPANY_004] staff members to 
determine whether certain investigator -reported events meet the definition of efficacy 
endpoints (LRTD a nd severe LRTD), using pre -defined endpoint criteria. This review 
will be made on clinical criteria (signs/symptoms) and independently of the results of the 
RSV RT-PCR . 
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  113 Detailed information on this adjudication process, including for data obtained by 
[CONTACT_499096] -specified or for missing data, will be described in 
the adjudication charter.  
For a given participant and a given efficacy measurement, missing or non -evaluable 
measurements will not be imputed for the primary analysis. The missing endpoint and 
censoring are supposed to occur independently, and the pattern of the missingness being 
either Completely At Random (MCAR) or Missing At Random (MAR) only.  
The potential RSV or hMPV infections, including the potential infection to Aden ovirus, 
Enterovirus and Parainfluenza viruses, will be assessed by [CONTACT_937] -PCR testing of swab 
samples (see Table 19). Swab samples that are positive for RSV and/or hMPV by  [CONTACT_937]-
PCR will be tested by a multiplex PCR (panel of viruses) for detection of potential viral 
co-infection.  
A case that is positive by [CONTACT_489779] -PCR for RSV A and/or RSV B will be 
counted as an RSV -confirmed case, whatever the result for RSVA/B t ested by [CONTACT_499097]-PCR, for hMPV or other respi[INVESTIGATOR_498978] -PCR (co -infection).  
A case that is positive by [CONTACT_76878] -PCR for hMPV will be counted as a hMPV -
confirmed case, whatever the result for RSV A/B or other respi[INVESTIGATOR_498979] (co -infection).  
The events linked to primary and secondary efficacy outcomes will be identified and in 
case multiple events are observed for the same participant, only the first event will be 
considered for the primary analysis of all primary/secondary  endpoints.  
Therefore, for the primary analysis of the primary objective, the number of RSV -
confirmed LRTD will be computed on the first occurrence of qRT -PCR -confirmed RSV 
A and/or RSV B associated LRTD, starting on Day [ADDRESS_642080]  vaccination (starting from Visit 1).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Immunogenicity  
• Any missing or non -evaluable immunogeni city measurement will not be replaced. 
The descriptive analysis performed for each assay at each time point will exclude 
participants with a missing or non -evaluable measurement.  
• The geometric mean titers/concentrations (GMTs/GMCs) will be computed by 
[CONTACT_43101] -logarithm of the arithmetic mean of the log 10 transformed 
titers/concentrations.  
• A seronegative participant will be defined as a participant whose antibody 
titer/concentration is below the cut -off value of the assay. A seropositive participant 
is a participant whose antibody titer/concentration is greater than or equal to the cut -
off value of the assay.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Reactogenicity/Safety   
• For a given participant and the analysis of solicited events within [ADDRESS_642081] -
vaccination, missing or non -evalu able measurements will not be replaced. Therefore, 
the analysis of solicited events will include only vaccinated participants with 
documented solicited safety data (i.e., paper diary completed).  
• For analysis of unsolicited AEs, SAEs, AESIs (including pI[INVESTIGATOR_498980])  and 
concomitant medications, all vaccinated participants will be considered. Participants 
who did not report an event or concomitant medication will be considered as 
participants without the event or the concomitant medication respectively.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Qualit y of life  
• The FLU -PRO version 2.0 is a 32 -item daily diary assessing influenza signs and 
symptoms across 6 body systems: Nose (4 items), Throat (3 items), Eyes (3 items), 
Chest/Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (7 items, i.e., LRTI), Gastrointestinal (4 items), and 
Body/Systemi c (11 items). Respondents are asked to rate each sign or symptom on a 
5-point ordinal scale, with higher scores indicating a more frequent sign or symptom. 
For 27 of the items, the scale is as follows: 0 (“Not at all”), 1 (“A little bit”), 
2 (“Somewhat”), 3 (“Quite a bit”), and 4 (“Very much”). For 2 items, severity is 
assessed in terms of numerical frequency, i.e., vomiting or diarrhea (0 times, 1 time, 
2 times, 3 times, or 4 or more times); with the final 3 items; frequency of sneezing, 
coughing, and coug hed up mucus or phlegm evaluated on a scale from 0 (“Never”) 
to 4 (“Always”). The FLU -PRO total score is computed as the mean score across all 
32 items comprising the instrument. Total scores can range from 0 (symptom free) to 
4 (very severe symptoms).  
In addition, a score assessing the symptoms associated with upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_498981] 10 items that make up the 
Nose, Throat and Eyes domains.  
Six individual domain scores will also be computed, representing sympt om severity 
in each of the assessed body areas: Nose, Throat, Eyes, Chest/Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (i.e., 
LRTD), Gastrointestinal and Body/Systemic. Each domain score is calculated as the 
mean of all items comprising that domain, with scores ranging from 0 to 4.  
• The PG I-S and the PGI -C are 2 patient -reported questions on the severity of 
symptoms and the change in symptoms, respectively. The PGI -S classifies the 
severity of symptoms into 5 categories (No symptoms, Mild, Moderate, Severe, 
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  115 Very  severe). The PGI -C classifie s the change in symptoms from the previous day 
into 7 categories (Much better, Somewhat better, A little better, About the same, 
A little worse, Somewhat worse and Much worse).  
• The EQ -5D health utility questionnaire, described through 5 dimensions scores ( i.e., 
mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) will be 
converted into generate health profiles, i.e., a respondent who responds 1 (no 
problem/no symptom) to all 5 items has a profile “[ZIP_CODE]” and similarly a participant  
who responds with the highest level of difficulty or symptom to all items has a 
profile “[ZIP_CODE]”. These profiles are subsequently converted to a continuous single 
index utility score using a 1 to 1 matching.  
• The SF -12 questionnaire is a multi -purpose healt h survey with 12 questions. The SF -
12 covers 8  HR-QoL domains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, 
general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health). From 
these domains, summary scores for the physical component and mental component 
are computed. Scale scores will be constructed following the summated ratings and 
standardized SF -12 scoring algorithms.  
9.4.2.  Demographics and participants disposition  
Demographic characteristics (age at first vaccination in years, BMI, sex , race, ethnicity, 
geographical hemisphere location (Northern/Southern), type of residence (CD/LTCF), 
vital signs, comorbidities, frailty status and smoking status) will be summarized by [CONTACT_499098]:  
• Frequency tables will be generate d for categorical variables such as race;  
• Mean, median, standard deviation and range will be provided for continuous data as 
age. 
The number of doses of the study vaccine administered will be tabulated by [CONTACT_19313].  
The distribution of participants will be tabulated as a whole and per group, for each age 
category, for each country and for each subset.  
The following age categories will be considered in the analysis: ≥65 years, ≥70 years, 
≥80 years, 60 -69 years, 70 -79 years.  
Withdrawal status will be summarized by [CONTACT_227257]:  
• The number of participants enrolled into the study as well as the number of 
participants excluded from PP analyses will be tabulated.  
• The numbers of withdrawn participants will be tabulated according to the  reason for

[Chan , 1998]. This method computes an exact CI around the rate ratio (ratio of the event 
rates in the vaccine versus control groups). The analysis will consider t he exact inference 
on the relative risk, adjusted by [CONTACT_499099], conditionally to the total 
number of cases observed and time at risk. VE is defined as [ADDRESS_642083] 
occurrenc e of event or censoring will be considered for the time at risk.  
During the surveillance period, all events related to the efficacy endpoints will be 
collected (see Section 8.1.1 ), but only the first event of RSV -confirmed LRTD will be 
considered for the primary analysis of efficacy endpoints.  
For a given participant, the first occurrence of LRTD will be considered as a confirmed 
RSV  positive  case for primary efficacy analysis if : 
• At least 1 sample is tested positive for RSV A and/or RSV B by [CONTACT_499100] -PCR, or  
• At least 1 sample is tested positive for RSV A and/or B by [CONTACT_499101] 
(non-[COMPANY_004]), if a [COMPANY_004] qRT -PCR result is not available.  
A sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed considering the 
RSV cases confirmed by [CONTACT_499102] -PCR only, i.e. , excluding the ones identified by 
[CONTACT_499103].

All analysis of patient -reported outcomes (i.e., EQ -5D, SF -12 and the daily health 
questionnaires) for RSV -confirmed cases will be carried out on the mES RSV -confirmed  
ARI cohort or  mES RSV -confirmed LRTD cohort, as appropriate . Data will be analyzed 
using descriptive statistics for the multi -item SF -12, EQ -5D and FLU -PRO  scales for 
each study group at each time point.  
Descriptive statistics of the EQ -5D, SF -12 and FLU -PRO scales completed pre -Seasons 1

[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Correlate of protection  (Amended , 12 July 2023)  
An exploratory analysis will be implemented in attempt to correlate the humoral immune 
response  to the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine with protection against RSV -
confirmed disease.  
For that purpose, blood samples for humoral immune response will be collected from all 
participants at pre -Dose 1 (Day 1) , 1-month post -Dose 1 (Day 31) and at Visit 5NH*  and 
may be tested for correlate of protection analysis in all participants with RSV -confirmed 
disease and in a subset of control participants.  
There are 2 main strategies to define a subset of control: case -cohort and nested case 
control. For the same  number of participants, both methods provide similar results. 
However, the case -cohort strategy has the advantage to be more flexible in terms of data 
exploration and modelling [ Borgan , 2000].  
Statistical analysis will be done in several steps:  
1. Identification of Correlate of Risk: identify immunological response that correlates 
with the endpoint used to measure VE.  
2. Validation of Correlate of Protection, whic h is a correlate of risk that is validated to 
predict a certain level of protection from the targeted endpoint.  
3. Evaluation of a cut -off for protection: identify a “protective threshold” or humoral 
immune response level that distinguishes protected and unpr otected individuals.  
Further details on the methodology to assess the correlate of protection will be given in a 
separate SAP.

The optional interim analysis is described in the below sequence of analyses.  
9.5.1.  Sequence of analyses (Amended, 12 July 2023 ) 
This section is presenting the timing for each analysis. More information on the statistical 
link between the confirmatory objectives can be found in Section 9.1 (Figure 4). 
Analyses to evaluate objectives and endpoints will be performed in several steps:  
1. VE Analysis 1 – Season 1 (Primary Objective):  
The final analy sis of the primary objective will be case -driven. It will be performed when 
at least [ADDRESS_642101] been accrued in the primary cohort for 
efficacy.  
An optional interim analysis might be performed if the number of cases triggering VE 
Analysis 1 (at least 56 cases) is not achieved at the end of Season [ADDRESS_642102] been accrued (at the end of Season 1 
in NH or later). In that case, an adjustment of the Type  I error will be don e in order to 
maintain the overall significance level at 2.5%. The Wang -Tsiatis approach which is an 
alpha spending method giving boundaries between O’Brien -Fleming and Pocock 
boundaries will be used [ Wang , 1987] to determine the adjusted alpha levels for the 
interim (α1) and the final (α2) analyses . The final analysis will be performed when at 
least 60 cases are accrued or when all data associated to the primary objective are 
available.  
All data related to efficacy, safety and immunogenicity objectives available at that time 
will also be analyzed.  
2. VE Analysis 2 – End of Season 1 in NH:  
A second VE analysis will be performed when participants in NH have been follow ed 
until the end of the first season in NH (30 April).  
All analysis generated at VE Analysis [ADDRESS_642103] 2 -3 weeks between the database cut-
off dates of the 2 analyses.  
If data related to endpoints not available at VE Analysis 1 become available at end of 
Season 1, the analysis might be performed at VE Analysis 2.  
All data related t o efficacy and immunogenicity objectives available at that time will also 
be analyzed.  
3. Safety analysis:  
An analysis of safety will be performed when all safety data up to [ADDRESS_642104] -Dose 1 
will be available for all participants in NH and SH.

12 July 2023  126 4. VE Analysis  3: end of Season [ADDRESS_642105] been followed until the end 
of second season (S2) in NH . 
All the analyses described above  will be performed on data as complete and as clean as 
possible, by [CONTACT_499113]. The unblinded analyses will be shared with an unblinded 
committee independent from the project (firewall). Access to individual intervention 
codes and labo ratory data will be restricted to the IES in charge of the analyses.  
The firewall will review the unblinded summaries to prevent the potential risk of 
unblinding at participant level. If the summary results may lead to the unblinding of some 
specific parti cipants (e.g., in case an event occurred only in 1 group), the blinding of 
results will be managed by [CONTACT_499114]. In this situation, exact results per group will not be 
provided to the study team. Only blinded data will be released to the blinded study team 
members and investigators. Further details of this approach can be found in the firewall 
charter. The firewall team will no longer be active as of the implementation of Protocol 
Amendment 4 as of which point study statisticians will perform the analyses and  manage 
the blinding of results for blinded study team members and investigators.  
No individual data listings with the participant numbers information will be disseminated 
to the investigators at this point of time.

12 July 2023  132 10.2.  Appendix  2: Clinical  laboratory tests 
10.2.1.  Laboratory assays for immune response  
RSV A /B neutralization assay  
The serum neutralization assay is a functional assay that measures the ability of serum 
antibodies to neut ralize RSV entry and replication in a host cell line.  
Virus neutralization is performed by [CONTACT_117838] a fixed amount of RSV A strain (Long, 
ATCC No. VR -26) or RSV -B strain ([ZIP_CODE], ATCC No. VR -1580) with serial dilutions of 
the test serum. The serum -virus m ixture is then transferred onto a layer of Vero cells 
(African Green Monkey, kidney, Cercopi[INVESTIGATOR_227203], ATCC CCL 81) and incubated 
for [ADDRESS_642114] RSV (Polyclonal anti -RSV A /B IgG) and a 
secondary antibody conjugated to horse radish  peroxidase (HRP), allowing the 
visualization of plaques after colorati on with TrueBlue  peroxidase substrate. Viral 
plaques are counted using an automated microscope coupled to an image analyzer 
(Scanlab system with a Reading software). For each serum dilution, a ratio, expressed as 
a percentage, is calculated between the number of plaques a t each serum dilution and the 
number of plaques in the virus control wells (no serum added). The serum neutralizing 
titer is expressed in ED60 (Estimated Dilution 60) and corresponds to the inverse of the 
interpolated serum dilution that yields a 60% reduc tion in the number of plaques 
compared to the virus control wells, as described by [CONTACT_2312] [ Barbas , 1992; Bates , 2014]. 
The ED60  neutralizing t iters will also be converted in concentration in International Units 
per milliliter (IU/mL). Secondary standard calibrated against the international reference 
(NIBSC 16/ 284) will be included in the runs.  
RSVPreF3 protein IgG ELISA  
Responses to the RSVPreF3 antigen will be evaluated by [CONTACT_499119]3  IgG binding antibodies in human serum 
samples.  
The principle of  these assays is as follows: RSVPreF3 protein antigen will be adsorbed 
onto a [ADDRESS_642115] curve will be prepared using a pool of commerci al human serum 
containing anti -RSV antibodies. After incubation, the microplate will be washed to 
remove unbound primary antibodies. Bound IgG will be detected by [CONTACT_1121] a 
secondary anti -human antibod y (total IgG -specific), conjugated to HRP. Bound 
antibodies are quantified by [CONTACT_227269], tetramethylbenzidine 
(TMB) and hydrogen peroxide, whereby a colored product develops proportionally to the 
amount of anti -RSVPreF3 protein tota l IgG antibodies present in the serum sample. The 
optical density of each sample dilution is then interpolated on the reference standard. The 
corresponding antibody concentration, corrected for the dilution factor, is expressed in 
arbitrary ELISA Laborator y Units per milliliter (ELU/mL).

12 July 2023  133 Any further  exploratory  immunology testing might be performed to investigate RSV 
and/or hMPV -related immune responses.  
10.2.2.  Laboratory assays for molecular biology  
Quantitative RT-PCR able to discriminate RSV  A and RSV  B subtypes  
Briefly, RSV A and RSV B RNAs extracted from the nasal/throat swabs are detected in a 
duplex RT-PCR format using specific amplification primers and fluorescent probes 
designed in the RSV N gene, encoding the RSV nucleocapsid protein. The process 
involves nucleic acids extraction, conversion of RNA to complementary 
deoxyribonucleic acid by [CONTACT_334061] -time PCR reaction 
using a calibration curve (absolute quantitation). The RSV viral load is reported as copi[INVESTIGATOR_498992] R NA per mL of sample.  
Qualitative multiplex RT-PCR for detection of a panel of viruses including hMPV  
A qualitative multiplex RT-PCR assay is used for the detection and identification of 
multiple respi[INVESTIGATOR_498993]/throat swabs. Th e following virus 
types and subtypes can be identified in the assay:  
• Human adenovirus (AdV)  
• Human metapneumovirus (hMPV)  
• Human enterovirus (HEV)  
• Human parainfluenza virus including at least types 1, 2, 3 and 4 (PIV1, PIV2, PIV3 
and PIV4) . 
Qualitative multiplex RT-PCR for detection of additional respi[INVESTIGATOR_4398]  
A qualitative multiplex RT-PCR assay is used for the detection and identification of 
multiple respi[INVESTIGATOR_498993]/throat swabs. The following virus 
types and subtypes can be identified in the assay:  
• Influenza A virus (Flu A)  
• Influenza B virus (Flu B)  
• Human respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345] A (RSV A)  
• Human respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345] B (RSV B)  
• Human Influenza A virus subtype H1 (Flu A -H1) 
• Human Influenza A virus s ubtype H3 (Flu A -H3) 
• Human Influenza A virus subtype H1pdm09 (Flu A -H1pdm09)  
• Human bocavirus ½/3/4 (HBoV)  
• Human rhinovirus A/B/C  
• Human coronavirus including at least 229E, NL63, OC43 and SARS -CoV-2 species

10.3.  Appendix 3: Adverse Events: definitions  and procedures for 
recording, evaluating, follow -up, and reporting  
10.3.1.  Definition of an Adverse Event (AE)  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether o r not considered 
related to the study intervention.  
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavo rable  and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of study interventi on. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Events meeting the AE definition  
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication 
under study.  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study vaccine administration even 
though they may have been present prior to the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
vaccine or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an 
AE/SAE).  
• Signs or symptoms temporall y associated with study vaccine  administration.  
• Signs, symptoms that require medi cal attention (e.g. , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], physician 
visits and emergency room visits).  
• Pre- or post - intervention events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated 
procedures (i.e. , invasive procedures, modification of participant’s previous 
therapeutic regime n). 
• Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments 
that are present at baseline and significantly worsen following the start of the study 
will also be reported as AEs or SAEs.  
• AEs to be recorded as solicited events  are de scribed in the Section  10.3.3 . All 
other AEs will be recorded as UNSOLICITED AEs.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  135 [IP_ADDRESS].  Events NOT  meeting the AE definition  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. , social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], admission for routine examination).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
• Pre-existing conditions  or signs and/or symptoms present in a participant prior to 
the first study vaccination . These events will be recorded in the medical history 
Section of the eCRF.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336805] a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline.  
• Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments 
that are associated with the disease being studied, unless judged by [CONTACT_499120]’s condition, or that are present or 
detected at the start of the study and do not worsen.  
10.3.2.  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event ( SAE) 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
a. Results in death . 
b. Is life -threatening  
Note: The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer 
to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, had it been more 
severe.  
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498994]: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498995]/or treatment that would not 
have been appropriate in the physician’s office or in an out -patient setting. 
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498996]. If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498997], the 
event will also be considered serious. W hen in doubt as to whether 
‘hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543]’ occurred, or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
d. Results in disability/incapacity  
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include 
experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated 
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrh ea, influenza -like illness, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent  everyday life functions but 
do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the o ffspring of a study participant.

212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  136 f. Other situations  
Medical or scientific judg ment  should be exercised in deciding whether reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498998]. These should also 
be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home fo r allergic bronchospasm, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543].  
10.3.3.  Solicited events  
a. Solicited administration  site events  
The following administration site events will be solicited  from participants in the 
reactogenicity and im munogenicity subset : 
Table 33 Solicited administration site  events  
Pain  
Erythema  
Swelling  
b. Solicited systemic  events  
The following systemic events  will be solicited  from participants in the reactogenicity 
and immunogenicity subset : 
Table 34 Solicited systemic events  
Fever  
Headache  
Fatigue  
Myalgia

Note: Participants  will be instructed to measure and record the oral , axillary or tympanic  
body temperature in the evening. Should additional temperature measurements be 
performed at other times of day, participants  will be instructed to record the highest 
temperature in the paper diary card . 
10.3.4.  Unsolicited  adverse events  
An unsolicited AE is an adverse event that was not solicited and that was spontaneously 
communicated by a participant  who has signed the informed consent. Unsolicited AEs 
include serious and non -serious AEs.  
Potential unsolicited AEs may be medically attended (i.e., sympto ms or illnesses 
requiring a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543], or emergency room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider). 
The participants will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_499121]

are of participant concern. Detailed information about reported unsolicited AEs will be 
collected by [CONTACT_14348]’s records.  
Unsolicited AEs that are not medically attended nor perce ived as a concern by [CONTACT_499122].  
10.3.5.  Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)   
Adverse events of special  interest (AESIs)  collected during this study include potential 
immune -mediated diseases (pI[INVESTIGATOR_159170] ) and AF. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Potential immune -mediated diseases   
pI[INVESTIGATOR_163510] a subset of AESIs that include autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory 
and/or neurologic disorders of interest which may or may not have an autoimmune 
etiology . AEs that need to be recorded and reported as pI[INVESTIGATOR_498999] 35 (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for reporting details).  
However, the investigator will exercise his/her medical and scientific judg ment  to 
determine whether other diseases have an autoimmune origin (i.e. , pathophysiology 
involving systemic or organ -specific pathogenic autoantibodies) and should also be 
recorded as a pIM D.

Event  Intensity grade  Parameter  
Pain at the injection site  0 None  
 1 Mild: Any pain neither interfering with nor preventing 
normal every  day activities  
 2 Moderate: Painful when limb is moved and interferes with

day activities  
Erythema  at the injection site Record greatest surface diameter in mm  
Swelling at the injection site  Record greatest surface diameter in mm  
Temperature*   Record temperature in °C/°F  
Headache  0 Normal

* Fever is defined as a temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F by [CONTACT_28414].  The route for measuring temperature can be oral, 
axillary or tympanic . 
The maximum intensity of local injection site erythema/swelling and fever will be scored 
at [COMPANY_004] as follows:  
Intensity grade  Erythema/Swelling  Fever  
0  20 mm  < 38.0°C (100.4°F)  
1 > 20 -  50 mm  ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) -  38.5°C (101.3°F)  
2 > 50 -  100 mm  > 38.5°C (101.3°F) -  39.0°C (102.2°F)  
3 > 100 mm  > 39.0°C (102.2°F)  
The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the study. The assessment 
will be based on the investigator’s clinical judg ment . 
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  146 The intensity should be assigned to 1 of the following categories:  
1 (mild)  = An AE which is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing 
minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
2 (moderate)  = An AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
normal everyday activities.  
3 (severe)  = An AE which prevents normal, everyday activities  
(In adults, such an AE w ould, for example, prevent attendance at 
work and would necessitate the administration of corrective 
therapy.)  
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with an SAE. Grade 3 
is a category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets 1 of the pre -defined 
outcomes as described in the Section  10.3.2 . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of causality  
The investigator must assess the relationship between the study vaccine  and the 
occurrence of each unsolicited AE/SAE using clinical judg ment . Where several different 
vaccines/products were administered, the investigator should specify, when possible, if 
the unsolicited AE/SAE could be causally related to a specific vaccine/product (i.e. , 
investigational, control/placebo or co -administered vaccine). When causal relationship to 
a specific vaccine/product  cannot  be determined, the investigator should indicate the 
unsolicited AE/SAE to be related to all products.  
Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study vaccine  will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the 
IB to determine his/her assessment.  
Causality should be assessed by [CONTACT_163586]:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the unsolicited AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_106957]?  
YES  : There is a reasonable possibility that the study vaccine  contributed to 
the AE.  
NO : There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally related to the 
administrat ion of the study vaccine. There are other, more likely causes , 
and administration of the study vaccine  is not suspected to have 
contributed to the AE.  
If an event meets the criteria to be determined as ‘serious’ (see Section  10.3.2 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed by [CONTACT_227274].  
Possible contributing factors include:  
• Medical history.

• Erroneous administration.  
• Other cause (specify).  
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred , and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004]. However, it is very important to 
record an assessment of causality for every event before submitting the Expedited 
Adverse Events Report to [COMPANY_004].  
The causality assessment  is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements. The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_227222].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Medically attended visits  
For each solicited event and unsolicited AE the participant experiences, the participant  
will be asked if he/she received medical attention defined as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543], or an 
otherwise unscheduled visit to or from medical personnel for any reason, including  
emergency room visits. This information will be recorded in the eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of outcomes  
The investigator will assess the outcome of all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) 
recorded during the study as:  
• Recovered/resolved.  
• Recovering/resolving.  
• Not recov ered/not resolved.  
• Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae.

10.4.3.  Republic of Korea  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Study participants exclusion criteria for enrollment   
Per local Regulation on Approval for Enforcement Regulation on the Safety of 
Pharmaceuticals, etc., Article 24 paragraph 2, a study participant cannot be enrolled in a 
trial if he or she has “participated as a subject in a clinical trial targeting healthy people 
within the last 6 months.”  
Therefore, in order to comply with this local requirement, investigators from Republic of 
Korea should carefully check, before enrolling each participant in the study, that they 
have not participated in any other clinical study targeting healthy people within the last 
6 months prior to enrollment/first study vaccination.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Safety monitoring   
In addition, the following points  should be noted  concerning  safety monitoring : 
• No safety “holding rules” or criteria for pausing or ear ly termination have been 
defined for this study.  
• An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) has been put in place and will 
be in charge of reviewing unblinded safety data on an agreed schedule.  
• It will be at the IDMC discretion to recommend, if deemed  necessary, that the study 
recruitment is paused or terminated based on their unblinded data reviews.  
• In addition to the IDMC reviews, [COMPANY_004]’s SRT will perform regular  reviews of 
blinded data and may request  the IDMC to perform ad -hoc unblinded reviews if an y 
potential safety  concern is suspected based on blinded data.  As of the 
implementation of Protocol Amendment 4, SRT will review unblinded safety data.

Adverse event:  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation participant, temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product.  
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavo rable  and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
sympt om, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed 
medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce 
expected benefits (i.e. , lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.  
Adverse event of 
special interest:  An adverse event of special  interest (serious or non -serious) 
is one of scientific and medical concern specific to the

Depending on the nature of the event, rapid communication 
by [CONTACT_50459] (e.g., regulators) might 
also be warranted.  
Blinding:  A procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are 
kept unaware of the intervention assignment in order to 
reduce the risk of biased study outcomes. The level of 
blinding is maintained throughout the conduct of the trial, 
and only when the data are cleaned to an acceptable level of 
quality will appropriate personnel be unblinded or when 
required in case of a serious adverse event . 
In an observer -blind study, the participant, the site and 
sponsor personnel involved in the clinical evaluation of the 
participants are blinded while other study personnel may be 
aware of the intervention  assignment.  
Caregiver:  A ‘caregiver’ is a person w ho has a continuous caring role

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_642172] RSV -associated (subtypes A and B) disease in adults ≥ 60 YOA .  
The purpose of the current study is to demo nstrate the efficacy of the RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine in the prevention of RT -PCR -confirmed LRTD caused by [CONTACT_4510] A 
and/or B in adults ≥ [ADDRESS_642173] RT -PCR -
confirmed LRTD caused by [CONTACT_499024] (hMPV) will also be evaluated.  In 
addition, the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine will be assessed after each dose.  
Section 2.2. Background  
At the time of initiation of this study, There is currently  no vaccine or nor other 
prophylactic treatment was available against RSV or hMPV in older adults. Since then, 
[COMPANY_004]’s RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine was first approved for use in an adults ≥  
60 YOA in the US on 3 May 2023, followed by [CONTACT_499031] 6 June 2023  
Currently available treatment for RSV and hMPV infections in this age group is generally 
supportive in nature.  
Section 2.3.2.  Benefit assessment  
At the start of this study, the eff icacy of the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine was 
not demonstrated yet. Hence it was unknown if  tThe participants receiving the 
RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine may not directly  would  benefit from this 
vaccination because the vaccine efficacy (VE) has not been assessed yet . Since then, the  
efficacy of RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine was demonstrated and the study 
primary confirmatory objective was met.  One dose of RSVPreF3 OA vaccine has 
shown a favorable benefit/risk profile.  The vaccine was ap proved for use in an adults 
≥ 60 YOA in the US on 3 May 2023, followed by [CONTACT_499031] 6 June 2023.

12 July 2023  184 Section 4.2. Scientific rationale for study design  
The study is designed as a Phase 3, observer -blind, placebo -controlled study enrolling 
adults ≥ ³ [ADDRESS_642200] -Dose 2 were 
consistent with previous results from the Phase 3 program.  
Based on this observation , the study design was modified to remove the next annual 
revaccination dose of study vaccine (Dose 3 pre -Season 3) in the NH. The clinical 
development program will continue to evaluate longer term follow -up and the optimal 
timing for revaccination.  
Section 4.2.2.  Rationale for the use of placebo  
As there is was currently  no licensed RSV vaccine available at the time of  initiation of  
this study , a placebo group (receiving saline solution) is will be used as control for the 
efficacy, safety/reactogenicity and immunogenicity assessments.  
Section 6.1. Study interventions administered  
After completing all prerequisite procedures prior to vaccination, one dose of study 
vaccine will be prepared and adminis tered as shown in Table 10 for Dose 1 and Table 11 
for the annual revaccination doses . Refer to Section 4.1 for the schedule of vaccine 
administration.  
For the annual revaccination doses : 
The RSV_annual group will receive an additional dose of RSVPreF3 OA vaccine before 
each subsequent RSV season  while the RSV_1dose and Placebo groups will receive 1 
dose of placebo at the same timepoints *. Refer to Section 4.1 for details on the study 
design.  
* Participants in the NH who will have their Visit 5NH after  the approval  of the

12 July 2023  191 Section 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1.2.  Secondary objectives  
• To demonstrate the efficacy of a single dose of RSVPreF3 OA investigational 
vaccine followed by 1 annual revaccination s before Season 2  in the prevention of 
RSV -confirmed LRTD in adults ≥ 60 YOA over several seasons.  
Criterion: The LL of the 2 -sided CI for VE is above 20%.  
• To demonstrate the efficacy of a single dose and 1 annual revaccination  before 
Season 2  doses  of RSVPreF3 OA investig ational vaccine in the prevention of RSV -
confirmed LRTD for each RSV subtype (A and B) separately in adults ≥ 60 YOA 
over 3 seasons.  
Criterion: The LL of the 2 -sided CI for VE is above 0%.  
VE of the 1 annual revaccination given before Season 2  over 2 and 3  seasons:  
• The confirmatory secondary objective assessing VE of the annual revaccination 
given before Season 2  with RSVPreF3 OA vaccine in the prevention of RSV -
confirmed LRTD in adults ≥  60 years after Season 2 in NH (S1+A2NH) will be 
evaluated conditional ly to the success of the previous objective evaluating VE after 
Season 1 in NH (see Figure 4). A Bonferroni adjustment of alpha for multiplicity 
will be applied. Therefore, this analysis will be done using a [ADDRESS_642217] at 
alpha=1.25% level.  
• The confirmat ory secondary objective assessing VE of an the annual revaccination 
given before Season 2  with RSVPreF3 OA vaccine in the prevention of RSV -
confirmed LRTD in adults ≥  60 years after Season 3 in NH (S1+A2+A3NH) will be 
evaluated conditionally to the success  of the annual revaccination objective after 
Season 2 (see Figure 4). This analysis will be done using a [ADDRESS_642218] at 
alpha=1.25% level.  
• The confirmatory secondary objective assessing VE of an the annual revaccination 
given before Season 2  with RSVPreF3  OA vaccine in the prevention of RSV -
confirmed LRTD for each RSV subtype (A and B) separately  in adults ≥  60 years 
after Season 3 in NH (S1+A2+A3NH) will be evaluated conditionally to the success 
of the RSV objective of annual revaccination after Season 3 (see Figure 4).  
Analysis will be case -driven and will be performed if at least 49 cases are accrued 
for each subtype (RSV A and RSV B). The RSV A objective will be tested first, and 
if demonstrated, the RSV B objective will also be tested (see Figure 4).  
Note that participants who received a third dose of RSVPreF3 OA investigational 
vaccine will not be included in the evaluation of annual revaccination over 3 seasons.

randomized,  
− have data available for efficacy endpoint measures,  
− did not have protocol deviations leading to exclusion.  
Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Efficacy  
The same methodology as described for the primary endpoint (see Section 9.4.3) will be 
used to analyze the secondary efficacy endpoints described below. For the analysis over 2 
or 3 seasons (VE Analysis 3 and 4) , the model will include season as covariate,  in 
addition to age category and region. The first occurrence of the event meeting the case 
definition according to the endpoint will be considered for the primary analysis of those 
secondary efficacy endpoints.  
The following endpoints will be evaluated following a single dose of the RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine and following [ADDRESS_642223] dose of RSVPreF3 OA investigational 
vaccine will not be included in the primary evaluation of annual revaccination over 3 
seasons. Secondary analysis of the annual revaccination on participants who received 
3 doses of RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine might be performed depending on the 
number of participants who will receive the Do se 3. Details will be provided in the SAP.  
Other secondary objectives

Study Protocol  
 
Background  
 
Decreasing inappropriate utilization of the Emergency Department (ED) is a priority for the 
Geisinger health system. ED visits may be avoided if patients first call the system to get 
appropriate guidance  for their concern s or are otherwise better informed about reasons to visit 
the ED vs. other, potentially more appropriate resources such as urgent care and primary care 
facilities. The study team is working to reduce ED utilization by [CONTACT_668471] (AVSs).  
 
Objectives  
 
The study will involve  A/B testing different AVS versions, including a version that encourages 
patients to contact [CONTACT_668472], a version that includes a map to the 
patient's closest urgent care  location and accompanying information about urgent care , and a 
version that includes a self -triage guide. A standard -practice control group will receive the 
current standard AVS. Analysis results will be assessed to determine which version is most 
effective at reducing ED use.  
 
Design  
 
This study is a randomized controlled trial with 4 study arms. Patients will be randomized to 
receive or not receive a modified AVS after outpatient in -person or telehealth visits.  
 
Methods  
 
At the time of a patient’s first qualifying appointment  during the study period , patients  will be  
randomized  into the following study arms : 
 
1. Standard  practice : Patients in this arm will receive the current standard  practice  AVS.  
2. Contact [CONTACT_668473]:  Patients in this arm will receive the standard AVS, plus information on 
how to contact [CONTACT_668474].  
3. Contact [CONTACT_668473] + urgent care map: Patients in this arm will receive the standard AVS, 
plus information on how to contact [CONTACT_668474], plus a map 
of their nearest Geisinger urgent care location and additional information about urgent 
care.  
4. Contact [CONTACT_668473] + urgent care map + self -triage:  Patients in this arm will receive the 
standard AVS, plus information on how to contact [CONTACT_668475], plus a map of their nearest Geisinger urgent care location and additional 
information about urgent care. This arm will also receive a self -triage chart, with common 
reasons patients go to the ED and situations where seeking alternative care might be 
appropriate.  
 
Sequential Design  
 
We will use a group sequential design  with O’Brien -Flemming alpha spending and beta  
spending (Lakens et al., 2021) , with optional stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16589] . We will perform one interim 
look after collecting data from 109,346 patients (50% of the sample) and the final look after 
 completing data collection with 218,692 patients.  We will stop after the interim look if p < 
.005575 (i.e., a much larger effect than expected) for the contrast between any of the 3 
experimental arms and control in Analysis 1  below. We may also stop for futility if z > -0.192 
(i.e., an effect in the opposite direction to our expectations) for all [ADDRESS_902815] 95% power to detect a  
reduction in avoidable ED use in the 30 days following the appointment from 3. 88% to 3.50% 
(9.80% relative reduction) with one-tailed alpha of .05.  The target effect size and number of 
patients are largely informed by [CONTACT_668476] (approximately 6 months), with an effect deemed useful if achieved.  
 
We next determined that the  inflation factor based on the sequential design described above 
was 1.017 17. We multiplied the inflation factor by [CONTACT_668477] (215,000 * 
1.017 17) for a sample size of 218,692.  
 
Project Status  
 
All patients have been enrolled , but we have not extracted the final outcome data.  
 
We ran an interim analysis  on preliminary  outcome data,  as described  above. Although effect 
sizes met our optional stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_668469] ( zs < -0.192), we decided to keep running the 
study to be able to run all final analyses at full power . 
 
We were unable to turn off the intervention immediately once reaching our target sample size, 
so we exceeded our preregistered sample size. Our fin al analyses will be based on the full list of 
patients enrolled until the intervention stopped. We will also run the primary outcome analyses 
on the subset of patients enrolled through the day we reached the preregistered sample size.  
 
Process for Determining a Patient’s Nearest Urgent Care  
 
A patient’s nearest urgent care will be determined by [CONTACT_668478]’s Electronic 
Health Record.  Zip code locations will be defined as population -weighted centroids (obtained 
from https://hudgis -hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/HUD::zip -code -population -weighted -
centroids/ ) where available. For some zip codes (P.O. Box zip codes in particular), population -
weighted centroids are not available. In those cases, we will use the zip code’s approximate 
centroid obtained from the USPS Zip Code Database ( https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/zip -
code -database/ ). 
 
Distance to the nearest Geisinger urgent care location for each zip code will be calculated using 
the following process:  
 
1. For each zip  code in PA, NY, and NJ (states that are within or sufficiently close to the 
Geisinger service area), we will compute the Haversine distance to each urgent care 
location  
2. For each zip code, we will determine if at least one urgent care location is within 40 
miles of the zip code centroid  
 3. If more than one location is within 40 miles and under a 10 mile difference in distance 
between zip code centroid and each of those two clinic locations  (e.g., if one clinic is [ADDRESS_902816], a 5 mile difference) , we will use  the Google 
Maps API [INVESTIGATOR_668470], we will show a map 
to the closest clinic if  the Haversine distance  is under 40 miles from the centroid  of the patient’s 
zip code.  For patients with zip codes farther than [ADDRESS_902817] urgent care.   
 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
Planned Analyses  
 
Primary Outcome : Inappropriate  ED visits  (y/n) [Time Frame: In the 30 days following the 
appointment]  
 
We will apply the NYU algorithm (Ballard et al., 2010) to determine whether an ED visit is 
inappropriate.   
 
We will use one of the following two methods:  
 
1. Epic tool: Geisinger is working to implement a tool in Epic that can automatically run the 
NYU algorithm and identify inappropriate (or “non -emergent”) ED visits. If this tool is 
running prior to data analysis, we will use it to identify inappropriate ED visits for our 
primary outcome.  
2. Custom code: If the Epic tool is not yet implemented prior to our data analysis, we will 
pull, for each ED visit, the primary ICD code for the visit and use custom code to 
determine whether the visit was inappropriate, following the methods described in 
Ballard et al. (2010)  or the most up -to-date version of the algorithm we have access to at 
the time of data analysis.  
 
Question 1: Do AVSs decrease inappropriate ED visits  when including  information about how 
to contact [CONTACT_668479]?  
 
Analysis 1 (Confirmatory):  We will test the hypothesis that each of the individual modified AVS 
versions  decrease s the likelihood patients will visit the ED  in the 30 days following their visit. We 
will run an OLS regression including  a categorical  predictor variable coding for experimental arm  
(0 = standard  practice  arm, 1 = contact [CONTACT_668480], 2 = c ontact us first + urgent care  arm, 3 = 
contact [CONTACT_668473] + urgent care map  + self -triage arm ).  
 
Question 2:  Do AVSs decrease ED visits when including  an urgent care map , beyond  modified 
AVS version without an urgent care map?  
 
Analysis 2 (Exploratory):  We will run an OLS regression including only experimental arms with 
modified AVSs. We will include a predictor variable indic ating whether each patient’s AVS 
version includes a map (0 = no map, contact [CONTACT_668480]; 1 = map, contact [CONTACT_668473] + urgent care 
map arm and contact [CONTACT_668473] + urgent care map  + self -triage  arm). 
 
 Question 3:  Do AVSs decrease ED visits when including  a self -triage tool , beyond  modified 
AVS versions without a self -triage tool?  
 
Analysis 3 (Exploratory):  We will run an OLS regression including only experimental arms with 
modified AVSs. We will include a predictor variable indic ating whether each patient’s AVS 
version includes a self-triage  chart (0 = no self-triage chart – contact [CONTACT_668481] + urgent care map  arm; 1 = self-triage chart  – contact [CONTACT_668473] + urgent care map  + self -
triage arm).  
 
 
 
 
Covariates  
 
Because the ultimate call to action (seeking care outside the ED) is likely to depend on proximity 
to the ED and alternate care options, all the regressions described above  will include as 
covariates the driving distance in miles to the closest Geisinger ED and the driving distance in 
miles to the closest Geisinger urgent care location.  Specifically, covariates will reflect the 
distance from the closest Geisinger ED and closest Geisinger urgent care location of the 
patient’s zip code in the Geisinger electr onic health records. Distances between each enrolled 
patient’s zip code centroid and ED/urgent care locations will be computed using the same 
process described above in the section Process for Determining a Patient’s Nearest Urgent 
Care , with the added step of computing the driving distance in miles  for each zip code.   
 
Prim ary Analysis Sample  
 
Analysis will be limited to patients who , at the time of enrollment,  lived close enough to an 
urgent care location to be shown a map to a specific Geisinger urgent care location (i.e., those 
who lived within 40 miles , using the Haversine method , of a Geisinger  urgent care clinic ). We 
estimate that over 98% of patients will  be included in this primary analysis.  We will  also run a 
sensitivity analysis that includes  all patients.  
 
Other  Pre-specified Outcomes  
 
We will run the analyses described above on the following additional outcomes:  
 
1. Urgent care visits  
 
Visited urgent care (y/n)  
 
[Time Frame: In the 30 days following the appointment]  
 
2. Calls  
 
Called Geisinger  (y/n) 
 
[Time Frame: In the 30 days following the appointment]  
 
3. Patient portal messages  
 
Sent a patient portal message  (y/n) 
  
[Time Frame: In the 30 days following the appointment]  
 
 
 
Analysis Notes  
 
Recent work suggests that OLS regressions are appropriate in randomized experiments with 
binary outcome variables such as ours (Gomila, 2021).  
 
In addition to the analyses described above, we may run sensitivity analyses such as using 
count or continuous variables instead of dichotomized variables.  
 
An exploratory analysis will test whether any of the experimental arms perform better than 
baseline, using a dichotomous predictor variable (0 = standard  practice , 1 = any modified AVS).  
 
Finally, we plan to run exploratory analyses to understand heterogeneity in observed effects 
(e.g., in covariates such as age, sex, race , or frequency of exposure to the AVS ).

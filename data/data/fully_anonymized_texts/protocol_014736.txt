62. BACKGROUND
2.1 Study Agent(s):  Proton Radiotherapy
The current focus in radiation oncology is to improve dose localization to the tumor.  
Techniques such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy and Tomotherapy are two 
sophisticated photon techniques that have helped improve outcome in patients, however, 
there still remains a large amount of normal tissue getting low and intermediate doses of 
radiation.   Proton radiation capi[INVESTIGATOR_407250]. Unlike photon 
radiation which entails both an entrance and exit dose to normal tissues in the process of 
treating a tumor in a given beam line, proton radiation only entails a somewhat lower 
entrance dose and eliminates exit dose to normal tissues. Proton therapy dose distributions 
are therefore superior to those of photon therapy by a factor of 2 or greater and this provides 
the potential to further improve clinical outcomes and specifically decrease toxicity 
associated with treatment. 
2.1.1 The Advantages of Protons for Delivery of Conformal Therapy
Characteristics of Proton Beams
Figure O-1. Proton (Bragg peak and modulated peak) and [ADDRESS_513569] a finite range dependent upon 
the initial proton energy. Therefore, the depth dose characteristics of the two beams are 
qualitatively different (see Figure O-1). Protons lose their energy in tissue mostly by 
[CONTACT_407297]; however, a small fraction 
of energy is transferred through nuclear collisions. The energy loss per unit path length is 
relatively small and constant as the proton traverses the tissue until near the end of the 
proton range where the residual energy is lost over a short distance (approximately 0.7 
cm in width at 80% of the maximum dose) and the proton comes to rest, resulting in a

7distinctive sharp rise in the tissue absorbed dose (energy absorbed per unit mass) - known 
as the Bragg peak (see the curve labeled "unmodulated proton beam" in Figure O-1). In 
physical terms, the magnitude of the transfer of energy to tissue per unit path length 
traversed by [CONTACT_407298]. The 
low dose region between the entrance and the Bragg peak is called the plateau of the dose 
distribution and the dose there is 30-[ADDRESS_513570] of targets, 
ablation of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_317964]. For the irradiation of larger targets/tumors the 
beam energy is modulated - several beams of closely spaced energies (ranges) are 
superimposed to create a region of uniform dose over the depth of the target. These 
extended regions of uniform dose are called "spread-out Bragg peaks" (SOBP). This is 
shown in Figure O-1 as the “modulated proton beam”. 
For comparison, Figure O-[ADDRESS_513571] isocentric gantries and sophisticated beam

directions and complex delivery techniques such as intensity modulation. 
2.2 Study Disease 
Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) are small hypercellular, round, blue cell tumors of 
embryonal origin arising from the subependymal zone of the central nervous system (CNS) 
[1].  Medulloblastoma (MB) and pi[INVESTIGATOR_99185] (PB) are defined as PNET of the posterior 
fossa or pi[INVESTIGATOR_407251]. These tumors tend to occur predominately in the pediatric 
population.  MB and PB account for ~25% of CNS tumors in children. They have a 
propensity to spread to other regions of the CNS by [CONTACT_407299]. Deutsch reported 
46% incidence of CNS spread at presentation for pediatric MB [2].  Likewise, a 30% rate of 
positive neuraxis involvement was observed by [CONTACT_407300] [3].  Thus, approximately one-
third of these patients present as high risk medulloblastoma and two-thirds as standard risk.
2.3 Rationale
The treatment of MB and PB of the central nervous system involves a multi-disciplinary 
approach. Surgery is necessary to obtain histological confirmation and to obtain maximal 
resection of tumor when feasible as the degree of resection correlates with outcome [4].  
Patients are at risk for local and disseminated CNS recurrence even after gross total 
resection. Adjuvant therapy to the craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_407252]. Craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_407253] (CSI) is used in this setting for patients greater than [ADDRESS_513573] risk for recurrence.
Photon CSI is associated with many possible acute and long-term sequelae:
Acute toxicity can include the following: bone marrow myelosuppression, fatigue, alopecia, 
headache, dermatitis, folliculitis, otitis externa, otitis media, anorexia, weight loss, nausea, 
vomiting, thrush, laryngitis, pharyngitis, esophagitis, gastritis, enteritis, cystitis, acute 
pericarditis, and temporary worsening of tumor associated neurological symptoms.  
Prolonged myelosuppression and decreased bone marrow reserve may limit the ability to 
give chemotherapy after CSI.  Somnolence syndrome is a subacute reaction associated with 
CSI often disabling the patient.  
Long-term complications typi[INVESTIGATOR_95469] [ADDRESS_513574] formation, retinopathy, 
sensorineural hearing loss due to damage to cochlea apparatus in inner ear, neuroendocrine 
dysfunction, and neuro-cognitive sequelae, rarely, necrosis and associated persistent 
vasogenic edema or atrophy. Adverse long term effects from photon irradiation of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_407254]: induction of second malignancy, stunting of growth of vertebral bodies and 
hypoplasia of paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_407255], kyphosis and 
decreased stature, spi[INVESTIGATOR_407256], primary hypothyroidism, 
cardiomyopathy, pneumonitis, peptic ulcer disease, small and large bowel enteritis, primary 
ovarian failure, and decreased marrow reserve.  These long-term sequelae can have

Outcomes, T. Yock, MD
7/20/18
9devastating effects in children on their future development and quality of life. Some of these 
complications are described in further detail below.  
Ototoxicity:
Conductive hearing loss due to serous otitis media is a well-known acute reaction to RT and 
stems from mucositis causing blockage of Eustachian tube with transudation of serous fluid.  
Patients are at increased risk at doses > [ADDRESS_513575] cases resolve spontaneously.  
Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) caused by [CONTACT_407301] a 
late complication from RT and can result in permanent hearing loss. While high doses of 
radiation are needed in the absence of chemotherapy to invoke SNHL [5-6], it can occur with 
lower radiation doses when ototoxic platinum chemotherapy agents are used. Evidence exists 
suggesting a dose response. Schoenthlaer et al reviewed 25 patients treated with high dose 
proton beam RT for base of skull tumors.  Six patients developed decreased hearing acuity as 
a late complication.  All patients with hearing loss received more than 60 cobalt gray 
equivalent (CGE) to at least 50% of the cochlea and auditory nerve [5]. In contradistinction, 
no patient receiving less than 60 CGE had hearing loss. Grai et al observed a higher 
incidence of severe SNHL in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients receiving > 50 Gy to the 
inner ear compared to < 50 Gy [6]. Thibadoux et al found no hearing deficits in children 
receiving prophylactic cranial irradiation for acute lymphocytic leukemia [7].  Patients 
received [ADDRESS_513576] of cochlear dose on 
sensorineural hearing loss in children with brain tumors treated with conformal radiation 
therapy and no ototoxic chemotherapy. They found that there is significant correlation 
between radiation dose and the incidence of sensorineural hearing loss in children. Children 
with a cochlear mean dose of 30 Gy or less had a low incidence of hearing loss, while there 
was an increased risk at greater than 40-45 Gy [8]. 
Chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin and carboplatin can cause high frequency SNHL.  
Recent data suggests that the combination of chemotherapy (CTx) and RT can cause more 
serious ototoxicity. Packer et al from UCSF reviewed their pediatric MB patients treated with 
concurrent vincristine plus CSI followed by [CONTACT_407302], CCNU and vincristine.  They 
found 47.6% of patients developed grade 3 to 4 ototoxicity [9]. Twenty six MB pediatric 
patients treated at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) with cisplatin and vincristine 
followed by [CONTACT_57857].  Only 19% of patients had normal hearing and 50% of long term survivors 
required hearing aids [10].  Degree of hearing loss was inversely related to age.  Sequencing 
of CTx and RT may also play a role in ototoxicity [11].       
Neurocognitive toxicity:
Although the majority of CNS development occurs during the 1st [ADDRESS_513577] received whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) for conditions including 
medulloblastoma, leukemia and other brain tumors [12]. The decline in functioning can be 
significant often necessitating placement in special education and a variety of therapeutic 
interventions. The effect of radiation depends upon the age of the child, with younger

treatment profile for children receiving WBRT.  
IQ deficits following cranial irradiation range from 17 to 50%.  The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_133445] (CHOP) experience with cerebellar astrocytoma in children compared WBRT in 
26 patients versus no RT in 21 patients. IQ declined by a median of 13 points in the 
irradiated group versus none in the observed group [13]. The volume of brain irradiated 
influences worsening of intellectual performance. Hoppe-Hirsch et al compared 59 children 
with MB who received WBRT to 37 children who received posterior fossa RT for 
ependymoma [14].  60% of children with posterior fossa only irradiation preserved an IQ > 
90 at 10 years of follow up. Conversely, only 10% with WBRT maintained an IQ > 90.  
Radiation dose also plays a role.  Silber et al observed a higher drop in IQ below standard as 
dose of WBRT increased from 18 to > 36 Gy [15]. A study from Institut Gustave Roussy 
compared the neurocognitive outcome in [ADDRESS_513579] [16]. Increasing radiation doses to 
the brain were found to be correlated with lower full-scale IQ scores with mean IQ scores of 
84.5, 76.9 and 63.7 for patients who had received 0 Gy, 25 Gy and 35 Gy to the non-PF 
brain. The Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) and Children’s Cancer Group (CCG) have also 
compared reduced dose CSI at 23.[ADDRESS_513580] 36 Gy dose in low stage pediatric 
MB patients.  Chemotherapy was not used. A reduction in neuropsychologic toxicity was 
observed in the low dose arm especially in younger children [17], albeit with a higher local 
failure rate in the reduced CSI arm [18]. Packer et al compared 13 patients treated with 
WBRT plus cisplatin, CCNU, or vincristine versus 14 patients treated with surgery only for 
children with cerebellar astrocytoma [19]. WBRT dose was [ADDRESS_513581] of 18-20 Gy 
for children 3 years or older. A decline in full-scale IQ was noted in the irradiated group.  
12/[ADDRESS_513582] studied population is the ALL (acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia) population in which many children are never irradiated but still suffer 
neurocognitive effects. (Moleski, M. (2002) Neuropsychological, neuroanatomical, and 
neurophsyiological consequences of CNS chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 
Archives of Clinical Neuropyschology, 15, 603-630). Methotrexate, both high dose and 
intrathecal or intraventricular have been shown to cause leukoencephalopathy without 
radiation, but the addition of radiation appears to worsen outcome (Rutkowski et al, NEJM 
352: 2005). However, the use of methotrexate chemotherapy in high doses does appear to 
improve disease free survival compared with standard regimens in infants and young children 
(Rutkowski et al, NEJM 352: 978-986, 2005; Chi et al, JCO 22: 2004) with medulloblastoma 
Phase II Study of Proton RT for Medulloblastoma and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_99185]: Acute Toxicity and Long Term 
Outcomes, T. Yock, MD
7/20/18
11and is increasingly gaining favor in the children with the higher risk disease. The other 
promising strategy is to deliver high dose chemotherapy with thiotepa and carboplatin with 
stem cell support and both treatment intensification strategies are employed in various 
institutions and cooperative group settings around the country and world.
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_407257]:
Neuroendocrine dysfunction is extremely common following cranial irradiation in children 
and adults.  Published data indicates a radiation dose response [20-22]. Littley et al showed 
that doses as low as 20 Gy to the hypothalamus and pi[INVESTIGATOR_407258], primarily anterior lobe dysfunction [21]. Doses exceeding 50 CGE to the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_407259] [22]. Growth hormone deficiency is particularly common following cranial 
irradiation.  Hypogonadism, hypoadrenalism and hypothyroidism can also be observed.  
Patients often have more than one hormone axis involved. Life long monitoring for 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_407260].  
Precocious puberty has been described in pre-pubertal patients treated with cranial irradiation 
[23]. The critical dose for precocious puberty is not well elucidated.
Thyroid gland toxicity:
Primary hypothyroidism after photon beam spi[INVESTIGATOR_407261].  
59% of patients developed elevated levels of TSH after spi[INVESTIGATOR_407262] a study by [CONTACT_407303] [24]. A strong correlation between dose and incidence of hypothyroidism has also been 
demonstrated [24-26]. An incidence of 15% is noted for doses below 30 Gy; this increases to 
40-90% for doses between 30 to 44 Gy [27]. For children, a study from Stanford University 
showed an incidence of 17% for doses < 26 Gy to the thyroid gland and 78% for > 26 Gy 
[25]. Radiation to the thyroid gland can also cause hyperthyroidism, although this is an 
uncommon event with a 10 year actuarial risk of < 3.5% [28]. Patients usually present with 
symptoms of Graves’ ophthalmopathy.  
Potential Benefits of Protons:
Benefits of spi[INVESTIGATOR_33067]:
When a proton beam is applied for spi[INVESTIGATOR_25360], a single posteriorly directed proton 
beam delivers almost no dose to structures anterior to the treated volume compared to a 
standard photon treatment plan and even an IMRT plan. As shown in Figure O-2 (above), a 
direct comparison of a conventional [ADDRESS_513583] 
PA 4 MV photon plan. A comparative treatment plan of protons versus photons has also been 
published by [CONTACT_407304] [29]. A 6 MV photon beam spi[INVESTIGATOR_407263]

12Benefits in cranial technique:
In a separate study, the same investigators were able to demonstrate advantages of a 3 field 
(2 opposed lateral and a posterior) proton plan for whole brain irradiation in a 3 year old 
child over parallel opposed 6 MV photon fields, 6 field conformal photon plan, or a 9 field 
IMRT photon plan [30].  A reduction in dose to the eyes and “low risk” regions of the brain 
was observed.  The estimated risk of an IQ score < [ADDRESS_513584] lateral opposed photon plan and achieved similar benefit in improved dose 
distribution as noted by [CONTACT_407306]. See figure O-3 below. The dose gradient is improved 
near the vertex of the head and decrease dose is delivered to the middle and inner ear regions 
using protons.  
Figure O-3: Dose distribution to cranial fields in the Proton and Photon planned patient.
Furthermore, we have refined our technique and use slightly posterior obliqued fields to 
better spare the lens while still achieving good coverage of the cribiform plate in the younger 
patients whose sinuses have not pneumatized yet and the brain therefore dips low and in 
between the orbits. Parallel opposed photon treatment places the child at high risk for 
cataract formation [31].
We have also demonstrated reduced normal tissue irradiation using protons for the posterior 
fossa boost field for medulloblastoma patients. A comparison between a conformal proton 
plan using 15 degree superior anterior oblique field with two 25 degree posterior oblique 
fields is compared to a comparable field set-up with conformal photons as described by 
[CONTACT_407307] [32], and to a standard lateral opposed 4 MV photon plan. As shown in table 1, 
a decrease in relative dose to the critical structures such as the cochlea, non-posterior fossa

13brain, pi[INVESTIGATOR_407265]. However, extra dose is delivered to “less 
critical” normal structures such as the parotid gland and mandible using conformal photons 
as compared to conformal protons.

Protons summary:
Superior dose conformity is therefore achieved with protons compared to other external beam 
modalities. Advantages in dose distribution are noted for all phases of CSI including spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], 
whole brain and posterior fossa portions of treatment. The accuracy of delivering proton 
therapy is further enhanced by [CONTACT_407308].  
Improved radiological imaging with CT and MRI, the availability of computer technology 
for treatment planning and dosimetric calculations (e.g. beam’s eye view planning, 3-
dimensional image reconstruction, dose volume histogram analysis) have contributed to 
enhancing the therapeutic ratio using radiation therapy. In other tumors and sites, 
comparative treatment planning using protons versus photons have shown a clear advantage 
to protons [33-35].  
We have already treated [ADDRESS_513585] found the following: acute 
esophagitis/mucositis rates are 12% which is lower than what would be expected which is 
close to 100% percent. Nausea and vomiting is still present but less severe than it would be 
for photon techniques in that we have a grade 2 rate of 26% and grade 3 rate of 12%.  With 
regards to ototoxicity, since this is a late endpoint (after 3 years) we don’t have full data yet 
but preliminary data shows that we have 35% grade 2 hearing loss and a 9% grade [ADDRESS_513586] risk group and 1 in the high risk 
cohort. Disease control rates are comparable to those with photons. For the neuropsych

4. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES
4.1 General Guidelines for DF/HCC and DF/PCC Institutions
Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System 
(CTMS) OnCore. Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of protocol therapy. Any 
participant not registered to the protocol before protocol therapy begins will be considered 
ineligible and registration will be denied.
A member of the study team will confirm eligibility criteria and complete the protocol-
specific eligibility checklist. 
Following registration, participants may begin protocol treatment. Issues that would cause 
treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator. If a participant does not 
receive protocol therapy following registration, the participant’s protocol status must be 
canceled. Registration cancellations must be made in OnCore as soon as possible.
4.2 Registration Process for DF/HCC and DF/PCC Institutions
DF/HCC Standard Operating Procedure for Human Subject Research Titled Subject Protocol 
Registration (SOP #: REGIST-101) must be followed.  
4.3 Registration Process for Other Participating Institutions
Eligible participants will be entered on study centrally by [CONTACT_407309].  
Please refer to Section 5.7 of the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (attached as Appendix A) 
for details. If a participant does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the 
participant’s registration on the study must be canceled. The Coordinating Center should be 
notified of cancellations as soon as possible
5. TREATMENT PLAN: RADIATION THERAPY
All charged particle treatment will be given at the Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center or 
MD Anderson Proton Therapy Center. Film or digital images will be taken prior to each 
treatment in accordance with the proton center's standard practice for all patients. These

16images are used to verify the position of the patient and the aperture. These images are 
permanently stored electronically for each patient. Treatment may start any day of the week 
but preferably Monday through Thursday. Expected toxicities and potential risks as well as 
dose modifications are described in Section 6 (Expected Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose 
Modifications). Patients with MB will be stratified into standard and high risk for treatment 
purposes.  Physicians are strongly encouraged to enroll patients onto other active protocols.  
Children’s Oncology Group (COG) has specifically designed their protocols to allow for 
proton radiation which will therefore not preclude co-enrollment.
Documentation of chemotherapy given should be submitted.  In order to assess the causes of 
any possible acute or long term side effects, the total platinum dose given to the patient 
should be tracked. The cumulative platinum dose, number of cycles, and any dose reductions 
should be recorded.
5.1 Pre-Treatment Criteria
5.1.1 Baseline Staging Requirements:
MRI scan with contrast enhancement (with gadolinium) of the entire spi[INVESTIGATOR_407266] (preferably pre-op) 
Pre-operative MRI scan or CT scan of the brain. 
Post-operative MRI of the brain (within 21 days of surgery, preferably 
within 72 hours of surgery; intra-operative MRI is allowed). 
CSF sampling for cytology if the patient appears to have M0 disease. CSF 
sampling is not required for patients with gross M2 or M3 disease by 
[CONTACT_9661] (leptomeningeal spread of disease in the brain or the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). CSF 
sampling can be completed any time prior to the start of protocol therapy. 
If sampling for M0 disease performed less than [ADDRESS_513591] be completed no later 
than ten days after the start of radiation.
5.1.2 Additional Baseline Assessments:
Endocrine evaluation to be completed no later than 2 months after the start 
of radiation. To include TSH, Free T4, Cortisol, IGF-1 and IGF-BP3, LH, 
FSH, estradiol (females), testosterone (males) (am levels preferred), 
Tanner Stage assessed by [CONTACT_117145], bone age (plain film of the 
wrist), and body proportion measurements. Bone age, Tanner Stage 
assessment, and body proportion measurements collected will be at the 
discretion of the study endocrinologist. Recommended measurements 
include sitting height (sitting height preferred, but pubic symphysis to 
floor acceptable), standing height, leg span, and arm span.
Audiogram, to be completed no later than 2 months after the start of 
radiation.

17Neurocognitive evaluation, as detailed in Section 9.2.3, to be completed 
no later than [ADDRESS_513592] scan and may 
be either prone or supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. For CSI, patient will be positioned in accordance with the 
treating institution’s accepted method of doing so. Head will be positioned such that the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_407267]. Children unable to cooperate and remain properly 
immobilized should be sedated or anesthetized for set-up reliability on a day-to-day basis.  
A nurse anesthetist or anesthesiologist will be supervising and administrating sedation.  
Sedated patients should be under constant surveillance during treatments with cameras, 
telemetry, and other devices.
5.2.[ADDRESS_513593] outline the GTV. Cumulative dose volume histogram analysis 
will be completed for structures listed below:
GTVp and surgical bed (see below for guidelines definitions)
CTV1 and CTV2 (+/- CTV x…) 
Right and left cochlea
Lenses
Optic chiasm
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_304]
Hypothalamus
Esophagus
Temporal lobes
Whole brain
ICRU 50 and ICRU 78 [37] recommended terminology will be used to define radiation 
treatment parameters. 
CTV1: Cranial-Spi[INVESTIGATOR_407268]: 
CTV1 shall be defined as the cranial spi[INVESTIGATOR_407269]. Care should be taken to look at the sagittal spi[INVESTIGATOR_407270]: Acute Toxicity and Long Term 
Outcomes, T. Yock, MD
7/20/[ADDRESS_513594] a significant 
amount of growth to do it is recommended that the whole vertebral body (or nearly so) be 
covered so as to avoid uneven growth of the vertebral body resulting in spi[INVESTIGATOR_407271].  
CTV2: Posterior Fossa or Involved Field Boost:
The GTVp is defined as any post-operative residual tumor seen on MRI or CT scan in 
addition to the collapsed resection cavity of the primary lesion.   
The CTV2 is defined as 1-1.5 cm anatomically constrained margin around the GTVp and 
any other sites the treating physician judges to be at high risk for microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_407272]. Or, if the tumor is arising in the posterior fossa, the entire posterior fossa may be 
boosted. This is up to the COG protocol or physician discretion after consultation with 
the patient (if appropriate) or/and their guardians. 
            Metastases boosts: 
Guidelines for boosting metastatic disease (ie M1, M2 or M3) will be in accordance with 
the COG guidelines and institutional practice, but are briefly outlined below. 
 
CTV 3, 4, 5, etc:  
The boosts for the gross metastatic deposits will be targeted with a 5-10 mm margin of 
CTV and include any other area the treating physician feels is at high risk for local 
recurrence.  
Planning Target Volumes (PTV): 
An additional margin for set up uncertainty and motion will be applied according to each 
institution’s regular practices. 
The irradiated volume includes normal tissue, which receives a clinically significant dose 
with respect to normal tissue effects.
5.2.4 Dosimetry Planning
Cranial spi[INVESTIGATOR_407273]’s standard protocol for this 
technique and will include moving junctions of matched fields for safety.  
5.2.5 Dose Specification and Schedule
Physicians are encouraged to enroll patients onto other active protocols (e.g. testing 
chemotherapy regimens).  The radiation dose and fractionation schedule in these cases is 
in accordance with the co-existing protocol. Patients will usually be treated once per day. 
Doses will be prescribed such that 95% of the CTV is covered by 100% of the 
prescription dose. Dose will be reported in GyRBE (where 1 GyRBE = proton dose Gy x

19RBE, RBE = 1.1). A RBE of 1.1 has been selected for protons and is based on RBE 
determinations in animal and cell culture systems [43,44].
Cumulative dose volume histograms using nominal dose distribution will be generated 
for all structures listed in 5.2.3.  
5.2.6  Proton Beam Physical Factors
Proton treatments will be delivered at the Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center at the 
[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_181397] a 240 MeV cyclotron. At MDACC, proton 
treatments will be delivered at the MDACC Proton Therapy Center using a 250 MeV 
synchrotron. Treatments will usually be administered as one daily fraction, 5 days per 
week. 
5.2.6 Proton Beam Modification/Blocking
Beam shapi[INVESTIGATOR_407274].  The 
penumbra is large and field shapi[INVESTIGATOR_407275] a 
downstream custom cut brass aperture. Apertures will be constructed on brass alloy of 
sufficient thickness to attenuate 99.9% of protons. Apertures will be cut to be parallel to 
beam divergence. 3-D lucite compensators may be fabricated to conform dose to the 
target at the distal aspect.
5.2.[ADDRESS_513595] three patients treated at 
each site will be reviewed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_407276]’s PI.  As 
described in Section 12.1.3, below, plans will be submitted to the Advance Technology 
QA Center at Washington University, St Louis (ATC) for this protocol.  The plans will 
be sent to the ATC upon approval by [CONTACT_1963], and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or 
Participating Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_407277].
5.2.9 Beam Verification:
Digitally reconstructed radiography (DRR) will be done for treatment planning and 
verification and will be performed daily during treatment. 
5.2.10 Dose Uniformity
Dose gradient in CTV should remain within +7% to –5% of prescribed dose.
5.2.[ADDRESS_513596] co-investigator at each participating institution will be responsible for dose 
verification.

5.2.12 Concurrent Protocol
For patients who are enrolled on co-existing protocols such as COG, physicians will 
adhere to the radiation therapy guidelines of the companion protocol which specify their 
own guidelines for the following parameters: total dose, dose per fraction, fractionation 
schedule and sequencing with other therapy (e.g. chemotherapy).   If any questions or 
discrepancies arise, then contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Torunn Yock, MD at ([PHONE_8414] 
([EMAIL_7771]) before beginning radiation treatments. 
5.2.13 Treatment Delay
To avoid treatment delays resulting from the machine being down, photon or electron (if 
appropriate) beam radiation can be administered.  The maximum dose for both the 
posterior fossa and spi[INVESTIGATOR_99530] 20% of the prescribed dose (e.g. 20% of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_16717] 36 
Gy would be a maximum of 4 spi[INVESTIGATOR_407278] 7.2 Gy).   Delay in the start of CSI 
proton therapy shall not exceed 2 weeks in M0 patients and 1 week in M+ patients. 
5.2.14 Emergent Radiation Therapy
For patients who require emergent RT when a proton slot is not available, photon (or 
electron beam) therapy may be delivered at the maximum dose for the posterior fossa and 
at 20% of the maximum dose for the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (e.g. 20% of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_16717] 36 Gy would be a 
maximum of 7.2 Gy).  
5.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines
There are no required concomitant medications in this study.  No other radiotherapy besides 
that which was outlined above may be used during study treatment.  Patients may receive all 
concomitant therapy deemed necessary to provide optimal support.  
5.4 Duration of Therapy
Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and 
tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment will continue 
until the prescribed dose of radiation therapy is delivered or until one of the following criteria 
applies:
Disease progression,
Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,
Unacceptable adverse event(s),
Participant decides to withdraw from the study, or
General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the 
participant unacceptable for further treatment in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_209822].

via the Coordinating Center at [EMAIL_7772].
6. EXPECTED TOXICITIES AND DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
Toxicity assessments will be done using the CTEP Active Version NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) which is available at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic applications/ctc.htm. 
If possible, symptoms should be managed symptomatically. In the case of toxicity, appropriate 
medical treatment should be used (including anti-emetics, anti-diarrheals, etc.).
All adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_137453], through the study and until the final study visit. Participants continuing to 
experience toxicity at the off study visit may be contact[CONTACT_221824].

Tumors caused by [CONTACT_54615]
Vascular effects, either asymptomatic or causing stroke
6.2 Toxicity Management  
Toxicity that causes a delay or dose modification in radiation therapy is not expected.  Once 
radiation has started it is important to continue with radiation unless it is deemed unsafe for 
the patient (i.e. they require anesthesia and have pneumonia). If the patient experiences 
toxicity from chemotherapy, delays and dose modifications should be made according to the 
concurrent chemotherapy treatment protocol. 
6.3 Dose Modifications/Delays   
Phase II Study of Proton RT for Medulloblastoma and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_99185]: Acute Toxicity and Long Term 
Outcomes, T. Yock, MD
7/20/18
23To avoid treatment delays resulting from the proton machine being down, photon beam 
radiation can be administered. The maximum dose for both the posterior fossa and spi[INVESTIGATOR_407281] 20% of the dose (e.g. 20% of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_16717] 36 Gy would be a max. of 4 spi[INVESTIGATOR_407282]). 
Delay in the start of CSI proton therapy treatment should not exceed 2 weeks in M0 patients 
and 1 week in M+ patients.
Radiation treatment delays must be avoided where possible.  If a patient is unable to receive 
a CSI treatment on a given day then consideration should be made to delivering the boost 
treatment where possible.

collected and included in the data set.
(10) Baseline neurocognitive testing must be completed no later than [ADDRESS_513601]-
radiation (+ or – 12 months).
Patient Assessments:
The required tests and evaluations prior to, during and following CSI are shown in table 2.
Patients will require acute side effect assessment during radiation therapy as detailed in section 
9.1 below.  Acute side effects from RT are defined as those effects that are attributable to the 
effects of radiation and occur from commencement of RT to 90 days following completion of 
RT.  
Patients will be assessed for late side effects or complications which are defined as those effects 
that are attributable to the effects of radiation and occur > [ADDRESS_513602] be recorded along with reason for break.

7/20/[ADDRESS_513603] should be made.   
Labs required at baseline for study are TSH, Free T4, Cortisol, IGF-1, IGF-BP3, LH, 
FSH, estradiol (females), testosterone (males) – am levels preferred. These labs are 
recommended, but not required, at annual follow up time points. Endocrine evaluation 
also includes Tanner Stage assessed by [CONTACT_117145], bone age (plain film of the wrist), 
and body proportion measurements. Bone age, Tanner Stage assessment, and body

269.2.2  Audiology evaluation
Audiograms are required and should be done prior to start of radiation. Audiograms 
should be obtained on a yearly basis as well (see table 2). Additionally regular 
audiograms are recommended but not required to be performed at the patient’s home 
institution prior to each cycle of platinum based chemotherapy in accordance with the 
standard of care because platinum chemotherapy can cause acute hearing loss. If the 
baseline audiogram cannot be completed prior to the start of radiation, it must be 
completed within 2 months of the beginning of radiation therapy. Each ear (left and right) 
should be tested and recorded separately. 
 
Grading of sensorineural hearing loss will be according to the CTEP Active Version of 
CTCAE.
9.2.3 Neurocognitive evaluation  
Analysis of Neurocognitive Function (NCF) will be limited to English speaking 
population, as norms for most tests are only available for this population. At baseline, 
neurocognitive testing will be required for all patients without posterior fossa syndrome. 
Patients with posterior fossa syndrome will be evaluated and referred if deemed 
appropriate. Patients will be required to undergo formal NCF evaluation at the 
Psychology Assessment Center at MGH or at the home institution.   
Patients whose premorbid IQ is less than 60 (with no indication that the tumor led to an 
acute and dramatic decline in IQ) will be excluded from neuro-psychological assessment.  
Evidence for a dramatic decline will include parental report, school records, variability in 
IQ profile, gross inattention or lack of motivation/cooperation, and/or concurrent 
functional illness (e.g., depression).  
Subjects will receive a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation at baseline.  
Whenever possible, subjects will be evaluated within [ADDRESS_513604]-RT (+ or – 12 months).
The battery of tests administered will be the same at every administration, as much as 
possible, and should include the following measures:

Tumor response is not an endpoint of this study.  Patients will be evaluated for progressive 
disease based on imaging studies obtained in follow up.
10.1 Progression-Free Survival
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to 
time of objective disease progression. 
10.2 Response Review
There is no central review of radiology assessments as response rate is not a primary 
endpoint or even a secondary endpoint of the trial. This trial measures toxicity and late 
effects and therefore central radiology review is not indicated. 
11. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
11.1 General 
Adverse event collection and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial. This study will 
use the descriptions and grading scales found in the CTEP Active Version of the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) that is available on the CTEP 
website at:  http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.html. 
Information on all adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_2299], directly observed, or 
detected by [CONTACT_5292], laboratory test or other means, will be collected, recorded, 
followed and reported as described in the following sections. 
All adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_407310], throughout 
the study treatment, and within [ADDRESS_513610] dose of study treatment will be collected 
and reported as per DFCI guidelines. Participants who experience an ongoing adverse event 
related to a study procedures and/or study medication beyond [ADDRESS_513611]-study event(s) that might 
reasonably be related to participation in this study. The investigator should notify the the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_359299], IRB, and any other applicable regulatory agency of any 
unanticipated death or adverse event occurring after a participant has discontinued or 
terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to the study.

11.2.1  Adverse Event (AE)
An adverse event is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or experience 
that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any 
procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the 
study. 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if 
they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests. 
11.2.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition which:
is fatal or life-threatening;
requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;
constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or
jeopardizes the participant and requires medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:
routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with 
any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures
elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that did not 
worsen
emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria 
outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]
11.2.3 Expectedness 
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.' 
[IP_ADDRESS] Expected adverse event
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an 
adverse event is considered expected when it appears in the current adverse event 
list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or is included in the informed 
consent document as a potential risk.

31Refer to Section 6.1 for a listing of expected adverse events associated with the 
study radiation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Unexpected adverse event
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected when it 
varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the current 
adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or when it is not 
included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.  
11.2.4 Attribution 
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and the 
study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:
Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.
Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.
Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment. 
Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.
Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.
11.[ADDRESS_513612] with the participant. All adverse 
events will be recorded on the appropriate study-specific case report forms (CRFs). After 30 
days beyond completion of study treatment, only adverse events that are possibly, probably 
or definitely related to study treatment will be collected for recording on the CRFs.
11.4 Reporting Adverse Events 
For multi-site trials where a DF/HCC investigator is serving as the principal investigator, 
each participating investigator is required to abide by [CONTACT_407311]. 
The study must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations, local safety reporting 
requirements, and reporting requirements of the principal investigator. 
Each investigative site will be responsible to report SAEs that occur at that institution to their 
respective IRB. It is the responsibility of each participating investigator to report serious 
adverse events to the study sponsor and/or others as described below. 
The following severe toxicities should be reported to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_407285]:
Transverse myelitis
Any other grade 4 acute toxicity except myelosuppression
Death
Phase II Study of Proton RT for Medulloblastoma and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_99185]: Acute Toxicity and Long Term 
Outcomes, T. Yock, MD
7/20/18
32Each adverse event will be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for serious adverse 
event. If a serious adverse event occurs, expedited reporting will follow local policies, and 
federal guidelines and regulations as appropriate. 
It is the responsibility of the participating investigator to notify the Principal Investigator (or 
Protocol Chair), IRB, and others of all serious adverse events as required in the protocol. 
The Principal Investigator (or Protocol Chair) will provide information with respect to 
adverse events and safe use of the study treatment (e.g., safety reports, Action Letters) to all 
participating investigators as soon as the information becomes available. 
11.4.[ADDRESS_513613] be reported to the DF/HCC 
Overall Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_141752]. This includes events 
meeting the criteria outlined in Section 11.2, 11.4, as well as the following:
Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (severe) events that are unexpected and at 
least possibly related/associated with the intervention.
All Grade 4 (life-threatening or disabling) events that are unexpected, 
except myelosuppression.
All Grade 5 (fatal) events while the participant is enrolled and actively 
participating in the trial OR when the event occurs within [ADDRESS_513614] study intervention. 
Note: If the participant is in long term follow up, report the death at the time 
of continuing review. 
Participating investigators must report each serious adverse event to the DF/HCC Overall 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_407286]. In the event 
that the participating investigator does not become aware of the serious adverse event 
immediately (e.g., participant sought treatment elsewhere), the participating investigator 
is to report the event within one business day after learning of it and document the time 
of his or her first awareness of the adverse event. Report serious adverse events by

14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
The primary outcomes are late complications following proton beam irradiation to the 
craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_407290]. Late complications are defined as the delayed effects 
attributable to radiation which occur > [ADDRESS_513623] dose. Due to a difference 
Phase II Study of Proton RT for Medulloblastoma and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_99185]: Acute Toxicity and Long Term 
Outcomes, T. Yock, MD
7/20/[ADDRESS_513624] separate accrual goals. 
14.1 Study Design/Endpoints
Accrual goals are [ADDRESS_513625]-risk 
patients is in the 75-80% range depending on the concurrent use of chemotherapy, while 65-
70% is reported among high-risk patients. Thus, [ADDRESS_513626]-risk and 20 high-risk patients 
are projected to be evaluable for late complications at 3 years following the CSI completion; 
patients who progress or die sooner will not contribute in the analysis of late complications.
The primary endpoint of ototoxicity at 3 years following completion of radiation therapy will 
be based on failure events defined by [CONTACT_479] 3 or 4 sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) 
according to COG criteria. They include progressive hearing decrease to grade 3 or 4 
following mild or moderate loss (grade 1 or 2) typi[INVESTIGATOR_407291]-based 
chemotherapy. All patients who have audiology assessments prior to censorship will 
contribute to the actuarial analysis. Patients will be censored in the event of death, drop out 
or progression of disease. The historical rates of late SNHL is in the 50% range among 
pediatric MB patients [9, 10] treated with conventional CSI and cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy. We shall conclude proton therapy leads to an improvement in the high-risk 
group if 7 or fewer of 20 patients were to experience grade 3 or 4 SNHL at 3 years following 
completion of radiation therapy. The decision rule is associated with 77% power if the SNHL 
rate were truly reduced to 30% among the high-risk patients. In contrast, the probability is 
only 13% for concluding incorrectly an improvement if the underlying SNHL rate were 50%. 
In the null hypothesis for the standard-risk group, we assume conventional CSI and cisplatin-
based chemotherapy is associated with an SNHL rate less than 50% due to their lower CSI 
dose, in particular, 40%. We shall conclude proton therapy leads to an improvement in the 
standard-risk group if 14 or fewer of 48 patients were to experience grade 3 or 4 SNHL at 3 
years following completion of radiation therapy. The decision rule is associated with 80% 
power if the SNHL rate were truly reduced to 25% among the standard-risk patients. In 
contrast, the probability is only 8% for concluding incorrectly an improvement if the 
underlying SNHL rate were 40%. 
Published data on neuroendocrine dysfunction and neurocognitive functioning have been 
based on small sample sizes, varying CSI doses and heterogeneous populations not directly 
comparable to the pediatric MB and PB patients in this protocol. Therefore, analysis of these 
endpoints will be focused mainly on estimation and precision. A standard-risk group of [ADDRESS_513627] 95% confidence intervals of less than 30% for estimating the rates 
of neuroendocrine dysfunction and neurocognitive functioning, while the maximum interval 
width will be 46% based on 20 patients. Confidence intervals will be narrower in the analysis 
of acute effects, as more patients will be evaluable because very few losses will occur due to 
progression or death within 90 days following completion of CSI.

3814.2   Sample Size/Accrual Rate
Based on recent clinical experience, the protocol is projected to accrue about 18 patients per 
year combined between the two participating institutions. Enrollment is planned for 5 years 
in order to meet the overall accrual goal of 90 patients. The observed risk distribution of MB 
and PB patients has been approximately a 2:[ADDRESS_513628] 95% confidence intervals for binary data. The 
incidence of late complications will be based on actuarial estimates, primarily at [ADDRESS_513629] that meets the requirements of the International Committee of Medical 
Journal Editors. A full report of the outcomes should be made public no later than three (3) years 
after the end of data collection.

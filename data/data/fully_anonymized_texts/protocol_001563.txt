2.1 Need For Development of Prevention  Intervention for        
           Postmenopausal wome n on HRT for Control of Menopausal   
           Symptoms  
 
It is estimated that one quarter of postmenopausal women in the United 
States take hormone replacement ther apy [National Institutes of Health 
2005]. This is primarily because nothing else is as efficient in relieving 
perimenopausal symptoms [Barto n 2002; Nelson 2004]. There is no 
identified primary preven tion strategy for those women who are both at 
high risk for breast cancer because of  family history or prior pre-cancerous 
biopsy and who need hormone re placement therapy to alleviate 
perimenopausal symptoms [Fabian 2005C; Wickerham 2006].   Standard 
drug prevention therapy for postmenopausal women is tamoixfen or 
raloxifene and major prevention Phase II clinical trials in postmenopausal 
women are investigating use of ar omatase inhibitors  [Cuzick 2005].  
Current expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_190979] [Vogel 2001; Chlebowski 2002] 
and clinical trials with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) or raloxifene exlude 
women who use hormone replacement therapy. Concerns about side 
effects and quality of life are major reasons why the majority of women 
have avoided primary prevention therap y with anti-estrogenic drugs in the 
past [Port 2001; Vogel 2002; Tcho u 2004; Bober 2004]. Advice to a 
symptomatic high risk wo man that she discontinue hormones in order to 
take anti-estrogens has a poor likelihood of being heeded as this would 
force her to both give up an effective therapy for her menopausal 
symptoms in addition to starting a medication which has a substantial chance of worsening them. An effect ive prevention strategy which would 
permit symptomatic high risk wo men to continue taking hormone 
replacement is needed and is the subject of this protocol.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_227168] Cancer Prevention by [CONTACT_191056]# [ZIP_CODE]                 Version 1.5 – June 28, [ADDRESS_227169], muscle, brain, bone, uterus, blood 
vessels, and other organs especi ally adipose tissue. Aromatase 
enzyme promoter sensitivity differs  by [CONTACT_191060]. In the ovary the 
aromatase enzyme promoter is exqu isitely sensitive to increases in 
follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). The aromatase promoter in the 
breast is minimally sensitive to FSH but very sensitive to inflammatory cytokines and grow th factors such as IL6, TGF β and 
TNFα and prostaglandin E2, most of which increase with age (e.g. 
IL6), or proliferative breast disease, and cancer [Santen 1999, 
Miller 2001; Yue 2001, Bruegge meier 2003]. Thus aromatase 
activity is often up-regulated in proliferative breast disease as well 
as breast cancer [Brueggemeier 2003].  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_227170] estrogen is  derived from local production not 
systemic uptake [Santen 1999]. The large amount of aromatase in 
breast tissue may be one of the reas ons that breast tissue levels of 
estradiol are 10-50X that of serum levels in postmenopausal women 
who are not on HRT [Santen 1999].  Aromatase inhibitors have 
traditionally not been used for trea tment of systemic metastases in 
premenopausal women as in this setting they produce only a partial 
blockade of estradiol synthesis by [CONTACT_3433] e ovary.  The reflex rise in LH 
and FSH, plus the large amount  of the aromatase substrate 
androstenidione, allows the pr emenopausal ovary to continue 
estradiol synthesis at about 60 % of baseline despi[INVESTIGATOR_190980] [Santen 1980].  Nonetheless, there have been 
anecdotal reports of responses in premenopausal women with 
metastatic breast cancer to  the first generation AI, 
aminoglutethimide [Wander 1986; Sa nten 1989]. Clinical response 
to AIs in postmenopausal women wi th established breast cancer has 
been directly correlated with breast tumor aromatase activity, and this association seems to be stro nger than for estrogen receptor 
levels [Miller 2001].  
 
 
Breast Cancer Prevention by [CONTACT_191056]# [ZIP_CODE]                 Version 1.5 – June 28, 2012                             Page 10 of 75  2.2.3 Aromatase Inhibitors More Effective Than Tamoxifen in  
Reducing Contra-Lateral Tumors in Adjuvant Trials  
 
Aromatase inhibitors are associat ed with superior disease free 
survival and reduced contralateral new primary cancers compared 
to tamoxifen in adjuvant trials. Adjuvant trials comparing an AI 
(anastrozole or letrozole) with tamoxifen as initial endocrine 
treatment or switching to an AI (exemestane) after 2-3 years of 
tamoxifen are associat ed with an approximate 50% reduction in 
contralateral breast cancer in  women with hormone receptor 
positive tumors [Coombes 2004;  Thurlimann 2005; Howell 2005]. 
Neither tamoxifen or raloxifene is effective in reducing ER negative 
cancer incidence [Fisher 1998; Wickerham 2006], and neither 
reduces estradiol levels.   
 
Estradiol activation of ER α increases production of several growth 
factors which may result in paracrine stimulation of growth of ER 
negative cells [Clarke 1997; Russo 1999; Shoker 1999]. Clinical 
evidence supporting estrogen deplet ion as a means of reducing the 
incidence of ER negative as well as  ER positive tumors comes from 
studies of BrCa1 deleterious mutation carriers in whom 
oophorectomy substantially reduce s the risk of breast cancer 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_190981] 1 mutation carriers develop ER- 
tumors [Rebbeck 1999, Eisen 2000;  Rebbeck 2002]. Th us, AIs, by 
[CONTACT_191061], have the potential to reduce the 
incidence of ER negative as well as ER positive tumors [Santen 
1999].  
 
2.2.4  Low Dose Hormone Replacement Ma y Prevent Some Side Effects 
Associated with Arom atase Inhibitors  
 
In adjuvant trials women randomiz ed to aromatase inhibitors had 
fewer thromboembolic events, uter ine cancers and vaginal bleeding 
compared to tamoxifen [Coombe s 2004; Thurlimann 2005; Howell 
2005]. Women randomized to an AI had a similar incidence of hot 
flashes as tamoxifen an d a higher incidence of arthralgias, bone 
mineral density loss, vaginal dryness, pain with intercourse, and 
loss of libido [Coombes 2004; Thurlimann 2005; Fallowfield 2004; 
Howell 2005].   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Side effects of letrozole compared to placebo 
 
Compared with placebo, extended  adjuvant therapy with the AI 
letrozole was associated with a hi gher incidence of hot flashes, 
arthritis, arthralgias and myalgias . The incidence of osteoporosis 
was borderline higher for letrozole (p=0.07). Quality of life studies 
(SF-36 and MENQOL) indicated worsening of sexual function, bodily 
pain, vitality, and vasomotor symptoms for women randomized to 
letrozole versus placebo. Most of  these symptoms can be explained 
by [CONTACT_191062] [Fallowfield 2004]. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  AIs and Cardiovascular Disease 
Breast Cancer Prevention by [CONTACT_191056]# [ZIP_CODE]                 Version 1.5 – June 28, [ADDRESS_227171] a 
higher number of cardiovascular related events and deaths in 
women randomized to AIs compar ed to tamoxifen [Coombes 2004; 
Thurlimann 2005; Howell 2005], but generally, no increase in 
cardiovascular events when an arom atase inhibitor was compared to 
placebo [Goss 2003]. Tamoxifen’s pa rtial estrogen agonist effects 
on the liver result in favorable modulation of total cholesterol:HDL 
ratio [Love 1990], an important pred ictor of cardiac events [Ridker 
2005]. In primary prevention tr ials the improved total/HDL 
cholesterol ratio observed with tamoxifen has not translated into a 
significant  overall protective e ffect on the cardiovascular system 
[Fisher 1998], possibly because this is partially offset by [CONTACT_191063] a number of pro-coagulant molecules [Hozumi 
1998; Brun 1986 Decensi 1998; Mart tunen 2000]. Letrozole like 
other AIs has minimal effect on lipi[INVESTIGATOR_190982] 
[Harper-Wynne 2002; Goss 2003; Atal ay 2004]. In a mature (5 
year) analysis of the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES), in which women undergoing adjuvant hormonal therapy were randomized to 
exemestane or further tamoxifen after 2-3 years of tamoxifen, 
women randomized to exemesta ne had an overall survival 
advantage without a significant increase in ischemic heart disease 
or stroke [Coombes 2006]. 
 
Although the results of the IES trial are reassuring, it is possible 
that AI-induced severe estrogen  depletion might have adverse 
effects on vascular endothelial function which might explain the non-significant trend in ischemic cardiovascular events compared 
with tamoxifen [Thurlimann 200 5; Everson 1995; Elisaf 2001; 
Blumel 2003].  In preclinic al models, activated ER α in blood vessels 
facilitates smooth muscle relaxation  and vasodilatation in response 
to nitrous oxide [Bolego 2005]. Th is response is abolished by 
[CONTACT_191064] [Bolego 2005] . If AIs reduce available tissue 
estradiol in blood vessels the result could be accelerated 
atherosclerosis [Nakamura 2005]. It is theoretically possible that 
the use of low dose estradiol with an AI might prevent or blunt the 
effects of estrogen deprivation on  vascular endothelium similar to 
the protective effects on bone turnover markers. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  AIs and Osteoporosis 
 
While it is still unclear whether use of AIs increase risk of clinical heart disease, it is very clear they  increase the risk of osteoporosis, 
bone fracture, arthralgias, an d joint stiffness [Cuzick 2005].  
Increase in the risk of osteopor osis may in part be due to the 
unfavorable effect of estrogen depletion on vitamin D and joint 
physiology. Development of osteoporosis in women taking AIs may 
be due to unmasking of subclinic al vitamin D insu fficiency with 
estrogen depletion due to do wn regulation of the 1,25- α 
hydroxylase enzyme which converts circulating inactive provitamin D to the active form, and down regulation of the vitamin D receptor

calcium and bone mineral loss due to elevation of parathormone.  
 
Kendall et al. from the Royal Marsden Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190983] [ADDRESS_227172] 6 weeks on es tradiol alone returned towards 
normal with add back estradio l [Kendall 2006]. Arthralgias and 
morning stiffness are observed after menopause with increased 
frequency and have been presum ed to be due to estrogen 
deprivation. Articular cartilage contains estrogen receptor α and β 
and physiologic changes have been observed in primate studies in 
proteoglycan synthesis and in  IGFBP-2 following estrogen 
administration [Richmond 2000]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risks and Benefits of Horm one Replacement Therapy  
 
Hormone replacement therapy, while associated with a reduction in 
menopausal symptoms, osteoporosis and hip fracture as well as 
colon cancer, is also associated with  increased risk of breast cancer 
and venous and arterial thromboembolism [Rossouw 2002; 
Anderson 2004; Hays 2003; Peeyan anjarassri 2005].  Risk varies 
with type, dose and route of drug administration as well as age of 
the individual.  For brea st cancer, the increase in relative risk is 1-
2% per year of use for estrogen  alone, and 5-10% per year for 
estrogens plus progestins [Chleb owski 2003; Anderson 2004; Beral 
2003; Fournier 2005]. No increase in risk of breast cancer has been 
demonstrated for women who began oral premarin alone in their 
50’s and continued for an averag e of eight years [Chlebowski 
2003].  Increase in risk of breast  cancer applies to current users 
only and may be less for micronized  progesterone than a synthetic 
progestin in women taking combin ation therapy [Fournier 2005].   
 
Increase in risk of cardiovascular events and deep venous 
thrombosis appear to be related to  route of administration, type of 
preparation as well as a woman’s ag e.  Increase in deep venous 
thrombosis and cardiovascular events and dementia is probably due 
to the procoagulant effects of oral estrogen and progestins 
promoted by [CONTACT_191065] a 
result of a first pass effect of es trogen through the liver [Anderson 
2004].   
 
Younger women ages 50-60 on estrogen alone may actually 
experience a reduction in coronary disease risk due to the favorable 
properties of estrogen on va scular endothelium [Anderson 2004; 
Hsia 2006; Blumel 2003].  There a ppear to be fewer procoagulant 
effects [Modena 2005; Langer 2005]  and thromboembolic events 
[Oger 2003; Scarabin 2003] with transdermal compared to oral 
preparations. C-reactive protein along with lipi[INVESTIGATOR_190984] [Ridker 1998, 2005].  Specifically the increase in C-

observed with oral preparations are not observed after transdermal 
estradiol [Modena 2005; Langer 2005; Fournier 2005; Rossouw 
2002; Manson 2003; Lowe 2000, 2001; Post 2003].  Although there 
is increasing use of the more physiologic transdermal preparations 
[NIH 2005], it still accounts for a sm all minority of prescriptions and 
consequently it is difficult for us to mandate that women eligible for 
this study be on this type of hormone replacement.  However, if 
letrozole were found to reduce br east cancer risk in women on 
hormone replacement and the thro mboembolic complications could 
be reduced by [CONTACT_191066], the potential impact 
on quality of life for a large number of menopausal high risk women 
could be substantial. 
 
Further, for those high risk wo men contemplating primary risk 
reduction with an AI the combin ation of the AI plus low dose 
hormones might be as effective as  antihormonal primary prevention 
therapy, with fewer side effects than with AIs alone. 
 
2.3 Preclinical Evidence Supporting Use of Letrozole in a High Estrogen 
Environment 
 
Aromatase over-producing transgen ic mice spontaneously develop 
mammary hyperplasia and dysplasia wh ich may progress to cancer if a 
carcinogen is also administered [Tekmal 1999]. Letrozole reduces ER 
expression, proliferative indices, and reverses dysplasia in hormonally 
intact animals [Kirma 2001; Luthra 2003]. Thus, in a preclinical model, 
letrozole appears effective in reversing precancerous changes in a moderately high estr ogen environment.

estradiol and testosterone, and serum insulin growth factor one 
(IGF-1) and its binding protein IG FBP3 [reviewed in Fabian 2005A]. 
Many of these biomarkers are interrelated such that pre-
menopausal women with high breast  density may be more likely to 
have higher serum levels of IGF-[ADDRESS_227174] disease [By[CONTACT_7943] 2000; Boyd 
1995, 1992, 2002].   
 
 Not all of these biomarkers are good  risk or response indicators for 
postmenopausal women. For post -menopausal women, serum IGF-[ADDRESS_227175] Cancer Prevention by [CONTACT_191056]# [ZIP_CODE]                 Version 1.5 – June 28, 2012                             Page 14 of 75  
menopausal women [Hankinson 1998] . Likewise breast density may 
not be a good response biomarker in postmenopausal women either 
because they have little density at  baseline and/or little reduction 
has been observed with standard  prevention therapy such as 
tamoxifen [Cuzick 2004]. For exampl e, there was only a 1% median 
reduction of breast density observ ed with tamoxifen in women in 
the IBIS-1 trial over the age of 55  compared with marked reduction 
in density in women under age 45. Further, there may actually be 
an inverse relationship between so me postmenopausal risk factors 
such as body mass and mammogr aphic density [Boyd 2002]. Thus 
it is not clear that breast density is a useful response biomarker for 
postmenopausal women [Cuzick 2004].  
 
Precancerous changes are common in high-risk women undergoing 
prophylactic mastectomy [Hoogerbr ugge 2003], but the majority of 
high-risk women have never had a diagnostic biopsy. We have

Subjects were required to be at high risk as defined by [CONTACT_191069]:  1) five year Gail risk >1.67%; 2) known BRCA1/2 
mutation carrier; 3) prior contralateral treated DCIS; 4) prior biopsy 
showing LCIS or atypi[INVESTIGATOR_97548].   Postmenopausal status was defined 
as having either a prior bilateral oophorectomy, prior hysterectomy with 
ovaries intact and age greater than 50, or prior natural menopause with no 
period for at least [ADDRESS_227182] been in good health with an ECOG performance status of 0-1, 
reasonably normal orga n function, a baseline serum estradiol of <150 
pg/ml, and a normal mammogram perfor med within six months prior to 
the baseline RPFNA. 
 
The subject’s baseline random RPFNA mu st have exhibited hyperplasia with 
atypia or borderline atypia with a Masood quantitative index score of ≥14.

Cytolyt™  (9 cc Cytolyt™ and 1 cc 10% neutral buffered formalin).  At least 
three slides were prepared by a standard ThinPrep 2000 (Cytyc) non-
gynecologic protocol. Slides for cytomo rphology, Ki-67, and ER were first 
Pap-stained under RNase free conditio ns. Cytomorphology assessment was 
performed by a single cytopathologis t and classified by [CONTACT_191070] [Zalles 1995], Mas ood semiquantitati ve index score

found that use of the Masood scori ng system reduces intra-observer 
interpretive variance [Fabian 2002].  Consequently, the Masood score 
index was used to determine change in  cytomorphology.  A change of 3 or 
more points is generally consistent wi th a descriptive category change and 
thus considered significant.    
Ki-67 Assessment
 
Only baseline slides containing >500 epi[INVESTIGATOR_190992]-67.  Hyperplastic clus ters were preferentially assessed and 
the number of cells with unequivocal nuclear staining out of 500 cells 
assessed was recorded.  Slides were  hand scored by [CONTACT_191071].  In case of a disagreement 
between two readers, assessments we re averaged for the final score; 
however, agreement for Ki-67 scores between the two readers is generally 
excellent with Cronbach’s α=0.99 [Khan 2005].

Estrogen Receptor Assessment
 
Estrogen receptor expression was a ssessed with ID5 anti body from Dako 
diluted at 1:100 and applied for 30 minutes.  The ER protocol was 
optimized by [CONTACT_191072] [INVESTIGATOR_190993] [Petroff 2006A].  This protocol  involved use of low temperature 
(90°C) retrieval for two minutes with a 0.2X nuclear decloaker (Biocare) 
and use of a 0.01% glucose oxidase blocking reagent for 30 minutes at 
37°C.  ER was hand scored by [CONTACT_191073] [ADDRESS_227187] exhibiting ER staining.  The proportion of cells staining at each intensity (0-4+) was assessed.  The proportion of cells staining at 
each intensity was then multiplied by [CONTACT_191074]/intensity sub-scores. The weighted intensity score (IS) was 
computed by [CONTACT_191075]/intensity sub-scores.  Under 
this system scores can theoretically ra nge from 0-4.  However, for benign 
hyperplastic cells which average 30% ER  expression with 2+ staining,  our 
median intensity score was approximately 0.6. 
 
Hormones and Growth Factors
 
In addition to cellular  assessments, blood was ob tained for estradiol, 
progesterone, testosterone, SHBG, and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 at baseline and at 
six months and frozen at -80 °C until analysis.  Samples were not obtained 
under fasting conditions.  Estradiol  and testosterone were measured in

 qRT-PCR Analysis of Gene Expression
 
 
For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], primer probes with a 3’ bias were constructed for ER, 
aromatase, pS2, PCNA, MCM2, Cyclin D1, survivin, and VEGF. The quantity 
of RNA is expressed relative to the level of that for a housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_171520]. 
The housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_190998]. Markers 
expected to be in relatively high abundance (e.g., ER, Cyclin D1) were 
tested against actin which is highly expressed.  Markers expected to be 
expressed in relatively low levels (e.g., proliferation markers, pS2, aromatase) were tested against TA TA box binding protein (TBP), a 
housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_190999].  PCR reactions were run 
on an Applied Biosystems Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System.  PCR 
values obtained with crossing threshold (CT) values if fewer than 30 cycles 
were considered valid for analysis [Giulietti 2001; Feldman 2002; Gjerdrum

cases correlated well with change in Ki-67. Figure 7 plots the relative 
expression for pS2 (6 month value/baseline) vs. change in Ki-67 
expression (6 months – baseline).  It  is encouraging that pS2 (an estrogen 
responsive gene) was generally reduce d (values less than 1) when Ki-67

Nuclear Morphometry
 
 
A developmental study in collaboration with the University of Arizona was 
conducted to examine quantitative nu clear morphometry (karyometry) as a 
means of describing the proportion of  abnormal cells before and after 
prevention intervention. Papanicolaou-stained ThinPrep slides of RPFNA 
samples from 11 subjects were digitall y recorded at high resolution with 
200 cells measured in each slide, at baseline and at 6 months. The nuclear 
chromatin pattern was assessed for it s characteristics by [CONTACT_191086]; a determination of nuclear abnormalities was carried 
out and procedures were applied that allowed the identification of a 
subpopulation on cells which showed expression of abnormality. This 
provided an estimate of 6.6 % of abnormal cells at base line, and of 1.6 % at 6 months, indicating a decrease in the frequency of abnormal cells 
following treatment with letrozole.  The slides from the remaining 31 
subjects are being analyzed for a vali dation of this preliminary result.

This is a multi-institution double-blind  placebo-controlled trial to whose main 
endpoint is to determine if 6 months of letrozole (2.5 mg daily) can reduce 
proliferation as assessed by [CONTACT_15915]-[ADDRESS_227203] RPFNA evidence of hyperplasia with 
atypia or borderline atypia, and a mini mum Ki-67 in a hyperplastic foci of >  1.5%.

in qRT-PCR assessed estrogen response  genes (GREB-1, pS2). Mammographic 
density and bioavialable estradiol and testosterone will be assessed as well. No 
difference in change betw een letrozole versus placebo is expected for 
mammographic breast density, Masood Index score, or serum hormones, but 
significant reductions are expected in Ki -67, expression of estrogen response 
genes by [CONTACT_191088], and the proportion of  cells deemed abnormal by [CONTACT_191089]. Other secondary endpoints include change in biomarkers 
associated with bone and cardiovascular health, toxicity measurements using the 
NCI CTCAE version 3.0, BCPT Symptom Check List (Mayo Clinic) hot flash score, 
general fatigue inventory the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire from the Health Assiessment Questionnaire, (w hich assessed joint stiffne ss and functional impact). 
These are validated questionnaires and it should take no more than 10-[ADDRESS_227204] RPFNA and biomarker assessment. The 
primary purpose of the subsequent 6 months  open label letrozole is to facilitate 
recruitment, but also to assess biomarker and toxici ty endpoint changes with 
longer treatment.  A DEXA scan will be  performed at completion of study to

subjects will be given eight months (one month of overage) of drug at the baseline and [ADDRESS_227220] capsules.  
 
5.3   Concomitant Medications 
Subjects are required to maintain  any hormonal use throughout the 
duration of study participation. Su bjects are strongly encouraged to 
continue any routine medications throughout the duration of the study to 
avoid confounding adverse events due to starting and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_191002] y. Subjects are not allowed to start tamoxifen, 
raloxifene, anastrozole, letrozole or any other SERM or aromatase inhibitor 
(or other chemopreventive) while participating on this trial.  
 
All medications (prescription and over -the-counter), vitamin and mineral 
supplements, and/or herbs taken by [CONTACT_191096]: 1) start and stop date, 
dose and route of administration, an d indication. Medica tions taken for a

5.[ADDRESS_227223] be made to determine the reason(s) why a subject 
fails to return for the necessary visits  or is discontinued from the trial. 
Information regarding the reason for not completing the trial will be 
recorded on the appropri ate case report forms. 
 
It will be documented whether or not each subject completed the clinical study. If for any subject study treatm ent or observations were discontinued 
the reason will be recorded on the appropriate case re port form. Reasons 
that a subject may discontinue part icipation in a clinical study are 
considered to constitute one of the following: 
• adverse event(s) 
• abnormal laboratory value(s) 
• abnormal test procedure result(s) 
• subject develops breast cancer 
• protocol violation 
• subject withdrew consent 
• lost to follow-up 
• administrative problems 
• physician decision 
• death 
 
All subjects that discontinue trial pr ematurely require notification of the 
Protocol Chair or her designee at  KUMC within [ADDRESS_227224] Cancer Prevention by [CONTACT_191056]# [ZIP_CODE]                 Version 1.5 – June 28, [ADDRESS_227225] to the mutual consideration of the Protocol Chair and the Trial 
Statistician.  
 
5.7 Adherence/Compliance 
  
Each subject will be given a seven month supply of drug/placebo at trial 
entry and instructed to return all exce ss drug/placebo to investigator at the 
six month visit. Six months of dosing is the expected amount of dosing, 
however, seven months of drug/placebo will be given to each subject to 
accommodate scheduling issues. At the end of treatment the actual 
quantity of unused drug/placebo wi ll be compared to the anticipated 
amount of unused drug. At the six month visit, all subjects have the option 
to receive seven months of open labe l drug supply, expected to cover six 
months of dosing and allow some flexability with scheduling the repeat 
RPFNA while on study drug. 
 
Subjects that maintain 70% of study agent intake as measured through patient reports and 
tablet counts conducted by [CONTACT_191097] r will be considered “compliant”. Percent intake 
will be computed as thenumber of tablets taken divided by [CONTACT_191098]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_191003].

packing slip will indicate from and to whom study drug/placebo was 
shipped, date, quantity, and batch or lot number. The dispensing record 
will indicate quantity and dates th at study drug was dispensed to and 
return by [CONTACT_6992]. At the completion of the study, all unused study 
drug/placebo will either be returned to [COMPANY_001] or destroyed per [COMPANY_001] 
instructions. The record documenting st udy drug return will include date, 
quantity, batch or code number, and the name [CONTACT_52943]/department to

replacement therapy. Since in this instance letrozole is being used in an 
experimental manner, we will file for an IND exemption, as we did for the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. 
 
6.2 Mechanism of Action 
 
Letrozole is a non-steroidal aromatas e inhibitor (4, 4’-1 H-1,2,4-Triazol-1 
ymethylene dibenzonitrile) with a molecular weight of 285.31. It is supplied 
by [CONTACT_15024] 2.[ADDRESS_227228], and absorption is not 
affected by [CONTACT_8208]. Letrozole is slowly metabolized to an inactive metabolite 
whose glucouride metabolite is renally excreted. About 90% of letrozole is 
recovered in urine.  Plasma concentr ations at steady state are 1.[ADDRESS_227229] been noted with age or moderate renal impairment. 
Subjects with moderate hepatic dy sfunction had 37% higher mean AUC 
levels than those without impaired function.

estrone, estradiol and estrone sulfate but do es not alter adrenal 
corticosteroid, aldosterone, or  thyroid hormone synthesis. 
 
6.5 Drug/Drug Interactions 
 
No drug/drug interactions have been noted with warfarin or cimetidine.  
Concomitant use of tamoxifen and letroz ole may decrease letrozole levels.

tamoxifen or after 5 years of tamoxifen in a dose of 2.5 mg per day. In the 
adjuvant setting, letrozole is given for 5 years  
 
6.7  Adverse Reactions 
 
6.7.1  Compared to placebo in adjuvant setting 
 
Adverse events which occurred more significantly more frequently in 
the MA.17 trial of extended adju vant letrozole versus placebo 
following 5 years of tamoxifen were : hot flashes (net  differerce + 
4%), loss of appetite (net difference + 2%), myalgias ( net 
difference +  3%), arthralgias  (net difference + 4%), alopecia (net 
difference +2%) [Goss 2003]. 
 
6.7.2  Compared to tamoxifen in adjuvant setting 
 
In adjuvant trials women randomized to aromatase inhibitors had 
fewer events, uterine cancers and thromboembol ic phenomena 
compared to tamoxifen [Coom bes 2004; Thurlimann 2005; Howell 
2005]. However, women randomized to an AI had a similar 
incidence of hotflashes and a higher incidence of arthralgias, bone 
mineral density loss, vaginal dryness, pain with intercourse, and 
loss of libido compared to those taking tamoxifen [Coombes 2004; 
Thurlimann 2005; Fallowfield 2004; Howell 2005].   
 
6.7.[ADDRESS_227232] cancer with a 
median exposure time of 11 mo nths the incidence of adverse 
experiences was similar for Fe mara (letrozole) (n=455) and 
tamoxifen (n=455). The most freque nt adverse events were nausea 
(15%), hot flushes (18%), fatigue (11%), dyspnea (14%) and 
arthralgias (14%).  Constipation was noted in 9%, headache 8%, diarrhea in 7%, vomiting in 7% , decreased appetite 4%, weight 
decrease in 6%, alopecia 5%, lower limb edema in 5%, and 
hypertension 5% (package insert). Discontinuation of drug for 
adverse experiences was performe d for 2% of patients taking 
Femara (letrozole) and 3% of those taking tamoxifen. A similar 
distribution of adverse events has been reported for subjects 
randomized to letrozole vs placebo in the MA17 trial

7.2 Pre-Study Procedures and Evaluations 
 
  7.2.1 Pre-study Eligibility RPFNA Procedure Details 
   
RPFNA will be performed, under local anesthesia from both breasts (two sites on each breast) and a ll cells pooled from both breasts 
(one breast in the case of prior DCIS or invasive cancer) into a 
single 15 cc tube containing modified Cytolyt™ (9 cc Cytolyt™ and 1 
cc 10% neutral buffered formalin). After cleansing the breast with 
betadine and alcohol swabs, the breast is  anesthetized with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_191005] a tuberculin syringe. After the 
surface has been anesthetized, epi[INVESTIGATOR_191006], approximately at the 10 
and 2 o’clock locations. Then, 5-6 needle passes with sterile RPMI 
prewetted 10-12 cc syringes/with 21 gauge 1 ½ inch needle, within 
the anesthetic puncture sites to withdraw epi[INVESTIGATOR_191007]. Clinician will preferentially sample areas in which 
resistance (density) is appreciated with the tip of the needle. 
Sample is immediately expelled into a 15 cc plastic tube containing 
9 cc of Cytolyt™ (Cytyc Corp) and 1 cc of 10% neutral buffered 
formalin. Fluid from the Cytolyt™ tube should be drawn into the 
needle/syringe hub approximately 4x  when expelling material into 
tube solution, and subject cell ma terial should not be expressed 
against the side of the tube. Tubes are then placed on a tube rocker 
for approximately 12-[ADDRESS_227239] them to and from the clinic. 
 Subjects meeting the eligibility cr iteria from the RPFNA procedure 
and completing other pre-study procedures will be offered 
participation in the trial.

9.1 Definition of an Adverse Event 
 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a study 
participant. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or study participant. An AE  can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with part icipation in a study, whether or not 
related to that participation. This includes any death that may occur while a participant is on study. 
 
Medical conditions/disease present before starting study treatment are only 
considered adverse events if they wo rsen after starting study treatment 
(any procedures specified in the protocol ). For purposes of this study, only 
those events that occur after a subject is ra ndomized are considered 
adverse events and should be noted as  such. Abnormal laboratory values 
or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs of 
symptoms or require therapy, and ar e recorded on the AE CRF under the 
signs, symptoms or diagno sis associated with them.

o AE Verbatim Term 
o CTCAE Term (version 3.0) 
o AE end date 
o Severity grade 
o Attribution to study agent (relatedness) 
o Reported as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)?

9.2.3  Severity of Adverse Events 
 
Identify the adverse event usin g the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. The CTCAE provides descriptive terminology and a grad ing scale for each adverse event 
listed. A copy of the CTCAE can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov
.  
 
AEs will be assessed according to the CTCAE grade associated with 
the AE term. AEs that do not have a corresponding CTCAE term will 
be assessed according to their impact  on the participant’s ability to 
perform daily activities as follows:

9.3 Assessment of Relationship of AE to Treatment 
 
The possibility that the adverse event is related to study drug will be 
classified as one of the following: not related, unlikely, possible, probable, 
definite. 
  
9.[ADDRESS_227253]. 7, 1997 define serious adverse 
events as those events, occurring at any dose, which meet any of the 
following criteria: 
o Results in death 
o Is life threatening (note: the term life-threatening refers to an event in 
which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does 
not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe). 
o Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929] 
o Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
o Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect 
o Events that may not meet these cr iteria, but which the investigator 
finds very unusual and/or potential serious, will also be report in the same manner.

Material is heated in an overnight incubation with proteinase K to lyse cells 
and dissociate nucleic acids prior to harvesting. RNA is isolated using 
column based chromatography and tr eated with DNase to eliminate any 
residual DNA.  Purified RNA is amplified with a single round of T7 based 
linear amplification (Paradise Reagent System, Arcturus) and converted to 
cDNA and stored at -80 °C until all specimens from a subject can be run in a 
single batch.  Quality of RNA is checked by [CONTACT_954] (QC Metric, Arcturus).  The 
quantity of RNA is expressed relative to the level of that for a 
housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_171520]. The housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_191022]. Markers expected to be in  relatively high abundance (e.g., ER, 
Cyclin D1) were tested against actin which is highly expressed.  Markers 
expected to be expressed in relatively low levels (e.g., proliferation 
markers, pS2, aromatase) were test ed against TATA box binding protein 
(TBP), a housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_191023].  PCR reactions 
were run on an Applied Biosyste ms Prism 7000 Sequence Detection 
System.  PCR values obtained with cro ssing threshold (CT) values if fewer 
than 30 cycles were considered valid for analysis [Giulietti 2001; Feldman 
2002; Gjerdrum 2004; Goldworthy 1999; Liss 2002; Al-Taher 2000; Liviak 
2001; DeCremoux 2003]. 
The primary purpose of qRT-PCR assessm ents on estracted RNA is to a) 
confirm presence of the targets for letrozole (aromatase) and estradiol 
(ER); b) provide indirect evidence of reduction in breast tissue estradiol 
through assessment of the estrogen response genes pS2 (trefoil factor-1) 
and GREB-1 [Rae 2005].

shipment on dry ice to KUMC.  Assays on baseline, 6-month, and

avoid batch variation. 
 
10.5.[ADDRESS_227261] extensive experience wi th use of serum hormones as 
biomarkers in clinical chemopre vention trials [Fabian 2002, 2004].  
Serum levels of estradiol will be measured by [CONTACT_191111] d Core Analysis Laboratory at 
the University of Virginia following diethyl ether extraction at KUMC.  
The lower limit of detection at the Ligand Lab is 1.5 pg/ml and the intra-assay variation is 4.3%.  Extraction prior to RIA avoids 
contamination by [CONTACT_191112] [Dowsett 
2005B]. Testosterone after diethyl et her extraction is also measured 
by a sensitive RIA with a lower limit of detection of 5 ng/dl and the 
intra-assay variation is 5%.  SHBG will be assayed by [CONTACT_191113] (Diagnostic 
Products Corp), with a lower limit of detection 0.2 nmol/L and intra-
assay variation of 2.4%.   
 
Bioavailable estradiol or testosterone  is calculated from the fraction 
that is unbound to SHBG [Stu mpf 1981].  Tracer amounts of 
tritiated estradiol or testosterone are added to aliquots of serum, 
ammonium sulfate is added to precipi[INVESTIGATOR_191024], the sample is centrifu ged, and then activity in the 
supernatant and the precipi[INVESTIGATOR_191025]. The percent activity in the supernatant is 
calculated to yield the fraction of bioavailable (non-SHBG bound) 
hormone. Sensitive chemiluminescent assays are being developed 
by [CONTACT_191114] 
[Dowsett 2005B]. 
 
We do not anticipate any significant difference in change in estradiol 
or testosterone between the letrozole and placebo groups.

The combination of high sensitivity C-reactive protein and total 
cholesterol:HDL ratios provide excellent risk biomarkers for 
cardiovascular disease [Ridker 2005]. Lipid panel with total 
cholesterol:HDL ratio is performed on serum by [CONTACT_191115] a [ADDRESS_227262].  High sensitivit y C-reactive protein, an indicator 
of inflammation, will be performed by [CONTACT_191116]. 
 N-telopeptide crosslinks correlate wi th the rate of bone reabsorption 
and bone mineral density in osteop erotic women and can be used to 
monitor the efficacy of anti-reabsorptive therapy with estrogen and 
calcium [Greenspan 2000].  The test is performed on serum by [CONTACT_191117].  
Mean values for women are 12.6 nM BCE/L (6.2 – 19.0 nM BCE/L).   
 
Osteocalcin is a measure of bone/reabsorption.  It together with the 
N-telopeptide is helpful in determining reduction in bone turnover in 
response to anti-reabsorptive ag ents or predicting early bone 
mineral loss after hormone therapy is stopped.  The test is 
performed on serum by [CONTACT_191118] (ICMA) assay 
[Slovik 1984]. It is best perfor med fasting as it cannot be 
performed on a lipemic specimen. 
 
The above assays will be performed at LabCorp Inc. Research 
Division or a similar CLIA -approved laboratory.   
 
Estrogen supplementation increase s high density lipoproteins and 
thus it is possible that administration of letrozole will result in a 
higher total cholesterol:HDL ratio.  We do not expect any difference 
in change in C-reactive protein,  osteocalcin, or N-telopeptide 
between letrozole an d placebo groups. 
 
10.5.4  Serum 25-OH Vitamin D Levels  
 
The cause of the increase and/or induction of joint stiffness and 
arthralgias in women taking aromatase inhibitors is not clear but may be due to estrogen deprivation in combination with suboptimal 
vitamin D levels.  Blood levels of 25-OH vitamin D are a good 
measure of vitamin D adequacy and for optimum bone and general 
health should be in the 32-50 ng/ml range [Vieth 1999; Holick 
2003; Heaney 2004].  Suboptimal or  deficient levels of 25-OH 
vitamin D are common in postmenopausal women, ranging from 25 
to 50% of those tested when 37 ng /ml is used as the lower cutoff 
[LeBoff 1999; Aguado 2000; Glowacki 2003].  Persistent pain, 
particularly in shoulders, wrists , hips, knees, legs, and ankles, as 
well as joint stiffness has been reported in 93% of individuals with 
25-OH vitamin D levels <20 ng/ml [Plotnikoff 2003].  Taylor et al. 
has recently reported in abstract form that a high proportion of 
postmenopausal women on AIs with  musculoskeletal complaints had 
vitamin D deficiency [Taylor 2004].  We will assess the effect of 
baseline and follow-up 25-OH vitamin D levels on subsequent 
development of arthralgias.   
Breast Cancer Prevention by [CONTACT_191056]# [ZIP_CODE]                 Version 1.5 – June 28, 2012                             Page 51 of 75   
All samples will be run in in KUMC’s clinical laboratory by a widely 
used RIA kit [Gunter 1988-1994]. The assay limit of detection is 1.5 
ng/ml.  Assay precision varies only slightly with vitamin D level from 
8.6 to 12.5% for run-to-run vari ation and 8.2 to 11% for between-
run variation.  
 
We do not expect any increase or decrease in 25-OH vitamin D 
levels other than that expected from seasonal variations.  However, 
low 25-OH vitamin D levels may explain development of arthralgias or an increase in bone turnover if encountered in women 
randomized to letrozole.

tools geared to the most prevalent symptoms in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].   
 
The BCPT symptom checklist is a [ADDRESS_227266] Cancer Prevention by [CONTACT_191056]# [ZIP_CODE]                 Version 1.5 – June 28, [ADDRESS_227267] four weeks.  If they answer yes, they are asked to 
grade the severity (0-4).  This tool can be used to compute a total 
score or individual or related items of interest (e.g., three items relate 
to joint stiffness and arthralgias) may be scored [Stanton 2005].  
  
The Mayo Clinic Hot Flash scoring sy stem was developed by [CONTACT_191120].  Subjects are asked about their daily number of hot flashes and rate 
usual severity from 1 to 4.  The frequency is multiplied by [CONTACT_191121] a total score [Loprinzi 2002].   
We do not expect an increase in symptoms or hot flash scores for 
women randomized to letrozole. 
 
The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (HAQ) is a validated tool 
routinely used by [CONTACT_191122], stiffness, and 
physical functioning.  Individual domains or a total score can be utilized 
in assessment [Wolfe 2004].   
 The brief fatigue inventory asks the woman to rate her current as well 
as worst and usual fatigue in the past 24 hours.  It also asks her to rate 
how the fatigue has affected mood, general activity, walking, work 
relations, and enjoyment of life [Mendoza 1999].   
 
We do not expect an increase in joint pain, stiffness or fatigue for 
women randomized to letrozole, unless a woman has suboptimal levels 
of 25-OH vitamin D.

Participant data will be collected using protocol-specific case report forms (CRF) 
developed by [CONTACT_6268]. A copy of all documents up to the month six visit will be 
mailed to KUMC as soon as they are comp leted, and the remainder as soon as the 
subject completes study.  
 
Information for data analyses will be entere d by [CONTACT_191123] (CRFs) . Data items from the CRFs will be 
entered into the the web-based CRIS study database by [CONTACT_6268]. 
 
Source document files/chart must be kept available at sites fo r monitoring visits 
during the conduct of the study through data analysis.  
 
Subsequently, the information entered into the database will be systematically 
checked by [CONTACT_94193]. Other errors or omissions will be entered on 
Data Query Forms, which will be return ed to the site trial coordinators for 
resolution. Data queries must be addresse d and returned to KUMC within [ADDRESS_227268] of reports (mammogram reports, laboratory 
reports, etc.), and forms created specifically for this study that will capture 
information such as physical exam, phone contact [CONTACT_3031], adverse 
events, concomitant medications, demo graphics, etc. To the extent which 
possible, source documents (aside from reports) wi ll be formatted to be 
similar to the CRF format, in order to make the transcription from source to 
CRF more reliable. Special laboratory CRF’s will be created to capture 
biomarker laboratory data including cytomorphology, nuclear morphometry 
mammographic density, Ki-67, serum hormone levels, osteocalcin, C-
reactive protein, fasting lipid profile and 25-OH vitamin D levels.  Data will 
be entered in an Excel spread sh eet which can be merged with the 
database held at KUMC.  
11.2    Data and Safe ty Monitoring Plan 
 
Prior to activation of the clinical trial, a Data Safety and Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) will be established. The DSMC will consist of four 
members that will be identified later: a clinical faculty member at KUMC, a 
member of the Clinical Trials Division of the Kansas Cancer Institute, and 
Breast Cancer Prevention by [CONTACT_191056]# [ZIP_CODE]                 Version 1.5 – June 28, [ADDRESS_227269] to both data and safety, as 
detailed below.    
All data collected for this trial will ultimately reside in a central database.  
The sources of data are three-fold: (1) All clinical data that originate at 
KUMC or collaborating sites are entere d onto specific Case Report Forms 
(CRFs).  The CRFs will be audited and source documents reviewed by a 
central multi-site monitor, after which the CRFs will be sent to KUMC.  The 
data are entered into the central database and audi ted/validated.  
Periodically, these data are output to  individual subject summary sheets so 
as to allow periodic assessment by [CONTACT_3433] e Protocol Chair ([CONTACT_191147]) 
and staff.  (2) Biomarker data from  the assessments at KUMC of fine 
needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_191026] (cytolog ic characterization, cytology score, 
and Ki-67 and ER immunocytochemistr y score) and mammographic breast 
density are entered onto trial specific CRFs.  Data are then entered into a 
trial specific central database.  Th ere are appropriate checks (such as 
comparison of electronic files to validated paper printouts) on data 
accuracy and completeness for all source s of data. This is accomplished via 
inspection of summary reports prepared  for the DSMC by [CONTACT_191124], [CONTACT_191148].   
The subject cohort consists of essentially healthy women who are defined 
as being at high risk for the developm ent of breast cancer, but do not have

side effects that mi ght be due to the study interv ention are expected to be 
minimal but should be easily identified and monitored. 
 
In regard to adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs), it is 
not deemed necessary for the DSMC to address these for individual 
subjects.  Rather, all grade [ADDRESS_227270] on the ability of the trial to be completed, can be 
addressed by [CONTACT_6802].  Likewise, the committee may make suggestions 
on other aspects that would improve the quality of the trial.  
11.3  Sponsor or FDA Monitoring 
 
The NCI, DCP (or their designee), phar maceutical collaborator (or their 
designee), or FDA may monitor/audit va rious aspects of the study. These 
monitors will be given access to facilities, databases, supplies and records 
to review and verify data pertinent to the study.

12.0 STATISTICAL METHODS 
 
The study is a Phase II, double-blind, rand omized, placebo-controlled clinical trial 
to assess the potential efficacy of letr ozole as a chemopreventive agent, as 
measured by [CONTACT_191127] n index (Ki-67) between baseline and 6-
months. Secondarily, the study will evaluate other pharmacodynamic properties of 
the agent and assess which biomarkers, if  any, are modulated.  Side effects, 
adverse events, and qu ality of life will also be assessed. 
 Standard randomization strategies will be employed with type of HRT (E vs E+P) 
as the only stratification factor other than institutional site so that each site can be 
provided with a unique randomization schedu le at initiation.  All eligible subjects 
will be randomly assigned to letr ozole or placebo in a 1:[ADDRESS_227272]-treat ment change in a proliferation index 
(percent of cells expressi ng Ki-67) is the basis of the power analyses.  
From our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the average perc entage of cells expressing Ki-67 at 
baseline was 6.4%, and the average chan ge in percent of cells expressing 
Ki-67 was a 3.7% reduction, for subjects meeting the same eligibility 
requirements as will be used in this proposed trial.  
 
A 1:1 randomization of 96 evaluable su bjects will provide 90% power to 
detect an effect si ze of 0.[ADDRESS_227273] deviations with a Type I error rate of 
5% using a two-sample, two-sided t-test . In other words, if one assumes a 
common standard deviation of change of 5.5% (as observed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_191028] 33 subjects matching eligibility criteria for the proposed trial) 
for both placebo and letrozole groups and if mean change for placebo is 
zero, then there will be 90% power to detect an average change of 3.7% in 
Ki-67 in the letrozole group with a Type 1 error rate of 5%.  Note that the 
3.7% reduction is what was seen in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  Using a conservative 
drop-out rate of 10% (it was 2% in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]), enrollment of [ADDRESS_227274] very little mi ssing data, however,  if the missing 
data rate is above 5%, we will use multiple imputation to impute these 
values to perform the primary and secondary analyses. 
 
The primary outcome will be change in Ki-67 (percent of cells expressing 
Ki-67) from baseline to [ADDRESS_227275] Cancer Prevention by [CONTACT_191056]# [ZIP_CODE]                 Version 1.5 – June 28, [ADDRESS_227276] density, and clinical 
laboratory tests.  We will also correlate change in the primary biomarker 
Ki-67 with change in other markers (e.g., bioavailable estradiol, pS2, 
GREB-1) using Pearson’s correlation coef ficient.  Again, if there exists a 
high degree of skewness in  these variables, Spearman’s correlation will be 
utilized. 
 
Multiple regression analysis will also be used to investigate whether 
changes in Ki-[ADDRESS_227277] (e.g., 
age, cytomorphology, Gail risk; as well as the predictive effect of other biomarkers on modulation  of Ki-67). Best subsets and stepwise approaches 
will be employed while contro lling for treatment group.  
 
For comparison of moderate or worse toxicities we will consider grade 3 
toxicity or premature trial discontinuation as the critical events.  The 
prevalence of events in the letrozole vs. the placebo arm will be examined 
by [CONTACT_3493]’s exact test.  
 
Evaluation of drug-induced hormonal changes - We will examine whether Letrozole has any effects on serum levels of bioavailable estradiol, and 
testosterone, determined at baseli ne and after six months of study 
medication. We will determine whether addition of letrozole alters the 
frequency of menopausal symptoms. 
 
Adverse Events and Quality of Life – Change from baseline to six months 
for hot flash score (Mayo Clinic), fatigue (brief fatigue inventory), overall 
quality of life (BCPCT), bone turnover markers, HDL/total cholesterol, and 
C-reactive protein will be compared between the two groups using the two-
sample t-test. Similarly, demographic variables (e.g., age, education) and 
hormonal levels will be tested for use as covariates on each of these 
endpoints.  We will also assess the effects of change in serum hormones (if 
any) and baseline 25-OH vitamin D levels on incidence and severity of 
arthralgias and fatigue. 
 
Within Letrozole Comparisons at baseli ne, 6 and 12 months - On all of our 
quantitative continuous measures we will perform a repeated measures 
analysis comparing the 6 and 12 month values to baseline  and also with 
each other.  This will give us some preliminary indication whether there is 
any benefit or detriment of 12 months of treatment.  For all the above 
analyses of exploratory endpoints, as well as for changes in proliferation, 
results from the 12-month timepoint (following six months of open-label 
treatment with active agent) will also be analyzed and compared to the 
baseline and six month values with caution since the double-blind, 
randomized nature of the comparison is no longer present. However, since

biomarkers without knowledge of tr eatment arm, the results could be 
informative. 
 
Since this is a phase IIB trial, the power and sample size for the primary 
endpoint was determined with a two-si ded type I error rate of 5%.  All 
subsequent secondary, tertiary and expl oratory analyses will also be tested 
with a two-sided type I error rate of 5%.  This may result in an elevated 
false positive rate for these second ary and tertiary analyses, however, 
since this is a Phase IIB study, we felt to control the type I error rate for the secondary, tertiary and expl oratory analyses would be too 
conservative.

Any changes made to the protocol will be  initiated by [CONTACT_36476], and 
submitted to KUMC IRB (HSC) for approval . After KUMC IRB approval, other sites 
will submit revised protocol changes to local IRB for review. 
 
The determination of the necessity to cease enrollment until revisions are 
approved will be determined by [CONTACT_36476]. 
 
[COMPANY_001] and NCI, DCP as the funder of  the study, have th e right to request 
discontinuation of the study at any time. A frequency of greater than grade 2 
adverse events (exclusive of hot flashes and menstrual irregularities) that exceeds 
20% will be cause for consideration of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]; unless there is adequate 
information to suggest that the adverse events are not re lated to the study agent.

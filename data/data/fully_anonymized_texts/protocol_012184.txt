countries, prevalence is between 1.5 and 5%.[ADDRESS_620668] on psychosocial and economic status.2  It is increasingly 
recognized that psoriasis is more than a superficial disease, with 30% of patients having joint involvement and a high correlation between psoriasis and obesity, diabetes, depression, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease.
3  While the majority of mild psoriasis patients are managed with 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_12491], those with moderate or severe and/or refractory disease usually require phototherapy and/or systemic therapy.
Oral systemic agents provide modest efficacy; therefore, patients are increasingly being treated with 
biologic agents such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors (etanercept and adalimumab), the interleukin (IL)-12/23 inhibitor (ustekinumab),
4and IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) inhibitors (secukinumab 
and ixekizumab).  Ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the common p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, was approved for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in 2009, and for 
Crohn's disease in 2016.  Secukinumab, an anti-IL-17A antibody was approved in the US for the 
treatment of psoriasis in 2015 and for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in 2016.  In addition, other recently approved systemic agents for the treatment of psoriasis include an IL-17RA inhibitor (brodalumab) and an IL-23p19 inhibitor (guselkumab), which are also under investigation for psoriatic arthritis.  Another anti-IL-23p19 antibody, tildrakizumab, has been studied in Phase [ADDRESS_620669] that IL-23 is disproportionately involved in the maintenance of 
chronic psoriasis.5  IL-23 is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of psoriasis via induction and 
maintenance of Th17 type cells, and other IL-23 responsive cells.  This is supported by [CONTACT_483084] (mAb) that block IL-17A (the cytokine produced by [CONTACT_78443]17 cells), IL-17RA, and direct blockade of IL-[ADDRESS_620670] effective anti-TNF and anti-IL-12/23 agents provide approximately 75% improvement in psoriasis in about 50 to 80% of patients and these responses can be lost over time.  While the anti-IL-17A, -IL-17RA, and -IL-23p19 agents (i.e., secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab and guselkumab) may provide better efficacy than anti-TNF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_82620], they require monthly or every other month injections.

Risankizumab is currently being developed for the treatment of psoriasis (Phase 3 studies concluded) and Crohn's disease (currently in Phase 3 studies) and the treatment of ulcerative colitis, psoriatic 
arthritis, and asthma (in Phase 2 studies).  Risankizumab is a humanized mAb of the immunoglobin

Fcγreceptor and complement binding and potential charge heterogeneity.  Risankizumab binds with 
high affinity to human IL-23.
The current study compares the safety and efficacy of risankizumab vs. secukinumab in subjects with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  For a more detailed description of the risankizumab drug profile, 
refer to the latest version of the investigator's brochure (IB).[ADDRESS_620671] version of the approved labeling information in your 
country.
Clinical Hypothesis
Risankizumab will be superior to secukinumab in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in 
the achievement of ≥ 90% reduction from baseline Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI 90) at Week 52 
and will be non-inferior to secukinumab in the achievement of PASI 90 at week 16 with non-inferiority 
margin of 12%.
2.[ADDRESS_620672] shown that risankizumab has minimal inhibitory effects on IL-12, the inhibition of 
which has been associated with increased risk of serious infections.
11,12  Selective IL-23 inhibition may 
not increase risk of serious infection, including mycobacterial infections.13
In Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of risankizumab in patients with psoriasis, the majority of subjects receiving risankizumab achieved 90% improvement of their disease and risankizumab was well tolerated.  Recently, positive top-line results were observed from [ADDRESS_620673] a 90% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) and a static physician global assessment (sPGA) score of clear or almost clear (sPGA 0 or 1) for risankizumab (150 mg) treatment vs. ustekinumab, placebo and adalimumab.
14-16  The safety profile was 
consistent with that observed in Phase 2 clinical trials, with no important identified risks for risankizumab.  As with many immune modulating agents, risankizumab may impair immune function 
resulting in a risk of infection.  This will be monitored by [CONTACT_483085].  In addition, subjects with active infection will not be included in the study.
IL-23 inhibition is not known to increase the risk of tuberculosis (TB) infection or impair the response to 
TB infection in animal models.  No cases of active TB were reported across all risankizumab studies.  
Across all Phase 3 psoriasis studies, of the 71 subjects with latent tuberculosis (TB) who were concurrently treated with risankizumab and appropriate TB prophylaxis treatment, none developed active TB during the mean follow-up of 67.9 weeks.  In 2 Phase 3 psoriasis studies (Studies M15-992 and M15-997), of 31 subjects with latent TB at screening who did not receive prophylaxis during the study, none developed active TB over a mean follow-up of 58.5 weeks.  Thus, low risk subjects with positive QuantiFERON®-TB Gold testing do not need to be treated with antituberculosis therapy prior to

address the label of secukinumab, subjects with latent TB may only be randomized to this trial if 
sufficient treatment has been initiated according to local routine clinical practice (please refer to the TB 
Screen section of the Operations Manual for further guidance).
There is not enough information at this time to rule out a risk of cancer with risankizumab, but this risk 
is considered small with this type of compound as experience with the anti-IL-12/[ADDRESS_620674] safety.
Increases in major adverse cardiovascular (MACE) events, including myocardial infarction, 
cerebrovascular accident, and cardiovascular death, were initially reported with anti-IL-12/23 agents, 
such as ustekinumab, although an increased incidence of MACE events was not observed in longer term studies.  While the likelihood of increased MACE is small, all suspected cardiovascular events (serious or non-serious) observed in this study will be adjudicated.  An independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee (CAC) will be adjudicating all observed cardio- and cerebro-vascular events and will remain blinded to treatment allocation (Section 6.2).  Although Study M16-766 is an open-label study, 
information for adjudication purposes will be provided to the CAC in a blinded manner to ensure unbiased assessment.
Local reactions to subcutaneously (SC) administered biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_483082], and are usually 
limited to redness, swelling, or induration at the injection site.  Manifestations of systemic hypersensitivity reactions include anaphylaxis, pruritus, hypotension, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506].  Both local and systemic hypersensitivity reactions are usually readily detectable, transient in nature, and manageable with standard medical treatment.  Subjects will be closely monitored during study drug administration.  An independent Anaphylaxis Adjudication Committee (AAC) will be adjudicating 
observed systemic hypersensitivity and anaphylactic events.  The AAC will remain blinded to treatment 
allocation (Section 6.3).
There are no important identified risks for risankizumab.

In conclusion, the benefit-risk profile of risankizumab is considered appropriate for this stage of clinical development.

3.1 Objectives
The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab compared with 
secukinumab for the treatment of adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy.
3.2 Primary Endpoint
The 2 primary endpoints are:
!Proportion of subjects achieving a PASI 90 response at Week 52; superiority of risankizumab vs. secukinumab.
!Proportion of subjects achieving a PASI 90 response at Week 16; non-inferiority of risankizumab vs. secukinumab with non-inferiority margin of 12%.
3.3 Secondary Endpoints
The multiplicity-controlled key secondary endpoints are:
!Proportion of subjects achieving a PASI 100 response at Week 52; superiority of risankizumab vs. secukinumab;
!Proportion of subjects achieving an sPGA 0 or 1 at Week 52; superiority of risankizumab vs. secukinumab;
!Proportion of subjects achieving a PASI 75 response at Week 52; superiority of risankizumab vs. secukinumab.
Other efficacy endpoints include change and percent change from baseline in PASI and body surface area (BSA) as well as multiple levels of PASI and sPGA responses at all visits.
3.4 Safety Parameters

Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive risankizumab or secukinumab in a 1:1 ratio.  The study is 
designed to randomize approximately 310 subjects (155 subjects/arm).  Participants randomized to receive secukinumab will receive 2 injections of active secukinumab (300 mg total dosage) subcutaneously at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then every 4 weeks (q4w) thereafter until the last dose at Week 48.  Participants randomized to receive risankizumab will receive 2 injections of active risankizumab (150 mg total dosage) subcutaneously at Weeks 0 and 4, and then every 12 weeks (q12w) thereafter until the last dose at Week 40.  Subjects in [LOCATION_009] who were randomized to risankizumab will 
have two additional dosing visits at Week [ADDRESS_620677] based on the results of the analysis.  Efficacy accessors will remain blinded for the duration of the study.

criteria relating to safety guarantee that subjects enrolled can safely be treated with risankizumab based on the current knowledge of this drug.
Selection of Doses in the Study
The selected dose for risankizumab is aligned with the dose tested in Phase [ADDRESS_620679] labeling for 
the treatment of plaque psoriasis.
Blinded Efficacy Assessor
A qualified physician (may be a non-dermatologist) or designee (may be a non-physician) from the site will be responsible for performing the efficacy assessments, including PASI, BSA, and sPGA at all
appropriate study visits ( Table 1 ).  The site will make every attempt to have the same qualified physician 
or designee perform these assessments throughout the study for each subject.  The efficacy assessor 
must remain blinded to patient's treatment, clinical laboratory results, and all subject safety data during the course of the study.  The efficacy assessor will not view or discuss any subject specific safety data with the investigators or any other site personnel, with the exception of the dermatologic safety findings requiring urgent medical attention.  The efficacy assessor therefore cannot be the Principal Investigator.  The efficacy assessor will not access patient's electronic case report form (eCRF) and will document the dermatologic assessments and potential dermatologic safety findings on paper worksheets that will be filed as source in the patient's record.  It is recommended that each study site has a designated back-up for the efficacy assessor.

to be dispensed at the subject's corresponding study visit.  All blank spaces on the label will be completed by [CONTACT_339885].  Study drug will only be used for the conduct of this study.  Instructions for drug preparation will be provided by [CONTACT_26282].
5.8 Randomization/Drug Assignment
Each subject will be assigned a unique identification number by [CONTACT_117946].  For subjects who rescreen, the screening number assigned by [CONTACT_110991].  Subjects may only be rescreened one time.  The IRT will assign a randomization number that will 
encode the subject's treatment group assignment according to the randomization schedule generated by [CONTACT_66771].  Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups:
!Group 1:  Risankizumab 150 mg (N = 155)
!Group 2:  Secukinumab 300 mg (N = 155)
The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_8497] ( ≤ 100 kg vs. > 100 kg) and prior systemic biologic for 
psoriasis.
This is an open-label study; however, the efficacy assessor will remain blinded to each subject's 
treatment, clinical laboratory results, and all subject safety data during the course of the study.
In the event of a medical emergency in which the Investigator believes that knowledge of study drug 
treatment is required for the efficacy assessor, reasonable efforts must be made to contact [CONTACT_483088].
The date and reason that the efficacy assessor's blind was broken must be recorded in the source 
documentation and eCRF, as applicable.

Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse events on a 
routine basis throughout the study.  All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] or CRO (as 
appropriate) as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event:
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26182]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to include 
experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).

prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
All adverse events reported from the time of study drug administration until 140 days or 5 half-lives 
(taking both risankizumab and secukinumab half-lives into consideration) after discontinuation of study 
drug administration will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_423].  In addition, serious adverse events and protocol-related non-serious adverse events will be collected from the time the subject signs the study-specific informed consent.
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) reporting for 
the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in accordance with global and local guidelines.
Areas of Safety Interest
Infections, especially opportunistic infections, are a theoretical risk with immunomodulators.  Subjects 
will be screened and monitored throughout the study for Areas of Safety Interest (ASI) ( Table 3 ).  
Screening procedures are outlined in the Activity Schedule ( Appendix D ).
If any of the following serious adverse events (SAEs) are reported, then the following supplemental 
report must be completed.

7 STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The objectives of the statistical analyses are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab versus secukinumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis both short- and long-term.
For ease of description, Period A refers to Week 0 – 16, and Period B refers to the rest of the study.The Primary Analysis for all efficacy endpoints pertaining to Period A will be conducted after all 
continuing subjects completed Week 16 and all data pertaining to Period A are cleaned and when a database lock will occur to enable the analysis.  This is the one and final efficacy analysis for Period A.  The results will be included in an interim clinical study report (CSR) to support the efficacy and safety evaluation of the initial 16 weeks of treatment.
p. 28 of 42
STUDY M16-766  |  Version 1.1 ([LOCATION_009] Only)  |  EudraCT 2017-004932-[ADDRESS_620701] completed Week 52 and all data pertaining to Week 52 are cleaned and when a database lock will occur to enable the analysis.
The efficacy assessors will remain blinded for the duration of the entire study.The statistical analyses will be described and fully documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The 
SAP will be finalized prior to the database lock for the Primary Analysis for Period A.  Complete and specific details of the statistical analyses will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan Supplement (SAP-S), which will be finalized prior to database lock for the Primary Analysis for Period A as well.  The statistical analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]).
7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population will be used for the efficacy analyses.
The ITT Population is defined as all subjects who are randomized at Baseline.
The following populations will be used for safety analysis:
!The Safety Population is defined as all subjects who are randomized at Baseline and received at 
least one dose of study drug.
!The All Risankizumab Treated (All_RZB) Population is defined as subjects who receive at least one dose of risankizumab in the study.
In order to evaluate the impact of major protocol violations on the primary efficacy endpoint in Period A, additional sensitivity analyses will be performed on a Per-protocol Population, which excludes subjects with major protocol deviations that potentially affect the primary efficacy endpoints.  The criteria for exclusion of subjects from the Per-protocol Population will be fully defined in the classification plan and the exclusion of subjects from the Per-protocol Population for the analysis in Period A will be finalized before the database lock.  Additional sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint in Period B may be performed if deemed necessary.
7.[ADDRESS_620702] adjusting for the stratification factors.  For the primary analysis, Non-Responder Imputation (NRI) will be used.  The analysis will be repeated using last observation carried forward (LOCF) and Multiple Imputation (MI).

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].A graphic approach will be utilized for multiplicity control.  Details of multiplicity control and analyses 
methods are provided in the SAP.  Specifically, the initial alpha spending between the two primary endpoints will be 0.0375 for Period A, and 0.0125 for Period B.
Sample Size Estimation
The assumptions for the secukinumab Week 16 and Week 52 PASI 90 response rates of 69.7% and 60.6%, respectively, are based on weighted average from secukinumab studies SCULPTURE, ERASURE, FIXTURE, JUNCTURE, and CLEAR.  The assumptions for the risankizumab Week 16 and Week 52 PASI 90 
response rates of 75.1% and 81.3%, respectively, are based on weighted average from UltiMMa-[ADDRESS_620703] of secukinumab versus placebo in 
PASI 90 response rate at Week 16.  A 12% non-inferiority margin preserves 80% of the treatment effect 
of secukinumab over placebo.
Approximately 310 subjects (155 subjects per treatment group) will provide more than 90% power to 
detect the difference of risankizumab and secukinumab at Week 52 using a two-sided alpha level of 
0.0125, and 90% power to determine the non-inferiority of risankizumab relative to secukinumab using a tolerance limit of 12% and a two-sided alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_620704] at the respective study visits.  
Additional analyses combining PK, ADA, and NAb data from this study and other studies may be 
conducted if appropriate.
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
All safety analyses will be performed in the safety populations.
Pre-treatment AEs will be summarized separately.
All treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs leading to 
discontinuation, and Areas of Safety Interest (ASI) will be collected during the study.  A treatment-
emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as an event with onset or worsening after the first study dose of study 
drug and within [ADDRESS_620705] dose of injection for risankizumab or secukinumab administrations.  The number and percentages of subjects experiencing TEAE will be tabulated using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) system organ class and preferred term.  Summaries (including percentages and event per 100 patient-year) of SAEs, deaths, AEs leading to discontinuation, and Areas of Safety Interest will be provided as well.  For selected laboratory and vital signs parameters, mean change from baseline and percentage of subject with evaluations meeting pre-defined criteria for Potentially Clinically Important values will be summarized.

!Extend the study to provide two additional dosing visits at Week 52 and Week 64 for active 
subjects on risankizumab in [LOCATION_009] only (Section 1, Synopsis; Section 4.1, Overall Study Design 
and Plan and Figure 1 , Appendix D , Activity Schedule).
Rationale: Provide continued risankizumab therapy to subjects who were randomized to 
risankizumab and successfully completed the study until risankizumab is available in [LOCATION_009].  Data from the IMMhance study (Study M15-992) showed that patients receiving continuous risankizumab treatment had significantly longer median time to relapse compared with those who withdrew risankizumab (and received placebo).
!Revise wording on timing of the primary analysis for all efficacy endpoints in Period B (Section 7.1, Statistical and Analytical Plans).
Rationale: To clarify that the timing of the planned primary analysis of all efficacy endpoints in 
Period B has not changed.
!Add Week 64 measurements for prior/concomitant therapy, vital signs, adverse event assessment, local urine pregnancy test, central laboratory tests (clinical chemistry, hematology), and central lab – TB screening ( Appendix D , Activity Schedule).
Rationale:  To continue to monitor routine safety parameters.  
!Add that no dose of risankizumab will be administered at the PD visit ( Appendix D , Activity 
Schedule Footnote a).
!Rationale:  To clarify that additional dosing of risankizumab has been added to Week 52/PD 
visit; however this should only apply to the Week 52 and not the PD visit.
In addition to these modifications, this amendment contains the following minor change:
!Update contact [CONTACT_483089] ( Appendix C , List of Protocol Signatories).
!Correct minor clerical errors for consistency throughout the protocol.

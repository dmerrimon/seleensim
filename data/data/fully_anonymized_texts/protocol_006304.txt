I. Background and Significance  
Recent data estimate that over 80% of children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer will become long -term 
survivors, thereby [CONTACT_9851] a growing patient population with increasing medical and psychosocial needs. The 
Children’s Oncology Group (COG) recommends that survivors participate in continuous long term follow -up (LTFU) 
survivor care across the lifespan to monitor for late effects of treatment . Chronic health conditions and late effects 
of treatment impact over 60% of adult survivors of childhood c ancer and over 25% of survivors have severe or 
life-threatening conditions. Ongoing survivor care and surveillance tests are essential for adolescents and young 
adult (AYA )survivors because many late effects do not emerge until years after treatment, and late effects of 
childhood cancer treatment place survivors at an 8.4 times higher risk for mortality as compared to age - and sex -
matched U.S. population. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_682573], less than 50% of young adult survivors ages 18 -24 years 
are adherent wi th cancer -related medical care and less than 20% had a survivor visit at a cancercenter in the past 
[ADDRESS_924422] been published to date.  
Figure 1. SMART Model - Social - 
Page 4 of 19 
Protocol Version 7   Date: 10 -18-23 Given the lack of empi[INVESTIGATOR_682574], 
Schwartz et. al (2013) pediatric cancer survivors to adult survivor care, we 
pulled from an empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675] -based, stakeholder supported theoretical 
framework for childhood cancer survivor transition to guide the development 
of our aims. Schwartz et al. (2013) published on the valid ation process of the 
SocialEcological Model of Adolescent and Young Adult Readiness to Transition  
(SMART)  (Figure 1). The SMART model synthesized the available empi[INVESTIGATOR_682575]. The SMART model 
is comprised of “preexisting factors” which may impact transition readiness 
and transfer success but are not likely to be altered by [CONTACT_682587] (i.e., 
demographics, neurocognition, etc.), as well as “modifiable variables” which 
may be beneficial targets for intervention to improve transi tion outcomes 
(i.e., knowledge, self -efficacy, health beliefs, psychosocial functioning, etc). 
The SMART model also recognizes that transition to adult survivor care is a 
complicated process involving not only patient -factors, but parent and 
provider relat ed factors as well.  
Overall, the proposed study addresses significant questions currently 
unanswered in the literature and takes an empi[INVESTIGATOR_682576]. At the end of  
this award, we will know which social -ecological factors to target to improve transition readiness and adherence  
to adult survivor health care.  Moving forward, these findings will inform the development of extramural grant 
applications to fund the implementation and evaluation of evidence -based interventions designed to facilitate 
successful transition to adult survivor care.  
Preliminary Data.  Our team has sought to assess and measure health self -management and perceptions of 
transition readiness by [CONTACT_682588] (RTQ) for use with AYA survivors of 
childhood cancers and their parents. The RTQ was originally developed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_682577]’s Healthcare of Atlanta and was tailored to assess overall transition readiness (RTQ -Overall), 
AYA healthcare responsibility (RTQ -AR), and parent involvement in  pediatric survivor healthcare (RTQ -PI). In a 
recent review of transition readiness measures, the RTQ was one of only 10 measures meeting criteria for 
“promising” assessment as defined by [CONTACT_682589] 54 EvidenceBased 
Assessment Task Force. To evaluate the use of the tailored RTQ within the AYA childhood cancer survivor 
population, we recruited AYA survivors (N=74) ages 14 to 21 and their parents (N=68). The preliminary  
psychometric properties of the RTQ appear to be suppo rted within the AYA pediatric cancer survivor population,  
including internal consistency (Cronbach’s alphas=.80 -.90), convergent validity, and construct validity.  
To evaluate healthcare responsibility among our young adult survivor patients, we collected pi[INVESTIGATOR_26923] N=41 
childhood cancer survivors ages 18 -21 years -old participating pediatric survivor care. Although these survivors 
will be transferring to adult c are in the next 1 -2 years, over half of patients reported that their parents were  
primarily responsible for their healthcare (56.2%) and that parents were almost always involved in the scheduling  
of survivor medical appointments (63.4%).  As young adult pati ents transfer out of pediatric care , it will be 

Page 5 of 19 
Protocol Version 7   Date: 10 -18-23 important to clearly understand the role of parents and family in the transition process and create interventions 
that target all parties involved in survivors’ health management.  
 II. Goals/Aims Overview  
The objectives  of this study are to clarify: what  are the most salient social -ecological risk and resilience factors 
that should serve as targets for interventions and who  are the survivors most at risk to be recruited for future 
interventions, how  survivors want to receive educational interventions, and which  educational interventions are 
most effective. Using a cross -sectional cohort study of 18 -25 year old childhood cancer survivors and/or their 
parents, this study will determine predictors of transition  readiness (Aim 1) and predictors of adherence to adult 
survivor -focused healthcare (Aim 2), as well as evaluate the quality (Aim 3) and efficacy (Aim 4) of electronic 
educational interventions for AYA survivors. The specific aims are to:  
Aim 1:  Evaluate social -ecological factors among AYA childhood cancer survivors participating in pediatric survivor  
care  to determine factors associated with decreased transition readiness (i.e., risk factors) and increased 
transition readiness (i.e., resilience factors), as well as characterize patterns of co -occurring risk factors associated 
with transition readiness.  
Aim 2:  Evaluate social -ecological factors among AYA childhood cancer survivors following transfer  to identify 
factors associated non -adherence (i.e., risk factors) and adherence (i.e., resilience factors) to adult survivor care, 
as well as characterize patterns of co -occurring risk factors associated with non -adherence to adult survivor care.  
Aim 3 : Develop and assess quality of electronic multimedia materials to educate AYA survivors about lifelong 
survivor care through qualitative interviews with AYAs.  
Aim 4 : Evaluate the impact of electronic educational materials on AYA survivors’ knowledge about late effects, 
perceived benefits, self -efficacy, and intentions to engage in lifelong survivor care.  
 III. Study Design  
This is a mixed methods study involving cohorts of 18 -25 year old childhood cancer survivors and/or their parents 
to determine predictors of transition readiness among those engaged in pediatric survivor care (Aim 1), predictors 
of adherence to adult survi vor-focused healthcare among those who have transferred out of pediatrics (Aim 2), 
and optimize content, format, and delivery of electronic educational media to increase knowledge about and 
motivation for survivor care among AYA survivors (Aims 3 & 4). Thr ough our design and methods, we are seeking 
to clarify what are the most salient social -ecological risk and resilience factors that should serve as targets for 
interventions, as well as what patterns exist among co -occurring risk factors that maximize pati ents’ risk for poor 
transition outcomes. The planned approach to accomplish our specific aims will employ both quantitative and 
qualitative methods to test the following hypotheses:  
Aim 1 Hypotheses:  
• A1 Hypothesis 1 : AYA healthcare responsibility, survivor health beliefs, and developmental maturity will be 
significantly related to increased perceptions of transition readiness.  
Page 6 of 19 
Protocol Version 7   Date: 10 -18-23 • A1 Hypothesis 2 : AYA psychosocial distress, poorer neurocognitive functioning, and deprived 
neighborhoodlevel social determinants will be significantly related to decreased perceptions of transition 
readiness.  
• A1 Hypothesis 3 : The relationship between parental involvement in survivor healthcare and perceptions of 
transition readiness will be mediated by [CONTACT_682590].  
• A1 Hypothesis 4 : When individual transition readiness risk factors are included in principal component 
analyses (PCA), 2 or more components will emerge indicating subgroups at risk for poor transition outcomes.  
Aim 2 Hypotheses:   
• A2 Hypothesis 1 : Survivor health beliefs, developmental maturity, and healthcare responsibility will predict 
adherence to adult survivor care.  
• A2 Hypothesis 2 : Parental involvement in survivor healthcare will predict adherence to survivor care; this 
relationship will be stronger for survivors with higher psychosocial distress, as well as lower levels of 
developmental maturity and neurocognitive functioning.  
• A2 Hypothesis 3 : Access to care problems (e.g., geographical distance, insurance) and lower patient 
satisfaction will negatively predict adherence to initial survivor care.  
• A2 Hypothesis 4 : When individual risk factors for non -adherence are included in principal component analyses 
(PCA), 2 or more components will emerge indicating subgroups at risk for poor transition outcomes.  
Aim 3 Hypothesis:   
• A3 Hypothesis: Stakeholder input and review of electronic media developed in this study using qualitative 
methods will increase acceptability and value to AYA survivors of childhood cancer  
Aim 4 Hypotheses:   
• A4 Hypothesis 1: Exposure to multimedia educational materials will significantly increase AYA survivors’ 
knowledge about late effects and surveillance.  
• A4 Hypothesis 2: Exposure to multimedia educational materials will significantly increase AYA survivors’ 
perceived benefits of, self -efficacy to, and intentions to engage in survivor care across the lifespan.  
A. Outcomes  
For Aim 1, our metrics of “transition readiness” will be determined by [CONTACT_4676] - and parent -reported scores from 
the Readiness for Transition Questionnaire (RTQ -Overall). The RTQ -Overall assesses perceived preparedness to 
transfer both healthcare responsibility (from parent to teen) and services (from pediatric to adult care), with 
higher scores indicating increased tran sition readiness. For Aim 2, we will operationalize “adherence to adult 
survivor -focused healthcare” as the attendance of at least one healt hcare visit with an adult provider focused on 
survivorship within [ADDRESS_924423] -level of the electronic educational materials. For Aim 4, AYA health beliefs, knowledge 
Page 7 of 19 
Protocol Version 7   Date: 10 -18-23 about survivor care and late -effects, patient activation, and self -efficacy and intentions to engage in lifelong 
survivor care will be evaluated using patient reported outcome (PRO) measures. In addition, a 15 -item multiple 
choice quiz will be utilized to assess participants’ knowledge of the content covered in the electronic educational 
materials.  
B. Setting & Participants  
The clinical research aspects of this project will occur through Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta’s Aflac Cancer 
Survivor Program (CSP). Eligible participants will be patients of the Aflac Cancer Survivor Program and identified 
for recruitment using Aflac CSP clinical databases. Participants’ CHOA electronic medical records will also be 
reviewed. The staff from the Aflac Cancer Center’s Clinical Research Office has extensive experience in 
coordinating and managing clinical research projects with childhood c ancer survivors. The Aflac CSP was 
established in 2001 and currently follows over 850 pediatric cancer survivors each year. This program consists of 
a multidisciplinary team (oncology, endocrinology, and pediatric psychology) who see patients for annual 
longterm follow -up survivor care beginning when the survivor is two years off therapy. Per CHOA policy, the Aflac 
CSP must transition patients to adult providers prior to age 22; however, patients are provided with the option to 
transition between the ages o f 19 and 21 years.  
For this study, we will be recruiting all eligible young adult survivor patients and/or one of their parents/caregivers. 
Participant inclusion criteria are as follows, patients  must be 18 -25 years of age, diagnosed with cancer at ≤ 18 
years of age, ≥ [ADDRESS_924424] 2 years 
(Aims 1, 3, & 4) or transitioned out of the Aflac CSP to adult survivor care since 2013 (Aims 2, 3, & 4). Although 
our goal is to enroll patient -parent dyads fo r Aims 1 & 2, patients and/or parents will be recruited individually and 
either may choose to participate or not to participate. Patient ineligibility will not impact parent eligibility and 
vice versa. Patients and/or parents will be excluded from particip ation in the study if the participant is non -English 
speaking. Young adult survivors who are cognitively impaired and unable to complete the questionnaires will be 
excluded. Any eligible subjects for Aims 3 & 4 will be excluded if they do not consent to th e recording of their 
interviews.  
Patients will be excluded from participation in the study if patient is non -English speaking (as survey battery is 
available in English only). No patients will be excluded because of gender. We anticipate that at least 50% of our 
population will be women. Within the oncology division of the Aflac Cancer Center where our research will be 
conducted, the reported ethnic/racial distribution of patients is: White (62%), Black or African American (26%), 
Asian (4%), Other (7%); 13% are persons of Hispanic or Latin o origin. No patients will be excluded because of race 
or ethnicity. Adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood cancer who are 18 -25 years of age during the 
study enrollment periods will be eligible to participate, along with their parents. No minor s who are under the 
age of 18 years will be included in this study.   
C. Procedures & Recruitment  
Each family that has been identified from our institutional survivor database and screened for eligibility will be 
contact[CONTACT_65312], email, or in survivor clinic by [CONTACT_682591]. Patient names, post mailing addresses, phone numbers, and emails will be collected 
from EPIC and program databases.  
Page 8 of 19 
Protocol Version 7   Date: 10 -18-23 Aims 1 & 2.  All eligible participants will be emailed by [CONTACT_74562]/or receive a printed recruitment letter in 
the postal mail before being contact[CONTACT_3012]. The initial recruitment email will be sent to eligible participants 
containing an email link to a s ecure electronic consent and survey battery via CHOA’s secure, webbased Research 
Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)  platform. The printed recruitment letter will also contain information on how 
to access the secure electronic consent and survey battery via t he Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) 
platform. Two additional follow -up recruitment emails will be sent at two week intervals. After three unsuccessful 
email attempts to recruit participants, email recruitment will be discontinued. One week followi ng email and mail 
recruitment, research staff will initiate phone recruitment. After three unsuccessful phone attempts to recruit 
participants, phone recruitment will be discontinued. Phone script, letter text, and email text are attached with 
this protoco l.  
The consent process will be completed online prior to completing any study questionnaires. The initial page of 
the REDCAP survey will contain a brief written consent outlining the purpose of the study, its voluntary nature, 
time commitment, incentive infor mation, release of PHI, and contact [CONTACT_682592] [INVESTIGATOR_682578] a 
participant have questions. To record participants’ consent to participate, we will have them click a radio button 
labeled “Yes, I agree to take part” or “No, I do not want to tak e part”. We will also have participants insert the 
current date. Participants who select “Yes, I agree to take part” will be routed to the study survey battery following 
their typed signature. Participants who select “No, I do not want to take part” will e xit the REDCap system and 
route to a screen that thanks them for their consideration. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_682579].   
There will be instances where only one email address or phone number is available in our records (e.g., patient or 
parent). Once a participant consents and begins the survey, we will ask: 1.) patients for parents’ contact 
[CONTACT_682593] 2.) parents for patients’ contact [CONTACT_3031]. Participants may elect not to share this 
additional contact [CONTACT_3031].  
Aims 3 & 4.  We will utilize a mixed methods design to gather data to consider and revise our AYA electronic 
educational tools as outlined in Table 1.

For Aim 3, eligible stakeholders will be recruited (N=20 AYA survivors) via phone or in clinic by a member of the  
Aflac Cancer Survivor Research team, and survivors interested in participating will be verbally consented via 
WebEx. Example questions are outlined in Table 3. These stakeholder reviews will be used to inform revisions to 
the infographics and videos, which  will be made prior to engaging in Aim 4.  
For Aim 3 and 4, all interviews will be recorded for transcription/qualitative data analysis.  
The consent and interview processes in Aim [ADDRESS_924425]’s webex 
interview; therefore, this consent discussion will be recorded. All Aim [ADDRESS_924426] has provided recording consent (for 
documentation purposes). Next, all subjects will have to confirm their identity (for security and data validity 
purposes) by [CONTACT_682594] a nd date of birth. The information provided by [CONTACT_682595]. Subjects will then go over the main study and 
verbally consent for their participation in it.  
For Aim 4, we will recruit a total of N=58 AYA survivors to evaluate our revised electronic educational materials 
(eligibility requirements described above). Recruitment procedures will be the same as in Aim 3 except that in 
Aim 4, subjects will review and  complete consent online as in Aims 1 & 2. The initial page of the REDCap survey 
will contain a brief online consent outlining the purpose of the study, its voluntary nature, time commitment,  
Page 10 of 19 
Protocol Version 7   Date: [ADDRESS_924427] participants’ consent to participate, we will have them click a radio button labeled “Yes, I 
agree to take part” or “No, I do not want to take part”. We will also have participants insert the current date. 
Participants who select “Yes, I agree to take part” will be routed to the study survey battery following their typed 
signature. Participants who select “No, I do not want to ta ke part” will exit the REDCap system and route to a 
screen that thanks them for their consideration. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_682580].   
After consenting to Aim 4, participants will be asked to complete an online pre -test survey via REDCap.  The pre -
test will be the first step in a survey queue from REDCap. After subjects complete the pretest, the queue will 
allow them to review the materia ls that were created for Aim [ADDRESS_924428] survey 
to be completed in REDCap two weeks after material is reviewed (the date when initial survey queue is 
completed).  
These pre - and post -tests will be designed to assess AYA health beliefs, knowledge about survivor care and 
lateeffects, and self -efficacy and intentions to engage in lifelong survivor care. We have selected scales to assess 
participants’ health beliefs and  intentions (Table 3, and will generate a 15 -item multiple -choice quiz to assess 
participants’ knowledge of the content covered in the electronic educational materials). The pre - and post -test 
should take approximately [ADDRESS_924429] the option to participate in telephone exit interviews 
via Zoom (N=25), lasting [ADDRESS_924430]. Example questions are outlined in Table 3. 
Following the completion of the AYA testing and interviewing, the electronic educational materials will be 
revised again using the quantitative and qualitative data collected as a gui de to inform the revisions prior to 
dissemination.

 IV . Risks, Benefits, & Incentives  
This research will inform the development of behavioral interventions designed to help future young adult 
survivors remain adherence with survivor healthcare. Potential risk is minimal, and relates to data privacy where 
the study subject’s identity and/or medical information may become known by [CONTACT_682597]. Participants may choose not to answer a question for any reason.         
Gift card incentives will be given to participants upon completion survey batteries for Aim 1 ($20) and Aim 2 
($20). An additional $[ADDRESS_924434] release to authorize us to rev iew their medical records of the adult providers they transitioned their 
survivor care.  
Stakeholders who complete a 1 -hour, semi -structured interview will be provided with a $50 incentive (Aim3). 
Each participant in Aim 4 will receive a $[ADDRESS_924435] surveys 
(total=$50), as well as a $[ADDRESS_924436]  for completing an exit interview (total=$75).  
If participants would prefer to donate their incentives, we will provide them the option to donate it toward meal 
tickets for Aflac patient families in need.  
 V. Data Management & Confidentiality  
Participant identifying information will be recorded in a secure Access database for the purposes of recruitment.  
Participants in Aim 1, Aim 2, and Aim 4 will complete all survey measures in  Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta’s 
REDCap ( http://project -redcap.org/ ), which is a secure, web -based application for building and managing online 
surveys and databases.  REDCap is HIPAA compliant and designed to support data capture for research studies, 
providing an intuitive interface for validated data entry; audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export 
procedures; automated export procedures for seamless dat a downloads to statistical software packages; and 
procedures for importing data from external sources. Unique participant identification numbers will be assigned 
and maintained throughout the database management system to ensure accuracy and protect confi dentiality. 
Outside of the secure REDCap platform & Access database, files will be linked by [CONTACT_117789]. To calculate  
neighborhood -level social determinants, mailing addresses from the Access database will be linked to 9 -digit zip 
codes using the ArcGIS software program on Woodruff Health Science library computers. On the basis of the 9 -
digit zip codes, the Area Deprivati on Index (ADI) rank will be assigned based on residential Census block group 
and the Environmental Justice Index (EJI) rank will be assigned based on residential Census tract using the ArcGIS 
program. All databases will be HIPAA -compliant and password protected. All statistical analyses for Aims 1 and 2 
will be conducted using SAS, SPSS® Statistics, or R.  
Page 14 of 19 
Protocol Version 7   Date: 10 -18-23 Study data for Aims 3 and 4 will be collected and managed using WebEx and Zoom (AYA interviews) electronic 
tools hosted at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta and Emory University.  AYA survivors’ qualitative responses to 
the teleconference interview question s will be audio -recorded using the secure and HIPAA compliant WebEx (or 
Zoom) platform and then transcribed. All subjects will confirm their identity prior to the consenting process. 
Unique participant identification numbers will be assigned to ensure accu racy and protect confidentiality. All 
databases will be HIPAA -compliant and password protected. All statistical analyses for Aims 3 and 4 will be 
conducted using SAS, SPSS® Statistics, or NVivo.  
No biological specimens will be collected as part of this research. Participants’ electronic medical records will be 
reviewed to abstract treatment data. Confidentiality within this study will be rigidly maintained. Computer files 
will use study identifica tion numbers only and are password protected.  Only necessary personnel will have access 
to any of these files. Based on existing best practices for security and privacy in health information technology, 
we will identify the technologies and features to be  employed to ensure privacy and security of personal 
information. This will address identity and access management, secure storage, secure messaging, encryption, 
and other security technologies and approaches.  
 VI. Statistical Analysis Plan   
Aims 1 & 2: In 2015, the Aflac Cancer Survivor Program (Aflac CSP) saw over 200 AYA survivors aged 18 -22 years 
(Aim 1). Additionally, the Aflac CSP has transitioned approximately N=165 survivor patients since 2013 (Aim 2). 
Based on our previous research wi th survivor patients > 18 years of age, we estimate that less than 2% of AYAs 
will be non -English speakers. During the year -long study period, we anticipate that there will be at least N=[ADDRESS_924437] N=[ADDRESS_924438] yielded initial recruitment rates and 
retention rates above 80%. Of the eligible AYA patients, we estimate that 75% [Aim 1: N=220 patient -parent dyads 
(440 participants), Aim 2: N=120 patient -parent dyads (240 participants), Aim 3: N= 20 patients, Aim 4: N=58] will 
participate in each aim of the study. In our univariate analysis, these sample sizes provide us with at least 80% or 
greater power to detect correlations of magnitude ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_924439] 2.5, depending on the 
prevalence of the risk factor, assuming that approximately 20 -30% of patients meet our definition of successful 
transition. Power analyses were conducted using PASS v. 11 (Kaysville, UT) using a two -sided test for a single 
correlation and a two sample Z -test for proportions. Given these anticipated numbers, we can assess at most [ADDRESS_924440] transition readiness and 
transition to adult survivor care. Because there are many candidate predictors and overlap between variables 
with respective substantive mea ning, predictors are likely to be highly correlated (i.e., neurocognition and 
developmental maturity). Therefore, we propose a three -step modeling process to identify general groups or 
constructs associated with the outcomes of interest. First, in a univar iate analysis setting, we will investigate the 
relationship between each potential predictor and the continuous outcome transition readiness using simple 
linear regression and correlation analysis. Similarly, we will use Chi -square tests and/or logistic re gression to 
identify factors associated with the binary outcome successful transition (yes/no). Due to the high 
Page 15 of 19 
Protocol Version 7   Date: 10 -18-23 correlation/overlap with some of the potential predictors, principal component analysis (PCA) will be performed 
using those variables significant at the 0.1 level from step 1. The number of components retained in the model 
with will determined by [CONTACT_682598] -variance explained. Finally, based on the results of the PCA, 
composite variables (which will contain multiple predictors) will be created by [CONTACT_385266] (convert to a z -score) 
each predictor variable and taking the mean value of the stand ardized predictor variables that uniquely load on 
a given component. We will examine the effect of each composite variable on the outcome transition readiness 
using linear regression and the outcome successful transition using logistic regression. All stati stical analyses will 
be performed using SAS.   
Aims 3 & 4: Qualitative data analysis should be conducted until data “saturation”, or the point at which no new 
information is likely to be garnered from additional interviews/focus groups Given that previous research has 
indicated that over 85% of analyti c themes are identified within the first 12 interviews, we are confident that we 
will reach saturation of new information with N=20 stakeholder interviews with AYA survivors in Aim 3, as well as 
N=[ADDRESS_924441] 
in the identificati on of patterns and relationships between concepts (i.e., acceptability, appropriateness). 
Frequencies of all codes will be tabulated and used to inform the revision of the electronic educational materials 
by [CONTACT_577868]. Differences in the frequency of codes wi ll be examined among subgroups of AYA small group participants 
(i.e., age, years post diagnosis, gender) using Chi -square and ANOVA analyses. Our team and the Winship Cancer 
Institute’s Intervention Development, Dissemination and Implementation (IDDI) core  has vast experience with 
qualitative and mixed methods analyses.  
In Aim 4, paired t -tests or Wilcoxon signed -rank tests will be used to compare AYA HBM constructs and knowledge 
about survivor care and late -effects before and after reviewing the electronic educational material. Given [ADDRESS_924442] greate r than 80% power to detect an average of a 1.5 point increase (or an effect size of 
0.40) in AYA average knowledge score after reviewing the electronic educational materials.  
After data are exported from REDCap, we will perform data cleaning and run descriptives on all variables. We will 
analyze pre and posttest differences on knowledge, HBM constructs, self -efficacy and intentions using paired t -
tests. Reliability analyses wil l be run for scales. Differences in HBM constructs, knowledge, PAM activation, and 
self-efficacy to manage cancer care and demographic or cancer history will be assessed by [CONTACT_682599] t -tests to test moderator effects. Power was calculated using  a paired t -test with an assumed 
standard deviation of paired difference of 4.[ADDRESS_924443].

the following question: Today, how 
would you rate the severity of this 
patient’s cellulite in the area selected for 
treatment using the CR PCSS? If the 
buttock is the treated region, the 
Investigator will use the CR PCSS for the 
buttock to make their evaluation; if the 
thigh is the treated region, the 
Investigator will use the CR PCSS for the 
thigh to make their evaluation. In each 
case, the Investigator will make his/her

Title of Study: A Phase 1, Open -Label Study to Assess the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of a Single 
Dose of EN3835 (3.36 mg) in Subjects with Edematous Fibrosclerotic Panniculopathy
Lead Principal Investigator:
[INVESTIGATOR_363804]: 
Estimated date first subject enrolled: 3rdQuarter [ADDRESS_1015387] completed: 4thQuarter 2018Phase of development: Phase 1
Objectives: 
Primary: The primary objectives of this study are to assess safety, and determine if there is systemic 
exposure, following a subcutaneous single dose of EN3835 (3.36 mg) as 12 injections per quadrant in 
4quadrants concurrently (0.84 mg per quadrant) in adult wome n with edematous fibrosclerotic 
panniculopathy (EFP), commonly known as cellulite.
Study Design: This is a Phase 1, open -label, single -dose administration study of the safety, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of CCH .
Number of subjects (planned): Approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled to receive the full dose of 
study drug on Day 1. A minimum of 10 subjects should complete the study with PK profiles for 
evaluation.

Investigational product, dosage, and mode of administration: Investigational product is CCH . A 
single dose of 3.36 mg of CCH will be administered as 12 subcutaneous injections ( CCH 0.84 mg) per 
quadrant concurrently in 4 quadrants for a total of 48 injections. A quadrant is defined as on e of the 
following: left buttock, right buttock, left posterolateral thigh, or right posterolateral thigh.
The study drug ( CCH ) will be injected subcutaneously while subject is in a prone position using a 
syringe with a 30 -gauge ½ -inch needle. Each injecti on site will receive a single skin injection of study 
drug administered as three 0.1 -mL aliquots (for a total injection volume of 0.3 mL per injection; an 
injection volume of 3.6 mL per quadrant and a total injection volume of 14.4 mL).
Duration of study: 43 days (includes screening phase)
Screening Phase: Up to 21 days 
Dosing Phase: Subjects will be admitted to the research unit on the afternoon of Day −1. Dosing will 
occur on Study Day 1. Subjects will remain in the research unit for c ollection of the PK samples out to 
[ADDRESS_1015390] sample is collected on Study Day 2.
Follow up: Subjects will return to the study unit on Day 3, 8, and [ADDRESS_1015391] scheduled outpatient visit to the clinic for assessments 
is on Study Day 22.
Criteria for evaluation:
Safety: The safety of CCH will be evaluated through the collection of adverse events (AEs), including a 
targeted assessment of local/systemic reactions to the dose. Vital sign measurements and clinical 
laboratory testing will also be performed. 
Pharmacokinetics : Subjects will have blood samples collected for the determination of plasma AUX -I 
and AUX- II concentrations before dosi ng and 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes, then at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 
24hours after dosing while confined to the research unit. Subjects will return for PK blood draws at 
48(Day 3), 168 (Day 8), and 504 (Day 22) hours post dose on an outpatient basis. All blood samples are 
to be collected within 10% of the nominal time.
The following PK parameters will be determined for each subject who has quantifiable plasma 
concentrations at any time during the [ADDRESS_1015392] injection: maximum drug 
concent ration (C max), time to maximum drug concentration (T max), area under the plasm a concentration 
time curve from  time of dosing (0) to the time of last quantifiable concentration (AUC 0- t), and area 
under the plasma concentration time curve from time of dosin g (0) to infinity ( AUC 0-inf).
Immunogenicity: Blood samples will be collected pre -dose on Day 1 and on Day 22 after dosing for 
possible determination of anti -AUX- I and anti -AUX -II antibodies in serum; assay of these samples will 
be conducted only if clinic al signs and/or PK results warrant determinations. Descriptive statistics 
(percent positive measurements and average antibody level) will be calculated for anti -drug antibody 
titers at each visit if antibody determinations are conducted. 
Cellulite Severit y Evaluation: Cellulite will be assessed by [CONTACT_737]’s rating of cellulite severity 
using the CR -PCSS at the Screening visit and on Day 22.

Statistical methods:
Sample Size Consideration : No formal sample size calculations were performed. Completion of 
10subjects will provide sufficient data to meet the PK study objectives.
Cellulite Severity Analysis: Evaluations will be done on the quadrants using the CR -PCSS at Screening 
and Day 22. Change from baseline in cellulite severity will be com puted. The Screening and Day [ADDRESS_1015393] deviation (SD). The change from baseline value will be summarized with counts and 
percentages at each possible chang e value and with mean and SD. The cellulite severity population will 
be used to summarize the cellulite severity data.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis: PK data will be summarized through data tabulations, descriptive statistics, 
and graphic presentations, as appr opriate. Actual blood sampling times will be used in all PK analyses. 
AUC 0-t,AUC 0-inf, and C maxwill be summarized with descriptive statistics (number, mean, SD, median, 
minimum, and maximum) as well as the geometric mean and coefficient of variation (CV) . Geometric 
means and CV will be calculated for the log transformed parameters, using the following SAS formula:
CV (%) = SQRT[exp(SD2)-1] * 100
Tmaxwill be summarized with descriptive statistics (number, mean, SD, median, minimum, and 
maximum) only.
If all subjects have all PK concentrations below the limit of quantification (BLQ), then all PK 
parameters will be summarized as not calculable .

8.1. Background of Edematous Fibrosclerotic Panniculopathy
Edem atous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy  (EFP), comm only known as celluli tehas been defined 
as a l ocal metabo lic disorder of subcutaneous tissues that results in a contour abnormalit y of the 
skin (Kahn et al, 2010a ). The condit ion manifests as dimpled skin, particularly i n the gluteal -
femoral regio n (Hexsel et al, 2010 ; Rawlings, 2006). EFP is caused by  [CONTACT_742814]/or shortening of the 
collagen septa that cross the hy poderm al layer and connect the dermis to the underlying fascia. 
This creates an uneven surface wit h dimpling ( Hexsel et al, 2010; Kahn et al, 2010a ). EFP i s a 
medical condit ion result ing in a potentially cosmetically unacceptable alterat ion of the skin, and 
affects an est imated 85% to 98% of postpubertal women (Kahn et al , 2010a ; Rawlings, 2006
).
The pathophysio logy of EFP i s not com pletely understood, but there are 3 main theories: edema 
resul ting fro m excessive hydrophilia o f the intercellular matrix, alteration o f the regional 
microcirculati on, and different anatomical conformat ion of co llagenous subcutaneous tissues in 
wom en versus men (Terranova e t al, 2006 ).
It is known that EFP is different from generalized obesit y. In generalized obesit y, adipocy tes 
undergo hy pertrophy  and hyperplasia that are not limited to the pelvis, thighs, and abdomen
(Kahn et al, 2010a ).In areas of EFP, adipocytes have physio logic and biochemical properties 
that differ from adipose tissue located elsewhere. Large, metabo lically -stable adipocy tes 
characterize EFP -prone areas; thus, the responsiveness to catecholam ine-induced lipo lysis is less 
in EFP ti ssues co mpared to visceral fat, which has the greatest responsiveness (Kahn et al, 
2010a ).
Subcutaneous fat lobes are separated from one another by  [CONTACT_101496], usually  rigid strands of 
collagenous connect ive tissues, which cross the fatty layers and connect the dermis to the 
underlying fascia. These septa stabilize the subcut is and divide the fat. In EFP, shortening of the 
collagen septa due to fibrosis provokes retra ction at the insert ion points of the trabeculae, 
causing the depressio ns that characterize EFP (Hexsel et al, 2010 ). There are a higher percentage 
of thinner, perpendicular hypodermal septa in women with EFP than in men (Kahn et al, 2010a ). 
Weight gain makes EFP more noticeable, but it may be present even in thin subjects. Genet ics 
may also play  a role since EFP tends to run in families.
There are therapi[INVESTIGATOR_596589]; however, there are no 
approved pharmacologic treatments. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_742800] m odali ties, there i s little 
scientific evidence that any  of these treatm ents are beneficial. In f act, m uch of the evidence is 
anecdotal , subject ive, or based only on patient self -assessment (Avram, 2004 ). Som e of the 
histori cal treatm ents f or EFP have included weight loss (Khan et al, 2010b ), topi [INVESTIGATOR_12450]
(Avram, 2004 ), massage (Collis et al, 1999), liposuction (Avram, 2004 ; Khan et al , 2010b ), 
mesotherapy (Khan et al, 2010b ),radio frequency (Khan et al, 2010b ), subcisi on and powered 
subcisio n (Hexsel and Mazzuco, 2000) , and laser therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Boyce et al , 2005 ; DiBernardo, 
2011) ; some of these treatments may pose an increased risk for adverse effects (Avram, 2004 ).
There rem ains an unmet m edical need for safe and effect ive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_742801] e in wo men with cellulite. To effect ively treat cellulite, a therapeutic approach may 

EN3835 -103 Protocol Amendment 1

dimpling that is bothersome to many  wom en.
8.1.1. Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum (CCH)
EN3835 i s currently approved (brand name [CONTACT_742855]®) for: 1) the treatm ent of adults with 
Dupuy tren’s contracture with a palpable cord and, 2) for the tr eatment of adult men wit h 
Peyronie’s disease with a palpable plaque and curvature deformit y of at least 30° at the start of 
therapy . 
EN3835 i s a parenteral ly ophilized product com prised of 2 collagenases, iso lated and purified 
from the fermentati on of  Clostridium histolyticum, in an approximate 1:1 mass ratio, 
Collagenase I (AUX -I, Clostridial class I collagenase) and Collagenase II (AUX -II; Cl ostridial 
class II collagenase). Collagenase AUX -I is a single polypept ide chain containing approximately 
1,[ADDRESS_1015408] 
collagen. Because these co llagenases are proteinases that can hydro lyze the triple -helical regio n 
of collagen under physio logical  condi tions, EN3835 has the potential to be effective in lysing 
subderm al collagen, such as those observed in the dermal septa, which are the underlying cause 
of the skin dimpling in wo men with EFP. 
Endo Pharm aceut icals Inc. (Endo) learned that a much different concentration of the approved 
EN3835 formulat ion was needed to effect ively target the collagenase structural matrix (eg, 
derm al septa) at the si te of injecti onfor EFP . In addit ion to this, the obvious physio logical  and 
pathol ogical differences in the treatment areas f or EFP (com pared to approved indicat ions), 
mandated the need to develop a new formulat ion of EN3835 to treat this condit ion. The diluent 
too had to be optimized so that the new formulat ion can be diluted more, y et off er greater 
stabilit y with potenti ally less inject ion site adverse events (AE) . Thus, Endo developed a new 
formulation of EN3835 for the treatment of EFP, and this new formulat ion is hereafter referred 
to as CCH.
A recent Phase 2b, rando mized, double blind, placebo -controlled study  (EN3835 -201) of 
375wom en rando mized to treatment of one treatment area (quadrant) (quadrant was defined in 
study  EN3835 -201 as a left buttock, a right buttock, a left posterolateral thigh or a right 
posterol ateral  thigh) of  celluli te wi th CCH 0.[ADDRESS_1015409] acebo in a 1 :[ADDRESS_1015410] iveness and safety o f CCH. Efficacy in this study  was evaluated based on cellulit e 
assessments using Clinician Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severit y Scale (CR -PCSS), Patient 
Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severit y Scale (PR -PCSS), Investigator Global Aesthet ic 
Improvem ent Scal e (GAIS -I), Subj ect Gl obal Aesthet ic Improvement Scale (GAIS -S), and 
Subject Satisfaction wit h Cellulit e Treatment.
Results fro m the EN3835 -201 study  dem onstrated that treatment (3 visits approximately  21 days 
apart) improved the cellulite severit y of the treatm ent area as assessed by [CONTACT_742815] 
2-level co mposite responder analyses, the proportion of responders based on an improvement of 
≥ [ADDRESS_1015411] ically significant ly greater in subjects who received CCH 

EN3835 -103 Protocol Amendment 1
07September 2018 Endo Pharm aceut icals Inc. Page 200.84 mg (10.6%; p < 0.001) compared to subjects who received placebo (1.6%); 1- level (or 
greater) responders in the PR -PCSS of CCH -treated subjects (72.3%) was significant ly greater 
than 1-level responders in the placebo group (51.6%) ( p < 0.001); statist ically significant 
(p≤0.001) improvement in the appearance o f cellulite based on the subject S -GAIS were 
observed in CCH 0
.84-mg group (73.1%) compared to the placebo group (44.0%); and 62.9% of 
subjects in the CCH 0.84 mg group were satisfied or very  satisfied with the results of their 
cellulite treatment compared with only  35.9% of  subjects in the placebo group ( p < 0.001).
The study  also dem onstrated CCH to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs) 
related to CCH. Safet y resul ts from a total  of 4 studi es (1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], 2 Phase 1, and 2 Phase 2 studies) 
in which [ADDRESS_1015412] ions ofCCH indicate that the majorit y of 
treatm ent-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are transient, nonserious, mild or moderate in 
intensity, and related to the local administration of CCH. The immunogenicit y profile after 3 
treatm ents of CCH indicate that greate r than 90% of CCH- treated subjects were seroposit ive for 
AUX -I and/or AUX -II antibodi es; this profile of CCH is similar to that observed in the 
Dupuy tren’s contracture and Pey ronie’s disease programs.
No new safet y signals have been seen in ongo ing Phase [ADDRESS_1015413] treated more 
than 400 subjects with EFP of the buttocks with 1.68 mg o f CCH (0.84 mg per buttock).
A Phase 1, open label safety  and pharm acokinet ic study of a single dose of CCH 0.[ADDRESS_1015414] ion of 0.84 mg o f study  drug into one quadrant. A second 
Phase 1, open -label safet y and pharmacokinet ic study  of a single dose of CCH 0.84 mg per 
treatm ent area in two treatment areas (buttock- buttock, thigh -thigh, or buttock -thigh) 
concurrent ly (total dose of 1.68 mg) showed that there were no quant ifiable levels o f AUX -I or 
AUX -II at any  time point post -dose attributable to the inject ion of CCH 1.[ADDRESS_1015415] been performed and are 
summarized in the Investigator Brochure (IB) (Endo, 2017 ). Nonclinical studies in the fo llowing 
areas were performed: toxico logy, reprotoxici ty, genotoxi city, and hyper sensi tivity. 
8.2.1. Pharmacokinetics
Data from a definit ive Phase 1 single -dose study  (AUX-CC-855) and a Phase 3b mult iple-dose 
study  (AUX-CC-861) confirmed that there is no quant ifiable systemic exposure fo llowing a 
single or [ADDRESS_1015416] ion(s) of EN3835 (0.58 mg) into the cord(s) of the affected finger(s) 
in subjects wi th Dupuy tren’s contracture or following the subsequent procedure to disrupt the 
cord. The results of both clinical studies indicate that no detectable absorption of any 
EN3835 -derived co mponents occurs in subjects under condit ions of clinical use. These findings 
are consistent with local inact ivation of EN3835, most likely  as the resul t of com plex form ation 
with alpha-
2-macroglobulin (α2M), a serum protein that serves as a substrate/inhibit or for 
proteases of a variet y of types(Endo, 2017 ).

EN3835 -103 Protocol Amendment 1
07September 2018 Endo Pharm aceut icals IncFollowing each of 2 intralesio nal administrations, separated by  24 hours, of EN3835 (0.58 mg) 
into the penile plaque of 19 subjects with Pey ronie ’s disease (AUX- CC-805), pl asma l evels o f 
AUX -I and AUX -II in subjects with quant ifiable levels (79% and 40% for AUX -I and AUX -II, 
respectively ) were minimal and short -lived. The maximal plasma concentrations of AUX -I and 
AUX -II were < 29 ng/mL and < 71 ng /mL, respectively , and were observed approximately  
within [ADDRESS_1015417] had quant ifiable plasma 
levels 15 minutes after modeling of plaque on Day 3 (ie, [ADDRESS_1015418] ion 2 on Day  2). 
In study  AUX-CC-830, where subjects received [ADDRESS_1015419] ion were 
observed amo ng the 93 subjects who were evaluable for pharmacokinetics (PK).
In study  EN3835 -102, subjects received subcutaneous administration of CCH 0.84 m g 
(12inject ions) in 1 quadrant (left buttock, right buttock, left posterolateral thigh, or right 
posterol ateral  thigh) f or the treatm ent of EFP. No quant ifiable plasma concentrat ions of AUX -I 
or AUX -II at any  time point (t = 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 168, and 
504hours) after dosing were observed among the 11 evaluable subjects.
In study  EN3835 -104, subjects received subcutaneous administration of CCH 0.84 m g ([ADDRESS_1015420] ions) in two quadrants (left and right butto cks) for the treatment of EFP. No quantifiable 
plasma concentrations of AUX -I or AUX -II at any time po int (t=5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes and 
1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 168, and 504 hours) after dosing were observed amo ng the 17 evaluable 
subjects. 
8.3. Summary of Known Risks and Benefits
A summary  of safet y risks is provi ded in the IB (Endo, 2017 ). The fo llowing events have been 
commo nly observed: l ocal inject ion site reactions (inject ion site bruising, inject ion site swelling, 
and inject ionsite pain) for the various approved indicat ions as well as those being inve stigated. 
In the phase 2b study  of CCH in wo men with EFP, the following treatment related AEs were 
reported in ≥2% of 189 CCH -treated wom en: injecti on si te bruising (75.1%), inject ion site pain 
(59.3%), injection site nodule (14.3%), inject ion site pruri tus (11.1%), inject ion site swelling 
(7.4%), injection site induration (5.8%), inject ion site mass (5.3%), injection site disco loration 
(3.2%), and inject ion site ery thema (2.1%). These events are similar to events reported in the 
clinical trials o f EN3835 f or the approved indicat ions. Postm arketing safet y data are consistent 
with safet y data reported in clinical trials.
Although a thorough benefit of CCH has not been fully evaluated in the treatment of EFP, the 
efficacy  resul ts from the Phase 2b study  and pr evious EFP studi es warranted further 
development.
8.4. Rationale
This study  will evaluate the safety , PK, and immunogenicit y of a single 3.[ADDRESS_1015421] ions 
of CCH 0.84 mg/quadrant into [ADDRESS_1015422] ion sessions (21 day s in 
clinical trials).

EN3835 -[ADDRESS_1015423] ives of this study are to assess safet y and determine if there is systemic 
exposure, fo llowing a subcutaneous single dose of CCH (3.36 m g) as [ADDRESS_1015424] ions per quadrant 
in 4 quadrants concurrently (0.84 mg per quadrant) in adult women with EFP.

EN3835 -[ADDRESS_1015425] is standing in a consistent relaxed 
pose (wi thout the use of any manipulation such as skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_596598]).
Before injection on Day 1, the Invest igator or qualified designee will begin the session by 
[CONTACT_742816], evident when the subject is 
standing, and suitable for dosing; the dosing consists of 48 injections (12 injec tions per quadrant) 
on Study  Day  1. 
Because the goal of even a single dose administration is to potentially  improve the aesthetic 
appearance of the ent ire quadrant, the Invest igator will be instructed to select dimples that in his 
or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n woul d most improve the aesthetic appearance of the ent ire quadrant.
For each dimple selected, the Invest igator or qualified designee will choose [ADDRESS_1015426] ion sites per 
quadrant (inject ion sites wit hin a dimple should be spaced approximately [ADDRESS_1015427] ion) and [ADDRESS_1015428] ion 
site will  be marked wi th a “dot” using a surgical marker. For round dimples, the “dot” will be 
placed in the center of the dimple. 
10.4. Study Drug Reconstitution
Before reconstitution, remove the vials containing the lyophilized study  drug powder and the 
vials containing the sterile diluent from the refrigerator and allow the vials to stand at room 
temperature for [ADDRESS_1015429] of the date and time o f reconstitution.
After reconstitution with the sterile diluent, the study  drug sol ution can be kept at room 
temperature (20°C to 25°C/68°F to 77°F)  
hours prior to administration.
10.5. Study Drug Administration at Each Injection Site
Study  drug will be injected subcutaneously while the subject is in a prone posit ion using a 
syringe wi th a 30 -gauge ½ -inch needle. Forty -eight (48) inject ion sites (12 sites per quadrant) 
will be selected (see Section 10.3). Each injection site will receiv e a single skin injection of study  
drug administered as three 0.1 -mL aliquots to Positions A, B, and C (for a total inject ion volume 
of 0.3 mL) as shown in Figure 1.The depth of injection corresponds to the length of the 
treatm ent needle (0.5 inches) fro m the tip of the needl e to the hub or base of the needle without 
downward pressure.
Sixteen (16) sy ringes (4 sy ringes per quadrant) will be prepared for dosing on Day  1. Each 
syringe will contain 0.9 mL of study  drug (i e, 3 injecti ons in each syringe). Forty -eight (48) skin 
inject ions of 0.3mL will be administered within the 4 quadrants ([ADDRESS_1015430] ions per quadrant) 
during the dosing sessio n(inject ion volume of  3.6 mL per quadrant and a total injection volume 
of 14.4 mL )
.

EN3835 -[ADDRESS_1015431]’s 
vital signs shoul d be stable before the subject can leave direct observat ion.
The Investigator or qualified d esignee will then apply a sterile dressing to the inject ion site with 
hypoallergenic tape. The dressing will be removed by  [CONTACT_742817].
10.7. Identity of Investigational Product
The invest igational product vials will be labeled as CCH . CCH is a sterile lyophilized powder 
containing 0.46 mg o f collagenase clostridium histolyt icum  
CCH sterile diluent for reconstitution is 0.6% sodium chloride and 0.03% calcium chlorid e 
dehydrate filled into [ADDRESS_1015432] ions per quadrant in 4 quadrants concurrent ly (0.84 mg per quadrant).

14.1. Definitions
14.1.1. Adverse Events
An AE is any  unfavo rable or unintended change in body  structure (si gns), body  function 
(symptom s), laboratory  resul t (eg, chemistry , ECG, X -ray, etc), or worsening of a preexist ing 
condi tion associated temporally  with the use of the study  medicati on whether or not considered
related to the study  medicati on. AEs will  be captured once a subject has signed the informed 
consent. AEs include:
Changes in the general condit ion of the subject
Subject ive symptoms offered by [CONTACT_742821] m the subject
Object ive signs observed by [CONTACT_742822]
All concurrent diseases that occur after the start of the study , including any change in 
severit y or frequency  of preexist ing di sease
All clinically relevant laboratory  abnorm alities or physical findings that occur dur ing 
the study
A TEAE i s any  condi tion that was not present prior to treatment with study  medicat ion but 
appeared following treatment, was present at treatment init iation but worsened during treatment, 
or was present at treatment init iation but resolved and then reappeared while the individual was 
on treatment (regardless of the intensit y of the AE when the treatment was init iated).
All AEs, including observed or volunteered problems, complaint s, signs or sym ptoms m ust be 
recorded on the AE page of the eCRF ,regardless of whether associated with the use of study  
medicat ion. This would include AEs result ing from concurrent illness, reactions to concurrent 
medicat ion use, or progression of disease states. A condit ion present at baseline that worsens 
after ini tiation of study  treatm ent will be captured as an AE; the onset date will be the date the 
event worsened. The AE should be recorded in standard medical termino logy when possible.
14.1.2. Serious Adverse Events
A SAE is defined as an AE that:
Results in death
Is immediately life- threatening (there i s an immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more serious form may 
have caused death)
Results in or prolongs an inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094] (Note: a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_742803] -planned surgery, procedure, or drug therapy does not constitute an SAE) 
Results in permanent or substantial disabilit y (permanent or substant ial disrupt ion of
one’s abilit y to conduct norm al life f unctions) 

EN3835 -103 Protocol Amendment 1
07September 2018 Endo Pharm aceut icals Inc. Page 39Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect (in offspring of a subject using the study  
medicat ion regardless of t ime to diagnosis)
Is considered an important medical event
Important m edical events are defined as e vents that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may  require m edical  or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes. Examples of important medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requi ring inte nsive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dy scrasias or convulsio ns 
that do not result in inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse. 
14.2. Monitoring Adverse Events
At each visit, subjects will be queried regarding any AEs that have occurred since the last visit. 
Subjects will be asked to volunteer informat ion concerning AEs with a non -leading quest ion 
such as, “How do y ou feel?” Study  site personnel  will then record all pertinent informat ion in the 
source documents and the eCRF . The study  drug com pliance record should also be reviewed to 
detect potential overdoses (intent ional/unintent ional).
14.3. Relationship to Study Drug
The degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the stud y medicat ion must be described using the 
following scale: 
Not related indicates that the AE is definit ely not related to the study  medicati on.
Unlikely related indicates that there are other, more likely causes and study  
medicat ion is not suspected as a c ause.
Possibly related indicates that a direct cause and effect relat ionship between study  
medicat ion and the AE has not been demonstrated, but there is evidence to suggest 
there is a reasonable possibilit y that the event was caused by  [CONTACT_742823].
Probably related indicates that there is evidence suggesting a direct cause and effect 
relationship between the AE and the study  medicati on.
It is the Sponsor’s policy  to consi der “Probably related” and “Possibly related” causalit y 
assessments as positiv e causalit y. “Not rel ated” and “Unlikely  related” causali ty assessments are 
considered as negative causalit y.
Assessments will be recorded on the eCRF and m ust indicate cl early  the relati onship being 
assessed. For example, an AE that appears during a place bo run -in phase would be assessed wit h 
respect to the placebo treatment received and/or study  procedures conducted during this phase. If 
the AE continued into an active treatment phase, the relationship would be assessed for the active

The intensit y (or severi ty) of AEs is characterized as mild, moderate, or severe:
Mild AEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not interfere 
with the subject’s daily act ivities.
Moderate AEs introduce a low level o f inconvenience or concern to the subject and 
may interfere with daily  activi ties, but are usually  ameliorated by  [CONTACT_742824].
Severe AEs interrupt a subject’s usual daily act ivity and ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_742804].
When the intensit y category  of an AE changes, the greatest intensit y during that continuous 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_56218]. 
14.5. Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
14.5.1. Reporting Adverse Events
Throughout the study , AEs w ill be docum ented on the source document and on the appropriate 
page of the eCRF whether or not considered treatment- related. This includes any new signs, 
symptoms, injury or illness, including increased severit y of previ ously exist ing signs, symptoms, 
injury, or illness. Condit ions exist ing pri or to screening will be recorded as part of the subject’s 
medical history . The Invest igator is responsible for assessing the relationship of AEs to the study 
medicat ion; rel ationship will be classified as not related , unlikely  related, possibly related, or 
probably  related. 
All AEs will be co llected by [CONTACT_742825] o f signing the informed consent 
through [ADDRESS_1015449] dose of study  medicati on; thi s includes any AEs that are ongoing at 
the time o f completion/terminat ion of the study . All ongoing AEs m ust be fo llowed unt il 
resol ution or for [ADDRESS_1015450]’s last study visit, whichever comes first.
14.5.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events
Any SAE, including death result ing from any cause, wh ich occurs to any  subject parti cipat ing in 
this study  must be reported vi a email  to  the 
Invest igator using the Endo Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/Reportable Event Form within 
24hours of first beco ming aware of the SAE. SAEs will be co llected by [CONTACT_742826] [ADDRESS_1015451] igator should report all pregnancies wit hin 24 hour s using the Pregnancy Form, and any 
pregnancy -associ ated SAE using the SAE report form, according to the usual t imelines and 
directions for SAE reporting provided in Section14.5.2 . Monitoring of the pregnancy should 
continue until conclusion o f the pregnancy; 1 or more Pregnancy Form(s) detailing progress, and 
a Two Month Follow -up Pregnancy Report Form detailing the outcome, should be submitted.
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_24510] n that the invest igational 
product under study  may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medicat ion. 
Likewise, elective abortions wit hout complicat ions are not considered AE s. Any  SAEs 
associ ated wi th pregnancy  (eg, congenital abnormalit ies/birth defects/spontaneous miscarriages 
or any  other seri ous events) m ust addi tionally  be reported as such using the SAE report form. 
Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and ha ndled as SAEs. 
Subjects should be instructed to immediately notify the Invest igator of any pregnancies. 
Attempts to obtain the pregnancy fo llow-up and pregnancy  outcom e informat ion detailed above 
are necessary  even if a subject discontinues fro m the stud y because of pregnancy.

15.1. Study Drug Concentration Measurements
15.1.1. Blood Sample Collections
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection and Processing
Blood collect ion (10 mL) for PK measurement of plasma AUX -I and AUX -II concentrati ons are 
to be taken before dosing and at 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 168, and 
504hours after dosing. Blood samples are to be collected within 10% of the no minal t ime. The 
exact time of co llection will be noted in the source document and eCRF .
Blood sam ples will be collected from all subjects participat ing in the study. Each subject will 
have 10 -mL samples o f venous blood drawn and placed into lit hium heparin tubes. 
Clock times for specimen drawing/collect ing, handling (eg, centrifuging, freezing), storage, and 
shipment to t he analyt ical lab will be logged by  [CONTACT_742832], storage, and shipment. 
All sample co llection and freezing tubes will be clearly labeled in a fashion, which ident ifies the 
subject, date, and the collect ion time. The containers must be securely labeled in a manner that 
will keep the label attached to the con tainer under the condit ions of low temperature freezing.
Serial blood sam ples f or the intensive PK sampling period (init ial [ADDRESS_1015456] dose) may be 
obtained fro m an indwelling intracatheter or percutaneous venipuncture. If utilized, the 
intracatheter will be inserted into the subject’s vein before the predose sample collection and will 
be used to collect all scheduled blood samples throug hout the day . Immediately prior to each 
collect ion time po int, 2 to 3 mL of the blood/saline mixture will be withdrawn and discarded (to 
prevent sample dilut ion) and the sample withdrawn at the appropriate time point listed in 
Secti on5. Intracatheters will be maintained and kept open with the use of saline flush as needed. 
Once the blood samples have been obtained, the intra -catheter will be removed.
The pl asma samples will be collected, processed, stored, and shipped as described in the 
Laboratory  Manual. 
Any deviat ion from the scheduled sample t ime should be recorded on the eCRF .
15.1.2. Sample Shipment Guidelines
Samples will  be shipped by  [CONTACT_208895], pri ority couri er. The sam ples will  be divided into

Three (3) populat ions are considered in the statist ical analysis o f the study .
16.2.1. Safety Population
The safet y popul ation is all enrolled subjects who receive at least one CCH inject ion.
16.2.2. Pharmacokinetic Population
The pharmacokinet ic (PK) population is all enro lled subjects who receive the full CCH dose and 
have sufficient data from the [ADDRESS_1015459] Disposition
The number of subjects included in each study  popul ation will be summarized. Subjects 
excluded fro m the safet y, PK, or cellulite severit y popul ations will  be listed.
The number and percentage of subjects completed and prematurely discont inued during the 
treatm ent peri od will be presented. Reasons for premature discont inuat ion from the treatment 
period as recorded on the terminat ion page of the eCRF will be summarized (number and 
percentage).
16.4. Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics
Dem ographic characteri stics, including sex, age, age group, race, height, and weight, will be 
summarized for the safet y popul ation, using descriptive statist ics. Th e descri ptive summaries 
will include frequency  tables for all categori cal response variables and number, mean, standard 
deviat ion (SD), m edian, minimum, and maximum for all cont inuous variables.

Cellulite severit y will be assess ed by [CONTACT_737]’s rating of cellulit e severi ty using the 
CR-PCSS. Eval uations will be done on each of the [ADDRESS_1015460] ionary will be used to classify prior and concomitant medicat ions by 
[CONTACT_742833] c class. The versio n used in this study  will be stated in the Data Management Plan. 
Prior medicat ion will be defined as any medication with a start date prior to the Day 1 date and 
are collected at the Screening visit and upon admission to the clinic on Day −1. Concomitant 
medicat ion is defined as any medicat ion with a start date on or after the Day  [ADDRESS_1015461] receiving less than 48 injections ([ADDRESS_1015462] ions per quadrant) will be 
listed. The number of dimples treated will be summarized with counts and percentages.
16.6.3. Measurement of Treatment C ompliance
All doses are administered while subjects are confined as an inpatient in the clinical research 
unit. Any  dose that was not administered per protocol will be recorded as a protocol deviat ion by 
[CONTACT_24342].
16.6.4. Adverse Events
The Medical Diction ary for Regul atory  Activit ies (MedDRA) will be used to code AEs. The 
versio n used in this study  will be stated in the Data Management Plan.
An AE (classified by [CONTACT_11702]) that started during the treatment period will be considered a 
TEAE if it was no t present prior to the first dose of study drug, or was present prior to the first 
dose of study  drug but increased in intensit y during the treatment period. If more than [ADDRESS_1015463] dose of study  drug that increases in int ensity during the treatm ent peri od will  be re-

Descript ive statistics for vital signs (eg, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and 
body  temperature) and thei r changes from  baseline at each visit and at the end of study  will be 
presented by [CONTACT_2715]. Baseline will be the Da y 1 pre -dose values.
Vital sign values are potentially  clinically important (PCI) if they meet both the observed value 
criteria and the change from baseline criteria. The criteria for PCI vital sign values will be 
detailed in the Statist ical Analysis Plan (SAP). A listing of subjects with post -baseline PCI 
values will be provided.
16.6.6. Clinical Safety Laboratory Parameters
Descript ive statistics for clinical laboratory values in Internat ional System o f Units (SI units) and 
changes fro m baseline will be presented for each clinical laboratory  param eter.
The number and percentage of subjects with PCI post -baseline clinical laboratory values will be 
tabul ated. The cri teria for PCI l aboratory  values will  be detailed in the SAP. A list ing of subjects 
with post -baseline PCI values will be provided.
16.6.7. Immunogenicity
Immunogenicit y variables include anti -AUX -I/ant i-AUX -II binding and neutralizing ant ibody  
resul ts. Antibody  assays will  be conducted only  if clinical signs and/or PK results warrant a need 
for antibody  determina tions. If warranted, binding ant ibody  levels will be determined fro m 
samples (3 × 5 -mL tubes o f blood) collected on Day  1 and 22; neutralizing ant ibody  levels will 
be determined for samples collected on Day  1 and Day  22 for all subjects seropositive for an ti-
AUX -I or anti -AUX -II at Day  22.
If ant ibody  assays conducted, descript ive statistics (percent of positive measurements and 
average ant ibody  level) will be presented for anti -AUX -I and ant i-AUX- II antibody  levels at 
each time point. Average ant ibody  levels will be summarized on logarithmically transposed titer 
values. Neutralizing ant ibodies will be summarized as present or absent at each time po int.

All plasma draws collected outside the protocol specified t ime window will be listed. This list ing 
will include the no minal t ime from the injection, the actual time fro m the inject ion, and the 
difference between the 2 times, and the plasma concentrations of AUX -I and AUX -II. Bl ood 
samples obtained within 10% of th e nominal time (eg, within 6 minutes of a 60 -minute sample) 
relative to the last dose will not be captured as protocol deviat ions. The exact time of sample 
collect ion must be noted on the source document and the eCRF .

16.7.2. Calculation of Pharmacokinetic Variables
Pharmacokinet ic data will be summarized through data tabulat ions, descript ive statist ics, and 
graphic presentations, as appropriate. Actual blood sampling times will be used in all PK 
analyses. 
Pharmacokinet ic variables of AUX -I and AUX -II will be estimated from the plasma 
concentration data using a non- compartmental approach on standard PK software (eg, 
WinNonlin). Actual sample times (hours, relat ive to the corresponding administration t ime) 
rounded to 2 decimal digits and negative pre -dose times set to zero, will be used in the

21.1. Data Collection
Endo will provide an electronic data capture (EDC) sy stem  for this study . Data collecti on will  
involve the use of an EDC system to which only authorized personnel wil l have access. The 
system  will be secured to prevent unauthorized access to the data or the system. This will include 
the requirement for a user ID and password to enter or change data. The level o f access to the 
EDC sy stem  will be dependent on the person’ s role in the study .
Study  data will be co llected fro m source docum ents and entered into an electronic case report 
form (eCRF) wi thin the EDC system. The Invest igator will be responsible for ensuring the 
eCRFs are completed in a timely  manner rel ative to t he subject’s visit. In addition to periodic 
monitoring occurring wit hin the system by a Sponsor monitor, programmat ic edit checks will be 
used to review EDC data for completeness, logic, and adherence to the study  protocol . As a 
resul t of this m onitoring and these checks, queries may be issued electronically  to the clinical 
study  sites and cl osed el ectroni cally by  [CONTACT_941] m onitor, data m anagement staff or authorized staff at 
the study  site. Addi tionally, the Invest igator will review eCRFs, ensure all missing or corrected 
data i s provi ded and will sign the eCRF pages wit h an electronic signature. 
An electronic audit trail will be maintained in the EDC sy stem  to track all  changes made to data 
entered in the eCRF. Data will be retrievable in such a fashio n that al l informat ion regarding 
each individual subject is attributable to that subject. Unless otherwise indicated, all data 
captured i n the eCRF must first be captured in source documents. Data that can be direct ly 
recorded in the eCRF will be clearly ident ified in the section(s) of the protocol that describes the 
assessment(s).
Data entri es will be corrected by  [CONTACT_742838] . Any  changes or 
correcti ons to eCRF data will be electronically  tracked and will include the reason for correction,

The study drug (EN3835) will be injected subcutaneously while subject is in a prone position using a 
syringe with a 30 -gauge ½-inch needle. Each injection site will receive a single skin injection of study 
drug administered as three 0.1 -mL aliquots (for a total injection volume of 0.3 mL per injection; a n
injection volume of 3.6 mL per quadrant and a total injection volume of 14.4 mL). 
Duration of study: 43 days (includes screening phase)
Screening Phase: Up to 21 days 
Dosing Phase: Subjects will be admitted to the research unit on the afternoon of Day −1. Dosing will 
occur on Study Day1. Subjects will remain in the research unit for collection of the PKsamples out to 
[ADDRESS_1015486] s ample is collected on Study Day 2.
Follow up: Subjects will return to the study unit on Day 3, 8, and [ADDRESS_1015487] scheduled outpatient visit to the clinic for assessments 
is on Study Day 22.
Criteria for evaluation:
Safety: The safety of EN3835 will be evaluated through the collection of adverse events (AEs), 
including a targeted assessment of local/systemic reactions to the dose. Vital sign measurements and 
clinical laboratory testing wi ll also be performed. 
Pharmacokinetics : Subjects will have blood samples collected for the determination of plasma AUX -I 
and AUX -II concentrations before dosing and 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes, then at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 
24hours after dosing while confine d to the research unit. Subjects will return for PKblood draws at 
48(Day 3), 168 (Day 8), and 504 (Day 22) hours post dose on an outpatient basis. All blood samples are 
to be collected within 10% of the nominal time.
The following PKparameters will be determined for each subject who has quantifiable plasma 
concentrations at any time during the [ADDRESS_1015488] injection: maximum drug 
concentration (C max), time to maximum drug concentration (T max), and area under the curve (AUC 0- tand 
AUC 0-inf).
Immunogenicity: Blood samples will be collected pre -dose on Day 1 and on Day 22 after dosing for 
possible deter mination of anti -AUX- I and anti -AUX -II antibodies in serum ; assay of these samples will 

EN3835 -103 Protocol
14-Feb-2017 Endo Pharm aceut icals Inc. Page 7be conducted only if clini cal signs and/or PK results warrant determinations. Descriptive statistics
(percent positive measurements and average antibody level) will be calculated for anti -drug antibody 
titers at each visit if antibody determinations are conducted . 
Cellulite Severi ty Evaluation: Cellulite will be assessed by [CONTACT_737]’s rating of cellulite severity 
using the CR -PCSS at the Screening visit and on Day 22.
Statistical methods:
Sample Size Consideration : No formal sample size calculations were performed. Complet ion of 
10subjects will provide sufficient data to meet the PKstudy objectives.
Cellulite Severity Analysis: Evaluations will be done on the quadrant susing the CR -PCSS at Screening 
and Day 22. Change from baseline in cellulite severity will be computed. The Screening and Day22
ratings will be summarized with counts and percentages at each level of severity and with mean and 
standard deviation (SD). The change from baseline value will be summa rized with counts and 
percentages at each possible change value and with mean and SD. The cellulite severity population will 
be used to summarize the cellulite severity data.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis: P
Kdata will be summarized through data tabulations, de scriptive statistics, 
and graphic presentations, as appropriate. Actual blood sampling times will be used in all PKanalyses. 
AUC 0-t,AUC 0-inf, and C maxwill be summarized with descriptive statistics (number, mean, SD, median, 
minimum, and maximum) as well as the geometric mean and coefficient of variation (CV). Geometric 
means and CV will be calculated for the log transformed parameters, using the following SAS formula:
CV (%) = SQRT[exp(SD2)-1] * 100
Tmaxwill be summarized with descriptive statistics (nu mber, mean, SD, median, minimum, and 
maximum) only.
If all subjects have all PKconcentrations below the limit of quantification (BLQ), then all PK
parameters will be summarized as not calculable (NC).

8.1. Background of Edematous Fibrosclerotic Panniculopathy
Edem atous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy  (EFP), comm only known as cellulite ,has been defined 
as a l ocal metabo lic disorder of subcutaneous tissues that results in an alteration o f skin 
topography .(1) The condit ion manifests as dimpled skin, described as an orange -peel, cottage 
cheese, or mattress texture, particularly  in the gl uteal -femoral region.( 2,3) EFP i s caused by 
[CONTACT_742843]. This creates an 
uneven surface wit h dimpling.( 1) EFP is a medical condition result ing in a potentially 
cosm etically  unacceptable al terati on of  the skin, and affects an estimated 85% to 98% of 
postpubertal wo men.(1,3)
The pathophysio logy of EFP i s not com pletely understood, but there are 3 main theories: edema 
resul ting fro m excessive hydrophilia o f the intercellular matrix, alteration o f the regi onal 
microci
rculati on, and different anatomical conformat ion of co llagenous subcutaneous tissues in 
wom en versus men.( 4)
It is known that EFP is diff erent from  generalized obesi ty. In generalized obesit y, adipocy tes 
undergo hy pertrophy  and hyperplasia that are not limited to the pelvis, thighs, and abdomen.( 1) 
In areas of EFP, adipocy tes have physio logic and biochemical properties that differ from adipose 
tissue l ocated elsewhere. Large, metabolically -stable adipocy tes characteri ze EFP -prone areas; 
thus, the responsiveness to catecholamine -induced lipolysis is less in EFP tissues compared to 
visceral fat, which has the greatest responsiveness. (1)
Subcutaneous fat lobes are separated from one an other by  [CONTACT_101496], usually  rigid strands of 
collagenous connect ive tissues, which cross the fatty layers and connect the dermis to the 
underlying fascia. These septa stabilize the subcut is and divide the fat. In EFP, shortening of the 
collagen septa due to fib rosis provokes retracti on at the insert ion points of the trabeculae, 
causing the depressio ns that characterize EFP.( 2) There are a higher percentage of thinner, 
perpendicular hypodermal septa in women wit h EFP than in men.( 1) Weight gain makes EFP 
more noti ceable, but i t may be present even in thin subjects. Genet ics may also play  a role since 
EFP tends to run in families.
There rem ains an unmet m edical need for safe and effect ive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_742801] e in wo men with cellulite. To effect ively treat cellulite, a therapeutic ap proach m ay 
requi re disrupt ion of the dermal septa, which are composed of collagen and cause the skin 
dimpling that is bothersome to many  wom en.
8.1.1. EN3835 (Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum)
Endo Pharmaceut icals Inc. (Endo) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_742808]3835 for the trea tment of EFP. Because 
EN3835 i s a proteinase that can hydrolyze the triple -helical region of co llagen under 
physio logical condi tions, EN3835 has the potential to be effect ive in lysing subdermal co llagen, 
such as those observed in the dermal septa, which a re the underlying cause of the skin dimpling 
in wo men with EFP. EN3835 targets the collagenase structural matrix (eg, dermal septa) at the 
site of inject ion and does not require systemic exposure to be effective.

EN3835 -103Protocol
14-Feb-[ADDRESS_1015503] comprised of 2 collagenases in an approximate 
1:1mass rati o, Collagenase I (AUX -I, clostridial class I collagenase) and Collagenase II 
(AUX -II; clostridial class II collagenase). These collagenases are isolated and purified from the 
fermentati on of  Clostr idium histolyticum . Collagenase AUX -I is a single po lypept ide chain 
containing approximately [ADDRESS_1015504] collagen. Clostridial collagenases are proteinases th at can 
hydro lyze the triple -helical regio n of collagen under physio logical  condi tions.
EN3835 i s currently approved for 1) the treatment of adults with Dupuy tren’s contracture with a 
palpable cord ,and 2) the treatment of adult men wit h Pey ronie’s disease with a palpable pl aque 
and curvature deformit y of at least 30 degrees at th e start of therapy .
8.2. Summary of Nonclinical Studies
Inform ation in support of the safet y and efficacy of EN3835 has been derived fro m nonclinical 
studi es reported in the published li terature and/or conducted by  [CONTACT_742844] (BTC )or Auxilium Pharmaceut icals, LLC (Auxilium) .
(5) Collective results from 
these studies indicate that when EN3835 is injected into tissues composed primarily  of dense 
fibrous connective tissue arranged in larger fibrils (tunica albuginea, Pey ronie’s plaque, tendon, 
pericardium , or Dupuy tren’s cord) ,either in vitro or in vivo, lysis was focal, well circumscribed 
and primarily  confined to ti ssue di rectly adjacent to the inject ion site. In contrast, lysis fo llowing 
inject ion into loosely array ed fibrous connective tissue composed of smaller fibrils (corpus 
cavernosum or subcutaneous ti ssue) was m ore diffuse. These findings collect ively support the 
potenti al efficacy of EN3835 in the treatment of localized fibrotic condit ions such as edematous 
fibrosclerotic panniculopathy in the clinic.
8.2.1. Pharmacokinetics
Data from a definit ive Phase 1 si ngle-dose study  (AUX
-CC-855) and a Phase 3b mult iple-dose 
study  (AUX-CC-861) confirmed that there is no quant ifiable systemic exposure fo llowing a 
single or [ADDRESS_1015505] ion(s) of EN3835 (0.58 mg )into the cord(s) of the affected finger(s) 
in subjects wi th Dupuy tren’s contracture or following the subsequent procedure to disrupt the 
cord. The results of both clinical studies indicate that no detectable absorption of any 
EN3835 -derived co mponents occ urs in subjects under condit ions of clinical use. These findings 
are consistent with local inact ivation of EN3835 , most likely  as the resul t of com plex form ation 
with alpha-
2-macroglobulin (α2M), a serum protein that serves as a substrate/inhibitor for 
proteases of a variet y of types.
(5)
Following each of 2 intralesio nal administrations, separated by  24 hours, of EN3835 ( 0.58 mg )
into the penile plaque of 19 subjects with Pey ronie’s disease (AUX -CC-805), pl asma l evels o f 
AUX -I and AUX -II in subjects with quant ifiable levels (79% and 40% for AUX -I and AUX -II, 
respectively ) were minimal and short -lived. All plasma levels were below the limi ts of 
quant ificat ion within [ADDRESS_1015506] had

14-Feb-2017 Endo Pharm aceut icals Inc. Page 20quant ifiable plasma levels 15 minutes after modeling of plaque on
Day 3 (ie, [ADDRESS_1015507] ion 2 on D ay 2). 
In study  AUX-CC-830, where subjects received [ADDRESS_1015508] ion were 
observed amo ng the 93 subjects who were evaluable for pharmacokinetics (PK) .
In study  EN3835 -102, subjects received subcutaneous administration of EN3835 0.84 mg 
(12inject ions) in 1quadrant (le ft buttock, right buttock, left posterolateral thigh, or right 
posterol ateral  thigh) f or the treatm ent of EFP. No quant ifiable plasma concentrations of AUX-I 
or AUX -II at any  timepoint (t =5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 168, and 
504hours) after dosing were observed among the [ADDRESS_1015509] igator’s Brochure (IB).(5)
8.4. Summary of Known Risks and Benefits
A summary  of safet y risks is provi ded in the IB.(5)The fo llowing events have been commo nly 
observed: bruising and edema at the site of inject ion. Subjects should be observed for [ADDRESS_1015510] in female subjects with 
EFP.
The efficacy and safet y of EN3835 in subjects receiving ant icoagulant m edica tions (other than 
low
-dose aspi [INVESTIGATOR_248], eg, up to 150 mg per day ) within 7 days pri or to EN3835 administration is not 
known. Therefore, EN3835 should be used wit h cauti on in subjects with coagulat ion disorders 
including subjects receiving conco mitant anti coagu lants (except for low -dose aspi [INVESTIGATOR_248]).
8.5. Rationale
This study  will evaluate the safety , PK, and immunogenicit y of a single 3.36-mg dose of EN3835 
administered as 48subcutaneous inject ions,ie, EN3 [ADDRESS_1015511] ions 
ofEN38 35 0.84 mg/quadrant into [ADDRESS_1015512] ion sessio ns (21 days in 
clinical trials).

10.1. Study Design
This is a Phase 1, open -label PKstudy . This study  will be perform ed at a single center located in 
the [LOCATION_002] . 
Following a n up to 21-day screening period, subjects will be admitted to the clinical research 
unit (Day  -1) the day  before the dosing of EN3835 ( Day1) and will  remain in the study  unit until 
after the [ADDRESS_1015514] -dose PKsample is collected on Day 2.Twelve (12) subjects will be 
admitted on Day −1 to receive the full dose of the study  drug on Day  1. Subjects will return to 
the study  unit on Day 3, 8, and 22for outpatient follow -up safet yandPKassessments. A 
minimum o f 10 subjects should co mplete th e study with PKprofiles for evaluat ion.
The complete schedule of events is provided in section 5.
10.2. Selection of Dose
The data from the Phase 2a EFP dose-ranging study (AUX -CC-831) suggest that EN3835 
(0.84 mg) is most effect ive in the treatment of EFP based on improvement in the severit y of 
cellulite as determined by [CONTACT_742845], although the EN3835 (0.48 mg)
group di d show i mprovement in some of the efficacy  parameters .(5)
There were no safet y concerns fo llowing administration of up to 3 treatment sessio nsat 21 -day 
intervals (ie,Day 1, 22, and 43 )
,of EN3835 0.84 mg in the treatment of EFP .(5)The safet y 
profile of EN3835 0.[ADDRESS_1015515] udies wi th EN3835 (collagenase clostridium histolyt icum) for inject ion, for 
intralesi onal use in the treatment of Dupuy tren’s contracture and Pey ronie’s di sease in that that 
the majorit y of adverse events ( AEs; bruising, discoloration, pain, and swelling) occurred at the 
site of inject ion and resolved before the next scheduled treatment.
The immunogenicit y profile of EN3835 in the Phase 2a EFP dose -ranging study showed ≥93% 
of subjects in the EN3835 0.48 -mg and EN3835 0.84
-mggroups were positive for antibodies to 
AUX -I and AUX -II; the profile is similar to that observed in the Dupuytren’s contracture and 
Peyronie’s disease programs.

14.1. Definitions
14.1.1. Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any  unfavorable or unintended change in body  structure (si gns), body  
funct ion (symptoms), laboratory  resul
t (eg, chemistry , ECG, X -ray, etc), or worsening of a 
preexist ing condit ion associ ated tem porally wit h the use of the study  medication whether or not 
considered related to the study  medicati on. A Es will be captured once a subject has signed the 
inform ed consent. AEs include:
Changes in the general condit ion of the subject
Subject ive symptoms offered by [CONTACT_742821] m the subject
Object ive signs observed by [CONTACT_742822]
All concurrent diseases that occur after the start of the study , including any change in 
severit y or frequency  of preexist ing di sease
All clinically relevant laboratory  abnorm alities or physical findings that occur during 
the study
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is any condit ion that was not present prior to 
treatm ent wi th study  medicat ion but appeared fo llowing treatment, was present at treatment 
initiation but worsened during treatm ent, or was present at treatment init iation but resolved and 
then reappeared while the individual was on treatment (regardless of the intensit y of the AE 
when the treatment was init iated).
All AEs, including observed or vol unteered probl ems, com plaints, signs or sym ptoms m ust be 
recorded on the AE page of the CRF, regardless of whether associated with the use of study  
medicat ion. This would include AEs result ing from concurrent illness, reactions to concurrent 
medicat ion use, or progression of diseas e states. A condit ion present at baseline that worsens 
after ini tiation of study  treatm ent will be captured as an AE; the onset date will be the date the 
event worsened. The AE should be recorded in standard medical termino logy when possible.
14.1.2. Serious Adver se Events
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening (there i s an immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more serious form may 
have caused death)
Results in or prolongs an inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094] (Note: a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_742803] -planned surgery, procedure, or drug therapy does not constitute an SAE) 
Results in permanent or substantial disabilit y (permanent or substa ntial disrupt ion of 
one’s abilit y to conduct norm al life f unctions) 

EN3835 -103Protocol
14-Feb-2017 Endo Pharm aceut icals Inc. Page 36Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect (in offspring of a subject using the study  
medicat ion regardless of t ime to diagnosis)
Is considered an important medical event
Important m edical even ts are defined as events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may  require m edical  or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes. Examples of important medical events include allergic bronchos pasm  
requi ring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dy scrasias or convulsio ns 
that do not result in inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse. 
14.2. Monitoring Adverse Events
At each visit, subjects wil l be queri ed regarding any  AEs that have occurred since the last visit. 
Subjects will be asked to volunteer informat ion concerning AEs with a non -leading quest ion 
such as, “How do y ou feel?” Study  site personnel  will then record all pertinent informat ion in the 
source documents and the CRF. The study  drug compliance record should also be reviewed to 
detect potential overdoses (intent ional/unintent ional).
14.3. Relationship to Study Drug
The degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the study  medicat ion must be describ
ed using the 
following scale: 
Not related indicates that the AE is definit ely not related to the study  medicati on.
Unlikely related indicates that there are other, more likely causes and study  
medicat ion is not suspected as a cause.
Possibly related indicates that a direct cause and effect relat ionship between study  
medicat ion and the AE has not been demonstrated, but there is evidence to suggest 
there is a reasonable possibilit y that the event was caused by  [CONTACT_742823].
Probably related indicates that there is evidence suggesting a direct cause and effect 
relationship between the AE and the study  medicati on.
It is the Sponsor’s policy  to consi der “Probably related” and “Possibly related” causalit y 
assessments as positive causalit y. “Not related” and “Unlikely related” causalit y assessments are 
considered as negative causalit y.
Assessments will be recorded on the CRF and must indicate clearly the relat ionship being 
assessed. For example, an AE that appears during a placebo run -in phase wou ld be assessed wit h 
respect to the placebo treatment received and/or study  procedures conducted during this phase. If 
the AE continued into an active treatment phase, the relationship would be assessed for the active 
treatm ent phase only if the AE worsened .

EN3835 -103Protocol
14-Feb-2017 Endo Pharm aceut icals Inc. Page 3714.4. Intensity Assessment
The intensit y (or severi ty) of AEs is characterized as mild, moderate, or severe:
Mild AEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not interfere 
with the subject’s daily act ivities.
Moderate AEs introduce a low level o f inconvenience or concern to the subject and 
may interfere with daily  activi ties, but are usually  ameliorated by  [CONTACT_742824].
Severe AEs interrupt a subject’s usual daily act ivity and ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_742804].
When the intensit y category  of an AE changes, the greatest intensit y during that continuous 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_56218]. 
14.5. Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
14.5.1. Reporting Adverse Events
Throughout the study , AEs will be documented o n the source document and on the appropriate 
page of the CRF whether or not considered treatment -related. This includes any new signs, 
symptoms, injury or illness, including increased severit y of previ ously exist ing signs, symptoms, 
injury , or illness. Con ditions exist ing pri or to screening will be recorded as part of the subject’s 
medical history . The Invest igator is responsible for assessing the relationship of AEs to the study 
medicat ion; rel ationship will be classified as not related, unlikely  related, possibly related, or 
probably  related. 
All AEs will be co llected by [CONTACT_742825] o f signing the informed consent 
through Study  Day  
22; this includes any AEs that are ongoing at the time of 
completion/terminat ion of the study . 
Allongoing AEs must be fo llowed unt il reso lution or for 
14days after the subject’s last study  visit, whichever com es first.
14.5.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events
Any SAE, including death result ing from any cause, which occurs to any  subject parti cipat ing in 
this study  must be reported vi a email  to by [CONTACT_742851] [ADDRESS_1015533], call the Medic al 
Monitor (see contact [CONTACT_596680] 3).
All SAEs should be sent via the email address, or faxed to the fax number, provided in 
section 3.
The Sponsor will determine whether the SAE must be reported within 7 or 15 day s to regul atory  
authori ties in co mpliance wit h local and regi onal la w. If so, the Sponsor (or the Sponsor’s 
representative) will report the event to the appropriate regulatory  authori ties. The Invest igator 
will report SAEs to the IRB per their IRB policy .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follow -
up Procedures for Serious Adverse Events
To fully understand the nature of any SAE, obtaining fo llow-up inform ation is important. 
Whenever possible, relevant medical records such as discharge summaries, medical 
consultations, and the like should be obtained. In the event of death, regardless o f cause, all 
attem pts should be m ade to ob tain the death certificate and an autopsy report. These records 
shoul d be reviewed in detail, and the Invest igator should comment on any event, lab 
abnorm ality, or any  other finding, noting whether it should be considered a serious or 
non-serious AE, or whether i t shoul d be considered as part of the subject’s history . In addi tion, 
all events or other findings determined to be SAEs should be identified on the fo llow-up SAE 
formand the Invest igator should consider whether the event is rela ted or not rel ated to study  
drug. All events determined to be non -serious should be reported on the CRF.
14.6. Special Reporting Situations
14.6.1. Adverse Events of Special Interest
There are no AEs of special interest ant icipated in this study .
14.6.2. Overdose/Misuse/Abuse
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overdose
Study  drug overdose is any accidental or intent ional use of study  drug in an amount higher than 
the dose indicated by  [CONTACT_742852]. Study  drug com pliance (see sect ion 12.6) 
shoul d be reviewed to detect potential instances of overdose (intentional or accidental).
Any study  drug overdose during the study  shoul d be noted on the study  medicat ion CRF. 
An overdose is not an AE per se, however all AEs associated with an overdose should both be 
entered on the Adverse Event CRF and reported using the procedures detailed in section 14.5.[ADDRESS_1015534] ions for SAE reporting provided in section 14.5.2 . Monitoring of the 
pregnancy should continue unt il conclusio n of the pregnancy; 1 or more Follow -up Pregnancy 
Report F orm(s) detailing progress, and a Two Month Follow- up Pregnancy Report For m 
detailing the outcome, should be submitted.
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_24510] n that the invest igational 
product under study  may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medicat ion. 
Likewise, elective abor tions wi thout com plicat ions are not considered AEs. Any SAEs 
associ ated wi th pregnancy  (eg, congenital abnormalit ies/birth defects/spontaneous miscarriages 
or any  other seri ous events) m ust addi tionally  be reported as such using the SAE report form. 
Sponta neous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs. 
Subjects should be instructed to immediately notify the Invest igator of any pregnancies. 
Attempts to obtain the pregnancy fo llow-up and pregnancy  outcom e informat ion detailed above 
are neces sary even if a subject discontinues fro m the study  because of pregnancy .
14.6.4. AEs/SAEs Experienced by [CONTACT_51584] -subjects Exposed to Study Medication
Non-subjects are persons who are not enrolled in the study  but have been exposed to study  
medicat ion, including instan ces of diversion o f study  medicat ion. All such AEs/SAEs occurring 
in non-subjects from  such exposure will be reported to the Endo Pharmacovigilance and Risk 
Management ( PVRM )Department (when the non -subject agrees) on the departmental form for 
serious adv erse experi ences regardl ess of  whether the event is serious or not. Instructions for 
completing the form for events experienced by [CONTACT_105] -subjects will be provided. SAEs occurring in 
non-subjects exposed to study  medicat ion will be processed within the same S AE reporting 
timelines as described in sect ion 14.5.[ADDRESS_1015535] this occurrence.
14.7. Clinical Safety Laboratory Determinations
Clinical laboratory  tests will  be conducted according to the schedule of events (secti on 5). 
Clinical laboratory  tests will  be perf ormed by  [CONTACT_393402] . The resul ts of the tests will be 
returned to the investigat ional site. 
Clinical laboratory  test data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_24342] , or designee, and add it
ional 
clinical laboratory  tests m ay be ordered at hi s/her di screti on (eg, if the results of any clinical 
laboratory  test f alls outsi de the reference range or clinical symptoms necessitate addit ional 
testing to ensure safet y). Any addit ional testing will be perform ed by  [CONTACT_544381] l ocal 
laboratory .
The Investi gator will review all abnormal lab results for clinical significance. Any abnormal 
clinical laboratory  test resul t meeting the Invest igator ’s criteria for clinical significance will be 
recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate (see section 14.1.1, Adverse Events, and sect ion 14.1.2 ,

504hours after dosing. Blood samples are to be collected within 10% of the no minal t ime. The 
exact time of collect ion will be noted in the source document and CRF .
Blood sam ples will be collected from all subjects participat ing in the study. Each subject will 
have 10 -mL samples o f venous blood drawn and placed into lit hium heparin tubes. 
Clock times for specimen drawing/collect ing, handling (eg, centrifuging, freezing), storage, and 
shipment to the analyt ical lab will be logged by  [CONTACT_742832], storage, and shipment. 
All samp le co llection and freezing tubes will be clearly labeled in a fashion, which ident ifies the

The total blood volume expected to be drawn for the study  is approximately 233 mL, as fo llows:
PK Samples : 14 sam ples ×10 mL/draw = 140 mL .
(Assuming the site uses an indwelling catheter to collect the first 11 samples out to 24 h ours, an 
additional 3 mL of bl ood will be used for the required flush at each of these t ime points). 
Flush volume (if indwelling catheter is used) = 11 sam ples ×3 mL flush = 33 mL.
Immunogenicity :(3× 5-mL tube sof blood) ×2 time points = 30 mL.
Clinical Safety Labs (hematol ogy/clinical chemistry ):15 m L blood ×2 time po ints = 30 m L.

thesafet y popul ation
.
16.6.1. Prior, Concomitant, and Follow -up Medication
The WHO Drug Dictionary will be used to classify prior and concomitant medicat ions by 
[CONTACT_742833] c class. The versio n used in this study  will be stated in the Data Management Plan. 
Prior medicat ion will be defined as any medication with a start date prior to the Day 1 date and 
are collected at the Screening visit and upon admission to the clinic on Day −1.Concom itant 
medicat ion is defined as any medicat ion with a start date on or after the Day [ADDRESS_1015542] receiving less than 48injections ([ADDRESS_1015543] ions per quadrant) will be 
listed. The number of dimples treated will be summarized with counts and percentages.
16.6.3. Measurement of Treatment Compliance
All doses are administered while subjects are confined as an inpatient in the clini cal research 
unit. Any  dose that was not administered per protocol will be recorded as a protocol deviat ion by 
[CONTACT_24342].
16.6.4. Adverse Events
The Medical Dictionary  for Regul atory  Activit ies (MedDRA) will be used to code AEs. The 
versio n used in this stu dy will be stated in the Data Management Plan.
An AE (classified by [CONTACT_11702]) that started during the treatment period will be considered a 
TEAE if it was not present prior to the first dose of study drug, or was present prior to the first 
dose of st udy drug but increased in intensit y during the treatment period. If more than [ADDRESS_1015544] dose of study  drug that increases in intensit y during the treatment period will be re -
entered wi th a new start date of the date of increased intensit y.
Descript ive statistics (the number and percentage) for subjects reporting TEAEs will be tabulated 
by [CONTACT_73001]; by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and severit y; 
and by  [CONTACT_55743], preferred t erm, and relationship to study drug. If more than [ADDRESS_1015545] related occurrence for the summarizat ion

[CONTACT_742853].
Listings will be presented for subjects with SAEs, subjects with AEs leading to discont inuat ion, 
and subjects who die (if any).
16.6.5. Vital Signs
Descript ive statistics for vital signs (eg, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and 
body  temperature) and thei r changes from  baseline at each visit and at the end of study  will be 
presented by [CONTACT_2715]. Baseline will be the Day 1 pre -dose values .
Vital sign values are potentially  clinically important (PCI) if they meet both the observed value 
criteria and the change from baseline criteria. The criteria for PCIvital sign values will be 
detailed in the Statist ical Analysis Plan (SAP). A listing of subjects with post -baseline PCI
values will be provided.
16.6.6. Clinical Safety Laboratory Parameters

tabul ated. The cri teria for PCIlaboratory  values w ill be detailed in the SAP. A list ing of subjects 
with post -baseline PCIvalues will be provided.
16.6.7. Immunogenicity
Immunogenicit y variables include anti -AUX -I/ant i-AUX -II binding and neutralizing ant ibody  
resul ts. Antibody  assays will  be conducted only if clinical signs and/or PK resul ts warrant a need 
for antibody  determinat ions. If warranted, binding ant ibody  levels will be determined from 
samples (3 × 5-mL tubes o f blood) collected on Day 1 and 2 2; neutralizing ant ibody  levels will 
be determined for sample s collected on Day [ADDRESS_1015546] sseropositive for anti -
AUX -I or anti -AUX -II at Day 22 .
If ant ibody  assays conducted, d escript ive statistics (percent of positive measurements and 
average ant ibody  level) will be presented for anti -AUX -I and a nti-AUX- II antibody  levels at 
each time point. Average ant ibody  levels will be summarized on logarithmically transposed titer 
values. Neutralizing ant ibodies will be summarized as present or absent at each time po int.

table.
16.7.2. Calculation of Pharmacokinetic Variables
Pharmacokinet ic data will be summarized through data tabulat ions, descript ive statist ics, and 
graphic presentations, as appropriate. Actual blood samplin g times will be used in all PK
analyses. 
Pharmacokinet ic variables of AUX -I and AUX -II will be estimated from the plasma 
concentration data using a non- compartmental approach on standard PKsoftware (eg ,
WinNonlin). Actual sample times (hours, relat ive to the corresponding administration t ime) 
rounded to 2 decimal digits and negative pre -dose times set to zero, will be used in the 
computati on of  the PKvariables, rather than scheduled times.

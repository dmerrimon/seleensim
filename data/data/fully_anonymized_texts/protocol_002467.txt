The Myelodysplasia Transplantation- Associated Outcomes (MDS-TAO) Study 
1.[ADDRESS_1170172] 
Although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only therapy that can cure 
patients with the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),  and HSCT has long been the standard of 
care for younger patients with high-risk disease, the procedure has been traditionally withheld 
from older patients due to concerns about ex cessive toxicity and limited underlying overall 
survival. More recently, however, HSCT with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) has been 
increasingly offered to older patients with the sy ndrome, a clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_842101]-HSCT disease-modifyi ng treatments for MDS such as the DNA 
methyltransferase inhibitors. We propose an  observational study en rolling high-risk MDS 
patients who are fit enough to undergo RIC HSCT but whose HLA and donor status is unknown 
at baseline. Whether or not enrollees eventu ally go on to HSCT—indeed, many will not, due to 
factors such as lack of a suitable donor or rapid progression of di sease—all will be followed for 
outcomes such as overall survival, progression fr ee survival, and quality of life. Our protocol 
will generate much-needed comparative outcomes data for older patients with high-risk MDS, and has the potential to greatly  influence how the disorder is treated in the [LOCATION_002]. 
 2.0 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE 
The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of hematopoietic stem cell disorders 
characterized by [CONTACT_842117] a tendency to transform to leukemia. They range 
in clinical severity from in cidentally-found cases manifesting with mild anemia, to highly 
symptomatic cases characterized by [CONTACT_842118] , neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia. These 
latter cases are often accompanied by [CONTACT_327785], infection and rapid mortality, and are thus the 
focus of most MDS treatments, including HSCT. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_842102], until recently lit tle was known about the epi[INVESTIGATOR_842103].
1 Indeed, MDS was only added to the National Cancer 
Institute’s Surveillance Epi[INVESTIGATOR_70299] (SEER) program in 2001, and reliable 
incidence rates (2001-2003) were only recently  reported: 3.4 cases per 100,000, with a male 
predominance (4.5 for males versus 2.7 for female s) and three-year overall survival of 45%.2-3 
Data on patterns of care for MDS patients is al so limited, although it is known that the newer 
WHO classification system4 (as compared to the older FAB system) has become widely-adopted 
in clinical pratice.5 One study reported the results of a survey among US hematologists,6 finding 
that fewer MDS patients with lower-risk disease we re transfusion-dependent, a majority received 
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), and onl y a small percentage of patients had had or 
were being considered for HSCT.[ADDRESS_1170173] in older and sicker pati ents by [CONTACT_842119]-related 
toxicity.26-32 For example, Kroger and associates repor ted on 26 patients with MDS or secondary 
AML (median age = 60; range 44 to 70) who were transplanted with RIC with cells from related 
(n=6) or unrelated (n=20) donors. Transplant-r elated mortality was 28%, and the two-year 
MDS TAO 5 
estimate overall survival rate was 36%.29 A Spanish trial reported results on 37 patients (median 
age = 57; range 22 to 66) with MDS or AML transplanted from HLA-identical siblings 
following a RIC regimen. The one-year transplant -related mortality and relapse-free survival 
were 5% and 66%, respectively. In our group, we have found si milar outcomes in patients 
treated with RIC and myeloablative regimens. For example, we reviewed [ADDRESS_1170174] . Patients receiving RIC were at high risk for 
treatment-related complications gi ven that they were older, 57 vs 43 years (P < .001), and more 
likely had received previous or myeloablative tran splantation (54% vs 2%; P < .0001). Still, Cox 
regression analysis showed that the intensity of  the conditioning regimen had no effect on either 
overall survival or progression free survival, sugg esting that RIC is a reasonable alternative for 
patients with advanced MDS or AML at high risk for complicatio ns with myeloablative HSCT.[ADDRESS_1170175] limited its application in older pa tients (60 to 75) with 
MDS, especially given the lack of rigorous comparative outcomes data from a study including 
patients both with and without HSCT. Perhaps due to  this fact, earlier this  year, the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)—the main health insurer for adults 65 and older in the 
[LOCATION_002]—posted their controversial decision on coverage of HSCT fo r Medicare patients 
with MDS. In the decision, CMS disallowed covera ge for HSCT, but stated that the current data 
from younger patients, especially with regard to RIC HSCT, is promising enough to provide for 
some coverage under the Coverage with Evidence  Development process (§ 1862(a) (1) (E) of the 
Social Security Act. This allows for Medicare patients with MDS to receive HSCT provided that 
the HSCT is performed in the context of a prospective clinical study comparing Medicare 
patients with MDS who receive HSCT to simila r Medicare patients with MDS who do not. In 
part to address this challenge, th e aim of this current protocol is to prospectively examine post-
RIC HSCT outcomes in those patients aged 60 to  75 with MDS (which would include Medicare 
beneficiaries aged 65 to 75) to determine whethe r these outcomes are similar to those patients 
with MDS aged [ADDRESS_1170176]. 
 
3.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
3.1 Primary Objective 
To prospectively compare the overall survival (OS) of patients aged 60-[ADDRESS_1170177] 
for MDS (Group A) to that of patients aged 60-[ADDRESS_1170178] (Group B) but who 
have disease of sufficiently high enough risk to warrant HSCT and who are also fit enough to 
undergo the procedure ( primary outcome ). 
3.2 Secondary Objectives 
1. To prospectively compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients in Group A to 
that of patients in Group B as defined above ( secondary outcome ). 
2. To prospectively compare changes in the qual ity of life (QoL) from baseline to two years 
of patients in Group A to that of pa tients in Group B as defined above (secondary 
outcome). 
MDS TAO 6 
3. To assess the potential association of patient- and disease-specific factors—including 
International Prognostic Scoring System (I PSS) score, WHO-based Prognostic Scoring 
System (WPSS) score, number of cytopenias , transfusion dependence,  disease duration at 
baseline, prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_842104] —with the primary and secondary outcomes. 
 
4.0 STUDY POPULATION 
Eligible patients will be 60 to 75 years old with a diagnosis of MDS or related disorder (eg,

defined by [CONTACT_842120]36) and who are physically fit enough to  undergo RIC HSCT as assessed by 
[CONTACT_094]-determined measures of organ function. Patients whose baseline donor status is known will be excluded; however, knowledge of HLA status is allowed as long as a donor search has not been performed.

5.0 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS 
5.1 Data Collection 
Data for this study will be collected using the existing mechanisms of the Dana-Farber/Harvard 
Cancer Center (DF/HCC) Leukemia Clinical Re search Information Systems (Leukemia CRIS) 
for baseline data (all study participants). For patients who do not go on to HSCT, Leukemia 
CRIS will be used to collect their outcomes, wh ile HSCT patients will have outcomes collected 
in the Center for International Blood and Marro w Transplant Research Stem Cell Therapeutic 
Outcomes Database (CIBMTR SCTOD). Leukemia CRIS is a state-of-the-art information 
infrastructure for hematologic oncology at the DF /HCC, developed to link clinical outcomes to 
blood and tissue samples, and to lay the founda tion for innovative pi[INVESTIGATOR_842105]. The database has been acc ruing data since January of 2006. Patients in 
Leukemia CRIS have baseline information and a new patient survey entered at 3 months; they 
are then assessed for outcomes every 6 months fo r 3 years. After 3 years, their records are 
updated for outcomes once per year. Note that baseline IPSS, WPSS and entry criterion (eg, 
histology, cytogenetics, or tran sfusion requirements), or as we ll as eventual HLA status and 
donor status will be added to Leukemia CRIS data  screens and captured for MDS-TAO patients. 
Also, QoL will be assessed at baseline and two years with the EORTC-30,[ADDRESS_1170181]. Abel under OHRS protocol 13-346.  
5.2 Methods of Procedure 
A dedicated clinical research assistant will work with the hematologic oncology new patient 
coordinators at the DF/HCC member institutions  (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Beth 
MDS TAO 9 
Israel Deaconess Medical Cent er (BIDMC) and [LOCATION_005]  General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH)) to 
identify high-risk MDS patient s that may be eligible for the study. The transplant and non-
transplant MDS physicians will be ultimately responsible for identifying patients who are 
eligible for MDS-TAO; in additi on, as all MDS patients followed at the DF/HCC are eligible for 
the Leukemia CRIS database, the research assist ant and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_842106]/HCC to retroactively assess eligibility 
and contact [CONTACT_842123] n to encourage that physician to  enroll appropriate patients. 
Of note, the point of contact [CONTACT_842124]. 
 
Once enrolled, all study patients will be followed for the primary and secondary outcomes listed 
above, with assessments in step with those in the Leukemia CRIS system  (baseline and every 6 
months for 3 years; then yearly). A difference is that MDS-TAO patients will be followed on the 
same schedule whether or not they continue to  receive their care at DF/HCC (Leukemia CRIS 
does not follow patients that are only seen  for one-time consultation at DF/HCC). The 
investigators understand that this will require a different informed consent, and more resources 
(eg, another clinical research assistant) to obtain  and abstract outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]. Also, all 
MDS-TAO enrollees will be given the EORTC-30 to take home and mail back (if they have not 
already done it as part of their Leukemia CRIS new patient survey) at baseline a nd again at two 
years, regardless of HSCT status or whether or not they continue to be  followed at DF/HCC. All 
enrollees will also be asked to complete the QUALMS-[ADDRESS_1170182], his or her data —including outcomes—will be collected in the 
CIBMTR SCTOD.  
6.[ADDRESS_1170183] for MDS (Group A) and patients 60-[ADDRESS_1170184] a nd who are also fit enough 
to undergo the procedure (Group B). 
6.2 Sample Size 
290 eligible patients will be en rolled between the two groups over a period of 5 years and 
followed for an additional 5 years. Based on our  current practice, we anticipate that the 
enrollment will be 1:2 ratio for Group A (HSCT) to Group B (no HSCT). This design will give 
approximately 85% power to detect a 15% di fference in 5-year OS between the two study 
groups.  
6.3 Accrual 
In 2009, the DFCI performed 18 RIC HSCTs in patie nts similar to the ones who will be eligible 
for the MDS-TAO study. Given the addition of th e other members of the DF/HCC (BIDMC and 
MGH), we anticipate that we will accrue [ADDRESS_1170185] group (Group A). 
There were also 50 patients seen at DFCI in 2009 with MDS of sufficiently high risk by [CONTACT_842125] (RAEB-1, RAEB-2, RCMD, and RCMD-RS) to be considered for HSCT but who did 
not ultimately receive HSCT. Thus, we project th at we will accrue at least [ADDRESS_1170186] (Group B). With [ADDRESS_1170187] was 51% in RAEB-1 and 28% in RAEB2 w ith an indication of plateau after 5-[ADDRESS_1170188] for older 
patients with MDS. Malcovati et al36 reported that 5-year OS wa s 3% in the RAEB-1 group and 
14% in the RAEB-[ADDRESS_1170189] from the underlying disease 
and the 5-year OS will be 25%, whereas the 5-year OS will be 10% for the non-HSCT patients 
and the survival distribution of  these patients will follow an e xponential distribution. In addition, 
we expect that there will be an approximately 4-[ADDRESS_1170190], thus no difference in OS between the two groups is expected for some period after the start of the study. Based on this information and assumptions, we propose 
an alternative hypothesis as: H
a: SA>SB, where S A denotes the survival distribution of Group A 
and S B denotes the survival distribut ion of Group B. Specifically:

6.[ADDRESS_1170191] procedures and processes. In terim inspections will 
occur annually; however, as this is an observati onal study and no new treatment is proposed, it is 
important to note that these interim analyses wi ll not have an effect in terms of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_842108] e or null hypothesis.

6.6 Secondary Outcomes 
Secondary outcomes include PFS and changes in se lf-reported QoL. PFS is defined as time from 
enrollment until evidence of progression to acute leukemia (time until increase in marrow or 
peripheral blasts to >20%). QoL will be asse ssed via changes between baseline and two-year 
assessments on the EORTC-[ADDRESS_1170192] not based our power calculations on these outcomes and covariates due to  their exploratory nature.  
6.7 Statistical Analysis Plan 
As a patient’s status in Group A may be cha nged during the study from waiting for HSCT to 
being a HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], the effect of HSCT will be assessed in a various ways. Our first 
approach will be using the Mantel-By[CONTACT_842126].
40 Mantel and By[INVESTIGATOR_3694] (1974) proposed a modified 
life table to avoid ‘time-to-treatment’ bias and to accommodate the transient nature of transplant 
status. The second approach is to  treat patient’s transplant status as a time-dependent function, 
X=X(t), as proposed by [CONTACT_842127].41 In this approach, X(t) is an indicator variable at time 
t, that is, X(t)=[ADDRESS_1170193]. Abel and colleagues at DF CI which is currently undergoing validation.38 The 
predictability of IPSS or WPSS score on surviv al outcome will be assessed using the time-
dependent ROC curve estimation for censored survival data (survival ROC), proposed by 
[CONTACT_842128].44-45 The predictability of these two scor ing systems will be compared in each 
group. In addition, a subset analysis will be pe rformed for Group A (HSCT) to prospectively 
determine if disease- or patient-related factor s predict outcomes of HS CT for MDS in patients 
aged 60-75. These factors include baseline age at HSCT, IPSS score, WPSS score, number of 
cytopenias, transfusion dependence, disease dura tion, prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], a nd Sorror co-morbidity 
index. In this subset analysis, standard time-to-e vent analysis as well as  competing risks data 
analysis46 will be performed. 
7.0 COMMITMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES 
MDS-TAO will be a long-term study, with at leas t 5 years of active accrual, and likely several 
more years of follow-up. The DFCI has invested a substantial commitment to  the success of this 
effort. The current Leukemia CRIS program ha s a dedicated 100% FTE clinical research 
assistant, and is overseen by a di sease-specific Principal Inves tigator, as well as a Population 
Scientist (2.5% FTE). MDS-TAO will call on these existing resour ces; in addition, the DFCI has 
committed support for another 50% FTE research assistant—who will be housed and supervised 
at the McGraw-Patterson Center for Outcom es and Policy Research—as well as 20% FTE 
programmer (to start in year 2 of  the study) to assist the projec t biostatistician with interim 
analyses. Finally, the DFCI will fund or assist w ith the ascertainment of grant funding for 10% 
MDS TAO [ADDRESS_1170194] for older patients with MDS—crucial information 
for our health care system as our country beco mes increasingly concerne d with the costs of 
health care and comparative effectiveness. Our re sults will provide essential insight to patients 
and practicing oncologists regardin g the advisability of HSCT for MDS patients in this largely 
understudied age group, as well as help policymakers and funding sources such as CMS 
understand if the procedures truly lead to improved outcomes. Next, the data we plan to collect 
regarding potential ch anges in quality of life asso ciated with HSCT in th is age group promise to 
address an important gap in the current HSCT literature. Fina lly, MDS-TAO would also provide 
a long-overdue source of primary and prospective data for MDS researcher s as to the usefulness 
of the IPSS and WPSS in prognosticating fo r transplantation-related outcomes.

Protocol Title: PFI: BIC Affordable and Mobile Assistive Robots for Elderly Care
Short Title: Affordable Mobile Robots for the Elderly
Protocol Description: This project develops and tests the use of service robots to track health of the elderly over time. 
The objecti
ves are to develop a low-cost mobile manipulator capable of a limited set of elder-
relevant manipulation tasks (e.g. pi[INVESTIGATOR_501415]). We will visualize and model the use 
of the service robot during deployments at an elder care facility. Feedback from focus groups with 
elders and clinicians will inform the necessary engineering innovation.

Protocol
Objectives
Overall objectives
The goal is to de
velop in three stages a new affordable robot with the participation of Living 
Independently for Elders (LIFE) members and clinicians. The robot will be developed by a 
multidisciplinary team headed by [CONTACT_501426] (PI), [CONTACT_501444] at Savioke, and Drs. Johnson and 
Cacchionne at UPENN PM&R and UPENN Nursing respectively. We aim to build a low-cost robot 
platform that will focus on the simple, but key, repetitive, data-driven tasks that robots do well. Rather 
than attempt to create a robot helper that mimics humans, we aim to free human caregivers from the 
time-consuming tasks that robots can accomplish with facility, thereby [CONTACT_501427] (i.e. human contact). Participatory reviews of the developed prototypes will 
be completed at each stage (each year) with the LIFE members and clinicians. There are three research 
questions we hope to answer all while building an effective system to synergistically satisfy the 
business needs: R1) Although activities of daily living (ADLs) for elder health have previously been 
documented and categorized, no research has been done to characterize them from the perspective of 
their feasibility of automation using an affordable mobile manipulation robot. How can we characterize 
known ADLs according to how much they would bene®t from robotic assistance given varying levels of 
Page 6 of 13robot capabilities (mobility, limited manipulation, full manipulation)? R2) A manipulator arm must be 
safe, af
fordable, and performant enough to assist in ADLs for elder heath. What new breakthroughs are 
required to develop new manipulation technology that satis®es these constraints? What are the 
concomitant key usability and acceptance of service features required? R3) A data-driven service 
robotics system has the potential to affect elder health in a positive way. How can predictive service 
robotics best be used to maintain and improve elder health? Which speci®c robot behaviors have the 
most impact on elders© well-being?
Background
A gro
wing elderly population coupled with low birth rates in the developed world is creating a crisis in 
healthcare. The number of senior citizens is outgrowing the number of working-age adults to care for 
them. In the US alone, the number of seniors over age 65 is projected to double from year 2000 to 2030, 
reaching 71.5 million. Similar statistics are found throughout the world. With the scarcity of care 
options available, robots are a welcome solution for assisting elders with small tasks that would 
normally be done by a caregiver. With an estimated 17,000 elder care facilities nationwide, merely 
placing a single affordable robot in each facility would result in a $170m business. In this vein, the past 
decades have seen an enormous amount of robotics research funded by [CONTACT_501428], including a notable multi-million dollar effort by [CONTACT_501429][INVESTIGATOR_65273]. A variety of companies have also explored robots in the 
healthcare space. Aethon, Vecna, and Helpmate have automated materials transport/delivery with 
varying success. They have limited service capability in that they are not capable of manipulation. On 
the other side of capability, research robots such as Willow Garage©s PR2 and Care-o-bot from 
Fraunhofer IPA have demonstrated mobile manipulation, but have costs between $100-500K. 
Fortunately, a number of factors are converging to make cost-effective robots possible now. Previous 
efforts have exploited rapid prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_501416]-cost hardware such as 3D printing and mass customization 
of electronics to lower hardware costs. Additionally, the software necessary to power mobile 
manipulation robots and hardware costs, such as low-cost depth sensors (i.e. Microsoft©s Kinect) are 
becoming better and cheaper each year. Through our own novel design and innovation coupled with 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_501417], we aim to develop an affordable and capable robot that will address the demographic shift 
towards the need for more elderly care. One key to making this system viable is maintaining 
effectiveness at low cost. This work will build on existing navigation and control software for mobile 
robots using a platform being commercialized by [CONTACT_501430]. On top of this, a new low-cost expanding 
prismatic joint arm developed at University of Pennsylvania will add manipulation capabilities. This 
hardware and software platform will enable the study of the usefulness of robots in an elder care 
facility. Limited tasks such as the delivery of water to patients can be used to monitor hydration of 
individuals over-time and pro-actively predict required service to aid in healthcare. The information 
gathered by [CONTACT_501431] ®eld use will help to learn how robots can 
help create a larger data-driven health monitoring system. The partners include the University of 
Pennsylvania©s School of Engineering and Applied Science, School of Medicine, School of Nursing 
(Philadelphia PA), and Savioke (Sunnyvale, CA, a small business concern) along with LIFE, Living 
Independently For Elders (Philadelphia PA).
Study Design
Design
W
e plan to tackle the myriad aforementioned challenges in three stages.  First, based on focus group 
feedback, we will design a data collection plan for the robot to collect information about service tasks. 
This may include information such as the time it takes the robot to perform a task, when the task was 
requested, whether the robot succeeded at performing the task, etc. This data collection component will 
be deployed at LIFE or a LIFE-af®liated retirement community during the various trials. Additionally, 
our partners at Savioke ([CONTACT_501445] is a co-PI [INVESTIGATOR_501418]) will conduct additional focus groups in 
elderly care facilities in [LOCATION_004], in order to get faster feedback on their prototype designs. The focus 
group methodology will be employed throughout to assess user needs and evaluate user experiences 
with the robot system being developed. Second, we will develop interactive data visualizations of the 
collected data and share these with the LIFE and LIFE-af®liated administrators, staff, and residents. 
These interactive data visualizations will make use of best practices in medical informatics and 
visualization and enable stakeholders to explore the data we have collected and from initial conclusions 
about resident©s health and service needs. Based on feedback from the visualizations, we will ®ne-tune 
our data collection process which will likely impact the robot design.  The ®nal step will be to develop 
Page 7 of 13predictive models of when people want services performed so that our system can proactively deliver 
services when the
y are needed. By [CONTACT_501432]© requests over time - a machine learning problem - 
we aim to build a model of what features in the environment trigger the service requests over time.
Study duration
1) 
We estimate that it will take three years from the date of IRB approval to enroll all subjects and 
complete the study. 2) A subject may choose to participate for as little as one focus group (1.5 - 2 hours) 
or may choose to participate in each part of the larger study over the course of three years. 3) 8/15/2014 
- 8/15/2017
Characteristics of the Study Population
Target population
1. 
Three populations will be involved: 1. Elders who are members of Living Independently For Elders 
(LIFE) run by [CONTACT_3374], School of Nursing and their caregivers will be recruited 
for the study. The elder members will be drawn from those participating in the LIFE-af®liated 
retirement community (Mercy Douglas or Kearsley) or those on the Council of Elders for LIFE or those 
at LIFE. Elders must be members of LIFE and live at a LIFE-af®liated retirement community or 
participate in the elder council. Members of LIFE are age 55 and older, in need of medical care or 
supportive services, are state-certi®ed as nursing home eligible, live in certain areas in Philadelphia 
County, Pennsylvania, prefer to continue living in their community for as long as possible, can be safely 
served and able to pay privately or through Medicare. Members of LIFE at Kearsley and Mercy 
Douglas require more assistance with physical, cognitive and social functioning and are provided a 24-
hour interdisciplinary clinical staff to assist them in meeting needs. Members are 62 years and older, in 
imminent risk of a nursing home placement, attends LIFE center daily (day program), able to have 
activities of daily living (ADL) needs met by [CONTACT_50633], able to pay required rent for apartment, and 
able to function safely in community with other elders. And for the purpose of earlier prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_501419], Savioke may conduct additional focus groups at The Forum at 
Rancho San Antonio a Continuing Care Retirement Community located in Silicon Valley.  2. Clinicians: 
Clinicians will be recruited from the clinical staff working at LIFE, Kearsley, and Mercy Douglas which 
consists of primary care physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners, certi®ed nursing assistants, home 
health aides, licensed social workers, physical and occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], personal care workers, etc. 
Subjects will also be excluded if they do not understand the study and refuse to comply with 
procedures.  Subjects will be excluded if they are unable to cognitively give consent. For the corn toss 
game, [ADDRESS_645851] a minimental score of 20 or higher, and are able to stand and reach

. Cacchione (UPENN Nursing Professor) and [CONTACT_501446] (Interim Chief Nursing Of®cer) are 
af®liated with LIFE and will be responsible for reviewing LIFE©s medical records. After potential study 
participants are identi®ed, the commonly used Short Blessed Test (measures cognitive function in the 
elderly), SF-12, etc., may be administered for additional screening purposes. LIFE members will then 
be consented prior to participation in the focus groups by a member of the research team.  For any focus 
groups at The Forum at Rancho San Antonio, Savioke will liase with the Director of Wellness, Sharon 
Fay, with whom they have an established relationship. Residents at The Forum will then be consented 
using the same consent form used for any LIFE members.  Recruitment will be word of mouth, direct 
solicitation, and informational sessions convened with the assistance of the Council of Elders© and the 
research committee overseeing participant activities.
Will the recruitment plan propose to use any Penn media services (communications, marketing, etc.) for 
outreach via social media a
venues (examples include: Facebook, Twitter, blogging, texting, etc.) or does 
the study team plan to directly use social media to recruit for the research?

25 dollars will be provided to each participant for her/his participation in year 1. An additional $25 will 
be provided in year 2 and year 3 should they continue to participate in focus groups and evaluation 
sessions. Subjects participating in only the evaluation session with the walking task will be paid $5.00 
per walk taken with the robot. Subjects participating in only the corn toss session will be paid $10.00. 
Subjects participating at The Forum at Rancho San Antonio will not be compensated ®nancially, 
however, snacks and beverages will be provided. No compensation will be provided due to the fact that 
the focus groups will be considerably shorter and limited in scope.

Procedures
Y
ear 1:  Need-®nding focus groups of clinicians and elders will be conducted, consisting of no more 
than 8-10 persons at each session. The aim of the initial focus groups is to reconcile the needs of elders 
with the robot requirements in order to determine the robot behaviors. The focus groups will help de®ne 
a set of robot behaviors critical to meeting the needs of elders. Some behaviors that may emerge are 
transporting objects, telecommunication, following, leading, monitoring, playing, coaching, escorting 
persons, etc. In a typi[INVESTIGATOR_501420], participants will explain life at their location, create a 
prioritized list of key activities and needs in physical, cognitive and social domains, hear about the 
research and the current capabilities of the robot, describe how they could use the robot to meet needs 
and what may be lacking, and set-robot tasks list. The elders in the needs assessment focus group will 
Page 9 of 13be those serving on the council of ELDERs for LIFE. A member check (respondent validation) will take 
place with certain members of the v
arious focus groups. Development partners will be identi®ed from 
the focus group sessions. They will meet quarterly with the team to address development issues with the 
robot .This team will function as the early assessors and will provide real time feedback.  Additionally, 
residents at The Forum at Rancho San Antonio in Silicon Valley will provide feedback via need-®nding 
focus groups during year 1.  Year 2:  The robot prototype, consisting of the mobile base and a limited 
gripper, will be tested at a LIFE-af®liated retirement community with the elders and caregivers. The 
robot tasks evaluated will be involve services aimed at providing reminders, transport, telepresence, 
games, etc. Later that year, another version of the robot prototype, consisting of the mobile base 
incorporating improvements from the 1st round of assessments and an arm plus an articulated gripper, 
will be tested with elders and clinicians for 3 weeks. The robot tasks evaluated will be those involving 
mobility and some manipulation services such as hydration, pi[INVESTIGATOR_501421]. Data will be 
analyzed and results on robots usability will be provided as feedback to the development team in order 
to improve the system. THE ABOVE SUMMARY PARAGRAPH WAS INCLUDED IN OUR INITIAL 
IRB SUBMISSION, APPROVED OVER ONE YEAR AGO. BELOW ARE SOME ADDITIONAL 
DETAILS WHICH ARE THE MAIN MODIFICATION TO THE PROTOCOL.  1.) Subjects will be 
consented and be provided with a demographic survey (see attached).  2.) The robot prototype will be 
pre-programmed to complete key activities while located on site (Mercy Douglas or LIFE). The key 
activities are: (1) Encouraging exercise and companionship via walking; and (2) Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_501422] a scheduled time. Clinicians and caregivers will be consulted to 
determine how to tailor robot tasks to each consented patient.  3.) During the walking companion task, 
the robot will ask ambulatory participants to walk with the robot for the recommended [ADDRESS_645853] one time per day. The robot will arrive at the elder©s apartment at a prescheduled 
time selected by [CONTACT_12552]/her. The amount of time the elder spends walking with the robot may be adjusted 
should the clinician/caregiver recommend a shorter time period (e.g. the walk time may be decreased if 
a patient suffers from sciatica).  4.) During the hydration task, the robot will bring a an 8 oz. bottle of 
water and a bottle opener to the elder. The frequency in which the robot bring water to the elder will be 
based upon the recommendation of the clinician/caregiver. The base recommendation will be 6, 8 oz. 
glasses of water outside of meal times. An example of a modi®cation to the base recommendation 
would be to increase the number of water bottles for those who have dry mouth, are on dialysis, or tend 
to forget to drink water (this is very common among the elderly population). For both the walking and 
hydration tasks, the patient can instruct the robot to return at a later time or to go away. All tasks will 
take place in the hallway either just outside of the participant©s apartment or inside the apartment. There 
will be one observer on our team who will watch the robot-participant interaction and complete a 
checklist of usability and issues. There will be another observer on our team who will immediately ask 
the participant to complete a post robot assessment survey tailored to the task they just experienced.  
Example Procedure for the Walking Task Scenario: The robot approaches a participant and asks them if 
they want to go for their scheduled walk. The participant can say "yes" and go for the walk, "no", or 
reschedule the robot to come back at a later time. Observer #[ADDRESS_645854] items. If the participant goes for the walk, observer #[ADDRESS_645855] the opportunity to ®ll out a global interaction survey about the experience and provide 
information on how to improve the robot for future usability testing periods. Procedure for corntoss 
game: 1.) Subjects will be consented and be provided with a demographic survey (see attached).  2.) 
The robot prototype will be pre-programmed to complete key activities while located on site (Mercy 
Douglas or LIFE). Participants will ®rst play the corn toss game without the assistance of the robot. 
They will retrieve the [ADDRESS_645856] another participant. The 
participants will throw 3 bags and scores will be assessed. The participants will retrieve their own bags. 
In the second session, participants will repeat these steps; however someone from the research team will 
retrieve bags for the participant. At this point, there will be a pause and participants will be asked 
survey questions. Next, the same steps will be repeated, however the robot will retrieve the bags with a 
gripper from the upper cabinet and hand to the participant. Finally, the game will be repeated, but the 
robot will retrieve the bags at the end. Evaluations will then be repeated at the end. Clinicians and 
caregivers will be consulted to determine how to tailor robot tasks to each consented patient. After each 
usability test period, participants and their caregivers will have the opportunity to ®ll out a global 
interaction survey about the experience and provide information on how to improve the robot for future 
usability testing periods. The entire interaction will last for 1.5-2 hours maximum. Year 3:  An improved 
prototype, consisting of the mobile base incorporating improvements from the 1st round of assessments 
and an arm plus articulated gripper will be tested with elders and clinicians at LIFE and/or a LIFE-
af®liated retirement community for 4 weeks. The robot tasks evaluated will involve mobility and 
Page 10 of 13complex manipulation services such as opening doors etc. Data will be analyzed and results on robots 
usability will be pro
vided as feedback to the development team in order to improve system. Overall, 
focus groups will be used throughout to assess and evaluate users interaction and experiences. Data will 
be collected by [CONTACT_501433]©s utility and progress. Research questions 
R2 and R3 will be addressed.  a. Key usability and acceptance of service features required for the 
development of new manipulation technology are affordable, safe, and usable will be identi®ed and 
appropriate metrics developed. b. Health status of subject participant will be tracked over years [ADDRESS_645857] with the participant. Training and evaluation: Before each 
version of the robot is placed into service, demonstration and training sessions will occur where all 
potential clinical and elder users will be invited to learn about the robot and the experiment. Those 
willing to participate in a week-long study will sign informed consents. Data will be collected from the 
robot during the testing service and post -interviews will be conducted with a subset of participants to 
assess acceptance, problems and productivity issues. Participating elder members must agree to wear a 
tracking bracelet that will serve as an identi®er allowing the robot to recognize a person and as alternate 
means of gathering activity data.

Analysis Plan
The audio recorded tapes will be transcribed by a professional transcriptionist after each focus group 
session, and con
versations will be preserved exactly as they occurred. Video may also be recorded. 
Digital video and audio ®les will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_99628] a University of Pennsylvania secured research drive 
which will be established speci®cally for this project. The audio ®les will then be sent to a 
transcriptionist through Penn Secure Share. Upon receipt of he transcripts, the researchers will con®rm 
accuracy of each transcription against the recordings. Recordings and transcriptions will be kept in a 
password protected ®le/locked cabinet. Transcriptions will be uploaded to Atlas.ti, which is a data 
management software speci®cally designed for the qualitative analysis of large bodies of textual, 
graphical, audio and video data. Use of Atlas.ti will support coding units of text required for level one 
codes and synthesizing them into multiple levels of codes culminating in theme identi®cation. Analysis 
of the transcripts will be done on an on-going basis using content analysis. This process begins with 
level one coding in which the researchers analyze the text line by [CONTACT_4548]. At this level coding is 
substantive, codifying the substance of the data using both the actual words participants used 
themselves and implicit codes the researchers develop. Following level one coding, level two coding 
requires comparing level one codes and developi[INVESTIGATOR_501423]. During the level two categorization 
phase, researchers ensure that categories appropriately re¯ect the concepts suggested by [CONTACT_501434]. The ®nal phase of coding, level three coding, identi®es the central themes 
that emerge from the data. Summary statistics on the demographics questionnaire will also be 
calculated as part of the analysis plan.  Anticipated Outcomes: The validation phase will provide 
answers to the key questions: 1. How does the robot impact the clinical staff? We anticipate that the 
robot service would provide a bene®t to the clinical staff by [CONTACT_501435], use of time, and number of people able to be served. 2. How does 
the robot impact the elders? We anticipate that the robot service would provide a bene®t to the elders 
and increase their overall quality of life measured in terms of its ability to increase their overall mood, 
increase their engagement with the staff and each other, as well as help them to feel more competent/
independent.  3. How usable was the robot? We anticipate that the usefulness and usability of the robot 
is key to acceptance and satisfaction. We will measure usability in terms of ease of use, set-up time, # of 
faults/errors, and # of hours in operation without errors. We will evaluate our research questions de®ne 
®nal metrics for assessment of outcomes.

Consent
1. Consent Process
Overview
Subjects will recei
ve a consent form at least 24 hours prior to the study session. This will allow subjects 
suf®cient time to read over the form on their own, and come up with any questions or concerns prior to 
the commencement of sessions. Before a session begins, study personnel will review the consent form 
and experimental procedure with subjects and answer any questions. All participants will then be given 
the opportunity to sign the consent form with study personnel witnessing. Any subjects that decline to 
sign the consent form will be dismissed at that time.
Risk / Bene®t
Potential Study Risks
The risks are minimal and all testing will be non-in
vasive.  Subjects may experience frustration using 
the robot due to dif®culty understanding instructions and multi-component directives. Care will be 
taken to use 8th grade language this is often an IRB requirement and to deliver surveys verbally and in 
person. The robot interface will be as simple as possible to enable elder interaction and use. Additional

e
xercise  3. Frustration during use with the robot 4. Interaction with Robot gripper when passing an 
object Subjects may experience discomfort or embarrassment due to actions by [CONTACT_166736]. Efforts will 
be made to ensure privacy in communication of sensitive reminders.  Subjects may experience 
discomfort or embarrassment sharing their thoughts in a focus group setting. Efforts will be made to 
foster an atmosphere of impartiality, con®dentiality and sensitivity to allow subjects to feel free to 
communicate their opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153].  Subjects may bump into robot and experience pain or muscle bruising. 
The robot will be equipped with obstacle avoidance sensors, alarms etc to allow it to alert and avoid 
elders. In the case of failure, an emergency stop button can be applied.  Subjects may experience fatigue 
due to walking, frustration while interacting with the robot, and while we will do everything possible to 
avoid fails, the risk does increase slightly.  For unforeseen challenges, we will work closely with LIFE 
and the staff to resolve.
Potential Study Bene®ts
The bene®t is not to the indi
vidual subjects as it would be to the overall outcome of elderly care. We 
anticipate that Elders and clinicians will provide valuable insights into the development process of this 
robot. If successful, the robot will be able to be commercialized in the future.

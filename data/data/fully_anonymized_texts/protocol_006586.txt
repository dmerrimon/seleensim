Background and Significance: Approximately 73,000 patients will be diagnosed with bladder 
cancer in the US in 2013. Of these, 30% will have muscle-invasive1 for which surgical therapy 
via a radical cystectomy (RC) with urinary diversion is the standard of care. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_13926]-operative care, RC remains 
extremely morbid with rates of complications, readmissions, and 90-day perioperative mortality 
approaching 50%, 30%, and 7% respectively.2,3 Thus strategies to reduce RC patients’ morbidity 
and suffering are needed. 
One such potential strategy is to improve patients’ post-operative pain management.  Not only 
does post-operative pain contribute to patient suffering, pain (and lack of pain control) may also 
contribute to perioperative morbidity. For example, pain decreases patient ambulation following 
surgery, which in turn is associated with a number of post-operative complications, including 
thromboembolic events, for which the incidence (3.7%) in the RC population is the highest 
among surgical patients. [ADDRESS_13334]-operative ileus, 
which effects nearly 20% of RC patients 6 and is a major cause of prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Consequently, strategies aimed at improving pain control and reducing narcotic requirements 
could be beneficial in reducing both patient discomfort and the development of complications. 
Recently, the use of perioperative gabapentin has been evaluated in a number of surgical 
populations as a strategy to improve patient pain control and reduce total analgesic requirements. 
7 For example, a recent placebo controlled randomized trial demonstrated that 1,200 mg 
gabapentin given in the pre-operative suite prior to hysterectomy was associated with improved 
patient perception of pain on visual analog scale for 24 hours and an approximately 35% 
decrease in narcotic use over the first [ADDRESS_13335]-operatively. 8 Similarly, in another study, 
patients receiving preoperative gabapentin prior to open cholecystectomy had an approximately 
25% relative reduction in analgesic requirements, as well as significantly decreased 
postoperative pain and nausea/vomiting compared to those receiving placebo. 9 Based on these 
encouraging data, we propose a double blind placebo controlled randomized trial evaluating the 
use of perioperative gabapentin in patients undergoing RC.   
Study Population: We will include 44 adult patients with a diagnosis of bladder cancer 
undergoing radical cystectomy with urinary diversion (ileal conduit ororthotopic neobladder, etc)

Current	Version:	2/2017	Study Design: The proposed study is a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial 
studying the use of perioperative oral gabapentin (1,200 mg (4 X 300 mg caps) one hour before 
surgery plus 300 mg 3x’s daily for 48 hours) as an adjunct pain medication in the RC population. 
Following IRB approval and with informed consent, we plan to recruit 44 patients undergoing 
RC at UWMC to achieve a power of 0.8 at α <0.[ADDRESS_13336] a 30% difference in 
analgesic requirement over 48 hrs. Patients will be randomized 1:1 into receiving gabapentin as 
outlined above or a placebo designed to look like 300 mg caps with the same dosing. Patients 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_13933]. Study medications will be administered by [CONTACT_13934]-operative suite and on the floor.  The surgical and anesthesia/pain service team will be 
blinded to the group assignment. Following RC, all patients will receive our standard post-
operative pain management regiment, including scheduled acetaminophen (every 6 hours) and 
ketorolac (every 8 hours) and morphine patient-controlled analgesia, and will be transitioned to 
oral narcotics as clinically indicated , generally at [ADDRESS_13337]-op. Patients’ postoperative pain 
will be assessed on a verbally administered numerical pain scale (NPS) (0-10 scale) at time 0 
(arrival in the recovery room) and at 1  ± 0.25, 4 ± 0.25, 12 ± 0.25, 24 ± 0.25  and 48 ± 0.[ADDRESS_13338]-RC by [CONTACT_13935]’ nurse and prospectively recorded in the patients ’ chart and abstracted by

Sample Size: Based on a power calculation , to achieve a power of 0.8 at α <0.[ADDRESS_13340] a 30% difference in 48 hour with mean morphine equivalents , with population mean of 
100 ± 50 mg we plan to enroll a total of 44 patients undergoing RC for a diagnosis of bladder 
cancer, including 22 patients in each arm. 
 
Study Duration: Based on an annual RC volume of 100 cases/year, we anticipate approximately 
7-10 patients will be eligible for our study per month. Assuming a 50% acceptance rate for 
enrollment in a clinical trial, we believe that ac crual will take approximately  12 months. 
 
Objectives:  
 Primary Objectives:  
1) To assess  if perioperative gabapentin will decrease post -operative analgesic 
requirements within the first 48 hours after RC in patients undergoing RC as 
measured morphine equivalents  
 Secondary Objectives:  
1) To assess  patient self -assessment of postoperative pain on NPS at 24 and 48 hours 
2) To assess  time to return of bowel function (ROBF) 
3) To assess  length of stay (LOS) following RC 
 
Recruitment: Recruitment will be done for patients who are consenting to undergo a radical 
cystectomy with urinary diversion for a diagnosis of bladder cancer. Prior to initiation of 
recruitment, all clinic staff will undergo a briefing by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wright and the study team describing 
the study, its goals, and methodology. At the first clinic visit in which radical cystectom y is 
discussed with the patients for their diagnosis of bladder cancer, possible participants will be 
screened for enrollment in the study.  Possible participants will then for their diagnosis of 
bladder cancer, the patient will have the study described to them. If the patient  expresses interest, 
informed consent will be obtained. Participants  will be provided with a copy of the study design, 
IRB approval and Study Procedure Chart. Following informed consent, the patient will be 
scheduled for RC per routine care. Participants will be under no obligation to participate in the 
study and the decision whether or not to perform surgery will not be affected based on patient 
participation. All enrolled patients PHI will be stored in a locked office and all electronic PHI 
will be stored on password protected/encrypted computers and/or drives within the UW 
Department of Urology.

Study Procedures:  
 
After consent is obtained during the clinic visit, the participant will be scheduled for RC per 
standard procedure. Participants will then undergo randomization, stratified by [CONTACT_13936] (50% chance of receiving gabapentin) for both male and female 
patients. A third party member not involved in the study design or write -up will place participant 
study arm randomization status within a sealed envelope. On the date of surgery, the sealed 
envelope will be opened by [CONTACT_13937] 
(gabapentin or placebo) will be assigned and dispensed to the participant as described.  
 
Participants will be administered an  oral dose of gabapentin (1,200 mg (4 X 300 mg caps) or an 
identical placebo (4 caps) one hour before surgery in the preoperative suite by [CONTACT_13938]. They will then undergo the planned procedure. Following RC, participants will be 
administered gabapentin 300 mg 3x’s daily by [CONTACT_5555] 48 hours or an identical placebo by [CONTACT_13939]. The surgical and anesthesia/pain service team will be blinded to the group 
assignment. Following RC, all patients will receive standard post-operative pain management, 
including acetaminophen, morphine patient -controlled analgesia per the acute pain service, 
toradol and will be transitioned to oral narcotics as clinically indicated. Patients’ postoperative 
pain will be assessed on NPS (0-10 scale) at time 0 (arriv al in the recovery room) and at 1  ± 
0.25, 4 ± 0.25, 12 ± 0.25, 24 ± 0.25 and 48 ± 0.[ADDRESS_13342]-RC. Each patient’s total analgesic 
use for the first [ADDRESS_13343]-op will be recorded and converted to total morphine equivalents  
using the Agency Medical Director's Group of Washington morphine equivalents calculator 
(http://www.agencymeddirectors.wa.gov/opi[INVESTIGATOR_13928].asp), as will time to first flatus and bowel 
movement, total LOS, and adverse events. Discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13929]’ s participation in the study. Subsequent follow-up and care will be per 
routine care for RC. 
 
Outcome Assessment:  The primary endpoint will be patient total equ ivalent analgesic 
requirement (morphine equivalents) for the first [ADDRESS_13344] 
flatus and bowel movement and LOS following RC as calculated from the date of surgery to the 
date of discharge. 
 
Statistical Analysis: Assessment of the primary outcome will be by [CONTACT_13940]-equivalents 
required over the first [ADDRESS_13345] 
with p<0.05 considered statistically significant. Th e secondary endpoints pain on NPS, time to

patients undergoing RC at UWMC to.  
 
Pharmaceutical Information: 
 
Gabapentin is a potent analgesic and anticonvulsant that illicits effects through unclear 
mechanisims. From an analgesic standpoint, gabapentin prevents allodynia (pain -related 
behavior in response to normally innocuous stimulus), hyperalgesia (exaggerated  response to 
painful stimuli), pain-related responses in several models of neuropathic pain, and decreases 
pain-related responses after peripheral inflammation. Currently gabapentin is FDA approved as 
an anticonvulsant and for post-herpetic neuralgia and is widely used clinically for management 
of neuropathic pain, other chronic pain sources, and increasingly as an adjunct therapy for 
perioperative pain. 
 
The drug comes in many forms including 100 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg and 800 mg 
capsules or an oral solution. Main adverse effects are related to the principal active ingredient. 
Gabapentin may case dizziness, somnolence and other symptoms and signs of central nervous 
system depression. Additionally, gabapentin is included in an FDA warning of a possible 
association between anticonvulsant use and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. However, in a meta -
analysis including greater than 131,000 patients gabapentin was use was not associated with a 
suicide attempts (3.48/1000 person years prior to gabapentin use vs.  3.45/1000 person years after 
gabapentin prescription).13 
 
Contraindications to use include hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.  
 
We will be utilizing UWMC Investigational Drug Services to provide both gabapentin (300 mg 
capsules) and placebo in identical capsules. Medications will be dispensed through UWMC 
Investigational Drug Services. 
 
Privacy and Confidentiality 
  
Human subject’s names will be kept on a password-protected database and will be linked with a 
study identification number for this study. All clinical data will be stored in a separate database 
using the study ID number without any patient identifiers. All data will be entered/stored on a 
password protected computer/drive. Written data will be stored in a locked office of the 
investigators and maintained for a maximum of three years after the completion of the study.  
 
Risk/Benefit 
 
Risk to Participants: The primary risk to participants during the study is adverse effects from the 
medication. Generally, however, gabapentin is well tolerated with the most common side effects 
9274

Current	Version:	2/2017	being dizziness and somnolence for which patients will be closely monitored. Since the 
medication will be given as part of  the participants’ otherwise routine post-operative care, we do 
not anticipate other changes to their post-operative care 
 
Benefits: The study will provide level-1 evidence regarding the use of perioperative gabapen tin 
in a patient population exposed to considerable perioperative pain and morbidity related to RC 
for management of bladder cancer. If efficacious, perioperative gabapentin could significantly 
reduce perioperative analgesic (narcotic) use while improving perioperative pain and 
convalescence in a high-risk patient population, thereby [CONTACT_13941].  
 
Data Safety Monitoring: An independent safety monitoring board will meet every 6 months to 
monitor for adverse events. Any unexpected severe adverse event (SAE) identified will be 
reported to the FDA within 7 days. 
 
Severe Adverse Events: According to the FDA, SAE are defined as “Death, a life -threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909], a persistent or 
significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect .” Additionally, “Important medical events that may not result in 
death, be life -threate ning, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. ” All patients will be 
monitored  for AEs throughout their h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. Any event determined to be a SAE by [CONTACT_13942] (21	CFR	 312.32(c)(1)(i)). 	
 
Publications/Presentations: Data produced from this study will be presented at academic 
meetings/forums and will be submitted for publication in pertinent scientific journals (ie., 
Journal of Urology)  
 
Funding: This study will be funded in part by [CONTACT_13943]-staff 
Association grant “Randomized placebo control trial of perioperative gabapentin to reduce total 
analgesic requirements in patients undergoing radical cystectomy” awarded to Drs. Wright and 
Schade.

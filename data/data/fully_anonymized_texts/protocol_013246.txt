Brain connectivity and response to Tai Chi in geriatric depression.  
The study will focus on clinical outcomes and biomarkers of treatment response of 
Tai Chi Chih use compared to Health Education in geriatric depression. Biomarkers of response 
will include multimodal MRI and exploratory measures of gene expression and inflammatory 
markers.

interventions using fMRI biomarkers in [ADDRESS_852997]  mood and functional improvement linked 
with TCC using fMRI markers over the course of the 12 weeks, and will follow maintenance of 
response in follow -ups at 6 and 12 months (or [ADDRESS_852998] passed). [ADDRESS_852999] multimodal MRI eva luation. We anticipate that improvement in depression and cognition 
will be accompanied by [CONTACT_638029].  
 
This study incorporates a multidisciplinary investigative team from several centers at UCLA 
including the Semel Institute ([CONTACT_547428], PI), and Ahmanson Lovelace Brain Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_547344] 
([CONTACT_547429]), as well as benefits from health+wellness education ([CONTACT_547431] and statistical expertise ([CONTACT_638058], SI -STAT and [CONTACT_547430]), and the availability of the cohorts for recruitment from 2 
sites. We plan to assess the ability of the TCC to induce faster and durable remission, and lasting 
benefits in mood and cognition compared to those in the control group (HEW) as well as the 
mechanisms (predictors/moderators) of treatment response to each of the elements of combined 
intervention.  
1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objective  
Aim 1:  Evaluate the effects of TCC versus HEW on reduction of depressive symptoms and 
improvement in the secondary outcomes during the 12- week treatment trial, in addition to 6 and 
12 month follow -up (or [ADDRESS_853000] passed).  
 
Hypothesis 1: Compared to HEW, TCC  will result in a) greater  reduction of depressive symptoms 
and b) improvement in the cognitive domains of executive function and memory at 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12- month follow -up (or [ADDRESS_853001] passed).  
1.[ADDRESS_853002]/moderate treatment response.   
 Hypothesis 2a:   Compared to HEW, TCC will lead to improved functional connectivity in the 
Default Mode Network as measured with resting state (rs -) fMRI;  
 
Hypothesis 2b: Compared to HEW, TCC  will result in greater activation in the anterior cingulate;  
 
Hypothesis 2c:  Imaging biomarkers ( hippocampal and anterior cingulate volume, white matter 
hyperintensity and DMN connectivity) will moderate and predict 1) rate of improvement in 
symptoms and function; and 2) improvement in cognitive performance.  
 Aim 3.  To examine whether older depressed participants with MCI (LLD+MCI) differ in their 
cognitive trajectory and neural circuitry compared to older depressed participants without MCI  
(LLD-MCI) at extended follow -up of 6 and 12 months.    
 Hypothesis 3a:  We hypothesize that changes in epi[INVESTIGATOR_637994]+MCI than in those with LLD -MCI.  
 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  8 of 47 Version 7.4 
  02 APR  2020  Hypothesis 3b:  We hypothesize that changes in the default mode/hippocampal -frontal network 
and in the executive- contr ol and cortico- limbic circuitry will be greater in those with LLD+MCI than 
in those with LLD -MCI.  
 
Aim 4.  To examine whether greater degradation of neural circuitry is associated with greater 
cognitive decline.  
 
Hypothesis 4: We hypothesize that changes i n default mode/hippocampal -frontal network and 
executive- control and cortico- limbic circuitry will be associated with decline in epi[INVESTIGATOR_637995].  
 
Exploratory Aim 1:  We will explore the role of treatment -resistance or poor response t o the 
intervention in predicting cognitive outcomes.  
    
Exploratory Aim 2: We will follow a subset of participants (those recruited within 2 years of the 
initial evaluation) to assess clinical trajectory of mood and cognitive symptoms with 24- month 
follow -up.  
            
     
Exploratory aim 3:  We will explore the difference in changes in gene expression and peripheral 
pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with clinical response to the interventions. To use 
peripheral blood to conduct transcriptome profiling with the same R01 protocols to identify 
gene expression and peripheral inflammatory biomarkers correlates of clinical response to TCC 
versus HEW.   
 
Exploratory Hypothesis 3:  Treatment response to TCC or HEW will be associated with changes 
in expression of inflammation, neuroplasticity -related genes and peripheral biomarkers (e.g. 
cytokines, telomerase), and baseline levels of these genes and cytokines will predict future clinical 
response.  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Background on Conditio n, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
Later -life major depression and depressive symptoms (LLD) have a prevalence of 5- 15% in 
community -dwelling elderly associated with a significant risk of high rates of relapse, morbidity, 
mortality, and suicide.1-3 Over 60% of the depressed elderly fail to achieve symptomatic remission 
and functional recovery with pharmacotherapy,4,5 accompanied by [CONTACT_638030] g cognitive 
dysfunction and poor health function.6-8 Finding new treatments that enhance functioning of the 
“aging tsunami” is thus a national imperative.9,[ADDRESS_853003] control groups in older adults ( -0.27 (95% CI -0.52 to -0.02, P=0.03 ).11 In another recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_637996], 12 Tai Chi practice reduced somatic symptoms of depression. Our 
preliminary data
13 demonstrates that Tai Chi Chih (TCC), a “movement meditation,” enhances 
treatment with the antidepressant, escitalopram, in LLD. As compared to depressed elderly randomized to escitalopram and health education and wellness training (HEW) (n=37), those 
receiving escitalopram and TCC (n=36) exhibited greater rates of remission, greater clinical, 
health and cognitive improvement and reduced markers of inflammation, which also prospectively 
predict depressive symptoms.
7,14,15 TCC is a brief standardized version of Tai Chi that offers 
consistent training and practice schedules;16,[ADDRESS_853004] icity 
and connectivity in response to TCC compared to HEW during a 12- week acute trial with 6 month 
and 12 month follow -up (or [ADDRESS_853005] passed). We will overcome limitations 
of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_637997] h major depression who have been on 
a stable form of treatment for at least [ADDRESS_853006] not achieved remission and still meet 
criteria for an epi[INVESTIGATOR_637998]. We will also compare TCC to the HEW control gr oup to control for non-
specific attention and social support effects ( HEW) (active attention control group). This 
will allow us to estimate the effect sizes of each intervention for future studies, potentially leading to the development of preventive interventions for major depression in older 
adults.  
 
Cognitive and neuroimaging biomarkers of LLD and treatment response – what do we 
know and what can we learn?  The identification of state and trait biomarkers of brain function 
have provided additional knowledge about the mechanisms of geriatric depression.20,[ADDRESS_853007] impairments in ‘top down’ cognitive control 22-
25 with reduced  neural activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC).26 However, increased  activity in 
cortical/subcortical regions critical to memory,27 planning28 and attention tasks ,29-31 may be due to 
compensatory mechanisms relating to cognitive impairments.32-34 These brain activation patterns; 
as well as reports of decreased striatal response during sequence learning in normal aging,35 but 
increased activity in the depressed elderly36 may also distinguish normal aging from LLD. 
Conversely, tasks of emoti onal regulation recruit  ‘limbic’ emotional regions such as the amygdala 
and striatum37,38 with a more ‘bottom up ’ pattern of altered processing.22,39-44Assessment of the 
neural correlates of emotional processing and affect labeling will complement our other primary 
(mood) and secondary outcomes (cognitive, health functioning, and fMRI biomarkers of executive 
function and working memory – Aim 1) to address both “bottom -up” and “top -down” altered 
processing models. Systems- level functional connectivity may also act as a biomarker of 
treatment response in major depression as has been demonstrated for an emotional face-
matching task specifically in OFC networks following a [ADDRESS_853008]’s cognitive abilities as can limit the investigative 
power of task -related fMRI and may thus further reveal  which brain systems account for (and 
predict) depressive symptoms in LLD and vary with respect to treatment outcome . rs-fMRI allows 
the study of brain network activity by [CONTACT_638031]- oxygen- level dependent (BOLD) -related 
synchronous neural activity in spatially distinct brain regions while a person is at rest. Altered 
connectivity in “default mode” (DMN) network nodes46,47 has been reported in major depression48-
51 and in LLD specifically. DMN connec tivity has been shown to link with white -matter 
hyperintensities (WMH); supporting the hypotheses that disconnection in functionally distinct 
networks might c ontribute to depression.52 Recent evidence also demonstrates treatment -related 
changes in resting state connectivity in depression in fronto- limbic regions following 
antidepressant48 and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).53,54 Further, previous work has shown that 
DMN activity relates to engagement of ‘task positive’ networks involved in effortful cognition, and 
that these relationships differ in major depression and associate with maladaptive rumination.55 
Functional imaging has proven an important tool for  visualizing the mechanisms of antidepressant 
action40,56- 59-80; the proposed research will newly address the mechanisms of treatment response 
to TCC in LLD.60 LLD is also linked with structural brain abnormalities including global and regional 
brain tissue reductions , particularly in PFC/ACC, striatal and hippocampal regions,61-[ADDRESS_853009] Guidelines and Considerations  10 of 47 Version 7.4 
  02 APR  2020  hippocampus, amygdala and VLPFC,62,63,66,69- 71 including in LLD. 70,71 94,9 5,91- 94 Early evidence also 
suggests gray matter variations in fronto- limbic circuits may be predictive of treatment 
outcome.58,72 To complement our fMRI outcome measures (Aims 1 and 2), we will address 
whether changes in brain structure in fronto- limbic regions and WMH s, will change or differ as a 
consequence of TCC or HEW interventions. We will predict future response/relapse, and will 
relate the results to our other outcome measures. Since longitudinal evidence suggests that 1) 
antidepressants affect functional connec tivity, including in LLD,48,53,54,73 and 2) short -term 
integrative body -mind training or meditation alters functional as well as structural connectivity in 
the ACC74,75 and in auditory/salience and medial visual networks76 over short time frames (4- 8 
wks), it is reasonable to predict that TCC will lead to more pronounced changes in functional 
connectivity and structural plasticity than HEW (Aims 1 -2). 
2.2 Study Rationale  
Rationale for duration of interventions and follow -up, and masking procedures : 1) The 
proposed study uses some elements of the design used in our R21 pi[INVESTIGATOR_637999], double- blind assignment and masking procedures to treatment 
groups, and the [ADDRESS_853010] of TCC versus 
HEW to explore the role of biomarkers as predictors and moderators of the response. Those who agree to follow -up and do not demonstrate response or show worsening will be encouraged to 
seek treatment alternatives that will be documented in the chart and controlled for in analyses 
(e.g. types of trea tments, dose, and duration). Most participants will be treated in UCLA clinics 
and their treatment records will be available for review of response patterns . Follow -up of 6 and 
12 months (or [ADDRESS_853011] passed)  will allow us to document maintenance of 
symptoms improvement, relapse of major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], and compare the rates of 
maintained remission between the groups, as well as predictor/moderator effects of the 
biomarkers.  
 
New knowledge – establishing  biomarkers of treatment efficacy : This project will address 
fundamental gaps in scientific knowledge in identifying biomarkers of response to TCC compared 
to 2 control conditions HEW. The use of a control group is innovative and will allow us to control 
for nonspecific support elements in the HEW group. The proposed research extends our pi[INVESTIGATOR_638000]. We will also expand longitudinal assessments  up to 24 months 
to monitor possible relapse into major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], and worsening of depressive symptoms, that will also integrate response with cognitive performance and with the fMRI probes 
of emotional processing and working memory and rs -fMRI m easures of functional connectivity. 
Moreover, this study will “zero in” on the mechanisms TCC effect on emotional regulation thus 
testing relevant stress -responsivity pathways. Clinical and scientific impact of biomarkers:  
Inclusion of biomarkers in studies of clinical response may help identify the subgroups of older 
adults who are more likely to benefit from TCC, or those at increased risk for relapse, which would 
be important for clinical practice.  
 
Innovation.  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_853012] found the TCC program to be very well received by [CONTACT_589025].  
Tai Chi Chih:  TCC and other mind -body interventions are directed toward combining aerobic 
exercise with stress- reduction and structured mindful cognitive approaches that add to 
improvement in mood and self -esteem. TCC is also known as a “CHI - generating mindful 
exercise. 77 The search for the mechanisms of change has focused on two components, relaxation 
and exercise. In a meta- analysis on the effects of relaxation training, Hyman et al. found that 
various relaxation response- based interventions led to a reduction of somatic symptoms with 
additional effects on symptoms of anxiety and depression,78 blood pressure,79 and recovery from 
immune -mediated diseases.78,80 As observed in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268],81 TCC in combination escitalopram, 
appears beneficial for enhancing tr eatment in LLD, an approach that may readily incorporated 
into future clinical practice. Comparing a Chi -generating exercise (TCC) to a comparable non- chi 
generating exercise is innovative and may shed light on the difference between the two in clinical 
outcomes (mood, health functioning and quality of life), and the underlying mechanism.  
Longitudinal design and long -term follow -up: The goals of behavioral and drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_638001], thereby [CONTACT_638032].5,82,83 Remission rates in clinical trials of antidepressant drugs in older 
adults are around 30- 35%.84 Extended treatment trials are necessary to optimize interventions for 
depressive symptoms in older adults.85,86 Hence, we propose to use a 12 -week acute treatment 
trial to also satisfy the TCC training objectives. Follow -ups at 6 and 12 months will evaluate 
maintenance of response/remission or depression relapse (or [ADDRESS_853013] 
passed).  Notably, ver y few studies designed to establish the mechanisms of treatment response 
in the elderly have included extended follow -up. 
Primary and secondary outcome measures:  Using fMRI biomarkers of emotional responsivity 
and affect labeling, and working memory, in addition to clinical measures, during therapeutic 
manipulation at two time periods is highly innovative. More importantly, this study will examine 
neural regulation of affect as a putative biological mechanism for the effects of the interventions, 
thereby [CONTACT_638033]. If our hypotheses are correct, our approach will inform public and clinical 
practice, and will provide currently missing information about the underlying mechanisms of response to TCC versus controls in geriatric depression.  
Image acquisition and analysis:  Multimodal imaging data obtained at 3T will include sequences 
designed for optimal trade- offs between acquisition time, spatial and temporal resolution, where 
each modality, not widely applied for the study of LLD, provides unique and complementary 
inform ation to better evaluate the neurobiological bases of treatment response. Further, we will 
apply advanced and innovative computational image analysis approaches for integrating data that are noticeably absent in the published literature, focusing on brain aging, connectivity and 
plasticity and associations with cognition and other health outcomes. The application of a 
comprehensive imaging protocol for evaluating treatment response may advance understanding of the mechanisms underlying LLD and treatment -induced brain plasticity and impact clinical 
practice by [CONTACT_638034].  
Timeliness : The use of mind- body interventions will be shortly “in -demand” and highly beneficial 
for the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_638002] “baby -boomers” who have higher rates of 
depression, and are more likely to use such treatments to prevent or treat the symptoms. 
Demonstrating the efficacy of such interventions and underlying mechanisms in older adults is 
becoming a research priority.   
 
Design and outcomes   
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  12 of 47 Version 7.4 
  02 APR  2020  Interventions and Duration We anticipate screening about 500 subjects to recruit 220 older 
depressed adults ( >[ADDRESS_853014] a range of depressive symptoms and will 
be on stable treatment (antidepressant or psychotherapy) for at least [ADDRESS_853015] therapy to the stable antidepressant regimen. Follow -ups will confirm clinical 
endpoints of stable remission and the overall improvement in depression and cognition at Months 
6 and 12 (or Month [ADDRESS_853016] already passed).  
Interventions and Duration  
Intervention 1 - Tai Chi Chih (TCC) : TCC employs “meditation through movement” as a means 
of helpi[INVESTIGATOR_638003], perceived physical limitations, and negative emotional 
states, which are commonly associated with insomnia.  
Intervention 2 - Health and Wellness Education (HEW) control group : This condition will 
serve as an  active control for nonspecific treatment elements such as attention and group support 
that pose rival explanations for the effectiveness of TCC. Participants will be informed that this 
intervention is designed to help reduce the severity of depressive sym ptoms, and all participants 
will be offered a choice of TCC in the end of the interventions, to balance expectations for the TCC intervention; therefore, reducing the placebo effect.  
Duration of Interventions:  Each class will be held for 60 minute per day /week. Each TCC class 
will allow 10 minutes of warm -up (e.g., stretching, breathing), [ADDRESS_853017] 20 minutes 
of either TCC, or computer searches on the topi[INVESTIGATOR_638004]. Participants will be asked 
to keep diaries of daily exercises, time spent and adherence to the tasks will be compared 
between the groups, and will be used in the analyses of response.  
 
Sample Size and Population  
Subjects:  We will recruit [ADDRESS_853018] and the Office of Protection of Research Subjects, as well as 
the analogous units at participating institutions. We anticipate a maximum of 10% dropout in the 
first 12 weeks; hence, we will have 99 completers per group at 12 weeks ; and an additional 
20% dropout at  the end of the follow -up period of 12 months (or [ADDRESS_853019] 
passed) ( 88 completers per group ).   
4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
SOP: Patients will be assessed at screening and at baseline prior to the initiation of the intervention and biweekly thereafter until 12 weeks, and monthly between 3 and 6 month follow -
up. There will also be a final Month 12 follow -up. If unable to schedule this final follow -up, 
participant will follow- up at Month 24 instead. Those who meet criteria after a telephone 
screening, will be invited for an in- person screening interview that may be split into 1- 3 visits to 
accommodate clinical, neuropsychological, MRI and laboratory procedures. Baseline assessment 
(“Baseline 2”) will be performed within 2 mo nths of the start of the interventions. The informed 
consent form will be reviewed with the participant, and signed prior to initiation of the 
assessments. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed using the inclusion/exclusion 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_853020] day of 
TCC and HEW classes.  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Inclusion criteria : All [ADDRESS_853021] major depression and will 1) be on stable 
treatment for at least 4 months and still meet criteria for major depression; 2) Have a 24- item 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) score of > 14 at baseline consistent with m oderate -
severe depression; and 3) Have a Mini -Mental State Exam (MMSE) score > 24.  
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Exclusion criteria : subjects will be excluded if they had any current other psychiatric disorders 
(except for frequently comorbid anxiety symptoms or  insomnia), are receiving effective 
antidepressant and psychotropic medications or psychotherapy; or have had recent unstable 
medical or neurological disorders (myocardial infarction within past [ADDRESS_853022] 3 
months); any disabilities prev enting their participation in TCC exercise per PI’s discretion; prior 
experience with practicing a mind- body intervention (defined as Tai Chi, Tai Chi Chih, yoga, 
meditation) or have practiced it at least weekly within the past 12 months; diagnosis of deme ntia; 
those with metal implants that contraindicate brain imaging. Please see Tables 1 and 3 for detailed 
assessment schedul es. 
Exclusion criteria for fMRI:  1) acute medical and neurological illness 2) evidence of metal in the 
body; 3) claustrophobia; 4) decline consent. Subjects that are only excluded from the fMRI portion 
of the study are allowed to remain in the study.  
4.[ADDRESS_853023] 
and the Office of Protection of Research Subjects, as well as the anal ogous units at participating 
institutions (e.g., Motion Pi[INVESTIGATOR_638005]). We project a recruitment period of 4.4 
years to achieve a study group of 220 subjects . With the anticipated average of about 4 
subjects/month. The incentive to participat e appears sufficient since the proposed project offers 
free TCC and HEW classes to every enrolled patient. In addition, two additional avenues are 
being developed, such as collaboration with the LA County Department of Mental Health.  
 
We project our minor ity recruitment at 30%.  If the rate of recruitment is not sufficient through the 
UCLA clinical and research services, advertising in local newspapers will be used. Recruitment through local support groups for depressed patients will also be attempted. [CONTACT_547428] also has 
links to the local community of care providers for the elderly and to mental health professionals, who could serve as a source of referrals. She serves as a Consultant to the LA County 
Department of Mental Health Services for older adult s, an outreach program which should help 
recruit minority participants. The anticipated rate of recruitment is 39 subjects in year 1 and 40 in year 5 and 47 subjects per year in years 2 -4 to accommodate 12/24-month follow -up, a realistic 
rate for our study . Data analysis will be performed in year 5. We anticipate the dropout to be about 
10% in the first 12 weeks, and additional 20 % at 12/[ADDRESS_853024]  ACTIVITIES

  02 APR  2020  5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration   
Each class will be held for 60 minute per day/week. Homework assignments will be equal in all 
groups and ask for at least 20 minutes of either TCC, or computer searches on the topi[INVESTIGATOR_638006]. Participants will be asked to keep diaries of daily exercises, time spent and 
adherence to the tasks will be compared between the groups, and used as a predictor/mediator in the primary analyses of response. All classes will be offered once a month as booster session 
for the remainder of the study between w eeks 12 and 24. Subjects will be given a DVD of the 
training course and encouraged to continue practice at home. Subjects in the HEW group will be 
asked not to join any of the TCC classes until the end of the study. At the end of the study, 
participants will be offered an option of participating in the two alternative classes.  
 
 
Tai Chi Chih (TCC) : TCC employs “meditation through movement” as a means of helpi[INVESTIGATOR_638007], perceived physical limitations, and negative emotional states, w hich are 
commonly associated with insomnia. Patients will be informed that TCC constitutes a health 
management intervention, which incorporates meditation and physical activity to promote a sense 
of well -being and control over negative symptoms associated with depression. The standard 
detailed protocol for TCC uses an adapted protocol from the “Tai -Chi-Chih Joy through 
movement” by [CONTACT_638035] F. Stone141 and has been used in several studies by [CONTACT_116225], 
and others (i.e., R21 -AT002307) . TCC sessions will be held for 60 min a day once a week. Each 
class will allow 10 minutes of warm -up (e.g., stretching, breathing), 5 minutes of cool down.  
Participants will be instructed to practice at home for 20 minutes per day using handouts and documenting their practice in their daily diaries.  
 
Health and Wellness Education (HEW) control group : This condition will serve as an active 
control for nonspecific treatment elements such as attention and group support that pose rival 
explanations for the effectiveness of TCC. Participants will be informed that this intervention is 
designed to help reduce the severity of depressive symptoms, and all participants will be offered 
a choice of TCC in the end of the interventions, to balance expectations for the TCC intervention; therefore, reducing the placebo effect. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_638008] 
a manual that will present educational information and describe learning objectives and patient activities to promote integration of material. The detailed protocol for Health Education has been 
developed and used in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080]. The HEW sessions will be held once a week for [ADDRESS_853027] health education instructors will be used to monitor 
instructors’ adherence to the edu cational protocol. Tai Chi Chih trainers will follow the same 
manual. We will contact [CONTACT_638036]’ 
adherence to the manual protocol. Participants will be asked to keep diaries of exercise or 
computer searches and the adherence will be compared between the groups.   
5.[ADDRESS_853028] 4 months. 
However, if subjects engage in alternate treatments (other types of mind- body (e.g. yoga), 
integrative (e.g., acupuncture), psychotherapy, switching to different antidepressa nt treatment, or 
have an elective surgery or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), they will be advised to inform the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a designated 
staff at every visit. All assessments will be done blindly. If the alternate treatment is judged to 
affect outcomes of the study, the subject will be withdrawn from the interventions but followed naturalistically for [ADDRESS_853029] a variable identifying the type of antidepressants or any other psychotropic drugs or other prescription or over -the –counter medications/supplements that participants are 
taking. Classes of drugs will be recorded as well.  
5.4 Adherence Assessment  
SOP: Weekly supervision by [CONTACT_976] - Lavretsky with designated study staff will be used to monitor 
adherence to the intervention and protocol during each group and clini cal visit and during weekly 
staff meetings. Participants will be asked to keep diaries of exercise or computer searches and 
the adherence will be compared between the groups. Subjects will not be removed from the study 
due to poor adherence to retain suffi cient sample for the analyses. If they decide to drop out from 
the intervention arms for any reasons, they will be followed naturalistically. Subjects who miss three or more intervention sessions will be identified as deviation from the protocol. Adherence  
will be calculated and used in the analyses as a covariate.     
5.5 COVID -19 Restrictions – Enacting March 2020  
As of March 2020, UCLA has enacted several restrictions on our campus to prevent COVID -19 
contraction and spread. In order to align with these s tandards, we are giving participants the 
option to participate virtually through web- based and telephone meetings. This will be offered for 
any appointment that is able to be completed remotely, as well as for both interventions the study 
is testing. This will include teleneuropsychological assessments as well. All remaining portions 
that are not possible to obtain remotely (e.g., MRI, venipuncture) will be obtained as close to the 
proposed visit date as possible.  
We will also instill a COVID- 19 Questi onnaire to all active participants to ensure optimal safety 
reporting and to correlate with current psychiatric measures. This will be administered as a survey, 
with the responses coming verbatim from the participant. The survey will be completed at one 
time point, but we will continue to track participants’ well -being through our administration of [LOCATION_006]U.  
6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
All study assessments will be conducted in a private examination room at either at UCLA Semel 
Institute or the UCLA Motion Pi[INVESTIGATOR_638009].  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  17 of 47 Version 7.4 
  02 APR  2020   
Screening Procedures (Screening / Visits 1a- c): The informed consent form will be reviewed 
with the participant during the first in- person visit. There will be general medical and psychiatric 
history taken, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse) (5 minutes duration), and an ECG 
(electrocardiogram) will be performed (25 minutes). The questionnaires and screening 
procedures are performed to determine eligibility. The initial visit will last approximately 2 hours.  
 
Clinical Assessments will be performed in 2 -3 visits due to participant’s burden: (Tables 
1;3). Diagnosis . The Structured Clinical Interview DSM -IVTR/ -5 (SCID)121 will be used to make a 
diagnosis of major depression or other mood disorders or rule out other diagnoses (e.g., 
psychosis and dementia) at screening . Inter -rater reliability  for all instruments will be establ ished 
at the beginning of the trial across both sites and all staff members on the first 5 recruited patients, it will be rechecked routinely twice a year for consistency throughout the study. Master level 
research associates supervised by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1317] t rained to reliability for the diagnostic interview 
(SCID) and other assessments. The current inter -rater correlation coefficient (ICC) for SCID 
ratings among SCID interviewers is ≥ 0.9. A second level of reliability check is afforded by a bi -
weekly diagnos tic consensus conference during which diagnosis is also confirmed.  
 
Blood Samples. During screening procedures between 1
st in-person visit and visit 2, blood will 
be drawn by [CONTACT_638037] (15 minutes). The blood samples will be processed at the UCLA Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC). 
Approximately 8 tablespoons of blood will be drawn.  This visit can be combined with either the 
visits for MRI or Cognitive testing visit.  
 Screening diagnostic  / Neuropsychological Evaluation Visit (Visit 2):  
[CONTACT_547428] or a designated member from the study staff will conduct a neuropsychiatric 
evaluation using cognitive assessments during Visit 2 that takes about 2- 3 hours.  
  
Visit 3. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scan. One MRI brain scan will be performed. The 
scan will occur at the UCLA Brain Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_547344]. MRI Safety metal screening will be performed. 
Only 55 pts/arm will undergo the fMRI procedure.  
 
Visit 4.  Baseline visit will be performed within 2 months prior to initiation of the interventions with 
assessment of mood and vital signs (30 min)  
 
Follow -Up Visits (Visits 4 -9 and 12 -13): Follow -up assessment will occur bi -weekly (every 2 
weeks) for [ADDRESS_853030] approximately 
30 minutes. Interviews and questionnaires will be used to determi ne if the treatment is working 
and useful. Adherence will be monitored at each visit. At each follow -up visit, vital signs will be 
measured (5 minutes), practice and homework log will be reviewed, and questionnaires will be 
administered (25 minutes).  
 
Weekly Tai Chi or Health and Wellness Education (12 classes): Weekly Tai Chi or health and 
wellness education training will occur every week for [ADDRESS_853031] approximately 60 minutes per class. Homework adherence and diaries will be 
monitored at each class.  
 Visits 10/11 and 14 -19- Outcomes and Endpoints. 12 week follow -up visit (Visit 10/11): During 
the final visit, a physical, psychiatric examination, and a follow -up blood draw for genetic analysis 
will be repeated. MRI will be repeated at 12 weeks. The follow -up visit 12 will be split in 2 visits 
(for clinical, cognitive, laboratory, and MRI) will last 4 hours (1 hour MRI). The [ADDRESS_853032] Guidelines and Considerations  18 of 47 Version 7.4 
  02 APR  2020  visit (14/15) will be approximately 1.5 hours.  Both the 12 - or 24-month follow -up visit will be split 
in 2 visits (for clinical, cognitive, laboratory, and MRI) will last 4 hours (1 hour MRI).  The Month 
12/[ADDRESS_853033] passed their Month 
12/24 time point. We will allow this visit to occur any time succeeding the Month 12 mark, and will 
note the visit type by [CONTACT_638038] (ie: Participant completes visit at Month 17, would 
be assigned to Month 12 Visit).  
6.1 Schedule of Evaluations  
 
Assessment schedule.  
 
6.2 Description of Evaluations   
Primary outcome measures will include efficacy evaluations using the 24- item HAMD110 to 
quantify mood symptoms. Secondary outcome measures  will include the Clinical Global 
Impression -Severity and Improvement scale (CGI)122 to quantify overall severity and clinical 
improvement over time (2 min). In addition, we will admini ster the Montgomery Asberg Depression 
Rating Scale (MADRS) - commonly administered in geriatric depression that is easily comparable 
to other trials, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS),123 a self -assessment scale often used 
in geriatric depr ession trials (10 min).  
Measures of comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms  will include the Hamilton Anxiety Scale,113 a 
widely used measure of anxiety symptoms (10 min), the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES),111 a 
measure of the severity of apathy (15 min), and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale 
(UPDRS)124 used for the assessment of psychomotor slowing and extrapyramidal symptoms (10 
min). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI) is an 18 item self -report measure of subjective sleep 
quality (5 min).125 
Measures of medical comorbidity  will include the Stroke Risk Factor Prediction Chart (SRF)126,127 
of the American Heart Association for rating cerebrovascular risk factors (5 min) and the 
Cumulative Illness Rating Scale- Geriatric (CIRS -G)128 used for rating the severity of chronic 
medical illness in 14 organ- systems (15 min). Health -Related  quality of life and physical 
functioning will be determined using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36- Item Health 
Survey (SF -36),129 that records heal th-related quality -of-life, mental, physical, and social 
functioning (15 min), the Connor -Davidson Resilience scale (CD -RISC), as a measure of stress 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_170301]130(5 min), the Quality of Life Enjoyment Scale (Q -LESS -Q),131 a brief assessment 
instrument of life satisfaction commonly used in clinical trials of psychiatric populations including the el derly (5 min). Pain assessment has been also included as a measure of self -rated pain to 
monitor any changes in the pain severity over time (5 min) We will also include a self -reported 
physical activity record for monitoring physical activity in both groups (3 min).

6.2.1  Screening Evaluation  
Consenting Procedure  
Prior to enrollment, during in -person screening visit (#1) the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -Is will obtain IRB -approved 
informed consent from subjects. The consent form will be reviewed w ith each subject prior to 
signing this consent form. All subjects will be offered an opportunity to discuss the study with their 
primary physicians and family members prior to signing the consent form.  
 
This will be followed by [CONTACT_638039], and laboratory tests (2 1/2 
hours). Though eligibility will be assessed again at baseline, participation may be terminated if 
the subject stops meeting entry criteria. No subject will be asked to discontinue effective 
antidepressant medicat ions or psychotherapy.    
Screening (Visits 1 -3) 
All subjects will receive an initial medical evaluation including a complete physical examination 
with neurological and neuropsychiatric examinations, electrocardiogram (ECG) (for potential cardiac complaints), and laboratory testing to rule out new -onset medical illnesses that could 
account for behavioral and  cognitive symptoms. All abnormal physical or laboratory findings will 
be reported to subjects’ primary physicians with subject’s consent. If abnormal physical or 
laboratory results are considered responsible for depression, the subject will be excluded fr om 
participation.  All subjects will be interviewed about their recent history of psychiatric and medical 
illnesses, psychosocial stressors, current medications and health status. In addition, vital signs 
including pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, and body weight will be obtained at each visit. The 
[LOCATION_006]U Side Effect Rating Scale,
[ADDRESS_853038] to functional skills. A MMSE score of < 24, the clinical dem entia rating score of CDR 
score >0.5 or an established dementia diagnosis will mandate exclusion. The evaluation for 
dementia includes: 1) an interview by a psychiatric nurse to identify physical and cognitive 
limitations; 2) a standard battery of hematolo gic studies; 3) neurological examination (UPDRS); 
3) neuropsychological examination (detailed below); and 4) psychiatric evaluation (SCID), as 
detailed above. Adjudication of dementia is based on DSM -5 criteria.110,111 At the consensus 
conference, additional information will be reviewed (e.g., family history, drug use).112 We will use 
performances between -1.5 and -2 (SD) below age and education norms on one of two memory 
tests from our cognitive battery to establish cut -offs according to a widely accepted practice for 
the diagnosis of dementia.  
 
Blood Sample . Blood samples will be collected for the RNA and telomerase analyses at 
screening (visits 1 -3) and [ADDRESS_853039] -randomization (or early termination). A sample of 
10ml of blood will be collected and it will be processed by [CONTACT_638040].  
 
Neuropsychological Assessments : Neuropsychological tests will be administered at 
screening (visits 1 -3), week 12 (visits 10 -11), and 6, 12, and 14 months (visits 14 -19) (See 
6.2 for descriptions of evaluations).  
 MRI Imaging Biomarkers:  Imaging data will be acquired from 110 subjects (55 per group) at 
baseline, at [ADDRESS_853040] -randomization (or for early termination), and at 12- months post -
randomization on a Siemens Prisma system using a 32- channel head coil. Each scanning session 
will last 60 minutes and include 1) a T1- weighted multi -echo MPRAGE (MEMPR) sequence with 
real time motion tracking and correction for the examination of brain structure; 2) a bandwidth 
matc hed T2- space sequence for detection and quantification of WMHs and CSF; and 3) three 
separate BOLD EPI [INVESTIGATOR_638011] - and task -related fMRI data used for the 
examination of emotional and working memory processing and functional connec tivity. In addition, 
a 3-plane localizer and a non- BOLD EPI [INVESTIGATOR_638012]- planar to the fMRI data for cross -modal 
image registration will be acquired. The morphometry sequences are optimized for determining 
brain tissue contrast with reduced distortion.113

Functional Imaging:  To address our hypotheses that TCC versus HEW will result in greater 
activation in right VLPFC and the amygdala during emotional processing (Hypothesis 2a) and greater working memory -related activation in the DLPFC and other network regions (Hypothesis 
2b) we will employ two widely -validated brain activation tasks that probe emotional processing 
and working memory function (see preliminary studies). Similarly, analysis of rs -fMRI data will

Task.  We will use a previously detailed Faces/Shapes brain activation task shown to produce robust 
and reliable activations in amygdala and PFC regions during emotion processing, making this 
paradigm particularly appropriate for longitudinal investigation .114,115,116 In brief, during this task 
participants are required to match emotions (activating the amygdala and VLPFC), label emotions 
(activating the VLPFC) or match forms (a control condition) while presented with faces showing 
different emotional expressions or geometric shapes [ Fig.1 ]. Since subjects are not asked to attend 
or regulate their affect, brain activation is more closely linked with affective reactivity, rather than with 
affect perception.[ADDRESS_853042] a letter that appeared 2 positions back. In the 
control 0- back condition, subjects will press a button every time the letter “X” appears on- screen. 
Button presses record accuracy and response time. This version of the n- back has been 
employed in our laboratory to show significant reductions in activation of the DLPFC and posterior 
parietal cortex across mood state in bipolar subjects compared to controls118 as well increased 
activation in association with clinical response in LLD (see preliminary studies). Resting State -
fMRI: During acquisition of BOLD rs -fMRI data, s ubjects will be asked to remain awake with their 
eyes closed. Though resting state connectivity is highly reproducible over time in healthy 
subjects119, experience -based neural plasticity in resting state connectivity has been shown to 
occur over periods as short as 2- [ADDRESS_853043].53,54 
Preprocessing and Analysis:  Preprocessing of all fMRI data  will follow similar workflows 
executed in the LONI pi[INVESTIGATOR_638013],  where standard and state- of-the-art image analysis 
programs interact seamlessly in a parallelized supercomputing environment. Specifically, preprocessing steps incorporating FSL ( www.fmrib.ox.ac .uk/fsl ) and custom processing modules, 
will include: a) removal of non- brain tissue; b) rigid- body head motion correction; c) spatial 
smoothing (5- 6 mm FWHM); d) denoising and high pass filtering using FSL’s MELODIC; and d) 
co-registration of the BOLD and T1 images using the matched bandwidt h EPI [INVESTIGATOR_638014]. First -level analysis will include the modeling of activation between task 
conditions (e.g. match emotion vs. shapes; or 0-back versus 2 -back) . Temporal derivatives and 
the [ADDRESS_853044] to improve statistical 
sensitivity. Second -level (fixed effects) and third- level (mixed effects) analyses will average runs 
within subjects and across groups respectively for subsequent comparisons between the treatment groups. Longitudinal analysis:  In addition to subtracting changes in activation between 
baseline and follow -up scans within individuals for subsequent group comparisons, we will 
represent fMRI maps as statistical change maps in time, with each voxel representing a s mooth 
change in magnitude (positive or negative) from the baseline dataset. These maps will be 
presented against the structural template, to determine the effects of structural change, functional 
change, and their interaction. One sample t -tests will deter mine if activation for each individual 
changes significantly over time. Task -related connectivity analysis : To investigate effective 
“functional” connectivity, we will perform a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis,[ADDRESS_853045] 
(ROIs). We will investigate the effect of the emotion- labeling task relative to the shape control, 
using voxels in the amygdala as “seeds” and voxels in the PFC as the “target.” Group -level FSL 
FEAT analyses will determine voxels throughout the brain showing significantly correlated task -

  02 APR  2020  dependent activity with the ROI. Regressors include the physiological variable (e.g., amygdala 
activity), the psychological variable (emotion vs. shape), and their interaction. Higher -level 
analyses will determine t he degree of functional coupling among treatment groups. Resting state 
analysis:  After applying preprocessing steps similar to those described above, widely documented 
independent components analysis (ICA),51,122 using FSL’s MELODIC, will estimate the optimal 
number of components for each subject and will remove components representing artifacts. After 
low pass filtering (0.1 -0.01 Hz) and transformation into atlas space, the best -fit DMN component 
for a subject will be selected for higher -level group analysis. We will explore components of other 
networks. We will also examine voxel correlation within particular networks in follow -up analyses 
of ROIs49,51,[ADDRESS_853046] co- investigators and include: 
1) volumetric analysis using automated and manual segmentation, 2) refined shape/surface structure analyses and 3) tensor based morphometry (TBM) analysis using Jacobian

will be used to visualize WMHs by [CONTACT_18120] a semi -automated WMH identifier.132 Briefly, WMH 
burden will be assessed based on the signal intensities of co- registered 3D MEMPR and T2-
SPACE images, and population statistics on the spatial distribution and neighborhood structure 
of WM lesions. With every unit increase in WM burden, we will estimate % reduction in local brain 
tissue volume. GLM and multiple regression analyses will determine links between WM burden 
and clinical measures in each group and may be controlled.

[NCCIH1]   All eligible subjects will be randomized 
to the TCC, or HEW control group using a computer -generated random assignment scheme, 
which assigns subjects in a 1:[ADDRESS_853049] will 
receive imaging or not.  Specifically, there will be four strata for randomization defined by [CONTACT_941] 2 x 
2 combinations of site (UCLA or MPTF), with approximately 60- 70% of the subjects being 
recruited at UCLA and the remainder at MPTF, and imaging (yes or no).   Within these strata, 
class sizes of 6 or 7 will be randomized to TCC or HEW. [NCCIH4]   Access to the data system, 
including the randomization progr am, is controlled via a hierarchical system of password 
protected logins, ensuring that study personnel can view only the parts of the system that are 
appropriate for their role. This helps to maintain blinding and ensure subject confidentiality. 
Careful s ecurity protocols will also be maintained prior to the entry of data into the online system. 
Specifically, paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_638015]. A shredder will be us ed to discard all unwanted study

groups that both incorporate “exercise and wellness education,” which we believe will generate 
equal  expectations for benefit. Both groups will be informed that they will receive exercise and

Database staff entering the data or managing the data will be blind to the treatment assignment. 
Groups in the documentation will be identified as 1 and 2. If unblinding occurs in the process of 
assessment, we will as sign different raters who will continue to be unaware of the treatment group, 
and will re -establish reliability on all assessment instruments. We will minimize potential “placebo 
effects” by [CONTACT_638043] “wellness and exercise”  interventions for 
depression. We will measure and compare the expectancy for the outcomes at baseline, Week 
12, Month 6 and Month 12 as specified below (or Month [ADDRESS_853053] passed). Both 
classes will be taught by [CONTACT_638044]. We will c ontrol for the “instructor” effect if several 
instructors teach classes.  
6.2.4  Follow -up Visits  
Follow -up Assessments : Assessments of efficacy and safety will take place approximately 
every [ADDRESS_853054] competi ng medical appointments some flexibility in scheduling will be allowed with the 
interval (+/ -) 1 full week of the expected week throughout the study.  
Similarly, longer assessments at months 3, 6, and 12 may be split into to 2 visits to accommodate 
clinical, neuropsychological, MRI and laboratory assessment (at 3 and 12 months). The MADRS, 
HAM -D, and GDS are to be obtained once between the baseline and screening visits, but re-
administered at baseline if the baseline visit occurred significantly after the sc reening visit for [ADDRESS_853055] to monitor worsening of depression, and 
the emergence of side- effects or suicidal ideations. All behavioral outcome assessments will be 
identical in both groups and performed by [CONTACT_638045] 
(Table 2) . 
6.2.5  Completion/Final Evaluation (will be scheduled within a window of +/ - 1 
week in regards to the week of the final class)  
The follow -up visits at 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_853056] 1.5 -3 hours for outcome measures.  
Visit 10 -11 at week 12: A physical, psychiatric examination, and a follow -up blood draw and MRI 
for peripheral biomarker analysis will be repeated.  
Visit 14 -17 at 6 and 12 months - will reassess primary and secondary outcomes and the 
remission/relapse status.  
Remission at 12 weeks / 6 and 12 /24 month follow -up: Subjects who achieve remission by 
[CONTACT_5875] [ADDRESS_853057] relapse of major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. The goal of 
continuation treatment is to ensure stability of response/remission, and to optimize copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
cognition, physical functioning and life satisfaction. We will explore the predictors and biomarkers of relapse for future studies. We will continue to monitor safety monthly by [CONTACT_412847] -person 
at [ADDRESS_853058] established guidelines for discontinuation from the study in the proposed protocol listed 
above. All severe s ide-effects will be reported to the UCLA IRB/Human Subjects Protection 
Committee within [ADDRESS_853059] item of the Hamilton Depression Scale during each visit 
to the site. Monitoring for SI will be done at each visit independent of the outcome assessment. The b lind rater will be instructed to inform the PI [INVESTIGATOR_638016] ≥ 3. Drs. Lavretsky and Wu will be 
available for “on call” consultations to address concerns of worsening of suicidal ideations. They will also participate in the review of the dropouts due to suicid al ideations and other causes during 
DSMP meetings. Subjects with active suicidal ideations with or without a plan, HAMD -24 (3) score 
≥ 3, will be excluded from participation. In the presence of persistent suicidal ideations, subjects will be discontinued from the study and referred to clinical services or to the community for 
treatment.  
7.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety 
Parameters 
 
Safety Evaluations:  Safety will be assessed at each visit. All subjects will receive an initial medical 
evaluation including a complete physical examination with neurological and neuropsychiatric 
examinations, electrocardiogram (ECG) (for potential cardiac complaints), and laboratory testing to rule out new -onset medical illnesses that could ac count for behavioral and cognitive symptoms. 
All abnormal physical or laboratory findings will be reported to subjects’ primary physicians with 
subject’s consent. If abnormal physical or laboratory results are considered responsible for 
depression, the sub ject will be excluded from participation.  All subjects will be interviewed about 
their recent history of psychiatric and medical illnesses, psychosocial stressors, current 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_853060] Rating Scale,137 a 
comprehensive rating scale for monitoring adverse events in clinical trials, will also be completed 
at all follow -up visits.  
7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE)  is defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during the 
study, having been absent at baseline, or if present at screening/ baseline, appears to worsen. 
Adverse events are to be recording regardless of their relationship to the study intervention.   
NOTE: Changes in the primary and secondary outcome measures (e.g. depression) will not be considered side- effects but will be monito red as outcome variables.  
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is generally defined as any untoward medical occurrence that 
results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly.  
All severe adverse events will be reported to the subjects and to their primary physicians and the UCLA IRB/ DSMB committee within one week of PI’s awareness, and within two 
weeks to the N IH.  
 If a patient demonstrates worsening of their depressive symptoms by [CONTACT_5875] 12 (i.e., CGI -

committee agree to keep all information confidential. Those members of the investigative group 
that are involved with the treatment and assessment of patients within the study will not review 
data that involve the comparison of outcomes (i. e., adverse events, treatment response, 
remission, etc.).  
 The Board will also issue a report annually to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_72616]. The board will review summaries 
of the study progress to ensure that consent documentation is properly obtained and stored. They 
will also review progress in filling subject recruitment ethnic requirements. They will also 
determine whether study coordinators and investigators are collecting and organizing data 
properly.  Key personnel will provide progress reports to facilitate this review. The board will also 
review any recent research relevant to the study. The summary reports will provide data on 
enrollment and adverse events. Adverse events will be monitored using the UCLA Adverse Event 
and/or Incident Reporting forms (Forms HS -5 & HS -6). Additional support for these activities will 
be provided by [CONTACT_638046], which appointed Associate Dean,

administered through the CTSI. A committee consisting of at least four medical school faculty 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_853065] will be withdrawn from the interventions but followed naturalistically for 12 months. Subjects will be informed about 
an option of pursuing clinical care in th e community.  
 
Subjects who do not improve or get worse  during acute intervention phase or relapse during 
the continuation phase will be offered treatment outside the protocol in the Geriatric Psychiatry 
Clinics, or other community clinics. They will also be invited to come for the 6 and 12 month follow -
up to determine their progress and the patterns of response to treatment while controlling for any 
changes in treatment.  
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Statistical Analysis Plan.  To clarify, for our primary analysis of assessing treatment effects, the 
GLMM model  proposed will not include treatment adherence or time in practice. Once treatment 
effects are interpreted from our primary analysis, as a secondary analysis we will include these variables (i.e., treatment adherence or time in practice) as well as their i nteractions with treatment 
into the model, to assess whether the confirmed treatment effects depend on (or vary as a function of) time in practice. In addition this dependence is allowed to vary between treatment groups. This 
is equivalent to correlating a continuous time in practice measure with the treatment effects within 
each group. Hence, this secondary analysis will lead to a separate interpretation than our primary 
analysis assessing treatment effects.   
9.[ADDRESS_853066] section.  
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
Power and sample size estimate:  We assume that dropout will be at 10% and 20% at the end 
of 12 week treatment phase and 6 and 12 month follow -up, respectively. For Aim 1,  if the 
treatment main effects  are linear over the 12 week treatment phase on HAMD, our design with 7 
time points (baseline, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 weeks) and with complete data on 99 subjects within each 
arm (10% dropout) will have 80% power at significance level α=0.05 for detecting a treatment and 
time interaction corresponding to no difference at baseline and a difference of d = 0.[ADDRESS_853067] Guidelines and Considerations  29 of 47 Version 7.4 
  02 APR  2020  12 month follow -up, our design with complete data on 88 subjects within each arm (20% dropout) 
will have 80% power at significance level α=0.05 for detecting a group difference between any 
two arms of d =  0.[ADDRESS_853068] and/or AIC (Akaike Infor mation Criterion). If we find either 
significant interactions or main effects, follow -up contrasts will be used to determine at which time 
points there has been significant change and/or differences in treatment effects relative to baseline.  
 For Aim [ADDRESS_853069] 80% power at significance level 
α=0.05 for detecting a group difference between any two arms of d =  0.[ADDRESS_853070] sizes of d = 
0.57 for changes in BOLD response in bilateral occipi[INVESTIGATOR_638017] (faces affective 
reactivity task), in BOLD response in left  DLPFC, premotor and bilateral posterior parietal regions 
(N-Back task) between baseline and end of treatment at [ADDRESS_853071] g roup differences in imaging biomarkers.  
9.3  Definition of Populations  
Study population includes older adults (age 60 y.o. and older) with the current diagnosis of major 
depression without dementia who have been on stable treatment for at least  [ADDRESS_853072] moderate – severe depressive symptoms. ITT analyses will be on all the subjects who were 
randomized and who had baseline assessments. Per protocol population will be the subset of the ITT subjects who attended at least 80% of the sessions an d who had no major protocol violations

9.5 Outcomes  
Measures and Outcomes:  All instruments provide a comprehensive assessment of the severity 
of depression, health related quality of life, medical comorbi dity, cognitive and functional 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  30 of 47 Version 7.4 
  02 APR  2020  impairment, life satisfaction and quality of life and will enable the PI [INVESTIGATOR_638019]. Diagnosis will be determined on study entry. All outcome measures 
will be administered at basel ine, week 12, 6 months, and 12 months or upon early termination.  
Mood, anxiety, and safety measures will be administered at all visi ts.  
 
9.5.1  Primary Outcome   
Primary outcomes  include measures of depressive symptom severity. Primary outcomes will 
be measured and defined as follows:  1) continuous outcome of change in HAMD scores;  
9.5.[ADDRESS_853074] emotional and functional improvement linked with TCC compared to the 
control condition    
Exploratory outcomes and biomarkers  – multimodal MRI analyses, changes in gene 
expression and peripheral pro- inflammatory cytokines associated with clinical res ponse to the 
interventions.   
 
9.6 Data Analyses  
Statistical Analysis Plan.   
The study will include 220 subjects assigned to TCC/HEW in a 1:1 ratio, within each treatment 
arm. Prior to performing the primary analyses, descriptive statistics and graphical summaries will 
be obtained for the primary outcomes (HAMD -24 (Aim 1), connectivity in DMN in rs -fMRI and 
BOLD activation during the mood task in the anterior cingulate (Aim 2)) to check for outliers and 
violations of model assumptions and to assess the need for transformations or non- parametric 
methods. We will also plot each of the primary measures as a function of time to examine the form of the longitudinal trajectories. ( HAMD -24 scores will be recorded every 2 weeks throughout 
the intervention.) Longitu dinal analysis proposed will rely on generalized linear mixed models 
(GLMMs). GLMMs properly account for correlations induced by [CONTACT_638048], allow for both fixed and time -varying covariates and automatically handle missing data, 
producing unbiased estimates as long as observations are missing at random. This allows the 
use of all available data from all subjects, thereby [CONTACT_298630] -up. To 
make the most efficient use of our data we will fit a single mo del using all time points for each 
outcome.  Our specific aims and hypotheses correspond to specific contrasts within those models.  
Demographic variables (e.g., age, gender, etc.) and variables characterizing the course of 
depressive symptoms (e.g., age of  onset, chronicity, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], length of the current 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], etc.) will be compared by [CONTACT_638049]; 
this would define one possible set of appropriate covariates, if needed.  
 
Aim 1 : Primary analysi s: Our primary analysis will consist of a GLMM for HAMD -[ADDRESS_853075] Guidelines and Considerations  31 of 47 Version 7.4 
  02 APR  2020  for subjects who dropped out will differ from those for subjects who did not. These differences will 
be allowed to be vary across treatment arms and the amount of difference will be varied in a 
plausible range to obtain a full sensitivity analysis.  
 
Secondary analysis:  Treatment maintenance will be assessed via the GLMM at follow -up as 
part of the secondary analysis. Secondary analysis will also include comparison of remission 
status (binary outcome) at t he end of treatment between treatment groups via a logistic 
regression. Analyses for secondary outcomes clinical global improvement (CGI) and cognitive 
domain scores in the executive function and memory domains will be similar to those above for the contin uous HAMD scores.  As noted in the Neuropsychological Assessment section, there are 
[ADDRESS_853076] two aims.  
 
Aim 2. Hypothesis 2a, b:  Primary analysis:  Similar to Aim 1, the primary outcomes of DMN 
connectivity in rs- fMRI and BOLD activation during the mood task in the anterior cingulate will be 
modeled with a GLMM model with treatment group and time as main effects, along with their two-
way interaction. Significant interactions would suggest differential trajectories over time for activation and connectivity outcomes in the two treatment groups. Primary analysis will assess 
treatment ef fects at [ADDRESS_853077].  
 
Secondary analysis:  Secondary measures for Aim 2 will be BOLD activation during the cognitive 
task in hippocampus. Secondary analysis will include assessment of treatment maintenance effects on the primary and secondary outcomes and of treatment effects during treatment in the secondary outcome of BOLD activation during the cognitive task in hippocampus.  
 
Exploratory Hypothesis 2c:  Exploratory analysis:  Exploratory variables will include 
hippocampal and anterior cingulate volume and white matter high intensity. To test hypotheses about the relationships between the imaging metrics and the primary outcomes in mood and 
cognition, we will derive domain summary scores for the [ADDRESS_853078] size on the outcome in the presence of the mediator.   
 
Exploratory aim 1:  We will explore the difference in changes in gene expression and peripheral 
pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with clinical response to the interventions, by [CONTACT_638050].

Data management : Data management and statistical support for this project, other than storage 
and processing of raw imaging files, will be provided by [CONTACT_214035], the biostatistics core in UCLA’s 
Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, (project co- investigator, [CONTACT_638058]). [CONTACT_638059] will collaborate with [CONTACT_638058] on data analysis. SIStat staff will construct a secure customized web- based data collection and management system for this  study incorporating the 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_853080] data entry and electronic upload of summary files. The fMRI data will 
be stored in the computing cluster in the UCL A Brain Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_547344] (see Facilities) and 
processed by [CONTACT_638052]/ Lavretsky labs, who have specific expertise in the study 
paradigms; the resulting derived measures will be uploaded to the centralized database. Moreover, access to the data syst em, including the randomization program, is controlled via a 
hierarchical system of password protected logins, ensuring that study personnel can view only the parts of the system that are appropriate for their role. This helps to maintain blinding and ensure subject confidentiality. Careful security protocols will also be maintained prior to the entry 
of data into the online system. Specifically, paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_638020]. A shredder will be used 
to discard all unwanted study documents.   
10.3 Quality Assurance  
10.3.1a.  Training in assessments  
SOP: Clinical Assessments.  All behavioral outcome assessments will be identical in all groups 
and performed by [CONTACT_638053]. Inter-rater reliability for  all 
instruments will be established at the beginning of the trial. All research associates will be trained 
by [CONTACT_978], [CONTACT_547431], and [CONTACT_638060] on administration of all clinical study assessment including 
DSM -5R SCID interview. Inter -rater reliability will be established on all assessment instruments 
on the first [ADDRESS_853081]. Ercoli’s supervision. The psychometrist will be observed in testing and scoring, and the work product will be reviewed. Each psychometrist is given feedback on areas of strengths and 
weaknesses, and a final overall rating as to readiness to start testing subjects.  
10.3.1b. Training in administering interventions.  
SOP:  
Health and wellness education (HEW ). [CONTACT_547431] and trained study staff at both sites will 
implement HEW using a manual that will present educational information and describe learni ng 
objectives and patient activities to promote integration of material. The detailed protocol for Health Education has been developed and used in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080]. The HEW  sessions will be held once 
a week for [ADDRESS_853082] -discussion self -
help quizzes to assess patient learning.  
 SOP: [CONTACT_547431] will provide weekly supervision for health education instructors to monitor 
consistency and adherence to the educational protocol.  
Fidelity of Training : Our group will take the following steps to facilitate and ensure the fidelity of 
training. For the HEW condition, the co- investigator ([CONTACT_547431]) meets with  staff to learn the HEW 
training manual. During this meeting, the group will go over the material. Standard background 
readings are assigned to trainers on each topic in the training manual. Standard Readings on weekly HEW topi[INVESTIGATOR_638021]. Trainers receive education on other 
factors important to instilling belief in the effectiveness of the HEW training in subjects, including:  
o How to develop rapport  
o Using an effective presentation style (speech rate, volume, eye contact, how to 
facilitate subject participation in the groups)  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  34 of 47 Version 7.4 
  02 APR  2020  o Addressing subjects’ expectations for benefit —educating subjects so that they 
develop realistic expectations about how HEW condition can be beneficial.  
Adherence and Quality control:  After the training meetin g, [CONTACT_547431] will implement quality 
control assessment to determine each trainers’ readiness for implementation of HEW. This will 
include mock presentations of the material on which trainers present to each other, and [CONTACT_547431], 
and are then rated (pass,  needs improvement, and comments) on several dimensions including 
the material in the manual as well as the quality of presentation style. Presenters are given 
positive feedback and constructive criticism on their presentation. If trainers do not meet the ‘pass’ 
standard, will be given more time to practice and learn the material and will be re- reviewed.  
Finally, trainers will receive weekly supervision by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lavretsky used to monitor trainers’ 
adherence to the intervention and protocol.  
Tai Chi Chih.  The Tai Chi Chih instructors will follow the same manual for this interventions. All 
instructors have been trained and certified by [CONTACT_638054].  We will contact [CONTACT_638055]’s adherence to the manual protocol.  
10.3.2  Quality Control Committee  
Quality control will be conducted by [CONTACT_180096] (DSMC) (see Monitoring 10.3.5).   
10.3.[ADDRESS_853083] data, and accrual 
report will be sent to the PI. Data entry will be facilitated by 1) having visual screen formats similar 
to the actual forms; 2) having range boundaries on each field, where appropriate, to be checked 
automatically as data is entered; 3) having default values incorporated into the data entry system to minimize typi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
10.3.4  Protocol Deviations  
Protocol deviations will be captured, docume nted, and reviewed using the Concomitant 
Medications / Interventions Form, and [LOCATION_006]U Side- effect scale, as well as any deviation from the 
protocol  
10.3.[ADDRESS_853084] or incomplete data, range check and accrual report will be sent to the PI. Data entry will be facilitated by 1) having visual s creen formats similar to the actual forms; 2) having range 
boundaries on each field, where appropriate, to be checked automatically as data is entered; 3) 
having default values incorporated into the data entry system to minimize typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. To ensure the 
accur acy of data entry, we will apply double- entry of each data point into the database. [CONTACT_638059] will provide additional assistance with monthly monitoring of the out of range data entry.  
 In order to minimize missing data during the study, research assistants will be present to answer subjects’ questions and to double check all self -reported questionnaires, making sure that all 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_853085] of generalized linear 
mixed models (GLMMs) that are valid under the assumption of missing- at-random. To study 
missingness patterns, we will compare mean response trajectories of the primary outcome 
measure HAMD for subjects who dropped out and those who did not. We will further compare 
treatment groups for drop -out rates, time to drop- out and drop -out reasons. Since it is theoretically 
impossible to rule out data missing- not-at-random, we will also perform sensitivity analysis taking 
a patte rn mixture approach. Our pattern mixture approach will make assumptions on how the 
outcome trajectory for subjects who dropped out will differ from those for subjects who did not. These differences will be allowed to be vary across treatment arms and the amount of difference 
will be varied in a plausible range to obtain a full sensitivity analysis.

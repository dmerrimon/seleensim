2. Background  
 
At NewYork -Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307] -Weill Cornell Medicine, we have a robust Renal Transplant 
Program, including renal transplantation in HIV+ patients. The Renal Transplant Program works in 
close collaboration with the Transplant/Oncology Infectious Diseases Program, i ncluding clinical 
research trials. There have been 42 renal transplants performed in HIV+ patients at our institution in 
the past 10 years, including two HIV to HIV renal transplants. Thirty -seven patients (excluding HIV to 
HIV renal transplants) remain al ive and are eligible for study consideration. Only four are receiving 
TAF-containing regimens; the remaining 33 are on various antiretroviral (ARV) regimens including 
protease inhibitors, cobicistat and ritonavir (started by [CONTACT_63446]), which increase drug -drug interactions with tacrolimus and jeopardize the 
kidney transplant, as well as increasing pi[INVESTIGATOR_13551]. Therefore, a new single tablet ARV with less 
Protocol Small -ISR-US-19-[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date 03/15/202 3, Version 5.0  
6 
 drug -drug interactions is important to this unique population. Data from 4 clinical trials (1 -5) show 
that the single tablet regimen containing BIC/F/TAF (Bictegravir/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
Alafenamide) is safe and efficacious and non -inferior to other standard ARV regimens. No patients 
had to discontinue  the drug due to renal events and no patients developed treatment -emergent 
resistance. BIC had no impact on severe renal impairment (eGFRCG 15 -29 mL/min), no effect on 
actual GFR (iohexol clearance) and minimal effect on estimated GFR. There were no 
discon tinuations due to adverse renal events and no proximal renal tubulopathy. TAF is a novel 
tenofovir prodrug (6,7) with improved renal and bone safety compared to Tenofovir. As reported in 
JAIDS 2016 (5), switching HIV -positive patients with mild to moderate  renal impairment from a prior 
TDF-based regimen to Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/TAF (E/C/F/TAF) resulted in significant 
decreases in proteinuria, albuminuria and  tubular proteinuria without dose adjustment.  
 
Kidney transplantation is successful i n HIV+ patients although rejection rates are higher than in 
non-HIV+ transplant patients (8). The greatest clinical challenge is to achieve therapeutic and 
nontoxic levels of the immunosuppressive drugs, especially Tacrolimus, in this population, due to 
the complicated pharmacokinetic interactions of these agents with antiretroviral agents (ARV), 
especially protease inhibitors, cobicistat, and ritonavir (8). Non -therapeutic exposure to tacrolimus 
contributes to higher rate of rejection, so it is important t o study ARV agents with less drug -drug 
interactions that are safe in this special population. We are currently completing a manuscript 
addressing this issue at our institution and the kidney transplant team has presented preliminary 
data in a poster at the  American Transplant Congress in 2018 (Al Jurdi, Clinical Outcomes of HIV -
Infected Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_63428]). It is 
important to closely follow the CD4 lymphocyte counts and percentages in this unique po pulation 
and the effect on HIV infection and immunosuppression. Preferred ARV regimens in HIV+ patients 
post renal transplant include integrase inhibitors and TAF, with the goal to avoid protease inhibitors, 
ritonavir and cobicistat and decrease drug -drug interactions with tacrolimus (8,9).  
 
In treatment naïve adults with HIV -1 infection, switching from DTG, abacavir, and lamivudine to 
BIC/F/TAF proved to be a safe and efficacious option for the treatment of HIV -1 infection (1). The 
pharmacokinetics of BIC/F/TAF were assessed in this study, an d the mean trough concentrations of 
BIC were 14 times higher than the protein -adjusted 95% effective concentration against wild type 
HIV-1 virus.  
 
There is no current data about the pharmacokinetics of BIC/F/TAF in renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_63429]/F/TAF with tacrolimus. Previous work has demonstrated sustained, zero -
order, linear, release pharmacokinetic characteristics of TAF (10,11). TAF is metabolized via CES1 in 
hepatocytes, cathepsin A in PBMCs, and minimally with CYP3A.  Tenofovi r plasma levels significantly 
increase when administered to subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment, such that  the 
dosing interval is adjusted in patients with baseline creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min based on 
modeling of single -dose pharmac okinetic data in non -HIV and non -HBV infected subjects with 
varying degrees of renal impairment (12).  
 
TAF is hydrolyzed within cells to form tenofovir (major metabolite), which is phosphorylated to 
the active metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate. In vitro studies have shown that TAF is metabolized to 
tenofovir by [CONTACT_63447]1 in hepatocytes, and by [CONTACT_13683] A in PBMCs and macrophages. Whether 
tenofovir can accumulate and lead to nephrotoxicity in conjunction with tacrolimus after tenofovir

 alafenamide administratio n is not known. Moreover, the long -term renal safety of tenofovir 
alafenamide in HIV+ renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_63430].  
 
Dried blood spots have been used to determine markers of recent dosing and measures of anti -
retroviral adh erence (13,14). Comparison of tenofovir and FTC in dried blood spot versus plasma 
indicated that dried blood spot can be used as a plasma alternative for pharmacokinetic analyses in 
vivo (15). Measurement of intracellular TAF levels has not been done in th e HIV+ renal transplant 
population. We will therefore incorporate the dried blood spot method and PBMC method to 
determine intracellular TAF levels and monitor adherence in the renal transplant population.  
 
We therefore will determine concentrations of BIC, FTC, and TAF in serial samples of plasma and 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells over the course of 48 weeks in HIV+ renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 
(Section 6.1 ). 
 
Preservation of renal function and graft survival is of primary importanc e in this HIV -infected 
renal transplant population, challenged by [CONTACT_9934] -drug interactions between ARV regimens and anti -
rejection medications. In the 112 study (5), switching to E/C/F/TAF had no change in estimated or 
actual GFR and proteinuria, proximal re nal tubular function, and BMD significantly improved over 48 
weeks. In patients with eGFR <50 mL/min, adverse events were similar in grade and frequency to 
patients with GFR>50 mL/min.  BIC/F/TAF has demonstrated high rates of virologic suppression and 
no treatment -emergent resistance through 48 weeks in phase 3 clinical trials among treatment 
naïve adults and among virologically suppressed adult patients who switched ARV regimens. 
Therefore, BIC/F/TAF promises to be an important ARV regimen to be studied in  HIV+ post renal 
transplant patients, including drug -drug interactions with anti -rejection agents, especially 
tacrolimus. Pharmacokinetic studies, and drug -drug interactions are important to study in this 
unique population, as well as the efficacy, safety and tolerability of BIC/F/TAF.  
 
In this single arm, open -label, switch study, we propose to switch virally suppressed HIV+ adults 
post -renal transplant to BIC/F/TAF and follow the subjects for 48 weeks to evaluate the efficacy, 
safety and tolerability of B IC/F/TAF , plus a 6 month follow -up. Health related quality of life 
outcomes are important in the evaluation of ARV treatment strategies, especially in the HIV+ renal 
transplant population.  BIC/F/TAF and DTG -based regimens have been compared in treatment -naïve 
and HIV -1 suppressed adults, showing non -inferior efficacy and less drug -related adverse events in 
BIC/F/TAF arms compared to DTG -based regimens. To better understand the patients’ experience 
with BIC/F/TAF post renal transplant, we will be using a spe cific quality of life questionnaire 
(Attachment 1). We hypothesize that BIC/F/TAF will be an important addition to the management of 
HIV+ post renal transplant patients, especially since it is a one pi[INVESTIGATOR_63431], thereby

5%, all grades) are diarrhea, nausea, and headache. Other potential warnings and 
precautions include the immune reconstitution syndrome, new onset or worsening 
renal impairment, and lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly w ith steatosis.

2.1.2 Known Potential Benefits   
 
BIC/F/TAF has demonstrated high rates of virologic suppression and no treatment -
emergent resistance through 48 weeks in phase 3 clinical trials among treatment naïve 
adults and among virologically suppressed  adult patients who switched ARV regimens. 
BIC/F/TAF also has lower pi[INVESTIGATOR_63433] -retroviral regimens, due to a one -
pi[INVESTIGATOR_63434].  
 
 
3. Study Design  
 
3.1 Overall Design  
 
We hypothesize that BIC/F/TAF will be efficacious and safe in the management of HIV+ post renal 
transplant patients, and will have few adverse reactions and drug -drug interactions with tacrolimus 
in this population.  
 
Eighteen  subjects  will be enrolled in this Phase I V, single arm, open -label, single -site, switch study . In 
this study, virally suppressed HIV+ adults  will be switched post -renal transplant from their current 
anti-retroviral regimen to BIC/F/TAF and  will be  follow ed for 48 weeks with a 6 month follow -up 
(Section 6.1 ). Informed consent will be obtained before starting the study ( Section 6.1 ). 
 
Patients will have bloodwork completed throughout the study, as shown in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Section 6.1).  
 
A health -related quality of life questionnaire ( Appendix ) will be administered to each patient to 
assess satisfaction with a one pi[INVESTIGATOR_63435] ( Section 6.1 ).  
 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies will be assessed at Week 12  when the renal function is stable (decided 
by [CONTACT_976]). Intracellular TAF levels by [CONTACT_63449] [ADDRESS_68435]. Peter Ande rson at the University 
of Colorado's Antiviral Laboratory. (14 -16) 
 
Note: Patients switched post -renal transplant from their current anti -retroviral regimen to 
BIC/F/TAF  prior to identification for this study may also be enrolled. This group will be referr ed to as 
“Group 2”. P harmacokinetic testing for Group [ADDRESS_68436]'s tacrolimus levels are stable as per the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_8178] 2-[ADDRESS_68437] of 
care lab values and concomitant medications will be collected from Group 2 subjects for 60 days 
prior to and after the Biktarvy switch date  and for the duration of Biktarvy therapy . Any adverse 
events related to Biktarvy prior to enrollment will be recorded.  
 
Sample Collection  
Samples include plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Blood is collected in EDTA 
tubes for plasma separation. CPT vacutainers are used to isolate PBMC, which are counted with an 
Protocol Small -ISR-US-19-[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date 03/15/202 3, Version 5.0

 automated countess cytome ter (InvitrogenTM, Thermo Fisher Scientific Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) 
and lysed.  BIK, F, and TAF in plasma are assayed using a validated LC/MS/MS methodology with a 
lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 10 ng/mL (16).  
 
Determination of Pharmacokinetic V ariables  
The pharmacokinetic variables for BIC/F/TAF are calculated from the concentration -time data using 
noncompartmental methods. The peak drug concentration (Cmax) and time of peak drug 
concentration are obtained directly from the observed data. The te rminal elimination rate constant 
(kel) is obtained from a log -linear regression of the plasma concentration compared to time data in 
the terminal post distribution phase. The elimination half -life (t1/2) is calculated from 0.693/kel. The 
area under the pla sma drug concentration -versus -time curve (AUC0 –24) and the area under the 
moment curve from 0 to 24 h (AUMC0 –24) are calculated by [CONTACT_63450] -linear trapezoidal rule. The area 
under the plasma drug concentration -versus -time curve from time zero to time infini ty (AUC0 –
) is 
obtained from the following equation: AUC0 –24 • Ct/kel, where Ct is the last measurable 
concentration and kel is the terminal elimination rate constant. The total body clearance (CL) is 
obtained from the equations dose/AUC0 –
 and dose/AUC0 –24 (presumed steady state, where 24 h 
is the dosing interval), respectively. The volume of distribution (Vd) is calculated as follows: Vd= 
CL/kel. The steady -state volume of distribution (Vss) is calculated from the product of CL and the 
mean residence time . The mean residence time is obtained from the following equation: (AUMC0 –
/AUC0 –
) T/2, where AUMC0 –
 is extrapolated from [(Ct x t)/kel x Ct/kel2] and where T is the 
infusion time, all other terms having been previously defined.  
 
Statistical Analyses and  Sample Size  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_63436], safety, and pharmacokinetics of BIC/F/TAF in HIV+ renal 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Sample size is based upon feasibility of enrolling the current cohort of patients 
on the WCM/NYPH renal transplant service wh o are currently rec eiving antiretroviral therapy. 
Among the 37 HIV+ renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_63437], we project that [ADDRESS_68438] antiretroviral regimen to a BIC/ F/TAF 
regimen, there would be high probability of a sustained suppression of HIV - RNA (1). In the 
randomi zed, double -blind, multicent er, active -controlled, phase 3, non -inferiority clinical trial of 
switching to fixed -dose bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide from dolutegravir plus 
abacavir and lamivudine in virologically suppressed adults wi th HIV -1 by [CONTACT_63451], the primary 
endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV -1 RNA of 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_63438] 48 that fulfilled the prespecified non -inferiority margin of 4%, where three (1%) of 282 in the 
bictegravir group had HIV -1 RNA of 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_63439] 48 versus one (<1%) of 281 
participants in the dolutegravir group (difference 0·7%, 95·002% CI -1·0 to 2·8; p=0·62).  
 
The number of [ADDRESS_68439] data for pharmacokinetic studies to yield a coefficient of variation of <15%, which 
will permit a robust analysis and model development.   
 
Outcome variables and adverse events will be reported using descriptive statist ics, including means, 
medians, ranges, and standard errors.  
 
The relationship between renal function, tacrolimus levels, BIC/F/TAF plasma concentrations, and 
intracellular concentrations of TAF will be determined by [CONTACT_63452].

that is fully supported by [CONTACT_57421] -Cornell Medical Center CTSC.  It is a tool for the 
creation of customized, secure data management systems that include Web -based data -
entry forms, reporting tools, and a full array of security features including user and 
group based privileges, authentication using institution LDAP system, with a full audit 
trail of data manipulation and export procedures.  REDCap is maintained on CTSC -owned 
servers that are backed up nightly and support encrypted (SSL -based) connections.  
Nationally, the software is developed, enhanced and supported through a multi -
institutional consortium led by [CONTACT_57422].  
 
9. Regulatory Considerations  
 
9.[ADDRESS_68453]/Ethics Committee Approval  
 
As required by [CONTACT_427], the Investigator will ensure all legal aspects are covered, and 
approval of the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained, before study initiation.  
Before initiation of the study , the protocol, the ICF, other written materia l given to the patient s, 
and any other relevant study documentation will be submitted to the appropriate Ethics 
Committee. Written approval of the study and all relevant study information must be obtained 
before the study center can be initiated or the IP is released to the Investigator. Any necessa ry 
extensions or renewals of IRB approval must be obtained for changes to the study, such as 
amendments to the protocol, the ICF, or other study documentation. The written approval of the  
IRB together with the ap proved ICF must be filed in the study files.  
The Investigator will report promptly to the IRB any new information that may adversely affect 
the safety of the patients or the conduct of the study. The Investigator will submit written 
summaries  of the study  status to the IRB as required. On completion of the study, the IRB will be

responsible for determining whether the trial and its results are sub ject to the requirements for 
submission to http://www.clinicaltrials.gov . Information posted will allow subjects to identify 
potentially appropriate trials for their disease conditions and pursue participation by [CONTACT_3379] a 
central contact [CONTACT_63455].

Protocol Small -ISR-US-19-[ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date 03/15/[ADDRESS_68458] 2 years since the discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. In 
addition, all subjects  medical records and other source documentation will be kept for the 
maximum time permitted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307], in stitution, or medical practice.   
 
10. Statistical Considerations  
 
10.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
We hypothesize that in the transition from a standard antiretroviral regimen to a BIC/ F/TAF 
regimen, there would be high probability of a sustained suppression of HIV - RNA (1). In the 
randomized, double -blind, multicente r, active -controlled, phase 3, non -inferiority clinical trial of 
switching to fixed -dose bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide from dolutegravir plus 
abacavir and lamivudine in virologically suppressed adults with HIV -1 by [CONTACT_63451], the primary 
endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV -1 RNA of 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_63438] 48 fulfilled the prespecified non -inferiority margin of 4%, where three (1%) of 282 in the 
bictegravir group had HIV -1 RNA of 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_63439] 48 versus one (<1%) of 281 
participants in the dolutegravir group (difference 0·7%, 95·002% CI -1·0 to 2·8; p=0·62).  
 
The number of [ADDRESS_68459] data for 
pharmacokinetic studies to yield a coefficient of variation of <15%, which will permit a robust 
analysis and model development. Outcome variables and adverse events will be reported using 
descriptive statistics, including means, medians, ranges, and standard errors. The relationship 
between renal function, tacrolimus levels, BIC/F/TAF plasma concentrations, and intracellular  
concentrations of TAF will be determined by [CONTACT_63456] s.  
 
Expected Outcomes:   
1. We expect sustained suppression of the HIV viral load throughout the study.  
2. We expect that BIC/F/TAF will be well tolerated in the HIV+ renal transplant population with  
minimal adverse events and preservation of renal function with stable tacrolimus levels.  
3. Plasma concentrations of BIC/F/TAF will follow those reported in HIV+ non-renal transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_63441]/drug interactions with tacrolimus will be minimal, allowing easy adjustment 
with minimal detrimental effects on renal function.  
 
 
11. Adverse Events  
 
11.1 Adverse Event Definition  
 
An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a drug, and does not imply any judgment about causalit y. An adverse 
event can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another 
drug) and with any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.

and all serious adverse events , irrespective of association with the Study Drug(s) in the 
course of the Clinical Trial, within 3 business days of such report or correspondence 
being sent to the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities.   
  
11.6  AE/SAE Follow Up  
 
All SAEs and AEs r eported during this study will be followed until resolution or until the 
investigator confirms that the AE/SAE has stabilized and no more follow -up is required. This 
requirement indicates that follow -up may be required for some events after the subject  
discontinues participation from the study.  
 
12. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
The WCM DSMB will be used for this investigator -initiated study. The following information will be 
submitted to the WCM DSMB every [ADDRESS_68462] enro llment:

 • BUN, creatinine: From Days 3 through Day 22, and if needed at additional time points, as per 
investigator  
• Tacrolimus levels: All time points  
• Any HIV -resistance testing needed, as per investigator  
1 Clinical Safety Labs include: CBC, complete metabolic panel, urinalysis, eGFR 
 
Adverse Events and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_63444]:  
1. Severe drug reaction,  including rash or fever (as determined by [CONTACT_978])  
2. Inability to control tacrolimus levels, as defined by [CONTACT_63457], which 
may lead to renal graft failure  
3. ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_68463]  
4. Virologic failure, as determined by [CONTACT_63458], which would be defined as: On -
treatment HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL twice sequentially, separated by 4 -6 weeks  
5. Development of documented resistance to BIC/FTC/TAF  
 
Renal dysfunction requiring evaluation is defined as a decrease in creatinine clearan ce to CrCl < 30 
mL/min. The evaluation of renal dysfunction will be completed by [CONTACT_63459], in 
conjunction with the PI.  
 
If the CrCl is below 30 mL/min, the BIC/F/TAF will be held and an evaluation will be performed by [CONTACT_63460]. The evaluation of the cause will be 
explored by [CONTACT_63461]. The patient will be 
discontinued from the study at the discretion of the PI, after dis cussion with the primary renal 
transplant physician, if deemed necessary.  
 
WCM IRB policies will be followed for this study, including the Immediate Report Policy. Any SAEs will be 
reported to the IRB following these policies, and will also be reported to the funding source ([COMPANY_009] 
Sciences, Inc.) within 3 business days of the study team learning of the SAE. The WCM DSMB 
comments/review will be submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review and submitted to the 
funding source ([COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc.) at the time of each WCM DSMB completion.

1. Introduction:  
 
Intracerebral  hemorrhage  (ICH)  is the most common subtype of hemorrhagic stroke, accounting for 10-15% of all  
strokes and affecting  between  [ADDRESS_571817] prognosis of all stroke subtypes5. The estimated  mortality  rate is 50% at 
1 year  and more  than 70% at [ADDRESS_571818] for patients  experiencing  mortality  from  their initial hemorrhage was greater  than 16,500 US dollars (patients 
admitted  between  1999 and 2002). These costs  were  much  greater  in survivors, increasing  to more  than 28,[ADDRESS_571819]  assessment  and 
management,  control of hypertension, and assessment  for, and reversal/correction  of, any inherent or 
pharmacologically  induced coagulopathy. The presence of hydrocephalus or elevated  intracranial  pressures, 
secondary  to mass  effect  or concomitant  intraventricular  hemorrhage (IVH),  may require emergent  placement  of 
a ventricular  drainage catheter.  More  pronounced mass  effect  or herniation may require a  craniectomy/craniotomy 
for emergent  evacuation  of the hemorrhage  and/or decompression14. 
 
In those patients  lacking an unambiguous indication for life-saving  surgical  decompression, multiple  randomized 
controlled trials  of more aggressive medical  management  strategies  as well as conventional surgical  evacuation have 
failed  to demonstrate an improvement in clinical  outcomes or survival 8, 15-21. 
 
Randomized Trials  of Medical Management of Intracranial Hemorrhage:  
 
In the Factor  VII for Acute Intracerebral  Hemorrhage Trial,  841 patients  with ICH were randomized to receive  
placebo  or one of two doses of recombinant factor  VIIa (rFVIIa)  within  [ADDRESS_571820], improvement 
with an ordinal analysis  of modified  Rankin scores  (mRS) for the intensive management  group. 
 
Trials  of aggressive management  of cerebral  edema with mannitol have  also failed17-19. 
  
 
Randomized Trials  of Conventional Open  Surgical Management of Intracranial Hemorrhage  
 
Two large  randomized controlled  trials  of conventional open surgery  for intracranial  hemorrhage (Surgical  Trial  in 
Intracerebral  Hemorrhage (STICH)  I and STICH  II) have both demonstrated  no beneficial  effect  for hematoma  
evacuation8, 20. In STICH  I, early  surgical  management  was compared  to standard  medical  
management  in a series  of 1033 patients  with supratentorial ICH.  Three -quarters  of patients  in both arms  of STICH  I 
demonstrated  poor clinical  outcomes or died. Subgroup analyses  of the STICH  I cohort indicated  a potential benefit  
for those patients  with superficial  ICH  (within  1 cm of the cortical  surface)  without intra- ventricular  extension. On 
the basis  of this observation, the STICH  II trial was designed  specifically  to assess the  effects  of conventional 
surgical  management  in this group of patients.  In STICH  II, 601 patients  with superficial  hemorrhages were  
randomized between  early  surgery and conservative management.  59% of patients  in the surgical  group and 61% of 
the patients  in the medical  management  groups had unfavorable outcomes. A trend toward improved mortality  at 6 
months (18% in the early  surgery  group and 24% in the medical  management  group) failed  to reach  significance (p = 
0.095). 
 Taken  t 
ogether,  these  data provide strong  evidence that the conventional open surgical  management  of 
intracerebral  hemorrhage is not beneficial  in patients  with ICH who are not in need  of emergent,  life-saving 
decompression. 
 
1.1 Rationale for study  
 
Why would the minimally  invasive evacuation  of ICH be beneficial?  
 
ICH is thought to induce neurological injury in a biphasic manner.  The primary  neurological  injury is caused  by [CONTACT_449019]1. This form  of injury is not treatable per se, with the 
exception  perhaps of medical  interventions designed to reduce or eliminate  hematoma  early  expansion from  re- 
bleeding. As discussed  above, several  medical  interventions have been  demonstrated to successfully  limit  
hematoma  growth,  but none has been  associated  with a compelling  clinical  benefit.  
 
Secondary  injury to the brain  surrounding the hematoma has been  theorized  to be the sequelae of locally  increased 
pressure  resulting  in reduced  regional perfusion  as well as a direct  cytotoxic  effect  of blood breakdown products on 
adjacent  brain  tissue  (hemotoxicity)22. It is believed  that this secondary  injury is manifest  as peri-hematomal edema  
(PHE) on imaging  studies23-25. 
 
In patients  with  ICH undergoing serial  CT studies over the course of several  weeks,  Zazulia  et al. observed the 
progression of mass  effect  at two distinct time  periods. Early  exacerbation  of mass  effect  (within  48 hours) was 
related  to acute hematoma expansion. Later  progression was  the result  of peri -hematoma l cerebral  edema,  which 
occurred  between  [ADDRESS_571821] invasive manner possible as to avoid inducing additional injury to the brain. 
 
The Case for Minimally Invasive Hematoma Evacuation  
 
The failure  of conventional surgical  evacuation  to improve outcomes in ICH has been  attributed  to the morbidity 
associated  with the craniotomy and surgical  approach.  Specifically,  it has been  proposed that the surgical  approach 
to the hematoma  may cause enough damage  to surrounding brain  to offset  any potential benefits of surgery. 
Correspondingly, it is possible that the potential benefits of hematoma  evacuation could be realized  if the procedure  
could be performed  through a minimally  invasive access.  
 
A large  meta -analysis  of surgical  treatment strategies  for ICH concluded  that surgery could be beneficial  in patients 
undergoing early  surgery (within  8 hours), with moderately  sized  hemorrhages  (20-50cc),  of moderate  age (50 – 69 
years)  and with moderate  to severe clinical  deficits  (GCS  9 – 12). Incidentally, an evaluation  of the contributing 
data sets indicates  that a single  study (Wang  et al.) largely  drove the clinical  benefit  in each of the cohorts35. 
 
Wang  et al
. conducted  a randomized trial in [ADDRESS_571822]-guided  placement  of a puncture needle into the hematoma.  Following the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_448988], a lysis fluid  (containing urokinase) was injected  under pressure into the hematoma.  The drainage  
needle was secured  into position  and allowed  to drain  for 3-5 days after placement.  Using  this technique, the  
authors reported  a significant  improvement in clinical  outcomes with 41% of the craniopuncture group and 63% of 
the medical  management  group being  dependent (mRS  > 2) [ADDRESS_571823]  
reductions in both d eath (46% relative risk reduction) and death  or dependence (47% relative  risk reduction) at the 
end of follow-up in patients  undergoing MIS (minimally invasive surgery)36. 
 
Recently,  two small pi[INVESTIGATOR_448989]  – 
The Minimally  Invasive Surgery  plus tPA for ICH Evacuation  (MISTIE)  and the Clot Lysis:  Evaluating Accelerated  
Resolution of Intraventricular  Hemorrhage (CLEAR  IVH)37, 38. 
 
In MIST
IE, 96 patients  were randomized between  conventional medical  management  (n=42) and minimally invasive  
surgery (n=54).  The minimally  invasive surgical  procedure consisted  of the initial stereotactic placement  of a sheath  
with manual  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_448990] a flexib le drainage catheter  that was irrigated  
with t-PA for up to four days.  These  investigators reported  a significant  reduction  in perihematomal  edema as well as 
trends toward  better  clinical  outcomes at 180 and 365 days25, 37. They  also observed an improvement in mobility  and 
independence in ADLs  at follow-up, as well as a reduction in length  of stay and healthcare expenditures. Moreover, 
the degree  of improvement in clinical  outcome appeared  to be directly  related   to  the volume of hemorrhage 
remaining  at the end of the treatment,  with those patients  with < 10 cc’s of residual  hemorrhage having the best 
outcomes. Unfortunately, only a minority  of patients  in the MISTIE  study achieved  this level of residual  hematoma  
volume. Moreover, it often  took several  days of treatment  before this level  of hematoma  
reduction was reached.  
 
  
In the CLEAR  IVH trial38, 48 patients  with small supratentorial hemorrhages  and large associated  intraventricular 
hemorrhages requiring  ventricular drainage were  randomized between  saline  infusion and intrathecal  tPA (IT-tPA) 
through a ventricular  drain. These investigators  observed that IT-tPA infusion increased  the rate at which  the IVH 
cleared.  Moreover,  patients  with more  rapid  and complete  clearance of IVH  demonstrated  a more  rapid  and 
complete  improvement in neurological  status.  Although a robust signal  for a beneficial  effect  was observed  in the 
IT-tPA group overall, 6 of 26 patients  (23%) in this cohort experienced  symptomatic  re-hemorrhage, with four 
requiring  craniotomy for management.  This symptomatic  re-hemorrhage rate was considerably higher  than that 
observed for irrigation  of parenchymal  drainage catheters  in MISTIE  II. Moreover,  it required  an average  of [ADDRESS_571824],  it requires  days to achieve an adequate evacuation  of blood products using the craniopuncture and catheter 
drainage techniques.  Optimally,  the removal  of blood products should be accomplished  as efficiently  as is feasible  
and safe to limit or eliminate  the potential for secondary injury related  to local  hypoperfusion and/or hemotoxicity. 
Second, the requirement  for an indwelling  drainage catheter  with periodic access  for irrigation  presents the potential  
for infection  and also is labor and resource  intensive. This irrigation  is typi[INVESTIGATOR_448991].  In addition, patients  undergoing tPA infusions require  multiple  serial  scans  to assess the reduction in 
hematoma  volume and to survey for re-bleeding. Finally,  re-bleeding  with thrombolytic irrigation  is not an 
insignificant risk, particularly  with respect  to intraventricular  administration,  as demonstrated  in CLEAR  IVH.  
 
The 
Case for Minimally  Invasive Hematoma  Evacuation using a Mechanical Device  
 
Several  mechanical  techniques  have been  devised  for the minimally  invasive evacuation  of intracranial  hemorrhage. 
A primarily  mechanical  approach offers  several  potential advantages.  First,  an effective mechanical  approach 
provides a means  by [CONTACT_449020],  efficient  and predictable reduction  in hemorrhage volume. 
This is particularly  true if the technique is performed  with direct  visualization  and/or periodic active  monitorin g 
with cross -sectional  CT imaging  and/or ultrasound. It stands to reason  that an immediate  and substantial reduction 
in blood product volume may better  reduce the cumulative  secondary  injury than would a gradual reduction over 
several  days.  Second, with some purely mechanical  approaches, no post- procedural  drainage  catheter  is required, 
eliminating  the resources  required  for the maintenance  of the catheter  as well as the potential for infection  or 
additional hemorrhage  associated  with catheter  manipulation. Third, the avoidance of catheter  irrigation  with t-PA 
reduces  the potential for re-hemorrhage  secondary  to the local  thrombolytic effect.  
 
Intra -operative CT-guided Endoscopic Surgery for ICH (ICES)  
 
The ICES  technique involves the stereotactic  placement  of an endoscopic sheath  into the hematoma.  The hematoma  
is then evacuated  using suction and irrigation  from  two pre-specified  depths. The endoscope is then used to make an 
assessment  of the volume of residual  hemorrhage as well as to assess,  and potentially  control, any active intracranial 
hemorrhage using cautery39. In a small,  single -center  series  of six patients,  the operators were  able to              achieve  
an 80% reduction in hemorrhage volume and a 60% reduction  in midline  shift.  In a second small,  single - center  trial, 
ten patients  were randomized between  the ICES  technique and medical  management.  In the ICES  group (n=6), the 
operators achieved  an 80% reduction in hematoma volume, while  the medical  management  group demonstrated  an 
80% enlargement,  both over a 24-hour period after treatment  allocation40. The trial was ultimately halted  due to slow 
enrollment and the recognition from  the operators that the technique required optimization  within the  context  of a 
single -arm study prior to the performance of a randomized  trial. 
  
The Apollo System  and Artemis Device  
 
The Apollo System received FDA clearance for the controlled aspi[INVESTIGATOR_448981]/or fluid during surgery of the 
ventricular system or cerebrum in March 17, 2016 and CE marking in May 10, 2016 and is commercially available in the [LOCATION_002] and throughout Europe. The Artemis Neuro Evacuation Device received FDA clearance (K171332) on August 14, 2017.  The Apollo System  is an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] -irrigation  apparatus, which  is coupled to a low- profile  wand  (2.1 and  2.6 mm
 
diameter  sizes).  The Apollo  Wand  houses an internal  vibrating  element  that, when  actuated  with a foot pedal, 
macerates  clot material  within  the wand  to maintain  patency  of the system  during aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. This design  allows  a 
targeted  evacuation  of blood products through a minimally  invasive access  without clogging. The Apollo Wands fit 
through the working channels  of commercially  available  neuroendoscopes (Lotta,  Karl Storz,  Tuttlington,  
[LOCATION_013])  such that clot evacuation  can be performed  under direct  visualization41, 42. The technique is very similar  
to the ICES  technique in that a sheath  is placed  within  the hematoma  and evacuation  is typi[INVESTIGATOR_448992].  In some settings,  periodic evaluation  of the remaining  hematoma  is performed 
using intra-procedural  CT or ultrasound42. 
 A successor to the Apollo System, the Artemis Device is a surgical instrument designed to aid a physician in the removal  of tissue and/or fluid during image-guided neurosurgery.  The Artemis Device has two functions. These 
functions are control and transfer of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_448993].  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_448994] a Penumbra Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_448982], which the A rtemis Device connects to through flexible tubing.  The Artemis Device 
has a rigid cannula containing a wire to facilitate removing tissue and/or fluid with the assistance of rotational energy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. The Artemis cannula fits through the working channels of commercially available neuroendoscopes (e.g. Lotta, Karl Storz, Tuttlington, [LOCATION_013]) such that clot evacuation can be performed under 
direct visualization
41, 42. The technique is very similar to the ICES technique in that a sheath is placed with in the 
hematoma and evacuation is typi[INVESTIGATOR_448995]. In some settings, periodic evaluation of the remaining hematoma is performed using intra-procedural CT or ultrasound
42.  The method of 
action of removal is first v acuum aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], which draws the tissue and/or fluid into the lumen of the Artemis 
cannula.  Next, the wire inside the lumen of the Artemis cannula is rotated, facilitating movement of any tissue 
and/or fluid that may otherwise clog the cannula lumen.  The conceptual principles of operation remain the same for the Artemis Neuro Evacuation Device and the Apollo 
System, both of which are used for the controlled aspi[INVESTIGATOR_448981]/or fluid removal.  The Artemis Device utilizes rotational energy, rather than vibrational energy used for the Apollo System, to prevent 
clogging of tissue and/or fluid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_448996]. The helical wire prevents the Artemis cannula from clogging by [CONTACT_449021][INVESTIGATOR_448997]/or fluid throughout the entire length of the cannula. The electrical power to rotate the wire in the Artemis cannula is provided by a battery which drives a motor, both of which are contained in the disposable handle.  
In an initial multi- center,  retrospective  series  of 29 ICH patients  undergoing treatment  with the Apollo system,  an 
average reduction  in hemorrhage volume of 54% was achieved,  with a reduction  of the hemorrhage  volume to < 10 
cc in 48% of patients  treated.  As opposed to the ICES  technique, in most cases,  no drainage catheters  were placed 
following the initial evacuation43. 
 Thus the Apollo System and the Artemis Device potentially provides a means by [CONTACT_449022] a minimally invasive, mechanical evacuation of intracranial hemorrha ge under direct visualization and 
control using a neuroendoscope without the requirement for subsequent catheter placement and thrombolytic 
  
irrigation.  
 
 
Conclusions  
 
Intracranial  hemorrhage is a devastating  disease  associated  with poor clinical outcomes. To date,  no surgical  or 
medical  therapy  has been  demonstrated  to improve outcomes in these patients.  Of all the strategies  tested,  the most  
encouraging data exist  for minimally  invasive strategies  employed  to achieve a reduction  in hemorrhage  volume. 
Initial  data derived from  preliminary  studies of thrombolytic- assisted  catheter  drainage  have been  encouraging,  but 
there are significant  potential shortcomings of this technique compared  to the purely mechanical  approach  with the 
Apollo system  or Artemis Device. Apollo system , has been  commercially  available  for over [ADDRESS_571825]  in subsequent 
RCTs . Specific components of the design are addressed below. 
 
Patients with presenting GCS of < [ADDRESS_571826] feasibility study . Patients with very 
low GCS (3 -4) represent a heterogeneous group and many will have severe, unrecoverable injuries potentially 
involving the brain stem. While some in this group may, in fact, benefit from the Apollo  or Artemis  MIES procedure, 
it is likely that majority will not. Furthermore, this severely injured patient population will likely have substantial 
barriers to follow up and may limit long -term data collection. As such, these patients are excluded from the INVEST 
feasibility study  so as not to include a population that might eventually dilute any evidence of  a potential treatment 
effect  in a subsequent RCT . At the same time, if experienced operators at INVEST centers identify individual patients 
in this group whom they feel will benefit from the Apollo  or Artemis  MIES procedure and intend to treat the patient s 
outside of the INVEST feasibility study, these patients may be eligible for enrollment in the  companion INVEST 
single -arm observational registry (see accompanying protocol).  
 
Patients with hemorrhages less than [ADDRESS_571827] feasibility 
study . Our preliminary experience has indicated that hemorrhages ranging between 30 and 80 cc are feasibly treated 
with Apollo/Artemis  MIES1. A supratentorial hemorrhage of < 30 cc is not likely to create an injury great enough to 
reach an NIHSS of 6 or higher as required for inclusion. Patients with hemorrhages of < [ADDRESS_571828]. Also at this volume level, the hemorrhage represents a much smaller “target”, which increases the challenge of accurately placing the sheath into the hemorrhage. When hemorrhages are larger than [ADDRESS_571829] (even if they were thought to be non- surgic al at presentation). T o reduce (to the extent possible) the incidence of early open surgical 
“bail -out” (or cross—over to Apollo/ Artemis  MIES) for patients randomized into the medical management arm of the 
trial, these patients are excluded . Moreover, when lobar hemorrhages are larger than 80 cc, they tend to be irregularly 
shaped and multi- compartmental, with areas that are difficult to access with the Apollo system/ Artemis Device  -- thus 
reducing the potential to achieve the pre -determined sur gical goal (> 60% reduction and volume < 15 cc) without 
requiring multiple access sites or a larger craniotomy with multiple sheath trajectories
1. 
  
 
Vascular imaging is required in all patients being enrolled in the INVEST feasibility study .  Computed 
tomographic angiography (CTA) (or MRA and conventional angiography) is very informative in patients with 
spontaneous supratentoria l ICH – both lobar and deep. Vascular imaging is critical for excluding an underlying 
vascular lesion, and it is also important for identifying patients at-risk for early hematoma expansion (e.g., those with a “spot sign”). The new AHA ICH guidelines list CTA as a class IIa treatment effect (benefit >> risk)
3.  We feel that 
the requirement for CTA (or MRA in patients with contra-indication to CTA – i.e., history of severe contrast allergy) markedly increases patient safety and is critical to the study. High quality vascular imaging is particularly critical in patients who will undergo Apollo or Artemis  MIES, which could be disastrous if undertaken in the presence of an 
underlying unsecured vascular lesion. MRA may be performed in patients who have absolute contraindications to CTA. Also, conventional angiography may be substituted for CTA or performed for further evaluation of selected patients at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
2. Purpose  and Hypothesis  
 
The primary  aim of minimally  invasive surgery  (MIS)  for supratentorial intracranial  hemorrhage  is to achieve an 
atraumatic  evacuation  of blood products from  the brain  to prevent  the secondary  injury that occurs after the initial  
bleed.  To date,  several  pi[INVESTIGATOR_448998] a small Phase II  feasibility  trial have suggested  that MIS with catheter 
mediated  thrombolytic irrigation  may be associated  with an improvement in clinical  outcomes. Currently  no 
prospective study exists  evaluating  the efficacy  of the minimally  invasive endoscopic surgery  (MIES)  with the 
Apollo system  or Artemis Device for this purpose. The purpose of this feasibility  trial is to provide an initial 
assessment  of the enrollment and follow up practicality within the patient population receiving MIES treatment.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_571830]  of care for the initial evaluation  and follow- up of patients  with intracranial hemorrhage. 
The Apollo or Artemis  MIES  procedure is performed  in a manner, which  is similar  to that of other                      
neuroendoscopic procedures,  and the associated  risks  are likewise  similar.  In brief  (see Section  5 for a detailed 
description of the procedure),  the Apollo/ Artemis  MIES  procedure itself  involves the creation  of a mini- 
craniectomy  and dural incision. An endoscopic sheath  (19-22F)  is then placed  through this access  site into the 
hematoma  under imaging  control using neuronavigation. Then, under endoscopic guidance, the hemorrhage  is 
evacuated  with the Apollo system  or Artemis Device . Following the evacuation, the endoscope and Apollo system  or 
Artemis Device  are removed.  
 
Contr
ol intraoperative (as specified  in Section  5) CT imaging  is performed  to assess the remaining  hemorrhage  
volume and to assess  for immediate  procedural complications.  Based  on the intra-operative control CT imaging, 
either  an additional pass(es)  is made,  or the procedure is terminated.  Following the procedure,  all equipment is 
removed  and the cranial  access  is closed  in a standard  manner.  
 
Risks related  to the procedure include bleeding, infection  or damage to surrounding structures  during the creation  of 
the cranial  access  or placement  of the sheath.  These risks  are all unlikely and  are estimated  to occur  in less than 5% 
of cases.  During  evacuation  of hemorrhagic  products with the Apollo system  / Artemis Device , there is the 
possibility  of inducing or encountering additional hemorrhage in the operative bed. In a retrospective multicenter  
study of the Apollo / Artemis  procedure for the treatment  of ICH,  re-bleeding was encountered  in 2 of 29 patients  
(6.9%).  The risk related  to the general  anesthetic in this patient  population is estimated  to be approximately  1-5% 
for major  morbidity and mortality  (e.g. airway  management  issues,  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], hypotension or drug reaction),  given  
  
that their American Society of Anesthesiologists  (ASA) score  would typi[INVESTIGATOR_448999] 4 or 4e in this category  of 
patients.  
 
All information concerning subjects will be kept confidential. Subjects will be assigned study ID #. No personal identifying information will be used in presentation or publication of data from this study.  A list of all anticipated adverse events is listed in the Manual of Procedures

4.3 Overview  of Study  Flow 
 
 
 
 
 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All sites will keep  a screen  failure  log of all ICH  presenting within  24 hours of symptom onset but who are not  
enrolled  into the study.  Reason(s)  for exclusion  will be recorded.  Logs  will be entered  by [CONTACT_449023] a consistent basis.  Recruitment  rates  will be tracked  over time for each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The actual  recruitment  
rates  as well as potential recruitment  rates  will be useful for planning further clinical  trials  and determining  the 
widespread  impact  of the therapy.  
 
Patients  with ICH or IVH  who are not enrolled  into the trial, but who undergo Apollo or Artemis  MIES  at the 
participating sites,  will be eligible  for a concurrent  prospective, observational, registry  for 180 days (see the 
Manual  of Procedures).

4.5 Recruitment  
The target  population for the Apollo / Artemis  MIES  feasibility  study are patients  22-[ADDRESS_571836] a 
diagnosis of spontaneous, non- traumatic,  intracerebral  hemorrhage  (ICH)  ranging in volume between  30 and 
80cc,  with an associated  significant neurological  deficit  (NIHSS  ≥ 6) who do not require  emergent  open surgical  
decompression related  to uncontrolled intracranial  pressure  or mass  effect.  
 
Potential study participants  and/or their legal  authorized  representative will be identified  by [CONTACT_449024].  Up to [ADDRESS_571837] Head/  CT Angiogram  
Stability  Scan(s)  (CT or MR)  
 
  
 
During screening and baseline evaluations consent is obtained, medical  history screened,  available 
clinical/neurological exams  obtained, and laboratory  work  and imaging  information  per institutional standard  of care 
are evaluated  to determine  patient  eligibility.  The baseline  neurologic examination  will be performed  by a health  care 
provider or study team  member,  certified  to administer the  exams  and able to give an unbiased neurological and 
functional assessments (NIHSS,  Glasgow  Coma Score  (GCS),  and perform  a historical mRS  determination).  CT 
imaging  must be performed  to provide an initial diagnosis of IPH (intraparenchymal hemorrhage) . Hemorrhage 
volume will be determined  using the A x B x C/2 method. Subsequent stability  imaging  (CT (preferred)  or MR)  must 
be obtained at least 6 hours after the presenting  scan to confirm  stability  in the hemorrhage  volume. A CTA  (or MRA  
for CTA  ineligible  patients)  must also be performed,  as standard  of care;  either  at presentation  with the diagnostic 
CT or with the stability  scan.  Enrollment will occur in consented  patients  with a stable  hemorrhage volume on follow 
up CT or MR (< 5 cc increase in volume). In  the case that the stability  scan demonstrates  hemorrhage volume 
increase > 5 cc, a second stability  scan can be obtained q12 hours until either stability  is demonstrated or the patient  
is outside of the window for  treatment  (72 hours from  the time of ictus).  In  the case of a “spot sign”,  follow up CTA  
(or MRA  if ineligible  for CTA)  can be obtained q12 hours to show resolution of the “spot sign”  prior to enrollment.  
An NIHSS  must be obtained prior to enrollment,  and the score  must  be > [ADDRESS_571838] will be conducted for applicable subjects  (<50  years  old and of child bearing potential). Once the patient  meets  
all eligibility  criteria,  has undergone a stability scan, and  the patient  or LAR  (legally authorized representative) has 
provided written informed  consent, they will be considered  enrolled  in the study.  Enrolled  patients  will be treated 
using Apollo / Artemis  MEIS   
 
4.7 Informed  Consent  
A member  of the research  team  will explain  the study’s  objectives to potential candidate patients,  including 
describing  standard  treatment  with the study device,  the requirements  of the clinical  investigation, and risks  and 
benefits  of participating.  All informed  consent documents used under this study protocol will be consistent with 
applicable elements  of ISO14155, Good Clinical Practice Guidelines  (E6, E6(R1), E6(R2)), and 21 CFR  Part 50, 
and will be approved by [CONTACT_81120]’s  reviewing  IRB/EC  prior to study initiation.   
 
5. Study  Screening  and Treatment  Procedure  
The treatment  procedure is described  briefly  below.  The study procedure will take place  within  [ADDRESS_571839] and CTA  (MRA  is acceptable in CTA  ineligible  patients)  is 
required  to confirm  the diagnosis of ICH and exclude a vascular  etiology.  Hemorrhage volume will be measured 
using an A x B x C/[ADDRESS_571840]  evaluation  for non-
spontaneous hemorrhage etiology.  In patients  with a CTA  “spot sign”  on pr esentation imaging,  a follow up CTA  
must be performed  at 12 hours to verify  resolution of this finding prior to enrollment.  
Increase in hematoma size of <5 cc will be considered “stable” on the stability  scan.  In the case that the stability  scan 
demonstrates  hemorrhage volume increase > 5 cc, a second stability  scan can be obtained q12 hours until either 
stability  is demonstrated  or the patient  is outside of the window for treatment (72 hours from  the time of ictus).  
  
Patients  meeting  all inclusion  and no exclusion  criteria  will be eligible  for enrollment after the stability  scan.  
 
5.2 Preparation for Treatment  
 
Patients  enrolled in the trial and receiving  Apollo / Artemis  MIES  will also receive best medical management  in 
addition to the procedure.  Reversible  coagulopathies at presentation  will be corrected  as determined  by [CONTACT_449025].  
Ventricular  drains  will be placed  as deemed  necessary  by [CONTACT_449026].  
 
Apollo / Artemis  MIES  will be performed  under general  anesthesia.  The Apollo / Artemis  MIES  procedure must 
occur  within  72 hours of clinical  presentation  (ictus).  The subject  should be prepared  for the planned intervention 
according  to standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272079].  Apollo / Artemis  MIES  will be performed  as described  below  (5.5)

interventionist in accord  with established  standard  procedural management.  
 
5.4 Devices  and Equipment  
In addition to the Apollo System  and Artemis Device, other devices  required for the procedure are 
listed  in Table 5. Table 5: Devices  that are used during the Apollo / Artemis  MIES  procedure  
 
Standard  Cranial  Access  Devices  and 
Endoscopy Sheath  All FDA  cleared  cranial  access  systems  and 
suitably sized  endoscopy sheaths  (19-22F) 
will be allowed  in the study  
Neuronavigation  System  All FDA  cleared  neuronavigation  systems 
will be allowed  in the study 
Neuroendoscopy  System  All FDA  cleared  neuroendoscopy  systems 
(e.g. Storz  Lotta)  which  incorporate a  
trocar  with a working channel  which  will 
accommodate either the 1.5, 2.1,  or 2.[ADDRESS_571842] Monitoring  (within  or outside  of OR) All FDA  cleared  computed  tomography  or 
cone beam  computed tomography systems 
will be allowed  in the study.  
 
 
All medical  therapy  decisions  are recommended  to be in accordance with guidelines  from  the AHA or Critical care 
guidelines. 
 
  
The specific  types  of devices  used in each Apollo / Artemis  MIES  procedure will be recorded  in the appropriate CRF.  
 
 
5.5 Procedural Protocol 
 
Appropriately protocoled (depending on the institution  and neuronavigation units) MR or CT imaging  studies  will 
be uploaded into the neuronavigation software (e.g., iPlan  Net, Brainlab,  Feldkerchin  [LOCATION_013])  for procedural  
planning and guidance. A trajectory  will be selected  that is both technically  feasible  and allows  access  to the longest 
possible axis of the hematoma.  
 
Patients  will be placed  supi[INVESTIGATOR_449001],  and a sterile  field prepared.  An external  localization  array  
or other neuronavigation localization  mechanism  (e.g. Skull Reference Base  with Skull Reference  Array  with 
Reflective Marker  Spheres,  Brainlab)  will be placed  for registration.  Following  registration,  a second  sterile  field 
will be prepared  over the region  of the cranial  access.  A burr hole or minicraniotomy  will then be created  in a 
standard  manner  of a size large  enough to accommodate the selected  endoscopy sheath. A localization  array  (e.g.,  
Instrument Adapter Clamp  with Instrument Adapter  Array,  Brainlab)  will be attached  to the selected  
neuroendoscopic sheath  (e.g., Aesculap  Inc, Center  Valley,  PA) and registered  to the navigation  system.  The sheath  
will then be advanced  using neuronavigation into the targeted  landing zone  within  the distal aspect  of the hematoma  
and the inner obturator removed. The sheath  will then be stabilized  (e.g.manually stabilized,  mechanically  stabilized,  
or peeled  away  and stapled  down) into position.  The neuroendoscope (e.g.,  Lotta,  Karl Storz,  Tuttlington, [LOCATION_013])  
will then be inserted  into the sheath  and under  direct  visualization the Apollo Wand or Artemis  Device will be 
placed  through the working channel of the trocar.  The sheath  will be irrigated  at the discretion  of the operator using 
the
 irrigation  port of the endoscope and the irrigant  will be  intermittently  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_449002] a clear  working view  is created  within  the sheath  that allows  visualization  of the surgical  field 
at the sheath  tip. When  organized  hematoma  is visualized  at the tip of the sheath,  the Apollo Wand or Artemis  
Device will be advanced  under direct  visualization  to, or just beyond the tip of the sheath  and actuated  to evacuate 
the blood products. If  the working view  becomes  obscured by [CONTACT_449027],  additional irrigation  
and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_449003].  When  all blood products are cleared  from  the 
working field,  the sheath  will be retracted  serially  and the procedure  repeated.  The position of the sheath  will be 
continually monitored directly  using the neuronavigation system.  This technique of evacuating  the hemorrhage from  
distal to proximal will be performed  until the sheath  has been  withdrawn  through the entire  long axis of the 
hematoma  as documented on the neuronavigation. At that point,  further visualization of the evacuated cavity through 
the endoscopic may be performed to ensure there is no active bleeding or substantial residual hematoma.  Once completed, 
the neuroendoscopic trocar  and Apollo Wand or Artemis  Device will be removed. An intra_operative CT (e.g. 
dynaCT,  Siemens,  Medical  Imaging,  Erlangen,  [LOCATION_013])  will then be performed  using cone_ beam  CT, an intra-
operative or portable conventional CT unit, or the OR room will be held open  for re_operations and the patient  may 
be scanned  on a conventional departmental  CT unit with the option to immediately  return  to the OR room if 
necessary.  The control CT will function to confirm  adequate hematoma  evacuation  and to assess  for any 
complications  (e.g., re-bleeding, hydrocephalus, increased  mass  effect).  Additional evacuation  will be performed  as 
specified  above at the discretion  of the operator,  based  upon the data from  the CT. The surgical  goal is to achieve a 
60% reduction  in hemorrhage volume AND a final hemorrhage volume of < 15cc4. 
 
Aft
er the hemorrhage evacuation  is completed,  the sheath  will be removed  and the cranial  access  site will be  closed  
in a standard  manner.  
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_571843]-Procedure Care 
  
 
Standardization of medical  management  will occur  according  to the following: 
 
• General  medical  management  according  to AHA guidelines44 
• Admission  to monitored or intensive care unit for at  least 24 hours 
• Close monitoring of BP with treatment  according  to AHA guidelines44 
• Follow-up imaging  studies as indicated  in any patient  with neurologic deterioration  
 
A post-procedural CT scan will be obtained within  24 hours in all patients  undergoing Apollo / Artemis  MIES.  
Neurological  and functional  exams  will be conducted within  24 hours (+/- 12 hours) in patients  undergoing Apollo / 
Artemis  MIES.  A CT (preferred)  or MR scan will also be obtained [ADDRESS_571844] practices.  
 
5.7.1 Discharge  
 
At discharge,  the following will be completed  by a qualified  member  of the research  or clinical  care team:  a focused 
physical  exam,  a neurological exam  (including GCS,  NIHSS  and mRS),  a review  of any adverse events,  and a 
review  of selected  current  medications.  If discharge occurs  before [ADDRESS_571845] (preferred) or MR will 
be obtained at that time.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_571846]. These costs  will include device costs  (the market  price for each device),  materials  used to 
treat the hemorrhage, and  number of days spent in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (ICU  and non- ICU length  of stay).  In summary,  
the total amount billed  and the total amount reimbursed  will be collected and assessed , if possible.

documentation as appropriate.  
 
1. Modified Rankin Scale:  mRS  is an overall  assessment  of global handicap. In the original  
Rankin Scale,  a score of zero  indicates  the absence of symptoms  and a score of 5, severe  
disability.  The modified  Rankin Scale adds a score of 6 for fatal outcomes. A historical  
mRS  will be obtained to assess the patient’s  level  of function prior to the ICH.  The score  
will be repeated  as specified  in Table 1. 
  
2. Barthel  Index: The Barthel  Index is an ordinal scale used to measure performance of 
activities  of daily  living.  A historical Barthel  Index score will be obtained to assess the  
patient’s  level  of function prior to the ICH.  The score  will be repeated  as specified  in 
Table 1. 
3. The National  Institutes  of Health  Stroke Scale is a 42-point scale that quantifies 
neurologic deficits  in [ADDRESS_571848]  Scale:  Additionally  a quality of life scale outcome measure will be utilized 
in this study.  Quality  of life scales  are designed  to be sensitive  to changes  in outcome  
from  mild and moderate stroke undetected  by [CONTACT_449028].  Important  
parameters  not fully  interrogated  by [CONTACT_449029],  including emotion, communication, cognition, and social  role 
function. Standard  measures,  such as the mRS,  primarily  evaluate phy sical aspects  of 
stroke outcome, not addressing more  relevant  quality of life measures.  The Stroke Impact  
Scale is a validated  assessment  of quality of life specifically  in patients  with stroke. [ADDRESS_571849]  A x B x C/[ADDRESS_571850]  diameter  (A) is measured  in cm. The dimension of the  
hemorrhage perpendicular to the largest  diameter  (B), represents  the second  diameter.  The third  diameter  
(C) will be calcualed  either  by [CONTACT_449030][INVESTIGATOR_449004]. 
Hemorrhage volume s will also be assessed  using a manual  volume measurement  technique on the  
diagnostic scan and all subsequent scans,  as defined  in the Imaging  Manual.  Intraventricular  hemorrhage  
will be assessed  on each scan and graded  according to a modified  Graeb  score  (see the Imaging  Manual  
and Manual  of Procedures).  
Scheduled  imaging  studies include the diagnostic/admission  scan,  the stability  scan(s)  (at least 6 hours 
after the diagnostic scan),  CT or MR angiogram  (with  either  the diagnostic or stability  scan),  Post- 
operative post-presentation  scan [ADDRESS_571851] presentation  scan.

Apollo / Artemis  MIES  
under  general  
anesthesia  within  [ADDRESS_571854].  For each recorded  serious adverse  event,  the patient’s  attending  physician  will 
be asked  to classify  the causal  relationship  of the event to the study treatment as probable, possible, 
unlikely,  and unrelated.  Detailed  form  and narrative reports  of the  following  specific  adverse events  will 
be obtained: 
 
• Death  (all cause)  within  90 days of enrollment 
• Death  within  7 days of enrollment: Immediate  periprocedural  death  
• Symptomatic  Re-Hemorrhage or New  Hemorrhagic  Event: any new intracranial hemorrhage or 
increase in size of pre- existing  hemorrhage (IPH,  IVH  or extra- axial  bleed)  within  90 days 
associated  with an increase  of 4 or more  points on the NIHSS  or GCS  increase > [ADDRESS_571855] 24 hours and/or requiring emergency  surgical  decompression or resulting  in death5, 6. 
• Symptomatic  Evolution of Perihematomal  Edema:  Edema with increased  mass effect  or 
uncontrolled ICPs  within  90 days requiring emergency  surgical  decompression  NOT  related  to 
new or increased  hemorrhage (i.e. edema related)  associated  with an increase  of 4 or more  points 
on the NIHSS  or GCS  increase > [ADDRESS_571856] 24 hours, and/or  requiring emergency  
surgical  decompression  or resulting  in death. 
• Symptomatic  Ischemic  Stroke: A new ischemic  stroke (ipsilateral,  contralateral;  contiguous with 
bleed/operative site or remote; cortical,  subcortical or perforator distribution) within  90 days 
associated  with an increase  of 4 or more  points on the NIHSS  or GCS  increase > [ADDRESS_571857] 24 hours and/or requiring emergency  surgical  decompression or resulting  in death.  
• Surgical  complications  related  to Apollo / Artemis  MIES:  Surgical  site infection, brain  
abscess  or confirmed  meningitis,  or documented complication(s)  deemed  specifically  
related  to the procedural anesthetic (medication,  access  or intubation related)  within  [ADDRESS_571858]  of Apollo / Artemis  MIES upon clinical  outcomes in patients  with 
supratentorial  intracranial hemorrhage with primary endpoints defined as: 
 
• Rat
e of recruitment over a two -year time span following first patient enrollment 
• Rate of successful 180 day follow up obtainment.  
17  
• Statistical details  can be found in section  7.2. 
 
6.1 Analysis  of Primary  Endpoint 
 
6.1.1 Definition  of Analysis Samples  
 
1. Target  Population 
 
The target  population for the Apollo / Artemis  MIES  trial are patients  22-[ADDRESS_571859] a 
diagnosis of spontaneous, non- traumatic,  intracerebral  hemorrhage (ICH)  ranging in volume between  30 and 
80 cc, with  an associated  significant neurological  deficit  (NIHSS  ≥ 6) who do not require  emergent  open  
surgical  decompression  related  to uncontrolled intracranial  pressure  or mass  effect.  
 
 
7. General  Statistical  Considerations 
General  Design  
The Apollo / Artemis  MIES  Trial  is a multicenter,  single arm feasibility study  investigating  the potential efficacy  of 
Apollo / Artemis  MIES  to improve clinical  outcomes  in patients  with spontaneous, non- traumatic,  ICH  presenting  
within  24 hours. The primary  hypothesis to be tested  is that Apollo / Artemis  MIS patients can be recruited and 
followed successfully for 180 days. 
 
 
7.1 Sample  Size Estimation  for the Primary  Outcome  
 
Sample  Size Calculation  
 
 The Apollo / Artemis  MIES Trial is a prospective, multi- center , single- arm feasibility trial investigating enrollment 
of the Apollo / Artemis  MIES in patients with spontaneous, non-traumatic, ICH presenting within 24 hours. Up to 
50 subjects will be enrolled in this study. The primary outcome assessed at trial completion will be successful capture of 180 day modified Rankin score (mRS) for those 50 patients enrolled in the study.  Additionally, we will analyze the proportion of patients achieving mRS of 0-3 and 90 day mortality.  
 
 
 
7.2 Statistical Evaluation   
 
Statistical  Analysis of Primary  Outcome  
 
Two-si
ded 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the  proportion of subjects with captured mRS scores at the 
180-day follow-up visit using the exact binomial distribution.   
Statistical Analysis of Secondary  Outcome s
 
 
Secondary efficacy analyses will include 180- day global disability assessed  via mRS , analyzed as the proportion of 
patients achieving mRS of 0 -3.  Two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the proportion of 
subjects with mRS  scores of [ADDRESS_571860] binomial distribution. The Kaplan-
Meier Curve will be generated to assess the 90 day mortality. With the date of enrollment set at day 0, and any 
death occurring on or before day 90 will be included as a death . 
18  
 
Subsequent Statistical Analysis  
 
Statistical analysis of the SIS -ADL, SIS -mobility, EQ -5D-5L, and Length of Stay will be analyzed with confidence 
intervals.  
 
Other pre -specified analyses will be performed as outlined in the statistical plan.  
 
7.3 Missing  Data  and Imputation Methods 
 
Every effort will be made to keep all missing data, particularly the Day 180 outcomes, to a minimum. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_449005]’ 
best efforts, some missing data may be inevitable mainly due to lost -to-follow -up (LTFU). The number and proportion of 
subjects eligible for and compliant with each follow -up examination will be presented. Subjects who withdraw from the study 
will be tabulated with reasons for withdrawal. Additional details will be provided in the Statisti cal Analysis Plan (SAP).  
 
7.4 Secondary Statistical Analysis  
 
Statistical analysis  of the raw Rankin outcome scores  of 0 to 6 (with  5 and 6 collapsed)  will be conducted with an 
adjusted  ordinal logistic  regression  model (proportional odds model). This analysis  will be adjusted  using  key 
baseline  variables.  The odds ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval will be presented  for the treatment  
effect.  
 
Group  differences  will be analyzed  by [CONTACT_11339]-parametric  Wilcoxon  rank  sum test for the following:  
• SIS-ADL  
• SIS-mobility  
• EQ-5D- 5L 
• Length  of Stay 
 
Other  pre-specified  analyses  will be performed  as outlined in the statistical plan. 
 
 
7.5 Safety Analysis  
 
7.5.1 Safety  Outcomes 
Safety  outcomes  
Several  specific adverse events  are monitored throughout the study.  However  the primary  safety  outcome to be 
assessed  at completion  of the trial will be death  within  90 days.  
 
 
7.5.2 Interim  Safety  Monitoring  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_449006] ( TOC ) and Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) will receive periodic safety  
reports  of all AEs and SAEs.  In addition, the following specific  endpoints will be assessed  by [CONTACT_449031]:  
 
• Death  (all cause)  within  90 days of enrollment 
• Death  within  7 days of enrollment: Immediate  periprocedural  death  
19  
• Symptomatic  Re-Hemorrhage or New  Hemorrhagic  Event: any new intracranial hemorrhage or 
increase in size of pre- existing  hemorrhage (IPH,  IVH  or extra- axial  bleed)  within  90 days 
associated  with an increase  of 4 or more  points on the NIHSS  or GCS  increase > [ADDRESS_571861] 24 hours and/or requiring emergency  surgical  decompression or resulting  in death5, 6. 
• Symptomatic  Evolution of Perihematomal  Edema:  Edema with increased  mass effect  or 
uncontrolled ICPs  within  90 days requiring emergency  surgical  decompression  NOT  related  to 
new or increased  hemorrhage (i.e. edema related)  associated  with an increase  of 4 or more  points 
on the NIHSS  or GCS  increase > [ADDRESS_571862] 24 hours and/or requiring emergency  
surgical  decompression  or resulting  in death. 
• Symptomatic  Ischemic Stroke: A new ischemic  stroke (ipsilateral,  contralateral;  contiguous with 
bleed/operative site or remote; cortical,  subcortical or perforator distribution) within  9s 
associated  with an increase  of 4 or more  points on the NIHSS  or GCS  increase > [ADDRESS_571863] 24 hours and/or requiring emergency  surgical  decompression or resulting  in death. 
• Surgical  complications  related  to Apollo / Artemis  MIES:  Surgical  site infection, brain  
abscess  or confirmed  meningitis,  or documented complication(s)  deemed  specifically  
related  to the procedural  anesthetic (medication,  access  or intubation related)  within  [ADDRESS_571864]  know how the hemorrhage was treated  in order  to effectively 
report  the adverse event  and plan further treatment.  Blinding the study is not required  for interpretation  of study 
outcomes. 
 
 
8. Study  Withdrawal  
 
Subjects  may be terminated  or withdrawn  from  the study for the following reasons:  
• Voluntary withdrawal  of consent–– meaning  that a subject  voluntarily chooses  not to participate  further in 
the study.  All data collected  up to the withdrawal  of consent will be maintained  in the study database.  
• Lost to follow-up –– defined as a subject who is more  than one month late to a study visit and for whom  [ADDRESS_571865] one certified  letter  were  unsuccessful. 
• Subjects  may also be withdrawn  at the investigator’s  discretion  if within  their best interest.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_571866] who does not attend  a scheduled follow-up visit should be contact[CONTACT_449032](s). If the missed  visit was due to a serious adverse event, (e.g.,  re- 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  an AE Case Report Form  (CRF)  must be completed  and any reporting requirements  met. 
 
 
9. Data  Safety  Monitoring  Board (DSMB)  
A DSMB  will be comprised  of [ADDRESS_571867]  
physicians  and a statistician.  The DSMB  will exercise review  of the overall safety  of the trial, periodically  review all 
adverse  events  occurring in the trial, and make recommendations to adjustments  in the study protocol, should any be  
20  
considered  necessary  for safety  or other related  reasons. Additional details  will be specified  in the DSMB  charter.  
 
 
10. Trial  Operating  Committee  (TOC)  
The TOC  will consist of the study PIs, statistical PI, project  managers,  data managers,  and others deemed  necessary 
in overseeing the day- to-day operations of the trial. The TOC  will review  study progress,  study conduct at 
individual clinical  sites,  other  clinical site performance  measures,  and blinded DSMB  reports.  
 
 
11. Steering  Committee  (SC)  
The SC will be comprised of the trial PI’s and selected  principal investigators  from  participating centers.  The SC 
will be responsible for overall  supervision and execution  of the trial including adherence to protocol, progress of 
enrollment,  patient  safety  and consideration of new information. Daily  trial management  is the responsibility  of the 
TOC.  It will provide key input to the SC for study planning, execution  and data presentation.

the TOC.  
 
 
15. Investigator Records  
The Investigator  must ensure that all study subject  records  are stored  for at least [ADDRESS_571871] the investigational site so that arrangements  can be made for the handling or transfer  of study records.  
 
The Investigator will also maintain  original source documents from  which  study- related  data are derived,  which 
include, but are not limited  to: 
 
22  
• Clinic  progress notes recording subject’s  medical  history and medications; 
 
• Medical  charts  with operative reports  and condition of subject  upon discharge;  
 
• Medical  records  regarding  AEs/SAEs,  including treatment  and clinical  outcome; 
 
• Results  of diagnostic examinations,  imaging  (such  as x-rays,  MRIs),  as well as the report  of the radiologist’s 
reading/interpretation  of diagnostic imaging;

subjects  at the required  follow-up visits  until subject’s  participation  in the study is complete  or terminated;  
 
• Records  relating  to patient death  (e.g.,  death  certificate,  autopsy report,  if available,  or terminal medical  
records).  
 
15.1 Data  Collection  
 
15.1.1 Data  Management Overview  
Data management  will  be handled by [CONTACT_449035], which  is housed in the Department  
of Neurological  Surgery  at the Mt. Sinai  Medical  Center  (MSMC) , and its representatives. All activities  will be 
conducted in coordination with the study PI, the sites,  and the TOC.  The data validation  procedure will be 
implemented  in two stages. First,  the automated  data checks  will flag items  that fail a rule, and the rule violation  
message will appear  on the data entry  screen  at the time of data entry.  The Study Coordinator at a site will see these 
rule violations and will be required  to provide a response. His/her  choices  are to: (1) correct  the entry  immediately; 
(2) correct  the entry  at a later time; or (3) if the entered  data are confirmed  to be correct,  dismiss  the rule by [CONTACT_449036], REDCap  system.  Any changes  made to the data will 
have a full audit trail. Second, for some checks  that are more  complicated,  additional consistency checks  will be run 
periodically  after data entry  occurs  at the site. All data items  that fail the programmed  consistency checks  will be 
queried  via the data clarification  request  (DCR)  process initiated  by [CONTACT_449037]/or their 
repr
esentatives . Site Monitors will also be able to generate DCRs  when  discrepancies  are found during source 
document verification.  The DCRs  will be generated, communicated  to the sites,  and resolved  within the secure study 
database. 
 
In addition to the study database,  MSMC  will provide the site staff password  protected  access  to a standard  set of 
web-enabled  tools, including subject  visit calendar,  subject  accrual  status,  case report form  completion status,  and 
outstanding DCR  status  pertaining to their respective sites.  
 
 
15.1.2 Data  Acquisition  and Central  Study  Database  
The entire  study will be conducted using an electronic data acquisition  method where all clinical  data on enrolled 
subjects  will be data entered  (single -keyed) by [CONTACT_449038] a web-based  data management  system, 
REDCap.  In order  to provide user-friendly and easy-to-navigate  interfaces,  the REDCap  data capture screens  are 
designed  based  upon individual CRFs.  Prior to study start,  the system  is validated  to ensure the data entry  screens  
mirror the CRFs  and that the pre- progr ammed  data rules  appropriately detect  incorrect  data.  The data will be 
managed  after data entry  via data queries from  the MSMC.  
The latest  version of each CRF  and source documents will be available as a PDF file on the REDCap  website  for use  
by [CONTACT_3462]. This process  facilitates  version  control of these study related  documents, particularly  since  
documents may evolve over the course of the study. 
 
This u
ser friendly web -based  database system,  developed and validated  by [CONTACT_449039],  will be used for subject  data 
entry,  data validation, project  progress  monitoring, subject  tracking,  user customizable  report  generation  and secure 
data transfer.  
[ADDRESS_571872] progress. The reports  will be  presented  to the TOC in  a manner that 
protects  the integrity  of the study (e.g.,  blinded). 
 
MSMC  will provide the TOC  and authorized study personnel access  to a standard  set of web-enabled  tools within 
REDCap.  These tools allow  the authorized research  personnel to track trial progress by [CONTACT_449040].  Other assistive tools and available information includes  subject enrollment logs,  basic 
subjec t demographics, CRF  completion  rate and number of data queries  outstanding and resolved.  
 
 
15.[ADDRESS_571873] part of security  is physical  protection  of the hardware  systems  employed  by [CONTACT_449039].  The facility  
housing the MSMC  hardware is protected  24/[ADDRESS_571874]  and secure  the data stored  in REDCap’s  back  end 
database, the software application  employs  various methods to protect  against  malicious  users  who may attempt to 
identify  and exploit any security  vulnerabilities  in the system.  In REDCap,  all incoming data gets intentionally  
filtered, sanitized,  and escaped.  Server  environment variables  that are vulnerable to forgery by [CONTACT_124702]-users  are also 
checked   and  sanitized.  To specifically  protect  against  Cross -Site Request  Forgery (CSRF),  which  is another method 
of attack, REDCap  utilizes  a “nonce” (a secret,  user-specific  token) on every  web form  used in the application. The 
nonce is generated  as a unique value for each new REDCap  session  
 
To mainta
in electronic records  in the database as adequate and accurate,  the REDCap  system  tracks  all changes  
made to any  dynamically  managed  electronic  records.  REDCap  has a built- in audit trail that automatically  logs all 
user activity  and logs all pages  viewed  by [CONTACT_449041],  including contextual  information  (e.g. the  project or record  
being accessed).  The logging record  can itself  be viewed  within  a project  by [CONTACT_449042].  The Logging  page allows  such users  to view  or export the entire  audit trail for that project,  
and also to filter  the audit trail in various ways  based  upon the type of activity  and/or user. This audit- trail 
information  is created  with a computer generated  time-stamp  and the user name [CONTACT_449056],  when  the 
original data is modified  or deleted.  
 
 
16. Adverse Events  
Adverse events  (AEs) may occur  at any time after enrollment. Pre-existing  conditions will be documented in the 
subject’s  medical  record  as part of prior medical  history but will not count  against  either  study procedure unless 
there is a worsening of the condition during the study.  Adverse  events  (serious and non-serious) will be documented 
on an Adverse Event  CRF.  Non-serious adverse events will be recorded  from  enrollment through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449007] 7 days whichever is earlier.  Serious adverse events will be recorded from  enrollment through the end of study 
(i.e., 90 day follow-up). 
 
Investigators will record  characteristics  of each adverse event  on an Adverse Event CRF.  Each  adverse event  will be  
judged by [CONTACT_449043]. 
[ADDRESS_571875]’s  usual  activity  or 
symptoms  
require  treatment  
Severe  Symptom(s)  cause  either  severe  discomfort  or have  a 
significant  impact  
of the subject’s usual activity  and symptoms  require  treatment  
 
 
 
16.[ADDRESS_571876]  and may require  medical  or 
surgical  intervention to prevent  one of the outcomes listed  in this definition. Examples  of such medical  events 
include (but are not limited  to): allergic  bronchospasm requiring  intensive treatment  in an emergency  room or at 
home; blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or, the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  Serious adverse events  should not be reported  for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449008]:  for a diagnostic or elective  surgical  procedure related  to a pre-existing 
condition; to allow  for an efficacy  measure for the study;  or, for a planned surgical  procedure that was not the result  
of a condition worsening due to participation  in the study.  
 
An assessment  should be made regarding  the seriousness,  severity  and relationship  to the investigational devices  and 
investigational procedure.  The following factors  should be considered  when  evaluating  causality  of adverse events:  
1) the temporal  s equence from  the study procedure;  2) patient's  response after discontinuation or re-introduction;  
and, 3) severity  of the event.  The investigators, on the basis  of their clinical  judgment and guided by [CONTACT_449044], should determine  the relationship  of an adverse  event  to the administration  of the investigational device, 
and/or study procedure(s) as: definitely  related,  i.e. following in a reasonable temporal  sequence,  known to be a 
complication,  and having no other explanation; probably related,  i.e. following in a reasonable  temporal  sequence  
and not reasonably explained  by [CONTACT_102]’s  clinical  state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; possibly related,  i.e. could  have been 
explained  by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_449009]’s  clinical  state;  or not related.  
 
16.2 Reporting and Review  of Adverse Events  
 
To provide for consistent reporting of adverse events, serious and non- serious  adverse events  will be recorded  on the  
Adverse Event CRF.  Non-serious adverse events  will be recorded  from  enrollment through Day 7 or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954] (whichever  occurs  first).  Serious adverse  events  will be recorded  from  enrollment through the end of study 
(i.e., 90 day final follow-up visit,  death,  or withdrawal  of consent). 
 
25  
In order to ensure prompt reporting of adverse events, we require that all adverse events  be entered  into the REDCap  
web-based  database  (REDCap)  within  five working days of their becoming aware  of the event  during the initial 
admission. For all serious  adverse events  (SAEs),  we require that they be reported  in the REDCap  within  [ADDRESS_571877] being  made aware  of the occurrence of the SAE.  The 24- hour reporting requirement  for 
SAEs  applies  to all study phases.  
 
Reporting of serious or life-threatening  adverse events  will trigger notification  of the event  to the Medical  Monitor 
(MM).  The MM will conduct an independent review  of these specific  SAE.  If the MM believes  the adverse  event  is 
serious, unexpected  and either  definitely,  probably, or possibly related  to the investigational device(s)  and/or study 
procedures, the TOC  staff will forward  a Safety  Report (pre-filled  with as much  data as possible) to the clinical  site 
Investigator to be completed  with any additional information  that may be relevant  to the SAE.  The Safety  Reports 
will be included in the reports  prepared  for the DSMB.  The principal investigator,  at each clinical  site, will be  
responsible for reporting to his/her own IRB/EC  according  to individual IRB/EC  policies.  After the submission of 
the initial Safety  Report, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_449010]-up information  about the event,  in order for it to be  report ed it to the TOC.  
 
If it is det
ermined  that an unanticipated  adverse device effect  presents  an unreasonable risk to subjects,  the Principal  
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_449011]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_449012] a determination  regarding  termination  not later than [ADDRESS_571878] been  deemed  to present the risk(s) shall  occur  not later than 5 working days after the PI [INVESTIGATOR_449013].  
 
The trial will resume only after determining  there is sufficient  evidence to reinstate  the trial, and after each clinical  
site obtains IRB/EC  approval. 
 
 
17. Ethical  Considerations  
 
The rights,  safety  and well-being of clinical  investigation  subjects  shall  be protected  consistent with the ethical  
principles laid down in the Declaration  of Helsinki.  This shall  be understood, observed and applied  at every  step in 
this clinical  investigation.  
 
It is expected  that all parties  will share  in the responsibility  for ethical  conduct in accordance  with their respective  
roles  in the investigation. The Sponsor and the Investigator(s)  shall  avoid improper influence or inducement  of the  
subject,  monitor, the clinical  investigator(s) or other parties  participating  in or contributing to the clinical  
investigation.  
 
18. Protection  of Patient  Confidentiality  
At all times  throughout the clinical  investigation, confidentiality  will be observed  by [CONTACT_449045]. All data 
shall  be secured  against unauthorized access.  Privacy  and confidentiality  of information  about each subject  shall  be 
preserved  in study reports  and in any publication. Each  subject  participating  in this study will be assigned  a unique  
identifier.  
 
The Investigator will maintain  a confidential study subject  list identifying  all enrolled  subjects.  This list will contain 
the assigned  study subject’s unique identifier  and name.  The Investigator bears  responsibility for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_143097]. 
 
Monitors and auditors will have access  to the study subject  list and other information  that personally identifies  study 
subjects  to ensure that data reported  in the CRF  corresponds to the person who signed  the ICF and the information 
contained  in the original source documents. Such  personal identifying  information  may include, but is not limited  to 
the subject’s  name,  address, date of birth, and medical  record  number.

19. Ethics  Committee/Institutional  Review  Board Approval  
Institutional Review  Board  (IRB)  / Ethics  Committee  (EC) approval is required  prior to study commencement.  The 
Investigator must also obtain renewal  of IRB/EC  approval as dictated  by [CONTACT_449046]  (but at least annually) 
during the entire  duration of the study.  The Investigator is responsible for fulfilling  any conditions of approval  
imposed by [CONTACT_3488]/EC,  such as regular  reporting,  study timing,  etc. Study data required  to be included in 
IRB/EC  reports  (e.g.,  Continuing Reviews)  must be obtained from  the SDMC;  in order to ensure that accurate and 
consistent data are presented.  
 
The Investigator will provide the Project  Management  (PM) team  with copi[INVESTIGATOR_449014]. 
Withdrawal  of IRB/EC  approval must be reported  to the PM team  immediately  following  the investigator’s 
knowledge of the withdrawal.  
 
The reviewing  Independent Review  Board  (IRB)  / Ethics  Committee  (EC) must review  and approve an Informed 
Consent Form  (ICF)  specific  to this study.  Prior to the start of the trial, the PM team  will provide each study center 
with a sample  ICF.  The study center,  to meet  specific requirements,  may modify  this sample  ICF;  however, the ICF 
must contain  all of the elements  required  by [CONTACT_760], regulations, and GCP.  Each  investigational site will submit  
a copy  of their ICF to the TOC  prior to submission to their IRB;  and, the IRB/EC  approved ICF  and renewal  
approvals to the PM team  as required  for the duration of the study.  The original, signed  and dated  ICF should be  
retained  by [CONTACT_449047],  and a copy  provided to the subject.  
 
 
20. Informed  consent  
Upon confirmation  of  patient’s  eligibility,  a written  informed  consent document must be obtained prior to any study- 
specific evaluations being  conducted. In accordance with US FDA  regulations (21 CFR  50) and ICH -GCP 
Consolidated Guidelines (Federal  Register,  May 9, 1997, Vol. 62, Number 90), a witnessed,  IRB-approved, 
informed  consent will be required  from  all subjects or their legal  representative (LAR)  or family  member,  as  
defined  in 21 CFR  50.3(m), prior to participating  in this trial. At the initial contact  [CONTACT_4490] a potential candidate,  the 
investigator(s)  will provide an adequate explanation  of the purpose, procedures,  possible risks/benefits,  and 
participant  responsibilities; in addition to the fact that his/her participation  is voluntary, that he/she may withdraw 
from  the study at  any time,  and that the decision  not to participate  or to withdraw will not affect  subject’s  care in any 
way.  Potential participants  or their legal  representative or family  member  will be given  ample  opportunity to ask 
questions and to consider their decision. If the subject  expresses  a sustained  interest,  a signed  and dated  written 
informed  consent will be obtained. A copy  of the consent form  will be given  to the participant  or their legal  
representative or family  member,  and another copy will be placed  in his/her medical  reco rd. The informed consent  
must be obtained by [CONTACT_449048] [INVESTIGATOR_449015]. Each  of the study team  members  with this delegation  must be qualified  in 
terms  of education, experience,  and training  to obtain informed  consent. 
 
The written  informed  consent  document (and any other  written  information  to be provided to the study subject) 
should be updated  whenever  new information  becomes  available that may require significant revisions to the 
informed  consent document previously signed  by a subject.  Any such revision or update must be approved by [CONTACT_373319]/EC  before being  provided to the study subject.  Previously consented subjects  will be made aware  of 
the changes  and depending on the extent  and/or severity  of the new information  a subject  may be asked  to “re- 
consent” to continued participation  in the trial. 
 
 
21. Quality  Assurance  
To ensure monitoring  responsibilities  are performed  to the fullest extent  possible on a real-time basis  through the  
REDCap  system , an experienced  clinical  research  group will perform  on-site and centralized  monitoring for the trial. 
Sites will be responsible for  uploading all applicable source documents into the REDCap  system.  MSMC  staff and 
27  
their representatives will manage  the assignment  of monitors to  performance  sites,  the coordination of monitoring 
visits,  and provide support to monitors while  they are in the field.  In addition to on-site monitoring, centralized  
monitoring (per the FDA’s  most recent  monitoring guidance  developed  in August 2013) reflects  a modern, risk-
based  approach. Centralized  monitoring focuses  on critical  study parameters  and relies  on a combination of 
monitoring activities.  In this recent  guidance,  the FDA  has encouraged the implementation  of centralized  
monitoring due to its ability  to ensure quality and integrity  of data.  Centralized monitoring is also very effective at 
identifying  data fraud, data fabrication, and data errors.  
 
For the first subject  enrolled  at any site, 100% of the data will be verified  to source documents. For subsequent  
subjects , at minimum, key outcome and safety  data will be reviewed against source document s. Source documents 
verifying  each data point  collected  in the trial will be uploaded into REDCap  for all study subjects.  This will allow  
for data to be monitored in a real-time fashion and for any errors  in data to be identified  more  quickly. A target  of no 
less than 50% of the trial data submitted  to the REDCap  database will be verified  against  source documents from  the 
performance sites prior to  final data analysis.  Safety  and efficacy  variables  represent  approximately  half of the data 
to be verified. The remaining  half of source monitored data include: 100% of deaths  and 100% of serious adverse 
events  and all MSMC  requested  source data reviews  based  on the per-subject  evaluation  of safety  parameters  defined 
in the protocol. All data monitored are verified  for accuracy  and thoroughness using the most appropriate source 
documents for all subjects. 
 
Sign
ed informed  consent documents and HIPAA  policies are monitored for all subjects.  Additional monitoring 
verification will include: ongoing evaluation  of the adequacy  of site facilities  and staff,  site recruitment,   
the presence  of regulatory documents, and specific review  of documents and data as requested  by [CONTACT_449049]. Each  site will be monitored on a real-time basis  through the uploading of all source 
documents into the REDCap system.  Sites  are evaluated  in an ongoing manner by [CONTACT_449050] a need  to monitor more  frequently  and/or more  thoroughly or via on-
site evaluation. 
 
Any omissions and corrections to data submitted  to the database are noted and queries  are generated  by [CONTACT_449051].  All queries  will be stored  in REDCap’s  logging and audit  trail so that all data 
changes  or questions regarding  data accuracy  are tracked  and permanently  recorded.  The auditing  trail will contain  
information  regarding  which  monitor issued  the query,  which  user was assigned  the query at each site, the complete  
free text conversations discussing data questions and/or changes,  and will provide time and date stamps  for all query  
related  processes.  
 
Monitors will perform  closeout-monitoring evaluations at the completion  of subject  enrollment.  The monitor will 
again  review  all regulatory files and verify  documents for accuracy  and completeness  as directed  by [CONTACT_449052] . Sites  are instructed  in the record  retention  of all trial documents. Principal 
Investigators are directed  to close  the trial and issue  a final report to their IRB/EC  following resolution of any and 
all outstanding issues at that site. Finally,  any additional special  considerations for the auditing of any additional 
safety  issues will be made.  
 
All doc
uments and data shall  be produced and maintained  in such a way to assure  control of documents and data to 
protect  the subject’s  privacy  as far as reasonably  practical. Only  users  with password- protected  REDCap  access will  
have the ability  to view  study data within  the secure REDCap  database.  The Primary  Investigator, Sponsor, the 
Sponsor’s representatives, and representatives  of regulatory  authorities  are permitted  to inspect  the study documents 
(e.g.,  study protocol, CRFs, and original study- relevant  medical  records/files)  as needed. All attempts  will be made 
to preserve subject  confidentiality. 
 
 
22. Protocol  Deviations  
A protocol deviation  is defined  as any study action  taken  by [CONTACT_449053]. All protocol deviations will be entered  into REDCap  within  [ADDRESS_571879]  in an emergency.  Investigators will also adhere to procedures  for reporting study deviations to their IRB/EC  
in accordance with their specific  IRB/EC  reporting  policies  and procedures.  
 
Good Clinical Practice  Guidelines require  that Investigators  maintain  accurate,  complete and current  records, 
including documents showing the dates  of and reasons for each deviation from  the protocol. 
 
 
23. Final  Report  
A final report will be completed,  even  if the study is prematurely  terminated.  At the conclusion of the trial, a multi- 
center  abstract  reporting  the results  will be prepared  and may be presented  at a major  meeting(s).  A multi- center 
publication may also be prepared  for publication in a reputable scientific  journal. The publication of results  from  any 
single  center  experience within  the trial is not allowed  until the aggregate study results  have been  published, unless 
there is written  consent from  the study PI. 
 
 
24. Information Confidentiality  
All information  and data generated  in association  with this study will be  held in  strict confidence and  remain  the sole  
property of the Principal Investigator. The Investigator  agrees  to use this information  for the sole purpose of 
completing this  study and for no other purpose without written  consent from  the Trial  Operating  Committee.  
 
 
25. Trial  Registration  
The study will be registered  in a publicly accessible trial database  (e.g.,  clinicaltrials.gov)  prior to study initiation.  
 
26. Risk  Analysis  
A thorough risk analysis  was performed  as part of design  control recommendations of the Quality  System  
Regulation  (21 CFR  820). 
 
 
27. Publication  Policy  
Publication  of the results  of this trial will be governed by [CONTACT_449054].  The Publication Policy  will be fully compliant  with the voluntary  NIH Public  Access  
Policy  mandated by [CONTACT_449055] 2008 (Division G, Title  II, Section  [ADDRESS_571880] 110- 
161).

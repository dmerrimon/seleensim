Protocol Date: 5-8-2018 1.0 Background  
Cigarette smoking significantly increases the risk of multiple cancers, accounting for more than 30% of all 
cancer deaths and 80% of deaths from lung cancer 1. Compared to whites, African Americans have lower 
cessation rates and are disproporti onately burdened by [CONTACT_95556]2,3, underscoring the urgent need for 
improved smoking cessation strategies in these underserved groups. Personalizing standard care 4 with 
biological data to enhance accuracy of lung cancer risk 5 or measure speed of nicotine metabolism to inform 
pharmacotherapy c hoice 6 is a promising, yet understudied, approach in low income minority smokers.  
 
The Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) is comprised of adults who were ages 40 -79 at cohort entry 
and who reside in twelve states throughout the southeastern US.  The majority (86%) were enrolled at 71 
CHCs, which continue to serve as study partners, with recruitment completed in 2009. In addition to annual 
passive follow up of the SCCS from 2008 to 2012 via linkage with national and state mortality and cancer 
registrie s, the entire surviving cohort was re -contact[CONTACT_45143] a follow -up self or telephone 
administered survey, wit h a nearly 70% response rate. The follow -up survey elicited information on new health 
outcomes and updated information on exposures and lifestyle factors, including smoking.  Smoking -related 
questions were added to the 3rd follow up in order to probe participants ’ motivation, use of quit aids, receipt of 
provider advice, quit attempts, and cessation.   
 
Through the SCCS, genetic  polymorphism s in cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6), a primary driver of 
metabolism of nicotine and carcinogenic tobacco -specific nitrosamines, have been found to predict lung cancer 
risk in African -American male smokers7. Additionally, it has been found that i ndividuals who metabolize 
nicotine and nitrosamine more quickly, termed “fast/normal” m etabolizers, have a 45% higher risk of lung 
cancer compared to so -called “slow” metabolizers8.  
 
2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims  
 
Biologically informed  precision  treatment could benefit smokers in several ways. Biological tailoring may 
increase the salience of messaging about smoking -related disease and advice to quit. This in turn could 
reduce the optimistic bias, a tendency to underestimate one’s own health risk , which hinders cessation efforts9, 
thereby [CONTACT_707560].  Data has demonstrated that the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), a 
biomarker reflecting CYP2A6 activity, can inform choice of smoki ng cessation pharmacotherapy, such that 
“fast/normal” metabolizers are twice as likely to quit smoking on varenicline compared to “slow” metabolizers6. 
Additionally, smokers who are presented results from a commercially available , gene -based lung cancer risk 
assessment, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_707544], are more likely to undergo lung cancer screening10-13.  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_707545] (NRT) and quit smoking5,14-16.Though promising  tools to 
help engage smokers in cessation treatment , these individual, biologically informed  feedback interventions 
have not yet been studied in community smokers in the US.  
 
Our overarching aim is to leverage the SCCS and the U54 Community Outreach Core Community 
Advisory Board (CAB) to guide the development of two precision  care (PC) interventions for smoking 
cessation: PC -NMR and PC -Respi[INVESTIGATOR_707544]. Both will be tailored to atti tudes and beliefs of low 
socioeconomic status (SES) community smokers in the southeastern US, where tobacco use 
prevalence is one of the highest in the country. PC is rooted in the PRIME Model of behavior change17-19, 
which  reflects a multi -faceted view of motivation for tobacco cessation. We will assess feasibility of PC in 
SCCS participants who smoke and conduct a 3 -arm ra ndomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine preliminary 
estimates of PC interventions vs. standard guideline -based care (GBC) on engagement4,20, smoking cessation, 
and likelihood of undergoing recommended lung cancer screening if eligible21. Our hypothesis is that, 
compared to GBC, PC participants will exhibi t higher smoking cessation and lung cancer screening rates. 
These effects will be explained by [CONTACT_707561], higher self -efficacy and motivation to quit, and use of 
proven quit aids (medication, behavior therapy via state quit line).  
 
Protocol Version #: 5      Page 4 
Protocol Date: 5-8- 2018 To accomplish our aim, daily smokers who are SCCS participants and providers at SCCS Community Health 
Centers (CHC), in Mississippi [INVESTIGATOR_707546]. Survey results will inform CAB-guided development of the PC study 
interventions. PC interventions will then be pi[INVESTIGATOR_66376] a RCT of up to 100 SCCS daily smokers willing to make a 
quit attempt with medication and be randomized 1:1:[ADDRESS_961483] participants are referred to the shared TN/MS state quitline and provided the NCI “Clearing the Air” standard intervention. 
 An overview of Aims 1 
and 2, which are now 
completed, is shown to the left.  
 Aim 1: Survey up to  
1400  TN and MS SCCS 
smokers and up to  45 
selected CHC providers to assess attitudes and beliefs on smoking-
related health risk 
perceptions, precision 
smoking treatment, and 
willingness to engage in a smoking cessation 
trial of PC.  
Aim 2: With continuous input from the CAB, develop two PC interventions, PC- NMR and PC -
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_707544], for use among diverse, low-socioeconomic status community smokers in the SCCS.  
Aim 3: Conduct a 3-arm RCT to pi[INVESTIGATOR_707547]-validated smoking cessation at 6 months vs. GBC.  We hypothesize that, 
compared to GBC, PC participants will exhibit higher smoking cessation and lung cancer screening rates. (Illustration of Aim 3 is shown below on p. 8 ).  
3.0 Animal Studies and Previous Human Studies Our group has not performed prior animal or human studies related to the proposed PC interventions .

Protocol Date: 5-8-[ADDRESS_961487] be eligible (i.e., no medical 
contraindications)  to receive  at least 1 non -nicotine  FDA-approved smoking cessation medication ( i.e., 
varenicline)  and NRT . Smokers across the motivational spectrum (all levels of readiness to quit) are 
eligible.   
 
Exclusion C riteria:  Inability to give informed consent  or participate due to serious psychiatric (e.g., 
psychosis, schizophrenia , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707552] 6 months ) or cognitive 
disorder (e.g., dementia, that prevents them from completing study procedures ); enrolled or scheduled 
to be enrolled in another smoking cessation program; no access to a telephone or inabil ity to 
communicate by [CONTACT_756] ; unable to speak and read English ; history of seizures; pregnant or 
breastfeeding . 
 
5.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
For AIM [ADDRESS_961488]  information for CHC CEOs from the 
SCCS. CEOs for selected CHCs  will be mailed an introductory letter directing them to an emailed REDCap 
survey , the purpose of which is to  obtain, at the discretion  of the CEO, CHC providers’ names, credentials, and 
email addresses.  This email will be re-sent 2  times  at 2 week  interval s in order to ensure maximum response 
rates.  Using the obtained email addresses, we will email the AIM 1 provider REDCap survey, which assesses 
providers’ current tobacco treatment  practices a s well as attitudes toward personalizing smoking cessation 
treatment.  This email will be sent to non -responding providers 2 times at 2 week  interval s in order to ensure 
maximum response rates.  
 
For AIM 1 patient participants,  we will use the well -establish ed SCCS procedures for entry into, and follow -up 
within, the SCCS . Mailed packets  will include a pre -addressed and postage -paid return envelope, with only the 
SCCS participant number for identification. The packets will also contain an introductory letter describing the 
research, and  an AIM 1  questionnaire to complete.  . To ensure max imum response rate, participants will be 
mailed up to  three times;. Participants will mail back the questionnaire and , upon receipt of these items , will be 
considered  potentially  eligible for the AIM [ADDRESS_961489] an SCCS stored blood 
sample will be mailed an AIM 3 invitation letter and informed consent  with a pre-paid return envelope. These 
patients will be screened for eligibility by [CONTACT_31813] e and, for those providing verbal consent, given the AIM 3 
baseline questionnaire  by [CONTACT_648] . Upon return of the signed written consent form,  the participant ’s labs will be 
run using their stored blood . When these results  are available , participants will be  called and informed of their 
randomization assignment (PC -NMR, PC -Respi[INVESTIGATOR_707544], GBC). The baseline questionnaire for the RCT will 
contain questions on lifestyle factors, readiness to quit, and smoking patterns as described below.  Computer -
assisted telephone  interviewing will also be used for completion of study questionnaires by [CONTACT_707565]; study staff will contact [CONTACT_105] -responders by [CONTACT_335146].  
 
Eligible patients will be randomized according to a stratified permuted block randomization scheme.  
Stratification will be based on cigarettes per day. Randomization will be proceeded within strata according to a 
permuted block scheme with a block size, o r balancing interval, varying randomly between [ADDRESS_961490] smoking cessation, precision  medical care, and 
participants ’ perceptions of health risk.  This survey will be mailed  up to 3  times.

Protocol Date: 5-8-[ADDRESS_961491] quit 
attempt. All others will receive their results at the end of the study. This final results call will be offered to all 
participants  around the Month 6 follow up. . 
 
Nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) measurement  
For Aim 3, p articipants  will also undergo nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) testing of stored b iological  samples  
(blood will be used when possible and is preferred ; saliva can be used as a substitute) .  NMR testing helps to 
determine how quickly a participant’s body breaks down nicotine, which will inform his or her provider about 
whether nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or varenicline is more effective to help the participant quit 
smoking. Samples  will be securely shipped to Canada for testing . Slow metabolizers will be defined by [CONTACT_707566] <0.[ADDRESS_961492] metabolizers will be defined by a n NMR 0.316. Those in the NMR arm of the study will 
receive the results of their NMR lab test and their medication will be selected  based on their NMR status.  At 
the end of the study, those who were not in the NMR arm will receive their NMR results . This final results call 
will be offered to all participants  around the Month 6 follow up .  
 
Medication provision and blinding  
 
Guideline Based Care Group  
All participants assigned to guideline based care  (GBC) will be referred to the state quitline and will 
receive a smoking cessation intervention through the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) “Clearing the Air” 
program .  Additionally, as part of clinical care, the primary care provider (PCP)  will document  guideline -
based  treatment recommendations and provide participants  with prescriptions sufficient for a 3-month 
course of pharmacotherapy chosen at the clinical discretion of  the provider. Written and verbal 
instructions will be provided to participants given medication to contact [CONTACT_707567] (during regular business hours) to address any questions about medication.  
Participants will be instructed to call 911 if they belie ve the y are having a medical emergency.   GBC 
participants will also receive Respi[INVESTIGATOR_366903] e and nicotine metabolite ratio  (NMR) testing on their SCCS 
stored blood sample and will be informed of these results at the end of the study.  
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_707553]  (PC-Respi[INVESTIGATOR_707544])  
All participants  assigned to Respi[INVESTIGATOR_707554] -based  care, including a 
referral to the state quitline,  as described above. Additionally, the PCP  will have clinical decision 
support regarding the interpretation of the Respi[INVESTIGATOR_707555]. Study staff  will discuss results of the 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_707556] a 3 -month course of pharmacotherapy chosen at the clinical discretion of the provider  based on 
guidelines relevant to differential health risks .  
 
NMR Precis ion Care Group  (PC-NMR)  
All participants assigned to NMR precision  care will receive guideline -based care, including a referral to 
the state quitline, as described above. Additionally, the PCP  will have  clinical  decision support 
regarding the interpretation of NMR  from the study team . Using the NMR data, the PCP  will discuss 
Protocol Version  #: 5      Page 7 
Protocol Date: 5-8-2018 results with the participant and provide participants  with prescriptions sufficient for a 3 -month course of 
pharmacotherapy based on NMR res ults (NRT for “slow” metabolizers and non-nicotine smoking 
cessation medication (varenicline)  for “fast/normal” metabolizers).   Participants who do not wish to 
receive  varenicline, may have the option of a higher nicotine patch dose that has be en studied 
previously . In this previous study, t here were no significant differences between treatment arms in the 
frequency of severe side effects and serious adverse events or blood pressure during treatment (p > 
.10).22   
 
Participants may receive prescriptions through their own pharmacies  or through a mail order pharmacy . 
 
Check -in phone calls  
Study staff will call participants  at approximately 2 weeks  after the study results call, and again  approximately 
1- 2 months following the results call , to encourage medication adherence and assess  self-reported  tolerance .  
If addit ional communication is needed, a  tobacco co unselor can be available for extra call s.

Adverse drugs reactions:   Participants  in this study may receive one of two FDA-approved smoking cessation 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (NRT  or varenicline) and will have the potential to experience drug -related side effects.  Nicotine 
replacement therapy is generally very safe and several preparations of it have been sold over the counter  for 
decades ).  However, possible side effects include , but are not limited to,  skin irritation or itching (patch), 
dizziness, headache, nause a, mouth/throat irritation (inhaler/nasal spray), and rapid heartbeat .  Common side 
effects of varenicline include nausea, sleep disturbance and vivid dreams, gastrointestinal symptoms, and 
vomiting.  Very rarely, patients, particularly those with unstable  psychiatric conditions, may experience 
symptoms such as behavioral changes, agitation, depressed mood, and suicidal behavior during varenicline 
treatment.  In a large FDA -mandated trial (EAGLES, Lancet 2016)  all three of these medications were found to 
be safe and effective in patients with and without pre -existing psychiatric conditions.[ADDRESS_961494] their primary physician and the

collected data as well as assess for between -group differences  in this clinical outcome.  
 
Aim 1: Survey up to  1400 TN and MS SCCS smokers to assess attitudes and beliefs on smoking -related 
health risk perceptions, precision  smoking treatment, and willingness to engage in a smoking 
cessation trial of PC.  We anticipate a response rate of up to 70% of contact[CONTACT_707570].  
Primary Analysis:  Analysis of survey data will utilize the following general strategies: to test statistical 
differences in the frequency distributions of variables of interest, we will cal culate t -tests for continuous 
parameters of interest, and chi -square tests for categorical parameters of interest. Participants will be 
categorized according to objective and subjective classifications of smoking -related disease risks. The 
objective measur ement of lung cancer risk will be calculated using the validated PLCO M2012 model 
(Tammemagi NEJM 2013). Subjective measures of disease risks will be obtained via participant 
response to the study survey, as to whether the participant believes their risks f or heart attack, cancer 
or lung cancer are lower, about the same, or higher than other smokers their age. Pearson correlation 
coefficients will be calculated to evaluate the relation  between objective and subjective lung cancer 
risk estimates. Regression a nalyses  will be used to calculate risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals 
for the associations between objective lung cancer risk, subjective disease risks, and use of smoking 
cessation aids or interest in precision  smoking treatment. Regression statistic al models will include 
variables for potential confounders such as age, race, sex, education, alcohol intake, and family 
history of lung cancer diagnosis in a first degree  relative. P -values for trend tests will be calculated by 
[CONTACT_707571]. Potential interactions will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_707572] -product terms.

screening rates.  
Primary Analysis:  We will 
assess engagement in 
smoking cessation treatment 
as measured by: (1) 
connection with the study 
tobacco treatment counselor, 
(2) connection with the state 
quitline and ( 3) use of study -
provided medication. We will 
also obtain preliminary 
estimates o f behavior change 
at 6 months, including: 1) 
biochemically -validated 
smoking cessation and 2) 
rates of lung cancer screening 
for individuals who meet screening criteria. We will also collect information on process measures such as 
enrollment, educational m aterial format, and costs per patient treated . Note, the current pi[INVESTIGATOR_707559].

Protocol Title:  
Characterization of S elected Aerosol Constituents  Levels  in the E xhaled Breath of A dult 
e-Vapor U sers during Use of Four  e-Vapor P roducts  
Number of Study Sites:  One  site in the [LOCATION_002]  in High Point, NC . 
Study Purpose:  
In Section VI (H) (b) of the Premarket Tobacco Product Applications ( PMTAs ) for Electronic 
Nicotine Delivery Systems,11 the F ood and D rug Administration  recommends that applications 
“should provide data that adequately characterizes the likely impact of the new tobacco product 
on the health of both users and nonusers of tobacco products in order to support that marketing the new tobacco product would be a ppropriate for the protection of the public health.”  
The purpose of this study is to generate evidence for potential PMTAs for e -vapor products  to 
support a conclusion that marketing the product s would be appropriate for the protection of the 
public health.  This study will characterize the levels of selected aerosol constituents in the 
exhaled breath of e -vapor users during [ADDRESS_43751] s. 
Study Products and Administration:

Highly Confidential Page 8 Study Objectives:  
The primary objective of this study is  to estimate the change in total amount of nicotine, 
glycerin, propylene glycol, menthol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde , and acrolein  levels in exhaled 
breath samples between sham  (inactive battery and empty cartridge)  and controlled test product 
use for  four e -vapor products.  
The secondary  objective s of this study are:  
• To estimate e -liquid use by [CONTACT_41671]  
o Before and after controlled use in exhaled breath sessions  
o Before and after use during 12 hours of ad libitum use (per cartridge and in total 
over the 12 hours)  
• To estimate puff count , average puff flow rate, average puff volume  and average puff 
duration per car tridge and in total over the 12 hours  during each 12 hours of ad libitum 
use 
• To characterize responses to the Use Product Again Questionnaire after each 12 hour ad 
libitum use session  
Study Design:   
This is an open- label, [ADDRESS_43752] crossover study designed to estimate the nicotine, glycerin, 
propylene glycol, menthol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein levels in exhaled breath 
samples during use of four  MarkTen® XL e -vapor products.  The study will enroll  
approximately [ADDRESS_43753] products  
(one each day for 4 days ).  Subjects will also use their assigned test product ad libitum for [ADDRESS_43754] used per day . 
At Visit 1 ( screening), subjects (21–65 years of age) will complete vital sign assessment,  serum  
pregnancy test  (female subjects) , urine drug/alcohol screen, the Demographics  Questionnaire  
and Tobacco and Nicotine Product -Use History Q uestionnaire, blood hematology, clinical 
chemistry, urinalysis , 12 lead E CG and a physical exam .   
Approximately 32 eligible adult subjects (no more than 60% of either sex ) may enroll into the 
study.  Subjects will self -report  that they have been using EVPs “some days” or “every day” 
for the past [ADDRESS_43755] 7 days.       
• At Visit 2, upon arrival at the site, vital signs, urine pregnancy test  (female subjects) , and 
urine drug/alcohol screen will b e conducted .  After check in, subjects will engage in a 
brief product trial with each e vapor product  following an assigned schedule  (i.e., ad 
libitum use for 10 minutes) to get accustomed to using the products. Trials of each 
e-vapor product will be separated by [CONTACT_41672] 30 minutes (from the end  of each 
product trial). Subjects who react negatively (i.e., unwilling to use and/or cannot tolerate 
the product [e.g., experience adverse events (AEs) that will prevent them from

e-vapor products during the product trial will not continue in the study.  Subjects will 
abstain f rom tobacco or nicotine use overnight, and on Day 1, subjects will be randomly 
assigned to a test product use schedule ([ADDRESS_43757] per day for four days).  Subjects 
will complete an exhaled breath test product use session with their assigned test product.  
An exhaled breath test  product use session will consist of the following four sample 
collecti ons: one sample with an empty cartridge and inactive battery [sham condition] 
and one sample using the assigned test product with all exhaled breath collected in one 
type of trappi[INVESTIGATOR_7788], followed by [ADDRESS_43758] of all the exhaled breath occurring during 10 puffs, each with 
5 second puff duration, over ~ 5 minutes (one puff every 30 seconds) collected in the 
respectiv e sample collection containers:  
• Trappi[INVESTIGATOR_41649]  1: captures nicotine, glycerin, propylene glycol , and menthol  
• Trappi[INVESTIGATOR_41649]  2: captures formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein  
• Test product cartridges will be weighed before and after each collectio n.   
Upon completion of the exhaled breath product use session, the subjects will be allowed to use new cartridges with fresh ly charged  “Rev 05 batteries with topography v2” batteries  containing 
a topography recording chip ad libitum for the next [ADDRESS_43759] been validated to demonstrate no differences between the 
devices with or without the topography chip.  
Cartridges will be weighed before and after use.  
The “BVR2.3 Rev 05 battery with topogra phy v2” will record all puffs and duration of puff 
during the [ADDRESS_43760] on days 2 through 4 ([ADDRESS_43761] per day).  After each 12- hour ad 
libitum use session, subjects wil l complete the Use the Product Again Questionnaire.  
Upon completion of the ad libitum product use session on Day 4, subjects will undergo 
end-of-study assessments and be released from the site.  
Overall study time and events are listed in Table 1 .

Highly Confidential Page 18 1.0 Introduction a nd Study Rationale  
1.1 Background  
Innovative and novel tobacco- derived nicotine products like e -vapor products ( EVPs ) 
potentially offer reduced risk alternatives to adult consumers of conventional lit -end 
cigarettes .[ADDRESS_43773] risky , and non- combustible tobacco products like EVPs present 
relatively lower risks.   The Royal College of Physicians ’ new report, ‘Nicotine without  
smoke: tobacco harm reduction,[ADDRESS_43774], far fewer 
chemicals are generated from heating an e- liquid consisting of carrier ingredi ents 
(usually propylene glycol  and/or glycerol), nicotine, water , and flavors .5 The likely 
reductions in exposure due to large differences in the chemical composition of aerosols between the cigarettes and EVPs presents harm reduction opportunities for adult 
smokers switching to EVPs.   Nu Mark LLC (Nu Mark) is focused on responsibly 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_41652], such as EVPs , that may reduce 
the ri sk of tobacco -related disease.  
Altria Client Services LLC ( ALCS ) and Nu  Mark are undertak ing various studies to 
evaluate the EVPs including the MarkTen
® branded EVPs .  These studies will provide 
the scientific evidence in support of a Premarket Tobacco Product Application ( PMTA ) 
submission to the Center of Tobacco Products at the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) .  Before issuing a marketing order, the FDA must determine, based on the 
contents of the PMTA and other data a vailable to the FDA, that marketing  the new 
product that is the subject of the PMTA would be appropriate for the protection of the 
public health.  The FDA’s Draft PMTA Guidance for Electronic Nicotine Delivery 
Systems6 (ENDS ; or in other words EVPs) (Draft ENDS PMTA Guidance) suggests 
that applicants include, in addition to other information, results from studies addressing 
Altria Client Services  LLC  Issue Date: 10 February 2017  
ALCS -RA-17-06-EV  
 
 
Highly Confidential Page 19 topography and use patterns, an assessment of abuse liability , and results from human 
studies assessing biomarkers and health risks  to users and non- users of the products . 
This study will estimate the levels of selected constituents in the exhaled breath of adult 
EVP user s during use of e-vapor products .  Data from this study will be used to model 
potent ial exposure to non- users when MarkTen® XL e -vapor products are being used.   
This study is one component of a broader comprehensive framework that will provide 
the totality of evidence for the PMTA.  
The following sections  summarize  the preclinical studies on t he products proposed for 
testing in this study as well as human studies conducted on earlier versions of 
MarkTen® branded products.  
1.[ADDRESS_43775] Information  
1.2.1 Preclinical Testing and Toxicological Assessment  
Altria Client Services LLC  implements an EVP  toxicolog ical as sessment (“Product 
Stewardship ”) program based on the concept that, while the use of any tobacco product 
has an inherent risk, ingredients a nd components used in Nu Mark’s  products and any 
interaction of e -vapor device and e- liquid to form aerosols should not increase the 
inherent risk.   The toxicological assessment is based on the totality of all of the 
available scientific evidence and, when appropriate, considers the harm reduction 
potential of EVPs for ci garette smokers.  
Nu Mark uses the highest quality ingredients available, food- grade generally 
recognized as safe flavors and U nited States Pharmacopeia- grade aerosol formers 
(propylene glycol and glycerol) and nicotine.  The use levels are determined based on 
estimated consumer usages, material -specific scientific data in the literature, and 
applicable regulatory information.  
Toxicological data are already available for many individual ingredients commonly 
used in consumer products.  However, there is no toxicological data on specific product  
formulations.  Therefore , ALCS uses a weight -of-evidence approach in assessing e -
vapor ingredients and products considering the following information:  
• Individual material evaluation and  risk assessment  
Altria Client Services  LLC  Issue Date: 10 February 2017  
ALCS -RA-17-06-EV  
 
 
Highly Confidential Page 20 • Chemistry analy ses of formulations and product aerosols  
• Flavor mixtures (prototype formulations): in vivo inhalation study in rats  
• Product -specific formulation: in vitro (genot oxicity and cytotoxity) testing  
The approach is consistent with the FDA’s recommendations in the Draft ENDS PMTA 
Guidance (May 2016), for “a full assessment of the toxicological profile associated

A brief summary of in vitro assay results for the e -vapor formulas incl uded in this study 
is provided below.  
• Product XL35WM and Product X L40MB: These 3  formulations were negative 
in all 3 in vitro (Ames, NRU, and MN) assays.  
• Product XL25F and Product XL 40CB: Both formulations were n egative in Ames 
and Neutral Red Uptake assays.   In MN assay, Product XL25F formulation was 
positive and Produc t XL40CB formulation was equivocal (neither clearly 
positive nor negative as defined in the OECD487, i.e., inconclusive).  While none 
of the e -liquid ingredients in the  formulations are known mutagens or 
carcinogens, mixtures of e -liquid could potentially trigger genotoxic signals in 
cellular systems.   For pharmaceutical drug candidates, OECD guidelines 
recommend in vivo genotoxicity assays to further investigate genotoxicity 
potential detected by [CONTACT_1629] i n vitro system (OECD474 and 489).  Accordingly , 
ALCS is conducting in vivo genotoxicity testing of Product XL25F and Product XL40CB, using a conservative approach that evaluates two  independent 
endpoints (in vivo MN and in vivo Comet responses) based on the combine d 
OECD474 and 489.  Preliminary results for Product XL25F are negat ive at both 
in vivo endpoints.  R esults for Product XL40CB are pending . 
As outlined above, these  testing results need to be considered in the context of all 
available evidence.  In addition to in vitro assays, flavor mixture formulations were 
tested as aerosols via in vivo 90- day inhalation exposures in rats.  While not 
product -specific, these investigations allow holistic evaluations of respi[INVESTIGATOR_41653]: 10 February 2017

the human mode of exposure.  The results from this testing did not show a meaningful 
difference in biological endpoints between the vehicle only and the vehicle with flavor 
study groups.  In addition, Werley et al (2016) demonstrated that 90- day inhalation 
exposures from an example EVP  (MarkTen® CVR1.3) did not show meaningful 
difference in biological endpoints between the vehicle only and the vehicle with flavor 
study groups .[ADDRESS_43778] Products in this clinical study.  All four

1.2.2 Human Studies o n Previous Nu Mark E -Vapor Products  
ALCS has conducted five  in-clinic human studies  and two ambulatory studies .  These 
studies are summarized in the following three sub sections . 
[IP_ADDRESS] In-clinic Pharmacokinetic Studies  
Altria Client Services LLC  sponsored 3 pharmacokinetic ( PK) studies of EVPs  since 
2012.  The first PK study (CEL -LIQ-01-12) included 2 prototype EVPs  (CVR1.2 NS 
[PM [ZIP_CODE]- 54-B] non- menthol and CVR1.2 MS [PM [ZIP_CODE]- 57-A] menthol flavored) 
containing 2.0%  tobacco -derived NBW .  The purpose of this PK study was to 
characterize the nicotine plasma PK profile from single and multiple (1  use 
[10 inhalations] each hour over 12 hours) uses of the prototypes.  This randomized, 
single -blind, 4 -period crossover PK study was conducted in 27 (14 males, mean age 
36.3 years)  healthy adult cigarette smokers.  Subjects were instructed to use the 
prototype EVPs by [CONTACT_41678] 5 -second puffs over a 5- minute period, repeating the 
exposure every hour for 12 hours.  Six subjects (25%) experienced 11 mild adverse 
events (AEs) on the day they were using the CVR1.[ADDRESS_43780], and 7 subjects (29%) 
reported [ADDRESS_43781] common AE 
was throat irritation (4 subjects), followed by [CONTACT_41679] (2 subjects) and nausea 
(2 subjects).

Highly Confidential Page 23 The second PK study (CEL -LIQ-01-13) included 2 prototype e -cigarette products 
(CVR1.3 NB3 [[ZIP_CODE]- 126-NB3%] containing 3.0%  tobacco -derived NBW  and 
CVR1.3 NB5 [[ZIP_CODE]- 126-NB5%] containing 5.0 % tobacco -derived NBW ).  Twelve 
adult smokers (6 males ) participated in the study.  For each product, the subjects took 
ten 5-second inhalations within a 5- minute peri od, and repeated the product use epi[INVESTIGATOR_41654] 1-hour intervals for a total of [ADDRESS_43782] reported 6 AEs 
(including dry lip, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness) following the use of the CVR1.[ADDRESS_43783], and 3 subjects experienced 15  AEs (including nausea, vomiting, feeling 
hot, burning sensation, dizziness, nervousness , and hiccups) following the use of the 
CVR1.[ADDRESS_43784] PK study (ALCS -E45-01-14) included 4 prototype EVPs  containing 2.5% to 
4.5% tobacco- derived NBW .  The purpose of the PK study was to characterize the 
nicotine plasma PK profile fr om single and m ultiple (1  use each hour over 10 hours) 
uses of the prototypes.  Adult subjects were instructed to use the prototype EVPs  by 
[CONTACT_41680] 10 puffs over a 10- minute period, repeating  the exposure every hour for 
10 hours.  Five (21%) of the [ADDRESS_43785] common AE (11 events in 
2 subjects) was t hroat irritation, followed by 1 AE each of dry throat, headache , and 
dizziness.  
[IP_ADDRESS] In-clinic Topography Studies  
Altria Client Ser vices LLC  has also sponsored [ADDRESS_43786] 
study (CRT -LIQ-01-13) evaluate d puffing topography measurements in subjects using 
a prototype EVP , CVR1.3 (PM -[ZIP_CODE]- 87A).  Thirteen  (6 males) adult cigarette 
smokers and 10 (4 males) adult e-vapor users were enrolled in this study.  Subjects 
were provided 2 cartridges (2 .0% tobacco -derived NBW ) for ad libitum use over a 7 -
hour period.  Twelve (6 males) of the 13 cigarette smokers returned to the study site 
for additional puff measurements using 4 prototypes (2.0% tobacco -derived NBW ).  
The subje cts were instructed to take ten  5-second puffs over  a 5-minute period.  The 
subjects repeated thi s puff regimen 6  times a day (3  times per prototype) on 2 separate 
days.  One reported AE of headache (mild) was considered possibly related to study 
product.

Highly Confidential Page 24 The second puff topography study (ALCS -M10- 05-14) evaluated puffing topography 
measurements in [ADDRESS_43787] users: adult smokers, adult 
smokers and e -vapor users (dual users) , and adult exclusive e- vapor users.  During the 
study, subjects used CVR1.5 EVPs  (2.5% tobacco- derived NBW  in both Menthol and 
Classic flavors) ad libitum over 8 consecutive hours.  Ninety -one generally healthy 
adult subjects (48 males) were enrolled , and 89 subjects completed the study.   On 
average, subjects used approximately 2.9 CVR1.5 e -vapor cartridges over the 8  hours , 
and no AE s were reported. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ambulatory Studies  
In addition, ALCS sponsored an a mbulatory vapi[INVESTIGATOR_41655] (COV -M10- 01-14) 
in 2014.  One hundred forty -eight (70 males) healthy adult smokers were enrolled in 
the randomized control study.  One hundred and three (48 males) subjects were allowed 
to smoke their own brand conventional cigarettes and use an e -vapor CVR1.5 
(1.5%  tobacco -derived NBW , either Classic or Menthol flavored) product ad libitum 
and 45 (22  males) subjects smoked their conventional cigarettes ad libitum without 
using EVPs  for [ADDRESS_43788] Products  by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigators  
([ADDRESS_43789] infection, 1 t hroat i rritation , and 1 headache).   
Altria Client Services LLC  also sponsored an ambulatory tobacco product use study 
(ALCS -M10- 02-14).  Two hundred twenty -six (104 males) adult cigarette smokers 
were randomized into 5  groups investigating the use of cigarettes with the use of 
CVR1.5 EVPs  (1.5% tobacco- derived NBW  in Classic [C15] or Menthol [M15] flavor 
and 2.5%  tobacco -derived NBW  in Classic [C25] or Ment hol [M25] flavor ) for 
3 weeks.  Two groups were instructed to us e their own brand cigarettes and CVR1.5 
EVPs  (n=51, C15/M15; n=49, C25/M25) ad libitum and [ADDRESS_43790] 1 CVR1.5 e -vapor cartridge per 
day ( n=52, C15/M15; n=49, C25/M25).  The control gr oup (n=25) continued to smoke 
their own brand cigarettes ad libitum.   A total of 26 subjects (11.5% of  enrolled 
subjects) reported [ADDRESS_43791] -randomization AEs ( [ADDRESS_43792] -randomization serious AE 
[SAE ] occurred in the control group and was not related to Test Pr oduct).  In the 
201 subjects randomized to CVR1.5 EVP  use groups, 15 mild or moderate AEs from 
9 subjects (4%  of CVR1.5 e -vapor use groups) were considered as unlikely, possibly ,

discomfort (2 subjects;  1% of the CVR1.5 e -vapor use groups).  
1.2.3 Consumer Response  Center Data  
Adverse events (AE) related to the use of Nu Mark’s e -vapor 
products  (MarkTen®) have been spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_41681],  "Consumer Response  Center", since August 2013.  While ALCS 
continuously monitors and evaluat es these AEs, no investigation is conducted to verify 
these health -related complaints associated with the use of  MarkTen® e-vapor 
products  (appro ximately  59.6 million  cartridges  sold).  As  of December  31, 2016, 
there were 645 consumers who reported 1,206 AEs using the MedDRA Preferred 
Terms (PT). The top ten PTs were:  thermal burns (11.19%), burns second degree 
(9.12%), throat irritation (5.22%), cough (5.06%), oral discomfort (4.89%), nausea (4.31%), headache (4.06%), burns first degree (3.98%), electric shock (2.74%), and 
dizziness (2.24%).  There were four consumers who reported AEs that met the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 criteria for “Severe”.  The 
“Severe” PTs were:  eye swelling, swelling face, swollen tongue, facial paralysis,  
cough, haematemesis, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_41656], gastrointestinal injury,  
aphonia,  and  thermal burn, with two consumers  being  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  The majority 
(79.44%) of the AEs reported to the Consumer Response Center were classified as “Mild”.     
Based on the information presented, it is anticipated that the four EVPs  in this study 
will be well tolerated.  
  
Altria Client Services  LLC  Issue Date: [ADDRESS_43795] Warnings  
The adult subjects will be informed that the EVPs  used in this research bear the 
following warning:  
WARNING:  This product is not a smoking- cessation product and has not been 
tested as such. This product is intended for use by [CONTACT_41682], 
and not by [CONTACT_7683], women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or persons with or at risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or taking medicine for 
depression or asthma. Nicotine is addictive and habit forming, and it is very toxic 
by [CONTACT_12699], in contact [CONTACT_8124], or if swallowed. Nicotine can increase your 
heart rate and blood pressure and cause dizziness, nausea, and stomach pain. 
Inhalation of this product may aggravate existing respi[INVESTIGATOR_14437]. 
Ingestion of the nonvaporized concentrated ingredients in the cartridges can be 
poisonous.  
For products sold in the State of [LOCATION_004], t he following warning will be present at 
points of sale:  
CA Proposition 65 WARNING : This product can expose you to chemicals 
including glycidol, which is known to the State of [LOCATION_004] to cause 
cancer, and nicotine, which is known to the State of [LOCATION_004] to cause 
birth defects or other reproductive harm.  For more information , go to 
www.P65Warnings.ca.gov. 
Glycidol is detected in the aerosols generated from ALCS’s  products.  International 
Agency for Research on Cancer  has classified glycidol as “probabl y carcinogenic to 
humans (Group 2A)”  
(http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/latest_classif.php ).  ALCS’s  scientific 
test data , however , show that the anticipated human exposures are substantially below 
the established regulatory limits 
(https://www.osha.gov/dts/chemicalsampling/data/CH_243700.html ). 
In summary, as stated in section 1.2.1, based on the totality of evidence including the individual material assessment, literature review, and collective in vitro and in vivo 
testing, we believe there is no concern for use of the t est products in this clinical study.  
All four formulations being used in this study are currently available in the commercial 
market (since [ADDRESS_43796] 2016).

Highly Confidential Page 27 1.3 Study Purpo se 
In Section VI( H)(b) of the P MTAs  for E NDS ,11 the FDA recommends  that applications  
“should provide data that adequately characterizes the likely impact of the new tobacco 
product on the health of both users and nonusers of tobacco produc ts in order to support 
that marketing the new tobacco product would be appropriate for the protection of the 
public health.”  
The purpose of this study  is to generate evidenc e for potential PMTAs for  e-vapor 
products  to support a conclusion that marketing the product s would be appropriate for 
the protection of the public health.  The study will characterize the levels of selected 
aerosol constituents in the exhaled br eath of e vapor users during [ADDRESS_43797] products . 
2.0 Study Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to estimate the change in total amount of nicotine, 
glycerin, propylene glycol, menthol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein levels in exhaled breath samples between sham  (inactive battery and empty cartridge)  and 
controlled test product use for four e -vapor products .  
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives  of this study are:  
• To estimate e -liquid use by [CONTACT_41671]  
• Before and after controlled use  in exhaled breath session s  
• Before and after  use during 12 hours of ad libitum use  (per cartridge and in 
total over  the 12 hours ) 
• To estimate puff count , average puff flow rate, average puff volume  and average 
puff duration per cartridge  and in total over the 12 hours  during each 12 hours of 
ad libi tum use  
• To characterize responses to the Use Product A gain Questionnaire  after each 
12-hour ad libitum use session 
Altria Client Services  LLC  Issue Date: [ADDRESS_43798] crossover study  designe d to estimate the nicotine, glycerin, 
propylene glycol, menthol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein levels in exhaled 
breath samples during use of four  MarkTen® XL e -vapor products.  The study will 
enroll  approximately [ADDRESS_43799] products  (one each day for 4 days ).  Subjects will also use their 
assigned test product ad libitum for [ADDRESS_43800] used per day . 
At Visit 1 (screening), subjects (21 –65 years of age) will complete vital sign 
assessment, serum  pregnancy test  (female subjects) , urine drug/alcohol screen, the 
Demographics  Questionnaire  and Tobacco and Nicotine Product -Use History 
Questionnaire, blood hematology , clinical chemistry, urinalysis , a 12 lead E CG and 
complete a physical exam .   
Approximately 32 eligible subjects (no more than 60% of either sex ) may enroll into 
the study.  Subjects will self -report that they have been using e -vapor products (EVPs) 
“som e days” or “every day” for the past [ADDRESS_43801] 7 days.       
• At Visit 2, upon arrival at the site, vital signs, urine pregnancy test (female 
subjects) , and urine drug/alcohol screen  will be conducted.   After check in, 
subjects will engage in a brief product trial with each e vapor product  following 
an assigned schedule  (i.e., ad libitum use for 10 minutes) to get accustomed to 
using the products. Trials of each e -vapor product will be separated by 
[CONTACT_3450] 30 minut es (from the end  of each product trial). Subjects who react 
negatively (i.e., unwilling to use and/or cannot tolerate the product [e.g., 
experience adverse events (AEs) that will prevent them from continuing to use 
the product as judged by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator ]) to any of the Nu Mark e -vapor 
products during the product trial will not continue in the study.  Subjects will 
abstain from tobacco or nicotine use overnight, and on Day 1, subjects will be 
randomly assigned to a test product use schedule ([ADDRESS_43802] Produc t per day for four

8.1 Adverse Events  
The following is the definition  of an AE : 
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
findinga), symptom, or diseaseb temporally associated with the use of a 
study product, whether or not  related to the study product.12,[ADDRESS_43849] meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
Surgical pr ocedures themselves are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for 
conditions that require surgery.  The condition for which the surgery is required may 
be an AE.  
No causal relationship with the study products or with the clinical study itself is implied by [CONTACT_3794] “adverse event .” 
Altria Client Services  LLC  Issue Date: 10 February 2017  
ALCS -RA-17-06-EV  
 
 
Highly Confidential Page 51 The i nvestigator will review each event and rate each reported sign or symptom on a 
3-point severity scale. The following definitions for rating severity13 will be used: 
Mild : The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with daily activity.  
Moderate:  The AE interferes with daily activity, but the subject is still able to 
function. 
Severe:  The AE is incapacitating and requires medical intervention. Note: This is 
not the same as “serious,” which is based on the outcome or action criteria 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to life or functioning.  
Each AE will also be  assessed by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator for relationship to study product 
(causality) using the following grades of certainty14,15 (the strength of a causal 
association may be revised as more information becomes available):  
Not related :  Clearly and definitely due to extraneous cause ( eg, disease, 
environment).  
Unlikely :  a. Does not follow a probable temporal ( ie, time) sequence from use 
of study product.  
b. Does not follow a known pattern of response to the study product.  
c. Could plausibly have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state/underlying disease or other drugs or chemicals the subject 
received.  
d. Does not reappear or wors en when the study product is 
re-administered.  
Possible : a. Follows a reasonable temporal ( ie, time) sequence from use of 
study product.  
b. Follows a known pattern of response to the study product. 
c. Could also have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical 
state/concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals the subject received.  
Likely :  a. Follows a reasonable temporal ( ie, time) sequence from use of 
study product.  
Altria Client Services  LLC  Issue Date: [ADDRESS_43850]’s clinical 
state/concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
d. Follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal 
(dechallenge) (ie, disappears or decreases when the study produc t 
is stopped or reduced) . 
e. Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
Definitely : a. Follows a reasonable temporal ( ie, time) sequence from use of

8.2 Serious Adverse Events  
The following is the definition for  an SAE.  
An SAE is any adverse study experience that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse study experience
a 
• in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacityb 
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 13

Highly Confidential Page 53 a “Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of 
the SAE; it does not refer to an  SAE that hypothetically might have caused death if 
it were more severe.  
b “Persistent or significant disability/incapacity” means that there is a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions . 
An important medical event that may or may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a n SAE when, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. An example is allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home.

DO NOT cut and paste technical abstracts from funding applications that may not be understood by a general
audience.
The purpose of this study is to use an innovative, noninvasive imaging technique called optical coherence tomography
(OCT) to visualize micropore closure in racial/ethnic skin following micropatch application. Healthy and consenting
adult volunteers (18-45 years old) will be enrolled. Subjects will be asked to self-identify their race and ethnicity
according to the following groups: Black, Asian, Latinx, White, Indigenous, or Bi-/multi-racial/other. All subjects,regardless of self-identiﬁed race/ethnicity, will receive the same micropatch treatment and measurements. The
micropatches are patches containing a small array of microneedles on an adhesive patch backing; the whole micropatch
ﬁts on the tip of a thumb. The micropatches will be applied to the upper arm, forearm, and the palm. At each of these
locations, 3 sites will be identiﬁed. One site will receive micropatch application followed by [CONTACT_509557] a small patch
(note: this is just a band-aid like patch, not a micropatch). The other 2 sites will be controls: one site will be treated with a
micropatch but will not be covered afterwards, and the other site will be an occlusion control site (covered with an
occlusive patch but no micropatch application). Noninvasive measurements will be made at baseline to determine
differences in hydration, skin water loss, electrical resistance (impedance), and color between subject groups. OCT  scans
will be made on the skin to noninvasively visualize the skin structure, allowing calculations of epi[INVESTIGATOR_509542] . After the micropatch is applied to one site at each of the [ADDRESS_658750]
images will give us an innovative and complementary method for visually conﬁrming the impedance calculations.
I.5 Specify your research question(s), study aims or hypotheses (do not indicate "see protocol")
This study aims to visualize micropores and measure micropore closure rates following micropatch application at 3
anatomical sites in subjects from dif ferent racial/ethnic groups. Another study aim is to quantify dif ferences in skin
structure and blood ﬂow using OCT  imaging. We hypothesize that OCT  images of micropores in the skin will provide a
complementary approach to calculating micropore lifetime, when combined with impedance calculations.
I.6 Background and signiﬁcance and/or Preliminary studies related to this project.
(do not  indicate "see protocol")
TThe skin serves an integral role in protecting the body from harmful environmental stressors. Much of the skin’ s barrier
capabilities can be attributed to the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]. Although the stratum corneum
is beneﬁcial in protecting against absorption of foreign compounds and excessive loss of water , it is an obstacle for most
transdermal drug delivery methods. Transdermal delivery allows a drug to reach the systemic blood supply while
avoiding common obstacles such as ﬁrst pass hepatic metabolism and inconsistent plasma concentrations [1]. Other
beneﬁts of transdermal delivery include improved patient compliance, and pain-free delivery [2]. However , few drugs
can be transdermally delivered because of strict physicochemical properties required for skin permeation, including
molecular weight in Daltons or octanol-water partition coefﬁcient [3]. One way to aid transdermal delivery is through
microneedles, which by[CONTACT_509558].
Microneedles are micron-scale projections that form transient micropores in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]. When using solid
microneedles, the micropores are created from the initial insertion of the microneedles, but then the microneedles are
discarded and do not remain in the skin for any period of time. For this type of microneedle technique, the ability of the
micropores to remain open is crucial for ef fective drug delivery (in a drug delivery study , a medication patch would be
applied over the newly-created micropores). There have been some studies quantifying micropore lifetime in human
subjects, though the populations studied have been very homogenous and do not represent the full range of skin types
that might beneﬁt from microneedle-assisted drug delivery . There has been a lack of studies studying micropore closure
kinetics among dif ferent racial/ethnic skin types. There is also contradicting evidence that other variables, such as
transepi[INVESTIGATOR_7044] (TEWL), skin elasticity , and epi[INVESTIGATOR_509543], vary among dif ferent skin types
as well [4-5]. More research is necessary to better understand this area, and this can be achieved using new imaging
methods such as dynamic optical coherence tomography (OCT).
OCT  is a noninvasive and nondestructive technique that is already recognized as a powerful medical imaging technique
in the ﬁeld of ophthalmology , in which it is used for imaging the retina. It is a real time, in-vivo technique that has also
been used for skin imaging. The instrument uses an echo technique for image collection that is similar in concept to
ultrasound, with the exceptions that OCT  uses light waves (instead of sound waves) and provides better resolution. OCT
allows for noninvasive observation of the skin in a vertical plane up to a depth of ~1 mm, capturing two and three-
dimensional images [6]. This allows for visualization of multiple skin structures such as the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], dermis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_509544], and hair follicles. Dynamic OCT  allows for the visualization of the microvasculature, along with the skin
structures. Previous studies have successfully utilized OCT  to image polymeric microneedles in the skin [7-8]. However ,
OCT  has not been used to visualize the micropores formed from metal microneedles, which is the primary focus of the
work in our lab group. To date, there are also no studies using OCT  to study the microvasculature dif ferences among
different racial/ethnic skin types.
In our research program we recently demonstrated that epi[INVESTIGATOR_509545] [9]. We also demonstrated that the use of tristimulus colorimetry as a quantitative
measurement of skin color is a better indicator of skin variability than race self-reported by [CONTACT_1766]. Using OCT  to
visualize the skin structures will provide a visual, complementary conﬁrmation of these ﬁndings that will augment the
impedance calculations that we use as a surrogate measure to determine how long the micropores remain open.
In the current study we will use dynamic OCT  and other noninvasive measurements of epi[INVESTIGATOR_509546] a population of healthy human subjects with racial/ethnic skin.

Describe the steps that will be taken by [CONTACT_509568]ﬂuence
during the consent process
Participants in this study will be normal healthy individuals aged 18-45. All participants will act as their own controls.
This study will be advertised through the University of Iowa campus-wide email system and through the University of Iowa
Health Care “Noon News,” a daily announcement ﬂier for community and faculty members within the UIHC. Advertisements
for this study have been created so that speciﬁc subject populations may be better reached via tar geted advertisements, in order
to meet our enrollment goals. (attached docs: 202010229_MassEmail_v1; 202010229_NoonNews_v1)
Prospective participants may be pre-screened through a telephone survey or a survey link created by [CONTACT_509569] a data
collection tool called RedCap. Individuals who view our advertisements and contact [CONTACT_509570] (attached document) 202010229_telephoneinformationscript_v1 and will be asked if they
would like to answer some pre-screening questions to help determine their eligibility (attached document
202010229_PreScreeningQuestionnaire). Individuals who view the advertisements and complete the pre-screening
questionnaire via RedCap (link https://redcap.icts.uiowa.edu/redcap/surveys/?s=9PW7TDTDXF) will have their answers
reviewed by [CONTACT_3476]. All individuals will be provided with a copy of the consent summary document
202010229_GeneralConsentSumary_v1. If clariﬁcation is needed for answers provided, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_509571] (phone or email) by [CONTACT_8362]. Once it is determined that a subject is
potentially eligible to participate in the study they will receive an email from the study team with a link to electronic consent
(attached document: 202010229_EmailforSurvey_eligible_v1). If individuals who completed the electronic pre-screening
survey have been found to be ineligible to sign the consent document they will receive an email thanking them for their time
(attached document: 202010229_EmailforSurvey_Ineligible_v1). This pre-screening process has been created because the
number of potentially eligible participants is quite high, since we are seeking normal, healthy individuals aged 18-45. This
process helps us to avoid having many people sign the consent form and then become a screen failure. Questions are brief and
are all yes/no answers. No identifying information is obtained during the pre-screening process besides for name [CONTACT_3669]
[CONTACT_3031].
If a subject is interested in study participation and passes the pre-screening survey , they will be invited to sign an informed
consent document (where they will again be provided an overview of the study rationale, procedures, risks, and beneﬁts).
Consent will be obtained either electronically or in person depending on the preference of the individual. An informed consent
document will be provided to the subject for review prior to any meeting. This ensures that the individual has the chance to
review the material in the informed consent on their own time.
Pre-screening for this study will be streamlined with the use of a survey created by [CONTACT_5051] (link provided above).
The link to this survey will be sent to potential subjects via the Noon News and Mass Email. Participants who complete the
survey will provide their email address or phone number , and the study team will contact [CONTACT_509572]. The
information provided by [CONTACT_509573] . All personal information collected for purposes of
this study will be collected directly from the individual.
It is recognized that the consent process must be carried out in an environment where no coercion is applied and where subjects
can be adequately informed of the purpose, nature, procedures, risks and hazards of the study . One of the important features of
our screening process is the ability for the prospective participant to review the informed consent on his/her own time, outside
of the study site. This additionally demonstrates the reliability of the subject if they schedule a follow-up meeting to sign the
informed consent.
Subjects participating in this study have the option to ﬁll out an electronic consent via REDcap (attached doc:
202010229_RedCap_eConsent_v1)(link: https://redcap.icts.uiowa.edu/redcap/surveys/?s=4296PfQrjT). Subject's electing this
option will be ﬁrst complete a pre-screening survey . Upon completion and review subject's will be sent a copy of the informed
consent document via email for their review as well as a link to complete the electronic consent document (contained in
attached document: 202010229_emailforsuvey_eligible_v1). To ensure that the subject understands the consent document a
series of questions will be asked prior to them being allowed to sign the consent document. These questions are:
True or false: This study visits will be performed at the University of Iowa College of Pharmacy Building (correct answer:
True)
True or false: Return visits are scheduled 48 hours apart. (Correct answer: False, visits are scheduled 24 hours apart)
True or false: This study involves the topi[INVESTIGATOR_509553]. (Correct answer:
False, this study contains no drug administration of any kind).
If subject's correctly answer these questions they will be permitted to ﬁll out the electronic consent and will then be directed to
complete the screening questionnaire survey on REDcap as well (see attached doc 202010229_RedCap_ConsentScreening_v1)

DESCRIBE:
What subjects will be asked to do/what happens in the study (in sequential order)
The time period over which procedures will occur
The time commitment for the subject for individual visits/procedures
Long-term followup and how it occurs
Following consent, the subject will ﬁll out a questionnaire collecting information about demographic information age,
race/ethnicity , sex assigned at birth, current medications and ongoing medical conditions. The subject will be asked to elaborate
on the duration and severity of medical conditions and any treatments received. No medical records will be consulted to obtain
or conﬁrm this information. A member of the research team will use this information to screen out subjects meeting any of the
exclusion criteria deﬁned in VI.13. Subjects who pass the screening may proceed to the next step described below . Subjects
should allow for both in person and electronic consent and screening procedures to take approximately 1 hour; whenever
possible, if in person, this will be done on the same day as when the subject starts the study procedures.
On Day 0 (may be the same day as consent is obtained), the subject will sit in the study room at the College of Pharmacy for [ADDRESS_658794]’ s skin to acclimate to the ambient environment in the study room
(temperature, humidity). During this [ADDRESS_658795] from participant research procedures will continue as planned. (This procedure will be followed as do to
scheduling constraints it is possible that some time has passed from when the subject consented to when they are scheduled to
complete their study procedures. Verifying this information will help us determine if their original answers remain accurate and
their eligibility remains.) If participants answers indicate that they are actually ineligible to continue their participation no
further procedure will take place and the subject will be removed from the study . Following this acclimation, the researcher will
identify and mark with a pen 3 sites each on the upper arm, forearm, and the palm. Hair may be clipped (but not shaved) at any
sites if necessary . Noninvasive baseline measurements will be taken at each of the 9 sites as follows:
• Transepi[INVESTIGATOR_7044] (TEWL) will be measured by [CONTACT_91239] a probe gently against the skin. This measurement will take 1-
3 minutes at each site. (TEWL  will only be measured on Day 0)
• Electrical resistance (impedance) will be measured with an impedance meter by [CONTACT_509575] a
reference electrode at a nearby [CONTACT_3725]. The measurement will be repeated 3 times at each site, and will take less than 2 minutes
total at each site.
• Skin color and redness will be measured by [CONTACT_1299] a colorimetry probe gently against each site. This measurement will take
less than 30 seconds at each site.
• Dynamic-OCT  will be used to obtain an image of the skin by [CONTACT_101939] a probe lightly on the skin. This measurement will take
about 30 seconds at each site. Microvasculature density , epi[INVESTIGATOR_78065], and epi[INVESTIGATOR_509554] a single scan.
Following baseline measurements on Day 0, micropatches (an adhesive microneedle patch) will be applied to two of the three
identiﬁed sites at each anatomical location. The sites will ﬁrst be cleansed with an alcohol swab. A sterilized micropatch
containing [ADDRESS_658796]  and impedance measurements will be repeated. One of the micropatch sites at each location will be
covered with a sterile occlusive covering following micropatch application; this will be secured to the skin using medical tape
such as Tegaderm or Bioclusive tape. The second micropatch application site at each location will not be covered. The third site
at each location will not receive micropatch application, but will simply be covered with an occlusive covering. This serves as a
control for the ef fect of occlusion alone on normal skin. Day [ADDRESS_658797] been completed. Procedures on days 1 and 2 will require approximately 2 – 2.5 hrs.
On Day 2 (the ﬁnal day), the occlusive coverings will be removed and not replaced. Within 3-6 days after the Day 2 visit (or the
last completed visit if a participant decides to drop out early) a study team member will contact [CONTACT_509576]. No long-term follow-up
will be necessary . The overall time commitment for this study is 7 - 10 hours in one week, across 3 – 4 study days if consent is
obtained on a dif ferent day than the study start day .
To summarize, the 9 sites will receive the following measurements and treatments:
Palm: sites 1 – 3
Site 1: Micropatch application + occlusive covering
Site 2: Micropatch application, no occlusive covering
Site 3: Occlusive covering, no micropatch application
Forearm: sites 4 – 6
Site 4: Micropatch application + occlusive covering
Site 5: Micropatch application, no occlusive covering
Site 6: Occlusive covering, no micropatch application
Upper arm: sites 7 – 9
Site 7: Micropatch application + occlusive covering
Site 8: Micropatch application, no occlusive covering
Site 9: Occlusive covering, no micropatch application
Measurements of TEWL, Dynamic-OCT , colorimetry , and impedance will be made at baseline (Day 0) for all sites. TEWL,
Dynamic-OCT , and impedance measurements will be repeated immediately after micropatch application. Dynamic-OCT  and
impedance measurements will be measured at all sites on days [ADDRESS_658798] to follow-up?
No - those lost to followup will not be recontact[CONTACT_39289].E.9 Will subjects be provided any compensation for participating in this study?

VIII. Risks
VIII.1 What are the risks to subjects including
- emotional or psychological
- ﬁnancial
- legal or social
- physical?
In general, micropatch treatments are well tolerated. However , the skin could become irritated or inﬂamed from the
microneedle insertion or from the adhesives (either on the micropatches, the impedance electrodes used to make measurements,
or the medical tape used to hold the occlusive patches in place). There may be mild discomfort, itching, redness, bruising,
inﬂammation, or hyper -/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and infection at the treatment sites or where adhesives were in contact [CONTACT_8124].
Loss of conﬁdentiality is also a risk.
VIII.[ADDRESS_658802] you done to minimize the risks?
If applicable to this study ALSO include:
How you (members of your research team at Iowa) will monitor the safety of individual subjects.
Include a description of the availability of medical or psychological resources that subjects might require as a
consequence of participating in this research and how referral will occur if necessary (e.g. availability of
emergency medical care, psychological counseling, etc.)
During the consent process the subjects will be counseled about the micropatch. The skin will be cleansed thoroughly with
alcohol wipes prior to applying the micropatch treatments (cleaning technique similar to that used for insertion of a typi[INVESTIGATOR_509555]). They will also be counseled about the possibility of local skin irritation and redness from the adhesive
tape. Subjects will be closely observed during the measurements and during treatment with the micropatches. Subjects will be
instructed to contact a member of the study team if problems arise at any time during their participation in the study (all
pertinent contact [CONTACT_509577]). Within [ADDRESS_658803] an individual or committee review combined data from all subjects on a periodic basis
(such as summary or aggregate safety and/or efﬁcacy data)?
No
IX. Beneﬁts
IX.[ADDRESS_658804] (do not include compensation or hypothesized results)?
There are no direct beneﬁts to the subjects.
IX.[ADDRESS_658805]?
Microneedle assisted transdermal delivery shows promise as an alternative to hypodermic needles. While there are increasing
numbers of studies involving microneedles, dif ferences in micropore closure kinetics among racial/ethnic groups are lacking. In
addition, the use of OCT  as a noninvasive skin imaging technique to view the micropores in the skin shows promise but has not
been studied in dif ferent racial/ethnic groups.
X. Privacy & Conﬁdentiality
X.[ADDRESS_658806] the privacy  interests of the subjects?
No direct patient identiﬁers will be recorded on data collection material. Instead, subjects will be assigned a subject number on
study materials. Only the data necessary to answer the research questions will be collected, and all in person consent processes
and study procedures will take place in a private location in the College of Pharmacy building.
X.2 Are you collecting the Social Security Number of any subjects for any purpose?
Yes
X.3 Provide the intended usage of SSN:
To provide compensation to subjects
X.4 How will information/data be collected and stored for this study (check all that apply):
Paper/hard copy records (hard copy surveys, questionnaires, case report forms, pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], etc.) - Paper/hard copy
documents will only be transported, transferred, and stored by [CONTACT_38991]. These document will be stored in a
secure ﬁling cabinet in a locked ofﬁce in the College of Pharmacy ofﬁce 558. This ofﬁce is shared with people outside of

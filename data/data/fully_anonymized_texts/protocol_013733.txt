4. ESTIMATED DURATION OF THE STUDY  
The study is anticipated to start by [CONTACT_11711] 1 , 2015 and end January 1 , 201 8 for duration of 3 years. The recruitment phase 
will begin as soon as IRB approval is received.  
5. LAY LANGUAGE SUMMARY OR SYNOPSIS (no more than on e paragraph)  
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis and liver -related mortality in p ersons 
who drink little or no alcohol. NAFLD is defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis with no evidence of hepatocellular 
injury in the form of ballooning of the hepatocytes. NASH is defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis and inflammation 
with hepatocyte injury (ballooning) with or without fibrosis. NASH is benign in many affected individuals but can cause 
progressive liver injury and, indeed, may be the major cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis1. A subset of patients with NAFLD 
that have not been ex tensively studied are those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Among patients with 
HIV infection, liver disease is one of the leading causes of death.[ADDRESS_751836] been investigated. In this study, we propose to treat 50 patients with 
HIV-associated NAFLD  with either aramchol  or placebo f or 12 weeks. After an initial eva luation , MRI liver fat distribution  
and full body DEXA  scan,  patients will receive 600 mg of Aramchol  ( a 200 mg/tablet and a 400 mg tablet ) per day  or 
placebo. Patients will be monitored at regular intervals for symptoms o f liver disease, side effects of aramchol , and serum 
biochemical and metabolic indices.  Patients will also be assessed for continued HIV viral load suppression and continued 
tolerance of antiretroviral therapy.  At the end of 12weeks, patients will have a repeat medical evaluation, liver MRI and 
full body DEXA scan . Pre and post treatment  MRI -derived liver fat content and DEXA -full body fat measurement will be 
compared. The primary end point of successful therapy will be improvement in hepatic steatosis mea sured by [CONTACT_572679] -associated NAFLD . Secondary end points will be impr ovement in total body fat content assessed by 
[CONTACT_572680] -associated NAFLD.

Page [ADDRESS_751837] 30% of adults in Western co untries.1-3 With climbing obesity rates and more sedentary patient populations, 
the prevalence of NAFLD is increasing worldwide and is becoming the predominant cause of chronic liver disease in 
parts of the world.4 NAFLD represents a spectrum of dis eases ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of fatty liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis and liver -related mortality in 
persons who drink little or no alcohol. NASH represents the more severe end of  this spectrum and is characterized by 
[CONTACT_492951], ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis.5 Long -term risks of NASH include 
cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and end stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation.6, 7  
The majority of patients with NAFLD are asymptomatic. Clinical history, laboratory and radiological 
investigations are useful in excluding other causes of liver disease but do not permit an accurate diagnosis of NAFLD.8 
The diagnosis is usually suspected in a patient with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) who drinks no or 
minimal amounts of alcohol, who has evidence of increased fat in the liver by [CONTACT_2207], CT scan or MRI, and wh o tests 
negative for the common causes of chronic liver disease.  Liver biopsy is the gold standard for the accurate diagnosis of 
NAFLD, but inherent risks of biopsy such as pain, bleeding, and bacteremia make interval biopsies impractical in the 
managemen t of this disease.  
Recently, innovative imaging tools have demonstrated potential to change how we study and monitor liver 
disease.9, 10 An advanced magnetic resonance imaging based biomarker, the proton -density fa t fraction (MRI -PDFF), has 
been validated as a precise and accurate method of quantifying liver fat in NAFLD.11-[ADDRESS_751838] not been extensively studied are those infected with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Among patients with HIV infection, liver disease is one of the leading causes of death.16 
Progression of liver disease in HIV is linked to metabolic derangements associated with hepatic steatosis. Till date there 
are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_572659] -associated NAFLD and this area remains understudied with paucity of  clinical 
trials.  
Medical Therapy for NAFLD in HIV patients:  
Currently, there is no FDA approved treatment for NAFLD or NASH. Additionally, there have been no significant 
clinical trials for HIV patients with NAFLD and there are no approved treatment optio ns. Current treatments for NAFLD 
are limited to weight loss and exercise, but this is often difficult to adhere to for many patients. Therapeutic agents are b eing 
investigated but the trials thus far including ursodeoxycholic acid, metformin, clofibrate, b etaine, N -acetylcystine, 
atorvastatin, and orlistat have demonstrated very limited benefit. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_572660]. Additionally, none o f these trials 
were for HIV -infected patients. Further therapi[INVESTIGATOR_572661].  
Aramchol:  
Aramchol, also known as arachidyl amido cholanoic acid,  is a fatty acid bile acid conjugate (FABAC) that was 
created by [CONTACT_29499]  2 natural components, cholic acid and arachidic acid, through a stable amide bond. Aramchol inhibits 
stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1), a key enzyme in fatty acid synthesis. SCD1 is an endoplasmic reticulum enzyme 
that catalyzes the rate -limiting st ep in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids.  Inhibiting 
SCD1 decreases synthesis and increases beta -oxidation of fatty acids, causing decreased storage of fatty acids. SCD1 has 
been demonstrated to be tightly associate d with control of lipid homeostasis and body weight regulation. Within in vitro 
models, Aramchol has demonstrated significant (70% to 83%) inhibition of the SCD1 activity.[ADDRESS_751839] in animal models with increased fecal sterol output and decreased plasma 
cholesterol levels in mice.18  
Aramchol and the liver:  
The three proposed mechanisms of Aramchol’s effects on liver fat are 1) reducing de novo fatty acid synthesis, 2) 
reducing SCD1 activity, and 3) increasing beta -oxidation of fatty acids.19 In a 2003 study by [CONTACT_572682] ,20 Aramchol significantly 
reduced hepatic fat content in animals (rats, hamsters, and mice) with a high -fat diet model.  These animals gained total 
weight alt hough they had less fat deposition in their liver, measured histologically, which suggests a redistribution of fat 
deposition in the body. The authors hypothesized that redistribution of liver fat to adipose tissue was the most likely 
explanation, but the mechanism was unknown.

Page [ADDRESS_751840] of Aramchol on NAFLD and total body fat:  
A recent study by [CONTACT_572683]24 demonstrated that aramchol significantly reduced liver fat content, measured by 
[CONTACT_572684] (MRS), in [ADDRESS_751841] patients either 100mg or 300mg of aramchol or placebo (3 groups; n = 20/group) once daily for 12 weeks. Their 
primary finding was that liver fat content decreased by 12.57% (+/ - 22.14% standard deviation) in the high dose aramchol 
group. There were no serious or drug -related adverse events in  the study and the authors proposed that aramchol might be 
used for the treatment of fatty liver disease. In the preceding Phase I study of aramchol, dosing up to 900mg was studied 
and found to have a good safety profile.  An international, multicenter tri al is currently being conducted using a two doses 
of Aramchol , a 200 mg/tablet and a 400 mg tablet per day  given the excellent safety profile and expectation of increased 
liver fat reduction at higher doses.  Aramchol has not yet been studied in HIV -assoc iated NAFLD.  
 
Side effects of Aramchol:  
Patient trials with Aramchol are limited to the Safadi study,24 but the clinical trial demonstrated no significant adverse 
events in the 12 -week treatment period for 58 patients that underwent the trial. The few adverse events were mild 
(abdominal pain, back pain, constipation) and did not cause anyone to drop out of the trial. There were no severe adverse 
effects.  Aramchol does not induce or inh ibit the CYP450 enzyme family and is not expected to have significant drug 
interaction.  The previous studies on Aramchol were done in animal models.  
 
Aims and Significance:  
We plan to investigate the role of aramchol  in patients with HIV-associated NAFLD  residing in the [LOCATION_002] and assess 
liver fat changes during therapy with MRI of the live r. Here we hypothesize that aramchol would lead to a greater 
improve ment in liver fat content compared with placebo and may lead to greater improvement in total body fat content 
assessed by [CONTACT_572685] t o placebo. In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we propose to randomize approximately 50 patients 
(1:1 ratio) to 600 mg of  Aramchol (a 200 mg/tablet and a 400 mg tablet ) per day  or placebo over 12-weeks in order to 
evaluate changes in baseline  laboratory data,  total body fat content assessed by [CONTACT_112592],  and li ver fat by [CONTACT_572686].

9. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
We plan to conduct a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled clinical trial to examine the efficacy of aramchol 600 
mg daily (including 200 mg tablet and 400 mg tablet) versus identical placebo  given over 12 weeks to improve HIV- 
associated hepatic steatosis as measured by a validated and accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -based technique.  
Galmed will not rece ive any subject or study data.  
 
Initial Evaluation  
Patients will be initially screened in the UCSD NAFLD research center clinic with history, physical examination, review 
of outside medical records (including HIV status) and routine blood tests. Alcohol hi story will be assessed in the medical 
interview, and the lifetime alcohol consumption will be estimated by [CONTACT_398294]. All patients  will be asked 
to stop any medication s being used for their liver disease, including herbal medications and vitamins.  Only those meeting 
all inclusion criteria and avoiding all exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study. After the initial vis it, those 
who meet all eligibility criteria and have no exclusion criteria will undergo more thorough  evaluation with liver MRI , 
cardiac MRI , Ultrasound transient elastography with CAP  and DEXA scan for total body fat. Patients with MRI -PDFF > 
5% will be invited to participate in the study.  Total screening time will be approximately 3 hours (2 hour s scree n visit, 10 
minute s ARFI, 6-10 minute s DEXA scan, 30 minute s MR scan , 5 minutes Ultrasound transient elastography with CAP ), 
[ADDRESS_751842] already been completed elsewhere as part of the 
patient’s original diagnostic evaluation at the referring clinic they do not need to be repeated.  
The following evaluation will be done shortly before starting therapy.  
1. History and physical examination.  
2. Blood tests. These include complete blood count (CB C with differential and platelet count), prothrombin time,  INR,  
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), direct and total serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, 
albumin, total protein, fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, C -reactive protein (CRP), creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), 
lactic acid , sodium, chloride, potassium, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, calcium, phosphorus, 
ferritin, antinuclear antibody, antimitochondrial, antibodies if indicated,  thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), HBsAg, anti 
HBs, anti HAV, anti HCV, ceruloplasmin, alpha -1-antitrypsin  if indicated , hemochromatosis ge ne test (HFE test) if 
indicated, alfa feto protein, fasting insulin, , Elisa HIV test  if indicated , CD4 T-count, HIV PCR , CK-[ADDRESS_751843] (OGTT): after an overnight fast, subjects will be given [ADDRESS_751844].  
5. Estimation of body fat and fat distribution  
    a.Body Mass Index (BMI): For each patient, weight (kg) and height (m) will be recorded with  empty bowel and bladder. 
BMI is calculated by [CONTACT_6388]: BMI = weight (kg)/ height (m)2.  
    b. A trained investigator will measure waist/hip ratio at the same time as other measures are taken.  
    c. DEXA scan for whole body fat  
    d. Magnetic resona nce imaging (MRI) of the liver:  MRI is done to evaluate liver size and estimate liver fat content.  
    e. MR Elastography (MRE) of the liver: MRE will be done to evaluate changes in liver stiffness before and after therapy 
if additional funding is availab le. 
    f. Cardiac MRI scan: will be done to assess improvement in cardiovascular risk by [CONTACT_572687].  
    j. Ultrasound transient elastography with CAP  of the liver:  Ultrasound transient elastography with CAP  is a noninvasive 
test used to  asses liver stiffness.  
6. ARFI ultrasound measurements are made automatically by [CONTACT_572688] S2000 
ultrasound machine by [CONTACT_38716]. An ARFI ultrasound imaging examination of the abdomen w ill be performed.  ARFI 
ultrasound imaging examinations will be performed without contrast agents by [CONTACT_10070] -trained staff and lasts about 10 minutes 
long. ARFI measurements are made automatically by [CONTACT_572688] S2000 ultra sound 
machine we will use.  
 
Treatment Phase:  
After the initial evaluation, patients who continue to fulfill all inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive 600 mg daily  
of Aramchol  (including 200 mg tablet and 400 mg tablet) versus identical placebo  orally for a total of [ADDRESS_751845] blood draw at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 of treatment.  In addition, an ARFI 
ultrasound imaging examination of the abdomen will be performed. At each visit particular attention will be paid to symptoms 
associated with the possible side effects of Aramchol and patients will complete a standardized symptom scale . 
 
Labs to be checked during the treatment phase include:  
1. Urinalysis will be done with extended blood tests.  
2. Routine blood tests (Fasting specimens): CD4 counts,  HIV PCR , Complete metabolic panel (CMP) and prot hrombin /INR. 
In addition, research blood  will be taken for cytokine levels and changes in lipid biomarkers.  
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 5 3. Extended blood tests (Fasting specimens):  Insulin, plasma glucose, lipid profile (cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL and HDL), 
free fatty acids (FFA), and creatinephosphokinase (CPK),  lactic acid , and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c).  In addition, 
research blood will be taken for cytokine levels and changes in lipid biomarkers.  
4. Stool and urine sample will be collected for analysis of changes related to the study drug.    
5. If the subjec t consents to genetic blood sampling the specimen will be drawn at this time.   
 
Post-Treatment Phase:  
At the end of the study, patients will undergo the same evaluation as listed under the initial evaluation as above, following  
which treatment will be sto pped. Repeat MRI of the liver, ultrasound  transient elastography with CAP  of the liver  and full 
body DEXA scan will also be performed at study conclusion. It is not possible to predict the outcome of this study, but if 
aramchol appears to have a significan t effect on liver fat by [CONTACT_51010] /or total body fat by , we will probably develop a follow -
up protocol to assess long -term therapy with aramchol in a large multicenter study to examine the efficacy in improving liver 
histology .  Total post treatment visit ti me will be approximately 3hours  (30 minut es MR scan,  20 minutes cardiac MRI scan,  
5 minutes ultrasound transient elastography with CAP , and 10 minutes DEXA scan ).  
 
From screening to finish, total amount of time required of a patient will be approximately 6-7 hours ([ADDRESS_751846]-treatment visit) .   
 
Stored specimen:  
The specimens (serum, plas ma, urine, saliva, whole blood (DNA), PBMCs , and stool ) collected as part of this study will 
be kept at CTF building A. The purpose of this collection is to analyze inflammatory markers associated with treatment 
response in patients with  HIV-associated  NAF LD and to elucidate the mechanism of action of aramchol in the treatment of 
HIV-associated NAFLD . These samples and data may be stored indefinitely. At the end of the study, the data collected will 
be maintained at NARF building GI offices in a locked comp uter file with access available to the principal and study 
investigators only.  
 
All samples and data will be labeled with a code number. The name, address, social security number, date of birth and other 
personal identifiers will not be available on the sa mple, and we will not give out any information that identifies the patient 
to the researchers who use these samples and data.  Samples may be given to other researchers for collaborative research 
only if said researchers have proof of IRB approval for use o f stored samples.

Annual follow up visits : 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 6 Patients will be offered annual follow up visits if they choose to attend. At the annual follow up visit, subjects will under go 
a detailed history and physical examination. Standardized questionnaires Skinner Lifetime Drinking History in addition to 
the Al cohol Use Disorders Identification Tests (AUDIT) will be used. A urine pregnancy test will be performed for all 
women of childbearing age.  Women who have had hysterectomies are excluded from pregnancy testing.  If the pregnancy 
test is positive, the patie nt will not be enrolled in the study. The patient will undergo  full body DEXA scan , magnetic 
resonance elastography, and a magnetic resonance imaging for liver stiffness calculation and hepatic fat fraction, 
respectively.  
 
Assessment of Response and Statis tical Analyses:  
The primary outcome of this study will be improvement in hepatic steatosis by [CONTACT_572689]. Statistical analyses will 
compare liver fat improvement between the treatments versus placebo -arms. It is not possible to predict what the 
spontaneous or therapeutic response rate will be. Thus, we predict that the spontaneous improvement rate would be zero 
to less than 1%.   The sample size is chosen to avoid exposure of a large number of patients to [ADDRESS_751847] a power 90% (or higher) with a β of 0.05. We 
expect that Aramchol therapy group would have at least 6% reduction in liver fat compared to baseline as compared to 
1% or less improvement in the placebo group. These estimates are also based upon our recent trial using MRI -PDFF as an 
accurate and reproducible marker of hepatic steatosis.[ADDRESS_751848] had variable dropout rates.  Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_572662] 9% dropouts, and 
all remaining patients underwent follow up evaluation and liver biopsy. In the randomized -controlled trial of col esevelam 
versus placebo, we had a 10% drop rate. Therefore, we expect less than a 10% drop out. Dropouts would be considered 
non-responders based upon intention to treat analysis. A modified intention to treat analysis will be done in which we will 
exclude  the patients who dropped out before getting the week 12 exit evaluation.  
Secondary outcomes will be assessed comparing pre -treatment to 12-weeks outcomes on therapy using parametric or non -
parametric tests as indicated.  The major secondary outcomes to be  evaluated are:  
1. Total body fat via DEXA scan  
2. Serum ALT and AST values.  
3. Lipid profiles.  
We will compare the changes in the mean difference in the MRI -PDFF determined fat fraction between the treatment arm 
and the placebo arm at the co -localized region of in terest. A two -tailed t -test would be utilized to compare the differences 
between the two groups. A two -tailed p -value of less than 0.[ADDRESS_751849] 
segment -to-segment changes in liver fat before and after t reatment. We may perform internal validation by [CONTACT_572690] -
PDFF with magnetic resonance spectroscopy between the two treatment arms in selected cases.

 Patient would be given information regarding possible studies in HIV-associated NAFLD in liver clinic by [CONTACT_572696]. We would ask the patient to call or email the PI [INVESTIGATOR_572668], if they are 
interested.  
 In addition, potential subjects will also be recruited by [CONTACT_572697].  Volunteers who appear to be a good match for the 
study will receive study announcement material that excludes any direct study contact [CONTACT_3031] (email/phone). Contact 
[CONTACT_572698]. Patients who are interested in the 
study can call our office to speak to the study team to find out more information about the study.   
 
12. INFORMED CONSENT  
Adult consents have been uploaded to the UCSD HRPP web site for approval.  Subjects will be provided consent either by 
[CONTACT_572699] d 
to contact [CONTACT_572700].  All signed consents will be maintained in ma rked binders, secured in 
locked filing cabinets within private administrative offices at UCSD Medical Center, Hillcrest. Offices are accessible to 
study staff only.    
Sub Investigator [CONTACT_572717]  is fluent in Spanish.  She will be the one  to explai n the study to participants that prefer 
Spanish or are Spanish speaking only.  
 
There is a separate optional component of the study where subjects will be asked to donate a blood sample for genetic 
research.  Subjects will be offered the opportunity to revi ew, discuss and sign the consent at their scheduled visit.  All 
questions will be answered at this time and throughout the study.  Declining to give a genetic sample does not prohibit the 
participant from participating in the study.  
 
13. ALTERNATIVES TO S TUDY PARTICIPATION  
Currently there are no FDA approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_266247]-associated NAFLD . The alternative to study participation is not to 
participate in this study.  
 
14. POTENTIAL RISKS  
The risks and discomforts of frequent phlebotomy : To document cha nges in levels of biochemical markers of liver disease 
and to monitor the metabolic effects and toxicities of aramchol , frequent blood sampling will be required. Patients will have 
4 venipunctures during the treatment period of the study.  Each venipunctur e will remove 15 to 50 ml of blood. However, 
no more than 1.5 ml/kg will be drawn from any one person during a four -week period.  Blood collection by [CONTACT_572701], and the possibility of localized bruising, phlebitis, or extravasation. The risk of infection 
or fainting is extremely small.  
 
The risks and discomforts of HIV testing :  Patients will sign a standard consent for HIV testing for this study.  
Risks and discomforts of Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ): There will b e two OGTT’s during this protocol, one at the 
beginning and one after [ADDRESS_751852] will be 100 to 120 ml. No more than 6 ml/kg of blood will be drawn 
from any one person during a four -week period  
 
The risks  and discomforts of other tests:  
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_751853] been reported to be well tolerated by [CONTACT_1962]. (14)   
However, the vibrating paddle could be uncomfortable to some subjects, and so subjects will be instructed to tell the MR 
technologist if the vibrations become uncomfortable, and the MRE part of the examination will be discontinued.  
c. Cardiac MRI (without co ntrast) . Patients will undergo two Cardiac MRI examinations during this study. Each session 
will be completed within 20 minutes. While serial MRI scanning is thought to be safe, the procedure may cause anxiety in 
some patients since current equipment used at the Clinical Center uses a closed tube. Patients will be offered sedatives such 
as Valium if they express worry about being in a closed space.  
d. The ARFI ultrasound imaging method to be used for this study is investigational, and is considered to be of  minimal (i.e., 
non-significant) risk. This investigational imaging method has the same safety precautions built into it as the ones that are 
used clinically, and so the method we will use is considered by [CONTACT_572702] y as the 
sequences that are approved by [CONTACT_88670]. As per 63 FR 216: [ZIP_CODE] -[ZIP_CODE], ultrasound is considered a 
(Category 4) minimal risk procedure because it involves the “c ollection of data through non -invasive procedures (not 
involving genera l anesthesia or sedation) routinely employed in clinical practice, excluding procedures involving x -rays or 
microwaves ...”, for which “examples include … ultrasound …”.  
The conventional ultrasound imaging that will be performed in this study is the same a s is used clinically. When it is used 
clinically it is FDA approved; however, for the purposes of this research study it will be considered to be investigational 
and not FDA approved since we are using it for research. Possible effects of ultrasound imagin g on nursing mothers have 
not been examined. Therefore, nursing mothers will be excluded.  
e. Reproductive risks:  
Although ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are routinely performed in pregnancy in clinical practice. We will 
take a conservative appro ach as potential effects of ultrasound and MRI imaging on human embryonic or fetal development 
may not have been examined. Therefore, women of childbearing potential, including those who have had a tubal ligation, 
will be required to take a urine pregnancy  test and have negative results before enrolling into study.  
f. Unforeseeable risks : 
Although serious injury to organs or death have never been attributed to ultrasound imaging or MRI, it is possible that 
currently unforeseen side effects, including seriou s injury to organs or death may occur. Also, because this is an 
investigational study, there may be some other unknown risks that are currently unforeseeable. The subject will be informed 
of any significant new findings.  
g. Dual energy x -ray absorptiometry  (DEXA) body composition assessment will be obtained using the Hologic Discovery 
W densitometer with APEX software (Hologic, Inc.,  Bedford, MA ).  The DEXA system s assess body composition by 
[CONTACT_572703] x -ray at two frequencies to separate tissue into fat, lean, and bone mineral.  A whole 
body composition DEXA scan last approximately 6 minutes and the radiation dose is 9 mrem (0. 09 mSv)  for two DEXA 
scan, one at screening and one at the post treatment phase.   
h. Ultrasound transi ent elastography with CAP  is a noninvasive  procedure to measure liver density. There are no known 
direct risks from the Ultrasound transient elastography with CAP  medical device which uses ultrasound waves. However, 
you may feel minor discomfort or minor s oreness over the area where the ultrasound probe contacts the abdomen. There is 
a small risk of allergic reaction to the gel used during the procedure. Ultrasound gel is water -based. There is no radiation 
exposure and the CAP measure is simply an additiona l calculation.  
 
Side effects due to Aramchol : Patient trials with Aramchol are limited to the Safadi study24, but the clinical trial 
demonstrated no significant adverse events in the 12 -week treatment period for 58 patients that unde rwent the trial. The 
few adverse events were mild (a bdominal pain, back pain, constipation) and did not cause anyone to drop out of the trial. 
There were no severe adverse effects. The previous studies were done in animal models. Due to the paucity of clin ical 
trials to evaluate side effects of Aramchol, we  will encourage patients to notify staff of any adverse reactions and we will 
monitor patients via physical exams and laboratory testing at regular intervals to ensure patient safety.  
Dosage modification  and discontinuation of Aramchol:  patients will be monitored for side effects and the toxicity will be 
ranked as Grades 1 to 4.  We will use the common toxicity criteria (CTC), version 4.0, for scoring adverse events during 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_751854] are 
modified slight ly from the CTC version 4. 0 because these factors are likely to be abnormal before therapy in patients with 
chronic liver disease.   An adverse event is defined as any adverse change from the patient’s baseline (pre -treatment) 
condition. These include curr ent illness during the cou rse of the study, regardless of the illness being considered unrelated 
to treatment. Patients will also be monitored closely for antiretroviral therapy tolerance and continued virologic 
suppression of HIV .  
 Dose modification of Aramchol : If any grade 2 adv erse events (anemia, elevated serum CPK, hypoglycemia, 
decrease in serum bicarbonate, elevation in liver transaminases, elevation in bilirubin, anorexia, nausea, diarrhea) 
occur and persist on repeat testing for one week, Aramchol will be reduced 600 mg da ily (including 200 mg tablet 
and 400 mg tablet) versus identical placebo  to [ADDRESS_751855] is not believed to be due to Aramchol, the drug will be restarted at the 
dose of 600 mg daily (including 200 mg tablet and 400 mg tablet) versus identical placebo . If the adverse event 
recurs or persists for 2 weeks despi[INVESTIGATOR_264265], Aramchol will be stopped.  
 Discontinuation of Aramchol : In this study, discontinuation of Aramchol will be based upon the scoring of 
adverse events as shown in the table below. Factors that will lead to discontinuation of Aramchol include 
pregnancy, any one of the grade 3 or 4 adverse events or any adverse event, which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_144086], places the patient at increased risk. Factors specific to the HIV population which will lead to 
discontinuation of aramchol will include: development of HIV viremia, decrease in CD4 T -cell count below 200, 
any evidence of increased antiretro viral toxicity (lactic acidosis, as well as grade 3 or 4 myalgia, CPK elevation 
or LFT abnormalities), and any aramchol related side effects that interfere with adherence to antiretroviral 
therapy.  Aramchol will not be restarted unless another cause for t he abnormality or symptom is found.

Potential Loss of Confidentiality:  All means will be employed to ens ure that there is not a loss of confidentiality. Although 
study material will be kept private and inside a locked cabinet there is a slight possibility that a breach of confidentialit y 
may occur. A special code de -identifying the research subject from the data and specimens collected will be assigned to all 
research subjects and their study material. Only the P.I.  and their research team will be able to link the research subject to 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 14 the assigned code. It still may be possible, but highly unlikely, that the i nformation in the research records could become 
known outside of the research setting.  
 
15. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND ADEQUACY OF RESOURCES  
Data and Safety Monitoring:  
The principal  investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_572672]. These meetings are separate from regular clinical rounds and consist of review of all study patients including 
flow sheets of major safety and efficacy measurements.  The rationale for not using an outside dat a and safety monitoring 
committee is that this is a small, single center study using a FDA approved medication that has been associated with few 
severe side effects.  All measurements and tests are well established in clinical medicine.  Yearly reports are  made to the 
UCSD IRB regarding safety and efficacy.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
All serious adverse events will be reported to the UCSD IRB and Galmed  within 7 days.  Unexpected and related fatal or 
life-threatening events will be reported within 48 hours an d reports will be sent to the FDA, MEDWATCH program 
(telephone 1 -800-FDA -1088; or via the Internet at www.fda.gov/medwatch/index.html ) and Galmed Pharmaceutical .  
 
Informed Consents  
All consents will b e stored in well -marked binders in locked file cabinets located in private offices at UCSD Medical center. 
Databases with identifying information will be secure as they will be password protected and encrypted.  Staff will be 
trained in HIP AA guidelines an d confidentiality issues.  
 
Patient Privacy : To help us protect the privacy of the research subjects, we have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality 
from the National Institutes of Health, which will allow us to resist any demands for health information,  with a few 
exceptions as explained below. The Certificate protects us from being forced to disclose information that may identify 
research subjects, even if by a court subpoena. We are also protected from demands for information made by [CONTACT_1032], state, 
local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other sources. However, the Certificate cannot be used to resist a deman d 
from the U.S. Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects or for information that must 
be dis closed in order to meet the requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  All data and study forms will be 
in secured locations (locked room or cabinet) and access is limited to study personnel.  Subject names are not used; instead 
a name [CONTACT_474922].  Release of data to persons or organizations outside study personnel will require 
written consent of the subject.  
 
MRI Findings:  Liver MRI (Fat fraction) sequence  and Cardiac MRI (without contrast) do not provide detailed informat ion 
regarding other organs within the abdomen cavity and is mainly dedicated to the liver  or cardiovascular region . However, 
if there are any unexpected findings on the liver MRI  and/or Cardiac MRI , we would utilize following protocol to safeguard 
patient interest. A trained radiologist will read all MRI images . All abnormal findings will be communicated to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_572673]. [CONTACT_572718] (PI) is a gastroenterologist and a transplant hepatologist at UCSD and routinely provides 
consultation to other se rvices regarding abnormal imaging findings and is therefore, well versed  with the management of 
these findings. He would clinically correlate the significance of any unexpected MRI findings. These findings will be 
discussed with the patient by [CONTACT_572705] a follow -up plan will be established and documented. If the patient 
desires, this information will be released to the referring physician or any provider or entity that the patient would like u s 
to send the information. PI [INVESTIGATOR_572674] -up. These abnormal findings would be systematically recorded and reported at yearly 
renewals and in the final manuscript.  
16. PRIVACY AND CONF IDENTIALITY CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING DATA ACCESS AND 
MANAGEMENT  
All study data will be kept confidential. No publication or written reports will link subject data with a name [CONTACT_572716]. Protected health information wil l not be re -used or disclosed for other purposes. Computer 
data file entry and access will require a password.  
Research subjects will have control over access to themselves (privacy) and how study data will be managed and used 
(confidentiality).  
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_751859] with subjects that may occur by [CONTACT_572706] ( [ADDRESS_751860]) 
where we have adequate de dicated space – a separated waiting room and a private examination room, each with doors that 
close. Subjects will also have access to, and will use a private bathroom / changing room to change into and out of a gown.  
Confidentiality  will be assured by [CONTACT_572707] o f medical records and imaging studies only by [CONTACT_572708]. Captured information will be stored in 
a de-identified form. Data will be accessed at workst ations at require secure login and password access, in the CTF building. 
Research records with personal health information will be kept in locking file cabinets in rooms that are locked after hours 
and which are only accessible to authorized personnel duri ng working hours. The [ADDRESS_751861]’s liver disease may improve because of treatment with the study drug. However, the research subject 
may receive no benefit. The research subject may help future patients by [CONTACT_572709]-associated NAFLD. The research subject may benefit from health information obtained during the 
physical exams, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. At the research subject’s direction, we will provide the result s 
of any procedures done to screen him/ her for this study to their liver care provider.  
 
18. RISK/BENEFIT RATIO  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_572675] a favorable risk/benefit ratio as risks associated with treatment with Aramchol, data 
collection and confidentiality does not outweigh potential be nefits to the discovery of potential treatments for HIV -
associated NAFLD. There are currently no approved treatments for NAFLD/NASH. Data collection and blood draws are 
procedures being performed as outlined in the study protocol and all efforts will be ma de to minimize any risk to the 
research subject.  Staff will have HIPAA certification training.  
 
19. EXPENSE TO PARTICIPANT  
There is no expense to the research subjects.  
 
20. COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION  
Participants  will be paid $25 each at t he firs t visit and at weeks 4 and 8. $[ADDRESS_751862] udy at week 12.

30. PROCEDURES FOR SURROGATE CONSENT AND/OR DECISIONAL CAPACITY ASSESSMENT  
Subject must be able to consent to the study. Based upon past experience, we expect that th e population of patients we 
will be including in this protocol will be competent to give informed consent. If the investigator feels that the decision -
making capacity to consent to be a part of this study is insufficient, then a post -consent quiz will be a dministered after the 
consent form has been explained to the subject. The post consent quiz will be submitted to HRPP for review. If the 
subject is unable to answer any of the questions in the post -consent quiz, any information not clearly understood from the 
consent form will be repeated or explained in greater detail. If there is any concern by [CONTACT_458938] a potential 
research participant has a condition or circumstance that is associated with a possible decrease in decision -making 
capacity, that  subject will not be included in the  study.

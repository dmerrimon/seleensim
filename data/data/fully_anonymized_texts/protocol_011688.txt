Phase III – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page 7 of 321 Introduction
1.1 Overview
Imaging and staging of prostate cancer is critical for surgical and treatment planning.  We aim to 
image patients with suspected metastatic prostate cancer using Gallium-68 labeled HBED-CC 
PSMA (more commonly called 68Ga-PSMA-11) in order to demonstrate its utility.   We plan to 
utilize this data to obtain further approvals of the 68Ga-PSMA-[ADDRESS_423622] commonly diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of cancer 
death in American men (1).   Existing conventional imaging (CT, MRI and bone scans) has a 
low sensitivity in detecting local recurrence or metastatic disease (2).  The one exception being 
NaF PET/CT for the detection of osseous metastasis.  Due to this limitation, numerous 
approaches to stage patients have been evaluated.
Choline imaging has been frequently  used, as prostate cancer exhibits increase choline uptake 
that has been associated with the presence of choline kinase (3).  Choline uptake is increased 
in comparison to FDG in both androgen dependent and independent prostate cancer patients 
(4).  Choline has also been shown to be sensitive for the detection of recurrent tumor in patients 
with PSA (prostate specific antigen) values of less than 1.0 ng/ml (5).  There are two forms of 
choline that are used in imaging prostate cancer, C-[ADDRESS_423623] better detection rates for distant metastatic disease (6).  C-11 choline has limited 
sensitivity for osseous metastasis, possibly due to the decreased uptake time (7).  Additionally, 
the sensitivity of C-11 choline is limited in patients with PSA values < 1.0 ng/ml (8-10).  Although 
choline PET may be limited in sensitivity, it clearly delineates more lesions than cross section 
imaging or bone scan in patients with known disease (11).   In 2012, the Mayo Clinic obtained 
NDA (new drug application) approval from the FDA for the use of C-11 choline.  
A separate approach is to  image the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA).  PSMA is 
expressed on the majority of prostate cancer cells, and so would be an ideal cell membrane 
protein to image.  The initial imaging approach to PSMA imaging target the intracellular domain 
using Indium-111-capromab (Prostascint), a murine monoclonal antibody (12,13).  Although 
there was early promise for the detection of nodal metastasis (14), the agent was never able to 
adequately visualize osseous metastasis (15).  Although combination with SPECT/CT does 
improve lesion detection (16).  One main limitation to In-111-capromab is that it takes a 
prolonged time to localize to the target tissue, which likely relates to both the size of the 
monoclonal antibody and the fact that agent targets the intracellular domain of the PSMA 
protein. Additionally, Prostascint also recognizes an intracellular epi[INVESTIGATOR_342061]: 2017.08.22 Protocol CC#: 
Phase III – 68Ga-PSMA-[ADDRESS_423624] demonstrates that PSMA-11 has a higher sensitivity for the detection 
of disease than F-18 choline in a head-to-head intra-patient comparison that included 37 
patients (17).  The second paper looked at the sensitivity of PSMA-11 in the detection of 
metastatic lesions in patients with recurrent prostate cancer (18).  Their results demonstrated a 
detection rate of 50% for patients with a PSA less than 1 ng/ml, and detection rate above 85% 
for patients with a PSA greater than 2 ng/ml.  These detection rates are significantly higher than 
that reported by [CONTACT_40605] (5).
Because of the  improved resolution and image quality with PET, ability to quantitate uptake, 
increased sensitivity compared to choline, we intend to evaluate the utility of Ga-[ADDRESS_423625] that the data from this study will support 
applications for clinical approval of this imaging agent, leading to wider availability within the 
[LOCATION_002].

Appendix 3.  Additionally within [ADDRESS_423628] survey will be filled out.
[IP_ADDRESS] PET imaging
a)68Ga-PSMA-11 PET
 preparation  and injection:  
The intravenously injected dose will  be 111-259 MBq (3-7 mCi) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET.  
A dose of 20 mg of furosemide (Lasix) is recommended to be injected i.v. together with, 
shortly before or after administration of the radiotracer in order to minimize PET scatter 
artifacts from excreted radiotracer accumulation in the kidney and urinary bladder that 
can occur with the gallium-68 radionuclide.  Oral hydration is recommended on the day 
of the scan. Voiding is recommended immediately before start of the scan.  Furosemide 
should not be administered in patients with medical contraindications to Furosemide 
administration including allergies and adverse reactions including sulfa allergies.  (Note: 
Application of Furosemide can be omitted as part of the PET imaging protocol if a 
second-generation scatter correction algorithm is available for the PET scanner used in 
this protocol).    PET imaging will begin 50-100 minutes after injection.  Scan time per 
bed position will be determined based on each sites PET scanner capabilities. 
b) Patient preparation: no fasting is required.
c) PET protocol:
 Scan  coverage will extend from mid thigh to the base of the skull, starting 
from the mid-thighs to prevent urinary bladder radiotracer accumulation at the start of 
PET imaging.  Bed position scan time will be dependent on each sites scanner 
capabilities.  At a minimum, [ADDRESS_423629] may be administered if 
requested by [CONTACT_342067].

7 Reporting and Documentation of Results
7.1 Evaluation of Side Effects
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions
Evaluable for toxicity
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of 68Ga-PSMA-11.
7.2 Evaluation of Safety
Analyses will be performed for  all patients receiving 68Ga-PSMA-11.  The study will use the 
CTCAE v4.0  for reporting  of adverse events.
7.3 Definitions of  Adverse Events
7.3.1 Adverse Event
An
 adverse event (also known  as an adverse experience) is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug 
related.  More specifically, an adverse event  (can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
drug, without any judgment about causality.  An adverse event can arise from any use of the 
drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
7.3.2 Adverse reaction
An
 adverse reaction is defined  as any adverse event caused by [CONTACT_2224] a drug.  Adverse 
reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude 
that the drug caused the event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Suspected 
A 
suspected adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” indicates that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than an adverse reaction.
Version date: 2017.08.22 Protocol CC#: 
Phase III – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page 14 of [IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected 
An adverse event or suspected  adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or package insert(s), or is not listed at the specificity or severity that 
has been observed, or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent 
with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application. 
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or 
as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.
Adverse events that  would be anticipated to occur as part of the disease process are 
considered unexpected for the purposes of reporting because they would not be listed in the 
investigator brochure.  For example, a certain number of non-acute deaths in a cancer trial 
would be anticipated as an outcome of the underlying disease, but such deaths would generally 
not be listed as a suspected adverse reaction in the investigator brochure.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious
An adverse event or suspected  adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
Death
Life-threatening adverse event
Inpatient
 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869]
A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life 
function
Congenital anomaly/birth  defect
Important medical events  that may not result in death, are life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.
[IP_ADDRESS] Life-threatening
An adverse event or suspected  adverse reaction is considered life-threatening if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk 
of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
7.4 Recording of an Adverse Event
All grade 3 and above adverse events will be recorded using the NCI CTCAE v4.0.   The 
Investigator 
will assign attribution of the possible association of the event with use of the 
investigational drug.

Expedited Reporting to the Food  and Drug Administration
Version date: 2017.08.22 Protocol CC#: 
Phase III – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page 16 of 32If the study is being conducted under an IND, the Sponsor-Investigator is responsible for 
determining 
whether or not the suspected adverse reaction meets the criteria for expedited 
reporting in accordance with Federal Regulations (21 CFR §312.32). 
The Investigator must  report in an IND safety report any suspected adverse reaction that is both 
serious and unexpected.  The Sponsor-Investigator needs to ensure that the event meets all 
three definitions: 
Suspected adverse  reaction (as defined in 6.1.30)
Unexpected (as defined  in 0)
Serious (as defined  in 6.1.5)
If the adverse event does not meet all three of the definitions, it should not be submitted as an 
expedited 
IND safety report.
The timeline for  submitting an IND safety report to FDA is no later than 15 calendar days after 
the Investigator determines that the suspected adverse reaction qualifies for reporting (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1)). 
Any unexpected fatal  or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction will be reported to FDA no 
later than 7 calendar days after the Investigator’s initial receipt of the information (21 CFR

Randomization
There will be no randomization performed.  
8.1.2 Blinding
For
 primary endpoint analysis of 68Ga-PSMA-[ADDRESS_423637] or MRI used for attenuation purposes.
For local interpretation of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET imaging studies, local readers will be 
unblinded to both clinical information and other conventional imaging data.
For local interpretation of conventional imaging follow-up images 3-[ADDRESS_423638] 68Ga-
PSMA-11 
PET scan, local readers will be unblinded to all results and will be specifically 
informed of the location of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET positive lesions so that follow-up 
measurements may be performed on these lesions.

Phase III – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page 17 of 328.2 Determination of Sample Size and Accrual Rate
8.2.1 Sample Size and Power Estimate
The primary endpoint is to evaluate the sensitivity on a (1) per-patient and (2) per-region-basis 
(prostate bed, pelvis, extrapelvic soft tissue, and bone metastases) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for 
detection of tumor location confirmed by [CONTACT_26745]/biopsy. Based on our first protocol in 
biochemical recurrent patients, we have updated the distribution of disease that we expect the 
find:
a) Prostate bed:  15%
b) Pelvis: 27%
c) Extrapelvic
 soft tissue:  24%
d) Bone metastases: 11%
e)
No evidence of disease on PSMA PET: 24%
Of 
our first cohort of patients, 19% of patients underwent biopsy after a positive PSMA PET 
imaging.  
Based on biopsy results there was 100% sensitivity and 87% specificity.  There were 
no True Negatives or False Negatives on biopsy.  Imaging follow-up is not complete for our first 
study so we cannot estimate the percent of patients that will have imaging follow-up, but it 
appears that roughly 15 to 20% of patients will have imaging follow-up.  Consistent with our 
second protocol, we anticipated that the sensitivity for the four regions and for all regions 
combined using conventional imaging ranges from 30-60%. An overall sensitivity for 68Ga-
PSMA-[ADDRESS_423639] 50% will be considered as unacceptably low. Hence, the null 
hypothesis that the sensitivity is at most 50% will be tested against the alternative hypothesis 
that the sensitivity is greater than 50%. It is hypothesized that 68Ga-PSMA-[ADDRESS_423640] 70%. A sample size of [ADDRESS_423641] 50% with 90% power at the one-sided 0.01 (=0.05/5 – a Bonferroni 
adjustment for evaluating the sensitivity for the four regions and for all regions combined) 
significance level, assuming an average regions specific prevalence of 20%.  Although 19% of 
patients underwent biopsy and 15% of patients have imaging follow-up, we anticipate that the 
biopsy rate will fall in this study as referring clinicians become more comfortable with the 
imaging results.  Therefore, we will combine imaging and biopsy follow-up in the primary aim, 
and will require 375 with both imaging and/or biopsy follow-up in order to power the analysis at 
a per region level. Assuming a prevalence rate of 20% for disease in each individual region, a 
total sample size of 1,500 patients is required.  In summary, the proposed target accrual of 
1,500 patients (375 with biopsies or imaging follow-up) will provide adequate power for 
detecting the anticipated improvement in the sensitivity for both the per-patient and per-region 
based 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET imaging.  However, a sample size of 107 patients with 
biopsies/follow-up in total is sufficient for detecting the anticipated improvement in sensitivity 
when evaluating per-patient based sensitivity.  
Our current biochemical recurrence protocol has not completed analysis or enrollment.  
Therefore we will perform an analysis of our first protocol and based on those results we may 
adjust the sample size of this protocol using updated assumptions based on the interim analysis 
of our existing protocol.
Version date: 2017.08.22 Protocol CC#: 
Phase III – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page 18 of 328.2.2 Accrual estimates
We estimate that  roughly 250 patients with prostate cancer will be enrolled in this trial per year.  
Over a two-year period this will result in up to 500 patients being enrolled in the study.
8.3 Analyses Plans
8.3.1 Analysis Population
Patients
 with histopathology  correlates will be analyzed for the Primary Aim.  All remaining 
patients will be analyzed for the secondary endpoints.
8.3.2 Analysis of  Primary Endpoints
Sensitivity on a per-patient and per-region-basis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for detection of tumor 
location confirmed by [CONTACT_26745]/biopsy, clinical and conventional imaging follow-up will be 
calculated and reported along with the corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals. The 
confidence intervals will be constructed using the Wilson score method. For successful 
completion of the primary endpoint, two of the three readers will need to have an 70% sensitivity 
for the detection of disease on a per patient level for the cases that have a) imaging follow-up, 
b) pathology correlation or c) combination of pathology and imaging follow-up and/or pathology 
correlation. 
68Ga-PSMA-11 PET Results Definition
a) Imaging interpretation 68Ga-PSMA-11  PET:
Local Interpretations:  PET  images will initially be interpreted by a board certified nuclear 
medicine physician or a board-certified radiologist experienced in reading PET at the 
time of the imaging study at the institution that the study is being performed. These 
interpretations will not be used for final evaluation, and will not be reported as part of the 
primary or secondary endpoints.  
Central Read Logistics: Imaging data will be anonymized and collected at a central site. 
PET data will be interpreted by [CONTACT_342070] a random order at separate 
reading sessions. Cross sectional imaging (CT or MRI) from the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET will 
be available for anatomic correlate.  The Central readers will be blinded to all other 
imaging results and all other clinical data.
Reader Positivity and Negativity  Definition: Regions defined in Table 1 will be graded for 
the presence of suspected disease on a two-point scale by [CONTACT_30783] (0=Negative or 
1=Positive). A region will be judged as positive if at least one lesion in this region is 
visually positive.
Reader Training: 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT reading training set and guides will be 
provided and completion of this training will be required for all central review readers.  
Common pi[INVESTIGATOR_342062].
Criteria for visual interpretation: 
Regions of
 suspected disease will be graded on a two-point scale by [CONTACT_342071] (0=Negative 
or 1= Positive). A region will be judged as positive if at least one 
lesion in this region is visually positive.

Phase III – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page 19 of 32i) Lymph nodes will be considered positive if the 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake is focal and 
greater than blood pool (adjacent or mediastinal blood pool). 
(1) Lymph nodes will be classified further by [CONTACT_11338]: pelvic, retroperitoneal, 
thoracic, 
other.  Additionally, pelvic lymph nodes will be subclassified 
according to their localization as follows: R/L obturator, R/L external iliac, 
R/L internal iliac and other (total of 7 subgroups).  These regions will not be 
used for evaluation of the primary or secondary endpoints, but for 
exploratory analysis.
ii) Visceral lesions will be considered positive if the 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake is focal 
and greater than physiologic background activity of the involvement organ or 
anatomic site.
(1) Visceral lesions will be classified further by [CONTACT_92140]: lung, liver, other 
tissue.  These regions will not be used for evaluation of the primary or 
secondary endpoints, but for exploratory analysis.
iii) Bone lesions will be considered positive if the 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake is focal and 
greater than physiologic bone marrow.
(1) Bone lesions will be classified  by [CONTACT_92141]: spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], ribs, pelvis, 
extremities, skull, sternum, clavicle.  These regions will not be used for 
evaluation of the primary or secondary endpoints, but for exploratory 
analysis.

Follow-up Imaging:
All
 patients will be followed up 3-12 months with conventional imaging (dedicated CT, 
MRI 
and/or bone scan).  Interpretation of follow-up imaging will be performed by [CONTACT_92144]. For lesions that are reported in the blinded reads but not reported in the local 
evaluation of follow-up imaging, the local readers will be informed of the location of the 
lesions and follow-up will be performed for these additional lesions.  Preferably, the 
follow-up conventional imaging should be the same modality/modalities as the initial 
staging work-up to allow for reproducible and accurate comparisons.

c) Histopathology/Biopsy:
i)68Ga-PSMA-11 positive findings  are aimed to be confirmed by [CONTACT_26745]/biopsy 
if clinically feasible.  Pathology performed 60 days before the PSMA PET will be 
available for correlation.
ii) Histopathological procedures  and biopsies will be performed as clinically indicated 
and as per institutional protocol.
(1) Positive Histopathology/Biopsy : Confirmed sites of metastatic or tumor 
involvement by [CONTACT_26745]/biopsy will be discussed with the responsible 
physician/surgeon.  
(a) True Positive: lesion is positive on targeted biopsy/surgical sampling and is 
read as positive 
on PSMA PET.
(b) False Negative: lesion is positive on targeted biopsy/surgical sampling and is 
read as negative on PSMA PET.
Version date: 2017.08.22 Protocol CC#: 
Phase III – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page 24 of 32(2) Negative Biopsy : Patients with suspected tumor recurrence on 68Ga-PSMA-11 
PET with negative histopathology/biopsy  will be handled as outlined below:
(a) Lymph nodes:
For patients undergoing nodal dissection: Patients will be rescanned with 
dedicated 
CT, MRI or a repeat 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET to determine if the 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665] 68Ga-PSMA-11 positive node was removed.  
1. If 68Ga-PSMA-11 positive lymph node is still present, a repeat biopsy 
can be pursued if clinically feasible and applicable, or follow-up using 
imaging as described above will be performed.
2. If the corresponding node was removed, then this will be considered a 
False 
Positive.
For patients undergoing needle biopsy: Images of the procedure will be 
reviewed to determine
 if the correct node was biopsied.  
1. If the correct node was biopsied, then a negative biopsy will be 
considered a False
 Positive.
2. If the incorrect node was biopsied, then follow-up imaging as 
described above will be performed.
(b)
Bone lesions:  Given  the high rate of false negative biopsies for osseous 
metastases in patients with prostate cancer, patients with negative bone 
biopsies of PSMA PET positive lesions will be further evaluated:
If pathology demonstrates an alternative diagnoses that is known to be 
PSMA 
positive (eg Renal Cell Carcinoma metastases, Paget’s disease), 
then this will be considered a False Positive.
If pathology is indeterminate, then follow-up imaging as described above 
will be performed.
(3) Although
 not  routinely performed during standard practice, immunohistochemical 
staining for PSMA of tumor specimens (primary and lymph node metastases) 
may be performed, although not required.
d) Definitions of  True Positive, False Positive, True Negative, and False Negative patients 
and regions: Pathology will be considered superior to imaging and clinical follow-up 
when available as described below. Patient and region level classification will be 
performed for each blinded reader, and be reported separately. The following criteria 
serve as a guide for interpretation. However not all findings on a lesions, region and 
patient level can be detailed here and investigators may deviate from these criteria in 
individual patients.  These will be recorded for each interpretation that is not described in 
this protocol for the definition of a region or patient.
i) Patient level evaluation: 
(1) True
 positive patient: A single region in a patient contains a true positive node 
either 
by [CONTACT_342072]/clinical follow-up.
Version date: 2017.08.22 Protocol CC#: 
Phase III – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page 25 of 32(a) For a patient to be considered a True Positive, only one region is required to 
have a true positive lesion 
as described above, unless one region is 
categorized as a false positive based on pathology.  This means that a single 
pathology false positive region outweighs regions with imaging/clinical follow-
up true positive disease.
(b) A patient will be considered a True Positive if one region contains a lesion 
that 
is True Positive, even if other regions are categorized as inevaluable or 
false positive based on imaging or clinical follow-up.
(2) True negative patient: in the absence of True Positive or False Positive lesions, a 
patient 
will be considered a True Negative if there is pathology that is negative 
for disease and corresponding lesion is negative by [CONTACT_292658].
(3) False positive patient:  
(a) Pathology confirms  a false positive lesion that is read as positive on PSMA 
PET.
(b) In the absence of pathology: there are no true positive regions, and there is a 
region that
 is categorized as false positive based on imaging or clinical follow-
up.
(4) False negative patient:  in the absence of True Positive or False Positive lesions, 
a patient will be considered a False Negative if there is pathology that is positive 
for disease and corresponding lesion is negative by [CONTACT_292658].  Additionally, 
patients without evidence of disease on PSMA PET but with biochemical 
evidence of disease will be considered a False Negative.
ii) Region level evaluation: Each patient will have four evaluable regions (Table 1: 
prostate 
bed, pelvis, extrapelvic soft tissue, and bone metastases).  Each region will 
be categorized as true positive or false positive as described above.  Regions 
without evidence of PSMA positive disease or deemed inevaluable will not be 
included in the analysis.
(1) True positive region: 
(a) Pathology
 confirms  a PSMA avid lesion as a true positive in the region.
(b) In the absence of pathology, clinical or imaging follow-up demonstrates a true 
positive 
lesion within the region independent of the presence of an 
inevaluable lesion or a false positive lesion 
ie true positive disease will supersede a false positive lesion in the region 
based analysis if
 based on imaging/clinical follow-up
(2) True negative region: in the absence of True Positive or False Positive lesions 
within 
a region, the region will be considered a True Negative if there is 
pathology that is negative for disease in the region and corresponding lesion is 
negative by [CONTACT_292658].
(3) False positive region:
(a)
Pathology confirms  a PSMA avid lesion as a false positive in the region
Version date: 2017.08.22 Protocol CC#: 
Phase III – 68Ga-PSMA-11 Page 26 of 32(b) In the absence of pathology, there are no true positive lesions in the region, 
and there 
is a false positive lesion by [CONTACT_342073]-up.
(4) False negative region:  in the absence of True Positive or False Positive lesions in 
a region, the region will be considered a False Negative if there is pathology that 
is positive for disease in the region and corresponding lesion is negative by 
[CONTACT_292658].
8.3.3 Analysis of  Secondary Endpoints
1. PPVs on a per-patient and per-region-basis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for detection of tumor 
location confirmed by [CONTACT_26745]/biopsy, clinical and conventional imaging follow-up 
will be calculated and reported along with the corresponding two-sided 95% confidence 
intervals. The confidence intervals will be constructed using the Wilson score method. 
PPV will be reported for each of the three blinded readers independently.
2. Sensitivity and PPVs on a per-patient  and per-region basis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for 
detection of tumor location confirmed by [CONTACT_26745]/biopsy will be summarized in 
tabular format. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals of sensitivity, specificity, NPV and 
PPV will be calculated using the Wilson score method.  These will be reported for each of 
the three blinded readers.
3. Detection rates  on a per-patient basis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET stratified by [CONTACT_342063] (0.2 
- <0.5, 0.5 - <1.0, 1.0 - <2.0, 2.0 - <5.0, ≥5.0) will be summarized in tabular format and 
compared between PSA strata using chi-square analysis.  Detection rate will also be 
stratified by [CONTACT_342064], radiation or both; as well as by [CONTACT_342074] (ADT).  We will use local interpretations for this 
analysis.  
a. Detection rate  is defined as number of patients with PSMA positive disease, 
independent of pathology, imaging or clinical follow-up.  A detection rate will be 
reported for each reader independently stratified by [CONTACT_43876].
4. The impact of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET on clinical management in BCR patients will be 
evaluated using descriptive statistics. 
5. Inter-reader reproducibility  for positivity at the patient level and region level will be 
reported using the Fleiss’ Kappa test for multiple readers.  We will use the three blinded 
reads for this analysis.
6. Safety will be reported descriptively as rates of patient reported adverse events.  
Additionally, adverse events will be characterized and quantified by [CONTACT_3989] 4.03.

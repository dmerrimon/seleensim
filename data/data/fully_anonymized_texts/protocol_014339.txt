 Postmarket Solyx™ Study PS120093:  A Prospective, Non -Randomized, 
Parallel Cohort, Multi -center Study of the Solyx ™ Single Incision Sling 
System vs. the Obtryx™ II  Sling System for the Treatment of Women with 
Stress Urinary Incontinence  
Primary 
Statistical 
Hypothesis  The single incision sling will be non -inferior to the standard outside -in 
transobturator sling for the treatment of female stress urinar y incontinence  in 
safety and effectiveness at 36 months as compared to Baseline.  
Statistical testing will be performed to determine if success rate of 
improvement in stress urinary incontinence at 36 months of single incision 
sling (treatment) group will be  non- inferior to transobturator device  (control) 
group. The null hypothesis is that the success rate in treatment  group is less 
than or equal to the success rate  in control group minus margin: 
 
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 −𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟 ≤ − ∆    
 
The alternative hypothesis is:  
 
𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻: 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟> − ∆     
 
where 𝜋𝜋 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡  
 and 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟 are the success rate of improvement in stress 
urinary incontinence at 36 months in treatment group and control group 
respectively, and ∆  is defined as the non -inferiority margin.

11.6. Re-Intervention  
It is the intention of this  study to demonstrate an improvement in stress urinary incontinence 
through clinical effectiveness of a single incision sling.  However, it is recognized that during 
the course of the study, there is a possibility  subjects may require a re-intervention for events 
including but not limited to failed sling repair, persistence of SUI symptoms, or a mesh -
related complication .  A re -intervention may include surgical or non- surgical treatments 
(medical) . For the purpose of this study surgical interventions shall b e classified as “re-
surgery” and non- surgical interventions shall be classified as “re-interventions”.   
Non- surgical interventions  (re-interventions) are defined as office-based procedures and do 
not involve an operating room procedure.  Examples of non-s urgical interventions may 
include but are not limited to an office visit to trim exposed mesh in the vagina or physical 
therapy to treat procedural complications or persistent SUI symptoms .  Data on non- surgical 
interventions will be captured in the CRFs.  Subjects will continue to be followed per the 
regular study visit schedule.   
Surgical interventions ( re-surgery) are surgical operations or procedures performed to correct 
recurring SUI symptoms or a mesh -related complication.  These surgical events typi [INVESTIGATOR_712393] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Surgical events 
may include a re- operation to remove mesh material or to loosen the sling  as well as a 
bulking agent application to treat recurrence. The decision to perform a re -surgery will be per 
physician and subject discretion and all re- surgery data will be captured in the Case Report 
Forms.  Subjects undergoing re- surgery to treat recurrence or persistence of SUI symptoms 
are considered treatment failures.  
Subjects under going a re -surgery will be followed to [ADDRESS_969104]  death, results are to be documented in the source documentation and 
Case Report Form  and reported to the Sponsor within the timeframe noted in Table 21.4-1: 
Investigator Reporting Requirements .  If an autopsy is conducted, a copy of the final autopsy

 [LOCATION_011] Scientific will provide a study- specific template of the ICF to investigators 
participating in this study. The ICF template may be modified to meet the requirements of the 
investigative center’s IRB/EC.  Any modification requires approval from BSC prior to use of 
the form.  The ICF must be in a language understandable to the subject and if needed, BSC will assist the center in obtaining a written consent translation. Translated consent forms must also have IRB/EC approval prior to their use.  Privacy  language shall be included in the 
body of the form or as a separate form as applicable.   
The process of obtaining Informed Consent shall: 
• be conducted by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_5704],  
• include a description of all aspects of the clinical study that are relevant to the subject’s 
decision to participate throughout the clinical study, 
• avoid any coercion of or undue influence of subject s to participate,  
• not waive or appear to waive subject ’s legal rights,  
• use native language that is non- technical and understandable to the subject  or his/her 
legal representative,  
• provide ample time for the subject to consider participation and ask questions if 
necessary,  
• ensure important new information is provided to new and existing subjects throughout the 
clinical study . 
The ICF shall always be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_307980].  If a legal representative signs, the subject shall be asked to provide informed 
consent for continued participation as soon as his/her medical condition allows. The original signed ICF will be retained by [CONTACT_71657] a copy of the signed and dated document and any other written information  must be given to the person signing the form.  
Failure to obtain subject  consent will be reported by [CONTACT_71658] (e.g. , FDA requirement is within 5 working days of learning 
of such an event). Any violations of the informed consent process must be reported as deviations to the sponsor and local regulatory authorities (e.g. IRB/EC), as appropriate.  
If new information becomes available that can significantly affect a subject 's future health 
and medical care, that information shall be provided to the affected subject (s) in written form 
via a revised ICF or , in some situations, enrolled subject s may be requested to sign and date 
an addendum to the ICF. In addition to new significant information during the course of a study, other situations may necessitate revision of the ICF, such as if there are amendments to the protocol, a change in P rincipal Investigator, administrative changes, or following 
annual review by [CONTACT_1201]/EC. The new version of the ICF must be approved by [CONTACT_1201]/EC. [LOCATION_011] Scientific approval is required if changes to the revised ICF are requested by [CONTACT_16018]’s IRB/EC. The IRB/EC will determine the subject population to be re-consented.

21. Safety Reporting  
21.1. Definitions and Classification  
Adverse event definitions are provided in Table 21.1-1. A dministrative edits were made to 
combine definitions from ISO [ZIP_CODE] and MEDDEV 2.7/3 12/2010.  
Table 21.1-1: Adverse Event Definitions  
Term  Definition  
Adverse Event (AE)  
 
Ref: ISO [ZIP_CODE] -2011 
 
Ref: MEDDEV 2.7/3 12/[ADDRESS_969111] clinical signs (including an abnormal laboratory finding) in 
subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device.  
NOTE 1: This includ es events related to the investigational medical device 
or comparator.
 
NOTE 2: This definition includes events related to the procedures involved 
(any procedure in the clinical investigation plan).  
NOTE 3: For users or  other persons, this definition is restricted to events 
related to the investigational medical device.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
 
Ref: ISO [ZIP_CODE] -2011 
 
Ref: MEDDEV 2.7/3 12/2010 Adverse event that:  
• Led to death , 
• Led to  serious deterioration in the health of the subject , that either 
resulted in:  
o a life -threatening illness or injury, or  
o a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or  
o in-subject   or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272563], or  
o medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function  
• Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
NOTE 1: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition, or a 
procedure requir ed by [CONTACT_5745], without serious 
deterioration in health, is not considered a serious adverse event.  
Device Deficiency

 Underlying diseases are not reported as AEs unless there is an increase in severity or 
frequency during the course of the investigation. Death should not be recorded as an AE, but should only be reflected as an outcome of a specific SAE (see Table 21.1-1 for AE definitions).  
Any device related or study procedure related AE experienced by [CONTACT_272617], whether during or subsequent to the procedure, must be recorded in the CRF.   Only device and procedure- related AE’s are captured in this study.   
Refer to Section 19 for the known risks associated with the study device(s). 
21.2. Relationship  to Study Device(s)  
The i nvestigator must assess the relationship of the AE to the study device as related or 
unrelated. See criteria in Table 21.2-1:  
Table 21.2-1: Criteria for Assessing Relationship of Study Device to Adverse Event  
Classification  Description  
Unrelated  The adverse event is determined to be due to a concurrent illness or effect of another 
device/drug and is not related to the investigational product.  
Related  • The adverse event is determined to be potentially related to the investigational 
product, and an alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the 
potential relationship to investigational product , or 
• There is a strong relationship to investigational product, or recurs on re -challenge, 
and another etiology is unlikely , or 
• There is no other reasonable medical explanation for the event.  
21.3. Relationship to Study Procedure 
The i nvestigator must assess the relationship of the AE to the study procedure as unrelated, 
possibly related, or probably related . See criteria in Table 21.2-1:  
Table 21.3-2: Criteria for Assessing Relationship to Study Procedure  
Classification  Description  
Unrelated  • No evidence that the timing of the adverse event has a relationship to  the  
procedure performed.  
Possibly Related  • The adverse event has a timely relationship to procedure  performed.   
However, a potential alternative etiology may be responsible for the adverse  
event.  
Probably Related  • The adverse event has a timely relationship to the study procedure performed and 
the causative relationship can be clearly established. No potential alternative 
etiology is apparent.

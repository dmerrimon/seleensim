• Biopsy- proven unresected cancer of the pancreas or ampulla  
• No prior  complete  surgical resection  
• ECOG performance status ≤2  
• No prior history of radiation therapy to the abdominal area  
• Primary tumor size ≤7.[ADDRESS_846099] diameter  
• No duodenal invasion

Required Sample S ize: upto 24 patients, with 1 -2 patients accrued per month  
 
Study C enter : University of Chicago Medical Center , Pritzker School of Medicine  
 
Concept and Rationale : Cancers involving the upper gastrointestinal tract often present at 
advanced stages, and as such, are associated with an overall survival that may be less than one 
year after diagnosis. Because these cancers may progress both locally and distantly, a standard of care for unresected , non -metastatic disease is to administer both Radiation Therapy (RT) and 
systemic chemotherapy. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], radiation therapy is given concurrently with radiosensitizing chemotherapy using conventional fraction sizes (1.8- 2 Gy/fraction), requiring [ADDRESS_846100] 
in delivering larger fraction sizes (e.g., > 8 Gy/fraction), thereby [CONTACT_633679], and perhaps improving biologic effect. For other sites such as the lung and liver, this form of therapy (known a s Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy) has achiev ed high rates of local control, with 
no appreciable increase in toxicity of treatment in the observed time of follow -up.  
 From a practical standpoint, if there existed an effective and safe means to achieve local control 
and contract the length of RT into two weeks, patients would be more likely to tolerate aggressive systemic therapy . Meanwhile, with a positive initial experience in the unresectable 
setting, SBRT could be studied in the preoperative setting (e.g., for resectable or borderline resectable patients) .

Secondary Objectives: To define  toxicities, the post -treatment pain score, and quality of life, the 
rate of post -treatment resectability, and local control (as measured by [CONTACT_633680]).  
 
Study D esign :  
 
• Dose escalation schema: Patients will be enrolled in a 3+3 dose escalation schema 
including doses of 10 Gy, 12.5 Gy, and 15 Gy. Once the MTD is reached, patients will be 
treated in an expanded cohort.  
• Radiation therapy: The primary tumor will be treated with stereotactic body radiation 
therapy in three fractions over [ADDRESS_846103] with localization. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_633672] n. Constraints to surrounding critical 
structures (duodenum, liver, kidneys, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]) will be observed.  
• Chemotherapy: No concurrent chemotherapy will be administered with the RT. Patients 
will be allowed to receive chemotherapy prior to RT , although this is not required. Post -
RT chemotherapy will be at the discretion of the treating physicians.  
• Surgery: ability to achieve resection will be documented by [CONTACT_633681] 
(complete microscopic, incomplete microscopic, or gross residual). Re -evaluation for 
resectability will be at the discretion of the treating physician and not be a requirement of the study.  
 
Statistical M ethods : A 3+3 dose escalation design will be used. The maximum tolerated dose 
will be exceeded if 2 or more patients out of 6 (or a third or more) experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at that dose. The dose immediately below will be recommended for further study. DLTs are defined as any acute toxicity of Grade 4 nausea, Grade 4 skin toxicity, Grade 3+ liver toxicity (me tabolic or ascites), or Grade 3+ enteritis. Severe late toxicities of interest (occurring 
beyond the 4 week period of evaluation and up to 12 months after RT) will include any Grade 3+ gastrointestinal toxicity (such as small bowel ulcer, stricture, perfor ation, bleed, liver damage, 
pancreatitis, or cholecystitis). If the rate of any severe late toxicity of interest exceeds 25% (i.e. , 
7 or more patients in the expanded cohort of 18 treated at the MTD), the study committee will suspend accrual and determine whether further dose modifications are needed; the protocol will be amended accordingly.

Stereotactic Body Rad iation Therapy for Unresected Cancer of the Pancreas or Ampulla  
 
 1 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1. Primary Objectiv es 
 
The primary objective is to assess the Maximum Tolerated Dose  (MTD) of delivering 
three fractions of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT), and identify the 
appropriate dose for treatment of unresected  carcinoma of the ampulla  or pancreas.   
 
1.2. Secondary Objectives  
 
 Secondary objectives include defining toxicities, effect on pain score, and quality of 
life, the rate of post- treatment resectability, and local control (as measured by [CONTACT_633682] c riteria).  
 
  
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.[ADDRESS_846105] an overall survival that is less than one year after 
diagnosis. Because these cancers may progress both locally and distantly, and cause significant symptoms , patients are candidates to receive a combination of local 
Radiation Therapy (RT) and systemic chemotherapy. For patients with non- metastatic 
pancreatic cancer, data support the use of 5- Fluorouracil and RT as a means to 
favorably impact overall s urvival ( Moertel, 1981). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], RT is given concurrently 
with radiosensitizing chemotherapy using conventional fraction sizes (1.8- 2 
Gy/fraction), over 5- [ADDRESS_846106] high rates of recurrence after surgical resection ( Carter, 2008 ). In 
the unresectable setting, whether patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease, lack of treatment may resul t in local symptoms including pain, 
gastrointestinal or biliary obstruction, bleeding, or perforation. For patients who are 
candidates to receive therapy, RT may be a useful adjunct to systemic chemotherapy 
to palliate patients of these symptoms (Boz, 2001).  
 
2.[ADDRESS_846107] in delivering larger fraction sizes (e.g., > 8 Gy/fraction), thereby [CONTACT_633679], and perhaps improving biologic effect.  For other sites such as 
the lung and liver, this form of therapy (known as Stereotactic Body Radiation 
Therapy) has achieved high  rates of local control, with no appreciable increase in 
toxicity of treatment with limited follow -up (Timmerman , 2007;  Kavana gh, 2006) . In 
Stereotactic Body Rad iation Therapy for Unresected Cancer of the Pancreas or Ampulla  
 
 2 the setting of unresectable pancreatic cancer, there are two published experiences 
using SBRT techniques ( Hoyer , 2005;  Koong, 2004). The experience from Stanford 
(Koong, 2004) with 15 -25 Gy in one fraction has been favorable, with only 5 of 15 
patients treated on this dose escalation protocol demonstrating grade 1 -2 toxicity 
(nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain) with no patient demonstrating grade 3+ toxicity on initial report . Meanwhile, all [ADDRESS_846108] dose of 25 Gy had local 
control of the disease. Longer term follow -up of 77 patients treated with 25 Gy 
demonstrated a local control rate of 84% at 1 year, with moderate late toxicity (Grade 2+) in 10 (13%) of patients (Chang, 2008). The nature of the toxicity was related to gastrointestinal function, including ulceration of the small bowel (n=3) or stomach (n=3), stricture of the duodenum (n=1) or biliary system (n=2), or perforation of the small bowel (n=1). Toxicity was increased for men who received prior external beam radiation therapy in addition to the single stereotactic dose of 25 Gy. The risk of 
severe toxicity (G3+) was approximately 10% in patients treated with SBRT alone.  In contrast, a phase II study from Denmark (Hoyer , 2005) treated 22 patients with 45 Gy 
(15 G y x 3 fractions) for unresectable pancreatic cancer  and found lower rates of 
control . Local control was only 57% at 6 months. This lower rate of local control is 
consistent with the approximately 50% rates observed in other studies giving standard fraction ation RT, including post -operative (Smeenk, 2007) and definitive settings 
(Moertel, 1981). Meanwhile, g rade 2+ toxicity  (defined in this study as performance 
status, nausea, diarrhea, or pain  at day 14 assessment)  was 79% . Of note, pretreatment 
evaluation revealed that patients had symptoms consistent with grade 2+ toxicity in approximately 63%, so the actual increase in toxicity over baseline is difficult to quantify given the grading schema used and the lack of follow -up past day 14.  These 
discrepant rep orts of SBRT indicate a need for further trials to help identify the role of 
SBRT for unresectable pancreatic cancer. With the poor ability to achieve local control, 
it is of interest to note whether SBRT could be more effective than standard fractionation . Furthermore, as neither of these studies followed detailed gastrointestinal 
toxicity according to prospectively defined dosimetric planning criteria, it is important to better characterize the nature and frequency of such treatment.  
 From a practical sta ndpoint, if there existed an effective and safe means to achieve 
local control and contract the length of RT into two weeks , patients would be more 
likely to tolerate aggressive systemic therapy. A recent phase III study randomizing patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer to gemci tabine chemotherapy with or 
without sandwich 5- FU, cisplatin, and concurrent RT found that the aggressive local 
therapy was associated with significant toxicity, which limited administration of systemic therapy and negatively impacted survival (Mornex, 2007). Meanwhile, “standard” administration  of 5- FU with continuous course RT is also associated with a 
risk of severe toxicity. The RTOG 97- 04 demonstrated a 59% risk of any Grade 3 
non-hematologic toxicity in patients who recei ved 5-FU/RT and adjuvant systemic 
therapy after pancreaticoduodenectomy (Regine, 2008). The hypothesis of any SBRT approach for locally advanced, non- metastatic pancreatic cancer is that this 
combination of dose -intense local therapy over [ADDRESS_846109] fractionation. Meanwhile, with a positive initial experience in the unresectable setting, SBRT could be studied in the preoperative setting (e.g., for borderline resectable patients) . RT with 
Stereotactic Body Rad iation Therapy for Unresected Cancer of the Pancreas or Ampulla  
 
 [ADDRESS_846110] ion of borderline resectable patients  and 
treatment with preoperative radiation therapy and chemotherapy, approximately 40% 
of these patients are able to then undergo resection ( Katz, 2008). R esectability is the 
most important prognostic factor for success  after treatment, and as such , is an 
important potential endpoint to evaluate.

 5 4.2             Measuring Health Related Quality of Life  
             
             Patient reported outcome measures will include  the Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy–Hepatobiliary (FACT -Hep) questionnaire, a 45- item self -reported  instrument designed 
to measure health -related quality of life (HRQ OL) in patients with hepatobiliary cancers  
including pancreatic cancers. The FACT -Hep consists of the [ADDRESS_846118] -G, which assesses 
generic HRQ OL concerns  including physical, emotional, social a nd functional well being, and the 
newly validated 18- item Hepatobiliary Subscale (HS), which assesses disease- specific issues (see 
Appendix D). The q uestionnaire will be administered to all patients on trial at baseline, post 
treatment at follow up exams a t 1,2,4,6,[ADDRESS_846119] fraction of RT. Dose Limiting T oxicity (DLT) will be defined 
according to Common Toxicity Crit eria version 3.0 (See Appendix B ) and includes  
the following acute toxicities : 
• Grade 4 nausea (life -threatening consequences)  
• Grade 4 skin toxicity (necrosis or ulceration of full thickness dermis, 
spontaneous bleeding from involved site)  
• Grade 3+ liver toxicity  including symptomatic ascites requiring invasive 
procedure, or total bi lirubin  >[ADDRESS_846120]  >[ADDRESS_846121], or  ALT  >[ADDRESS_846122] 
that persists until day 28, and is attributable  to radiation therapy.  
• Grade 3+ enteritis (abdominal pain, fever, change in bowel habits with ileus, 
peritoneal signs) that is attributable to radiation thera py. 
 
Patients must have a minimum of 3 weeks of follow -up after RT start for patient data 
to contribute enough follow -up for consideration of dose -limiting toxicity. However, 
any DLT that occurs with shorter follow -up will count towards the dose escalation  
rules.  In addition , any grade 5 toxicity (i.e., death) considered possibly, probably or 
likely related to RT  will be considered a DLT . 
 
Any late toxicity that occurs beyond the [ADDRESS_846123]. Included are the following severe 
late toxicities  of RT : 
• Grade 3+ gastrointestinal ulcer, fistula, stricture, or perforation  (symptomatic 
and severely altered GI function, IV fluids or TPN ≥24 hrs, intervention indicated)  
• Grade 3+ gastrointestinal mucositis (confluent ulcerations or 
pseudomembranes, bleeding with minor trauma)  
• Grade 3+ gastrointestinal bleed (transfusion, interventional radiology or 
endoscopic or opera tive intervention) 
• Grade 3+ gastrointestinal necrosis (inability to aliment adequately by [CONTACT_575969], 
interventional radiology, intervention indicated)  
• Grade 3+ liver toxicity including symptomatic ascites requiring invasive 
procedure, or total bilirubin >[ADDRESS_846124] >[ADDRESS_846125], or ALT >[ADDRESS_846126] , 
or asterixis,  that is attributable to radiation therapy .   
Stereotactic Body Rad iation Therapy for Unresected Cancer of the Pancreas or Ampulla  
 
 6 • Grade 3+ enteritis (abdominal pain, fever, change in bowel habits with ileus, 
peritoneal signs) that is attributable to radiation therapy.  
• Grade 3+ pancreat itis (interventional radiology or operative intervention 
indicated)  
• Grade 3+ cholecystitis (interventional radiology or operative intervention 
indicated)  
 
These severe, late toxicities will be evaluated  between [ADDRESS_846127] , the study 
committee will suspend accrual and determine whether furthe r dose modifications are 
needed; the protocol will be amended accordingly .  If the true probability of DLT at 
the MTD is 50%, the combination will be identified as too toxic with probability 0.88. If the true probability of DLT at the MTD is 25%, the  combination will be identified 
as having an acceptable toxicity profile with probability 0.86.  
 Management associated with the above adverse events is  outlined in Section 7.   
 
Dose escalation will proceed within each cohort according to the following scheme.   
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined above.

 7 4.4  General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
There is no restriction towards the use of any non -chemotherapeutic agent during 
administration of RT as specified for the symptom management.  
 
A proton pump inhibitor is recommended one week prior and for three months following RT. Ondansetron 8 mg will be administered prior to each radiation treatment. It is optional for patients to receive corticosteroid premedication (e.g. 
dexamethasone 4 mg p.o. in a si ngle dose) 15- 60 minutes prior to each of three 
treatments. Analgesic premedication to avoid general discomfort during long radiation planning or treatment durations is also recommended when appropriate. Antiemetics will be ordered at the discretion of the  attending physician. Mucositis/esophagitis may 
be treated with sulcrafate or a GI cocktail (e.g. Tylenol #3 suspension, benad ryl elixir, 
Maalox, viscous lidocaine). Intravenous hydration is recommended in patients with inadequate oral intake. Treatment -related diarrhea may be managed with loperamide.  
The recommended dose of loperamide is 4 mg initially (two capsules) then 2 mg after each loose stool, not to exceed 16 mg daily.  
 Administration of chemotherapy concurrent with RT is not allowed. Chemotherapeutic agents given before or after RT are at the discretion of the treating 
physician, with exclusion of bevacizumab or vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor , given concern for RT -related wound healing issues particularly regarding 
small bowel.  
 
  
4.5 Duration of Therapy  
 
Duration of SBRT is to occur within a 10 day time period. Completion of the three 
fractions of RT will be delayed or foregone if:  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
• Further treatment is felt to b e likely to result in severe and permanent 
impairment, or death (life -threatening toxicity),  
• The p atient decides to withdraw from the study , or 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in  the judgment of the investigator.  
 
The use of chemotherapy after RT will be at the discretion  of the treating physician.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_846130].  Patients removed from protocol therapy  for 
unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the 
adverse event.  
 
4.7 Criteria for Removal from Study  
 
Stereotactic Body Rad iation Therapy for Unresected Cancer of the Pancreas or Ampulla  
 
 8 Patients will be removed from study (but followed for potentia l of toxicity) when any 
of the criteria listed in Section 4.[ADDRESS_846131] be documented in the Case Report Form.  
 
 
 
5. Radiation Therapy Guidelines  
 
5.1  Treatment Related Planning Procedure s 
 5.1.1.   All patients will be evaluated prior to simulation for placement of fiducial markers 
(by [CONTACT_633683]) in or around the primary 
tumor, for purposes of stereotactic localization prior to SBRT. Marker placement is preferred but not required.   
 5.1.2.  When done, the ideal timing of MRI will be ≥[ADDRESS_846132] simulation ≥[ADDRESS_846133] scan for retrospective 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_633673]- based imaged sorting is highly preferred but not required.  
 
5.2  RT Planning  Parameters 
 5.2.1.   T he definition of volumes wil l be in accordance with the ICRU Report 62 : 
Prescribing, Recor ding and Reporting Photon Beam Therapy.  (ICRU, 1999)  
 [IP_ADDRESS]. A gross tumor volume (GTV) will be entered for each lesion, based on available 
imaging data.  
 [IP_ADDRESS]. In the absence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_125344], an internal target volume (ITV) will be 
defined as th e volume that accounts for intrafraction target motion.  
 [IP_ADDRESS]. A clinical target volume (CTV) will be defined as the GTV or ITV (when 
available) plus a margin for microscopic extension.  
 [IP_ADDRESS]. A planning target volume (PTV) will be determined which wi ll correspond to 
CTV plus appropriate margin for tumor motion and set- up uncertainty.  
 5.2.2.   3D coplanar or non- coplanar beam arrangements will be custom designed for each 
case to deliver highly conformal prescription  dose distributions. The treatment p lan 
used for each patient will be based on an analysis of the volumetric dose, including dose volume histogram of the PTV and normal structures. 3D “forward” planning or “inverse” planning with beamlet intensity modulated treatment planning are allowed.  
 5.2.3. Treatment is to be delivered using a linear accelerator and photon energies ≥ 6 MV. 
 5.2.4. Corrections will be made to account for tissue heterogeneity.  
 5.2.5. RT is to be delivered to each site in 3 fractions over a period of up to 10 total days .   
 5.2.6. RT Dose :  A phase I escalation of doses will be performed in order to determine in 
MTD in Gy . Doses of radiation will start at Level 1 and increase as follows in 
order to determine the MTD in Gy:  Level 1:  10 Gy/ fraction x 3 fractions = 30 Gy  
Stereotactic Body Rad iation Therapy for Unresected Cancer of the Pancreas or Ampulla  
 
 9  Level 2: 12.5 Gy/fraction x 3 fractions = 37.5 Gy  
 Level 3: 15 Gy/fraction x 3 fractions = 45 Gy  
 If DLT is met at Level 1, dose will be de -escalated to Level -1: 7.5 Gy x 3 
fractions = 22. 5 Gy  
 5.2.7. Doses will be prescribed to the PTV.  The PTV may be covered by a lower isodose 
line than usually used in conventional radiotherapy planning, typi[INVESTIGATOR_195088] 
80% but ranging from 60- 100%. Ideally, the prescription dose will cover >90% of 
the G TV (V100 GTV > 90%, and V95PTV > 90%) . A lower coverage goal (with 
no mini mum requirement of PTV coverage) will be acceptable if necessary to 
meet normal tissue constraints , which will be assigned priority over tumor 
coverage . 
 [IP_ADDRESS]. Any dose > 110 % must be within the PTV.   
 5.2.8.   Dose/volume constraints:  The following tabl e lists maximum dose limits to a 
point or volume within several critical organs. These are absolute limits, and are 
listed as total over [ADDRESS_846134] be contoured such that appropria te dose volume histograms 
(DVHs) can be generated.

• Esophagus . The esophagus will be contoured using mediastinal windowing on CT 
to correspond to the  mucosal, submucosa, and all muscular layers out to the fatty 
adventitia. The esophagus  should be contoured starting at least [ADDRESS_846136] 10 below the inferior extent of the PTV.  
• Stom ach. The outer wall of the stomach will be contoured to include the cardia of 
the stomach to the pylorus.  
• Heart/pericardium. The heart will be contoured along with the pericardial sac. The 
superior aspect (or base) for  purposes of contouring will begin at the level of the 
inferior aspect of the aortic arch (aortopulmonary  window) and extend inferiorly to 
the apex of the heart.  Organ  Volume  Dose

involved by [CONTACT_424450] (Normal liver volume minus GTV).  
• Duodenum . The outer wall of the duodenum will be contoured from the edge of 
the pylorus of the stomach to the start of the jejunum, and include four segments  
of the duodenum. 
• Jejunum/ileum . The jejunum and ileum will be contoured to include the outer  wall 
of the small bowel distal to the duodenum  to the end of the ileum , and also include 
the mesentery and vessels anterior to the aorta .  
• Total kidney . Kidneys will be contoured to include the renal capsule and 
parenchyma up to the hilum. 
• Skin. The skin will be defined as the outer 0. 3 cm of the body surface. As such it 
is a rind of  uniform thickness (0. 3 cm) which envelopes the entire body in the 
axial planes. The cranial  and caudal surface of the superior and inferior limits of 
the planning CT should not be  contoured as skin unless skin is actually present in 
these locations (e.g., the scalp on the top of the head).

6. ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting will be performed.   
• Radiation side effects are limited to the area in volved in the treatment field .  Acute and 
late toxicity related to radiation therapy may include fatigue, nausea and vomiting, skin 
erythema, subcutaneous fibrosis, esophagitis, pericarditis, diarrhea, myelitis, damage to 
the small bowel (including stricture  or obstruction , bleed , fistula formation, or 
perforation), liver dysfunction, kidney damage, and radiation enteritis.  
 
• Acute toxicity including Grade 4 nausea, Grade 4 skin toxicity, and Grade 3 liver toxicity 
will be referred to as dose limiting toxicities (DLT).  
 
• Late toxici ty including any Grade 3+ GI toxicity (small bowel damage including stricture  
or obstruction , bleed, fistula formation, or perforation ; liver damage  including ascites but 
not including abnormal lab values only; pancreatitis, cholecystitis) will be consider ed a 
toxicity of interest.

 [ADDRESS_846141] – Solid Tumors  
 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_633688] S olid Tumors (RECIST) 
Committee (Therasse, 2000) .  Changes in only the largest dia meter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_846142] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_846143] be recorded in 
millimete rs (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_846144] scan), are considered non -measurable disease.   
 
Target lesions.   The primary lesion (with immediately adjacent lesions) that will 
be treated with RT should be identified as the target lesion (s) and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated 
measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]).  A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_14218].  
 
   
8.1.[ADDRESS_846145] and MRI   These techniques sho uld be performed with cuts of 5 mm or less in

8.1.4 Response Criteria  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :Disappearance of the primary target lesion (s) 
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD 
of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR 
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started  
 
 
9.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1  Study Design/Endpoints  
 
The study is a phase I/II study that will escalate dose according to determination of dose limiting toxicities, in a 3 +3 design as outlined in section 5.2. The MTD will be 
exceeded if 2 or more patients out of 6 (or a third or more) experience a DLT at that dose.  The dose immediately below will be recommended for further study. . The phase II portion of the study will continue accrual at the maximum tolerated dose and measure the efficacy and health related quality of life after SBRT.  
 
   
Stereotactic Body Rad iation Therapy for Unresected Cancer of the Pancreas or Ampulla  
 
 16 9.2  Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
The study will accrue [ADDRESS_846146] -treatment surgical resectability, and local 
control. Patients who are able to undergo surgical resection will be documented as having a mic roscopi[INVESTIGATOR_365980] (R0), microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_136520] (R1), or gross 
incomplete (R2) resection.  
 All patients included in the study will be ass essed for response to treatment .  Patients 
who do not demonstrate any local progression (patients with CR+PR+SD ) at the 
primary site (using RECIST criteria by [CONTACT_462]) will be considered to be locally controlled. Duration of local control (TLC) will be defined to be the time from the 
start of RT until clinical or RECIST progression, death from treatment toxicity,  or last 
patient follow -up. Patients who experience clinical or RECIST progression, or death 
from treatment toxicity will be considered to have experienced a local control event; 
otherwise patients will be consid ered censored at last contact. The probabili ty of LC 
as a function of time since RT will be quantified by [CONTACT_41238] (Kalbfleisch , 2002).  The relative hazard for LC event according to assigned RT level 
will be calculated using the relative risk regression model of Cox, but formal statistical conclusions will not be drawn from this analysis.  
 10.  CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
10.1       Patient Confidentiality I ssues  
 
Study records that identify patients will be kept confidential. Study records will contain patients’ name, address, and medical  history number and will be available to 
the study doctor, research nurse, and data coordinator.  Data collected in this study will be maintained on a password protected computer that only the primary 
investigator, co -investigators, research nurse, and dat a coordinator will be able to 
access.  Study records will be secured in locked offices in the Department of R adiation 
and Cellular O ncology.  Neither patient ’s name [CONTACT_633691].

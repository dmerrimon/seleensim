1.1. Purpose
The [LOCATION_002] (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested that the sponsor
conduct a postmarketing study  to collect samples from inflammatory  bowel disease patients 
(IBD) treated with Remicade® (infliximab) and/or Simponi® (golimumab) tolearn more about 
hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL ). Specificall y, samples will be collected to identify
genetic mutations and other biomar kers that may allow earlier evaluation of a patient’s risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_469941] .Samples to be requested from each patient include the biops y used to 
diagnose HSTCL, and if possible, additional samples including a single blood sample, buccal 
swab sample , and/or abowel tissue sample previously  collected as part of the patient’s IBD 
diagnosis or treatment . In addition, patient information will be collected including, but not 
limited to, patient demographics and medical history . Samples will be stored by [CONTACT_469973]. The study  will be conducted in North America and the planned 
duration of the study  is 8years. 
A Scientific Advisory Committee has been established for this study  and include san 
independent panel of experts who will review the emerging science related to HSTCL  and latest 
available test methods and make recommendations to the sponsor (see Section 5.3, Scientific 
Advisory  Committee ). When the types of analy ses to be performed on the tissue samples 
collected have been determined by [CONTACT_469974] , the sample analysis plan will be developed . The test methods that may be used 
include deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing, messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) gene expression, protein expression, or functional tests on cells 
isolated from peripheral blood. Nomedical or scientific benefit will be provided to patients who
participate in the study ; however, future patients at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_469943].
1.2. Hepatosplenic T -cell Lymphoma
Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL ) is a rare and aggressive subtype of peripheral T-cell 
lymphoma with a poor prognosis (Herrinton, 2011; de Leval, 2011). HSTCL  generally  shows 
T-cell proliferation, particularly  in the sinusoids of the liver or spleen, without lymph node 
enlargement. It is also occas ionall y diagnosed through bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706], later in its 
course, malignant T-cells can be found in peripheral blood. In the US, the incidence is 
approximately  0.3 cases per million person -years in the general population. However, in patients 
with immune mediated conditions such as IBD or acqu ired immune deficiency  syndrome , the 
incidence increases as much as 100-fold. HSTCL  has also been reported in organ transplant 
patients (Tey , 2008). DNA, RNA ,or protein biomarkers may provide a method to identi fy 
patients predisposed to develop HSTCL .
REMICADE® (infliximab); SIMPONI® (golimumab) Protocol Amendment 3REMICADELYM4001
[ADDRESS_602358] been reviewed (Ko tylar, 
2010; Kotylar, 2011) , and include gender (>90% male); age (90% under 35 years of age); 
treatment with thiopurines such as 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine (100%); treatment with a 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor such as infliximab (REMI CADE®; 56%, all with 
concomitant thiopurine treatment); and duration of thiopurine treatment (97% >2 years). HSTCL 
has also been reported in patients treated with other TNF inhibitors such as adalimumab 
(Ochenrider, 2010) ,and other monoclonal antibodies with other mechanisms of action such as 
natalizumab (Kotylar, 2010). Although most published cases of HSTCL  have occurred in 
immun ocompromised individuals, a recent study  describes some patients with no history  of 
immune -related comorbidities or immunosuppressive therap y (Voss, 2013). 
Literature describing the clinical and presenting features of patients with HSTCL  has been 
reviewed (Tripi[CONTACT_17388], 2009). Diagnosis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y confirmed by [CONTACT_167666], liver, or spleen 
biopsy  using histologic, flow cy tometric ,and cytogenetic anal yses. The tumor cells are generall y 
γ/δ T cells with a Vδ1 variable region, positive for CD3 and occasionally positive for CD8 or 
CD56 but negative for CD4. The chromosomal abnormality  isochromosome 7q has been 
reported in many cases (Alonsozana, 1997; Kotylar, 2010).  Recentl y, in an analysis of HSTCL  
cases, some of which included paired germline DNA, mutations were commonly  found in the 
genes SETD2, INO80, STAT5B, SMARCA2, TET3, and PIK3CD ( McKinney , 2017).
1.3. Overall Rationale for the Study
While there is no formal hypothesis to be tested in this study , the samples collected during this 
study  will be used to explor e several possible hypotheses for the development of HSTCL 
reported in IBD patients. Methods such as genome sequencing (Chapman, 2011; Ng, 2010), 
mRNA gene expression microarray  profiles (Miyazaki, 2009) ,and multiplex analy sis of serum 
proteins may  be used to identify  these biomarkers.
1.Genes that increase susceptibility for developi[INVESTIGATOR_469944].   The 
incidence of HSTCL  is approximately  100-fold greater in IBD patients compared with 
the general population (Herrington, 2011).  Therefore, IBD susceptibility  genes identified 
through genome -wide association studies (Franke, 2010; McGovern, 2010) may also be 
susceptibility  genes for HSTCL .
2.Genes that are part of the TNF signaling pathway.   Altho ugh HSTCL is generall y
observed in infliximab -treated IBD patients who received infliximab in combination with 
a thiopurine, TNF blockade may also increase susceptibility  for developi[INVESTIGATOR_469945] . Therefore, genes that are part of the TNF signaling 
pathway  may  also influence susceptibility  forHSTCL . 
REMICADE® (infliximab); SIMPONI® (golimumab) Protocol Amendment 3REMICADELYM4001
10
Approved 11Aug 2017 CONFIDENTIAL3.Genes whose expression is significantly different than other T-cell lymphomas.   The 
majority  of HSTCL in infliximab -treated IBD patients are known to be γ/Vδ1 T-cell 
clones, although α/β T-cell clones have also been reported (Mackey , 2009). One group 
(Miy azaki, 2009) studied the gene expression profile of peripheral T -cell lymphomas and 
identified a distinctive profile for 5 cases of HSTCL , including 4 cases that were γ/δ 
lymphoma s and 1 case that was α/β T-cell lymphoma. Others have found that mutations 
that occur frequentl y in other T cell lymphomas in genes such as RHOA , CD28 and 
CCR4 were either absent or occurred at a much lower frequency  in HSTCLs (McKinney , 
2017). Recognizin g HSTCL  tumor cell genes with significantl y different expression 
compared with other types of T-cell lymphomas suggests these genes might influence 
susceptibility  for development of HSTCL . 
4.Genes that are part of the DNA mismatch repair pathway.   Thiopurin es are mutagens that 
cause base pair mismatches when incorporated into replicating DNA; these are corrected 
by [CONTACT_469975]  (Hsieh, 2008). One group (Nyugen, 2009) 
investigated the frequency  and spectra of somatic mutation events at the hypoxanthine -
guanine phosphoribos yltransferase (HPRT) locus in T-cells from IBD patients. 
Thiopurine treatment resulted in a total dose-dependent (p<0.001) and duration of 
treatment -dependent (p<0.001) increase in the frequency  of somatic mutations. Mutati ons 
in genes from the DNA mismatch repair pathway might increase the mutation rate due to 
thiopurine treatment and thereb y increase the risk of HSTCL . 
5.Cytogenetic abnormalities.   Chromosomal abnormalities often associated with HSTCL  
include isochromosome 7q and trisomy  8 (Jonveaux, 1996); these abnormalities were 
also reported in IBD patients who developed HSTCL  (Kotylar, 2010). The copy  number 
or expression level of genes influenced by [CONTACT_469976] .

[ADDRESS_602363] METHODS AND DA TA ANALYSIS
In consultation with the Scientific Advisory  Committee (see Section 5.3), a detailed anal ysis plan 
will be written and statistica l analysis will be done by [CONTACT_469981] y of the 
sponsor. A general description of the statistical methods to be used is outlined below. Specific 
details will be provided in the Statistical Analy sis Plan.
Descriptive statistics of demog raphic information , information on medical/surgical (including 
treatment) history ,and baseline characteristics at the time of HSTCL diagnosis will be 
summarized for all patient s enrolled in thisstudy.  Protein assay  data will be summarized using 
descript ive statistics. Gene expression in tumor cells may be compared with expression levels 
observed in normal tissue surrounding the tumor or in bowel tissue sample ,or with cells isolated 
from whole blood orfrom buccal swabs with moderated t-statistics or other appropriate 
statistical methods.
Full genome or targeted sequencing may also be used to reveal patterns of mutations responsible 
for development of HSTCL. Somatic mutations will be identified by [CONTACT_469982] e following : 
The normal adjacent tissue from the same biops y specimen ,or 
The bowel tissue sample ,or
Cells isolated from the buccal swab ,or 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells . 
Individual mutations will be tabulated within and between patient s and cross-referenced with 
human variation databases (eg, COSMI C, dbSNP, etc.). To identify  cancer driver genes or 
pathway s, somatic mutation frequencies will be evaluated per gene or pathway  across all patients 
with HSTCL  and compared with empi[INVESTIGATOR_469942] 
(Wendl, 2011; Youn, 2011).  
7. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
Timely , accurate, and complete reporting and analy sis of safety  information from clinical studies 
are crucial for the protection of patient s, investigators, and the sponsor , and are mandated by 
[CONTACT_23824]. The sponsor has established Standard Operating Procedures in 
conformity  with regulatory  requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safet y 
information; all clinical studies conducted by [CONTACT_43765].
During the conduct of this study , adverse events may be reported that are related to venipuncture 
for blood sample collection or buccal swab collection as described in Section 7.2.

Approved 11Aug 2017 CONFIDENTIAL7.1. Definitions
For the purposes of this study , and in accordance with I CH and the s ponsor’s safety  reporting 
guidelines, the following d efinitions will apply .
Adverse Event
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  patient administered a 
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessaril y 
have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any  unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), sy mptom, or disease temporally  associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not 
related to that medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. (Definition per ICH)
This includes any  occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency  from the 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory  test 
abnormalities.
Note: The sponsor collects adverse events starting with the signing of the informed consent form .
Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event based on ICH and European Union (EU)Guidance on 
Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence 
that at an y dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening
(The patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetic ally might have caused death if it were more severe.)
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
Is a suspected transmission of an y infectious agent via a medicinal product
Is medicall y important*
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
also appropriate in other situations , such as important medical events that might not be 
immediately  life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_469948]. These should 
usually  be considered serious.
For reports of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n, it is the sign, symptom ,or diagnosis which led to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_469949].

Approved 11Aug 2017 CONFIDENTIAL7.2. Reporting and Follow -up of Serious A dverse Events
The sponsor assumes responsibility  for appropriate reporting of adverse events to the regulatory  
authorities. The investigator (or sponsor where required) must report these events to the 
appropriate IRB/IECthat approved the protocol unless otherwise required and documented by 
[CONTACT_1201]/IEC.
Adverse events that are associated with study  interventions (eg, bruising or infection at 
venipuncture site, fainting, irritation, and bleeding at the inside of the cheek from the buccal 
swab) will be captu red within the study  database. All other adverse e vents/serious adverse events
that are identified through the study  data collection processes and not associated with study  
interventions ( eg,blood draw , buccal swabbing ) will be reported as solicited reports.  
All serious adverse events that are consider ed as related to study  intervention (eg, venipuncture)
will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or follow -up is no longer possible .

1.2. Hepatosplenic T -cell 
Lymphoma (revised paragraphs 1 
through 3 ) Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) is a rare and 
aggressive subtype of peripheral T -cell lymphoma with a 
poor prognosis (Herrinton, 2011; de Leval, 2011). 
HSTCL generally shows T cell proliferation, particularly 
in the sinusoids of the liver or spleen, without lymph 
node enlargement. It is also occasionally diagnosed 
through bone marrow  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706], later in its course, 
malignant T-cells can be found in peripheral blood. In 
the US, the incidence is approximately 0.3 cases per 
million person -years in the general population. How ever, 
in patients with immune mediated conditions such as 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD ) or acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome, the incidence increases as much as 
100-fold. HSTCL has also been reported in organ 
transplant patients (Tey , 2008). DNA, RNA, or protein 
biomarkers may provide a method to identify patients 
predisposed to develop HSTCL or may allow earlier 
diagnosis of HSTCL in these patient populations.
Literature describing the clinical and presenting features 
of patients with HSTCL has recently been reviewed 
(Tripi[CONTACT_17388], 2009). Diagnosis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_469960] , liver, or spleen biopsy using histologic, 
flow cytom etric and cytogenetic analyse s. The tumor 
cells are generally γ/δ T cells with a Vδ1 variable region, 
positive for CD3 and occasionally positive for CD8 or Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphom a (HSTCL) is a rare and 
aggressive subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma with a poor 
prognosis (Herrinton, 2011; de Leval, 2011). HSTCL 
generally shows T cell proliferation, particularly in the

(IBD) or acquired immune d eficiency syndrome, the incidence 
increases as much as 100-fold. HSTCL has also been reported 
in organ transplant patients (Tey, 2008). DNA, RNA, or 
protein biomarkers may provide a method to identify patients 
predisposed to develop HSTCL. or may allow earlier 
diagnosis of HSTCL in these patient population..
Specific risk factors that contribute to HSTCL in patients 
with IBD have been reviewed (Kotylar, 2010; Kotylar, 2011), 
and include gender (> 90% male); age (90% under 35 years 
of age); treatment with thiopurines such as 6-
mercaptopurine or azathioprine (100%); treatment with a 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor such as infliximab 
(REMICADE®; 56%, all with concomitant thiopurine 
treatment); and duration of thiopurine treatment (97% >2

abnormality isochromosome 7q has been reported in 
many cases (Alonsozana, 1997; Kotlya r, 2010).   
Specific risk factors that contribute to HSTCL in patients 
with IBD have been revie wed (Koltyar, 2010; Koltyar, 
2011). These specific risk factors in IBD include gender 
(>90% male); age (90% under 35 years of age); 
treatment with thiopurines such as 6-mercaptopurine or 
azathioprine (100%); and treatment with a tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor such as infliximab 
(REMICADE®; 56%, all with concomitant thiopurine 
treatment); and duration of thiopurine treatment (97% >2 
years). Of note, no cases of HSTCL have been reported 
in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with infliximab 
(Koltyar, 2010; Herrinton, 2011).years). HSTCL has also been reported in patients treated 
with other TNF inhibitors such as adalimumab (Ochenrider, 
2010), and other monoclonal antibodies with other 
mechanisms of action such as natalizumab (Kotylar, 2010). 
Although most published cases of HSTCL have occurr ed in 
immunocompromised individuals, a recent study describes 
some patients with no history of immune -related 
comorbidities or immunosuppressive therapy (Voss, 2013). 
Literature describing the clinical and presenting features of 
patients with HSTCL has recently been reviewed (Tripi[CONTACT_17388], 
2009). Diagnosis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_469961], 
liver, or spleen biopsy using histologic, flow cytometric, and 
cytogenetic analyses. The tumor cells are generally γ/δ T 
cells with a Vδ1 variable region, positive for CD3 and 
occasionally positive for CD8 or CD56 but negative for CD4. 
The chromosomal abnormality isochromosome 7q has been 
reported in many cases (Alonsozana, 1997; Kotylar, 2010).
1.3. Overall Rationale for the Study 
(Number 2) Although HSTCL is only observed in infliximab -treated 
IBD patients who received infliximab in combination 
with a thiopurine, TNF blockade may also increase 
susceptibility for developi[INVESTIGATOR_469941]. Therefore, genes 
that are part of the TNF signaling pathway may also 
influence susceptibil ity for HSTCL.Although HSTCL is generally observed in infliximab -treated 
IBD patients who received infliximab in combination with a 
thiopurine, TNF blockade may also increase susceptibility for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_469962] . 
Therefor e, genes that are part of the TNF signaling pathway  
may also influence susceptibility for HSTCL.

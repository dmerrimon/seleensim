in approximately  16 subjects. Since subjects maybe replaced if they 
are withdrawn due  to major protocol violations, it is estimated a  
maximum of 20 subjects maybe be dosed .  These numbers will be 
appropriate for a preliminary evaluation of safety and tolerability, 
provision of PK profiles of APD371 at two doses and exploratory 
analysis of efficacy end points.  
Safety 
Assessments:  • Adverse event reporting to include ; Treatment Emergent Adverse 
Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction ( S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  
• Clinical laboratory tests to include ; hematol ogy, serum chemistry, 
and urinalysis   
• Physical examinations  
• Vital sign measurements  
• 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
Pharmacokinetic 
Assessments:  Blood samples for the assay of APD371 and metabolites M1  
, M2 , and M4  will be 
collected at the following time  points:  
• Wk 0 (Day 1) : prior to and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 (prior to second daily 
dose), [ADDRESS_297244] daily dose.  
• Wk 2, 4, and 6: prior to first daily dose  
• Wk 8 (Day -1, last day dosing): prior to and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 (prior

The two main types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are ulcerative colitis (UC), 
which is limited to the colon, and Crohn’s disease (CD), which can affect any 
segment of the gastrointestinal tract. In both types the most common symptoms are 
diarrhea and  abdominal pain. Treatments for pain associated with IBD that are  
currently available have been borrowed from other pain conditions and are not 
specific for abdominal pain.  They include opi[INVESTIGATOR_244279]/tachyphylaxis , addiction and abuse, and potentially fatal 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], gabapentinoids that are safer than opi[INVESTIGATOR_244280], tricyclic antidepressants that show some efficacy but can 
also produce somnolence, hypotension, and arrhythmias, and non -steroidal anti -
inflammatories (NSAIDs; drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen) which when 
administered long term may be associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal 
injury/bleeding, cardiac events, hypertension, kidney injury, a nd death. Due to the 
limitations and side -effects of currently available treatments for abdominal pain, there 
is a need for an alternative approach  to targeted pain management, especially for 
abdominal pain , that  is poorly managed in IBD due to limited spe cific options.  New 
research suggests the etiology of abdominal pain in IBD arises from  dysregulat ion of 
the endoc annabinoid system , offering the promise of a novel therapeutic target . 
APD371 is a n ew chemical entity developed by [CONTACT_155864], Inc. for the 
treatment of abdominal pain due to IBD  which includes CD . APD371 is an  orally 
available, selective cannabinoid -2 (CB 2) receptor agonist .  
The CB 2 receptor is a member of a family of G  protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 
that mediate the effects of several structurally related endocannabinoids such as 
anandamide and 2 -arachidonolglycerol .1,2 Although expression of CB 2 was initially 
thought to be predominantly restricted to immune cells in the periphery, recent data 
suggests that this receptor is also expressed in the nervous system  in perivascular 
microglial cells and in brainstem neurons. CB 2 is up -regulated in both dorsal root 
ganglia and peripheral neurons following injury.3 Preclinical data  using CB 2 agonists 
and receptor knockout mice has validated the receptor as a potential target for the 
treatment of pain and neuro -inflammation.4,5 However, the therapeutic utility of non -
selective, b rain penetrable cannabinoid agonists is limited by [CONTACT_244314] -1 receptor  (CB 1). 
Such side -effects are not apparent upon CB [ADDRESS_297262] with

Amendment 02 ([ADDRESS_297263] 2017 ) Confidential   Page 18 of 67 The e fficacy of APD371 in alleviating pain was evaluated in multiple rodent models  
of chronic pain, including  the monosodium iodoacetate  (MIA) -induced model of 
osteoarthri tic joint pain, which shares similar pathophysiology with clinical 
osteoarthritis  in humans . When administered to rats by [CONTACT_244315] , APD371 significantly suppressed 
allodynia induced with MIA . APD371 -induced analgesia was maintained after 
animals were pretreated with rimonabant (CB [ADDRESS_297264]) or naloxone 
(µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_244281]) but not with (CB [ADDRESS_297265]), 
demonstrating on -target selectivity of APD371 in vivo.6 Subchronic and continuous -
infusion dosing with APD371 did not induce tachyphylaxis.  The efficacy of APD371 
in alleviating pain was also demonstrated in the paclitaxel -induced rodent model of 
neuropathic pain  and the painful peripheral neuropathy rodent models of type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes.  
 
1.1 Rationale for Proposed Clinical Study  
The Cannabinoid system in IBD is dysregulated1 and the enzymes that breakdown 
endocannabinoids (e.g. , fatty acid amid e hydrolase -FAAH) are increased in active 
inflammatory Crohn’s disease. The enzymes th at synthesize endocannabinoids (e.g., 
N -acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine -specific phospholipase -NAPE -PLD) are 
decreased in active inflamma tory Crohn’s disease and s ome en docannabinoids are 
decreased in active inflammatory IBD . 
The CB 2 receptors are located in the target tissue gastrointestinal (GI) cells and local 
immune cells in both humans and in rodents10 and are found in epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] , 
immune cells , and in enteric neurons where CB 2 mediated sensitivity is observed at 
visceral afferent nerve endings10. 
The CB 2 receptor is increased in the ulcerative margin in Crohn’s  disease,[ADDRESS_297266] been shown to be effective in clinical trials for Crohn’s pain. For 
example, c annabis has been demonstrated to induce  a clinical response in patients 
with Crohn's disease in a prospective placebo -controlled study ,11 and treatment of 
Crohn's disease with cannabis in an observational study showed improvements in the 
pain score .[ADDRESS_297267] is blocked in CB 2 knockouts13. Similarly, a reduction of 
intestinal pain by [CONTACT_244316]  (LCFM) administration in a 
butyrate -induced model of colonic hyperse nsitivity  is blocked by a CB 2 receptor 
Antagonist14. 
 
Arena has completed two phase 1 studies  with APD371. The aim of both studies was 
to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of APD371 across a range of

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a Phase 2a study in subjects  diagnosed with abdominal pain due to quiescent to 
mildly active CD.  The study design is a randomized, multi  center, open -label, group 
comparison  consisting of two cohorts dosed with  APD371 in approximately  16 
subjects  (8 subjects  in each cohort) . Randomiz ation will be stratified by [CONTACT_4321] . A study 
plan is provided in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. APD371 -[ADDRESS_297272].  If the ir AAPS  is >4 and they satisfy all other eligibility 
criteria, they will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive  APD371 doses of 25 mg or 
100 mg  capsules TID for 8 weeks  (until Day 56).  
Eligible subjects will be randomized and on Day [ADDRESS_297273] two weeks and then once every other week  until the end of the treatment 
period . Safety assessments will inclu de physical examinations, AE reporting, vital 
signs, 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs)  and clinical la boratory tests including 
blood sampling.  
 
Subjects will record their APS during Screening twice daily for at least 7 consecutive 
days within the Screenin g period (Day -28 to Day -1); early morning and late evening,

record their APS three times a day on each treatment Day (Day 1 to Wk 8 ), before the 
morning dose, at 1.[ADDRESS_297275] their stool frequency  on a daily basis.  
 
There will be two serial PK assessments; one at the beginning of the study Wk 0 (Day 
1, 2) and another at the end of the study Wk 8 (Day -1) and Wk 8. A single PK 
collection will be performed in the clinic prior to the subject’s first daily dose on Wks 
2, 4 and 6.  A final PK sample collection will be performed at the follow -up visit will 
occur on Wk 10.   If subjects discontinue the study (Early  Termination), a final PK 
sample will be collected .

The schedule of procedures and visits for the study is provided in Table  1. 
3.3 Rationale for Study Design  
As described in Section 1.1, APD371 has previously been administered to healthy 
adult subjects at single doses of up to 400 mg  and in multiple dose of up to 200  mg 
for 10 days TID . This proposed m ultiple -dose study is  primarily designed to evaluate 
the safety , tolerability , and PK  of two oral doses of APD371 in patients with CD with 
abdominal pain in order to provide reliable safety, tolerability, and PK data that will 
guide drug dose and therapeutic regimen choices in subsequent clinical studies .

The abdominal pain s core (A PS) is a PRO  using an NCR rating scale which is recorded in a 
subject  diary.  The 11 point NCR scale ranges from 0 [no abdominal pain] to 10 [worst 
possible abdominal pain] will be recorded by [CONTACT_132149] a diary as follows;  
During Screening.  Twice daily for at least 7 consecutive days within the initial Screening 
period (Day -28 to Day -1), at the following times;  
1. Early morning, approximately 06:00 - 08:00  
2. Late evening, approximately 20:00  - 22:00.  
 
The Screening assessment of AAPS will be based on the average of the last (most recent) 7 
days of morning and evening diary records within the screening period.  
During Treatm ent. Three times a day on each treatment Day (Day 1 to 56) at the foll owing 
times;  
1. Before the morning dose and before any other morning dose study procedures  
2. Approximately a t 1.5 hours after the morning dose  
3. Before the evening dose.  
Note: Subjects will also be required to complete the diary before their first mo rning dose on 
Wk 0 (Day 1) , and at the End-of-Treatment Visit at Wk 8 in the early morning (06:00 - 
08:00).  If a subject discontinues the study, Early Termination, the APS score will be 
assessed.  
The average abdominal p ain Score ( AAPS) is the average of t he APS score over ea ch weekly 
assessment period (W k 1 to Wk  8). These average score s will be determined automatically in 
the eCRF from the diary cards  records inserted into the eCRF.

ICH Guideline “Note for Guidan ce on Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and 
Stand ards for Expedited Reporting.”  
5.12.1  Adverse Event Reporting  
Subjects will be instructed that they may report AEs at any time . Adverse event s will be 
regarded as ‘pre -treatment’ if they occur between  the Screening Visit and the time of 
administration of the first dose of study medication . All events reported following study 
medication administration will be recorded as TEAEs . 
Monitoring of AEs will be continued up to [ADDRESS_297330]  study medic ation 
administration . In the event that an AE is not resolved or stabilized by [CONTACT_159753], the Sponsor 
in consultation with the Investigator will decide whether to continue to monitor the AE or 
close -out the event in the database if no further follow -up is necessary.

Clinical Trial Protocol:  APD371 -004    
Amendment 02 ([ADDRESS_297331]  2017)  Confidential  Page 44 of 67 For this study, an AE is defined as: “Any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject 
administered any dose of study medication (APD3 71) and which does not necessarily have to 
have a causal rela tionship with this treatment.” An AE can therefo re be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of the study medication, whether or not related to the product. AEs 
can be any of the following:  
• Unfavorable change s in general condition ; 
• Subjective or objective signs/symptoms ; 
• Concomitant disease or accident;  
• Clinically relevant adverse changes in laboratory parameters observed in a subject 
in the course of a clinical study ; 
• Pre-existing conditions which worsen in s everity or frequency or which have new 
signs/symptoms associated with them . 
Adverse events may be elicited by [CONTACT_244330]: “Since you were last asked, have you 
felt unwell or different from usual in any way?” Any adverse or unexpected events, signs  and 
symptoms, will be fully recorded on the A E Form including details of severity , onset, 
duration, outcome and relationship to the drug as determine d by [CONTACT_737] . Whenever 
possible, a constellation of signs and symptoms should be recorded as a un ifying diagnosis 
(e.g., self-limited  fever, runny nose, cough, and scratchy throat should be captured as an 
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_244290] i ndividual signs and symptoms). Adverse 
event s may  also be reported at any time. The type and duratio n of follow -up of subjects after 
AEs will be documented.

The severity of each AE will be assessed at onse t by a nurse and/or physician. When 
recording the outcome of the AE the maximum severity of the AE ex perienced will also be 
recorded. The severity of the AE will be graded according to the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v4.0317 definitions, listed below:  
Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated;  
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasiv e intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) *; 
Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening;

the telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the 
toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.  
 
5.12.[ADDRESS_297339](s) will be classified using modified 
World Health Organization ( WHO ) criteria (Edwards and Biriell, World Health Organization 
Collaborating Cent re for International Drug Monitoring 1994) as follows.  
Rela ted:  a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on  
withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this 
definition ; or an event  that could also be explained by [CONTACT_244334] i nformation on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Not related :  a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with sufficient 
evidence to accept that there is no causal relationship to drug administration (e.g., no 
temporal relationship to drug administration, because the drug was administered afte r 
onset of event; investigation shows that the drug was not administered; proof of other 
cause; etc.) ; or an event with a temporal relationship to drug administration which makes 
a causal relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or unde rlying 
disease provide plausible explanations .

7.1 Data Collection  
All data will be collected according to the Sponsor or CRO’s SOPs.  
Upon databas e lock, to include resolution of all queries, the CRO, if applicable, will provide 
SAS Transport Files (SAS XPT) datasets to the Sponsor and to the biostatistician for analysis 
using secure electronic data transfer per the Sponsor’s specifications.  
7.2 Data Co ding  
7.2.1  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA ; version 18.0 or later ) and tabulated, including categorical information of interest 
such as onset and resolution times, time of onset relative to dose, severity at onset, maximum 
severity, causal relationship to study  medication, and action taken. Whenever possible, a 
constellation of signs and symptoms should be recorded as a unifying diagnosis (e.g., 
self-limited  fever, runny nose, cough, and s cratchy throat should be captured as an upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_244290] i ndividual signs and symptoms). Adverse event s will 
be regarded as ‘pre -treatment’ if they occur between Screening and the time of 
administration of the first dose of study medication . All other AEs that occur after the first 
dose of study medication will be considered to be ‘treatment -emergent’.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_297366] naming convention is 
required in order to t abulate this data effectively. A common method of standardization is to 
categorize medica tions by [CONTACT_244339]. In order to do this, medications will be coded 
using the W HO Drug Dictionary, Format C.  
7.2.3  Medical History  
Medical history will b e coded using MedDRA (version 18.0 or later).

decrease will be closely monitored.  If such an AE occurs in patients taking the study drug, the Investigator must 
assess whether the AE meets the study drug interruption/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_244304] .     
If the study drug is interrupted due to the criteria described in the table, the patient will be evaluated as par t of an 
unscheduled visit to assess their status and the Investigator will determine next course of action.  If necessary, 
subsequent visits to assess the outcome of the event will be scheduled.  Once the re -start criteria are met, study drug 
will be re -started under medical supervision.  Additional visits may be scheduled at the investigator’s discretion to 
more closely monitor patient status.  
Any patient that develops postural hypotension will not be discharged from the clinical research unit with study d rug 
until the event completely resolves and safety and tolerability of the reduced dose in the patient is confirmed.

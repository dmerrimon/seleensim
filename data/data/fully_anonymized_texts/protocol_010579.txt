 3. SYNOPSIS 
Protocol Number:  109MS31 0 
Protocol Title:  An Open -Label Study to Assess the Effects of BG00012 on 
Lymphocyte Subsets in Subjects With Relapsing -Remitting 
Multiple Sclerosis  
Version Number  2 
Name [CONTACT_71413]:  BG00012 (dimethyl fumarate [DMF]; Tecfidera®) 
Study Indicatio n: Multiple sclerosis (MS)  
Study Rationale  Given the putative immunomodulatory properties of DMF 
and its observed effects on lymphocytes in humans, further 
evaluation of its effects on immune function is needed.  The 
effect of BG00012 on lymphocyte subtyp es is yet unknown, 
and its evaluation may provide insights into the mechanisms 
underlying BG00012 -associated lymphopenia .  This study is 
therefore being conducted to assess the effects of BG00012 
on lymphocyte subset counts and immunoglobulins (Igs) 
within  the first year of treatment and until the end of the 
study.  
Phase of Development:  3b 
Study Objectives and 
Endpoints:  The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect 
of BG00012 on lymphocyte subset counts during the first 
year of treatment i n subjects with relapse -remitting MS 
(RRMS).  
The primary endpoint that relates to this objective is the 
change in lymphocyte subset counts for up to [ADDRESS_539007] of BG00012 on absolute lymphocyte  counts (ALCs) 
and Igs during the first year of treatment.  
The endpoints that relate to this objective are the changes in 
IgG isotypes and ALCs for up to 48  weeks.  
 
 
Study Design:  This is an open -label, multicenter study to evaluate the

 effects of BG00012 on lymphocyte subtypes and Ig 
isotypes.   
After the Screening Visit (up to 28 days ), if required per 
local guidelines and if not already available w ithin the 
previous 3 months, a magnetic resonance imaging scan 
should be performed locally before starting therapy with 
BG00012.   Subjects will then receive BG00012 treatment 
for 96 weeks twice daily (BID).  Blood samples for 
lymphocyte subset analysis, as  well as blood samples for the 
determination of each subject’s complete blood count with 
differential, will be collected at Screening, Baseline (Day 1), 
and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 (complete blood count 
[CBC ] only), 72, 84 (CBC only),  and 96.  Clini cal samples 
for the analysis of blood chemistries will be collected at 
Screening, Baseline (Day 1), and Weeks 4, 8, 24, 48, and 
96.  A post -treatment follow -up visit at which safety 
assessments will be performed will occur 4 weeks after the 
final dose of B G00012.   
Subjects who develop a confirmed lymphocyte count of 
<500 cells/mm3 at any time during the study will be 
monitored every 4 weeks.   If the lymphocyte count stays 
<500 cells/mm3 for [ADDRESS_539009] will temporarily 
withhold study treatment.  If the lymphocyte count does not 
recover to ≥ the lower limit of normal ( LLN ) within an 
additional [ADDRESS_539010] a lymphocyte count <LLN will 
continue protocol -required visits and assessments and will 
also be followed every 4 weeks for 24  weeks, then every 
12 weeks (unless clinically indicated more often or at the 
Investigator’s discretion ) until the lymphocyte count is 
≥LLN , or for up to 48 weeks following drug 
discontinuation, whichever occurs sooner.   
Subjects whose lymphocyte counts are <LLN at the end of 
the study (Week 96) will complete the final Follow -Up Visit 
and will then be follo wed up outside of this protocol at the 
Investigator’s discretion.   
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_426572] 109MS310 Version [ADDRESS_539011] permanent ly discontinued BG00012  for any 
reason . 
Subjects who withdraw from the study while on study 
treatment will complete the Discontinuation and/or 
Withdrawal Visit as soon as possible but no later than 
[ADDRESS_539012]  
dose of study treatment unless consent has been withdrawn.    
Subjects who withdraw from the study f or reasons other 
than safety may be replaced at the discretion of Biogen.  
Refer to Table  1 and Table  2 for the timing of all study 
assessments.  
Study Location:  Approximately 100 sites in North America and Europe  
Number of Planned Subjects:  Approximately 200 subjects wi ll be treated.  
Study Population:  This study will be conducted in male and female subjects, 
aged 18 through 65 years, with a confirmed diagnosis of 
RRMS according to the revised McDonald criteria (2010) 
[Polman 2011 ]. 
Detailed criteria are described in Section 8. 
Treatment Groups:  Approximately [ADDRESS_539013] 7 days and at a 
maintenance dose of 240 mg BID thereafter.  Temporary 
dose reductions to 120 mg BID may be considered for 
individuals who do not tolerate the maintenance dose due to 
flushing and /or gastrointestinal disturbances .  Within

Protocol 109MS310 Version [ADDRESS_539031]’s normal activities of daily living should be avoided for [ADDRESS_539032] formulation containing the active ingredient dimethyl 
fumarate (DMF).  In 2013, BG00012 was first approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) under the 
propriety name [CONTACT_254126]® as a treatment for patients with relapsing MS and has since been 
a
pproved in other countries. 
5.1. Overview of Multiple Sclerosis 
MS is a chronic autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system 
(CNS) tha
t is characterized by [CONTACT_2898], demyelination, and oligodendrocyte and neuronal 
loss.  It is the most common demyelinating disorder of the CNS, affecting approximately 
2.[ADDRESS_539033] among Caucasians, with higher rates 
re
ported in North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and northern Asia [Noseworthy 
2000; R osati 2001 ].   
Relapsing MS is the most common clinical presentation of the disease.  The term relapsing MS 
applies to patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or secondary progressive MS (SPMS) 
who e
xperience relapses; both are considered part of the same disease spectrum.  In the 
relapsing/remitting phase of the disease, patients experience epi[INVESTIGATOR_426574] (relapses) separated by [CONTACT_426591].  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_426575], sensory loss, visual loss, and imbalance.  Relapses may completely subside in 
the early stage of the disease, but recovery tends to be incomplete over time, leading to the 
accumulation of physical disability and cognitive decline.  RRMS is usually diagnosed between 
the a
ges of 20 and 40 years and affects twice as many women than men.  The RRMS population 
ra
nges from patients with relatively benign, inactive, non-inflammatory disease to patients who 
experience frequent relapse and/or persistent, active, inflammatory disease.  Most of these 
patients develop SPMS, which is characterized by [CONTACT_426592]; the median time to progression from RRMS to SPMS is 
approximately 10 years [Runmarker and Andersen 1993 ].  Approximately half of all MS patients 
are unable to walk without assistance within 15 years of their initial diagnosis [Runmarker and 
Andersen 1993; Weinshenker 1989 ], and more than half of patients die from MS or its 
complications [Brønnum-Hansen 2004 ]. 
As patients progress along the continuum from RRMS to SPMS, disability progression is more 
likely to occur independently of relapses.  The pathological changes underlying MS are thought 
to occur when activated T lymphocytes cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and initiate a series 
of events leading to activation of endothelial cells, recruitment of additional lymphocytes and 
monocytes, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  MS lesions consisting of immune cells 
can occur throughout the CNS, but certain sites appear to be particularly vulnerable, such as the 
opti
c nerve, brainstem, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], and periventricular regions of the cerebrum.  The 
development of MS lesions is associated with inflammation, edema, and demyelination, and is 
often correlated with reversible disease symptoms, namely relapses, as well as oligodendrocyte 
death and axonal transection, which can be permanent and lead to disability.  Alternatively, 
oli
godendrocyte and axonal loss may be due to a neurodegenerative process.  Ongoing 
Protocol 109MS310 Version [ADDRESS_539034] in part by [CONTACT_426593].  Preclinical studies indicate that BG00012-dependent pharmacodynamic responses appear 
to be mediated through activation of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) 
transcriptional pathway, which is the primary cellular defense system for responding to a variety

migration of inflammatory cells from the bloodstream across the BBB and into the CNS is 
thought to be an early and critical step in this process.

[CONTACT_3450] 27% to 36% [ Calabresi 2014 ; J acobs 1996 ; PRISMS Study Group 1998 ; The 
IFNB Multiple Sclerosis Study Group 1993 ], and GA by [CONTACT_3450] 30% [Johnson 1995 ].  
The interferon beta-1a (IFN -1a) products have also been shown to delay disability progression

5.3. Profile of Previous Experience With BG00012 
5.3.1. Nonclin ical Experience 
In nonclinical studies, DMF and its primary metabolite, monomethyl fumarate, were found to 
pr
omote stabilization and transcriptional activity of Nrf2, as well as expression of Nrf2 target 
genes in cultured human cells and in vivo [Linker 2011 ].  Previous ex vivo and in vivo studies 
have demonstrated a central role of the Nrf2 pathway in the protection of cells and tissues against 
oxidative, xenobiotic, and inflammatory stress.  Loss of Nrf2 function via genetic silencing has 
be
en shown to cause exaggerated inflammatory response and lead to development of systemic 
autoimmunity and CNS alterations, including widespread gliosis and white matter lesions.  
Conversely, pharmacological agents known to activate Nrf2 have been shown in nonclinical 
studi
es to exert anti-inflammatory effects, protect neurons from oxidative and excitotoxic stress-

5.3.2. Clin ical Experience 
In the Phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled safety and efficacy studies (the completed 6-month 
Phase 2 Study C-1900 Part 1 and the 2 completed 2-year Phase 3 Studies 109MS301 and 
109MS
302) and/or their uncontrolled extensions (the completed 6-month Phase 2 Study C-1900 
Part 2 and the ongoing Phase 3 long-term Study 109MS303) over [ADDRESS_539037] efficacy and a favorable safety profile in subjects with RRMS in the 
2 large Phase 3 studies (Study 109MS301 [DEFINE] [Gold 2012a ] and Study 109MS302 
[
CONFIRM] [ F ox 2012 ]).  The benefit-risk profile of DMF was considered positive, and the 
drug has been approved. 
Both Phase 3 studies demonstrated that treatment with DMF reduced the risk of MS relapse and 
slowed progression of disability.  In an integrated analysis of DEFINE and CONFIRM, DMF 
240 mg twice daily (BID) and 3 times daily significantly reduced the annualized relapse rate at 
2 years by 49% relative to placebo (p<0.0001).  Significant reductions at 2 years were also 
obser
ved in the proportion of subjects who relapsed (43% and 47%, respectively; p<0.0001), the 
proportion of subjects with confirmed (12-week) progression of disability (32% and 30%, 
respectively; p<0.01), and the proportion of subjects with confirmed (24-week) progression of 
disability (29% and 32%, respectively; p<0.03) [Gold 2012b ].  
DMF was generally well tolerated and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile.  The most 
common AEs associated with DMF were flushing and gastrointestinal (GI) events.  In subjects 
who e
xperienced these types of events, the events were generally mild or moderate in intensity, 
tended to decrease in incidence after the first month, and only infrequently led to treatment 
discontinuation.  There are a number of potential management strategies for these side effects.  
I
n the Phase 2 and 3 controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies in subjects with RRMS, 
BG00012 treatment was associated with a gradual decrease from baseline in mean leukocyte 
counts driven primarily by [CONTACT_426596]; mean lymphocyte counts 
decreased by [CONTACT_3450] 30% of their baseline value after [ADDRESS_539038] been observed with BG00012 treatment, in the placebo controlled Phase 2 and 3 studies 
BG00012 was not associated with an increased risk of infection, serious infection, or 
oppor
tunistic infection compared with placebo.  However, in the long-term extension study 
(109MS303), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has occurred in the setting of 
severe, prolonged lymphopenia following BG00012 administration.  PML has also been reported 
in the postmarketing setting in the presence of prolonged moderate to severe lymphopenia.  The 
majority of all cases occurred in patients with lymphocyte counts <0.5 × 109/L.  With open-label

 and marketed use of BG00012, there has been no other evidence of an increased risk of 
infections, serious infections, or opportunistic infections.   
See the Investigator’s Brochure for detailed information on clinical studies. 
5.4. Study Rationale 
Given the putative immunomodulatory properties of DMF and its observed effects on 
lymphocytes in humans, further evaluation of its effects on lymphocytes is needed.  The effect of 
B
G00012 on lymphocyte subtypes is yet unknown, and its evaluation may provide insights into 
the mechanisms underlying BG00012-associated lymphopenia.  This study is therefore being 
conducted to assess the effects of BG00012 on lymphocyte subset counts and immunoglobulins 
(Igs) within the first year of treatment and beyond.  
5
.5. Rationale for Dosing Regimen 
The BG00012 dosage selected for this study ([ADDRESS_539040] 7 days and 240 mg BID 
ther
eafter) is the approved BG00012 dosing regimen in the US, Canada, European Union, and 
other countries around the world for the treatment of patients with MS.   
Te
mporary dose reductions to 120 mg BID may be considered for individuals who do not 
tol
erate the maintenance dose due to flushing and/or GI disturbances.  Within [ADDRESS_539041] of BG00012 on absolute

 7. STUDY DESIGN 
7.1. Study Overview 
This is an open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the effects of BG00012 on lymphocyte 
subtypes and Ig isotypes.  Approximately 200 subjects will be treated in approximately 100 sites 
in North America and Europe. 
Af
ter the Screening Visit (up to 28 days) if required per local guidelines and if not already 
a
vailable within the previous 3 months, a magnetic resonance imaging scan should be performed 
locally before starting therapy with BG00012.  Subjects will then receive BG00012 treatment for 
96 weeks (Treatment Period).  Blood samples for lymphocyte subset analysis, as well as blood 
sa
mples for the determination of each subject’s complete blood count with differential, will be 
collected at Screening, Baseline (Day 1), and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 (complete blood 
c
ount [CBC only]), 72, 84 (CBC only), and 96.  Clinical samples for the analysis of blood 
c
hemistries will be collected at Screening, Baseline (Day 1), and Weeks 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96.  A 
post
-treatment follow-up visit, at which safety assessments will be performed, will occur [ADDRESS_539043] a lymphocyte count <LLN will continue protocol-required 
visits and assessments and will also be followed every 4 weeks for 24 weeks, then every 
12 weeks ( u nless clinically indicated more often or at the Investigator’s discretion ) until the 
lymphocyte count is ≥LLN or for up to 48 weeks following drug discontinuation, whichever 
occurs sooner.   
S
ubjects who develop a confirmed lymphocyte count of <500 cells/mm3 at any time during the 
stud
y will be monitored every 4 weeks.  If the lymphocyte count stays <500 cells/mm3 for 
[ADDRESS_539044] within 24 weeks while study treatment is temporarily withheld, study 
treatment will be discontinued permanently (see Section 11.3).  
S
ubjects whose lymphocyte counts remain <LLN at the end of the study (Week 96) will 
c
omplete the final Follow-Up Visit and will then be followed up outside of this study at the 
I
nvestigator’s discretion.   
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_426577], at the discretion of the treating 
ph
ysician and only after consulting with the Medical Monitor, for subjects who have

S
ubjects who withdraw from the study while on study treatment will complete the 
Discontinuation and/or Withdrawal Visit as soon as possible but no later than [ADDRESS_539045] 12 weeks and every 
12 weeks thereafter for 96 weeks. 
Discontinuation and/or Withdrawal Visits  Visits will be 
performed as necessary.  Subjects who withdraw from the study early will be asked to return to 
complete a Discontinuation and/or Withdrawal Visit within [ADDRESS_539046] dose of study 
treatment.  The final study visit will be Week 100.  
Subjects who temporarily withhold or permanently discontinue BG00012 for any reason and

l
ymphocyte count is ≥LLN or for up to 48 weeks following drug discontinuation, whichever 
oc
curs sooner; see Section 11.3).  Subjects whose lymphocyte count remains <LLN at the end of 
the study (Week 96) will complete the final Follow-Up Visit and will then be followed up 
outside of this protocol at the Investigator’s discretion.

11.1. Regimen 
Refer to and follow the Directions for Handling and Administration (DHA).  
BG00012 will be taken orally at a dose of [ADDRESS_539062] 7 days and at a maintenance 
dose 
of 240 mg  BID thereafter.  Temporary dose reductions to 120 mg BID may be considered 
for
 individuals who do not tolerate the maintenance dose due to flushing and/or GI disturbances.  
Within [ADDRESS_539063] does not remember to take the dose

While dosing is withheld, subjects will continue tests and assessments according to the schedule 
defined in Section  4.2 (and may also undergo additional assessments to evaluate the laboratory 
a
bnormality as per the Investigator’s standard practice).  In addition, subjects (whether dosing is 
temporarily withheld or permanently discontinued) must have the abnormal laboratory result 
retested at least every 2 weeks (retests will be run at the central laboratory) until resolution or 
stabilization of the laboratory value.  Depending on the severity and clinical significance of the 
abnormality, the Investigator may need to perform the retests more frequently.   
11.2.2. Resumption of Study Treatment Dosing 
Resumption of study treatment is to be considered on a case- by-case basis and must be discussed 
with the Medical Monitor.  However, subjects who have abnormal laboratory values, as 
described in Table 3, sustained on 3 consecutive occasions (i.e., for more than 4 consecutive 
we
eks) must permanently discontinue study treatment (Section 10.1).  Subjects who have 
tempor
arily withheld BG00012 due to lymphopenia may resume BG00012 according to 
Section 11.3. 
S
ubjects with abnormal laboratory values after Week 12 (after which clinic visits occur once 
every 3 months), who are allowed to resume study treatment dosing following a 2- to 4-week 
int
erruption, will restart dosing at a reduced dose for [ADDRESS_539067] also return to the

 Dosage Reductions 
Dosage reduction will be allowed only for subjects who are unable to tolerate study treatment 
due to flushing and/or GI disturbances (dosage reductions will not be allowed for abnormal 
laboratory values; for management of abnormal laboratory values, refer to Sections 11.2.1, 
11.2.2
, and 11.2.3).  Subjects who do not tolerate study treatment will reduce their dosage by

 14. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
Refer to Section 4 for the timing of all safety assessments. 
14.1. Clinical Safety Assessments 
The following clinical assessments will be performed to evaluate the safety profile of BG00012: 
 AEs, SAEs, a nd concomitant therapy and procedures recording 
 ph ysical examinations, including body weight and height  
 vit al sign measurements, including diastolic and systolic blood pressure, heart rate, 
body temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697].  Subjects must remain in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_426585] 5 minutes prior to having heart rate and blood pressure taken.

alkaline phosphatase, ALT/SPGT, AST/SGOT, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, 
bica
rbonate, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, uric acid, and glucose 
Protocol 109MS310 Version [ADDRESS_539086] a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
a
bnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product.  
Determination of whether an abnormal laboratory value meets the definition of an AE will be 
made by [CONTACT_737].  Although abnormal laboratory values are typi[INVESTIGATOR_426586], the following considerations may result in an abnormal laboratory value being considered 
an AE: 
 A la boratory test result that meets the criteria for an SAE 
 A laboratory test result that requires the subject to receive specific corrective therapy 
 A la boratory abnormality that the Investigator considers to be clinically significant 
15.1.2. Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 R esults in death 
 In the view of the Investigator, places the subject at immediate risk of death (a 
life-threatening event); however, this does not include an event that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death 
 R equires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 R esults in a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], 
may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes

 listed in the definition above.  (Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not 
require an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) 
15.1.3. Prescheduled or Elective Procedures or Routinely Scheduled Treatments 
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered 
an SAE, even if the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  The study site must document all of the following: 
 The  prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or was on a waiting list to be scheduled)  prior to obtaining the subject’s 
c
onsent to participate in the study. 
 The  condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_204884]’s consent to participate in the study and the time of 
the procedure or treatment. 
 The  prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment is the sole 
reason for the intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].

 15.2.2. Relationship of Events to Study Treatment 
The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the relationship of AEs and 
SAEs to the study treatment: 
Relationship of Event to Study Treatm ent 
Not related  An AE will be considered “not related” to the use of the investigat ional drug if there is 
not a reasonable possibility that the event has been caused by [CONTACT_56695].  Factors pointing toward this assessment include but are not limited to:  the 
lack of reasonable temporal relationship between administra tion of the drug and the 
event, the presence of a biologically implausible relationship between the product and the 
AE, or the presence of a more likely alternative explanation for the AE.  
Related  An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the inves tigational drug if there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_56695].  Factors that point toward this assessment include but are not limited to:  a 
positive rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration of the drug 
and the event, a known response pattern of the suspected drug, improvement following 
discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the drug 
and the AE, or a lack of an alternative explan ation for the AE.  
15.2.3. Severity of Events 
The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the severity of AEs and SAEs: 
Severity of Event  
Mild  Symptoms barely noticeable to subject or does not make subject uncomfortable; does not 
influence perf ormance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily needed for relief of 
symptoms but may be given because of personality of subject.  
Moderate  Symptoms of a sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; performance of daily 
activity is influence d; subject is able to continue in study; treatment for symptoms may be 
needed.  
Severe  Symptoms cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or significant impact 
on subject’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of treatment with study treat ment; 
treatment for symptoms may be given and/or subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
15.2.4. Expectedness of Events 
Expectedness of all AEs will be determined by [CONTACT_426598]’s Brochure. 
15.3. Monitoring and Recording Events 
15.3.1. Adverse Events 
Any AE experienced by [CONTACT_426599]-Up Visit is to be recorded on the CRF, regardless of the severity of the event or its 
relationship to study treatment. 
Protocol 109MS310 Version [ADDRESS_539090] 
formally notify Biogen or designee within 24 hours of the study site staff becoming aware of the 
S
AE.  It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the SAE reporting information and 
procedures are used and followed appropriately. 
 
Reporting Information for SAEs  
Any SAE that occurs between the time that the subje ct has signed the ICF and the final 
Follow -Up Visit must be reported to Biogen or designee within [ADDRESS_539091] be submitted  to Biogen or designee  regardless of the following:  
 Whether or not the subject has undergone study -related procedures  
 Whether or not the subject has received study treatment  
 The severity of the event  
 The relationship of the event to study treatment  
To report initial or follow -up information on an SAE, fax a completed SAE form; refer to the 
Study Reference Guide for complete contact [CONTACT_3031].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Deaths 
Death is an outcome of an event.  The event that resulted in death should be recorded on the 
appropriate CRF.  All causes of death must be reported as SAEs within [ADDRESS_539092] of BG00012 on Lymphocyte Subsets and Immunoglobulins in Subjects With RRMS 
CONFIDENTIAL 
The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published without the written consent of

 death certificates and autopsy reports to Biogen or designee.  The term death should be reported 
as an SAE only if the cause of death is not known and cannot be determined. 
15.3.4. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are SAEs that are unexpected and 
judged by [CONTACT_426600]. 
Biogen or designee will report S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the appropriate regulatory authorities and 
Investigators as required, according to local law. 
15.4. Procedures for Handling Special Situations 
15.4.1. Pregnancy 
Subjects should not become pregnant or impregnate their partners during the study and 
for [ADDRESS_539093] according to the protocol.  Overdoses are not considered 
AEs and should not be recorded as an AE on the CRF; however, all overdoses must be recorded 
on an Overdose form and faxed to Biogen or designee within [ADDRESS_539094] be recorded on the 
dosing CRF. 
15.4.3. Medical Emergency 
In a medical emergency requiring immediate attention, study site staff will apply appropriate 
medical intervention, according to current standards of care.  The Investigator (or designee) 
should contact [CONTACT_1758]’s Medical Director.  Refer to the Study Reference Guide’s Official 
S
tudy Contact [CONTACT_71393]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Unblinding for Medical Emergency 
Not applicable. 
Protocol 109MS310 Version [ADDRESS_539095] practice effective contraception (as determined by [CONTACT_3786]) during the study and be willing and able to continue contraception for [ADDRESS_539096] dose of study treatment. 
For the purposes of this study, women who do not meet one of the following criteria listed below 
are considered to be physiologically capable of becoming pregnant and are, therefore, defined as 
women of childbearing potential: 
 P ostmenopausal 
o 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea without an alternative medical 
cause and a serum follicle-stimulating hormone level >40 mIU/mL  
o 6 weeks after surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy 
 P osthysterectomy 
 F emale surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal ligation) 
For the purposes of the study, highly effective contraception is defined as use of 1 or more of the 
following: 
For females: 
 Establis hed use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception.  
 P lacement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system. 
 B arrier methods of contraception with use of a spermicide:  condom or occlusive cap 
(diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream suppository.  
The use of barrier contraceptives should always be supplemented with the use of a 
spermicide. 
 Male surgical sterilization (with the appropriate postvasectomy documentation of the 
absence of sperm in the ejaculate).  (For female subjects participating in the study, 
male sexual partners must have undergone surgical sterilization.) 
For males: 
 Effective male contraception includes a vasectomy with negative semen analysis at 
follow-up, or the use of condoms with spermicide. 
True abstinence, when this is consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject, can 
be considered an acceptable method of contraception based on the evaluation of the Investigator 
who should also take into consideration the duration of the clinical trial.  Periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not 
considered acceptable methods of contraception.

 Methods of Analysis 
Statistical analyses will be  and descriptive in nature, with appropriate measures of 
precision provided where applicable.  There is no planned statistical hypothesis testing in this 
study.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint 
Counts and change from Baseline in counts for each of the lymphocyte subsets will be 
descriptively summarized at each applicable visit.  Furthermore, the primary endpoints will be 
summariz ed in various ALC subgroups to evaluate the nature of change in each subset in relation 
to t
he change in ALC.  Additionally, a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) will be 
used, which will be fit with the change from Baseline for each of the lymphocyte subsets as the 
dependent variable and will include ALC subgroups, visit, corresponding Baseline counts, age, 
gender, and ALC groups- by-visit interaction as fixed effects to estimate the difference between 
ALC subgroups.  Point estimates and 2-sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) will be derived 
from the
 model.  Appropriate transformation may be performed based on the distribution of data. 
ALC subgroups of interest include (1) subjects who have all ALC values ≥LLN up to Week 48, 
(
2) subjects who have at least 1 ALC value <LLN over 48 weeks, and (3) subjects who have at 
least 2 ALC values <LLN over 48 weeks.  Additional subgroups will be further defined in the 
S
tatistical Analysis Plan. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints 
For the secondary endpoints (IgG isotypes and ALCs), actual values and change from Baseline 
will be descriptively summarized at each applicable visit.  In addition, the same type of MMRM 
used for analysis of primary endpoints will be employed, which will be fit with the change from 
Baseline in each of the IgG isotypes and ALCs as the dependent variable and will include visit, 
corresponding baseline value, age, and gender as fixed effects.

 16.6. Interim Analyses 
Interim analyses may be performed to support regulatory filings and/or publications and will be 
documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
16.7. Sample Size Considerations 
The sample size for this study is not based on formal hypothesis testing but on the precision of 
the estimation of the primary endpoints and the ratios between various ALC subgroups. 
For example, the Phase [ADDRESS_539102]-Baseline value 
fr
om the interim analysis of the Integrated Summary of Safety of Tecfidera, showed that 76% of 
subjects had all ALC values ≥LLN and 24% had at least 1 ALC value <LLN up to Week 48.  
Assuming the same proportion of subjects in this study will have 1 or more ALC values <LLN, it 
is ex
pected that approximately [ADDRESS_539103] all ALC values ≥LLN and approximately 
[ADDRESS_539104] 1 ALC value <LLN at Week 48, based on a total of 180 evaluable 
subjects at Week 48.  With this sample size, the 90% CIs for the ratio of the 2 subgroups for the 
change from Baseline at Week 48 in lymphocyte subsets are illustrated below using the scenario 
of a true ratio of 0.8 (20% decrease) and 0.7 (30% decrease), respectively.  When assessing 
lymphocyte subsets between subjects with at least 2 ALC values <LLN up to the first [ADDRESS_539105] all ALC values ≥LLN throughout the study, the 90% CIs 
of the ratio would be wider, as historical data suggest that 16% of the patients treated with 
Tecfidera may have 2 or more ALC values <LLN during the first 48 weeks of treatment.

qua
lified persons to whom significant study-related duties have been delegated. 
17.1. Declaration of Helsinki 
This study will be performed in alignment with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration 
of Helsinki. 
17.2. Ethics Committee 
The Investigator must obtain ethics committee approval of the protocol, ICF, and other required 
study documents prior to starting the study.  Biogen/CRO will submit documents on behalf of the 
investigational sites in countries other than the US.  
If the Investigator makes any changes to the ICF, Biogen must approve the changes before the 
ICF is submitted to the ethics committee.  A copy of the approved ICF must be provided to 
Biogen.  After approval, the ICF must not be altered without the agreement of the relevant ethics 
committee and Biogen. 
It is the responsibility of the Investigators to ensure that all aspects of institutional review are 
conducted in accordance with current applicable regulations. 
Biogen must receive a letter documenting ethics committee approval, which specifically 
identifies the protocol, protocol number, and ICF, prior to the initiation of the study.  Protocol 
amendments will be subject to the same requirements as the original protocol. 
A progress report must be submitted to the ethics committee at required intervals and not less 
than annually. 
At the completion or termination of the study, the investigational site must submit a close-out 
letter to the ethics committee and Biogen. 
17.3. Subject Information and Consent 
Prior to performing any study-related activities under this protocol, including screening tests and 
assessments, written informed consent with the approved ICF must be obtained from the subject 
or subject’s legally authorized representative (e.g., parent or legal guardian), as applicable, in 
a
ccordance with local practice and regulations.   
The background of the proposed study, the procedures, the benefits and risks of the study, and 
that study participation is voluntary for the subject must be explained to the subject (or the 

Protocol 109MS310 Version [ADDRESS_539109]’s legally authorized representative).  The subject must be given sufficient time to 
consider whether to participate in the study.

Protocol Number: 109MS310 
P
rotocol Title: An Open-Label Study to Assess the Effects of BG00012 on 
Lymphocyte Subsets in Subjects With Relapsing- Remitting 
Multiple Sclerosis 
Version Number 1 
N
ame of Study Treatment: BG00012 (dimethyl fumarate [DMF]; Tecfidera®)  
Study Indication: Multiple sclerosis (MS) 
Study Rationale Given the putative immunomodulatory properties of DMF 
a
nd its observed effects on lymphocytes in humans, further 
evaluation of its effects on immune function is needed.  The 
effect of BG00012 on lymphocyte subtypes is yet unknown, 
and its evaluation may provide insights in to the mechanisms 
underlying BG00012-associated lymphopenia .  This study is 
therefore being conducted to assess the effects of BG00012 
on lymphocyte subset counts and immunoglobulins (Igs) 
within the first year of treatment and until the end of the 
study. 
Phase of Development: 3b 
S
tudy Objectives and 
Endpoints: The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect 
of BG00012 on lymphocyte subset counts during the first 
year of treatment in subjects with RRMS. 
The primary endpoint that relates to this objective is the 
change in lymphocyte subset counts for up to [ADDRESS_539129] of BG00012 on absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) 
and Igs during the first year of treatment.  
The endpoints that relat e to this objective are the changes in 
IgG isotypes and ALCs for up to [ADDRESS_539130] of BG00012 on Lymphocyte Subsets and Immunoglobulins in Subjects With RRMS

 S
tudy Design: This is an open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the 
effects of BG00012 on lymphocyte subtypes and Ig 
isotypes.   
After the Screening Visit (up to 28 days), subjects will 
receive BG00012 treatment for 48 weeks (Treatment 
Period) and will then continue on 240 mg BG00012 twice 
daily (BID) for an additional 48 weeks (Extension Period).  
Blood samples for lymphocyte subset analysis, as well as 
complete blood count with differential, will be collected at 
Screening, Baseline (Day 1), and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 
72, and 96.  Clinical samples for the analysis of blood 
chemistries will be collected at Screening, Baseline (Day 1), 
and Weeks 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96.  A post-treatment follow- up 
visit at which safety assessments will be performed will 
occur 4 weeks after the final dose of BG00012.   
Subjects who withdraw from the study while on study 
treatment will complete the Discontinuation and/or 
Withdrawal Visit as soon as possible but no later than 
[ADDRESS_539131] a lymphocyte count <LLN will continue 
pr
otocol-required visits and assessments and will also be 
or for [ADDRESS_539132] dose (whichever is sooner).  
Subjects who withdraw from the study for reasons other 
than safety may be replaced at the discretion of Biogen. 
R
efer to Table 1 and T able 2 for the timing of all study 
a
ssessments. 
Study Location: Approximately 100 sites in North America and Europe 
Number of Planned Subjects:  Approximately 200 subjects will be treated. 
Study Population: This study will be conducted in male and female subjects, 
aged 18 through 65 years, with a confirmed diagnosis of 
RRMS according to the revised McDonald criteria (2010) 
[Polman 2011] .

4.3.2.  Subject Management 
Contraception requirements are described in Section 15.5.  Study treatment dosing requirements 
and concomitant medication restrictions are described in Sections 11.[ADDRESS_539151] formulation containing the active ingredient dimethyl 
fumarate (DMF).  In 2013, BG00012 was first approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) under the 
propriety name [CONTACT_254126]® as a treatment for patients with relapsing MS and has since been 
approved in other countries. 
5.1. Overview of Multiple Sclerosis 
MS is a chronic autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system 
(CNS) that is characterized by [CONTACT_2898], demyelination, and oligodendrocyte and neuronal 
loss.  It is the most common demyelinating disorder of the CNS, affecting approximately 
2.[ADDRESS_539152] among Caucasians, with higher rates 
r
eported in North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and northern Asia [Noseworthy 
2000; Rosati 2001] .    
Relapsing MS is the most common clinical presentation of the disease.  The term relapsing MS 
applies to patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or secondary progressive MS (SPMS) 
w
ho experience relapses; both are considered part of the same disease spectrum.  In the 
relapsing/remitting phase of the disease, patients experience epi[INVESTIGATOR_426574] (relapses) separated by [CONTACT_426591].  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_426575], sensory loss, visual loss, and imbalance.  Relapses may completely subside in 
the early stage of the disease, but recovery tends to be incomplete over time, leading to the 
accumulation of physical disability and cognitive decline.  RRMS is usually diagnosed between 
the ages of 20 and 40 years and affects twice as many women than men.  The RRMS population 
r
anges from patients with relatively benign, inactive, non-inflammatory disease to patients who 
experience frequent relapse and/or persistent, active, inflammatory disease.  Most of these 
patients develop SPMS, which is characterized by [CONTACT_426592]; the median time to progression from RRMS to SPMS is 
approximately 10 years [Runmarker and Andersen 1993] .   Approximately half of all MS patients 
are unable to walk without assistance within 15 years of their initial diagnosis [Runmarker and 
Andersen 1993; Weinshenker 1989] , and more than half of patients die from MS or its 
complications [Brønnum-Hansen 2004] . 
As patients progress along the continuum from RRMS to SPMS, disability progression is more 
likely to occur independently of relapses.  The pathological changes underlying MS are thought 
to occur when activated T lymphocytes cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and initiate a series 
of events leading to activation of endothelial cells, recruitment of additional lymphocytes and 
monocytes, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  MS lesions consisting of immune cells 
can occur throughout the CNS, but certain sites appear to be particularly vulnerable, such as the 
optic nerve, brainstem, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], and periventricular regions of the cerebrum.  The 
development of MS lesions is associated with inflammation, edema, and demyelination, and is 
often correlated with reversible disease symptoms, namely relapses, as well as oligodendrocyte 
Protocol 109MS310 Version [ADDRESS_539153] in part by [CONTACT_426593].  Preclinical studies indicate that BG00012-dependent pharmacodynamic responses appear 
to be mediated through activation of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) 
t
ranscriptional pathway, which is the primary cellular defense system for responding to a variety 
of potentially toxic stimuli through up-regulation of antioxidant response genes.  While it is not 
y
et fully understood how the inflammatory cascade is initiated, adhesion and trans-endothelial 
migration of inflammatory cells from the bloodstream across the BBB and into the CNS is 
thought to be an early and critical step in this process.  
5.2. Current Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_426576]-line MS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_254094] (IFNs) and glatiramer acetate 
(GA) [Waldman 2011] .  Relative to placebo, IFNs have been shown to reduce relapse rate by 
[CONTACT_3450] 27% to 36% [ Calabresi 2014; Jacobs 1996; PRISMS Study Group 1998; The 
IFNB Multiple Sclerosis Study Group 1993 ], and GA by [CONTACT_3450] 30% [Johnson 1995] .   
The interferon beta-1a (IFN -1a) products have also been shown to delay disability progression 
[Jacobs 1996; PRISMS Study Group 1998] .   
Other currently approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_254095]: 
 Natalizumab:  a humanized monoclonal ant
  
[Polman 2006] . 
 Fingolimod:  a selective oral immunosuppressant that is metabolized to a functional 
antagonist of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors on lymphocytes [Kappos 2010] . 
 Mitoxantrone:  a synthetic antineoplastic anthracenedione that intercalates into 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and interferes with ribonucleic acid (RNA) [Chitnis 
2012 ]. 
 Teriflunomide:  an immunomodulatory drug inhibiting pyrimidine synthesis by 
[CONTACT_426594] [O'Connor 2011] .  
 Alemtuzumab:  a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD-[ADDRESS_539154] leukocytes [Coles 2012] . 
5.3. Profile of Previous Experience With BG00012 
5.
3.1. Nonclinical Experience 
In nonclinical studies, DMF and its primary metabolite, monomethyl fumarate, were found to 
promote stabilization and transcriptional activity of Nrf2, as well as expression of Nrf2 target 
g
enes in cultured human cells and in vivo [Linker 2011 ].  Previous ex vivo and in vivo studies 

Protocol 109MS310 Version [ADDRESS_539155] by 
[CONTACT_426595]. 
 
5.3.2.  Clinical Experience 
In the Phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled safety and efficacy studies (the completed 6-month 
Phase 2 Study C-1900 Part 1 and the 2 completed 2-year Phase 3 Studies 109MS301 and 
109MS302) and/or their uncontrolled extensions (the completed 6-month Phase 2 Study C-1900 
Part 2 and the ongoing Phase 3 long-term Study 109MS303) over [ADDRESS_539156] efficacy and a favorable safety profile in subjects with RRMS in the 
2 large Phase 3 studies (Study 109MS301 [DEFINE] [Gold 2012a]  and Study 109MS302 
[CONFIRM] [Fox 2012] ).  The benefit-risk profile of DMF was considered positive, and the 
drug has been approved. 
Both Phase 3 studies demonstrated that treatment with DMF reduced the risk of MS relapse and 
slowed progression of disability.  In an integrated analysis of DEFINE and CONFIRM, DMF 
240 mg twice daily (BID) and 3 times daily significantly reduced the annualized relapse rate at 
2 years by 49% relative to placebo (p<0.0001).  Significant reductions at 2 years were also 
obs
erved in the proportion of subjects who relapsed (43% and 47%, respectively; p<0.0001), the 
pr
oportion of subjects with confirmed (12-week) progression of disability (32% and 30%, 
r
espectively; p<0.01), and the proportion of subjects with confirmed (24-week) progression of 
disability (29% and 32%, respectively; p<0.03) [Gold 2012b] .  
DMF was generally well tolerated and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile.  The most 
common AEs associated with DMF were flushing and gastrointestinal (GI) events.  In subjects 
who experienced these types of events, the events were generally mild or moderate in intensity, 
t
ended to decrease in incidence after the first month, and only infrequently led to treatment 
discontinuation.  There are a number of potential management strategies for these side effects.  
In the Phase 2 and 3 controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies in subjects with RRMS, 
BG00012 treatment was associated with a gradual decrease from baseline in mean leukocyte 
counts driven primarily by [CONTACT_426596]; mean lymphocyte counts 
decreased by [CONTACT_3450] 30% of their baseline value after [ADDRESS_539157] of BG00012 on Lymphocyte Subsets and Immunoglobulins in Subjects With RRMS

 ha
ve been observed with BG00012 treatment, in the placebo controlled Phase 2 and 3 studies 
BG00012 was not associated with an increased risk of infection, serious infection, or 
opportunistic infection compared with placebo.  However, in the long-term extension study 
(
109MS303), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy has occurred in the setting of severe, 
prolonged lymphopenia following BG00012 administration.  With open-label and marketed use 
of BG00012, there has been no other evidence of an increased risk of infections, serious 
infections, or opportunistic infections.   
 
5.4. Study Rationale 
Given the putative immunomodulatory properties of DMF and its observed effects on 
lymphocytes in humans, further evaluation of its effects on lymphocytes is needed.  The effect of 
BG00012 on lymphocyte subtypes is yet unknown, and its evaluation may provide insights into 
the mechanisms underlying BG00012-associated lymphopenia.  This study is therefore being 
conducted to assess the effect s of BG00012 on lymphocyte subset counts and immunoglobulins 
(Igs) within the first year of treatment and beyond.  
5.5. Rationale for Dosing Regimen 
The BG00012 dosage selected for this study ([ADDRESS_539158] 7 days and 240 mg BID 
thereafter) is the approved BG00012 dosing regimen in the US, Canada, European Union, and 
other countries around the world for the treatment of patients with MS.   
Temporary dose reductions to 120 mg BID may be considered for individuals who do not 
tolerate the maintenance dose due to flushing and/or GI disturbances.  Within [ADDRESS_539159] of BG00012 on absolute

abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. 
Determination of whether an abnormal laboratory value meets the definition of an AE will be 
made by [CONTACT_737].  Although abnormal laboratory values are typi[INVESTIGATOR_426586], the following considerations may result in an abnormal laboratory value being considered 
an AE: 
 A
 laboratory test result that meets the criteria for an SAE 
 A laboratory test result that requires the subject to receive specific corrective therapy 
 A laboratory abnormality that the Investigator considers to be clinically significant 
15.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:

An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], 
may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed in the definition above.  (Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not 
require an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) 
15.1.3.  Prescheduled or Elective Procedures or Routinely Scheduled Treatments 
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered 
an SAE, even if the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  The study site must document all of the following: 
 The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or was on a waiting list to be scheduled)  prior t
consent to participate in the study. 
 The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_426588].

AE, or the presence of a more likely alternative explanation for the AE. 
Related 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_56695].  Factors that point toward this assessment include but are not limited to:  a 
positive rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration of the drug 
and the event, a known response pattern of the suspected drug, improvement following 
discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the drug 
and the AE, or a lack of an alternative explanation for the AE. 
15.2.3.  Severity of Events 
The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the severity of AEs and SAEs: 
Severity of Event 
Mild Symptoms barely noticeable to subject or does not make subject uncomfortable; does not 
influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily needed for r elief of 
symptoms but may be given because of personality of subject. 
Moderate Symptoms of a sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; performance of daily 
activity is influenced; subject is able to continue in study; treatment for symptoms may b e 
needed.

Subjects of childbearing potential must practice effective contraception (as determined by [CONTACT_3786]) during the study and be willing and able to continue contraception for [ADDRESS_539212] dose of study treatment. 
F
or the purposes of this study, women who do not meet one of the following criteria listed below 
are considered to be physiologically capable of becoming pregnant and are, therefore, defined as 
women of childbearing potential: 
 Postmenopausal 
 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea without an alternative medical 
cause and a serum follicle-stimulating hormone level >40 mIU/mL  
 6 weeks after surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy 
 Posthysterectomy  
 Female surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal ligation) 
For the purposes of the study, highly effective contraception is defined as use of 1 or more of the 
following: 
For females: 
 Established use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception.  
 Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system. 
 Barrier methods of contraception with use of a spermicide:  condom or occlusive cap 
(diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream suppository.  
The use of barrier contraceptives should always be supplemented with the use of a 
spermicide.

ale surgical sterilization (with the appropriate postvasectomy documentation of the 
absence of sperm in the ejaculate).  (For female subjects participating in the study, 
male sexual partners must have undergone surgical sterilization.) 
For males: 
 Effective male contraception includes a vasectomy with negative semen analysis at 
follow-up, or the use of condoms with spermicide. 
True abstinence, when this is consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject, can 
be considered an acceptable method of contraception based on the evaluation of the Investigator 
who should also take into consideration the duration of the clinical trial.  Periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not 
considered acceptable methods of contraception. 
Pregnancy reporting is described in Section 15.4.1.

Statistical analyses will be  and descriptive in nature, with appropriate measures of 
precision provided where applicable.  There is no planned statistical hypothesis testing in this 
study.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analysis of the Primary Endpoint 
Counts and change from Baseline in counts for each of the lymphocyte subsets will be 
descriptively summarized at each applicable visit.  Furthermore, the primary endpoints will be 
summarized in various ALC subgroups to evaluate the nature of change in each subset in relation 
to the change in ALC.  Additionally, a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) will be 
used, which will be fit with the change from Baseline for each of the lymphocyte subsets as the 
de
pendent variable and will include ALC subgroups, visit, corresponding Baseline counts, age, 
gender, and ALC groups-by-visit interaction as fixed effects to estimate the difference between 
ALC subgroups.  Point estimates and 2-sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) will be derived

ALC subgroups of interest include (
(2) subjects who have at least 1 ALC value <LLN over 48 weeks, and (3) subjects who have at 
least 2 ALC values <LLN over 48 weeks.  Additional subgroups will be further defined in the 
S
tatistical Analysis Plan. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints 
For the secondary endpoints (IgG isotypes and ALCs), actual values and change from Baseline 
will be descriptively summarized at each applicable visit.  In addition, the same type of MMRM 
used for analysis of primary endpoints will be employed, which will be fit with the change from

16.4.2.  Methods of Analysis 
All AEs, concomitant therapy and procedures, clinical laboratory results, physical examinations, 
vi
tal signs, and 12-lead ECG readings data will be evaluated for safety. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Events 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Only 
treatment-emergent AEs will be presented in the summary tables.  Treatment emergent is defined 
as having an onset date on or after start of study treatment or having worsened after the start of 
s
tudy treatment. 
Subject incidences of all AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation and study 
withdrawal, and other AEs of special interest will be tabulated by [CONTACT_426608].

summary of laboratory values categorized based on Common Toxicity Criteria grade will also be 
generated.  Summary statistics for actual values and change from Baseline will also be presented 
for quantitative laboratory data. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Physical Examinations 
The analyses of physical examinations will include summary statistics (actual value and change 
from Baseline for body weight and height) over time by [CONTACT_765]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Vital Signs 
The analysis of vital signs will focus on clinically relevant abnormalities.  The number of 
subjects evaluated and the number and percentage of subjects with clinically relevant 
post-Baseline abnormalities will be presented by [CONTACT_19313].   
The definitions of these clinically relevant abnormalities are shown in Table 5.

16.6. Interim Analyses 
Interim analyses may be performed to support regulatory filings and/or publications and will be 
documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
16.7. Sample Size Considerations 
The sample size for this study is not based on formal hypothesis testing but on the precision of 
the estimation of the primary endpoints and the ratios between various ALC subgroups. 
For example, the Phase [ADDRESS_539219]-Baseline value 
from the interim analysis of the Integrated Summary of Safety of Tecfidera, showed that 76% of 
subjects had all ALC val

subjects at Week 48.  With this sample size, the 90% CIs for the ratio of the 2 subgroups for the 
change from Baseline at Week 48 in lymphocyte subsets are illustrated below using the scenario 
of a true ratio of 0.8 (20% decrease) and 0.7 (30% decrease), respectively.  When assessing 
lymphocyte subsets between subjects with at least 2 ALC values <LLN up to the first [ADDRESS_539221] that 16% of the patients treated with 
Tecfidera may have 2 or more ALC values <LLN during the first 48 weeks of treatment. 
To allow for a 10% discontinuation rate, a total of 200 subjects are planned for enrollment.

Page 8 of 44 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
1.1. Heart  Transplantation and Current Clinical Challenges:  
Over the last two decades  heart  transplantation has evolved as the gold standard for treating end-
stage heart failure .1-3  While the demand for heart  transplantation globally has increased 
significantly each year, the utilization or recovery of available donor hearts  for transplantation 
has been limited to approximately 3 0% of the annual available pool of donor hearts  in the U.S.4  
Based on the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) 2011 report, 
approximately 4,600 consented, donor hearts  in the US are not transplanted annually, depriving 
thousands of patient s the gift of new hearts  to treat their end -stage heart  disease.  The main cause 
for th ese unfortunate circumstances  is that the current technique for heart  preservation using cold 
flush and storage  has the following severe limitations: 
• It subjects the donor hearts  to significant time -dependent ischemic injury7 and 
subsequent reperfusion injury that impair heart  function post-transplant.  This causes 
transplanting physicians to only select for procurement those hearts  most likely to 
withstand the potential damage associated with cold storage preservation.  It also imposes significant time and geographical limitations on the heart  retrieval process, 
adversely impacting the utilization of available donor hearts .  In addition, this time-
dependent ischemic injur y has been directly correlated to post - transplant 
complications.  
• It lacks any perfusion capabilities to maintain the heart  in a near -physiologic
8 (in- 
vivo-like) environment after the donor heart  is retrieved from the body of the donor.  
This limitation results in significant underutilization of the donor heart  pool given that 
many donor hearts  are subject to the negative impact of brain death and other 
untoward physiological conditions in the body of the donor, prior to their 
procurement.   
• It lacks any ability to evaluate organ metabolic state and function after procurement and preservation to determine the suitability of the donor hearts  for transplantation.  
This significantly limits the utilization of donor hearts  that are subjected  negative, 
non-physiologic conditions of brain death in the donor. 
This severe imbalance between supply and demand for donor hearts has resulted in the 
significant rise of the use of Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADS) over the past few years 
(Figure  1).  This rise in VAD use is associated with significant economic burden to the 
healthcare system driven by [CONTACT_821036], while survival benefits are still well below the ones achieved by a heart transplantation procedure.

(INTERMACS); Quarterly Statistical Report, Q3, 2013. 
 
 
More importantly, annually this severe underutilization results in > 25% of the patients listed on 
the national waiting list for heart transplantation dying or deteriorating in health condition  while 
awaiting  to receive a heart transplantation.

1.2. Unutilized Donor Hearts  
Below is the published data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (SRTR) 2011 
National Repot on the annual number of unutilized or non- recovered  donor hearts  in the U.S., 
and the clinical reasons for non-recovery.  In 2011, there were 4,603 consented, donor hearts  that 

TransMedics Confidential   OCS -CAR -012014 Rev 1.4 
 
Page 10 of 44 were not utilized in the U .S.; the same year only 1,[ADDRESS_1138107] majority of reasons for not utilizing the donor hearts  result  from 
the existing limitations of cold storage.   
Poor organ function is the primary reason why consented donor hearts  are not utilized.  Poor 
organ function is often a result of the non-physiologic conditions that occur in the body of the 
donor following brain death and subsequent mechanical ventilation dependency, rather than a 
physiological impairment of the organ.  The ability to remove these donor organs from these 
harsh conditions in the donor and to preserve them in a healthy in -vivo-like environment has 
been shown to improve donor heart  function ex -vivo.  Such preservation is not possible with 
cold, ischemic storage.  
Another common reason for not utilizing  donor organs is that no recipi[INVESTIGATOR_821015].  This is 
often a result of (1) the limited time allowed for transportation of the donor organ to the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], which is limited by [CONTACT_821037], 
ischemic stora ge conditions and/or (2) the inability to measure organ function ex vivo to evaluate 
the organ’s function.

http://srtr.transplant.hrsa.gov/annual reports/2010/[ADDRESS_1138108].htm?o=5&g=4&c=[ADDRESS_1138109] 8+  years, there has been a global focus on ex- vivo organ perfusion in a near 
physiologic condition as a promising technique to overcome the current challenges in organ 
preservation and to potentially increase utilization of donor organs (heart, lung, l iver and kidney) 
that are currently not used due to shortcomings of cold storage.10  
Currently, the TransMedics’ Organ Care System (OCS™) Heart technology is the only portable system available for ex -vivo maintenance of the donor hear t in a metabolically active and beating 
state.  The portable Organ Care System (OCS™) Heart  is intended to significantly reduce 
ischemia and reperfusion injuries to the donor heart ; and, enable immediate physiologic 
preservation, optimization of donor heart environment and metabolic assessment of donor heart perfusion to assess its suitability for transplantation. 
The OCS ™ Heart  enables the donor heart  to be maintained in a near physiologic functioning 
state ex -vivo, continuously perfused with a warm oxygenated and nutrient-enriched blood 
(cellular) -based  perfusate .  The OCS™ Heart  may enable the following clinical advantages: 
• Reduction of the time -dependent ischemic injury
[ADDRESS_1138110] with cold storage preservation. 
• Optimization of donor heart ex-vivo environment by [CONTACT_549372], while also replenishing key hormones and nutrients that are depleted due to 
the brain death condition in the body of the donor and would negatively impact 
cardiac function if not replenished. 
• Assessing the adequacy of the perfusion on donor heart utilizing  standard lactate 
levels to allow physicians to judge the suitability of the organ for transplantation 
using the standard criteria that physicians currently use  when harvesting the organ 
from the donor, thus substantially minimizing the risk of transplanting poor hearts  
into recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
1.4. Summary of Prior Testing and  Investigations  
1.4.1. OCS™  Heart  Engineering Testing   
The OCS™ Heart  device is CE marked and has undergone extensive preclinical testing to 
demonstrate its safety, effectiveness, and readiness for clinical use.  The Heart  Perfusion Set has 
also been evaluated and tested in accordance with ISO -[ZIP_CODE] “Biological Evaluation of Medical 
Devices,” including evaluations for acute toxicity, irritation, sensitization, cytotoxicity, hemolysis, genotoxicity and pyrogenicity.  These test results demonstrated that the device and its 
materials are biocompatible and suitable for their intended use.  The Heart  Perfusion Set will be 
provided sterile using validated methods, and is appropriately packaged to maintain sterility.  
The OCS™  has also undergone extensive preclinical bench testing for: electrical safety, 
electromagnetic compatibility, and validation and verification testing (including validation of the device software).  All tests and results have demonstrated that the OCS™  meets its expected 
performance specifications and is safe and suitable for clinical use.

To-date the OCS™ Heart technology has been used to transplant > [ADDRESS_1138111] donors with good clinical results.  The OCS™ PROCEED II pi[INVESTIGATOR_821016]™  Heart technology to preserve standard donor 
hearts in a large multi-center, international trial that compared donor hearts preserved on OCS™  
vs. cold storage. 
1.4.3. OCS™ Heart Clinical Testing for Non- standard D onor Hearts  
To-date the OCS™ Heart technology has been used internationally ([LOCATION_006], [LOCATION_013] and Australia) 
to preserve, assess and successfully transplant 50+ patients from donor hearts that otherwise may 
have been not transplanted using cold storage due to: 
•  Prolonged expected cross clamp time  
• Left ventricular hypertrophy  
• Questionable heart function in lieu of the suboptimal environment of brain death 
• Social history of donor.  
2. DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The OCS™ Heart  System is an integra ted portable platform designed to maintain donor hearts  in 
a near physiologic, normothermic perfusion state.  The OCS™ Heart  System consists of:  
• The Portable Console & Monitor:  This is a compact electromechanical device that 
contains an integ rated pulsatile perfusion pump, batteries, blood warmer, pressure, 
flow and saturation meters.  In addition, it has an integrated wireless monitor that allows the clinical operator to control and display critical perfusion parameters of the 
preserved donor heart s. 
• OCS™ Heart Perfusion Set :  The HPS  consists of the Heart P erfusion Module 
(HPM) and H PS Accessories.  The HPM is a s terile, biocompatible perfusion module 
that maintains the organ’s physiologic environment and has embedded sensors to optimize and monito r the heart  perfusion parameters.  In addition, the perfusion 
module enables perfusate sampling in order to monitor the heart’s metabolic 
condition using standard blood gas and Lactate analyzers.   The H PS Accessories are 
sterile, disposable accessories nec essary to instrument the heart  and manage the 
perfusate.  
• OCS™ Heart  Solution:  This is a balanced nutrient physiologic solution used to 
supplement the donor blood perfusate with electrolytes, substrates and critical hormones that are depleted in the brain -dead donor body.

3. TRIAL  OBJECTIVES 
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the OCS™ Heart  to recruit, preserve and assess donor 
hearts  that may not meet current standard donor heart  acceptance criteria from one or more of the 
following characteristics:  
• Expected total cross -clamp time of ≥  4 hours  
• Expected total cross -clamp time of ≥ 2 hours PLUS one or more of the following risk 
factors:  
− Donor age 45- 55 years old  with n o coronary catheterization data;  or 
− Donor age ≥ 55 y ears old ; or 
− Left ventricular s eptal or posterior wall thickness of >12 ≤16 mm;  or 
− Reported down time of ≥  20 min, with stable hemodynamics at time of final 
assessment; or  
− Left heart ejection fraction (EF) ≥ 40 ≤  50%; or 
− Donor angiogram with luminal irregularities with no significant CAD  
− History of Carbon monoxide poisoning with good cardiac function at time of

3.1. Type of Trial  
A prospective, pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], international single -arm trial of donor hearts  and donor heart  transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
The proposed clinical trial seeks to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the OCS ™ Heart  for 
donor hearts  that today may  not be transplanted due to the l imitations associated with cold 
storage technique due to the impact of ischemia injury.  As such, it is not possible to incorporate 
a concurrent control group.  Thus, a single -arm trial  of the OCS™ Heart  is appropriate to 
evaluate this new use.  
3.2. Trial Size and Subject Follow -up 
This trial will be conducted at no more than 20 institutions, in the U.S. and world-wide (Europe, 
Australia and Canada) and will include up to 75 transplanted heart  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] .  The number of 
subjects was determined as described in the statistical analysis section of this Investigational Plan/P rotocol.  Subjects will be followed for up to 12 months from the date of transplantation. 
The summary of the follow -up is in Appendix 3: 
• All subjects will be followe d from transplant to discharge 
• 30-Day patient and graft survival will be documented on day-[ADDRESS_1138112]- transplant

OCS™ Heart  and the adverse event, but t he causal relationship is unclear or lacking.  
• Unlikely Related:   There is a temporal relationship with preservation with the 
OCS™ Heart  and the adverse event, but there is not a reasonable causal relationship 
between the trial  device and the event. 
• Unrelated:   There is no relationship between preservation with the OCS™ Heart  and 
the adverse event.  
8.7. Severity

analyses of all eff ectiveness and safety endpoints, except the rate of donor hearts utilization that 
were successfully transplanted after preservation and assessment on the OCS™  heart device, will 
be based on the transplanted recipi[INVESTIGATOR_506524]. 
For this study, major protocol violations include: 
• Donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s I nclusion/Exclusion Criteria  Violation  
• Failure to follow IFU

Page 27 of 44 9.2.2. OCS™  Heart Population  
The OCS™  heart population will consist of all donor hearts that are transported by [CONTACT_821035]™ .  
The analysis of the rate of donor hearts utilization that were successfully transplanted after 
preservation and assessment on the OCS™  heart device will be based on the OCS™  heart 
population. 
9.3. Analysis of Effectiveness Endpoints  
9.3.1. Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  
The primary hypothesis for this trial is that the true proportion of transplanted recipi[INVESTIGATOR_821028] [ADDRESS_1138128]- transplantation  and absence of severe primary heart 
graft dysfunction (PGD) (left or right ventricle) in the first  [ADDRESS_1138129]-transplant ation  is 
greater than the Performance Goal  value of 0.65.  The primary statistical hypotheses are as 
follows: 
H
0:  π ≤ 0.65 and  
H1:  π > 0.65 
where π is the true proportion of transplanted recipi[INVESTIGATOR_821029] D ay 30  
and absence of severe primary heart graft dysfunction (PGD) (left or right ventricle) in the first [ADDRESS_1138130]  95% confidence interval for t he true percentage based on the binomial distribution .  A one-
sided exact binomial test at the 0.[ADDRESS_1138131] the null 
hypothesis H
0.  This endpoint will be analyzed using the transplanted recipi[INVESTIGATOR_506524]. 
9.3.2. Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints for this trial are as follows:  
• Patient survival at day -[ADDRESS_1138132]- transplantation  
• Incidence of severe primary  heart graft dysfunction (left or right  ventricle) in the first 
[ADDRESS_1138133]- transplantation  
• Rate of donor hearts utilization that were successfully transplanted after preservation and assessment on the OCS™  heart device.  
Each secondary effectiveness endpoint will be summarized using counts and percentages and an exact 95% confidence interval for the true percentage based on the binomial distribution.   The 
first two secondary effectiveness endpoints will be analyzed using the transplanted recipi[INVESTIGATOR_821013].  The rate of donor hearts utilization that were successfully transplanted after 
preservat ion and assessment on the OCS™  heart device, will be analyzed using  the OCS™  heart 
population.  
9.4. Analysis of Safety  
Safety will be analyzed principally by [CONTACT_754963]. In particular, the number of donor heart  graft -related  serious adverse events (SAEs) up to the 30-
day follow -up after transplantation per subject will be analyzed.  This endpoint is defined to 
consist of the following adverse events (at most one per type), if they are serious adverse events:

− Open chest post heart TX . due to compromised heart function 
• Primary graft failure requiring re -transplantation 
This endpoint will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  A 95% confidence interval for the mean based on the t-distribution will be presented.  
This endpoint will be analyzed based on the transplanted recipi[INVESTIGATOR_506524].  
In addition, the numbers and percentages of subjects experiencing at least one heart  graft -related 
AE, at least one (definitely or probably- related) device- related AE, at least one unanticipated AE, 
and at least one serious AE, and the number and percentage of deaths will all be tabulated.  Also, 
the number of heart graft -related adverse events and the number and percent age of subjects 
experiencing adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_821044].   A similar analysis will be performed for serious AEs.  AEs will also be tabulated at 
the event level by [CONTACT_821045].  Similar analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_475211].  
9.5. Site Poolability  
A site effect analysis will be conducted to assess the poolability of data.  Sites with fewer than 
five subjects will be grouped into a larger Analysis Site.  A chi-square test will be performed to 
evaluate site impact with a p -value of 0.15 defined as the threshold.  If the p-value < 0.[ADDRESS_1138136]- trans plantation  and absence of severe primary heart 
graft dysfunction (PGD) (left or right ventricle) in the first [ADDRESS_1138137], an alp ha level of 0.05, a Performance Goal  
of 0.65, a tr ue survival rate for OCS™  of 0.80, and power of 80%.  Based on these 
specifications, the required sam ple size was determined to be [ADDRESS_1138138] 7 6.4% (i.e., 42 of the 55 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) meet the primary endpoint. 
10. RISK ANALYSIS  
This clinical trial has been designed to ensure that the benefits and knowledge gained from the trial outweigh the potential risks to the subjects.  The subjects are adults undergoing primary 
heart  transplants. 
TransMedics Confidential   OCS -CAR -012014 Rev 1.4 
 
Page 29 of 44 10.1. Potential Risks  
The potential risks to subjects from participation in this clinical trial include the following:  
• Potential R isks A ssociated with Heart  Transplant P rocedures :  These risks 
include post-operative complications, such as graft failure, primary graft dysfunction, 
rejection, infection and other organs/systems complications, graft vessel disease (an expression of chronic rejection), infection, abnormal kidney function, diabetes, high 
level of cholesterol, high blood pressure, cancer and neurological complications. 
• The P otential R isk A ssociated with t he Investigational D evice:  As with any 
medical device, there is always a risk of extremely rare or previously unknown side 
effects developi[INVESTIGATOR_407450].  
• Potential Risk of Using a Donor Heart  that is Unsuitable for Transplantation:  
Regardless of the preservation system that is used, there is the risk that a patient can 
receive a heart  that does not adequately function.  This t rial is designed to utilize 
hearts  that would not be accepted for transplantation using cold storage 
preservation.   There is the possibility that using such hearts  may increase the risk of 
transplanting a heart  that that does not function appropriately.  
10.2. Manner in Which the Potential Risks Have Been Minimized  
The Sponsor has relied upon a number of different means, including the device design, risk 
analysis and management process, preclinical testing, and the clinical protocol itself, to minimize 
the risks to subjects and to protect their safety and welfare.  The sponsor has designed the device 
and conducted a risk analysis in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE] to minimize and mitigate the risks to subjects and users. 
The Sponsor has conducted extensive preclinical testing of the OCS™ Heart  to demonstrate its 
safety, effectiveness and readiness for clinical use.  The OCS™  has undergone extensive 
preclinical and animal studies to demonstrate that the device performs as intended.  These studies 
strongly indicate that the OCS™ Heart  maintains heart  viability by [CONTACT_1541] a controlled 
environment that simulates near -normal physiological conditions, and monitors its function.  The 
Heart  Perfusion Set has been tested for biocompatibility to minimize the risk of adverse tiss ue 
reactions.  These test results demonstrate the device and its materials are biocompatible and 
suitable for their intended use.  The OCS™ Heart  Perfusion Solution used in this trial has been 
tested extensively in pre -clinical and clinical studies and has  been CE marked since 2012.  The 
Heart  Perfusion Set and Perfusion solution are provided sterile and for single use to minimize the 
risk of infection. The OCS ™ Heart  has also undergone and continues to undergo extensive 
design verification and validation t esting to optimize its performance and minimize the risks 
associated with its use.  Preclinical studies demonstrate the device performs as intended and meets its performance specifications including the perfusion pump, the blood warmer, and other functions.  The software has undergone and continues to undergo extensive testing to 
demonstrate it, and its safety functions and alarms, perform as intended. 
This clinical protocol incorporates several procedures to minimize the risks to subjects and to 
ensure the benefits of the clinical trial outweigh its potential risks.  
• The donor heart  acceptance criteria after OCS™ Heart  perfusion and assessment is 
designed based on clinically relevant markers for perfusion of donor hearts on OCS™ 
and clinical  standards of accepting conventional donor hearts  for transplantation. 
TransMedics Confidential   OCS -CAR -012014 Rev 1.4 
 
Page 30 of 44 Thus, the donor heart  will be fully assessed based on the current standards of 
evaluating donor hearts  before it is accepted for transplantation.  The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_821030] 
• Subjects will be monitored before, during and after the operative procedure to help 
ensure their safety.  The investigators are members of transplant teams w ho have 
extensive experience with heart  transplants and who will be trained to use the OCS™ 
Heart  to further minimize risk.  
• Subjects in the trial will undergo frequent visits and routine monitoring to help detect any abnormal changes and to provide appropr iate treatment as necessary.  
• The trial will be monitored to ensure the identification , documentation, and analysis 
of adverse events ; and to ensure compliance with the protocol and procedures that are 
in place for conducting research to protect the safety  and well -being of all subjects.  
10.3. Potential Benefits  
The low utilization of donor hearts  has led to a severe shortage of donor hearts  to meet the large 
and growing need for heart  transplantation; the Scientific Registry  for Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 
(SRTR) and Organ Procurement Transp lant Network (OPTN) report a ~25 % of the patients on 
the national waiting list have either died or they deteriorated in health status to be eligible for a heart transplant procedure.  
The OCS™ Heart  System’s recruitment, preservation  and assessment capabilities could 
potentially increase the rate of utilization of donor hearts  that are currently wasted due to the 
limitations of cold storage techniques.  This could dramatically improve the chances of waiting 
list recipi[INVESTIGATOR_549364] a life -saving heart  transplant and reduce waiting list time and mortality.  
In addition, the OCS™ Heart ’s physiologic preservation of donor hearts  could result in improved 
short and long-term post-transplant outcomes in the form of increased survival and lower graft dysfunction/rejection rates.  
Furthermore, the OCS™ Heart ’s assessment capabilities of donor hearts  ex-vivo, ensures that 
every donor heart  studied must meet the current international standards for donor heart  
acceptance for transplantation, thus ensuring that the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_821031]. 
10.4. Risks Benefits Ratio  
Based on the above, the benefits of using OCS™ Heart  technology to recruit, preserve and assess 
donor hear ts to ensure their suitability for heart  transplantation outweigh any potential risks to 
the trial subjects.   
11. DEVICE/SITE MANAGEME NT 
11.1. Packaging and Labeling  
The OCS ™ Heart Perfusion Set and accessories and the Perfusion Solution will be supplied 
sterile and are intended and labeled for single use.

• Provide recommendations to extend the length of follow-up past [ADDRESS_1138145]  & Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_549365] (DSMB) will be established by [CONTACT_407471], the safety data and the primary efficacy and safety 
endpoints.  The DSMB will make recommendations to the Sponsor regarding continuation, modification or termination of the clinical trial.  The DSMB will review all data submitted to 
them by [CONTACT_549384].  
TransMedics Confidential   OCS -CAR -[ADDRESS_1138146] in an emergency.  Such 
protocol deviations will be reported to the Sponsor and the reviewing IRB or EC as soon as 
possible, but no later than 5 working days after the emergency occurred.  Any permanent change 
to the protocol, whether it is an overall change or a change for specific trial  center(s), will be 
handled as a protocol amendment.  Any amendment to the protocol that appears indicated as the 
trial progresses will be fully discussed by [CONTACT_093](s) and the Sponsor.  If agreement is 
reached regarding the need for an amendment, it will be written by [CONTACT_1034].  The written amendment will be submitted to the chairman of the IRB or EC responsible for reviewing 
amendments.  Except for “administrative letters,” investigators will await IRB or EC approval of 
protocol amendments before implementing the change(s).  Administrative letters are defined to have no effect on the validity of the data or information resulting from the completion of the 
approved protocol, or the relationship of likely patient risk to benefit relied upon to approve the 
protocol; the scientific soundness of the investigational plan or protocol; and, the right, safety or welfare of the human subjects involved in the investigation.  The Sponsor will notify the FDA of 
such changes in a 5 -Day Notice. When, in the judgment of the IRB or EC, the investigators 
and/or the Sponsor, the amendment to the protocol substantially alters the trial  design and/or 
increases the potenti al risk to the subject ; such changes will be approved by [CONTACT_821050].

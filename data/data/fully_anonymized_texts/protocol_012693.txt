Version Date: 2.17.2021 Study Overview and Design 
This research will enroll 225 adult smokers in a mixed design study with a within-
subjects factor (active nicotine patch vs. placebo patch) and a between-subjects factor 
(alternative products: VLNCs, Juul e-cigs, or no product). Participants will be randomized to 
receive either [ADDRESS_134486] been assigned (although the no 
alternative product group will not have any other products to use). See Figure 3. All participants will be given 8 patches (active nicotine or placebo, in counterbalanced order, with one extra in 
case of mishaps ) to use during the Switch Week . After this first Switch Week, they will smoke 
normally for one week and then have their second Switch Week using the other  type of patch 
(active or placebo; see Figure 3). We opted to use a 7-day switching phase and only repeat it 
once to minimize the attrition that was problematic in other studies with longer experimental 
phases (e.g., three 10-day switching phases produced 45% attrition in the non-step down VLNC 
group
112). Participants will complete ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) on 
smartphones at prior to and during the [ADDRESS_134487] use (e.g., taste, buzz), and environmental and affective context of any tobacco product use. We wil l 
then conduct a 3-month follow -up to asses s own cigarette and e-cig use, risk perceptions, and 
future use intentions. This design addresses the six critical methodological issues for understanding the impact of alternative products outlined by [CONTACT_120231].
113: 1) rigorous ly 
assesses  the key outcome (conventional cigarettes smoked); 2) assesses product use during 
switching; 3) uses appropriate control/comparison groups; 4) measures product exposure/use that precedes switching; 5) evaluates the dose and duration of the product exposure/use; and 6) 
has clear evaluation of the type and quality of the products used (e.g., satisfaction).  
This mixed design study (within-subjects Patch factor: active nicotine and placebo patch; 
between-subjects Product factor: VLNC, e-cigarette, or no alternative product) will allow us to address key questions identified in the RFA -OD-18-002. Specifically, we will assess the 
potential “impact of novel and/or potential modified risk tobacco products on tobacco behavior ” 
and provide data that estimates the real -world impact of potential regulatory actions. To address 
these questions, this research will focus on the following aims: 
Primary  Aim:  Examine the ability of VLNCs and e-cigarettes to substitute for smokers’ 
usual cigarettes compared to each other and to no alternative product use in real -world settings 
(between-subjects effects) and whether these effects are influenced by [CONTACT_120232] (interaction with within-subject factor).  
Secondary Aims: Examine the main effects of VLNCs and e-cigarette use compared to 
each other and to no product use as well as their  interaction with active vs. placebo patch on: 1) 
the use of study alternative products, and 2) mechanisms underlying product use (e.g.,

Version Date: 2.17.2021 withdrawal alleviation, taste, satisfaction). We will also explore the contexts that promote or 
inhibit switching from conventional cigarettes to alternative products and whether participants’ risk perceptions and key person factors (e.g., gender, race, education, psychiatric comorbidity) influence switching, alternative product use, and the potential mechanisms that drive such use behavior.  
Recruitment and Study Entry  
Participants from the greater Madison and Milwaukee, WI areas will be recruited via 
media recruitment methods  (i.e., TV, newspaper, and earned media) that have recruited 
thousands of smokers86,87. We will also  use Internet/paid Facebook advertisements that have 
been successful in our recent e-cig  studies that recruited [ADDRESS_134488] eligibility confirmed, and provide written informed consent.  
Inclusion/Exclusion 
Eligibility criteria include: 1) ≥ 21 years old; 2) able to read and write English; 3) no plans 
to quit smoking in the next 30 days; 4) not currently taking smoking cessation medication; 5) willing and medically able to use nicotine patches, very low nicotine cigarettes, and e- cigarettes; 
6) not currently in treatment for psychosis or bipolar disorder; 7 ) smoking ≥ [ADDRESS_134489] 6 months; 8 ) exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) > 5 ppm; 9) no e-cig  use within the last 
month; and 10) not currently pregnant or breastfeeding. We chose to exclude recent e-cig  users 
to minimize the likelihood that participants would chose to use their own e-cig  vs. the study e-
cig. We opted not to ex clude ever e-cig users to enhance the external validity of these findings. 
Analyses will examine the influence of prior e-cig use. It should be noted that use of other tobacco products (e.g., cigars, chew, snus ) will not be exclusionary  to enhance the external 
validity of the findings , but we will track such use.  Incarcerated individuals will not be enrolled in 
this study. If study staff members learn that a participant is incarcerated at a time point subsequent to enrollment, the participant will be withdrawn.   
Study Visits and Phone Contacts 
Interested smokers will complete a phone screen to determine initial eligibility. 
Potentially eligible smokers will attend an Orientation visit where they will receive a detailed 
description of the study  and provide written informed consent. Participants will then provide a 
breath sample to verify eligibility  (CO > 5 ppm). Eligible participants will then be invited to 
complete the visit and  complete baseline assessments . Participants will also be trained to use 
the smartphone to complete daily assessments, using the training that was effective in our prior research, and will schedule future study visits  (see Table 1) . At Visit 1, participants will be 
randomized to receive VLNCs, e-cigs, or no alternative product and will be trained to use the

Version Date: 2.17.[ADDRESS_134490] [if applicable]. The study database will randomize participants, stratified by [CONTACT_6903], 
gender, and race [White vs. Non-W hite], to enhance scientific rigor and reproducibility . 
Participants will use their alternative products as they would like for one week to become 
comfortable with the product114. Participants will also provide a urine sample for cotinine 
assessment and be given eight study patches to use during Switch Week 1 when all participants  
will be asked to abstain from using their own cigarettes for the week. At Visit 2, all participants 
will complete assessments, provide a breath sample for CO assessment and a urine  sample for 
cotinine assessment, receive feedback on their compliance with the smartphone assessments . 
All participants will then attend a mid-Switch Week visit (Visit 3) and an end-of-Switch  Week visit 
(Visit 4) to assess biomarkers (a breath sample for CO assessment and a urine sample for 
cotinine). At Visit 4, the end of Switch Week 1, all participants will be told that they can smoke 
as usual for a week. In addition, all participants will be given the other type of patch (active or 
placebo) and asked to use these patches at the start of Switch Week 2 (Visit 5) when they are asked to abstain from smoking their own cigarettes for a week . As during the prior Switch Week, 
all participants will attend visits mid-week and at the end of the week to assess biomarkers 
(Visits 6 and 7). To enhance reproducibility , we will attempt to schedule appointments at the 
same time of day (i.e., within a 2-hour window) for each participant so that there is consistent 
time for product use prior to providing the biological samples across study visits. We opted to use a 7-day switching period to provide a stronger test of the ability of these alternative products to substitute for cigarettes than in our prior study
50 (A.5.1), but to minimize the retention 
problems seen in studies with longer switches112. There are also strong theoretical and empi[INVESTIGATOR_120205] 7 days of switching, and this design will allow sampling of the full range of work/non-
work environments for most participants115. Participants will complete a follow -up assessment 
call at [ADDRESS_134491] < 30 minutes .

After providing consent at the Orientation visit, study staff will ask if the participant gives 
the study permission to stay in touch with them and send them reminders about upcoming study 
contacts during the study via email and/or  text message. The staff member will remind them that 
email and text messaging are generally not a secure way to communicate about their  health as 
there are many ways for unauthorized users to access email and text messages. The staff 
member will also inform them that they do not have to provide their  email address or text 
message number to participate in this study.  
Assessm ent s  
          To address the primary aim of examining whether VLNCs and e-cig s serve as effective 
substitutes for conventional  cigarettes, and whether use of these alternative products interacts  
with nicotine replacement, we will conduct extensive assessments of participants’ use of their 
own cigarettes, their use of their assigned alternative products, use contexts, and potential motivators for such use behavior (e.g., withdrawal, reward value of products, risk perceptions ). 
We will also assess person factors and beliefs that may prov ide insight into who is able and 
willing to use these alternative products to substitute for cigarettes  and which mechanisms 
might be more relevant for which smokers . To the extent possible we will use measures from 
the PhenX Toolkit, a collection of broadly validated measures, to enhance the ability to harmonize data from this study with other studies. See Table [ADDRESS_134493] of Cigarette Dependence (FTCD123,124) and the Brief Wisconsin Inventory of 
Smoking Dependence Motives ( Brief WISDM125). We will assess risk perceptions of 
conventional cigarettes, VLNCs, e-cig s, and patches using items that target the four key 
constructs identified by [CONTACT_120233] (TCORS) network: 1) perceptions of benefits, 2) harm perceptions, 3) addiction perceptions, and 4) perceptions of social norms
126. These assessments will be repeated at Visit [ADDRESS_134494] Scale ( PANAS127), withdrawal symptoms 
using the validated Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale (WSWS128), and craving using the 
Brief Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU -Brief129,130) from the PhenX Tool kit. At Visits 1 
through 7 participants will complete the modified Cigarette Evaluation Scale (mCES71,131,132) for 
cigarettes and at Visits [ADDRESS_134495] sensations, and craving reduction. We will use timeline follow -back methods
133,134 to assess daily  use of 
participants’  own cigarettes, assigned alternative products, and patch if the visit occurs during a 
Switch Week. These data will be used to supplement EMA reports in case of missing EMA data. Participants will also be asked at all visits except Visit 1 (when they will not have any study 
products or medication yet) about any possible adverse events from using VLNCs, e-cigs or the 
patches
135. At the final visit (Visit 7), we will again assess acceptability, risk perceptions, and

Version Date: 2.17.[ADDRESS_134496] carbon monoxide (CO) and cotinine assays. Participants will be told that these tests are used to reflect conventional cigarette and alternative product use, and we will emphasize the 
importance of accurate reporting of cigarette and alternative product use.  
We cannot biochemically verify abstinence from conventional cigarettes in this research 
due to the experimental conditions and the clearance rates of CO and cotinine. Specifically, we cannot biochemically verify complete substitution in the VLNC group during the active patch Switch Week because VLNCs still produce CO and cotinine is a nicotine metabolite that cannot distinguish the source of nicotine (i.e., from a combustible cigarette vs. a nicotine replacement 
product). Further, CO can be used to biochemically verify abstinence only within the last 12-18 
hours, given its short half-life (4.5 hours
137), making it impossible to verify smoking that might 
have occurred more than one day prior to the assay. Cotinine’s half-life is 10-[ADDRESS_134497] the participant’s urine and follow procedures according to NicAlert directions (see product insert) to get a test reading within the same day. All samples and test 
results will be labeled with the date of collection and the subject's numerical ID. Urine will be 
disposed of after cotinine levels are read and recorded.  
We will use an exhaled CO < 6 ppm to indicate recent abstinence from combustible 
products, based on Perkins’ cut-off of <5 ppm using a Breathco CO monitor
139, which is similar 
to the Vitalograph brand, and produces CO values approximately 1-2 ppm lower than the Bedfont Smokerlyzer monitors
140 we will use in this research. Cotinine will be assessed using 
NicAlert strips, an immunochromatographic  assay that uses  monoclonal antibody-coated gold 
particles  and a series of avidity traps to quantify  cotinine level. We will use the <100 ng/ml cut-
off for non-tobacco users recommended by [CONTACT_120234]. The NicAlert stri ps have 91% specificity and 92% sensitivity at this cut-off compared to liquid 
chromatography -mass spectrometry
141. To maintain the patch double-blind and enhance the 
scientific rigor, study staff who have no contact [CONTACT_120235].  
  Ecological momentary assessments.  We will assess cigarette and alternative product 
use in real time in the real -world environment (i.e., ecological momentary assessment [EMA ]) 
using a smartphone app we have used in our prior research. Participants  can choose to have 
the app downloaded on their own smartphone or they will be given a smartphone at the Orientation visit and will be trained to press a button marked “C igarette” every time they start a 
new cigarette and to press one marked “ JUUL ” or “Study Cigarette” every time they use a VLNC 
or e-cig (which they will be able to use after Visit 1) . Participants randomized to receive no 
alternative product will just record their cigarette use. Daily, e ach time someone presses a 
product use button (either to say they used the alternative product or to say they smoked their

minutes) will be triggered that will include: 1) time since prior use of cigarette/alternative 
product), 2) use context (e.g., smoking prohibited, others vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/smoking, home, work), activity, 
and withdrawal symptoms and affect prior to use, and 3) individual items from the mCES that 
tap potential mechanisms (e.g., product satisfaction, psychological reward, aversion, enjoyment 
of respi[INVESTIGATOR_120206], and craving reduction). The comprehensive assessments will be specific for each type of use event (i.e., cigarettes, VLNCs, and e-cigs) . All participants will 
complete an evening assessment prior to going to bed. Evening reports (5 minutes ) will assess: 
affect, withdrawal , use of cigarettes and alternative products, overall satisfaction with 
cigarettes/alternative products , use of patch during Switch Weeks, smoking cues, stressors, and 
pleasure in daily activities. Participants will spend less than [ADDRESS_134498] been 
successful in our earlier work: training in assessments, ability to briefly postpone assessments , 
use of counters, etc.50,86,143. This frequency of assessment is of moderate intensity relative to 
protocols used in our prior work86.  
  Follow -up assessment call. Three months after Visit 1, participants will complete a 
brief follow -up assessment call to assess current smoking, use of any alternative products, 
motivation and self-efficacy for smoking cessation, risk perceptions, and future plans to use 
VLNCs, e -cigs, and patches. 
 Participants who are interested in quitting smoking after Visit 7 will be offered the 
Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line toll -free number? (1-800-QUIT -NOW 784- 8669) and the phone 
number(s) for smoking cessation studies being conducted at our Center.  
Alternative Products and the Nicotine Patch 
           The goal of this research is to examine the potential  impact of alternative tobacco 
products on the use of conventional  cigarettes , alone and in combination with nicotine 
replacement, to simulate a potential regulatory scenario in which a variety of tobacco and 
nicotine products are available that vary in degree of risk, similarity to cigarettes, and 
acceptability. Therefore, we opted to use two products that have shown potential to substitute for traditional cigarettes: very low nicotine content cigarettes (VLNCs) and the Juul e-cig.  
VLNCs.  Participants randomized to receive VLNCs will receive NIDA’s reduced nicotine 
cigarettes with 0.03 (±0.01) mg of nicotine with a tar yield of 9±1.5 via NIDA’s Drug Supply 
Program (NOT -DA-14-004). These cigarettes have been characterized by [CONTACT_120236]
116. Participants will be able to choose either menthol or non-menthol VLNC’s 
consistent with prior research (e.g., 100) and to enhance the external validity of these findings. 
Participants will be instructed to smoke the VLNCs the same way they would their own cigarettes and will be given enough VLNCs to completely substitute for their own cigarettes during the Switch Weeks (i.e., if they smoke 20 cigarettes per day, they will receive enough VLNCs to be able to smoke 20 VLNCs  per day).  
One real -world safety concern with VLNC  use is that it  might result in compensatory 
smoking or oversmoking and increased exposure to carcinogens
117. However, many studies 
have shown that smokers engage in minimal or no compensatory smoking73,82,83,102,118. If 
participants in this condition need more VLNCs, they will be provided with additional VLNCs at subsequent study visits. However, we will monitor compensatory smoking by [CONTACT_120237]/day as well as carbon monoxide (CO) levels. Participants found to be smoking more than twice their usual cigarettes/day or who demonstrate a CO ≥100 ppm  will be

67,97,119,120 and this study will produce a very brief exposure (i.e., only 4 weeks, which is 
less than the 6 weeks used by [CONTACT_7714]67,83,97).  
E-cigarettes. Participants randomized to receive e-cigs will receive a Juul e -cig and 4 
weeks of pods. Each Juul pod of e-liquid contains 0.7ml nicotine by [CONTACT_8544] / 5% nicotine by 
[CONTACT_8497]. Participants will be given a choice of four flavors: tobacco and menthol . To enhance 
external validity, parti cipants  will be allowed to choose different flavor s at each study visit if they 
wish. Each pod is considered to be the equivalent of [ADDRESS_134500] week so that they feel comfortable using it 
during the Switch Weeks and are able to titrate their nicotine consumption. 
Nicotine patches. During the Switch Weeks, all participants will receive 8 patches  (7 
days’ worth plus one extra in case of mishaps), placebo patches for one Switch Week and 
active patches for the other, in counterbalanced order. Both staff and participants will be blind to 
patch type. Active patch dosing will be based on the package insert: >10 cigs/day = 21 mg 
patch and ≤10 cigs/day = [ADDRESS_134501]’s ability to replace 
conventional cigarettes. We opted to use the highest dose of nicotine patch appropriate based 
on daily smoking to maximize the potential effect of nicotine replacement. However, if 
participants experience symptoms of nicotine overdose (e.g., nausea, dizziness), they will be 
told to remove the patch. Our prior research suggests that the majority of smokers are able to 
tolerate both a 21 mg patch and ad lib u se of other nicotine replacement86,87. We are currently 
conducting a study with active and placebo patches , and the  two types of patches  are visually 
identical. We will use the same vendor for this research.  
All study products (nicotine and placebo patches, JUUL e-cigarettes, and very low 
nicotine cigarettes) wi ll be received from vendors at the Center for Tobacco Research and 
Intervention Madison offic e. Products stored in a locked room or cabinet at the Madison and 
Milwaukee research sites  until processed and portioned for dispensing. Dissemination bags 
containing processed study product will be labeled with Study ID and participant initials and 
stored in secure, locked cabinets, closets or rooms in Madison and Milwaukee. Study staff with 
no contact [CONTACT_120238]-blind on the patches. Participants will be asked to return all unused patches, VLNCs and 
JUUL pods as well as the JUUL device at the end of the study. Participants in the JUUL 
condition will also be asked to return used JUUL pods  at each study visit.  
Promoting Continued Experimental Participation 
  We will promote participation and adherence to study procedures using strategies that 
were effective in our prior research.  We will: 1) allow flexibility in s cheduling144-146; 2) provide 
participants with a single, consistent liaison144,147,148; 3) ensure that research staff are culturally 
sensitive149,150; 4) send reminder letters prior to the Month 3 follow -up call and make reminder 
calls to remind participants about their Orientation Visit and Visits 1, 2 and 5; and 5) compensate participants for their time
147. Specifically, participants will be paid $20 for 
completing each of the 8 study visit s and the 3- month follow -up call (up to $180) , and $200 for 
completing 80% of the EMA prompt s or $150 for completing 75% of the EMA prompt s.

Analytic Plan  
The primary aim of this research is to examine the ability of VLNC s and e-cigs to 
substitute for smokers’ usual cigarettes compared to each other and to no alternative product 
use (Product between-subjects effects) and whether these effects are influenced by [CONTACT_120239] -
state nicotine (Patch within-subjects factor : active vs. placebo  patch). The primary analysis 
model will consist of a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) with three levels of the Product 
between-subjects factor (VLNCs , e-cigs, no alternative product) and two levels of the Patch 
within-subjects factor (active nicotine patch, placebo patch). To address the primary a im, we will 
explore statistically significant main or interaction effects in the mixed ANOVA by [CONTACT_120240], interaction contrasts, a nd pairwise comparisons
156,157. 
Specifically, w e will examine the main effect of Product to evaluate the hypothesis that 
participants who do not have an alternative product will report smoking significantly more of their own cigarettes during the Switch Weeks compared to those who have VLNCs or e-cigs. We will 
also conduct a pairwise comparison to explore whether there is a significant difference in the 
number of conventional cigarettes smoked in the VLNC vs. e-cig conditions . We will use the 
main effect of Patch (active vs. placebo)  to evaluate the hypothesi s that participants will report 
smoking fewer of their own cigarettes during Switch Weeks when they receive active nicotine 
patches compared to placebo patches. We will also test the Patch x Product interaction, with follow -up pairwise comparisons, to examine whether steady -state ni cotine produces a 
differential effect on the number of conventional cigarettes smoked, based on which alternative product a participant was assigned to receive.  
The primary outcome is the number of conventional  cigarettes smoked during each 
Switch Week. Based on the literature and our own research, it is possible this outcome will not 
be norm ally distributed (i.e., a substantive proportion of participants may smoke no conventional  
cigarettes during a Switch Week). Therefore, prior to conducting main analyses, we will examine the distributional characteristics of the primary outcome to determine if a transformation is needed (e.g., if the distribution substantially deviates from a normal distribution).  
The secondary outcome is number of VLNCs or JUUL pods used during each switch 
week. This research will also examine the main effects for Product and Patch and the Product X 
Patch interaction effect on other exploratory  outcomes : 1) the proportion of conventional 
cigarettes replaced; 2) the use of alternative tobacco products ; 3) use contexts; and 4) potential 
mechanisms such as rewarding value of the alternative products and conventional  cigarettes, 
alleviation of withdrawal symptoms, and taste. We will also explore the impact of person factors (e.g., sex, education, psychiatric comorbidity, dependence) and risk perceptions on the primary , 
secondary , and exploratory  outcomes. We will include these variables  as covariates in the 
analyses , and we will include covariate interaction terms with the between- and within-subjects 
factors  (e.g., sex x Product; sex x Product x Patch) to determine whether these individual 
difference variables moderate the ability of the alternative products to substitute for conventional cigarettes. To examine use contexts and putative mechanisms  driving alternative product use 
and substitution for conventional cigarettes, we will use the daily EMA data from the evening 
reports as well as data from the quasi -random daily assessments that will be collected during 
the Switch W eeks as described above as the exploratory outcome variables. One set of 
analyses will test summary versions of the outcomes (e.g., means or counts across the Switch Weeks); another set of more fine-grained analyses will preserve the intensive longitudinal data 
(ILD) aspect of the EMA data collected during each of the [ADDRESS_134502] use events per day reported during the Switch Weeks and the context

Version Date: 2.17.2021 and mechanisms variables will be based on means across the 7 days of the Switch Weeks. For 
these summary outcomes, we will use statistical models similar to the analyses described above 
for the primary outcome. For the ILD outcomes, we will create one set of outcomes based on the evening report that assesses experiences across the full day and another set based on the 3 quasi -random comprehensive assessments that occur during the day. For the ILD versions of 
the outcomes, we will use conditional growth curve models that permit slope and intercept parameters to be evaluated across the 7 days of the Switch Weeks as a function of group; these 
models also permit examination of other forms of change over time (e.g., linear, quadratic, cubic). We will explore two main approaches to growth curve modeling: a multilevel modeling (MLM) approach
158 and a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach159. Although similar, 
each of these modeling approaches has advantages and disadvantages160 that we will exploit in 
exploratory analyses. While we are not powered to detect mediation due to funding limitations, 
we will conduct exploratory mediation analyses to provide information for future research on whether  these mechanisms mediate the effects of alternative product use on the use of 
conventional cigarettes.  
Power for Primary Aim Hypotheses 
With attrition -adjusted n= [ADDRESS_134503] a difference of 3.3 cigarettes  (SD=6); a corresponding within-
subjects pairwise comparison (SD=6, correlation=0.5) is powered to detect a difference of 2.8 
cigarettes. Thus, we feel that a total N=[ADDRESS_134504] predicted 
effects.  
Protection of Human Subjects 
Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics. A total of 225 participants 
smokers will be recruited to participate in the proposed research. Specific eligibility 
requirements are: 1) ≥ 21 years old; 2) able to read and write English; 3) no plans to quit 
smoking in the next 30 days; 4) not currently taking smoking cessation medi cation; 5) willing 
and medically able to use nicotine patches; 6) not currently in treatment for psychosis or bipolar 
disorder; 7) smoking ≥ [ADDRESS_134505] 6 months; 8 ) exhaled carbon monoxide 
(CO) > 5 ppm; 9) no e-cig  use within the last month; and 10) not currently pregnant or 
breastfeeding. Use of other tobacco products (e.g., cigars, chew, snus ) will not be exclusionary, 
but we will track such use. Vulnerable populations (e.g., children under 18, prisoners) will not be 
included in the proposed research.  
Sources of Materials. Participants in this study will provide data for the express 
purpose of research. Data collected from participants in this research will consist of: 1) answers 
to questionnaires and interviews assessing tobacco use history, demographics, nicotine 
dependence, affect and psychiatric history, and risk perceptions of cigarettes and alternative 
products; 2) recording of their own cigarette use and alternative product use and responses to 
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) prompts on a smartphone; 3) breath samples to

conventional cigarette (National Academy of Sciences, 2018). However, participants may experience sore throat or dry mouth. Recently the FDA has reported that users of e- cigarettes 
have experienced seizures, mostly among adolescent and young adult users. The risks 
associated with the nicotine patch are sufficiently minimal that they are available over the 
counter. The nicotine patch is generally well tolerated, but up to 50% of participants may have a 
local skin  reaction, and rarely, individuals may have a more systemic allergic reaction. Although 
most smokers have tolerance to nicotine, symptoms of acute nicotine toxicity (nausea and 
vomiting) are possible, especially in conditions where participants receive e-cigarettes and the 
active nicotine patch.  
Finally, there is a small risk of loss of confidentiality. This could occur through a number 
of possible avenues, all highly unlikely due to the data security measures in place. The 
University of Wisconsin’s Center for Tobacco Resesarch and Intervention ( UW-CTRI) computer 
system is linked to the UW network through a firewall, which is managed by [CONTACT_120242], via a fiber link which is maintained by [CONTACT_120243]. No data are stored on individual computer hard drives. All 
data are transmitted from the point of collection to the UW-CTRI server through secure, 
encrypted web connection. There are rare occasions when, due to a loss of internet access or 
computer hardware failure, data are collected in paper forms, which could be taken or lost. In 
addition, consent forms are obtained in paper copy; these forms contain the participant name [CONTACT_120254]. Finally, the University of Wisconsin and the National Cancer Institute may inspect 
the signed consent forms. Because of this possible need to release information to these parties, 
we cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality.  
Participants will be informed about all of these risks prior to providing written informed 
consent.  
Adequacy of Protection Against Risks 
 Recruitment and Informed Consent. Participants will be recruited from the greater 
Madison and Milwaukee, WI areas via the media recruitment methods  (i.e., TV, newspaper, and 
earned media) that have recruited thousands of smokers. We will also use Internet/Facebook 
advertisements that have been successful in our recent e-cig studies. Interested potential 
participants will contact [CONTACT_120244]. Study staff will call interested potential participants 
within 48-[ADDRESS_134507] and screen for eligibility. If the person 
is interested and eligible, an in-person Orientation Visit will be scheduled. At this visit, the 
smoker will learn about general requirements for participation (e.g., need to switch from using 
their own cigarettes for 2 7-day Switch Weeks, participation in assessments) as well as risks 
associated with nicotine withdrawal, alternate product use, patch use, and the possible loss of 
confidentiality. Study staff will then provide each study candidate with an IRB-approved

be immediately reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_120209].  
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) are investigating recent reports of serious lung disease associated with 
the use of vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/e-cigarette devices. Many of the illnesses are related to vapi[INVESTIGATOR_120210]. 
The FDA has advised people to avoid buying vapi[INVESTIGATOR_120211], to refrain from 
vapi[INVESTIGATOR_120212], and to not modify or add any substance to vapi[INVESTIGATOR_120213]. We will tell all participants that if they  use a vapi[INVESTIGATOR_120214]/e-cigarette products, they  
should watch for symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, and weight loss, and get medical attention right away 
for any health concerns. They can also call their  local poison control center at [PHONE_2744]. 
To facilitate safety, participants who are not be medically appropriate to use the nicotine 
patch will not be included in the study (e.g., no previous allergic reactions). Once enrolled, study  
protocols will assess side effects and unanticipated health events at all study visits and follow -
up contacts. We will recommend using a lower dose patch or no patch if the participant 
experiences symptoms of nicotine toxicity or other troublesome side effects during their Switch

Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Participants and Others  
There are no specific benefits for smokers participating in this study, beyond the benefit 
of helpi[INVESTIGATOR_120215] -state nicotine.  
Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained 
The results from this research will provide important insight into how well very low 
nicotine cigarettes and e -cigarettes serve as a substitute for conventional cigarettes and how 
this is influenced by [CONTACT_120245] -state nicotine. Further, these data will inform 
scientists and regulators about the potential mechanisms that may support the use of alternative 
products. This information will aid scientists and regulatory bodies in understanding the real -
world impact of potential regulatory policies regarding access to safer nicotine sources and reducing the addiction potential of combustible tobacco products.  
 As outlined above, the risks of this study are minimal and limited to the discomfort of 
withdrawal , the use of alternate products and the nicotine patch, and the small risk of breach of 
confidentiality. The potential study impact on informing the science and policy debate over nicotine regulation far outweigh these risks.  
Data and Safety and Monitoring Plan

participation. In addition, SAEs or AEs that raise concerns (e.g., allergic reaction, significant 
change in mood or suicidality) will be immediately reported to the study physician who will 
determine an appropriate course of action, which may include discontinuation of study products . 
As data become available, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_120217] a regularly scheduled basis (initially weekly and later monthly) to determine progress. To facilitate 
participant safety, study participants must meet study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Once 
enrol led, study protocols will assess the presence of AEs and SAEs at all study contacts, with 
the exception of the final assessment call 3 months after the use of study products. Should either excessive risk to study participants be determined, the study will be stopped and all 
participants notified in a manner appropriate to the nature of the risk and/or lack of benefit. 
When taking that step the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_120218]. 
Plans for the reporting of unanticipated health events. This DSMP requires that the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_120219] a timely manner 
(consistent with IRB and NIH policies) of the occurrence of any SAE or any AE that is severe, 
unexpected, and possibly related to study products  or protocol. Because this study involves a 
pharmaceutical agent, if an SAE might be related to study patch use, both the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer will also be notified within five days of investigators 
becoming aware of the event. Examples of SAE would be untoward medical or intervention 
occurrences that result in death, are life-threatening, require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120220], create persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or involve congenital 
abnormality/birth defects. Unanticipated problems will be monitored and reported to the DSMC. 
These are events that meet the following criteria: 1) suggest the research places subjects or 
others at increased risk of harm, 2) are unexpected (in terms of nature, severity or frequency) 
given the research procedures that are described in the study -related documents, and 3) 
possibly related to study participation. Any SAE will be queried and reported if it meets the definition of unanticipated problem. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_120221], investigation and follow -up of all study -related adverse events. 
Adverse event assessment, recording, reporting, and investigation will be accomplished through staff training, structured/standardized assessments of untoward occurrences/events, and

Additionally, the IRB will receive an annual report of all SAEs and AEs meeting the criteria listed 
above.

Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
In addition to the protections outlined in the DSMP (above), this research project will  have an 
independent Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The DSMP specifies overall 
monitoring that will be conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_678], including timely reporting of AEs and 
SAEs. Every six months, the DSMC will convene to review the overall safety data, as well as 
data on safety summarized by [CONTACT_120247]. As per NIH guidelines, the objective of these 
reviews will be to determine whether continued conduct of the research poses any undue risk 
for participants.  
The existing DSMC is chaired by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. James Cleary, leader of the Cancer Control Program of the 
UW Comprehensive Cancer Center. [CONTACT_120255] is an experienced physician and clinical trial 
researcher with no involvement in any of this project’s research activities. [CONTACT_120255] is joined on

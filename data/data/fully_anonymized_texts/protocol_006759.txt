2PRÉCIS 
Background:
•High grade (G3) non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (stages Ta, T1, and 
CIS) has a high rate of recurrence and progression
•The standard of care therapeutic agent is a single induction course of bacillus Calmette-
Guerin (BCG)
•Although a second induction course can be used in patients who fail a single induction course 
of BCG, only 35% of patients who failed an initial induction course will experience 12 
month disease-free survival after receiving a second induction course 
•For those patients failing a second induction course, radical cystectomy with pelvic 
lymphadenectomy is the recommended treatment, although it has a high morbidity rate and a 
small but real mortality rate
•Therefore, there is an unmet need for localized treatment for patients who fail an initial 
induction course of BCG that can potentially improve upon the poor results of a second 
induction course of BCG
•Recently, a unique pox viral vector-based vaccine, PANVAC™, has been shown to induce a 
CD4 and CD8 antigen-specific immune response against the tumor-associated antigens 
(TAAs), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and mucin-1 (MUC-1).  This vaccine also 
contains transgenes for three human T cell co-stimulatory molecules that can potentially 
augment an immune response
•We hypothesize that the combined administration of BCG and PANVAC™ may augment the 
BCG-induced cytotoxic T lymphocyte response against bladder cancer cells expressing 
MUC-1 and/or CEA and potentially reverse BCG failure in patients that have failed one 
induction course of BCG
Objectives:
•To determine if there is an improvement in disease-free survival (DFS*) with BCG + 
PANVAC compared with BCG alone in a phase II study in non-muscle invasive high-grade 
urothelial carcinoma of the bladder who have failed to respond to intravesical BCG.
*within [ADDRESS_1059766] treatment
Eligibility:
•Individuals who have failed at least one previous induction course of intravesical BCG, 
defined as histologically confirmed persistent or relapsing tumor present on post-BCG 
endoscopic evaluation.  All BCG failures will be considered for inclusion into the study, 
including BCG-refractory, -resistant, and -relapsing, as defined in the “Rationale and 
Background.”  For the purposes of the study, “BCG-refractory” and “BCG-resistant” subjects 
will be considered to have “BCG-persistent” disease.
•Patients who are not currently candidates for radical cystectomy (e.g. patient refuses surgery, 
comorbidities preclude major surgery, etc.).
•Normal organ function, ECOG 0-2.

3Design:
•This is a randomized, open label prospective, Phase II study in subjects with non-muscle 
invasive high grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder who have failed at least one 
induction course of intravesical BCG, randomized to one of the following arms:  TICE BCG 
+PANVAC™ or TICE BCG alone. Randomization is stratified by [CONTACT_771948].
•All subjects will receive intravesical TICE BCG (50mg) as per usual standard of care once 
weekly (+/- 2 days) starting in week 3 for a total of 6 weeks.
•The combination arm will receive the pox viral vaccines that contain the transgenes for CEA 
and MUC-1 (both with modified HLA-A2 agonist epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]) as well as 3 human T-cell 
costimulatory molecules, B7-1, ICAM-1, and LFA-3 [rV-PANVAC™ (vaccinia) and rF-
PANVAC™ (fowlpox)] as follows:
orV-PANVAC™ 2 x 108 pfu SQ at week 0 (+/- 7 days) only.
orF-PANVAC™1 x 109 pfu SQ at weeks (+/- 7 days) 3, 7, 11, and 15.
•For this Phase II study, we will test the hypothesis that subjects in the TICE BCG 
+PANVAC™ arm have better disease-free survival than subjects in the TICE BCG alone 
arm.
•Patient accrual is targeted at one patient per month during the first [ADDRESS_1059767] treatment.
•Based on a power of 84% and type 1 error (1-sided) of 0.15, a total of 49 subjects will need 
to be accrued.
•Allowing for a proportion of the subjects not being evaluable, a maximum of 54 subjects will 
be accrued.

81 OBJECTIVES
1.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
1.1.1 To determine if there is an improvement in disease-free survival (DFS*) with BCG + 
PANVAC compared with BCG alone in a phase II study in non-muscle invasive high-
grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder who have failed to respond to intravesical 
BCG. *within [ADDRESS_1059772]-treatment in both arms
1.3.4 To assess the presence of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in bladder tumor 
specimens pre- and post-treatment in both arms
1.3.5 To measure the CD4 antigen-specific response to CEA in peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) obtained from blood
1.3.[ADDRESS_1059773] the HLA-A2 allele in PBMCs obtained from blood

1.3.[ADDRESS_1059774] common 
cancer in women.  An estimated 73,510 people living in the [LOCATION_002] will be diagnosed with 
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/[ADDRESS_1059775] of these patients (>75%) will be diagnosed with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and 
approximately 50% of these patients will present with high grade disease.2  High grade non-
muscle invasive bladder cancer (Ta, T1, and/or CIS) is difficult to treat because of high rates of 
recurrence and progression. The last major advance in bladder cancer therapy was the approval 
of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in 1990 by [CONTACT_1622].3  Currently, intravesical BCG given as 
an induction course (6 weeks of intravesical therapy) is the standard of care4,5 followed by 
[CONTACT_149303]. BCG has an initial failure rate of ~35% in terms of disease recurrence or 
progression.  In ~20-35% of cases that failed an initial induction course of BCG, a second course 
of induction BCG may be beneficial, but patients who fail two courses are often best served by 
[CONTACT_268216].6-[ADDRESS_1059776] 1/3 of these patients.  This surgery 
involves the en bloc removal of the bladder and adjacent organs (prostate in males and uterus in 
females) and concomitant creation of a urinary diversion, which can affect a patient’s quality-of-
life significantly.  Moreover, Shabsigh et al. reported that 64% of patients who undergo 
cystectomy suffer at least one complication within the first [ADDRESS_1059777] a 2.5% perioperative mortality rate even at a high-
volume center.[ADDRESS_1059778] is reflected in a 2003 survey, which showed that 81% of urologists 
were reluctant to refer their patients to radical cystectomy despi[INVESTIGATOR_771913] 2 courses of intravescial 
therapy.11  In summary, radical cystectomy has the potential for significant morbidity and 
therefore, an unmet clinical need for intravesical therapy exists for these high grade non-muscle 
invasive bladder cancers that fail BCG.
BCG failures can be subdivided into several groups based on the time to tumor response and/or 
recurrence.[ADDRESS_1059779] responders to 
therapy.
BCG works by [CONTACT_771950]. The immune system is critical as the administration of T 
cells to athymic animals has been shown to restore their ability to respond to BCG therapy.13,14   
A hypothesized mechanism for BCG is that it induces macrophage cytotoxicity and that Th1 
immune system cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-12, and IL-18) play a positive role in the 
macrophage cytotoxicity while Th2 immune system cytokines (e.g. IL-4, IL-10) and T regulatory 
cells (Tregs) are potentially inhibitory to this BCG-induced macrophage cytotoxicity.15  T cell 
infiltration appears important as the degree of infiltration (CD3, CD4, and CD8) has been shown 
to be significantly greater in patients with a complete response to BCG in comparison to patients 
with a partial response or treatment failure.16
Modulation of the immune system is one strategy employed in cancer therapeutics.  Tumor 
associated antigens (TAAs), which are unique molecules minimally expressed by [CONTACT_771951]-expressed in cancer cells, can be used as immunologic targets.  Recently, researchers at 
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/[ADDRESS_1059780] developed a poxvirus cancer vaccine therapy called PANVAC™ that has 
demonstrated therapeutic efficacy against a variety of carcinomas. PANVAC™ consists of a 
primary vaccination with a replication competent recombinant vaccinia (rV-) viral vector 
followed by [CONTACT_771952] a replication-incompetent recombinant fowlpox 
(rF-) viral vector. These vectors contain transgenes for both TAAs and human T cell co-
stimulatory molecules. Although TAAs are weakly immunogenic, a method of disrupting 
immune tolerance is to introduce TAAs to the immune system through poxviral vectors.[ADDRESS_1059781] specific TAAs using vaccines that express one or more of these 
antigens.  
The TAAs in PANVAC™ are epi[INVESTIGATOR_719293]-1 (MUC-1) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 
which are altered and overexpressed in many cancers.[ADDRESS_1059782] all human carcinomas.  Furthermore, it 
has been demonstrated that the c-terminus of MUC-1 functions as an oncogene.19,20  According 
to one study, MUC-1 is present in all cases of malignant urothelium, but increased expression is 
noted with higher grade and stage tumors.21  Another study demonstrated MUC-1 expression in 
93% of bladder tumors studied.[ADDRESS_1059783], and gastric tumors.23  
CEA is expressed in 76% of high grade tumors and in 59% of pT1 bladder tumors.[ADDRESS_1059784] signal is antigen specific, 
delivered through the T-cell receptor via the peptide/MHC, and causes the T cell to enter the cell 
cycle. The second, “co-stimulatory,” signal is required for cytokine production and proliferation. 
At least three distinct molecules normally found on the surface of professional antigen-
presenting cells have been reported to be capable of providing the second signal critical for T-
cell activation: B7-1, ICAM-1, and LFA-3. Both antigen and co-stimulatory molecules must be 
expressed in the same cell to properly engage the TCR and co-stimulatory receptor. In order to 
achieve this, multigene constructs using poxviral vectors (avipox and vaccinia) have been 
generated.  The co-stimulatory molecules are B7.1 (CD80), ICAM01 (CD54), and LFA-3 
(CD58) and are referred to as TRICOM (triad of co-stimulatory molecules).25  Each of these co-
stimulatory molecules binds to a different ligand, and the second messenger pathways of each 
ligand are unique, raising the potential for synergy of these molecules.  The vaccines are 
therefore, summarized as rV-CEA-MUC-1-TRICOM (rV-PANVAC™) and rF-CEA-MUC-1-
TRICOM (rF-PANVAC™).  
PANVAC™ is injected subcutaneously, processed by [CONTACT_488] -presenting cells (APCs), and then 
induces CEA - and MUC-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses that are then potentiated 
by [CONTACT_22888]-stimulatory molecules. The pox viral vectors have a high rate of cellular infection, can 
carry large amounts of transgenes, process genes in the cytoplasm of infected cells with a low 
risk of incorporation within the host genome, and have an established history of clinical safety in 
patients.  In fact, several hundred patients have already been treated on clinical trials with pox 
viral vectors and there have been no dose limiting toxicities attributable to these vaccines.18

11Initial studies with PANVAC showed that it was well tolerated and was associated with objective 
responses in some patients. One patient with metastatic ovarian cancer and symptomatic ascites 
had complete resolution of her ascites and normalization of her CA-125 (from 300 to <20) for [ADDRESS_1059785] cancer and randomized them to 
weekly docetaxel with PANVAC monthly vs. docetaxel alone. The primary endpoint was PFS. 
The median PFS for patients randomized to the combination arm was 6.6 months vs. 3.8 months 
in the chemotherapy alone arm.28
A phase II randomized controlled study involved 74 patients with completely resected metastases 
from colorectal cancer, who had received perioperative chemotherapy.29  Patients were 
randomized to receive 4 vaccinations with either PANVAC or dendritic cells modified with 
PANVAC. There was no significant difference in 2-year recurrence-free survival among the DC 
arm (50%), the PANVAC arm (56%), and a contemporary control arm (55%). However, at a 
median follow-up of 40 months, the survival rate for vaccinated patients was 81%, which far 
exceeded that of the unvaccinated controls. 
Recently, a PSA specific vaccine, rV-PSA TRICOM and rF-PSA-TRICOM, was evaluated in a 
randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded Phase II study for minimally symptomatic metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer. Although no difference in progression free survival was 
noted, patients receiving the vaccine had longer median survival by 8.[ADDRESS_1059786] ratio 
of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.85), p=0.0061.[ADDRESS_1059787] an incomplete or inefficient immune response.  Given that CEA 
and MUC-1 are overexpressed in bladder cancer, we hypothesize that PANVAC™ will augment 
the BCG-induced cytotoxic T lymphocyte response against bladder cancer cells expressing 
MUC-1 and/or CEA, which will clinically result in a greater disease-free survival rate than BCG 
alone in patients who have failed at least one previous course of intravesical BCG. We also 
hypothesize that the PANVAC+BCG group will demonstrate decreased tumor upgrading and 
tumor upstaging, particularly with regards to invasion of the detrusor musculature, and predict 
that the combination treatment will not demonstrate greater treatment-related toxicities to 
intravesical BCG alone.  Finally, we hypothesize that the immune response will be augmented in 
the PANVAC+BCG group compared to BCG alone as measured by [CONTACT_771953].

174 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES
4.1 GENERAL GUIDELINES
Eligible patients will be entered on study centrally at the CCR by [CONTACT_408].  
Issues that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator.  
Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order DCTD-supplied 
agents directly from CTEP.  Agents may be ordered by a participating site only after the initial 
IRB approval for the site has been forwarded by [CONTACT_36477] 
([EMAIL_617]) except for Group studies.
4.[ADDRESS_1059792] register an eligible candidate with NCI Central Registration Office (CRO) 
within [ADDRESS_1059793] from the web site 
(http://home.ccr.cancer.gov/intra/eligibility/welcome.htm) must be completed and sent via 
encrypted email to:  NCI Central Registration Office [EMAIL_978]. 
After confirmation of eligibility at Central Registration Office, CRO staff will call pharmacy to 
advise them of the acceptance of the patient on the protocol prior to the release of any 
investigational agents.  Verification of Registration will be forwarded electronically via e-mail to 
the research team. A recorder is available during non-working hours. 
4.2.[ADDRESS_1059794] be sent to the CCR study coordinator. The 
CCR study coordinator will notify you either by e-mail or fax that the protocol registration form 
has been received which will include the unique patient/subject ID number. Questions about 
eligibility should be directed to the CCR study coordinator or PI.  Questions related to 
registration should be directed to the CCR study coordinator. 
Subjects that do not meet screening criteria should be removed from the study following the 
procedure in section 5.8.3.
4.3 RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES
There are two arms to this study and subjects will be randomized equally to either the TICE 
BCG arm or the combination arm of TICE BCG + PANVAC™.  The study arms are described in 
detail below in Section 5.1.  The arms will be stratified during randomization for TICE BCG

18subgroup based on number of previous induction courses and time of recurrence.  This is 
described in more detail along with the statistical analysis in the statistical section (Section 14).
5 TREATMENT PLAN
5.1 STUDY DESIGN 
This is a phase II study in subjects with non-muscle invasive (stages Ta, T1, and/or CIS) high 
grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder who have failed at least one course of intravesical 
BCG.  The study will be halted for [ADDRESS_1059795] six patients with combination therapy 
are accrued and successfully treated.  If any Grade 3 or greater toxicities are observed that do not 
resolve with conservative management, then they will be discussed with CTEP.  With 
preliminary evidence of safety, the remaining subjects will be accrued to the trial. (See 
SCHEMA)
5.1.1 All subjects will receive BCG (TICE strain, 50 mg) intravesically as per usual standard of 
care once weekly (+/- 2 days) starting in week 3 for a total of 6 weeks (last dose in week 
8).
5.1.2 Subjects in the combination arm will receive the pox viral vaccines that contain the 
transgenes for CEA and MUC-1 (both with modified HLA-A2 agonist epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]) as well 
as 3 human T-cell costimulatory molecules, B7-1, ICAM-1, and LFA-3 [rV-PANVAC™ 
(vaccinia) and rF-PANVAC™ (fowlpox)] as follows:
[IP_ADDRESS] rV-PANVAC™ 2 x 108 pfu SQ at week 0 (+/- 7 days) only.
[IP_ADDRESS] rF-PANVAC™ 1 x 109 pfu SQ at weeks (+/- 7 days) 3, 7, 11, and 15.
5.1.3 All subjects will provide blood, urine, and tissue (if available) at study entry and at the 
end of the study.  Tissue at study entry can be obtained either from outside FFPE or from 
previous TURBT performed at NIH (see section [IP_ADDRESS]).  This tissue is required for 
diagnosis.  All subjects will also have blood drawn at weeks [ADDRESS_1059796] instillation of BCG as defined in Section 10.1.2.
5.1.4 All subjects will undergo tuberculin skin testing using purified protein derivative ([COMPANY_003]) 
at study entry (prior to receiving BCG instillation #1) and around the time of the week 
17-20 cystoscopy/EUA.  The associated skin reaction will be evaluated by a health care 
provider within 48-72 hours after injection.  Skin induration greater than 10mm in 
diameter will be considered a positive result.  Initial [COMPANY_003] results do NOT preclude 
subsequent treatment with BCG – these results will only be used to assess the 
immunologic response to BCG (see section 10.1.1).   
5.1.5 Between weeks 17-20 (+/- 7 days), a CT urogram and chest x-ray for re-staging purposes 
prior to biopsy, a planned cystoscopy, exam under anesthesia, and biopsy of the previous 
tumor area and/or any new areas of tumor to evaluate for the presence/recurrence of 
disease.

of the bladder with cystoscopy and cytology.  If recurrence is noted, it will be treated and 
if confirmed to be a recurrence on pathology, the patient will come off study.  
Surveillance and/or treatment for recurrences beyond the initial [ADDRESS_1059798] a 3 week delay from the time a previous 
bladder biopsy/TURBT to allow for adequate bladder healing prior to enrollment.  
[IP_ADDRESS] 6 green top tubes of blood will be drawn for PBMCs, HLA Typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and sera for 
correlative/exploratory research aims (e.g. ELISPOT, CD4+ Antigen-specific 
responses, etc.) on day 1 of study enrollment
[IP_ADDRESS] Beta-HCG for women of child-bearing age (within 72 hours prior to day 1).  In 
addition, patients, both male and female, should be willing to practice effective birth 
control during the study and four months following the last study treatment, unless they 
have had a prior hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or vasectomy.
5.2.2 TICE BCG arm:
[IP_ADDRESS] Weeks 3-8:  Receive weekly (+/- 2 days) intravesical doses of BCG (TICE strain, 50 
mg) as per usual standard of care for a total of [ADDRESS_1059799] infection will result in holding that week’s BCG dose and postponing 
therapy until the following week.  Also, at the beginning of each administration, 
patients will be queried about urinary symptoms.
•Complaints of persistent dysuria, urgency, bladder spasms, and/or frequency from 
previous week’s administration that is consistent with Grade 3 or greater toxicity 
will result in holding BCG administration for that week, supportive care (e.g. 
medications and hydration), and/or BCG dose reduction the following week at 1/3 
normal dose as this can result in less toxicity with similar results for recurrence 
and progression.31  
•Patients will be maintained at this reduced dose if they tolerate therapy.
•Future inability to tolerate this reduced dose will result in holding BCG for that 
week and postponing the BCG until the following week and droppi[INVESTIGATOR_86286] 1/6 of the 
normal dose as this dose may still be effective in prolonging progression-free and 
cancer-specific survival times.32  
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/2025
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood and urine will be obtained for correlative studies as described in Section 10.1.
[IP_ADDRESS] Between weeks 17-20 (+/- 7 days), a CT urogram and chest x-ray prior to biopsy, a 
planned cystoscopy, EUA, and TURBT will be done of previous tumor area and of any 
new areas of tumor.  Tissue will be sent for pathology and be formalin-fixed paraffin 
embedded.  If possible, some tissue will also be frozen. 
•If a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_771914], it will be biopsied.  If recurrent tumor is not 
found, then the subject will return every [ADDRESS_1059800]-of-care. If recurrent tumor is found, the patient has met the primary 
endpoint of recurrence and will be taken off study.
[IP_ADDRESS] At every surveillance cystoscopy post-treatment up to 12 months, urine may be 
collected for cytology as well as for immune-related markers along with blood through 
6 green top tubes for correlative immunologic aims. 
5.2.3 TICE BCG + PANVAC™ ARM
[IP_ADDRESS] Enroll into study with baseline evaluation and studies as described in Section 3.4.  Of 
note, there will be at least a 3 week delay from the time a previous bladder 
biopsy/TURBT to allow for adequate bladder healing prior to enrollment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Week 0 (+/- 7 days) – all subjects in this arm receive single vaccinia priming vaccine - 
rV-PANVAC™ 2 x 108 pfu SQ after undergoing phlebotomy with 6 green top tubes for 
immunologic correlates.
[IP_ADDRESS] Weeks 3-8:  Receive weekly (+/- 2 days) intravesical doses of BCG (TICE strain, 50 
mg) as per usual standard of care for a total of [ADDRESS_1059801] infection will result in holding that week’s BCG dose and postponing 
therapy until the following week.  Also, at the beginning of each administration, 
patients will be queried about urinary symptoms.
•Complaints of persistent dysuria, urgency, bladder spasms, and/or frequency from 
previous week’s administration that is consistent with Grade 3 or greater toxicity 
will result in holding BCG administration for that week, supportive care (e.g. 
medications and hydration), and/or BCG dose reduction (BCG can be given 1/3rd 
of the normal dose on the following week as this can result in less toxicity with 
similar results for recurrence and progression31). 
•Subjects will be maintained at this reduced dose if they tolerate therapy.
•Future inability to tolerate this reduced dose will result in holding BCG for that 
week and postponing the BCG until the following week and droppi[INVESTIGATOR_86286] 1/6 of the 
normal dose as this dose may still be effective in prolonging progression-free and 
cancer-specific survival times.32
[IP_ADDRESS] PANVAC administration will continue as planned regardless of any delays in BCG 
administration.  Research sample collection of urine will coincide with the first and 
third week of BCG instillation regardless of any delays with BCG administration.  
Research sample collection of blood will coincide with the first and sixth week of BCG 
instillation regardless of any delays with BCG administration.  [For example, if BCG is 
first given on week 3 of the study, but held on week 4 and resumed on week 5, then

collected on weeks 0, 3, 9 (previously week 8), 18-21 (previously 17-20), and 
optionally on follow-up visits.  The timing of PANVAC administration will NOT 
change in this scenario.]  Week (+/- 7 days) 3, 7, 11, and 15 – all patients in this arm

[IP_ADDRESS] Blood and urine will be obtained for correlative studies as described in Section 10.1. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Between weeks 17-20 (+/- 7 days), a CT urogram and chest x-ray prior to biopsy, a 
planned cystoscopy, EUA, and TURBT will be done of previous tumor area and of any 
new areas of tumor.  Tissue will be sent for pathology and be formalin-fixed paraffin 
embedded.  If possible, some tissue will also be frozen. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Also at the time of the end-of-study cystoscopy, urine will be collected for cytology and 
for immune-related markers along with blood for correlative aims.
5.3 AGENT ADMINISTRATION
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  Reported adverse events and potential 
risks are described in Section 7.  Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6.  No 
investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_110634]'s malignancy.
CTEP IND Agents:
rV-PANVAC™ (vaccinia priming vaccine)
rF-PANVAC™ (fowlpox boosting vaccine)
Other Agents:
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) – TICE strain 
The administration of the agents is described below based on the treatment arms:
5.3.1 TICE BCG alone arm:
Weeks 3-8
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) – TICE strain
•Attenuated live strain of Mycobacterium bovis
•Induction course of 6 weekly (+/- 2 days) instillations
•Instillation volume (50 mg in 50 mL sterile saline).
•Dose – 50 mg vial (TICE) is reconstituted in accompanying diluent and then further 
diluted in sterile, preservative-free saline according to manufacturer guidelines
•Each week, RNs will sterilely insert a urethral catheter atraumatically into the 
subject’s bladder and administer the reconstituted BCG.  Following instillation of the 
50 mL of BCG, the urethral catheter will be removed.
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/2025
22•BCG will then be held in the bladder for 1-2 hours depending on patient ability to 
hold the medication in the bladder.  The patient will then void in a toilet and rinse the 
toilet with bleach prior to flushing.
• All equipment in contact [CONTACT_771960] a MPW container.
5.3.2 TICE BCG + PANVAC™ arm:
Week 0 
rV-PANVAC™ (vaccinia priming vaccine) 2 x 108 pfu subcutaneously (+/- 7 days).
Week 3 
BCG (+/- 2 days see details above).
rF-PANVAC™ (fowlpox boosting vaccine) 1 x 109 pfu subcutaneously (+/- 7 days).
Weeks 4-6
BCG (+/- 2 days see details above).
Week 7 
BCG (+/- 2 days see details above).
rF-PANVAC™ (fowlpox boosting vaccine) 1 x 109 pfu subcutaneously (+/- 7 days).
Week 8
BCG (+/- 2 days see details above).
Week 11 
rF-PANVAC™ (fowlpox boosting vaccine) 1 x 109 pfu subcutaneously (+/- 7 days).
Week 15 
rF-PANVAC™ (fowlpox boosting vaccine) 1 x 109 pfu subcutaneously (+/- 7 days).
5.3.3 Precautions for the vaccines
• Prior to administration of the drugs, safe-handling precautions should 
be thoroughly reviewed (see Section 9, precautions and special handling subsections of 
“Pharmaceutical Information”).
• The proper procedure for disposing the live vaccine is a critical part of 
drug administration (see Section 9, disposal sections of “Pharmaceutical Information”).
5.[ADDRESS_1059802].  A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will 
be any grade [ADDRESS_1059803] (AE) by [CONTACT_3989] v5.[ADDRESS_1059804] of care.  In 
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/2025
23addition, any grade 3 or greater AE as per a previously published vaccinia toxicity grading 
scale33 related to the investigational agent will also be considered a DLT.  
Intravesical BCG therapy can lead to common side effects that are usually self-limited, 
particularly with dose reduction.  These side effects include, but are not limited to, gross 
hematuria, dysuria, frequency, urgency, bladder spasms, and generalized cystitis.  These side 
effects will not be considered a DLT if it is related to BCG and resolves with BCG dose 
reduction and/or postponing therapy by 1-[ADDRESS_1059805], persistent side effects despi[INVESTIGATOR_16574]/postponing of BCG 
therapy or the development of systemic BCG infection (aka “BCG-osis”) will be considered a 
DLT.  
Severe adverse events due to local instillation of BCG are uncommon. In a retrospective analysis 
of [ADDRESS_1059806] common complication was fever >103ºF in 2.9 percent followed in 
decreasing frequency by:
•Significant hematuria (1 percent)
•Granulomatous prostatitis (0.9 percent)
•Pneumonitis and/or hepatitis (0.7 percent)
•Arthralgia (0.5 percent)
•Epi[INVESTIGATOR_95541] (0.4 percent)
•Sepsis (0.4 percent)
•Rash (0.3 percent)
•Ureteral obstruction (0.3 percent)
•Contracted bladder (0.2 percent)
•Renal abscess (0.1 percent)
•Cytopenia (0.1 percent)
Systemic sepsis and even death can also develop early following local instillation of BCG. 
During the initial clinical experience with BCG as an intravesical agent, most cases of sepsis 
could be traced back to recognized errors in BCG administration such as traumatic 
catheterization, administration too early after transurethral surgery, or instillation during a 
concomitant UTI. All these conditions result in physical disruptions in the urothelial blood 
barrier.  Sepsis has been estimated to occur in approximately one in every 15,[ADDRESS_1059807] experiences a grade 5 event, thought to be possibly or probably due to the 
combination therapy (PANVAC + BCG), the study will be stopped. For grade 3 or 4

Version Date: 05/22/2025
24events probably related to the investigational agent (PANVAC) and persisting for more 
than one week and not improving by [CONTACT_771961], the study will be stopped 
according to the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_305089] 14.
[IP_ADDRESS] The exceptions to what constitute true adverse events/DLTs are previously noted.  
5.4.3 Formal dose escalation/Phase I study is not planned as the TICE BCG doses are 
consistent with standard of care and the TICE BCG is being administered in an 
intravesical fashion while the PANVAC™ is given subcutaneously and in doses that have 
been shown to be safe in multiple Phase I and Phase II studies in a variety of different 
cancers.  
5.[ADDRESS_1059808] complete 
that course of therapy and be free of evidence of further infection before receiving any dose of 
vaccine.  To avoid blunting of the immune response, we will avoid administering corticosteroids 
or other immunosuppressive agents unless medically indicated. 
Symptomatic anemia should be treated with appropriate red blood cell or erythropoietin support.
Thrombocytopenia should be treated conservatively. In the absence of bleeding or a planned 
invasive procedure, platelet transfusions should be given for a platelet count below 10,000/mm3. 
If invasive procedures are planned or the subject develops bleeding, platelet transfusions should 
be administered in accordance with the standard of practice, usually maintaining a platelet count 
of >50,000/mm3.
5.5.1 Treatment of Vaccinia Vaccination Complications
[IP_ADDRESS] Vaccinia Immune Globulin (VIG) 
Vaccinia Immune Globulin (VIG):  First-line treatment of some of the complications of 
vaccinia caused by [CONTACT_195275] (severe cases of inadvertent inoculation 
involving extensive lesions or if comorbid conditions exist, severe cases of generalized vaccinia 
in patients that are systemically ill and whose condition might be toxic or who have serious 
underlying immunosuppressive illnesses, eczema vaccinatum, and progressive vaccinia) is with 
VIG.  VIG is contraindicated, however, for the treatment of isolated vaccinial keratitis.  VIG is a 
sterile solution of the immunoglobulin fraction of pooled plasma from individuals inoculated 
with vaccinia vaccine.  VIG is only available through the CDC’s Strategic National 
Pharmaceutical Stockpi[INVESTIGATOR_469600]’s Clinician Information Line at 1-877-554-
4625 or the Director's Emergency Operations Center (DEOC) at [PHONE_4239].  Upon receipt of 
a call from a patient or upon direct observation of a patient or contact [CONTACT_605387], the investigator should place a call to the CDC as soon 
as possible: 1) to initiate review of the clinical case, 2) to seek consultation on the 
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/2025
25appropriateness of VIG therapy, 3) to determine the appropriate VIG dose and dosing method for 
administration, if VIG therapy is required, and 4) to determine how to access and have the 
appropriate doses of VIG delivered.  Early institution of VIG therapy is advised following 
recognition of clinical symptoms compatible with some vaccinia complications (eczema 
vaccinatum, severe generalized vaccinia, progressive vaccinia, and some cases of inadvertent 
inoculation).  The effectiveness of VIG therapy appears to be time dependent. VIG has not 
proven to be of benefit in the treatment of post-vaccinial encephalitis, and is contraindicated for 
treatment of isolated vaccinial keratitis due to the increased risk of corneal scarring.  A new IV 
formulation of VIG that has a lower level of aggregated protein allowing it to be used by [CONTACT_771962].  This formulation will most likely be preferred 
for administration and the CDC will instruct investigators regarding appropriate dosing and 
method of administration based on the formulation and availability.  There is no guarantee that 
VIG will successfully treat complications.  At present, there are no other anti-viral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_771915]-related complications.
[IP_ADDRESS] Cidofovir (Vistide®, [COMPANY_009] Sciences)
Cidofovir (Vistide®, [COMPANY_009] Sciences):  Cidofovir is an FDA-approved antiviral drug for the 
treatment of CMV retinitis among patients with AIDS. Cell-based in vitro studies and animal 
model studies have demonstrated this agent’s antiviral activity against certain orthopoxviruses.  
Currently, its efficacy in the treatment of vaccinia-related complications in humans is unknown.  
According to the CDC, VIG is recommended as first line of therapy.  Cidofovir may be 
considered as a secondary treatment, and will only be used when VIG therapy is not effective 
[Medical Management of Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine Adverse Reactions: Vaccinia Immune 
Globulin and Cidofovir. Last updated September 28, 2009.  Available at:  
http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/mgmt-adv-reactions.asp].  The CDC has 
informed the NCI/CTEP that cidofovir will not be supplied through Strategic National 
Pharmaceutical Stockpi[INVESTIGATOR_719262]-sponsored protocols utilizing 
recombinant vaccinia-based vaccines.  Thus, investigators should obtain cidofovir for second-
line therapy through commercial sources if necessary.  Investigators should consult the CDC 
Clinician Information Line at [PHONE_4230] or the Director's Emergency Operations Center 
(DEOC) at [PHONE_4239] regarding appropriateness of therapy and guidance.

6 DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS
6.1 TICE BCG
The need for BCG dose modification may arise and has been described previously.  To review, 
subjects will receive weekly (+/- 2 days) intravesical doses of BCG (TICE strain, 50 mg) as per 
usual standard of care for a total of [ADDRESS_1059812] infection by [CONTACT_771964]’s BCG dose and postponing therapy until the following week.  Also, 
at the beginning of each administration, subjects will be queried about urinary symptoms.  
Complaints of persistent dysuria, urgency, bladder spasms, and/or frequency from previous 
week’s administration that is consistent with Grade 3 or greater toxicity will result in holding 
BCG administration for that week, supportive care (e.g. medications and hydration), and/or BCG 
dose reduction the following week at 1/3 normal dose as this can result in less toxicity with 
similar results for recurrence and progression.31 Complaints of non-infective cystitis or hematuria 
consistent with Grade 2 or higher will result in holding BCG administration for that week.  
Therapy will resume the following week at if these symptoms are at less than or equal to Grade 
1.  Subjects will be maintained at this reduced dose if they continue to fail to tolerate full dose 
therapy.
Future inability to tolerate this reduced dose will result in holding BCG for that week and 
postponing the BCG until the following week and droppi[INVESTIGATOR_86286] 1/6 of the normal dose (details in 
Section 5.2).  Of note, weekly BCG postponement or dose reductions will not alter the 
vaccination schedule.  For example, if the week [ADDRESS_1059813] will still 
receive the next dose of PANVAC™-F on week 7, but the last dose of BCG would be given on 
week 9 instead of week 8 (assuming that no other BCG postponement is necessary).

constitutional symptoms (that are not related to the BCG or medications related 
to BCG treatments) in order to receive a subsequent vaccination.  These 
constitutional symptoms are listed in Section [IP_ADDRESS].

Version Date: 05/22/2025
28•Subjects with ≤  grade 2 toxicity not related to vaccine treatment (i.e. attributed to 
BCG) will remain eligible to receive vaccine.  
•Subjects that recover from grade 3 toxicity unrelated to vaccine treatment (i.e. 
related to BCG) will remain eligible for the vaccine.  However, subjects that 
experience a grade 4 toxicity unrelated to vaccine treatment (i.e. attributed to 
BCG) will not remain eligible for further vaccine administration.  
•If BCG is permanently discontinued, the patient will remain eligible for further 
vaccine administration in the absence of a grade 4 toxicity.        
•  Vaccination will be held for > grade 2 proteinuria measured initially by a urine 
dipstick but confirmed by a 24 hour urine collection.
•If  ≥grade  2 nonautoimmune toxicity attributable to the vaccine persists for > [ADDRESS_1059814] will not receive further vaccine inoculations and will be 
removed from the protocol treatment and followed for resolution of toxicity and 
immune endpoints.  
•Subjects who develop grade [ADDRESS_1059815] their vaccine held 
until injection site reaction resolves to grade 2 or less.
•Subjects who develop ≥ a grade 2 allergic or autoimmune disease that threatens 
vital organ function or any ≥  grade 3 autoimmunity, not related to a therapeutic 
response, will be removed from the protocol treatment and followed for 
resolution of toxicity and immune endpoints.  Follow-up will be performed 
during each vaccination and blood draw interval for immunologic testing as 
described in Section 11
•Subjects who develop any grade 4 toxicity attributable to the study drug(s) will be 
removed from the protocol treatment and followed for resolution of toxicity and 
immune endpoints.
•If a scheduled vaccine dose is missed due to scheduling or logistical issues, the 
vaccine may be given within 7 days of the appointed time (which resets the 
appointed date for further vaccinations) or be considered a missed dose.  If the 
subject has a delay in vaccination not due to toxicity during the core phase, the 
vaccine may be delayed for up to [ADDRESS_1059816] from 
study.  BCG administration will not be affected by [CONTACT_771965]/delayed vaccine 
administrations.

Study closed with CTEP as of 5/1/2019. No further reporting is required.
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/2025
32Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs (Section 8.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 8.2) will 
determine whether the event requires expedited reporting (via CTEP-AERS) in addition to 
routine reporting.
8.[ADDRESS_1059819](S) (CAEPR S)
The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764].  In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset of AEs, 
the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column 
and is identified with bold and italicized text.  The SPEER is a list of events that are protocol-
specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI via CTEP-AERS (except as noted below).  
Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm for 
further clarification. 
NOTE:  The highest grade currently reported is noted in parentheses next to the AE in the 
SPEER.  Report ONLY AEs higher than this grade expeditiously via CTEP-AERS.  If this 
CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE 
listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is 
required.
8.1.1 CAEPRs for CTEP IND Agents
For protocols with CAEPRs not including a “SPEER” category, protocol-specific exceptions to 
the CTEP-AERS reporting table can be found in the CAEPR’s “ASAEL” category instead.  This 
protocol-specific exception is limited to Grade 1 and Grade 2 ASAEL events, i.e. Grade 3 
through Grade 5 ASAEL-listed events are NOT exceptions to CTEP-AERS reporting.

Notes:  
1. PANVAC-V [Recombinant Vaccinia-CEA(D609)/MUC1(L93)/TRICOM] and 
PANVAC-F [Recombinant Fowlpox-CEA(D609)/MUC1(L93)/TRICOM] when used in 
combination with other agents, either commercial or investigational, could be associated 
with changes in the frequency or severity of known events or the emergence of new 
patterns of events. 
2. Other potential risks or complications associated with the use of the vaccinia vaccine 
strain from which the attenuated recombinant vector is derived, include those observed 
during the smallpox vaccination programs:
•Inadvertent inoculation (autoinoculation and direct contact [CONTACT_195269])
•Non-specific erythematous or urticarial rashes (generally self-limiting) and rarely, 
more serious bullous erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
•Generalized vaccinia (disseminated maculopapular or vesicular rash of varying 
extent on any part of the body)
•Eczema vaccinatum (vaccinial lesion development on areas of the skin that are, or 
had at one time been, eczematous)
•Progressive vaccinia (local vaccination lesion fails to heal and develops 
progressive necrosis, with destruction of large areas of skin, subcutaneous tissue, 
and underlying structures. Progressive lesions may spread to other skin surfaces 
and to bone and viscera)
•Post-vaccinial encephalitis/encephalomyelitis
•Fetal vaccinia
•Myocarditis/pericarditis
3. The inclusion of co-stimulatory molecules in these agents may theoretically stimulate 
autoimmunity or exacerbate existing disease in susceptible individuals.
4. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) occurred with closely related agents, 
PROSTVAC-V/TRICOM [Recombinant Vaccinia-PSA(L155)/TRICOM] and 
PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM [Recombinant Fowlpox-PSA(L155)/TRICOM].

[IP_ADDRESS] TICE Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
(See package insert for complete list of side effects)
Symptoms of bladder irritability, related to the inflammatory response induced, are reported in 
approximately 60% of patients receiving TICE® BCG. The symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_176711] 4–[ADDRESS_1059821] 24–[ADDRESS_1059822] 
consistent with an immunological mechanism. There is no evidence that dose reduction or 
antituberculous drug therapy can prevent or lessen the irritative toxicity of TICE® BCG. “Flu-
like” symptoms (malaise, fever, and chills) which may accompany the localized, irritative 
toxicities often reflect hypersensitivity reactions which can be treated symptomatically. 
Antihistamines have also been used. Adverse reactions to TICE® BCG tend to be progressive in 
frequency and severity with subsequent instillation. Delay or postponement of subsequent 
treatment may or may not reduce the severity of a reaction during subsequent instillation. 
Although uncommon, serious infectious complications of intravesical BCG have been reported. 
The most serious infectious complication of BCG is disseminated sepsis with associated 
mortality. In addition, M. bovis infections have been reported in lung, liver, bone, bone marrow, 
kidney, regional lymph nodes, and prostate in patients who have received intravesical BCG. 
Some male genitourinary tract infections (orchitis/epi[INVESTIGATOR_95541]) have been resistant to multiple 
drug antituberculous therapy and required orchiectomy. If a patient develops persistent fever 
or experiences an acute febrile illness consistent with BCG infection, BCG treatment 
should be discontinued and the patient immediately evaluated and treated for systemic 
infection. The local and systemic adverse reactions reported in a review of 674 patients with 
superficial bladder cancer, including 153 patients with carcinoma in situ, are summarized.

8.3 EXPEDITED A DVERSE EVENT REPORTING TO CTEP 
Study Closed with CTEP on 5/1/2019.  No further reporting is required
8.3.[ADDRESS_1059827] use CTEP-AERS (CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP Web site (http://ctep.cancer.gov).  The 
reporting procedures to be followed are presented in the “NCI Guidelines for 
Investigators: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements for DCTD (CTEP and CIP) and 
DCP INDs and IDEs” which can be downloaded from the CTEP Web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov).  These requirements are briefly outlined in the tables below 
(Section 8.3.3).
In the rare occurrence when Internet connectivity is lost, a 24-hour notification is to be 
made to CTEP by [CONTACT_1381] [PHONE_101].  Once Internet connectivity is restored, the 
24-hour notification phoned in must be entered electronically into CTEP-AERS by [CONTACT_25521].
CTEP-AERS is programmed for automatic electronic distribution of reports to the 
following individuals:  Study Coordinator of the Lead Organization, Principal 
Investigator, and the local treating physician.  CTEP-AERS provides a copy feature for 
other e-mail recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. 
8.3.2 Expedited Reporting Guidelines
Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol-specific patient ID assigned during trial 
registration on all reports.
Note:  A death on study requires both routine and expedited reporting regardless of 
causality.  Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided.
Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease progression” 
in the system organ class (SOC) “General disorders and administration site conditions.”.  
Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., radiological 
changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a 
disease process) should be submitted. 
Pregnancy loss
•Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as “Death in utero.”
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/2025
40•Any Pregnancy loss should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “Pregnancy 
loss” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC.
•A Pregnancy loss should NOT be reported as a Grade 5 event under the 
Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC, as currently CTEPAERS 
recognizes this event as a patient death.
A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4, “Death neonatal” under 
the General disorders and administration SOC.

8.5 SECONDARY MALIGNANCY
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm. 
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/2025
43CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP-AERS. Three options are available to describe the event: 
•Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML]) 
•Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
•Treatment-related secondary malignancy 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol. 
8.6 SECOND M ALIGNANCY
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting 
via CDUS unless otherwise specified.

commercial agents administered in this study can be found in Section 8.1.
9.1 CTEP IND  AGENTS
9.1.1 PANVAC-V (NSC 727026)
Other Names: Recombinant-Vaccinia-CEA(D609)/MUC-1(L93)/TRICOM 
Classification:  Recombinant vaccinia virus vector vaccine of the genus Orthopoxvirus.
Description: PANVAC-V is a recombinant vaccinia virus vector vaccine containing genes for 
human CEA, MUC-1 and three co-stimulatory molecules (designated TRICOM ): B7.1, ICAM-1 
(intercellular adhesion molecule-1), and LFA-3 (leukocyte function-associated antigen-3). The CEA 
gene coding sequence is modified to code for a single amino acid substitution (aspartic acid, instead 
of asparagine at amino acid position 609) in one 9-mer, HLA-A2-restricted, immunodominant 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_719288]. The MUC-1 gene coding sequence is also modified 
to code for a single amino substitution (leucine, instead of threonine at amino acid position 93) in 
one 10-mer, HLA-A2-restricted, immunodominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_719288]. 
TBC-vTRICOM, is used as the parental virus for this recombinant vaccine, and is generated by 
[CONTACT_771968]-stimulatory molecules into an attenuated, live, derivative of 
the Wyeth ([LOCATION_001] City Board of Health) strain of vaccinia virus. A plasmid vector containing 
the modified CEA and MUC-[ADDRESS_1059833] primary chicken embryo dermal (CED) 
cells infected with the parental vaccinia virus to generate the recombinant vaccinia virus. The final 
PANVAC-V recombinant vaccine is generated by [CONTACT_771969].  Vaccinia virus can infect mammalian cells and express the inserted 
transgenes, and is a potent immune stimulator, eliciting both a strong humoral and cellular immune

Precautions for Healthcare Workers 
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/[ADDRESS_1059837] been 
published. If appropriate infection control precautions are observed (such as covering the 
vaccination site and washing hands after contact [CONTACT_195262]), 
healthcare workers are probably at less risk of infection than laboratory workers because of the 
smaller volume and lower titers of virus in clinical specimens as compared with laboratory 
material. However, because of the potential risk for transmission, healthcare personnel who 
prepare or administer doses of recombinant vaccinia vaccine or have direct contact [CONTACT_251714]. Do not administer routine, non-emergency vaccination with the 
licensed vaccinia vaccine to healthcare workers, if they, or for at least three weeks after 
vaccination, their close household contacts (close household contacts are those who share 
housing or have close physical contact): 
•have active eczema or a history of eczema or atopic dermatitis, or Darier’s disease.
•have other acute, chronic, or exfoliative skin conditions (e.g., burns, impetigo, varicella 
zoster, severe acne, or other open rashes or wounds), until the condition resolves.
•are pregnant or intend to become pregnant within [ADDRESS_1059838]-feeding.
•are immunodeficient or immunocompromised (by [CONTACT_195261]), including HIV 
infection.
Additionally, do not administer routine, non-emergency vaccination with the licensed vaccinia 
vaccine to healthcare workers if the vaccinee:  
•has a moderate or severe acute illness, until the illness resolves.
•is less than 18 years of age, unless specifically indicated.
•is undergoing topi[INVESTIGATOR_251687]; potential immune suppression increases risk for vaccinia-related 
complications. 
•has a history of allergy or serious reaction to prior vaccinia vaccination or any of the 
vaccine’s components.
•As a precaution, the CDC recommends that individuals with known cardiac disease (e.g., 
previous MI, angina, CHF, cardiomyopathy, stroke or TIA) or who have > 3 known risk 
factors for cardiac disease (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, first degree 
relative with onset of cardiac complications prior to age 50, smoker), not receive routine, 
non-emergency, prophylactic vaccination with the licensed vaccinia vaccine while a possible 
causal relationship between vaccination and cardiac events is being evaluated.
Avoid exposure to the recombinant vaccinia vaccine, any contaminated dressings, or other 
infectious materials from patients, or the patient’s inoculation site if you are pregnant or breast-
feeding; have a history or presence of active eczema or atopic dermatitis; have acute, chronic or 
exfoliative skin conditions; or, are immunocompromised. More information on vaccinia

Recombinant Vaccinia Vaccine Patient Care Implications, Contraindications and Potential 
Complications  
Patient Care Implications and Contraindications
Cover vaccination sites with a sterile dry dressing ( e.g., Telfa pad). Instruct patients on proper hand-
hygiene, sterile dressing care, bathing, laundering of clothing, etc. Treat patient bandages or 
dressings removed from the vaccination site as infectious waste and dispose in appropriate 
biohazard containers. Do not administer the recombinant vaccinia vaccine if the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], or for at 
least three weeks after vaccination, their close household contacts (close household contacts are 
those who share housing or have close physical contact): 
•have active eczema or a history of eczema or atopic dermatitis, or Darier’s disease.
•have other acute, chronic, or exfoliative skin conditions ( e.g., burns, impetigo, varicella zoster, 
severe acne, contact [CONTACT_8748], psoriasis, herpes or other open rashes or wounds), until the 
condition resolves.
•are pregnant or intend to become pregnant (due to the potential risk of fetal vaccinia); or are 
breast-feeding (due to the potential risk of contact [CONTACT_195265]). 
It is currently unknown if vaccinia virus or antibodies are excreted in breast milk.  Because 
there is no safety data available, patients (i.e., vaccinees) should avoid becoming pregnant, 
fathering a child, or breast-feeding for at least 4 months following completion of therapy 
with the recombinant vaccine.
•are in close contact [CONTACT_195266] 3 years of age (due to the potential risk of contact 
[CONTACT_195265]). 
•are immunodeficient or immunocompromised (by [CONTACT_195261]), including individuals 
with HIV infection.
Additionally, do not administer the recombinant vaccinia vaccine if the vaccinee: 
•has a moderate or severe acute illness, until the illness resolves.
•is undergoing topi[INVESTIGATOR_195208], or undergoing therapy 
with systemic steroids; potential immune suppression increases risk for vaccinia-related 
complications.
•At this time, until a more definitive causal relationship is determined, it is recommended that 
patients with known CHF or clinically significant cardiomyopathy, not be vaccinated with 
recombinant vaccinia-based vaccines, due to the potential for development of myocarditis 
and/or pericarditis. 
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/[ADDRESS_1059840] medical practice.  
Due to the method of manufacturing (virus grown in primary chicken embryo dermal cells), do 
not administer the recombinant vaccinia vaccine to patients with a history of allergy to eggs or 
egg products. Do not administer the recombinant vaccinia vaccine to patients with a history of 
allergy or serious reaction to prior vaccinia vaccination (e.g., smallpox vaccination).
Potential Complications Associated With Recombinant Vaccinia Vaccination 
When vaccinia vaccine is administered by [CONTACT_251715], 
expected local reactions in individuals that have not previously been vaccinated with vaccinia 
include the appearance of a red papule in 3-[ADDRESS_1059841] for weeks following healing of 
the skin lesion, considerable local edema, and intense inflammation from the vaccination (i.e., 
viral cellulites), which may be confused with bacterial cellulites. Systemic symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_251688] 8-[ADDRESS_1059842] been a number of complications reported in the literature associated with vaccinia 
vaccination for smallpox. Reported complications from vaccinia vaccine when given by

auto-inoculation 606.[ADDRESS_1059843] often the result of postvaccinial encephalitis or progressive vaccinia.
Information has been reported by [CONTACT_154437] (DoD) during the post-
vaccination surveillance assessment of adverse events in military personnel following 
implementation of a smallpox vaccination program from the period of December 13, 2002 
through May 28, 2003. Although not directly comparable to historical numbers, due to 
differences in multiple population variables, estimated cases (number of cases per million 
vaccinations based on vaccination of 450,293 personnel, with a median age of 26 years and 
70.5% as primary vaccinees) of these same complications per million vaccinations were:
auto-inoculation [ADDRESS_1059844]-vaccinial 
encephalitis/encephalomyelitis. The complications of vaccinia vaccination may involve a number 
of different reactions:
1.Non-specific erythematous or urticarial rashes: These rashes can appear 
approximately 10 days after vaccination and may sometimes be confused with 
generalized vaccinia, but are generally self-limiting. Patients are usually afebrile and 
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/2025
51these benign rashes usually resolve spontaneously within 2-4 days. Erythema multiforme 
can present as different types of lesions, including macules, papules, urticaria, and bull’s 
eye lesions (dark papule or vesicle surrounded by a pale zone and an area of erythema). 
These lesions may be extremely pruritic, lasting up to four weeks. Rarely, more serious 
bullous erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) may occur, requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Vaccinia Immune Globulin (VIG) therapy is not indicated to treat these 
rashes. Supportive care measures are warranted since these rashes are likely 
manifestations of an immune response or hypersensitivity reaction to the vaccine and are 
not likely to contain vaccinia virus.
2.Bacterial Infection: Vaccination site infection, most likely due to staphylococcus and 
streptococcus normal skin flora, is rare. Onset is approximately [ADDRESS_1059845]-vaccination 
and is more common in children. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is required.
3.Inadvertent Inoculation: This can occur in the vaccinee (autoinoculation) as well as in 
close contacts (contact [CONTACT_195269]). Accidental infection is the most common 
complication of vaccinia vaccination, accounting for approximately 50% of all 
complications associated with vaccination and revaccination. This usually results from 
autoinoculation of vaccinia virus transferred from the site of the vaccination. Sites 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_251689], eyelids, nose, mouth, genitalia, or rectum, but can 
also involve the arms, legs, and trunk. Contact [CONTACT_195270], with 
accompanying toxicities, may occur when a recently vaccinated individual has contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a susceptible individual.  In a [ADDRESS_1059846] commonly was in children  [ADDRESS_1059847] transmission may result in a more severe syndrome than 
that seen in vaccinees, perhaps because of multiple simultaneous inoculations. About 
30% of eczema vaccinatum cases reported in the [ADDRESS_1059848] transmission would 
be greater in today’s population, due to a largely unvaccinated patient population against 
smallpox. Contact [CONTACT_251716]. Most cases of inadvertent inoculation usually resolve without specific therapy 
and resolution of lesions follow the same course as the vaccination site in 
immunocompetent individuals. VIG can be used for severe cases involving extensive 
lesions or if comorbid conditions exist. VIG is contraindicated in the presence of isolated 
keratitis due to the risk of increased corneal scarring. VIG use can be considered in cases 
of ocular implantation, with keratitis, if vision-threatening or if other life-threatening 
vaccinia-related complications exist that require VIG therapy.  
4.Generalized vaccinia: Generalized vaccinia is characterized by a disseminated 
maculopapular or vesicular rash of varying extent on any part of the body and typi[INVESTIGATOR_195211] 6-[ADDRESS_1059849] serious underlying 
immunosuppressive illnesses. The differential diagnosis of GV includes eczema 
vaccinatum, erthyema multiforme, inadvertent inoculation at multiple sites, and 
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/2025
52uncommonly, early stages of progressive vaccinia or other vesicular diseases (e.g., severe 
chickenpox or disseminated herpes). Several publications have investigated the reporting 
of GV among those individuals who received smallpox vaccinations during 2003.  Out of 
38,440 vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], 29 reports of possible GV during January 2003–December 
2003 were identified but only 2 reports met the case definition. More than 75% of the 
reports received a final diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction or nonspecific rash after 
review by [CONTACT_771970].  Of 74 cases investigated in 753,226 smallpox vaccinations 
administered in December 2002 to December 2004, 50 (67.6%) met the case definition of 
possible GV.  Cases occurred more frequently in primary vaccinees (rate, 81 per 1 
million vaccinees) than in those revaccinated (rate, 32 per 1 million vaccinees).  
However, none met the case definition of probable or confirmed GV, including 15 with 
virologically negative laboratory evaluations (e.g., culture, polymerase chain reaction, or 
skin biopsy).  Twenty-one reports of postscab lesions were made between January and 
August 2003 among 37,542 smallpox vaccinees.  The lesions (scab and/or fluid) of seven 
patients were tested for vaccinia virus by [CONTACT_251717]/or 
immunohistochemistry; all were found to be negative.  In addition, the postscab lesions 
of four of the patients were biopsied.  The results from two of the biopsies suggested an 
allergic contact [CONTACT_8748], and results of one each demonstrated chronic dermatitis and 
squamous cell carcinoma.  None of the four biopsied lesions had histologic evidence of 
viropathic changes and no evidence supported smallpox vaccination as a cause for any of 
the lesions.  
5.Eczema vaccinatum: Eczema vaccinatum is a serious complication in persons with 
eczema and other types of chronic or exfoliative skin conditions. It can also occur among 
eczematous contacts of recently vaccinated persons. Vaccinial lesions (generalized 
papular, vesicular or pustular lesions) develop on areas of the skin that are, or had at one 
time been, eczematous. These areas become highly inflamed and lesions may spread to 
healthy skin. The rash is often accompanied by [CONTACT_195274]. 
The fatality rate for untreated cases (prior to availability of VIG) has been reported from 
30-40%. Following availability of VIG, mortality was reduced to approximately 7%. 
Early diagnosis and prompt treatment with VIG is necessary to reduce mortality. 
6.Progressive vaccinia: Progressive vaccinia is the most serious cutaneous complication, 
occurring when the local vaccination lesion fails to heal and develops progressive 
necrosis, with destruction of large areas of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and underlying 
structures. Progressive lesions may spread to other skin surfaces and to bone and viscera.   
Progressive vaccinia is associated with a high mortality rate. This complication has been 
seen in patients with a compromised immune system due to a congenital deficiency, 
lymphoproliferative disease, immunosuppressive treatment, or HIV infection. 
Management should include aggressive VIG therapy.
7.Post-Vaccinial Encephalitis/Encephalomyelitis: Vaccinial complications affecting the 
CNS are unpredictable. Post-vaccinial encephalitis typi[INVESTIGATOR_195212] < 2 years of 
age and is characterized by [CONTACT_771971] 6-10 days following vaccination, which 
include seizures, hemiplegia, aphasia, and transient amnesia. Histopathological changes 
include generalized cerebral edema, mild lymphocytic meningeal infiltration, ganglion 
degenerative changes and perivascular hemorrhages. Older children and adults can 
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/[ADDRESS_1059850] ranged from 15-25%, with 25% of patients who recover being left with varying 
degrees and types of neurological deficits. VIG has not been shown to be effective in 
treating CNS disease and is not recommended. Post-vaccinial 
encephalitis/encephalomyelitis are diagnoses of exclusion and are not believed to be a 
result of replicating vaccinia virus.  Although no specific therapy exists, supportive care, 
anticonvulsants, and intensive care might be required. A review of vaccinia-related 
deaths (68) during a 9-year period (1959–1966 and 1968) revealed that among first-time 
vaccines, 36 (52%) patients died as a result of post-vaccinial encephalitis.    
8.Fetal Vaccinia: Fetal vaccinia is a rare, but serious complication following vaccinia 
vaccination during pregnancy or shortly before conception (e.g., within four weeks).  To 
date, fewer than [ADDRESS_1059851] been reported and often result in fetal or neonatal death. 
Efficacy of VIG therapy in a viable infant or used prophylactically in women during 
pregnancy is unknown. The CDC has established a National Smallpox Vaccine in 
Pregnancy Registry. This registry will follow women during their pregnancies and their 
babies, after they are born, to determine the outcome of such pregnancies. The CDC can 
be contact[CONTACT_6811] ([PHONE_4238].
9.Myocarditis/Pericarditis:  The CDC has recommended a temporary medical deferral to 
the voluntary Smallpox Vaccination Program for persons with heart disease or 
cardiovascular risk factors (March 25, 2003) and issued “interim supplementary 
information” regarding evidence that smallpox vaccination may cause myocarditis and/or 
pericarditis (March 31, 2003) in people recently vaccinated with the smallpox vaccine. 
The cardiac events reported include myocardial infarction, angina, myocarditis, 
pericarditis, and myopericarditis. Although the CDC believes that there is no evidence to 
conclude that the licensed vaccinia vaccine causes angina or heart attacks, it 
acknowledges a possible causal relationship between the vaccination and heart 
inflammation.  The CDC continues to study the relationship, but in the meantime, 
recommends that individuals with underlying heart disease be excluded from 
participation in the current Smallpox Vaccination Program. While it is currently not 
possible to fully evaluate the risk of cardiac events or the risk of myocarditis, pericarditis, 
or myopericarditis associated with vaccinia vaccination, it is reasonable to inform 
patients participating in studies using recombinant vaccinia virus of these reports and 
provide relevant guidance for evaluating these events. Further investigation from the 
ongoing vaccine program may provide additional data regarding an association or lack of 
association with cardiovascular disease. Patients are being immunized with recombinant 
vaccinia vaccines with therapeutic intent and will be evaluated for cardiovascular risk 
factors and recent or symptomatic cardiac events per protocol eligibility criteria. Patients 
will be encouraged to minimize cardiovascular disease risks and encouraged to follow 
risk reduction according to standard medical practice. At this time the evidence for an 
association with myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis seems plausible, but a rare

Health strain of vaccinia from December 2002 through December 2003, 67 developed 
symptomatic myopericarditis.  In the 61 ECGs that were reviewed, an identifiable 
abnormality was evident in 46 (75.4%).  The most common abnormalities included ST-
segment changes observed evident in 40 patients (65.6%); 5 patients (8.2%) had normal 
variant early repolarization, and T-wave abnormalities were noted in 11 patients (18.0%).  
In addition, cardiac enzymes were elevated in 60 of 61 (98.4%) patients evaluated with 
this assay.  On follow-up of 64 patients, all patients had objective normalization of 
electrocardiography, echocardiography, graded exercise testing, laboratory testing, and 
functional status; 8 (13%) reported atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], non-limiting persistent chest discomfort.  
Among 37,901 health care workers vaccinated with the identical strain, 21 
myo/pericarditis cases were identified; 18 (86%) were revacinees. Twelve met criteria for 
either myocarditis or myopericarditis, and 9 met criteria for pericarditis only (6 suspected 
and 3 probable).  The severity of myo/pericarditis was mild, with no fatalities, although 9 
patients (43%) were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].     
Treatment of Vaccinia Vaccination Complications
Vaccinia Immune Globulin (VIG):  First-line treatment of some of the complications of 
vaccinia caused by [CONTACT_195275] (severe cases of inadvertent inoculation 
involving extensive lesions or if comorbid conditions exist, severe cases of generalized vaccinia 
in patients that are systemically ill and whose condition might be toxic or who have serious 
underlying immunosuppressive illnesses, eczema vaccinatum, and progressive vaccinia) is with 
VIG.  VIG is contraindicated, however, for the treatment of isolated vaccinial keratitis.  VIG is a 
sterile solution of the immunoglobulin fraction of pooled plasma from individuals inoculated 
with vaccinia vaccine.  VIG is only available through the CDC’s Strategic National 
Pharmaceutical Stockpi[INVESTIGATOR_469600]’s Clinician Information Line at 1-877-554-
4625 or the Director's Emergency Operations Center (DEOC) at [PHONE_4239].  Upon receipt of 
a call from a patient or upon direct observation of a patient or contact [CONTACT_605387], the investigator should place a call to the CDC as soon 
as possible: 1) to initiate review of the clinical case, 2) to seek consultation on the 
appropriateness of VIG therapy, 3) to determine the appropriate VIG dose and dosing method for 
administration, if VIG therapy is required, and 4) to determine how to access and have the 
appropriate doses of VIG delivered.  Early institution of VIG therapy is advised following 
recognition of clinical symptoms compatible with some vaccinia complications (eczema 
vaccinatum, severe generalized vaccinia, progressive vaccinia, and some cases of inadvertent 
inoculation).  The effectiveness of VIG therapy appears to be time dependent. VIG has not 
proven to be of benefit in the treatment of post-vaccinial encephalitis, and is contraindicated for 
treatment of isolated vaccinial keratitis due to the increased risk of corneal scarring.  A new IV 
formulation of VIG that has a lower level of aggregated protein allowing it to be used by [CONTACT_771962].  This formulation will most likely be preferred 
for administration and the CDC will instruct investigators regarding appropriate dosing and 
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/2025
55method of administration based on the formulation and availability.  There is no guarantee that 
VIG will successfully treat complications.  At present, there are no other anti-viral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_771915]-related complications.
Cidofovir (Vistide®, [COMPANY_009] Sciences):  Cidofovir is an FDA-approved antiviral drug for the 
treatment of CMV retinitis among patients with AIDS. Cell-based in vitro studies and animal 
model studies have demonstrated this agent’s antiviral activity against certain orthopoxviruses.  
Currently, its efficacy in the treatment of vaccinia-related complications in humans is unknown.  
According to the CDC, VIG is recommended as first line of therapy.  Cidofovir may be 
considered as a secondary treatment, and will only be used when VIG therapy is not effective 
[Medical Management of Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine Adverse Reactions: Vaccinia Immune 
Globulin and Cidofovir. Last updated February 21, 2003.  Available at:  
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm ].  The CDC has informed the 
NCI/CTEP that cidofovir will not be supplied through Strategic National Pharmaceutical 
Stockpi[INVESTIGATOR_719262]-sponsored protocols utilizing recombinant vaccinia-
based vaccines.  Thus, investigators should obtain cidofovir for second-line therapy through 
commercial sources if necessary.  Investigators should consult the CDC Clinician Information 
Line at [PHONE_4230] or the Director's Emergency Operations Center (DEOC) at 770-488-
7100 regarding appropriateness of therapy and guidance.
9.1.2 PANVAC-F (NSC 727027)
Other Names: Recombinant-Fowlpox-CEA(D609)/MUC-1(L93)/TRICOM 
Classification:  Recombinant fowlpox virus vector vaccine of the genus Avipoxvirus.
Product Description:  PANVAC-F is a recombinant fowlpox virus vector vaccine containing 
genes for human CEA, MUC-1 and three co-stimulatory molecules (designated TRICOM ): 
B7.1, ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), and LFA-3 (leukocyte function-associated 
antigen-3).  The CEA gene coding sequence is modified to code for a single amino acid 
substitution (aspartic acid, instead of asparagine at amino acid position 609) in one 9-mer, HLA-
A2-restricted, immunodominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_719288]. The MUC-1 gene 
coding sequence is also modified to code for a single amino substitution (leucine, instead of 
threonine at amino acid position 93) in one 10-mer, HLA-A2-restricted, immunodominant 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_719288]. An attenuated, live, plaque-purified isolate from 
the POXVAC-TC strain of fowlpox virus was used as the parental virus for this recombinant 
vaccine. A plasmid vector containing the modified CEA and MUC-[ADDRESS_1059853] primary 
chicken embryo dermal (CED) cells infected with the parental virus to generate the recombinant 
fowlpox virus. The final PANVAC-F recombinant vaccine is manufactured by [CONTACT_771972]. Fowlpox virus can infect mammalian 
cells and express the inserted transgenes to stimulate both humoral and cellular immunity, but 
cannot replicate in non-avian species, making systemic infections unlikely.

Patient Care Implications 
Cover vaccination sites with a sterile dry dressing (e.g., Telfa pad). Once the injection site is 
healed, no further barrier is necessary. As a precaution, protect injection sites that are exhibiting 
evidence of weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], oozing or ulceration with a sterile dry dressing. In these circumstances, 
instruct patients to avoid direct contact [CONTACT_195260] (e.g.; 
those who may be immunocompromised by [CONTACT_195261]). Instruct patients to avoid 
becoming pregnant, breast feeding or fathering a child for at least 4 months following therapy 
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/[ADDRESS_1059857] 72 hours after vaccination or while there are any visible 
lesions at the injection site.
Due to the method of manufacturing (virus grown in primary chicken embryo dermal cells), 
patients with a history of allergy to eggs or egg products should not receive the vaccine.

10 BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES
10.1 LABORATORY CORRELATIVE S TUDIES
Please refer to Appendix E (Section 17.5) for more information.
10.1.1 Tuberculin Skin Testing 
[COMPANY_003] results will be used to assess the immunologic response to BCG therapy.  This premise is 
based on a previous report that correlates [COMPANY_003] positivity with improved tumor recurrence-free 
intervals after BCG treatment (Luftenegger et al, J Urol, Feb 1996, Vol 155, 1483-7).  
10.1.2 Urine 
For the BCG alone arm, urine may be collected at weeks 3, 5, and at the end of the study.  
For the BCG + PANVAC vaccine arm, urine may be collected at weeks 0, 3, 5, and at the end 
of the study.  
Collection volume will range from [ADDRESS_1059859] urine prior to BCG instillation and 2 hours after BCG drainage, based on previous 
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/2025
61study demonstrating urinary cytokine changes during these time points (Bisiaux et al, J Urol, Vol 
181, April 2009, 1571-80).
The aliquot will be stored in the Linehan’s laboratory at -80ºC for future proteomic and/or 
biomarker discovery studies depending on availability.  Studies have shown minimal degradation 
of urinary peptides upon thawing and analysis of specimens 36. Urinary levels of certain 
cytokines can be prognostic for response to bladder immunotherapy.  For example, large 
amounts of TRAIL are noted in the urine of patients who have responded to BCG therapy 37. 
Therefore, we will potentially check urinary levels of the following cytokines and chemokines by 
[CONTACT_6428]:  TRAIL, IL -1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL -10, IL -12, IL-18, IFN-γ, and TNF-α at week 0, 
week 3, week 5 (2-[ADDRESS_1059860] yield) 38 and at the end of the study.  
10.1.3 Blood 
For the BCG alone arm, blood samples for research analysis will be obtained 
•at week 0 or at randomization by 1 10cc purple top tube
•prior to treatment at weeks 3 and 8 by 2 10cc red top tubes and 6 10cc green top tubes 
•at the end of study (between weeks 17-20) by 1 10cc purple top tube, 2 10cc red top tubes 
and 6 10cc green top tubes. 
For the BCG + PANVAC vaccine arm , blood samples for research analysis will be obtained 
•at week 0 by 1 10cc purple top tube
•prior to treatment at weeks 0, 3, 8, 11, and 15 by 2 10cc red top tubes and 6 10cc green 
top tubes 
•at the end of study (between weeks 17-20) by 1 10cc purple top tube, 2 10cc red top tubes 
and 6 10cc green top tubes.  
Blood may also be collected on follow-up visits for up to 12 months following end of study 
cystoscopy.  No more than 10.5 mL/kg or 550 mL, whichever is smaller, will be obtained from 
adult subjects over an 8-week period.  The studies and method of storage for these specimens are 
described in Sections 10.1.5 and 10.2.
10.1.4 Tissue (if clinically available)
For subjects at the NIH: If tissue is clinically available, the Urologic Oncology Branch 
procedures for tissue collection will be followed.  A procurement form will be completed.  The 
tissue procurement nurse or a UOB-designated procurement staff member will work with an NCI 
pathologist following resection of the specimen to obtain tumor tissue from the resected 
specimen.  This will then be delivered by [CONTACT_768096].  
Specimens will be placed in cryovials and also be snap frozen in OCT for frozen tissue sections.  
Additional tissue will be placed into antibiotic-enriched culture media in order to establish an 
urothelial cancer cell line.  Patients will have the opportunity to opt out of cell line creation from 
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/2025
62their tissues.  Tissue that is used solely for research purposes will be obtained only if it can be 
obtained with minimal risk of complications from the procedure and only after the procedure has 
been explained to the patient and informed consent obtained.  In that event, the patient will be 
invited to participate in a tissue procurement protocol such as 97-C-0147.
cDNA arrays may be performed on tumor tissues to compare gene expression profiles in tumor 
cells before and after treatment with BCG or BCG and PANVAC.  Immunohistochemical and or 
cytogenetic analyses may be performed, depending on the tumor of origin.  Cell lines may be 
characterized by [CONTACT_93106][INVESTIGATOR_007], interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
immunohistochemistry, and/or flow cytometry.  Differences between cell lines will be 
manipulated to study the various molecular pathways active in nutrient sensing, cell cycle, cell 
signaling, proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastatic potential in urothelial cancer. 
Tumor-produced factors may be evaluated in serum or urine or a search for new tumor markers 
may be performed.  We may evaluate proteomic profiles of tissues or serum or urine and 
correlate these with disease and stage. This may potentially allow for the detection of non-
invasive predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers from urine specimens.  
Pathologic material, such as fixed tissue blocks from surgery performed at the NIH Clinical 
Center, outside surgeries or autopsy materials, may be obtained at the request of, and with 
written permission from the subject, or appropriate relatives.  These samples may undergo 
pathologic analysis by [CONTACT_768097]-immunologic or other analysis.  In particular to the current study, we would 
like to study the T-cell infiltration pattern within bladder tumors pre- and post-treatment.  
Specifically, we will look at:
•The expression of CEA and MUC-[ADDRESS_1059861]-
treatment in both arms
•The presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells in bladder tumor specimens pre- and post-treatment in 
both arms
•The presence of regulatory T cells (Tregs) by [CONTACT_768093]3 and CD4 in 
bladder tumor specimens pre- and post-treatment in both arms
•The presence of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in bladder tumor specimens pre- 
and post-treatment in both arms
10.1.5 Collection of immunologic blood samples
For the BCG alone arm: 
•at week 0 or at randomization by 1 10cc purple top tube
•prior to treatment at weeks 3 and 8 by 2 10cc red top tubes and 6 10cc green top tubes 
•at the end of study (between weeks 17-20) by 1 10cc purple top tube, 2 10cc red top tubes 
and 6 10cc green top tubes. 
For the BCG + PANVAC vaccine arm : 
•at week 0 by 1 10cc purple top tube
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/2025
63•prior to treatment at weeks 0, 3, 8, 11, and 15 by 2 10cc red top tubes and 6 10cc green 
top tubes 
•at the end of study (between weeks 17-20) by 1 10cc purple top tube, 2 10cc red top tubes 
and 6 10cc green top tubes.  
Additionally, blood may be collected on follow-up visits for up to 12 months following end of 
study cystoscopy/ bladder biopsy.  From this blood, PBMCs and sera will be isolated, when 
appropriate samples are available, for the following immune correlates: 
Immunologic testing will include:
1. Circulating Tumor Cytokines (CTC) analysis
2. IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays for CD8 T-cell responses specific for CEA, MUC-1, and 
Brachyury  (Limited to patients with HLA-A2 allele)
3. Measure CD4 antigen-specific response to CEA
4. Sera samples will be analyzed for the development of antibodies to CEA, MUC-1 and 
Brachyury.  (Samples from baseline and at end of study)
5. Flow cytometry analysis using 10 markers of all PBMC samples for each of the following 
cell types:  CD4, CD8, Tregs, MDSCs, and NK.
6. Serum for NCA (CEA-CAM) titers will be drawn anytime that a patient exhibits new 
onset neutropenia (ANC <1000) 
7. Immunologic studies will be repeated more frequently if clinically indicated, and any 
abnormalities potentially related to treatment will be followed until they have resolved, or 
have been determined to not be treatment-related or until the participant’s primary 
medical care is transferred from the principal investigator.

Tumor Immunology and Biology/NIH should be notified at [EMAIL_3867] for 
planning purposes.
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Biopsies
Biopsies will be obtained at the end of therapy solely for diagnostic purposes as per standard of 
care to ensure that cancer is no longer present. After pathologic diagnosis, each biopsy specimen 
will be further analyzed by [CONTACT_771973]: (a) expression of CEA and 
MUC-1 antigens on tumor cells, (b) the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells, (c) the presence of 
regulatory T cells (Tregs) by [CONTACT_768093]3 and CD4, and (d) the presence of 
myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC). 
Satisfactory analytical performance characteristics (specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility at 
the minimum) of individual antibodies or affinity ligands for use in immunohistochemistry will 
be demonstrated prior to analyses of glycosylated CEA and MUC-1 on tumor cells, CD4 and 
CD8 T cells, Tregs by [CONTACT_768093]3 and CD4, and MDSC.
[IP_ADDRESS] PBMCs, sera, and urine
The following time points will be analyzed: baseline (prior to vaccination in vaccination arm), 
week 3 (prior to BCG for both arms), week 8 (prior to last BCG for both arms), and at end of 
study (between weeks 17-20).  
PBMCs

Background:  Our studies in the LTIB have demonstrated the ELISPOT assay for IFN-γ 
production to be quantitative and reproducible as a measure of human T-cell responses to 
vaccination (26).  The continued use of one reproducible assay has been instrumental in our 
ability to evaluate and compare patients’ immune responses using different vaccines and vaccine 
strategies in the same institution, and among different cancer centers. ELISPOT assays 
employing the CEA agonist peptide and the MUC-[ADDRESS_1059867] already been 
developed.
Sera
Sera samples at all time points will be analyzed for the development of antibodies to CEA, 
MUC-1, and a cascade antigen Brachyury. 
Urine
Urine samples may be collected at baseline and at the end of therapy (week 17-20) for the 
presence of cytokines and chemokines. In addition, an effort will be made to collect urine at the 
time of BCG instillation #1 and #3 to assess for cytokine production in response to BCG therapy 
(as described earlier in section 10.1.2 and in Section 17.5 (Appendix E).  
For patients at CINJ, research samples consisting of urine (week 0, week 3, week 5, and week 
17-20) will be drawn.  These tubes will be further processed as per Appendix E, Section 17.[ADDRESS_1059868]. Linehan’s lab:

6610.2 SAMPLE STORAGE, TRACKING AND DISPOSITION
All specimens obtained for research purposes will be coded upon arrival in the UOB research 
laboratory to maintain patient confidentiality.  All samples will be accessioned and entered into a 
database (such as LabMatrix) with access limited to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_768048].  
The location of all samples will be carefully tracked in the database.  All stored samples will be 
coded and identifying patient information will not be placed on sample containers.  Stored 
samples will be kept in freezers/refrigerators or secure containers located in the Urologic 
Oncology Branch research laboratories or in approved storage facilities.  The research samples 
collected will be used for the correlative/biomarker studies mentioned above in Section 10.1.  
Tissue slides/blocks may be obtained in order to determine protocol eligibility.  Tissues are 
submitted to the NCI Laboratory of Pathology at the NIH Clinical Center for clinical 
determination of histologic features.  Specialized stains/assays may be used to clarify tissue 
phenotype.  After completion of analysis, tissue slides/blocks are either returned to the 
originating pathology department or archived in the Laboratory of Pathology or Urologic 
Oncology Branch and tracked in the UOB database (LabMatrix).  Archived material will be 
retained for the duration of the study unless the originating pathology department requests return.
Coded/anonymous samples with minimal clinical information may be shared with qualified NIH 
and non-NIH researchers who have IRB-approved protocols with similar research objectives.   
No personal identifying information such as name, address, or date of birth will be provided to 
the non-UOB investigator.  In the event a subject is eligible to participate in a clinical trial based 
on tumor characteristics, coded tissue samples may be sent to an outside laboratory.  Samples 
will be ordered and tracked through CRIS Screens.  Should a CRIS screen not be available, the 
NIH form 2803-[ADDRESS_1059870] or destroyed and meet the criteria in section 7.2.1.
10.2.1 Storage and Tracking of Collected Blood Samples 
All data associated with the patient samples is protected by [CONTACT_2329] a secure database.  All samples 
drawn at the NIH Clinical Center will be stored in the laboratories of the Urologic Oncology 
Branch as previously described.  
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/2025
67Serum samples will be stored in -80˚C freezers and PBMC samples will be stored in vapor phase 
liquid nitrogen at the NCI Frederick Central Repository in Frederick, MD. Samples drawn at the 
NIH Clinical Center will be transported by [CONTACT_771974]; samples from CINJ will be sent 
via Fed-Ex, as previously described.
Samples will be tracked and managed by [CONTACT_195246]. Leidos Biomedical 
Research, Inc. manages the NCI Frederick Central Repositories. NCI Frederick Central 
Repositories store, among other things, biological specimens in support of NIH clinical studies. 
All specimens are stored in secure, limited access facilities with sufficient security, back-up and 
emergency support capability and monitoring to ensure long-term integrity of the specimens for 
research. 
Sample data is stored in the BioSpecimen Inventory (BSI) System II. This inventory tracking 
system is used to manage the storage and retrieval of specimens as well as maintain specimen 
data. BSI is designed for controlled, concurrent access. It provides a real-time, multi-user 
environment for tracking millions of specimens. The system controls how and in what order 
database updates and searches are performed. This control prevents deadlocks and race 
conditions. For security, BSI has user password access, 3 types of user access levels, and 36 user 
permissions (levels of access) that can be set to control access to the system functions. BSI 
provides audit tracking for processes that are done to specimens including shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], returning to 
inventory, aliquoting, thawing, additives, and other processes. BSI tracks the ancestry of 
specimens as they are aliquoted, as well as discrepancies and discrepancy resolution for 
specimens received by [CONTACT_195247]. If a specimen goes out of the inventory, the system 
maintains data associated with the withdrawal request. Vials are labeled with a unique BSI ID 
which is printed in both eye-readable and bar-coded format. No patient-specific information is 
encoded in this ID. 
Investigators are granted view, input and withdrawal authority only for their specimens.  They 
may not view specimen data or access specimens for which they have not been authorized. 
Access to specimen storage is confined to repository staff. Visitors to the repositories are 
escorted by [CONTACT_195248].
10.2.2 Protocol Completion/Sample Destruction
Once primary research objectives for the protocol are achieved, intramural researchers can 
request access to remaining samples providing they have an IRB approved protocol and patient 
consent.
Samples, and associated data, will be stored permanently unless the patient withdraws consent.  
Loss or unanticipated destruction of samples will be reported per section 7.2.1.

12.1 RESPONSE C RITERIA
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable for toxicity
All patients who receive at least one dose of protocol therapy will be evaluable for toxicity from 
the time of their first treatment with TICE BCG or rV-PANVAC™.   All observed toxicities will 
be tabulated using CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_1059873] grade experienced for each patient and presented for each 
study arm.
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable for objective response
Only those patients who have biopsy-proven disease present at baseline, have received at least 
one cycle of therapy (6 or fewer weekly intravesical doses of BCG), and have had their disease 
re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  These patients will have their response 
classified according to the definitions stated below.  
In order to compare the secondary outcomes between study arms, all durations will be measured 
from the start of TICE BCG therapy (week 3).  This is the start of therapy for the TICE BCG arm 
alone.  BCG is not started at week 0 for two reasons:  1) to allow adequate healing from previous 
TURBT and 2) allow vaccinia priming vaccine to be given to combination group at week 0 with 
enough recovery time to possibly make the administration of BCG in week 3 safer in these 
patients.  Furthermore, by [CONTACT_771976], patients in each group will start BCG at the 
same time after study entry.
[IP_ADDRESS] Recurrence-free survival
The recurrence-free survival duration will be measured from the start of TICE BCG therapy 
(week 3) until disease recurrence or death due to any cause in each arm.  Recurrence is suspected 
and/or determined by [CONTACT_768099]/or cystoscopic exam and then confirmed pathologically 
after a TURBT.  Positive cytology in the absence of pathologic confirmation is not considered to 
be a recurrence.
[IP_ADDRESS] Progression-Free Survival
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, 
whichever occurs first. The duration of progression-free survival is measured from the start of 
TICE BCG therapy (week 3) until progression or death due to any cause in each study arm. 
Progression is defined as upstaging from a lower stage to a higher stage (e.g., Ta to T1 or T1 to 
T2-4; or any N+ or M+ in these high grade tumors.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Time to Tumor Recurrence
The duration of time measured from the start of TICE BCG therapy (week 3) until recurrence is 
noted.

Data will be verified to ensure that: 
•Eligible patients are confirmed and eligibility checklist was completed. Consent form 
must be signed prior to registration with Central Registration.
•Treatment is given according to protocol (dated notes about doses given, complications, 
and clinical outcomes).
•Toxicity is assessed according to protocol (laboratory report slips, etc.)
•Response is assessed according to protocol (X-ray, scan, lab reports, and date noted on 
clinical assessment, as appropriate).
•Drug Accountability Records are kept for each patient.
All data obtained during the conduct of the protocol will be kept in secure network drives or in 
approved alternative sites that comply with NIH security standards. Primary and final analyzed 
data will have identifiers so that research data can be attributed to an individual human subject 
participant.
All adverse events, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, 
regardless of severity, will be followed until return to baseline or stabilization of event. Patients 
will be followed for adverse events for [ADDRESS_1059874].
An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by [CONTACT_39132]:

One interim analysis for futility will be performed according to the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_124502]. 39 
Specifically, the interim analysis will be performed when half of the expected events (20) have 
been observed. At that time, if the observed event rate of the TICE BCG+PANVAC arm is 
higher than that of the TICE BCG alone arm (i.e. the hazard ratio ≥ 1), we would consider 
terminating the trial and concluding that an advantage for the BCG+PANVAC regimen has not 
been established.
For the purpose of protecting patient safety, we implement the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_771929].
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/2025
80If one patient experiences a grade 5 event, thought to be possibly or probably due to the 
combination therapy, the study will be stopped. For grade 3 or 4 event, the study will be stopped 
according to the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877].  These adverse events are described in more detail in 
Section 7.

The operating characteristic of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_771930]. Based on 10,000 
simulations, the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_771931] 0.04 when the serious adverse event rate is at the anticipated level of 6% and 
0.94 when the serious adverse event rate is 30%. This is deemed reasonable for protecting patient 
safety.
14.2 SECONDARY ENDPOINTS
Using Kaplan-Meier methods, we will estimate the probability distribution of progression-free 
survival and the time to recurrence.  Results will be summarized by [CONTACT_9310] (12 months) 
with 95% CI.  Exploratory analyses of these secondary objectives will compare the two 
treatment arms using the log rank test.  Fisher’s exact test will be used to compare frequency 
distributions of toxicity grades between the two arms.  
14.3 EXPLORATORY/CORRELATIVE ENDPOINTS
14.3.1 To characterize the expression of MUC1 and CEA in bladder tumor specimens pre- 
(week 0) and the change in expression post-vaccination (on tissue obtained between 
weeks 17-20) for patients treated with TICE BCG+PANVAC™.
[IP_ADDRESS] MUC1 expression will be evaluated using IHC. A positive result is defined if >5% of 
tumor cells reacted with any intensity.  Intensity will be arbitrarily scored on a 4 point 
scale:  0 (no staining), 1+ (weak staining), 2+ (moderate staining), and 3+ (strong 
staining).  Potential antibody will be clone Ma695 dilution 1:100 (Novocastra, 
Newcastle upon Tyne, England) but has to be analytically validated using appropriate 
positive and negative controls prior to use.22
[IP_ADDRESS] CEA expression in FFPE pre- and post-treatment tissues will be evaluated by [CONTACT_4658]. A 
positive result is defined when the cytoplasmic staining is equal in intensity to 
glycocalyceal staining.  Tumors will be scored as 0 (no signal), 1+ (signal in <25% 
sampled tumor area), 2+ (26-75% of tumor cells), and 3+ (>75% of tumor cells).  The 
potential antibody will be CD66e (clone 12-140-10; Novocastra, Newcastle upon-Tyne, 
England; dilution 1:500; Ventana NexES immunostainer; protease digestion). 
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/2025
8114.3.1.3 Statistical Analysis:  For both MUC1 and CEA expression the distributions of IHC 
staining intensity at baseline and post-vaccination as well as the change in score will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics. The results will be summarized by [CONTACT_771978] 95% confidence interval of positive staining tissue samples at 
baseline and the distribution of pre and post-vaccination combinations (--, -+, +-, ++) 
characterizing the change with treatment.  Results will be presented separately for each 
treatment arm.  The distributions for the two treatment arms will be compared using a 
chi square test.
14.3.2 To explore the CD4 Antigen-Specific response to MUC1 and CEA
[IP_ADDRESS] The CD4 antigen-specific response will be assessed by [CONTACT_771979]4+ T cells obtained 
from PBMCs pre- and post-treatment with irradiated APCs in the presence of MUC1 
and CEA peptides/proteins. The IFN-γ levels will be measured by [CONTACT_6428].  Flu protein 
(positive control) and myoglobulin (negative control) will serve as controls.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Statistical Analysis:  Descriptive statistics will be calculated to summarize the CD4 
antigen-specific response to MUC1 and CEA determined pre-treatment as well as the 
change post-vaccination. The same methods for analysis for each treatment arm and the 
comparison of arms as described for evaluation of the immune response to the vaccines 
will be applied.  
14.3.3 To explore the CD8-mediated immune response to MUC1 and CEA
[IP_ADDRESS] Assess CD8 T cell response by [CONTACT_771980]- and post-treatment PBMCs 
using CEA and MUC1-specific T lymphocytes.  We will be using an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_771932] ~65% of HLA groups for MUC1 and 
~80% of HLA groups for CEA
[IP_ADDRESS] Statistical Analysis:  A positive CD8 T cell response is defined as  ≥ 2-fold increase 
post treatment compared with the pretreatment value in IFN-γ-secretion.   Descriptive 
statistics will be calculated to summarize the CD8 T cell response as continuous 
variables to MUC1 and CEA at both time points for each study arm.  In addition, the 
change from pre- to post-treatment will be summarized by [CONTACT_771981] a positive response.  The proportion with 95% confidence intervals will be 
presented for each treatment arm along with additional descriptive statistics (e.g. mean 
change, the mean percent change).  Fisher’s exact test will be performed to compare the 
positive CD8 T cell response between the two treatment arms.

Version Date: 05/22/2025
82All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those who 
received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the response rate.  
All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients.  Subanalyses may then be performed on 
the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for whom major protocol deviations have been 
identified (e.g., early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major 
protocol deviations, etc.).  However, these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing 
conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the 
analysis should be clearly reported.  The 95% confidence intervals should also be provided. 
[ADDRESS_1059887] SELECTION
15.1.1 Selection Based on sex, Ethnicity, and Race
Subjects from all racial/ethnic groups and both sex are eligible for this study if they meet the 
eligibility criteria. To date, there is no information that suggests that differences in drug 
metabolism, immune response or disease response would be expected in one group compared 
with another. Efforts will be made to extend accrual to a representative population, but in this 
preliminary study, a balance must be struck between patient safety considerations and limitations 
on the number of individuals exposed to potentially toxic and/or ineffective treatments on one 
hand and the need to explore sex and ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other hand. If 
differences in outcome that correlate with ethnic identity are noted, accrual may be expanded or 
a follow-up study may be written to investigate those differences more fully.

for appointing a surrogate decision maker for adult subjects who are (a) decisionally impaired, 
and (b) who do not have a legal guardian or durable power of attorney, will be followed.
Participating sites should adhere to appropriate procedures specific to their site.
15.4 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS
BCG is a standard of care treatment and will be used in this study.   The biggest risk of using this 
agent after failing an initial induction course of BCG is progression of disease to muscle-invasive 
disease.  However, this occurs after multiple, failed BCG induction treatments and occurs more 
often after [ADDRESS_1059889] of care treatment for high grade BCG refractory 
NMIBC.  However, since enrollment into this study requires patients to refuse radical surgery or 
not be medically fit for surgery, we believe the risk of proceeding with another induction course 
of BCG is outweighed by [CONTACT_771982].  
Other risks of the use of BCG include local bladder symptoms such as blood in the urine, urinary 
frequency, urgency of urination, dysuria (pain), and bladder spasms which are often self-limiting 
and usually resolve within a week by [CONTACT_771983] (e.g. anti-inflammatories, anti-spasmodics, hydration, etc.).  Finally, a rare potential 
risk of BCG administration is development of “BCG-osis” which is a form of 
bacteremia/urosepsis or systemic BCG infection that occurs with BCG administration on very 
rare occasions.  In this event, patients will be taken off the study and treated with anti-microbials 
as per recommendations by [CONTACT_771984].  The addition of PANVAC™ is 
unknown but given the relative safety of both agents and different routes of administration, we 
presume that the risk is minimal. 
15.4.[ADDRESS_1059890]/abdomen/pelvis as 
described in the monitoring schedule as described in Appendix C (Section 17.3). Patients will 
also be required to have a local physician to provide long-term care and to monitor for 
complications.  If patients suffer any physical injury as a result of the participation in this study, 
immediate medical treatment is available at the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center, 
Bethesda, Maryland.  Although no compensation is available, any injury will be evaluated and

15.4.3 Provisions for Monitoring Data Collection to Ensure Safety of Subjects
As information is gathered from this trial, clinical results will be shared with patients. Laboratory 
and clinical data will be frequently gathered and any new significant finding(s) found during the 
course of the research, which may affect a patient’s willingness to participate further, will be 
explained.  Confidentiality of information concerning participants will be maintained, including 
in all publications and presentations resulting from this study.  Names of participants or material 
identifying participants will not be released without permission, except as such release is 
required by [CONTACT_2371]. Records at the Clinical Center are maintained according to current legal 
requirements, and are made available for review by [CONTACT_771985], the 
Food and Drug Administration, or other authorized users, as stated under the guidelines 
established by [CONTACT_33842].  
15.5 RISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS
The patients we will be enrolling have high grade NMIBC that has already failed the standard of 
care therapy, BCG induction.  These patients are on the verge of developi[INVESTIGATOR_771934]-invasive 
disease which requires potentially morbid surgery and change in quality of life.  Therefore, they 
are very interested in strategies to preserve the bladder.  Repeat induction BCG therapy is a 
standard of care and is being given to all patients in this study.  The addition of PANVAC™ may 
potentially improve upon the poor RFS seen with BCG alone and hopefully this study will bear 
that out.  Alternative treatments besides surgery include other intravesical agents that have not 
shown to be that effective.  Whether the vaccine will have any clinical effect upon improving the 
outcome with BCG is unknown, therefore, benefit cannot be promised nor can the chance of 
benefit be accurately predicted.  Patients’ participation in this study is voluntary and refusal will 
not result in penalty or loss of benefit to which patient is otherwise entitled.  
Participation may be discontinued at any time without penalty and the patient can ask questions.

If there is an unexpected enrollment of a research participant for whom there is no translated 
extant IRB approved consent document, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or those authorized to 
obtain informed consent will use the Short Form Oral Consent Process as described in MAS 
Policy M77-2, OHSRP SOP 12, 45 CFR 46.117 (b) (2), (If a study with an IND or IDE, also cite 
21 CFR 50.27 (b) (2)).  The summary that will be used is the English version of the extant IRB 
approved consent document.  Signed copi[INVESTIGATOR_771935].
Unless the PI [INVESTIGATOR_74842]’s language, an interpreter will be present to 
facilitate the conversation (using either the long translated form or the short form). Preferably 
someone who is independent of the subject (i.e., not a family member) will assist in presenting 
information and obtaining consent. Whenever possible, interpreters will be provided copi[INVESTIGATOR_338726] (24 to 48 
hours if possible). 
We request prospective IRB approval of the use of the short form process for non-English 
speaking subjects and will notify the IRB at the time of continuing review of the frequency of the 
use of the Short Form.

9017.2 APPENDIX B: CTEP M ULTICENTER GUIDELINES
If an institution wishes to collaborate with other participating institutions in performing a 
CTEP sponsored research protocol, then the following guidelines must be followed.
Responsibility of the Protocol Chair 
•The Protocol Chair will be the single liaison with the CTEP Protocol and Information 
Office (PIO).  The Protocol Chair is responsible for the coordination, development, 
submission, and approval of the protocol as well as its subsequent amendments.  The 
protocol must not be rewritten or modified by [CONTACT_36475].  
There will be only one version of the protocol, and each participating institution will use 
that document.  The Protocol Chair is responsible for assuring that all participating 
institutions are using the correct version of the protocol.
•The Protocol Chair is responsible for the overall conduct of the study at all participating 
institutions and for monitoring its progress.  All reporting requirements to CTEP are the 
responsibility of the Protocol Chair. 
•The Protocol Chair is responsible for the timely review of Adverse Events (AE) to assure 
safety of the patients.
•The Protocol Chair will be responsible for the review of and timely submission of data 
for study analysis.
Responsibilities of the Coordinating Center
•Each participating institution will have an appropriate assurance on file with the Office 
for Human Research Protection (OHRP), NIH.  The Coordinating Center is responsible 
for assuring that each participating institution has an OHRP assurance and must maintain 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_36419]. 
•Prior to the activation of the protocol at each participating institution, an OHRP form 310 
(documentation of IRB approval) must be submitted to the CTEP PIO.
•The Coordinating Center is responsible for central patient registration.  The Coordinating 
Center is responsible for assuring that IRB approval has been obtained at each 
participating site prior to the first patient registration from that site.
•The Coordinating Center is responsible for the preparation of all submitted data for 
review by [CONTACT_36476].
•The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of AE reports.  There are two 
options for AE reporting: (1) participating institutions may report directly to CTEP with a 
copy to the Coordinating Center, or (2) participating institutions report to the 
Coordinating Center who in turn report to CTEP.  The Coordinating Center will submit 
AE reports to the Protocol Chair for timely review.
•Audits may be accomplished in one of two ways:  (1) source documents and research 
records for selected patients are brought from participating sites to the Coordinating 
Center for audit, or (2) selected patient records may be audited on-site at participating 
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/[ADDRESS_1059897] forms, patient registration 
lists, response assessments scans, x-rays, etc. available for the audit.
Inclusion of Multicenter Guidelines in the Protocol
•The protocol must include the following minimum information: 
➢The title page must include the name [CONTACT_170740], telephone number and e-mail address of the responsible investigator at each 
participating institution.
➢The Coordinating Center must be designated on the title page.
➢Central registration of patients is required.  The procedures for registration must be 
stated in the protocol.
➢Data collection forms should be of a common format.  Sample forms should be 
submitted with the protocol.  The frequency and timing of data submission forms to 
the Coordinating Center should be stated.

9217.3 APPENDIX C: PANVAC  [RECOMBINANT V ACCINIA-
CEA(D609)/MUC1(L93)/TRICOM]  PATIENT INSTRUCTION SHEET
1. What vaccination site reactions can you expect?
2. How should you care for the vaccination site? 
3. Are there any activities I should avoid?
4. What about contact [CONTACT_195277]?
5. Who do I contact [CONTACT_152561] I have a question?
 1. What vaccination site reactions can you expect?
A typi[INVESTIGATOR_195219] a patient who has been previously vaccinated with vaccinia includes the 
appearance of a small swelling in 2-[ADDRESS_1059898] 
very little skin reaction.   Often the leg that received the vaccine may become swollen.  Swollen or 
tender lymph nodes (“glands”) in the groin may be felt. A fever to 100-101F may occur on the 
second or third day.  You may notice that you feel tired for 3 or 4 days. The vaccination site may 
itch for about 2 weeks while the scab is forming.  You can take acetaminophen ("Tylenol") if you 
have any aches or fever but should avoid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  If fever continues for more than a day or two, 
you should call to speak to the clinic nurse or the research nurse. 
In patients who have never received vaccinia or in some who received it a very long time ago, a 
red swelling is followed by a blisters on day 5 to 6 and then formation of a pustule (or "boil") 1-[ADDRESS_1059899] week leaving a scar roughly 1/2 inch in 
diameter.  Fever and malaise (the "blahs") may occur during the blister and pustular phases. 
Swollen and tender lymph nodes may persist for months. Many of the local toxicities described 
(e.g., pustule and scab formation) are typi[INVESTIGATOR_195220]. These reactions may be seen, but are usually not seen 
when administered via subcutaneous injection.
 2. How should you care for the vaccination site?
Live vaccinia virus is in skin cells at the vaccination site during the 1-2 weeks until healing has 
occurred.  Maximal viral "shedding" from the vaccination site occurs from days 4-14, but can 
continue until the scab falls off from the skin. After that there is no vaccinia virus in your body.  
You can spread the virus to other parts of your body or to other people by [CONTACT_195278], mouth, a cut or some other break in the skin.You do not pass 
vaccinia virus by [CONTACT_195279].
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/[ADDRESS_1059900] to prevent transmission of virus.  You should also use two types of barriers over 
your vaccination site at all times until the scab is gone.  These barriers are (1) the bandage and (2) 
clothing (pants or elbow length sleeves depending on the site of vaccination).  These barriers 
should remain in place until the scab has fallen off.
For dressing care you will have a bag with some no-stick "First-Aid" or "Telfa" pads, disposable 
gloves, and zip-lock plastic bags.  If you run out of supplies between visits, you can use a dry 
sterile bandage (gauze or "First-Aid" or "Telfa") from the drug store.
The no-stick pad ("First-Aid" or "Telfa" pad) dressing should be worn until the site has healed.  If 
it remains clean and dry and is not coming off, you do not need to change it.  If the dressing gets 
wet either from drainage from the vaccination or from water when you are showering or if it starts 
coming off, you should remove it and put on a clean bandage.  Wear the gloves when handling the 
old dressings.  Put the old dressing and the gloves in the zip-lock bag, then wash your hands, put 
on the new bandage, and wash your hands again.  You do not need to wear gloves for the new 
bandage.  You do not need to wash the vaccination site, but while the dressing is off, you may 
wash it lightly with a cloth, soap, and water.  If you do wash, blot the site dry with a towel (don't 
rub), then put the wash cloth and the towel in the laundry.  Do not let the shower run on the 
unbandaged site because live virus could be washed onto other areas on your body. Do not put any 
steroid cream, medicated creams, or other ointments on the vaccination site.
Before you throw away the zip-lock bag with the old dressing and gloves in it, pour a little bleach 
(about a quarter cup) in the bag to help kill any virus.
Wash your hands after each step.
 3. Are there any activities I should avoid or take special care?
You should not go swimming until the vaccination site has healed and you no longer need to wear 
a bandage on it. 
If you wear contact [CONTACT_13276], have removable dentures, have a colostomy or any other "open" area on 
your body that needs daily care, always wash your hands very well before handling your contact 
[CONTACT_13276], dentures, dressings, etc.  Take care of all of these procedures before changing your 
vaccination dressing.
Abbreviated Title: Vaccine and BCG for bladder ca
Version Date: 05/22/[ADDRESS_1059901] with other people?
Remember, frequent careful hand washing by [CONTACT_195281].  During the time you need to wear 
a bandage (for 7-14 days after vaccination) there are several kinds of people with whom you 
should avoid close contact.  "Close contact" means that you sleep in the same bed with the person, 
give the person baths, and/or touch their bare skin to change their clothes (or diapers), apply 
ointments, or change their bandages. 
The individuals you should avoid include children < 3years of age; pregnant women or nursing 
women; individuals with eczema, history of eczema or other skin conditions such as active cases 
of extensive psoriasis, severe rashes, generalized itching, infections, burns, chicken pox, or skin 
trauma; and/or immune suppressed individuals such as individuals with leukemia or lymphoma, 
with AIDS, or those receiving immunosuppressive treatment (for example, after organ transplant).  
 5. Who do I contact [CONTACT_152561] I have a question?
If you have any questions at any time, please call.  A nurse or a physician is available 24 hours a 
day by [CONTACT_756].  To speak with your main doctor or with a clinic nurse, call the Urology Clinic 
between 8 AM and 4:30 PM Monday to Friday.  To speak with the research nurses, call the 
research nurse office during the day; during nights, weekends, and sometimes during the day, 
when the research office is empty, you may leave a message for the research nurse on the 
answering machine.  You can call the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_771940].  In an 
emergency on weekends, evenings, or holidays, you can always get in touch with the on-call 
urologic oncology doctor (fellow) (listed below). This doctor can be contact[CONTACT_771987], who will page the on call doctor.  The on call doctor will then call 
you back.   If you have to go to an emergency room near your home, go to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_195221], and 
then have the doctors there call the NIH for more information.

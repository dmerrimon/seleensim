14 June  2014  PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  Api[INVESTIGATOR_157260] -
operative atrial fibrillation: a prospective, controlled, 
randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_157261] & Names:  Sanford Medical Center, Fargo, ND  
Research Hypothesis:  We hypothesize that there will be no significant differences 
between api[INVESTIGATOR_157262]/stroke or bleeding events when utilized for new -onset postoperative 
atrial fibrillation after isolated coronary artery by[CONTACT_15694] (CABG).  
Study Schema:  
Drugs / Doses /  
Length of Treatment)  Patients who develop persistent atrial fibrillation after isolated coronary artery by[CONTACT_157309] (standard of care) or api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].  
Warfarin  will be dosed daily, with  International 
Normalized R atio (INR) monitoring per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23155].  
After discharge, warf arin dosing will be managed by [CONTACT_157310] a target  INR of [ADDRESS_182123] two of the following characteristics: age ≥  80 years, weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum 
creatinine ≥  1.5 mg/dL.  
Patients will remain on anticoagulation until no longer 
needed  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] 30 days of surgery).  S tudy 
follow -up will be through the patient’s 30- day follow -up 
appointment.

Api[INVESTIGATOR_157258]   
14 June  2014  Study Objectives:  
 1) Primary endpoint: freedom from stroke or 
thromboembolic event will be captured.  
 
2) Secondary endpoints:  -units of blood given after initiation of anticoagulation 
medication  
-total post -operative length of stay  
-duration from diagnosis of post -operative atrial fibrillation 
(POAF) to discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
-time in therapeutic range of INR if on warfarin  
-patient compliance percentage to api[INVESTIGATOR_157263]  
 3) Safety assessments: major  and minor  bleeding  events,  as 
defined by [CONTACT_34324] , will be captured.  Clinical events and blood 
product utilization will be identified and captured.  
 
Study Design:  In this open- label, prospective, randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 
patients who develop atrial fibrillation after isolated 
coronary artery by[CONTACT_157311]. Patients 
with persistent atrial fibrillation (>12 hours) or 
recurrent sustained atrial fibrillation ( >2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_157264] 30 minutes) will be 
candidates for inclusion.  Upon meeting study inclusion 
and exclusion criteria, and after  informed consent, patients 
will be randomized to either the standard of care (warfarin 
per protocol) or api[INVESTIGATOR_157265]. Routine 
postoperative care after CABG will occur in both groups. 
Upon discharge, anticoagulation in both groups will be 
managed by [CONTACT_157312]. Patients will be 
followed for 30 days after surgery.  
Accrual Goal:  
(Total number of subject s) 56 patients  
Accrual Rate:  
(Number of subject s 
expected per month)  We anticipate enrolling 2 -3 patients per month based on 
current projections.

Api[INVESTIGATOR_157258]   
14 June  2014  Criteria for Evaluat ion: 
(Efficacy, safety,  
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], etc.)  Efficacy will be measured by [CONTACT_157313]. Events 
relating to thromboembolism or stroke will be adjudicated using pre -determined definitions by [CONTACT_157314]’s treatment arm.   
Safety, including major and minor bleeding will be  
quantified and defined by [CONTACT_157315], as described in section 6.4.2, subsection (2). Clinical events that occur during the study period will be quantified and measured, including adverse events, serious adverse events, blood product utilization, length of stay, duration of atrial fibrillation, and time to adequate 
anticoagulation.  
Data Analysis Plan  Efficacy and safety data will retrospectively assessed and 
analyzed after the patient has completed the 30 -day course 
of therapy.  Events relating to thromboembolism or stroke 
will be adjudicated using pre -defined endpoint definitions 
by [CONTACT_6222] c ommittee members that remain blinded to 
treatment arm. Safety events, including major bleeding will 
be as defined by [CONTACT_34324].
3  In the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], bleeding will be 
assessed daily by [CONTACT_157316], and defined by a drop in hemoglobin of > 2 
gm/dL in the previous [ADDRESS_182124] two units of  blood 
products.  
Statistics: Continuous variables will be expressed as mean ± standard 
deviation or median with interquartile range (IQR) as 
appropriate. Continuous variables will be compared using t-tests for parametric 
data or Wilcoxon analysis for 
nonparametric data.   We will complete the analysis in an 
intent -to-treat manner.  We will include analysis for 
confidence intervals and other appropriate statistical tests to assess binary outcomes.  We realize that statistica l 
comparison between groups will be of limited utility in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_157271]. Data will be analyzed using JMP 
software, version 12.0.0 (Cary, NC).

nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and 
for the prophylaxis of DVT in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery. Api[INVESTIGATOR_157273].  
Patients undergoing coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806] (CABG) are at risk for the  
development of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF).  POAF adversely impacts patient 
outcomes, and patients who develop POAF are at increased risk for stroke or 
thromboembolic complications, with an increased duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Usually occu rring in the early postoperative period and usually short -lived, POAF requires 
anticoagulation when persistent or recurrent.  Duration of therapy for POAF is typi[INVESTIGATOR_107899] -term, as POAF is usually short -term and self -limiting over 3 -4 weeks.  
Warfarin th erapy has been the mainstay of therapy for patients with POAF. While the 
duration of therapy is usually short (3- 4 weeks), complications of anticoagulation do 
occur.  Additionally, warfarin therapy for POAF is associated with increased length of stay, need for monitoring, and bleeding complications.

bleeding was significantly redu ced in patients receiving api[INVESTIGATOR_157275].  
The use of api[INVESTIGATOR_157276], however, and 
whether these benefits will be seen in patients with POAF is unclear . In this small 
prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we aim to compare api[INVESTIGATOR_157277]/stroke and bleeding events when 
utilized in patients with new -onset postoperative atrial fibrillation after isolated coronary

patient to normal sinus rhythm.6 In addition to warfarin, there are four novel 
anticoagulants approved for the management of non- valvular atrial fibrillation: api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], 
rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and da bigatran etexilate mesylate. Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], rivaroxaban, and 
edoxaban are FDA approved for prophylaxis of cerebrovascular accidents and systemic 
thromboembolisms in the maintenance of atrial fibrillation.7,[ADDRESS_182129] not been 
well studied for atrial fibrillation due to reversible causes such as POAF, or immediately after a major surg ery such as a CABG.  The ARISTOTLE study excluded patients with 
atrial fibrillation due to reversible causes such as surgery, and the RE -LY and ROCKET 
AF trials excluded patients with an increased risk of bleeding, including those that underwent major surgery in the previous 30 days, as well as patients with atrial fibrillation due to reversible causes, specifically cardiac surgery.

States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part  50 (21CFR50).  
[ADDRESS_182135]/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_157287].  
All potential serious breaches must be reported to Bri stol-Myers  Squibb (BMS) 
immediately. A serious breach is a breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in 
connection with the study or the protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, 
the safety or physical or mental integrity of the su bjects of the study or the scientific 
value of the study.  
Study personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by [CONTACT_8640], 
training, and experience to perform their respective tasks.  
This study will not use the services of study personnel  where sanctions have been 
invoked or where there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medical 
licensure; debarment).  
3.[ADDRESS_182136]/Independent Ethics 
Committee  
Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and d ated approval/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_5698]/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recruitment 
materials/process (eg, advertisements), and any other written information to be provided to subjects. The investigator or sponsor should also provide the I RB/IEC with a copy of 
the Investigator  Brochure or product labeling information to be provided to subjects, and 
any updates.  
The investigator should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates, and other information 
(eg, expedited safety reports, amendment s, and administrative letters) according to 
regulatory requirements or institution procedures . 
3.[ADDRESS_182137]: 
1) Provide a copy of the consent form and written information about the study in the 
language in which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study participation. The langua ge must be non- technical and easily understood. 
2) Allow time necessary for subject to inquire about the details of the study.  
3) Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_26479].  
4) Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_132831], prior to the beginning of the study, and after any revisions are completed for new information. 
5) Revis e the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available 
that is relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093], should fully inform the subject of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the subject's willingness to continue participation in the study. This communication should be documented.  
6) Reconsenting of patients can be done in person or, if the patient is unable to reconsent in person, over the phone . If the reconsent is required to be performed over the phone, 
the coordinator will send an updated consent form to the patient via mail or electronically. When the patient has received the consent, the coordinator will review the consent with the patient over the phone. Any questions can be answered by [CONTACT_157319]. The patient will then send the original signed consent back to the coordinator. The coordinator who conducted the phone consent will sign and date the applicabl e line and upload to the patient’s chart. The 
coordinator must also document the consent discussion and receipt of the consent in the patient’s EMR.  
The rights, safety, and well -being of the study subjects are the most important 
considerations and should prevail over interests of science and society.

• Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually acti ve 
are exempt from contraceptive requirements.  However they must still undergo 
pregnancy testing as described in this section. 
 
Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with 
WOCBP on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy. Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male subjects who are 
sexually active with WOCBP on the use of highly effective methods of contraception. 
Highly effective methods of contraception have a failure rate of < 1% when used consistently and correctly.  
At a minimum, subjects must agree to the use of one method of hig hly effective 
contraception as listed below:  
• Male condoms with spermicide  
• Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], 
vaginal ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices  (IUDs) such as Mirena 

14 June  2014  4.2.3  Women of Childbearing Potential  
A Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has 
experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or 
bilateral oophorectomy) and is not postmenopausal. M enopause is defined as [ADDRESS_182143] a serum follicle stimulating hormone, (FSH) level > 40mIU/mL to  confirm menopause.  
*Females treated with hormone replacement therapy, (HRT) are likely to have artificially suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The 
duration of the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators 
should use their judgement in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is >40 
mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered 
postmenopausal :  
• 1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)  
• 4 week minimum for transdermal products  
• [ADDRESS_182144] (and non- investigational product at 
the discretion of the investigator) for any of the following reasons:  
• Withdrawal of informed consent (subject’s decision to withdra w for any reason).  
• Any clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the subject.  
• Pregnancy  
− Instruct WOC BP to contact [CONTACT_157325] (eg, missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study participation. Institutional policy and local regulations should determine the frequency of on- study pregnancy tests for WOCBP 
enrolled in the study.  
− The investigator must immediately notify BMS if a study subject becomes pregnant.  
22 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_157258]   
14 June  2014  • Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntary 
incarceration for treatment of either a ps ychiatric or physical (eg, infectious 
disease) illness.  
• While p atients may request withdrawal from the study at any time, they  will be 
advised to check with their medical provider before discontinuing any 
anticoagulant  medication, for their safety . 
•  Subject s can voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time, but the 
investigators will continue to follow the patient so that an intent- to-treat analysis 
can be performed. Failure to take study medication as prescribed, or  failure to 
follow up as directed with the anticoagulation clinic, will be noted in our analysis to the best extent we are able.  
• Any data collected before withdrawal will be used for study outcomes, although it 
will be noted that the participant did not complete the 30 -day course of therapy.  
Attempts will be made to determine and note the reason for withdrawal.  
• All subjects who discontinue should comply with protocol -specified follow -up 
procedures outlined in Section 6. The only exception to this requireme nt is when a 
subject withdraws consent for all study procedures or loses the ability to consent freely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness). If a subject withdraws before completing  the 
study, the reason for withdrawal must be documented appropriately.

required processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets).  
5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to a Treatment  
Patients will be randomized to a treatment arm (api[INVESTIGATOR_157289]) in a 1:[ADDRESS_182148]  
Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] : Api[INVESTIGATOR_157295] 5 mg by [CONTACT_104744] , except in the case of 
the criteria listed below in “dose modifications” .  The duration of therapy will be at least 
30 days.  The patient’s physician may determine that anticoagulati on therapy should be 
continued after the study period, based on their examination of the patient at the 30- day 
post-operative examination.  
Api[INVESTIGATOR_157296] a patient has active pathological bleeding.

Api[INVESTIGATOR_157258]   
14 June  2014  If a dose of api[INVESTIGATOR_157297], the dose should be taken as soon 
as possible on the same day and then continue with twice daily administration as before.   
The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose. 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_157298]. Api[INVESTIGATOR_157299].  No dose 
adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment alone, including those 
with end- stage renal disease (ESRD) maintained on hemodialysis, except nonvalvular 
atrial fibrillation  patients who meet the criteria for dosage adjustment.  Patients with 
ESRD (CrCl <15 mL/min) receiving or not receiving hemodialysis were not studied in 
clinical efficacy and safety studies with ELIQUIS; therefore, the dosing 
recommendations are based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (anti -Factor Xa 
activity) data in subjects with ESRD maintained on dialysis.  
Warfarin : While patients are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], warfarin will be dosed daily, with daily INR 
monitoring per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23155].  Daily doses may vary from 0.5mg to 15mg by [CONTACT_1966], as determined by [CONTACT_157326], hepatic function, INR, 
concomitant medications, diet, or other factors. Based on these factors or others not listed, there may also be days in which the patient is  prescribed to not get does not 
receive a dose of warfarin.  
After discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], warfarin dosing will be subsequently managed by [CONTACT_157327], per established protocols.  All patients will have a goal INR of 2- [ADDRESS_182149] 30 days.  The 
patient’s physician may determine that anticoagulation therapy should be continued after the study period, based on their examination of the patient at the 30- day post -operative 
exami nation.  
Warfarin  should not be used if a patient has active pathological bleeding.  
If a dose of warfarin  is not taken at the scheduled time, the dose should be taken as soon 
as possible on the same day and then continue with daily administration as before , or as 
recommended by [CONTACT_157312].  The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.   
Warfarin  can be taken with or without food, but it is recommended to maintain a 
consistent intake of vitamin K containing foods .

6.3 Safety Assessments  
1) Major bleeding , as defined by [CONTACT_157331]:  
a. Fatal bleeding, and/or  
b. Symptomatic bleeding that occurs in a critical area or organ, such as 
intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], intraocular, retroperitoneal, pericardial, in a non- operated 
joint, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome, assessed in consultation with 
the surgeon, and/or  
c. Extrasurgical site bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 20 g/L (2g/dL) 
or more, or leading to transfusion of two or more units of whole blood or red cells 
within 24- 48 hours of the bleeding and/or  
d. Surgical site bleeding that requ ires a second intervention – open, arthroscopic, 
endovascular - or a hemarthrosis of sufficient size as to interfere with 
rehabilitation by [CONTACT_157332], resulting in prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] a deep wound infection, and/or  
e. Unexpected surgical site bleeding, prolonged and/or sufficiently large to cause 
hemodynamic instability, as assessed by [CONTACT_11065], with a fall in hemoglobin of 
at least 20 g/L (2g/dL) or transfusion of two or more units of whole blood or red cells within 24 hours of the bleeding.

2) Clinical relevant non -major bleed , defined as any notable bleeding not classified as 
major . 
3) Pregnancy tests will be performed pre- operatively on the day of surgery  for all 
WOCBP, via urine hCG screening.   
4) A ba seline renal function panel will be obtained either pre -operatively or within 30 
days of surgery.  The renal function panel includes: glucose, BUN, creatinine, BUN/creatinine ratio, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, 
albumin, and anion gap.  
31 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_157258]   
14 June  2014  5) The hepatic function test panel will be ordered before initiating warfarin (if a recent 
baseline is not available).  This panel includes:  total protein, albumin, alk phos, AST, 
ALT, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and indirect bilirubin.   
6) INR will be checked before surgery to ensure the patient’s INR is within normal limits in preparation for their surgery, regardless of whether they were previously on warfarin, and again upon initiation of warfarin therapy.  INR will be checked dail y in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
and at each visit to the anticoagulation clinic.  These visits are usually scheduled within three days of discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], then twice weekly until the INR is therapeutic, then weekly for the duration of the study.  
6.4 Study Asses sments   
6.4.1  Primary Assessment  
The primary assessment is freedom from s ystemic thromboembolism or stroke: t his will 
be as diagnosed by a physician, to include pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, 
and both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke.   Events relating to thromboembolism or 
stroke will be adjudicated using pre -determined definitions by [CONTACT_157333]’s treatment arm.   
6.4.2   Secondary  Assessments 
1) Units of blood or blood products given after the  first dose o f anticoagulation. 
2) Total post -operative length of stay: This  will be measured from the date/time of the 
end of the subject’s surgery until the date/time of the patient’s discharge from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  This will be measured in hours, to the nearest tenth of an hour.  
3) Duration from diagnosis of post -operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) to discharge from 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: This will be measured from the time of the EKG that is obtained after AFib is noted on telemetry  (confirm ing the diagnosis of AFib) , until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  This 
will be measured in hours, to the nearest tenth of an hour.  
4) Time in therapeutic range of INR, if on warfarin, (eg. 2- 3), measured as a percentage 
and defined for each patient using the Rosendaal equation 
5) Patient compliance percentage to api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]:  measured by [CONTACT_157334] 30- day post -operative appointment, where remaining 
tablets will be counted.  This will be calculated as a percentage using the following 
32 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_157258]   
14 June  2014  equation: (# doses prescri bed - # of doses not taken and returned to investigator at follow 
up appointment) / # days prescribed.  
7 ADVERSE EVENTS 
An Adverse Event [AE] is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence 
or worsening of a pre- existing medical condition in a patient or c linical 
investigation subject administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.  
 
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should 
be used to assess all adverse events (AEs). The causal relationship can be one of the following:  
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and the AE.  
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study 
drug administration and the AE.  
 
The term “reasonable causal relationship” means there is evidence to suggest 
a causal relationship.  
 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open- ended 
questioning, examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent 
reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific 
occurrence of one or more adverse events).  
 
7.1 Serious Adverse Events  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence at any 
dose that:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see NOTE *: below for exceptions)  
33 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_157258]   
14 June  2014  • results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is an important medical event, defined as a medical event that may not  be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based 
on appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above. Examples of such events 
include but are not limited to intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Suspected transmission of an i nfectious agent (eg, pathogenic or non-
pathogenic) via the study drug is an SAE.  
Although pregnancy, overdose, and cancer are not always serious by [CONTACT_157335], these events must be handled as SAEs.  
*NOTE:  The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]:  
− A visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34235] 24  hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an 
“important medical event” or a life- threatening event)  
− Elective surgery planned before signing c onsent  
− Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
− Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of 
health status (eg, routine colonoscopy)  
− Medical/surgical admission other than remedying ill health state that 
was planned before study entry. Appropriate documentation is required in 
these cases  
− Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no 
bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic i nadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family 
circumstances, administrative reason)  
−  
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
 
In this study, the following adverse events are to be reported to BMS, regardless 
of whether these reports are classified as serious or unexpect ed. 
 
- Potential or suspected cases of liver injury including but not limited to liver test abnormalities, jaundice, hepatitis or cholestasis.  
 
[ADDRESS_182156]’s written consent to participate in the stu dy, all SAEs, 
whether related or not related to study drug, must be collected, including those 
thought to be associated with protocol -specified procedures. All SAEs must be 
collected that occur during the screening period and within [ADDRESS_182157] be collected that relate to any 
later protocol -specific procedure (such as follow -up skin biopsy).  
The investigator should report any SAE occurring after these time periods that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol -specified procedure.  
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its status of seriousness.  
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is 
potentially related to the conditions of t he study (such as withdrawal of previous 
therapy, or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.  
SAEs, whether related or unrelated to the study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS within [ADDRESS_182158] be recorded on the FDA MedWatch 
Form 3500A ; Pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  
SAE Email Address: [EMAIL_176]  
SAE Fax Number: 609 -818-3804  
If only limited information is initially available , follow -up reports are required. 
(Note: Follow -up SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) 
initially reported.)  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 
hours to the BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting 
the initial SAE report.  
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
 
35 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_157258]   
14 June  2014  7.1.2  SAE Reconciliation  
The investigator will reconcile the c linical database SAE cases transmitted to 
BMS Global Pharmacovigilance (GPV&E). Reconciliation will occur every three 
months and once just prior to database lock/Final Study Report (FSR).  The investigator will request a safety data reconciliation report t o 
[EMAIL_177] .  BMS GPV&E will e -mail upon request from the 
investigator, the GPV&E reconciliation report. The data elements listed on the GPV&E safety data reconciliation report will be used for case identification 
purposes. If the investigator determines a case was not transmitted to BMS GPV&E, the case will be sent immediately.  
 
7.1.3  Health Authority Reporting (US FDA IND)  
Investigators must adhere to local Health Authority Reporting Requirements . For 
studies conducted under an investigator sponsored US FDA IND, provide details 
of the following:  
 
- Any event that is both serious and unexpected must be reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as soon as possible and no later than 7 days (fo r a death or life- threatening event) or 15 days (for all other 
SAEs) after the investigator’s or institution’s initial receipt of the information.

7.2 Non-Serious Events  
A non -serious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.  
7.2.1  Non-Serious Adverse Events (NSAEs) Collecting and 
Reporting 
The collection of non- serious adverse event (NSAE) information should begin at 
initiation of study drug. Non- serious adverse event information should also be 
collected from the start of a placebo lead- in period or other observational period 
intended to establish a baseline status for the s ubjects.  
Non-serious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as 
SAEs if they become serious. Follow -up is also required for non- serious AEs that 
cause interruption or discontinuation of study drug, or those that are present at 
the end of study treatment as appropriate.  
Non-serious Adverse Events are provided to BMS via annual safety reports (if 
applicable), and interim or final study reports.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_182160] Abnormalities  
The following laboratory abnormalities should be capture d and reported as 
appropriate:  
- Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition 
of an SAE  
- Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to have study drug discontinued or interrupted  
- Any laboratory test r esult abnormality that required the subject to receive 
specific corrective therapy.

Api[INVESTIGATOR_157258]   
14 June  2014  It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than the laboratory term 
will be used by [CONTACT_9673] (eg, use the term anemia rather than 
low hem oglobin value).  
Laboratory test abnormalities are provided to BMS via annual safety reports (if 
applicable), and interim or final study reports.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_182161] will be permanently 
discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for subject 
safety).  
The investigator must immediately notify [EMAIL_179] of this 
event via the Pregnancy Surveillance Form within [ADDRESS_182162] unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (eg, x -ray 
studies). Other appropriate pregnancy follow -up procedures should be 
considered if indicated.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_182163] be reported as SAEs.

7.6 Other Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiograms, x -rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether 
or not these procedures are required by [CONTACT_760], should also be recorded as a non- serious or serious adverse event, as appropriate, and reported 
accordingly.

Not Applicable.  
 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
9.1 Sample Size Determination  
For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we anticipate 300 patients will be eligible for inclusion over the 28-month study period (estimate two patient enrollments per month) .  With an expected 
POAF rate of 25% , and a 5% exclusion rate, we expect [ADDRESS_182164] -operative atrial fibrillation after undergoing isolated CABG 
that require anticoagulation and meet inclusion/exc lusion criteria will be asked to 
participate in this study .   
 
9.3 Analyses 
Continuous variables will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median with 
interquartile range (IQR) as appropriate. Continuous variables will be compared using t -
39 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_157258]   
14 June  2014  tests for par ametric data or Wilcoxon analysis for nonparametric data.   We will complete 
the analysis in an intent -to-treat manner.  We will include analysis for confidence 
intervals and other appropriate statistical tests to assess binary outcomes.  We realize that 
statistical tests alone will be of limited value as this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].   Data will be 
analyzed using JMP software, version 12.0.0 (Cary, NC). All statistics collected will be 
analyzed after completion of the 30- day trial period for all subjects.  
[ADDRESS_182165] be discussed with, BMS. The investigator should not implement any 
deviation or change to the protocol without prior  review and documented  
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_5698]/IEC of an amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects.  
If a deviation or change to a protocol is implemented to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) prior to obtaining IRB/IEC approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], as soon as possible the deviation 
or change will be submitted to: 
• IRB/IEC for review and approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] 
• Bristol- Myers Squibb  
• Regulatory Authority(ies), if required by [CONTACT_157336](s)/IEC(s) 
must be sent to BMS. 
If an amendment substantially alters the study design or increases the potential risk to the 
subject: (1) the consent form must be revised and submitted to the IRB(s)/IEC(s) for 
review and approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]; (2) the revised form must be used to obtain consent from subjects currently enrolled in the study if they are affected by [CONTACT_29991]; and (3) the new form must be used to obtain consent from new  subjects prior 
to enrollment.  
Patients who need to be reconsented can be reconsented over the phone if they are unable to do so at the clinic. The coordinator will send an updated consent form to the patient via mail or electronically. When the patient has the consent, the coordinator will review the 
consent with the patient over the phone. Any questions can be answered by [CONTACT_157337]. The patient will then send the original signed 
40 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_157258]   
14 June  2014  consent back to the coordinator. The coor dinator who conducted the phone consent will 
sign and date the applicable line and upload to the patient’s chart. The coordinator must 
also document the consent discussion and receipt of the consent in the patient’s EMR. 
If the revision is an administrativ e letter, investigators must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).  
For complete information on the requirements for protocols, protocol amendments, 
and informed consents, refer to 21CFR50. 
10.[ADDRESS_182166] retain all study r ecords  and source documents for the maximum 
period required by [CONTACT_8666], or institution procedures, or for 
the period specified by [CONTACT_20444] , whichever is longer.  
If the investigator withdraws from the study (eg, relocation, retirem ent), the records shall 
be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (eg, another investigator, IRB). Notice 
of such transfer will be given in writing to BMS.  
10.2.[ADDRESS_182167] (those supplied by [CONTACT_157338])  is maintained at each study site 
where study drug and noninvestigational product(s) is/are inventoried and dispensed.  
Records or logs must comply with applicable regulations and guidelines and should include:  
• amount rec eived and placed in storage area  
• amount currently in storage area  
• label ID number or batch number  
• amount dispensed to and returned by [CONTACT_6992], including unique subject 
identifiers  
• amount transferred to another area/site for dispensing or storage  
• non-study disposition (eg, lost, wasted)  
• amount destroyed at study site, if applicable  
• amount returned to the BMS  
• retain samples for bioavailability/bioequivalence, if applicable  
• dates and initials of person responsible for Investigational Product (IP) dispe nsing/accountability, as per the Delegation of Authority Form.  
[ADDRESS_182168]  
If the study drugs are to be destroyed on site, it is the investigator’s responsibility to 
ensure that arrangements have been made for disposal, and that  procedures for proper 
disposal have been established according to applicable regulations, guidelines, and 
institutional procedures. Appropriate records of the disposal must be maintained.  
[ADDRESS_182169]  
Expedited Safety Report  Rapid notification to investigators of all SAEs that are suspected (related to the investigational product) and unexpected  (ie, not previously described in the 
Investigator Brochure), or that could be associated with the study procedures.

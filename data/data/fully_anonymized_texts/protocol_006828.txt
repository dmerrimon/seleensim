INVESTIGATOR -INITIATED STUDY PROPOSAL  
 
A Prospective Evaluation of Tissue Sealant to Prevent Epi[INVESTIGATOR_34178]® Sealant at preventing epi[INVESTIGATOR_34179] -lift.

Introduction  
 It is well-known that a small percentage of patients will have epi[INVESTIGATOR_34180] a correlated factor.
1 The effects of that ingrowth ca n be glare and 
halos ; ingrowth is a significant cause of dissatisfaction after LASIK.2 The incidence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_34181] -lift for treatment of residual refractive error.3 It has been 
hypothesized that cell migration into the flap/cornea interface postoperatively is a primary reason for 
such ingrowth.[ADDRESS_33570] some utility in preventing epi[INVESTIGATOR_34182] -lift. 
 
The following investigator -initiated study proposal is designed to determine if a lower -than -typi[INVESTIGATOR_34183] a LASIK flap re-lift is performed and the replaced flap is sealed with 
ReSure sealant.  
 
Study specific aims:  Tissue sealant has been effectively used to prevent recurrence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_34184].  The aim of the study is to see if tissue sealant can be used to prevent epi[INVESTIGATOR_34185].  This would allow for patients to undergo LASIK flap 
lift surgery with g reater safety.  
 
Unpublished data:  There is no unpublished data on the prophylactic use of tissue sealant to prevent the 
occurrence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_34186].  It has been used successfully to prevent recurrence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_34187].  
 Study design  and data analysis  
 The study will be designed as a single-arm prospective trial involving 25 eyes (of up to 25 subjects) who are presenting for LASIK retreatment.   Sample size was calculated based on a nominal historical 
population rate of 25% ingrowth after re -lift, and an expected rate with ReSure of 5%, using an alpha of 
0.05 and a power of 0.8; with these parameters a sample of [ADDRESS_33571] operative visits .  The primary endpoint will be 
presence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_34188] 1 and  3 months after the retreatment.  

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Document Date: September  20, [ADDRESS_33572] may be excluded from the analysis and replaced with 
an alternate. The data for that patient will be retained and the affected patient will be followed to 
monitor for adverse events, but their outcomes data would not be included in any aggregate analysis. At 
each vi sit subjects will be monitored for adverse events, whether related to the protocol regimen or not.  
 
Significance:  Late flap lift enhancements are associated with a higher rate of epi[INVESTIGATOR_34189].  Many surgeons have stopped performing late flap lift LASIK enhancements and 
switched to PRK to avoid this complication.  PRK over previous LASIK is associated with a prolonged 
visual recovery and short term ocular discomfort.  If the tissue sealant is effective at preventing  or 
lowering the rate of epi[INVESTIGATOR_34186], then late LASIK flap lift treatments could be offered with greater safety.  This would benefit patients.

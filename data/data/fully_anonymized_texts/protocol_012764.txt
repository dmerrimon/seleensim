PROTOCOL NUMBER  CNTX -4975i -OA-303 
DEVELOPMENT PHASE  Phase 3  
PROTOCOL TITLE  An Open -label, 8 -Week Study to Compare the Comfort an d Ease of Use  of Five 
Different  Treatment Regimens for CNTX 4975- 05 Intra -articular Injection in Subjects 
with Chronic, Moderate- to-Severe Osteoarthritis Knee Pain  
INDICATION Knee pain due to osteoarthritis (OA)  
OBJECTIVES  The objectives of this study in subjects with moderate- to-severe pain due to knee OA 
are as follows:  
Primary Efficacy Objective:  
To determine the optimal procedure s for admini stering CNTX 4975- 05 as a single  intra-
articular  (IA) injection into knee(s) with OA, balancing  comfort and ease of use of 
methods of cooling and administration . 
Secondary Efficacy Objectives:  
• To describe the clinical benefit of CNTX -4975- 05 treatment at Week 8 in  a 
single knee with OA  
• To describe the clinical benefit at Week 8 of treating bilateral knee OA with a  
single  injection to each knee  
• To describe the clinical benefit at Week 8 of treating a single knee with OA in 
subjects with partial or total joint replacement (PJR/TJR) in the  contralateral 
knee  
• To evaluate subject  satisfaction  (SS) with the  overall benefit  of 
CNTX -4975- 05 
• To evaluate SS  with IA CNTX -4975- 05 relative to SS with contralateral knee 
PJR or TJR  
• To evaluate subject and investigator  satisfaction  (IS) with different treatment 
regimens  
• To evaluate the responders to treatment through 8 weeks  
Exploratory Efficacy Objectives:  
• To explore the l ikelihood of the need for joint replacement surgery, based on 
clinical benefit and the subject ’s assessment of their improvement at Week 8  
• To explore t he effect of subject  characteristics (including Kellgren -Lawrence  
[K-L] grade, sex, body mass index [ BMI ], age, u nilateral versus b ilateral knee 
OA, unilateral v ersus  bilateral injections , and history of  contralateral PJR  or 
TJR) on the clinical benefit  of IA CNTX- 4975- 05 at each study visit through 
Week  8 
• To explore changes in the frequency of use of background analgesic 
medication for pain in the injected knee(s) throughout the study period

•To further evaluate  the safety of a single  IA injection of 
CNTX -4975- 05 to one  or both knees  in subjects with chronic moderate to
severe unilateral or bilateral knee OA pain
STUDY DESIGN This is an open -label,  single injection  (per knee) , 8-week study  to evaluate the comfort 
and ease of use of [ADDRESS_660932] controlled  joint cooling  and secondarily by [CONTACT_094]-medication with IA 
lidocaine . 
Types of Subjects: 
The study population will contain 3 types of subjects, with a  targeted minimum of 
150 subjects of each type: 
1.Subjects with unilateral or bilateral OA of the knee, with one knee (the index
knee) with moderate to severe pain ( K-L grade 1 -4) and the other knee (the
contralateral knee) with no to mild pain.  These subjects will recei ve an
injection  of CNTX -4975- 05 into the index knee only.
2.Subjects with bilateral OA of the knees, with both knees having moderate to
severe pain ( K-L grade 1 -4, with wors e pain being the index knee).  These
subjects will receive an injection  of CNTX -4975- 05 into each knee ([ADDRESS_660933] painful knee [index knee] first, then the following week, the
contralateral knee).
3.Subjects who have unilateral or bilateral OA of the knee, with one knee with
moderate to severe pain ( the index knee [K -L grades 1 -4]) and previous  PJR or
TJR in the other knee ( the contralateral knee). These subjects will receive an
injection of CNTX -4975- 05 into the index knee only.
All s ubjects will receive  CNTX -4975- 05 injected into the index knee ; 
subjects with bilateral OA will receive an injection in to both knees  (injections will be 
separated by 1 week) . Subjects will be followed for 8 weeks.  
Pre-Medication: 
Prior to the injection procedure, t he investigator  may, at his or her discretion, pre -
medicate subjects with an oral dose of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_161128]- steroidal anti -inflammatory 
drug ( NSAID ). The skin at the point of the anticipated  injection (s) may also be 
infiltrated with 1  to 2 mL of lidocaine  and/o r a topic al analgesic such as ethyl chloride 
spray. It is recommended not to use more than 2 methods of local analgesia about the 
knee (s) to be injected . 
Injection of CNTX -4975- 05: 
ALL subjects are required to be administered an IA injection of a full 15 mL of 
lidocaine  (w
ithout epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) ( 1% or 2% , depending on the assigned treatment  
regimen) to ensure: 1) the lo cal targeted concentration of CNTX -4975 in the joint; 
2)distension of the joint capsule to improve access of CNTX -4975 to the joint space;
and 3) to provide some analgesia . The full 15 mL of lidocaine (without epi[INVESTIGATOR_238])
and the full [ADDRESS_660934] on pain, but the concentration and dispersion of CNTX -4975
into the joint are the primary reasons for lidocaine use.

identified within the needle hub before injection of 2% lidocaine (without epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) and CNTX -4975- 05. After injection of CNTX -4975, t he knee joint will be passively 
flexed and extended [ADDRESS_660936] 30 minutes (or longer, as 
required by [CONTACT_760]) after study drug injection to ensure that they do not have a hypersensitivity reaction/anaphylaxis.    
The duration of cooling and the knee pain upon discontinuation of  cooling must be 
entered into the electronic case report form [eCRF]. If cooling must be reapplied, the time and knee pain level must be  recorded in the eCRF, and timing of subsequent pain 
assessments should be on the standard time lines in the eCRF.  
Each site will be randomly assigned 1  of the following 5 treatment regimens to be 
employed for ALL subjects at that site :

and the contralateral knee having none to mild pain, OR  
b) unilateral or bilateral OA , with the index knee having moderate to  severe pain 
and the other knee having had a P JR or TJR within 5 years of the Screening 
Visit. The knee with the PJR/TJR is not to be injected with CNTX -4975- 05. 
For subjects for bilateral kn ee injection, the index knee must have m oderate to 
severe pain (≥5 and ≤9) at screening  associated with OA , and greater pain in the 
index knee  than in the contralateral knee. Their pain  must be stable for a minimum

designated the index knee.  
For qualifying knee pain with walking, subjects will use a n NPRS (0 -10; 0=no 
pain, 10=worst possible pain) to rate their knee pain with walking (both knees, 
except knees with PJR/TJR). The PJR/TJR pain should be rated using the NPRS 
scale, but will not be a qualifying pain score.  
5. Body mass index  ≤45 kg/m

severe OA knee pain, who have not had joint replacement and who qualify  to have 
bilateral IA injections of CNTX -4975- 05, will receive an injection in both knees 
(injections will be separated by 1 week) . 
PLANNED STUDY SITES  No more than 45  concurrent study sites in the US, [LOCATION_013], Spain and the United 
Kingdom .  
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION  Primary efficacy endpoint:  
The primary endpoint  is assessment of the CNTX -4975- [ADDRESS_660955] , using a combination of 3 assessment s of 
the index knee : 1) pain 30 minutes after CNTX -4975- 05 injection  (using the 0-4 scale 
of none, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe) ; 2) subject satisfaction  with the 
treatment regimen (SS) ; and 3) investigator satisfaction with the treatment regimen (IS).  
Secondary efficacy endpoints:  
• Assessment of the primary combined outcome using the contralateral knee for 
the subjects who received bilateral injections and the index knee for all other 
subjects  
• Assessment of the primary combined outcome for each subject type 
• Assessment of the primary combined outcome, using the contralateral knee for 
the subjects who received bilateral injections  
• Percent of Outcome Measures in Rheumatology -Osteoarthritis Research 
Society International ( OMERACT -OARSI ) responders at Week 8 for subjects 
with a single CNTX -4975- 05 joint injection (index knee, moderate -to-severe 
pain; index knee, pain not >3 for contralateral  knee)  
• Percent of OMERACT -OARSI responders at Week 8 for subjects with 
bilateral knee injections  of CNTX -4975- 05 (index knee, moderate- to-severe 
pain index knee ; both knees meeting OMERACT -OARSI responder criteria)  
• Percent of OMERACT -OARSI responders at Week 8 for subjects with a single 
CNTX -4975- 05 joint in jection ( population with index knee, moderate -to-
severe pain index  knee ; non-index knee with PJR/ TJR)  
• For each of the 3 types of subjects, the absolute change; the number of subjects 
who have ≥ 30%, ≥50%, ≥70%, or ≥90% improvement area under the curve; 
and landmark analysis  on the  5 subscales of the KOOS  through Week 8  using 
the average of both knees : 
o Pain

• Assess the SS of treatment with CNTX -4975- 05 IA injection for each of the 
3 types  of subjects, and all subjects in the trial  
• For subjects with a PJR/ TJR, assess the ir satisfaction with the CNTX -4975- 05 
IA injection versus their  satisfaction with their PJR/TJR  
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints:  
Exploratory  efficacy endpoints include:  
• Likelihood of the need for joint replacement surgery, based on KOOS 
subscales and SS outcomes, from Baseline through Week 8  
• Subject satisfaction with the treatment of the index knee through Week  8 of the 
trial (7 -point Likert S cale where 1=completely dissatisfied and  7=completely 
satisfied)  
• The effect of subject characteristics (including K- L grade, sex, BMI, age, 
unilateral/b ilateral knee OA , bilateral knee OA treatment , and history of  
contralateral PJR/TJR ) on the analgesic efficacy of CNTX -4975- 05, using the 
KOOS subscales at each study visit through Week 8 
• Frequency of use of background analgesic medication for pain in the injected  
knee (s) throughout the study period.  
• Assessment of the  mean of the individual  outcome measure s, using the average 
of both knees for the subjects who received bilateral knee injections  
Safety endpoints:  
• Adverse event s 
• Vital signs  
• Clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis)  
• 12-lead ECG s 
• Physical examination (including the  presence or absence of an effusion in the 
index knee, periarticular pain/tenderness)  
• Concomitant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
• Degree of procedure pain (not recorded as AEs)  
• Local physical findings after injection of the index knee  
• Injection site assessment of erythema and edema   
• Sensory testing  
STATISTICAL METHODS  The primary analysis will compare each experimental treatment regimen to the Breg Cooling Control Group using an equally -weighted, combined score calculated from the 
following 3 measures: 1) pain 30 minutes after CN TX-4975- 05 injection (using the 0- 4 
scale of none, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe), 2) SS with the treatment 
regimen; and 3) IS with the treatment regimen, all assessed on the index knee. Ratios of the mean values of test/control will have 95% confidence intervals constructed for each treatment regimen versus the Breg Cooling Control G roup. For a treatment regimen to 
be considered clinically acceptable, it must be no more than 30% worse than the Breg 
Cooling Control Group and the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the 
treatment regimen must be greater than 0.7. This analysis  will be performed on the ITT 
population.

[CONTACT_10621] 3 scores for a composite score. A sensitivity analysis will be performed that creates a composite score using the original scales (with the pain scores  still 
reverse- scored to ensure the direction of the effect remains the same), using the ITT 
population.  
All other continuous secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoint s will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_511031], experimental injection procedure,  and 
week/visit, as appropriate, and analyzed using a mixed -model repeated measures 
analysis or by [CONTACT_144406], as appropriate. Categorical endpoints will be 
compared between treatments using Pearson’s chi -square or Fisher’s exact test, as 
appropriate.  
Safety analyses will be conducted using data from the safety population.    
SAMPLE SIZE 
DETERMINATION  Approximately 850 subjects will receive CNTX -4975- 05 in an open -label manner. This 
sample size was chosen based on the need to fulfill safety requirements for regulatory review .  
STUDY AND 
TREATMENT 
DURATION The overall study duration is expected to be  13 months, with 10 months of active 
enrollment  and about 3 months for screening and treatment follow -up. The sequence 
and maximum duration of the study periods will be as follows:  
• Screening Period up to 15 days.  
• Treatment Period (open -label): 1 day  per knee treated, maximum 2 days

13-Jun-2019 Amendment 2 Version : 3.[ADDRESS_660959] is discontinuing the study before Week 8, the assessments listed for the Week 8/ ET Visit should be completed.  
e. A pre -screening radiograph of both knees must show evidence of chronic OA with a K -L grade of [ADDRESS_660960] has radiographs from Centrexion study CNTX -4975i -OA-301 or CNTX -4975i -OA-304, those radiographs and K -L grading should 
be used for this study.  
f. Medical history and d emographics, as outlined in the eCRF s. OA medications should note all therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including doses and regimen when known, and all 
should note if the medications were over the counter or prescriptions. Treatments to be recorded include non- invasive treatmen ts (e.g., physical therapy) and 
previous invasive treatments (e .g., arthrotomy, arthroscopy – with procedure, if known) . 
g. A complete physical examination (excluding a genitourinary examination) will be performed by [CONTACT_511032] g Visit and at the final clinic 
visit (Week 8/ ET). A partial physical examination will be performed by [CONTACT_511033]) . The physical examinations will also evaluate 
the soft tissue of the index knee for periarticular painful sites, which will be entered onto the c ase report form.  
h. To be performed before injection of CNTX -4975- 05.   
i. Clinical laboratory tests will include chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis. Additional tests, including fibrinogen and prothrombin time/partial 
thromboplastin time, will be done at Screening only. Hemoglobin A1c  will be done at the Screening and Week 8/ ET Visits . Subjects are to fast prior to the 
laboratory sample collections performed at the Screening Visit. If the subject is receiving a second knee injection (in the contralateral knee), labs are not required to be repeated if the injection is within 30 day s of the  screening lab draw  (at the investigator’ s discretion ). 
j. Urine drug screen must be confirmed as negative for drugs of abuse prior to treatment . For subj ects being treated bilaterally, a Urine Drug Screen is not 
required prior to the second injection.  
k. Subjects will be tested for pregnancy if they are women of childbearing potential. A serum pregnancy test will be performed i f the urine pregnancy test is 
positive. Subjects with positive urine pregnancy test results will not be enrolled or will be discontinued from study participation. These subjects will be 
followed until the pregnancy is completed, and the health of the infant  is known.  
l. Vital signs are to be performed standing and sitting within approximately 5 minutes before the injection of IP, and sitting- only vital signs within approximately 
5, 15, and 30 minutes  minutes after the injection of IP.  
m. Each site is to  follow the ir assigned, protocol -specified treatment  regimen  and the protocol -specified CNTX -4975- 05 administration procedures . 
n. The injection site will be examined and assessed for erythema and edema by [CONTACT_8786] (using a categorical 4- point scale of none, mild, moderate, or 
severe [0 -3]) on Study Day 1 (Treatment) before injection, after the injection at [ADDRESS_660961] -dose, and at the Week 4 V isit. For bilateral knee 
injections, injection site examination s will be performed  before  and after each injection . Significant bruising or ot her clinically significant injection site 
reactions will be recorded as AEs.  
o. Procedure pain will be assessed by [CONTACT_511034] (1) at rest prior to pre- medication; (2) prior to IA  lidocaine (without 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]); (3) at rest  10 minutes (± 2 minutes) after IA  lidocaine (without epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]); (4) at 30 minutes (±  5 minutes) after IA  injection of 
CNTX -4975- 05; and (5) at rest at the 1 -hour and 2 -hour time points after IA  injection of CNTX- 4975- 05 (± 10 minutes).  
p. Immediately prior to leaving the clinic, the subject will be asked h ow satisfied they were with the treatment procedure at that visit, using a 7- point Likert 
Scale where 1=c ompletely dissatisfied and 7 =completely satisfied. Subjects with a PJR/TJR will also compare their satisfaction with PJR/TJR  versus the 
CNTX -4975- [ADDRESS_660962]’s study treatment (at V2 and V4 if applicable)  and the treatment procedure (at V7) . 
s. The investigator will judge the l ikelihood of the need for joint replacement surgery, based on KOOS subscales and subject satisfaction outcomes . The subject 
will judge the likelihood of the desire for joint rep lacement surgery, based on their personal response to treatment with CNTX -4975- 05. 
t. Collection of AEs will begin from the time of signing the informed consent form through the Week 8/ ET Visit. On Day 1, the AE assessment must be 
performed pre -dose. Treatment -emergent AEs will be collected from the time of the injection of CNTX -4975- 05 through the Week 8/ ET Visit. Potentially

5.2 Summary of Potential Risks and Benefits  
The potential benefits of study participation are that subjects with painful OA of the knee 1)  may 
experience a reduction in acute and chronic, moderate- to-sever e pain as a result of treatment with 
CNTX-4975-05, and 2) will understand that they are contributing to the scientific knowledge that 
may lead to expansion of the treatment options for subjects with OA. No other benefits of 
participation are anticipated.  
The potential risks of study participation include those associated with exposure to CNTX -4975-05 
and the risks of medical evaluation, including venipuncture  and IA injection . Subjects will be 
injected with 1% or 2% lidocaine (without epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) to provide distension of the joint capsule 
for access to the whole joint for CNTX -4975- [ADDRESS_660976] the index joint to overuse and an acceleration of the knee OA . 
A summary of the pharmaceutical properties and known potential risks of CNTX -4975 is provided 
in the current version of the investigator’s brochure ( IB).

procedure pain, knee pain with walking, and the use of rescue medication (for bilateral knee 
injections, calls will occur 3 days after each injection) . Subjects will return to the clinic at Weeks  4 
and 8 for study assessments.   
Efficacy will be assessed on the  OA index knee  (and contralateral knee in bilateral knee injection 
subjects)  using a numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) ; the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome 
Score (KOOS ), which includes subscales for pain, other symptoms, activities of daily living, sports 
and recreation, and quality of life (QOL) ; a joint replacement questionnaire ; a subject satisfaction 
questionnaire ; an investigator satisfaction questionnaire ; and rescue medication use. P ain with 
walking will also be collected and assessed for the contralateral  knee. 
For subjects with bilateral knee injections, the contralateral knee will be assessed using the same scales as the index knee, and the effect of bilateral knee injections will be combined as a composite score to examine the overall benefit.  The index knee in these subjects is the one with worse pain 
with walking. Where both knees have equal pain with walking, then the knee on the subject’s dominant side will be designated the index knee. 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_511026] s (erythema and edema), assessment of 
procedure pain, AEs, physical examination findings, vital sign measurements, 12-l ead 
electrocardiograms (ECG s), clinical laboratory test results , and sensory testing. 
7.2 Discussion of Study Design  
This open label  study, CNTX-4975i- OA-303, is an 8-w eek study to e valuate the efficacy  and 
safety  of a single  IA injection  (per knee, as applicable)  of CNTX-4975-[ADDRESS_660979] and appropriate. 
7.3 Study Site(s)  
The study will take place at no more than [ADDRESS_660980] low enrollment.

13-Jun-2019 Amendment 2 Version : 3.[ADDRESS_660981] POPULATION   
8.1 Selection of Study Population 
Based on  the mechanism of action and use of trans -capsaicin for the treatment of pain, there are 
no gender -specific adverse effects known or to be expected. Thus, male and female subjects wi ll 
be included in the study. A screening log of potential study candidates and/or an enrollment log of 
enrolled subjects must be maintained at each study site.  
8.[ADDRESS_660982] meets all of the following criteria:  
1. Male or female subjects between 40 and 95 years of age (inclusive).  
2. Confirmation of OA of the knee: radiography of both knees using standard standing films 
(scored by [CONTACT_093]) or using the fixed flexion method, taken during the S creening 
Visit (prior radiographs of the knees of sufficient quality that have been taken within 2 years of the S creening Visit may be used for K-L grading). The index knee must show evidence of 
chronic OA with a K-L grade of 1, 2, 3 or 4. Subjects who were screen failures for the US 
CNTX-4975i- OA-301 or CNTX-4975i- OA-304 trials may be cons idered for this trial if the 
K-L grade of the index knee is 1 -4, inclusive. 
3. Confirmation of OA of the index knee: American College of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic criteria (ACR confirmation of bilateral knee OA for subjects who will have bilateral knee in jections of CNTX-4975-05). 
4. For subjects for monoarticular knee injection, the index knee must have moderate to severe pain (≥5 and ≤9) at screening associated with OA, which must be stable for a minimum of [ADDRESS_660983]:  
a) unilateral or bilateral OA, with the index knee having moderate to severe pain, and the contralateral knee having none to mild pain, OR 
b) unilateral or bilateral OA, with the index knee having moderate to severe pain and the other knee having had a PJR or TJR within 5 years of the Screening Visit. The knee with the PJR/TJR is not to be injected with CNTX -4975-05. 
For subjects for bilateral knee injection, the index knee must have moderate to severe pain (≥5 and ≤9) at scre ening associated with OA, and greater pain in the index knee than in the 
contralateral knee. Their pain must be stable for a minimum of [ADDRESS_660984]’s dominant side will be designated the index knee. 
For qualifying knee pain with walking, subjects will use an NPRS (0 -10; 0=no pain, 
10=worst possible pain) to rate their knee pain with walking (both knees, except knees with 
PJR/TJR). The PJR/TJR pain should be rated using the NPRS scale, but will not be a qualifying pain score.

Subjects may take another analgesic as  rescue medication  for pain of the index knee as needed . 
The rescue medication is not allowed to be in the same drug class as the ongoing  background 
medication. For example, subjects will not be allowed to take tramadol as a rescue medication if 
they are already taking an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], or an NSAID as rescue if they are already taking  an NSAID. 
Data on the type of rescue and background medication, and the daily dose , will be reported daily 
by [CONTACT_155697] a paper diary . Additional rescue medication details will be collected at study 
visits and follow-up telephone calls in the source documents and eCRF. 
Subjects should not take rescue medication for knee osteoarthritis pain, or for other pain, within 
24 hours prior to a clinic visit.  
Other analgesics may be taken for occasional pain, but should not be taken within 24 hours of a 
clinic visit; these are to be recorded as concomitant medications, not as rescue or background medication for knee osteoarthritis.

10.2 Study Duration  
10.2.1 Overall Study Schedule  
The overall study duration is expected to be 13 months, with 10 months of active enrollment  and 
about 3 months for screening and treatment follow -up. 
The planned sequence and maximum duration of the study periods will be as follows: 
1. Screening Period: up to 15 days  
2. Treatment Period (open -label): [ADDRESS_661012]- treatment Period: [ADDRESS_661013] is approximately 10 weeks.  
10.3 Assessments  
10.3.1 Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS] Average Walking OA Knee Pain (NPRS) 
At each visit, subjects will assess their a verage daily index knee pain with walking during the 
previous 24 hours . Average daily OA knee pain with walking will be evaluated using a 0- 10 NPRS 
(0=no pain and 10=worst possible pain). Subjects will rate each knee separately . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Knee  Injury and Osteoarthri tis Outcome Score (KOOS)  
The KOOS was developed as an extension of the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index with the purpose 
of evaluating short -term and long- term symptoms and function in subjects with knee injury and 
OA. The KOOS holds 5 separately scored subscales: pain, other symptoms, function in daily 
Centrexion Therapeutics Corp.  Confidential

13-Jun-2019 Amendment 2 Version : 3.[ADDRESS_661014] 
for the subscale QOL followed by [CONTACT_511036]. The KOOS is a valid, reliable , and responsive 
self-administered instrument that can be used for short -term and long -term follow -up of several 
types of knee injury, including OA.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Joint Replacement Questionnaire  
The investigator will judge the likelihood of the need for joint replacement surgery, based on 
KOOS subscales and subject satisfaction outcomes.  
The subject will judge the likelihood of the desire for joint replacement surgery, based on their personal response to treatment with CNTX-4975-05. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Subjec t Satisfaction Questionnaire 
Subjects will be asked to rate their overall satisfaction  with the treatment procedure. S ubjects with 
a PJR/TJR will also compare their satisfaction with their PJR/TJR versus their CNTX -4975-05 
treatment. These will be rated us ing the following 7 -point scale:  
 1 – Completely dissatisfied  
 2 – Mostly dissatisfied  
 3 – Somewhat dissatisfied   4 – Neither satisfied or dissatisfied   5 – Somewhat satisfied   6 – Mostly satisfied  
 7 – Completely satisfied  
Subjects will also be asked whether they would undergo the study treatment again. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Investigator Satisfaction Questionnaire 
The investigator will rate his or her satisfaction with the subject’s study treatment.  
The investigator will rate his or her satisfaction with the treatment procedure. [IP_ADDRESS] Rescue Medication Use  
Subjects may take rescue medication for pain of the index knee as described in Section 9.12.1, 
except that they should not use rescue medication within [ADDRESS_661015] on a paper diary  from S creening through Week 8/ET. 
Additional rescue medication details will be collected at study visits and follow -up telephone calls 
in the source documents and in the eCRF.

clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the product, whether or not related to the product. 
Pre-existing diseases or conditions will not be considered AEs unless there is an increase in the 
frequency or severity, or a change in the quality of the disease or condition (worsening of a pre-existing condition is considered an AE). 
Events occurring in subjects treated with placebo or active comparator or during treatment- free 
periods of the study are also considered AEs. 
11.1.[ADDRESS_661022]. 
An unexpected adverse event (UAE) is one for which the specificity or severity is not consistent 
with the current IB. For example, hepatic  necrosis would be unexpected (greater severity) if the 
IB only listed elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Likewise, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (greater specificity) if the IB only listed cerebral vascular accidents.  
Furthermore, reports that add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already documented adverse reaction constitute unexpected events. Examples would be (a) acute renal failure as an expected adverse reaction with a subsequent  new occurrence of interstitial nephritis 
(interstitial nephritis would be unexpected) and (b) hepatitis with a first occurrence of fulminant hepatitis (fulminant hepatitis would be unexpected).

• is a congenital anomaly  
NOTE: A congenital anomaly in an infant born to a mother  who was exposed to the IP 
during pregnancy is  an SAE. However, a newly diagnosed pregnancy in a subject that has 
received an IP is not considered an SAE unless it is suspected that the IP(s) interacted with 
a contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy.

may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_510979].  
11.1.4 Significant Adverse Events

Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one  of the following 3 criteria  are fulfilled: 
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, 
or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips- tongue -uvula), AND AT LEAST 
ONE OF THE FOLLOWING : 
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) 
b. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end- organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence) 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for that 
patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen lips -tongue-
uvula) 
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) 
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) 
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours) : 
a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic BP ∗ 
b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person's baseline

• “How are you feeling?”  
• “Have you experienced any issues since your last visit?”  
• “Have you taken any new medications since your last vi sit?” 
Any clinically relevant observations made during the visit will also be considered AEs . 
11.2.3 Evaluation 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Adverse Events  
The clinical severity of an AE will be classified as  
Mild  Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of 
daily living.  
Moderate  Usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event 
interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing disc omfort but poses no 
significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.  
Severe  Interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, 
or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 
It is important to distinguish betw een severe AEs and SAEs. Severity is a classification of intensity , 
whereas an SAE is an AE that meets serious criteria, as described in Section  11.1.3.

related to the subject’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for each such AE. Although “fatal” is usually an event outcome, events such as sudden death or unexplained death should be reported as SAEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Relationship to Investigational Product 
The investigator must make an assessment of each AE’s relationship to the IP. The categories for classifying the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_256333]. 
Not related  An AE with sufficient evidence to accept that there is no causal relationship 
to IP administration (e .g., no temporal relationship to drug administration, 
because the drug was administered after onset of event; investigation shows that the drug was not administered; another cause was proven). 
Unlikely 
related  An AE, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to 
IP administration that makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, events or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.

13.4.3 Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy variables will be summarized and analyzed using the ITT population, unless otherwise specified.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analysis 
The primary analysis will compare each experimental treatment regimen to the Breg Cooling Control Group using an equally -weighted, co mbined score calculated from the following 3 
measures: 1) pain  30 minutes after CNTX -4975- 05 injection ( using the 0 -4 scale of none, mild, 
moderate, moderately severe, and severe) , 2) SS with the treatment regimen; and 3) IS with the 
treatment regimen , all assessed on the index knee. Ratios of the mean values of test/control will 
have 95% confidence intervals constructed for each treatment regimen  versus the Breg Cooling 
Control Group. For a treatment regimen  to be considered clinically acceptable, it must be no more 
than 30% worse than the Breg Cooling Control Group and the lower limit o f the 95% confidence 
interval for the treatment regimen must be  greater than 0.7. This analysis will be performed on the 
ITT population.  
For analysis, satisfaction scores ( SS and IS) and [ADDRESS_661039] the 3 components on 
the same scale before they are combined by [CONTACT_10621] 3 scores for a composite score. A 
sensitivity analysis will be performed that creates a composite score using the original scales (with 
the pain scores still reverse- scored to ensure the direction of the effect remains the same), using 
the ITT population.  
All other continuous secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoint s will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_511031], experimental treatment regimen,  and week/visit, as 
appropriate, and analyzed using a  mixed -model repeated measures  (MMRM) analysis or by 
[CONTACT_144406], as appropriate. Categorical endpoints will be compared between treatments 
using Pearson’s chi- square or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.

Appendix A  
Definitions : 
Anaphyla ctic Reaction  
Is a rapid onse t serious allergic  reaction  that has a variety of symptoms, and outcomes, 
which can include death. An anaphylactic reaction  typi[INVESTIGATOR_510983]. Anaphylaxis  causes more than one of the following: low 
blood pressure, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, an itchy rash, throat or tongue 
swelling, and vomiting .  
 
Anaphylactoid reaction 
These reactions produce the same clinical signs and symptoms anaphyla ctic reactions, but 
are not IgE mediated, but instead occur through a direct non- immune -mediated release of 
mediators from basophils and/or mast cells or can manifest  from direct complement 
activation.  
 
Clinical Criteria for  Diagnosing Anaphylaxis

Typi[INVESTIGATOR_510984] , as crash carts will differ on medical vs . surgical 
facilities, or across hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], and certainly across countries. The key to an adequate crash 
cart are  solutions and drapes for sterility, methods to deliver IV fluids, vasopressor agents, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (adrenaline), cardiac arrythmia treatments, vacutainers  (for tryptase: e.g. 6 
mL dark blue -top [trace element, no additive]) , cardiac defibrillator and means of 
maintaining an  airway ( oxygen valve bag mask , endotracheal tubes ; oxygen available ): 
below is the  ACLS partial  list

an endotr acheal tube, stylets , bite block, tongue depressors 
• V Start Kit  (or similar CPR kit) , angio -catheters 14 Ga and/or 16 Ga, 
disinfectants ( chloraprep , Betadine, povidone -iodine), Luer lock syringes of 
various sizes, tourniquet tubing, Insyte autoguards  of various sizes, Vacutainers  
• ECG electrodes , sterile  gloves of various sizes , sutures of various sizes and

• ECG / cardiac defibrillator  
 
Guidelines for treatment of Anaphylaxis 
As all sites  must have ACLS or equivalent training,  and appropriate equipment, this 
overview of  treatment is  at a high level.  
• Rapid assessment and maintenance of airway, breathing and circulation  
• Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (adrenaline)  0.01mg/kg – 0.5 mg maximum dose  intramuscularly every 
5-15 minutes, as needed.  
• High flow ox ygen through endotracheal tube or rebreather mask for  respi[INVESTIGATOR_510986]  
o Inhaled beta -2 agonists (e.g. albuterol) for bronchospasm  
• With signs of hypoperfusion, position subject in a recumbent position with legs 
elevated, except for  when there is vomiting or shortness of breadth  
• Subjects hypotensive despi[INVESTIGATOR_510987] 
• If epi[INVESTIGATOR_510988], then vasopressors can be implemented ( e.g. noradrenaline  
[noradrenaline] , vasopressin)  
• Observation  for a period of time must occur as  a return of signs and symptoms 
may recur as epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (adrenaline) blood concentrations decrease, or the 
subject has a biphasic reaction.

There is no universal agreement on the deﬁnition of anaphylaxis
or the criteria for diagnosis. In July 2005, the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Disease and Food Allergy andAnaphylaxis Network convened a second meeting on
anaphylaxis, which included representatives from [ADDRESS_661055] appropriate managementof anaphylaxis, and outline the research needs in this area.(J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006;117:391-7.)
Key words: Anaphylaxis, IgE mediated hypersensitivity, anaphylac
toid, epi[INVESTIGATOR_510989] ﬁrst described around
[ADDRESS_661056] alarming disorders
encountered in medicine, there is no universal agreement
on its deﬁnition or criteria for diagnosis. Furthermore, this
lack of speciﬁc criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis hasgreatly hampered research into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], patho
physiology, and management of this disorder; led to
confusion on the part of ﬁrst responders, emergencypersonnel, primary care physicians, and patients; and
resulted in a failure to diagnose and treat anaphylaxis in a
consistent manner.

In an attempt to resolve these problems, the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and
the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN)
convened a meeting in April 2004 to address thesedeﬁciencies.

Recently, the Joint Task Force of the American

and management of anaphylaxis.
5In this report the Task
Force deﬁned anaphylaxis as ‘‘as a condition caused by

‘‘are often life threatening and almost always unantici
pated.’’ The purpose of the practice parameter was toprovide ‘‘the practicing physician with an evidence basedapproach to the diagnosis and management of anaphy

convened a second meeting, which included representatives from the previous organizations and the European
Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, the Aus

to begin the process of facilitating an international agree
ment. The purpose of this second NIAID/FAAN Symposium was to continue working toward a universally
accepted deﬁnition of anaphylaxis, establish clinical crit
eria that would accurately identify cases of anaphylaxiswith high precision, further review the evidence on themost appropriate management of anaphylaxis, and outline
the research needs in this area.
DEFINITION OF ANAPHYLAXIS AND
CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSIS
Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially fatal, systemic
allergic reaction that occurs suddenly after contact [CONTACT_511052]. Participants at the symposium agreed that a brief, broad deﬁnition of anaphylaxis
that reﬂected its course and potential severity would be
most useful to both the medical and lay community andrecommended the following: ‘‘Anaphylaxis is a serious
allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death.’’
To identify individuals experiencing such a reaction,
criteria proposed at the ﬁrst symposium were revised,
4as
outlined in Table I . Participants at the second symposium
agreed that the diagnostic criteria must provide theemergency responder or treating physician with a rela
tively simple and rapid means to make the diagnosis ofanaphylaxis. It was acknowledged that no criteria will
provide 100% sensitivity and speciﬁcity, but it was be
lieved that the criteria proposed are likely to capturemore than 95% of cases of anaphylaxis. Because the ma
jority of anaphylactic reactions include skin symptoms,
5-10
which are noted in more than 80% of cases when care
fully assessed, it was judged that at least 80% of anaphy
lactic reactions should be identiﬁed by [CONTACT_511053] 1, even
when the allergic status of the patient and potential causeof the reaction might be unknown. However, cutaneoussymptoms might be absent in up to 20% of anaphylactic
reactions in children with food allergy or insect sting al
lergy.
11-13Consequently, in patients with a known allergic
history and possible exposure, criterion [ADDRESS_661057] been associated
with severe outcomes in various anaphylactic reactions.
9
Finally, criterion 3 should identify the rare patients who
experience an acute hypotensive epi[INVESTIGATOR_510991] a known allergen, as described by [CONTACT_511054].
14Although participants believed that these cri
teria should accurately identify anaphylactic reactions in
more than 95% of cases, it was agreed that these criteria
need to be subjected to a prospective multicenter clinical
survey to establish their utility and determine whetherthere is need for further reﬁnement.
MANAGEMENT OF ANAPHYLAXIS
As with the treatment of any critically ill patient, the
treatment of anaphylaxis begins with a rapid assessmentand maintenance of airway, breathing, and circulation.
When a patient fulﬁlls any of the 3 criteria of anaphylaxis
outlined above, the patient should receive epi[INVESTIGATOR_510992]. There undoubtedly will be
patients who present with symptoms not yet fulﬁllingthe criteria of anaphylaxis yet in whom it would beappropriate to initiate therapy with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], such as a
patient with a history of near fatal anaphylaxis to peanut
who ingested peanut and within minutes is experiencingurticaria and generalized ﬂushing. Subsequent interven
tions are determined on the basis of the clinical course and
response to epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. In general, participants at theSecond NIAID/FAAN Anaphylaxis Symposium support
the therapeutic approach outlined in recently published
guidelines.
5A summary of these guidelines is provided
below, along with a more detailed discussion of the recommended route of parenteral epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], positioning
during treatment of anaphylaxis, and suggested observa
tion periods after treatment of an anaphylactic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].

0.5 mg) administered intramuscularly every 5 to 15 minutes
as necessary, is the recommended dosage for controllingsymptoms and maintaining blood pressure.

livery because the dose can be titrated to the desired effectand can avoid the potential for accidental administration oflarge boluses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].
Oxygen and adrenergic agonists
High ﬂow oxygen (through a nonrebreather mask or
endotracheal tube) should be administered to patients ex
periencing respi[INVESTIGATOR_511003]. Those who
are hemodynamically unstable might beneﬁt from oxygenas well. Inhaled b
2agonists, such as albuterol, might be
useful
for bronchospasm refractory to epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].5
Positioning of the patient
Patients in anaphylactic shock (ie, those with anaphy
laxis and signs of critical organ hypoperfusion) should beplaced in a recumbent position with the lower extremities
elevated unless precluded by [CONTACT_511055]. These recommendations are based on evidencethat passive leg raise can increase stroke volume and
cardiac output by [CONTACT_511056] ﬂuid centrally in patients in
shock.
21Furthermore, observations of victims of fatal
anaphylactic shock suggest that postural changes, such as
moving to a more upright position or being prevented
from taking a supi[INVESTIGATOR_429896], might have contributed tothe fatal outcome.
[ADDRESS_661059] aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation. Large volumesTABLE I. Clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulﬁlled:
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or
ﬂushing, swollen lips tongue uvula)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWINGa. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia)
b. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a
likely allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):
a. Involvement of the skin mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch ﬂush, swollen lips tongue uvula)
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia)
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):
a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age speciﬁc) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic BP *
b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person’s baseline
PEF, Peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_696] ﬂow; BP, blood pressure.
*Low systolic blood pressure for children is deﬁned as less than 70 mm Hg from 1 month to 1 year, less than (70 mm Hg 1[23age]) from [ADDRESS_661060] 5 to 10 minutes;
in severe reactions with hypotension, up to 35% of the
blood volume might extravasate in the ﬁrst [ADDRESS_661061] be tailored to the
clinical situation; persistent hypotension requires a more
aggressive approach with multiple ﬂuid boluses (10 20
mL/kg under pressure), including colloid, as well as crystalloid, whereas a largely respi[INVESTIGATOR_511004] ﬂuid management.
Vasopressors
Potent vasopressors, such as noradrenaline, vasopres
sin, or metaraminol, might be required to overcome
vasodilatation if epi[INVESTIGATOR_13027] ﬂuid resuscitation havefailed to maintain a systolic blood pressure of greater than90 mm Hg.
20Recent case reports and animal studies have
demonstrated that vasopressin is useful when treatinghemorrhagic and septic shock. The effect of vasopressinon systemic anaphylaxis has not been investigated, except
in clinical case reports. Vasopressin increases blood pres
sure because of vasoconstriction through the V1 receptor.
24
H1- and H 2-antihistamines
Antihistamines (H 1and H 2antagonists) are slower in
onset
of action than epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], have little effect on blood
pressure, and should be considered a second line treatment for anaphylaxis. Antihistamines are useful for the
symptomatic treatment of urticaria angioedema and pru
ritus. Diphenhydramine, administered intravenously orintramuscularly (or orally for mild symptoms), can begiven at 25 to 50 mg for adults and 1 mg/kg (up to 50
mg) for children. Treatment with a combination of H
[ADDRESS_661062]
over
another.
Corticosteroids
The effectiveness of corticosteroids in anaphylaxis has
never been determined in placebo controlled trials.
However, their usefulness in other allergic diseases hasled to their incorporation into anaphylaxis management.Because the onset of action is slow, steroids are not useful
in the acute management stage. It has been suggested thattheir use might prevent a protracted or biphasic reaction,
although there is no evidence to prove this.
11,27If given,
the dosing of intravenous corticosteroids should be equiv
alent to 1.0 to 2.0 mg/kg per dose of methylprednisolone
every 6 hours. Oral administration of prednisone, 1.0
mg/kg, up to 50 mg might be sufﬁcient for milder attacks.
Glucagon for persistent hypotension in
patients taking b-blockers
Although there are no epi[INVESTIGATOR_511005], there are multiple reported cases of
increased severity or treatment refractory anaphylaxis inthese patients.
28Theoretically, there are multiple mecha
nisms by [CONTACT_511057][INVESTIGATOR_238]. If administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_511006], administration of glucagon can be
attempted. Glucagon is thought to reverse refractory hypo
tension and bronchospasm by [CONTACT_511058]; however, the occurrence
and importance of this mechanism of action in anaphylaxis is unproved. The recommended dosage for glucagonis 1 to 5 mg (20 30 mg/kg [maximum dose, 1 mg] in
children) administered intravenously over 5 minutes and
followed by [CONTACT_288449] (5 15 mg/min) titrated to clinical
response. Airway protection must be ensured because
glucagon frequently causes emesis.
Observation
After the treatment of an anaphylactic reaction, an
observation period should be considered for all patientsbecause the reaction might recur as the effect of epi[INVESTIGATOR_511007] (intramuscular epi[INVESTIGATOR_511008]) and because ofthe risk of a biphasic reaction. The occurrence of biphasic
reactions has been established in the literature and appears
to occur in 1% to 20% of anaphylactic reactions (asdepi[INVESTIGATOR_511009] ).
8,11,27,29-34In a study evaluating
patients with fatal or near fatal food reactions, approxi
mately 20% of patients experienced a biphasic reaction,
indicating that biphasic reactions might be more likelyin patients who present initially with severe symptoms.

Generally, the same organ systems are involved in the
initial and secondary reaction. However, in the study
by [CONTACT_511059],83 patients with initially stable vital signs
returned with abnormal vital signs (2 with hypotensionand 1 with dyspnea and decreased oxygen saturation).
On the basis of the evidence to date, the participants
attending the NIAID/FAAN Symposium recommendedthat observation periods be individualized on the basis
of the severity of the initial reaction, reliability of the
patient, and access to care. A reasonable length of timeto consider observing the postanaphylactic patient is [ADDRESS_661064] experienced anaphylaxis from ex
posures that might be encountered in nonmedical settings

versally accepted deﬁnition of anaphylaxis. Therefore the
clinical criteria suggested above might be helpful in deter
mining who should be prescribed self injectable epi[INVESTIGATOR_511012]. Until there are universally accepted criteria for thediagnosis of anaphylaxis, the indications for the prescription of self injectable epi[INVESTIGATOR_511013]. Currently, there is a consensus that patients
experiencing respi[INVESTIGATOR_511014] a known allergen in the community should
receive self injectable epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. Beyond this consen
sus, it is unclear who should be given a prescription forself injectable epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. However, limiting prescrip
tions of self injectable epi[INVESTIGATOR_511015], for example,would fail to cover up to 80% of patients experiencing a
fatal anaphylactic reaction.

epi[INVESTIGATOR_511017],
36and the ethical dilemmas have been discussed
by [CONTACT_53408].37
Before discharge from an emergency facility, all
patients experiencing an anaphylactic reaction should
receive information about how to avoid the precipi[INVESTIGATOR_511018] (if known). Other issues to consider includealerting patients about national organizations providingimportant information and educational materials (eg, theFood Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, www.foodallergy.
org), as well as being advised to obtain prompt follow up
with an allergist and notify their primary care physician.
At present, these 3 steps (ie, self injectable epi[INVESTIGATOR_511019], patient education, and follow up evaluation)are infrequently performed in North American emergency
departments.
38,39Because emergency departments are the
treatment setting for most anaphylaxis visits,1this repre
sents an important and as yet untapped opportunity toimprove patient care.
RESEARCH NEEDS
The investigation of anaphylaxis has been impeded
by [CONTACT_511060]ﬁrm
the clinical impression. This in turn has thwarted effortsto ascertain the incidence and outcome of anaphylaxis in
various populations, to determine the most effective forms
of therapy, to identify patients at risk for life threateninganaphylaxis, and to elucidate the basic immunologic andpathogenic mechanisms responsible for the variable
course of anaphylaxis in different individuals. A multi
center prospective study of the diagnostic criteria proposed herein is needed to determine whether they allow
the clinician and investigator to identify accurately pa
tients with anaphylaxis regardless of cause. Assuming thatthese criteria prove to be adequately sensitive and speciﬁc
for diagnosing anaphylaxis, studies determining the inci
dence, cause, clinical features, natural course, and outcome of anaphylaxis are needed to provide the clinician
with evidence based features of this disorder that will
enable more effective prevention and therapeutic interventions. Clinical trials can be facilitated by [CONTACT_511061].
It was believed that the measurement of certain mast
cell derived mediators, such as histamine and tryptase,would provide conﬁrmatory evidence of an anaphylactic
reaction. However, in a series of 97 patients presenting to
an emergency department and given diagnoses of anaphylaxis, only 42% were found to have increased plasma
histamine levels, and 21% were determined to have
increased plasma tryptase levels.
26One small study dem
onstrated that serial estimations of plasma tryptase levelsmight improve sensitivity (36% to 73%).
40Sensitive and
speciﬁc biomarkers of anaphylaxis and evolving anaphylaxis are needed that will establish the presence of thedisorder when sufﬁcient historical information is not
available or symptoms are atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]. New proteomic ap
proaches, metabolomic approaches, or both might proveuseful in identifying relevant biomarkers. Biomarker
assays could be useful to conﬁrm the diagnosis when in
doubt, which can have important follow up implications.If available at the bedside, they could even assist in the
identiﬁcation of patients at risk of persistent or delayed
phase reactions. However, given the emergency and fulminant nature of this disease, such approaches are unlikelyto be useful for guiding immediate resuscitativeJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL

sibly basophils. However, this mechanism alone does notexplain the severity of the allergic manifestations, the var
iability in target organ responses among individuals or
within the same individual, the differences in thresholddoses of allergen necessary to provoke anaphylactic responses, the variable responses to therapy, the induction
of biphasic or protracted anaphylactic reactions, or the
eventual outcome of the reaction. A recent study suggested that the diversity of IgE allergenic epi[INVESTIGATOR_511020] a role in the severity of allergic
responses,
41but this represents a fraction of the potential
variables occurring between the time an allergen enters
the body and the end result of an anaphylactic reaction.
For example, it might be informative to perform genomicand functional studies of polymorphisms or gain of function mutations in various mediator, cytokine, and chemo
kine receptors; the Kit receptor; elements of intracellular
signaling pathways; or other factors that might inﬂuenceeither the activation or function of the effector cells of
anaphylaxis or the responses of the structural cells in the
target organs affected in this disorder.
In addition, investigation is required into the patho
physiologic mechanisms and appropriate treatment ofreactions fulﬁlling the diagnostic criteria listed foranaphylaxis but that do not involve an IgE mediated
mechanism, commonly referred to as anaphylactoid or
pseudoallergic reactions . Furthermore, studies have sug
gested a role for the nervous system in eliciting the full
symptom complex of anaphylaxis,
42and this is an area
that warrants further investigation. Well characterized animal models would clearly facilitate efforts to understandthe basic pathophysiology occurring during anaphylaxis;
to determine the interactions between various cell types;
to elucidate effects of mediators, cytokines, and chemokines released during an anaphylactic response; and to
delineate better therapeutic strategies. Recently, animal
models that appear reﬂective of anaphylaxis in humansubjects have been established in mice,
43dogs,44and
pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107],45but better models are needed.
During the NIAID/FAAN Symposium and in the
recently published practice parameter on anaphylaxis,5
therapeutic strategies for the management of anaphylaxis
were suggested largely on the basis of ‘‘clinical experi
ence.’’ In fact, there is a major need to evaluate the mostappropriate therapeutic measures and medications for
the treatment of anaphylaxis. Although virtually all au
thorities agree that epi[INVESTIGATOR_511021], there are limited data
on the appropriate dose, timing, route, or frequency of
administration. H
1a n dH 2antihistamines, corticosteroids,
or
both are commonly used in the treatment of anaphy
laxis, but there are virtually no data demonstrating theirfunctional role or effectiveness. Prospective controlledtrials to establish the appropriate dosing of these medications and the role of other therapeutic interventions, such
as the optimal type and rate of ﬂuid replacement, and
the use of vasopressors, glucagon, nebulized albuterol orepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], leukotriene inhibitors, and cytokine antago
nists (eg, anti TNF) also are warranted. Ideally, therapeutic
measures could be studied in appropriate animal models before initiating clinical trials. Before any clinical studies,
clinically useful severity scoring and outcome measure
ment tools need to be validated.
There is also a need for outcomes research in well
characterized patients. Little information is available
on the beneﬁts and risks of providing epi[INVESTIGATOR_511022], antihistamines, corticosteroids, and writtenmedical instructions to patients with food and insect
venom allergy and their caregivers (eg, parents and school,
day care, and restaurant personnel) and ﬁrst line emergency personnel. Studies of long term sequelae, adher
ence to follow up referral, subsequent reactions, and
quality of life in patients experiencing anaphylactic reactions also are lacking. As outcome data are becomingavailable, evaluation of the most effective means of
disseminating information about the prevention and
management of anaphylaxis to patients, primary carephysicians, ﬁrst responders, and emergency department
personnel should help alleviate the tremendous disparities
in therapeutic approaches seen in the [LOCATION_002] andaround the world.
A number of studies from around the world suggest that
anaphylactic reactions commonly occur both inside andout of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84365].
46,47In light of the general
increase in IgE dependent allergic disorders in the developed world over the past several decades, there is an urgentneed to understand better the basic immunology and pathophysiology of anaphylaxis and to optimize therapy on
the basis of well controlled clinical trials. In addition, the
characterization of clinical features and discovery of biomarkers that would identify patients at risk for anaphylaxis
or for biphasic or prolonged severe reactions would greatly
enhance the care of these patients, decrease patient andfamily anxieties, and reduce the risk of unfavorable out
comes. The universal acceptance of speciﬁc clinical crite
ria to identify anaphylaxis, as proposed here, will facilitateand expedite research in this critical area.

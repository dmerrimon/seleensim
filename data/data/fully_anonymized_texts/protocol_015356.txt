1. Abstract  
a. Provide no more than a one page research abstract briefly stating the problem, the 
research hypothesis, and th e importance of the research.  
 
 African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_574487]1, advanced2 and progressive3 
chronic kidney disease  (CKD); including a 3 to 4 -fold greater risk of end -stage renal disease (ESRD) and 
earlier onset of ESRD4 when compared to whites. Racial disparities in CKD are most profound among 
persons of low socioeconomic status (SES)5-7, and dietary factors (limited availability of healthy foods and 
unhealthy dietary patter ns) likely underlie much of this disparity. Low SES AAs are more likely to 
experience food insecurity (the inability to afford nutritionally adequate and safe foods)8 and live in “food 
deserts” 9, which likely contributes to racial differences in dietary patterns .  AAs with hypertension, a 
leading cause of CKD in the U.S., are less  likely to follow a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension 
(DASH) trial accordant diet than are whites10, despi[INVESTIGATOR_574472]11. Further, AAs are less likely to follow diets rich in fruits and 
vegetables (base -inducing diet s)12, despi[INVESTIGATOR_574473]13,14 including reductions in markers of kidney damage (i.e. albuminu ria).15,16  
There is markedly lower availability of components of the DASH diet recommended foods, such as 
fresh fruits and vegetables, skim milk and whole grain foods, in predominantly AA and lower -income 
neighborh oods as compared with white and higher -income neighborhoods.17,18 Personally -tailored 
interventions promoting the DASH diet while addressing barriers to accessing healthful foods could 
substantially lessen the burde n of hypertension and CKD among low SES AAs.   
 We propose to build upon the encouraging results of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], “The Five -Plus Nuts and Beans 
Trial” ( Am J Prev Med , 2015) which was conducted as a partnership between Johns Hopkins investigators, 
a comm unity supermarket, the Baltimore City Health Department’s “Virtual Supermarket” program, a 
community -based clinic and a highly engaged Community Advisory Board. This trial tested the effects of a 
dietary approach to increase consumption of a central featur e of the DASH diet --high potassium foods 
(fruits, vegetables, nuts and beans). A total of 123 AA patients with controlled hypertension recruited from 
a community -based clinic, were provided personalized dietary advice, assistance with grocery ordering and 
delivery, and $30 per week worth of high potassium foods for an 8 -week period. With this approach, we 
demonstrated statistically significant increases in consumption of fruits, vegetables, potassium, magnesium 
and fiber, and decreases in sodium intake. Als o, there was a 14% reduction in urinary albumin excretion 
overall, and a 30% reduction among patients with significant albuminuria at enrollment. The trial had 100% 
follow -up on outcomes.  
Our current proposal will build on the established partnerships, ex isting infrastructure and encouraging 
results of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. We propose a longer (1 year) intervention, and the inclusion of AA participants 
with hypertension (controlled or uncontrolled) plus mild/moderate CKD —a population at very high risk of 
the ad verse effects of diets low in potassium and high in sodium.

2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)  
 
Primary Objective:  
 
1. To test the  hypothesis that delivery of nutritional advice to adopt the DASH diet and $30 per week worth 
of pot assium -rich foods, tailored to personal choices and availability in neighborhood stores of patients 
recruited from community -based clinics, will reduce urinary albumin excretion  in low SES AAs with 
hypertension and CKD.  
 
Secondary Objectives:  
1. To determine  if our intervention lowers blood pressure   
2. To conduct exploratory analyses related to the effects of the intervention on:  
a) subgroups defined by [CONTACT_547], age, diabetes status, and level of albuminuria  
b) potential mediating variables (e.g. antihypertensive medi cation type, weight changes, etc.)  
3. To pursue mobile platforms for food selections (i.e. smartphone applications)  
4. To estimate direct costs of broadly implementing the intervention and conduct a cost analysis  
5. To develop a dissemination plan with community pa rtners to ensure sustainability  
 
3. Background  (briefly describe  pre-clinical and clinical data, current experience with procedures, 
drug or device, and any other relevant information to justify the research ) 
 
[CONTACT_574509] (Pete) Miller and our study team led th e pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], the “Five -Plus Nuts and Beans” Trial which 
previously tested the impact of a community -based dietary intervention ( Am J Prev Med , 2015).  In this 
trial we tested the effectiveness of coach -directed dietary advice and assistance with weekly o nline ordering 
and purchasing of high potassium foods ($30/week) delivered by a community supermarket to a 
neighborhood library, and tested other outcomes in urban African -American adults with controlled 
hypertension. We recruited patients from an urban pr imary care clinic in Baltimore MD and implemented 
the trial in partnership with a community supermarket and the Baltimore City Health Department. Advised 
to do so by [CONTACT_512628]/community partners, participants in the control group received a printed DASH diet  
brochure along with a debit account of equivalent value to that of the intervention (DASH -Plus) group at 
the same community supermarket. We randomized 123 participants and achieved 100% follow -up.  At 
baseline, mean ( SD) age was 58.6 (9.5) years, 71% were  female, screening BP was 131.3 (14.7)/ 77.2 
(10.5) mmHg, BMI was 34.5 (8.2) kg/m2, and 28% had diabetes. Self -reported fruit and vegetable intake of 
3.5 (1.8) servings/day and estimated potassium intake of 2.7 (0.9) grams/day were well below 
recommended i ntakes.  Compared to the control group, the DASH -Plus group increased self -reported 
consumption of fruits and vegetables by a mean (95% CI) of 1.4 (0.7, 2.1) servings/day and an estimated 
intake of potassium by 0.4 (0.1, 0.7) grams/day. DASH -Plus compared to control resulted in a significant 
increase in urine potassium excretion of 19% (1, 38)% and lower urine sodium excretion -20% ( -38, -3)% 
(Figure 4). Also, there was a 14% reduction in albuminuria overall, and a 30% reduction among the subset 
of patients  with significant albuminuria at enrollment. While we were underpowered to detect a BP effect at 
8 weeks, we concluded that the Five -Plus intervention increased consumption of fruits and vegetables and 
excretion of urine potassium (an objective marker of p otassium intake), and decreased excretion of urine 
sodium (an objective marker of sodium intake).  Recognizing the needs of AAs with or at risk for CKD in 
Baltimore, and the lack of existing clinical trials of lifestyle modifications for AAs with CKD, we 
proceeded to develop an approach for AAs with both hypertension and mild/moderate CKD.  Here, we 
describe plans for this intervention.

4. Study Procedures  
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures    
(distinguish research procedu res from those that are part of routine care ). 
 
This study will be a single center, randomized controlled trial with [ADDRESS_754062] the 
hypothesis that delivery of nutritional advice to adopt the DASH diet and $30 per week worth of 
potassium -rich foods, tailored to personal choices and availability in neighborhood stores of 
patients recruited from community -based clinics, will reduce urinary albumin excretion in low 
SES AAs with hypertension and CKD . The primary outcomes are change in ACR as a mark er of 
kidney damage and change in systolic SP.  Secondary outcomes are other dimensions of blood 
pressure (DBP, lipid levels (total cholesterol, LDL -C, HDL -C, and triglycerides); glucose, and 
Framingham Risk Score . 
 
We anticipate enrolling 150 self-identif ied African American adults who are above the age of 21 
diagnosed with hypertension and mild/moderate CKD based on the presence of albuminuria 
[urinary albumin -to-creatinine ratio (ACR) >30 mg/g] with or without eGFR 30 -59 
ml/min/1.73m2 . Based on the resu lts of the Five -Plus pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the ACT study and the CKD 
prevalence study by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Crews et al  19, we anticipate ~25 -30% of those with hypertension will 
have albuminuria and would be eligible for participation . All 150 participants will be randomly 
assign ed to one of two groups:  1) Self-Shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_574474] (S -DASH) or 2)  
Coaching DASH diet advice group (C -DASH)  with $30/week allowance for the purchase of 
high potassium foods from a local grocer .  
 
1. Self-Shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_574475]  (S-DASH ):  
 
Phase 1  (Months 0 -4) 
The S -DASH  group will receive printed patient -centered materials  on the DASH diet and 
chronic kidney disease. Participants  will also receive $30/week allowance for the purchase 
of the foods of their choosing from a local grocer (Klei n’s ShopRite stores of Maryland).  
 
       Phase 2 ( Months 5-12) 
S-DASH  participants will be asked to continue to follow the dietary advice provided. They 
will not be provided a food allowance during this phase . 
 
2. Coaching DASH  diet advice group  (C-DASH ):  
 
 Phase 1  (Months 0 -4):  
The C-DASH  intervention  will be a patient -tailored program, delivered by a study coach  that is 
trained by a dietitian, which emphasizes key self -management behaviors – diet and self -
monitoring.  The C-DASH  intervention will consis t of a 1 -hour one -on-one session with the 
study coach at randomization.  
 
Thereafter, the study coach will meet with the participant  at 1 month  followed by [CONTACT_574488]. Fifteen minute calls with participants will be weekly . During these interactions t he study 
coach will build upon the participants’ strengths and provide positive reinforcement of the 
progress being made.

The C-DASH  group will purchase $30 worth of fruits , vegetables, nuts and beans  through the 
study coach to reach a certain goal of  potassium intake daily.   The target for purchases will be a 
goal of 17,000 mg/week of potassium in order to increase dietary intake of potassium to 4.7 
grams per day (DASH diet target) based on an estimated daily baseline intake of 2.4 g/d in this 
populat ion. ShopRite will provide free packaging of food orders and foods will be delivered for 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_574476]  (S.T.A.R.) community  center on Milton Avenue  or by 
[CONTACT_574489] .  
 
Phase 2  (Months  5-12): 
Participants will be maintained in th eir assigned group. The C-DASH  group will be advised by 
[CONTACT_574490].  
Between months  5-12, there will be calls as needed, not to exceed six phone calls during Phase 
Two with the study coach.  In addition to assessing diet and providing educational materials, the 
study coach will assist each participant in setting goals, provide advice and arrange follow -up to 
monitor progress. Customizable, literacy sensitive modules about nutriti on, including the DASH 
diet, developed by [CONTACT_574491], will be used by [CONTACT_574492].  
 
Participant Recruitment:  
 
For this trial, recruitment will be conducted at the Johns Hopkins Community Physicians Sites 
(e.g. East Ba ltimore Medical Center  or Remington ) the Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center 
(JHOC)  and the Johns Hopkins Prohealth Clinical Research Unit . We plan to implement the 
following recruitment methods in order to meet our recruitment goals:  
 
1. We will rely primari ly on clinical databases (e.g. EPIC), sorted on age and diagnosis of 
hypertension; and on African American patients with hypertension who have previously 
participated in studies that included the investigators (Five Plus Nuts and Beans Trial 
(NA_00051935) or Achieving Blood Pressure Control Together (ACT) trial (NA_00078591), 
and who indicated willingness to be contact[CONTACT_7678]. Additionally, patients under the 
direct care of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -investigators may be directly referred to the study if th ey have given 
their permission to be contact[CONTACT_38435].  
 
a. For the patients described in #[ADDRESS_754063] Baltimore Medical Campus (EBMC)  and Johns Hopkins  Remington . Once the sorted list 
has been generated, we  will ask  
Johns Hopkins  providers to review the lists and indicate if any of the ir patients  on the list 
should not be contact[CONTACT_574493]  (e.g. pa tient had a recent severe illness) . Once th e 
providers have agreed on the list, we will then contact [CONTACT_574494] .

do not return the reply card . We will contact [CONTACT_574495] i n order to ascertain their 
level of interest. Our study coordinator, Jasmine Mensah, will be the primary contact. For 
those persons who express interest, we will then schedule the eligibility visit.  
 
4. During the eligibility visit, participants will be appro ached by a study team member 
(Jasmine Mensah) in the privacy of an exam room at the patients’ clinic, regarding their 
interest in participation in the study.  
 
            Study Design  (Refer to Table 1  and Table 2  as reference s):  
 
Screening Visits : The s tudy visits will begin with two initial screening visits after recruitment to 
determine the eligibility and commitment to the research study. During the first two screening 
visits, the study research team will determine if the interested participant is eli gible to participate in 
the study (see Inclusion/Exclusion criteria). The research team will proceed with discussing the 
protocol, and obtain consent for  access to contact [CONTACT_3031],  blood pressure measurements, 
medication and medical history review, obt aining weight measurements, review eating habits,  
collection of spot urine samples, and blood samples.    
 
Once the informed consent has been obtained, the following tests and procedures will be done:  
 review the informed consent form  
 ask to provide medica tion and medical history  
 dietary assessment  (review eating and other habits )  
 ask to provide contact [CONTACT_3031]  
 ask to provide demographic information  
 collect weight measurements  
 measure blood pressure  
 collect spot (random) urine samples:  
- the study team  will carefully review instructions with the participant  
- measure the albumin , urine potassium, urine sodium and u rine creatinine  
 
Randomization Visit:  Upon confirmation of eligibility and completion of a n up to two month run-
in and the informed consent pro cess, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the self-
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_574477] ( S-DASH ) or the coaching DASH (C-DASH) diet advice group 
with $[ADDRESS_754065] -protected, software set up to ensure authorized access to group 
assignment, restricted to designated study personnel. The randomization protocol will be in variable 
blocks (3 and 6) after stratification by [CONTACT_547], using the Moses -Oakfo rd algorithm, adapted for SAS 
statistical  software. The research team  will convey randomization assignment to participants.  At this 
study visit, the following will be obtained/performed:  
 medication history review  
 measure weight measurement s 
 measure blood pressure

Follow -up Visit #1  (Month “1”) : The participant will be asked to come to  a Johns Hopkins 
Community Physician Site ( e.g. East Baltimore Medical Center) or the Johns Hopkins Outpatient 
Center  for three in -person follow -up visits at 1, 4, and  12 month(s) after the randomization visit.  At 
this study visit, the following will be obtained/performed:  
 medication history review  
 dietary assessment  (review eating and other habits )  
 measure blood pressure  
 collect spot (random) urine samples:  
- The study  team will review instructions with the participant  
- measure the albumin , urine potassium, urine sodium and urine creatinine  
 collect blood samples:  
- collect 8.5 cc (less than 2 teaspoons) of blood. The study team will ask the 
participant not eat or drink a nything except water  before the blood sample is 
collected  if he/she has not done so during the first screening visit .  
- measure the creatinine, potassium, glucose , and cholesterol.  
 
 Follow -up Visit #2 (Month “ 4”): This study visit will be identical to the Month “1” study visit. 
An additional urine  sample will be collected within one month of the follow -up visit.  
 
 Follow -up Visit #3 (Month “12”): This study visit will be identical to Month  “4” study visit.  
 
 Telephone Calls: If research participants are ra ndomized to the C-DASH  group, telephone calls 
will be included throughout the intervention of the study. To monitor and improve the study 
programs, we may record some interviews and may ask experts from the study to listen to so me 
of the counseling session s. In the first 4 months (Phase 1), the C-DASH  group will have f ifteen 
minute telephone calls with a study team member  which will occur every week for the first two 
months , then bi-weekly  for two months . In months 5 -12 (Phase 2), the calls will occur every  
other week for the first 2 months, and  then on a monthly basis  for a total of no more than 6 calls .  
 
 Questionnaires : The study team will  collect questionnaire data including a 
demographic/medical history questionnaire that provides a self -report of soci odemographic 
factors ( e.g. age, gender, health insurance status, income, employment, education level , food 
insecurity ), current health status ( e.g. post-menopausal status, presence of diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease) , and health habits (e.g. tobacco use) . Medication use will be collected at  
baseline and during follow -up visits . The primary interest are medications used to treat 
hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.  
 
 Dietary Assessment:  Fruit, vegetables, fiber , sodium  and potassium intake will be assess ed at 
each visit using the Block Brief screener. The screener s are self-administered, it is used to assess 
intake over the preceding month, and estimates micronutrient intake including dietary potassium  
and sodium . 
 
 Fasting glucose, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_574478] :  Fasting blood collections will occur in the morning after 
a minimum [ADDRESS_754066]. Serum will be collected during screening visits, month 4, and month 
12.  From the fasting blood specimen, estimated GFR, glucose, total cholesterol (TC), HDL 
choles terol (HDL), triglycerides, and potassium will be measured. LDL cholesterol (LDL -C) 
will be estimated by [CONTACT_8028] (LDL=TC -HDL -triglyceride/5) 54.

group. Group B : Coaching  DASH (C-DASH) diet advice  group. The primary contrast is the difference in 
the percent chan ge in (B vs. A) in urine albumin excretion (Urine Albumin to creatinine ratio , mg/g:   
UAlb/Cr mg/g). We used the standard deviation of the percent difference in the Urine Alb/Cr (post -pre/pre) 
of 63% and 53% in the intervention arm and the control arm, re spectively. These variance estimates are 
from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (Five, Plus Nuts and Beans)  published in 2016.  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_574480] (similar to our eligibility criteria ).  Although albuminuria was not an 
eligibility criteri on, 17 of 123 randomized had albuminuria (UAlb/CR ≥30 mg/g).

Power calculations for our trial are based on a basic model that compares (4 month - baseline) differences 
among treatment groups (Table).  The tria l has 80% power to detect a treatment effect of 20% difference 
between arms at  = 0.05 if we enroll 150 participants. For this estimate, we set the correlation between 
baseline and follow -up at 80%.  This is a conservative 
estimate as the correlations of the log Alb/Cr between pre 
and post measurements in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_468757] 0.[ADDRESS_754068] size noted was a  
~39% difference (N=17) between the 2 arms in the 
subgroup with  UAlb/Cr ≥30 mg/g at baseline. In the ACT 
Trial (a second trial of blood pressure management 
strategies in African Americans with uncontrolled 
hypertension) we observed a 31% difference between arms in the subgroup of participants with UAlb/Cr 
≥30 mg/g (N=34).  Hen ce, our goal of achieving a 20% contrast is likely. As a secondary source of 
variance data we used SD of change data and sample size estimates published in 2016 (Sontrop JM et al., 
2016) derived from a population of adults with CKD and based on a SD of cha nge of 49% (less tha n what 
we observed ) 30. In that study they report that the sample size needed to detect a 20% difference in UAlb/Cr 
would be N=152 (correlation was not reported). Secondary analyses of effects on blood pressure and 
weight will be evalua ted at the nominal  = 0.[ADDRESS_754069] is (A vs. B) in Urine albumin excretion 
(Primary Specific Aims ). For secondary analyses, we will test the contr ast for reducing blood pressure, 
glucose, and weight ( Secondary Aim).   The analysis will be conducted under the intent -to-treat principle 
for both the Primary and the Secondary Aims before any s upplemental  analyses are conducted.  
 
 
For the Primary Aim , groups will be compared using within -person differences in outcome levels obtained 
on those diets.  Because we anticipate some dropouts (although there were none in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]), we will 
conduct our primary analysis using mixed effects modeling (likelihood) an d multiple imputation approach 
under the missing at random (MAR) assumption. We will adjust for baseline UAlb/Cr which should 
increase ou r power and account for any power lost by [CONTACT_210339] -outs.  We will then carefully examine all 
available data and build sensi tivity analyses using clinically sensible missing scenarios to evaluate the 
potential impact by  [CONTACT_105]-ignorable missing data. A parallel approach will be used for Secondary 
Outcomes.  Distribution of data will be checked and transformed where appropriate. Ot her outcome 
variables will be analyzed with a similar approach.  Adjustments for baseline variables will be made, where 
appropriate, in multivariable analyses. Ninety -five percent confidence intervals of the estimated mean 
differences will be constructed f or each outcome.

a. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expected frequency.  
 
         Blood Draw:  Taking blood may commonly cause discomfort, bleeding, or bruising where the needle 
enters the body.  In rare cas es, it may result in fainting. There is also a small risk of infection at the 
draw site.  
 
         Increase in Levels : Participants with diabetes  may increase th eir blood glucose levels from the 
various  fruit, grains and vegetables  consumed throughout the study. We will take measures to reduce 
the risk of this by [CONTACT_574496] (i .e. fruit juices) in the options 
for the intervention ( C-DASH ) group.  
 
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.  
In order to minimize the risks durin g the study, study personnel will provide instructions for the 
participants and answer any questions that may arise.  
 
       Severe Chronic Kidney Disease:  
         We will exclude  participants  with stage four or five CKD. During sc reening visits, we wil l measure 
urine  ACR prior to enrolling interested participants.  
 
      Uncontrolled Diabetes  
        We will exclude participants who exemplify uncontrolled diabetes . Study personnel will obtain  
medical and medication history.  
 
      Increase Potassium Levels:  
        The study team will check the chemistry panel (serum potassium) to ensure potassium levels are in 
range. We will measure potassium levels throughout the study from blood samples.  
 
c. Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviatio ns. 
 
          Risk events, problems, and deviations will be reported  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_129175].  
 
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.   
 
There is a small potential risk to confidentiality. Most partici pant related data will be stored on an 
electronic database (encrypted and secured). If members of other F ederal Agencies and IRB need to 
inspect potential trial records and documents, they will be release. Complete confidentiality cannot 
be guaranteed.  
 
e. Financial risks to the participant s. 
 
There will be no financial risks to the participants. The study will pay for groceries , tests (urine and 
blood) and allowance from Klein’s Shoprite stores of Maryland.

Ancillary Study:  Barriers and Facilitators to Healthy Eating through the Perspectives of 
Hypertensive African Americans Living in B altimore: A PhotoVoice Project  
 
13. Abstract  
 
African American  neighborhoods  are oft en characterized by [CONTACT_574497], more fast food 
outlets, poorer quality goods, longer travel distances,  less fresh produce, and higher prices for nutritious 
foods. This complex set of barriers may make it difficult for  individuals to participate in  healthy  dietary  
behaviors, while access concerns may present additional psychological burden. The goal of th is ancillary 
study is to characterize the food environment, includin g barriers and facilitators to healthy eating, through 
the lens of African American s with or at risk for chronic kidney disease  (CKD) . Findings from this 
participatory approach may be used to raise awareness among policy -makers and other stakeholders 
regar ding the lived experiences of community members, their food environments, and potential leverage 
points for facilitating healthy dietary behaviors and, subsequently, improving health outcomes among 
African Americans.  
 
14. Objectives (include all primary and se condary objectives)  
 
Objective 1:  To use  Photovoice, to characterize the food environment of the parent study target population 
through the voice of African Americans with hypertension and with or at  high risk for CKD.  
Hypothesis : Qualitative exploration of the food environment will provide important context for 
interpreting quantitative results of the parent study and the proposed ancillary study.   
Hypothesis : Visual products of the Photovoice process will provide compelling evidence to 
facilitate policy discussions among stakeholders regarding Baltimore’s food environment and 
chronic disease outcomes.  
 
15. Background  
 
Poor food environment and food insecurity among African Americans represent determinants of 
chronic disease disparities by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity. Soc ial stressors, such as food insecurity, may impact chronic 
physical and mental health outcomes, including hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], diabetes as well as 
depression and anxiety.8,9  Addressing food insecurity —the state of being without reliable access to 
sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food —may have a host of health benefits. An estimated 22.5 
percent of AA households are food insecure compared to white,  non-Hispanic households (9 percent).[ADDRESS_754078] will engage business and policy stakeholders towards a sustainable community -
based solution.

16. Study Procedures  
 
Photovoice is a community -based participatory research tool that uses ph otography to engage 
participants in reflection and dialogue regarding their community's strengths, needs, and capacity for social 
change. The use of Photovoice in formative research and community development is well documented.18 It 
is an effective tool for advancing participant voice19 and for engaging participants, policy -makers, and 
other stakeholders in discussions regarding the food environment.20-24 We will use qualitative data and 
photos obtained via Photovoice to engage multiple stakeholders in conversations regarding Baltimore’s 
food environment.  The goal will be to identify how to apply effective dietary strategies as sustainable 
popul ation health solutions . 
We will conduct a Photovoice project over the course of the study period. First, we will pi[INVESTIGATOR_574481] a willingness to be recontact[CONTACT_34754]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_574482]: 1) live in Baltimore, MD; 2) are able to manage a camera; and 
3) agree to participate in 5 group sessions over the course of t hree months (an opening session, 3 smaller 
group sessions, and a closing session). Participants will be provided free parking and meals during 
mandatory group sessions.  
After camera training, participants will cover the following over the course of [ADDRESS_754079] for documentation purposes  (Table below ): 1) How would you describe your food 
environment?; and 2) What barriers or facilitators do people in your community face regarding eating a 
healthy diet? using the SHOWED25 framework  (See Attachment  1)—What do you See here? What is 
really Happening? How does this relate to Our lives? Why does this problem or strength Exist? What can 
we Do about it?[ADDRESS_754080] at participating clinics (e.g. East Baltimore Medical Center,  Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center 
and JHCP -Remmington) who meet initial demographic —age (21 years or older), race (African 
American), and clinical criteria (hypertension) for the parent Five Plus Nuts and Beans for Kidneys 
study, but on further screening ar e found to be ineligible (e.g. urinary albumin -to-creatinine ratio  
<30mg/g). The number of participants typi[INVESTIGATOR_574483] a Photovoice project ranges from 4 to 
122 (median 13).[ADDRESS_754081]  
and who complete the initial telephone and in person screening  are expected to screen as eligible for 
the parent study, leaving the other 75 percent available for P hotovoice recruitment. We will target 
30 participants divided into six 5 -member Photovoice discussion groups.

19. Study Statistics  
This study is qualitative and does not involve statistics.  
 
Statistical Considerations: Analysis Plan:   We will perform a participatory data analysis engaging 
Photovoice participants throughout the research process.26 In this approach, participants will 
identify five photos, analyze them using the SHOWED framework  (See Attachment 1 ), and 
Photovoi ce small groups will work together to sort and categorize emerging themes from their 
photos. Investigators will further analyze participant categories into themes within and across 
groups. Using an inductive approach, all project members will collaborate t o identify themes and 
commonalties from the group discussion session transcripts and notes. Thematic patterns in 
collected data will be investigated using available qualitative data analysis software. These broader 
themes will be checked for accuracy by [CONTACT_574500][INVESTIGATOR_574484].  
Photovoice participants will be included in the dissemination of these findings in [ADDRESS_754084], the Photovoice presentation will serve as an educational tool in the community and among 
Five Plus Nuts and Beans for Kidneys participants at an event at the conclusion of the parent study 
(to avoid intervention contamination).  Secondly, the participatory research experience will include 
a sep arate exhibition of photos at the end of the Photovoice project, where participants, community 
partners, and local policymakers will be invited to participate in open discourse regarding themes 
that surfaced from the photographs.  Finally, participants wil l be asked to contribute one or more of 
their photos and captions to share on display during future stakeholder engagement events of the 
parent study and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity.

 Ancillary Study: Experiences of  Participants Who Completed the [ADDRESS_754086] briefly stating the problem, the research 
hypothesis, and the importance of the research.  
 
The main trial for this ancilla ry study tests a novel, multi -component intervention consisting of 
coach -directed dietary advice and assistance with weekly ordering and purchasing of high 
potassium foods (worth $30/week) during Phase 1. This intervention (C -DASH) is believed to 
modify ea ting behaviors that will lead to improved biomarkers of CKD. Then, during Phase 2 of 
the study, intervention supports are reduced or removed. The ability of participants to sustain the 
behavioral changes acquired in Phase 1 may be challenging. These challe nges are compounded 
when access to healthy foods is poor, a common reality among many of the study participants. 
While the C -DASH and S -DASH (control) groups may experience similar barriers and facilitators 
in adhering to the dietary recommendations,  we hy pothesize that C -DASH participants will have 
had experiences and challenges unique to the transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2. This ancillary 
study aims to elucidate the perceived barriers and facilitators of healthy eating for the study 
population as a who le, as well as the perceived effective components of the intervention, using 
qualitative research methods. Understanding these factors could identify crucial components that 
can enhance  and sustain improvements in dietary behavior and disease markers in fu ture studies.  
 
25. Objectives (include all primary and secondary  objectives)  
 
The primary objective of this ancillary study  is to identify key themes surrounding factors that 
facilit ated or imped ed participants ’ ability to adhere to the dietary guidance prese nted in the 5  
Plus Nuts and Beans for Kidneys study.  
 
The secondary objectives are:  
a. to inform and enhance the dissemination of the main study findings by [CONTACT_574502]’ perceived facilitators and impediments encountered during  the study;   
b. to identify barriers to modifying dietary behaviors that can be addressed in the design of 
future effectiveness studies; and  
c. to identify facilitators to modifying dietary behaviors that can be incorporated into the 
development of future interventions  
 
26. Background (briefly describe pre -clinical and clinical data, current experience with procedures, 
drug or device, and any other relevant information to justify the research)  
 
Adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and other similar die tary 
patterns have demonstrated kidney -related benefits. However, many African Americans with low 
socioeconomic status (SES) face barriers to healthful eating, including food insecurity (the 
inability to afford nutritionally adequate foods) and lack of hea lthy food options in neighborhood 
stores. These factors likely contribute to low SES African Americans’ greater risk of advanced 
and progressive CKD.  
 
Our research group has conducted a series of quantitative and qualitative studies regarding health 
dispar ities among low SES African Americans who have hypertension and, or were at risk for,

 CKD. Specifically, we published a qualitative study of low SES African Americans with multiple 
clinical risk factors for CKD. The themes that emerged  included multiple pe rceived barriers to 
healthful dietary changes that might reduce risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_405855]. Moreover, none of the study 
participants had prior knowledge of the DASH diet, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 53% reporting a diagnosis of 
hypertension.1 Concordant with our other findings, m ention of the DASH diet was uncommon 
(12%) during primary care visits  by [CONTACT_574503].2 Furthermore, 
only 14.5% of participants in a behavioral intervention trial of African Americans with 
uncontrolled hypertension had 5 of t he DASH food categories in their homes (fruits, vegetables, 
low fat dairy, whole grains, and plant proteins).3 Approximately 30% of this sample also had CKD 
(unpublished data).   
 
Building upon this body of work, the main study of this protocol (5  Plus Nuts  and Beans for 
Kidneys) tests an intervention that specifically addresses aspects concerning knowledge of DASH 
and food insecurity among low SES African Americans with hypertension and CKD. The first 
ancillary study of the 5  Plus Nuts and Beans for Kidneys  study  (A PhotoVoice Project) is a 
qualitative study that characterizes the food environment of the study target population and the 
results are currently being analyzed. This second proposed ancillary study will help to develop 
more effective supports in f uture interventions, as well as provide important information for the 
dissemination and sustainability of these efforts into the broader community.  
 
27. Study  Procedures  
This ancillary study is designed to elucidate the experiences of participants who complete d a 
clinical trial on the effect of the C -DASH intervention on CKD progression. The study consists of 
a one-time, [ADDRESS_754087] 25  participants (~12 from 
each study arm) will lead to thematic saturation (the point at which interview participants 
collectively begin to provid e repeated responses to interview questions)[ADDRESS_754088] known 
address on file (uploaded  to Section 13 (7)).  Research staff will briefly  describe the study 
using the recruitment telephone script (uploaded to Section 13 (7)) . If the participant is 
interested, research staff will proceed to the oral consent process.  
2. Consent process  
Research staff will read the verbal  consent script over the telephone , paraphrasing as 
needed,  and provide opportunities for the individual to ask and have questions answered.  
The oral consent script has been uploaded to Section 16 (2.0 ).  
3. Semi -structured interviews  
After obtaining verbal consent, interviews will b e scheduled and conducted over the

 telephone or computer (see below). The interview will take approximately [ADDRESS_754089] interviews using an 
interview guide to ensure consistency in data collection.  The interviewers will follow 
interview guides specific to the participants’ study arm during the 5  Plus Nuts and Beans 
for Kidneys main trial.  
 
The interview consists of primarily open -ended questions that require participants to 
elaborate beyond ‘yes/no’  responses, and allows us to explore actual participant 
perspectives in their own terms.5,6 The majority of interview questions pertain to all study 
participants, however, some of the questions are specific to and asked only of the S -DASH 
or the C -DASH par ticipants. The Interviewer’s Guides have been  uploaded to Section 20 
(2). 
4. Audio -recording procedures  
Research staff will audio -record interviews remotely through the Zoom conferencing 
platform within the Hopkins -supported SAFE desktop. Only the audio compo nent of the 
Zoom platform will be used for the interview. The research assistant will initiate the 
invitation to the participant who will then be able to connect at the scheduled time by 
[CONTACT_574504] a phone or via Zoom link on a personal computer. T he research 
assistant will begin the recording as described in the Interviewer’s Guide(s). After 
completing the interview, Zoom will encode the recording to mp4 format and the 
research assistant will store the recording on a Hopkins -supported, secured shar ed drive.

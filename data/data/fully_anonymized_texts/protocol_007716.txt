Mode(s) of Administration:
On all dosing days (excluding days 11 and 12), buprenorphine/naloxone will be administered 
sublingually under standardized fed conditions (i.e., meals will be served up to [ADDRESS_270303] 2 hours postdose) .  Water will be allowed ad libitum.  On days 11 and 12, 
buprenorphine/naloxone will be administered sublingually under fasting conditions (i.e., no food or 
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_270304] 4hours postdose) .  Water 
intake will be prohibited from at least [ADDRESS_270305] 2 hours postdose.
On day 12, ASP8062 or placebo ASP8062 will be administered orally under fasting conditions 
(i.e., no food or beverage will be allowed from at least [ADDRESS_270306] 4hours 
postdose) with approximately 240mL water.  Water intake will be prohibited from at least [ADDRESS_270307] 2 hours postdose except for the approxi mately 240mL water to swallow 
the IP.
Concomitant Treatment (Medication and Nonmedication Therapy) Restrictions or 
Requirements:
All medicinal products other than the IPs, including prescribed or nonprescribed drugs (including 
vitamins and natural and he rbal remedies, e.g., St. John’s Wort), used from first IP administration 
until the ESV will be considered concomitant medication.
Subjects will only be allowed to use the following concomitant medication(s), if needed, from first 
IP administration until th e ESV:
● Rescue medications:
○Hydroxyzine pamoate: 50 mg (1 or 2 ×tablets) every 6 hours, as needed
○Mylanta/Maalox: [ADDRESS_270308] instruction, as needed

○Clonidine: 0.1 mg, every 12 hours, as needed
● Milk of magnesia (except for days 11 and 12)
● Acetaminophen (up to 2 g/day)
● Topi[INVESTIGATOR_224750], including corticosteroid products
● Hormonal contraceptives
● HRT
If a subject’s health condition necessitates the use of any medication other than the permitted 
medications during the study, the investigator an d medical monitor, or designee(s), will discuss the 
case and determine if the subject should be withdrawn from the study and/or excluded from 
analysis sets, depending on if, and how, the medication(s) used influence(s) the study outcome.  
The nonpermitted concomitant medication will be recorded as a protocol deviation.
All concomitant treatments (medication and nonmedication therapy) will be documented.
Duration of Treatment:
Single dose of 60 mgASP8062 or placebo ASP8062 on day 12 with concomitant administration of

Version 1.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 22 INTRODUCTION
2.1 Back ground
ASP8062 is a novel compound with positive allosteric modulator (PAM) activity  on the 
γ-aminobuty ric acid ty pe B (GABA B) receptor that is intended for oral administration and is 
currentl y being developed for the treatment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) and alcohol use 
disorder (AUD).  ASP8062 is a cry stal, which is practicall y insoluble in water and slightl y 
soluble in ethanol (EtOH).   
2.1.1 Substance -use Disorders
An estimated 2.1 million Americans had an OUD in 2017 [Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration, 2018].  Overdose deaths due to opi[INVESTIGATOR_224758] [ZIP_CODE] in 2017 [Scholl et al, 2018].  National I nstitute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) data 
show that use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_224759] s yndrome [NIDA, 2019a] as well as 
the spread of infectious diseases like human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV) and hepatitis 
[NIDA, 2019b].  Medication assisted treatme nt with buprenorphine (with or without 
naloxone), methadone or naltrexone is the current standard of care, and has resulted in

[Mattick et al, 2014; Schwartz et al, 2013; Mattick et al, 2009].  However, buprenorphine can 
induce withdrawal on first administration, has an overdose potential, induces withdrawal 
symptoms and a loss of tolerance on cessation, is also subject to abuse and diversion and can 
cause respir atory  suppression.  Buprenorphine’s ceiling effect may  limit its effectiveness in 
patients with ongoing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] [Bart, 2012].
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, edition 5 (DSM -5) defines 
substance use disorders as a constellation of recurrent pathological cognitive, behavioral and 
physiological s ymptoms arising from the ongoing use of a substance.  The DSM -5 has 
combined the DSM -4 categories of substance abuse and substance dependence under the 
single heading of substance use diso rders, which is classified by  [CONTACT_224806] s ymptom criteria (out of a total of 11) that are met: mild (2 to 3 criteria), moderate 
(4 to 5 criteria) and severe (more than 6 criteria) [Hasin et al, 2013].  Different drugs produce 
different effects on the user, but important shared features include a dy sregulation of brain 
reward pathway s and an overactive brain stress s ystem, which together reinforce use of the 
substance to achieve a pleasurable high, even if pursuing this high incurs great cost or 
negative consequences for the user.
2.1.2 Background on Pharmacological Concept
Gamma -aminobut yric acid (GABA), the most abundant inhibitory  neurotransmitter, activates 
2 types of receptors: ionotropic GABA ty pe A receptors [Olsen & Sieghart, 2008] and 
metabotropic GABA Breceptors [Bowery  et al, 2002].  Studies with GABAergic drugs and 
drugs of abuse have indicated that the GABA Breceptor mediates suppression of 
craving/self -administration across several drug modalities.  Drugs triggering abuse act b y 
enhancing dopamine release in the ventral tegmental, striatal, and prefrontal cortical areas of 
the brain.  The effects of GABAergic compounds on decreasing drug self -administration and

aforementioned brain areas [Filip et al, 2015].
GABA Bagonists or PAMs have been found to attenuate opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -, alcohol -, cocaine -and 
nicotine -seeking behavior [Augier et al, 2017; Vlachou et al, 2011; Franklin et al, 2009; Filip 
& Fran kowska, 2007; Paterson et al, 2004; Di Ciano & Everitt, 2003b; Di Ciano & Everitt, 
2003a] and also attenuate the drugs of abuse -evoked changes during intracranial 
self-stimulation [Vlachou et al, 2011; Paterson et al, 2008; Slattery  et al, 2005].  However,

sedative properties of baclofen limits its potential widespread therapeuti c utility  [Dario & 
Tomei, 2004].  Accordingl y, activation of GABA Breceptors b y PAMs is one of the 
prioritized medication treatment approaches for NIDA in response to the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8562] 
[Rasmussen et al, 2019].
2.1.3 Nonclinical and Clinical Data
ASP8062 is an or ally available, new molecular entity  discovered b y Astellas Pharma Inc.  
ASP8062 is a GABA Breceptor PAM with activity in the central nervous s ystem (CNS).
ASP8062 (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg orall y) decreased self -administration of EtOH in male and 
female rats (S tudy 8062 -PH-9054).  Intragastric administration of ASP8062 (0.3, 1 and 
3mg/kg) to rhesus monkey s decreased self -administrations with morphine 
(Study 8062 -PH-9052).  In a rat conditioned place preference (CPP) study , ASP8062 (1, 3 
and 10 mg/kg orally ) dec reased cocaine -induced elevation of CPP score in a dose -related 
manner (Stud y8062 -PH-9051).  Intragastric administration of ASP8062 (0.1, 0.3 and 
1mg/kg) to rhesus monkey s significantly  decreased the mean number of self -administrations 
with cocaine in 1 of the 3 animals (Study 8062 -PH-9053).  Overall, the findings in rats and 
rhesus monkey s indicate ASP8062 has potential suppressing effects on substance use 
disorders such as alcohol, morphine and cocaine in humans.
ASP8062 did not affect the retention ti me in the rotarod test in rats up to 30 mg/kg 
(Study 8062 -PH-9035).  ASP8062 at doses of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg orally  had no sy nergistic 
effect on motor coordination when combined with EtOH at doses of 0.5, 1 and 2 g/kg orally , 
but may  have antagonistic eff ects in a mouse accelerating rotarod performance test 
(Study 8062 -PH-9038).  γ -hydroxybutyrate (GHB) at doses of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 g/kg orally  
had an additive effect with EtOH.  These results suggest that ASP8062 has no stronger 
additive interaction with Et OH compared to GHB (Study 8062 -PH-9039).
The [ADDRESS_270319] in rats

Version 1.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 2Potential ASP8062 -related toxicities, based on nonclinical studies, are described in 
[Section 2.3Risk Benefit Assessment].
Six clinical studies (5 phase 1 studies and 1 phase 2a study ) of ASP8062 have been 
completed prior to initiation of this study .  The pha se1 studies include the single ascending 
dose study  ([ADDRESS_270320]), the multiple ascending dose study  
(8062 -CL-0002, including cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_224761]), the single dose poly somnograph y 
study  (8062 -CL-0003), the sequential s ingle and multiple dose study  in Japanese subjects 
(8062 -CL-0004) and the single dose crossover study  comparing ASP8062 new tablet 
(tablet B formulation) and reference tablet (tablet A formulation , which was used previously  
in 5phase 1 studies and 1 phase 2a stud y) ([ADDRESS_270321]).  In 
addition, 20 healthy  subjects were exposed to single oral doses of ASP8062 (60 mg) together 
with a single dose of alcohol (EtOH dose: 0.6g/kg for females and 0.7 g/kg for males) in 
Study 8062 -CL-2001 ( report in progress).  All these studies were in healthy  male and/or 
female subjects.  The phase 2a study  includes an efficacy  and safet y study (8062 -CL-0101).  
This study  was in male and female fibrom yalgia (FM) patients.  The reference tablet (used in 
phase 1 and phase 2a FM studies) is referred to as “tablet A formulation” and the new tablet 
(used in OUD/AUD studies) is referred to as “tablet B formulation”.  Clinical data has been 
summarized in [Section [IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacod ynamics] and 
[Section [IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Safety].
Detailed information from nonclinical and clinical studies can be found in the [I nvestigator’s 
Brochure].
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics
In general, pharmacokinetic properties of ASP8062 1 to 30 mg administered once dail y for 
14days were simil ar to ASP8062 0.3 to 70 mg administered as single doses.  Median t max
values after multiple doses on day 14 (2 to 3 hours) were in the same range as single doses 
(1to 4hours).  Accumulation following multiple doses was predictable and was 
approximately  2to 3-fold for AUC.  Steady -state conditions were observed for all dose levels 
by [CONTACT_4475] 14.  There was no dose dependency , nor was there evidence for either auto -induction 
or auto -inhibition.  AUC for the tablet B formulation (tablets to be used in the curre nt study )
was approximately  8% to 13% higher than the tablet A formulation and C max was 
approximately  60% higher .
Suboxone® sublingual film contains buprenorphine, a partial -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2641], and naloxone, 
an opi[INVESTIGATOR_9727].  Buprenorphine is metabolized and eliminated in urine and feces.  
Norbuprenorphine is the major metabolite which has been found to bind opi[INVESTIGATOR_2646].  Naloxone undergoes metabolism as well.  Naloxone has no clinically significant effect 
when administered b y the sublingual route, although blood levels of drug were measurable.  
When Suboxone® sublingual film is administered sublingually  or buccall y, buprenorphine 
has a mean elimination half -life ranging from 24 to 42 hours and naloxone has a mean 
elimination half -life rangin g from 2 to 12 hours [Suboxone Package Insert].

whole night for single doses of [ADDRESS_270323] of ASP8062 compared to 
placebo on rapid ey e movement sleep.  With regards to pharmacod ynamics, growth hormone 
release was generally greater in the ASP8062 treatment groups and appeared to be 
dose-related.
An in vitro cy tochrome P450 (CYP) study  suggested ASP8062 is mainly  metabolized by  
[CONTACT_097]3A4.   Neither naloxone nor buprenorphine are listed as an inhibitor or inducer of 
CYP3A4 in the regulatory  guidance.  Buprenorphine is metabolized by  [CONTACT_224809] 
(CYP3A4; major, CYP2C8 and 2C9; minor) and multiple UDP -glucuronosy ltransferases 
(UGTs) [Rouguieg et al, 2010; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_224762], 2005].  Naloxone is metabolized by  [CONTACT_224810] [Di Marco et a l, 2005; Cheng et al, 1999].  An in vitro CYP study  suggested ASP8062 
is mainly  metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 (IND 125639 study  8062 -ME-9001).  The half -maximal 
inhibitory  concentration values of ASP8062 were 9.25 μmol/L  for CYP2C9 and > 10μmol/L  
for all other CY P isoforms tested (IND 125639 study  8062 -ME-0003).  In addition, ASP8062 
did not show more than dose proportional pharmacokinetics or time variant pharmacokinetics 
in humans.  These data suggest that there is no significant inhibitory  effect of ASP8062 for
CYPs under the proposed clinical dose/exposure.   Assessments based on the relevant data of 
ASP8062, literature and regulatory  guidance (the FDA’s 20 20Final Guidance for Industry  on 
in vitro Cytochrome P450 -and transporter -mediated drug -drug interaction (DDI) studies, the 
2018 MHL W Guideline on drug interactions for drug development and appropriate provision 
of information and the 2012 EMA Guideline on the investigation of drug interactions) 
indicate no remarkable concerns of a pharmacokinetic DDI betwee n ASP8062 and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] 
(e.g., morphine and buprenorphine) and naloxone.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Safety
A total of 117 health y subjects were exposed to single oral doses of ASP8062 (fasted 0.3, 1, 
3, 10, 30, 35 or 70 mg, or fed 10 or 30 mg), including 26 subjects who also received multiple 
doses (3, 10 or 30 mg) over 14 days (Study  8062 -CL-0004).  Thirty -six additional healthy  
subjects were exposed to multiple doses of ASP8062 (1, 3, 10 or 30 mg) over 14 days.  
Ninety -five FM patients were exposed to multiple doses of 30 mgASP8062 over 8 weeks.  
Overall, ASP8062 was well tolerated in health y subjects at single doses up to 70 mg and 
multiple doses (once daily ) for 14 days up to 30 mg.  In addition, 20 healthy subjects were 
exposed to single oral doses of ASP8062 (60 mg) toge ther with a single dose of alcohol 
(EtOH dose: 0.6g/kg for females and 0.7 g/kg for males) in Study 8062 -CL-2001 (report in

ASP8062 will be co -administered with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], including standard medication -assisted 
treatments such as buprenorphine/naloxone.  This DDI/safety  study  will provide relevant

vomiting, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], hy perhidrosis and blurred vision.  Buprenorphine/naloxone will be 
down -titrated from day s19 through 2 6in a manner known to be safe and well -tolerated.   The 
site has appropriately  trained staff and required equipment available to treat subjects 
presenting with both opi[INVESTIGATOR_224768]/naloxone associated AEs.
There is no expected benefit to the subjects from the administration of buprenorphine/nalox one 
other than the potential that subjects may  gain insight that this may  be a useful treatment for 
them.  All subjects will be provided with referrals for treatment of OUD before planned 
discharge.
This will be the first study  where a single oral dose of ASP8062 is administered in subjects 
stabilized on a buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film.  Risks are minimized by  [CONTACT_224811] b uprenorphine formulations or other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
Continuous pulse oximetry  for at least 8 hours will be employ ed on day 12 when ASP8062 is

4.2 Dose Rationale
The primary  objective of this study  is to assess the safet y and tolerability of multiple doses of 
buprenorphine/naloxone alone and buprenorphine/naloxone in combination with a single 
dose of ASP8062.   ASP8062 is primarily  metabolized by  [CONTACT_097]3A4.  Buprenorphine and 
naloxone are not CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers at clinically  relevant dose/exposure and 
therefore, not expected to affect ASP8062 pharmacokinetic profiles.   In the 8062 -CL-0005 
study , the AUCs of 30 mg ASP8062 with tablet B formulation (provided as a 30 mg tab let) 
were approximately  10% higher than 30 mg ASP8062 with the tablet A formulation 
(provided as a 25 mg tablet plus a 5 mg tablet) with the 90% CI within the standard 
bioequivalence limits (80.00, 125.00); C max was approximately  60% higher.  With this 
finding, multiple doses of 25 mg ASP8062 with tablet B formulation will be proposed for 
future clinical trials for OUD .  For this stud y, a single dose of 60 mg ASP8062 with tablet B 
formulation is expected to achieve comparable exposures after multiple doses of 25 mg 
ASP8062 and exposures in the previous clinical studies.   Based on the preliminary  
pharmacokinetic data in the 8062 -CL-2001 study , Cmax and AUC 24after single dose of 60 mg 
were 218 ng/mL and 1820 ng•hr/mL, which did not exceed mean exposure limit set in 
previous phase 1 studies (247 ng/mL for C max and 2339 ng•hr.mL for AUC 24).  The 
exposures achieved in this study  is also expected to be pharmacologicall y active (as seen in 
study  8062 -CL-0003) and safe and tolerated based on data from previous clini cal studies in 
total of 137 healthy  subjects and 95 fibrom yalgia patients as reviewed in [Section [IP_ADDRESS]
Clinical Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacod ynamics and Section [IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Safety ].
The buprenorphine/naloxone dosage and administration is per the Suboxone® label 
[Suboxone Package Insert].   For down -titration of buprenorphine/naloxone, [L ing et al, 2009]

9 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY
In general, all data will be summarized with descriptive statistics for continuous endpoints, 
and frequency  and percentage for categorical endpoints, unless otherwise specified.  
Percentages b y categories will be based on the number of subjects with no missing data (i.e., 
will add up to 100%).
Baseli ne will be defined as the last nonmissing observation on or prior to first administration 
of IP, unless otherwise specified.
9.[ADDRESS_270386] 18 subjects (i.e., [ADDRESS_270387] s on placebo ASP8062). Approximagel y [ADDRESS_270388] 25% of the enrolled subjects are female. Subjects who discontinue 
early from the stud y ma y be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor.  No formal sample size 
calcula tion is p erformed as this is not a statistically  powered study .  The number of subjects 
is based on the precedent set by  [CONTACT_224821].  The number of subjects 
planned is considered sufficient to achieve the study  objectives.
Based on the literature, the intrasubject coefficient of variation (CV) for pharmacokinetic 
parameters AUC infand C max of buprenorphine and naloxone are estimated to be 26%.
Assuming the underly ing variability  is similar to 26% and the true underl ying ratio is 100%, 
the 90% CI will lie within (77.0 129.0) with > 80% probability .

12.4.[ADDRESS_270423] a causal relationship wi th this treatment. An AE can therefore 
be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  associated wit h the use of IP whether 
or not considered related to the I P.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnor mal Laboratory Findings
Any abnormal laboratory test result (e.g. , hematology , biochemistry or urinaly sis) or other 
safet y assessment (e.g., vital signs , phy sical examination , ECGs or radiographic scans ), 
including those that worsen from baseline, that is considered to be clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the investigator and not related to underly ing disease, is to 
be reported as an (S)AE.
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  finding or other abnormal safet y assessm ent,
which is associated with the underl ying disease ,does not require reporting as an (S)AE, 
unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.
Repeating an abnormal laboratory  test or other safety  assessment, i n the absence of an y of the 
above criteria, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be 
an error does not require reporting as an AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Potential Cases of Drug -induced Liver Injury
Refer to [Appendix 12.5 Liver Safet y Monitoring and Assessment] for detailed instructions 
on drug-induced liver injury . Abnormal values in AST and/or ALT concurrent or with 
abnorm al elevatio ns in TBL that meet the criteria outlined in [Appendix 12.5 Liver Safet y 
Monitoring and Assessment], in the absence of other causes of liver injury , are considered 
potential cases of drug -induced liver injury  (potential Hy ’s Law cases) and are alway s to be 
considered important medical events and reported per [ Appendix 12.4.5 Reporting 
Procedures for Serious Adverse Events].
12.4.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, the event:
●Results in death
●Is life -threatening (a nAE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subje ct at immediate risk of death; i t 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death)
●Result s in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions
●Results in congenital anomaly  or birth defect

or leads to prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (except if prolongation of planned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_224791])
●Other medicall y important events (defined in paragraph below)
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whethe r expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ,but may  jeopardize the 
subject or may  require intervention to prevent 1of the ot her outcomes listed in the definition 
above. These events, including those that may  result in disability /incapacity , usuall y are 
considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room 
or at home for allergic bronchospasm ,blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
12.4.[ADDRESS_270424]
A medicall y qualified investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between IP and each 
occurrence of each (S)AE.  This investigator will use medical judgment as well as the RSI  
[Section 2.1.[ADDRESS_270425](s)] to 
determine the relationship.  The causality  assessment is 1 of the criteria used when 
determining regulatory  reporting requirements.
The investigator is requested to provide an explanation for the causality asses sment for each 
(S)AE and must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the (S)AE and has 
provided an assessment of causalit y.
Following a review of the relevant data, the causal relationship between the I P and each 
(S)AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_49419] “y es” or “no” to the question “Do y ou consider that 
there is a reasonable possibility  that the event may have been caused by  [CONTACT_33249]?”
When making an assessment of causalit y, the following factors are to be considered when 
deciding if there is evi dence and/or arguments to suggest there is a “reasonable possibility ” 
that an (S)AE may  have been caused by  [CONTACT_33249] (rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out) 
or if there is evidence to reasonabl y den y a causal relationship:
●Has the subject been admin istered I P?
●Plausibility  (i.e., could the event have been caused by  [CONTACT_224829]?  Consider 
biologic and/or pharmacologic mechanism, half -life, literature evidence, drug class, 
preclinical and stud y data, etc.)
●Dechallenge/dose reduction/rechallenge:
○Dechallenge: did the (S)AE resolve or improve after only  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_224792] y treatment?
○Dose reduction: did the (S)AE resolve or improve after reducing the dose of the 
suspect drug?
○Rechallenge: did the (S)AE reoccur if the sus pected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped?

Version 1.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 2●Laboratory  or other test results: a specific laboratory  investigation supports the 
assessment of the relationship between the (S)AE and the IP (e.g., based on values pre -, 
during and post -treatment)
●Available alternative explanations independent of IP exposure; such as other 
concomitant drugs, past medical history , concurrent or underl ying disease, risk factors 
including medical and family  history , season, location, etc., and strength of the 
alternativ e explanation
●Finally , judging which are more likel y based on all the above contents, factors of 
reasonable possibility  or confounding factors, comprehensive judgment of plausible 
temporal relationship between exposure to the IP and (S)AE onset and/or reso lution will 
be provided.  Did the (S)AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the 
administration of the IP?
There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the s ponsor.  However, it is very  important that 
the investigator alway s assesses causalit y for every event before the initial transmission of the 
SAE data to the sponsor.  With limited or insufficient information about the event to make an 
informed medical jud gment and in absence of an y indication or evidence to establish a causal 
relationship, a causality  assessment of “no” is to be considered.  In such instance, the 
investigator is expected to obtain additional information regarding the event as soon as 
possi ble and to re -evaluate the causalit y upon receipt of additional information.  The 
medically  qualified investigator may  revise his/her assessment of causality  in light of new 
information regarding the SAE and shall send an SAE follow -up report and update the eCRF
with the new information and updated causality  assessment.
12.4.4 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity  of each AE:
●Mild: No disruption of normal daily  activities
●Mod erate: Affect normal daily  activities
●Severe: Inability  to perform daily  activities

Version 1.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 212.4.6 Reporting Procedures for Special Situations
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study  dosing period or within 30 days from 
the discontinuation of dosing, the investig ator is to report the information to the sponsor 
according to the timelines in [Appendix 12.4.5 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse 
Events] us ing the SAE worksheet as a special situation and i n the eCRF .
The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy  information on any  female partner of a 
male subject who becomes pregnant during the study  dosing period or within 90 days from 
the discontinuat ion of dosing and report the information to sponsor according to the timelines 
in [Appendix 12.4.5 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Event s] using the SAE 
worksheet as a special situation.
The expected date of delivery  or expected date of the end of the pregnancy , last menstruation, 
estimated conception date, pregnancy  result and neonatal data, etc., should be included in this 
information.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any  pregnancy  complication or 
termination (including elective termination) of a pregnancy  is to be reported for a female 
subject as an AE in the eCRF or SAE per [Appendix 12.4.5 Reporting Procedures for Serious 
Adverse Events].  For (S)AEs experienced by  a female partner of a male subject, (S)AEs are 
to be reported via the SAE worksheet.
Additional information regarding the outcome of a pregnancy  when also categorized as an 
SAE is mentioned below:
●“Spontaneous abortion ”includes miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion
●Death of a newborn or infant within 1 month after birth is to be reported as an SAE 
regardless of its relationship with the I P
●If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it is to be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the IP is judged as “possible ”by [CONTACT_1275]
●Congenital a nomal y (including anomal y in miscarried fetus)
Unless a congenital anomaly  is identified prior to spontaneous abortion or miscarriage, the 
embry o or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects by  [CONTACT_224832].  (S)AE s experienced by  [CONTACT_224833]/infant should be reported via the 
pregnancy  reporting form.  Generall y, follow up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks 
following the estimated delivery  date.
[IP_ADDRESS] Medication Error, Overdose and “Off -label Use”
If a medication error ( defined as an unintended failure in the treatment process that leads to, 
or has the potential to lead to, harm to the subject), overdose or “off -label use” (i.e., use 
outside of what is stated in the protocol) is suspected, refer to [Section 10.3 Major Protocol 
Deviations].  Any associated (S)AEs are to be reported in the eCRF.  If the AE meets the 
definition of an SAE, the SAE is also to be reported as described in [Appendix 12.4.5

Version 1.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 2Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events] together with the details of the medication 
error, overdose and/or “off-label use.”
In the event of suspected ASP8062 overdose, the subject should receive supportive care and 
monitoring.   The medical monitor/expert should be contact[CONTACT_77792].
In the event of suspected buprenorphine/naloxone overdose, refer to the approved package 
insert supplied by  [CONTACT_224834].  The medical monitor/expert should be contact[CONTACT_224835].
[IP_ADDRESS] Misuse/Abuse
Definition of misuse: situations where the IP is/are intentionally  and inappropriately  used not 
in accordance with the intended use as defined in the protocol.
Definition of abuse: persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of medicinal products 
which is accompanied b y harmful ph ysical or ps ychological effects.
If misuse or abuse of the IP is suspected, the investig ator must forward the special situation 
worksheet to the sponsor by  [CONTACT_77787]  (within 24 hours of awareness).  An y 
associated (S)AEs are to be reported in the eCRF.  If the AE meets the definition of an SAE, 
the SAE is also to be reported as described in [Appendix 12.4.5 Reporting Procedures for 
Serious Adverse Events] together with details of the misuse or abuse of the I P.
[IP_ADDRESS] Occupational Exposure
If occupational exposure (e.g., inadvertent exposure to the I P of study  site personnel while 
preparing it for administration to the subject) to the I P occurs, the investigator must forward 
the special situations worksheet to the sponsor b y fax or email immediately (within 24 hours 
of awareness).  An y associated (S)AEs occurring to the individual associated with or 
resulting from the special situation are to be reported on the special situations worksheet.

●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and †TBL > 2 × ULN or international normalized ratio (INR) 
>1.5 (if INR testing is applicable/evaluated)
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%)
†Samples taken simultaneously or within a maximum of 24 hours.
The investigator may  determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify  as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring 
and follow -up.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly  
characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history , 
physical examination and clinical laboratory  tests.  The study  site personnel are to complete 
the liver abnormalit y case report form (LA -CRF).   Subjects with confirmed abnormal liver 
function testing should be followed as described below.
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_270431] is asy mptomatic.
Severe hepatic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of another 
etiology , may  be considered an imp ortant medical event and may  be reported as a SAE.  The 
sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_224836].
To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory  findings, the investigator is expected to:
●Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  Sy mptoms 
and new -onset diseases are to be recorded as “AEs” within the eCRF.  Illnesses and 
conditions such as hy potensive events and dec ompensated cardiac disease that may  lead 
to secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted.  Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is seen in 
obese h yperlipoproteinemic and/or diabetic subjects and may  be associated with 
fluctuating AT levels.  The investigator shou ld ensure that the medical history  form 
captures an y illness that predates stud y enrollment that may be relevant in assessing 
hepatic function.
●Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative me dications), alcohol use, recreational drug use and 
special diets.  Medications are to be entered in the eCRF.  Information on alcohol, other 
substance use and diet should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document.
●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents.
●Based on the subject’s history , other testing may  be appropriate including:
○Acute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E or other infectious agents)
○Ultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract disease
○Other clinical laborator y tests, including INR and direct bilirubin
●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations.
●Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.
Study Treatment Discontinuation
In the absence of a n explanation for increased liver function tests, such as viral hepatitis, 
preexisting or acute liver disease, or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury , the 
subject may  be discontinued from study  treatment.  The investigator may  determine t hat it is 
not in the subject’s best interest to continue study  treatment.  Discontinuation of study  
treatment should be considered if:
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and† TBL  > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5) (if INR testing is 
applicable/evaluated)
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%)
† Samples taken simultaneously or w ithin a maximum of 24 hours.
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_270432] with moderate or severe hepatic laboratory  tests 
is not possible, study  treatment should be discontinued.
Hy’s Law definition: Drug -induced jaundice caused by  [CONTACT_77813] , without a 
significant obstruc tive component, has a high rate of bad outcomes, from 10% to 50% 
mortality  (or transplant).
The 2 “requirements” for Hy ’s Law are:
1.Evidence that a drug can cause hepatocellular -type injury , generall y shown by [CONTACT_224837] > 3 × ULN (“2 × UL N elevations are too common in treated 
and untreated subjects to be discriminating”).
2.Cases of increased total bilirubin (at least 2 × ULN) with concurrent AT elevations at 
least 3 × ULN and no evidence of intra -or extra -hepatic bilirubin obstruction (ele vated 
ALP) or Gilbert’s s yndrome [Temple, 2006].
FDA Guidance for Industry  titled, “Drug -induced Liver Injury : Premarketing Clinical 
Evaluation” issued b y the FDA on July 2009:
1.The drug causes hepatocellular injury , generally  shown by  a higher incidence of 3-fold 
or greater elevations above the ULN of ALT or AST than the (nonhepatotoxic) control 
drug or placebo.
2.Among subjects showing such AT elevations, often with ATs much greater than 
3×ULN, 1 or more also show elevation of serum TBL to > 2 × ULN, witho ut initial 
findings of cholestasis (elevated serum ALP).
3.No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased AT and TBL, such 
as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; preexisting or acute liver disease; or another drug capable of 
causing the observe d injury .

Version 1.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 2Definition of Key Study Terms
Terms Definition of Terms
Baseline Assessments of subjects as they enter a study before they receive any IP.
Endpoint Variable that pertains to the efficacy or safety evaluations of a study.
Note: not all endpoints are themselves assessments since certain endpoints 
might apply to populations or emerge from analysis of results.  That is, 
endpoints might be facts about assessments (e.g., prolongation of survival).
Enroll To register or enter a subject into a study.  Note: once a subject has received 
the IP o r placebo, the protocol applies to the subject.
Intervention The drug, device, therapy or process under investigation in a study that is 
believed to have an effect on outcomes of interest in a study (e.g., 
health -related quality of life, efficacy, safety and pharmacoeconomics).
Investigational 
periodPeriod of time where major interests of protocol objectives are observed and 
where the test product or comparative drug (sometimes without 
randomization) is given to a subject and continues until the last ass essment 
after completing administration of the test product or comparative drug.
Randomization The process of assigning subjects to treatment or control groups using an 
element of chance to determine assignments in order to reduce bias.
Note: unequal rand omization is used to allocate subjects into groups at a 
differential rate; for example, [ADDRESS_270447] 
or comparative drug (sometimes without randomization) is given to a 
subject.
Study period Period of time from the first study site initiation date to the last study site 
completing the study.
Variable Any quantity that varies; any attribute, phenomenon or event that can have 
different qualitative or quantitative values.

Version 1.2 Incorporating Nonsubstantial Amendment 213 ATTACHMENT 1: NONSUBSTANTIAL AMEND MENT 2
I.  The purpose of this amendment is:
Nonsubstantial Changes
1.Update to the rescreening language   
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Edit the rescreening language.
RATIONALE:
To allow for the repeat of screening assessments within the screening window or to allow a 
subject to rescreen once for the study . Due to the nature of the participant population and 
the study  design, subject safet y and data integrit y will not be impacted.
2.Clarify inclusion and exclusion criteria
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Move exclusion criterion 23 to the inclusion criteria and clarify  the CYP 450 enzy mes that 
are excluded for exclusion criterion 18.
RATIONALE:
Previous exclusion [ADDRESS_270448] to be 
eligible for participation; as a result, this exclusion should be listed as an inclusion. 
Exclusion 18 excluded all inducers of metabolism; however, after consideration, it is only  
necessary  to exclude inducers of CYP2C8, 2C9,and3A4.
3.Clarify procedure for continuous end tidal CO 2
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Add clarification that subjects may  remove canula to dose or eat.
RATIONALE:
The timepoints overlap for the collection of end tidal CO 2and it would not be possible for 
the subject to dose or eat with the canula in place.

 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
1.1 Disease Background  
The prognosis of pancreas adenocarcinoma (PCA) remains poor with little progress made in 
the last few decades with the exception of FOLFIRINOX (PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11) 1 and 
gemcitabine/nab -Paclitaxel (MPACT trial) 2 treatments in 2011 and 2013, respectively, 
changing the PCA management paradigm with a median overall survival (OS), at best, 
reaching 11.1 months. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_95053], there is a continuous need to improve 
survival through the investigation of molecul arly targeted agents.  
  
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor (VEGFR) -mediated 
signaling and angiogenesis contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of PCA. 3,4 VEGF 
is expressed in all PCA tumors.  5 VEGF -A/VEGFR -2 signaling plays an important role in 
inducing invasion and migration of PCA cells. 6,7 VEGFR -2 and ph osphorylated -VEGFR -2 
(pVEGFR -2) are expressed in 69% and  50% of 107 PCA. The pVEGFR -2 is significantly 
associated with invasion of the anterior capsule of pancreas and art eries. It i s proposed that 
the expression of these receptors is an important p redicti ve and prognostic factor  in PCA 
treatment. 6,8 
 
Results from anti -angiogenic agents studied in advanced PCA failed to significantly improve 
primary outcomes. The use of bevacizumab was evaluated in the AViTA Trial (Addition of 
bevacizumab to gemcitabine and erlotinib) and the reported negative primary o utcome (OS). 
9 Another phase III trial with gemcitabine and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) combination 
compared to gemcitabine alone ( CALGB [ZIP_CODE]) proved same  outcomes ( P= 0.95). 10 
Axitinib, in a phase III trial, compared gemcitabine/Axitinib to gemcitabine alone in the 
same setting, an d yielded no significant difference in overall survival (OS). 11 Interestingly, 
and challenging the findings from single agent backbone studies, the combination of 
gemcitabine and a fluoropyrimidine (5FU or capecitabine) with bevacizumab reached their 
primary endpoints in two separate single arm phase II trials.  4,[ADDRESS_406089] the efficacy of 
anti-angiogenic therapy in PCA. In a preclinical study, the anti -tumor activity of 
fluoropyrimidines but not that of gemcitabine caused the release of bone marrow derived 
circulating endothelial progenitor cells (CEPs) and Tie -2 expressing monocytes (TEMs) as 
well as the induction of pro -angiogenic growth factors. Anti -angiogenic agents inhibit the 
CEP and TEM mobilization and pro -angiogenic signaling and thus enhance significantly the 
anti-tumor activity of  fluoropyrimidines but not that of gemcitabine. [ADDRESS_406090] anti -angiogenic therapy by [CONTACT_328796] -
1. 15 These findings may explain why gemcitabine does not  elicit TEM and CEP recruitment 
and may therefore lack synergy with anti -VEGF agents. This phenomenon is not known to 
  HCRN GI14 -198 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 13AUG2018  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_406091] a large and significant survival advantage over 
gemcitabine alone in advanced PCA, 1 thus the choice of FOLFIRINOX combination in our 
proposed trial.  The AViTA Trial (Addition of bevacizumab to gemcitabine a nd erlotinib) 
suggests that a subset of PCA subjects with elevated VEGF -A or VEGFR -2 levels may 
benefit from bevacizumab. 9,16 
 
1.2 Ramucirumab Clinical Experience  
Ramucirumab (RAM)  (IMC -1121B , trade name [CONTACT_328815] ) is a fully human monoclonal 
antibody  (IgG1) directed mainly against VEGFR -2. RAM also blocks binding of VEGFR 
ligands, VEGF -A, VEGF -C, and VEGF -D. As a result, RAM inhibits ligand -stimulated 
activation of VEGFR -2, thereby [CONTACT_328797] -induced proliferation, and migration of 
human endothelial cells. RAM received its first global approval by [CONTACT_328798] 21, 
2014 as monotherapy in the treatment of advanced or metastatic gastric cancer or gastro -
esophageal  junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma subjects  who experience disease progression on 
or after 5FU - or platinum -containing chemotherapy. This approval was granted following 
the results of the REGARD trial, which compared RAM, as a single agent, to placebo in 
secon d line treatment of gastric and GEJ adenocarcinomas. 17 RAM had significant OS 
benefit when combined to paclitaxel in advanced/metastatic gastric and GEJ 
adenocarcinoma in the second line setting (RAINBOW trial). 17,[ADDRESS_406092] (Avastin for Advanced Gastric Cancer) study, in which 774 subjects  with 
advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma were randomized to a cisplatin/capecitabine with 
bevacizumab or placebo. 23 Given these opposing results between bevacizumab and RAM in 
gastric and GEJ cancers, it is becoming clearer that blocking VEGFR -2 (RAM) has a likely 
advantage ove r blocking VEGF -A (bevacizumab). More recently, the RAISE trial 
demonstrated the benefit of using ramucirumab in the setting of metastatic colorectal cancer. 
This trial compared r amucirumab versus placebo in combination with FOLFIRI in the 
second line sett ing for subjects  with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. In this study, [ADDRESS_406093] s. A pooled analysis of 
7 prospective trials showed that normal albumin levels (>3.4  g/dL ) were associated with 
significantly improved median OS (10.2 months vs. 4.1 months; P =0.0001), median time to 
tumor pro gression (TTP) of 6.2 vs. 3.7 months  (P=0.0488), and disease control rate (71% vs. 
46%; P=0.007) for subjects  receiving bevacizumab, but not for those tre ated without 
bevacizumab. 26

be randomized within  one business day  of registration and begin therapy within  [ADDRESS_406106] be notified  within  24 
hours  of unblinding.  
 
In compliance with applicable regulations, in the event of a serious adverse event (SAE), the 
subject’s treatment assignment may be  unblinded before reporting to the health authorities, 
ethic committees, and site investigators if the SAE was related (possibly, probably, 
definitely) to the blinded treatment.  
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Treatment Regimen  
One cycle will be equal to 28 days . The ramucirumab/placebo will be administered prior to 
the mFOLFIRINOX regimen.  Both arms will receive mFOLFIRINOX regimen  given per 
institutional standards  (suggested administration sequence below) , which will be a 
modification of the  previously published regimen. 27 mFOLFIRINOX will be administered 
every 2 weeks . Dose modifications  for all medications  are outlined in Section 6:  
• Arm A will receive ramucirumab  administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 
minutes (infusion rate should not exceed 25 mg/min), at a fixed dose of 8 mg/kg 
every 2 weeks.  
• Arm B will receive a placebo infusion. Due to the double -blinded nature of this study, 
the volume of placebo wi ll be calculated as if it were ramucirumab.  
• Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 over 2 -4 hours  
• Irinotecan 165 mg/m2 over 90 minutes  
• 5-FU 2,400 mg/m2 as a 46 -hour continuous infusion  without  the 5 -FU bolus to 
decrease the risk of neutropenia.  
 
Leucovorin is not included  in this regimen since the 5 -FU is administered as a continuous 
infusion and not in bolus form.

8. CRITERIA FOR DISEASE  EVALUATION  
 
8.1 Definitions Associated with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) version 1.[ADDRESS_406139] one measurable lesion. If the measurable disease is restricted to a 
solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology.  
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_406140] one 
dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_406141] x -ray, as >[ADDRESS_406142] 
scan, or >[ADDRESS_406143] be recorded 
in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
8.1.3  Non-measurable lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non -measurable 
disease . Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not 
followed by [CONTACT_462]), are consi dered as non -measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should 
not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic les ions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic 
lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_406144] be >[ADDRESS_406145] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater 
than 5 mm) . At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and 
followed.  
 
8.1.5  Target lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and reco rded and 
measured at baseline . Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions 
with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should 
be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measure ments . It may be the case 
that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in 
  HCRN GI14 -198 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 13AUG2018  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_406146] lesion, which can be measured reproducibly,  should be 
selected . A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) 
for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters . If lymph 
nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum . The 
baseline sum diameters will  be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
8.1.6  Non-target lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 
target lesions  should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at 
baseline . Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in 
rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
 
8.2 Resp onse Criteria  
 
Evaluation of target lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions . Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
non-target) must have reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR)  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference 
the baseline sum diameters  
Progressive Disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference 
the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study) . In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum 
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at 
least 5 mm . (Note:  the appearance of one or 
more new lesions is also considered 
progressions).  
Stable Di sease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR 
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking 
as reference the smallest sum diameters while 
on study

Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 13AUG2018  Confidential  Page 31 of 51 
 Evaluation of non -target lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level . All 
lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size 
(<10 mm short axis)  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
subject to be considered in complete clinic al 
response.  
Non-CR/ Non -PD Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level 
above the normal limits  
Progressive Disease (PD)  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target 
lesions . Unequivocal progression should not 
normally trump target lesion status . It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, 
not a single lesion increase.  
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_33954], and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_456] -investigator.

evaluated  No SD 
PD Any Yes or No  PD 
Any PD* Yes or No  PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
*In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -target lesions may be 
accepted as disease progression.  
 
Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as h aving 
“symptomatic deterioration” . Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

 In some circumstances,  it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue . 
When the evaluation  of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended 
that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) to confirm the complete 
response status.

Duration of overall response —the period measured from the time that measurement criteria 
are met for complete or partial response (whichever status is recorded first) until the date

The disease control rate is the proportion of all subjects with stable disease (SD) for 8 
weeks, or partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) according to RECIST v1.1,

10 ADVERSE EVENTS  
The descriptions  and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4 will be utilized for AE reporting . A copy of the 
CTCAE v4 can be downloaded from the CTEP website at http://ctep.c ancer.gov  
 
10.1 Definitions  
 
10.1.1  Adverse Event  
An Adverse Event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence whether or not considered 
related to the study drug that appears to change in intensity during the course of the study. 
The following are examples of AEs:  
• Unintended or unfavorable sign or symptom  
• A disease temporally associated with participation in the protocol  
• An intercurrent illness or injury that impairs the well -being of the subject  
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute AEs only if they induce 
clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests   
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_328789] (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) should not be  recorded as an AE.  
 
Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable to the study 
regimen  by [CONTACT_6962].  
 
10.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event  (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence resulting in one or more 
of the following:  
 
• Death - Death due to progression is not considered a SAE unless the site investigator 
feels the study drug contributed to disease progression.  
• Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed in the definition above) . Examples of such events include, but are 
not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
  HCRN GI14 -198 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 13AUG2018  Confidential  Page 39 of 51 
 bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or 
the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
10.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Event  
For this study, an AE is considered unexpected when it varies in nature, intensity or 
frequency from information provided in the current IB, prescribing information or when it is 
not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk. Unexpected  also refers to 
AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or are anticipated from 
the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring 
with the particular drug under investigation.   
 
10.1.4 Relatedness  
AEs will be categorized according to the likelihood that they are related to the study drug(s). 
Specifically, they will be categorized using the following terms:  
 
Unrelated  Adverse Event is not related to the study drug(s)  
Unlikely  Adverse Ev ent is doubtfully related to the study drug(s)  
Possible  Adverse Event may be related to the study drug(s)  
Probable  Adverse Event is likely related to the study drug(s)  
Definite  Adverse Event is clearly related to the study drug(s)  
 
10.2 Reporting  adverse eve nts 
 
10.2.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
• AEs will be recorded from time of signed informed consent until 30 days after 
discontinuation of study drug(s).  
• AEs will be recorded regardless of whether or not they are considered related to the 
study drug(s).

11. STATISTICAL  METHODS  
 
11.1 Study Design  
This is a phase II, multicenter, double -blinded, randomized, 2 -arm trial evaluating the 
efficacy and safety of mFOLFIRINOX + RAM (Arm A) vs. mFOLFIRINOX +  placebo 
(Arm B) in 85 subjects  with advanced PCA, not amenable to curative treatment. Subjects 
will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (i.e., there will be 43 subjects in the control group and 42 
subjects in the treatment group).  The primary objective of this trial is to estimate and 
compare  PFS in Arm A versus Arm B. See section 1 1.10 for a description of the  
power/sample size analysis based on the logrank test.

criteria. CTCAE v4 is used to grade toxicities.  
 
11.4 Analysis Plan for Primary Objective  
PFS will be estimated for each arm using the method of Kaplan and Meier. Nine month PFS 
will be reported along with a 95% confidence interval. PFS will be compared between Arm 
A and Arm B using a one -sided logrank test. The ITT analysis dataset will be used for this 
analysis.  
 
11.5 Analysis Plan for Secondary Objectives  
OS will be estimated for each arm using the method of Kaplan and Meier. Median OS will 
be reported along with a 95% confidence interval. OS will be compared between the two 
arms using a logrank test. RR will be estimated for each arm and reported along with exact 
95% confidence intervals. A Fisher’s exact test will be used to compare RR  between the two 
arms. Toxicities will be described for each arm using frequency tables. Fisher’s exact tests 
will be used compare toxicities between arms. The ITT analys is dataset will be used for 
secondary  analys es related to OS and RR . The safety analys is dataset will be used for 
analyses related to toxicities.  
 
11.6 Excessive Toxicity – Criteria for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_328790], safety -stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_328791]. An acceptable toxicity rate 
will be assumed at 0.20. The study will be stopped based on an unacceptable excessive 
toxicity rate of 0.40. A sequential probability ratio test will be used whe re a likelihood ratio 
of 8 in favor of an excessive toxicity rate of 0.40 (vs. 0.20) provides sufficient evidence to 
stop the study due to excessive toxicity. Data  will be continuously reviewed for excessive 
toxicity and statistical analysis performed if e xcessive toxicity is suspected. The table below 
provides the minimum number of patients exhibiting excessive toxicity that will trigger 
statistical analysis.

Ramucirumab will be held for drug related adverse events Grade ≥ 3 until recovery to Grade 
≤ 1 and then resumed with a lower dose level -1 (6 mg/kg). If the Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_406161] will be taken off 
study treatment .   
 
In the case of prolonged or medically concerning Grade 2 toxicity related to  the 
chemotherapy combination, treatment will be interrupted until recovery to Grade ≤ 1, at 
which time treatment will be resumed at the same dose. If the adverse event does not resolve 
in or within [ADDRESS_406162] will be taken off study 
treatment .  
 
11.6.1 Excessive Toxicity  
Excessive toxicity is defined as  any adverse event that meets  the following  criteria : 
 
• Any grade 3 or higher adverse event or an adverse event that leads to discontinuation 
of study therapy.  
• The adverse event must be possibly, probably or definitely related to any of the study 
treatments (Ramucirumab, Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan, 5 -FU) 
• The adve rse event occurs in the first four weeks of treatment  
• The adverse event grade does not diminish to grade 1, four weeks after dose 
modification or dose delay . AE must have been adequately treated ( e.g. nausea, 
vomiting, hematologic toxicities)  
 
11.6.[ADDRESS_406163] cycle of treatment (fo ur weeks), the regimen (Ramucirumab, 
Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan, 5 -FU) will be considered toxic and the trial will be stopped.

if it detects a sig nificant difference in PFS between the two arms at the significance level of 
0.0013 according to the O’Brien -Fleming approach. Otherwise the trial will continue u ntil 
the targeted sample size has been completed.  
 
11.8 Un-blinding Plan  
See section 4.1.  
 
11.9 Analysis Datasets  
The intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis dataset includes all subjects who meet the eligibility 
criteria and are registered onto the study irrespective of  their compliance to the planned 
course of treatment. The  intention -to-treat principle asserts that the effect of a treatment 
policy can be best assessed by [CONTACT_41445] a subject (i.e. 
the planned treatment regimen) ra ther than the actual treatment given. It has the 
consequence that subjects allocated to a treatment group should be followed up, assessed  
and analyzed as members of that group irrespective of their compliance to the planned 
course of treatment.  
 
The safety  analysis dataset includes all subjects who are randomized and receive at least one 
dose of study treatment (on either arm). Subjects  will be analyzed for safety according to the 
treatment actually received.  
 
11.10  Sample Size/Accrual/Study Duration   
We aim to test the null hypothesis of PFS at [ADDRESS_406165] estimated a sample size of 8 5 patients (43 in one and 4 2 in another arm) which will 
provide 80% power under a type 1 error of 20%. This is an estimation on 2 4 months accrual 
and 9 months follow up after accrual for the primary endpoint.  Sample size may increase to 
95 to account for a 10% drop out rate.  
 
The expected progression free survival for mFOLFIRINOX  in metastatic pancreatic cancer 
is [ADDRESS_406166] 9 months. We assume a  type 1 error (α) of 0.2 and a power (1 -β) of 
80%.  
 
With an exact power of 0.[ADDRESS_406167] ratio of 0.66 67 and endpoint of detecting 3 months 
PFS advantage of the mFOLFIRINOX/ ramucirumab combination over mFOLFIRINOX 
alone (from 6 to 9 months), the sample size on each arm was calculated to be 43 in the 
control arm and 4 2 in the treatment arm (total is 85). 29,30 
 
The estimated enrollment period for this study is 24 months and the estimated study duration 
is 33 months.

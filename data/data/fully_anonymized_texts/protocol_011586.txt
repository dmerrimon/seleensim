Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has become the most common healthcare -associated 
infection (HAI) in U.S. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], causing half a million infections and 30,000 deaths annually. 
CDI ranges from asymptomatic colonization, mild to severe diarrhea, pseudomembranous 
colitis, toxic megacolon, colonic perforation, and death. Risk factors for CDI include older age, 
comorbidity, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], exposure to others with CDI, and antibiotic use. Prevention of 
healthcare -onset (HO) -CDI has become a priority for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_865159] (i.e., prudent antibiotic use and limiting exposure to C. 
difficile ). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_865160] C. difficile  can occur  directly  (i.e., hands  or clothing  of healthcare 
workers) or indirectly (i.e., environmental surfaces or shared equipment) so infection 
prevention measures focus on healthcare worker hand hygiene and barrier precautions (i.e., 
use of gowns and gloves) and cleaning and disinfection of the  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84365]. However, 
these interventions are limited to symptomatic patients who test positive for CDI.  
Asymptomatic patients serve as a reservoir for cross -contamination, but microbiological 
screening for asymptomatic carriage of C. difficile is not routinely performed in healthcare.  
Gloving  for all patient  contacts  may interrupt  transmission  from asymptomatic  patients 
colonized with C. difficile . 
The overall purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of healthcare worker use of 
gloves for all patient contact [CONTACT_865194] C. difficile and HO -CDI in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_865161].  The main objective  of the study  is to compare  the effects  of universal  gloving  for 
all patient  contact  [CONTACT_865195] (i.e., glove  and gown use  only for known CDI 
cases). The aims of the study are:  
1) Compare  the effects  of universal  gloving  for all patient  contact  [CONTACT_865196] C. difficile acquisition rates in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643];  
2) Compare  the effects  of universal  gloving  compared  to standard  of care gloving  on CDI 
rates, other HAIs, 30 -day mortality, and unit length of stay; and  
3) Describe  intervention  fidelity,  cost,  and stakeholder  (patients’  and healthcare 
workers’) experiences with universal gloving.  
The study  will be a cluster  randomized  trial (CRT)  in ten inpatient  VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_865161].  Units  will be 
randomized either to implement barrier precautions for all patient contacts (universal gloving 
intervention) or continue standard of care (barrier precautions for patients with known CDI and 
other antibiotic -resistant organisms). The intervention will consist of all healthcare workers 
(nurses, providers, respi[INVESTIGATOR_46175], radiology/laboratory technicians, etc.) utilizing gloves 
for all patient contacts in the units randomized to receive the intervention. Unit -level data, 
including C. difficile acquisition and infection rates, mortality, length of stay, and barrier 
precaution compliance, will be collected monthly from all participating sites.  
If universal  gloving  is found  to be effective  in reducing  C. difficile  acquisition  and subsequent 
infection (and its associated morbidity, mortality, and costs), the results will change the 
paradigm for CDI prevention in healthcare settings.

2.0 Introduction  
Clostridium difficile is the major infectious  cause  of healthcare -associated diarrhea,  causing as 
many as 25% of cases. 1-3 C. difficile infection (CDI) affects 500,[ADDRESS_1206852] of $ 1.[ADDRESS_1206853] found C. difficile acquisition in 1 –13% of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240443] a  week and in 
50% of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117329] 4 weeks. 9,10 Containment of CDI has been 
designated a public health priority by [CONTACT_865197], including the VA.11,12 
Based on evidence -based guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the VA 
Multidrug  Resistant  Organism  (MDRO)  Program  Office  developed  and mandated  a multifaceted 
national bundle for prevention of CDI at VA facilities in 2012 which includes: 13 1) rapid, 
appropriate diagnostic testing for C. difficile , 2) empi[INVESTIGATOR_865166], 3) contact [CONTACT_865198], 4) environmental 
decontamination of rooms of patients with CDI, and 5) strategies for improving healthcare 
worker hand hygiene. However, decreases in CDI rates have been modest, variable and  
inconsistent .[ADDRESS_1206854] positive for CDI. This is a gap because asymptomatic patients 
are a major reservoir of C. difficile, colonization greatly increases the risk of infection and  
VA Central IRB 
Effective Date:  May 7, [ADDRESS_1206855] of practice 
that targets glove use for only patients with known CDI does not interrupt C. difficile 
transmission from patients with asymptomatic colonization resulting in C. difficile acquisition 
and subsequent infection. The rationale for the hypothesis is that both patients with active 
infections and those with asymptomatic colonization serve as reservoirs for patient -to-patient 
transmission of C. difficile either through contaminated healthcare workers hands or 
contaminated healthcare environment (i.e., patient equipment and/or environmental surfaces). 
Hand and environmental contamination with C. difficile spores are well established and these 
spores are resistant to  both hand hygiene and environmental antisepsis methods21-23. 
 
Hand hygiene is generally accepted to be the most effective means of infection prevention, and 
current guidance recommends the use of the preferential use of alcohol based hand rubs 
(ABHR) over soap and water in all clinical situations except 1) when hands are visibly soiled 
(e.g., blood, body fluids) and 2) after caring for a patient with known or suspected C. difficile or 
norovirus during an outbreak or if endemic rates are high.[ADDRESS_1206856]  precautions  by [CONTACT_865199],  but the microbiology  resources  are not necessary. 
In discussions with VA facilities, there has been much enthusiasm for universal gloving and 
none for screening and isolation.  
 
3.0 Objectives  
The overall goal of our research is to reduce CDI. This proposed study will study the 
effectiveness  of healthcare  workers’  use of universal  gloving  for all patient  contact  [CONTACT_865200] C. difficile in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_865167] 
(i.e., healthcare worker glove use when caring for patients in CP isolation) using a pragmatic 
cluster randomized trial (CRT) in ten inpatient VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7011].  
VA Central IRB 
Effective Date:  May 7, 2024   We hypothesize that patients with asymptomatic carriage of C. difficile can shed the pathogen 
and therefore are an important reservoir for transmission of C. difficile . There are two 
approaches to target this colonization: microbiological screening of patients to identify those 
patients who are carriers of C. difficile and increased barrier precautions. Microbiological 
screening for asymptomatic carriage of C. difficile is not routinely performed in healthcare 
because data is limited regarding the use of a detection and isolation intervention to decrease 
transmission of C. difficile and therefore not recommended at present.[ADDRESS_1206857]  (i.e., universal  gloving)  in non-ICU acute  care 
units to prevent transmission of C. difficile from both patients with known infections and those 
patients who are asymptomatic carriers.  
We have  proposed  three  objectives:  
• To compare  the effects  of universal  gloving  for all patient  contact  [CONTACT_865196] C. difficile acquisition rates in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643]  
• To compare  the effects  of universal  gloving  compared  to standard  of care on CDI rates, 
other healthcare -associated infections (CLABSI, CAUTI, MRSA), 30 -day mortality and 
unit length of stay.  
• To evaluate  intervention  fidelity  (hand  hygiene  and barrier  precaution  compliance;  glove 
use for all patients and glove plus gown use for patients in contact [CONTACT_307600] (CP) 
isolation),  the cost and stakeholder  experiences  (interviews  and provider -patient  contact 
[CONTACT_154700]).  
This study will be the first to evaluate whether universal gloving will prevent transmission from 
patients who are asymptomatically colonized with C. difficile in non -ICU units in an RCT. The 
study  will also investigate  the impacts  of universal  gloving  on associated  factors,  including  CDI, 
other healthcare -associated infections, and their effects on a unit’s morbidity, mortality, costs 
and patients and healthcare workers experience. If the results of the study support universal 
gloving, it will change the paradigm for prevention of CDI nationwide.  
 
4.1 Resources  and Personnel  
4.2 Participating  Sites  
The coordinating study site and personnel (including the PI) will be based at the Madison VA. 
The Madison  VA-based  team  will be responsible  for overall  study  execution,  including  protocol 
refinement,  comprehensive  site training,  medical  monitoring,  handling  of patient -related  issues 
that may arise, coordination of clinical event ascertainment efforts, and interfacing with study 
committees and local site teams.  
Five sites (Milwaukee, Hines, Bronx, Washington DC, Portland) will enroll ten inpatient units 
(i.e., acute medical, medical/surgical, surgical or specialty units) to participate in the study; 2 
inpatient units at each site. A Local Site Investigator (LSI; see above list of names under 
personnel)  and a Research  Assistant  (RA) will be assigned  to each  participating  site to assist  in 
completing study procedures and ensuring compliance with the study protocol at this site.  
Local  site responsibilities  will be discussed  in detail  with the LSI and RA prior to beginning  study 
procedures. These responsibilities may include:  
• Maintain  site documentation  (e.g. study  binder,  study  information  sheets,  sample  code 
key)

Additional personnel at each site (e.g. unit leadership) will be engaged as needed to ensure 
buy-in and adherence to study procedures.  
4.4 Resources  
Multiple  entities  will support  the successful  progress  and completion  of the study:  
Executive  Committee  (EC):  The EC will consist  of the PI, the site investigators,  and the 
research assistants. The EC will review study contact, recruitment and  
troubleshooting, IRB, and other regulatory issues.  
VA Central IRB 
Effective Date:  May 7, 2024   Steering Committee (SC): The SC will be composed of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators as 
well as the lead biostatistician.  The SC will discuss  progress,  recruitment  goals,  review 
quality of the data, and troubleshoot.  
Coordinating Site Committee (CSC): The CSC will be physically located at the Madison 
VA and led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Nasia Safdar (PI). The CSC will be responsible for overall study 
execution, including protocol refinement, comprehensive site training, medical 
monitoring, handling of patient -related issues that may arise, coordination of clinical 
event ascertainment efforts, and coordinating with other Committees and with VA 
HSR&D. The CSC will also coordinate with statistical and qualitative data experts to 
ensure  appropriate  data management,  quality  control  and quality  assurance,  information 
technology for communication and trial conduct monitoring, statistical methods (ex. 
randomization, interim monitoring), analyses, interpretation of findings, preparation of 
results, and publication of findings from the trial.  
We will work  with the VA Centralized  Transcription  Services  Program,  located  at the Salt Lake 
City VA and led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Susan Zickmund, for the transcription of qualitative interviews.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1206859]  this study  using  a pragmatic  stratified -cluster  randomized trial  (CRT) in  ten 
inpatient  VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_865161]  (acute  medical,  medical/surgical,  or surgical  inpatient  acute  care 
units). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_865168] a 1:1 ratio: [ADDRESS_1206860] universal gloving practices (intervention) and [ADDRESS_1206861] of care 
(control).  
Due to resource  and personnel  feasibility,  randomization  will be stratified  by [CONTACT_865202].  
A 6-12-month  pre-intervention  period  will be used  to conduct  preliminary  work  at sites including 
training research assistants, identifying current practices, finalizing monitoring and observation 
plans. Each participating unit will collect data for up to 24 months – a 24-month intervention 
period. During the intervention period, we will collect data on a monthly basis, including C. 
difficile acquisition and infection rates, other infections (CLABSI, CAUTI, MRSA), mortality, 
length of stay, and intervention fidelity (hand hygiene compliance and barrier precaution 
compliance; glove use for all patients and glove plus gown use for patients in CP isolation).  
These unit -level data will be obtained from aggregate reports prepared by [CONTACT_865203] 
(IPEC) data management system and/or from VA administrative records. Patient -level data on 
relevant clinical characteristics such as comorbidities, prior treatments and healthcare usage, 
and outcomes such as HAIs will be obtained from VA administrative records for patients who 
consent to stool specimen collections. We will conduct interviews/focus groups with healthcare 
workers throughout the intervention period and individual interviews with patients throughout 
the intervention  period.  These  interviews  and focus  groups  will explore  healthcare  workers’  and 
patients’ experiences with the intervention. We will also conduct patient and healthcare worker 
survey  on provider -patient  contact  [CONTACT_2329]  a Likert  scale  to assess  the amount  of contact  [CONTACT_865204].  
VA Central IRB 
Effective Date:  May 7, 2024   5.2.2 Intervention  
In the units randomized to receive the intervention, all healthcare workers (nurses, providers, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_105489], radiology and laboratory technicians, etc.) will utilize universal gloving 
(non- sterile gloves) for all patient contacts. If a patient in the intervention unit is known to have 
CDI or an MDRO,  both gowns  and gloves  will be used  as is current  standard  of care practice  for 
patients  in CP isolation.  Signage  denoting  what type of precautions  are needed  will be placed  on 
the door of each patient’s room.  
 
The non -intervention units will follow standard of care which consists of healthcare workers 
following  barrier  contact  [CONTACT_307600]  (i.e., gloves  plus gowns)  only for patients  with known  CDI 
and other MDROs (e.g., MRSA).  
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_1206862]  focus  groups  with up 
to 60 healthcare workers (up to 12 individuals for each of the 5 sites enacting the intervention) 
who are aged [ADDRESS_1206863] performed 
employment duties within the  participating unit during the intervention period, and who agree to 
participate in the interview. We will interview 50 patients (10 per site enacting the intervention) 
who are aged [ADDRESS_1206864] surveys with patients and environmental services staff. We will aim to 
survey 10 patients per site at all 10 participating sites, for a total of 100 patients (50 from 
intervention group and 50 from control group). Given the small expected number of 
environmental  service  staff on each  unit, we will aim to survey  at least 1 worker  per site at all 
10 participating sites, for a total of 10 workers.  
Focus  groups  and patient  interviews will  be conducted  via face-to-face or phone/Teams  call. All 
interviews will be audio -recorded to be transcribed later for analysis of themes and concepts 
unless patients decline to be recorded, in which case field notes will be taken and analyzed 
instead.  Please  see section  7.0 for specific  detailed  procedures  for handling  interview  recording 
and transcript information.

5.2.4 Risk  Analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Known  Potential  Risks  
This is a minimal  risk study  to participating  units  and to the healthcare  workers  and patients 
within these units.  
Physical Risks. No physical risks are anticipated from this study. Use of barrier contact 
[CONTACT_307600] (gloving plus gowning) is currently the standard of care for patients with certain 
communicable  diseases  including  antibiotic -resistant  organisms  (e.g.,  MRSA),  so the expansion 
of universal gloving for care of all patients (intervention) does not present additional risk to 
healthcare workers or patients.  
There  are no physical  risks associated  with collection  of stool  samples  for C. difficile  lab testing. 
However, if we are unable to obtain a stool specimen, we will obtain a stool sample using a 
perirectal swab which may present minimal discomfort or embarrassment to patients. The 
perirectal swabs will be obtained using a CDC standardized methodology and standardized 
specimen collection technique which involves swabbing the perirectal area. Perirectal swabs

Effective Date:  May 7, [ADDRESS_1206865] to study team members. There will not be any 
identifiable data  collected; anonymity will avoid any possible repercussion and data  will not be 
used to assess individual performance at study sites, nor will our data in any way affect 
participant  standing at  the institution. As  part of the interview  process, a  statement  will be read 
prior to audio recording asking the interviewee not to share personal information. Although 
there is no intention to collect identifiable healthcare worker data that would link interview 
responses to a healthcare worker, if identifiable data was inadvertently shared during audio 
recording, this data will be deleted from the transcripts. Participants may experience social or 
psychological  discomfort  during  interviews.  Study  team members  will frequently  elicit feedback 
from participants about their comfort level and remind them they do not have to answer 
questions they are not comfortable with and that the entire interview is voluntary. Study 
participation will  be entirely voluntary.  
Social,  Legal, or  Other  Risks. There  is a minimal risk  of loss  of privacy or confidentiality.  Only 
the minimum necessary identifiers will be collected and maintained for study conduct; any 
unintentional identifiers will be removed from the data. A unique code will be generated for  
each aggregate and patient -level data variable and linked to a unique code representing the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359230] (for patient -level data) the patient. This identifier will be for purposes of the 
study only and will not include individually identifiable private  information; it will be used to 
replace all individual identifiers in the data prior to analysis. De -identified patient -level data for 
which participants gave HIPAA authorization to share with the University of Wisconsin and 
deidentified aggregate data may be shared with the University of Wisconsin (the university 
affiliate) as specified in a valid Data Use Agreement. Otherwise, data will be saved to the 
Madison VA secure server behind the VA firewall. The shared data file will only be accessible 
via VA computers that are password protected and accessed only by [CONTACT_2710]. Logs 
of VCS gift cards given to participants containing participants’ study names and forms signed  
by [CONTACT_4317] (required in order to use the gift cards) will only be accessible by [CONTACT_865205]/Budget  offices  at participating  sites who may need  to 
audit the logs. Computers will be maintained in locked offices with access only by [CONTACT_3244]. Interviews will be recorded on encrypted digital recorders or using Microsoft Teams 
and directly saved to the Madison VA secure server behind the VA firewall. When using 
Microsoft Teams access to the channel/meeting on which it is recorded will be restricted to 
study staff with permissions to access this data. The shared data file will only be accessible to 
study team members via VA computers that are password protected and automatically logged 
off when not  in use. A unique number  will be generated for  each interview and this identifier will

[IP_ADDRESS]  Known  Potential  Benefits  
No direct benefits to patients and healthcare workers are anticipated, but patients may 
potentially  benefit  if the use of gloves  by [CONTACT_865206] C. difficile within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. Others may benefit in the 
future from what we learn as a result of the study, as our study will address critical gaps 
regarding effectiveness of universal gloving for CDI prevention.  
We hypothesize  that the use of the universal  gloving  intervention  will reduce  C. difficile  
acquisition  and infection  within  the units  assigned  to the intervention.  
If this study  shows  a decrease  in the carriage  of C. difficile , the community  at large  would 
benefit by [CONTACT_684435] a potential reservoir for disease transmission. Regardless of study 
results, important knowledge will be gained from the study guiding future research in the 
prevention of healthcare -associated CDI.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment  of Potential  Risks  and Benefits  
The risks to subjects in this study are minimal. In order to reduce risk and discomfort to 
subjects, we propose to collect stool samples when possible and then perirectal swabs f for 
measuring  C. difficile . When  perirectal  swabs  are collected,  subjects  can choose  to have  the 
RA/healthcare worker perform the perirectal swab or self -collect the perirectal swab. The 
intervention  – universal  gloving  – is a non-invasive  barrier  precaution  that has been  a source 
of enthusiasm for VA healthcare facilities. As part of the study, we will also ask about 
stakeholders’ (patients and healthcare workers) experiences with universal gloving for all 
patient contacts versus standard of care. In addition, a sample of patients and healthcare 
workers will be asked to complete a survey regarding their perception of provider -patient 
contact [CONTACT_2329] a [ADDRESS_1206866] of care procedures. It is expected of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_865170]; high quality care will be provided to all patients regardless of diagnosis. 
Patients on units that are in the intervention arm of the study where expanded barrier 
precautions (i.e., universal gloving) are used for all patient contacts will receive the same high - 
quality  care as a patient  in in the control  arm of the study  following  standard  of care procedures. 
Patients on units that are in the control arm of the study will have no change in their care.  
Educational  materials  used  in the study  will remind  healthcare  workers  in the participating  sites 
that patient care practices must conform to local facility standards regardless of whether 
expanded barrier precautions (i.e., universal gloving) are implemented for patient care.  
C. difficile is an important and increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in Veterans in VA 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_865171]. As 1) there is the potential for both short - and long -term benefits in 
the reduction  of C. difficile -associated  morbidity  and mortality  based  on the findings  of this study 
and 2) the Veterans’ health, safety, and comfort has been maximized in our study design, we 
believe that the benefits of this study outweigh its minimal risks.  
5.3 Recruitment  Methods  
INTERVENTION  
Ten inpatient units (two each from five participating VA facilities) will be included in the study, 
and the intervention  will be conducted  at the unit level.  Multiple  sites have  previously  expressed  
VA Central IRB 
Effective Date:  May 7, [ADDRESS_1206867]  in participating  in an investigation  of universal  gloving  as well as in healthcare - 
VA Central IRB 
Effective Date:  May 7, 2024   associated infection prevention research in general. Communication describing the study and 
the study team’s/PI’s contact [CONTACT_865207]. Informational 
teleconferences  will be offered  for interested  facilities  to provide  additional  study  requirements 
and eligibility criteria. Interested facilities will be sent a screening questionnaire to assess 
eligibility and facility support.  
 
This study is a cluster randomized trial: because all patients in a unit can contribute to 
transmission  of C. difficile , the intervention  needs  to apply  to all patients  in the unit. As only VA 
facilities will be included, all patients in the unit will be aged 18 or greater.  
SPECIMEN  COLLECTION  
Research staff will check with patient’s nurse or other healthcare team member (e.g., the 
nursing station) prior to approaching patients for specimen collection consent to determine if it 
is appropriate to approach a patient based on his/her health needs and other contextual 
factors, for example, whether there are any patients who should not be approached because 
they are in quarantine or not feeling well.  We will work with unit staff to refine the process for 
identifying patients who may be approached as needed based on unit staff’s preferences; for 
example, members of the healthcare team may wish to make first contact [CONTACT_4490] a patient by 
[CONTACT_865208] a research opportunity or by [CONTACT_865209]. Research  staff will approach  those  patients 
deemed appropriate on the participating units on the first study day and then subsequently 
newly admitted patients to ask if they are willing to speak about a voluntary research 
opportunity. If so, the RA will review study details and ascertain the patient’s interest in 
providing a stool or swab specimen. The RA will assess whether it is a good time to approach 
the patient (e.g., by [CONTACT_865210]’s nurse or other healthcare team member) prior 
to approaching the patient. The healthcare team members will not screen for eligibility or 
directly recruit patients to participate in specimen collection.  Rather, the healthcare team 
member’s role is to facilitate patient care by [CONTACT_865211]. Admitted 
patients will be identified from VA administrative records  (e.g., from the CDW) and the 
admission and discharge tracking system used by [CONTACT_865212] (e.g., the gains and 
loss report).  
 
Patient participants  will be  offered  a $15 Veterans  Canteen Service  (VCS) gift  card (Patriot Bucks) 
in exchange for their participation in the study at local sites where and when VCS gift cards are 
made  available  to the local study  team.  The gift card will be given  to the patient  by [CONTACT_865213], regardless of whether the patient provides a second 
specimen prior to discharge (i.e., even if the subject later withdraws from the study). Versions of 
recruitment flyers referencing the gift cards will be used whenever and wherever VCS gift cards 
are available.  
 
INTERVIEWS  
We will recruit  individual  healthcare  workers  and patients  for interviews  about  their experience 
with the intervention.  
 
Healthcare  Workers  
We will conduct focus groups/interviews with up to 12 healthcare workers at each participating 
unit assigned to the intervention, for a total of up to 60 healthcare workers involved in focus 
groups. Prior to beginning the focus groups/interviews, which may take place throughout the 
intervention period, the Local Site Investigator and Research Assistant will discuss recruitment 
options  with unit leadership.  Recruitment  strategies  may include  presentations  at staff meetings 
(using verbal script) or email to unit staff. The LSI or local RA will lead these recruitment 
strategies, for example by [CONTACT_865214].  
Recruitment for these focus groups may also include emails to unit staff. We will discuss with 
unit leadership/supervisors if email  is appropriate to use for their staff and,  if so,  how to access 
these  email  addresses.  We will discuss  with site staff,  including  unit leadership/supervisors  and 
VA Central IRB 
Effective Date:  May 7, 2024   local research staff, who should send the  email – it will come from either the LSI, the local RA, 
or a member of the central research team. The email will include contact [CONTACT_865215][INVESTIGATOR_865172], decline 
participation, or ask questions. Staff receiving study information sheets will be able to contact 
[CONTACT_865216]-in option  on the study  information  sheet  whereby  [CONTACT_865217].  Staff who  select the  opt-out option  of the study  information  sheet 
will not be contact[CONTACT_865218]. If we do not hear a 
response  (either  agreement/declination  to participate  or request  to not be contact[CONTACT_734418]),  we 
will follow -up a maximum of two additional times via email and/or phone.  
During  the recruitment  process,  regardless  of outreach  method,  each  potential  participant  will 
receive the interview information sheet. The healthcare worker will have time to review the 
sheet,  and research  staff will answer  any questions  they have  before  asking  if they would  like 
to participate. Healthcare workers who agree to participate in interviews will be given a brief, 
voluntary, anonymous demographics survey by [CONTACT_132640] (e.g., with the interview 
information sheet) to complete before or after the interview. Healthcare workers may 
participate in interviews even if they decline to complete the demographics survey.  
 
Healthcare worker interview guides will be submitted to the appropriate unions for review prior 
to launching procedures. Interviews will take place during non -work time (e.g. lunch hour) or 
during supervisor -approved work time (e.g. during regularly scheduled staff meetings where 
patients  have  coverage  and supervisors  can leave  the area).  Supervisors  will be notified  prior to 
beginning any interview recruitment procedures.  
 
Patients  
We will interview  10 patients  at each  participating  unit assigned  to the intervention  for a total of 
50 patient interviews. During the  intervention  period, the  site Research Assistant will work  with 
unit staff to identify and approach patients. The RA will discuss with unit staff to determine if it 
is appropriate to approach a patient based on his/her health needs and other contextual 
factors; for example, patients will not be approached who are receiving end -of- life care, are 
cognitively impaired, or are unable to understand English. Patients who are under contact 
[CONTACT_865219]  (for example,  use of gowns  and gloves 
for all patient contact) will not be approached for interviews. We will work with unit staff to 
refine the process for identifying patients who may be approached as needed based on unit 
staff’s preferences; for example, members of the healthcare team may wish to make first 
contact [CONTACT_4490] a patient –by [CONTACT_865208] a research 
opportunity or by [CONTACT_865220].  
The healthcare team member will not screen for eligibility or directly recruit patients to 
participate  in interviews.  Rather,  the healthcare  team  member’s  role is to facilitate  patient  care 
by [CONTACT_865211].  
 
The RA will check with the patient’s nurse or other healthcare team member before 
approaching the patient to ask him/her to participate and will not approach any patient without 
the nurse’s or other healthcare team member’s agreement that it is a good time to do so. The 
RA will not approach patients who have indicated they do not want to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], receiving 
end-of-life care, cognitively impaired, non - English speakers, in contact [CONTACT_865221]/she  is undergoing any  medical  procedures. The  RA will ask the patient  in his/her  room 
if he/she is willing to speak about a voluntary research opportunity. If so, the RA will meet face - 
to- face with the patient  to assess  eligibility and  to provide basic  information  regarding  the study 
and the voluntary nature of participation. A liberal amount of time will be allotted for discussion 
of the study and the patient’s role in the study, and to answer any questions posed by [CONTACT_4677]. The written information sheet will also be provided to the patient. The RA will offer the 
potential  subject  time for private  contemplation  and review  of the documents  provided  or time to 
discuss the study with important support persons not currently with the patient. If the patient 
decides to participate, he/she can tell the RA in person or via the provided contact [CONTACT_865222]. The RA will ask for the patient’s phone number so that the  
VA Central IRB 
Effective Date:  May 7, 2024   patients  can be contact[CONTACT_865223].  In addition,  the RA will ask the patient  if the 
RA may  return  to the patient at a  later time to check  in about their decision. The  RA may  return 
to the patient one additional time to follow -up, and only with the patient’s approval to do so 
based on the recruitment script. Patients who agree to participate in interviews will be given a 
brief, voluntary, anonymous demographics survey by [CONTACT_132640] (e.g., with the interview 
information sheet) to complete before or after the interview. Patients may participate in 
interviews even if they decline to complete the demographics survey.  
SURVEYS  
Patients  
We will work with unit staff to refine the process for identifying patients who may be 
approached as needed based on unit staff’s preferences; for example, the healthcare team 
member may wish to make first contact [CONTACT_4490] a patient –by [CONTACT_865224] a research opportunity or by [CONTACT_865225]. The healthcare team member will not directly recruit patients to participate in 
the surveys. The RA will check with the patient’s nurse before approaching the patient to ask 
him/her  to participate  and will not approach  any patient  without  the nurse’s  agreement  that it is 
a good  time to do so. We will recruit  patients  to complete  a Patient -Provider  Contact  [CONTACT_865226].  
No PII or PHI will be included  on these  surveys.  We will aim to obtain  10 patient  surveys  per 
site. 
We will work with unit staff to determine how to share the survey with patients; options may 
include leaving the survey on bedside table, including survey in admission/discharge 
paperwork,  and/or  having  research  staff explain  the survey  and ask patient  if they are willing  to 
participate. A pen/pencil will be provided to patients who wish to complete the survey. We will 
collect completed surveys  through a discreet, anonymous receptacle and/or the  RA pi[INVESTIGATOR_865173].  
Environmental  Services  Workers  
We will also recruit environmental services workers to  complete a survey of their experiences 
with the intervention  (e.g. to determine  if the increased  gloving  impacts  their workload).  No PII 
or PHI will be included on these surveys. We will aim to obtain [ADDRESS_1206868] and information sheet at 
regularly scheduled staff meetings where the supervisor is not present. We will provide time to 
answer questions as well as information for how to complete and return surveys. A discreet, 
anonymous  receptacle  will be placed  for completed  surveys.  The survey  completion  should  take 
no more than 5 minutes and thus should not interfere with work duties.  
5.4 Informed  Consent  Procedures  
Verbal  Informed  consent  and signed  HIPAA  authorization  will be obtained  for stool  sample 
collection from the participant.  
We are requesting a waiver of informed consent for the intervention (use of universal 
gloving) and access to unit records (patient admission and discharge; gains and loss 
report, VA administrative records on unit admissions and discharges) to track 
compliance with study procedures and measure unit -level clinical outcomes and 
observe  healthcare  worker  compliance  with gloving  procedures.  We will work  with each 
facility to determine how they normally track admission and discharge. We anticipate 
that most, if not all, sites will utilize the standard gain and loss report or admission, 
discharge, transfer (ADT) report available on VISTA; thus, we plan to  use this report to  
VA Central IRB 
Effective Date:  May 7, [ADDRESS_1206869]  reporting  parameters  for each  site, 
or we will access this information via CPRS, VISTA, and/or the VA administrative 
records (e.g., the CDW).  
We are requesting  a waiver  of documentation  of informed  consent  for patient  specimen 
collection and healthcare worker/ patient interviews, focus groups, and surveys.  
We are requesting  waivers  of consent  because:  
It is not possible  to carry  out the study  using  written  individual  informed  consent . In this study, 
we are performing a cluster randomized trial. Cluster randomized trials such as these most 
often are granted waived consent due to the inability to carry out the research without waiver 
of consent. As is the case for many infection control or behavioral interventions, this 
intervention cannot be studied using a traditional patient -level randomization because: a) the 
intervention is difficult if not nearly impossible to randomize to individual patients in the unit 
and not other patients; b) there are group -level variables in patient units (patient -specific 
variables and healthcare worker -specific variables) that make the CRT the most valid study 
design; and c) bacteria transmission does not occur on the individual level but on a group 
level within a patient unit. An example of a group level variable is colonization pressure.  
Colonization pressure, defined as the percent of patients in a given patient unit with an 
infectious agent such as an antibiotic -resistant organism (MRSA), affects the probability of 
other patients acquiring the bacteria and developi[INVESTIGATOR_89994] (primary and secondary 
outcomes  of the study).  Since  wearing  gloves  and gowns  to care for a particular patient  (e.g., 
patient A) would protect that patient  from acquiring an infection, but  would also prevent  other 
patients (e.g., patient B, patient C, patient D) in the same unit from acquiring bacteria from 
patient A. Another reason is that if the study was randomized to individual patients, it is likely 
that healthcare  workers  would  be influenced  by [CONTACT_865227]. A patient -level 
randomized trial is inadequate to study interventions that reduce transmission of infections.  
CRT is the preferred  design  in many  infectious  disease  and infection  control  studies  when  the 
investigator is worried about contamination of intervention to control patients.  
(1) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the participant . Use of barrier contact 
[CONTACT_307600] (gloving plus gowning) is currently the standard of care for patients with certain 
communicable diseases including antibiotic -resistant organisms (e.g., MRSA), so the 
expansion  of universal  gloving  for care of all patients  (intervention)  does  not present  additional 
risk to healthcare workers or patients.  
 
 
(2) The waiver will not adversely affect rights and welfare of participants . Use of barrier 
precautions are currently the standard of care for patients  with certain communicable diseases 
including antibiotic -resistant organisms (e.g., MRSA). It is expected of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_865174]; high quality care will be provided to all 
patients regardless of diagnosis. Patients on units that are in the intervention arm of the study 
where barrier precautions are used for all patient contacts will receive the same high -quality 
care as a patient in which barrier precautions are either being used for other purposes or not 
being used  at all. Patients on units that are in the  control arm of the study will have no change 
in their care. Educational materials used in the study will remind healthcare workers in the 
participating  sites that patient  care practices  must  conform  to local facility  standards  regardless 
of whether barrier precautions are implemented for patient care.  
(3) Whenever  appropriate,  additional  pertinent  information  will be provided  to participants  after 
participation . In the event that patients or healthcare workers request study information, each 
site will have readily available copi[INVESTIGATOR_865175], the procedures involved in the trial, and who to contact [CONTACT_865228]. No individual patient information will be provided.  
VA Central IRB 
Effective Date:  May 7, 2024   5.4.1 Consent  Procedures  and Documentation  
 
SPECIMEN  COLLECTION  (STOOL  SAMPLE)  
Research staff will provide study details and obtain verbal informed consent and signed HIPAA 
authorization  from all subjects  prior to swab/stool  specimen  and data collection.  The study  team 
will provide  time to answer  questions  and clarify  consent  procedures.  Interested  subjects  will be 
provided with  an information  sheet.  A version  of the information  sheet  detailing  subject  payment 
details  will be used  by [CONTACT_865229].  An information  sheet 
without  reference  to subject  payments  will be used  whenever  and wherever  VCS gift cards  are 
available  for them  to use. Where required by [CONTACT_37403], consent will be documented in the 
electronic medical record.  
If the subject is unable to consent (incompetent, impaired decision -making capacity), the 
subject’s legally authorized representative will be asked to provide verbal informed consent, 
and the subject’s Personal Representative will be asked to provide written HIPAA 
authorization. No subjects who are unable to consent will be enrolled in the study unless 
verbal consent has been obtained from a legally authorized representative and written HIPAA 
authorization has been obtained from a Personal Representative.  Local research personnel 
will follow all applicable laws and regulations. VHA Directive 1605.[ADDRESS_1206870] on behalf of the 
individual to include privacy - related matters. The authority may include a power of attorney, 
legal guardianship of the individual, appointment as executor of the estate of a deceased 
individual, or  a Federal, State,  local or  tribal  law that establishes such  authority  (e.g., parent  of 
a minor).” Competency of the subject will be determined by [CONTACT_865230].  If competency  has not been  documented  in prior notes  and 
we determine that the subject cannot consent, then discussion with the treating team 
regarding capacity to consent will ensue. In case of patients deemed incompetent or with 
impaired decision -making capacity, the legal representative would be contact[CONTACT_865231] 
a relative asked to consent for them. The legally authorized representative for the subject will 
be documented in the medical record (progress note or copy of legally recognized document). 
If the subject is later deemed to be competent, they will be re -consented as soon as possible. 
The plan for re -consenting subjects with fluctuating decision -making capacity or those who 
regain consent capacity is to review the study and consent materials and provide information  
on their previous  participation  and surrogate  consent.  Subject  dissent  would  overrule  surrogate  
consent. The subject or their representative (legally authorized representative or Personal 
Representative)  will be first approached by  [CONTACT_865232]. The following persons will be contact[CONTACT_865233]: a. health care 
agent  (individual  named  as a power  of attorney),  b. legal guardian  or c. next of kin in this order 
(spouse, child, parent, sibling, grandparent or grandchild) or d. close friend.  The subject’s 
medical record will be examined to determine whether a Personal Representative is 
documented.  If a Personal Representative is not identified from the medical record, research 
personnel will ask the legally authorized representative whether the subject has a Personal 
Representative, and if so, who the Personal Representative is. The Personal Representative 
will be provided  with the study  information  sheet  and HIPAA  authorization  form.  If the subject’s 
legally authorized representative is also a subject’s Personal Representative, they will be 
asked to provide both verbal consent and written HIPAA authorization. If no Personal 
Representative is identified, or the Personal Representative does not provide written HIPAA 
authorization, the subject will not be enrolled in the study unless they later gain capacity to  
VA Central IRB 
Effective Date:  May 7, [ADDRESS_1206871]’s participation.  
Documentation  by a qualified  practitioner  in the individual’s  medical  record  in a signed  and 
dated progress note that the individual lacks capacity to make the decision to participate in the 
proposed study. NOTE: the qualified practitioner may be a member of the research team OR 
the individual has been ruled incompetent by a court of  law. Disclosures required by [CONTACT_865234]  (the informed  consent  process)  must  be made  to the 
subject’s surrogate(s) (legally authorized representative and Personal Representative).  
Discussion of the major aspects of the study with the surrogate(s) may take place either in 
person or over the phone. The surrogate(s) will be informed that their decision should be 
based upon that which the surrogate believes is, or would be, desired by [CONTACT_423]. If a 
subject’s wishes cannot be determined, surrogate decisions should be based upon that which 
the surrogate believes to be in the subject’s best interest. If feasible, the practitioner will 
explain the proposed research to the prospective research subject even when the surrogate 
gives  consent.  Under  no circumstances  will the subject  be forced  or coerced  to participate  in a 
research study. Local site study personnel will be required to complete VA human subject 
protections training requirements prior to the start of the intervention phase of the study. In 
addition, local research staff will attend a virtual training session on how to obtain and 
document informed consent that will be conducted by [CONTACT_165245] (Madison VA) 
research staff.  
INTERVENTION  (UNIVERSAL  GLOVING)  
As this is a cluster randomized trial, all healthcare workers/patients within a unit will need to 
participate  in the intervention/comparator  (as assigned)  and data collection  in order  to ensure 
meaningful data.  
 
If the patient lacks decision -making capacity, the research staff will provide information to the 
caregiver(s)/Legally Authorized Representative (LAR). The information will be given to 
caregiver(s)/LAR when the subject is unconscious or clearly lacking capacity. When a 
caregiver/  LAR is not present  in the unit, the study  information  sheet  will be mailed.  The mailing 
will be  determined in the following order of  priority:  a. health care  agent (individual named as  a 
power  of attorney),  b. legal guardian  or c. next of kin in this order  (spouse,  child,  parent,  sibling, 
grandparent or grandchild) or d. close friend. This information will be determined by [CONTACT_865235].  
SURVEYS/INTERVIEWS  
 
Patients and healthcare workers who are participating in surveys and/or interviews/focus 
groups will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from 
participation  at any time,  without  prejudice. The  rights  and welfare  of the participants  will be 
protected  by [CONTACT_865236]. They will receive information sheets 
describing  the purpose  of the study,  the procedures  involved, and  who to contact  [CONTACT_865228].  
5.5 Inclusion/Exclusion  Criteria  
VA inpatient  units  meeting  the following  criteria  are eligible  to participate  in the study:

in interviews or focus groups, the individual must be:  
1. [ADDRESS_1206873]  be: 
1. 18 years  of age or older  
2. A patient  admitted  to the participating  unit. 
5.6 Study  Evaluations  
Patient -level  data  
C. difficile Acquisition: In both the intervention and control groups, we will obtain one swab or 
stool sample upon admission and one swab or stool sample upon discharge to test for the 
presence  of C. difficile. This outcome  data will be collected  on an individual  patient  level,  but de- 
identified prior to reporting. These test results will not be available to healthcare workers or 
patients at participating sites. Acquisition will be defined as a patient who has an initial test (via 
stool or perirectal swab) upon unit admission that is negative for C. difficile and a subsequent 
discharge test within the same unit that is positive for C. difficile . 
Specimen  collection  
Research staff and/or clinical staff in both the intervention and control arms of the study will 
implement a standard protocol for obtaining stool or perirectal swab (depending on patient 
preference)  samples  for C. difficile  test using  standardized  clinical  methodology.  Samples  will be 
collected within [ADDRESS_1206874] stool and storing a sample of the stool in a sterile contained. C. difficile testing via 
perirectal swab sample will be obtained by [CONTACT_865239] (a swab from the anal 
verge, without rectal insertion) in a circular motion, ideally until visible stool is noted on swab.  
The swab samples will be obtained in a private room or the privacy curtain will be drawn in 
semi-private rooms to protect patient privacy. The discharge sample may be collected within 
[ADDRESS_1206875] clinical 
pre-printed patient labels and collected on site by [CONTACT_865240], These collected samples will be refrigerated according to 
procedures  defined  by [CONTACT_865241].  
The specimens  will be shipped  to a central  microbiological  research  laboratory  at the Wm. S. 
VA Central IRB 
Effective Date:  May 7, 2024   Middleton Memorial VA Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_865180] U.S. regulations governing the 
shipment of Diagnostic Samples, Dangerous Goods and dry ice.31 No patient identifiers will be 
received  by [CONTACT_19690].  Microbiological  work -up for C. difficile  will follow  Clinical  and 
Laboratory  Standards  Institute  procedures32 and the use of a central  microbiological  laboratory 
to process these specimens will assure standardized microbiological (or molecular) methods 
and processing of  the samples.  Specimens will be  tested  for C. difficile , and C. difficile isolates 
will be tested for in vitro cytotoxin production using previously described procedures.29 
Shipments will be tracked using a shared database stored on the VA server.  
Participants (patients and staff) will not be informed of the results of the cultures. The  
cultures are measuring C. difficile colonization, not infection. There is currently no treatment 
for C. difficile colonization, and many patients who are colonized with C. difficile are and 
remain  asymptomatic.  Thus,  informing  participants  of a positive  C. difficile  culture  could  result 
in undue stress and unnecessary treatments to the patient given the possibility that the 
colonization will remain asymptomatic. In addition, it remains unknown whether altering 
behaviors of  healthcare  workers could impact  the spread of C. difficile from asymptomatically 
colonized patients and thus there is no standard for how to care for a patient that is found to 
be asymptomatically colonized. So, it is not currently useful to inform healthcare workers 
simply of positive cultures. However, patients that develop symptoms of C. difficile infection, 
such as diarrhea, will be cultured and treated according to the standard of care in all 
intervention and control units.  Specimen results will be stored on a database on the VA 
server, unless otherwise specified in a valid DUA.  
Demographics: In both the intervention and control groups, for patients who consented to 
clinical data  collection, we  will obtain data  on demographic characteristics (age, gender,  race, 
weight,  height)  from VA administrative  records  (e.g.,  Corporate  Data Warehouse  [CDW]  files). 
These data will be linked to patient specimen results  (e.g., C.  difficile colonization) and stored 
on a shared database on the VA server,  unless otherwise specified in a valid DUA.  
Past medical history/other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_865181]: In both the intervention and 
control  groups,  for patients  who consented  to clinical  data collection, we  will obtain  data on the 
following characteristics from VA administrative records (e.g., using healthcare utilization  
dates, prescriptions, and diagnostic/treatment codes from CDW files): hospi[INVESTIGATOR_865182] (dates of admission to and discharge from the healthcare facility and 
participating unit, disposition [to acute care, home, home services, or skilled nursing 
facility/nursing home/long -term care facility], and source [i.e., where the patient was admitted 
from], treatments and healthcare utilization within the 90 days prior to admission and CDI 
occurring during their admission (antibiotic use, proton -pump inhibitor use, visits to healthcare 
facilities [emergency department, infusion services such as chemotherapy, hemodialysis]), 
CDI-related surgical intervention prior to admission, and comorbidities (acute renal failure, 
asthma, cancer, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
cardiovascular disease, dementia, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, liver disease, 
paralysis,  peripheral  vascular  disease,  renal  disease,  rheumatic  disease,  peptic  ulcer  disease). 
These data will be linked to patient specimen results and stored on a shared database on the 
VA server, unless otherwise specified in a valid DUA.  
C. difficile infection: In both the intervention and control groups, we will determine the 
development  of C. difficile  infection  during  admission  among  patients  who consented  to clinical 
data collection by [CONTACT_865242] (e.g., using diagnostic codes 
from CDW files).  These data will be linked to  patient specimen results and stored on a shared 
database on the VA server, unless otherwise specified in a valid DUA.  
Other  Healthcare -Associated  Infections:  The incidence  of other  HAIs  including:  1) catheter - 
associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), 2) catheter -associated urinary tract infection 
(CAUTI), and 3) MRSA HAIs during admission among patients who consented to clinical data 
collection will be obtained from VA administrative records (e.g., using diagnostic codes from 
CDW files) for both the intervention and control groups. These data will be linked to patient 
specimen results and stored on a shared database on the VA server, unless otherwise

Effective Date:  May 7, 2024   specified  in a valid DUA.  
Mortality:  In both the intervention  and control  groups,  mortality  among  patients  who consented 
to clinical data collection will be obtained  from VA administrative records (e.g., using date of  
death from the  CDW files).  These data will be linked to  patient specimen results and stored on 
a shared database on the VA server,  unless otherwise specified in a valid DUA.  
Other clinical outcomes: In both the intervention and control groups, for patients who  
consented  to clinical  data collection,  whether  the patient  had toxic megacolon  or a colectomy  
will be obtained  from VA administrative records (e.g. using diagnostic/treatment codes from  
CDW files).  These data will be linked to patient specimen results and stored on a shared 
database on the VA server, unless otherwise specified in a valid DUA.  
Unit-level  data  
C. difficile Infection : The development of C. difficile infection will be determined by 
[CONTACT_865243]. In both the intervention and control groups, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -onset (HO) -CDI will be 
collected monthly as  a unit aggregate rate. In this case, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_865183]. 
Research personnel will collect these data from site personnel (i.e., infection control) at 
participating sites which are collected as usual standard of care. The CDC definition of 
HO-CDI, used by [CONTACT_41309],33 is defined as: 1) LabID Event specimen collected >3 days 
after admission to the facility (i.e., on or after day 4) and 2) CDI -positive laboratory 
assay: A positive laboratory test result for C. difficile toxin A and/or B, (includes 
molecular assays [PCR] and/or toxin assays) tested on an unformed stool specimen 
(must conform to the container) OR A toxin -producing C. difficile organism detected by 
[CONTACT_865244] (must 
conform to the container). The data will be uploaded to a shared database on the VA 
server, unless otherwise specified in a valid DUA.  
Other  Healthcare -Associated  Infections:  The incidence  of other  HAIs  including:  1) catheter - 
associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), 2) catheter -associated urinary tract infection  
(CAUTI),  and 3) MRSA  HAIs  will be measured.  HAI data will be collected  monthly  for both the 
intervention  and control  groups  using  standard  CDC/VA  definitions.  Research  staff will collect 
monthly aggregate data from  site personnel (i.e.,  infection control) at  participating sites which 
are collected as standard of care reporting to VA IPEC (inpatient evaluation center) and/or 
from VA administrative records. The rate will be calculated by [CONTACT_865245] (i.e., Foley catheters or central lines) 
  1,000 and the 
number of MRSA infections per number of patient days x 1000. The data will be uploaded to 
a shared database on the VA server,  unless otherwise specified in a valid DUA.  
Mortality: In both the intervention and control groups, research staff will collect monthly 
aggregate  30-day mortality  ratio data from site personnel  (i.e., nurse  manager)  at participating 
sites which are collected as standard of care reporting to VA IPEC and/or from VA 
administrative records. The data will be uploaded to a shared database on the VA server, 
unless otherwise specified in a valid DUA.  
Length  of Stay:  In both the intervention  and control  groups,  research  staff will collect  monthly 
aggregate length of stay (i.e., the number of days spent in the participating unit based on unit 
admission and unit discharge) data from site personnel (i.e., nurse manager) at participating 
sites which are collected as standard of care reporting to VA IPEC and/or from VA 
administrative records. The data will be uploaded to a shared database on the VA server, 
unless otherwise specified in a valid DUA.  
Intervention  Fidelity  Data:  
Hand Hygiene Compliance: In both the intervention and control groups, hand hygiene 
compliance  will be measured  on a random  sample  of healthcare  workers  caring  for patients. 
Research staff will perform monthly observations that will be recorded on a standard 
observation tool; participating site research staff will be trained by [CONTACT_865246]. WHO manual for observers recommends observing a minimum of 200 hand

Effective Date:  May 7, [ADDRESS_1206876] Precaution Compliance: In both the intervention and control groups, barrier 
precaution compliance (i.e., healthcare worker glove plus gown use during care of patients in 
CP isolation) will be measured on a random sample healthcare worker contacts during care of 
patients in CP isolation. Research staff will perform monthly observations that will be recorded 
on a standard observation tool; participating site research staff will be trained by [CONTACT_865247]. We estimate the average number of patient contacts by 
[CONTACT_865248] [ADDRESS_1206877] 2 -6 patients (10 -30%) in CP isolation; each month research personnel will observe for 
one hour to generate  10% sample  of 12 healthcare  worker  contacts  using  minimum  estimate  of 
patients in isolation. The data will be uploaded to a shared database on the VA server, unless 
otherwise specified in a valid DUA.  
 
Universal  Gloving  Compliance:  In the intervention  group,  universal  gloving  compliance  will 
be measured on a random sample of healthcare workers caring for patients. Research staff 
will perform monthly observations that will be recorded on a standard observation tool; 
participating site research staff will be trained by [CONTACT_865249]. We 
will use hand  hygiene  opportunity  estimates34,[ADDRESS_1206878] opportunities per unit per month in the intervention unit 
only. The data will be uploaded to a shared database on the VA server, unless otherwise 
specified in a valid DUA.  
Isolation Days of Care: Contact [CONTACT_865250] (e.g.,  MRSA). If a  large proportion of barrier  precautions are 
being used in the control group for these types of patients, it could confound the study 
endpoints. To account for this, we will collect and estimate isolation days of care. In both the 
intervention  and control  groups,  research  staff will collect  monthly  aggregate  data on isolation 
patients from site personnel (i.e., infection control) at participating sites which are collected  
as standard of care reporting. We will estimate the isolation days of care by [CONTACT_865251].  
The data will be uploaded  to a shared  database  on the VA server,  unless  otherwise  specified 
in a valid DUA.  
Interviews  
Healthcare Worker Experience: The study team plans to explore healthcare workers 
experience using barrier precautions for all patient contacts vs standard of care using 
qualitative methodology. Questions will address five main areas: 1) understanding of the 
rationale for universal gloving to reduce and prevent CDI; 2) barriers and facilitators to 
implementing universal gloving; 3) perceptions around how the intervention influenced 
healthcare workers’ care of and interactions with patients and other aspects of their jobs; 4) 
how the healthcare  workers  integrated  universal  glove  donning  into their regular  workflow;  and 
5) any other  issues  or areas  of concern  around  the intervention.  
Qualitative focus groups of healthcare workers (physicians, registered nurses, and health 
technicians who have regular and direct patient contact) will be conducted at each 
participating  unit assigned  to the intervention  throughout  the study  period.  Each  focus  group 
will include up to [ADDRESS_1206879] about  45 minutes with moderators  following a 
structured interview guide, adding additional probing questions to facilitate discussion. One  
VA Central IRB 
Effective Date:  May 7, 2024   moderator  (either  the trained  LSI or local RA, or a member  of the Madison -based  study  team) 
will facilitate each group discussion while another trained professional will record field notes 
during the group to track the flow of conversation and document nonverbal behaviors.  
Interviews may take place either in -person, led by [CONTACT_865252], or virtually 
(telephone or  webinar), led by [CONTACT_865253]. The central research team has previous 
experience with virtual focus groups. Group discussions will be audio recorded (unless 
participants  decline  to be recorded,  in which  case field notes  will be taken  instead),  and tapes 
transcribed. Qualitative analysis will be used to identify codes, categories, and themes.  
Participants  will be asked  to complete  a brief,  voluntary,  anonymous  demographics  survey  that 
the local RA will give to the participant to complete before or after the interview (e.g., along 
with the interview information sheet or form 10 -2303). The RA will collect the surveys from the 
participants once the surveys are complete. Demographic characteristics will not be linked to 
individual participants, and only aggregate demographic information will be obtained during 
analysis and shared during manuscript preparation.  
Patient Experience: The study team plans to explore patient experience with healthcare 
workers use of universal gloving for all patient contacts vs standard of care using qualitative 
methodology. Questions will address three main areas: 1) patients’ perceptions of the staff’s 
practice  of universal  glove  donning,  including  positive  and negative  perceptions;  2) any changes 
in care or interactions that patients perceive were related to universal glove donning; and 3) 
patients’ understanding of the potential benefits of the intervention.  
Individual  interviews  with 10 patients  will be conducted  at each  participating  unit assigned  to the 
intervention during  the intervention period.  Patient  interviews  will be conducted  either  by [CONTACT_865254]/or telephone or by [CONTACT_865255] a private 
setting. For patients in private rooms, the door will be closed. For patients in semi -private 
rooms,  they will be  asked  if drawing the  privacy  curtain  is adequate to  meet  their privacy  needs, 
and for those granting permission the privacy curtain will be drawn. Each session will be 15 -30 
minutes with moderators following an interview guide, adding additional probing questions to 
facilitate discussion. Interviews will be audio recorded (unless participants decline to be 
recorded, in which case field notes will be taken instead), and tapes transcribed. Qualitative 
analysis will be used to identify codes, categories, and themes. Participants will be asked to 
complete a brief, voluntary, anonymous demographics survey before or after the interview. The 
RA will collect the surveys from the participants once the surveys are complete. Demographic 
characteristics will not be linked to individual participants, and only aggregate demographic 
information will be obtained during analysis and shared during manuscript preparation.  
Cost  Analysis  
Cost: We will conduct  a cost -identification analysis to assess cost of  providing the intervention. 
To estimate costs of the intervention of universal gloving, we will obtain cost data direct 
observation, estimates and consultation with the study facility. To estimate the cost of the 
intervention, we will calculate the cost of implementing universal gloving and the usual care 
barrier approach. The cost of glove supply costs will be obtained from the research team and 
facility. We will also estimate the supply costs associated with the usual care gloving. We will 
estimate  supply  costs  by [CONTACT_865256].  We will obtain  a monthly  list of supplies  (i.e., 
gloves) issued to each participating unit in both groups from their distribution departments. To 
estimate the return on investment of using universal gloving, we will also estimate the potential 
savings that result from a decrease in C. difficile infections and colonization. We will compare 
estimated HAI costs obtained from the literature before and after the intervention. We will 
estimate HAI costs based on published reports.[ADDRESS_1206880]: Surveys of patients will be used to assess perception of provider - 
patient contact [CONTACT_865257]. Survey results will be compared 
between the control or intervention group to determine if the intervention may be impacting 
patient  satisfaction  with their care.  Surveys  will be conducted  during  the patient’s  stay in the unit 
and may be returned to any member of their care team or left at the nurse’s station upon

Effective Date:  May 7, [ADDRESS_1206881]  all surveys  for analysis.  
Environmental Services Experience: Healthcare workers in environmental services will be 
surveyed to determine if the additional use of gloves in the unit may be impacting 
workflow/workload  (for example,  by [CONTACT_865258]). Surveys may be returned to a secure location (e.g. a drop box) and the local research 
assistant will collect all surveys from this location for analysis.

research will be complemented with standard data collected by [CONTACT_865259].  
We will work with the LSI and RA at each site to develop a site -specific plan for transmitting 
these  metrics,  i.e., whether  the Madison  study  team  will download  these  aggregate  data from

trigger  suspension  of the study.  If we find significant negative  impacts,  we will notify  the site LSI 
to communicate issues with unit leadership and develop a response plan. For example, if hand 
hygiene compliance data show a significant negative impact upon introducing the intervention, 
we will work with the LSI and unit leadership to educate unit staff on the importance and 
workflow of hand hygiene in combination with gloving practices.

5.7.2  Statistical  Analyses  
Analyses  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_865261] (see above).  
Demographics: All unit level and patient level categorical demographic information will be 
summarized  on table  [ADDRESS_1206886] deviation or median plus range.  
C. difficile  acquisition  Rate:  Acquisition  rates  will be obtained  from each  unit and comparisons 
for differences between control and intervention units using a chi -squared test. We will 
conduct a crude and adjusted linear and logistic regression model to determine predictors of 
C.diff acquisition in patients. Additionally, we will model the incidence of C.diff acquisition for 
intervention and control patients using Poison regression models and to determine the 
gloving impact.  
CDI Infection  Rate:  For unit-level data,  we will compare  changes  in CDI infection  rates  between 
the intervention and control units using the chi -squares test or Fisher’s exact test with post -hoc 
pairwise comparisons. For patient -level data, infection rates will be modelled for specific time 
periods (during 3,  6, 9 and 12 months;  or every  3 months  of the study  period  [up to 24 months]) 
using incidence split modeling to determine the point of highest infection within each unit, with 
appropriate covariate adjustment. We will use the Royston’s trend test to conduct a time -trend 
analysis for  CDI infection rates for specific time periods (during 3,  6, 9 and 12 months;  or every 
3 months of the study period).  
Other  HAI Rates:  All other  rates  between  intervention  and control  units will be compared  using 
chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test, with post -hoc pairwise comparisons. All incidence and 
risk analysis will be conducted using  Poisson regression models with  covariate  adjustment. 
For specific time periods (during 3, 6, 9 and 12 months; or every 3 months of the study 
period), we will use incidence split modeling to determine the point of highest infection within 
each unit, with appropriate covariate adjustment. We will use the Royston’s trend test to 
conduct a time -trend analysis on the monthly HAI (CAUTI and CLABSI).  
 
Length  of Stay:  A weighted  two-sample and  paired  t-test will be used  to compare  mean  length  of 
stay between the intervention and control units.  
30-Day Mortality: Using patient level data, we will conduct a [ADDRESS_1206887] of mortality for control and intervention units using a cox proportional 
hazards model  with Kaplan Meier curves. Within each unit, a risk analysis will be conducted to  

VA Central IRB 
Effective Date:  May 7, 2024   determine the predictors  of 30 -day mortality. Additionally, we will examine survival 
percentages at specific periods of the  intervention period (i.e. 3, 6, 9 and 12  months; or every 
3 months of the intervention period) using life tables and log -rank tests to determine at which 
points mortality was highest for each unit.  
Other clinical outcomes: Rates of toxic megacolon and colectomy will be compared between 
intervention and control units using chi -squared test or Fisher’s exact test, with post -hoc 
pairwise comparisons. All incidence and risk analysis will be conducted using Poisson 
regression models with covariate adjustment. For specific time periods (during 3, 6, 9 and 12 
months), we will use incidence split model to determine the point of highest infection within 
each unit, with appropriate covariate adjustment. We will use the Royston’s trend test to 
conduct a time -trend analysis on the monthly outcomes.  
Intervention Fidelity: We will calculate the  compliance rates  for both the intervention  and control 
units and compare them using a chi -squared test. We will conduct a univariate logistical 
regression model to determine the odds of compliance with respect to additional unit 
characteristics  such  as number  of beds  and location.  Monthly  compliance  will be modeled  using 
a time series graphing technique with trend analysis estimates.  
Isolation Days of Care: Monthly aggregate data of isolation patients will be collected from 
infection control at participating sites which are collected as standard of care and we will 
estimate the days of care by [CONTACT_865262]. We will make  comparisons  between  the intervention  and control  groups  using 
the analysis of variance (ANOVA).  
Healthcare Worker Experience: After verification of transcription accuracy, team members will 
use VA -approved software to facilitate data organization, coding, and retrieval. Qualitative 
content analysis will inductively generate codes and categories rather than using an a priori 
coding  scheme  or researcher -generated  coding  scheme.41 Line by [CONTACT_865263] (level I coding). Codes that emerge will be grouped 
into larger categories (level II, coding for themes).  
Patient Experience : After verification of transcription accuracy, team members will use VA - 
approved software to facilitate data organization, coding, and retrieval. Qualitative content 
analysis will inductively generate codes and categories rather than using an a priori coding 
scheme  or researcher -generated  coding  scheme.41,42 Line by [CONTACT_865264] (level I coding). Codes that emerge will be grouped 
into larger categories (level II, coding for themes).  
Cost: Descriptive statistics will be used to describe nursing time frequencies and 
percentages.  Paired  t-tests  will be used  to compare  average  provider  time for donning  and 
doffing between the intervention and control units. We will use Royston’s trend test to 
examine the monthly costs of supplies over time.  
Provider -Patient  Contact  [CONTACT_627015] : We will compare  the differences  in reported  contact  [CONTACT_865265].  
Missing  data:  We will resolve  all missing  data using  a case-wise analysis  technique  or multiple 
imputation solution.  
5.9 Withdrawal  of Subjects  
Sites that are unable to meet performance measures such as a) obtaining a high rate of stool 
samples  from admitted  patients  and b) collecting  primary  and secondary  endpoint  data may be 
withdrawn from the study at the PI’s discretion.  
A unit may withdraw voluntarily from the study at any point. Attempts will be made to collect all 
data for the duration of their participation in the intervention phase regardless if they were unit 
randomized  to the intervention  or standard  care group  including  30-day mortality  occurring  after 
participant withdraw or termination.  
VA Central IRB 
Effective Date:  May 7, [ADDRESS_1206888] medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
intervention  in humans,  whether  or not considered  intervention -related  (21 CFR 312.32  (a)). An 
adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life - 
threatening experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a 
persistent or  significant incapacity or disability, or  a manifestation of a  congenital anomaly/birth 
defect. An AE is also considered serious when medical, surgical, behavioral, social, or other 
intervention is required to prevent an above outcome.  
 
All AEs will be assessed  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_865184]:  
 
• Mild – Events  require  minimal  or no treatment  and do not interfere  with the 
participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate  – Events  result  in a low level of inconvenience  or concern  with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require  
systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life - 
threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate 
to “serious”.  
 
All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_188718]/her 
clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories 
below.  
• Related  – There  is clear  evidence  to suggest  a causal  relationship,  and other  possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out.  
• Probably  Related  – There  is evidence  to suggest  a causal  relationship,  and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely.  
• Possibly  Related  – There  is some  evidence  to suggest  a causal  relationship  (e.g.,  the 
event occurred within a reasonable time  after intervention). However, other factors may 
have  contributed  to the event  (e.g.,  the participant’s  clinical  condition,  other  concomitant 
events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can 
be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or 
“definitely related,” as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, 
whose temporal relationship to study participation makes a causal relationship 
improbable  (e.g.,  the event  did not occur  within  a reasonable  time after administration  of 
the trial medication) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease 
provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant treatments).  
• Not Related  – The AE is completely  independent  of study  participation,  and/or  evidence 
exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
All SAEs  that are unexpected  and related  to the study  will be reported  by [CONTACT_865266]:  May 7, [ADDRESS_1206889] be 
followed until it is resolved or can be explained satisfactorily.  
 
Any death  that is unanticipated  and potentially  related  to the research  will be immediately 
reported to the IRB by [CONTACT_3476].  
 
6.3 Unanticipated  Problems  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems 
involving  risks to participants  or others  to include,  in general,  any incident,  experience,  or 
outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected  in terms  of nature,  severity,  or frequency  given  (a) the research  procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) -approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related”  
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including  physical,  psychological,  economic,  or social  harm)  than was previously  known 
or recognized.  
 
Serious  Problems  that are both unanticipated  and related  to the research  will be reported  in 
writing within 5 days of becoming aware of the occurrence.

rooms and/or over the phone, with both parties in a private setting. Patient interviewers will 
undergo  training  around  human  subject’s  protection,  the interview  guide,  and engaging  patients 
in a sensitive, respectful manner that promotes patients’ engagement in the interview.  
Furthermore,  interviewers  will participate  in role playing  to prepare  for interviews  and an expert 
qualitative researcher will observe their first actual interviews. The importance of privacy and 
discretion will be emphasized to participants during the sessions.  
Researchers will notify participants that they are recording. Participants will be asked not to 
identify their names or other identifying information during interviews. Audio files will only be 
labeled with a unique number will be generated for each patient and healthcare worker and 
linked to a different unique letter representing the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5120]. This identifier will be for 
purposes  of this study  only and will not include  individually  identifiable  private  information.  Data 
will be stored in a password -protected database and accessed only by [CONTACT_865268] -protected computers in locked offices. Only aggregate data will be 
analyzed and presented; patient -, worker -, or facility -specific data will not be identified.  
 
The Centralized Transcription Services Program (CTSP), based at the Salt Lake City VA, will 
transcribe interviews/focus groups. The CTSP will remove all identifying information, such as 
name [CONTACT_865275], from the transcript prior to analysis. An investigator will 
upload  the tapes  to a transcriptionist  at CTSP.  Multiple  levels  of security  will ensure  the integrity 
and confidentiality of all data stored on the system. The computer system operates entirely 
within the VA network, which is protected by [CONTACT_865269].  
Authorized  study  team  members  are assigned  an active,  individually  unique  user identification 
code  and individually  unique  password.  The accounts  and passwords  comply  with existing  VA 
policies  and procedures  for computer  access.  User  identification  codes  limit access  to specific 
directories and files. The computer system is accessed via computers assigned to authorized 
investigators. These computers are secured through use of individually unique user 
identification codes and passwords.  
 
All audio files, field notes files, and transcript files will be stored and transferred within the VA 
network which is protected by [CONTACT_865269]. Only approved 
study  team  members  and transcribers  will have  access  to the audio  files.  The recordings  will be 
appropriately destroyed at the end of the study, and the coded transcripts will be maintained 
according to VA policy.  
 
Clinical Data Collection. Only the local site and minimum Madison staff necessary for 
replacing  individual  identifiers  in patient -level data with the study  ID number  will have  access  to 
patient information, for example, the code key connecting patient name [CONTACT_865276]. All remaining data transferred to the Madison VA, including stool samples, will be 
coded. Each  participant will be  assigned a  unique study  ID, and all research  data will be coded 
with ID numbers only, not names or social security numbers. The document (“key”) linking 
names and ID numbers will be stored in a separate password -protected document on a 
password -protected server, to which only essential study staff (LSI, RA, and Madison staff 
responsible for coding patient -level data) will have access.  
VA Central IRB 
Effective Date:  May 7, 2024   Unless otherwise specified as part of a valid DUA, research data for purposes of statistical 
analysis and scientific reporting will be stored at the Madison VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. All identifiable data 
will be  stored in locked drawers/file cabinets in the  Madison VA Research Office or on a  secure, 
password -protected server space in a research folder accessible only to trained and approved 
study  personnel.  All research  data will be de- identified  (i.e., all personally  identifying  information 
will be removed) prior to transfer to external parties of a valid DUA, data analysis and 
manuscript  preparation;  all identifiers  will be replaced  by [CONTACT_706101]. All documents  and databases 
will be stored on a secure server behind the VA firewall, and housed within a password - 
protected folder only accessible to approved research team members (unless otherwise 
specified by a valid DUA).  
 
We will work with sites to determine their preferred method of data collection/transfer; i.e., 
whether  the Madison  study  team  will download  these  aggregate  data from the Corporate  Data 
Warehouse or whether the local study  team will upload these data to  the Madison study team 
using  VA-secure  methods  behind  the VA firewall.  Regardless  of collection/transfer  method,  all 
data will be kept behind the VA firewall at all times unless otherwise  specified in  a valid DUA. 
No study data will be shared in a non - secure manner. All data will be shared in accordance 
with VA regulations and via methods approved by [CONTACT_865270] (e.g., as outlined in a 
Enterprise Research Data Security Plan signed by [CONTACT_865271]). All culture samples will be sent to the coordinating site at the central microbiology 
research laboratory at the Wm. S. Middleton Memorial VA Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. No patient identifiers will 
be received by [CONTACT_2237], and no individual results will be shared back with 
facilities.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1206893]  an assigned  site PI (Local  Site Investigator,  LSI) and a 
Research Assistant (RA, 20% effort). These individuals will be responsible for 
monitoring local oversight and approvals, notifying appropriate stakeholders (including 
the facility director) about the study and its progress, and ensuring compliance to the 
study protocol. The LSI and RA will maintain a local site study binder with up -to-date 
documents and relevant approvals. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_865187].  
The LSIs and RAs will meet regularly with the Madison -based study team, including 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_865188]. Regular agenda items for these meetings will include 
discussing any Serious Adverse Events, Unanticipated Problems, interim results, or 
other  factors  that may impact  conduct  of the study.  Any changes  to the protocol  will be 
discussed during this meeting to ensure understanding and compliance with updated 
procedures.  
The Program Manager will be responsible for maintaining and updating a shared 
SharePoint  site that houses  up-to-date study  documents,  such as the protocol.  Approved 
site personnel will have access to this SharePoint so that they can access the most 
current versions as needed. The Program Manager will notify site personnel by [CONTACT_865272]. The 
LSI and RA will be responsible for updating local binders (digital and/or physical) as 
required and reporting any changes or issues to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_865188].  
Site participation  will end at the close  of the up-to-24-month  intervention  period  and

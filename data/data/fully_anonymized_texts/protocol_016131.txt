IND 73,059  CONFIDENTIAL  STUDY SYNOPSIS Title: A Double Blind Randomized Placebo Controlled Study of CM-AT for the Treatment of Autism in Children With All Levels of Fecal Chymotrypsin Protocol Number: [ZIP_CODE] Development Phase: III Number of Study Centers: Approximately 35 clinical sites in the [LOCATION_002] Number of Subjects:  Approximately three-hundred (300) patients will be randomized Estimated Study Length: Approximately 36 months, contingent upon meeting accrual targets Duration of Treatment and Study Participation: 12 weeks, following a 2-week blinded drug run-in period. Patient Population: The study population will consist of children, both males and females, between 3 and 8 years of age inclusive at the time of consent, who are diagnosed with Autistic Disorder (AD) by [CONTACT_2681]-IV-TR and ADI-R, and are screened by [CONTACT_365742].  Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration: CM-AT (pancreatic enzyme concentrate encapsulated in hydrogenated soybean oil) 900mg 3x daily sprinkled over food. To be taken with a meal or large snack.  Study Methodology: This is a Phase III multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of CM-AT in pediatric patients with autism at all levels of fecal chymotrypsin. Study Design: In this Phase III multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, all study participants must have an initial ABC-I score of > [ADDRESS_457477] achieve a score of > 15 to be considered eligible. Those subjects who qualify will be given a two week blinded drug run-in. Subjects will then be evaluated for compliance and re-evaluated for level of Irritability with the ABC-I scale. If their score on the ABC-I scale has increased by 30% or more or decreased by 30% or more, or is <9, they will be discontinued from the study.  If all entry criteria are met, the subject will be randomized at the Visit 1/Baseline visit.  Study Rationale:           Sponsor studies have demonstrated the clinical potential of CM-AT formulations in treating core and non-core autism symptoms in subjects with autism ages 3-8 with low fecal chymotrypsin (FCT) levels when dosed at a level of 900mg 3x daily.  This study will further quantify the changes in the target population as measured by [CONTACT_365743], physiological measures, as well as characterize the efficacy and safety of the product. The study will further delineate the efficacy in a population that is biomarker negative (>12.6U/g of fecal chymotrypsin) who have autism.  The data from this study will help determine safety and efficacy of CM-AT in pediatric patients with autism of both biomarkers positive and negative.  
CUREMARK (CM-AT)  Amendment 5 Protocol: [ZIP_CODE]/Autism  February 17, [ADDRESS_457478]: subscale for Irritability / Agitation (ABC-I) >11 is at Screening/Enrollment. This number represents those who fall above approximately 0.5 std deviations from the mean seen in the Sponsor’s [ZIP_CODE] study.  Safety: Fecal globin levels, the presence of occult blood, α1-antitrypsin, and weight loss will be used to monitor the safety and tolerability of CM-AT.  • The presence of fecal globin may indicate bleeding in the large intestine, while a positive occult blood may indicate bleeding along the entire gastrointestinal tract.  • An increase in α1-antitrypsin may signal an immunologic response of the colonic mucosa, leading to potential formation of colonic strictures. • Weight loss may be indicative of malabsorption.  • All of the above markers may be linked due to gastrointestinal irritation, but have not specifically been noted thus far in the Sponsor’s experience with enzyme therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  • Parental input at the standard visits, diary entries, and other assessments will also be used to monitor safety.  • Of 468 children with autism given pancreatic enzymes in early Sponsor studies, and in the Phase III clinical studies ([ZIP_CODE] & [ZIP_CODE]), in which 180 were initially enrolled, and 140 continued into Open-Label, the drug appeared to be safe and well-tolerated with no related SAE experienced in either study the duration of which has been greater than 288 weeks. Primarily, AEs appeared to be GI in nature. Rating Instruments: ABC, SRS-2 (Preschool or School Age), PedsQL Inventory – Family Impact Module, CGI (S), CGI (I). Other measures: DSM-IV, SCQ and ADI-R.

IND 73,059  CONFIDENTIAL   Statistical Considerations:  The sample size is based on (a) the primary efficacy variable of the change from baseline to week [ADDRESS_457487] (ABC) subscale for Irritability; (b) the primary analysis set of low-level fecal chymotrypsin  (FCT) ≤ 12.6 Units/gram randomized subjects; and (c) a 1:1 randomization scheme.  Assuming a mean ± standard deviation decrease in ABC Irritability from baseline to week 12 of 3.7 ± 7 for CM-AT and 0.6 ± 5 for Placebo, a sample size of 82 evaluable low-level subjects per treatment group yields 90% power to declare a statistically significant difference between treatments at a two-sided 0.05 level of significance.  Assuming 15% premature withdrawal, 97 low-level subjects will be randomized.  In order to achieve 97 randomized low- level subjects per group, a total of 162 subjects per group will be randomized (based on previous data indicating 60% of autistic children are low-level).     Primary analyses (assessing CM-AT vs. Placebo difference) on change from baseline to week 12 will be estimated from a Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) across all visits assuming the unstructured within-subject correlation structure. Included in the model will be the main effects of randomized treatment group, visit, baseline ABC irritability, study center and the treatment-by-visit interaction effect.  Analyses with and without imputation for missing data will be performed. If statistical significance, in favor of CM-AT, is shown on the primary efficacy endpoint in the primary analysis set of low-level randomized patients (FCT ≤ 12.6 Units/gram), the study will be considered to be a success statistically. The secondary efficacy variable is change from baseline to week 12 in ABC Lethargy/ Social Withdrawal (ABC-L) of low-level randomized patients (FCT ≤ 12.6 Units/gram). As an exploratory analysis, the MMRM analyses will be repeated on the ABC-I and ABC-L for the non-low-level FCT randomized patients (FCT > 12.6 Units/gram) As an additional exploratory analysis, the above MMRM analyses will be repeated on the ABC-I and ABC-L on all randomized patients in a similar manner as for the low-level randomized patients. For safety, fecal globin levels, the presence of occult blood, α1-antitrypsin, and weight loss will be used to monitor the safety and tolerability of CM-AT.  These safety measures will be presented descriptively by [CONTACT_1570].  No formal statistical comparisons will be carried out.

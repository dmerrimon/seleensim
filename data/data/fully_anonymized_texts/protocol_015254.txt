blind, placebo -controlled, single ascending dose study (722/1121) to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics  (PK), safety , tolerability  and exploratory efficacy of SI-722 when 
administered by [CONTACT_808958]/BPS.  
1.2 Nonclinical and Clinical Studies  
A summary of nonclinical studies and prior clinical studies of SI-722 can be found in the current edit ion of the investigator’s brochure (IB). 
1.[ADDRESS_1118585] s 
1.3.1 Possible Risks 
Safety data obtained from nonclinical and clinical studies indicated that there were no major safety concerns and SI -722 has an acceptable safety prof ile.  
Based on the results of Phase1 study, dysuria, hematuria, and urethral irritation were identified as potential risks.  No severe or serious events related to the urinary system  were 
reported, but as a precaution, any changes of urinary function will be carefully monitored in the phase 1/ [ADDRESS_1118586] s with IC/BPS. Based on the 
results of the cystitis model in rats, SI -722 at doses  is expected to improve urina ry 
frequency and ameliorate symptoms of bladder pain in IC/BPS subject s.  When  
 the SI-722 is instilled into the bladder, 
urinary frequency and bladder pain may be improved.

3.1 Study Design  
This is  a Phase 1/2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose 
study in IC/BPS subject s. 
3.2 Dosage/Dose Regimen 
Eligible subjects will be assigned to one of four treatment cohorts of SI -722 or placebo in a 
6:2 ratio:  
• Cohort 1 =  of SI -722 or placebo ( ) 
• Cohort 2 =  of SI -722 or placebo ( ) 
• Cohort 3 =  of SI -722 or placebo ( ) 
• Cohort 4 =  of SI -722 or placebo ( ) 
3.3 Duration of Study  
Screening  visit ( assessment  in site): Day  -28 to Day -7 
Screening period  (assessment by [CONTACT_808949]) : Day -7 to Day -1 
Investigational d rug administration : Day 1  
Follow-up and evaluation phase: Day  1 (Post -dose) to Day  [ADDRESS_1118587] s 
A total 32 subjects (SI -722 group: 24 subjects, placebo group: 8 subjects) 
 
3.5 Randomization 
Randomization will be utilized to minimize bias in study evaluations.   On Day 1, s ubjects 
will be randomized to SI-722 or placebo in a 6:2 ratio within four treatment cohorts.  
Cohorts will be filled sequentially as subjects are determined to  be eligible during Screening.  
An unblinded Safety Review Committee (SRC) will evaluate the safety and tolerability of SI-722 1 week after administration for each cohort before advancing to the next higher dose.

therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings 
and the cystoscopy), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of IP, whether 
or not considered related to the product. 
All AEs occur ring after obtaining written informed consent will be documented in the subject  
source record and eCRF.   Concomitant illnesses that existed before entry into the study will 
not be considered AEs unless they worsen after IP administration.  All AEs, regardless of 
the source of identification ( eg, laboratory assessments, cystoscopy findings, subject  reports) 
must be documented. Pre-existing conditions will be recorded in the subject  source record and eCRF on the 
medical history or appropriate page.  
TEA E will be defined as an AE that begins or that worsens in severity after IP has been 
administered.  
All AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
terminology.  
AE will be reported by [CONTACT_423]  (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
subject’s legally authorized representative).  
The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or study procedures, or that caused the subject  to discontinue the study treatment (see Section  5.1 and 5.2).

This category also includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit ( eg, from a standard -of-care unit to 
an acute/intensive care unit).  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]: 
• Rehabilitation facilities, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593], or respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] ( eg, caregiver relief)  
• Nursing homes o r skilled nursing facilities

• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78429], social, and/or convenience admissions 
• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures, which should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the individual subject  
10.3 Cystoscopy, Vital Signs , Electrocardiograms  and Laboratory Tests 
If an abnormal findings of cystoscopy, vital signs , ECG s or laboratory tests  are observed, the 
Investigator should judge whether it is an AE or not by [CONTACT_315749]: 
• When any medical intervention such as pharmacotherapy or surgical care is performed in order to improve the abnormality 
• Other than case above, when investigator judges that the abnormality is medically important and should be considered an AE 
10.4 Process for Collecting Adverse E vents and Serious A dverse Event s Information 
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF continuously until Day  29 as 
specified in the Schedule of Activities ( See Table 1). 
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the medical history/current medical conditions section in the eCRF not the AE section. 
All SAEs during study treatment period will be reco rded and reported to the Sponsor or 
designee within [ADDRESS_1118642] on Screening, Day  1 (pre -dose), 
Day 2, Day 3, Day 5, Day 8, Day 15 and  Day  29 or an early withdrawal visit.  Investigators 
should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses.

reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor. 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 12. 
10.5 Method of Detecting A dverse E vents and Serious A dverse Event s 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs.  Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrences.  
10.6 Follow- up of A dverse E vents and Seri ous A dverse Event s 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each subject  
at subsequent visits/contacts.  All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the 
event is otherwise explained, or the subject  is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  5.3). 
Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 12. 
10.7 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for S erious A dverse Event s 
Prompt notification (within 24 hours) by [CONTACT_46352] a SAE is essential 
so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subject s and the 
safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met.  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies ab out the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation.  The 
Sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements relating to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB, and Investigators. 
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to Investigators as necessary.  
An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing a SAE or other speci fic 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
10.[ADDRESS_1118644] s which occur during the study, will be collected. 
If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. 
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.

site staff to mitigate risks and suggested measures to modify operations.  Each Investigator may choose to implement different measures according to their sites’ operations; which may include, but are not limited to the following items.  
 
18.1 Screening Questions to Identify Potential COVID -19 Exposure 
When scheduling an on-site visit for subjects, consider asking the subjects a few, short 
questions regarding potential exposure to COVID-19 before their on- site visit (in -person 
interactions).  For example:  
1. Have you had any of the following symptoms in the past [ADDRESS_1118656], existing chronic medical condition, etc. 
• Fever greater than 100.4 dgrees Fahrenheit  
• Cough 
• Difficulty breathing  
• Sore throat 
2. In the last [ADDRESS_1118657] you lived with, visited, cared for, or been in a room for a 
prolonged period of time with someone who is under investigation or has been confirmed for COVID -19? 
 
18.[ADDRESS_1118658] has completed all Screening Visit procedures and is eligible to proceed to Study 
Day 1 but cannot do so within the allotted timeframe of 28  days, it will be consider ed to 
extend  the visit window on a case by [CONTACT_413].  The BPIC/SS questionnaire must be 
repeated to ensure it is valid and within [ADDRESS_1118659] Research Organization ( CRO ) and may necessitate approval by [CONTACT_10748]’s Medical Monitor and Sponsor.

be completed  via phone, as necessary by [CONTACT_808971]: 
1. Medical history  
2. IC/BPS history and treatment history  
3. Concomitant medication and therapy inf ormation  
4. Adverse events  
5. PRO questionnaires (BPIC- SS, ICSI/PI [INVESTIGATOR_808948])

Version 4.0 Site staff  will capture the above in the source documents and promptly notify CRO and 
Clinical Research Associate (CRA)  of the partial phone visit as soon as possible.  All 
missing data,  and the phone visit itself, will be considered protocol deviations.  Site staff 
will need to complete additional forms for IRB submission and state "COVID -19" in the 
comment column of the deviation log. 
 
18.[ADDRESS_1118661] or stay at home mandates, sites’ change in 
operations, and a number of other reasons to try to contain the spread of the virus and minimize exposure, it is reasonable to conduct monitoring visits remotely, instead of in-person, whenever feasibl e.  Site staff/Investigator will work with CRO and the assigned 
CRA to define and understand the logistics of the remote visit such as source data verification.

Version 4.0 Appendix 2  Pain Score 0- 10 Numerical Rating Scale  
The NRS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults, including those with 
chronic pain due to rheumatic diseases.  
The NRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0–10 integer s) that best reflects the intensity of his/her 
pain.  Respondents are most commonly asked to report pain intensity “in the last 24 hours” or an average pain intensity.  The common format is a horizontal bar or line. Similar to the 
VAS, the NRS is anchored by [CONTACT_808972].  
The 11-point NRS ranges from ‘0’ representing 1 pain extreme ( eg, “no pain”) to ‘10’ 
representing the other pain extreme ( eg, “pain as bad as you can imagine” or “worst pain 
imaginable”).  
Subjects will select the level that best describes their maximum and average bladder pain over the last 24 hours, and their  bladder pain at the moment, respectively.

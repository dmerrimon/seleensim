AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/2007 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07  1 1.0 BACKGROUND/RATIONALE  
Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS) is a disease of multi-focal vascular proliferation, which 
predominantly involves the skin, but can also involve the vi sceral organs. AIDS related 
KS is associated with co-infection with th e HIV virus and Kaposi’s Sarcoma herpes virus 
(KSHV) (or Human Herpes virus-8).[1] Histologically, these lesions  appear as clusters of 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_86853]-shaped cells (KS spi[INVESTIGATOR_86854] e cells), vessels and a variable inflammatory infiltrate. 
These tumors rely on a number of cytoki nes for growth including interleukin-1, 
interleukin-6, vascular endotheli al growth factor (VEGF), basic-fibroblast growth factor 
(b-FGF), stem cell factor (SCF) and platelet  derived growth factor (PDGF), which act by 
[CONTACT_86920].[2-8] 
Several studies have suggested a role for PDGF and c-kit receptors in KS. When KS 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_86855] α and β  PDGF receptors.[9] Cultured KS 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_86856]-depleted media, and this arrest can be 
mitigated by [CONTACT_86921].[10] Some of the unanswered questions 
for these studies are whether the cultured cells  reflect the KS spi[INVESTIGATOR_86857]. Indeed only β PDGF-R appears to be 
expressed in tumor specimens as assayed by [CONTACT_86922].[6] PDGF is not expressed by [CONTACT_86923] e spi[INVESTIGATOR_86858], but rather by a 
distinct subpopulation of cells in the KS lesion.[6] 
Once the role of KHSV was elucidated, mode l systems that use dermal microvasculature 
endothelial cells (DMVEC) were developed to study the effect of  KSHV infection on 
gene expression. KSHV infection of DMVECs results in a 5-fold up regulation of the c-
kit receptor[8] and results in a 4-fold change in levels of β PDGF-R transcripts while α 
PDGF-R levels remain unchanged as a ssayed by [CONTACT_86924] (unpublished data, AV 
Moses, pers. comm.). In the prior study it was also demonstrated  that KSHV-infected 
endothelial cell cultures prolif erate in response to the ligand of c-kit, SCF, which is 
basally expressed by [CONTACT_86925].[8] Additionally, PDGF had been shown to induce the 
expression of VEGF by [CONTACT_86926][INVESTIGATOR_86858].[7] It is possible that PDGF-R and c-kit 
are involved in two critical pathways in KS development; induction of growth of KS 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_86859]. This potential role of PDGF-
R and c-kit in the developmen t of KS makes inhibition of these receptors an attractive 
therapeutic target.  
1.1 Gleevec®  
1.1.1 General Information 
Imatinib is a signal transduction  inhibitor (STI) approved by [CONTACT_86927] (FDA) for use in patients 
with newly diagnosed chronic my eloid leukemia (CML) or CML in 
blast crisis, accelerated phase, or in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alfa therapy.
[11] In preclinical studi es, Gleevec was found to 
be a potent inhibitor of BCR-ABL as  well as PDGF-R and the c-Kit 
receptor. Since its approval, imatinib  has been shown to be beneficial 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/2007 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07  2 in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), which is dependent on c-Kit 
as well as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberns and hypereosinophilic syndrome, which are dependent on the PDGF pathway.[12,13] The 
availability of imatinib, which inhibits both the PDGF and c-kit 
receptors, allows us to test clinical  utility of inhibiting these receptors 
to treat KS. Imatinib is highly bioavailable as an oral formulation. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of Gleevec has been evaluated in healthy 
subjects and in population pharm acokinetic studies in over [ADDRESS_94689]-dose. Mean absolute bioavailability is 98%. Following oral administrati on in healthy volunteers, the 
elimination half-lives of imatinib and its major active metabolite, the N-desmethyl derivative, were approximately 18 and 40 hours, 
respectively. Mean imatinib AU C increased proportionally with 
increasing dose in the range 25–1000 mg. There were no significant 
changes in the PK of imatinib on repeated dosing, and accumulation is 1.5-2.5 fold at steady state when Gleevec is dosed once daily. At 
clinically relevant concentrations of imatinib, binding to plasma 
proteins is approximately 95% in  vitro, mostly to albumin and α1-acid 
glycoprotein. CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for 
metabolism of imatinib. Other cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C 19, play a minor role in its 
metabolism. 
1.1.2 Safety Data 
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia 
The majority of Gleevec-treated pa tients experienced adverse events 
(AEs) at some time. Most events were  of mild to moderate grade, but 
drug was discontinued for AEs in 2% of patients in chronic phase, 3% 
in accelerated phase a nd 5% in blast crisis. The most frequently 
reported drug-related AEs were na usea, vomiting, diarrhea, edema, 
and muscle cramps (see Table 1 for newly diagnosed CML patients 
and Table 2 for other CML patient s). Edema was most frequently 
periorbital or in lower limbs and was managed with diuretics, other 
supportive measures, or by [CONTACT_86928]. The 
frequency of severe superficial edema was 0.9-5%.

With the exception of grade1/2 ed ema (but not grade 3/4), there were no obvious di fferences in the incidence of AEs in patients  treated at [ADDRESS_94692] th at many patients were dose-escalated ove r time and in all 
studies AEs were analyzed according to starting dose. Patients aged ≥65 years also experienced a higher incidence of edema. 
Less than 50% of patients required dose reduction at any time. Te mporary treatment interruptions were required in 25-40% of pat ients. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_86860], the overall median dose- intensity (expressed in mg/day) in each study remained close to the initially plann ed dose. 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/2007 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07  5 Cardiotoxicity 
Gleevec has been shown to be cardiotoxic in humans in an 
examination of ten individuals who developed significant left 
ventricular dysfunction, thus, cong estive heart failure (CHF), during 
their course of therapy. All ten indi viduals with CML had normal left 
ventricular function before Gleevec therapy was instituted (ejection 
fraction 56+ 7%). Following treatment (mean of 7.2+ 5.4 months [range 
1-14 months]), patients had a signifi cantly lower ejection fraction of 
25+8% (P< 0.001) and presented with a significant volume overload 
and symptoms corresponding to a [LOCATION_001] Heart Association 
(NYHA) class 3-4 heart failure.[21] Myocardial biopsies performed on 
two of the patients who had no hist ory of coronary disease showed 
prominent membrane whorls in the myocytes, which has been reported 
to be characteristic of toxin-induced myopathies. 
In patients treated with Gleevec on NCI-sponsored trials, the rate of high grade left ventricular systolic function was low (approximately 0.2%), based on AE data available from 1223 patients. However, when edema was reported on the basis of a cardiac cause, the rate of Grade 
3/4 edema considered likely related to Gleevec was 1.3% among the [ADDRESS_94693] iac AEs considered less likely 
related to Gleevec included cardi ac ischemia/infarction (0.08%), 
hypertension (1%), and hypotension (0.7%). Nonclinical data support the evidence of Gleevec induced 
cardiotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. When healthy mice were 
treated to evaluate the cardiotoxicity of Gleevec, transmission electron 
micrographs of samples from the h earts of three drug-treated mice 
showed results similar to those s een in studies of individuals on 
Gleevec, including membrane whorls in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and in or immediately adjacent to m itochodria. Treatment of mice with 
200 mg/kg/day led to a significant dete rioration in contractile function 
(P <0.003) and moderate left ventri cular dilation after 3-[ADDRESS_94694] that Gleevec treatme nt has shown in 
human subjects.  
1.1.3 Clinically Important Adverse Events 
Because of their relative frequency and clinical significance, several 
AEs occurring during the Phase II le ukemia trials were analyzed in 
greater detail, as summarized below. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Edema and Fluid Retention 
Superficial edema was one of th e most frequently reported 
AEs but was rarely severe (2-5% Grade 3/4). The most 
frequently involved sites incl uded the periorbital region, 
face and lower limbs. The edema usually appeared within 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/2007 
NCI Version Date 07/24/[ADDRESS_94695] 2 months of treatment.  A minority of patients with 
severe edema required dose reduction.  
A minority (<5%) of patients de veloped central collections 
of fluid (described collectively using the term ‘fluid 
retention’) including one or more of the following: CHF, 
pleural effusion, ascites, pericardial effusion and 
pulmonary edema. It is unc lear if the mechanisms 
underlying peripheral edema a nd fluid retention are the 
same. Fluid retention was usua lly managed with diuretics 
and/or dose reduction, or with temporary treatment interruption.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal and CNS Hemorrhages 
In toxicology studies, imatinib was shown to be a local 
irritant, and for that reas on, the pattern of GI tract 
hemorrhages was carefully reviewed. These events were rare, and severe (Grade 3/4)  cases were reported only in 
advanced CML patients. GI hemorrhages occurred in 3-5% of patients with advanced CML,  and were considered drug-
related in 0-2% and severe in  <1.5%. Contributing factors 
such as severe thrombopeni a, the use of concomitant 
NSAIDS and a history of gast ric ulcer were present in 
most, but not all cases. Uppe r GI ulceration (esophageal, 
gastric or duodenal) or gastri tis/duodenitis were visualized 
at gastroscopy in approximately 50% of patients with GI bleeding. Less than 1% of patie nts discontinued therapy as 
a result of these events.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Cerebral hemorrhages (including subdural hematomas and hygromas) were also reported almost exclusively in advanced CML patients (1-7%). The majority occurred in the context of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_86861], with 
concomitant thrombocytopenia. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Skin rash 
An erythematous, pruritic, m aculopapular skin rash, most 
prominent over the forearms and trunk but occasionally 
present also on the face, was reported in up to 44% of 
patients treated with imatinib. Onset was generally within the first month of therapy. Eosi nophilia was rarely seen and 
skin biopsies showed the typi[INVESTIGATOR_86862] a toxic drug reaction with a mixed infi ltration of cells. Occasional 
patients reported pruritus without accompanying rash. In 
most cases, the rash was mild, easily manageable with antihistamines and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l steroids, and gradually 
subsided without interrup ting therapy. However, a 
troublesome skin rash was th e most frequent reason (in 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/2007 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07  7 <1% of patients overall) for the permanent discontinuation 
of therapy. Approximately 3% of patients developed severe skin rashes, some with an exfoliative component. Re-challenge was usually but not always positive. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypophosphatemia/Vitamin D deficiency 
Hypophosphatemia and low levels vitamin D have been 
reported to develop in patient s taking imatinib and other 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
[22] Imatinib may interfere with 
osteoclast function directly by [CONTACT_86929] β  
on osteoclasts or indirectly by [CONTACT_86930] C-FMS receptor. These abnorma lities were treated with 
Vitamin D and phosphate supplementation and did not require reducing the dose of imatinib. Additionally, they 
did not persist with the withdrawal of imatinib. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiac Toxicity 
Kerkela et al. recently reported 10 patients who had severe 
CHF.
[21] Cardiac biopsies showed mitochondrial changes 
consistent with drug toxicity and both clinical and pathologic effects could be repl icated in mice. The risk of 
severe cardiac toxicity has been estimated to be approximately 1%. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal Stomal Tumor (GIST) 
Treatment with Gleevec was generally well tolerated, 
although nearly every patient experienced minor AEs. The most frequently reported AEs were edema, nausea, 
diarrhea, musculoskeletal pai n, fatigue, rash, headache, and 
abdominal pain. Most events were of mild to moderate 
severity. Superficial edema, mo st frequently periorbital or 
lower limb edema was managed with diuretics, other supportive measures, or by [CONTACT_86931]. 
Severe (CTC grade 3/4) supe rficial edema was observed in 
two patients, including face edema in one patient. No major differences were seen in the severity of AEs between the 400 mg or 600 mg treatment groups, although overall incidence of AEs was somewhat higher in the 600 mg treatment group. AEs with a suspected relationship to therapy occurring in greater than 10 % of patients in any group are presented in Table 3.

1.1.4 Preclinical Studies 
As part of continuing preclinical  studies on imatinib, [COMPANY_001] 
completed the in-life part and the necropsy of 2–year oral (in feed) 
carcinogenicity study in rats at doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg. An 
increased incidence of palpable ma sses in the urogen ital region led to 
an accelerated histopathological an alysis of these organs. Target 
organs for neoplastic changes were  kidneys in both sexes, urinary 
bladder and preputial gland in males, and clitoral glands in females.  
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/2007 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07  9 A statistically significant increa se in renal benign and malignant 
tumors and the urinary bladder be nign tumors were noted only at 60 
mg/kg/day, representing approxi mately 1.74x to 4.14x human daily 
exposure (based on AUC) to imatinib  at the dose of 400 mg/day. In 
addition, a statistically significant increase in benign and malignant 
tumors of the preputial/clitoral gland was noted at 30 and 60

exposure (based on AUC) to imatin ib at the dose of 400 mg/day. 
1.1.5 Summary of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_86863] c-kit and PDGF-R 
activation in KS, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_86864], MA was initiated. Ten pa tients who were on stable doses of 
highly active anti-re troviral therapy (HAART) and who had failed first 
line KS therapy have been enrolled.  The primary goal of the trial was 
to confirm the expression of c-Kit and PDGF-R in KS lesions and to determine the activation status of the c-Kit and PDGF receptors in KS at baseline and after [ADDRESS_94698] data on the tolerability and clinical efficacy of imatinib in HIV–relate d KS. Patients were treated with 
imatinib 300 mg orally, twice daily with dose reduction permitted for toxicity. At baseline and at 4 week s, patients had tumor measurements, 
a 4 mm punch biopsy of a representa tive lesion and a plasma sample. 
Patients with a response at 4 weeks were allowed to continue therapy until disease progression. AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) criteria were used for clinical response. Five of [ADDRESS_94699] a 
partial response (PR) by [CONTACT_86932] [ADDRESS_94700] able disease. The median duration 
of therapy was 7 weeks (range 4 to 26 weeks). The majority of patients 
required dose reduction from 600 mg daily to 400 mg daily after 4 weeks of therapy. One patient had Grade 4 neutropenia that recurred 
after dose reduction. Five patients ha d diarrhea (three exhibited Grade 
3, and one Grade 4) that resolved with drug withdrawal. Two of these five patients with diarrhea had diarrh ea at baseline. Diarrhea returned 
with drug re-challenge, but was manageable with over-the-counter anti-diarrhea medications. No signi ficant change in CD4 counts or 
viral load was noted during therapy.  We hypothesize that the high rate of GI toxicity that was observed may 
be related to a PK interaction between imatinib and HAART. Imatinib is a substrate for the cytochrome p450 isoenzymes, cyp3A4 and cyp2D6. All of the protease inhibitors (PIs) in clinical use at the time of this study, which includes, am prenavir, indinavir, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], 
nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir ar e cyp3A4 inhibitors with ritonavir 
inhibiting cyp2D6 to a lesser extent. Diarrhea is a side effect common to all of the PIs. The other class of  antiretrovirals shown to affect the 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/2007 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07  10 p450 system is the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. 
Delavirdine is a cyp3A inhibitor while nevirapi [INVESTIGATOR_53553] a cyp3A inducer, 
and efavirenz is a mixed cyp3A i nducer/inhibitor. No relationship 
between any specific antiretrovira l regimen and the incidence of 
diarrhea was observed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  Plasma samples were analyzed to determine levels of imatinib and its major active metabolite, CGP-[ADDRESS_94701]. Merrill Egorin. At steady state the average imatinib concentration was 1,342 ng/mg (range 0 to 2,846 ng/mL) and CGP-[ZIP_CODE] was 733 ng/mL 
(range 459 to 1,046 ng/mL) (n=9). Thes e levels are low compared to 
CML patients on the same dose schedule, 2,939 ng/mg (range 2,009-3,497 ng/ml) and 733 ng/mL (range 459-1,046 ng/mL). Plasma concentrations of the antiretrovirals were not measured in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Although this data suggest there is not inhibition of imatinib 
metabolism, the imatinib concentrations may not be representative of the steady state concentration. The samples were a random sample from Day 28, and by [CONTACT_14713], all four patients with diarrhea had developed symptoms. The presence of the diarrh ea could have affected 
the absorption of imatinib as well as patient adherence to the therapy. Because of the high potential of  drug interactions in the HIV 
population the pharmacokinetics of imatinib in these patients still needs to be established.  We examined tumor biopsies usi ng immunohistochemistry (IHC) with 
phosphospecific antibodies to determin e the activation status of the 
PDGF and c-kit pathways. A major ity of protein kinases require 
phosphorylation of a serine/theronine or a tyrosine in the activation 
loop to allow kinase activity. Phos phospecific antibodies have been 
raised to a number of these sites an d are useful as surrogate markers of 
activity. We used phosphospecific anti bodies to PDGF-R and c-Kit as 
well as their downstream effector s, ERK1/ERK2 and AKT. Antibodies 
were used anti-c-Kit (Da ko); anti-PDGF-R, anti-phospho- β−PDGF-R 
(tyrosine 751), anti-phospho-AKT (serine 473) and anti-phospho-ERK 
(threonine 202/tyrosine 204) (Cel l Signaling, Beverly, MA). We have 
not yet found an anti-phospho-c-kit antibody that works reliably for IHC. Six patients had evaluable baseline IHC. All six patients 
demonstrated constitutive expression  of PDGF-R and c-Kit receptors. 
Four patients had biopsies at base line and [ADDRESS_94702] and downstream target of PDGF-R and c-kit. Activation of 
AKT was not seen at baseline or after treatment in any patients.

treatment but no significant changes in VEGF concentrations were 
seen. 
1.1.6 Dose Selection 
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], events requiring dose reductions were four cases of 
diarrhea and one case of neutro penia. After dose reduction the 
majority of patients with diarrhea had their symptoms controlled with over the counter medications. A dose of 400 mg a day has been shown 
to induce a 82% hematologic response rate in CML and a 57% response rate in GISTs.
[11,12] Once we began to aggressively manage 
the diarrhea with medication and dos e reduction to 400 mg per day, it 
no longer was a dose limiting toxicity. Based on our clinical experience, the majority of KS patients will tolerate 400 mg a day. 
1.2 Biologic/Correlative Studies
 
1.2.1 Expression/Activation (phosphorylati on) imatinib kinase targets and 
signaling intermediates. 
We will determine by [CONTACT_86933]-R in  biopsies from baseline and [ADDRESS_94704] of imatinib on the phosphorylat ion state of our targets we will 
examine biopsies at an earlier time point. We decided to biopsy 
patients at 8 days because the t
1/2 of imatinib is ~18 hours and the t 1/2 of 
it metabolite, CGP-[ZIP_CODE], is ~[ADDRESS_94705] ochemistry for all of these 
determinants except c-Kit receptor. 
1.2.2 Early Markers of Response 
Two to 3 months are often required to determine if a KS patient is 
responding to a therapeutic  agent. If early mark ers of response could 
be established that would allow physicians to determine with a degree 
of confidence which patients were go ing to respond, then patients who 
were not going to respond would be  free to pursue other treatment 
options.  
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/2007 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07  12 Because of the importance of cytoki nes, angiogenic factors and growth 
factors produced in KS, a number of recent KS therapeutic trials 
examined biologic endpoints to determine if they correlated with clinical response. All the studies to date ha ve looked at isolated 
biologic endpoints based on a priori  predictions regarding KS biology 
and/or the mechanism of action of th e drug being studied. In a trial of 
oral 9- cis retinoic  acid in KS, soluble Interl eukin-6 receptor (sIL6R) 
was significantly lower at baseline  in responders and IL-6 levels 
increased in responders.
[14] In a study of COL-3, a matrix 
metalloproteinase inhibitor, VEGF le vels were shown to decrease in 
responders while b-FGF remained unchanged.[15] These reports 
suggest concentrations of cytokine s/growth factors at baseline or 
changes in the concentrations afte r being on therapy may be used as 
predictors of response for KS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Because of the critical role cy tokines/chemokines play in KS 
development, we hypothesize that these growth factors would be useful biologic endpoints that may be predictive of response. In 
previous studies investigators ha d chosen two or three biological 
endpoints to examine. We will perform a proteomics-based screen for biologic endpoints. The reason for this  choice is two-fold: 1) This 
method allows us to simultaneously examine the majority cytokines and chemokines that are implicated in KS development and, 2) We have limited knowledge of which gr owth factors may be downstream 
of the PDGF-R and c-kit pathways in KS. The PerkinElmer Cytokine Chip is designed to analyze the following 
cytokines from a sample in a multiplexed fashion: 
 
 
Table 4.  Cytokines detected by [CONTACT_86934]-[ADDRESS_94706] curv es. These are used to estimate the 
concentration of each cytokine from the samples. After running the 
assay, slides were imaged using a ScanArray  Confocal Laser 
Scanner (PerkinElmer, Cambridge, MA ). After imaging, the resulting 
tif files were quantitated using QuantArray software (PerkinElmer, 
Cambridge, MA). The data was then exported as an Excel 2000 
worksheet and these are collated into a single workbook. An analysis macro was run that subtracts th e local background signal from the 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/2007 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07  13 signal of each spot. This method adjusts for any differences in 
background that may occur across an  array. The replicate spots are 
then averaged and tested for outliers using the ESD method (extreme 
studentized deviate; N=4; Crit ical Z=1.48). The standards were 
analyzed by [CONTACT_2929]-to-point linear regression and concentrations of 
experimental samples were estimated from these standards.  We will examine the cytokine profiles of patients at baseline, 7 days and 28 days to see if there is any correlation between baseline concentrations and clinical respons e. As noted the standards on the 
cytokine chip are analyzed by [CONTACT_2929]-to-point linea r regression and 
concentrations of experimental samples are estimated from these 
standards four-point curve. Thus, the chip should be considered a 
semi-quantitative assay and all cytokines/chemokines that appear to be potential predictors will  be confirmed by [CONTACT_6428]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Receptor Mutation Analysis 
Mutations of c-kit and PDGF-R have been shown to play a 
role in tumorigenesis and imatinib resistance. Activating mutations of c-Kit have been reported in mastocytosis, acute myleogenous leukemia, GISTs, myeloproliferative 
disorders (MPD) and sinonasal lymphomas.
[16] In vitro 
studies suggest activating muta tions in the kinase domain 
of c-Kit are resistant to inhibition by [CONTACT_86935]. Additionally, 
activating mutations in the kinase domain of PDGF-R α 
have been reported in GISTs.[17] We will correlate the 
presence or absence of c-Ki t and/or PDGF-R mutations 
with clinical response to imatinib. 
As the experience with imatinib therapy for CML 
increased, it became clear that some patients who initially 
responded later relapsed. Studies demonstrated multiple 
mechanisms of resistance including over-expression of BCR/ABL transcripts, acquisition of new chromosomal abnormalities and mutation of the kinase domain. In one study, mutations of the kinase domain appeared to be the mechanism of resistance in 23 of 43 cases. At the time of discontinuation, we will biops y a lesion that is clearly 
growing or has not responded and sequence PDGF-R and c-Kit.  
If any novel mutations are found in either of these cases, 
we will determine in vitro whether they are activating 
mutations and/or resistant to imatinib. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Mechanisms of Toxicity 
By [CONTACT_86936] 400 mg per day, the 
incidence of AEs should be de creased, but not eliminated. 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/2007 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07  14 We hypothesize three potential mechanisms for the 
increased toxicity of imatinib: 1) antiretrovirals inhibit the 
metabolism of imatinib resul ting in higher concentrations 
of imatinib compared to those seen in CML and GIST patients; 2) imatinib inhibits the metabolism of antiretrovirals resulting in higher concentrations of 
antiretrovirals; 3) the increase d incidence of diarrhea is 
related to response of o ccult GI KS lesions. Our 
investigations into the effect  of HAART on imatinib in the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_86865]. Because of the potential inhibition of imatinib by [CONTACT_86937], we will formally study the pharmacokinetics of im atinib and antiretrovirals 
during the first [ADDRESS_94707] of 
current trial since we woul d withhold therapy until the 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/2007 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07  15 diarrhea abated and then restart at a reduced dose. 
However, if the diarrhea is corr elated with regression of GI 
lesion, one could justify starting at the same dose level once the diarrhea had abated in future trials. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Transcription profile of KSHV. Changes in gene expression are a fundamental hallmark of cancer progression and invaluable tool of cancer stages. In the case of KS, 
KSHV/HHV-8 has been identified as the etiological agent and this assay is designed to identify KSHV genes that might change in response to therapy. We will use reverse-transcription (RT) coupled to amplification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to measure the mRNA levels of all KSHV/HHV-[ADDRESS_94708] thei r dose reduced (see Section 5.4-5.6).

5.3 Dosing
 
Patients will be instructed to take Gleevec 400 mg/day (a total of 4 tablets). Patients who have been on study for at least [ADDRESS_94728] their dose increased to 600 mg/day.

until the toxicity has resolved to ≤ Grade 1. Gleevec may then be 
resumed at the same daily dose. If the Grade [ADDRESS_94730] be withheld until the toxicity has resolved to ≤ Grade 1, and the 
daily dose must be reduced by 100 mg  if at 400 mg dose level, or by 
200 mg if at 600 mg dose level. If th e Grade 2 toxicity recurs, Gleevec 
treatment will be stopped. 
 For Grade 2 hypophosphatemia the patient should be started on Neutra-Phos 250 mg by [CONTACT_86942] a day.  Additionally, if a patient has a 25-hydroxy D that is > 30 ng/mL, no 
Vitamin D supplementation is needed. If less than 20 ng/mL, give Ergocalciferol D2: 50,000 IU weekly x 8 weeks and then maintain with daily OTC Vitamin D3 cholecalciferol 1,000 IU daily. If the level is between 20 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL, calculate the additional Vitamin D the patient will need to add to their current intake by [CONTACT_6388]:  30 - (current level) x 100 = # IUs of OTC cholecalciferol to boost up stores to optimum level of 30ng/mL  (to increase by 1 ng/mL add 100 
IU of Vitamin D3). For example if current level = 25 ng/mL, the 
patient will need to add 500 IU to their current intake. With

and the daily dose must be reduced by 100 mg if at 400 mg dose level, 
or by 200 mg if at 600 mg dose level. If the Grade 2 hypophosphatemia recurs after dose reduction, Gleevec treatment will be stopped. 
5.4.2 Grade 3/4 
If the patient experiences Grade 3/[ADDRESS_94732] be w ithheld until the toxicity has 
resolved to ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_94733] be reduced 
by 100 mg if at 400 mg dose level, or by 200 mg if at 600 mg dose level. If the Grade 3/4 toxicity recurs, Gleevec treatment will be stopped.  For Grade 3/4 hypophosphatemia the patient should be started on Neutra-Phos 250mg by [CONTACT_86943] a day and Gleevec should be 
held until resolved to Grade <
 1 and then restarted at previous dose. 
 Additionally, if a patient has a 25-hydroxy D that is > 30 ng/mL, no 
Vitamin D supplementation is needed. If less than 20 ng/mL, give Ergocalciferol D2: 50,000 IU weekly x 8 weeks and then maintain with daily OTC Vitamin D3 cholecalciferol 1,000 IU daily. If the level is between 20ng/mL and 30ng/mL, calculate the additional Vitamin D the patient will need to add to th eir current intake by [CONTACT_6388]: 
 30 - (current level) x 100 = # IUs of OTC cholecalciferol to boost up stores to optimum level of 30ng/mL  (to increase by 1 ng/mL, add 100 
IU of Vitamin D3). For exampl e if current level = 25ng/mL, the 
patient will need to add 500 IU to their current intake. With 
completely optimum Vitamin D levels, patients may be less susceptible to hypophosphatemia. 
 
If Grade 3/[ADDRESS_94734] be withheld until th e toxicity has resolved to ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_94735] be reduced by 100 mg if at 400 
mg dose level, or by 200 mg if at 600 mg dose level.  If the Grade 3/4

5.5 Dose Modifications For Hematological Toxicity  
5.5.1 Grade 1/2 
No dose interruptions or reductions will be performed for Grade 1/2 
hematological toxicity. 
5.5.2 Grade 3/4  
If the patient experiences a Grade 3/4 hematological toxicity, defined 
as an ANC < 1 x 109/L, or a platelet count < 50 x 109/L, Gleevec must 
be withheld until the toxi city has resolved to ≤ Grade 2. ANC will take 
precedence over a WBC count in determining the degree of 
neutropenia (e.g., doses should not be interrupted for a patient with a 
WBC < 2.0 x 109 /L, but would be for an ANC < 1 x 109/L). If the 
toxicity resolves to <  Grade 2 within 2 weeks, Gleevec treatment may 
be resumed at the same dose. If th e Grade 3/[ADDRESS_94738] be withheld. If the toxicity resolves to <  Grade 2 within 2 weeks, 
Gleevec may be recommenced with the daily dose reduced by 100 mg 
if at 400 mg dose level, or by 200 mg if at 600 mg dose level. If the 
Grade 3/4 toxicity persists for longer than 2 weeks, Gleevec will be stopped. If the Grade 3/4 toxicity recurs after a dose reduction to 300 mg/day, Gleevec treatment will be  stopped. Patients may receive G-
CSF while Gleevec is held as clinically indicated.  No dose reductions will be performed for Grade 1-4 anemia. If the patient develops anemia, he/she may be transfused or receive Erythopoietin at the discre tion of the Investigator.

5.6 Concomitant Therapy  
In general, concomitant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_86866], provided their use is 
documented in the patient records and on the appropriate CRF. The administration of any other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_86867], 
including chemotherapy and biologic agents, is NOT permitted. Similarly, the use of other concurrent inves tigational drugs is not allowed. 
Because of the inherent risk  of either reduced activity or enhanced toxicity of 
the concomitant medication and/or Gleev ec, drugs known to interact with the 
same CYP450 isoenzymes (2D6 and 3A4)  as Gleevec should be used with 
caution.  Patients using concomitant me dications known to be metabolized by 
[CONTACT_86944] p450 enzyme s will not be excluded from the study. However, 
the patients must be carefully monitored for potentiation of toxicity due to individual concomitant medication.  Special care has to be given to the 
concomitant use of acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol  or Percocet, paracetamol 
Panadol , etc.) with Gleevec. Any use of concomitant medication must be 
captured in the concomitant medicati on CRF. (See Appendix XV for complete 
list).

NCI Version Date 07/24/07  29 5.7 Permitted Medications  
5.7.1 Prophylactic use of loperamide (e.g., Imodium®, with suggested 
dosing as start: 4mg po x 1, then 2 mg po after each loose stool, max 
16 mg/day) is recommended for patients experiencing Grade 1 or 2 diarrhea, before dose interruption. 
5.7.2 Chemoprophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is highly 
recommended for all subjects with a CD4 count of <
 200.  
5.7.3 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_199]/or oral antifungal ag ents are permitted except oral 
itraconazole and ketoconazole. (Topi[INVESTIGATOR_86868]). 
5.7.4 Chemoprophylaxis for Mycobacterium avium  complex (MAC) is 
required for patients whose CD4 cell counts < 50 cells/mm3, 
preferably with azithromyci n 1.[ADDRESS_94740] with a detectable viral lo ad. Patient should be receiving an 
optimal and stable regimen of HAART for a minimum of 12 weeks prior to entry. 
5.7.8 Erythropoietin is permitted at the discretion of the Investigator. 
5.7.9 Granulocyte colony stimulating factors are permitted as outlined in Sections 3.2.12 and 5.6. 
5.7.10 Regularly prescribed medications su ch as antipyretics, analgesics, 
allergy medications, antidepress ants, sleep medications, oral 
contraceptives, megestrol acetate , testosterone or any other 
medications are permitted except for prohibited medications (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] – [IP_ADDRESS]).  
5.7.11 Prophylactic anti-emetics should be withheld until the patient has experienced Grade 1 nausea or vomiting.  
5.7.12 If patient has weight gain greater than 5 pounds above baseline that is 
felt to be due to fluid retention, pa tient may be started on diuretics at 
the Investigator’s discretion.

NCI Version Date 07/24/07  30 5.7.13 Alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_86869], acupuncture and visualization 
techniques will be permitted. Subjects should report the use of these 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_86870].  
5.8 Prohibited Medications  
5.8.1 Investigational drugs, w ith the exception of antiretroviral agents that 
are being obtained through an expanded access protocol. 
5.8.2 Systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy or  any other treatment specifically 
prescribed to treat KS (e.g., radiation, etc.). 
5.8.3 Since warfarin is metabolized  through the CYP450 system, no 
therapeutic anticoagulation with wa rfarin (e.g. Coumadin) will be 
permitted in patients participating in this study. As an alternative, therapeutic anticoagulation may be accomplished using low-molecular weight heparin (e.g., Lovenox
®) or heparin. A mini-dose coumadin 
derivative (equivalent to 1 mg QD Coumadin) is permitted for 
prophylaxis of central venous catheter  thrombosis, at the discretion of 
the treating physician. In general, th e use of Coumadin is discouraged 
on this protocol.

NCI Version Date 07/24/07  31 6.0 REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
This study will utilize the CTCAE version 3.0 for Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Event reporting. A c opy of the CTCAE version 3.0 can be downloaded from the 
CTEP home page (http://ctep.info.nih.gov). All appropriate treatment areas should have 
access to a copy of the CTCAE version 3.0. The documents “NCI Guidelines: Adverse 
Event Reporting Requirements for NCI Investiga tional Agents” (sections 2 and 3) clearly 
outline reporting criteria. 
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_60838] (CDUS). Cumulative 
CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to C TEP by [CONTACT_10075]. Reports are due 
January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31. 
6.1 Classification Of Adverse Events By  [CONTACT_86945] & Relationship To Study 
Drug Administration  
6.1.1 Adverse Event 
Any unfavorable and unintende d sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medical treatment or pro cedure regardless of whether it is 
considered related to the medical treatment or procedure (attribution of unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite). 
6.1.[ADDRESS_94742], in view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction. 
6.1.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Any adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27588], a persistent 
or significant disability/incapacity , or a congenital anomaly/birth 
defect.  Please note for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] – All hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (or prolongation 
of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28689]) for medical events equivalent to CTCAE 
Grade 3, 4, [ADDRESS_94743] be reported regardless of the requirements for Phase of study, expected or unexpected, an d attribution. For example, do not 
report an admission for pharmacokinetic sampling, but do report an admission for a myocardial infarction. 
6.1.4 Toxicity 
Toxicity is a term NOT clearly de fined by [CONTACT_86946].  
Toxicity has been described as an ad verse event that ha s an attribution 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/2007 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07  32 of possibly, probably or definitely re lated to investigational treatment. 
To minimize confusion the NCI would recommend that the term 
toxicity NOT be utilized for a dverse event reporting purposes. The 
CTCAE continues to use the term ‘toxicity’ because of familiarity. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_94744]  is updated electronically in real 
time. 
6.1.6 Adverse Event Expedited Reporting System (AdEERS)  (formerly 
known as Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting). 
An electronic system for expedited submission of adverse event 
reports. 
6.1.7 Attribution 
The determination of whether an adve rse event is related to a medical 
treatment or procedure. Attribution categories: 
Definite – The AE is clearly related to the investigational agent(s). 
Probable – The AE is likely related to the investigational agent(s). 
Possible – The AE may be related to the investigational agent(s). 
Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the investigational 
agent(s). 
Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the investigational 
agent(s). 
6.2 Adverse Event Reporting To [COMPANY_001]  
[COMPANY_001] will need to be notified with in 24 hours of any SAE regardless of the 
presumed relationship to Gleevec. 
Instructions for rapid notification of SAEs. 
6.2.1 Reporting Responsibility Each SAE (but not pregnancies) mu st be reported by [CONTACT_86947] [ADDRESS_94745] also be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of receiving it. If the SAE has not been previously documented (new occurrence) and it  is thought to be rela ted to study drug (or 
therapy), the Medical Safety Expe rt of the Clinical Safety &

NCI Version Date 07/24/07  37 9.0 EV ALUATION OF RESPONSE  
9.1 Definition of Response  
9.1.1 Complete response (CR) is defined as the absence of any detectable 
residual disease, including tumor-asso ciated edema, persisting for at 
least 4 weeks. In patients whose pi[INVESTIGATOR_49194] (brown or tan) macular 
skin lesions persist after appare nt CR, biopsy of at least one 
representative lesion is required in order to do cument the absence of 
malignant cells. In patients known to have had visceral disease, an assessment at restaging with appr opriate endoscopic or radiographic 
procedures should be made. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_94751] 4 weeks; AND  
 For patients with pi[INVESTIGATOR_49194] (brown or tan) macular skin lesions 
persisting after apparent CR, bi opsy of a representative lesion 
documenting the absence of KS  cells is not required; AND 
 For patients known to have had vis ceral disease, restaging with 
appropriate endoscopic or ra diographic procedures is 
contraindicated or ot herwise not performed. 
9.1.3 Partial Response (PR) is defined as no new lesions (skin or oral), or no 
new visceral sites of involvement (or the appearance or worsening of tumor-associated edema or effusions); AND 
 A 50% or greater decrease in the number of all previously existing 
lesions lasting for at  least 4 weeks; OR 
 Complete flattening of at least 50% of all previously raised lesions (i.e., 50% of all previously nodular or plaque-like lesion become macules); OR 
 A 50% decrease in the sum of the products of the largest perpendicular diameters of the marker lesions. 
NOTE – Patients with residual tumo r-associated edema or effusion 
who otherwise meet the criteria for CR will be classified as having a PR. 
9.1.4 Stable disease is defined as any response not meeting the criteria for CR, PR, or progressive disease. 
9.1.5 Progressive disease is defined as follows: 
 For patients with <50 cutaneous lesions ≥  25% increase in the sum 
of perpendicular diameters of the indicator lesions. 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/2007 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07  38  OR ≥ 25% increase in the total le sion count, or a minimum of 5 
new lesions, whichever is greater, 
 OR ≥ 25% increase in the number of raised lesions (minimum of 5 
new raised lesions if there are very few raised lesions, for example 
≤ 8), whichever is greater. 
Note: There are body sites where dis ease is particularly difficult to 
evaluate, and a few new lesions may be counted in spi[INVESTIGATOR_86872] 
a patient is not actually progressing. For example, lesions of the foot, 
particularly those which are flat, are difficult to evaluate because their 
intensity may be variable based on how much edema is present, how 
much the person walked the day before, how long their feet have been in a dependent position prior to the physical exam, etc. 
 
 For patients with >
50 cutaneous lesions: 
 ≥ 25% increase in the sum of the perpendicular diameters of the 
indicator lesions. 
 OR ≥ 25% increase in the total number of lesions in the 
prospectively defined anatomic sites containing representative 
numbers of lesions, 
 OR a total of 5 new lesions in anatomic sites which were previously documented as having no evidence of cutaneous disease 
on the whole body diagram, 
 OR (25% increase in the number of raised lesions. Photographic 
documentation of “gross” or signifi cant progression, particularly in 
areas that were not being followed, will be of particular value. 
 In order to classify a response as PR , the patient must have at least a 
PR in the cutaneous or noncutaneous  sites of disease, and no evidence 
of progression as defined in the abov e criteria. In order to classify a 
response as a CR, the patient must have a CR in both the cutaneous (if applicable) and noncutaneous (if applicable) sites of disease and no evidence of progression as defi ned by [CONTACT_86950]. 
Noncutaneous Progression 
Progressive disease includes new visceral sites of involvement or 
progression of visceral disease or the development of new or increasing tumor-associated edema or effusion lasting at least 1 week, 
which interferes with the patient’s normal activities. Progressive visceral disease, for measurable and evaluable disease, should be 
based on RECIST criteria.

NCI Version Date 07/24/07  42 12.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 Sample Size Estimation  
The response rate (CR + PR) to  imatinib in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_86873] 50% to date. It is 
well known that some patients have regr ession of their KS after beginning 
HAART therapy.[18] In order to minimize the effect of HAART being a potential 
confounding factor in response rates, r ecent studies have required patients on 
HAART to be on stable regimens for [ADDRESS_94754] as many 20% of 
responses in KS clinical trials may be delayed responses to HAART alone.[19, 
Walmsley, 1999 #136] Simon’s two-stage design will be used to test the null hypothesis 
that the response rate (CR + PR) if 20% ag ainst the alternative that it is 50% at 
the one-sided 0.[ADDRESS_94755] eigh t patients respond, the null hypothesis will 
be rejected in favor of the alterna tive hypothesis. The probability of early 
termination of the study is 0.68.  
In our original estimate, we assumed a drop out rate of 10-15% based on our 
experience in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_86874] a sample size of [ADDRESS_94756] had a higher drop out rate. Consequently, based on a drop 
out rate of 20-30%, we plan to roll a to tal of [ADDRESS_94757] 22 patients 
evaluable for response. In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we found that decreas ing the dose of imatinib by 33% (600 
mg/day to 400 mg/day) dramatically decr eased the incidence of AEs. This dose 
reduction should reduce the steady state concentration of imatinib and it’s 
metabolite by [ADDRESS_94758] deviation of  steady state plasma concentration, 
assuming constant clearance. This observ ation suggests a cha nge in the plasma 
concentration imatinib and/or its metabolite of [ADDRESS_94759] deviation would be 
significant in our patient population. Based on this assumption, a PK sampling of 12 patients will provide a power of 88% to detect a [ADDRESS_94760]. 
12.2 Statistical Analysis Plan
 
Summary statistics will be used to de scribe the study population (such as 
ranges, medians of age, gender, base line performance characteristics). The 
binomial and its exact 95% confidence interval will be used to estimate clinical response rate. A two-sided one-group chi-squa re test will be performed to detect 
a 50% response rate. Due to a small samp le size, exact logistic regression may 
be used to evaluate the effect of base line characteristics a nd other covariates 
with the clinical response. To evaluate  inhibition of PDGF receptor, we will 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/2007 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07  43 correlate the presence or absence of c-kit and or PDGF-R mutations with 
clinical response to imatinib by [CONTACT_86952]-square tests or Fisher’s exact 
tests. The cytokine/chemokine profile at  baseline, 1 week a nd 4 weeks after of 
imatinib therapy will be analyzed using the proteomics approach. The 
concentration of each cytokine from th e samples will be estimated. Friedman’s 
test will be used to evaluate cha nges between time points with respect to 
cytokine levels. If a significant diffe rence is detected, the Wilcoxon rank sum 
test will be used for pairwise compar isons. Exact logistic regression analysis 
will be used to detect any correlation between baseline concentrations and clinical responses. PK pa rameters including AUC, C
max and elimination half-life 
of imatinib will be estimated in the first [ADDRESS_94761] ed antiretrovirals may be estimated 
in selected patients. Summary statistics will be used to describe PK results. The incidence of specific AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_86953]. The binomial proportion and its 95% confidence interv al will be used to estimate the 
proportion of patients who experience an AE  of severity Grade 3 or higher. The 
proportions of primary and secondary re sistance to imatinib therapy will be 
estimated. Chi-square tests or Fisher’s exact tests will be used to evaluate associations between c-kit and PDGF-R mutations with resistance to imatinib 
therapy. 
Cluster analyses are planned for the real-time QPCR data. To evaluate the 
associations between single genes and response, categorical data analysis 
methods are proposed. If feasible, a multivar iate model relating gene expression 
to response will be performed. 
12.3 AMC Policy for Monitoring of Phase I and Phase II Trials
 
This protocol will follow the AMC’s policy for data monitoring (see Appendix 
XVI, Data Safety and Monitoring Plan). 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/2007 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07  44 13.0 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
(See Appendix IV, Informed Consent) 
13.1 Informed Consent  
The principles of informed consent de scribed in Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) regulations (21 CFR part 50) mu st be followed. IRB approval of the 
protocol and the informed consent form must be given in writing. 
The sponsor must receive a copy of the letter of approval from the IRB, which 
specifically approves the pr otocol and informed c onsent, before patient 
enrollment. The IRB must also approve a ny significant changes to the protocol 
and documentation of this approval must be sent to the sponsor. Records of all study review and approval documents must be kept on file by [CONTACT_86954]. AEs 
must be reported to the IRB. The IRB should receive notification of completion 
of the study and final report within  [ADDRESS_94762] be approved by [CONTACT_5343], CTEP and the Investigator before implementation. Amendments significantly a ffecting the safety of subjects, the 
scope of the investigation or the sc ientific quality of the study, require 
additional approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC/REB. A copy of the written approval of the 
IRB/IEC/REB must be sent to N ovartis. Amendments affecting only 
administrative aspects of the study do not require formal protocol amendments or IRB/IEC/REB approval but the IRB/ IEC/REB of each center must be kept 
informed of such ad ministrative changes. 
13.3 Women And Minorities
 
This is a study being conducted by [CONTACT_3433] e NCI-sponsored AIDS Malignancy 
Consortium (AMC). As part of their c ontractual obligations, each participating 
site within the AMC, and the AMC as a whole, is required to assure that the 
participation of women and minority subjects reflects the percentage 
representation of these populat ions in their geographic region and, for the AMC, 
the [LOCATION_002] as a whole. As such, it is expected that the representation of subjects on this trial will reflect the constitution of the respective populations.

NCI Version Date 07/24/07 52 APPENDIX VI:  MODEL INFORMED CONSENT  
 
Phase II Trial of Imatinib Mesylate (Gleevec ) in Patients with HIV-Related Kaposi’s 
Sarcoma 
 
This is a clinical trial (a type of research study). Clin ical trials include only patients who choose 
to take part. Please take your time to make y our decision. Discuss it with your friends and 
family. 
 You are being asked to take part in this study because you have Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), the most 
common cancer seen in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). 
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) Gleevec has on you and your 
Kaposi's sarcoma skin tumors. 
 This research is being done because treatments  for Kaposi's sarcoma do not cure the disease and 
better treatments are needed. Gleevec (also known as imatinib) has been approved by [CONTACT_86959] (FDA) for use in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia 
(cancer of the blood). Gleevec is e xperimental for the treatment of  KS, and its effectiveness in 
treating KS is unknown. In laboratory studies,  it has been found to stop tumor growth by 
[CONTACT_86960] r cancer to grow and spread. 
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?  
Approximately 30 patients will participate in this study at multiple medical centers. 
 
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY?  
If you agree to participat e and join in this study, the following will occur: 
 
1. Eligibility Phase  
You will need to have the following exams, te sts, or procedures done to find out if you are 
eligible and can par ticipate in the study. 
 You will have blood (a maximum of 5 tablespoons) drawn for laboratory testing. Some of this blood will be used to measur e antibodies to HIV infection. We will also 
check your stool for blood. 
 If you are a woman of childbe aring potential, a pregnancy test will also be done. 
 A medical history and a physi cal examination will be completed and will include a 
review of all medications that you are taki ng and an examination of your KS lesions. 
 You will have a chest x-ray and may be required to have a chest CT scan, which is a computerized series of X-rays. 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/07 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07 53 2. Treatment Phase 
 If you are a good candidate for treatment based upon these evaluations, you will 
begin treatment with Gleevec. Two biopsie s (removal of small tissue samples) of 
your KS lesions will be required before you begin treatment. The area of the skin 
where the sample will be removed will be numbed with a local anesthetic. Small 
tissue samples will then be rem oved by [CONTACT_86961]. 
 On the day you begin treatment, you will have a physical examination including measurement of your weight and vital signs  (temperature, pulse , respi[INVESTIGATOR_86878]). Blood (a maximum of 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for laboratory 
testing to monitor your kidney, liver, and bone marrow function. The study doctor 
will examine your KS lesions and may take up to [ADDRESS_94766] number will be used to identify 
the photo. 
 On the first and fifteenth day of your tr eatment you may have blood drawn to assess 
the level of Gleevec in your blood. On these days you will have additional blood drawn to determine if there is any inte raction between your HIV medications and 
Gleevec. A small tube or “IV” may be placed in a vein in your arm so that the blood can be drawn for testing wit hout additional “needlesticks”. We will also measure your 
HHV-[ADDRESS_94767] measures the amount of the HHV-8 virus, which is a 
virus associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma. This blood test will also be performed on the first and fifteenth day of your treatmen t, every [ADDRESS_94768]. 
 You will be given a bottle containing Gleevec tablets and instructed to take 4 tablets 
(a total of 400 mg) of Gleevec once a day by [CONTACT_1966]. To minimize throat irritation, 
you should take the tablets with food and a la rge glass of water (8  ounces) while in a 
sitting position. Drinking grapefruit juice dur ing treatment is discouraged because it 
may interfere with the e ffectiveness of Gleevec.  
 Your dose may be increased or decreased by [CONTACT_4904]. You will continue to 
receive the drug as long as you do not de velop unacceptable side effects, become 
pregnant, show significant wo rsening of your KS or require  systemic therapy for the 
treatment of a malignancy other than KS. 
 You will be instructed to bring all empt y and/or partially filled study medication 
bottles to each monthly visit.  
 You will need to return to the study center for a visit after 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month of treatment and then once a month for the next 5 to 12 months. At each study 
visit, you will be asked about signs and/or symptoms and about any other medications 
that you are taking. Taking certain medicati ons, including other experimental drugs, 
are not permitted while particip ating in this research study. 
 At your study visits, you will have a physic al examination including measurement of 
your vital signs and weight. Blood (a maximu m of 5 tablespoons) will also be drawn 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/07 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07 54 for laboratory tests including blood count s (which tell your doctor how well your 
bone marrow is functioning), chemistries (whi ch tell your doctor how well your liver 
and kidneys are functioning) and cytokine levels (which tell your doctor the how 
Gleevec is affecting your KS). After 1 week a biopsy of a KS lesion will be 
necessary. This will allow us to determine the effects of Gleevec on the various aspects of your tumor. 
 Evaluation of your disease will occur at your visit after months [ADDRESS_94769] your lesions for any change in the number of lesions present as well 
as any change in their appearance. Up to 12 photographs of your lesions will be taken to document their appearance. If one of your lesions disappears, your doctor may ask 
you for your permission to biopsy the area of skin where the lesion was previously 
located. 
 You will be asked to weigh yourself twice a week at home and report to the study 
doctor any rapid body weight increase of  more than [ADDRESS_94770] experienced and any other medications you are taking. A blood (a maximum of 5 tablespoons) sample will be draw n for laboratory testing. A biopsy of a KS 
lesion may be necessary at the time of discontinuation. 
 4. Early Withdrawal from the Study  
The Investigator may take you off the study if you are not tolerating the study medications 
or if you do not comply with the study guidelines. You may w ithdraw from the study at any 
time, and this will not affect any future care or treatment for your disease. Your treatment 
may be stopped by [CONTACT_86962], should the protocol be changed or closed, or if they believe that continuation in your case ma y not be beneficial. This may include 
discontinuing your participati on in this study without your consent. At the time of 
withdrawal, you will be asked to undergo the same evaluati ons you would have had during 
the discontinuation of treatment visit, as described above. 
 5. Standard procedures being done because you are in this study include: 
 A chest x-ray if you are a woman who could become pregnant, a pregnancy test will be 
done before treatment. 
6. Non standard procedures being done b ecause you are in this study include:  
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/07 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07 55  Punch biopsies of two KS lesions on your skin before you start treatment and after [ADDRESS_94771] on the 
cells in your Kaposi’s sarcoma. 
 A blood test to measure the level of Gleev ec in your blood. This blood test will be 
performed on the day you begin treatment, and after 2 weeks of treatment. 4-5 
teaspoons of blood will be needed for eight separate blood draws to measure Gleevec in 
your blood. This will be done on Day 1 and Day 15 (hour 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 24 hours).  
If one of your KS tumors goes away, your doctor may ask your permission to biopsy the area of 
skin where the lesion used to be. A pathologist will examine the biopsy to see if there are any tumor cells left.  You will be asked to donate tissues and fluids to the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR). If you agree, your permission will be ob tained in a separate consent form. If you don't 
agree, it will not prevent you fr om taking part in this study. 
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY? 
We think you will be in the study for up to 1 year. 
The researcher may decide to take you off this study if: 
 Your condition worsens or your doctor believ es that further treatment would be of no 
benefit to you or would be dangerous;  
 Your doctors see side effects they consider dangerous; 
 You are unable to consiste ntly take the study medica tion or frequently miss 
appointments or miss tests required to see if the treatment is safe and effective and to 
see how the treatment works; 
 You need treatment with other drugs that ar e not allowed in combination with Gleevec; 
 You become pregnant. 
You can stop participating at any time. However, if you decide to stop participating in the study, 
we encourage you to talk to the resear cher and your regular doctor first. 
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY? 
While on the study, you are at risk for these side  effects. You should discuss these with the 
researcher and/or your regular doctor. There also may be othe r side effects that we cannot 
predict. Other drugs will be given to make si de effects less serious and uncomfortable. Many 
side effects go away shortly af ter the drug is stopped, but in so me cases side effects can be 
serious or long-lasting or permanent. 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/07 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07 56 1. Risks and side effects related to the drug we are studying include:

AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/07 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07 57  Bone decay and low blood sugar that 
could lead to coma  Nose bleeds 
 Reduced vision  Constipation 
 Shock  Reddening of the skin 
 Mood swings  Shortness of breath 
 Increased muscle tension   Pneumonia 
 Increased weight  Decreased renal (kidney) phosphates 
and blood phosphate level 
 
2. Abnormal laboratory test values observed in some patients required te mporarily interrupting 
the study drug, or reducing the dose. The laborator y abnormalities included elevated liver or 
renal (kidney) function values, low platelet, white blood cell or red bl ood cell counts and 
disturbances in electrolyte (chemicals found in the blood, e.g. sodium, potassium, 
magnesium, calcium) balance. Lowering of your  white blood cell count could lead to an 
increased risk of infection and slower healing. Lowering of your platelet count could lead to 
an increased risk of bleeding. Lowering of your  red blood cells can lead to fatigue. If you 
should develop a fever when your white blood count  is low, you may need to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86880]. Transfusions  may be required to counteract the effects of low platelet or 
red blood cell counts. Elevated liver functio n values can indicate liver damage. Your 
laboratory values will be monitored closely, a nd the dose of your medication will be adjusted 
if your blood tests are abnormal.  Based upon experience from prev ious clinical trials, it is 
expected that these effects may be revers ed by [CONTACT_86963], or by 
[CONTACT_86964][INVESTIGATOR_35648]. 
 3. Gleevec is often associated with edema (fluid retention) and occasionally the fluid retention 
can be serious. Some patients have reported a rapid gain in body weight. Other patients have 
developed pleural effusions (fluid around lu ngs) and/or ascites (swollen abdomen), or 
pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), or perica rdial effusions (fluid in the sac that surrounds 
the heart), all of which occasionally may be serious. A minority have developed signs of 
congestive heart failure, a premature heartbeat, and a sac forming in the wall of the artery. 
Therefore, you are asked to closely monitor your body weight twice a week and report to your doctor any rapid increase gr eater than 5 pounds. If this happens, a check-up including 
physical examination, blood tests and X-rays will be performed as required by [CONTACT_86965]. One patient taking Gleevec who had no known history of liver problems has died 
due to liver failure while in a clinical study. The patient was also taking acetaminophen (Tylenol
®), also known as paracetamol in European countries. You should not take more than 
[ADDRESS_94772] been noted as 
well as the bursting of a patient’s spleen and pus found in the folds of the liver. 
 
Because some over the counter and prescription medications can reduce the effectiveness or 
enhance the side effects of Gleevec and/or Gleev ec can increase the side effects or lessen the 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/07 
NCI Version Date 07/24/[ADDRESS_94773] not drink grapefruit juice while taking 
Gleevec. 
 4. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding, brain hemorrhag es (bleeding in the brain), bleeding in the 
eye socket (anterior chamber hemorrhage) and inflammation of the capi[INVESTIGATOR_86881] a minority of patients. One patient with a history of heart problems experienced chest pain while taking the study drug. Some pati ents have experienced blood in their urine, 
which if severe caused death. Another pati ent experienced abnormal growth of nervous 
system cells (neuroendocrine tumor). It has been reported that one patient developed 
Parkinson’s disease, a slowly progressive disease of the ner vous system that causes your 
body to experience uncontrollable spasms. One patient, on anothe r study, developed a fistula 
(an abnormal pathway or channel) in his esophagus near a surgical site. 
 5. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is a rare, but serious adverse event that may develop while 
you are taking the study medicatio n, Gleevec. CHF is characterized by a decrease in left 
ventricular systolic function (thickening of the membranes in your heart so that it is unable to adequately pump blood throughout the body). Ten patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia developed severe CHF while being trea ted with Gleevec. Prior to taking Gleevec, 
all patients had normal left ve ntricular function (no CHF). Th ese effects on the heart have 
also been seen in mice treated with Gleevec. 
 
In NCI-sponsored clinical trials, other cardiac events have occurred that  are likely related to 
Gleevec. These include car diac ischemia/infarction, hypertension, and hypotension. 
 
Some of the symptoms listed a bove have led to death in a fe w patients. You will be closely 
monitored for any side effects and should repo rt any changes in th e way you feel to your 
doctor. You will be kept fully informed of any ev ents that occur during the course of the trial 
that might affect your safety. 
 
Study medication must be kept in a secure pla ce, out of the reach of children. Accidental 
ingestion of Gleevec may cause harmful eff ects, and the study doctor must be notified 
immediately if anyone other than  you takes Gleevec by [CONTACT_86966]. 
 
6. The risk of renal (kidney) phosphate lo ss and hypophosphatemia (decreased blood phosphate 
levels) and low levels of vitamin D have b een reported in patients taking Gleevec. These 
abnormalities were treated with V itamin D and phosphate supplements. 
 
7. Reproductive Risks  
Because Gleevec may affect an unborn baby, you s hould not become pregnant or father a 
baby [CONTACT_56035]. Women who are pregnant or nursing a child may NOT participate 
in this trial. Women who are either pregnant or  breast-feeding will not be allowed to start or 
continue in the study. An effective form of contraception should be used by [CONTACT_86967] a child as well as women who coul d become pregnant. A barrier method of 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/07 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07 59 contraception (a condom or diaphragm) should be used while taking this medication, and for 
[ADDRESS_94774] you r doctor immediately. 
 8. In non-human animal studies, imatinib has been found to cause cancer of the bladder, 
kidneys and ureters. At this time, it is uncer tain whether imatinib can cause cancer in 
humans. 
 For more information about risks and side effects, ask the researcher. 
 
 ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?  
If you agree to take part in th is study, there may or may not be direct medical benefit to you. A 
possible benefit of treatment w ith Gleevec is that your KS will get smaller or go away. We hope 
what is learned from this study will help other patients with KS in the future.

INFORMED CONSENT FORM 
RESEARCH STUDY 
AIDS AND CANCER SPECIM EN RESOURCE (ACSR) 
 
 
A. INTRODUCTION 
 
You are being asked to donate tissue for research.  Before you decide to be a part of this 
research study, you need to und erstand the risks and benefits so that you can make an 
informed decision.  This is known as informed consent. 
 This consent form provides information a bout the research study, which has been 
explained to you.  Once you understand the study and the tests it requ ires, you will be 
asked to sign this form if you want to take part in the study.  Your de cision to take part in 
the study is voluntary.  This mean s that you are free to choose if  you will take part in the 
study. 
 
B. PURPOSE 
 
The National Cancer Institute has set up a Bank for tissues and biological fluids from HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals in order to have specimens available for scientists studying malignancies associated with  HIV disease.  Individuals who have had 
biopsies to determine a malignancy are being asked for permission to take some of the 
tissue for the Bank.  Only tissue in excess of  that required for decision making will be 
given to the Bank.  If it turns out that your physician needs more of your tissue for 
additional studies, the Bank will release all of  your tissue back to your doctor.  No 
additional tissues will be ta ken from your body for the Bank. 
 In addition, you are requested to donate some of your blood to the Bank so that scientists will also be able to look for any deviation in these body fluids that may explain the 
malignancy. 
 
C. PROCEDURES 
 
You are being asked for consent to place some of the biopsy material in the ACSR.  If 
you agree to allow the ACSR to have some of your tissue, we would also like to: 
 
1. Confidentially obtain some clinical inform ation from your medical records that could 
be useful to research investigators.  The report of the information retrieved from your 
medical record that is given to research investigators wi ll not have your name, or 
include any information, which could personally identify you. 
 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/07 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07 63 2. Obtain some blood for the Bank.  Up to twenty (20) millilite rs of blood will be 
obtained at your next vi sit to your physician. 
If during the course of treatme nt by [CONTACT_29591], it is nece ssary to perform any of the 
following procedures for diagnostic reasons, you will be asked, at that time, to consent to 
having a portion of that specimen sent to the Bank.  These requests will not require you to make any additional visits to your doctor or have any additional specimens taken just for the Bank.  The Bank will only rece ive part of your specimen, a nd only what is in excess.  
No additional materials will be removed for the purposes of the Bank alone.  Samples of interest would include, (but are not limited to): 
 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_872]. 
 Airway washes. 
 Fluid around lungs and intestines. 
 Additional biopsy material. 
 
You will not be asked to fill out any forms for any of these specimens. 
 
D. POSSIBLE RISKS 
 
There is a possibility of a bruise and slight pain at the time the blood samples are taken.  
There is also the possibility of fainting and in fection at the site of  the blood draw.   
 
E. POSSIBLE BENEFITS 
 
It may be that there will be no direct bene fit to you by [CONTACT_86968].  Howe ver, there may be possible 
benefits to medical knowledge and HIV- infected individuals in the future. 
 
F. COSTS 
 
There will not be any additional costs to you for consenting to participate in the AIDS 
and Cancer Specimen Bank. 
 
G. PAYMENT FOR INJURY OR HARM 
 
As the lists of risks shows, taking part in this  research study may result in injury or harm 
to you.  If you require immediate medical car e, you should go to an emergency room.

B.2  Instructions for Specimens Collected on Friday 
 
PREPARATION OF PLASMA AND MONONUCLEAR CELLS 
 
It is preferable that separation occurs 
as soon as possible. If necessary, whole 
blood in acid citrate dextrose (yellow top 
tube) can be held at
 room temperature 
for no more than 24 hours. 
 
Materials:
  
Lymphocyte Separation Medium (LSM So
lution, Ficoll-Hypaque - sterile) 
15 ml conical centrif
uge tubes (sterile) 
PBS (sterile)

1. Preparation of Plasma Samples  
a. The 7 ml tube of whole blood in acid
 citrate dextrose should be rotated 
gently 2 or 3 times before being 
centrifuged. Do not transfer before 
centrifugation.  
b. The cells are separated by [CONTACT_86975] 500 g for 10 minutes.  
c. 0.5ml aliquots of plasma are re
moved and put into 1.5 ml screw top 
tubes and transferred to 
liquid nitrogen storage. 
 
2. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear 
Cell Separation and Freezing  
a. The cells and plasma remaining from the previous step are transferred 
into a 15 ml conical tube, capped and re-suspended by [CONTACT_15478][INVESTIGATOR_86884].  
b. Sterile PBS should be added to th
e suspended cells until the final 
volume is 8 ml; invert to mix.

whole blood mixture. (If the layer of LSM gets mixed with the blood-
PBS, the tube should be gently rota ted to mix the blood, PBS, and LSM, 
and transfer to a 50 ml sterile coni cal tube. An equal volume of PBS is 
added, and the cells are separated at  600 g for 15 minutes. After removal 
of LSM-PBS supernatant, return to Step b).  
d. The 15 ml conical tube for 30 minutes  at 900 g at room temperature. The 
mononuclear leukocytes (principally lymphocytes and monocytes) will 
band at plasma/LSM interface.  
e. The fluffy white layer just below the plasma layer should be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_86885], along with approximately half  of the LSM layer under it, and 
transferred to an appropriately labe led 15 ml sterile conical centrifuge 
tube. Mix by [CONTACT_86976].  
f. Washed twice in sterile PBS - centrifuge at 500 g for 10 minutes.  
g. Cell pellet should be mixed well wi th a gentle finger-tappi[INVESTIGATOR_79730].  
h. Using a 1 ml pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462], the *DMSO fr eezing mixture should be added drop 
wise to the cell pellet suspension. Gen tly finger-tap between drops. If the 
cell pellet is small, only 1 ml of freezing media is added (and only one 
aliquot of cells is frozen). If the cell pellet is large, up to 4 ml of freezing 
media can be added in a drop wise fashion. (Cell densities of 1 - 10 million PBMC/ml are best for cryopreservation. If a hemocytometer is available, the optimal concentration is 5 million PBMC/ml).  
 
*Important-Do not put the DMSO containing media on the cell 
button all at once.   
 
3. Freeze the cell suspension in 0.5 ml aliquots in sterile NUNC vials by 
[CONTACT_86977] a room temp erature, alcohol saturated, control

A. METHODOLOGY  
 
A.[ADDRESS_94782] sections are stained at the sa me time to control for variability.  Two 
ribbons of four to five tissue sections 5 um thick will be placed one below the 
other on ProbeOn Plus slides (Fischer). Th e two ribbons will be treated identically 
except the top ribbon will receive th e primary antibody and the bottom ribbon, 
which is serving as a negative control, will  not.   Slides will be stained using the 
following antibodies: LANA, anti-PDGF-R and anti-phospho-PDGF-R (Tyrosine 
783) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA).  H&E st ains will also be performed on all pre 
and post specimens. 
 
A.2 Within 48 hours of sectioning, slides will de-paraffinized in xylene and ethanol.  Antigen retrieval will be pe rformed by [CONTACT_86978] 10 minutes in pH 6 
citrate buffer followed by 10 minutes in 3% H
2O2. The slides for phospho–PDGF-
R require 15 minutes in 1mM EDTA, pH 8.0 prior to H 2O2. The slides are then 
incubated overnight with the primary an tibody at a 1/100 dilution for anti-PDGF-
R, a 1/100 dilution for anti-LANA, and a 1/50 dilution anti-phospho-PDGFR at 
40C. The slides are then inc ubated for 30 minutes with 100 µL of biotinylated 
anti-rabbit secondary anti body, then for 30 minutes with ABC avidin/biotin 
(Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) with washes in after each incubation.  Slides were 
incubated in ethanol and xylene prior to mounting coverslips. 
 
A.3 All slides will be assigned a random nume rical identifier and w ill be presented in 
a blinded fashion to two pathology reviewers (Drs. Tahan and Dahiya).  Based on 
review of the slides from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], it was determin ed nearly all of the KS 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_86887], and after 
treatment their immunoreactiv ity decreased uniformly. Staining intensity of basal 
keratinocytes is reduced after treatment with imatinib, precluding using them as 
an internal standard for assessment of lesional cell staining intensity in post-treatment samples.  Immunor eactivity of lesional KS cells will thus be scored on a 
scale of 0 to 5+ by [CONTACT_86979], with  0 being the negative control staining of 
basal keratinocytes and 5+ being equal to the staining intensity of basal 
keratinocytes in pretreatment samples, and a final score for each sample based on 
the average of 4 sections.

For instance, even using an activation specific anti body, Weber and his colleagues 
have been able to statistically correlate  erk1/erk2 activation with tumor grade and 
stage of prostate cancer [52]. In this study we will classify the activation of 
PDGF-R as low (score of 0, 1+ or 2+) or high (score of 3+, 4+ or 5+).  The 
breakpoint for this groupi[INVESTIGATOR_86888]. Biopsy pairs that score as high at baseline a nd low at seven days 
will be considered PDGF-R inhibited, and those that score as high at baseline and high at seven days will be considered P DGF-R not inhibited. Pairs that score low 
at baseline will be omitted from the analysis. For the purposes of Aims [ADDRESS_94783] whether phosphorylati on of PDGF-R (low or high) at [ADDRESS_94784]  punch technique, us ing a 4 mm punch. The

RECEPTOR MUTATION ANALYSIS 
  
A. METHODOLOGY 
 
Each patient will have a [ADDRESS_94787] be 
taken into account before we can declare a ne gative result. Based on our previous studies 
we estimate that approximately 50% of a [ADDRESS_94788] decided level of 95% confidence level was 
acceptable. The number of assays required is the number of times the negative result 
(normal sequence) must happen to be less  that or equal to 5% (100% -95%).  
Mathematically this can solved as a probability problem. 
 
(p {normal sequence})n   <  0.05  where n is number of assays and p(normal sequence) = 
0.75 
 This transforms to (0.75)n   <  0.05 Æ   n log(0.75) < log (0.05) Æ  n (-0.125) = - 1.301)      
n= 10.41Æ  11 
 
Thus to achieve a 95% confid ence of not missing a mutation each exon will be sequenced

biopsy should be, if possible, completely within  the margins of the lesions. Selection of

 A. METHODOLOGY 
 
In this study we will examine the patient cyt okine profiles at baseline, Day [ADDRESS_94794] four-point curves. Thus the ch ip should be considered a semi-quantitative 
assay and all cytokines/chemokines that appe ar to be potential predictors will be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_6428]. 
 
The concentrations of cytokines that are found to be potential predic tors by [CONTACT_86980]. R&D Systems 
(Minneapolis, MN) produces colorimetric  sandwich ELISAs that correspond to the 
cytokines and chemokines on th e cytokine chip. Depending on the ELISA, the intra-assay 
precision has a CV of 3 to 14 percent and th e inter-assay precision has a CV of 7 to 14 
percent. The concentrations determined by [CONTACT_86981] e is any correlation between concentration at 
baseline or changes in concentrations after treatment and clinical response.  
 
B. SPECIMEN COLLECTION  
 
Serum (red top) and plasma (green top) specim ens should be collected at baseline, 8 days 
and 29 days (approximately 5ml). Centrifuged at 2,400 xg for 15 minutes. Plasma and 
serum should be aliquoted into 2 nunc tubes which will be provided with labels by [CONTACT_86982]. Ship one tube of each to the Koon lab and

APPENDIX XIII: HHV-8 VIRA L LOAD AND GENE EXPRESSION  
 A. DESCRIPTION OF ASSAY 
 
This assay is used to quantify the burde n of HHV-8 (Human Herpesvirus Type 8, or 
Kaposi's sarcoma associated virus, KSHV) present in circulating peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC). Cells are se parated from whole blood by [CONTACT_86984], DNA extracted from purified PBMC by [CONTACT_86985], and the 
number of HHV-8 copi[INVESTIGATOR_86896] a quantitative compe titive DNA PCR assay. 
Results are expressed in numbers of copi[INVESTIGATOR_86897]. The limit of detection for 
this assay depends upon the amount of DNA available, but is generally <
50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/106 
PBMC.  Changes >  1.7-fold are unlikely to be due to assay variation, but HHV-8 burden 
does not appear to be as c onstant as HIV viral load. While some preliminary data 
indicates that untreated  individuals with an average HHV-8 burden of > 100 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/[ADDRESS_94802] only, and should 
not be used to make clinical decisions. The purpose of including this as say as part of this 
trial is to determine its us efulness as a prognostic marker. 
 
A.1 Changes in gene expression are a funda mental hallmark of cancer progression and 
invaluable tool of cancer stages. In  the case of KS, KSHV/HHV-8 has been 
identified as the etiological agent and th is assay is designed to identify KSHV 
genes that might change in response to therapy. We will use reverse-transcription 
(RT) coupled to amplification using pol ymerase chain reaction (PCR) to measure 
the mRNA levels of all KSHV/HHV-[ADDRESS_94803] only and should not be used to make clinical decisions. The purpose of including this assay as part of this trial is to determine its usefulness as a prognostic marker.  
 
A.2 Reverse-transcription (R T) coupled to amplification using polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) is widely recognized as the most sensitive method to detect the presence of specific RNAs. We will us e real-time quantitative RT-PCR. This 
assay measures the amount of PCR produc t based on intercala tion of a fluorescent 
dye. Fluorescence is recorded at each cycle.  So-called Ct-values indicate the cycle 
at which the fluorescence crosses a part icular threshold ([ADDRESS_94804] 
deviation (SD) of the non-template contro l (NTC)). Hence, Ct-values indicate the 
abundance of a given mRNA on a log scale.  A low Ct value represents a highly 
abundant target mRNA (Heid, Genome Res. 6:968-94 (1996). We have experience doing these assays at the Univ ersity of North Carolina Lineberger 
Cancer Center. 
 
A.3 Cells are separated from whole blood by [CONTACT_86986]. Total RNA will be 
isolated using RNAzol (Tel-Test, Inc ., Friendswood, [LOCATION_007]) according to the 
supplier's protocol and reverse-transcri bed using Mo-MuLV reverse transcriptase 
and 120 pmol random hexanucleotide primers (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster 
AMC # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/07 
NCI Version Date 07/24/07 83 City, CA). After incubation at 42°C for 35 min, the reaction was stopped by 
[CONTACT_86987] 95°C for 5 min, the cDNA pool was diluted, and the resulting sample analyzed by [CONTACT_5203]-time quantitative PCR using a dedicated MJR Opticon2 machine 
and universal cycle conditions. We will use  commercial SYBRgreen-based PCR 
(SYBR® Green, Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) as a uniform detection method.

NCI Version Date 07/24/07 91 APPENDIX XVI: DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING PLAN  
 Monitoring The Progress Of Trials And The Safety Of Participants 
 
All AMC protocols follow the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) guidelines for reporting of adverse events. All ad verse events that meet the expe dited reporting requirements of 
the National Cancer Institute (NCI ) are reported to the Investigat ional Drug Branch (IDB) of the 
NCI via the Adverse Event Expe dited Reporting System (AdEERS) web application. All 
expedited adverse event reports are also required to be submitted to the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the repor ting institution. If NCI holds th e IND or no IND is required for 
a study, the AMC sites report serious adverse events  directly to the AMC Operations and Data 
Management Center via AdEERS. In some inst ances, the AMC sites may report serious adverse 
events directly to the commercial sponsor holdi ng the IND who will then in turn report to the 
AMC Operations and Data Manage ment Center. However, it is pr eferred that sites report all 
serious adverse events via AdEERS with th e Operations and Data Management Center 
forwarding a copy of the report to the sponsor.  The AMC Operations and Data Management Center provides a list ing of serious adverse events 
to the Protocol Chair and Co-chair(s) for revi ew on a regular basis. The AMC Operations and 
Data Management Center compi[INVESTIGATOR_86916] a tabular format and posts them on the password-protected section of the AMC Web site . The AMC Web site is accessible to all AMC 
investigators, co-investigators, a nd their staff. Email notification th at this information is available 
on the web site will be sent to all site PIs. It is the responsibility of each  site to provide this 
information to their respective IRBs, if required by [CONTACT_11577]. For blinded studies, the serious adverse events are reviewed and tabu lated without treatment assignment.  
 Accrual summaries for each AMC trial are updated nightly on the password-protected section of 
the AMC Web page. The progress of each AMC trial is reviewed regularly by [CONTACT_86988]-oriented Working Group during scheduled conference calls. 
For phase I dose escalation trials, dose escalation (or dose de-escalation) is based on the rules in the protocol and the Protocol Chair and Group Statistician determ ine whether these criteria have 
been met.  For phase II trials, st oppi[INVESTIGATOR_86917] e fficacy, or suspending enrollment 
pending observation of responses in a multi-stage phase II trial, is ba sed on meeting criteria 
stated in the protocol, and the Protocol Chai r and Group Statistician determine whether these 
criteria have been met.  For phase III trials, the AMC has formed an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC). Voting members of the DSMC are physicia ns, statisticians, and a patient advocate. All 
voting members are from outside the AMC. Non- voting members are the NCI scientific project 
officers and an NCI statistician. The AMC Da ta Safety and Monitoring Committee reviews 
AMC phase III studies in accordance with the National Cancer Institute’s Policy for Data Safety and Monitoring. Confidential repo rts of all phase II I trials are prepared by [CONTACT_86989]. A written 
report containing the current status of each tria l monitored, and when appropriate, any toxicity 
and outcome data, are sent to DSMC members by [CONTACT_86990] # 042 (Version 7.0) 07/24/07 
NCI Version Date 07/24/[ADDRESS_94809] of the trial. 
The report may contain recommendations for cons ideration by [CONTACT_6802] c oncerning whether to 
close the trial, report the results, or conti nue accrual or follow-up. 
 
The results of each DSMC meeting are summarized  in a formal report sent by [CONTACT_86991] 1 week of the meeting. 
The DSMC report contains recomm endations on whether to clos e each study reviewed, whether 
to report the results, and whether to conti nue accrual or follow-up. A primary recommendation 
(e.g., continue with no change; r ecommended or required modification;  stop) must be included in 
the document. The Group Chair is then responsible  for notifying the Protocol Chair and relevant 
Disease-oriented Working Group Chair before th e recommendations of the DSMC are carried 
out. In the unlikely event that th e Protocol Chair does not concur  with the DSMC, then the NCI 
Division Director or designee must be informed  of the reason for the disagreement. The Study 
Chair, relevant Disease-orie nted Working Group Chair, Gr oup Chair, DSMC Chair and NCI 
Division Director or designee wi ll be responsible for reaching a mutually acceptable decision 
about the study. CTEP approval of a formal amendment will be required prior to any 
implementation of a change to the study.    Following a DSMC meeting, a summary of the seri ous adverse events repor ted to the DSMC is 
posted to the AMC Web page. It is  each site’s responsibility for conveying this information to its 
IRB.  
Plans for Assuring Compliance with Requirements Regarding the Reporting of Adverse 
Events (AE). 
 
For trials monitored by [CONTACT_6812]’s Clinical Data Update System (CDUS), adverse event 
information is transmitted electronically to NCI on a quarterly basis. For trials monitored by 
[CONTACT_12134]’s Clinical Trials Monitoring Service (CTM S), adverse event information is transmitted 
electronically to NCI every two weeks. 
 
Plans For Assuring That Any Action Resultin g In A Temporary Or Permanent Suspension 
Of An NCI-Funded Clinical Trial Is Report ed To The NCI Grant Program Director 
Responsible For The Grant 
 
In the event that termination of the trial or major modifica tion to the protocol is under 
consideration, the Protocol Chair will convene th e AMC Data Coordinator and Disease-oriented 
Working Group Chair by [CONTACT_86992]. For phase I and II trials, the 
Protocol Chair also has the option of asking the AMC DSMC to review the study. The AMC 
Operations and Data Management  Center will inform the CTEP  Protocol Information Office 
(PIO) when studies are temporarily or permanently closed. The Cancer Treatment and 
Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer  Institute (NCI) must approve all protocol 
amendments prior to distri buting to the AMC sites.

NCI Version Date 07/24/07 93 Plans for Assuring Data Accuracy and Protocol Compliance 
 
All study data for AMC clinical trials are entered directly by [CONTACT_86993] (a web-based data entry and enrollment sy stem). During data entry, the system 
performs validation checks on many fields an d performs consistency checks between select 
fields. Range checks are placed on each field to eliminate entry of out-of-range values. Edit check programs are run on the database on a set sc hedule to identify and resolve inconsistencies 
between forms or data collected at different points in time. AMC Operations and Data Management Center staff routin ely interacts with site staff to resolve any data problems. 
 In accordance with NCI guidelines, the AMC Operations and Data Management Center conducts 
monitoring visits at the AMC sites to evaluate co mpliance with regulatory issues, and to review 
data for specific cases by [CONTACT_86994]. These reports are sent to the site Principle Investigator and to the NCI. In the event that major violations are identified, sites are asked to 
provide a plan to correct deficiencies within [ADDRESS_94810] the site. Possible actions include, 
but are not limited to, suspending enrollment of ne w patients to AMC trials until deficiencies are 
corrected; recommending a decr ease in funding to the site; and re quiring specific training for site 
investigators or staff members.

Name [CONTACT_73988]:  
CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 Drug Under Study: Lasmiditan  (COL-144)  
Title of Protocol : A Study of Three Doses of Lasmiditan (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) Compared to 
Placebo in the Acute T ReaTment of Migr AiNe: A randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled 
parallel group study ( SPARTAN ) 
Protocol Number:  
COL MIG -302 
 Phase: 3 
 Indication: Migraine - Acute Treatment   
 
Primary Objective:  To evaluate the efficacy at [ADDRESS_705635] Bothersome Symptom (MBS ), 
as identified by [CONTACT_541231], phonophobia and photophobia. 
 
Secondary Objectives:  To explore the time course and effect of lasmiditan 50 mg, of lasmiditan 100 mg and of 
lasmiditan 200 mg on relief of pain and on the MBS . 
 
Additional  Objectives:  To explore the effect and time course of a second dose of lasmiditan 50 mg, of 
lasmiditan 100 mg and of lasmiditan 200 mg compared to placebo on relief of pain and MBS wh en used for 
rescue and for recurrence of migraine.  To explore resource utilization during the study compared to pre- study in 
terms of cardiovascular events  and in terms of  migraine epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
 
Safety Objective:  To explore the safety and tolerability  of lasmiditan [ADDRESS_705636] dose and as a second dose,  in terms of adverse events  (AEs) , physical 
examinations , vital signs,  clinical laboratory evaluations, and 12-lead electrocardiograms ( ECGs ).  
 
Study Endpoints  
 
Primary Endpoint: The proportion of subjects headache pain free at [ADDRESS_705637] dose ( defined as moderate or 
severe headache pain becoming non e)  
 
Key Secondary Endpoint: The proportion of subjects who are MBS free at [ADDRESS_705638] dose (defined as the 
associated symptom present and identified as MBS  prior to dosing  being absent  at 2 hours ).  
 
Study Design:  
This is a prospective randomized, double- blind,  placebo -controlled study in subjects with disabling migraine 
(Migraine Disability Assessment ( MIDAS) score  ≥ 11). Subject s will be stratified (yes or no) for use of 
concomitant medications that reduce the frequency of migraine epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
 
Subjec ts will be asked to treat a migraine attack with study drug on an outpatient basis.  Subjects will be provided 
with a dosing card containing a dose for initial treatment and a second dose to be used for rescue or recurrence 
of migraine.   Each subject’s study participation will consist of a screening visit  (Visit 1) with a telephone contac t 
within 7 days to confirm eligibility , a Treatment Period of up to 8 weeks , and an End- of-Study ( EoS) visit (Visit 
2) within  one week ( 7 days ) of treating a single migraine attack.   The total time on study is approximately 11 
weeks.  
 
At the Screening visit (Visit 1)  subjects will provide written informed consent and authorize Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA) . Study eligibility will be assessed on the basis of medical history 
including migraine history , baseline physical examination (including height and weight) , vital signs, clinical 
laboratory tests , 12-lead ECG and responses to the MIDAS questionnaire. Subjects will be asked about any 
concomitant medication use as well as any cardiovascular (CV) events in the last 6 months and/or related 
resource utilization such as visits to cardiologists, procedures, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], new treatments or treatment

 adjustments for CV disease.  A Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)  will be completed. Subjects  
will be given an electronic diary and be trained on its use to record information about their migraine, dosing their 
migraine and post -dose assessments.  Subjects will be randomized, dispensed study drug and instructed not to 
treat an attack until their e ligibility has b een confirmed by [CONTACT_541232].  
Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of 7 treatment sequences to receive  lasmiditan 50 mg (L50 mg),  
lasmiditan 100 mg (L100 mg) or lasmiditan 200 mg (L2 00 mg) or placebo (P) for  the first dose (in a 1:1:1:1 ratio  
) and the second dose, if needed for rescue or recurrence of migraine a s follows:  
  
First  dose for treatment 
of migraine   Second dose for rescue or 
recurrence  of migraine  (if needed)  
L50 mg L [ADDRESS_705639]:  Within [ADDRESS_705640] will be reminded on the use of the diary and on dosing a migraine 
with study drug.   Once eligibility is confirmed, subjects will begin the Treatment Period.  Subjects considered not 
eligible will be advised not to take the study drug and an appointment for an EoS/Visit 2  and the collection of 
study drug and the diary will be scheduled  within one week (7 days ) of the confirmation of eligibility phone call.  
• Treatment Period: Subjects will be asked to treat their next migraine attack within [ADDRESS_705641] dose as long as no other rescue medication has been used. If the migraine does respond within 2 hours (headache becomes pain free) but then recurs after [ADDRESS_705642] the clinic to 
schedule EoS/Visit 2 within one week ( 7 days ) after [ADDRESS_705643] Population: Adult  patients with a history of migraine with or without aura .

 Statistical Analysis:  
Efficacy:  
This multi- center, randomized, double- blind, parallel -group, placebo- controlled clinical study is designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of lasmiditan [ADDRESS_705652] dose.  Subjects will be stratified (yes or no) for use of 
concomitant medications that reduce the frequency of migraine epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
 
Efficacy will be assessed using the primary endpoint of the proportion of subjects headache pain free at 2 hours , 
defined as moderate or severe headache pain becoming none and the key secondary endpoint of the proportion 
of subjects MBS free at 2 hours  defined as the associated symptom s (nausea, phonophobia or photophobia) 
present prior to dosing and identifie d by [CONTACT_541234].  
 
The primary analys es will compare the proportion of subjects who are headache pain free and the proportion of 
subjects who are MBS free  at 2 hour s in the lasmiditan 200 mg and placebo groups in the modified 
Intent -to-Treat (mITT) population.  Each of these two analyses  will be carried out using logistic regression Wald 
Chi-square test with region included in the model and will be conducted using a one-sided test at the 
alpha=0.025 level of significance . 
 
If both primary analys es are statistically significant ( one-sided, p<0.0 25), additional confirmatory hypotheses will

 be tested in the mITT  population in the following sequential order:  
 
• Proportion of subjects who are headache pain free at 2 hours in the lasmiditan 100 mg and placebo group.  
• Proportion of subjects who are MBS free at 2 hours in the lasmiditan 100 mg and placebo group.  
• Proportion of subjects who are headache pain free at 2 hours in the lasmiditan 50 mg and placebo group.  
• Proportion of subjects who are MBS free at 2 hours in the lasmiditan 50 mg and placebo group.  
 
All of the above analyses will be completed using one-sided tests at the alpha=0.[ADDRESS_705653] dose of lasmiditan 200 mg and of 
lasmiditan 100 mg and of lasmiditan 50 mg on features of migraine including: headache response (a reduction in 
headache pain from moderate or severe to mild or none) , vomiting, disability,  headache recurrence  and the use 
of recurrence medication, the use of rescue medication, patient global impression of change, time to headache 
relief, and time to headache pain free. Descriptive analys es will be performed on the proportion of subjects who 
are nausea free at 2 hours, the proportion who are phonophobia free 2 hours and the proportion who are photophobia free at 2 hours.  Exploratory second dose (for rescue or recurrence of migraine) comparisons 
between treatment groups will be performed. 
   
Sample Size Rationale   
This Phase 3 study is designed to demonstrate that lasmiditan is effective in the treatment of acute migraine in 
adult patients  with and without aura.  The sample size was estimated based on the 2 hour headache pain free 
and associated symptoms (nausea, phonophobia, or photophobia) free res ponse rates observed in the Phase 2 
study COL MIG -202. 
 
Dose Pain free  Nausea free  Phonophobia free  Photophobia free  
Placebo  7.4%  59.3%  51.9%  34.6% 
50 mg  13.9%  68.4% 58.2% 53.2%  
100 mg  13.6%  74.1%  75.3%  67.9%  
200 mg  18.8%  63.8%  59.4%  58.0%  
 For the primary endpoint of the proportion of patient s pain free at 2 hours a sample size of 570 evaluable 
subjects per arm provides power of >90% for the [ADDRESS_705654] conservative scenario (scenario 1) it was assumed that nausea would always be declared the MBS if it was present, regardless of the presence of other symptoms (phonophobia or photophobia).  The other 3 scenarios assumed lower likelihoods  of nausea to be considered 
the MBS and allowed for the other symptoms (either phonophobia or photophobia) to be considered the MBS at 
a higher rate.   This resulted in power estimates of > 95% f or MBS at a sample size of 570 for the lasmiditan 50 
mg  dose and >99% for MBS  at  sample sizes of 450 to 570 per arm for the 100 mg dose across all 4 scenarios . 
For the 200 mg dose, an average power of 71% was estimated across five seeds under the most conservative 
scenario 1. In contrast, the 3 scenarios that did  not declare nausea to be the default MBS if it was present  
estimated a greater average power of 82.6% to 91% .

 It is expected for a one-sided, two- sample comparison of proportions at the  2.5% level of significance, a sample 
size of 570 subjects per treatment arm (as defined by  [CONTACT_541235])  provides >90% power to detect a difference 
in headache pain free response rates  for assumed true rates of 7.4% and 18.8% (placebo and 200 mg) , 7.4% 
and 13.6%  (placebo and 100 mg)  and 7.4% and 13.9% (placebo and 50 mg)  >90 % power for MBS for both the

  Proprietary and Confidential  4. INTRODUCTION 
Migraine is a common neurological disorder and was ranked by [CONTACT_38375] 
(WHO) in their [ADDRESS_705663] common disease in the world among both males  and females.[1]  
Although the introduction of triptans greatly improved the acute treatment of migraine, a large percentage of patients still lack adequate treatment. A recent study by [CONTACT_435314] (AMPP) concluded that 40% of epi[INVESTIGATOR_541210]; the most frequent complaints were headache- related disability (19%) 
and dissatisfaction with current medications (15% ).
[2]  In addition, concerns  about cardiovascular  
safety are believed to limit the prescription of triptans to less than 50% of migraineurs in the US. 
[3]   Hence, there is a significant unmet need for novel migraine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15128] a distinct 
mechanism of action from triptans. One such agent is lasmiditan (COL- 144). Unlike any 
approved treatment for acute migraine, lasmiditan selectively targets 5- HT 1F receptors on 
neurons in the central and peripheral trigeminal system to alleviate migraine, and lacks the 
vasoconstrictor activity inherent with triptans.   
 Lasmiditan is being developed as a novel acute therapy for migraine and to fulfill significant 
unmet  needs in migraine patients with risk factors for undiagnosed cardiovascular disease, and 
those who respond poorly to their  current prescription medication for acute migraine. The 
current mainstay migraine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541211] (‘triptans’), developed 
for their potent cranial vasoconstrictor  properties .
[4]  Triptans  are selective 5- HT 1B/1D receptor 
agonists and mediate their vasoconstrictor activity via 5- HT 1B receptors expressed on vascular 
smooth  muscle. [5]   As large numbers of patients were exposed to triptans, it was  established 
through post -marketing surveillance that their vasoconstrictor mechanism of action also 
conferred a risk of serious cardiovascular adverse events, some fatal. [3]  Consistent with their 
common pharmacology, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan and naratriptan all 
induced comparable dose- dependent contraction of isolated human coronary arteries .[5,6,7]   
Because of the liability of triptans to cause coronary vasospasm, they are contraindicated in patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD), and it is strongly recommended that they 
are not  prescribed to patients with risk factors for undiagnosed CAD (e.g., hypertension,  
hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, male over 40 years of age) without first undergoing a 
thorough cardiovascular  evaluation.  
 Treatment of migraineurs with known cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors is  
particularly challenging because the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, claudication,  
diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are all higher in individuals with migraine 
compared with the general population.
[8] Many migraineurs who were previously eligible for 
triptan therapy may become ineligible as they age and develop cardiovascular disease and/or 
associated risk factors. For thes e patients, there is a pressing  need for an effective migraine 
therapy with a non- vascular mechanism of action.  
 This study is a Phase [ADDRESS_705664] with > 470-fold higher affinity 
(Ki 2.21 nM) for the 5- HT 1F receptor than for 5- HT 1B/1D receptors in radioligand binding assays.  
Based on activation of G proteins, the agonist efficacy of lasmiditan  at the 5- HT 1F receptor was 
~80% that of 5- HT.  Lasmiditan is a pyridinoylpi[INVESTIGATOR_435287], structurally unrelated to 
existing migraine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Lasmiditan (1 µM) was examined for its binding affinity at more 
than 50 other GPCRs, ion channels, and transporter sites, and had no significant affinities 
except at the benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_541212] A channel (K i 0.29 µM).  Unlike  
diazepam,  lasmiditan  did not potentiate GABA currents in a human cloned GABA A channel 
functional assay, and hence this binding affinity was not considered to be biologically relevant.  
  
In rodent models of migraine, selective 5- HT 1F receptor agonists inhibited trigeminal nociceptive 
processing without affecting blood vessel tone .[9,10,11]  Unlike tr iptans, lasmiditan  did not constrict 
rabbit saphenous vein,[9] an assay predictive of human coronary artery constriction.[12]  
Lasmiditan is under development as a neurally acting treatment for migraine without the 
vasoconstrictor liability of triptans . 
 
4.[ADDRESS_705665] been completed in Europe using intravenous ( IV), sublingual, and 
oral formulations of lasmiditan .  Two European Phase [ADDRESS_705666] been completed with 
lasmiditan in the acute treatment of migraine.  
 
Lasmiditan was well tolerated in healthy volunteers following 20 minute IV infusions at dose 
levels of 0.1 to 20 mg with few AEs reported (clinical study H8H- BD-LACA ).  There was a clear 
increase in the number of AEs reported following [ADDRESS_705667] were rated as mild.  The number of AEs reported following 60 mg of lasmiditan decreased significantly when the rate of infusion was reduced from 3 to 1 mL/min 
and the infusion time was increased to [ADDRESS_705668] dose levels (120 and 180 mg of lasmiditan). The most frequently reported AEs considered to be related to t he 
study drug were somnolence, paresthesia, dizziness and hot flushes.  These occurred with rapid onset, generally within [ADDRESS_705669] dose of 180 mg was administered.  
 A Phase 2, placebo- controlled clinical study to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous 
lasmiditan in the acute treatment of migraine has been completed (clinical study COL MIG- 201).  
This study was blinded with regard to dose and treatment allocation and employed doses of lasmiditan from 2.5 to 45 mg IV infused over 20 minutes.  One hundred and thirty (130) patients 
were treated in the study and no serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported.  The only AE 
that was clearly dose related was paresthesia; however, most of these events were reported as

  Proprietary and Confidential  mild.  Lasmiditan given by [CONTACT_541238], showing a statistically significant dose -response relationship. 
 A Phase 1 placebo- controlled study assessed the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetic 
(PK) profile of sublingual and oral lasmiditan (clinical study COL MIG- 102).  The sublingual 
route of administration was investigated using ascending single doses from [ADDRESS_705670] arm of the study, the safety and tolerability of 100 
mg and 400 mg of the oral solution formulation were evaluated in an additional cohort of 
subjects.  The tolerability of both the oral and sublingual route of administration was good.  However, the sublingual route did not show any advantage in comparison to the oral route of 
administration since there was no evidence of enhanced bioavailability in terms of exposure 
(C
max, AUC 0–t) or time to peak concentration (t max).  The oral route of administration was 
therefore selected for further study.  Oral doses of the solution formulation were generally well tolerated up to the maximum dose tested of 400 mg lasmiditan.  There were no clinically 
significant changes in safety parameters or clinical laboratory results.  
 
The assessment of bioequivalence of the oral solution and tablet formulations of 200 mg 
lasmiditan and of dose linearity of ascending doses of 50, 200 and 400 mg lasmiditan of a tablet 
formulation were investigated in a further clinical Phase 1 study (clinical study COL MIG- 103), 
including also the assessment of safety and tolerability.  In general, lasmiditan was well tolerated across all doses.  The most common AEs across all doses with a dose- related 
increase in frequency were fatigue and dizziness followed by [CONTACT_435316].  
 In the Thorough QT study (clinical study COL MIG- 105) which was designed, performed and 
analyzed in accordance with the ICH E14  guidance,
[13] the primary objective was to assess the 
effect of 100 mg lasmiditan and 400 mg lasmiditan on cardiac de - and re- polarization. The 
statistical evaluation of the primary variable revealed that lasmiditan caused no significant QT 
prolongation either at 100 mg or at 400 mg.  The results met the criteria for a negative thor ough 
QT/QTc study according to ICH E14 . [13] 
 
The bioavailability of lasmiditan 200 mg administered orally as a tablet formulation under fed 
and fasted conditions was investigated (clinical study COL MIG-104). A slight delay in the time 
to reach maximum plasma concentration was observed in the fed state. As in other Phase [ADDRESS_705671] common AEs across both conditions were 
somnolence, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension (with and without dizziness) and paresthesia.  
 The efficacy of oral lasmiditan in the acute treatment of migraine was evaluated in a Phase 2 
double- blind, placebo- controlled, parallel- group dose- ranging study conducted in five European 
countries (clinical study COL MIG- 202).  A total of 391 subjec ts treated a single migraine attack 
at home using one of four doses of lasmiditan (50, 100, 200 or 400 mg) or placebo.  The 
proportion of patients with headache relief (moderate or severe headache becoming mild or none) or who were pain free showed statistically significant dose responses at 2 hours after 
treatment. Associated symptoms such as nausea, phonophobia and photophobia also responded to lasmiditan.  There were no clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory 
parameters, ECGs or vital signs . 
 
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 22% of the subject s receiving 
placebo and by 65, 73, 86 and 84% of subject s receiving 50, 100, [ADDRESS_705672] symptoms characteristic of triptan use were rare and occurred with a similar frequency in the placebo and active groups. 
 
During the clinical development of lasmiditan there were no deaths and no subjects were withdrawn due to adverse events.  One serious adverse event ( SAE) of moderate dizziness 
leading to overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435290]- ranging study.  This occurr ed 
in a female patient given 200 mg lasmiditan, and  resolved without sequelae.  
 More details on the preclinical and clinical experience with lasmiditan are given in the Clinical 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
[14] 
 
4.3 Minimization of Risk   
The dose levels of lasmiditan (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) have previously been tested and 
shown to be safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects and in patient s with acute migraine. 
 
Lasmiditan given orally at doses up to [ADDRESS_705673] or operate machinery for 12 h ours after treatment.  
 
Rescue medication will be permitted after completion of the 2 hour assessments if the migraine does not respond (subject is not headache pain free).  A second dose of randomized study drug 
may be taken  up to [ADDRESS_705674] dose as long as no other rescue medication has been 
used.  
 If the migraine responds within 2 hours (headache becomes pain free) but then recurs  after [ADDRESS_705675] 
dose.  
 
To insure standardization, all adverse events will be assessed usi ng WHO Toxicity Criteria 
(Appendix 1).  
 
4.4 Potential Benefit  
Migraine is a common disorder with a prevalence of 11.7% (17.1% of women and 5.4% of men)  
based on a large population survey of US households. Nearly a third of sufferers experience 
three  or more migraine attacks a month, and over half report that the attacks cause severe  
disability or require bed  rest. [15] Despi[INVESTIGATOR_541213], it is estimated that less than half of all migraineu rs use prescription medication to 
manage their disease, indicating a substantial unmet medical need . [16] 
 In the completed Phase 2 studies, lasmiditan  was effective in alleviating migraine attacks when 
given by [CONTACT_541239]. This study will recruit patients meeting the 
internationally recognized diagnostic criteria for migraine set by [CONTACT_541240], Inc.                                      IND 103,420

4.5 Dose Rationale  
The dose levels of lasmiditan  to be used in this study (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) have been 
tested and shown to be safe and well tolerated in both healthy subjects and in patients with 
acute migraine. In a Phase [ADDRESS_705676] of the Study  
This study will be conducted according to the protocol and in compliance with current principles of Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH). Further

5.5 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
This is a prospective randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study in patients  with 
disabling migraine (MIDAS score ≥11).  Approximately 2968 subjects will be screened and 
randomized ([ADDRESS_705679] dose) to ensure that approximately 2280 
subjects ([ADDRESS_705680] dose ) treat a migraine attack and complete 
the Treatment Period.   Subjects will be stratified (yes or no) for use of concomitant medications 
that reduce the frequency of migraine epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
 
Subjects will be asked to treat a migraine attack with study drug on an outpatient basis. 
Subjects will be provided with a dosing card containing a dose for initial treatment and a second dose to be used for rescue or recurrence of migraine.  Each subject’s study participation will 
consist of a screening visit ( Visit 1 ) with a telephone contact [INVESTIGATOR_874] 7 days to confirm eligibility, a 
Treatment Period of up to 8 weeks, and an EoS visit ( Visit 2 ) within two week s (14 days ) of 
treating a migraine attack.  The total time on study is approximately 12 weeks.  
 
At the Screening visit (Visit 1)  subjects will provide written informed consent and authorize 
HIPAA . Study eligibility will be assessed on the basis of medical history including migraine 
history, baseline physical ex amination (including height and weight) , vital signs, clinical 
laboratory tests, 12- lead ECG and responses to the MIDAS questionnaire. Subjects will be 
asked about any concomitant medication use as well as any cardiovascular (CV) events in the 
last 6 months and/or related resource utilization such as visits to cardiologists, procedures, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], new treatments or treatment adjustments for CV disease.  A C- SSRS will be 
completed. Subjects will be giv en an electronic diary and be trained on its use to record 
information about their migraine, dosing  of their migraine and post -dose assessments . Subjects 
will be randomized, dispensed study drug and instructed not to treat an attack until their 
eligibility  has been confirmed by [CONTACT_541241].  Subjects 
will be randomly assigned treatment as described in Section 5.5.1.   
 
Telephone contact . Within [ADDRESS_705681] will be reminded on the use of the diary and on dosing a migraine with study 
drug. 
 
Treatment Period:  Subjects will be asked to treat their next migraine attack within [ADDRESS_705682] dose as long as 
no other rescue medication has been used . If the migraine  does  respond within 2 hours

Subjects with test results which do not meet the above inclusion/exclusion criteria may have the 
underly ing test repeated once if it is thought to represent a laboratory error, a reversible, 
clinically insignificant intermittent condition, or is not consistent with the subject’s historical 
values.  If inclusion/exclusion criteria are not met after the repeat test, the subject should not be 
enrolled in the study.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_705694].   Protocol deviations will be documented by [CONTACT_541243] . Protocol deviations should be submitted to the 
Institutional Review Boar d (IRB)/Ethics Committee  (EC), in accordance with the site’s IRB/EC

the reason in the subject’s study records. 
 
Premature withdrawal may occur for any of the following reasons:  
• Non-compliance with the protocol requirements  
• Pregnancy  
• Death 
• Adverse event (AE)  
• Subject request  
• Investigator request  
• Sponsor request  
 
For subjects who are lost to follow -up (i.e., those subjects whose status is unclear because they 
fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to withdraw), the Investigator should 
show “due diligence” by [CONTACT_541244], e.g., dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc.  All subjects prematurely discontinuing from the trial (prior to  EoS/Visit 2), regardles s of cause, 
must be seen for EoS/ Visit 2.  Subjects that withdraw from the study prior to dosing a single 
attack should return to the clinic for EoS/Visit [ADDRESS_705697]’s historical values.  The subject will be given a new 
screeni ng number.  In this case the subject should not be re- randomized until eligibility is 
confirmed.   If the subject is not re -randomized he/she will be considered a screen failure. 
 
7.2 Description of Study Drug  
For study purposes  lasmiditan  and matching placebo are all referred to as study drug.  
 
7.3 Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant  medications (including devices), for migraine or pain during the 90 days (3 months) 
prior to study enrollment and concomitant medication used to treat other  medical conditions 
during the 30 days (1 month) prior to study enrollment will be recorded during Screening/Visit 
1.  
 Any changes in dosage or new medications added as a result of intercurrent illness during the 
subject’s time on study must be recorded i n the CRFs .  
 
7.3.1  Rescue Medication  
Rescue medication will be permitted after completion of the 2 hour assessments  if the migraine 
does not respond (subject is not headache pain free) . If the migraine does not respond within [ADDRESS_705698] diary.  
 7.3.2  Recurrence Medication  
If the migraine responds within 2 hours (headache becomes pain free) but  then recurs after [ADDRESS_705699]’s participation in the 
study from Screening  /Visit 1  through EoS/ Visit 2:  
• Any investigational treatment other than lasmiditan . 
• All other symptom modifying treatments  (e.g. antiemetics ) for migraine except rescue or 
recur rence medication as detailed in Section 7.3.1 and 7.3.2 . 
• If a patient  requires the initiation of migraine prophylaxis  (concomitant medication to 
reduce the frequency of migraine epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]) or a change in ongoing migraine prophylaxis 
after the Screening/Visit [ADDRESS_705700] at home throughout the study .  Prior to discharge from  
Screening/ Visit 1  subjects will be given study drug to treat a single migraine attack  and a 
second dose for rescue or recurrence .   Information on the time and  date of each  dose (initial 
treatment along with the use of rescue medication or treatment of recurrence) will be recorded by [CONTACT_541245] .  Subjects will be instructed to return all unused study drug  
to the clinic at EoS/ Visit 2 .   
 
7.6 Randomization and Blinding  
Subjects will be randomized through a central randomization process  by [CONTACT_435322]/Visit 1.  A randomization number and study drug card number will be assigned for 
dosing.  Lasmi ditan and matching placebo will be provided in double- blinded treatment packs . 
 
7.[ADDRESS_705701] being discontinued from the study, irrespective of whether 
the Investigator ultimately agrees with the event being related to study drug (lasmiditan) .  Most 
often, study drug discontinuation and knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study subject who presents with an emergency condition. The Inv estigator 
will have the ability to break the blind for any subject through the centralized randomization system ( IRT). However,  the Investigator should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_1034]’s 
medical monitor or their designee to discuss the subject’s emergency situation and the need to 
unblind prior to unblinding any subject , but must contact [CONTACT_541246]. The Sponsor’s medical monitor or their designee will also 
have the ability to break the blind for the Investigator while remaining blinded via the centralized 
randomization system  if the treating Investigator requests this   The blind may be broken in the 
case of a pregnancy should the subject desire this information. Any subject for whom the blind 
is broken is to be discontinued from future study treatment .  The date, time and reason for 
breaking the blind are to be recorded in the subject’s source documents.  
 
7.7.2 Unblinding for Regulatory Authorities  
In cases where unblinding is required for the purposes of reporting expedited safety events to 
country specific re gulatory agencies or Ethics Committees, the unblinding will be performed by

Hematology:  white blood cell (WBC) count with differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, 
eosinophils, monocytes, basophils), hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and red blood cell 
(RBC) count.   
 
Serum Chemistry Profile:  albumin, alkaline phosphatase (AP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium, chloride, bicarbonate, 
creatinine, glucose, phosphate, potassium, sodium, total bilirubin, total protein, total cholesterol, 
HDL, and triglycerides . 
 
Urinalysis:  protein, glucose, nitrite, ketones, blood (hemoglobin), pH, specific gravity, 
microscopic bacteria, RBCs, WBCs, casts, crystals, and cells. Microscopic  examination of 
sediment will be performed only if the results of the urinalysis dipstick evaluation are positive.  
 
For WOCBP, a serum pregnancy test for β-HCG will be performed at the Screening/ Visit 1.  If 
a urine pregnancy test is positive during the study the subject will be discontinued from the 
study after confirmation with a positive serum  βHCG .   A subject with a positive urine βHCG 
must not be dosed unless a negative serum βHCG is obtained.  The confirmatory serum test 
may be performed at the local clinical laboratory.  At EoS/Visit [ADDRESS_705713] will be done.  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Abnormal and Clinically Significant Results  
The Investigator must categorize all abnormal hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis laboratory 
values as either CS or  NCS. Clinical significance is defined as any variation in laboratory 
parameters, which has medical consequences that result in an alteration in the subject’s 
medical care. The Investigator will use the WHO Toxicity Criteria (see Appendix 1) as a guide 
when evaluating the clinical significance of all abnormal clinical laboratory results.  In case of 
CS laboratory results, the Investigator will continue to monitor the subject with additional 
laboratory assessments until (1) values have reached normal range and/or baseline levels, or 
(2) the Investigator has judged that the abnormal values are not related to the administration of 
study drug or other protocol -specific procedures. 
 
9.1.6  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
C-SSRS is a suicidal ideation rating scale  that rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation  
on a scale, ranging from "wish to be dead" to "active suicidal ideation with specific plan and 
intent”. The scale intends to prospectively identify and classify suicidal ideation and behavior 
based on a semi- structured interview by [CONTACT_435329].  Two versions of the C -SSRS will be used.  
 
• The screening version will be administered at Screening/ Visit 1  (Appendix 4). 
 
• The “since last visit” version will be administered at EoS/Visit 2  (Appendix 5). 
 If present, suicide ideation will be classified in  5 classes (1 -5), the intensity of suicidal ideation 
will be classified in 5 dimensions, and any suicidal behavior will be classified in 6 classes (actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts towards and attempt,  suicidal 
behavior, suicide).

Subjects will be trained on the use of the electronic diary at Screening/Visit 1. Efficacy data will 
be collected in an electronic diary for  an attack.   Subjects will record the date and time at which 
their migraine headache starts and when it first becomes moderate or severe.  They will also 
record the date and time of taking the first dose of study drug. 
 
Subjects will be asked to assess their headache severity at specified time points: 0 (pre dose), 
0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, [ADDRESS_705717] dose using the IHS four point headache severity 
rating scale (0 = no pain, 1 = mild pain, 2 = moderate pain, and 3 = severe pain). The need for 
rescue medication and second dosing of study drug or an alternative treatment will be assessed 
between 2 and 24 hour and at 48 hours .  Recurrence of  pain and second dosing of  study drug 
will be assessed between 2 and 24 hours and at 48 hours. 
 At the  same  time points, 0  (pre dose),  0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 24 and 48 hours,  subjects  will

9.[ADDRESS_705721] during his/her participation in an investigational study, in conjunction with the use of 
the drug, whether or not  product -related. During the treatment of a migraine with study drug 
subjects will be asked if they are feeling anything unusual that they have not felt with a migraine 
before. A ‘yes’ response will trigger an alert to the site to contact [CONTACT_541249], how long the symptoms lasted and how much the 
symptom(s) impacted them.  During the time between dosing, subjects will be asked how they 
are feeling. A response of ‘not well’ will trigger an alert to the site to contact [CONTACT_541250].   The occurrence 
of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_105]- directive questioning of the subject at each visit in the study.  
AEs may include, but are not  limited to : 
 
• Subjective or objective symptoms spontaneously offered by [CONTACT_3184]/or observed by 
[CONTACT_204418], and  
• Changes  in laboratory abnormalities that are clinically relevant as assessed by [CONTACT_435332] a medical intervention was initiated.  
 Disease signs, symptoms, and/or laboratory abnormalities already existing prior to the use of 
the product are not considered AEs after treatment unless they reoccur after the subject has recovered from the pre -existing condition or, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689];  they represent a 
clinically significant exacerbation in intensity or frequency.   AEs are collected from the time the 
subject signs the informed consent form  until the completion of EoS/ Visit 2.  AEs reported prior 
to dosing will be captured and considered non- treatment emergent AEs. AE reported 48 hours 
after dosing until the completion of EoS/Visit [ADDRESS_705722] be recorded in the site’s study records and the AE CRF with the following 
information:

  Proprietary and Confidential   
1. Relationship to Study Drug :  The Investigator must assess whether they  consider  an AE to 
be drug- related. In assessing this relationship, the Investigator must use information about 
the drug as outlined in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB), the subject’s pre- existent medical 
conditions/concurrent medication, and chronology of the event relative to drug administration. The following definitions will be used: 
 
• Reasonably or possibly related applies to those AEs that, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are considered by [CONTACT_737] (or 
other qualified physician) to have at least a possible relationship to study drug.  
 
• Not reasonably or not possibly related applies to those AEs that, after careful 
medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are considered by [CONTACT_3786] (or other qualified physician) to have no relationship, or no reasonable 
possibility of a rela tionship, to study drug.  
 
2. Event Severity:  The Investigator will be asked to assess the severity of the AE using the 
WHO Toxicity Criteria, as shown in Appendix 1.  The WHO criteria assign a grade of 1 
through 4 to indicate the severity of AEs. For AEs that are not listed in the WHO criteria, the 
Investigator will use medical judgment to assess the severity of the AE.   
 
The following are guidelines to be used by [CONTACT_541251]:  
• Mild - awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  
•    Moderate - discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity  
•    Severe - incapacitating with inability to work or perform usual activity  
•    Life Threatening 
 3. Duration: Start and end dates  and times,  or if continuing.  
 4. Action taken.  
 5. Whether it constitutes a SAE, per definition below.  
 6. Outcome: resolved, resolved/ with sequelae, continuing, death, or unknown (only for subjects that are lost to follow -up). 
 
 The investigator (or designee) should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the AE based on the 
sign, symptoms and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis, and not the individual signs/symptoms or laboratory abnormalities should be documents  in the subject’s 
source documentation and the CRF unless the etiology of the event is unknown.  An 
assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any changes in 
severity, the suspected relationship to study drug, the interventions required to treat it and the 
outcome.  
9.2.2  Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)  
A TEAE will be an AE that occurred during the study after the first dose of study drug or that 
was present prior to dosing and exacerbates after the first dose of st udy drug.   
 
9.2.3  Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following outcomes:

  Proprietary and Confidential  • Death: This includes death unrelated to the study drug (e.g. car accident).  If a subject dies 
during the study and an autopsy is performed, autopsy results will become part of the 
subject’s study chart and a copy should be sent to the Sponsor.  
• Life-threatening experience 
• Required or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: Exceptions will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a) 
elective or preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication 
under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug or b) treatment on an 
emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE and not 
resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a SAE when, based upon medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient and may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above.  
 
9.2.4  Unexpected Adverse Event   
An unexpected adverse event is defined as an AE, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the information in the Investigator’s Brochure for lasmiditan . 
 
9.[ADDRESS_705723] dose of study treatment at EoS/Visit 2.  At a minimum, 
a description of the event and the Investigator’s judgment of causality must be provided at the 
time of the initial report.  These preliminary reports will be followed by [CONTACT_541252][INVESTIGATOR_99606]-identified hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435296], autopsy reports, and other documents 
when requested and applicable.  
 Complications or progression of an initial SAE must be reported as a follow -up SAE Report to 
the original SAE, regardless of  when the follow -up information is received by [CONTACT_737] .  A 
follow -up SAE Report must be submitted within [ADDRESS_705724] continued or withdrew from study participation.  
 If the SAE was not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure and is thought to be related to study drug, the Sponsor or their designee may urgently require further information 
from the Investigator for regulatory authority reporting. The Sponsor may need to issue an 
Investigator Notification to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  
 The Investigator and study personnel should institute any supplemental investigations of SAEs 
based on their clinical judgment of likely causative factors. This may include clinical laboratory tests not specified in the protocol, histopathologic examinations, or consultations with 
CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, Inc.                                      IND 103,[ADDRESS_705725] resolved, returned to baseline, or are determined to be chronic or stable by [CONTACT_737] .  Other non- serious adverse events should be 
followed through the EoS/Visit  2.   
 
9.5 Reporting safety information to the IRB/EC  
The Investigator is responsible for following all local regulations for the reporting of safety 
information, including the reporting of SAEs to the IRB/ EC. 
The Investigator must promptly report to his or her IRB /EC all unanticipated problems involving 
risks to  subjects.  This includes death from any cause and all serious adverse events 
reasonably or possibly associated with the use of study drug.  It is recommended that all SAEs 
occurring at a site, regardless of causality, be reported to the site’s IRB/EC in accordance with 
the IRB/EC’s requirements.  
Lasmiditan has been filed under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the US 
FDA.  An SAE may require safety reports to be filed to regulatory agencies if the SAE is related 
to the study drug and is unexpected based upon the current Investigator’s Brochure.  In this 
case, the Investigator will receive a copy of the safety report as submitted to the regulatory 
agencies.  The Investigator is responsible for submitting the safety report (initial and follow- up) 
or other safety information (e.g., revised Investigator’s Brochure) to the IRB/EC in accordance with the IRB/EC’s requirements and keep a copy in their files.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_705726] be reported to the 
medical monitor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  Subjects who become pregnant 
will be withdrawn from the study.  The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, 
including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or 
absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  
 Pregnancy should be recorded on a subject’s source documents and a Pregnancy Notification 
and Outcome Form and reported by [CONTACT_435335] 9.3. A pregnancy, by [CONTACT_5071], i s not a SAE.   
Pregnancy follow -up should also be recorded and should include an assessment of the possible 
relationship to the study drug of any pregnancy outcome. Any pregnancy -related SAE (e.g. 
spontaneous abortion) or any other SAE experienced during pregnancy must be recorded on a separate SAE Report Form and reported per SAE reporting procedures in Section 9.[ADDRESS_705727] data for inclusion in the statistical analysis.  The efficacy analyses and baseline 
characteristics will be based on the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) and mITT population.  The pr imary 
analysis will be tested in the mITT population.   All safety analyses will be based on the Safety 
Population.  The Per Protocol Population will be used to support the ITT analyses.  
 All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a one-sided alpha level of 0.025. 
 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy  of lasmiditan versus placebo at [ADDRESS_705728] dose.   Analysis will be performed on the 
subset of subjects that dosed for rescue and on the subset that dosed for recurrence of migraine.  
 
Data from all investigative sites will be pooled for all planned analyses.  Analysis of individual 
site findings will be considered if necessary.  For  those measures that are analyzed using 
change from baseline scores, observed scores may also be presented descriptively.  
 
Any changes in the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment 
only if it changes a principal feature of the protocol.  Any other changes to the data analysis methods described in the protocol and the justification for making the change will be described 
in the statistical analysis plan as well as the clinical study report.  Additional exploratory 
analyses will be conducted as deemed appropriate.  All data listings, summaries and analyses 
will be performed by [CONTACT_471621].  
  
10.1 Sample Size  
This Phase 3 study is designed to demonstrate that lasmiditan is effective in the treatment of acute migraine in adult patients with and without aura. The sample size was estimated based on 
the 2 hour headache pain free and associated symptoms (nausea, phonophobia, and 
photophobia) free response rates observed in the Phase 2 study COL MIG-202. 
  
Dose  Pain free  Nausea free  Phonophobia

200 mg  18.8%  63.8%  59.4%  58.0%  
 For the primary endpoint of the proportion of patients pain free at 2 hours a sample size of  570 
evaluable subjects per arm provides power of >90% for the [ADDRESS_705729] conservative scenario (scenario 1) it was assumed that nausea would 
always be declared the MBS if it was present, regardless of the presence of other symptoms (phonophobia or photophobia).  The other 3 scenarios assumed lower likelihoods of nausea to 
be considered the MBS and allowed for the other symptoms (either phonophobia or 
photophobia) to be considered the MBS at a higher rate.  This resulted in power estimates of > 95% for MBS at a sample size of 570 for the lasmiditan 50 mg  dose and >99% for MBS at  
sample sizes of 450 to 570 per arm for the 100 mg dose across all 4 scenarios. For the 200 mg dose, an average power of 71% was estimated across five seeds under the most conservative 
scenario 1. In contrast, the 3 scenarios that did not declare nausea to be the default MBS  if it 
was present estimated a greater average power of 82.6% to 91%.

  Proprietary and Confidential  • Recurrence population : All randomized subjects who achieved headache pain free  at [ADDRESS_705732] characteristics will be obtained at the Screening/Visit 1 prior to randomization and will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_11763]. Summaries will include descriptive statistics for continuous measures (sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum) and for categorical measures (sample size, frequency and percent ages ).  Treatments will be 
compared descriptively by [CONTACT_541254]’s c hi-square or  Fisher’s exact test for categorical data.  
 The results of these tests will be used in a descriptive way to highlight potential imbalances 
between the treatment groups.  Subject characteristics may include, but are not limited to: age, 
gender, race/ethnicity, height, weight, BMI, and migraine history .

Headache pain free at 2 hours will be defined as a reduction in headache severity from 
moderate (2) or severe (3) at baseline to none (0) two hours after dosing with study drug.  MBS  
free at 2 hours will be defined as  a ‘no’ response to the presence of the symptom (either 
nausea, phonophobia, or photophobia)  that was identified as MBS at predose, [ADDRESS_705734] electronic diary for which:  
0 (min) <  date/ time rescue medication (diary)  –  date/ time of dosing (diary) < 120 (min).

significance.  If one of the analyses is not statistically significant, then all subsequent analyses 
will be exploratory rather than confirmatory . 
 
10.5.4  Other Efficacy Analyses 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Headache relief  
The proportion of subjects with headache relief (moderate or  severe headache at baseline, 
which became mild or none) at [ADDRESS_705736]  dose will be evaluated.  The time course to 
headache relief will be explored up to 48 hours . Kaplan- Meier analysis will be performed to 
compare time course to headache relief between lasmiditan 200 mg and placebo, lasmiditan 
100 mg and placebo  and lasmiditan 50 mg and placebo.  
 
10.5.4 .2 Headache recurrence  
The proportion of subje cts with headache recurrence (moderate or  severe headache at 
baseline, which became pain free at [ADDRESS_705737]-dose ) will be evaluated based on first dose.  The frequency of recurrence will be compared 
by [CONTACT_541256].  The significance 
level of this exploratory analysis will be a nominal one- sided 0.05.  
 10.5. 4.3 Headache rescue  
The requirement for  rescue medication at 2 hours and between 2 and 24 hours and 24- 8 hours 
(yes or no) will be evaluated based on first dose. The information on rescue medication use will 
be presented descriptively by [CONTACT_541257].  
 10.5. 4.4 Associated Sy mptoms of Migraine  
Descriptive analysis of t he associated symptoms of migraine, nausea, phon ophobia and 
photophobia,  will be performed at 2 hours. Free dom from  each symptom will  be defined as a 
‘no’ response to the presence of the symptom 2 hours after dosing with study drug.   
 10.5. 4.5 Additional analyses 
Summary statistics will be presented on presence of vomiting, disability (4 point scale: not at all

not achieve headache pain free at 2 hours  and completed the 2 hour assessments prior  to 
taking the second dose.  
 
Summary statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_541258] 
(pain free and MBS free) along with the time course to headache relief explored up to [ADDRESS_705739] 
that achieved headache pain free at 2 hours, completed the 2 hour assessments,  and then 
experienced documented recurrence of mild, moderate, or severe migraine pain prior to taking 
the second dose.   
 
Summary statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_541259] 
(pain free and MBS free) along with the time course to headache relief explored up to [ADDRESS_705740] more than one symptom (nausea, phonophobia or photophobia) 
but do not select one as the MBS prior to dosing, will be considered inevaluable for the MBS endpoint as there is no MBS selected to evaluate.  In the case of subjects that have only one 
symptom (nausea, phonophobia, or photophobia) at predose but do not select a MBS, the one 
symptom will be considered the MBS for analysis. 
 
For subjects who do not record a symptom rating, that symptom (pain, photophobia, 
phonophobia or nausea) will be assumed to be present at all  time points where data are 
missing. Subjects who do not provide a headache severity rating at baseline will be assumed to 
have all four symptoms (pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) at all  time points.  If 
recurrence medication is taken within [ADDRESS_705741] and time point.  
 Where appropriate, safety variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_74305], 
separated by [CONTACT_3219], and dose (the first  dose and the second dose for recurrence  or 
rescue or  use of alternative rescue medication),  and time of assessment. Descriptive statistics 
for quantitative variables will include: n, mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation. Descriptive statistics for qualitative variables will include frequency counts and 
percent ages . 
 
10.8.1 Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_67503] (MedDRA) preferred terms, 
and all summary tables for AEs will be organized by [CONTACT_32219]. Frequency counts and 
percent ages  will be presented for subjects with AEs within each system organ class and

dose for recurrence or rescue medication) for AE relationship and AE severity.  If multiple 
intensities are reported for a given AE for a subject, the most severe intensity will be counted. A 
separate, similar analysis will be conducted for TEAEs.  
 An AE with  the date of onset on or within 48 hours after a dose of study drug, or an event that 
worsens in intensity within 48 hours of a dose of study drug will be considered a TEAE.  An AE that occurs in the interval after 48 hours of dosing until EoS/Visit [ADDRESS_705742] results from the Screening /Visit 1 to EoS/Visit 2,

 17. APPENDIX 2. INTERNATIONAL HEADACHE SOCIETY 
DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA  
 
1. MIGRAINE  
 
1.1. Migraine without aura   
 Description:  
Recurrent headache disorder manifesting in attacks lasting 4- 72 hours. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_541223], pulsating quality, moderate or severe intensity, aggravation by [CONTACT_541268]/or photophobia and 
phonophobia 
Diagnostic criteria:  
A. At least 5 attacks
1 fulfilling criteria B -D 
B. Headache attacks lasting 4- 72 hours (untreated or unsuccessfully treated)2;3;[ADDRESS_705751] two of the following characteristics:  
1. unilateral location5;6  
2. pulsating quality7  
3. moderate or severe pain intensity  
4. aggravation by [CONTACT_25442] ( eg, walking or 
climbing stairs) 
D. During headache at least one of the following:  
1. nausea and/or vomiting 
2. photophobia and phonophobia8  
E. Not attributed to another disorder9  
 
Notes:  
1. Differentiating between 1.[ADDRESS_705752] 1- 72 hours (although the evidence for untreated durations of less than 2 
hours in children requires corroboration by [CONTACT_541269]).  
4. When attacks occur on ≥15 days/month for >3 months, code as 1.1 Migraine without aura and as 
1.5.1 Chronic migraine.   
5. Migraine headache is commonly bilateral in young children; an adult pattern of unilateral pain 
usually emerges in late adolescence or early adult life.  
6. Migraine headache is usually frontal temporal . Occipi[INVESTIGATOR_541224] , whether unilateral or 
bilateral, is rare and calls for diagnostic caution; many cases are attributable to structural lesions.  
7. Pulsating me ans throbbing or varying with the heartbeat.  
CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  IND 103,[ADDRESS_705753] any of the disorders listed in 
groups 5- 12, or history and/or  physical and/or neurological examinations do suggest such disorder 
but it is ruled out by [CONTACT_287465], or such disorder is present but attacks do not occur for the first time in close temporal relation to the disorder.  
 
 
1.2  Migraine with aura 
 Description:  
Recurrent disorder manifesting in attacks of reversible focal neurological symptoms that usually develop gradually over 5- [ADDRESS_705754] for less than 60 minutes. Headache with the 
features of migraine without aura usually follows the aura symptoms. Less commonly, headache 
lacks migrainous features or is completely absent.  
Diagnostic criteria:  
A. At least 2 attacks fulfilling criterion B  
B. Migraine aura fulfilling criteria B and C for one of the sub- forms 1.2.1 -1.2.6  
C. Not attributed to ano ther disorder
1  
 
 Notes: 
1. History and physical and neurological examinations do not suggest any of the disorders listed in 
groups 5- 12, or history and/or physical and/or neurological examinations do suggest such disorder 
but it is ruled out by [CONTACT_287465], or such disorder is present but attacks do not occur 
for the first time in close temporal relation to the disorder.

Medication Overuse Headache 
Diagnostic criteria:  
A. Headache1 present on ≥15 days/month fulfilling criteria C and D  
B. Regular overuse2 for ≥3 months of one or more drugs that can be taken for acute and/or 
symptomatic treatment of headache3  
C. Headache has developed or markedly worsened during medication overuse 
D. Headache resolves or reverts to its previous pattern within 2 m onths after discontinuation 
of overused medication4  
 
Notes:  
1. The headache associated with medication overuse is variable and often has a peculiar pattern with 
characteristics shifting, even within the same day, from migraine- like to those of tension- type 
headache.  
2. Overuse is defined in terms of duration and treatment days per week. What is crucial is that 
treatment occurs both frequently and regularly, ie, on 2 or more days each week. Bunching of 
treatment days with long periods without medication intake, practi ced by [CONTACT_541270], is much 
less likely to cause medication- overuse headache and does not fulfil criterion B.  
3. MOH can occur in headache- prone patients when acute headache medications are taken for other 
indications.  
4. A period of 2 months after cessation of overuse is stipulated in which improvement (resolution of 
headache, or reversion to its previous pattern) must occur if the diagnosis is to be definite. Prior to 
cessation, or pending improvement within [ADDRESS_705755] be discarded.  
 
 
Medication overuse headache (MOH) as defined by [CONTACT_541271]:  
o Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] ≥ 10 days a month during the 90 days prior to screening 
o Combination medications ( e.g., Fiorinal®) ≥ 10 days a month  
o NSAIDS or other simple medications > 14 days a month during the 90 days prior to 
screening 
o Triptans or ergots ≥ [ADDRESS_705756]  
The MIDAS (Migraine Disability Assessment) questionnaire was put together to help you measure the  
impact your headaches have on your life. The information on this questionnaire is also helpful for your  
primary care provider to determine the level of pain and disability caused by [CONTACT_541272].  
 
INSTRUCTIONS: Please answer the following questions about ALL of the headaches you have had over the last [ADDRESS_705757] 3 months did you miss work or school  
because of your headaches?  
__________ 2.  How many days in the last 3 months was your productivity at work or  
school reduced by [CONTACT_125012]? (Do not  
include days you counted in question 1 where you missed work or  
school.)  
 
__________ 3. On how many days in the last 3 months did you not do household work  
(such as housework, home repairs and maintenance, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], caring  
for children and relatives) because of your headaches? 
 
__________ 4. How many days in the last 3 months was your productivity in household  
work reduced by [CONTACT_435367]? (Do not  
include days you counted in question 3 where you did not do household  
work.)  
 
__________ 5. On how many days in the last 3 months did you miss family, social or  
leisure activities because of your headaches?  
 
__________ Total (Questions 1- 5) 
 __________ A. On how many days in the last [ADDRESS_705758] a headache? (If a 
headache lasted more than 1 day, count each day.)  
__________ B. On a scale of 0 - 10, on average how painful were these headaches? 
(where  0 = no pain at all, and 10 = pain as bad as it can be.)  
 
 
Scoring: After you have filled out this questionnaire, add the total number of days from questions 1 to 5 
(ignore A and B).

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)  Past X Years or  
Lifetime  
Actual Attempt:  
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part 
thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to die associated 
with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or 
harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury 
results, this is considered an attempt.  
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be 
inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but 
they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.

Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609]. Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an 
attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose

Behavio r was in part thou ght of as method to kill oneself. I ntent

from the behavio r or circumstance s. For example, a highly lethal act that i s clearly not an 
accident so no other intent but suic ide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumpin g from

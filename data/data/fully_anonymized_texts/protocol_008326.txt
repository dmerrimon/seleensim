SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
 
Aim #1: To determine the impact of menopause-related sleep fragmentation on met abolic and 
behavioral biomarkers of body fat gain using an experimental sleep disrupti on paradigm to fragment 
sleep in healthy female volunteers 
Hypothesis 1a: Experimental sleep fragmentation will result in an adve rse adipokine profile as a 
metabolic biomarker for body fat gain 
Hypothesis 1b: Experimental sleep fragmentation will result in increased hunger a nd caloric intake 
Hypothesis 1c: Sleep disruption due to hot flashes will result in an adve rse adipokine profile and 
increased hunger and caloric intake 
Aim #2: To examine if hot flashes are associated with metabolic and beh avioral biomarkers of body 
fat gain using an experimental hormone suppression paradigm in healthy women 
Hypothesis 2: Hot flash frequency will correlate with a worse adipokine  profile and increased 
hunger and caloric intake 
Aim #3: To determine if estradiol withdrawal adversely affects metaboli c and behavioral 
biomarkers of body fat gain using an experimental hormone suppression paradigm in he althy 
women 
Hypothesis 3: Experimental withdrawal of estradiol will correlate with a worse adipokine profile 
and increased hunger and caloric intake 
Aims 1–3 Exploratory Hypotheses: 
1) Experimental sleep fragmentation mimicking menopause-related sle ep disruption will reduce 
resting energy expenditure. 2) Baseline levels of total body fat and vi sceral adiposity will influence PARTNERS HUMAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE

3) Negative mood state will correlate independently with an adve rse adipokine profile and increased 
hunger and caloric intake. 
 
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Obesity is highly prevalent in midlife and older women. Over 50% of women gain body fat during 
the menopause transition, unrelated to chronological aging, increasing the likelihood of cardio-
metabolic diseases after menopause. While these body composition change s are attributed to E2 
withdrawal, other menopause-related factors likely contribute to adiposit y because: 1) body fat 
gains are not uniform despi[INVESTIGATOR_344423]-estrogenism, and 2) body fat accrues 
during the MT, when E2 continues to be produced intermittently. Sleep fragme ntation related to HF 
occurs in almost half of midlife women and may be an important facto r driving risk for body fat 
gain, but its impact on metabolic and behavioral biomarkers of body fat gain has not been 
investigated. This sleep fragmentation results commonly from HF, which occur in 2/[ADDRESS_427661] of these core menopause symptoms on body fat gain will inform

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
Overview  
Forty women ages 18–[ADDRESS_427662]-dose depot leuprolide to induce hypo-E2 in all women and generate HF in approximately 
2/3, thereby [CONTACT_344440] (see Schema ). As part of the protocol, subjects will be admitted 
to the BWH Clinical And Translational Science Center/Center for Clinical Investigation (CCI) 
inpatient unit for a total of 10 nights over a 2-month period (see Schema ). Assessments will be 
divided into 2 sleep blocks. Each SB includes 2 nights during which sleep i s undisturbed and 3 
nights during which sleep is experimentally fragmented. Using PSG, s leep patterns will be 
experimentally interrupted to the same target level for all subjects  during all  fragmented nights using 
auditory procedures to mimic the menopausal hot flash-associated sleep m aintenance problem. The 
in-lab sleep blocks will be conducted: 1) during the mid-to- late follicula r phase of the menstrual Provide a brief paragraph summarizing prior experience important for understanding the

4  cycle when E2 is high; and 2) after at least [ADDRESS_427663] an ad li b diet. Fasting adipokine levels 
will be measured and leptin levels will be obtained to determine  the 24-hour leptin profile under 
standardized eucaloric diet conditions. Food intake and macronutrient c omposition will be assessed 
as key behavioral biomarkers for body fat gain when the diet is ad lib. Hunge r will be measured 
under both eucaloric and ad lib dietary conditions. Secondary and exploratory measures of objective 
HF using skin conductance monitors, negative mood/affect, reward seeking be haviors, and 
appetite/food preference will also be obtained. Behavioral measures will  continue to be assessed at 
home after the 2nd SB is complete.

Study Procedures Overview  
 
 
Screening Phase (1-2 months) 
 Telephone/Pre-screening : Consent to screen will be obtained orally on the phone for the init ial 
screening procedures and diaries. Women who verbally consent to screenin g and are interested in 
participating in this trial will answer some questions by [CONTACT_344446] s preliminary eligibility. The 
Berlin Questionnaire will be administered to screen for sleep apnea, a nd questions about general 
medical and mental health will be asked to screen for any major  exclusion criteria. Those who are 
eligible and interested will be scheduled for an initial remote scre ening and research consent visit 
with a study clinician. 
  
 Screening visit 1a (remote) : Screening visit 1a will be conducted remotely. Written informed 
consent will be obtained via electronic signature [CONTACT_325154] e-cons ent template and initial 
eligibility criteria will be assessed by a clinician, including a medical and psychiatric interview, and 
sleep interview. All women who sign the consent form will be assign ed a study identification 
number regardless of eligibility status. Eligible participants will start monitoring their menstrual 
cycles and tracking their sleep after this visit. 
 
 Screening Visit 1b (in-person):  At this visit, a clinician will conduct a physical exam, and a  blood 
draw will be taken for screening assays (e.g., CBC, glucose, insulin, HCG, TSH), for baseline levels 
of adipokines, metabolic and reproductive hormones, and for measures of immune function related 
to sleep and menopause. Once lab results are reviewed by a study clinici an, final eligibility will be 
assessed. Eligible participants will be scheduled for Sleep Block 1, leuprolide injection, and dual-
energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. 
 
Sleep Block 1 (10 days – two weeks before GnRH Agonist injection) 
 Subjects will be admitted for two five night stays within the BWH C linical And Translational 
Science Center/Center for Clinical Investigation (CCI) inpatient unit. Subjects will also complete 
at-home procedures, including an at-home PSG procedure. Subjects may log mea ls before inpatient 
admission and for up to [ADDRESS_427667] Injection (1 day) 
 Subjects will come to one of the outpatient research units to be give n an injection of leuprolide 
(GnRH agonist). The timing of ovulation will have been previously determined  based on the 
collection of at least [ADDRESS_427668] 
is not pregnant and blood will be drawn to measure reproductive hormone levels. 
 
Sleep Block 2 (10 days – [ADDRESS_427669] Injection) 
 Subjects will be admitted for two five night stays within the BWH C linical And Translational Briefly describe study procedures.  Include any local site restrictions, for example , “Subjects 
enrolled at Partners will not participate in the pharmacokinetic portion of the s tudy.” Describe 
study endpoints.

8  Science Center/Center for Clinical Investigation (CCI) inpatient unit. Subjects will also complete 
at-home procedures, including an at-home PSG procedure. Subjects may log mea ls before inpatient 
admission and for up to 7 days after discharge with the app MealLoggerTM. 
 
Follow-up Phase (4-12 weeks or until symptoms resolve) 
 Follow-up phone call from the study coordinator 4 weeks after the final study v isit and every 4 
weeks thereafter to confirm resumption of menses and cessation of hot flashes (if t hey occurred). 
 Study staff will also collect food and appetite measures that wer e recorded by [CONTACT_344447] 2 
 Subjects who do not have resumption of menses or who continue to have hot flashes 4 months after 
receiving the leuprolide injection (3 months after final visit) will be referred to their routine medical 
provider for evaluation. 
 A study summary letter will be sent to subjects once the final follow-up phone call  has occurred. If 
there are any abnormal laboratory results listed in the letter that ha ve not yet been discussed with 
the subject, a study clinician will call the subject to discuss prior to sending the le tter. 
 
Detailed Description of Sleep Blocks 
Assessments will be divided into 2 sleep blocks, each of which l asts 9 nights/[ADDRESS_427670].  
 At-home procedures during the Sleep Block: Subjects will complete four days of at-home 
procedures before their admission to the CCI inpatient unit. On the 1st, 2nd, and 4th days, subjects 
will eat eucaloric meals provided by [CONTACT_344448]. On the 3rd day, subjects will be given 
food provided by [CONTACT_344449], and will be allowed to consume as much as 
desired at home while logging their meals, snacks and drinks. On the 2nd night of the sleep block, 
subjects will come to Brigham and Women’s to have an at-home ambulator y PSG machine attached; 
this machine will be removed the following morning when subjects ar rive for breakfast. Eucaloric 
diets will approximate the current American women’s diet, with approxi mately 15% protein, 50% 
carbohydrates, and 30% fat. Subjects will select each eucaloric me al from options prepared by [CONTACT_344450]; this selection will be done in advance of sleep blocks. If a subject would like to 
change their meal preferences, they will be permitted to do so a s long as the change can be 
accommodated by [CONTACT_344448]. They will be asked to finish me als and log any 
deviations of the eucaloric diet. For each day with an ad lib diet, caloric intake and macronutrient 
composition will be calculated and analyzed with Nutrition Data System for Research software after 
each meal and snack. Subjects will order these meals from a prepared ad lib menu.  
 Procedures to occur in both SB UD and SB SF: Subjects will remain indoors during each admission. 
Technicians will hook subjects up to a PSG monitor each night. Partic ipants will be given a 
standardized eucaloric diet for the first [ADDRESS_427671] ing adipokine levels, other

9  metabolic and stress markers will be collected during each vi sit. Blood samples will be collected 
repeatedly up to every 30 minutes during each visit. Blood will be draw n without interrupting sleep 
using an approximately 72” long IV line from outside the room and a blood-sparing t echnique to 
minimize blood loss. If issues with the IV occur, then select samples, up to [ADDRESS_427672] will be performed, and morphometric measures will be gathered.   During 
the inpatient stay, subjects will complete various questionnaires and tasks (e.g. Food Preference 
Questions, the Dutch Eating Behavior Scale, the Positive and Negat ive Affect Scale, hot flash 
diaries, reward seeking behavior, PSQI, ISI, PHQ-8). After waking, su bjects may complete the post-
sleep questionnaire and the CCI IPM Exit Questionnaire, which are re gularly administered by [CONTACT_344451]. Subjects may also complete neurobehavioral test ing administered automatically 
by [CONTACT_344452]. Throughout the  inpatient portions of the study urine 
voids may be scheduled to be collected approximately every [ADDRESS_427673] is awake. 
Unscheduled urine voids during the day or overnight may also be collected. For each  void, the urine 
volume will be measured, and aliquots may be saved for later hormonal , metabolite, or electrolyte 
analysis of analytes that may be affected by [CONTACT_344453]/or changes in hormonal status. 
Urine samples will be collected and stored per standard techniques.  Skin conductance may be 
measured using the Biolog skin conductance monitor.  During the [ADDRESS_427674] at BWH in order to measure food intake. Subjects  will be instructed to standardize 
their sleep patterns during the 4 days at home, and up to a week be forehand, to extend the 
standardized routine.  
 Undisturbed procedures only: Bedtime and wake-up time will be fixed to an 8-hour standardized 
TST. 
 Fragmentation procedures only: During SB SF nights, subjects will be awakened using an auditory 
stimulus, adjusted to maintain the target number of awakenings and W ASO observed in our most 
symptomatic subjects with leuprolide-induced HF (36 awakenings, 62 mi nutes WASO). TIB will 
be extended to maintain the 8-hour TST. Subjects will not be permitt ed to get out of bed or eat in

assigned a study identification number regardless of eligibility status. E ligible and consented 
participants will be scheduled for either a 1-night or 3-night stay in the Ce nter for Clinical 
Investigation inpatient unit. 
C. Inpatient visit: Subjects will be admitted for a one-night or three-ni ght stay within the BWH 
Clinical and Translational Science Center/Center for Clinical I nvestigation (CCI) inpatient 
unit. Subjects will be admitted in the afternoon and discharged mid-morning. Duri ng the stay, 
we will conduct the following abbreviated protocol: 
• On the day of admission, a urine pregnancy test will be performed, and vitals  and 
morphometric measures will be gathered.  Subjects will remain on the  9B floor during the 
stay. Nursing staff will hook subjects up to a PSG monitor each night, and 24-hour skin 
conductance will be measured during the night using the Biolog skin conductanc e monitor. 
• Subject will be awakened during the night through auditory stimulus broadcast m anually 
by [CONTACT_344454] (WASO) (36 awakenings, 62 minutes WASO).  Time 
In Bed (TIB) will be extended to maintain the 8-hour Total Sleep Ti me (TST). Auditory 
tones will be between 2- and 30-seconds duration, beginning at 60 dB and increa sed to a 
maximum of 1100db if an EEG awakening is not elicited. Once awake, subje cts will be 
required to stay awake for up to 2 minutes. Subjects will not be permitted to get out of bed 
or eat in the middle of the night. 
• Subjects will be able to order meals and snacks off a provided menu. There w ill be no 
dietary restrictions. 
Nurses and technicians will be present [ADDRESS_427677]/ps ychiatrist evaluation and

Study Endpoints  
Metabolic endpoints are: 1) fasting morning levels of leptin (primary) adipokine s, ghrelin (total, 
acetylated) (secondary), and 2) the circadian leptin profile (exploratory), cal culated as area under 
curve (AUC) to detect whether the overall profile is lower, as seen in  sleep restriction studies, and 
morning fasting AD levels. Behavioral endpoints are: 1) satiety (primary) and hunger  (secondary) 
on a VAS scale, and 2) daily caloric intake during ad lib meals (exploratory). Analyses of each 
endpoint will be conducted in parallel as we seek to detect cohe rence among endpoints and focus 
on consistency across different outcomes in each hormonal and HF context. 
 
 
 
This study involves the administration of leuprolide to healthy individuals  in order to better 
understand experimentally induced hot flashes. Subjects are healthy i ndividuals who do not have 
any specific medical diagnosis. The DXA scan is not clinically i ndicated for women participating 
in the protocol.  Alternative imaging studies are therefore not indicated. 
For studies involving treatment or diagnosis, provide information about standar d of care at 
Partners (e.g., BWH, MGH) and indicate how the study procedures differ from stan dard care.

The PI’s current IND for use of leuprolide in healthy volunteers to study hot fl ashes (#[ZIP_CODE]) has 
been amended to include the current protocol. All study procedures will be a pproved by [CONTACT_344455]. All adverse event reports will be reviewe d by [CONTACT_978]. Serious and non-serious 
adverse events will also be reported to the Safety Monitoring Group (se e DSMG form), FDA (for 
IND #[ZIP_CODE]) and our IRB in accordance with the respective reporting guidel ines. Unanticipated 
problems involving risks to subjects or others including adverse events wi ll be reported to the PHRC 
in accordance with PHRC unanticipated problems reporting guidelines . In the case of a serious 
adverse event, study procedures will be discontinued and appropriate diagnosti c and therapeutic 
measures will be taken, as decided by [CONTACT_473]. 
 
Thorough screening procedures will be implemented to exclude women in whom st udy treatments 
and procedures are contraindicated. Subjects participating in the study protocol will be monitored 
closely for the development of any adverse events. Criteria for withdrawing par ticipants from the 
protocol in the event of an adverse event or serious health concern wil l be implemented. Women 
who develop a serious health concern or adverse event will be withdrawn from  the protocol and 
referred for appropriate treatment. Potential risks to study subject s will be further minimized by [CONTACT_344456]. 
 
All research records will be kept with maximum possible confidenti ality. Results, including 
biological specimens, will be coded and the key to the code will be  assigned by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_344427] a locked file. No names will be used in presentation of  any data. Source documents

FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
 
Potential risks associated with study medications:  
Leuprolide in healthy volunteers: Leuprolide is a widely used gonadotropin releasing hormone 
(GnRH) agonist that is manufactured by [CONTACT_69735]. Leuprolide is indicated fo r treatment of 
endometriosis, uterine fibroids, precocious puberty, and prostate cancer, and has bee n used off- 
label for in-vitro fertilization and premenstrual syndrome. In the current protocol, leuprolide will be 
administered at a dose routinely used for treatment of endometriosis and ut erine fibroids in 
premenopausal women. Leuprolide can induce amenorrhea for [ADDRESS_427681] (i.e., >6 months) is asso ciated with bone 
loss, bone effects are not expected in this protocol because only a single dose of GnRH agonist 
therapy will be administered. Other side effects are related to suppression of ovarian steroid 
secretion, including: 
Adverse reactions to short-term use:  
 Common: Hot flashes, headache, vaginal bleeding, vaginal dryness, va ginitis, alopecia, body 
and joint pain, emotional lability, depression symptoms, memory problems, naus ea, vomiting, 
peripheral edema 
 Rare (<3%): Myalgia, hirsutism, acne, weight gain or weight loss , depression, decreased libido,

Leuprolide is associated with emotional lability in 22–31% of women r eceiving leuprolide as part 
of large clinical trials for treatment of endometriosis and fibroids. These  studies do not provide 
information about whether the mood symptoms that emerged were persisten t or at a clinically 
significant level suggesting a depressive disorder. However, our expe rience, and that of other 
reproductive psychiatry investigators using close monitoring of mood in healthy v olunteers given 
leuprolide, indicates that clinically significant depression is rare (2–3%). Additional information 
from the manufacturers of leuprolide also indicates that serious depression devel ops only rarely on 
GnRH agonists. Potential risks associated with DXA scan: A dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry 
(DXA) scan will be performed to quantify total body fat mass. The total body DXA scan is non-
invasive and takes less than 10 minutes to complete with minimal/no di scomfort while lying down 
on a scan table under the supervision of the Bone Density staff. Participa nts will be exposed to a 
small amount of radiation from this scan. The amount of radiation exposure with DXA is eve n less 
than that of an abdominal CT scan. The exposure from the DXA scans is  equal to less than 1% of 
the dose permissible during occupational exposure. The risk from radiation exposure  of this level is 
too small to be measured directly and is considered to be negligibl e in comparison with other 
everyday risks. Pregnancy tests will be used to ensure that women unde rgoing the DXA scans are 
not pregnant. 
Patients will be screened for contraindications to DXA as part of the eligibility/exclusion 
requirements so that they do not participate in this protocol. Provide a brief description of any foreseeable risks and discomforts to subjects .  Include those 
related to drugs/devices/procedures being studied and/or administered/perfor med solely for 
research purposes.  In addition, include psychosocial risks, and risks related to privacy a nd 
confidentiality.  When applicable, describe risks to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_344432] g infant.

[ADDRESS_427682] an  abnormality that requires further 
evaluation. The participant and her physician (with the subject’s permi ssion) will be informed of 
the scan results so follow-up assessments and treatment can be undertaken if nec essary. 
 
Potential risks associated with Biolog Ambulatory Hot Flash Moni tor: The Biolog ambulatory 
hot flash monitor (UFI, Morro Bay, CA) will be used to measure hot flashes objectively. Th ere are 
no significant risks associated with skin-conductance methodologies. The input assem bly wiring is 
fixed so that the subject is inherently isolated, making the risk of curren t leakage negligible. Skin 
conductance is measured by [ADDRESS_427683] rodes cannot get wet; 
therefore subjects will be instructed to not bathe while wearing the monitor. 
 
Potential risks associated with inpatient sleep study procedu res: Subjects will be admitted to the 
BWH Clinical And Translational Science Center/Center for Clini cal Investigation (CCI) inpatient 
unit for [ADDRESS_427684]’s stay in the research facility, treatment will be provided. 
 
Polysomnography: PSG studies will be conducted according to standard clinical procedures , which 
have minimal risks. A minor rash may develop from the tape or adhesives used  to attach electrodes, 
but this is expected to resolve within a few days. In addition, the monitori ng equipment may make 
sleep somewhat more difficult than usual and the individual may the refore experience minimally 
reduced quality of sleep. 
 
Ambulatory Polysomnography: The ambulatory polysomnography equipment is commonly used 
in clinical sleep testing and has minimal risk. A minor rash may d evelop from tape or adhesives 
used to attach the electrodes, but is expected to resolve withi n a few days. In addition, the monitoring 
equipment may make sleep somewhat more difficult than usual and the indi vidual may therefore 
experience minimally reduced quality of sleep.  
 
Potential risks associated with venous blood sampling: The risks associated with venipuncture and 
intravenous lines are minimal and include hematoma, pain, infection, and  fainting spells. All blood 
draws and IV placements will be performed by [CONTACT_344460] s tandard sterile 
techniques. Infection is unlikely since stringent aseptic techniques are followed during all 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form  
Version Date: January 3, 2024 Filename: [INVESTIGATOR_273011]  
16  procedures. An approximately 72” long intravenous line will be placed for a 24-hour  period during 
each of the BWH Clinical And Translational Science Center/Ce nter for Clinical Investigation (CCI) 
inpatient unit so that venous blood samples can be obtained up to every hour using an IV lin e from 
outside the room without repeated venipuncture or sleep interruption re lated to the blood draw. 
Blood-sparing techniques will be used to minimize blood loss. If issues w ith the IV occur, then 
select samples, up to [ADDRESS_427685] ure. There may be some side 
effects from the use of heparin; such as bleeding and allergy. 
There may be some discomfort or bruising on initial insertion of the cathe ter into a vein, but wearing 
the catheter should not be painful. Occasionally, mild discomfort may occur from the tube in the 
vein. If this happens, it can be repositioned or removed, asking the subject’s permission before any  
subsequent reinsertion. Occasionally, there is a bruise at the sit e of the IV insertion, which may last 
a few weeks; and, rarely, a small scar may remain permanently at the venipuncture  site. There may 
be a minor skin rash or reaction to the sterile tape (contact [CONTACT_344461]) used to hold the catheter in 
position. 
A total of up to 447.5 cc of venous blood will be drawn throughout the study. Fede ral guidelines 
allow for up to 550 cc of venous blood per 2-month period in healthy non-pregnant adults wei ghing 
>110 pounds. There is a risk of becoming anemic from frequent blood sampling. 
 
Psychological risks: Answering questions on the research instruments and questionnaires used  to 
evaluate psychological symptoms can be upsetting to some women. Subjects will be told that they 
can skip specific questions that make them uncomfortable. Any woma n who develops severe 
depression during the study will be evaluated and referred for treatment, incl uding emergency 
evaluation if appropriate. 
 
Radiation exposure: Each set of DEXA scans result in an effective radiation dose of approximately 
0.5 mrem so that both sets results in an effective dose of approxima tely 1 mrem. The total effective 
dose is therefore approximately 1 mrem.   
 
Risks of MealLoggerTM: The research team will create credentials for patients using th is app, so 
that MealLogger will not be able to associate the data with a re al person. It is not necessary for the 
study staff to collect identifiable information through the app, so participants will be instructed that 
the only required information is their meals. MealLogger is easily insta lled on both Android and 
iPhone systems; the research team does not anticipate usabili ty issues given that MealLogger is used 
both in research studies and in the general populations, but participants wil l be instructed to contact 
[CONTACT_344462]. MealLogger has a lready been 
approved in other Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_344433] (e.g., 2012P-001631). 
 
Risks of Study Food: The study food provided by [CONTACT_344463] h 
participant’s preferences and restrictions. The Dietary staff are informed  of participants’ allergies, 
as well as preferences (e.g., vegetarian or vegan). There is a mi nor risk of gastrointestinal symptoms 
(e.g., stomach discomfort/ache, nausea, or abdominal bloating) as participants ’ diets at home may 
not include the same types of food consumed during the study diet.

she will be provided with a copy after completing study procedures. If an abnorma lity is detected 
during the study, this information will be shared with the participant and he r physician (with her 
permission). Our experience to date indicates that some women find the knowledge obtained 
through the experience of developi[INVESTIGATOR_344434] i nformative. Because there 
is no direct benefit of study procedures to these healthy volunteers, they wil l be compensated for 
their time, effort and willingness to undergo study procedures, including exposure to t ime-limited 
leuprolide therapy and time spent in the BWH Clinical And Translational Science Center/Center 
for Clinical Investigation (CCI) inpatient unit. However, financial c ompensation to subjects will not 
be presented as a benefit of participation in this research.

menopause-related hot flashes and estrogen withdrawal, on behavioral and m etabolic biomarkers of 
body fat gain, results of which will inform strategies to prevent gains in  body fat, thereby [CONTACT_344465] . 
 
EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS

importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result from the s tudy. Provide 
a brief, realistic summary of potential benefits to subjects, for example, “It is hoped t hat the 
treatment will result in a partial reduction in tumor size in at least 25% of t he enrolled subjects.” 
Indicate how the results of the study will benefit future patients wit h the disease/condition being 
studied and/or society, e.g., through increased knowledge of human physiology or behavior, 
improved safety, or technological advances. 
The risks and benefits of the research must be fairly distributed among the populations t hat stand 
to benefit from it.  No group of persons, for example, men, women, pregnant women, children, 
and minorities, should be categorically excluded from the research without a good scient ific or 
ethical reason to do so.  Please provide the basis for concluding that the  study population is

Subjects in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_344435] $50 for the screening visit and $250 for each night  
they stay in the unit (maximum compensation = $800). 
CONSENT PROCEDURES  
Subjects will not undergo any study procedures until it is clear that the y understand the risks and 
benefits and consent to participate. At the remote screening visit (V1a ), a research physician will 
review the consent form with prospective subjects. Women enrolling in the study m ust be capable 
of understanding the nature of the study as well as the discomforts and potentia l benefits. Any 
questions or areas of concern regarding the protocol or alternative treatment  options will be 
addressed by [CONTACT_67378]. If a woman feels comfortable with the study 
procedures, she will sign the consent form along with the physician investigator usin g the electronic 
REDCap e-consent template. The consent form will include information about the risks and benefits 
of study participation and contact [CONTACT_344468]. The study 
protocol, consent forms, telephone screens, and all other study procedures will be a pproved by [CONTACT_344469]. 
Enrolled subjects will be given a copy of the completed consent form before a ny study procedures 
are completed, and a copy of the signed consent form will also be placed in  the subject’s research 
file. If subjects have reservations about study participation at the first visit, they have the option to 
take the consent form home to review the decision to participate in the s tudy again with research 
physicians before signing the consent form and initiating study procedures. 
Additional considerations: Because of the nature of drug administration to healthy volunteers, the Explain in detail how, when, where, and by [CONTACT_17844], and the timing of consent

indications in premenopausal women (e.g., endometriosis, fibroids). It will be made clear that study 
participants will have no direct health benefit from the treatment be cause they have no medical 
reason to receive the treatment. Participants will be informed t hat the motivation to administer a 
GnRH agonist to healthy volunteers is to understand metabolic conseque nces of sleep fragmentation 
associated with hot flashes induced by [CONTACT_344470], as well as that of hot flashes and estradiol 
withdrawal. It will be explained that a research participant reta ins the right to withdraw from a study 
at any point, but that the effects of the GnRH agonist on gonadal hormones ca nnot be reversed if 
she chooses to withdraw after receiving leuprolide because leuprolide  is being administered in a 
depot form. Participants will also be informed that the study procedures are being conducted with 
the approval and monitoring of the IRB and FDA. They will also be told t hat if any abnormalities 
are detected as part of study procedures (e.g., on the DXA scan), resul ts of these tests will be relayed 
to the subject and her physician (with her permission) so that follow up asse ssments and treatment 
can be undertaken if necessary. 
 
DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING

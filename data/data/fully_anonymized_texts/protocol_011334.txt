1. BACKGROUND: 
Heart failure  
Although significant advancements in morbidity and mortality statistics have been 
established with medical treatment, HF remains a prevalent, morbid, and costly condition.1,[ADDRESS_935063] heart failure ( HF),1,3,4 50% are readmitted within 6 months 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689273].5,6 Thus, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689274] 30 days based on the Readmissions Reduction Program initiated by [CONTACT_629063] & Medicaid Servic es. Moreover, patients with HF continue to be 
symptomatic even after optimization of medical treatment. These symptoms are associated with 
frequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], as well as decreased health related quality of life ( HRQOL ).7,8 
Therefore, HF symptom reduction is still the  major target of treatment to reduce frequent re -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689275].7,8 
Vitamin C Supplementation   
 Mean serum vitamin C level was significantly lower in patients with HF compared to 
those with other non -HF chronic illness .9-11  Up to 39% of patients with HF had vitamin C 
deficiency .[ADDRESS_935064] of these trials tested effects of high dose vitamin C supplementation via intra-
venous or intra- arterial administration .  Only two trials with very small sample size (n=10)  tested 
oral, 1 month vitamin C supplementation and found vitamin C supplementation increased serum 
vitamin C level and also improved endothelial  function, although neither study controlled for 
confounders such as age, race, sex, BMI or social status .13,17 
Preliminary Study  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_377721] a preliminary study that serves as the foundation for this feasibility 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_87921].  This was an observational study in which we collected dietary vitamin C intake 
from a 4 -day food diary, symptom burden using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale—
Heart Failure, and HRQOL using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire at baseline, and prospectively followed cardiac hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689276] 4 years in 264 
patients with HF. In this study, 41% of HF patients had vitamin C deficiency. Patients with vitamin C deficiency had higher symptom burden (p =.05), worse HRQOL (p <.001) and were 
about twice as likely to have a cardiac event compared to patients with adequate vitamin C 
intake (p = .015). This study demonstrated the high prevalence and worse consequences of vitamin C deficiency in patients with HF.   
 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVE  
The p urpose of this study is to test a low -cost, simple vitamin C supplementation 
intervention, that is, comparing placebo to 500mg/day vitamin C and 1gram/day vitamin C daily 
to assess feasibility and acceptability of vitamin C supplementation and effects on serum 
vitamin C level, cardiac function, HF symptoms,  and HRQOL. Our specific aim [ADDRESS_935065] of a vitamin C supplementation intervention on the primary outcome (serum vitamin C 
level) from baseline to 3- month follow -up among 3 groups  (0.5 g, 1 g vitamin C, and placebo) . 
Vit C Study Protocol / 5  
Protocol 17 -1809 –  
Protocol version: 4  
Version date: [ADDRESS_935066] of a vitamin C supplementation intervention on the secondary 
outcomes ( HF symptom burden, health related quality of life (HRQOL), cardiac function, and 
oxidative stress ) from bas eline to [ADDRESS_935067] data to assess feasibility (recruitment, retention, attrition rates). 
 
3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN   
Design. This project  is a feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_689277] s of vitamin C supplementation, 
and to obtain initial estimates of effect size to support a future RCT. The proposed vitamin C 
supplementation intervention study is a three -group, single  blind, placebo controlled prospective 
design ( control  n=14, Vit C 500mg n=14, Vit C 1000mg n=14) .  The most commonly tested dose 
of vitamin C in current trials on vitamin C supplementation is 1 g/day .[ADDRESS_935068] of vitamin C supplementation is  serum vitamin C level. The secondary 
outcomes include HF symptom burden, HRQOL, cardiac function, and oxidative stress. The 
variables would be measured in person at baseline and at 3 months include: HF symptom 
burden, HRQOL, PROMIS fatigue, depression and sleep disturbance, serum vitamin C level, 
biomarker of cardiac function (i.e., cardiac output using impedance cardiograph) and oxidative 
stress ( 8-iso-PGF2a isoprostane, see below in detail) , as well as  demographic, clinical, and 
other variables that can affect study outcomes (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, body mass index , serum creatinine)  and medications. HF symptom burden and HRQOL will also be 
measured at Month [ADDRESS_935069] data to assess feasibility 
(recruitment, retention, attrition rates).  
Sample and Setting .  A total of 4 2 participants  (14 per group)  will be randomly assigned to 
either the control or the intervention group. Patients with HF will be recruited at the University of 
North Carolina Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_689278]/cardiology outpatient clinics.  
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria . Inclusion criteria  include pat ients (a) have a diagnosis of chronic 
HF. The diagnosis and etiology of chronic HF will be confirmed by a HF cardiologist using established criteria,
6,21,22 (b) have undergone evaluation of HF and optimization of medical 
therapy, (c) are not taking any vitamin C supplementation at all or are willing to stop taking their 
current vitamin C supplementation, (d) able to read and speak English, (e) have >1 month from 
any inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], (e) treating cardiology healthcare provider indicates the individual 
is a good candidate for this study that involves 3 months of vitamin C supplement of 500 
mg/day, 1g/day, or placebo, (f) Per treating healthcare provider's assessment, patient’s projected lifespan is greater than or equal to 6 months.   
Exclusion criteria  include: (a) stage D HF or [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) functional 
class IV, (b) history of renal stones or renal disease (serum creatinine >1.5), (c) history of glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) and (d) cognitive impairment that 
precludes giving informed consent or ability to follow protocol instructi ons, (e) originally taking 
vitamin C 500mg/day or more, (f)  women who are pregnant.  
Female patients with HF are considered past child- bearing potential: 1) if they are ≥60yrs of age 
or 2) if they are age [ADDRESS_935070] not menstruated for 12 mont hs (will confirm by 
[CONTACT_6270]-report) . For women < 50 years old (with child -bearing potential) , we will confirm by [CONTACT_6270] -
report that they are not pregnant  and confirm this by [CONTACT_12550] a urine pregnancy test  prior to 
enrollment and assess for likelihood of pregnancy on a monthly basis . 
 
4. INTERVENTION  
The intervention is designed to complement medical management. Therefore, all 
patients will continue to be medically managed by [CONTACT_689291]. 
Vit C Study Protocol / 6  
Protocol 17 -1809 –  
Protocol version: 4  
Version date: [ADDRESS_935071] a visit at baseline and Month 3 (with some flexibility to do the final visit  at 3 
months +/ - 1 month) coordinated with their regular clinic visits  that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_689279] 
[ADDRESS_935072] y of 
either Vitamin C 500mg or V itamin C tablets ( 1000mg) in a bottle and the control group will be 
provided placebo tablets in a bottle. All p articipants in the intervention  group will be instructed to 
take one vitamin C tablet  (500mg/ day or 1000mg/day)  with one meal daily  from baseline for 3 
months  and all control group participants will be instructed to take one placebo tablet with one 
meal daily from baseline to 3  months.  Participants will return their un -used investigational drugs 
on the day of their 3- month follow -up. We will count remaining pi[INVESTIGATOR_689280]’s 
treatment adherence with both the vitamin C supplementation (500mg or 1000mg) and control 
(placebo) groups. After counting the pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], the un -used pi[INVESTIGATOR_689281] (IDS) pharmacy to dispose. We will draw blood to measure serum 
vitamin C level to determine drug accountability.  
Role of the Investigational Drug Services (IDS) . The IDS will provide oversight for the 
storage, dispensing, labeling, distribution and disposal  of all investigational medications (vitamin 
C tablets and placebo) for the study .  
5. PROCEDURES  AND RECRUITMENT STRATEGY  
 Permission for this study will be obtained from the University of North Carolina at Chapel 
Hill Institutional Review Board. A dedicated and trained researc h assistant will recruit HF  
patients from the UNCH clinics. A list of HF patients who will come to the UNCH clinics will be 
generated and obtained from the staff in charge for the scheduling information in the clinics one 
week before patients’ visits. On the day that the potential participants come to the clinic, the 
research assistant will screen the potential participant’s eligibility based on inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. The research assistant also will consult with the potential participant’s treating 
healthcare provider to make sure the potential participant is appropriate for the study and 
patient’s projected lifespan is greater than or equal to 6 months. Once the  research assistant 
confirms the potential participants are eligible and gets approval from the provider, t he research 
assistant will approach and briefly explain the study to recruit potential participants while they 
wait to see their physicians. If poten tial participants are interested in participation, the research 
assistant will then confirm eligibility. For eligible patients, study requirements will be explained in detail. If the patient agrees to participate, a signed informed consent will be obtained based on 
consent process  (see below) and we will administer the survey, measure cardiac im pedance 
and obtain the blood samples.  All eligible patients will be randomized  to either the control group 
or to the intervention group using the Medsharing application for clinical trials .  
 
Baseline visit . Data on socio- demographics, clinical characteristics medications, symptom 
burden, PROMIS depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance, HRQOL, will be collected at the 
beginning of the visit and blood will be drawn to measure serum vitamin C level and oxidat ive 
stress ( 8-iso-PGF2a isoprostane). All participants will be asked to return their respective 
supplementation bottles to the research assistant at Month 3. We will count pi[INVESTIGATOR_689282] C supplementat ion. 
Follow up phone call (Month 1 and 2) . Follow up phone calls will occur within 1 week after 
enrollment to follow -up whether they are taking the investigational pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (vitamin C or placebo) 
daily and whether they have any adverse events from taking the investigational pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], as well as 
at Month [ADDRESS_935073] data on 
HF symptom burden and HRQOL (for both groups).   
Vit C Study Protocol / 7  
Protocol 17 -1809 –

Version date: 0 4-21- 2020 
Month 3 visit . Data on socio -demographics, clinical characteristics medications, symptom 
burden, PROMIS depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance, HRQOL, will be collected at the 
beginning of the visit and blood will be drawn to measure serum vitamin C level and oxidative 
stress ( 8-iso-PGF2a isoprostane). All participants will be asked to return their vitamin C (or 
placebo) bottle to the research assistant at Month 3. We will count pi[INVESTIGATOR_689283] C supplementation.   
 6. CONSENT PROCESS  
The consent process includes: 1. Obtain written informed consent from the study subject; 2. 
Ensure that the most recent version of the IRB -approved consent/HIPAA authorization form is 
used; 3. Review the informed consent/HIPAA authorization form with the subject in a location that allows privacy; 4. Allow the subject time to read the document and ask questions. Encourage input from family members, if appropriate; 5. Ensure that the subject signs and dates 
the document in the required sections of the consent  and HIPAA authorization form; 6. Ensure 
the consenter signs and dates (same date) the document in the required section of the consent form; 7. Provide a singed copy of the informed consent/HIPAA form document to the subject; 
and 8. Document and date consent procedure and file the signed document and checklist back 
to locked cabinet.  
The data (from self -report, impedance cardiograph, and blood drawn) will be collected at 
baseline clinic appointment  and Month 3 in person for all patients. HF symptom burden  and 
HRQOL will be collected at baseline and Month 3, in person and also M onth 1 and 2, by [CONTACT_648]. 
All patients will be compensated up to $50 for participating in this study: $25 at baseline visit 
and $[ADDRESS_935074] in- person data at Month 3 
(such as Covid -19 pandemic stay-at-home order  that prevent s our in -person data collection), we 
will not collect data from impedance cardiograph or blood drawn . We will only collect self -report 
data using one of the following 2 ways based on subjects’ preference: 1) by [CONTACT_648]; 2) by [CONTACT_2319] --
we will send subjects the questionnaires ahead of time and ask them to complete and send the 
questionnaire back to us . We also will ask  them to send their un -used vitamin C pi[INVESTIGATOR_689284] .  
 
7. MEASUREMENTS AND STUDY EVALUATIONS  
Serum vitamin C level . We will measure participant’s serum vitamin C level at baseline and 
Month [ADDRESS_935075] of vitamin C supplementation. Sample vitamin C will be measured in serum using MyBioScouce ELISA kits.  
Symptom burden . Physical symptom burden will measured using items from the Memorial 
Symptom Assessment Scale—Heart Failure (MSAS- HF).8,23  The MSAS -HF is an 8 -item 
questionnaire adapted from Portenoy’s  Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale that is designed 
to provide multidimensional information about HF symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_689292]. Patients will be first asked if the symptom was present during the previous 7 days. If present, 
three characteristics of each symptom will be rated: frequency of symptom, severity of 
symptom, and degree of symptom distress. Frequency is rated on a scale from 1 to 4 (rarely to 
almost constantly), severity rated on a scale from 1 to 4 (mild to very severe) and distress  rated 
on a scale from 0 to 4 (not at all to very severe). Burden score for each symptom can range from 0 (no burden) to 12 (greatest symptom frequency, severity, and distress).  The scale has 
good reliability, ranges of 0.73 -0.92 in patients with HF.
8,23 
Health- related quality of life (HRQOL) . The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure 
questionnaire (MLHFQ) is a measure of HRQOL that assesses the patient’s perceptions of the 
Vit C Study Protocol / 8  
Protocol 17 -1809 –  
Protocol version: 4  
Version date: [ADDRESS_935076] demonstrated evidence for validity and 
reliability (Cronbach’s alphas ranging from .88 to .93).24-26  The MLHFQ was used in our study 
that demonstrated a significant relationship between vitamin C deficiency and HRQOL, as well as between HRQOL and re- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653165].
26 
Cardiac function. Impedance Cardiography is a measurement method that is primarily 
used to determine aspects of Cardiac Output (CO) that we will use the MindWare Mobile 
impedance cardiograph (model number 50- 2303 -00) in this study. CO is the total amount of 
blood, pumped from both the left and right ventricles of the heart for each of its successive systolic phases, over the course of one minute. Left ventricular cardiac output is the CO from 
the left ventricle only and can be estimated via a non- invasive technique called Impedance 
Cardiography (ICG), which provides an approximation of Stroke Volume (SV) 
(CO=SV*HR).  We will measure patient’s cardiac output and heart rate variability to reflect the 
participant’s cardiac  function using impedance cardiograph that is non- invasive, reproducible, 
valid and widely used in patients with cardiovascular disease.
27 The MindWare Mobile  
impedance cardiograph is a commercially available impedance cardiograph that has been 
widely used in research studies.28 The MindWare Mobile impedance cardiograph is a small, 
portable device  with a high precision frequency constant current of 400 micro amps which 
allows measurement of the impedance changes  across the thorax to monitor cardiac function.28  
Oxidative stress biomarker . We will measure 8- iso-PGF2a isoprostane  as a biomarker of 
oxidative stress. Elevated level of 8- iso-PGF2a isoprostane will serve as a biomarker of 
increased lipid peroxidation due to oxygen free radical production exceeding antioxidant 
capacity and will be measured in our Biobehavioral Lab. The level of the biomarker is expected to decrease in response to the vitamin C supplementation. Venous  blood will be drawn into 
vacutainers containing trisodium citrate, EDTA and/or BHT depending on the analysis, centrifuged in a refrigerated centrifuge and serum  separated and allotted to micro -tubes and 
kept at  -[ADDRESS_935077] pa rticipants’ demographic and clinical data to assess sample 
characteristics, characterize the sample, and obtain data on potential confounding variables .  
8. SAFETY EVALU ATIONS  
All participants will receive a phone call within 1 week after enrollment, and also at Month 1 
and Month 2 to follow -up whether they are taking the investigational pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (vitamin C or placebo) 
daily and whether they have any adverse events from taking the investigational pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]  (see 
checklist in Appendix) . If any adverse events were found/reported, we will follow them per 
recommendations of the medical monitor until the event resolves . Sarah Waters , a nurse 
practitioner  with specialty in heart failure management at UNC Meadowmont Cardiology clinic 
will serve as a medical monitor on this study. Any adverse event will be reported to Sarah 
Waters in 72 hours or less . Sarah Waters will determine the severity of the adverse events and 
advise whether the participant needs to stop taking the investigational pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], withdraw from the 
study, or any medical treatment is needed. We will follow Sarah Waters’ advice immediately.  
When subjects  have AE (define as new signs and symptoms after taking investigational 
drugs, such as digestive distress --diarrhea, nausea,  abdominal bloating and any other 
unanticipated adverse events that could possibly be related to the intervention) . We will report t o 
Vit C Study Protocol / 9  
Protocol 17 -1809 –  
Protocol version: 4  
Version date: 0 4-21- 2020 
Sarah Waters  to determine the severity of the AEs (see below) . When mild AE is determined, 
subjects will continue to take their investigational drugs without further treatment and the RA will  
keep following up subject’s AE until AE  resolves . When m oderat e AE is determined, we will ask 
subjects to stop taking their investigational drug, advise them to seek medical treatment,  and 
continue to follow up until the AE resolves . If severity of any AE is more than moderate, we will 
ask subjects to seek for emergent medical treatment.  
• Mild Adverse Event – Event results in mild or transient discomfort, not requiring 
intervention or treatment; does not limit or interfere with daily activities (e.g. , insomnia, 
mild headache).  
• Moderate Adverse Event – Event is sufficiently discomforting so as to limit or interfere 
with daily activities; may require interventional treatment (e.g., fever requiring antipyretic 
medication).  
• Severe and undesirable Adverse Event – Event results in significant symptoms that 
prevents normal daily activities; may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84006] (e.g., 
anemia resulting in blood transfusion).  
The adverse event information will be reviewed in our monthly team meeting to monitor subject 
safety.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_689285]’s input.  
The research assistant is responsible to report any AE related to the study to Sarah Waters and 
the PI. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_689286] a 
determination of relatedness  if the event is related to the study, as it occurs and for notifying the 
Associate Dean for Research of the UNC School of Nursing and UNC IRB of the occurrence of any adverse event.  A scale on relatedness ranging from “Not related to” to “Definitely related to” 
(Not relat ed to, probably not related to, possibly related to, definitely related to) will be used to 
evaluate relatedness. Any “definitely related” and “possibly related” events will be reported to 
the UNC IRB. 
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_689287] (1) unexpected, (2) related or 
possibly related to participation in the research, and (3) serious or suggest that there are new or increased risk(s) to subjects.  
 Patient Safety and Confidentiality. All private health information (PHI) will be kept strictly 
confidential and subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  All 
study data in transit will be stored on an encrypted lap top computer stored and locked within the office of the study PI.  All transit study data will be  back up to the secure SON server that is 
password protected and maintained by [CONTACT_689293] 72 hours after data are col lected . The secure SON server 
can only be accessed by [CONTACT_689294]. Any new signs or symptoms reported by [CONTACT_689295]’s health care team.  At the baseline visit, patients will be assessed for any vitamin supplementation, serum 
creatinine and history of kidney stones.  If subjects  are currently taking a vit C supplement, we 
will advise them to stop taking any vitamin C supplement while they are on the study.  We also 
will caref ully review with the subjects if they are taking any multivitamin that contains vitamin C 
and advise them to stop taking any multivitamin that contains vitamin C. Although vitamin C is a 
water -soluble vitamin, we have implemented these steps to insure safety before randomization.

9. DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS   
Each participant will be assigned an anonymous ID. Data will be  collected using touchscreen 
laptop computer, and the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) system,29,30 a secure 
web-based application that is designed to support data capture for research studies.30  
All data analyses will be performed using SPSS 24.0. All estimates will be obtained along with 
95% confidence intervals.  
Descriptive statistics : All data with approximately symmetric distributions will be described by 
[CONTACT_191333], as well as number/ frequency and percentage (for Aim 3)  and 
variables with skew will be described by [CONTACT_689296].  Categorical  
variables  will be shown as total number and proportion and will include: race, sex, NYHA 
functional class , and comorbidity.  Associations between categorical variables will be tested by 
[CONTACT_689297] ( X²) or McNemar’s test.  Continuous variables will include symp tom burden, 
PROMIS depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance, HRQOL, cardiac function, serum vitamin c levels and biomarker for oxidative stress. Associations  between categorical and continuous 
variables will be tested by t- test and analysis of variance (ANOVA).  Associations between 
continuous variables will be tested using Pearson’s correlation coefficient ( r) will be used to 
establish if the correlation coefficient is statistically different.   
Efficacy analysis  for the specific aims is described below:  
The primary endpoint  is serum vitamin C level. F or Aim [ADDRESS_935078] of a vitamin C 
supplementation intervention on the primary outcome (serum vitamin C level) from baseline to 
3-month follow -up among [ADDRESS_935079] of a  vitamin C supplementation intervention on the 
secondary endpoint of HRQOL  (cardiac function, and oxidative stress) compared to the control 
group, we will use repeated measure of ANOVA to detect differences in HRQOL (cardiac 
function, and oxidative stress) from basel ine to [ADDRESS_935080] of a vitamin C 
supplementation intervention on the frequencies of  advance events  compared to the control 
group, we will use ANOVA to compare frequencies of adverse events during the 3- month period 
among 3 groups.  
Sample Size and Power : The total sample size of 42 participants will be selected as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_689288] y.  With 42 patients (14 in each group) and an alpha level of .05, the power of the 
ANOVA F test to detect a significant group difference will be 80% if the effect size is 0.5.

Interim/safety Analysis . We plan to conduct the interim /safety  analysis when we have 50% of 
the intervention sample, and the findings (as well as adverse events) will be reported to the 
medical monitor. The medical monitor will make decisions about the safety of continuing (or 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) the protocol, providing recommendations for recruitment, retention, safety, and other 
issues as appropriate.

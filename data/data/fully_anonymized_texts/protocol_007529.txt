  Study Termination  9.7
The study may be stopped at any time by [CONTACT_093], the sponsor, and/or Ora with 
appropriate notification. 
 Study Duration 9.[ADDRESS_293262]’s participation will involve 6 visits over approximately a 14-week (~98 days) period (84 days of treatment and 14 days pre-screening). 
 Monitoring and Quality Assurance  9.9
During the course of the study an Ora monitor, or designee, will make routine site visits to review protocol compliance, assess IP accountability, and ensure the study is being 
conducted according to the pertinent regulatory requirements. The review of the subjects’ medical records will be performed in a manner that adequately maintains subject 
confidentiality. Further details of the study monitoring will be outlined in a monitoring 
plan. 
Regulatory authorities of domestic and foreign agencies, quality assurance and or its 
designees may carry out on-site inspections and/or audits which may include source data 
checks. Therefore direct access to the original source data will be required for inspections and/or audits. All inspections and audits will be carried out giving consideration to data 
protection as well as subject confidentiality to the extent that local, state, and federal laws 
apply. 
[ADDRESS_293263] medical occurrence associated with the use of an IP in humans, whether or not considered IP-related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an IP, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise 
from any use of the IP (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug or medical device) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an 
overdose. An AE can arise from any delivery, implantation, or use of a medical device, 
including medical device failure, subject characteristics that may impact medical device performance (e.g., anatomical limitations), and therapeutic parameters (e.g., energy 
applied, sizing, dose release, and anatomic fit) associated with medical device use. 
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question 
from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate 
pages of the CRF. Any clinically relevant deterioration in clinical finding is considered

Clinical Trial Protocol: ADX- 102-DED- [ADDRESS_293264] be recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. 
Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, and relationship to IP, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or symptom observed by [CONTACT_72078]. 
Exacerbation of conditions related to the signs and symptoms of Dry Eye will not be 
reported as an AE.  
10.1.1 Severity 
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE as determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The assessment of severity is made irrespective of relationship to IP or seriousness of the 
event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
  
 
  
 
  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_293265] use information about the conditions/concurrent medication, and chronology of the event relative to drug 
administration.  The following definitions will be used:  
§ Definitely Related 
§ Probably Related 
§ Possibly Related 
§ Unlikely to be related 
§ Not Related 
10.1.3 Expectedness 
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information 
about the IP using these explanations: 
§ Unexpected: An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
§ Expected:  An AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
observed. 
§ Not applicable: An AE unrelated to the IP.

Clinical Trial Protocol: ADX- 102-DED- 009 12Dec2017 Version 1.0 Final  
 
Confidential   Page 37 
 AE events that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of products or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological/mechanical (or other) properties of the product, but 
are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product under 
investigation are to be considered unexpected. 
The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final 
classification is subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination. 
 Serious Adverse Events 10.2
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results 
in any of the following outcomes: 
§ Death; 
§ A life-threatening AE; 
Note: An AE is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
§ Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
Note: The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission (even if less than 24 hours). For chronic or long-term inpatients, inpatient admission includes transfer 
within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241525]: emergency room visits; outpatient/same-day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or 
clinical research/phase 1 units. 
Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any extension of an 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241526]. 
§ A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
Note: A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would be interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic nerve). 
§ A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
 Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events  10.[ADDRESS_293266] be reported to Ora, the sponsor, and the IRB/IEC as required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health

 notified before unmasking study drug. Ora and/or the study sponsor must be informed 
immediately about any unmasking event. 
If an investigator identifies a medical need for unmasking the treatment assignment of a 
subject, he/she should contact [CONTACT_241531]/or the medical monitor prior to unmasking the 
identity of the IP, if possible. Ora will ask the site to complete and send them the 
Unmasking Request Form. Ora will notify Aldeyra and jointly will determine if the 
unmasking request should be granted. They may consult the medical monitor as needed. 
The result of the request will be documented on the Unmasking Request Form. If 
approval is granted to unmask a subject, written permission via the Unmasking Request 
Form will be provided to the investigator. The investigator will unmask the subject using 
IWRS. The investigator will complete the Unmasking Memo form and include it in the 
subject’s study file and provide a copy for the TMF. For each unmasked request, the 
reason, date, signature, and name [CONTACT_72088], must be noted 
in the subject’s study file.  
Unmasked subjects will be discontinued from the study. 
 Type and Duration of the Follow- up of Subjec ts after Adverse 10.[ADDRESS_293267]’s source document. Non-serious 
AEs identified on the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_241532].  
If the investigator becomes aware of any new information regarding an existing SAE 
(i.e., resolution, change in condition, or new treatment), a new SAE/Unanticipated Report 
Form must be completed and faxed to Ora within 24 hours of the site’s awareness of the 
new information. The original SAE form is not to be altered. The report should describe 
whether the event has resolved or continues and how the event was treated. 
11 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES AND METHODS OF ANALYSES  
 Analysis Populations  11.1
The following analysis populations will be considered: 
• Intent-to-Treat Population – The intent-to-treat (ITT) population includes all 
randomized subjects. Subjects in the ITT population will be analyzed as randomized.

 12 COMPLIANCE WITH GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICES, 
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
ISSUES  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, current Good Clinical 
Practices (GCPs), including the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
Guidelines, and in general, consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, all applicable local, state, and federal requirements relevant to the use of IP in the countries 
involved will be adhered to. 
 Protection of Human Subjects  12.[ADDRESS_293268] Informed Consent 
Informed consent/assent must take place before any study specific procedures are 
initiated. Signed and dated written informed consent must be obtained from each subject and/or from the subject’s parent or legal guardian prior to enrollment into the study. If the 
subject is under the legal age of consent, the consent form must be signed by a legal 
guardian or as required by [CONTACT_52925]/or local laws and regulations. 
All informed consent forms must be approved for use by [CONTACT_116904]/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_62983]. If the consent form requires 
revision (e.g., due to a protocol amendment or significant new safety information), it is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the amended informed consent is reviewed 
and approved by [CONTACT_241533], signed 
and dated by [CONTACT_72085]. 
If informed consent is taken under special circumstances (oral informed consent), then 
the procedures to be followed must be determined by [CONTACT_241531]/or sponsor and provided in writing by [CONTACT_241531]/or sponsor prior to the consent process. 
12.1.[ADDRESS_293269] (IRB) Approval 
This study is to be conducted in accordance with IRB regulations (U.S. 21 CFR Part 
56.103). The investigator must obtain appropriate IRB approval before initiating the 
study and re-approval at least annually. 
Only an IRB approved version of the informed consent form will be used. 
 Ethical Conduct of the Study  12.[ADDRESS_293270] data collected and processed for the purposes of this study should be maintained by [CONTACT_63413]/her staff with adequate precautions as to

laws and regulations. 
Monitors, auditors and other authorized representatives of Ora, the sponsor, the IRB/IEC 
approving this study, the FDA, the DHHS, other domestic government agencies, and other foreign regulatory agencies will be granted direct access to the subject’s original 
medical and study records for verification of the data and/or clinical trial procedures. 
Access to this information will be permitted to the aforementioned individuals to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_2371]. 
A report of the results of this study may be published or sent to the appropriate health 
authorities in any country in which the IP may ultimately be marketed, but the subject’s identity will not be disclosed in these documents. 
 Documentation 12.[ADDRESS_293271]’s medical records, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], clinic charts, the investigator’s study subject files, as well as the results of diagnostic tests such as X-
rays, laboratory tests, and EKGs. The investigator’s copy of the CRFs serves as the 
investigator’s record of a subject’s study-related data. 
12.4.[ADDRESS_293272] approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until 
there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or until at 
least two years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. These documents will be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_21765]. It is the responsibility of 
the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_72058], custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the responsibility. The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_80703].

The IP is to only be prescribed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her named sub-
investigator(s), and is to only be used in accordance with this protocol. The IP must only be distributed to subjects properly qualified under this protocol to receive IP. 
The investigator must keep an accurate accounting of the IP received from the supplier. 
This includes the amount of IP dispensed to subjects, amount of IP returned to the investigator by [CONTACT_748], and the amount returned or disposed upon the completion of 
the study. A detailed inventory must be completed for the IP. 
12.5.[ADDRESS_293275] 
All IP will be returned to the sponsor or their designee or destroyed at the study site. The 
return or disposal of IP will be specified in writing. 
 Recording of Data on Source Documents and Case Reports Forms 12.6
(CRFs)  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that study data is completely and accurately 
recorded on each subject’s CRF, source document, and all study-related material. All study data should also be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, and original. Recorded 
datum should only be corrected in a manner that does not obliterate, destroy, or render 
illegible the previous entry (e.g., by [CONTACT_740] a single line through the incorrect entry and writing the revision next to the corrected data). An individual who has corrected a data 
entry should make clear who made the correction and when, by [CONTACT_241534]/her initials as well as the date of the correction. 
Data entry of all enrolled and randomized subjects will use software that conforms to [ADDRESS_293276] discs (CDs) containing copi[INVESTIGATOR_241527]’ eCRFs will be provided 
to each Investigator Site to be maintained on file by [CONTACT_737].

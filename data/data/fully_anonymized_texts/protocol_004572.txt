1. STUDY SYNOPSIS  
Study Name  A Randomized, Masked (Evaluator), Controlled, Prospective Study 
evaluating the Effectiveness and Safety of the Tixel® Medical Device, 
Versus Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_69177]® in the Treatment of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction  
Study Device  Tixel C  
Stage of 
Development  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_848613] 2 stages : stage 1 is the main pi[INVESTIGATOR_411137], and stage 2 
is an extension study for a sub -group population which  completed the main 
protocol , was treated with the Tixel device and meet s specific criteria of 
clinical benefit (specified in the description of stage 2  below ).   
Stage 1 - the mai n protocol  
Design  • Randomized, open -label study comparing the Tixel device to 
Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_275285].  
• Up to 110 patients (220 eyes) to be randomized in up to 6 clinical sites 
in the [LOCATION_002].  
• Evaluators will be masked as to the randomization assignments.  
• Both eyes will receive the same randomized assignment and both eyes 
of each patient will be evaluated at all time points.  
• Data from both eyes will be using in the statistical analysis.  
 The random -effects model adjusts the standard error (SE) and the confidence 
interval (CI) for within -person correlation between eyes.  
Objective  Evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Tixel C device in adults with 
Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD).  
Primary 
Effectiveness 
Endpoint  Change from baseline to the 4 -weeks follow -up exam in Tear Break Up Time 
(TBUT).  
Secondary 
Effectiveness 
Endpoints  • Change from baseline in patient symptoms using Ocular Surface Disease 
Index (OSDI) at 4 -weeks and 12 -weeks follow -up exam.  
Clinical Protocol Number: CLN 0858 Rev. 007 18-Jan-2023 
Page 3 of 19 
 
• Change from baseline to 4 -weeks and 12 -weeks follow -up exam in 
Meibomian Gland Score (MGS).  
• Change from baseline to 12 -weeks follow -up exam in Tear Break Up Time 
(TBUT).  
Key Safety 
Endpoint  Comparison of the incidence of Ocular Adverse Events for the two treatment 
arms.  
Secondary Safety 
Endpoints  • The evaluation of discomfort and pain during treatment.  
• Changes from baseline following treatment for the test and control devices 
for the following assessments:  
 Ocular Surface Staining.  
 Intraocular Pressure.  
 Best corrected distance Visual acuity.  
Population  Adult patients with symptoms of evaporative dry eye/MGD who do not 
respond adequately to conservative treatment options such as ocular 
lubricants.  
Sample size  Up to 110 patients (220 eyes), [ADDRESS_1179991] treatment .  
Sample size rationale:  
The sample size calculation is based on the primary effectiveness endpoint. 
Specifically, the sample size calculation was based on the non -inferiority with 
a 2.5 seconds’ margin of the change from baseline in TBUT score as assessed 
by a masked rater at [ADDRESS_1179992] case scenario that the TBUT of both eyes 
of subjects are completely  correlated (r=1).   
Sample size justification:  
When the sample size in each group is [ADDRESS_1179993] 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that 
the test and standard are not non -inferior (the difference in means, μ T-μL, is 
2.5 s or farther from zero in the same direction) in favor of the alternative 
Clinical Protocol Number: CLN [ADDRESS_1179994] deviation is 
4.5 s. 
Assuming a 20% drop -out rate (a relatively high rate is currently assumed due 
to Covid -19 uncertainty), 55 patients will be enrolled in each group ensuring 
a sample size of 44 patients per group.

Clinical Protocol Number: CLN [ADDRESS_1180003] of the Tixel device 
on the relief of the signs and symptoms of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) compared to 
the FDA -cleared  and CE approved device, Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_69177]. The design of this study is a non -
inferiority design which is the appropriate design considering the similarity of the mechanisms 
of the devices and the fact that treatments with Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_848620]. The purpose is to demonstrate that treatment with Tixel is 
also safe and effective for treating MGD.   
The funding for the study is done by [CONTACT_456], Novoxel LTD. Details regarding the fund ing 
and the budget are specified in the clinical trial agreement with each site.  
2.1.Background  
Dry Eye Disease (DED)  is often  caused by a chronic lack of sufficient lubrication and moisture 
on the surface of the eye. Consequences of dry eyes range from subtle to constant eye irritation , 
significant inflammation and even scarring of the front surface of the eye.  
Meibomian glands are located in the tarsal  plate of the upper and lower eyelids, where they 
terminate along the interior rim (or margin) of the eyelids.  These glands secrete meibum, which 
is a lipid -rich essential component of a healthy tear film. When sufficient meibum is not present 
in the tear film, the aqueous layer of the tear film is disrupted and readily evaporates causing 
irritation, redness, and i nflammation of the lid margin and surrounding tissues. Meibomian 
Gland Dysfunction (MGD) is associated with a failure of these glands to produce adequate 
quantities of meibum due to atrophy, inflammation, or obstruction and is thought to be the most 
common cause of evaporative Dry Eye Disease  [1; Schaumberg DK 2011 ]. 
Initial treatments for the signs and symptoms related to MGD and DED are the use of oil -based 
artificial tears to supplement the lack of lipid in the tear layer and oral Omega and anti -
inflammatory prescriptions to decrease inflammation in the soft tissue in the eyelids. Another 
common treatment is the use of warm compresses applied over the eyelid for extended periods 
of time, followed by [CONTACT_848629]. The results of these tre atments are often limited and temporary if not 
continued  on a regular basis . 
 
 
 
Clinical Protocol Number: CLN [ADDRESS_1180004] underlying abnormalities of the ocular surface and tear film. The different 
treatment methods including medicinal (i.e., Lifitegrast), and medical devices such as: IPL, 
vector thermal pulsation (Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_848621] i -Lux) and others1 ; Combination therapy, consisting of 
dry eye treatment (artificial tears, hyaluronic acid eye drops, Diquafosol ophthalmic solution) 
and lipid treatment, is effective in the improvement of both subjective and clinical symptoms. 
In case of microbial infect ion, MGD (Propi[INVESTIGATOR_76494] [P. acnes] and Staphylococcus), 
antibiotic eye drops are used. Another common treatment is the use of a steroid antimicrobial 
ophthalmic solution. Treatment with Medical devices utilizing applied heat, such as hot 
compress es and mechanical pressure to achieve effects, such as:  
• Triggering the onset of meibum liquefaction, thus assisting in secretion through the gland 
orifices . 
• Melting of the oil blocking Meibomian glands . 
 Such devices include Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_69177] ([COMPANY_012], New Brunswick, NJ), MeiboPatch (VISU  
pharma, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Intense pulsed light (IPL) devices, etc. All of them treat 
DED and MGD. Several technologies have been studied by [CONTACT_848630] -based dermal devices to alleviate DED. A mong them are IPL 
devices2 . According to Wang et al3, the complex multifactorial mechanisms of action of IPL 
therapy for MGD treatment is not fully understood. Both researchers have presented several 
possible IPL characteristics that may assist. It was proposed that delivery of thermal energy 
may assist in liquefaction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_848622]. Alternatively, antimicrobial effects of IPL therapy may dampen 
inflammatory triggers on the ocular surface. It was also suggested that the heat affects Demodex 
which  influences DED.

2.3.Study Rational e  
Thermal pulsation has been used in clinical settings to provide  heat and mechanical pressure to 
the eyelids to unblock plugged meibomian glands and reduce symptoms of MGD . Currently 
there are three FDA -cleared thermal pulsation devic es; Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_848623] 
(K093937 ), iLux by [CONTACT_848631], Inc. (K172645) , and TearCare by [CONTACT_269022] 
(K213045) . These  system s apply heat  (approximately between 40° to 45°C) on the eyelids 
(Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_848624]) and appl y gentle pressure on the lid surfaces. Warming the 
eyelid tissue softens and/or melts the meibum, which is known to facilitate gland expression 
using pressure.   
The Tixel provides another thermal -based solution which has shorter exposure time, with lower 
thermal energy transfer, lower pressure,  and no radiation emission whatsoever. Due to these 
suggested advantages Novoxel would like to further explore the performance of the device.  
Another research motivation has been discovered during research of treatment of periorbital 
wrinkles: The Tixel device has been used on the skin area around the eyes to reduce periorbital 
wrinkles . It has been reported by [CONTACT_26856] a [ADDRESS_1180005] strip which defines the difference between dry and 
normal tear stability as 5 seconds. Thus, a change of 2.5 seconds was defined  as a clinically 
relevant change since it represents 50% of that defined in the DET strip labeling.

3. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
3.1.General  Considerations   
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize continuous variables (number of eyes /patient s 
[N], mean, standard deviation (SD) or standard error of the mean, median, maximum, and 
minimum) and categorical variables (frequency and percentage) at each assessment timepoint. 
Statistical comparisons within each group will be perfo rmed using appropriate statistical 
methods or models, and the results such as 95% confidence intervals and p values will be 
reported. All summary tables will be supported with individual patient  and eye data listings. 
Baseline is defined as the last non -missing observation pri or to initiation of study intervention. 
Analyses will be carried out using SAS software or equivalent statistical software.  
Further details will be described  in the statistical anal ysis plan , which will be  finalized prior to 
the study database lock.  
3.2.Analysis Populations  
• Intent -to-Treat Population: The intent -to-treat (ITT) population includes all randomized 
patient s. Patient s will be analyzed  as randomized.  
• Per Protocol Population: The per protocol (PP) population includes all patient s who 
performed the  [ADDRESS_1180006] no major protocol deviations. Patient s will be analyzed  as treated.  The primary 
analysis population will be the per -protocol (PP)  population.  
• Safety Population: The safety population will include all treated patient s. The safety 
population will be analyzed  for all safety assessments. Patient s will be analyzed  as 
treated.  A summary table of number (%) of patients in each analysis population/set will 
be provided.  
3.3.Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive statistics or frequency tabulation will be provided for demographic and baseline 
characteristics, such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity.  
3.4.Effectiveness Analyses  
3.4.1.  Primary effectiveness endpoint  
- The primary endpoint of change from baseline in the TBUT as rated by a masked rate r 
at 4 weeks will be analyzed  for non -inferiority using a margin of 2.5 seconds .  
The primary non -inferiority hypothesis set will be:  
Clinical Protocol Number: CLN 0858 Rev. 007 18-Jan-2023 
Page 17 of 19 
 
Ho: µTixel - µLipi[CONTACT_1603]  + δ ≤ 0 
HA: µTixel - µLipi[CONTACT_1603]  + δ > 0 
where µTixel and µLipi[INVESTIGATOR_848626] 4 weeks for 
Tixel and Lipi[CONTACT_1603], respectively and δ=2.5. 
A change in TBUT of at least [ADDRESS_1180007] adjusts the “with in-subject correlation” between eyes. 
Least square means will be estimated by [CONTACT_848632].  The confidence 
interval for the estimates will be one -sided and a test value of 2.[ADDRESS_1180008] 
non-inferiority.  
 
3.4.2.  Secondary effectiveness endpoints  
1- OSDI  
- The change from baseline at 4 weeks and 12 -weeks in the Ocular Surface Disease Index 
(OSDI) will be calculated along with 95% confidence interval. The Paired T -test or 
Signed rank test for two means (paired observations) (as is appropriate) will be applied 
for testing the statistical significance of the changes within each study group.  
- The two -sample T -test or Non -parametric Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney Rank sum test for 
independent samples (as is appropriate) will be applied for testing the statistical 
significance of the difference in change from baseline in OSDI at  week [ADDRESS_1180009] adjusts the “within -subject correlation” between eyes. 
Least square means will be estim ated by [CONTACT_848632].  
 
3- TBUT  
Clinical Protocol Number: CLN [ADDRESS_1180010] as the 4-weeks 
follow -up visit.  
 
3.4.3.  Exploratory Analysis : 
- For each follow -up (4  weeks and 12 weeks), if non -inferiority is achieved, the TBUT 
score change from baseline as rated by a masked rater at the relevant follow will be 
analyzed  for superiority. The hypothesis set will be:  
- Ho: µTixel - µLipi[CONTACT_1603]  ≤ 0 
- HA: µTixel - µLipi[CONTACT_1603]  > 0 
3.5.Handling of Missing data  
Every effort will be made to complete follow -up for all patients and avoid missing data, in 
particular regarding the primary endpoint variable.  However, in the event data is missing, 
multiple imputation will be used.  Further details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.  
3.6.Interim Analysis  
No interim analyses are planned for this study.  
3.7.Sample Size Justification  
55 patients  will be enrolled in each treatment group.  
Sample size rationale:  
The sample size calculation is based on the primary efficacy endpoint. Specifically, the sample 
size calculation was based on the non -inferiority with a 2.[ADDRESS_1180011] -case scenario that the TBUT of both subjects eyes subjects 
is completely  correlated (r=1).   
Sample size justification:  
When the sample size in each group is 44, a two group one -sided 0.[ADDRESS_1180012] 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the test and standard are not non -inferior 
(the difference in means, μ T-μL, is 2.5 seconds or farther from zero in the same direction) in 
favor of the alternative hypothesis that the means of the two groups are non -inferior, assuming 
that the expected difference in means is [ADDRESS_1180013] deviation is 4.5 s.

Assuming a 20% drop -out rate, 55 patients will be enrolled in each group ensuring a sample 
size of 44 patients per group.

3.8.Poolability Analysis  
Patient demographic characteristics and background variables shall be summarized.  
The primary endpoint analysis will be conducted for each investigational site. The justification 
for pooling all the data to estimate a common effect across study sites requires the homogeneity 
of response across study sites. An analysis of variance (ANOVA ) of the differences will be 
generated to test whether the investigational sites differ with respect to primary study endpoint 
(only the site will be included in this analysis model). The test of inhomogeneity of response 
will be based on a two -sided signi ficance test at the 0.[ADDRESS_1180014] P<0.10 in the analysis of baseline characteristics by [CONTACT_848633].

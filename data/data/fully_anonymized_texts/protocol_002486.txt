2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  AND  BACKGROUND  
 
 2.1.1. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE   
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a  Significant Burden for Individuals and Health Care Systems.   OA affects over 32 
million U.S. adults (1 in 7) and is a leading cause of pain and disability 1. OA also has substantial impacts on 
work participation, mental health, sleep, development of other chronic conditions and even mortality 2. Already 
associated with significant health care utilization and costs, the prevalence of OA is expected to rise 
substantially in coming decades 1. This will place increasing demands on health care systems, highlighting the 
importance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_242475] a high quality of care for patients.     
There are Persistent Deficiencies in Quality of Care for OA. Multiple studies have highlighted discordance 
between guideline -based OA care and actual clinical practice 3-7. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_242476] (e.g., weight management, physical activity) 
and rehabilitation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 8, pass rates for quality indicators related to these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242477] 40% 4. 
Data from primary care visits involving treatment for OA in the U.S. show that <[ADDRESS_294178] also documented low use of and recommendations for behavioral and rehabilitative 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 3,5-7.  For example, in analyses of patients with knee OA across 3 different U.S. health systems, only 
40-50% of patients had ever received physical therapy for this condition 5. These gaps in care are highly 
problematic, as they fail to engage patients with evidence -based treatments that are known to improve key 
outcomes including pain, disability, mental health and even disease progression 10-13.    
Evidence -Based Care Models are Needed to Improve OA Care Quality in the US.   In response to the well -
established deficiencies in care quality for knee and hip OA, there has been increasing interest in the 
development of systematic OA care models internationally14-17. Care models are defined as organized, planned 
approaches to improving health, focusing on particular patient populations (e.g., individuals with OA) to ensure 
that every patient receives optimal medical care 18.  Although there have been several randomized controlled 
trials ( RCTs ) of OA care models 14,15,19, there are three major limitations with respect to how this research can 
inform care for OA in the U.S.  First, there have been no RCTs of OA care models in the U.S., and models 
developed in other countries are not designed to fit the organizational struc tures or payment models of U.S. 
healthcare systems. Second, the effectiveness of previously studied OA care models has been limited; we 
believe a key weakness has been the lack of robust incorporation of lifestyle components, particularly weight 
loss 15,19. Third, prior models have been limited in terms of reach and sustainability because of significant 
requirements for busy health care providers 14,15,17,19.  OA CARE will address each of these challenges, 
building an efficient, scalable model that is designed for sustainability and adequately addresses all 
components of guideline -concordant care. This exploratory trial will accomplish key steps toward the first RCT 
of an OA care model in the U.S.      
  
 2.1.2. SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE   
 The OA CARE  model incorporates the following 4 key principles and evidence from the scientific literature: 
1) In alignment with OA treatment guidelines,8,10,20 OA CARE  takes a multifactorial approach that includes both 
pharmacological and non -pharmacological components.  2) OA CARE  emphasizes delivery of lifestyle 
interventions, which are considered first -line treatments, appropriate for all patients with hip and knee OA 8,10,20.  
3) OA CARE  involves a stepped care approach, in which patients begin with first -line interventions (weight 
management and physical activity) and then advance to additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242478].21 A stepped care 
approach is efficient, patient -centered and supported by [CONTACT_28460], including our recent trial of a 
STepped Exercise Program for Knee Osteoarthritis (STEP -KOA).21,22 4) OA CARE will involve an innovative 
partnership with the YMCA to deliver weight management and exercise programs.  The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, Institute of Medicine and other organizations have recommended and prioritized clinic -
community partne rships based on evidence for effectiveness 23. These partnerships address the problems of 
limited time in clinical visits and the large number of patients who need these types of services.

Protocol v 4.0 - 20240304   
 2.1.3. PRIOR STUDIES AND RATIONALE FOR DEVELOPMENT  
This study builds on our team’s successful trials, programs and collaborations, including the following:  
• We have collectively conducted over a dozen trials of behavioral interventions that support the 
evidence base for weight management, exercise, physical therapy, psychological and multi -component 
interventions as effective treatments for knee and hip OA 22,[ADDRESS_294179] experience in delivering 
interventions involving PCPs a nd the use of algorithms to guide patient referrals to specific OA 
treatments 29,30.  
• The Osteoarthritis Action Alliance (OAAA), a key partner ([CONTACT_77217], Director), is a national coalition 
of over 130 organizations with a mission of reducing the public health burden of OA.  The OAAA has 
experience in working with the YMCA (one of their member organizations) and other community 
organizations to deliver evidence -based lifestyle interventions, has developed stakeholder -informed 
patient and provider OA educational tools, and is engaged with vast network of partner organizations 
that will be instrumental in future implementation of OA CARE .   
• OA CARE  has been developed in partnership with key stakeholders. At the outset of developi[INVESTIGATOR_242479], we convened a group of clinicians and clinic administrators representing Internal Medicine, 
Family Medicine, Orthopedics, Physical Therapy and Rheumatolo gy. OA CARE  is based on this 
group’s input regarding current gaps in care and processes that would be feasible and sustainable for 
clinics and providers.  We also received input from on the project from our Thurston Arthritis Research 
Center Patient Stakeholder Advis ory Board; they emphasized the importance of including rural patients 
and suggested that for patients who receive physical therapy during the study, we aim to integrate this 
with exercise opportunities at the YMCA, since this could enhance the benefits of physical therapy visits 
and augment integration of OA CARE  components.  We will engage with these stakeholder groups 
throughout all phases of this research program.  
• The YMCA is currently engaged in clinic -community partnership efforts of direct relevance to this study. 
In particular, our local partners at the Triangle YMCA are currently funded by [CONTACT_242501] a [ADDRESS_294180] 
aims to evaluate YMCA Medical Memberships as a population health approach and potential coverage 
as a healt h benefit; these goals are directly aligned with our plans for implementing and evaluating OA 
CARE . In addition, the Triangle YMCA has set up processes for sharing patients’ outcome data with 
their PCPs through the electronic health record (EHR). The Triangle YMCA has been very successful 
during their first year of this project, enrolling >700 patients  from 7 major health systems including 
University of North Carolina (UNC) Health.  
 
2.2 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
 2.2.1  KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
Emotional distress:  it is unlikely that the types of questions participants will be asked in this study will result  
in emotional distress, but we understand th at participants may be uncomfortable with answering questions  
about some aspect of their health or other things about them. To minimize this risk, we will let participants  
OA Clinic -Community C ARE Model ( OA CARE ) Version 4.0 
Protocol # 22-[ADDRESS_294181] information for the study team (e.g. OA CARE  
Navigator) and a YMCA health coach to discuss any concerns . 
 
Breach of confidentiality: we will be collecting some elements of personal health information necessary for  
the study. To minimize breaches of confidentiality, all data will be stored on a secure UNC server or a UNC 
IRB approved platform for sharing PHI (with YMCA ) and paper  information will be stored in locked filing 
cabinets in the office of a study team member, and only approved study personnel will have access to those 
data.  
 
Personal health information (e.g. patient name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_242502]) will be shared with YMCA health 
coaches and personnel conducting the YMCA weight loss and exercise programs .  Any information shared 
between approved UNC study team members and YMCA personnel will be done verbally by [CONTACT_648] , by 
[CONTACT_242503] a UNC IRB approved platform for sharing PHI.  
 
For participants in the OA CARE  intervention, p ersonal health information (e.g. patient name [CONTACT_242529]) will be shared with the participant’s PCP , as part of the  brief progress reports sent by [CONTACT_242504] . Any information shared between approved UNC study team members  (e.g. OA CARE  Navigator)  
and the participant’s PCP will be done by [CONTACT_242505] . 
 
Risks of Exercise:  Participants in the OA CARE  intervention will be involved in physical activity programming 
at the YMCA. This will be tailored to individuals with knee OA.  H owever, exercise programs may be 
associated with risk of injury, muscle soreness, and joint pain. The risk of sudden death during physical activity 
is about 1 death per 656,000 hours of physical activity. In general, the risk of these events with moderate 
physical activity is very low.  
 
Risks of weight loss interventions: Participants in the OA CARE  intervention will be involved in a weight 
management program at the YMCA. Side effects associated with weight loss in general may be hair loss, 
fatigue, weakness, gall bladder disease, and electrolyte abnormalities. Also, low blood sugar or low blood 
pressure (lightheaded or fainting) may occur during weight loss if a participant is taking medications  for 
diabetes or high blood pressure.  These risks are not specific to this research but also ap ply to usual care.  
2.2.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
Participants may experience improvements in pain, physical function or other symptoms related to OA, from 
participating in the OA  Care  program . It is possible that this study may not benefit participants directly, but 
participation in this study may lead to information that can benefit other patients with knee and /or hip OA, as 
well as their health care providers . 
 
 2.2.[ADDRESS_294182], evidence -
based approach to address these deficits in primary care  settings, we believe the value of the information to be 
gained outweighs the risks of participation in the study.

Protocol v 4.0 - 20240304  OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  JUSTIFICATION FOR ENDPOINTS  
Primary  
Assess the feasibility  
and acceptability of 
OA CARE  Feasibility metrics will 
include recruitment rate, 
completion rates for 
weight loss and exercise 
program visits, referrals to 
and utilization of services 
noted above and 
proportion of participants 
completing follow -up 
assessments. 
Acceptability of OA CARE  
will be evaluated from 
both patient and PCP 
perspectives. PCP 
perspectives and 
recommendations will be 
conducted as a 
stakeholder engagement 
activity; PCPs will not be 
considered research 
participants.   These metrics are essential for assessing the 
feasibility of conducting a larger scale trial of 
OA CARE .  
Obtain preliminary  data 
on the efficacy of OA 
CARE  with respect to the 
primary outcome of 
change in total Western 
Ontario and McMaster

assessed at baseline, [ADDRESS_294183] to 
improvement in body 
weight, physical activity 
and physical function.   
 Physical activity will be 
accessed via accelerometer.  
Moderate to vigorous 
physical activity ( MVPA ; 
primary metric), light 
intensity activity, sedentary 
minutes, step counts and 
other PA metrics, assessed 
at baseline, 6 months and 12 
months.   
 
Physical Function tests: 30-
second chair  stand test ,  
timed  up-and-go test , 2-
minute march test  and single These secondary metrics will be assessed 
because they are also key outcomes in OA , 
and they map onto the different components 
of the OA CARE  intervention . The 12 -month 
time point corresponds to the end of the OA-
CARE  intervention , and the 6 -month time 
point will allow assessment of the time 
courses of changes in outcomes.

WOMAC will be administered at baseline, 6 -months and 12 -months, along 
with secondary outcomes including body weight, physical activity, physical 
function  (baseline and 12 months only) , sleep measures and psychological 
measures. We will also collect preliminary data on costs of OA CARE .  
 
This will be an exploratory RCT with 60 patients equally randomized to OA 
CARE  or a usual care (UC) control group (Figure 1) ; randomization will be 
in block sizes of 20 . Assessments will occur at baseline, 6 -month follow -up 
and 12 -month follow -up.  The UC group will be offered a 12 -month YMCA 
Medical Membership (described below) once they have completed follow -
up assessments.

included a UC group (rather than conducting a single -group study) for several reasons. First, this provides an 
opportunity to assess acceptability of randomization to a UC group, from the patient perspective.  Second, we 
will be able to evaluate follow -up rates for both groups, which will inform potential adaptations and sample size 
estimation for a larger trial. Third, this will provide a better preliminary  assessment of the efficacy of OA CARE  
(Aim 2) than a single group pre -post trial, since improvement is consistently observed in control groups within 
OA trials 22,29,31,38.  We have specifically selected a UC control group (versus an attention control condition) 
because our ultimate goal is to test how well OA CARE  performs relative to the typi[INVESTIGATOR_242480]. Assessments for this trial will be conducted at baseline, 6 -months (corresponding to the beginning of the 
second phase of OA CARE ), and 12 -months (intervention completion).

5   STUDY POPULATION  
 
5.1  INCLUSION CRITERIA  
 
Participants for this trial will be patients with a clinician diagnosis of knee or hip OA, self -reported knee or hip 
pain of ≥3 (scale of 0 -10) on most days of the week, body mass index (BMI) ≥27 kgm2,, and not currently 
meeting physical activity recommendations 39. We will base study inclusion on a clinician diagnosis of hip or 

OA Clinic -Community C ARE Model ( OA CARE ) Version 4.0 
Protocol # 22-0865     
13 
Protocol v 4.0 - 20240304  knee OA, rather than obtaining new radiographs, because OA CARE  is designed for providers to initiate at any 
point in the course of care (not necessarily directly following a diagnosis or new imaging). The rationale for BMI 
and physical activity criteria is that patients with higher BMI and who are inactive are at gre ater risk for OA 
progression and worse outcomes, and weight management and exercise are key components of OA CARE  
42,43.  We chose a minimum BMI of 27 kgm2 because of the association with earlier mortality and the 
precedence of this threshold in other OA trials 11,32,44.

N/A 
 
5.4  SCREEN FAILURES  
 
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in this study but are not subsequently 
assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. Individuals who do not meet the criteria for 
participation in this trial (screen failure) because of meeting one or more exclusion criteria  (e.g., development 
of an exclusionary health condition) will not be rescreened.   
 
5.5.  STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION   
We will recruit patients from UNC Health. In particular, we will partner with the UNC Internal Medicine Clinic  
and UNC Family Medicine , which serves high proportions of patients who are African American and non -white 
Hispanic, as well as uninsured patients. This is important because of disparities in OA among these 
demographic groups45, and our aim for OA CARE  to particularly reach the most vulnerable patients. Our team 
has a strong track record of recruiting African American and non -White Hispanic patients 28,31,46.  Our main 
recruitment method will mirror the process by [CONTACT_242507].  Specifically, PCPs will be asked to refer patients to OA CARE . This may occur via the EHR or 
another UNC approved method of transferring PHI.  A study team member will then screen the EHR for 
potential exclusion criteria and contact [CONTACT_242508] a brief screening 
questionnaire.  If needed, we will also identify potential participants via an EHR data pull, then send 
introductory letters and follow up with a screening phone call.  However, a key goal for this exploratory study is 
to develop procedures to maximize provider referrals, as this will be critical for downstream implementation.  
All eligi ble patients will be asked to attend a baseline visit that will involve completion of consent, baseline 
assessments and receipt of an accelerometer.  Following return of the accelerometer, participants will be 
informed of their randomization assignment via  telephone. A participant will be considered enrolled once they 
have consented and been randomized.   
 
To facilitate completion of recruitment calls, as well as baseline and follow -up assessment calls, we will call 
participants on different times of day and different days, across multiple weeks.  We have used this strategy 
successfully in prior studies to r each participants at times convenient to them.  
  
6.0  STUDY INTERV ENTIONS  
6.1  STUDY INTERVENTION ADMINISTRATION  
 
OA CARE  Intervention   
OA Clinic -Community C ARE Model ( OA CARE ) Version 4.0 
Protocol # 22-0865     
15 
Protocol v 4.0 - 20240304  Overview .  For patients, OA CARE  includes 
evidence -based behavioral weight management and 
exercise interventions, as well as tailored referrals to 
physical therapy, psychological interventions, 
additional weight / nutrition -related services and 
sleep -related services based on patient -specific 
needs and in coordination with the PCP (Figure 2).  
These referrals will be based on screening 
questions administered six months after initiating 
weight management and exercise interventions; the 
rationale for this timing is that it allows us to 
evaluate which additional services patients may 
need after engaging in “first line” therapi[INVESTIGATOR_53301] a 
meaningful period of time 4,8,10. PCPs of patients 
enrolled in OA CARE  will be given a video -based 
summary of ACR treatment guidelines 10, 
collaborate on patient referrals, and receive brief 
progress reports on their enrolled patients.  An OA 
CARE Navigator  will facilitate all activities within the 
care pathway, including scheduling patients for 
weight management and exercise classes (in 
collaboration with the YMCA), conducting 6 -month 
screening questions, coordinating referrals with 
PCPs, preparing patient progress reports for PCPs, and serving as a point person for both patient and PCPs. 
Importantly for implementation, the OA CARE Navigator role does not require clinical or other specialized 
expertise, so in clinical settings this role could be performed by a variety of personnel (e.g., chronic care 
managers, nurses, schedulers).   
Weight Loss & Exercise Interventions. Evidence -based weight loss and exercise programs will be delivered by 
[CONTACT_242509], within the structure of the Medical Membership.  (All services provided to study 
participants by [CONTACT_242510]; they will note be delivering a study -specific 
intervention.) This membership provides access to multiple group exercise programs, exercise facilities, and a 
health coach who assists members with meeting health goals and selecting appropriate p rograms and classes. 
All patients in OA CARE will begin with participation in the YMCA’s Weight Loss Program  (Program) . This 
program involves [ADDRESS_294189] not met weight loss goals and / or would like continued s tructure and support for these behavior 
changes.  The Triangle YMCA will deliver the Weight Loss Program to OA CARE members in groups of 
approximately 10; this will provide cohesion for OA CARE participants. In the beginning  of the study , the 
Program will  be delivered virtually  (e.g. video conferencing platform)  for feasibility reasons  (e.g., potential for 
study participants to reside in different geographic locations that would make travel to a central location 
challenging) . However, the Program may be of fered in -person in the future.   During the screening call, we will 
assess whether the patient has internet access and a device (computer, tablet, smartphone)  on which they can 
access the Program . If the patient screens ineligible for this reason, we will ask the patient if they would like to 
be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], if the Program is offered in -person at a future date.  If we do offer the Program in person, this will 
no longer be considered an exclusion criterion. The YMCA offers many exercise programs and classes 
appropriate for individuals with OA. A YMCA health coach will assist participants with selecting an exercise 
program (including appropriateness based on their pa in and functional limitations) and continuing to engage 
with exercise -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242483] 12 -month involvement in OA CARE.  The UNC study team will 
also give p articipants instructions regarding how to access a free Walk With Ease workbook (through the 
OAAA’s online portal) and take advantage of other tools available through this program.   

OA Clinic -Community C ARE Model ( OA CARE ) Version 4.0 
Protocol # 22-0865     
16 
Protocol v 4.0 - 20240304  Additional Tailored Services. After  6-month s, we will administer a series of questionnaires to assess patients’ 
needs for and interest in additional interventions included in OA treatment guidelines (Table 1) 10,20.  Our 
multidisciplinary study team, which includes individuals with deep expertise in OA treatment and guidelines, 
has developed algorithms to guide these referrals. Patients will be given information on the types of 
interventions shown in Table 1  (via mail or email), and the OA CARE  Navigator will engage patients in a 
shared decision -making process  (via phone)  regarding additional referrals, with a focus on interventions for 
which they meet criteria shown in Table 1.  However, the OA CARE  Navigator will facilitate referrals and 
recommendations for any services of interest to patients, regardless of criteria shown in the table. Any referrals 
for clinically -based services (e.g., physical therapy, sleep testing) will be coordinated with the P CP.  Table 1 
also shows examples of interventions and resources within each category, ranging from free, publicly available 
programs to individual clinical services; some services will be relevant regardless of geographic location and 
some will be customized based on local resources, as we have done previously 33. The OA CARE  Navigator 
will also call participants about a month later to follow up on any questions they may have regarding resources 
or referrals.  The OA CARE  Navigator may also conduct additional calls with a participant if needed to 
coordinate connection with resources or referrals.

for free, evidence -based cognitive behavioral 
therapy for insomnia programs (e.g., CBTI -
Coach app), and referrals to local providers or 
group programs focusing on sleep -related 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].    
Provider Intervention.  As noted above, we have intentionally designed the PCP intervention to be brief, 
therefore maximizing feasibility and engagement.  There are three components to the PCP intervention.  The 
first is a  set of  brief video s summarizing current OA treatment guidelines, with a focus on practical application 
and the role of the PCP.  Second, providers will receive progress reports for their enrolled patient s through 
encrypted email  or other UNC approved method of sharing PHI ; this  will include changes in symptoms and 
health behaviors from the study team at [ADDRESS_294190] Training  
OA Care Navigator : The OA Care will be trained by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_242485]. 
This training will include general instruction in intervention delivery steps, processes for communicating with 
YMCA personnel and PCPs vis email and the electronic health records, content for notes to PCPs, 
administration of 6 -month screening questionnaires, and discussion of potential services and referrals during 
the 6 -month phone call. For the 6 -month screening questionnaire s and discussion  of referrals, training will 
OA Clinic -Community C ARE Model ( OA CARE ) Version 4.0

17 
Protocol v 4.0 - 20240304  include mock sessions with both experienced study team members and non -study member volunteers 
(observed by [CONTACT_458]). The OA Care Navigator will also view the video created for PCPs, as 
well as other materials from the OAAA , to become highly familiar with OA symptoms and care.  
 
Fidelity Monitoring  
Monitoring of Intervention Contacts . [CONTACT_54350] or another experienced study team member will monitor study 
intervention contacts and provide feedback to the interventionists, including the following:  
 
• OA CARE Navigator 6 -month phone calls: The first [ADDRESS_294191] in services and referrals.  
 
 
6.3  MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  
 
The randomization scheme will be generated by [CONTACT_242511].  
The database will be configured so that blinded study personnel (e.g., those conducting follow -up 
assessments) will not have access to randomization information. The participants will not be notified of 
randomization assignment until all baseline assessments are complete.  In addition , an individual participant’s 
randomization assignment will not be known to any study personnel until baseline assessments are complete.   
 
6.4  STUDY INTERVENTION ADHERENCE   
 
The study database will be used to track participants’ completion of all assessment visits, as well as all 
contacts with the OA CARE  Navigator . The coordinator  will also maintain close communication with the OA 
CARE Navigator  regarding facilitat ion of  all activities within the care pathway . The YMCA will provide  
documentation of patients’ participation in specific  YMCA  programs  to the OA CARE  Navigator ; this 
information will also be  summarized for P CPs. Also, f or each patient, the OA CARE  Navigator will maintain a 
checklist of intervention activities, target dates, dates of completion, and comments.  
 
6.5  CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
  
Participants will be p ermitted to continue any other OA treatment during the course of the study.  
 
7  STUDY INTERVENTION/ DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1  DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
When a participant discontinues the OA CARE  intervention , they will be asked if they are willing to continue 
with other remaining activities (e.g., follow -up assessments) based on the  study protocol.   If a clinically 
significant finding is identified after enrollment  (e.g. health -related changes that may change the safety level of 
participation ), the investigator or qualified designee will determine if any change in participant management is 
needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an adverse event (AE). The data to be collected 
at the tim e of study intervention discontinuation will include the reason(s) for discontinuing the participant from 
the intervention, and methods for determining the need to discontinue .

Protocol # 22-0865     
18 
Protocol v 4.0 - 20240304  7.2  PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY   
 
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue a participant from the study for the following reasons:  
 
• Lost-to-follow up; unable to contact [CONTACT_1130]  
• Any event or medical condition or situation occurs such that con tinued collection of follow -up study data 
would not be in the best interest of the participant or might require an additional treatment that would 
confound the interpretation of the study  
• The participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously recognized) that 
precludes further study participation  
The reason for participant discontinuation  or withdrawal from the study will be recorded in the study database.   
Participants who discontinue or are withdrawn will be replaced up to the point of randomization assignment 
being given to the participant.  Once participants are given their randomization assignment, they will be 
counted toward the total study sample size and not replaced.

8   STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
8.1  ENDPOINT AND OTHER NON -SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Measures will be collected at baseline, 6-months and 12 -months  by a trained study team member  blinded to 
randomization assignment. Measures will be administered in-person at baseline and 12 -months and at 6 -
months via phone.  We may schedule a time to call the participant before or after the in -person 12-month visit  
to complete the questionnaires over the phone. Participants will be paid $60 for baseline and 12 -month 
assessments ($45 for in -person visits + $15 to wear and return the accelerometer) and $40 for 6 -month 
assessments ($25 for phone -based assessments + $15 to wear and return the accelerometer).  
 
Feasibility Metrics . We will compute the proportion of patients who are eligible and who consent to participate 
in the study, mean number of intervention visits attended, and proportion of participants who complete follow -
up assessments. We will also determine the proportion s of participants who meet criteria for and are interested 
in each type of additional intervention (at 6 -month follow -up), and we will track participants’ use of these 
services during the study period.   
Acceptability of OA CARE . We will ask all participants in the OA CARE group to complete a series of 
satisfaction ratings and open -ended questions regarding different components of the intervention.  We will not 
collect formal measures from referring PCPs.  However, following the completion of the study, we will contact 
[CONTACT_242513]. This will be 
approached as a stakeholder engagement type of activity, and PCPs will not be considered research 
participants  for this purpose .  
Primary Patient Outcome:  Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC ).  The 
primary outcome for this study is the WOMAC, a measure of lower extremity pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), 
and function (17 items).  All items are rated on a Likert scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms). The 
OA Clinic -Community C ARE Model ( OA CARE ) Version 4.0 
Protocol # 22-[ADDRESS_294194] validity and internal 
consistency 54.  The WOMAC has been widely used in trials of behavioral interventions for patients with lower 
extremity OA, confirming its sensitivity to change in this context. In addition to the total WOMAC score (primary 
outcome), we will separately examine WOMAC pai n and function subscales.  
Secondary Patient Outcomes .  
Body Weight. We will assess body weight using a research / clinical grade scale (e.g., Tanita) that will be 
calibrated regularly.  We will also measure participants’ height in order to  calculate body mass index.   
Physical Activity. All participants will be asked to wear an Actigraph GT3X+ (Pensacola, FL) 55at the hip during 
waking hours for [ADDRESS_294195] used successfully in 
prior work 33.  Physical activity metrics will include minutes of any intensity activity (primary), minutes of 
moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity, step counts and sedentary time.  We will also ask participants 
to complete a modified version of the Community Health Activities Model Program for Seniors Physical Activity 
Measure 56, which provides  information on the types of activities in which participants are engaging.   
Physical Function.  We will administer tests recommended by [CONTACT_242514] a [ADDRESS_294196] as an assessment of endurance 58 These tests will be conducted in accordance 
with established protocols 57,58.  
Exploratory Patient Outcomes .  
Sleep Measures. Sleep apnea symptoms will be assessed with the STOP Questionnaire 52, and insomnia 
symptoms will be assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index 53.  These measures were selected based on 
clinical practice guidelines 59.   
Psychological Measures .  We will assess depressive symptoms via the Patient Health Questionnaire -8 (8-item 
measure, higher  60, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale 61, and the Arthritis Self -Efficacy Scale 62,63.  These are all 
validated scales used widely in the context of OA trials.  
Balance . We will assess balance with a single leg stance test , using established protocols  58.  The maximum 
possible standing time will be [ADDRESS_294197] the following information to characterize the study sample: age, race 
/ ethnicity, sex, education level, work status, household income, health insurance status, marital status, 
comorbid illnesses 64, joints with arthritis symptoms, and duration of knee / hip OA symptoms.  
Costs . Although costs are not a primary focus of this exploratory trial, we will collect these data to refine 
processes for the larger trial. This will include costs of the YMCA Medical Membership, costs (to both the 
health system and patients) associated with additional clinical services that result from 6 -month screening and 
referrals, and patients’ self -reported costs for engaging any additional community -based services or programs.   
 
8.2  SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
  If a study team member learns of a ny adverse events ( AEs) that occur in the course of participants’ home 
exercise , this  will be documented on the Adverse Events form , as described below.  
 
8.3  ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS   
 8.3.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
This protocol uses the definition of adverse event from DHHS Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP): 
Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (for 
example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the 
subject’s participation in the research, whether  or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the 
OA Clinic -Community C ARE Model ( OA CARE ) Version 4.0 
Protocol # 22-0865     
20 
Protocol v 4.0 - 20240304  research (modified from the definition of adverse events in the 1996 International Conference on 
Harmonization E -6 Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice).  
 
 8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
This protocol uses the definition of serious adverse event from DHHS OHRP:  any adverse event that results in 
death;  is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred);  results in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  results in a persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity;  results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in this d efinition (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
 
 8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
 
  [IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT  
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -investigators , if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_125234] .  The following guidelines will be 
used to describe severi ty:  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the 
term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious” .] 
 
  [IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
All AEs  will have their relationship to study procedures, including the intervention, assessed by  [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -
investigators based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about 
causality will be graded using the categories below.  
• Definitely Related  – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, 
occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention administr ation and cannot be explained by 
[CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the study intervention 
(dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or 
phenomenologically definitive, with u se of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.  
• Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a 
reasonable time after administration of the study inter vention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal 
(dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
• Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or evidence 
exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive 
etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
  [IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS  
OA Clinic -Community C ARE Model ( OA CARE ) Version 4.0 
Protocol # 22-[ADDRESS_294198]. Saint -Surin  (co-investigator on the study ) will be responsible for determining whether an AE is 
expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event 
is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study procedures.  
 
 8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an AE or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of study team members 
during study visits.  All AEs, not otherwise precluded per the protocol, will be captured on the  Adverse Event 
Form.  Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, PI [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -investigator ’s assessment 
of severity, relationship to study procedures (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a 
diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study will be 
documented appropriatel y regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
Any medical or psychiatric condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at 
any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at 
each level of severity to be performed. Documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_31233].  
The Project Coordinator will record events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is 
obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.  
Participants are identified in the EMR as a study participant and for each AE/SAE occurrence, research team 
member s will receive  an alert through EMR. AEs or SAEs may also be reported to study physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242486].  Events will be followed for outcome information  until resolution or

8.4. UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
 8.4.1 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by [CONTACT_9155] (OHRP). OHRP considers unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to 
include, in general, any incident, experience, or  outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
(1) Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
 
(2) Related or possibly related to participation in the research. Possibly related means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_226592]); and  
 
(3) Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
OHRP recognizes that it may be difficult to determine whether a particular incident, experience, or outcome is 
unexpected and whether it is related or possibly related to participation in the research.  OHRP notes that an 
incident, experience, or outcome t hat meets the three criteria above generally will warrant consideration of 
substantive changes in the research protocol or informed consent process/document or other corrective 
actions in order to protect the safety, welfare, or rights of participants or o thers.   
The following corrective actions or substantive changes that could be considered in response to an 
unanticipated problem include:  
 
o Changes to the research protocol initiated by [CONTACT_242516];  
o modification of inclusion or exclusion criteria to mitigate the newly identified risks;  
o implementation of additional procedures for monitoring subjects; suspension of enrollment of new 
subjects;  
o suspension of research procedures in currently enrolled subjects;  
OA Clinic -Community C ARE Model ( OA CARE ) Version 4.0 
Protocol # 22-0865     
23 
Protocol v 4.0 - 20240304  o modification of informed consent documents to include a description of newly recognized risks;  
o provision of additional information about newly recognized risks to previously enrolled subjects.  
 
Only a small subset of adverse events occurring in human subjects participating in research will meet these 
three criteria for an unanticipated problem. Furthermore, there are other types of incidents, experiences, and 
outcomes that occur during the conduc t of human subjects research that represent unanticipated problems but 
are not considered adverse events.  For example, some unanticipated problems involve social or economic 
harm instead of the physical or psychological harm associated with adverse events .  In other cases, 
unanticipated problems place subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no harm occurs.   
 
 8.4.2 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS REPORTING  
All UPs will be reported to UNC IRB  within 48 hours of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_223305].   All UPs will be 
reported to the NIAMS and the SO (through the NIAMS Executive Secretary) within [ADDRESS_294202] an exploratory randomized controlled trial with 60 patients with 
knee and / or hip OA equally randomized to OA CARE  or a usual care (UC) control group.  Sub-aims  and 
associated hypotheses  are:  
Aim 1.  Assess the feasibility and acceptability of OA CARE .  There are no specific hypotheses associated 
with this aim.  Analyses will be descriptive in nature.      
Aim 2.  Obtain preliminary  data on the efficacy of OA CARE  with respect to the primary outcome of 
change in total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score.   We 
hypothesize that participants in OA CARE will have clinically meaningful improvements in WOMAC scores at 
6- and [ADDRESS_294203] this trial to be highly powered. However, we do note that for the projected total of 
n=[ADDRESS_294204] of clustering within the OA CARE  arm, we would 
exceed 80% power to detect an effect size of at least 1.[ADDRESS_294205]. However, based on rates of drop -out in prior trials 28,29,31, our target sample size of 60 participants will 
allow ample experience with study procedures. Our analytic strategy (described below) will also accommodate 
missing data due to dropout, missed visits, and loss -to-follow -up.   
 
9.3  POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  
OA Clinic -Community C ARE Model ( OA CARE ) Version 4.0 
Protocol # 22-0865     
24 
Protocol v 4.0 - 20240304   
The primary analyses will be conducted using an intent -to-treat approach.  Supportive exploratory analyses 
may be conducted to consider samples with greater completion of study intervention visits.  Since this is a n 
exploratory trial, the nature of these supportive analyses will be based on observed patterns of intervention 
contacts .  
 
9.4  STATISTICAL ANALYSES PLAN  
 
The primary patient outcome of the total WOMAC score will be statistically analyzed between experimental 
groups across the follow -up time points through a general linear mixed model (GLMM).  Fixed effects will 
include indicators for the OA CARE  group, the 12 -month follow -up time point, and their interaction (group by 
[CONTACT_5586]).  Additional fixed effects will be baseline total WOMAC score and possibly any covariates exhibiting 
random imbalance between groups.  Random effects will be included for pati ents (to acc ount for their repeated 
measures) and for groupi[INVESTIGATOR_242488] (e.g. 10 -participant Weight Management Program 
groups) to account for clustering. Customized statistical linear contrasts will be constructed to estimate the 
effect size via the difference in means for OA CARE  versus usual care, along with the corresponding 95% 
confidence limits, separately at [ADDRESS_294206]. 
Exploratory testing of efficacy will also be conducted using these statistical contrasts. The approach outlined 
above will be repeated separately for the WOMAC pain and function subscale scores, as well as for the 
secondary outcomes identified above. If any of these outcomes exhibit distributions that deviate markedly from 
normality, alternatives will include tra nsformations to normalize the distribution and variable categorization with 
appropriate data analysis (e.g., mixed -effects logistic models or logistic models utilizing generalized estimating 
equations to accommodate correlated observations). An intent -to-treat approach will be followed in these 
analyses to provide a conservative approach. A two -sided 0.05 significance level will be applied to each 
outcome with no adjustment for multiple comparison in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_242489]. The 
GLM M approach utilizes all available follow -up data and accommodates missing data under a missing at 
random (MAR) paradigm. If missing data are extensive and deemed not to be MAR, analyses will be 
conducted using multiple imputation, yielding complete data fo r all participants. The feasibility and acceptability 
metrics will be summarized through descriptive statistics, along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals, 
separately by [CONTACT_242517]. This includes frequencies and proportions o f patients who 
are eligible, who consent to participate in the study, who complete follow -up assessments, who meet criteria 
for and are interested in each type of additional intervention (at 6 -month follow -up), and who use of these 
services during the stud y period.  Means and standard deviations will be computed for the number of 
intervention visits attended by [CONTACT_4317].  
 
10  SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 REGULATORY, ETHICAL, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
 10.1.1 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS  
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks will be given to the 
participant and written documentation of informed consent will be completed prior to starting the study 
intervention.  The following consent materia ls are submitted with this protocol: Adult Consent Form.  
 
OA Clinic -Community C ARE Model ( OA CARE ) Version 4.0 
Protocol # 22-0865     
25 
Protocol v 4.0 - 20240304  [IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
 
Once a potential participant meets the medical record and telephone screening criteria for eligibility, and is 
interested in participating , they will be asked to attend a baseline visit that will involve completion of consent, 
baseline assessments and receipt of an accelerometer . No other study activities will occur until this process is 
completed.    
 
We will use a UNC IRB approved consent form / script with included language that satisfies the HIPAA 
requirements and outlines the protection of health information utilized in the study.   
 
Written informed consent will be obtained by a trained study team member.  The study team member will read 
the IRB approved consent form to the potential participant and provide an opportunity for him/her to ask any 
questions that they may have about the research study.  We anticipate this process to take approximately [ADDRESS_294207] additional questions or concerns regarding 
the study.  During this phase of the consent process, it will be stressed th at the participant is not obligated to 
participate in the study, that participation is completely voluntary, and that he/she may withdrawal from the 
study at any time without penalty.  Also, potential risks from participating in the study will be outlined in the 
consent form, as are the measures taken to protect against study specific risks.  Once the information in the 
consent  form is fully reviewed and understood by [CONTACT_39359], he/she will be asked to decide at that time if 
they would like to voluntar ily participate in the research study.  If the individual does choose to participate in the 
study, both the study team member and the participant will sign two copi[INVESTIGATOR_1076].  The 
participant will receive one copy for their records and the other copy will be stored in a locked file cabinet of a 
study team member.     
 
If after review  of the consent form, the potential participant is not sure they would like to participate in the study 
at this time, they may choose to consider the study further, and then contact [CONTACT_242518].  
 
Once informed consent has been collected, the study team member will collect written  HIPAA authorization, 
and no activities will commence until this is received by [CONTACT_3476].  
 
Participants will only be included if they have capacity to give legally effective consent. Additionally, this study 
will only recruit participants whom are English speakers.    
 
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_294208] igator, funding agency, and regulatory authorities. 
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_112578], the IRB, and 
sponsor/funding agency and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. S tudy participants will 
be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.  
 
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]    
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Determination that the primary endpoint has been met

 10.1.6 SAFETY OVERSIGHT  
Because this study involves only survey -based assessments and digital recordings and participation in mild / 
moderate physical activity programs, this is a minimal risk study we do not believe it requires a data safety 
monitoring board.    
Safety oversight will be under the direction of the S afety Officer  (SO) . The SO will be independent from the 
study conduct and free of conflict of interest. The SO’s role is to advise the PI (and not the NIAMS) regarding 
participant safety, scientific integrity and ethical conduct of the study.  On a biannual basis  or as requested , the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_242493] a study summary, a report of all AEs, and any problems or issues that have been

Protocol v 4.0 - 20240304   10.1.8 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL  
 
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented as follows : 
 
Informed consent --- During the consenting process, the study team member will review the completed consent 
document to ensure the participant has signed and dated the consent form accurately prior to completing any 
other study activities.    
 
Source documents and the electronic data --- Data from the physical function and balance  will be initially 
captured on source documents and will ultimately be entered into the study database; all other data from study 
measures will be entered directly into the study database.  To ensure accuracy site staff will compare a 
representative sample  of source data against the database.  
 
Protocol Deviations  – The study team will review protocol deviations on an ongoing basis and will implement 
corrective actions when the quantity or nature of deviations are deemed to be at a level of concern.  
 
Should independent monitoring become necessary, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_9115], 
source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456]/funding agency, 
and inspection by [CONTACT_242524] y authorities.  
 
 10.1.[ADDRESS_294213] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
 
 [IP_ADDRESS] DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
Study data will be stored on a secure UNC server in a folder accessible only to IRB -approved study team 
members. We will use REDCap to store all patient information and dispositions, responses to screening and 
outcome assessments. REDCap is a secure web ap plication supported at UNC that can be used to build and 
manage case report forms, surveys, and other data capture mechanisms.  Additionally, for the OA CARE  
intervention, the participant ’s name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_242525], 
by [CONTACT_242520] a UNC IRB approved platform for sharing PHI.  Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_242494] a minimum and if shared will be done via a UNC IRB approved platform for sharing 
PHI.  Any paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_242495]’s individual study folder, which will be kept in a locked 
file cabinet of a study team member.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
 
Research study records will be maintained for no less than [ADDRESS_294214]’s medical 
record will be kept indefinitely. No r ecords will be destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor/funding 
agency, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor/funding agency to inform the investigator when 
these documents no longer need to be retained.  
 
 10.1.10 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
This protocol defines a protocol deviation as any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol,  
ICH GCP, or Manual of Procedures (MOP) requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the 
participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions will be 
developed by [CONTACT_242526].  
 
These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:  
• Section 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, subsections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
OA Clinic -Community C ARE Model ( OA CARE ) Version 4.0 
Protocol # 22-0865     
29 
Protocol v 4.0 - 20240304  • Section 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, subsection 5.1.1  
• Section 5.[ADDRESS_294215] participant safety to the UNC IRB within 7 business days of the time the PI [INVESTIGATOR_242496], if the protocol deviati on harmed participant(s) or others or placed participant(s) or others at increased 
risk of harm. Otherwise, protocol deviations/violations that occur but do not affect participant safety will be 
submitted with the routine safety reports as noted. Protocol deviations will be sent to the reviewing IRB per 
their policies. The site investigator will be responsible for knowing and adhering to the reviewing IRB 
requirements. Further details about the handling of protocol deviations will be included in the MOP.  
Additionally, protocol deviations impacting participant safety will be sent to the NIAMS (through the NIAMS 
Executive Secretary) and the SO within 48 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event, and that the 
SO’s feedback will be shared with the NI AMS once received.  
 
 10.1.11 PUBLICATION AND DATA SHARING POLICY  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the following publication and data sharing policies and 
regulations:

 Table of Contents  
Ancillary Effects of Oral Naloxegol (Movantik)  ................................ ................................ ......................  [ADDRESS_992848] advanced our knowledge o f the mechanisms of pain resulting from 
surgical incision and associated tissue injury. Postoperative pain results from combination of 
nociceptive and inflammatory components [1]. The noc iceptive component results from activation 
of peripheral sensory neurons damaged by [CONTACT_727187], and fades gradually as tissues heal. 
The inflammatory component enhances pain sensitivity via release of mediators from the 
surgically injured tissue. Ce ntral neuronal sensitization also seems to contribute to postoperative 
pain and hyperalgesia. [1, 2] Due to aforementioned mechanisms , pain is present in spontaneous 
resting at the site of surgery plus surrounding tissues. Movement or touching o f the wound site, 
breathing, coughing, and gastrointestinal motility can all evoke pain. Unrelieved postoperative 
pain leads to multiple physiological and psychological consequences, which worsen outcomes. For 
example, inadequate perioperative analgesia is  associated with myocardial ischemia, impaired  
wound healing, delayed gastrointestinal motility, atelectasis, and postoperative pneumonia. [3-5] 
Furthermore, poorly controlled acute pain is strongly associated with development of persistent 
incisional pain, which can be devastating for patients. [6, 7] 
A. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_727111] “multimodal analgesia” of using different drugs with different 
mode of action to interfere with the pain pathway, such as using non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_14067] (e.g. 
NSAIDS, steroids, regional anesthesia) have been developed to improve postoperative pain 
management, opi[INVESTIGATOR_727112]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_727113]. Three types of opi[INVESTIGATOR_727114]: mu, 
delta, and kappa receptors. The most commonly used opi[INVESTIGATOR_727115]. The mu1 
receptor is responsible for the production of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -induced analgesia, whereas mu2 receptors 
provoke  respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], cardiovascular effects, and inhibition of gastrointestinal motility 
commonly seen with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. [8-10] Sole reliance on opi[INVESTIGATOR_727116]. [11] 
5 
 Adverse events associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_727117] (POUR).  It has been shown in multiple studies that systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_727118]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_727119]. This effect is directly related to the dose of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_727120] -modal analgesia has been shown  to reduce urinary 
retention. [12, 13] The true incidence of POUR is unclear but is estimated to vary between 5 -
70%. [14] 
The opi[INVESTIGATOR_727121]. In addition, opi[INVESTIGATOR_727122] c overstimulation,  
resulting in increased bladder outlet resistance. The combination of decreased sensation of fullness 
and increased outlet resistance increase the risk of urinary retention. Studies suggest that the half -
life of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_727123].  
Type of opi[INVESTIGATOR_727124]. Studies that 
evaluated orthopedic patients who received fentanyl (short half -life) for post -operative analgesia 
noted that these patie nts experienced significantly less risk for urinary retention than those who 
received morphine  (intermediate half -life).  Several authors have demonstrated that the risk of 
retention is also increased in patients using PCA compared to those receiving interm ittent IV or 
IM opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
Although the cause of POUR is multifactorial and depends on type and duration of surgery 
as well as existence of comorbidities, systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_727125]. Urinary 
retention requires urethral catheterization and potentially indwelling catheter, leading to patient 
discomfort, hemorrhage, and increased risk of UTI . Urinary catheters can provide an opportunity 
for gram negative bacterial infections that can lead to further urological and infectious 
manifestations (e. g. pyelonephritis, urosepsis, death). [15] Catheter -related UTI  is responsible for 
13% of 100,000 nosocomial infection related deaths each year .[16] It affects about one million 
Americans annually and is a significant source of morbidity and mortality. It is the most common 
“preventable” nosocomial infection that accounts for over $400 million spent annually in the U.S. 
alone. [15, 17] Bacteria causing the UTI can potentially hematogenously spread  and lead to surgical 
site infection. [18] Bacterial seeding from UTI is a special concern after certain type of su rgery,  
[ADDRESS_992849] 
shown mixed results. [19, 20] Naloxone  had been tried in the past its reversal of analgesia has 
limited its usefulness in the clinical setting. [21] Furthermore, naloxone’s short half -life of 1 -1.5 
hours is outlasted by [CONTACT_46248][INVESTIGATOR_2438]’ effects on the bladder. There is a need for an effective treatment 
to for urinary  retention without mitigating  the analgesic effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. [22] 
Postoperative ileus ( POI) is  common after surgery (incidence of 4.5%), and is a transient 
loss of peristalsis from inflammatory response and release of endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_727126]. [23-25] POI contributes to patient discomfort, morbidity, and is the one of  the major reasons 
for prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_727127]. [25, 26] Opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328], belonging to 
the G -protein coupled receptor family, are found throughout the enteric nervous system . The 
actions of opi[INVESTIGATOR_727128] -receptors which lead to: inhibition 
of release of excitatory acetylcholine, non -peristalsis contractions, decreased water/electrolyte 
secretion, and increased tone of pyloric and intestinal  sphincters. [27-30] The result is an 
exacerbated postoperative ileus and prolongs the return of bowel function . The true  incidence of 
POI is unknown and varies between the type of surgery but is estimated between 3 -15%. [31] 
Currently there is no promising treatment for POI. Several peripheral opi[INVESTIGATOR_727129].  [32, 33]   
Patients in the postoperative period will experience many unavoidable physio logic 
derangements as a result of anesthesia and surgery. Most studies have examined the effect of 
anesthetic practices on major clinical outcomes, such as recovery time, cardiovascular 
complications, stroke, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and mortality.  These e ndpoints are clinically relevant 
but do not necessarily reflect the overall state of recovery after anesthesia. Quality of Recovery 
(QoR),  first developed in 2000 by [CONTACT_727188]., is a psychometric has become an important clinical 
outcome in anesthesia res earch because it describes the global quality of life from the patients’ 
perspective after surgery and anesthesia.  It indicates the impact of adverse events on such as pain 
and immobility on the patient’s recovery and also indirectly reflects quality of h ealth care.  The 
original quality of recovery 9 (QoR ‐9) score was later evolved into a more extensive QoR -[ADDRESS_992850] recent validated version is a 15 -item QoR scale 
as discussed by [CONTACT_727189]. al. [32] It incorporates five dimensions of health, including patient support, 
comfort, emotions, physical independence, and pain, and has been proven useful in multiple setting 
and languages. Quality of recovery will undoubtedly have influenc e patients’ satisfaction of their 
care, which in the current economic constraints of the healthcare system, and the fact that Centers 
of Medicare & Medicaid Services are linking hospi[INVESTIGATOR_727130]’s 
satisfaction, quality of recovery ha s real financial implications. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_83269], although an 
indispensable part of postoperative pain management, is often needed to satisfy the high 
expectation of pain relief of patients. Overuse of opi[INVESTIGATOR_727131], 
(e.g. nausea and vomiting, delay return of bowel function, sleep disturbance, pruritus)  which has 
negative impact on quality of recovery.  
B. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related side effects - composite  
In addition to urinary retention and postoperative ileus, other common side effects 
associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_727132]/vomiting, pruritus, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]. Postoperative 
nausea and vomiting (PONV)  affects about 20-70% of postoperative patients and are highly 
distressing to patients. It is mainly mediated by [CONTACT_727190][INVESTIGATOR_2480] -receptors in chemoreceptor 
trigger zone of the medulla.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_727133] a potential h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_727134]. It has been shown 
in study that PONV has an impact on quality of recovery. In patients’ perspective, PONV is one 
the most undesirable outcomes in the recovery period. In fact, in one survey, patien ts were willing 
to pay out of their own expense to rid of nausea and vomiting completely. Another common side 
effect of opi[INVESTIGATOR_727135], affecting up to 50% patient  receiving intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_727136]. The c urrent treatment of pruritus is with antihistamines, 
5-HT3-receptor antagonists, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] -antagonists, propofol, and droperidol , with variable success 
and with each associated with its side effects.  Physicians often respond by [CONTACT_727191], which leads to inadequate analgesia and patient discomfort. Another important 
side effect is opi[INVESTIGATOR_727137] [33]. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_727138], causing significant hypoxemia  and potential harm [34].  
[ADDRESS_992851] long been recognized as are  immune modulators compromising compromise both 
cellular and humoral immune function s.[35-37] The exact mechanism of this immune modulation 
is unclear but opi[INVESTIGATOR_727139] -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal axis 
and peripherally on the immune cells directly. [38] Opi[INVESTIGATOR_727140] 3 major types of receptors: mu -
, delta -, and kappa -opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328], which are all identified among immune cel ls, such as PMNs, 
macrophages, T -lymphocytes, splenocytes, and macrophages. [39] Opi[INVESTIGATOR_727141] a nd impair macrophage function including chemo taxis and 
phagocytosis. [40-42] And finally, opi[INVESTIGATOR_727142] B -cell proliferation and antibody production. [43]  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -induced immunodysfunction  can potentially lead to surgical site infection. This , a 
theory is supported by [CONTACT_727192][INVESTIGATOR_727143]. [44] Breslow et al. compared the effect opi[INVESTIGATOR_727144]. Mu-receptor knockout  and 
wild-type mice were both pretreated with morphine and were inoculated with S almonel la and the 
knockout mi ce were resistant to infection, while the wild -type had 100 percent mortality. [45] 
Furthermore, there is evidence that increased doses of opi[INVESTIGATOR_727145]. [46] High -dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_727146] (SSI) after colorectal  surgery possibly secondary to 
immunosuppression. [47] It is plausible to assume that high dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_727147].  
Duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or length of stay, is an important indicator of quality of care 
and inefficiencies of heal thcare and has been used by [CONTACT_727193][INVESTIGATOR_600]. The importance of this parameter was demonstrated by [CONTACT_727194][INVESTIGATOR_307]. It was suggested that one major 
reason for prolonged duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_727148]. Prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_727149] d 
healthcare resources. In a study by [CONTACT_391174]. examining risk factors that contribute to prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] 23,919 adults undergoing major elective surgery, postoperative adverse events 
was associated with  a high risk of prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. [48] Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] -related side effects affect 
postoperative recovery and contribute to prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. For example, prolonged ileus has 
9 
 multiple consequences, including decreased patients’ comfort, del ay of mobilization, and 
pulmonary complications. For example, patient with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -induced ileus significantly  stay longer  
in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_727150]  (20 vs. 11 days, p<0.001 ). Another 
study of patients who underwent spi[INVESTIGATOR_727151] (3. 94 d vs. 2.34 d; P=0.005).  PONV, a considerable cause of discomfort, 
should not be taken lightly. PONV has been shown to pro long hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. In severe PONV, it 
has been documented to cause suture dehiscence and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], which will likely lead to additional 
treatment and extended hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. In summary,  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related side effects hinder  recovery 
and prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41836]. 
In summary, opi[INVESTIGATOR_727152]. They also delay discharge, increase the cost of care, and reduce patient satisfaction. We 
have a strong need for a peripheral opi[INVESTIGATOR_727153] a part of a multimodal approach 
to manage and possibly prevent opi[INVESTIGATOR_727154], 
effective, no effect on centrally mediated analgesia and favorable side effect profile .  
C. Naloxegol  
Peripheral opi[INVESTIGATOR_727155] s may prevent some opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -induced side effects. Naloxegol 
(marketed as Movantik, by [CONTACT_38227]) is a pegylated (PEG) derivative of naloxone that inhibits 
µ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328]. The PEG moiety offers several functions including reduced permeability an d 
increased efflux (substrate for P -glycoprotein transporter) across the blood brain barrier making it 
a mainly peripherally acting µ -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2634]. At recommended doses, its ability to 
only act peripherally allows it to reverse  peripheral  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related side effects without interfering 
with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related analgesia or causing withdrawal, as seen with naloxone . The PEG moiety also 
increases oral bioavailability and allowing oral administration. Naloxegol was approved in 2014 
by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Foo d and Drug Administration after it passed phase III trials for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -induced 
constipation in adults with chronic non -cancer pain.  
Naloxegol binds to all three opi[INVESTIGATOR_727156] µ - and K -receptors, 
the former (µ) being the main re ceptor implicated in its side effects related to the gut and bladder. 
The recommended dosage for adults is 12.5 mg to 25 mg daily . After intake orally, it is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_24588], reaching maximum concentration (C -max) in [ADDRESS_992852] peak. Its absorption is increased by a fatty meal.  Its volume of distribution at 
the terminal phase is 968-2,140 L  and it has low plasma binding (~4.2%)  in humans. Clearance is 
mainly by [CONTACT_727195] (P450 -CYP3A) with metab olites whose actions are yet to be 
defined. A small portion of naloxegol is elimination by [CONTACT_13624].  The half -life of naloxegol 
is 6-[ADDRESS_992853] 
concentrations of drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_36918].  Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 ( e.g. 
ketoconazole, verapamil, cimet idine) might increase Naloxegol concentration, and might need 
dose adjustment. Naloxeg ol does not appear to affect the efficacy of other opi[INVESTIGATOR_727157]. In a clinical study of healthy volunteers receiving morphine (5 mg/70 kg), 
naloxegol has no effect on the pharmacokinetics and metabolic profile of morphine. [49] 
Naloxegol is a well -tolerated drug for long -term use (up to 52 weeks ) based on clinical 
trials. [50] The incidence of adverse events ranges from 8 -19% and is dose -related. [51] Most 
adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity and mostly gastrointestinal related including 
abdominal pain, diarrhea , with a minority experiencing headache  and hyperhidrosis. [51] The 
cardiovascular safety for naloxegol was extensively studied during phase III trials. AstraZ eneca 
organized an independent committee, called Cardiovascular Event Adjudication Committee (CV -
EAC) to authenticate major adverse events including MACE (CV death, MI, stroke). Naloxegol 
was not associated with increased CV risk. The incidence of MACE was  0.6% for placebo versus 
0.4% for naloxegol and the incidence of MI was 0.3% for placebo versus 0.2% for naloxegol. [52] 
Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of naloxegol including relief of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related side effects while without affecting increasing pain score and daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533]. 
Two identical phase III, randomized, multi -centered, double blinded studies (KODIAC -04 and 
KODIAC -05) investigated the efficacy of 12.5 mg/day and 25 m g/day naloxegol versus placebo 
in adults patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -induced constipation over a 12 week treatment period. [51] Naloxegol 
was associated with a significant improvement in bowel function with 25 mg/day and was more 
effective than 12.5 mg/day. Furthermore, naloxegol did not alter pain scores, daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_16443], or the incidence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -withdrawal across all  control and treatment groups. [51] 
11 
 These findings prove naloxegol’s utility as a peripheral opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] a ntagonist in decreasing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]’s 
side effects while maintaining analgesia.  
D. Rational e of the study  
Previous clinical evidence has already demonstrated naloxegol’s efficacy and safety in the 
treatment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -induced constipation in the outpatient setting.  To our knowledge, there have 
been no clinical studies that investigated its potential in the perioperative  setting. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_727158], prolonged ileus, which translates to potential 
prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70213] y and costs. The aim of this study is to test if the novel peripheral opi[INVESTIGATOR_727159] -related side effects and 
reducing duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_727160].  
  
[ADDRESS_992854] the following aims:  
 
A. Primary Aim  
To assess whether patients who received Naloxegol  have a lower volume of residual urine 
in bladder.  
Hypothesis : Our primary hypothesis is that patients who received Naloxegol [ADDRESS_992855] shown good correlation between the volumes measured by [CONTACT_727196].  
 
B. Secondary  Aims  
Secondary Aim 1:  
To evaluate  the effect of  Naloxegol on  other  opi[INVESTIGATOR_27277].  
Hypothesis . Patients in Naloxegol group have fewer opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related side effects than control 
group. We will use a validated composite outcome, Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] –Related Symptom Distress Scale 
(ORSDS), to evaluate opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related side effect. ORSDS is 4 -point scale that evaluates 3 
symptom distress dimensions (frequency, severity, bothersomeness) for 12  opi[INVESTIGATOR_727161] 
13 
 effects [53]. ORSDS questionnaire will be administered by a trained research fellow on first, 
second, and third postoperative mornings while patients remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
Secondary Aim 2: 
To assess whether Naloxegol is associated with lower need for indwelling urinary 
catheterization.  
Hypothesis : Our hypothesis is that patients who received Naloxegol [ADDRESS_992856] less need of indwelling catheterization determined by [CONTACT_727197] 400 ml  when compared to placebo.  
 
Secondary Aim 3 : 
To assess whether Naloxegol is  associated with improved quality of recovery, as measured by 
[CONTACT_941] 15 -item Quality of Recovery scale.  
Hypothesis : Our hypothesis is that patients who received Naloxegol [ADDRESS_992857] improved quality of recovery.  Qualit y of recovery in the 
postoperative period is an important measure of the early postoperative health status of patients, 
and the 15-item Quality of Recovery scale is a validated and efficient measure [32]. Patients will 
be questioned on the morning of postoperative day ( POD ) 2 or day of discharge (whichever 
comes earlier) . 
 
C. Exploratory  Aims  
Exploratory Aim 1:  
To assess patient satisfaction with the quality of recovery.  
Hypothesis:  Our hypothesis is that patients who received Naloxegol [ADDRESS_992858] improved satisfaction with the quality of recovery, as measured on 
a subjective 100 -point scale (where 0 means not satisfied at all and 100 means co mpletely 
satisfied).  
Exploratory Aim 2:  
To assess the effect of Naloxegol on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203484].  
Hypothesis.  Patients in control group will have prolonged length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_727162] t o opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related adverse events.

Patients must meet  all inclusion and exclusion criteria to be eligible for the study. After 
eligibility is confirmed, patients will receive complete information about the study both verbally 
and in writing. Informed consent must be obtained from the patients prior to random ization and 
study -specific procedures.  
Anesthetic management will follow pre -established clinical and institutional guidelines. 
Patients can be pre -medicated and will receive spi[INVESTIGATOR_727167]. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_727168], and will occur after the electrocardiogram and monitoring 
equipment are placed on the patient. Prophylactic antibiotics will be given per surgical rou tine. 
During the induction of general anesthesia, i ndwelling  urinary catheters will be inserted only in 
17 
 the patients with operation time exceeding 3 h or who required meticulous  monitoring of the 
intraoperative fluid status. Intraoperative and postoperativ e fluid management will be left to 
discretion of the clinicians, who will be administrating them using institution standards.   
Randomization (1:1)  will be web -based and initiated prior to conclusion of surgery; 
allocation will thus be concealed from investigators.  Randomization will be stratified  based on 
chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (if present)  to ensure balance between treatment groups within chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_727169] . Chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_727170] [ADDRESS_992860] morning of surgery and 
continued for tw o postoperative days or until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (whichever occurs first) with 25 
mg (or equivalent size and shape of Placebo). The post -operative study drug doses will be given 
in the morning [ADDRESS_992861]. The need for straight cathet erization in PACU 
and/or on the floor when it is medically indicated (volumes exceeding 400 ml) will be recorded by 
[CONTACT_727199]. Postoperatively, all patients 
will be given intravenous or oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_727171].  Clinicians will adjust analgesic 
management as necessary in an effort to adjust verbal response pain scores to less than 4.  
Clinical evaluators for the outcomes will be blinded to group allocation and Pharmacy 
personnel not involved in  evaluations will prepare the study drugs. Clinicians including nurses will 
be blinded to monitoring and will be required to perform their standard of care management after 
surgery.  
 
Enrollment procedures  
The following events will occur in order:  
1. Screening for eligible patients  
2. Informed consent  
3. Randomization  
[ADDRESS_992862] group 
will be recorded and judged as an unanticipated problem or protocol deviat ion at the discretion of 
the principal investigator.  
 
F. Measurements  
 
Data will be recorded on a case report form (CRF) which will be available electronically and on 
paper format.  
Demographic data to be obtained includes height (cm), weight (kg), age (yr), gender, physical 
status (ASA), and self -declared ethnicity. Patients will be questioned for social history (tobacco) 
and medical history (pulmonary disease, kidney disease, diabete s mellitus, neurological disease, 
chronic pain conditions, illegal drug usage, alcohol abuse, myocardial infarction, previous surgery 
or stent placement and medications usage). Available preoperative laboratory tests and medication 
list will be recorded. I ndividual risk for nausea and vomiting will be determined using the Apfel 
score.   
 
Data obtained from electronic medical records will include: operation time, surgery type, 
intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_354987], 
[ADDRESS_992863] s. Patient functionality will also be recorded including 
bathing, toileting, walking and moving.  
 
The Residual volume will be measured within 30 minutes after urination using the battery -
powered, portable Bladder scan™ BVI 3000® ( Verathon, Bothell, WA, [LOCATION_003] ). The scanner will 
be placed on the suprapubic area and held stationary during measurement scanning. The diameter 
of the bladder and volume of urine will be calculated from the scan data. Scans will be repeated 
several times to ensure accuracy in measurem ents. The average of the measurements at each 
measurement time will be analyzed. All clinical procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_727200].  Surgical team will be blinded to volume determined by 
[CONTACT_727201].  
 
We will use Myles QoR scale to formally evaluate quality of recovery on  2 or day of discharge 
(whichever comes earlier) . Myles QoR scale is a validated scoring system allows quantification of 
patient’s early postoperative health status, which is also a description of quality of recovery [32]  
 
ORSDS is 4 -point scale that evaluates 3 symptom distress dimensions ( frequency, severity, 
bothersomeness  for 12 opi[INVESTIGATOR_27277] [53]. ORSDS questionnaire will be administered 
by a trained research fellow on first and second  postoperative  days/day of discharge (whichever 
comes earlier)    
 
Patient satisfaction with their recovery will be questioned before discharge using a 0 -100 scale 
(where 0 indicates no satisfaction and 100 indicates complete satisfaction).  
 
Adverse events and serious adverse events occurring at any time during the study  period will be 
recorded on a specific form in the CRF.  
[ADDRESS_992864] descriptive statistics (i.e., mean ± standard deviation, median [Q1, 
Q3], or  N (%) as appropriate) and standardized difference. The standardized difference is the 
difference in means or proportions divided by [CONTACT_103884]. Any covariable  with 
a standardized difference greater than 0.[ADDRESS_992865] lower volume of residual urine in bladder when compared 
to placebo. We will compare the randomized groups on the volume of residual urine in bladder, 
which will be measured twice per day for  up to  3 days  (i.e., a m aximum of 6 measurement times 
in total) , using a linear mixed model adjusting for the within -subject correlation (using an 
autoregressive correlation structure ). At each measurement time, the average of the measurements 
will be analyzed. Any imbalanced baseline characteristics and volume of residual urine in bladder 
prior to the procedure will be included as covariates  in the model. If the group -by-time interaction 
is non -significant (P > 0.20), we will assess the group difference on the v olume of residual urine 
across over all the measurements. In the presence of a group -by-time interaction, the group 
difference will be assessed separately at each measurement time and a Bonferroni correction will 
be made for multiple comparisons to maintai n the hypothesis -wise 2-sided  type I error at 0.05  (the 
significance criterion will be 0.05 / 6).  
Second , we will assess the treatment effect within chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_727172]. The significance level will  be 0.025  for each of the two 
subgroup analyses (Bonferroni correction).  
 
Secondary and exploratory analysis . 
[ADDRESS_992866] the following three secondary hypotheses: subjects who received Naloxegol 
[ADDRESS_992867] ( 1) fewer opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related side  effects , (2) less 
need of indwelling catheterization determined by [CONTACT_727202] 400 ml, and (3) 
improved quality of recovery as compared to placebo.  
The two groups will be compared on the incidence of any opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related side effects using 
a logistic regression.  The frequency, severity, and bothersomeness for each of the 12 opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -
related side effects on POD 1 and 2  will be summarized.  We will compare  the two groups on 
incidence (any versus none) of need for indwelling urinary catheterization (defined as residual 
urine volume > 400 ml) using logistic regression. The two groups will also be compared on the 
Quality of Recovery scale measured on POD  2 (or day of discharge if it occurs earlier) using a 
linear mixed model with an autoregressive correlation structure. All the analyses will be adjusted 
for imbalanced baseline characteristics , if any. The hypothesis -wise 2 -sided type I error for each 
of the sec ondary outcome will be  controlled at  0.017 (i.e., 0.05/3, Bonferroni correction).   
In addition, we will summarize the following exploratory outcomes, including satisfactory 
of the quality of recovery (a subjective 100 -point scale) and l ength  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] s tay after surgery.   
 
H. Sample Size Considerations  
The sample size consideration was based on the test for the primary hypothesis that patients 
who received Naloxegol [ADDRESS_992868] lower volume of 
residual urine in bladder when compared to placebo. We would need 62 patients per group [56] to 
have 90% power at a 2-sided alpha level  of 0.[ADDRESS_992869] 
size estimation of 0.4 was very conser vative as compared to the mean difference of 120 ml (SD: 
approximate 60 ml) in the volume of residual urine observed by [CONTACT_727203], I. T., et al  [57]. The 
effect size is the difference in means of the two randomized groups divided by [CONTACT_24703].  A maximum of six measurements are planned, twice per day for 3  days. However, we 
assumed 4 measurements per patients with a correlation of 0.3 to be conservative for the sample 
size calculation. Considering a loss of follow -up rate of 10%, we wil l need 12 more patients to 
reach the planned power with an end sample size of 136. A blinded data quality check will be 
conducted at 50% (68 patients) of the planned enrollment of [ADDRESS_992870] feasibility of recruitment, protocol adherence, 
randomization process, and data collection .  
22 
 SAS software version 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) will be used for all 
statistical analyses and graphics.  
 
 
I. Blinding and unblinding  
Study drug will be prepared by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_727173] “Naloxegol 25 mg or 
Placebo”. Placebo will have an identical shape and color. Blinding will be maintained unless 
unblinding is  requested for an adverse event or any other reason  as deemed necessary.  
If clinically indicated, an investigator can request unblinding for a specific dose from the Pharmacy 
personnel. Such an event will be reported and documented. Unblinding can also be requested by 
[CONTACT_727204].  
 
J. Treatment compliance  
Subjects  will be given clear instructions on medication doses and research -related follow -up prior 
to enrollment. A member of the study team  will follow each patient for the duration of the 
intervention in order to ensure compliance  with the protocol. Any deviations will be reported on 
the case report form and communicated as necessary.  
If the need arises to discontinue  the investigational product, the investigator will inform Pharmacy 
personnel to halt any further drug dispensing. The team will also communicate with the primary 
care nursing staff to return any unused investigational drug to the pharmacy for proper dispo sal. 
 
4. Safety monitoring  and reporting  
Definition of adverse events  
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of 
a pre -existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, 
whether or not considered causally related  to the product.  An undesi rable medical condition can 
be symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal 
23 
 results of an investigation (eg, laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).   In clinical studies, an AE 
can include an undesirable medic al condition occurring at any time, including run -in or washout 
periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.  
The term AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs.  
Adverse events of particular interest  are: 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351]: hyperh idrosis, chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anxiety, irritability  
Severe abdominal pain (>8/10) and/or diarrhea  
Gastrointestinal perforation  
 
Definitions of serious adverse event  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase that fulfill s one or more of 
the following criteria:  
Results in death  
Is immediately life -threatening  
Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_727174]/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
The causality of SAE s (their relationship to all study treatment/procedures) will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_093](s) and communicated to [COMPANY_008].  
 
Causality assessment  
The Investigator will assess causal relationship between Investigational Product and each 
Adverse Event,  and answer ‘ yes’ or ‘no’  to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?’  
24 
 For SAEs a causal relationship will also be assessed for other concomitant medications, s tudy 
procedures, and comparator study drugs.  Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any 
study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’.  
 
Time period for collection of adverse events  
Patients enrolled in the study will be followed until discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Adverse events 
occurring during this period will be recorded and communicated to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16298]. Any events deemed serious  by [CONTACT_727205] 10 days of discovering the event.  
 
Follow -up of unresolved adverse events  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_727175] h the IRB and Astra Zeneca accordingly.  
The following variables will be collected for each AE:  
AE (verbatim)  
The date when the AE started and stopped  
Whether the AE is serious or not  
Investigator causality rating against the Investigational Product (yes or  no) 
Action taken with regard to investigational product  
AE caused subject’s withdrawal from study (yes or no)  
Outcome of AE(s)  
In addition to the AE variables referenced above, the following variables will be collected for 
SAEs:  
Date AE met seriousness cr iteria  
Date Investigator became aware of serious AE  
AE is serious due to which criterion  
If hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]:  
Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
25 
 Date of discharge  
If death:  
Probable cause of death  
Date of death  
Autopsy performed (Ye s/no) and conclusion of cause of death from autopsy  
Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s)  
Causality assessment in relation to Other medication  
 
Description of AE(s)  
An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For  example, nausea that 
persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE. On the other hand, a 
stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability  may be considered a mild stroke but 
would be a SAE.  
 
Adverse Events based on signs and symptoms  
When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list 
of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms 
that are not generally part of the diagnosis,  the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be 
recorded separately.  
 
Adverse Events based on examinations and tests  
Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol -mandated laboratory values and/or vital signs 
should only be reported as AEs if they fulf ill any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for 
discontinuation of treatment with the investigational product.  
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE  and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will 
be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the 
clinical, rather than the laboratory term  (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value). In the 
absence of clin ical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -mandated 
parameters should be reported as AE(s).  
26 
 Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE/SAE.  
Any new or aggra vated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as 
compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.  
 
Disease progression  
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a subject’s condition attributable  to the 
disease for which the investigational product is being studied.  It may be an increase in the 
severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. Events, 
which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should no t be reported as an AE during the 
study.  
 
Overdose  
Overdose in itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE.   
Investigator/site staff are responsible for recording and reporting overdose in accordance with the 
clinical study protocol instructions. All over doses with [COMPANY_008] product are collected and 
reported to [COMPANY_008].  Overdoses associated with SAEs will be reported according to SAE 
reporting.  All other overdoses can be sent to [COMPANY_008] on a monthly basis.  
The following information should be provided in the event of an Overdose ( Overdose Report 
Form can be provided upon request) :  
Details of the Patient who was dispensed study medication (Randomization code)  
Details of the Patient who took the overdose (demographic information, was patient a s tudy 
participant?)  
Details of the drug overdose (total daily dose, route, formulation, Overdose start and stop dates)  
Was the overdose accidental or intentional?   
Was the overdose associated with an adverse event ( serious or non -serious ) 
Provide an Adverse  Event description (use same wording as in CRF). Provide start and stop 
dates of the event, or indicate if the event is ongoing.  
Provide Investigator’s signature [CONTACT_3670].  
 
27 
 Pregnancy  
Pregnancy in itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE. However, if the  subjects become 
pregnant during the study, Investigator/site staff are responsible for recording and reporting 
pregnancies and their pregnancy outcomes until pregnancy resolution in accordance with the 
clinical study protocol instructions.  
If a patient be comes pregnant during the course of the study the study medication should be 
discontinued immediately . The investigator must inform [COMPANY_008] of any pregnancies 
occurring in a female patient or a female partner of a male patient within [ADDRESS_992871] (that is, those with or without associated 
SAE, AE or no symptoms) are collected and reported to [COMPANY_008].  If the pregnancy is 
accompanied by [CONTACT_727206] (e.g. events of c ongenital  abnormality/birth defect, spontaneous 
miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, or any complications in the subject which meet the criteria for 
a serious adverse event), it should be reported according to the SAE reporting requirement.   All 
other maternal exposure reports can be sent to [COMPANY_008] on a monthly basis.  
Normal births and elective abortions without complications are not considered to be SAEs.  
 
Paternal exposure  
If paternal exposure pregnancy occurs in the course of the st udy, then the Sponsor/Investigators 
should inform [COMPANY_008] within the same timeframe as the maternal exposure.  The female 
partner of the patient will be asked to consent to allow collection of information and follow -up 
on the pregnancy.  The outcome of  the pregnancy is also followed and reported in accordance 
with the processes written in maternal exposure section.  
 
Reporting of serious adverse events  
Investigators and other site personnel must inform the FDA, via a MedWatch/AdEERs  form, of 
any serious  or unexpected adverse events that occur in accordance with the reporting obligations 
of [ADDRESS_992872] all such reports to AZ.  A copy of the 
MedWatch/AdEERs report must be faxed or email to [COMPANY_008] at the time the event is 
reported to the FDA.  It is the responsibility of the investigator to compi[INVESTIGATOR_8267] a report according to the FDA reporting 
28 
 requirement timelines and to ensure that these reports are also submitted to  [COMPANY_008] at the 
same time.  
When reporting to [COMPANY_008], a cover page should accompany the MedWatch/AdEERs form 
indicating the following:  
Investigator Sponsored Study (ISS)  
The investigator IND number assigned by [CONTACT_119008]’s name [CONTACT_727210]/title and [COMPANY_008] ISS reference number  
Investigative site must also indicate, either in the SAE report or the cover page, the causality of 
events in relation to all study medications and if the SAE is related to disease progression , as 
determined by [CONTACT_458].  
Send SAE report and accompanying cover page to [COMPANY_008] by [CONTACT_727207] (TCS) <[EMAIL_661]> or by [CONTACT_12100] 1 -[PHONE_3354] (US 
Fax number). Email is the pref erred method.  
Serious adverse events that do not require expedited reporting to the FDA need to be reported to 
[COMPANY_008] preferably using the MedDRA  coding language for se rious adverse events on a 
monthly basis .  
In the case of blinded trials, AstraZenec a will request that the Sponsor either provide a copy of 
the randomization code/ code break information or unblind those SAEs which require expedited 
reporting.  
All SAEs have to be reported to [COMPANY_008], whether or not considered causally related to the 
investigational product.  All SAEs will be documented in the study database.  The investigator is 
responsible for informing the IRB and/or the Regulatory Authority of the SAE as per local 
requirements.  
 
5. Ethical and regulatory requirements  
A regulatory binder will be kept at the Department of Outcomes Research including the following:  
 Delegation log: names and responsibilities of all study team members  
 Copy of the most recent study protocol  
 Copy of the most recent consent form  
29 
  Copy of the most recent case report form  
 Copi[INVESTIGATOR_727176], sponsor, DSMB, pharmacy, or other 
entities  
 Audit reports  
The study site pharmacy will be responsible for the storage and control of study drug and placebo 
doses. Adequate records of recei pt and dispensing of study drug will be kept and will be available 
for inspection if required. Any expi[INVESTIGATOR_727177].  
An independent data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) will be formed and wi ll consist of at 
least 2 anesthesiologists and 1 statistician not included in the study team. The DSMB will review 
study data at the time of the blinded data quality check  (Section H)  and as required throughout the 
study. The DSMB can request unblinding of  study data and has the authority to terminate the study 
if significant harm to study patients is suspected.  
The study will be conducted preserving the privacy and rights of all patients to the best of the study 
team’s ability. Protected health information  will not be shared outside of the entities described in 
the consent form. All study -related information will be kept at the Department of Outcomes 
Research in compliance of existing rules.  
 
6. Study Drug handling  
Identity of investigational product(s)  
Naloxegol 25mg tablets and matching placebo will be used in the study.  This material will be 
supplied by [CONTACT_727208] 18 tablets per bottle.   Labels will 
be prepared at the study site according to Good Manufacturing Pra ctice (GMP) and local 
regulatory guidelines. Labels will fulfill GMP Annex [ADDRESS_992873] be stored at controlled r oom temperature between 20 -25°C (68 -77°F).  Storage

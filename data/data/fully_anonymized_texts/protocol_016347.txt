1. Objectives 1.1. Purpose, specific aims, or objectives:  Purpose: Conduct a cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of a newly designed model of Well-Child Care (WCC) (Phase 2) Specific aims: Aim 1: Measure the effect of PARENT on the receipt of nationally-recommended WCC services and parent experiences of care. Aim 2: Determine the effects of PARENT on WCC, urgent care, and ED utilization, and on net costs. Aim 3: Examine the effect of PARENT on clinician time allocation for WCC and urgent care visits. Aim 4: Assess the effect of PARENT on parent-focused outcomes in an exploratory analysis.      1.2. Hypotheses to be tested:    H1: PARENT will improve receipt of WCC services and parent experiences of care  H2a: PARENT will result in improved up-to-date rates for WCC visits and reduced ED utilization    H2b: In a cost/cost-offset analysis, we will demonstrate that direct intervention costs of PARENT are offset by [CONTACT_47225].   H3: Clinicians will shift time from providing routine WCC services in well-visits to chronic disease management and urgent care.   H4: PARENT will result in improved parental mental health parenting self-efficacy, and positive behaviors.     2. Background 2.1. Relevant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge:    Well-Child Care (WCC) visits for child preventive care during the first three years of life are critical because they may be the only opportunity before a child reaches preschool to identify and address important social, developmental, behavioral, and health issues that could have significant impact and long-lasting effects on children’s lives as adults. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_47212], multiple studies have demonstrated that pediatric providers fail to provide all recommended preventive and developmental services at these visits and that most parents leave the visit with unaddressed psychosocial, developmental, and behavioral concerns. Further, these missed opportunities are more pronounced for children in low-income families.  A critical problem is that the structure of WCC in the U.S. cannot support the vast array of WCC needs of families. Key structural problems include (a) reliance on clinicians (pediatricians, family physicians, or nurse practitioners) for basic, routine WCC services, (b) limitation to a 15-minute face-to-face clinician-directed WCC visit for the wide array of education and guidance services in WCC, and (c) lack of a systematic, patient-driven method for visit customization to meet families’ needs. These structural problems contribute to the wide variations in processes of care and preventive care outcomes, resulting in poorer quality of WCC and perhaps worse health outcomes, particularly for children in low-income communities.

To address the gaps in current WCC this study introduces a new model of care to meet the needs of children in low-income communities: Parent-focused Redesign for Encounters, Newborns to Toddlers (PARENT). PARENT is a team-based approach to care using a health educator ("Parent Coach") to provide the bulk of WCC services, address specific needs faced by [CONTACT_47226]-income communities, and decrease reliance on the clinician as the primary provider of WCC services. The Parent Coach provides anticipatory guidance, psychosocial screening/referral, and developmental and behavioral surveillance, screening, and guidance at each WCC visit, and is supported by [CONTACT_7078]-focused pre-visit screening and visit prioritization, a brief, problem-focused clinician encounter for a physical exam and any concerns that require a clinician's attention, and an automated text message parent reminder and education service for periodic, age-specific messages to reinforce key health-related information recommended by [CONTACT_47227].  To assess the efficacy off PARENT we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). The study will be conducted in partnership with 10 clinics.  There are 2 major phases to this study. In Phase 1 (IRB ID: STUDY00000413), we used a Community Engagement & Intervention Implementation process that has been successful in previous studies to guide the intervention adaptation process, Parent Coach training, practice workflow, and intervention implementation in the practices. In Phase 2 (this protocol), we will conduct a cluster RCT of PARENT to determine its effects on quality, utilization, and clinician efficiency, and its cost/cost-offset. Our community partners include two federally-qualified health centers (FQHC). FQHC #1 has 4 clinics participating in the study and FQHC #2 has 6 clinics participating in the study. The total number of clinics participating in the study is 10 clinics randomized at the clinic level to intervention or control condition. The intervention clinics will implement PARENT for all well-visits through age 2 years at their clinical site, and the control clinics will continue usual care (clinician directed well-visit). 1,000 families will be enrolled at infant age ≤[ADDRESS_49693] enrollment.      2.2.

Block FQHC #2 Assignment 1 Canoga Park Van Nuys Control Intervention  2 Pacoima San Fernando Intervention Control  3 Santa Clarita Valencia  Intervention Control  The five clinics randomized to intervention will implement the newly adapted model of well child check-up visits for children ages 0-3. The five clinics randomized to control will continue to use the same services that the clinics provide--their usual check-up visit as their typi[INVESTIGATOR_47213]-led visit (well-visit time slots vary by [CONTACT_14603]).   Parent/legal guardians will receive the same services offered by [CONTACT_47230]’s health care whether they participate in this study or not.  Components of the newly designed model of  WCC:  The PARENT intervention was adapted during the Project Working Group meetings in partnership with the two FQHCs (Phase 1: IRB ID: STUDY00000413).   - Parent Coach at each visit. The Parent Coach is a Spanish/English-bilingual trained health educator hired by [CONTACT_47231]. The training consisted of self-directed learning based on Bright Futures Guidelines, Third Edition, relationship building with community organizations near each clinical site; mock visits; and pediatrician-observed visits with feedback at the practices. The Parent Coach will be available at the intervention clinics to serve as the primary provider of anticipatory guidance, psychosocial screening and referral, and developmental/behavioral guidance and screening at each check-up visit. They will talk to parents about any concerns parents might have about feeding, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], parenting, safety, or other issues. The parent coach will use an adapted version of the Bright Futures Previsit Questionnaire, Third Edition for each well-child care visit to guide the visits with the parent. They will document their visit in the child’s Electronic Health Record.   - Well Child Help Line. The Parent Coach will be available to answer parents’ preventive care-related questions, conduct parent follow-up calls and visit reminders during business hours. - HealthyText Messages. Parents will be offered the text messaging service at study enrollment and research staff will process the enrollment by [CONTACT_47232]’s cell phone #, child’s DOB and language preference (English/Spanish). The library of text messages (English and Spanish) were adapted from Healthy-TXT, a text messaging service (Healthy-TXT, LLC, Chicago, IL), to the needs of the FQHCs. If parent choose to sign up, they will receive text messages each week focused on age-appropriate anticipatory guidance, health education, and reminders for WCC visits. Most messages include a link to an educational website (e.g., healthychildren.org) with a video or written information on that specific topic, or the message may include the clinic’s telephone number for visit scheduling, the parent coach number or other information (e.g., poison control hotline). At any time, parents will be able to text STOP to end the service.

       5.2. Research procedures:9    Intervention and Control clinics: Parents/legal guardians checking in for a WCC visit or a visit in between for an infant ≤12 months will be approached by [CONTACT_3647]. Research staff will obtain a schedule of WCC visit prior to visiting the clinic. The schedule will include date, type of WCC visit, language, MRN, and child’s age in weeks or months, parent name, parent phone number, and home address.    Parent/ legal guardians will be approached while waiting for their WCC visit or by [CONTACT_47233]-person.   Clinic flyer procedure:  Clinics will have flyers on display about the study as a method for alerting parents to the possibility of being approached by [CONTACT_3647]. Parents may take a flyer from the clinic to initiate communication with study staff to determine eligibility, learn more about the study, review the information sheet, and give verbal consent.   Clinic recruitment procedure:  Research staff will let the clinic staff and front desk staff know when arriving and verify the schedule. The front desk staff will let parents/legal guardians know that someone is at the clinic to talk to them about the research study. If parent/legal guardian agrees to be approached, the front desk staff will let the research staff know.   Research staff will explain the study, screen for eligibility (they will be asked some questions), provide the parental permission and consent form, and obtain consent. When possible, parents/legal guardians will be given the opportunity to discuss the study in a private room.   Research staff will conduct the baseline survey after screening and obtaining consent while parent/legal guardian is waiting for their WCC visit in the waiting area. We will assign IDs to all screened parents/legal guardians but will conduct the survey only with those wanting to participate and if they are eligible. If the survey is not completed during the waiting room time period, we will ask parent/legal guardian if it is possible to complete the survey at the end of their WCC visit or by [CONTACT_47234] 14 days from date of enrollment.     Phone call recruitment procedure:  When research staff are limited from recruitment on-site, clinic sites will be informed of pre-screened visits that are anticipated to be eligible for enrollment.    CHC and NEVHC sites:  1. Clinic Staff approach in-person: When clinic staff are available in-person to communicate with the parent/legal guardian of a pre-screened patient (pre-screened by [CONTACT_5051]), the clinic staff will give a physical copy of the information sheet, and will ask if the research team can call the parent/legal guardian to explain the study, screen for eligibility, review the information sheet, and obtain verbal consent. Parents/legal guardians will have the option to decline a call from the research team by [CONTACT_47235]: Tumaini R. Coker    Protocol Version Number: 1     Protocol Version Date: 1/14/2021

contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. Clinic staff will communicate with the research team to let them know which families were approached by [CONTACT_47236] a call from the research team.    2. Clinic staff approach over the phone: When clinic staff conduct pre-visit calls by [CONTACT_47237] a parent/legal guardian, the clinic staff will communicate with the parent/legal guardian of a pre-screened patient (pre-screened by [CONTACT_5051]) to inform them of the study. The clinic staff will ask if the research team can call the parent/legal guardian to explain the study, send the parent an information sheet, screen for eligibility, review the information sheet, and obtain verbal consent. Parent/legal guardians will have the option to decline a call from the research team by [CONTACT_47238]. Clinic staff will communicate with the research team to let them know which families were approached by [CONTACT_47236] a call from the research team.    Additional recruitment method for CHC patients:  1. Parent/legal guardians of a pre-screened patient (pre-screened by [CONTACT_5051]) will be mailed an (i) opt-out letter co-signed by [CONTACT_47239]’s medical director and Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_47214] (ii) information sheet. Parent/legal guardians will have the option to decline a call from research staff by [CONTACT_47240], call, or text. Research staff will call to explain the study, screen for eligibility, review the information sheet, and obtain verbal consent.    Additional recruitment procedure details:  For those approached by [CONTACT_648], study staff who have access to the clinic WCC visit schedule and that have received training to use the clinic’s EHR will document the consent process by [CONTACT_47241].   We will collect information on the number of people approached, the number of people who agreed to participate and the number of people who refused to participate and the reasons for their refusal.   We will collect contact [CONTACT_47242]/legal guardian and spouse/partner (home and cell phone, email) to telephone them to complete the baseline survey, if needed. The information will be verified at each subsequent contact [CONTACT_47243] 6-month and 12-months from date of enrollment. We will also ask parents to provide contact [CONTACT_47244]/friends who will always know their whereabouts. Because this study population frequently changes phone numbers, we will also ask participants to provide any social media handles, if they are willing, so that the study team can direct message them. Direct messaging will be utilized to get updated phone numbers or schedule a phone conversation and no other purposes. Additionally, to support retention we will contact [CONTACT_47245] 3- and 9-month time points to remind them of their study participation as well as confirm their contact [CONTACT_1343]. Furthermore, we will send participating families a card for their baby’s first birthday and for New Years from the research team to encourage engagement, remind them of their participation, and support follow-up survey retention.    The research staff will ask parents/legal guardians questions about their experiences in getting care so that we can compare the two types of well-child care.  We will conduct three waves of survey data (baseline, 6-month and 12-month) collection and chart review at the end:  • Baseline Survey (at enrollment): Experienced research staff will be responsible for data collection. Upon enrollment, parents will participate in a 35-minute survey to collect baseline demographic data on the infant, parent, and household and child’s medical history.  
Principal Researcher: Tumaini R. Coker    Protocol Version Number: 1     Protocol Version Date: 1/14/2021   
 Protocol Template (HRP-503) Click Template Version: October 2018   Page 9 of 28   
• 6-Month Survey (participant retention survey by [CONTACT_648]): Research staff will conduct a 15-minute phone survey at 6-months post-enrollment to aid in participant retention. The 6-month survey will update the child’s medical history, household changes, and healthcare utilization (e.g., ED utilization).  • 12-month Survey: At 12-months post-enrollment, all participants will be asked to complete a 40-minute survey by [CONTACT_648]. This survey administration will include the Promoting Healthy Development Survey (PHDS-PLUS), a parent survey that assesses the provision of nationally recommended WCC services. We will use the PHDS-PLUS to determine parent perceived receipt of recommended WCC services, appropriate follow-up, and health care utilization. Additional questions on social determinants screening and referral are included and drawn from the PHDS-PLUS as well as the National Survey of Early Childhood Health. We will also use items on overall satisfaction of care from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Health Plan Survey and family-centeredness of care from the National Survey of Children’s Health. Using previously validated parent survey tools, we will collect data on our exploratory measures of parental mental health, perceived parenting self-efficacy and parenting behaviors.  For the 6-month and [ADDRESS_49696] study participants two weeks before the due date. If we are unable to reach them by [CONTACT_47246], we will continue calling them up to three months after the due date to complete the survey. • Chart review: After completing the three waves of survey data collection, we will conduct chart review. The chart review includes clinic visits, ED visits, services received at those visits, immunizations, and status of referrals.      5.3. Data sources that will be used to collect data about subjects:10    Parent-report surveys and chart review from electronic medical records.

Potential benefits that individual subjects may experience from taking part in the research:[ADDRESS_49709] benefit to participating subjects.     14. Data Analysis/Management 14.1. Data analysis plan, including statistical procedures:    We will compi[INVESTIGATOR_47215], composite scores, and covariates. We will report means, medians, and standard deviations for continuous variables, create graphical displays to visualize distributions, and transform variables with non-normal distributions. Next, we will use multivariable analyses to examine differences between the control and intervention groups on the measures described above. From these analyses, we will estimate intervention effects. An intent-to-treat approach will be used, that is, parents will be analyzed according to the assigned group regardless of deviations from the study protocol. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_47251]. Missing values will be excluded from the analysis if the missing rate is low (< 10%). If the missing rate is more than 10%, data may also be imputed using multiple imputation techniques and the analysis can then be done based on the complete, imputed datasets. All tests are two-sided, and p values < 0.05 are considered statistically significant.        Specific Aim 1: We will analyze anticipatory guidance based on data collected at 12-months post enrollment. We will assess intervention effect on anticipatory guidance via linear mixed effects models that involve random effects to capture data clustering within clinic, given

 Protocol Template (HRP-503) Click Template Version: October [ADDRESS_49710] possible interaction effects between intervention and these covariates. All other outcome variables to measure experiences of care and receipt of other nationally-recommended WCC services are regarded as secondary. Each outcome will be analyzed using linear or generalized linear mixed effects models depending upon data distributions, with a similar setting as described above for anticipatory guidance.        Specific Aim 2a: Intervention effects on healthcare utilization (ER visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], urgent care visits, regional center/early intervention, maternal mental health, support groups (e.g., breastfeeding, parenting classes), dentist, case management/social services) will be assessed using generalized linear mixed effects models for binary or count data with a similar setup as outlined for Aim 1. The model will include random effects to capture data clustering within clinic and the primary independent variable is intervention status. The analysis will be adjusted for any baseline child, parent, or household characteristics that are significantly different between control and intervention groups. We will also test interaction effects between intervention and the covariates.        Specific Aim 2b: Cost/cost-offset Analysis. We will conduct our analysis from the perspectives of the “social planner”80 and of the payer (e.g., health plan or medical group), and consider intervention costs (direct and indirect) and cost offsets.   Specific Aim 4: We will utilize the same approach as described for Specific Aims 1 and 2a; i.e., linear or generalized linear mixed effects models, depending on the distribution of the outcome variables.    14.2. Quality control procedures for collected data:33    The study team member who collected the data will enter the data into the study database and another team member will be validating the data entered.    15.

Measures in place to protect the privacy or confidentiality of subjects:37    The study social media accounts will never “friend”, follow or engage in any way with participants’ social media pages. The only interaction or engagement will be via direct message. We will not search for individuals on social media and will only direct message those who provide us with permission to do so as well as their specific profile name. Additionally, the study social media accounts will not be public to avoid any possibility of public interactions that could reveal identities of potential participants to each other.     17.3. Types of communications that will be submitted to the IRB for review:[ADDRESS_49711] message script will be submitted for review. This script shows the communication will be limited to scheduling and that participants will be encouraged to call the study team to discuss details and/or ask questions.     17.4.

   On-site recruitment: Parents/legal guardians checking in for a newborn through [ADDRESS_49712] flyers on display about the study as an additional method for alerting parents to the possibility of being approach by [CONTACT_3647]. For those approached in clinic, study staff will explain the study, screen for eligibility, provide the consent form, and obtain consent. When possible, parents/legal guardians will be given the opportunity to discuss the study in a private room.   Off-site recruitment:  • Method 1: When research staff are limited from recruitment on-site: clinic sites will be informed of pre-screened visits that are anticipated to be eligible for enrollment. Clinic staff will be able to give parent/legal guardians a copy of the consent form/information sheet prior to research staff contact[CONTACT_3018]. Parent/legal guardians will have the option to decline a call from research staff. Study staff (who have access to the clinic WCC visit schedule and that have received training to use the clinic’s EHR) will call families to explain the study, screen for eligibility, and obtain verbal consent over the phone and document the consent process by [CONTACT_47241].   • Method 2: Under extenuating circumstances, such as the 2019- 2020 SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) for the Tacoma, Washington and Los Angeles, [LOCATION_004] sites: Clinic staff will ask parent/legal guardians, over the phone during appointment reminder calls, if the research team can contact [CONTACT_47252]. Due to the risks associated with COVID-19 transmission, clinic staff are limited in their ability to provide the study information sheet in-person. Parent/legal guardians will have the option to decline a call from research staff. Parent/legal guardians will only be contact[CONTACT_47253]. Under these specific circumstances, the research staff cannot rely on mailing an opt-out letter and information sheets prior to the patients scheduled visit. The research and clinic staff have no other possible alternative to communicating with participants without increasing the risk to parent/legal guardians and their infant children during this fast-evolving public health crisis.   • Method 3: To increase accrual rates at Community Health Care (Tacoma, WA) study sites: Study staff will mail an (i) opt-out letter and the study (ii) information sheet to families that have a clinic visit scheduled or due within a 1-month period for routine care. Parents who receive mail communication from the research team will not be added the pre-screened list that clinic staff inform of the study during their appointment reminder calls. Parent/legal guardians will have the option to decline a call from research staff by [CONTACT_47254], text, or email. Study staff will call participants about one week after mailings are sent and before the scheduled well-child care visit. The opt-out letter is co-signed by [CONTACT_47239]’s medical director and the study PI.     19.2.

Consent Waiver/Alteration Criteria justifications:59 [IP_ADDRESS]. The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects because:    This study involves minimal interactions with the parents/legal guardians of the children attending well-child care visits to complete the study surveys.  Chart review will also be conducted.  Appropriate confidentiality measures are in place.  [IP_ADDRESS]. The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights or welfare of the subjects because:60     While participants did not provide consent for their information to be used for another study, it is not precluded by [CONTACT_47259]. The study team conducting the COVID Survey Study are also on the current study, so information will not be shared with new individuals. Participants will be consented before their data (beyond recruitment information) is used for the COVID Survey Study.     [IP_ADDRESS]. The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration because:61     Only information necessary for recruitment is being released prior to consent. Without the information, the study team would not be able recruitment for the COVID Survey Study.      [IP_ADDRESS]. Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation:    Participants will provide consent for the COVID Survey Study prior to data beyond recruitment information being released.     20.10.3.

The research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration of authorization:    Due to COVID-[ADDRESS_49722] during periods of required social distancing an alteration of HIPAA authorization is necessary.  For recruitment purposes:  Parents bring their kids to the clinics for all types of reasons and since we are particularly interested in WCC visits and visits in between. Without the schedule of WCC visits, we would not be efficient with our time and resources trying figuring out who to talk to at the clinics.  COVID Survey Study: While participants did not provide authorization for their information to be used for another study, it is not precluded by [CONTACT_47259]. The study team conducting the COVID Survey Study are also on the current study, so information will not be shared with new individuals.

Some examples of endpoints are survival, improvements in quality of life, relief of symptoms, and disappearance of the tumor.   3 Include information on a drug or biologic in this section if: (1) the study specifies the use of an approved drug or biologic; (2) the study uses an unapproved drug or biologic; (3) the study uses a food or dietary supplement to diagnose, cure, treat, or mitigate a disease or condition; or (4) data regarding subjects will be submitted to or held for inspection by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA).  Only include information on a device in this section if: (1) the study evaluates the safety or effectiveness of a device; (2) the study uses a humanitarian use device (HUD) for research purposes; or (3) data regarding subjects will be submitted to or held for inspection by [CONTACT_1622].  Please note that mobile medical applications may meet the definition of a device – see FDA Guidance. 4 See the Investigator Manual HRP-103 for sponsor requirements for FDA-regulated research. 5 Explain what IND exemption category applies to the drug and why.  Note that a drug is not exempt from an IND unless all criteria for one category are met.  See “HRP-306: Drugs” for more information. 6 Explain what IDE exemption category applies to the device and why.  Note that a device is not exempt from an IDE unless all criteria for one category are met.  See “HRP-307: Devices” for more information. 7 Explain why the device is NOT a significant risk device.  A significant risk device means an investigational device that: (a) is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; (b) is purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; (c) is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or (d) otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.

 40 If this is a multicenter study and subjects will be recruited by [CONTACT_28585] (e.g., call centers, national advertisements) those methods should also be described here. 41 “Privacy interest” refers to a person’s desire to place limits on whom they interact or whom they provide personal information. 42 For example: medical records, CIS, clinical databases, other study records. If the study will access PHI for recruitment purposes without prior authorization from subjects, please address this in the HIPAA Authorization section below. 43 Attach copi[INVESTIGATOR_47221]. For printed advertisements, attach the final copy. For online advertisements, attach the final screen shots (including any images).  When advertisements are taped for broadcast, send the final audio/video tape to [EMAIL_875].

See HRP-091 for requirements for Short Form consent form use. 48 Seattle Children’s IRB prohibits the exclusion of non-English speaking populations from research unless there is sufficient justification for the exclusion.  See Investigator Manual HRP-103 for more information.   49 For research conducted in the state, review “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians (HRP-013)” to be aware of which individuals in the state meet the definition of “children.”  The age of majority in Washington is 18; however, sometimes younger children have ability to consent for certain types of care (e.g. sexual reproduction/health; mental health; drug/alcohol treatment).  For research conducted outside of the state, provide information that describes which persons have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved the research, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which research will be conducted. One method of obtaining this information is to have a legal counsel or authority review your protocol along the definition of “children” in “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians (HRP-013).”  If the sites in other states in the study are conducting their own IRB review, you do not need to worry about this--type N/A.  If you are conducting research and are actively recruiting participants outside of Washington who are NOT coming to SCH to give consent and who will be covered under SCH IRB approval, this section should be addressed in your protocol. [ADDRESS_49740] of benefit, the IRB generally requires one parent to provide permission for the child to participate. 51 If parental permission will not be obtained, please address this in the Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process below. 52 See HRP-013 for more information. 53 The IRB generally follows the following guidelines for written assent: children 7-12 should provide written assent on the “simple” assent form (HRP-502G); children 13-17 should provide written assent by [CONTACT_3252]-signing the parental permission form (HRP-502A).  The IRB will consider other assent scenarios (e.g. verbal assent for some or all children; not requiring assent for some or all children; or waiving assent): please provide details about the plan for your study.  See HRP-090 and HRP-416 for more information on waiving assent and when assent is not necessary. 54 See Appendix A-13 of the Investigator Manual HRP-103 for requirements for re-consent at age 18.  If you think you meet the conditions for a waiver at 18, please address this in the Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process below. 55 See “HRP-417 Cognitively Impaired Adults” for further information.   56 For example: durable power of attorney for health care, court appointed guardian for health care decisions, spouse, and adult child.  If you are following HRP-013 in order to make this determination, simply state that in this section. For research conducted in the state, review “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians (HRP-013)” to be aware of which individuals in the state meet the definition of “legally authorized representative.” For research conducted outside of the state, provide information that describes which individuals are authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject to their participation in the procedure(s) involved in this research. One method of obtaining this information is to have a legal counsel or authority review your protocol along the definition of “legally authorized representative” in “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians (HRP-013).”  If the sites in other states in the study are conducting their own IRB review, you do not need to worry about this--type N/A.  If you are conducting research and are actively recruiting participants outside of Washington who are NOT coming to Washington to give consent and who will be covered under SCH IRB approval, this section should be addressed in your protocol. 57 The IRB may allow the person obtaining assent to document assent on the consent document. 58 For example: consent/parental permission will not be obtained, required information will not be disclosed, the research involves deception, waiver for participants who turn 18, waiver for information collected about a non-present parent, or other waivers as necessary. 59 The IRB needs to make all the waiver findings and key to this determination is that the IRB understand why it is not practicable to do the research without a waiver of consent.  You need to provide a rationale in order for the IRB to consider whether the waiver criteria are met. See “HRP-410: Waiver or Alteration of the Consent Process” for further information.   60 Possible reasons might include: a) you are not collecting information that could put subjects or their families at harm, e.g., affect eligibility for insurance, employability, stigmatization; b) you are not collecting information that would alter or affect the subject’s care; c) any publication or presentation of research results would be done in a manner that would never reveal an individual’s identity either directly or indirectly. 61 Possible reasons could be: a) inability to locate families because of the lengthy time period over which the records/samples were created; b) many of the subjects whose records, data, or specimens will be used may have died and contact[CONTACT_47267]; c) all eligible patients must be included in the study for the results to be meaningful. 62 See “HRP 419: Waiver of Consent for Emergency Research” for further information. 63 This section describes the ways in which the procedures will not be following Seattle Children’s SOP. 64 See “HRP-411: Waiver or Written Documentation of Informed Consent” for further information. [ADDRESS_49741] demonstrate that the electronic consent signatures are compliant with applicable state/international law (in Washington, see RCW 19.34.300).   69 For example: altering HIPAA elements for international research. 70 Possible reason could be: the nature of the research is specific to individuals’ health and requires access to individuals’ health records. 71 See “HRP-316: Payments” for further information.
